Abbey M.,"San Diego, CA",884,81,1373,4.0,1/4/2018,"BJ's... this place is always my go-to place when I can't think of a place I want to eat at... lol. Not sure why they don't have a better score on here but my visits have gotten better since the first time i've been! Those with 3 stars and lower.. please let me know when you go.. so I don't go on those days. lol STORE: This location is in the same shopping center as Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, Smash Burger, Which Wich, etc. There is a decent amount of parking here, you may just need to walk a smidge. The outside is always very clean when I go as well as the inside. This location tends to always be busy.. at least when I go. Which I would assume is a good thing..? right? lol. They have a bar, outside seating, T.Vs everywhere to watch sports, table sitting - booth sitting - high tables. Cant complain :) MENU: Large Menu - something I dislike is my menu is always sticky or stuck together.. that freaks me out since I can be a germaphobe, but other than that, theres something for everyone here. Pizza? sure. Pasta? Sure. Sammich? Sure. Watching your weight? Sure. Dont care how fat you are? Sure. My go-to for this place is always; - Strawberry Lemonade: sh* is bomb. Nuff sed. - Calamari appetizer: I'm not sure why I love their calamari so much but theyre one of the best ive had. There was one time it tasted different cause they used different calamari and I was about to lose it.. then came back and it was back to being the same deliciousness that I remember. So.. I can't complain lol - CHEESE CURDS appetizer: This was new on their menu when I first had them. Oh goood lawwwwrd I love me a cheese curd. Just deep fried cheese.. hell yeah! Just know its A LOT.. so be ready to share it or... eat it all, who am I to judge? lol - Chicken Alfredo Pasta: I tend to ask for extra sauce on the side cause it can be dry (at least to me since I like my sawwwce). So I like to control the sauce by pouring it myself. - PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN BREAST: My favorite!!! It's topped with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. That is a goooood night. If you want to substitute the sides you obviously can, but I never do cause I like to pretend that I am somewhat healthy lol. - PIZOOKIE: Just all of them. Its a must. My fave is getting the trio cause... well who wouldnt want 3 different cookies with ice cream?! Cookies and Cream is my fave tho! WORKERS: It can be a hit or miss, but as of lately all of them have been great. I always give extra points when they give you extra napkins and refill your drink before you even ask. Those are my sweet spots. lol NEGATIVE: Nothing really worth reporting. I've had slow service before or had to redo one of my meals but I meal, everyone has their off days. So as of now, not much.. OVERALL 1-5: Location (outside): 4 Location (inside): 4 Appearance (product): 4 Service: 4 Taste: 4 Mouth feel:  4 Overall: 4 Would I come back?: Always do.. lol"
Joanne A.,"San Diego, CA",1,1,,1.0,11/21/2017,1pm- seated 115- water given and order taken 130- food arrived 2pm- bill given I ordered soup and salad. The lentil soup was Luke warm and my wedge salad overdressed. My waiter did not refill my water or check on me at all. I didn't even have a chance to place another order. Now I'm at the drive through to have another meal because I'm still starving. I just wasted my lunch hour and money.
Joy M.,"San Diego, CA",428,426,9110,4.0,11/14/2017,"Wow, this review is long overdue.  We always stopped by here every time we hangout in this area. BJ's is literally our ""go to"" restaurant in Mission Valley area. Because they serve quality food and fresh, handcrafted beers in a casual, high energy atmosphere. The workers/ team members here exude a warm, friendly attitude. Gimme 5! And I loved their Enlightened menu my kind of low-calorie, superfoods, vegetarian and gluten-free options. We usually order: Chardonnay and Beers. My fave-Arugula Beet Salad, Salmon & Quinoa plate and their signature pizzas. Yum-O!   Came here recently after Barnes and Nobles books shopping (they're in the same shopping area). We greeted and seated right away. The staff here was polite and made us feel welcome.  For our recent dine in- We ordered 2 Chardonnay's @ $6.50 and Riesling $7.25. Appetizer: Turmeric Cauliflower $4.95-Entrees: Peruvian Quinoa Salad with Chicken $13.75, Salmon Dinner $ 19.50, Kale Brussels chicken salad $13.95 and to go GF chicken spinach pizza for kiddos-$15.25.  Decent price.Their extensive menu has a great deal of variety and can satisfy anyones taste. Overall, tasty food in a great friendly atmosphere. Always impeccable, nice big booths for families and friends. Big screen TV's, Nice bar and great seats to see any game in any season. We enjoyed our lunch- My salmon veggie plate was always perfection!Must order! YUM-O.  Loved the Kale Brussels salad super healthy options my new fave it was generously portioned salad shared for 2. dang it!  no more room for    the famous Pizookie dessert (never mind I am counting calories, Lol!  also, I love their premier rewards program. I redeemed $5.00 from our total check. That was cool!"
Cathee C.,"San Diego, CA",27,101,200,3.0,11/1/2017,"Nice location with lots of booth, bar, and patio seating but the food wasn't mind blowing. I only come here once in a blue moon when the pizookie cravings hit hard (Am I right ladies?!). And of course $3 pizookies in October brought me right back here. My chocolate chip pizookie with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream was of course heavenly and hit the spot right away! I just wish the ice cream was more frozen so it doesn't instantly turn into a soupy mess, making the cookie soggy.  My boneless wings were lukewarm so that turned me off right away. The hot and spicy buffalo lacked flavor and heat. The root beer flavor wings were surprisingly tasty! But again, room temperature and wings just don't mix. Overall, food will continue to be average here, but the pizookies are where it's at."
T C.,"Escondido, CA",0,7,1,2.0,1/7/2018,"1/6/2018 - went in at 4:00 p.m.  Understaffed at the time and told had to wait 15 minutes for servers in a restaurant not more than half full. Fine, sat in bar for quicker service and ignored.  When asked for service from an over 6 ft tall blonde male server, he was visibly ""bothered"" and had bad attitude. More than likely will NOT return to this particular BJ's near Fashion Valley.  My fault for venturing out of North County. Picture of the Twisted BLT salad......presentation of salad untouched upon arrival."
Ger R.,"San Diego, CA",29,6,,1.0,1/8/2018,Seems like I get overcharged every time i am there. Just watch your bill and what you receive. They like to sub  the happy hour items for full price when you do not specify. Real cool trick. :(
Jack M.,"San Diego, CA",5000,4064,27983,3.0,7/14/2017,"I had lunch at BJ's after a nearby meeting. I did not order one of their many well priced lunch specials but I did take advantage of their Mondays 1/2 priced deep pan or Tavern pizzas and a small wedge salad on the side of course. I went for BJ's Tavern Classic which came with mushrooms, pepperoni, and Italian mushrooms with a red sauce for $7.50. The salad was about $4. The wedge salad was very good and they recently changed their blue cheese dressing. It was a great change because the dressing was delicious. It was thick and creamy and came with tasty chunks of a mild blue cheese. The quart sliced wedge was crisp and fresh and I was pleased that they did not hold back on bacon. It was very good bacon too with a good crisp and a nice chew as well. It was a very nice salad over all. The Tavern Cut Pizza was good too, but they forgot the topping that was the main reason why I ordered the Tavern Classic, the mushrooms. When I brought it to their attention, they made a side of mushrooms to place onto the pizza, which was nice, but not the same.  If you like very thin crust pizza that is similar to a thin flat bread, these Tavern Cuts are for you. I like the thin crust and it surprisingly held up well to the ingredients a top. The pepperoni slices were tasty with a touch of spiciness, the crumbled Italian sausage was good, but although moist, it kinda had a spongy texture to it. I suspect it was previously frozen. The mushrooms I received were a little dry given they were not baked with the pizza nor were they sauteed. The red sauce was nice, not overly sweet nor acidic. Service was very good. Angela was attentive and certainly forgiving for the mistakes the kitchen staff made. Either way, the 1/2 pizza Monday's is a great deal."
Halli G.,"North Tonawanda, NY",18,4,,4.0,1/6/2018,"Our family of 4 had a great meal a month ago, we are looking forward to many more delicious meals at the Mission Valley location"
Doug B.,"Mountain View, CA",15,2,,5.0,1/5/2018,Every BJ's I've been to has been awesome. Great service. Excellent food and menu. They have my favorite peanut-butter stout. And always meet interesting people at the bar.
Martanday S.,"San Diego, CA",793,91,241,3.0,5/9/2017,"Love their Pizza! We usually dine at BJ's on Monday's as this is the day they have half off in large pizzas. Ambience:- Huge, they have outdoor and indoor seating and if it gets full which I doubt then you can grab a chair at their bar, quite nice. They could use some more lights as it gets dim at night. Food:-  1-; Chicken quesadilla  2-; Large Vegetarian pizza 3-; Chicken wings  Great so far, we usually order their large pizza, strawberry almond salad,chicken burger with fries. This time we tried their fried chicken and it was ok not great but still good! Service-: They could improve a lot on this front, servers comes across as slow and not the most attentive kind, one time I ordered easy cheese on my pizza, but instead I got no cheese  Pointers:- Please improve your customer service"
Dominique C.,"San Diego, CA",18,80,53,1.0,9/3/2017,"Ugh. Twice in one week. Twice just mediocre food.  Went with a friend - they left out the avocado of his mahi mahi salad, and that's why he got it! I had a salad that had the worst combo of items. My bad for ordering in the first place but they just threw all the ""super foods"" together without considering taste at all. ""baby kale and romaine, quinoa, sliced apples, fresh blueberries, crisp jicama, sweet corn, asparagus, diced cucumber and tomato"" Just stay away! I had hopes for them making random a$$ ingredients work together cause they are a restaurant, but they failed miserably.  I have no idea why the place is always busy. The second time hubby got dry ribs -- huge no no. I got just a side of beets with goat cheese. HUGE potential - but someone decided to dump a lb of salt on it. Oops. Top that with the saltiness of the goat cheese, totally not a good combo. Their house beer is ok, but nothing special. I would opt for the bottle stuff instead. The only thing I've had there that has been ok has been a cheese dip. Not enough for me to come back for it."
Mel C.,"Las Vegas, NV",237,1503,8255,4.0,3/31/2017,"My sister always picks BJ's when we meet for lunch or dinner. She dines here a lot since it's minutes from her office. I know it's a chain and Yelpers don't do chains. But this Yelper does. One thing about chains is that they're consistent. They can be consistently bad or consistently good. BJ's is one of those chains that's consistently good. The menu is extensive and their pizzas are the bomb, especially the Great White Pizza (chicken & Alfredo sauce). I've only been to this BJ's about 10 times in my life and my meals have been the same almost every time and that's their calamari as an app, the salmon for my main meal, and a small Peanut Butter Pizookie with Vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Overall, the service is pretty good and the food always hits the spot. I'm sure that I will be back. Besides, my favorite sister loves this place."
Jeneth D.,"San Diego, CA",142,157,458,5.0,12/2/2017,This BJ's restaurant exceeded all expectations last Thursday. Andy and her staff took care of all 20+ attendees to make sure our speed mentoring event was executed successfully. Thank you for your attentiveness and quality service and food!  We will definitely be back!
SeanTodd A.,"San Diego, CA",3,20,,3.0,1/2/2018,"The deep dish pizza is good. They do have a large variety of food and dinner to choose from. Some of the sauces are too rich and sweet, like the sauce on the salmon dinner. I had the special Monday $5 margarita and it was very bad, I only had 1 sip. It tasted like a melted lemonade popsicle, very heavy on the syrup. But the primary issue we had, seated in at a booth in the bar area, was with our server. She had poor customer service. She had a bad attitude, and made our dinner uncomfortable. Also they messed up the bill in their favor with no apology upon having to fix it. It was a shame, cuz, like I said, I do like the pizza. I cannot overlook this bad service we received, and the bad margarita."
Tranae L.,"San Diego, CA",133,23,57,4.0,11/17/2017,"I went into BJ's Mission Valley around 10 and we were promptly greeted and sat by the hostess who was friendly. It was Thursday night and so it wasn't as busy as a weekend night, but I still appreciated  the prompt service. We needed up moving to the patio and were greeted by our server Jonathan. He was patient with us (literally takes me ten years to order) and gave us honest opinions on the food. He was super hilarious and made me feel welcomed which was the big reason as to why I liked my experience. Also every fellow coworker was nice as well. Everything was prepared great. We had the avocado egg rolls, the Thursday rib special and their holiday ribeye special. BOMB  I had a great dinner and enjoyed our whole experience there. I'd choose to drive here over La Mesa's BJ's any day."
Desi T.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",11,16,4,4.0,12/23/2017,I come here pretty regularly. There is a wait most times but is to be expected. Wait staff have always been helpful and quick. The bar and corresponding area is always another good option. We recently did the holiday brew pairing and I have to say it was terrific! It was a bit slow for the food to roll out but with beer on hand it was not a big issue.
Amanda S.,"Brookline, MA",108,25,2,4.0,1/1/2018,"For what the restaurant is (essentially a glorified Applebee's), I was impressed.  The Enlightened menu had shrimp Peruvian quinoa bowls, which was average, but seemed fresh and healthy, unlike the microwaved crap you'll get at most similar chains.  The Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie was to die for.  Reasonable prices too."
Bert G.,"San Diego, CA",82,609,444,3.0,7/8/2017,"My first ever dining experience at any BJ's location !  And right now, I'm waffling:  Two Stars or Three? Our party of eight was promptly and efficiently seated after two tables were butted together.  We ordered beer by the pitcher (very cold !) but were presented warm glasses.  The selection of beers is spectacular. The beer menu shows the IBU scale (International Bitterness Units).  This scale will prevent any accidental orders of face-puckeringly bitter beer. My wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad ($15.95) and loved it!  She said it was perfectly prepared with an excellent dressing.  Sitting next to her, I can tell you, it looked good. My order was not up to par.  The Fish & Chips ($15.95) consisted of several small pieces of  cod, over-breaded and deeply ordinary, accompanied by a large amount of over-salted fries.  Perhaps the idea is to encourage more beer sales by over-salting?  It sure encouraged water consumption later ! There were other problems, given there were eight orders.  One was a hamburger that was way overcooked, although ordered medium rare, ironically accompanied by an undercooked baked potato.  Another individual had a food complaint, as well.  In addition, a discount card was presented but wasn't honored.  Granted, the manager very politely and quite obligingly rectified every problem, and the total bill was reduced accordingly.   The manager's professional behavior, and the good service we received make BJ's in Mission Valley A-OK in my book.  I'll make a different menu choice next time."
Melinda J.,"National City, CA",287,86,261,4.0,1/3/2017,"Came to this location and gave it a second chance which happened to be ten times better then the first. Our server this time was Elizabeth and we sat in the bar area where we got to pick out on seats. She was very good at getting us water and not taking a long time before taking our order. I love that they have so many screens that you can watch the games on. Which is great for sports fanatics.  As a table we ordered 2 pazookies (the oringial chocolate chunk and the cookies and cream), spinach and artichoke dip, and buffalo wings. Everything came put within a reasonable time and was all so delicious to help our hunger cravings. Pazookies are always a much get from any BJs because how could you resist a warm cookie with ice cream??"
Sabrina N.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",7,4,7,5.0,12/22/2017,This is my first time here.  The menu is immense and varied.  Ambience softly lit and dark wood.  We ate in a booth with great service.  I had the Asian Chopped Salad and stuffed mushrooms and boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti.  We also had great hard cider.  Being mutually in love with nutty brunettes we liked this banner.
Kylie W.,"San Diego, CA",225,5,,5.0,11/10/2017,Came in on Wednesday night with a girlfriend and had the best service I've ever had here! Food was great too! Was started out by James who was not only helpful but funny as well. He dropped out drinks off and let us know that he'd be going on break and that Jamell would be helping us out. He did a great job of checking up on us and making sure the food was on point! Which it was!  Brendon also made a couple stops at our table making sure I never had to wait and look around for someone to grab us something.  How often can you say you have three very attentive people waiting on you! Just felt like giving credit where it's due. Great job guy thanks for making our night out a pleasant one!  Also the manager Andy was a sweetheart! We will be back:)
Laura G.,"Mesa, AZ",20,21,3,1.0,9/23/2017,"15 min wait for a table, seated at 8:32 and by 8:50 no one has been to the table for drink orders or even acknowledged us.  I go to the stand where several wait staff are standing and I ask if someone can come over. I am told they would go find my waiter. 5 min later some one comes by and asks if anyone has shown yet...of course no.  She indicates that he's busy with a big party.....SERIOUSLY? NOT MY PROBLEM. Then you shouldn't have sat me at his station if he can't handle a big party and me and my guest.  She takes our drink order and walks away...not to the bar to place the order, but to another table to take an order.  Feeling done knowing no one is coming and its going to be a long wait, and I just want dinner.  I get up and leave.  NEVER coming back.   Went to the Dennys across the street.  Seated, placed an order and got a drink in 10 min of arriving."
Treena Mariel S.,"Tulsa, OK",227,4,2,1.0,12/17/2017,"Worst customer service ever. Would've given this place zero stars if possible. Got to the restaurant and & told the host who the reservation was for. First of all, as a host you're the first impression. The host last night was terrible at this. She just kept giving us a look like she didn't want us there & just kept giving attitude throughout the whole time. Our reservation was for 6, but they sat us at 4 seat table. So we had to wait another 30 mins before being seated to the correct table. Then another 30 mins before they started taking our order, another 30-40 mins before we actually got our food. Not to forget, they had failed to order one of our appetizers. This place sucks, they only pay attention to some of their customers. And the hosts are a bunch of snobby people"
Phuc T.,"San Diego, CA",4,31,4,4.0,12/14/2017,"Great happy hour. Servers and bartenders are always nice and easy to talk to. During HH, $4 dollar house beers, $6 house burgers, $1 off craft brews. Lots of TV's in the bar area."
Bill B.,"Mesa, AZ",80,83,19,3.0,7/13/2017,The food is always outstanding at BJ's. lots of people in town this week so they were REALLY slow. I have never been in one of their locations when it has been so loud that you couldn't even have a conversation with the other person at your table.  Love the food...hate the ambience.
Mona J.,"Blossom Valley, San Diego, CA",1,31,5,5.0,12/3/2017,Awesomely yummy food plus the customer service was off the chart. I'll eat here if I could everyday the parking sucks
Demi A.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,305,697,3.0,11/16/2016,"Bj's is your typical chain restaurant, the food is pretty decent but doesn't really stand out from the crowd, cool place to have lunch on the patio after running errands at the mall next door.  Mini and I sat on the patio, the weather was perfection.   Mini ordered the California Chicken Club Layered with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and roasted garlic aioli on grilled sourdough bread served with fries.  She was pretty happy with it, finished the entire sandwhich and fries. I ordered the North Beach Mahi with Shrimp, Oven-roasted mahi-mahi seasoned with Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold Rub, sauteed with shrimp, red onions, tomatoes, Kalamata olives and spicy garlic, served over couscous with fresh herbs. It was a really light dish, just ok on flavor I had to keep adding salt."
Katie R.,"San Diego, CA",167,400,104,2.0,10/25/2016,"I can see why this place fluctuates between 2.5 and 3 stars. I'm between the two myself.  I always wanted to stop in despite it's chain-esque persona. The menu is huge with a lot of delicious looking offerings, and not all horribly bad for you, either. I had the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. The broccoli cheese soup was very good, house salad was boring but fresh, and while I definitely didn't love how thick the lentil soup was, the flavor was good. So what's the problem? Service was SO slow. That little lunch took a full 60 minutes and I had a conference to get back to.   I do want to come back to try some of the entrees, but will definitely be keeping in mind that it will be a bit of a longer visit than most restaurants."
Francisco Z.,"Pasadena, CA",0,4,1,5.0,9/23/2017,"Fantastic food, A+ service. Every. Single. Time. Dog-friendly patio and staff. Came around midnight after a concert at the Qualcomm stadium and still got the Royal Treatment.  I love BJ's Restaurant and this location in particular! 10/10"
Desiree B.,"San Diego, CA",25,153,96,3.0,6/22/2017,"Meh, I've been here a few times for lunch and happy hour but I've never actually written a review. I came with a friend for lunch and it wasn't as busy as it usually is during lunch. We decided to sit outside on the patio which is nice. We both ordered the unlimited soup and salad for $8.99. I got a house salad and the lentil soup and my friend got a Caesar salad with Chicken Tortilla. It was good and what you expect for a soup and salad. I work across the street and it took 1 1/2 for our entire meal ( only soup and salad) I'm not sure if they were under staffed or if it was because we chose to sit outside but it took a lot longer than usual considering we were on our hour lunch break.  I'll be back when I'm not on my lunch break."
Breezy C.,"San Diego, CA",151,54,64,5.0,5/13/2017,"Came here last night and I'm so glad!! Best food and service I've had from going out to eat in a long time. Recently, I've noticed a lot of bad attitudes from employees, and bad customer experience in general. Stacy went above and beyond to make us feel good about our time, and gave us the best customer service possible. Bonus for being a Friday night! I couldn't decide what tea to get so she brought out all of them for me to try! She was informative about vegetarian options and patient with our indecisiveness. Definitely coming back and asking for STACY"
Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",651,1121,4657,3.0,9/5/2016,"Came in for a late lunch. We were seated right away. When we got seated, the waitress gave my daughter an activity book with crayons. We were also given menus.  As I was looking through the menu, they had new sandwiches. I got bacon and chicken piadina. It came with ranch and got potato wedges with it. If you upgrade to unlimited fries and drinks, it was $1.00 more. Not bad. I ended up getting another plate of potato wedges. Service was slower here than the location in Chula Vista. It seemed like we waited forever for our food. The sandwich was delicious. I got a couple of burnt pieces of fries in my plate.  Service was slow. There were lots of large screen televisions throughout the restaurant. Place was busy. I think I will stick to the Chula Vista location."
Morgan F.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,1,3.0,10/15/2017,"Ehhhh. This is the second time back to back I have to say this Pros: the food is wonderful, very fresh, crisp, and overall delicious. Especially the pizookie. They are absolutely my favorite.  Cons: this is one of the biggest issue I've ever had with BJs especially this one. The service is GOD AWFUL. I can't even begin to explain. Our server came over to take our order. Completely forgot to bring the drinks out. So when we got our appetizers from another server we had to have her bring our drinks. Another thing when we completely ran out of water no waiter passed us by and none came by to bring water until our waitress came to our table and we had to ask her for water. Last thing I would have to say is they messed up our check 2 times.... Overall the food is really delicious, but the service was complete crap. I'm so disappointed because I really do like BJs but having back to back horrible service makes me not want to come here again!"
Anthony S.,"Long Beach, CA",288,49,205,2.0,5/21/2017,"Normally I like BJ's restaurants, but this particular one is average at best. My last visit was yesterday when I was very hungry and I wanted to watch the Warriors game after a long graduation ceremony. I learned from my last visit that this location does not have tables in the main dining room that can seat parties greater than 6. For this reason, my family had to sit at a high table in the bar area. The table was sticky, and so the busboy wiped the table for us with a wet cloth, but that did not help at all. The waiter was very anti-social and seemed like he hated his life. When taking orders he stood on one side of the table. When he couldn't hear one of us, he did not move around to them so that he can. Instead, he stayed in one spot and spoke with a little bit of an attitude to get someone to speak up. After submitting our order, he told us he was going on break and made what seemed like a passive-aggressive joke about it. The person covering our table while he was on break was much nicer and was really attentive. Despite the below-average service from our previous waiter, we still gave a 20% tip. When you are hungry, food usually tastes really good, though the food here was just decent. It is not the same quality of other BJ's restaurants. However, the pizookie is good no matter which BJ's you choose to go to. As stated before, we came yesterday to watch the Warriors game. A lot of TVs had the game on but the only one i could actually see fully had the duck's game on. After the duck's game, nobody was looking at that TV anymore, so it was requested to be changed to the Warriors game. Someone agreed to change the channel, but did not, so we asked again. By the time we were done eating and paid the check, over 30 minutes have passed and the channel did not change. As for parking, the lot is almost always full so you have to walk a short distance. Majority of the spaces are for compact cars, some spaces acknowledged it, but some did not. Luckily, we found a parking spot on the Barnes and nobles side, which had bigger parking spaces."
Jenny B.,"Chino Hills, CA",355,241,135,3.0,2/19/2017,This is just one noisy food place where you can eating generic dishes.  Nothing spectacular about their dishes.  A menu for everyones palate.  A large deep dish classic combo was lacking in flavor despite all the cheese.  The boneless bbq chicken nuggets was mediocre.  Very sad spaghetti & meatball. Party of 7 and we all took half of the left overs home cause it wasn't that great.  But our service was great.  She served our drinks and our needed requests.
Chanika C.,"San Diego, CA",39,4,10,3.0,12/5/2017,Seating was quick but it took the waitress forever to come and even take our drink order. The appetizers arrived with the food. Food was good but the service really sucks. They should definitely look into hiring more people!
Joe M.,"San Diego, CA",99,382,56,4.0,9/9/2017,"Pretty busy place, even during the week. Great tasting beer and food. I definitely come again. Service was slow...."
Bia E.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/13/2017,"I'm so disappointed with this place.  I always want to try it, the structure looks like so nice and modern, but stops by there. I went with a friend on 12/05, no lines and the service was ok.  Talking about food, I asked a Bbq Bison burger and it was my first time trying it, I notice that my burger was to dry and asked the waitress if it would come with bbq sauce or the ""bbq"" was the way that burger was cooked?! She said that it should come with the bbq sauce, what wasn't there. I was already at the end of my burger and she offer if I wanted the sauce, sweet by her but not useful, I was almost done. My friend asked the classic Rib-eye, the rib was ok, nothing in special, the different quinoa that they charge a little be more, nothing in special again, the asparagus was supper bitter.  So, not worth it for a $65 dinner for 2 at all The good part was the beer, only ‍"
Cassie M.,"San Diego, CA",4,16,7,3.0,11/21/2017,"The food was decent, service was terrible. Asked for no mushrooms on the pizza and it was covered in it. I was still eating my food when the server asked for dessert and proceeded to put the check on the table. Felt super rushed. I don't expect this experience to be perfect but damn let me finish my food!"
