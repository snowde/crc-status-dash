Britnee S.,"San Diego, CA",25,35,16,1.0,2/3/2016,"Update: Nothing has changed. Tiffany S. Who responded to my original review never got back to me and I've visited several all other times to this location and been disappointed every single time (stretched throughout a year). The cooks still mess up my order most of the time (not complex orders either, ex: a sandwich without mayo, etc), a couple times I've had to seat myself and/or grab a menu myself, long wait times between the kitchen and now even the waiters/waitresses. Last night mine and my boyfriends pizzas were not cut and I didn't get offered a refill so I had to go to the bar to ask for a soda.  I don't pay to go out to eat to sit myself, wait over 30 minutes for my food only for it to be wrong or wait on myself. The management doesn't care, the kitchen doesn't care and now the waiters don't care anymore. I live down the street but I won't return, 20 chances is more than enough in over 1 1/2 year span."
Liz D.,"San Diego, CA",282,40,11,5.0,2/27/2016,"Today was a very emotional day. My sweet, 11 year old pitbull was diagnosed with 2 large tumors on his liver and spleen. He will be getting put down tomorrow, so I decided to treat him to a steak lunch. I was worried that BJ's wouldn't accept us. After telling the hostess I just wanted to treat my fur son, she smiled and said I could sit on the patio. Our waitress was smiling from ear to ear when she saw Pirate. When she brought our food, she brought Pirate a steak with ""Pirate"" and a dog bone written in sauce on the plate. I burst into tears....numerous staff came out to say hello to Pirate and love on him. I can not get over the love and compassion I felt from this staff towards my sweet baby. The food was great as well!"
Jericho S.,"San Diego, CA",242,30,4,5.0,5/12/2016,I came here for Mother's Day and was impressed. Hardly any wait for a table.  Our server was very attentive to any of our request. It was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. I like how they have sports channels playing in the background. A coloring book for my nephew. Biggest pro: Their menu has pictures!!!! Haha. That's tough to find nowadays.  Price range is above average but worth it.
Jamie R.,"Naples, FL",653,1010,1058,3.0,2/24/2015,"There are two salmon offerings.  I chose Moroccan spiced.  The fish was really good - grilled and dusted with spice.  The accompanying veg however were overpowered by (a guess) something like sirocco.   Atmosphere is really good.  These guys pioneered the craft beer movement and there is equipment behind glass to admire.  This site rewrote a bit of history by adding beautifully done Craftsman style art glass (borrowing from Frank Lloyd Wright) featuring a 1930s styled beer maker admiring his brew.  In history, the revivalist craftsman hated machines. So considering our tech age, this Century old philosophy doesn't jibe with modern processes.  Anyway, the wood and glass make for a lovely room. Service was very attentive on a late afternoon, rainy Sunday."
Breanne M.,"San Diego, CA",133,254,316,5.0,7/10/2015,"I love this place! Been coming here since they opened this location and it's great. The service is awesome and the food is delicious! I had the new shrimp and Mahi-Mahi tonight, topped off with a yummy chocolate chip pazookie! You've also got to try the new brussel sprouts - YUM!"
Juliana C.,"San Diego, CA",660,242,3280,3.0,2/18/2014,"I have been to a BJ's before in Sacramento, and they just opened a brand new location in Mission Valley. My BF was a little tired of eating Asian food and wanted something American. I suggested BJ's. American food and beer? Done.  It was not crowded at all for a Sunday night. Plenty of seating in the dining room, the bar area, and the outside patio. Initially I wanted to sit at the outdoor patio of course, because it was outside and there was a giant round fire pit, but it was a bit too cool outside for me, even with the space heaters, so we decided on a booth in the dining room. It was the middle booth, and had a view of the whole restaurant and several TV's.  For their hand crafted sodas and beer, I chose the root beer and black cherry to try. The beer, my BF started with the Abbey normal, and then wanted to try the Tatonka Stout, but they didn't have it, so he had the PM Porter instead. He liked both. As for the sodas, you can try a different soda each refill (which are free), I personally like the root beer the best.  We got the clam chowder to start. It was really good. If you like a lot of bread, I suggest getting the chowder in a bread bowl. I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta for my entree. It was good. The pasta was not drenched in cream, broccoli was steamed well, small soft pieces, and the chicken was a bit dry. I would've liked more chicken and broccoli for the pasta ratio. It was topped with 2 pieces of toasted bread. That was a bit dry as well, and asked for some marinara sauce, the sauce was perfect for the bread, but watch out, it has a kick! He decided to get the 12"" Gourmet Five meat Deep dish pizza. It had meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham and salami. I don't care for a lot of bread for pizza, but it was delicious! Our server was nice, helpful, and attentive."
Raquel D.,"South El Monte, CA",96,8,6,1.0,3/26/2016,"I Had a bad experience with this restaurant.  I came in last night  with my 2 girls out from LA by the way! On a road trip. We decided to drive out here because it sounded like a good decent dinner before we head out.  Waited at the front desk for a decent time. I don't understand why there was no one there to greet or settle us down. But I also understand it's was not only friday but ""good"" friday still very unprofessional..  Once being settled down our server seemed to be attentive. So I was looking forward to that, he got our meals on time, Drinks were right on. My chicken Alfredo was ok not the best pasta was over cooked which made it a bit hard & crunchy o.O. After waiting and waiting for our server to come by. Literally we had to ask someone else for service. -.-  not to mention our drinks were not being refilled. We decided to use the restrooms since we had a long way ahead of us.. No darn toilet paper!!! Ah I was ready to leave at this point. I made sure to let someone know about that situation. Not sure If they followed up. Walking out with 2 boxes on my hands.. I would have thought they would suggest a bag. Hah think again. I was literally looking in  through the front desk for a bag. Whatever I'm so over this place"
Ellie C.,"South San Francisco, CA",257,59,12,5.0,3/13/2016,"I've been meaning to write this review for a while. I've been here a few times and I always get great service.  Liz took care of us one night. She was super!  On another occasion I called in to order for pick up, Mackenzie was working the to go area. She was extremely nice. It blew me away how happy and jolly she was, especially since I assume working the to go counter is boring as hell.  Anyways, I always get the avocado egg rolls. You seriously can't go wrong."
Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",235,920,2051,4.0,5/8/2014,"It's a chain restaurant, so you know what you're getting. The place was packed when we initially stopped by, but neither of us wanted to sit around waiting for an hour, so we decided to hit up the nearby Target to get some errands out of the way before circling back for dinner.   I'm glad we did that (not that the Target experience was great, because it really wasn't) - by the time we got back to the restaurant, there was no wait. We checked in and got seated at a booth right away, though the dining room was packed and loud.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We both ordered drinks and the calamari to start, before going through the menu. I decided to try a new item, the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, while my husband went with his usual order, the shrimp tacos.   It took a while for the calamari to be brought to our table, and I have to wonder if it's because they decided to fry the heck out of it. The little squid pieces were so deeply fried that they were almost burnt, and they were inedible. It's a shame, too, because we both really had a hankering for calamari.   The main dishes came out not too long after, and I admit, when I saw our waitress walking towards our table with the plates in hand, I wanted to laugh. The plates looked so tiny! Yes, we both ordered off of the ""Lighter Fare"" menu, but come on! The plates looked almost laughably small in her hands.   Still, once I started to tuck in, I realized that there was enough food on the plate to satiate me. The little pita tacos were interesting. The chicken was chopped into bite-sized pieces, and the pita was piled high with everything - chicken, diced tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs. It was supposed to come with a sauce for dipping, but they barely provided anything. If I order it again, I'd ask for extra sauce, because the ""taco"" itself can be a bit dry. The other thing it came with was a bulgur salad, which was delicious. The salad itself was a tiny serving, but it was loaded with cheese, tomato, cucumber and herbs, and it was pretty filling.   Of course, once we were done, we decided that our meal would be incomplete without a Pizookie. They had a couple new flavors out, and we decided on the salted caramel version. What can I say...I'm a sucker for salted caramel anything!   When they brought it to us, I thought, ""Well, that's the saddest looking Pizookie I've seen yet."" The tower of ice cream had already melted into the cookie, so it wasn't as grand and tall as it usually is. But, that didn't mean that it wasn't delicious. Boy, howdy, was it yummy!   All in all, it was another good night of good, cheap food from a chain we're coming to enjoy. The only downer was the well-done calamari."
Mesha G.,"San Diego, CA",222,119,70,5.0,3/26/2016,"I've been to BJ's a few times before, but never this one and I was highly impressed with their customer service, food, drinks and cleanliness. We had an after work happy hour, and people staggered in. There was a large number of us at the end of it and Jason, our server, did a fantastic job! He had food recommendations that were honest and spot on, he even went out of his way to split up a few checks for us. And with people staggering in, he did a great job of grabbing drinks and orders and food all at the same time. He kept a smile on through all of this chaos and I really appreciated it. Probably one of the best servers I've had in a really long time. The food was great and I loved the pear cider. I recommend any of the deep dish tots, we had a few of them at our table. I can't wait to go back!"
Linda D.,"San Diego, CA",675,594,4292,2.0,2/5/2014,"Painful sums it up.  I truly like BJ's. You could almost call me a fan. However, I had a horrendous experience on my last visit. I don't like bad service. However, ZERO service is beyond me. On my most recent visit, I actually had the opportunity to have what I could say was quite horrible service. I was sitting in the bar area as I usually do when I come here. And on this particular occasion my table went through 2 and almost three servers. The first two were great but had to stop serving my table due to schedule and shift changes. Not sure if the third person was not informed that they were supposed to cover our table, but she clearly knew to serve every other table in our section but mine. If anyone at our table wanted anything, we actually got better service by walking over to the bartender and ordering food and drinks. The only person who stopped by our table to see if we needed anything was the person bussing tables. This kind of service would have made me walk out of the restaurant and I wanted too, however we were watching a playoff football game and wanted to stay and enjoy ourselves.  After being ignored completely from before the National Anthem to halftime -which is well over an hour, I had to complain to the manager. This is the first time that I have ever had to complain at a restaurant about piss poor service. You can't even call it service when you are NOT being served at all. A switch over is staff happened on a previous occasion that resulted in having our table ignored and not well taken card of. TWO THUMBS DOWN!! This kind service puts a bad taste in my mouth and makes me not want to go back. However I will be fair and say that I will go back and hope that I don't have this kind of service from there ever again. This place is a great place most of the time. Food is good and atmosphere is pretty chill. The service needs to step it up."
Tyler P.,"San Diego, CA",312,54,2,1.0,1/23/2016,"Horrible service. Took 10 minutes just to get a waitress to acknowledge we are here. Finally made an order. Took a while to get it out (even though it looked pretty empty). One drink refill that was long overdue. Didn't see our waitress untill we were about to walk out and not pay because we were waiting so long for our check. Food was dry too.  This place sucked. I wish they would either hire more staff, or be more attentive to detail."
Lindsay H.,"Atascadero, CA",0,42,6,5.0,5/7/2017,"Okay so first and foremost, when you first walk in, everyone is so nice and seats you right away. Our server was J.D. it was a busy night and we continued to ask for items after he brought us what we previously asked for without hesitation. Always a smile on his face and never seemed stressed out. You can tell a good person when you meet them and he is absolutely that. This place is very lucky to have him. He's very attentive, like the boyfriend you've always wanted haha!  That is how a waiter should make someone feel, like you are welcome instead of a burden. Awesome place. Try the pizzokies. So good!"
Eva L.,"San Diego, CA",36,38,9,1.0,10/12/2016,"I'm a regular here and have noticed the service has been declining for some time now. Today was the worst. Ordered an appetizer and received in 10 minutes. Ordered our food and after 40 minutes had another server locate ours since she just ""disappeared "". When she finally arrived we asked her to check in our order. Waited again only for her to say that it was never ordered. I asked for the check and left. No apologies at all were given.  She didn't seem to care either. Will never return."
Rkc D.,"San Diego, CA",1,10,,1.0,9/7/2016,"Horrible experience last time we went to this BJs restaurant.  The waitress didn't care a bit about taking care of our table.  She wouldn't check if we are ready to order, when the food comes in, we requested her to help with serving the pizza and she didn't even care.  We complained to the manager and I didn't see any change in their behavior. Still I put in 20% tip for her assuming she was having a bad day.  When I gave her my rewards numbers so that I could get points for the bill, she as expected didn't do it and the points don't show up in my BJs premier rewards.. THANK YOU BJs for RUINING OUR EVENING.  YOU WERE EXCELLENT AT IT."
Nathan K.,"San Diego, CA",63,78,13,5.0,2/11/2016,"They have a nice little lunch combo. Had the half sandwich with soup and salad. I ordered a Caesar, which was larger than the typical side salad. Tomato bisque soup had a slight creaminess and tasted good. Sandwich was the California chicken club. Very good but bread portion was super greasy. I would have preferred it lightly toasted with a little butter. But otherwise fine. Service was excellent."
David P.,"Anaheim, CA",132,223,817,3.0,12/16/2014,"This was one of the better BJ's in San Diego compared to the one in La Jolla. This location was much bigger since it's a stand alone and had many more TV screens for the sports enthusiast. We came after the Chargers Broncos game so there were a lot of Broncos fans relishing in their victory while watching the SNF game. I liked the elevated seats they had since it really gives you a grand view of the entire restaurant. The service was a bit slow, but I can understand since they were packed after the football game. It irked me that it took 20 mins for a waiter to come to us and ask for orders. The waiter seemed like a college student so he didn't have that waiter-ish personality. We didn't get offered water until we asked for some after getting our cocktails. There were times when I tried to flag down other waiters for service, but they seemed like chickens with their heads cut off since everyone was running around. They wouldn't make eye contact with you if you yelled to get their attention so they can move past you asap. I do commend them on offering a complimentary pizookie since it was my gf's birthday month. The pizzokie was delicious, as always. As for the cocktails, we go the Strawberry Splash and I got the Peach Sangria. The SS was very sweet, but apparently has grey goose. The peach sangria was tasteful with a hint of wine as an after taste. For entrees, we got a White Pie and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. A tid bit to everyone when they say ""white pie"", they don't actually leave out the marinara. They put marinara on the pizza and drizzle alfredo sauce over the pie. We were a bit disappointed since white pie always meant alfredo sauce sans marinara. The parm chicken was delicious and I could always come back for more. Overall, it was a decent sunday night meal that was even better with the sports atmosphere. IF you don't like noise or sports guys screaming during dinner, then dont come after a big sports game."
Criselle O.,"San Diego, CA",116,432,300,1.0,12/26/2014,"I've always been a fan of BJ's restaurants but my last experience left me with the worst impression.  Ever. My friend actually ate here with some friends but she got me the ahi poke appetizer to-go.  HOLY SHIT, IT WAS THE WORST.  It only had a few pieces of poke on a bed of dry greens and to top it off... some stale chips. Seriously, what the f.  Now, I know what the ahi poke appetizer looks like because I always get it whenever I go to BJ's and it always looks so good and there's always plenty on the the plate (sometimes I can't even finish it because there's too much) but wow, it looked like they just threw shit in a to-go box because it was late.  I mean, don't get me wrong... I get that it was around 10PM when they left but really?  I was so upset because I couldn't do anything about it because she had already paid and left. The $14 bill was definitely not worth it. After that experience, I don't EVER want to go back to this location.  That's too bad because I loved going here since it's near my boyfriend's place.  SUCKS."
Randy S.,"Eastvale, CA",0,14,1,1.0,5/18/2017,"Horrible customer service. A server tried to sit my kids down in the bar area when there was plenty of tables available. Not sure he even should have been the one sitting customers down. When I said I didn't want to sit with my kids in the bar area he said ""Have a good day then"""
Anh Kim D.,"San Diego, CA",27,51,51,5.0,6/5/2015,"Love this location already. Drove in and a parking space was available near the entrance. It looks packed and there was a small line, we waited for 10 minutes to be seated. The waiter gave us our menus and water right away. For a Friday night (9pm) we only waited 15 mins for our food.  Happy with my food and service!"
