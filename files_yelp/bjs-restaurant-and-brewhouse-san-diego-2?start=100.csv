Holly S.,"San Diego, CA",8,3,2,4.0,1/26/2017,The only reason I did not give a 5 is due to noise level (we could not hear everyone at our own table). The food was incredible I will definitely be coming back. I ordered the Great White Deep Dish Pizza. Great flavor and very eye appetizing. My kids really appreciated getting a (free) kids starter it was a perfect little gold over until food (bread knots and fruit).  If you can get James he was amazing and is great with kids. He knew exactly what we needed with the kiddos. 6 stars for James!!!
Vanessa E.,"San Bernardino, CA",52,32,11,1.0,12/21/2016,"DO NOT GO TO THIS BJS! I've always been a fan of bjs where I live but I went to San Diego for the day. All I ate was their chicken Alfredo . I felt sick once I was finished but it went away. The next day I woke up to my stomach hurting, once again it went away. Mid day I was throwing up all the pasta and chicken! I GOT FOOD POISONING! They brought out the food really quick but now that I look back at it, it was so quick they probably under cooked the chicken, if I could give no star I deff would. I'm going to call corporate on this place, they obviously aren't following the rules. Now I'm here puking my life away.  UPDATE: The management team contacted me by email saying they would like to give me a gift card and if I could call them to resolve the issue. I called multiple times and never got an answer. They never sent me a gift card and never tried to contact me again. Obviously this shows the management here is a big joke. This is a horrible excuse of a BJs. Save your money and your well being by skipping on this specific location."
Robyn C.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,,1.0,9/20/2017,"Went for lunch at 11:30 and 3 of us ordered the unlimited soup and salad. Never asked us if we wanted anymore salad or soup once, just took our plates away. Service was slow and they were not busy. Disappointed. Will pick a different restaurant in the area next time."
Katie L.,"San Diego, CA",54,64,17,2.0,7/14/2017,"I am officially not coming back here. I have given this place SO many try's because it's right next to my house, and to no surprise.. they have terrible reviews. Service almost ALWAYS sucks. Have more the one server on your patio at ALL times, especially throughout the summer. Waited so long for drinks, food, checks, etc this last time. Usually we sit at the bar and there is only one bartender who has ever even been nice and attentive.. short brunette.. sweet girl. But this was the last straw for me, get it together!! Don't be that chain that no one wants to go to!"
Karen H.,"San Diego, CA",131,430,4105,4.0,12/9/2015,"Nice location, I've only been here twice but it's way bigger than the La Jolla location. We came in at 5pm for dinner and drinks. There was no wait, plenty of open seats almost empty. Service was really quick and the server was friendly. I enjoyed the clam chowder bowl. It wasn't anything special. My boyfriend enjoyed the jalapeño burger with fries. BJ's is also a brewery so you can enjoy some of their brews. They have outdoor seating with a fire pit and tv's. The inside is a little dark but nicely decorated.  Parking lot gets filled up quick so I parked in the back of the parking lot. The walk up wasn't bad at all.  Good spot for happy hour and appetizers. Menu is ok but it's nothing I would drive out of my way for. EXCEPT for the pizookie dessert! That I will drive back for anytime. It's a huge cookie topped with your choice of ice cream. Just try it!"
Eden A.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,13,4,5.0,11/1/2017,"Just finished having dinner here with my best friend and we happened to have Shannon as our server. Come to find out today was her first day serving on her own. I waited to speak to a manager after we finished eating and got our bill because I strongly believe in giving credit where credit is due. Shannon provided us with hands down the best service we've ever had at any BJs location. Not only was she quick, but she was polite, extremely friendly and caring. I used to be a server and I know when someone is BSing too much for a tip. I didn't get that vibe from her even a little bit and I really appreciate that. She was genuinely sweet and cared about our experience - on top of everything. My best friend and I have BJs as our go to place to eat and if she's there, we'll definitely be asking for Shannon as our server from now on. It also meant a lot that her manager was just as excited to hear my positive feedback on Shannon and she said she couldn't wait to write my compliment in her reports. It shows a lot about management when they truly want to hear the feedback and will pass it along to their employees. Thank you for a great experience Shannon!"
Desiree S.,"San Diego, CA",105,8,,2.0,9/17/2017,First of all they did not have my game on the screen till we asked.  Secondly the service was slow.  Third they team out of things we asked for.  Com on you all its football season you all know you gonna be busy.  Get it together
Natalie G.,"San Diego, CA",51,67,9,4.0,7/5/2017,"I LOVE their app! I recently discovered the benefits and I'm so happy I did. Amazing coupons such as  (buy one get one free entrees, free appetizers, etc. and table reservations, plus an amazing rewards program! I love the variety of their menu and I can always count on them for a food, fairly priced meal. I've been coming to BJs for years and I always leave satisfied. I'm not big on their pizzas but their main entrees are great"
Firetruck M.,"Los Angeles, CA",148,226,,4.0,11/7/2016,"I'm usually not a fan of BJ's, but this one was A-OK. First off, we didn't have to wait to get seated (on a Sunday afternoon). That's always nice. It sucks having to wait in line, especially when you're like on a first date and it sucks and you have to make stupid small talk until you get seated then you have to make more small talk while the food comes and what not. Man, fuck first dates. Also, I like the layout. A big ol' square with high ass ceilings and TVs everywhere so you can catch your favorite sportsball game. The food was good, too. Their menu is so damned large, though. Fortunately, they have a small ""healthy"" section so it was easy to pick something. I got the bison burger. Thing was damned delicious. I can see why all the white people hunted the shit out of them back in the day. It's a damned shame they're near extinct because they're way better than cow."
Mark V.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,,5.0,8/27/2017,"A special shout out to Will! Thank you for you expertise,  and patience with us!  The food was amazing! Thank you for making my Moms first time one she'll remember!   Will definitely recommend to family and friends! Five Stars"
Donna C.,"San Diego, CA",7,2,,1.0,3/5/2017,"How hard can an online order, paid in full, be to process?  After being promised a pick up time of 12:45, I arrived on time to the ""pick up"" counter. Two hostesses standing across the way ignored me. I approached their desk and said I was there to pick up a takeaway order. Oh, the pick up window is closed this time of day (noon? Really?) you'll have to pick up at the bar. The bartender says oh no, you'll have to go back to the hostess counter. The hostess says the manager will be right with you at the takeaway counter. The manager says they are preparing my order. It was the wrong order. I showed them my receipt. Another manager appeared. The order is still incomplete. I show him my receipt again. I walked away one hour after the promised time.  5 people to do the job. Shameful."
Jay W.,"San Diego, CA",2,23,15,2.0,11/30/2016,"First off, if the food wasn't so good here and I didn't live so close I probably wouldn't come back. The service from some of the staff is extremely lacking to the point I avoid sitting in some areas. The last visit I went in a little later in the night, around 9:30-10pm and the service was horrible. I sat at the bar and it seemed like the bartender was more concerned on cleaning up early than asking if we wanted a drink or a menu.. If I want the food I tend to order take out now.. Hope management improves some of the st"
Victoria C.,"San Diego, CA",51,1,,1.0,8/23/2017,"Recently went to BJ's Restaurant and ordered the pizza, what a waste of money. No cheese to speak of, it was more dough than anything  else!! I like the salads but will not be ordering pizzas there again."
Emma C.,"Woodland Hills, Woodland Hills, CA",212,12,,5.0,8/12/2017,Woooo came here for a last minute dinner plan for my friends birthday and both hosts and servers treated us very well and sweet. Made sure we were all doing ok! At one point we had two servers at our table checking on us! It was great! Felt like royalty!!!! Shout out to Bridget! Awesome server! Thank you for making our trip to San Diego amazing
Gee L.,"San Diego, CA",33,3,,5.0,6/23/2017,"Lunch was really good! We ordered the lunch special- I got the soup and salad (which is endless!) and my friend got the half club sandwich. There was some sort of mixup in the kitchen where we got our entrees first, and then the salad came over, but our server, Jason, was genuinely apologetic and cut our check in half. It was a really nice gesture and we sincerely appreciated the effort he made to make up for the delay."
Tim A.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,2,2.0,8/15/2017,"Not impressed with BJs brew house. Worst artichoke dip, Caesar salad, and BBQ ribs I've ever had. I couldn't even taste the sauce under the burned exterior. The drinks sucked and we sat here for 2 hours and only saw the server 3 times. We definitely won't be coming back. Major disappointment. Save your time and money. Go somewhere else."
Cheryl Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,3.0,11/1/2017,"Ive always loved BJs but man, this one can be really slooooow. Also, their pizza doesn't impress me.. something is off about them. I can't put my finger on it but the dough isn't as good as the other BJs I've been to. Still, I would recommend this place if you aren't in a hurry."
Max S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,1,1,1.0,7/31/2017,"Terrible service, nasty food, and uninviting atmosphere. Took us 20 minutes just to get menus and water on a Monday night. The server kept avoiding us, forgot orders multiple times and we had to wait over an hour for food to finally show up. I put my order in first, and then the waiter left and didn't come back for 20 minutes. By the time we all ordered my food was delivered and I had to sit there watching my food get cold for the next 45 minutes. Food was bland, yet overly spiced or sweet. Drinks were too sweet to swallow. At one point a yelling match broke out between the table near us and their waiter, completely ruining the mood. Come here if you like bad food, terrible service and if you enjoy starving for hours while you wait."
Dorothy B.,"San Diego, CA",31,33,7,5.0,11/19/2016,"Service and food quality are completely consistent every time me and my husband come here. The drinks are always good, but be careful of ordering something too sweet. I prefer the Oasis Amber beer they make and currently, there is an amazing holiday drink called blood orange pomegranate sangria. It's made with whiskey, merlot, and garnished with a cinnamon stick.  For appetizers, the stuffed mushrooms are our go-to. They are delectable, drizzled with a green herb garlic sauce. The traditional bone-in wings are light and crispy served for 2.  The ahi salad and bison burger are really flavorful. The cole slaw was subpar, but desert is always great. I suggest getting an ice cream float made with their homemade sodas. I highly recommend this location!"
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,4.0,6/20/2015,"Stopped here after a long day at a conference. My coworkers and I sat in the patio during happy hour. Initially, it took someone a long while to come and clean the table or even say hello. Once we got a server, we ordered up. He suggested certain foods and mostly everything came out on time, hot, and tasty. The avocado eggrolls  and spinach and artichoke dip was good. I ordered a thin crust veggie pizza for the first time and it was tasty as well. My coworkers had the Caesar salad specially made with mostly kale and the bbq chicken salad (I believe).  Drinks were good. I ordered a drink inspired by one of the employees. It was half pina colada with blended strawberries in it. Whatever the name, it was very good! Our server was pretty friendly and made us laugh too. I forgot his name, but he had a distinctly twisted and curled up mustache which reminded me of the little Monopoly guy."
