Marques A.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",89,78,47,5.0,10/16/2016,We had a team event at this location and they gave us world class service.  One person handled our logistics and another served our event. Their were zero hiccups for an event with over 30 people.  Some of the guests within my party were needy and this didn't rattle the server one bit. He was able to handle every request and made it look effortless. This is a great place to have informal gatherings.
Cam J.,"San Diego, CA",85,3,,1.0,2/24/2017,"I've lived in San Diego for a year and have always driven past this restaurant, saying to myself ""I've never been there, I need to go try it!"" Well a few nights ago, I did just that. My friend and I went on Wednesday night, where they apparently were doing some kind of $10 burger night, so it was BUSY. The hostess at the front told us there would be a 15 minute wait if we wanted a table, but any seating at the bar was free for the taking. Amazing, we didn't have to wait for a table! I was wrong. We promptly perused the bar area for seating and found a booth that was being cleared, cleaned, and set up. So we swooped in and sat down. Not even a second later, a host comes up behind us and very rudely says, ""Uhh... I was saving this booth for someone else...."" to which I replied, ""Well the girl at the front told us it was open seating at the bar, so we decided to take the next booth."" That didn't seem to mull over well with him, because he didn't say a word. Anyway, about 30 seconds later, we find another booth a little further down and decided to sit there. Upon sitting, I just happened to glance over at the host station, where the host who so rudely spoke to us, was pointing us out, rolling his eyes, and the hostess girl joining in and shaking her head. I mean, come on, we all know how to complain about customers, and it isn't in plain view. If I wasn't already annoyed, I was at that point... After looking over the menu, we decided to order one of their $10 burger specials of the night. I ordered the Portobello Swiss Burger, medium-well. When I received the burger, it was bright pink in the middle. I'm not the type to complain, so I just dealt with what I was given. But as soon as I bit into the burger, I was overwhelmed with salt. Now, I'm a smoker, so usually I can't taste that much saltiness, but WOW... this was insane. I can only imagine what it would have tasted to someone who doesn't smoke... Yuck. So after some inspection of the burger and trying to figure out WHY it was so salty... I discovered it was the portobello mushroom caps. I just can't understand why in the hell someone would salt a mushroom cap THAT much... Makes no sense. So I ripped apart my burger, piece by piece, and decided STILL... that I would not complain... until now. I walked into this restaurant with an extremely open mind, having never been here before, but the rude staff and whatever the hell that damn kitchen staff (cooks, expos, whatever) are doing... it's going to cause people like me to leave a terrible review about terrible service and terrible food. If you're wanting burgers, I honestly suggest you go to In-N-Out. Surprisingly enough, their food is less salty and more cooked through than here at BJ's."
Jason S.,"Horsham, PA",15,10,4,4.0,1/16/2017,Ribs were falling of the bone good. The tomato soup was also pretty good. Mash potatos are a little dry.
Art C.,"San Diego, CA",77,48,12,3.0,11/9/2016,"I've eaten at BJ's all over the country and this review will be a culmination of those visits. If you've been to one of them, you've been to all of them. I will be highlighting this location since it was the latest BJ's I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Location: BJ's is located off of Frazee Road near Barnes and Nobles. I've come here during lunch and dinner and each time wasn't too busy. Plenty of tables both inside and outdoors. A lot of bar space as well if you want to watch the games or enjoy happy hour. You shouldn't have a problem with parking either. 8/10 Service: The service has always been spot on at this location. Our server (whoever it may be) was very helpful and had impeccable timing when we needed something. The food always came out within 15-20 minutes and the drinks came quicker than you can say ""LETS GO LAKERS"". Some of the best service I've experienced at a chain restaurant. 9/10 Happy hour: This is usually when I come here. Their happy hour runs from 3p-7p Monday- Friday and 10p- close Sunday- Thursday. Half off mini pizzas, dollar off your beer, and 2 bucks off appetizers. Not bad for a HH but then again, whose gonna say no to BOGO mini pizzas? 7/10 Food: The menu at BJ's covers anything you would want. They are known for their pizza but they also have plenty of other choices you can pick from. The last time I came here I ordered a Classic Cheeseburger w/ french fries and an order of the fried calamari. The burger wasn't anything special but I keep my tastes simple when I drink beer. The calamari was ok. The breading flakes off and there are only a few big pieces of squid. Again tho, simple tastes when I partake in the game of drink. 6/10 Drinks: BJ's is well known for their craft beer. I have enjoyed their Jeremiah Red for as long as I been drinking. It's an Irish style ale with a refreshing, fruity bite. I used to get pitchers of this beer... ahhh the good old days. They also offer their version of a hefeweizen which will quench your thirst. 8/10 This restaurant got 3/5 stars from me because there simply isn't anything ""special"" about BJ's. Yes they have great craft beer and decent food but nothing on the menu leaves me craving more of it. Overall, good place to watch a game and have a few dollar-off-beers."
Ben P.,"San Diego, CA",534,70,126,5.0,11/8/2016,"Had a fantastic time with my family celebrating my birthday!! The deep dish pizza was delicious, the salmon plate and Cesar salad was very yummy! Also a great surprised happy birthday treat! Thank you very much for a wonderful night and time I'm able to spend with my family."
Nicolas M.,"San Diego, CA",10,31,,1.0,8/10/2016,"The food was good. The service was absolutely aweful! The waitress (Christine) was the worst I've ever seen! Didn't bring any ustensils! No plates for the pizza. Was not polite at all and almost aggressive. Didn't offer any refill for coke and water (had to ask 3 times) Brought 2 tiny bread bites to the table for a party of four. Long service, kitchen forgot to remove Jalapenos from my burger. For no reason, the waitress decided to give our table to another waiter, Justin, which was much better. I rarely leave bad comments on Yelp, but I had to for this one! Will not be back, and will tell all friends not to go unless something's done."
Tiffany A.,"San Diego, CA",679,384,526,4.0,4/18/2015,"Good food and venue!  Still always compare it the first BJ's in SD that I went to in La Jolla (still there, but so small).   Glad to be able to enjoy the same great food, and have more space to enjoy with.   Good size bar and some really nice outdoor area, although when I ate here they weren't using all the outdoor area, maybe on busier nights.  Great central area of SD.  Parking immediately outside the restaurant is not a large lot, but there's plenty of parking throughout the rest of the strip mall.   I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like here... wings, pizza, salad, soups and pazookie's... all gooid!"
Joel N.,"San Diego, CA",3,18,39,5.0,5/20/2017,"Tried the new chicken Barbacoa...delish! Came with brown rice, black beans, cilantro, fire roasted salsa, and feta cheese...super bomb! And actually healthy on top of it...would recommend!"
Cynthia P.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,2.0,2/23/2017,We were at a paint bridal shower and the waitress names Gabrielle stole the sash from the bride to be. The their Aka Gabrielle apparently thought it was phone that stealing from the obvious bridal shower was appropriate. Gabrielle was a good server by the way. Cody the manager was notified and attempted to apologize from Gabrielle aka the thief regarding this matter. I understand a sash is nothing but it's the principle of the matter. I am disappointed that Cody the manager did not do anything about the matter. Gabriel was laughing at the fact that this occurred and did not apologize.  Anyone that comes to bj's she should be fired as this is an embarrassment to your company.
Jeneva C.,"San Diego, CA",10,134,85,1.0,4/14/2017,"No wonder this location has so many horrible reviews. We came in here because we were waiting for our movie to start. Man did we make the wrong choice. From the moment we were seated we had nothing but crappy service. Our server or whatever you would call him was the worst server I honestly had ever encountered. Our drink order wasn't even taken for over 10 minutes. And when we had asked for someone to help us, he had the nerve to argue with us when he came to the table about how long we even sat there. We ordered at the same time. Food was dropped off by other people and again he, Bryan was yet to be seen. I literally had to raise my hand and get someones attention just to get some damn refills. So now we're done 30 mins later and dude has still yet to even look our damn way. I saw a guy in a button up at the cpu so I called him over and low and behold he was the manager Cody.. So I proceeded to tell him the entire situation and asked for my check. He basically gave me a fake apology and that was it.. he brought me the bill and didn't even take a 5 cent discount off. No wonder the service was so bad even the manager was super sub par. I swear I was appalled that I had this bad of a time at bjs which I love bjs and have even become a regular at the other location. Great job Cody and Bryan you all just cost bjs long term customers to never want to return!"
Jordan C.,"San Diego, CA",210,9,,2.0,7/4/2017,"First time doing carry out.....last time as well. Forgot the side of mash potatoes, forgot the gravy, forgot the sides of ranch and BBQ. Food  was ok"
Anita W.,"San Diego, CA",40,25,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Generally, I don't review franchised restaurants only because it's more about the ""cha-ching"" than about the quality of food. But last nights meal with my boyfriend (aka date night) was incredibly underwhelming and to simply put it, the equivalent to really bad sex. Now, if I can preface my review, service wasn't bad at all. Our servers were fantastic, but the cook that night didn't any f**ks and it showed in the food.  We started off with the calamari, which was ehhh. Marinara was a tad bland but manageable. Side note: I think at that point, we should've just called it quits. My boyfriend is all about the pizzas, regardless of where we go. He's a self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur, so he got the deep dish sausage pizza and I had the BBQ bison burger. Now the last time I was there, I organized a work function hosted by BJ's and they complete delivered; food was bomb! My bf has never been to a BJ's so when I told him about my work function they hosted, he was excited.  Chicago natives would started a riot at the pathetic sight of the deep dish pizza that was served. I'm talking about doughy, thick, bland sausages, with a splash of cheese and a sprinkle of tomato sauce. We should've just picked up a Mama Celeste and asked the cook to heat up the oven. Cue my meal: I had asked for a side of fries with my burger since it only came with coleslaw. Now, when I usually order a burger, I'm asked how would I like it cooked. Didn't happen tonight and that should've been a red flag. My burger looked so sad; saturated in BBQ sauce, thin slice of emaciated lettuce, sprinkle of what looked like pico de gallo (not really sure about the connection there), and what thought I was suppose to be coleslaw but in turn was a pile of cabbage....THATS IT! I flagged down the server and asked if there was suppose to be a dressing. Looking kind of embarrassed, he comes back with a vinaigrette??? Huh????? I'm so confused at this point. Isn't coleslaw suppose to be creamy??? Not tangy!?  So disappointed. We had left overs but there was no way in hell I was letting that crap take up space in my fridge. Maybe the cook was having a bad night, I really don't know. But if he was, he definitely took it out on the food (and customers) he was serving."
Erin B.,"Lakeside, CA",4,18,2,1.0,8/8/2016,"Ok, I'm not one to write many reviews... But I have given this particular Bj's so many tries.  I prefer Grossmont's location better because the staff is pleasant, however this one is closer to my house and I decided to give it another shot. The previous times I have come to this location I have noticed that the servers are rude and rarely come to your table.  Well last night was no different. I went with a friend to get pizookies. Mine came back raw... (Yes I understand there is an element of raw to this dessert...) However, this was way too raw to enjoy. And of course since my server didn't come back to ask if we were enjoying our dessert we had to flag down another server to ask if we could have another one. When the new pizookie came it was just as raw as the first one. When the server (I believe it was ""CAMERON P"" the name of the server on my receipt) came back.. Instead of asking if it came back to my liking, she handed me the bill. Even though my pizookie was obviously not being eaten. Though I wanted to complain and ask for another one or a manager, I had already spent too much time, my friend had finished hers and I wasn't going to wait for another uncooked cookie.  This is the last time I will go to this Bj's. The staff doesn't seem to care about customer service. Not to mention the prices are $1-$2 more.  4 strikes. You're out!"
Taura G.,"San Diego, CA",5,81,12,2.0,4/22/2017,We went after a comedy show last night. Got there at like around 9:30pm I'd say...but we only waited about 10min to be seated. The review is for my Honey Crispy Chicken Salad I ordered. It came and there was no honey on the crispy chicken at all...a bit of a disappointment. Maybe next time it will be better.
Walker S.,"San Diego, CA",13600,511,2167,2.0,1/8/2017,"I was ill two days after eating here.  Terrible reduced quality since last visit.  Very bad experience being sick, especially after spending $40.  It started with me sending back the iced tea and asking for water.  Never happened before, anywhere.  Then the tomato bisque soup arrived with a sheen of oil.  I tried it and asked my wife to try it.  Did not have the heart to send it back; I just pushed it aside.  Finally my entry, ""crispy, hand-breaded, buttermilk fried chicken breast, pepper cream gravy and white cheddar mashed potatoes with a corn and fire-roasted red pepper succotash.""  I ate it.  Big mistake.  48 hours of sick.  But two starts for BJ's being a sports bar, TV's everywhere, sports not CNN or FOX.  Loud conversations with the room designed to amplify the noise.  Folks at the next booth over had to shout to be heard.  Two stars if you want to sample several kinds of beer.  But trust me --- do not order off the menu.  If you are hungry go somewhere else."
Jean G.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,1,3.0,6/20/2017,"My first time here and I loved all the food and beer options. Our service on the other hand was terrible from start to finish. The male host who greeted us was unfriendly and not very welcoming. We sat in the ""happy hour"" bar section where our service got worse. Our waitress was extremely inattentive and too busy hanging out with her coworkers to pay attention to us. Three of us needed refills and watched her walk past us twice and not ask us how we were doing.  I am going to give this place one more try strictly for the menu."
Melissa D.,"San Diego, CA",1,51,,2.0,11/13/2016,"I love this place but the service in the bar area is horrible. It takes for ever for a server to come up to you & take your order & I asked a couple if anybody was sitting at the table next to them cause there were beer glasses all over & they said no so I sat down. It took at least 6-8 minutes for a server to come up to me & I had to ask for the glasses to be cleared & the table was dirty & he brought my drink back but never wiped the table which was disgusting so I asked for the table to be wiped & he gave me attitude. The couple that was sitting next to me said there table was never wiped either, they just moved over the glasses & put them on a different table cause there was no service. That is wrong that customers should have to ask for  common sense tasks to be done by the waiters. That is disrespectful & they need to more aware of when tables are dirty & need to clear off the dirty dishes before customers sit down. While I was there, there were at least 3 other couples that had to wait for service on cleaning tables.  I will give this place another try but the service needs to be way better & the happiness from the workers towards the customers need to improve a lot."
Deniz A.,"San Diego, CA",29,304,12,5.0,2/4/2016,"The place has great interior, great vibe; but more importantly: GREAT SERVICE!! Eric, our server took really well care of us. Fast, efficient and quick are the best keywords that describe my personal experience. The drinks are mouth watering, and they have usually always a deal going on for them."
John M.,"Encanto, San Diego, CA",11,1,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Came in after work with my cousin since this location was the nearest. when we entered, the hostess seemed so clueless to the point where I was going to greet and seat her. When we were ordering the server seemed ok until we started off with drinks, I asked for a root beer(soda) and my cousin asked for a beer where the server proceeded to card us both him being 23 and me 20 although I didn't ask for any alcoholic beverage but the server still demanded my ID so I gave it to him only for him to be extremely rude in tone saying ""you're 20 I can't serve you, you're going to get me in trouble"" and he threw my I'd on the table with a foul attitude instead of politely handing it back and stating the obvious, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T request ALCOHOL! my root beer and my cousins beer came anyway after that awkward ordeal and only to feel embarrassed because other guests witnessed this and soon we had the manager watching us for the 10 minutes or so after ordering food, before we just left without even touching our drinks since we felt very disgusted by this servers foul attitude and unnecessary reason to embarrass me and only to have management watching us like we committed a crime. Avoid this location and try the la mesa location or eat elsewhere. We ended up eating at corvettes dinner in Point Loma which was a more satisfying and welcoming experience."
