Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",83,603,431,4.0,12/19/2015,"I've always enjoyed BJ's and was sad when the La Jolla location closed since we live there. The location is big, kind of like the Escondido one. It wasn't too crowded when we came and it was peak dinner time.  Pizza is always good here. My fiancé loves the meat lovers and I like the BBQ chicken.  I actually got the Honey Crispy salad this time and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Great flavor and so fresh!  The wait staff is prompt and friendly. We will be back!"
Amber S.,"Scappoose, OR",51,12,,2.0,5/7/2017,"I've been to this establishment 3 times and each time has been disappointing. Messed up our order and the pizzas are lacking in the amount of toppings. Food is just ok, and over priced. I give two stars because the service was good and atmosphere is good."
Lina S.,"San Diego, CA",5,16,5,1.0,1/1/2017,Went to bjs the other night. The hostess literally just pointed is in a direction and we had to put tables together ourselves because we were a party of 6 people and there were no tables with 6 seats. Then I ordered the salmon with quinoa and there was a LONG BLONDE HAIR in it. This happened when the hostess was right next to me. She said she's rush another order for me. That took 25 minutes. Everyone had finished eating... then my food came. It was ok. The bill came and I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR MY FOOD! Never. Going. To. BJS. Again.
Cait R.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,3.0,5/5/2017,"Too corporate, too expensive, no ambiance, too many items on the menu to have anything really stand out... When you have a 3lb menu with multiple pages you know it's most likely going to be just average food. Cooking too many styles of cuisine at once has never lead to success in my opinion.  Came here twice, 2 beers for $21+tip the first time...yikes. The second time was last night (it's closest bar to the movie theatre) and I spent $21 for 4 sliders, which were average, and calamari which was tough and cold.  Service was nothing special, but I sat at the bar top so it's not a big deal.  Was going to give 2 stars but I'm feeling generous. Plus, I knew what I was getting into when I chose to go to BJ's. Not really the place you go if you're looking for a great experience and amazing food.  Service: C Cleanliness: A+ Food wait time: B- Taste of food: C Location: C"
Olivia M.,"San Diego, CA",21,9,,3.0,4/19/2017,Bjs is pretty good. I came with my niece tonight. And it was ok. I literally think my salad was taken from the fridge and put on my plAte. I've been to this location a few times. But I kinda feel like servers are robots here.  It's kind of annoying.
Da W.,"Lincoln, CA",0,4,,1.0,6/8/2017,"We ate here Monday the 6th of June 2017. The prime rib sandwich was very dry. I did not eat very many of their fry's. The results later back at home were way less than fun and lasted till morning. This will affect my future decision to ever eat there again, especially at that franchise."
Tracy S.,"Santee, CA",304,162,390,4.0,1/14/2015,"Went to the new BJs tonight in mission valley, this place replaced Maria Maria. The restaurant is gorgeous, it had an awesome patio dining area with fire pits and ample seatig. The menu continues to grow, they are way more then a pizza   was hard to decide on an app cause there is a large selection of options. We ended on the spinach artichoke dip. It was tasty and came w plenty of chips, no skimping on the chips which was good. I ordered off the light menu, the new chicken pesto sandwich recommended by the waitress, it was tasty, a bit surprising and a bit heavy on the mayo but it was good. Came w a garden salad that had heavy onions.  Dessert- seriously-  don't even come here unlessyou plan to order pizookie. They keep adding more and more delicous dlavors. A new one was peanut butter s'more but we opted for salted Carmel. End result: LICK the pan, plate, bowl and spoon clean-  it's that good, nothing of a pizookie should go to waste."
Robin S.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/12/2016,"We just moved down to San Diego.  I'd had BJ's in Orlando and the Seattle area and it was good.  BJ's was close to the hotel we were staying at so we figured we'd go for dinner, but we didn't even get to eat.   We sat down, waited about 10 min to be served, no big deal, it gave us time to pick out our food and drinks.  I ordered a soda, my husband a beer.  The drinks came out separately, and the beer took quite a bit longer than the soda -no biggie.  Then we waited for our food... and waited... and waited.  Our waiter never came by to check on us, my guess is he went on break, which is fine, but then someone else should be designated to deliver food.  After much negotiation on putting some money on the table and walking out, our waiter finally came by an hour later and said, ""oh, your food hasn't come yet?""  I asked for our check for the drinks, paid, and we left."
Lisa G.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,13,1,4.0,2/23/2017,"Great service. I was here for a bridal shower. The only issue was an employee Gabrielle stole the bridal sash from the future bride. She said she found it in the bathroom. Really, we clearly were having a bridal party. The manager Cody handled it well. Shame on you Gabrielle!!"
David M.,"El Cajon, CA",25,509,2296,4.0,5/4/2015,""" Great Atmosphere, Good Food, and Good Service ! "" My wife and I met our Daughter and her Husband to celebrate a birthday a BJ's Brew house in Mission Valley last week. The restaurant is very beautiful inside and outside, with an Awesome Bar area, and plenty of TV's to watch your favorite event. Our server Katelynn was so nice and pleasant as she did everything to make us happy. The food was very good. I had a Gluten Free thin crust Pepperoni Pizza and my wife had the delicious Asian Salad. They have a Huge variety of craft beers you can enjoy also. Fun place to for any occasion  Check it out !"
James W.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,1,2.0,8/25/2017,"My wife, mother-in-law, and I were really craving pizza tonight and haven't been to BJ's in awhile.  We were all really disappointing in the hostess and didn't feel she was that friendly and didn't seem like she wanted to be there.   We watched her seat a few other groups and seemed like she gave them similar treatment.  It would have been nice to seen a smile and a little bit of small talk during the long walk to our seat.  We had the Calimari for a starter and it tasted a little tough and slightly burnt.    The waitress was friendly but asked if we wanted dessert when she dropped off my second beer and we still had half a large pizza remaining.  It seems like they were trying to rush us of there and it was only about 70% capacity.  The hoppy IPA beer and ""sweet pig"" pizza were excellent!"
Jimmy K.,"San Diego, CA",199,142,22,3.0,9/5/2016,Just your typical BJ's restaurant. It was a game day for the Chargers and we knew it was going to get busy after the game. Sure enough....it got busy and we waited a while for our poor server to pick up our check. He was great but certainly got pulled pretty thin. They should've had more staff on game day. I had the seared ahi salad which was sooooo good!  Looking forward to eating it again.
Patty R.,"San Diego, CA",46,8,6,3.0,11/25/2016,I love bjs but unfortunately we ordered two chicken alfredos for take out and found a hair in one of the meals. I called and spoke with the manager she offered a refund on the one meal that had the hair. I've worked in the industry and I know that they prepare them together and just split it in two take out boxes.
Maridel A.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",1777,928,1852,4.0,2/26/2015,"Been here 5 or more times in the last month to celebrate promotion, happy hour, farewell lunch, dinner, lunch, happy hour etc. Always great service... I come here for their chicken wings and mini pizza! It's so tasty! Their wings are crunchy with a light buffalo sauce and ranch on them. Their deep dish pizza is so soft and cheesy.  I'm also a fan of their calamari and egg rolls. The egg rolls are only good fresh.. Not a good idea to take home for leftovers. The food here isn't bad at all. It's very fulfilling. I almost never have any left overs cz is that good. The best part is their rewards program!!! Collect points to receive discounts or a free pizookie! come early, they can get really busy during lunch and dinner (6pm). They also serve breakfast/brunch on weekends I think. I Can't wait to try them hungover on a Saturday morning."
Tyler M.,"San Diego, CA",136,7,1,5.0,5/26/2017,"Came here for dinner on a Friday evening with my girlfriend. They sat us right away, no wait time. The host was really nice she let us know about the prime rib special. We order that along with Great White deep dish (was excellent) our server Kimberly was awesome. Super attentive and very informative about the menu. Terrance also made our experience great. Thank you BJs for great service and great food!! We will be back soon :)"
Russ U.,"San Jacinto, CA",341,20,19,1.0,1/16/2017,"Wow where do I even start. We went to San Diego for an evening of getting out of town and having some fun; approx 90 min drive away.  This was our 1st stop to get some dinner and meet up with friends.  We arrived and found easy parking and did what alot of people do after a long drive.  It was approx 9pm and the men's room was just downright gross.  Informed hostess when we checked in. We were seated pretty promptly, so they were good there. Unfortunately, as I started to assault their phone book of a menu, I felt a huge drip on my back (it had been raining/pouring all day and night) and got up to look at the floor and see how wet it was etc; as it was clear to me from the moment the drop hit me where it had come from (a leaky roof).  The hostess came and asked if we wanted to move tables, hah.  I told her ""yea that would be great I don't want to be sitting at the low point of the roof where the water is all pooling when it decides to give in and collapse.  So we moved. Waited about 10 more minutes at new table for waiter to come by.  Clearly either this guy was new, sick, beat from working a long shift, or maybe helping taste test new batches of brew because he was just OFF.  Had to repeat everything, yea it was a lil loud in there, but we all spoke clearly with adequate volume for everyone else at the table to hear.  Wife's drink (tokyo tea) was watery like the ice had melted in the cup before they made the drink; my drink was wrong - lol batting 1000.  We got our orders for food in approx half hour after first being seated at leak table, terrible time conversion but by now they were slow so no urgency to turn the table I guess. Food came out slow, talking nearly 20 min from time of order.  Friends got chicken salads, the chicken was cut into weird chunks.  We have all seen where they cut the chicken into strips for visual appeal, it was not an attempt at that (lol the chicken also had no grill marks); it was just lazily diced too big - they goto bj's often (the destination was their pick not ours) and pointed out the chicken; we would have never known it was ""different"".  Wife got the Parmesan chicken; the chicken was good in the bite I had and she enjoyed it.  Her mashed taters were grainy, old, and dry like they had set a long time.  She didn't bother asking for butter as she was just ""over it"" in general.  My ""late night"" burger came out and I was excited about it, new concept and I love mexican food so I was excited for the chili verrde; and who doesn't like an egg on their burger right?  My burger came out of the kitchen without the fries; which were brought about 4-5 min later.  Well the chili verde must have been as old or older than my wife's mashers cuz it was soooo salty I had her taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy (you know how sauce cooks down and gets all salty?) or someone just did not follow the recipe at all.  The over saltyness rendered the $13 burger inedible.  I told the waiter about the burger and he offered to replace it, cool! In the waiter's defense, he was overall pleasant, and after about 5 min into waiting on my new order, asked if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited.  So another 10 minutes (for a total of 15, my wife and friends were DONE with their meals) my ""bbq brisket burger"" (or whatever they call the brisket topped burger) came out.  If I were Gordom Ramsey I would have summarily tossed the plate on the floor and yelled ""THIS IS STONE COLD"".  The bbq sauce was cold like it just came out of the refrigerator, there was literally 2 TINY morsels of brisket (net less than half an ounce, really), the patty seemed to have been reheated and allowed to cool again.  They were more than generous with the nearly frozen sauce though.  The burger did come out with fries this time on the first shot though, so atleast they got that part right.  I even told the waiter about it being cold, but that I didn't want to waste any more time trying to get something right from ""that"" kitchen. Before I could finish gagging down what I did eat of my burger, the waiter came by with the check and asked us if we could ""please take care of this right away as they are cutting me loose for the night"".  We never did see or have the manager visit our table through this ordeal. I really need to learn to be less accommodating when it comes to stuff like this.  I had wanted to goto Lucha Libre, which is good, and something I can ONLY get in San Diego.  I can go to any BJ's and get sub par food and over priced, warmish ""micro brew"".  I completely had low expectations from the beginning as I have not, and never will utter the phrase ""let's go to BJ's"" but have relented and gone a very few times over the years.  I did get a good burger one time at the one in Riverside, CA.  This was my 5th or 6th time going to a BJ's, there won't be another.  Usually it is just bad food, but the complete total lack of execution, and apparent apathy of the management is enough for me to wash my hands of them."
Brian H.,"Orange County, CA",135,10,16,1.0,7/17/2016,I've never been more disappointed with service. It took us 30 minutes to get someone to take our order...it's been 45 minutes since they took our order and we are still waiting on it to come....the worst thing about it is it's 11am for weekend brunch and there are only like 5 other tables seated and about 20 employees wandering around like they are clueless.
Dylan S.,"Arcadia, CA",455,4,10,5.0,4/16/2017,"Bjs food is always good, but our server was phenomenal. If you get Nieve, you're in for a treat. Down to earth human you'd want to be friends with after!"
Jamie J.,"Long Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Stopped by today for lunch , had to post a review due to the worst service ever !! I've been eating at BJs for years , it's a go to...when In San Diego, fashion valley , skip this restaurant if you're eating on the patio! The waitress is clueless.. brought the salad after after the pizza and gave us the wrong bill.."
Randy A.,"Escondido, CA",44,11,,5.0,12/8/2016,Just ate here last night and ordered the Hickory Brisket & Bacon Burger. It was very good! I also got their rootbeer float which was also very tasty :) The server did a great job as well.
