Chris H.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",109,267,766,1.0,11/6/2015,"I'm updating my 3 star review and lowering it to a 1 star. I gave it a 3 star ONLY because I thought their happy hour was a good deal. They threw that out the window. The changed their happy hour deal from $4 beers to a dollar off. Which comes out to like $5.25. Their beers aren't good enough to be that expensive for a happy hour ""deal."" The food isn't any good, the atmosphere is decent though but the happy hour deal is no longer a deal. No Bueno anymore. I'll find a new spot."
Jordan C.,"Rocklin, CA",0,3,21,2.0,4/16/2017,"For a chain restaurant, I have usually always had a pleasant experience coming here. Today however, it was not a very good experience despite the fact that the NBA playoffs were being played on every TV. Service was very slow but I do not usually take that to heart. I ordered my usual appetizer which is the calamari. its pretty good usually but today it was soggy, the marinara sauce had a film type layer on the top indicating that it has been sitting out for a while, and they gave use ranch instead of the usual lemon garlic aioli. VERY disappointed. I had the grilled mahi mahi tacos for my entre and that was pretty good however. I do not want to name drop our server but he was very slow, never once filled our waters, and had all our empty plates piled up all the way up until we received our bill. Overall, BJs is a great chain restaurant but I do not think I will be returning to this specific location."
Maria A.,"San Diego, CA",47,18,4,1.0,9/13/2016,"This place is good only if you eat in, but you you take your food to go, you get overcharged with everything you order! $3 something for the orange cream soda and the to go cup is half way full! Ridiculous."
Ryan B.,"San Diego, CA",115,153,1,3.0,6/26/2016,"So I only go to BJs when my friends want to go otherwise there are other places I'd choose... That being said, came here a week ago and while the service was good, it was the food that is what downgrades this rating. My friend ordered the jambalaya. So the menu clearly states it comes with sausage. My friend gets the order and there's no sausage and barely any sauc. Then he asks for another order and when it comes out the waiter brings it to my friend and goes, ""I still don't think there's sausage."" Ok.. So why bring it out in the first place if you know the order is wrong?!? At least he got extra I sauce... So The waiter gets the manager and the manager apologizes and a few minutes later brings out some sausage... So you'd think with all those screw ups and the amount of time it took to correct the order he'd get it comped or something... Nope... Nothing..."
Arnel D.,"San Diego, CA",1560,1907,6793,3.0,9/27/2015,Had lunch here and they food was great! The service was so so... First off they brought out the wrong salad for my wife and gave me a soup spoon that had BBQ sauce on it... I ordered clam chowder.  Servers were dropping off food to the wrong tables and everyone in the place seemed pretty upset.   Eventually things got sorted out but by then it was too late.  The food was filling and the dessert was the best!
Joy T.,"San Diego, CA",62,44,32,5.0,8/18/2016,"My teenage son has never been here and today was his first time, great host, great waitress's and great service. Love it!!! Will only come to this one from now on. I went to the Chula Vista one a couple nights ago and the service sucked! Updated 8/18 came with both my boys today our waiter Wayne was amazing as it was starting to get busy he still made sure our drinks were filled!!"
Roxanne L.,"San Diego, CA",40,198,578,4.0,10/6/2015,"This is a decent restaurant to go to, to get something for everyone. The menu has a wide variety of options! The location is convenient for me so I've been here a few times now. The food and service is usually pretty good. I usually get the thyme chicken breasts with brussel sprouts and it's always been delicious."
Linda G.,"San Diego, CA",13,22,,5.0,9/1/2017,"We just had dinner there. We've been many times before. They have the Best California burger Ever & Garlic fries. My husband had the Mango tacos. We also had the Nachos OMG they were great. But the reason I'm writing this review is because of our server CJ. He was the best ever. He taught us more about different beers then I ever thought possible. He was professional, extremely curious & made sure we were very well taken care of.  I was really surprised, because I've never had that kind of service before. I watched as he took care of other customers & he treated everyone the same. I will Highly recommend this place more often & I'm hoping that CJ is there when we go back"
Daniel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,16,3,1.0,12/18/2016,Worst service ever. Dirty silverware and extremely long wait for mediocre food. Horrible
Verry N.,"San Diego, CA",1,27,3,5.0,8/4/2017,Delicious pizza and super fast service even the line outside seems it will take forever
Chris S.,"Bakersfield, CA",76,349,1772,5.0,10/19/2015,Five stars for customer service and attentonby the manager Matt Eastman. Our waitress was also super friendly and gave us great service.  My wedge salad was great as was the steaks and Caesar salad thanks BJs for a wonderful lunch
Tuan T.,"Dallas, TX",694,282,200,5.0,1/10/2017,"I have been here a few times now and I have never once received bad service at this location. All the waiter and waitresses here were very prompt and knowledgeable on the menu. They still have a happy hour during the NFL games which comes in handy if you want happy hour prices. I am really sad over the years that they reduced the level of their happy hours. They have a daily special thing going on now which makes $4 dollar draft days on Wednesday. The place is clean and the bathrooms are pretty nice too. They have screens set up at the bar. Nothing like a buffalo wild wings scale but not bad. Last time I been here, I got my usual of the Jeremiah red ale which is my go-to beer here. It's sweet yet has a good kick at the same time. I had some spaghetti and meatballs which I shared with my wife and they split it for me. I was definitely a happy camper over that. Their shots come in pretty big glasses which is usually too much for me. Their mixed drinks I never found to be really strong although decent so I recommend sticking with shots and beer here."
Lindsy H.,"Allen, TX",429,707,1284,4.0,8/24/2014,"If you've been to one BJ's you've honestly been to them all. This new BJ's is no exception except maybe that it's bigger and more spacious. The parking is nuts, but they do offer valet which is considerate.  They do not take reservations, but we've never had to wait very long, even on busy nights. This BJ's does offer a vast array of televisions seen through the restaurant and the bar area is much larger with more seating.  Just about anything on the menu is good, but my favorite it the classic BJ's BBQ Chicken Pizza and the trio of Pazookies (White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter)."
Man U.,"El Cajon, CA",2,38,33,2.0,5/3/2016,"Came here Thursday April the 28th/16 , Eric ( big long beard ) came to our table with no greeting , asked us if we want something to drink , I did mentioned  to him ( very nicely ) that there were some water on the table and if he could wipe out , and I guess his majesty did not like that , after that his attitude got worse and worse , I really like this place but don't like to be treated like that , might be my last visit there , I had a bad car accident couple days before this and really wasn't in a mood to start anything with anybody ."
Lex F.,"Anaheim, CA",57,30,10,1.0,2/1/2017,"The service at this location sucks. I did a ""din-in order ahead"", no one knew what to do when i arrived. The hostess sat me at a table that wasn't cleaned. After 10 mins, the waitress came out and served me a salad. I asked for utensils, never got them and had to go to the hostess desk to request them. Took me 10 minutes to get a glass of water. They may need training."
Nic J.,"San Diego, CA",13,439,25,2.0,7/1/2016,"I've probably eaten at a BJ's 3x. It's never a place that you wake up craving to eat there, somehow you just kind of end up there, with limited expectations. Like everything else in Mission Valley, it's just chain food w/ no character. I've had their french dip, and most recently their chicken pita tacos (yuck). I recently had a beer here that I thought was decent, ginger IPA.  Service isn't anything special. Also tried their pizookie, which is good, but i've been seeing some restaurants out there put their own twist on that dessert."
Victor P.,"San Diego, CA",6,43,5,5.0,6/8/2017,"I'm typically not a fan of chain restaurants, but I make the exception for BJs since there are healthy options and the food is pretty good. I've been here numerous times but never felt inclined to leave a review until tonight since the service was excellent. Our server Dylan was so attentive... he knew exactly what we wanted/needed even before we asked (i.e. I had ribs and he brought out hand wipes, water cups were always filled, brought out extra marinara for our calamari, put in our pozookie order so it came out minutes after we were done with our meal, etc). I would go so far to say that the service he offered was better than what I would get at a 5 star restaurant like Herb & Wood or Juniper & Ivy. Thank you Dylan!"
S B.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,18,9,5.0,2/11/2017,First timers here... our waitress remembered all of our orders without writing them which was awesome. She was able to give a great recommendation for a drink for our T1 son. Food was great.
Melanie A.,"Fort Collins, CO",1,72,7,5.0,1/5/2017,"I coordinated with management at this location to hold a work party for 25 people. From the start, the service was excellent and the manager was very flexible in letting us plan our menu and the kind of event we wanted. At the event, managers and our server Joe were SUPER hepful. We got the whole back area to ourselves, plenty of all you can eat food, and extra tables for gifts, etc. would definitely recommend for large groups!! They are super organized and committed. Wonderful service and a great experience for all."
Michelle V.,"San Diego, CA",56,107,195,2.0,9/22/2015,"Came here on a Sunday night and was told that wait would be an hour and a half long because they where short staff BUT if we sat outside we wouldn't had to wait. We ended up sitting outside, all squished together, cause the table sat 6 and there where 8 of us.  Anyways we got the deal where it came with an appetizer (salad or soup), medium deep dish pizza and pizookie for $25.  So I got the Caesar salad, worst salad ever. There where barely any dressing and the romaine was soggy, not fresh. And my boyfriend got the broccoli and cheddar soup, it was super salty because they dump a lot of cheddar cheese on top of the thick soup.  Now for the deep dish pizza, we order mushroom and pepperoni which took forever for them to be done with because they made pepperoni and sausage instead. But we weren't told that they had messed up on our pizza and had started all over till 10 mins after our friends had gotten their deep dish. So by the time we got our pizza everyone had finished eating. Didn't enjoy the pizz because the crust was super soggy and super bland.  For the pizookie we got the cookies and cream. It was yummy. It had a brownie at the bottom with vanilla ice cream on top.  Also we tried their calamari, was not impress. It was super dry and brunt. And the mozzarella stickers where good. Perfectly fried. And super cheesy.  Service here could use some improvement. Drinks too forever to get refill. Whenever we needed something there where no waiter/waitress to be seen.  Only thing I liked here was the pizookie."
