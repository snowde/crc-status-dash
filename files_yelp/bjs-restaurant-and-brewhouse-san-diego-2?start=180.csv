M. L.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",0,16,,1.0,2/21/2017,Worst service I've had in a while. When asked if there were any happy hour or specials we were told they started at 3 pm.  Then when 3 o'clock came around we were told sorry today there are no specials. After the the wait for nothing our order came out wrong. When we finally got our food I was beyond starving and it still didn't taste that good. I've been to other Bj's restaurants before but the service is pretty bad at this location
Mailman y.,"San Diego, CA",0,48,,1.0,7/16/2017,"Went with a group of 5 @ 11pm.We ordered drinks,pizza and another appetizer. Service was pathetic , our food was delivered cold after 50 minutes and multiple reminders.I wouldn't bother to visit this place again.Atleast not so late."
Peter S.,"Superior Charter Township, MI",13,13,14,3.0,7/4/2016,About what you'd expect from a chain Micro-Brew restaurant.  I've seen many complaints about the service but our server (Loralai I believe) was attentive and while she didn't deliver the food other servers ran it out in a timely fashion.  She was attentive with drink orders and extra requests like more Buffalo Wing sauce for the wings.  Her service was excellent. The food is standard bar food.  Neither amazing or horrible.  We had the pizza and wings but I've been there before for other menu items.  It's a nice place to sit and socialize while having a beer and some food but there are other places that are better if you're looking for a memorable meal.
Brett M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,98,36,4.0,7/15/2016,"Bison burger was outstanding and comes with a nice salad for $12.00.  What a great deal because you get a nice sized burger, that is on the healthy side, and it comes with a side salad.   For those that want a healthy burger this a great way to go."
Arslan V.,"San Diego, CA",203,157,22,5.0,7/30/2016,We celebrated my best friends birthday here. The waiter guys are AMAZING! Very friendly gentlemans. A specially food was great and many tipes of drinks. Thanks guys for good service and having a great time here.  Highly recommended!!
James P.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/23/2017,"The service here was OK.  We had 5 people at our table and 3 of us got horribly sick later that night. I am talking uncontrollable vomiting, cramps and epic mud-butt. One of them ended up at the ER as she has other conditions that were aggravated by this. Nothing like paying for over priced frozen food and getting sick as a result. Something  is wrong at this location other BJs are not this bad. I am looking at you management...."
Latoya O.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",0,11,3,1.0,7/14/2017,I just ate here and had pretty bad service my order was wrong my husbands food had a bunch of seasoning dumped on top. we had no silverware or napkins after are wrong food came. My husband asked for another margarita they forgot to bring it to the table by the time they did all the ice melted and the drink was watered dow we asked for desert to go the brought it to the table to eat there instead of a Togo box.. the waiter seemed like he had a  attitude because we sent it back... I'll probably never eat there again.
Ruby H.,"San Diego, CA",145,38,1,1.0,3/17/2016,"DON'T GO HERE!! I found a huge bug in my salad! (I posted a picture of it) The staff was nice enough to remake everything from scratch with new ingredients and comped my meal and gave me a free dessert but still, I would probably just avoid this place in general."
Arianna W.,"Vista, CA",19,124,3,4.0,11/30/2016,"Here for an IGDA  meet up, and the staff is so understanding! They took our orders by name and ended up serving the equivalent of at least 10 tables at once. Same old BJ's food, but I'm just glad their staff is so helpful!"
Dennis P.,"Escondido, CA",707,125,579,1.0,4/12/2015,"I usually have no issues at any of the BJ's locations, but this one really disappointed me.  Take a look at the Ahi Poke I ordered togo. If it's a togo order I really don't mind if the presentation isn't up to par, but this pic was taken right when I got in the car.  There is more lettuce than there are chips and ahi! The poke didn't even come with the sauce it is supposed to come with and there is barely any avocado.  I don't understand the employee who prepared this and thought to him/herself that this was acceptable. This one employee is a representation of this BJ's location and BJ's as a corporation.  This review isn't to express my anger, it's to better your customer service and product. If this location and big wigs at headquarters cared...they would make some changes...if they really cared, but it looks like these reviews get unanswered and over looked."
Jen R.,"San Diego, CA",187,88,116,4.0,8/29/2015,"Terrific place to dine at before heading out to a Charger game (if you are taking the trolley to go to the stadium).  Great atmosphere, yummy food, and friendly service! ATMOSPHERE: Open seating around the upper bar area and patio instead of waiting on the guest list for a table in the lower dining area.  Plus there are plenty of TVs in the open seating areas if you are a sports fan. FOOD: On a hot day, order the Watermelon and Feta Salad!  With the sweetness of the watermelon and the saltiness of the feta cheese, this unique pairing compliments each other so well!  So refreshingly delicious, I wouldn't mind eating 3-4 servings of this salad! Deep dish pizza here is legit.  I'm not a deep dish pizza fan because there is too much crust and bread involved, but BJ's version made me actually like theirs.  The crust is golden and crisp, and the bread base is fluffy and light.  I ordered the Gourmet Five Meat pizza (mini size) because I'm a meat lover pizza kind of gal.  The mini portion will feed 1-2 people.  My friend and I ate two slices each and were getting pretty full. Have a small appetite?  Try the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms filled with BJ's spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, drizzled with a zesty lemon pesto sauce.  Nice little bites to snack on. SERVICE: Our server, Jennifer H, was super nice and friendly.  She had given us her personal experience on the food we selected when she was taking our order. She lett us know we are in for a wonderful treat.  And... she was right!  The food was very tasty!  She also came by frequently to make sure if we needed anything, checked on our food order (when we were waiting) and refilled our drinks.  She provided excellent service.  Thank you, my fellow Jen! CONS: 1.) The menu is like a novel.  A heavy book with so many pages of food and drink choices.  It was overwhelming trying to figure out what to eat (pizza, sandwich, burger, pasta, specialty entrees, salads, and the list going on forever it seems).  My friend had to take a few minutes to really figure out what we were hungry for. 2.) It took a bit of time to receive our food and drinks.  Probably because the kitchen has so many different kinds of food to make for their customers.  However, our server Jen was awesome proactively checking up on our order periodically without us having to ask. FINAL THOUGHTS: I think this is my new favorite pre-gaming spot before I head over to Qualcomm stadium for an event or Charger game for some great tasty bites. But I'll make sure to give a bit more time for eating so that we are not late to any events. ;)"
Laura O.,"El Cajon, CA",0,10,,5.0,1/16/2017,Good news and bad news found plastic in my soup good news Zack the waiter got the manager right away and Cody the on shift manager offered me a new dish and desserts. Apologies to me about the situation and took it all off the bill excellent service. So although my meal was kinda ruined the service was by far out standing and quick and responsible. Will be back for a second go.
Nicholas N.,"San Diego, CA",1,33,99,1.0,1/16/2017,Aweful food service everything. Sad part is I love me some BJs have been eating there since 2012. This location has been on a steady decline since about 2015. Last experience confirmed this location off my list for good. Lazy Dog way better than BJs.
Cody S.,"San Diego, CA",134,119,285,2.0,4/15/2015,"I love deep dish pizza and I love breweries, so BJ's seemed like a match made in heaven! Unfortunately the first two times I went here I left pretty disappointed. The pizza was thick, but it was also bland, soggy and seemed kind of old. The appetizer of avocado egg rolls, despite having fresh avocado, fell along the same lines. Something was off but I couldn't place my finger on it. The next time I went was after a Charger's game and decided to skip the pizza, ordering a chicken sandwich. Yet again, I got a lack of flavor and the chicken seemed kind of rubbery. The saving grace of the meal was the Pizookie, a fresh baked-to-order cookie that is topped with ice cream. It's super indulgent and easily their best offering. The PIzookie was tasty but what made the entrees so lifeless and boring? I finally learned the truth while mentioning my experiences to a friend that used to work at one. Nearly everything is FROZEN and reheated. Where some chain restaurants like the Cheesecake Factory may be gluttonous but prepare everything fresh, BJ's pulls everything out of a bag and sticks most in a microwave. Very little is done on-site and the flavor shows it. I'm definitely done ordering meals here, but craft beer and a freshly baked cookie may still do the trick during an occasional game."
bzribee b.,"San Diego, CA",0,61,,3.0,6/30/2017,"This was my first visit.  I went with a small group of friends.  BJ's has a very lengthy menu and it was Happy Hour and quite noisy, but we were seated quickly and our waitress was great.  I got the ""New Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa  Bowl"" which I thought was absolutely delicious.  My friends got some Starter Salads (Portabello/Asparagus and Twisted BLT) and liked those very much.  We also got various Small Bites which were not as well received.  First, they are much smaller than the menu pictures would have you think.  The Garlic Parmesan Roasted Carrots were very good but hardly worth $4.95.  The Roasted Golden Beets were good and the Turmeric Roasted Cauliflower was okay--all had more spices (heat) than some of my group expected.  We all hated the Sauteed Garlic Spinach Kale which was none of those:  barely any greens noticeable, no garlic and mostly cabbage, carrots and vinegar?  It tasted more like a warm German Cole Slaw than the yummy sauteed garlic spinach dish we were expecting (like you'd get in a Thai, or Italian restaurant).  Other than the vinegar (?) it had no real flavor and was very, very disappointing and nothing like the menu description.  I would name it Flavorless Steamed Cabbage with Teeny Bits of Other Colors.  DON'T get it.  We tried the Lentil Soup which didn't have much flavor, either.  It was quite thick which we would've liked if it had flavor. Our waitress was great with us but didn't really check back with us for refills, corrections, so on.  That would've been appreciated.  I think we came at a shift change but a little more attention from someone would've been appreciated.  Still, she was patient and helpful when around. I would go again but would avoid the Small Bites and soup."
Jaelene A.,"Wilmington, CA",0,6,2,5.0,9/17/2016,"This isn't my first time at this location with my husband, but I will say that this has been our best experience here so far. The ambiance of this restaurant and the timely seating are amazing. But today, we decided to sit in the bar section and I'm glad we did. Our waiter, JD, has been beyond amazing. He checks in with us at the perfect times and we've never had to wonder where he's disappeared to. His service is excellent and he's definitely a people person. Thanks for everything JD!"
Jen F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/12/2017,"If I could give 0 I would. coworkers and I walked in, the hostess suggested we sit at the bar so I go to a table that needs to be cleaned. We wait for 10 minutes 2 waiters ignore us. I ask to be seated in an open booth in the regular seating section. We proceed to be ignored by that waiter. We weren't even asked what we wanted to drink. He takes orders from the table behind us and the table to the side of us who had already been served what looked like appetizers and drinks, then finally takes ours. My coworker didn't even use her utensils because she thought the place was dirty. She asked for plastic utensils. Waiter never came to check on us after ordering. Won't ever be back!!!! Horrible!"
Timmy P.,"Chula Vista, CA",112,51,303,2.0,3/12/2015,"First of all food was great as always can never go wrong with the Sweet Pig deep dish.  Food was warm and flavorful as always.   My 2 stars is for horrible service.  We seated our self at the top bar section and it took 10 mins for someone to come over and decide they wanted to help us.  The first person brought us drinks, the next person brought us menus.  When our waiter came and asked us if we were ready to order he squatted down and started tapping on the table as to say hurry up or something, it was very awkward. After we ordered he left and never came back so whenever we needed something we had to ask random people walking by.  I asked one girl twice to refill my Pepsi before finally asking someone else who took 5 mins to grab it.  When our original waiter did comeback he just left the check and took off didn't even bother asking if we wanted anything else.   It was my first time as this BJ's location as im usually at the one in grossmont but after that service I wouldn't bother going back 2 stars for the food, 0 for service"
Albertine F.,"San Diego, CA",881,225,191,2.0,3/15/2015,"I'm basing this rating on the deep dish pizza because let's face it, that's what they're known for. We ordered the chicken ranch deep dish.  It was a joke. There was so much crust and so little toppings! It was mostly bread and the bottom wasn't even good and crunchy... It was doughy and the chicken was very dry. Such a great disappointment.  And to seal the rating, they were out of spinach stuffed mushrooms. I had the tomato and mozzarella salad to start, which was good, and the atmosphere and service were fine."
Jennifer L.,"Essex, MD",1,17,,4.0,7/18/2017,"Good selection is good, GF options...our dessert was delivered to the wrong table....which was a bummer because we were on a tight time frame. ..our server was delightful but the food runner...not so much on it..."
