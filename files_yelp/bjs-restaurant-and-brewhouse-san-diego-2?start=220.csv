Ariel M.,"Granite Hills, San Diego, CA",84,93,36,5.0,1/12/2016,"I LOVED this visit!  great atmosphere, friendly staff members, and amazingly good food. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs as my entree and cheese sticks for my appetizer, with a couple of drinks, and all of it tasted awesome! The tequila sunrise was strong(much needed!), but tasty at the same time. My second drink was the California moscato, and I loved how light and fruity it was. The cheese sticks were high quality, not like string cheese that was just fried, but real mozzarella goodness. The spaghetti and meatballs had a unique flavor that I really enjoyed, with spices and sweet tomatoes complementing each other perfectly. Our server was perfect for the occasion, and he did really well at his job. Honestly, every staff member I encountered was pleasant and accommodating, which I always appreciate. I left feeling more than satisfied, and impressed."
Kshyne W.,"San Bernardino, CA",6,66,84,1.0,7/25/2016,"Visited this location because my husband and I were feeling celebratory since our last of 3 children committed to protecting the freedoms of this country via serving in the United States Navy at 17yrs old! Tomorrow she's off to Great Lakes for Bootcamp so we decided on happy hour for a couple drinks and a little food to seal the evening! Well everything was ok until our waitress Dana M. forgot to put in my mini deep pizza order!!! My husband and daughter's food came out at a reasonable time but we waited over 30 mins for mine after there's came out!!!!  Dana M. came to the table and asked ""are you still waiting on your pizza"" I said yes! She comes back and said it was burnt and it was gonna be another 3 mins which turned out to be another 10 to 13 mins!! I told her when she bring the pizza out to also bring the check and a box because my family was completely done eating and ready to go!!! She (Dana M.) didn't offer any apologies or anything!! And on top of that we still had to pay for it!!! I would have asked for a manager but I didn't want to further dampen our last evening together for a while with more negativity and upset! However I was highly pissed! Dana M wasn't as pleasant as one would expect a server to be and our overall experience was less than favorable!  BTW it was happy hour and it wasn't even extremely busy where one could possibly forget an order! Smh what a mess and a waste of our valuable and precious time with our daughter!"
Savanah S.,"San Diego, CA",447,27,46,4.0,10/5/2016,"Came for free pizookie day so granted the server was stressed but still lacked personality kinda like we were inconvenient to him...we even ordered a full meal not just came in for a pizookie! But the food was good, so 4 stars for that. Deep dish ziti!! Get it!"
Joel C.,"El Cajon, CA",13,85,,3.0,12/5/2016,I wanted to find good good places to have hamburgers yet many places haven't been able to make and cook correctly when I came to BJ's there was allot of people for lunch so this told me that there food and service was very good.The wait wasn't very much I had requested an Inside table the host greeted me very nicely and asked me was this my first time at BJ's I  told it was she very welcoming and seated to a clean table and said the server would here soon.     It gave me a few minutes to through and check out there menue which was very confusing and so full of things so I had to go through all sections very carefully so I wouldnt miss the specials.The server came over he name was rob I asked whats good on the menue he directed me to many things.So I found the things that I wanted to try so I tried the BJS cheese burger with bacon and cheader cheese and the the shoe string french fries.     I asked to drink a coke and the food order came over in about thirty minutes the food presentation was very good on the plate the burger had a good grilled smell to it Rob who was the main cook and head chief at the location so he came and checked on me personally and the presentation and preperation.The only thing I had to speak with him about is teh size of there french fries they are very thin in size when Rob told me this I was very surprised I was expecting some thing of bigger fries.     With the location of the restaurant it makes a very good location with many other things in the mall and with the theater close by in the mall and you have Starbucks close by so if you like some after dinner coffee its a very good locattion right next to BJ's.With very good food and service and you will have a great night with the restaurant but to the restaurant managers shorten down the the menue that customers will be understsand it.
Bob H.,"Corona, CA",0,20,,1.0,5/5/2017,"I have eaten at many different bjs. This, by far has been the worst one. I ordered med pitas and a large pizza. The pitas were burned, and the pizza was undercooked. I recommend you stay. away from this restaurant.  Very disappointing.  When I called later to complain the general manager, Ryan, would not call back."
Christian H.,"San Diego, CA",3,36,,4.0,11/27/2016,Always think the food is going to be better than it is every time. The bjs beer is really good. They have a few to choose from and they go good with different foods you order. The Pazookie is the real reason to go. I like the chocolate chip but can't go wrong with any flavor cookie.
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,4.0,4/11/2015,"Regular BJ's menu and average-tasting food. But it is the service that my friend and I received here that set this BJ's miles apart from the others I have been to before. My friend and I came in here about 35 minutes before closing. We seated ourselves in the bar area and proceeded to examine the menus. I ordered the clam chowder and my friend ordered the flat bread pizza. 5 minutes after ordering, our waiter came back and told me they had run out of clam chowder (since it was almost closing time). He told me the kitchen would specifically make a brand new serving of clam chowder for me. He then followed up with an apology because my chowder took ""so long"" to come out. We received our bill eventually and saw that our waiter also comped our sodas. BJ's is notorious for having lousy service. But the reception I experienced here was phenomenal. Throughout our late-night dinner, my buddy and I were never rushed out because of their closing time. Great staff here! + kitchen made brand new chowder just for me, ""minutes"" before closing. + Waiter was apologetic for no reason and gave great service. + free root beer!"
Jay B.,"Poway, CA",0,40,2,2.0,1/14/2017,I like this place and they have a big selection of food and beer. Like huge! I have never had a negative experience here until now. I ordered food on the app because nobody answered the phonw and even got a confirmation. They said they didn't get it when I arrived.. I only used this stupid app because they didn't answer the phone. These apps must work properly if they are going to be a solution for their business to be lazy and make us go to the app because it is easier for them. When I got their they said the app isn't working properly and as I write this review I am still waiting. It has been 20 minutes. They are not even putting my food as priority because they messed up and it is not busy. The girl offered me a tea while I wait because she felt bad and she was sitting around talking to employees getting off their shift for 10 minutes before she brought out my tea. I hope the chicken is halfway decent... It's better than the typical TGIF etc that's the only reason you are getting 2 stars..
Kiarra S.,"Riverside, CA",6,45,26,2.0,11/11/2015,This restaurant is always a hit or miss. I used to love the lemon pepper wings until I got a raw wing. The servers here a generally nice. It's a very clean restaurant. The food just sucks sometimes. I just wish my food wasn't undercooked or overdone.
Bobbie S.,"San Diego, CA",98,5,,2.0,4/29/2017,We frequent BJ's and love their food so tonight my BF decided to get take out because we both worked long days. Unfortunately 2 of 3 of the things ordered were unsatisfactory. The Brussell Sprouts were completely burned and could not be eaten at all. I had ordered the chicken parmesan dinner and the chicken had an almost rubbery texture. It was so bad I couldn't eat even half of it (I order thus dish all the time and know what it's supposed to taste like). We called the manager on duty Andy and she refunded the Brussell Sprouts saying it wasn't the first complaint of the night. But proceeded to argue with us about the chicken stating that it didn't make sense and tried to justify that it probably wasn't as good because we ordered take out (pretty much discouraging us from ever buying take out from here again). The food was eaten 15 minutes after we picked it up. As far as customer service I never expect someone to argue with me about the quality of food. If I were in the restaurant I could have shown them the lack on quality of chicken (I tossed more than  half of it out). On a side note the pasta my boyfriend ordered was delicious. I would probably give this place a 4 or 5 if I was going off previous experiences as we dine here often but after tonight's experience and being talked to the way we were about something so easy for the restaurant correct I give a solid 2 and will probably avoid this restaurant for a while.
Felipe P.,"San Diego, CA",6,10,2,4.0,4/11/2016,"Here for drinks before the movie, even though they have drinks now at the theater. Service is great and friendly at the bar and the servers and staff all seem to be smiling and courteous. Gf ordered absolute with pineapple and she digs it. I had the blonde cause it's a little early but it hits the spot."
Nathaniel G.,"San Diego, CA",8,63,462,4.0,4/27/2016,"Good food, nice clean and fancy interior, good service. I am surprised at the overall 3 rating. The pasta dishes are great and they are known for their pizza."
Ryan K.,"San Diego, CA",15,9,,5.0,11/19/2015,We had a 15 minute wait and my pregnant wife was feeling sick from hunger. I asked if they had something she could snack on while we waited. They were extremely helpful and have us some bread sticks straight out of the oven. This is the service that every restaurant should strive to provide.  Thank you to the staff.
Victor M.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,61,15,1.0,7/29/2016,Slowest service ever bartender was to busy chatting away with other customers to acknowledge  us 10 minutes passed and still nothing i finally had to waive my arms in front of her she finally came dropped  some coasters and left once again didnt bother asking us if we are having any food. Need better customer service
Katie K.,"San Diego, CA",355,8,1,1.0,10/6/2015,"I used to enjoy eating at BJ's years back, but my first experience in the mission valley location was not one to brag about.  I came in this past weekend to eat brunch, and it took about 25 minutes for a server to come to our table to greet us, and when she did, she acted like it was completely normal and that we were wrong to have asked for a server to come over. Once she asked for our drink order, we both ordered coffee, and she explained to us in a very short rude manner that the coffee machine was broken. Finding that a bit odd that a huge restaurant has one coffee machine, we just stuck with water and kept our mouths shut. We proceeded to order because after waiting 25 minutes for a server, we were hungry! After she took our order, her attitude was extremely fake and nauseating to the point where I was nervous about our food being tampered with.  We waited about 40 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, they had forgot an entire portion of my entree in the back and had to bring it out later. The food was mediocre at best.  Needless to say I will never come back to a BJ's again. Horrible service. If the server had been kind and apologetic for the wait, then I would have a different outlook, but this experience was the complete opposite of you expect in a restaurant."
Cindy D.,"San Diego, CA",42,313,1,4.0,3/12/2015,"Headed over to BJ's after discovering the beloved Hazard Center Applebees, our original destination, had closed. Parking wasn't an issue for us- we found a spot right away.   I was surprised how big this place was. It's a giant room with high ceilings. Lots of booths and plenty o'tvs for watching the game. The Cajun Pasta was good; it even got better with age--I liked it more after it cooled and the sauce thickened up a bit. The portion size was perfect. I could have cleaned my plate had I not taken down a beer in the process."
Raymond F.,"Jacksonville, FL",29,67,81,4.0,4/4/2015,"I went twice but the first time was for craft beer while waiting on a movie to start near by. The next time was to actually eat at 11pm. I ordered the their rib eye with green beans and clam chowder with a sour dough loaf. For a drink I ordered their clementine crush, which was good but apparently contained alcohol and I couldn't taste it at all but I wasn't in the mood for alcohol so it guess it worked out. Their green beans were steamed but didn't taste like anything but it didn't bother me because I'm used to raw green beans. The rib eye suck for the most part , I got it well done (as I always get) and it was just boring. The best part of the meal was clam chowder with the sourdough loaf. That's the kind of dish I would go out of my way to get, especially if I have been having a bad day.  TL;DR/// The clam chowder wit the sourdough loaf  hit  hard a fuh. Steak and green beans were meh."
Conrad R.,"San Diego, CA",1354,726,15265,3.0,12/5/2013,"It went pretty much as expected.  I like the layout of the space. They did a nice reconstruction of the space since taking over the former Maria Maria spot at Hazard Center. Good sight lines, and traffic flow between tables moves nicely, with accessibility from one end to the other. Neat firepit at the patio. Service today was very good for being recently open and having a new staff on board. Our waiter checked on us regularly, and I wasn't worried about overhearing the trainer give some reminders and coaching on the side. It's encouraging to see that they make the effort to strive for quality customer service. A nice lunch. I tried the boneless buffalo wing appetizer, but I don't know...kinda plain for me. They have better app options. Maybe it was the coating. We shared a deep dish pizza. Hearty toppings, cheesy bites, good crust. Very filling and we took home the extra slices that I snacked on later. You can never have too many snacks when the sports are on. Of course, we got a Pizookie©. It's just one of those simple desserts that we usually don't pass on: smooth vanilla ice cream atop a warm, soft chocolate chip cookie right from the oven. The kiddo definitely approves, and she's the expert on sweets. BJ's is the latest brewhouse restaurant chain to drop in Mission Valley and they'll come along nicely once they take off the training wheels."
Jackey N.,"San Diego, CA",174,131,172,5.0,1/10/2015,"My first time here yesterday for dinner w/ a friend.  It was hard to find parking as it is shared w/ other businesses. But as soon as we walked in, we were seated w/in minutes. Our waiter was awesome and very informative. But because he gave me the wrong price for the soup, it was on the house. I got the chicken pesto sandwich w/ greens and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. All were so delicious! The only thing I didn't like was that it was pretty loud there. But I'll overlook that because I had great food and great service.  I'll surely be back! I want to try the pazookie that my friend said is so good."
Marvin S.,"San Diego, CA",689,491,1260,3.0,12/18/2013,"I'm not really sure how to write this review. On one hand, I LOVE their food here. I don't think I've ever hard anything I would consider less than great. Food comes out hot, tastes great and hardly any mistakes. That's the standard in which is the BJ's I've known since my first BJ's experience at the Grossmont Center location and then at the Moreno Valley location and THEN at the North County location. We chose their Sweet Pig deep dish pizza and their Sesame Chicken Salad. Looked and tasted amazing. On the other hand, my complaint is location. I don't complain about parking much, but this location SUCKS for parking. I am excited about there being a BJ's close by to where we live because I get a chance to have their BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich or their pizza more often now. They have a huge selection of pizza and now offer hand tossed for those who aren't crazy for deep dish. What is wrong with deep dish, btw?! Blah, I definitely will be back for sure. I'm sure glad it wasn't busy when we went tonight. Poor parking + Long wait = Unhappy foodie."
