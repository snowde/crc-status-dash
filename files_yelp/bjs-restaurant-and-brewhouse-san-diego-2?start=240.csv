Faith C.,"San Diego, CA",58,251,49,5.0,3/31/2015,"I walked in yesterday (first time) around 5:00pm and had a great conversation with Sara or spelled Sarah. I ordered the Brewhouse Blonde®...A light and refreshing pale beer in the style of a German Kolsch. Slightly malty with delicate hopping to balance. Well-conditioned for exceptional smoothness and drinkability. Derek was also at the bar - also friendly. I ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip - A rich and creamy blend of spinach, artichokes, cream cheese and spices, topped with Parmesan cheese. Served warm with crisp corn tortilla chips. The spacious dining room has tables spaced out nicely, choices to sit near the open desk or on the deck is nice.  Large TV's are located in great spots near the bar. I'll be back to try a different dish on Thursday afternoon."
Sue H.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,3,,1.0,12/14/2015,I was visiting  from Arizona and wanted to go somewhere a little more lively than my hotels restaurant. BJ's fit the bill but I was pretty disappointed in the food and the service. I ordered a Caesar salad with Cajun shrimp and it came with boiled shrimp and the salad was swimming in dressing.  My bearded server disappeared in action somewhere after bringing me the bill so I had to chase him down because the bartender couldn't cash me out. Tsk tsk.  I did however find some good company so the evening wasn't completely lost.  I won't be going back. Thank you
Laura G.,"Wilmington, CA",89,11,3,4.0,4/19/2016,"We were visiting from LA & decided to eat here for dinner. Hubby was craving ribs & once they placed the full rack of ribs in front of him he smiled big. He devoured them! He says they were really good but needed more bbq sauce so he got a side of it and was satisfied. I got the chicken club sandwich and it was delish!! I was only able to finish half of it & a side ceasar salad which was also very good! Our waitress was so kind & attentive. I wish I remembered her name to make sure she gets kudos from her manager! All I know is she was blonde but we were in San Diego, doesn't help lol. :) We were also seated in less than 5 minutes upon arriving and it was very very packed when we got there. Right timing? Yeah, maybe."
angela t.,"San Diego, CA",27,93,13,4.0,2/15/2015,"Lemon Thyme chicken - healthy and delicious. Served with brown rice, roasted Brussels sprouts, diced tomato, red pepper and onions. Yum! Varied menu and decent wine list. Very open and inviting dining room with patio as well.  Professional, efficient service, which is a bonus."
Shari M.,"Simi Valley, CA",95,22,3,2.0,5/15/2016,"Disappointed. I used the online order app to speed up our wait time, since it was 730 on a Saturday night. It was not any quicker. After checking in we waited as long as everyone else. The wait staff was wonderful but there was some issue in the kitchen. It's a good idea to preorder but it might work better after all staff including hostess are trained in the procedure."
Amanda S.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,,2.0,10/6/2016,"Food was fine this last time we went, but the service was way slower than it should have been. Got our appetizer before our drinks even came out and had to wait awhile at that matter to order anything."
Becky G.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",9,5,,1.0,5/31/2016,"Normally we love BJs. Very disappointed by the food, service, and length of time we had to stay at the restaurant for pizza and dessert.  Our server seemed annoyed when we needed anything.  Although I know Gluten free usually has an extra cost, the server failed to mention this for the kids' meal.  When we asked the cost of a margarita, she said, ""I don't know. Maybe $10 or $11"" umm. Find out, would ya? Since there are no prices on the drink menu.... No? Ok. The gluten free pizza crust was burnt.  The regular pizza crust was soggy. The salad was missing its dressing (or maybe just LIGHTLY dressed?). The pizzas were cut poorly and not all the way through.  The pazookis took over 20... Count them... 20. Minutes. to come out. And she didn't even say happy birthday to the 4 year olds when she lit the candles.  We were stuck there for almost 2 hours. With 4 children. I would have complained to the manager, but it was more important to leave.  So sad because we don't go out much, went out of our way to celebrate here, felt like a bother, and didn't enjoy the food or waiting."
Jean G.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,1.0,10/3/2016,"Did I seriously just pay $7.26 plus $2 tip for this? Plus your soup is insanely salty. Good, but salty! This is a rip off!! Not even literally 1 cup. No chicken. 1 chunk of avocado."
Richa M.,"San Diego, CA",98,49,,4.0,8/2/2016,"Vegetarian pizza with warm dough and tons of veggies, cold beers, and cookie right out of the over + ice cream for dinner? Yes please. 4 stars for a confusing pizza size chart and not a whole lot of vegetarian options. I went with another person and thankfully our waiter, Stacy, convinced us to go a size up for a decent dinner portion. Stacy was very attentive and definitely made our experience great!"
Anthony R.,"Chula Vista, CA",5,23,4,5.0,8/12/2016,"This is my favorite BJ's location, service wise. I've had some horrible experiences at the Grossmont location and only 1 at the Chula Vista location. This one, they take care of you and when you receive your pazooki, the ice cream isn't melted when you get it."
Christoffer F.,"Stockholm, Sweden",43,94,100,4.0,8/11/2014,"Me and my San Diego brother went to this place around nine, there were alot of people but we got seated quickly on the inside!  We orded in pizza and some tacos to split, it was really good! You don't have so much food to choose from on the meny, as the name implies you have plenty of beers to choose from!  But this restaurant is really about their crazy desserts, Pizookie! They are big cookies in a pot with a giant ball of icecream on them! You can choose between diffrent flavours on the cookie and even combine two! They are extremly good!  They have good service, food and it's a really cosy restaurant! Would probably be good for dates!"
Andrew L.,"La Jolla, CA",35,1,,1.0,9/28/2016,"Food was mediocre, and the service was terrible! They made us wait a whole hour to get our chili appetizer, then made us wait another 30 min for checks. The restaurant was even half empty. I left 1 cent for bad service but at least left a tip. Server: Alyssa H #225 from the check I finally got"
Theresa P.,"San Diego, CA",2,92,7,4.0,2/7/2016,"My family came here for a birthday dinner and had a great time! The reason for the four stars was because I called the day before to make a reservation dinner for 7 people on a Saturday night. A female answered who told me to hold so she could check the schedule. After being on hold for 8 minutes (I think she forgot about me) I hung up. That was problem one. 15 minutes later I called again. Another female answered and got me my reservation in under 1 minute. The only other problem was the very small parking lot spaces. They called me the next day to confirm the reservation.  Our table was ready 5 minutes early and we were seated promptly. Had an awesome waitress who handled our table pretty well considering how many tables she was working. My medium rare steak was PERFECTION!!! My family really enjoyed their dinner here and can't wait to go again! It's a bit loud and echoes inside the restaurant, so we had to talk loud, but that was no biggie.. Still had fun."
Tiffany G.,"San Diego, CA",30,40,7,2.0,8/13/2015,I have been to this BJ's a handful of times and I have yet to be impressed. It reminds me of a larger Applebee's but with food that's not even half as good. I'm finally writing a review because after tonight's visit I'm having stomach cramps from the worst calamari I've ever attempted to eat.  I don't even think there was actual squid in the dish because all I could taste was greasy breading. My husband ordered sliders and mozzarella sticks both of which he said were okay. Our poor waitress was so sweet but totally overwhelmed. I don't know if someone called out so she had a larger section than normal but she was covering the entire patio alone and although it was 8pm the outdoor area had no open tables. I would've given one star but I'm going with two because our server was at least very nice.
Shanel S.,"Sterling Heights, MI",704,827,917,5.0,12/20/2013,"I love BJ's ;) See what I did there? But anyway.... This BJ's is a great addition to the Fashion Valley/Mission Valley area. The new staff is obviously still in training, but for the most part they are more than willing to accomodate your needs. One waitress in particular, and I hope I spell her name right, is Alisha. She is the gem in this staff. My friend and I have now become her ""regulars"" and she remembered us after just one time. If I had based this off my first experience I would have never came here again, but thankfully I did. My new favorite is their chicken wing app and they have this Holiday 2 for 1 deal that has really good and filling options, Way better than your Applebees and Fridays deal because it just simply taste way better. Like I said... I love BJ's ;)"
Jennifer A.,"La Jolla, CA",228,66,31,4.0,1/12/2015,"I've been to BJ's many times in various cities, but for this location specifically was the only time I came with a party of 27. Such a long table haha. Anyways, the food was already pre-ordered, which was about 6 pizzas, and I was impressed with how fresh everything was. I had about 4 slices of pizza with flavors such as chicken & artichoke or pepperoni & sausage. After the pizzas, we had 3 party platter pazookies, which was basically devoured after 5 minutes. For my side of the table's pazookie, we had salted caramel, cookies & creme, triple chocolate, and macadamia nut. Triple chocolate was definitely the sweetest, but all flavors tasted astounding together.  Service-wise, I am really impressed with the 2 waitresses we had. They were always checking up on us with a smile on their faces and were very proactive on providing refills whenever needed.  So yes, setting aside my excessive use of commas in this review, this BJ's location was solid. =)"
Raymond A.,"San Diego, CA",857,314,964,2.0,8/26/2014,"Went here trying to look for a late night eatery in my area, was very disappointing.  Food was so so but the service was trrrrrrrrrble, took forever to order, waiter kept reaching over the table and almost hitting us and never once gave the ""excuse my reach"" phrase.  They asked if we wanted to sit in the bar, I didn't want to deal with bar noise... so I asked for a table, they put us in a table that's an extension of the bar.  and on top of that... put us in a booth that had a broken chair... c'mon peeps... you should know what chairs are broken in the brand new BJ's restaurant.... also wasn't cool to turn the lights on as soon as the food was served then keep asking us if we need anything as in trying to scoot us out the door.  At least it wasn't as bad as that chicken pie shop where they sat right next to our table until we left. i'd skip this place and head on over to Studio Diner or Starlight if looking for late night eats."
Gordon H.,"Alhambra, CA",1,37,3,3.0,2/21/2016,Separate reviews for the three dishes wife and I got. The honey Sriracha Brussels sprout - 1 star The pan was cold at arrival but the veggie was burnt. The idea of using a different sauce on a veggie that is usually cooked one way was great but the result and what I ate was not. Chicken Philly pizza - 2 star Having lived in philly...I have to say that this does not taste like anything philly. The only link I can see is the onions and the use of the cheese. Overall the pizza tasted ok...just need a name change Pizookie dessert - 5 stars Almost want to say that we should have ate elsewhere and just come to bj for the pizookie. Maybe next time...
Keren B.,"San Diego, CA",143,279,151,3.0,12/25/2015,"I enjoy BJ's- its great for groups, it has a large space in their bar area and big tables. They have good enough food for a chain restaurant, and their pizookies are yummy! I came here with a group of 20 coworkers for my birthday and we had decent service and everyone ordered drinks and food. I cant say this is the best food I have ever had, its actually far from the best, but its good enough. My mini pizookie was free for my birthday which was nice, they refused to sing, but I was mostly joking when I asked. It wouldn't be my first choice for going out for dinner, but for every once in awhile its a fun spot. My primary complaint is their avocado eggrolls have a spicy mayo like substance and its overpowering! Its like they cover up the fact that there is little to no avocado in them by putting so much spicy stuff in them I cant taste anything else! I would personally rather go to Cheesecake Factory for their avocado eggrolls, which are much tastier. The upside is if you like pizzas, their mini pizzas are half off during happy hour which is a great deal."
Kim Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",398,212,183,4.0,12/8/2013,"I like this location! It's definitely a lot more spacious than the La Jolla location, and the waitress was also really attentive and accommodating. We didn't have a problem with slow service like other reviews have mentioned, but we also went on a weekday evening that wasn't too busy.  The crispy calamari was a good appetizer and we also ordered a medium Great White pizza to split between two people. We overestimated how hungry we were (as usual) but the leftovers were still just as delicious the next day!"
