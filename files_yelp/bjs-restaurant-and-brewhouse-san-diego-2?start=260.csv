Kara K.,"San Diego, CA",574,414,127,4.0,8/23/2014,"This is a great location. It's large, they were friendly and as always the food was deliciousness. I like the enlightened mahi- yum.  Parking is not ideal and you will most likely have to walk far and risk door dings since the spaces are so small... Not fun if you car about your car!  No wait and it's clean!"
Michael M.,"Oceanside, CA",159,15,2,1.0,8/15/2015,"Terrible. A mountain of dishes left on the table from appetizer and drinks. Steak was cooked to death (I ordered medium rare) Mo silverware and once we finally did get silverware (well after the food arrived) it was dirty, bad dirty. I haven't gotten my steak back but I'm willing to bet the already overlooked asparagus is even worse as it will just be left in the hot window while my steak is redone."
Sara S.,"Chicago, IL",1,62,1,3.0,3/17/2016,"The food here is alright, it's a chain, so I'm not expecting to be blown away... BUT! I usually only come here for the root beer. Love the frozen mugs. Best root beer I've ever had. Their lunch menu / happy hour is a really good deal too if you're in the area."
robert s.,"San Diego, CA",6,37,1,2.0,7/1/2015,"Fool me twice, shame on me. As the saying goes, but I ignored the cliche to give this place a second chance and paid the price The first time was pretty innocent. Undercooked lasagna that had to be sent back. I was done before my wife got her remade lasagna. No offer of 'on the house', or even a free dessert. Ok. The second time in May 2015 it was a disaster. I ordered the salmon and when it came out, it was raw in the middle. I asked to please cook longer, and the waitress took it away. Came back 10 mins later, and it was hardly any better. Salmon should be a nice pink throughout, and the inside on this was still cold to the touch, and rubbery like sushi.  I asked for a manager, and asked, ""Is it me or is this still undercooked?"" She agreed, apologized, and took it away. My wife had finished her meal and my stomach rumbled. When it came a third time it was broken into pieces, and crispy all around the outside. I said its fine, I was starving. Manager said the Salmon was on the house. Wife's meal and drinks would be charged though. I thought at least the drinks as well should have been comp'd. The final thing came when paying the bill. It was $49.27 and I gave a $60 bill. The waitress brought it back with just a $10 bill inside. No coins? Really? She just turned her back and walked away like we were the most insulting table she'd ever served.  I left the $10 as tip, and almost started to go back and oping out she was short on the change, but my wife and voice of reason just said, ""Don't do it, we're just not coming  back"". Disappointing twice in a row."
Kalvin P.,"San Diego, CA",237,380,257,4.0,5/2/2016,"I've actually come here several times within the last couple months and always come out happy. Parking can be difficult, as stated. Parking spaces are small, even if you have a compact car. Spots near the entrance of the building are always taken too. If you're here during dinner time, you're going to have to park a little further away unless you get lucky and someone pulls out of their spot right when you're pulling up. Still, ambience in here is very nice. Lighting is a little dim, but the only time that affects anything is when i'm trying to take a picture of my food haha Hostesses have always been pleasant and even during busy times, they'll get to your table as fast as they can. This last time I visited, they had the option for you to leave your number and they'd text you when a booth/table was available if you wanted to sit and have a drink at the bar while you waited. Very cool! Waitresses the last couple times have been knowledgeable of their menu and never forgot to come back for refills or to bring extra ranch (yes, i'm one of those people lol). My favorite appetizers are the avocado egg rolls and the artichoke spinach dip. So good haha. As far as entree's go, I'm usually a pizza guy. I remember their pizza being VERY good before, HOWEVER, the last two times I've gone, the crust seemed a little more dry than usual. As in not enough sauce on the pizza to soak into the deep dish. Topping and cheese were delicious though. I'm a big pizza fan and theirs was one of my favorites so I might give it another try before I call it quits. Maybe even request a little extra sauce next time too. Ahi Poke salad is good as well. Give that a try! Overall, aside from the parking, my experiences have always been pleasant here. Good size menu and quality of food is better than at others like applebees and TGI Fridays. And living really close to it doesn't hurt either :p"
vadis m.,"San Diego, CA",23,23,2,5.0,10/12/2014,"Stopped by last night for a few drinks with my hubs. Derrick was at the bar and he was really awesome. Super funny, a really great guy. Jeremiah Red is DELISH!!!!"
Courtney G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",111,3,,2.0,3/7/2017,Staff is extremely rude. I have been to this location multiple times and never receive even decent service. Food is the only thing that keeps us coming back.
Pauline S.,"San Diego, CA",31,47,13,1.0,4/8/2016,"Have decided that this will no longer be our ""go to"" spot for food. Second time we have had terrible food, not sure if it's because it's late. Had a soup and salad...the soup was broccoli cheddar and tasted very salty as well as burnt! As if it had sat in the pot all day with the burner high! The sourdough bread bowl lid was covered in salt and butter :( not a happy camper."
Suzanne C.,"San Diego, CA",19,70,27,1.0,9/6/2015,"Waited 2 hours for dinner. Food was ok, but the poozie was just raw cookie dough...gross. They didn't even have any clean spoons  so we had to eat it with plastic spoons. Waitress ws nice but just slow, very slow service. Not very attentive at all."
Elisabeth B.,"North Las Vegas, NV",1,4,,5.0,1/27/2017,The food was ok but our waitress Stacey went above and beyond and made out experience great.
Stephen H.,"San Diego, CA",199,97,128,5.0,11/17/2015,Came here on Veterans Day.  Me and my fellow shipmates were treated like KINGS... Had order the trio pizookie. Must have and to die for. (WHITE CHOCOLATE) My friend had ordered the steak but had order it medium rare but it came out medium well.  Long story short we had a free x-tra steak. :) Great way to celebrate Veterans Day here.  Everything we order we got $12.95 off each of our meals.
Reneesha R.,"Anaheim, CA",70,65,14,4.0,7/16/2015,"We are regulars to our BJ's in Cerritos, so we were glad when we saw there was one near where we were staying. We came here for Happy Hour, right around 10pm. When we entered the restaurant, there was no one at the front desk so we went just seated ourselves at the bar area. The restaurant was surprisingly a bit empty for the day and time we went. Shortly after finding a table, a server came by and gave us menus. He was a very friendly guy who took our orders promptly. We ordered three orders of happy hour sized wings and potstickers as well as a Jeremiah Red and Double Berry. While the drinks came at a normal pace, the food came out a little slower than it should have considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. However, when the food finally did arrive, everything was cooked satisfactorily. I was bit disappointed that the server didn't come around very often. A couple times, we had to flag him down to get something. Overall, it was an okay visit. The food and drinks were good, but the service lacked. Also, I was surprised to see that most of the television sets throughout the restaurant weren't showing any sports stations. Interesting."
Eugenia C.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,3.0,4/23/2016,"I am kind of disappointed,  I came for the unlimited soup and salad just to find out this deal is only Monday thru Friday.  It makes no sence they still have it under the lunch special and it doesn't specify that is only offer Monday thru Friday until you try to order it."
Macy H.,"Descanso, CA",340,55,4,1.0,9/2/2016,Took my boyfriend and I 20 minutes to get waters. We didn't even order we got up and left to go eat somewhere else. The service is too slow.
Claudia L.,"San Diego, CA",11,9,3,3.0,1/15/2016,"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Just had lunch with my stepdaughter and regret bringing her to this BJ's for her first experience. The lack of service is unacceptable! She never checked up on our table, didn't refill our drinks and forgot to put in my order of stuffed mushrooms. The food was not the greatest, but her service made it worse. I only tipped her $1.37, and I only did it because I wanted to be an even $45.  I am only updating my review because the GM took time to address my experience and truly appreciate his concern. The GM was polite, professional and caring!"
Michael B.,"San Diego, CA",41,42,,3.0,8/18/2016,It was ok. I have high expectations from the other BJ's I've been to and I was honestly disappointed by the poor service at this location. It took us almost an hour to get our food and then it was burnt.
Joe K.,"San Diego, CA",387,131,112,3.0,10/5/2015,It was alright. Nice place to hangout and watch the game. Ordered a wild berry mojito and it was ridiculously sweet. Got a regular mojito and it was a lot better. Good was decent. They were not staffed properly for the Sunday crowd and food took about 20-30minutes to arrive. Meh.
Taylor K.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,2.0,2/11/2017,"Brooke made us feel rushed the entire meal, asked if we wanted the check before we were halfway through, and then stared at us until we closed out. Then went to have a beer with her friends at the next table. Awful service and experience."
Chuck P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",177,4,,5.0,8/13/2016,"I came into BJ's around 11pm on a Friday and had Trevor in the cocktail. First off, he was great. I've had the traditional wings before but he recommended them tossed and they were better than expected. Next, I was torn between the spicy pig pizza and the chicken pesto; Trevor recommended the pesto and it was delicious. All of the food came out quickly and the drinks were pretty good for a chain joint - I had the house red ale my date had the hef, both of which were good. I'm not much a ""yelper"" but Trevor's service was worth it. Thanks again for the helping us narrow down the giant menu and the great service, we look forward to the next visit!"
gigi a.,"Bonita, CA",3,45,7,5.0,12/20/2016,"The 5 star is solely for Morgan, seriously best waitress I've had at any BJs! Super sweet, menu expert, and made sure I was happy with my food. I didn't like a dish I ordered and she didn't make me feel bad and totally hooked it up! Thank you Morgan :)!"
