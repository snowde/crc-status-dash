Shar M.,"San Diego, CA",229,232,396,5.0,4/20/2015,"I had lunch here today with a friend and we sat at a very nice table out on the patio so we could get some afternoon sun. Restaurant itself is very large and spacious and it is great for larger groups or parties.  The menu is extremely extensive so there is something for everyone and every type of diet.  I have lunchtime specials to so I chose the endless soup and salad which was completely enough for one person at a very reasonable price of $6.50.  I'm trying to watch what I eat so it was really hard not to order dessert because there were lots of amazing looking treats on the menu as well.  The location is very central, in Mission Valley, and there is ample parking in the public lot right in front of the restaurant.  We had great service our waitress was very friendly and checked on us plenty of times during our visit.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other delicious looking salads they had on the menu."
Temple R.,"San Diego, CA",6,41,46,4.0,11/1/2015,"Came here  on my sisters 28th birthday. To start, it was busy, the hostess told us to try to find a table in the bar area. Can we know a wait for an actual table? Is there even anything available in the bar area? I had her go check before she sent us over there.  We ended up splitting a community table with some folks. Our server cody or casey,i cant remember what his name was, was very attentive, and kinda had a jersey accent. He checked Id's and saw it was my sisters birthday and made her feel very special. He really knew the menu and helped us pick out some food, then he made sure the kitchen brought out a dessert for my sisters birthday. Great service,one star removed for the terrible hostess."
X D.,"San Diego, CA",35,299,1247,2.0,3/27/2016,The ambience is ok here. The worse part is probably parking. The spaces are so tiny. It was a busy Saturday night. We ordered avocado rolls as appetizers... Which was very delicious. I ordered bacon cheeseburger with wedge fries and it was regular burger. Kind of dry for medium rare. Ordered cheeseburger pizza. That's was ok. Probably won't order ever again. Their pizza is super thick so be prepared to be full. Bathrooms were horrible. Needs some attending to.
Kali S.,"San Diego, CA",3,18,13,5.0,8/4/2015,Our server was Stacy T (according to the receipt) and she was amazing! So sweet! Also there was a rather demanding couple behind us that was making it difficult to her to focus on all of her tables but she handled it with such grace. Not to sound too cheesy but I wish more servers were like her haha Food is always amazing and save room for dessert!! The pazookie is crazy delicious. The lemonade is crazy sweet just fyi
Erik G.,"San Diego, CA",877,500,1895,3.0,4/4/2014,"Built from ground up, this place is really nice inside.  Spacious floor plan with high ceilings lend to a wide-open feel.   They have numerous televisions and a 3 tier shelf bar.  Food is what you would expect.  Vast menu with salads, apps, pizzas. The BJ's Favorite Classic Pizza and a pizookie are always my favorites, along with the well rounded in-house craft beer selections.  Decent enough and would be a great place to catch lunch and drinks prior to hopping on the Trolley within this Hazard Center before a Chargers game."
Diana S.,"San Diego, CA",651,542,1818,3.0,5/19/2015,"I guess I'm not just having much luck with BJ's Restaurants...but this time was the food not the service. Service was on point this time...than again I went through the Take-Out door instead. I was there to help a friend out with their fundraiser and the person helping me was able to direct my portion of the money to the right fund. :)  I just ordered something simple, the veggie and goat cheese flatbread and the corn fitters. It took about 15mins for my order which I expected and while she was training the new waitstaff, was showing her some great customer service tips and skills (you go girl!)  The food though, was eh. Wasn't impressed but than again for a rushed out the door job, it was edible. The flatbread pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom and the veggies were unevenly dispersed which most of the veggies were in the middle and the side pieces were just cheese. The corn fritters were a sad mess of burnt balls. Since the dish was to-go, they had to separate the sauce, the fritters and just dumped some bacon, corn and shallots on the bottom of the plate. They couldn't just put it in a little sauce cup like the dipping sauce? Sheesh.  In any case, the burnt corn fritter balls we're chewy too."
Richard G.,"San Diego, CA",103,10,,2.0,8/1/2016,Been here a few times constantly bad service long wait time and waiters are just going through the motions. Twice I've gone had to ask the hostess for silverware... I should've just brought my own. I recommend just coming in get a beer get the egg rolls and then go somewhere else.
Joseph Y.,"La Mesa, CA",376,1059,4604,4.0,5/27/2014,Service is definitely getting better here. I think this place's staff has got the hang of things. Food is still kinda slow coming out of the kitchen around lunch time though.
Becca T.,"San Diego, CA",46,129,25,4.0,7/21/2014,"Awesome outdoor seating. I've only ever ordered drinks and dessert here, but they have an extensive menu that I am looking forward to try one day. GET THEIR PAZOOKIES. It's a warm, gooey cookie that comes out in a skillet with ice cream on top. YUM. Plus, 10% of the Pazookie proceeds goes to charity--sounds like a win, win. My favorite drink there is the Double Berry, it's a Berry Cider and some type of framboise. It's fruity deliciousness!"
Annie B.,"San Diego, CA",10,129,19,3.0,9/10/2015,The sampler platter is pretty good. Service is consistent with most chain restaurants.  The skillet cookie desert is good but not a triumph.  It's like Applebee's and TGI Friday's combined into an expensive third option. Lots of TV's.
Moisee A.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,2,5.0,7/19/2016,This has been an awesome experience! The food was great the ambiance was awesome. Our waiter was on point. Our food was served really quick and the pizza was just out of this world! I would definitely recommend this place for family's. My wife daughter and I were absolutely please. The house blonde beer also had a great taste. Justin was the waiter and he deserves he 5 stars himself!! We will definitely be back.
C C.,"El Cajon, CA",31,91,15,5.0,6/10/2015,"This is my second time here and Courtney made it a good experience for my youngest son's birthday. I had a delicious deep dish pizza, the kids had flatbread, a chicken club sandwich, wings and chicken strips. We ate the avocado egg rolls (awesome) and Courtney was attentive and polite throughout the meal. We will be back!"
Pete S.,"San Diego, CA",6,107,12,2.0,3/4/2015,"Happy hour  beer was pretty good. Mojito was awful. Small portion overpriced happy hour food. BJ's had a decent happy hour,but I guess the happy hour turned into sour hour."
Cristina B.,"Redwood City, CA",255,714,89,2.0,4/8/2014,"The service was friendly but beyond slow despite a half empty restaurant. Our server gave me a place setting when I asked for pepper, never brought my dining companions red pepper flakes for her pizza, and our (quickly emptied) waters remained untouched throughout our lunch. I was late getting back to work because it took so long to get each menu item, and then get our bill, and then have her pick it up. We left cash because we were so frustrated and didn't want more time to pass before a card could get run. I was a half hour late returning from my lunch break... We also witnessed an unfortunate mishap when a busser zipped past another table and spilled a bowl of ranch on the diners sitting there. I will give the manager props for appearing seconds after this happened, but I was dismayed to see the same busser zip past moments later with an even bigger stack of cleared dishes a few minutes later. I ducked. My food was tasty, and my server was friendly but I'm really disappointed at the lack of attention and lack of service."
Isaac B.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/11/2016,Lied about how many they can seat.  Haven't even sat down and already bad vibe.  Sorry but front desk is the first impression besides looks of restaurant.  Get your crews head right!
Jason W.,"San Diego, CA",199,72,202,4.0,5/17/2014,"This is a spacious restaurant.  There are two large patio seating areas on the left and right sides of the entrance.  The outdoor seating is perfect for the warmer months.  Plenty of sunshine.  The restaurant also plays music from speakers facing the patios.  This adds to the fun ambiance.   I came here on a Saturday afternoon.  The waitstaff are very friendly.  The food is good.  I had a bacon cheeseburger for $10.  I also had a warm pizookie to die for.  If you have never had a pizookie, please do before you die.  It's a large hot/warm, gooey cookie in a pizza pan, topped with two scoops of French Vanilla ice cream.  It will change your life.   The layout for this place would make a great spot for happy hours or social gatherings.  apparently it does not get very busy here, but it barely opened November 2013.  I recommend this restaurant for pizza, diverse Americana cuisine, and PIZOOKIES."
August P.,"San Diego, CA",2,60,72,4.0,7/10/2015,Perfect day for a fresh brew of Hefeweizen/Blonde: we ordered a Sample plater and The spicy pig pizza. Food and drinks were a match made in heaven.
Gillian C.,"Gilbert, AZ",92,108,285,5.0,7/20/2014,"We loved the food.  First time we have went here.  Loved the root beer.  I got the tortilla soup.  They brought it out in a pitcher and poured it in the bowl with all the trimmings on the bottom.  Pretty interesting but I would have rather just had a bowl of soup come out w/ the trimmings on a side plate so they can be on top of my soup.  Overall,  would love to eat here again."
Djana W.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,1,2.0,3/25/2016,I'm not going to blame bjs 100%. The server we had was awful. Our food came out cold and I had to ask him several times for multiple things. I don't know if he was just forgetting or just bad at what he does. People with other servers that came after us were being served and even left before us ! I couldn't wait to get out of there by the time our bill came.
Diane H.,"Fallbrook, CA",5,17,8,1.0,2/15/2015,"One star is actually one star too many!  This is the absolute worst restaurant I've ever been too!!   I have been to BJ's many times but never too this location. NEVER AGAIN!  STAY AWAY!   My friend and I checked into the hostess station for a table, they told us it would be 5-10 minutes, we punched in a phone number for a text when the table was ready.  In the meantime, we sat at a table in the bay area, at the edge of the patio.  We sat there waiting waiting waiting for a server too come to us to take a drink order..nothing...time passed, no server..couldn't even see one in the area...20 min later still nothing.  Snagged a bus boy that was clearing a table next to us and he promised to get a server for us.  He walked over to the server station and told them we had not been approached for service at all.  They all turned, looked at us..spoke among each other but still nothing.. The bus boy returned, finished wiping that table and said he was going to get us a manager, which he did.   The manager came over..apologized for the overlook and asked if we knew what we wanted to which we responded that we didn't know..We had no menus, no napkins, nothing.  He brought some over shortly.  We still had no text for a table so when he came back with the menus we saw that a table was being cleared in the patio area and would just take that table instead.  He seemed displeased or annoyed but followed us over and handed us the menus and left with our drink order. Shortly after a guy shows us and said he is going to be our server..We review the menu and place our orders..still no drinks, no water, nothing.. 20 min later or drinks arrive, a couple of min after our food.  I ordered fish and chips..My friend a burger and fries.  He dumps the food off and disappears.  The fish was so fried that it looked like they refried some fish they had laying around..hopefully not leftovers from another plate.  It was very dark brown..pretty much charred to the point of the fish inside dissolving. We had no napkins, no eating utensils, no condiments and we sat there dumbfounded looking at each other like wth!!  Are you kidding me!!  Eventually our server made an appearance at another table..I kept flagging him down and he finally came over, seemingly annoyed!  I asked I'd we can please have some utensils, catsup, tater sauce and lemons so we can start eating.  He brought them over and ran!!  I had the worst, cold, gross meal ever..picked at it, left must but figured at that point I didn't want to wait another hour and didn't want them spitting in my food...wouldn't shock me.  That waiter with the funny moustache is the worst ever!!   Horrible horrible horrible...never to return there again, not even by mistake!
