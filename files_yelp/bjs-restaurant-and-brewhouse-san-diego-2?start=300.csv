Joe T.,"San Diego, CA",62,1693,13708,3.0,7/7/2014,"I have been here twice so far.  Both times the service was nice.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I usually come here by myself for a beer or several friends and usually have no problem with the service.  The beer selection is nice.  Every time I go to a BJ's the sampler set options seem to change.  Some BJ's you can just get the light beers, dark beers, or you can pick your own.  Pretty cool but always updating myself with the menu.  The burgers are pretty good.  Big, filling, and cooked to order.  The wings are good but not very good for the value.  I like the patio area with the big fire place.  They also have heaters for the winter and television sets.  Overall it is a nice place for some food and beer.  Hopefully they can do better in this location than the other previous tenants."
Dane S.,"Lake Forest, CA",7,20,25,5.0,4/4/2015,Great friendly service... Awesome beers ... Delicious food ... Not cheap .. Not expensive
Courtney H.,"San Diego, CA",309,538,125,4.0,3/19/2015,"I like the variety of the menu at B.J.'s. It's a good go-to when you don't know quite what you want. We've been here for all three meals and have always had good service and good food. Next time I'll probably order a pizookie trio that I saw on someone else's table. It's a chain, so it's pretty standard, nothing exceptional, but sometimes you just want a trusty standby."
Angel A.,"San Diego, CA",116,48,162,4.0,5/29/2015,"I am here all the time. I really love the food. The service and bartenders are great, on it and very nice. The kitchen always mess up but fix it fast. The only thing that gets me and my friends, that are reg here. Is the new manager he is not very nice and seems to like to be brass to the customers. Weird but whatever"
Fouad M.,"San Diego, CA",13,228,3,5.0,4/8/2015,Went there again last night. Ordered few drinks at the bar before being seated at the table. The drinks were good and service was quick. Ordered salad and Bison burger. Bison burger came with coleslaw which was OK but the Bison Burger was delicious. My friend did not like the salad. Ordered Pizookie and loved it. Really worth trying.
Donna R.,"San Diego, CA",207,28,92,4.0,2/6/2015,"Went to BJ's spur of moment with work sustained and had an executive lunch, this place was busy so we sat at the bar and enjoyed hot wings which had good flavor but not too spicy.  Then we had guacamole rolls which I thought were super spicy and pizza.  Was a fun lunch and This place is great and the company was even better."
Megan B.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",23,33,1,2.0,4/9/2015,"I have attempted to eat at this BJ's 2 different times. The first time was on Veterans day where the wait was ridiculous due to the free meal. I gave them my cell # to send me a text when our table was ready. After an hour, I went to check on the wait. They had no record of my number and I would have to restart our wait time. The girl was rude. We left.  The 2nd time was for a group dinner. My dinner had a hair in it. I told the food runner right after she put it down and she quickly took it away. The waiter was really helpful but it took quite a long time to get a replacement dinner. The manager came over and asked if everything was ok. I told him what happened and he apologized.  I will be skipping this chain from now on."
Veronica C.,"San Bernardino, CA",6,19,5,5.0,7/27/2015,"You can never go wrong with BJ's. Great menu and great service. Always. And their patio is nice.  What I DIDN'T like is sitting in the patio area while other employees took their break. They sat two tables away and I could hear them using foul languages to the point I almost asked to be moved. I am all for relaxing and letting loose once you get off work, but I was with my father and near others who couldn't enjoy their evening."
Matthew B.,"San Diego, CA",3,30,,1.0,2/14/2016,Horribly disappointed. Online order process is cumbersome and my Sante Fe Chicken salad came with one small dressing. It's like they've never had one of their own salads. Salad was ok but having to use ranch out of my own fridge killed it. And the process of curbside ordering feels like they just don't get it. They send out a cute little teen to bring out our order in the dark and then it takes 2 trips to bring food and bill. As a dad of teenage girls I don't feel like that is responsible or safe.
Janie V.,"San Diego, CA",324,108,35,4.0,6/13/2014,"Went by for lunch this afternoon, and upon entering we were greeted and seated shortly. My boyfriend and I love BJ'S. The service was good, nothing bad to say about our waitress. Very cute and friendly lady. The lunch specials are so awesome and still very big portions. I had soup and corn fritters.  The fritters are amazing, love them! The soup I had came out warm which was okay but I love my food steaming hot. My bf had the southern fried chicken with mash potatoes. The mash potatoes was soo yummy and fresh. Overall it was a good lunch day, oh their strawberry lemonade is super refreshing."
Liz H.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,,5.0,6/1/2016,I always order to-go. It's always ready when I get there & still fresh when I get home. Perfect after a long day of coaching.
Jennifer C.,"San Diego, CA",78,12,12,1.0,1/15/2016,"It pains me to leave this review because I do enjoy coming to this restaurant.  However, I have not been here in a while and had a terrible experience today at lunch. I called in a take out order.  I ordered the lunch special with a classic baked potato, add bacon and cheese and a tomato and mozzarella salad.  I went to pick up my lunch and it was ready when I got there. I looked at the baked potato and noticed it was missing butter, sour cream, and chives. All items the classic baked potato comes with. I decided not to make a big deal out of it and just told the server that it looked like the sour cream was missing. His response was, oh you wanted sour cream. I really wanted to tell him that it comes with what I ordered, but I didn't want to have to educate him on a menu item that he should know. I again, let this slide.  Next it came to paying for my lunch he told me the total and automatically I knew it was wrong. There is no way the lunch combo is $11+.  I believe it is 7.25, but then I did add bacon and extra cheese to the baked potato so I imagined it increased the price, but didn't know how much. After I paid the server handed me my bag, but did not give me the receipt. I had to ask for it. As I was walking out I noticed I was rang up for a baked potato meal add cheese and bacon. It was odd to me that I was able to get the correct order, meaning I also got the salad, but yet the way it was listed on the receipt was incorrect. I went to my car to make sure to look up the menu online and sure enough it was wrong.  I went back into the restaurant and advised the server that was helping me that I think my meal was rung up incorrectly. He looked at the receipt and then said oh it looks like my manager entered this in incorrectly (ZERO accountability), let me go get him, I will be right back. I was leaning up again the wall with my back to the kitchen on my phone. A few minutes later I hear a ""hi my name is _____(I forget what the guys name was, I think it was Paul or Mark or something)"". I didn't turn around because I had no idea he was talking to me. Then he repeats himself, this time with a slightly ruder tone.  The first tone wasn't pleasant to begin with. He said you wanted to speak to me. I said, no, I told this gentleman that I thought my order was entered in incorrectly and I overpaid for my meal. He looks at the receipt and said oh, well you can jut give her the difference. He said, yeah it looks like he (ZERO Accountability again) rang it in incorrectly.  The server then gives the difference back and I went about my way, but with a slightly jaded perspective of this restaurant. A. How did I receive the correct order (kind of), but yet pay for a different meal? B.  Was my meal entered incorrectly because the server was then going to go back in and change the order and take the difference as a tip, or was who ever who rang me in just that lazy and incompetent? C. The manager was an ASS! You can tell he had a bit of a chip on his shoulder. I am not sure if he is a new manager or just the day time manager because I have gone to this restaurant in the evening and have had nothing but nice things to say about all the staff. I wish I could blame his rudeness on the rush hour lunch, but it was 2 o'clock and the restaurant was not busy at all. In fact when I walked in the first time i had two servers look at me and not help me and then when I came back due to the overcharging there were two other servers at the take out station again just standing there, not helping.  Bottom line, this location needs to work on their customer service skills!!"
Mauro A.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,2,3.0,9/13/2015,"Last night was my first visit to BJ's. I was part of a large group and we had our own private area. I (luckily) decided to walk in to the bar upon my arrival and open a tab versus ordering from the two servers dedicated to our group. I saw a lot of people either waiting for long periods to get their drinks, or, the server completely forgot to bring their drink. Aside from that, said servers were pleasant. I would just walk to the bar each time I wanted another drink and my excellent bartender, Brittany H, would get my order right away and I was quickly back to my group with a fresh, cold beer, while my friends had to wait for theirs. The only tricky thing was actually walking on the restaurant floor. It was super slippery (and I was wearing new sneakers). I asked someone from my group who also inside as I ice-skated quickly and shakily past them, ""Is it just me or is this floor slippery?"" He said, ""Not just you. It is!"" Luckily I have good balance but I thought someone is going to slip and fall. Not good. But the place was fine other than the above. Thanks again, Brittany H, for the excellent service and easy smile!"
Brian V.,"San Diego, CA",336,19,1,5.0,10/25/2016,"Came here around 3pm on a Tuesday for a late lunch. My girlfriend and I had spent the day furniture shopping, I know screw me right? We sat at the bar and were helped out by a bartender named James. The food was decent, and beer cold.. but the main reason I will return to this establishment was James, he provided guidance with that giant damn menu and helped my girl out with finding a beer she enjoyed. Customer service is everything and James went over and beyond for us."
Samantha N.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,4,5.0,5/28/2016,Came here for dinner today and had the best experience. Thanks to our waitress Ian! Best customer service:) He was really nice and polite with us and came every time to check if we needed something. Definitely will be coming back!
Melissa A.,"San Diego, CA",105,125,265,3.0,6/16/2015,"I'll start with the pros.They have late night dining, their deep dish pizza is tasty, their signature item, pizookie, is cookie heaven, & cocktails are cheap.  However, I was really disappointed in their Shrimp Scampi Pasta. It lacked flavor & there was barely any shrimp in it! I basically got a large bowl of plain angel hair pasta.  I had trouble flagging down a waiter too. I think he went on break because I couldn't find him. I had to wait 20 minutes just to get red pepper flakes & water!"
Teddy T.,"San Diego, CA",2,1,,2.0,7/14/2016,"The worst customer service ever. I will never return to this location. Been here over 10 times frequently to the point their employees even recognize me by face, and I always gave generous tips; yet, their service never got better and I can truly say it sucks. The waiter takes 30mins to communicate with you when you arrive. Specifically, the night crew are very unfriendly and they do not understand what customer service mean. They will take forever to bring out your food to the point that the food comes out cold and needs to be heated. You are lucky if you get 1 refill of your drink. I will never recommend anyone to go to this BJ location. Horrible service! Chula Vista location doesn't have this problem. Please fix your issues!!!! Majority of your customers are complaining about the same issues. It shouldn't be that bad, but it is. Also worth noting,  the place was near empty. I am a person that doesn't complain and I am very easy to please, but the service is truly terrible. I don't want any other customers having to deal with the poor service I deal with every time. ******************************************************* Edit: This place is much improved. Staff are friendlier, and they do a better job communicating with you when you enter. Not a 5 star place, but definitely a lot better than the past. Moving in the right direction."
Rachel M.,"San Diego, CA",8,12,2,5.0,9/2/2015,My friend and I went to enjoy the happy hour menu today and Nick was our server. We sat in the bar area. He was so kind and friendly and very funny as well.  Go to BJ's and ask for Nick!
Michael B.,"San Diego, CA",0,40,,2.0,11/7/2015,"Came here several years ago on opening night and it was abysmal. Came back a few days ago with family from out of town and made the monumental mistake of giving it a second chance. Food we tried (burgers, salads, etc) were forgettable as much as the lack of overall flavor. Saving grace here was that the waitress was kind and helpful.  I've been to other BJs around the country that are excellent. This one seems doomed."
C W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",85,59,16,1.0,3/20/2016,Went for a celebration dinner last night and had the worst experience ever. The service was absolutely horrible. The best meal of the night was my kids grilled chicken alfredo. Extremely disappointed. Appetizers came out over cooked. Then had to request the plates and silverware in order to serve it to everyone at the table. When the rest of the food came out it was very Bland. I had clam chowder in a bread bowl which is my all-time favorite however if this was the worst I've ever had. Went there is a celebration dinner turned out to be a disaster dinner.  Myself and my family will not be coming here again. Please do not auto reply with a I'm sorry you had a bad time can we make it up to you.  You can't you ruined what was supposed to be a very special night with me and my family
