Cassandra S.,"San Diego, CA",86,68,16,5.0,3/25/2016,Our server Jason was awesome tonight! We started out thinking we'd have about 10-12 people and then 19 showed up! They accomodated our large group and were amazing! Food and drinks were awesome! Highly recommend their happy hour too!
Arturo P.,"San Diego, CA",5,2,4,5.0,4/30/2015,The service and everything was great and fun with my family !!!! The clam chowder soup was great that one for sure !!
Rigo S.,"Holtville, CA",2,52,54,5.0,7/11/2015,Love their pizza and especially their pizookies! White chocolate macadamia is my favorite.
Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187,5.0,10/30/2013,"Awesome! Love their pizza and the beer section here. I was skeptical of the bacon, chicken, ranch pizza, but the combo actually works really well. Their enlightened Ahi salad is another favorite of mine. The grilled steak salad is really tasty with the warm grilled veggies and blue cheese tossed into the mix. BJ's has a ton of beer on tap. If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, their bottle selection is pretty impressive as well. They even have root beer and cream soda on draft. You can't come to BJ's and not have a pazookie. These things are a billion calories each, but they are so evil and good. Warm cookie out of the oven with vanilla ice cream melting on top. They even have a small size for sharing, or to hog all for your fatty self."
Shelby W.,"Santee, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/30/2016,Food is great. Happy hour is great. We are sitting in the bar and the service is terrible! We stood by our table for a good 2 minutes before it got cleaned off and all the other tables around us were a mess as well. Very slow and they got or dessert and refill on a drink wrong. Would not recommend sitting in the bar. As for the dining area i do not know.
Rick L.,"Prior Lake, MN",6,59,81,4.0,3/13/2016,Old favorite...Lots of brews and you can't beat dessert. A combo original chocolate chip and cookies & cream pazookie.
Marcus J.,"San Diego, CA",100,43,30,4.0,4/21/2015,"Visited this place with friends who were all staying at a nearby hotel for a seminar. There were about 16 of us and they handled the big group well. The food was really good (I had salmon, rice, and vegetables...one friend had gluten free pizza...another had shrimp tacos....one had spaghetti....another one had Pizookie...). The thing that amazed me was they had no problem giving us individual checks.The lunch specials are a great deal, if you ask me. We were here sort of late...got to the restaurant at 7:30 and left around 9:30 or 10. The area is pretty well lit but there weren't many people around so I was glad I was walking with several people. So while it's in a shopping center, it's not someplace that has a lot of traffic late at night. The parking is inside the Hazard Center. We were there on a Sunday night though so maybe that's not a good benchmark. Just wanted to mention it though."
Sasha T.,"San Diego, CA",6,13,3,2.0,12/6/2014,"Best part were our drinks. We went just for a few apps and drinks. Table sat next to us 15 minutes later and got our app on accident. Before the server even noticed our food was delivered to the wrong table they were finished and served their pizza. Our wings came out, the ranch had a black hair in it. When we told the waiter about it he was like ""oh that's not good I'll get you another one"". We order avocado spring rolls, Calamari and wings and the spring rolls were the only thing hot. Everything else was cold. Luckly my margarita was good or we would've left.  Worst part was nothing was taking care of. I'm just glad we went for apps and drinks because if we went for a full meal it would've been a catastrophe!!!!"
Cynthia S.,"San Diego, CA",35,99,67,3.0,3/3/2015,"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend. We were excited to try the famous pizookie made here. So all of the waitress and staff were extremely friendly and everything was going well. The place is huge and clean. So my boyfriend and I decided to share full rack ribs and the lasagna. Okay so the ribs were okay. They were really burnt and it tasted okay. The lasagna taste decent too. The food was just decent. So we decided to try the pizookie. We got the cookies and cream pizookie and it was amazing! I'm glad I ended a decent meal with a delicious pizookie. Okay is the price worth the meals? No. It is over priced and not worth the quality of the food. Is te pizookie worth the money? Yes! It is definitely worth it. Would I come here again and give it another try? Yes, I would. It's just disappointing to pay over $50 for a decent quality food."
Vivian C.,"San Diego, CA",37,43,7,2.0,5/20/2015,"I sat at the bar with my co-worker. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the artichokes. 15 mins later the artichokes came out, it tasted great! We thought the mushrooms would be out shortly, but another 15 mins passed. We asked our waiter if they were still coming. He apologized and let us have the mushrooms on the house. Thanks!  We decided to order the chicken alfredo with the chicken on the side. My friend and I were sharing and I am a vegetarian. The order came out and there was chicken on the side. Half way through the meal. I saw pieces of chopped up chicken in my alfredo. Weird. Where did the chicken come from if they clearly remembered to put it on the side? Thanks Bj's but I will not be back!"
Becky K.,"Fairview Heights, IL",133,136,11,3.0,3/4/2016,"The only reason it's getting three stars is because of the service. For the life of me I can't remember our servers name but she was the sweetest thing ever! The drink I ordered was out of stock, the baked ziti I ordered tasted freezer-burnt in the middle. The server saved the day though, she was so charming and made everything work it."
Jenna B.,"San Diego, CA",11,94,16,1.0,12/30/2014,"Yikes...and whoa. I keep going back because I love pizzokie and because I grew up on BJ's, so have a soft spot for it. But this location is HORRIBLE!!!! I've been multiple times and always give them the benefit of the doubt but I've finally given up. Worst service by a server, no communication whatsoever, mgmt certainly doesn't care and it keeps getting worse each time. I work hard for my $$$ why should I keep giving it to a business that just doesn't care about their guests? Especially returning loyal ones!  It's been a good relationship but it had to end some time! Never again BJ's!"
Catherine B.,"San Diego, CA",3,17,,5.0,9/23/2015,"BJs always has delicious food and drinks. I love coming here :) Right now they have a ""Party for Two"" which is a salad or soup per person, a medium deep dish pizza, and a pizookie. You can even do a half and half pizza. Definitely worth the $25!"
Lila M.,"San Diego, CA",197,135,270,5.0,5/20/2015,"Love coming to this location. Great location and vibe. Service is always top notch. Great for family night, date night or to spend with friends."
Jordan G.,"Pico Rivera, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/9/2016,"I am giving this BJ's a 1 star review because despite the food being really good, apparently they didnt want us to really enjoy our food. Rather our server (Nicholas S.) did not.  All this guy wanted was to get his tip & boy this was SO not the way to get it.  When we clearly were not done eating he so easily asked if we were done and without waiting for us to answer, took my mom's food away!  BJ's is not cheap so that was SO not cool. Did not feel welcome at all.  Really nice dude *roles eyes*.  If you ever go to this BJ's in San Diego Mission Valley, do not I repeat DO NOT, have Nicholas S. as your server. He will appear to be concerned about how you are doing, but all he really cares about is his tip -_-  Seriously dude, learn some people skills."
Crystal B.,"Kihei, HI",239,342,475,4.0,3/9/2015,"Lunch date with sis in law. They have great lunch specials about $8-10. We both ordered flat bread w/ salad. I got vegetable w/ goat cheese . We told him we have get back to work, so he put the order in quick for us.He was very attentive, wish I remember his name. Quick at the end with the check as well. She ordered a caramel pazooki & i had two scoops icecream; vanilla bean & chocokate ghiradelli. The chocolate had chocolate chunks in it but the vanillabean was bombdotcom. Dessert for lunch is a must"
Angela P.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,111,55,1.0,11/12/2015,"There should not be a 30 min wait when half the restaurant is empty, please hire more servers if need be. I went to a bar booth and patiently waited for someone to notice. After 5 mins, someone plopped down menus at my table and I had to grab her attention before she could quickly walk away to ask for a drink. To top it off our entrees came out before the appetizer and at this point I was just over it. No apologies, no discount, bad service."
Kandee H.,"San Diego, CA",115,146,417,3.0,2/2/2014,"Updating my review based on the last two times I've been here. They have happy hour during game days at the bar area.  First of all the food is great as usual...that I have no complaints about.   The beginning of our lengthy stay at BJ's for both the play off games and Super bowl started out great, good service in the beginning and when our server left for the day we cashed out and our server informed the next server that we would be staying for the game.  That is when everything went down hill and we didn't get any service at the bar area.  During play offs we had to wave someone down to ask them where our server was...then the server barely came by our table.   But today was the worst....we were ignored...there was a server in our area serving everyone else, walked by or table multiple times and never said a word. Not even a ""hey, you girls doing ok, is someone helping you, can I get you anything?""... From the beginning of the national anthem to half time no service, we ended up having to go to the bar to order or food and drinks.  My friend ended up telling management how dissatisfied we were.  Then we finally had someone come over but we already started a tab with the bartender and just went to the bar when needed.   The Bartender staff was verry friendly and helpful and when the food came out they had someone deliver it to our table.  I will still come back because the food is really good and I liked that they added gluten free pizza to the happy hour menu.  Hopefully they will train the wait staff better.  If this was my first time here I wouldn't come back...Just letting you know to step up your game people..."
Julia T.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,41,4,5.0,6/4/2015,"LANA IS THE BEST!  Thank you for such personalized service during the peak of the rush, end of happy hour, line out the door, everyone running around and we never felt neglected. Fantastic food and great service!"
Lawrence H.,Italy,1075,88,81,4.0,2/16/2015,"The food was great, my wife had a steak and my sister in law had salmon. I just had a few drinks and I also of course I had to get a Pazookie! Whoop whoop!!! The waiter was nice and even applied my military discount without me even having to ask. I had the strawberry splash for my drink and it was ooooohhhh sooooo divine!!!!!!!!  BOO-YAH!!!"
