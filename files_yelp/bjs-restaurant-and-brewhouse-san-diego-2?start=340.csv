Alex R.,"Stockton, CA",10,50,54,5.0,1/16/2016,"BJ's never fails! Always good food great service. The location is perfect, it is located next to Hazard Center movie theater. Which makes for a great date night. There house brews are great beers and the selection of beers are wide for any taste."
Leah W.,"San Diego, CA",64,65,4,1.0,3/19/2016,Food is super bland. Apparently you have to ask for silverware and napkins. I'm pretty sure our server quit part way through our meal because another server had to close us out. This is the second time we've been here and I'm pretty certain we won't be back.
Jascha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",163,35,133,3.0,4/5/2014,Place looked clean & very bright. Lots of TVs in every corner.  Came here on a Friday night to get my late night grub on.  Despite the multitude of restaurants to choose from in the Mission Valley area some friends and I decided to give the new BJs location a try.  To satisfy my carnivorous cravings I had a BJs burger. I got it with bacon and cheese and it was delicious! Cooked very well. To satisfy my sweet tooth I had the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. We got the medium size which was perfect for 2-3 people. The cookie melts in your mouth. Probably one of my favorite desserts.  Double yums! All in all it was a typical chain restaurant experience. The food quality and  the ambiance were pretty much what I expect from a BJs.
Danielle R.,"Elk Grove, CA",21,23,19,2.0,2/20/2015,"When we arrived half of the dining area was empty. We are a family of 6 and requested a booth. There were 6 empty booths and they refused to put us in one because they ""didn't have a server for that area."" Really?! That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. People please do your job and stop trying to make everyone make it more convenient for you!"
Mysterial S.,"San Diego, CA",26,110,102,5.0,2/16/2014,Well after my bfs and I first attempt to try this place...it was pretty appalling...we were compensated to try this place again...its been almost a month... Here's the update... we made a personal note to the manager Stephanie that we were there and I was pretty shocked that she remembered us! (Not many mgrs from experience do) so kudos to that...have a great feeling that she really did care and made sure our evening was the best Our server Justin..now he really went out of the way for us and honestly was just over the top with all his customers...really has a genuine attitude and seeked to make sure things were prefect and prompt...Justin you were just phenomenal and outstanding...you stand out like a gem and ur service was very meaningful to my bf and I :-) personal thank you again...one tiny thing...even though we know it was busy...a lil more conversation would have been nice but again it was pretty busy for a Sunday night (no biggie) Parking can be a pain in the butt especially if you don't have a compact car ....grr size discrimination!!  Onto the food...got the same thing we ordered beers were just awesome as usual The appetizer (which was amix of everything) cooked and fresh...enjoyed the dip more than anything bf enjoyed the chicken rolled taco things.. My cali burger came out just surprisingly delish and no cheese paper (yay) my bfs burger with the jalapenos..was good Lastly ee had dessert white chocolate macadamia pazzookie Y...U...M..!!!! We enjoyed our food inside the dining this time....outdoor was crowded this evening The inside dining was like any other place with lots of ppl chatting and enjoying the food.... So been given this place another try...highly satisfied with the customer service and the food being exceptionally delicious...great work to the management Stephanie it's hard work but you are a good manager and server's like  Justin and Bonnie work very hard and it shows they got the drive to succeed customers expectations.. We'll be back!!! :-)
Laura C.,"San Diego, CA",753,401,3473,2.0,3/9/2015,Live near this location and wanted to love it BUT not the case. It was Mardi Gras. This was our 2nd stop. The hostesses looked panicked like where they should seat us with a baby in a swing. Well we got sat in the middle of an aisle. It was very loud there. Every table was filled so I thought great this place looks good. Nope. There were no silver wear or napkins on our table. We had to ask for them after we ordered our drinks. A food server brought out our appetizer with our dessert at the same time. The dessert was ice-cream so it started to melt. We had to tell our waiter. Felt rushed. Then another food server young guy looked confused and dropped off a dessert with a lit candle in it and said it's for you from your waiter. He looked confused and literally walked fast away. We were like what?? Then our waiter came back and said oh that's a mistake grabbed it and put it on the table behind us to a couple. It was melting and they ate it. I didn't feel like we had the best service and it was all awkward. Will not be going back here again. 2 stars is for the avocado rolls and wine.
Tim M.,"San Diego, CA",4,37,3,1.0,6/28/2016,"My wife and I love BJ's but unfortunately this is the first time we had a bad experience. It was not with their food (delicious pizza, burgers and beer) but with their service... After we were seated it took our waitress a really long time to come back to take our order. We were out on the patio with one other table and it was a really slow afternoon. After the waitress finally took our order, she stuck around outside and chatted with the other table. We assumed they were friends but quickly realized they were also employees as their conversations were loud and work related. Really? Is the patio the new break room? It was obvious our food just stood there for a while when it was ready as it came to our table cold. Everything took so long that we finished our drinks pretty early on, my wife said excuse me multiple times to the waitress ( as she was talking to the other table AGAIN ) until she got her attention to ask for a refill. She never came to check up on us and when she did, it felt as though it was inconvenient for her. I typically don't mind driving a long distance since we don't live close to a BJ's but this experience was a real bummer..."
Noelani Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,6,1.0,9/26/2016,"Some of the worst service I have ever received. Went in on a Monday night and the place was empty so we thought it'd be a quick dinner. Little did we know what was about to happen. First off we asked nicely three times for refills and still didn't get it. Waiting 30 minutes from ordering for just the appetizer. Appetizer came along with the dinner but then waited to be given tableware. By the way we still haven't received any refills at this point and our waitress was nowhere to be found. I never ask for a manager but this time it was required. I walked to the front asked for a manager. She came to our table, we explained to her what was going on and she said she'd fix it. We asked her for refills and she came back with 2 of the 3 that we needed. She did give us a free pizzooka but failed to bring us the third refill. As for the food, it was warm but plates were burning hot which means it was sitting under the heater for a while.  I used to go here often but NEVER and I repeat NEVER will go here again! Not only was the waitress slow but the manager didn't do well fixing the issue."
Elisabeth Z.,"Anaheim, CA",57,3,,1.0,8/1/2016,"I usually love this place, but this particular location is ridiculous. Came on Sunday around 5 and went up to the rude hostess to get a table for two.  The place was empty for the most part and there was probably 2 parties ahead of us. The hostess stated that if we wanted to sit in the dinning area we would have to wait 20 minutes or so because there are no servers clocking on until 530. What kind of bullshit answer is that?! This is a restaurant, how can you not have any servers available?!  It was slow enough to have at least one server start the drinks while we waited for the rest of the servers to ""clock"" on.  So we decided to wait because we really wanted to eat here. I went to use the restroom and on my walk to the restroom I saw nothing but dirty tables and crap all over the floor from previous customers that had not been picked up. Went into the restroom and it had a very disgusting odor and was very dirty.  I immediately lost my appetite, so we left and went to WoodRanch Grill in the same shopping center. That place was delicious and to my surprise, had servers!  Thanks for the huge disappointment BJ's!"
TD W.,"San Diego, CA",16,160,90,5.0,2/27/2015,"Love BJ's its my fav!! The flat breads, pizza, appetizers and whatever else they have!! The drinks are good as well!! Get everything!!"
Ashley W.,"Encinitas, CA",73,45,4,4.0,3/4/2015,"I am a huge fan of BJ's Brewhouse, in general. The food is consistently good, I love beer and the service is always pretty good, too. With that being said, with every chain, you encounter the ""good"" ones and the ""bad"" ones. As in, you will drive past three Denny's in order to get to the ""good"" one. At least, I'm one of those people. This was my first time at this specific location. And it was GREAT! I brought my little brother and sister (brother is of drinking age) and it was their first time. It was a really good experience overall. Our waiter was pretty busy but still attentive and very sweet. Our food was prompt and delicious. The ambiance is nice and mellow. I felt like I could lounge there all day and no one would care. Who has time for that, though? lol The seating could have the promise of being a little crowded if it had been busier but while i was there, it was busy but without the claustrophobic feeling of too many bodies in one area. I had the Chicken Pesto sandwich (I know, super simple) but it was extremely delicious! We also had the Avocado rolls which were amazing, as well. Since my brother and I were drinking beer, it was nice for my little sister to have the option of a ""fancy"" virgin drink to make her feel included.  Overall, a wonderful experience!"
Villie T.,"Chicago, IL",101,27,45,5.0,1/1/2014,"I just got back from visiting this location for the first time with some friends. And if felt obligated to write this review before I fall into a serious food coma.  I'm wiring this on behalf of how friendly the staff is. The hosts were sweet and inviting and our server, Ramon, was beyond excellent. He was friendly, funny, and not at all overbearing. He was also very efficient, especially for how busy it was. But he was on top of everything and made us laugh. They were out of a few things but he offered substitutions for them and we didn't mind.  We had the fries, caster salad, mini bruschetta, chicken flatbread, boneless chicken, and some chicken pasta thing. It was all very good. Yah, we had a feast. And of course we made room for the pizookie because well-- how could you not?"
Maria F.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,1,1.0,6/19/2016,"We frequent BJs. Today we went to this one and was quoted a 20-25min wait. 30 minutes later still waiting, so I checked to see where we were in the list. The hostess said 20 more minutes. I told her we were told 20-25 minutes and she said, ""Actually you were told 30 minutes."" I told her, ""Actually I wasn't, I was told 20-25minutes, it doesn't matter because I'm leaving and will not be returning."" And left. Terrible customer service."
Tish L.,"San Diego, CA",0,13,,2.0,8/2/2015,"Had a work get together here. The waitress put our drinks down and knocked off a glass and of course it fell on the new boots I bought. I was trying not to freak out in front of my coworkers and supervisor. 'Oh, it's okay!! Don't worry about it!!' And now here I am putting my three cents in it!! Maybe the waitress could have given us off a drink or something for the damage, but no. Just an apology. Ladies, you feel my pain. 2 stars is pushing it.  The drinks, filled with more sugar than alcohol which broke my heart!  The food is decent.  The restaurant itself is a nice setting.  Parking is tight."
Danny C.,"Escondido, CA",190,8,,5.0,4/1/2016,"Thanks to Trevor and Mckenzie for a great night. Came for a couple of beers with a buddy, and had a great time joking around with both of them. Excellent service. Thanks you two!"
Crystal B.,"San Diego, CA",25,5,4,2.0,12/31/2014,"I love bjs menu and their food and although my waitress was polite we've been sitting for over an hour and have not received any food. we made a reservation for 15 @ 8, we're seated at 8:30 and it's now 9:15 without orders taken ... The only reason we have drinks (which were delicious) is because we went to the bar ourselves. I know it's new year's eve but I  would have rather had a caterer come only bc we were on a time constraint of betting downtown by 10:00. Just disappointed in the time things were Executed."
Ekaterina O.,"San Diego, CA",54,5,7,5.0,4/13/2016,"Great manager Stephanie and waiter  James, they know how to make customers happy, no matter what. Nice, polite ant friendly. Will come back here for sure."
Jose Larry P.,"San Diego, CA",190,11,10,4.0,6/4/2015,Celebrated a friends graduation. Overall good experience. I ordered their sirloin steak which was on point. Rest of the party was pretty happy with their food as well. Good family spot.
AM G.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,2,1.0,9/8/2015,"My girlfriend and I try our very best to develop an objective view of a restaurant or business.  Since BJ's Brewhouse is fairly close, we wanted to make it work by trying the Sunday brunch, lunch menu, and dinner menus over the course of several visits. After each visit, we just could not find the silver lining. Although the wait staff is always friendly, service from getting water, to appetizers, to main courses has repeatedly been slow. Sometimes 10 minutes go by before drink orders are taken and most times food takes 30-40 minutes.  The food, is another issue. The stuffed mushrooms and calamari are better choices as they are not as greasy as the rest of the appetizer choices. However, the last visit, the calamari was burnt. The main entrees, from house salads to enlightened choices, to pizza, or whatever your choice may be, comes out consistently inconsistent. Sometimes undercooked, sometimes burnt, sometimes so salty that even after scrapping a layer of seasoning off of your grilled chicken dishes ( yes, a layer of seasoning actually peels off the chicken) you are left trying to find something to combat the saltiness.  To be fair, we have not tried desert, but the reviews on that seem to be consistent with what we have experienced. In the end, it is a great place to find decent beers, but don't go there hungry for good food. You may find yourself waiting only to be marginally satisfied with mediocre food."
Marygrace G.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,8,5.0,3/20/2016,Review is long overdue. Came here on Feb 14th with my friend for dinner after the movies. Food was great and service was amazing! Mark Anthony was our server and he was friendly and attentive. He was engaging and warm. I always eat at BJ's but never had service as wonderful as Mark Anthony. Keep up the great work!
