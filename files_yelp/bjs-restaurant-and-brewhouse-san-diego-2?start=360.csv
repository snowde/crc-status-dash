Will L.,"Auckland, New Zealand",0,14,25,3.0,7/1/2015,Service and food are ok. Average value for money. Must not have a high expectation for this place.
Jackie S.,"San Diego, CA",106,34,29,3.0,3/22/2015,"Went for dinner had their brussel sprouts as a side, man they sucked. I havnt been here in awhile but usually like their food. I was expecting sprouts with butter or olive oil on them and they seemed like they were steamed then charred with pepper.  But the appetizers were good and steak was good. Id come back but get no sprouts. If u want good brussel sprouts go to urban brewery in elcajon."
D L.,"San Diego, CA",0,36,,5.0,10/5/2016,"Met a friend at BJ's today and we shared a Asian Chicken Salad with a Pizza. It was the best ever!! The salad was fresh and the chicken cooked perfectly. The pizza was very, very good. I think it's our new go to place for lunch."
James F.,"Puyallup, WA",14,5,1,4.0,6/30/2015,"I had their Parm Chicken which is nice and crispy, not too heavy and has good flavor.  That wasn't the best part of the meal.  Our server was very attentive, not annoying and interacted really well with our kids.  She made it an enjoyable meal. Would be happy to go back with the whole family."
Anthony M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,4,,1.0,9/15/2014,"Was there yesterday for the chargers game got there at 10:00 am, the GM and Manger should be fired, service was slow, food was cold, drinks (what drinks) 35-40 minute wait at the bar, the staff that was there did a great job, but was clearly frustrated because they were so under staffed, I asked what was the problem and I was told they did not expect a crowd of this size and the manger did not staff correctly. lets see ? chargers home opener, super bowl champs in town, ??? I was very surprised because BJ's is a great place, but do not go to pre game or you may miss the game waiting to get served,  The bar was so far behind that they were making drinks for people who all ready left,"
david s.,"San Diego, CA",64,189,34,4.0,2/20/2015,"I was going to give them a 3 but the happy hour specials were awsome! Service was slow, mostly due to under staffing. Quite understandable but at times was nerve wrecking. Never did get my water refill, but the food and beer special ecliped all that. The fruit beer was bomb. The wings were great. The cali flatbread was kick ass. The calimari was tender and flavorful with 2 sauces. Tons of TV's and nice decor.  The atmosphere is kinda upscale, tons of dudes in dress shirts and chics in heels. BUT if you have a good buzz and some game, i see you and the misses hitting it off in the mens room, because it is so deserted, lol."
Morgan B.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,2.0,3/14/2017,"This was really disappointing. I've been to this location a few times, and generally it's busy. This time, it wasn't too crowded so I hoped that service would be better. Our order was messed up twice. The second time, our waitress Mariah already seemed done with us so she told us to wait and to see if our order really was incorrect. I understand the servers don't make the food. But, she seemed more pissed that we were unsatisfied versus the fact that our food was messed up several times. One of our orders was good and correct, but she told us it was barely big enough for  a two people when the two of us could barely finish it. I aIso ordered a drink I received last time, and it was terribly oversweetened, I couldn't even finish it. I won't be back to this location any time soon. The house manager shot us a dirty look as we left, I'm assuming since we complained about the food several times. Very unsatisfied. Giving two stars because the good food we had was good"
Vickie M.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,,5.0,9/29/2016,"I went to dinner with a friend at about 6pm on 9/29 and received exceptional service from our server Jason S. (#179). Jason was very friendly and had just the right amount of service too where he wasn't absent and he never hovered, he was perfect! Our drinks never emptied and he have great menu suggestions!"
Patrick M.,"San Diego, CA",352,56,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Worst service ever, I have food allergy with onions and lettuce, which give me breathing problem. I explain it to the waitress when I order my hamburger. Then she serve me the food with the onions stick inside the patty with lettuce on it. She didn't even care that it give me problems oh she never came around to ask for refills or ask how our food is. What a heartless careless waitress. Worst experience ever, don't come here if you have allergy, they don't care if it cause you problems or anything, this is the worst BJ I've been to"
T. R.,"San Diego, CA",3,24,15,5.0,2/22/2016,Just Had lunch and ordered a pizza. Unfortunately the wrong pizza came out. Bonnie our waitress was very apologetic. Not only fixing it right away but giving us a discount. Then just before we left she brings out a complementary pazzookie! Talk about going over and above. So nice and she was busy too. Looked like the only one working both in the bar area and outside. Still managed to be very nice and really give great service. Way to go Bonnie!
Memeow R.,"San Diego, CA",6,25,6,3.0,9/13/2014,"Went out with a group of friends. The service was fairly attentive. We started with some appetizers the calamari  is nice and comes with the tentacles. For the main course I got the Santa Fe styled salad and some others got pasta, a steak another appetizer and a sandwich. The food did not all come out together which is weird. Two items came out then one more. The server said the steak would be a few more minutes but the salad was MIA and no words were said about how long it would take.  The salad arrived a few minutes before the steak came out. Working in the industry I just thought it was extremely unprofessional to have the food come out at all different times.  Not sure why the salad took almost as long as a medium well steak.  Atmosphere isn't bad  Food is middle range Prices are fair"
R B.,"San Diego, CA",0,143,6,2.0,1/25/2016,"We went there on Saturday, waiting time was not bad , well the server forgot our silverware but he gave it to us right away once we asked Service was actually pretty good  the thing that was not going well was the food we ordered the BJ favorite pizza, it was cold.... well we were hungry so we didnt really care too much  but paying decent amounts of money for a pizza that was cold....we would rather buy those frozen pizza and heat it up at home :( Super disappointed :("
Henry C.,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",16,15,10,2.0,4/4/2015,"Honestly, service is good. It's a good deep dish at best. Wings are great. But overall I paid for meal I did not enjoy. The Chilli is of poor taste. In NYC, this wouldn't be doing too well."
Shaina H.,"San Diego, CA",76,112,491,5.0,12/14/2013,"This place is new and the service is great! I went here early in the morning and obviously was one of the first customers here, but our waiter attended to us very well. I tried the berry omelette(?) and it was super small, so I don't recommend getting that for $7.95, but the usual breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon (usual breakfast...) was good! Would recommend for its price and service."
Anna O.,"San Diego, CA",1,8,8,1.0,11/17/2015,"Pretty disappointed with our experience here.  Came in for the 2 for $25 deal since it said there was a gluten free ""deal"" but the ""deal"" cost more than if we just ordered the Gf pizza, salads, and pazookie by itself.  How in the world do they expect 2 people to share a small, single serve pizza?? The ""deal"" makes no sense for the Gf option and there is way cheaper Gf pizza (and better tasting) around SD.  So after going through that and still ordering 2 Gf pizzas, salad and dessert they serve my salad with croutons, left toppings off my pizza, and the toppings that I did ordered were concentrated to only one section of the pizza.   Literally had to shred the ham around the pie myself.  If you are looking for Gf pizza in SD please check out pizza port or ANYWHERE ELSE but here."
Richie A.,"Manchester, WA",11,240,26,4.0,3/30/2015,"I did lunch . . . Compared to fast food they do have fair comparable menu without the extra goo you get with fast food Did the all you can eat salad & soup . . . BLT salad was good - fresh ingredients . . . Soup was ok ( I grade soups on a very high scale ) Would I eat here again : yes Would I try dinner here . . . Sorry but No - menu to me looked like heavy comfort food . . . Nothing is wrong with that from time to time but if I want the "" good "" gooey bliss I feel there better options. Note : finger food / lite evening snack w/ adult beverage option(s) - I would try - perhaps 1 / 3 of the menu favors this eating option"
Heather F.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",100,109,5,3.0,8/30/2014,I have a love hate relationship with BJS I LOVE their crust. And their tortilla soup. I do go here a good amount.  The service staff is 50/50.   You get someone great or someone who dosent care and forgets to check on you. I can't give them more than 3 stars because of the service and an allergy issue I specified no blu cheese. I'm allergic Wings came. And there it was Ordered pizookie. You can't really see the small cookie under the Ice cream and it's a good thing my friends sampled it first as it was not peanut butter. It was macadamia nut.    I had also informed them of this allergy. The waitress apologized over and over.   The manager checked to see if I was ok and walked off. It seemed like no big deal  I had to call and complain to feel like someone knew the importance of this mistake.     They sent me   A gift card but only after I complained loudly.      Great pizza.   So so service  Just be careful if you have allergies!!
Roman L.,"San Diego, CA",27,7,2,3.0,11/27/2015,Good restoraunt bit service note good menu on table no platse so i can say this plase just for chill and spend time
Ian S.,"La Mesa, CA",0,15,,5.0,8/27/2016,"Been to a few of their locations, and this was by far my favorite. The food tends to be the same between locations (always tasty from start to pizookie) but service was fantastic here. Our server JD who was friendly, quick, checked in often and precise with requests. Plus we had two servers who were not our own stop and pick up toys when my 7 month old son would drop them. We will definitely be back!"
Janet G.,"Mission Hills, San Diego, CA",43,29,10,2.0,8/2/2015,"Horrible service, we've been waiting for our food for over 45 minutes. When we asked our waitress to check up on our soup that should have came out first she never bothered to come back and give us an update, I asked for coffee and it's been 20 minutes and I haven't gotten a refill, pretty sure she knows she's messing up because she's avoiding our table. People behind us our complaining on time as well. My advice is follow up with your table answer their questions and concerns. Don't just leave your table in the dark while they wait so long. Big turn off. Don't think we will come back."
