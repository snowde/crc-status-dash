Reba B.,"San Diego, CA",201,255,67,1.0,7/16/2014,"Do you like to eat glass? Oh, you don't?? Don't go here then! I came with three friends and was having a good time when I noticed something sticking out of my mashed potatoes. Inspecting it closer I realized it was glass!!! Seriously?? Thank god I noticed it before I ate it, which honestly I don't know how I did because it was clear and mixed up into mashed potatoes!! I let the manager know and his response was to comp the meal (obviously!!! Thanks for the free glass!) and give two free pizookies for the table. Hmmm. Thanks. Added on to that my friends boyfriend never even received his appetizer and I could not have been less impressed with this place. They're clearly very careless here. Unless I'm feeling suicidal I will not be back."
C A.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/10/2016,"Poor service. Poor food. Waitress was slow & waited 10 minutes before anyone came by to get drink orders. Ordered two salads & one was completely wrong & the other had random ingredients not listed on the menu. After mentioning it to the waitress, she told her manager, Helena, who then took our salads, made us new ones & charged us for both wrong salads & both right salads even though we didn't request they be remade. Appetizers weren't great either."
Neil T.,"San Diego, CA",626,70,206,5.0,8/1/2014,"I've been here a bunch of times and each time it hasn't disappointed.  I usually get takeout and their staff is really friendly and make me feel welcomed every time I go there.  I've tried just about all their kids meals and it is totally worth the price. I usually order to go and their takeout staff is awesome. They do have some good lunch specials starting at $5.99, I recommend the BBQ Platter if you like BBQ stuff.  Unlimited soup and salad is a great deal also.  All in all, this is a nice restaurant and brewhouse if you enjoy food and beer."
Ashley M.,"Coronado, San Diego, CA",181,14,,1.0,1/3/2016,We ordered for pick up the other day. I ordered strawberry lemonade.. they had none. A specific type of fry..they were out...and my chicken tenders were raw. Ruined my entire meal.
Keiko T.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/7/2016,I was there on 5/6 Friday around 11:30pm This place is bad especially the one of server behind the bar. She never came to us how we doing or need something else ?? Only she was doing was cleaning the bar area and making the drink without wash the hand. And especially when I order drink she said She doesn't recommend... Nice. But I just order from the menu well somebody need to retraining her from first. I just wanna say she wasn't professional at all only thing was her mouth was talking to customer for nothing.
Carissa R.,"La Mesa, CA",6,1,,1.0,10/17/2015,I'm giving this place 1 star for a couple reasons. Everytime I come here something goes wrong. But today was the last straw. I came in and sat at a table in the bar area with my friend. It took us 15mins just to get a menu. Then our waitress BRIDGETTE didn't apologize for us waiting so long. After that it was pretty much a waiting game to see if she was going to help us or drop off any requests that we had. She wasn't really nice she never apologized once about anything and basically seemed like she didn't want to help us. She never came by to ask if we were doing okay or if we needed anything as we watched her serve all her other tables with smile. It almost seemed like there was something about us she didn't like. Needless to say we walked out without tipping her. I might as well have waited on myself. Extremely disappointed.
Harrison M.,"San Diego, CA",27,47,,1.0,7/2/2014,"Great place if you are a buddy of the staff.  Otherwise you are on your own.   This is my second visit to this restaurant where the staff were more interested in visiting with their buddies than in serving people.  The first time I waited it out, this time after 15 minutes I walked. In the second instance, she visited with a couple who were also possibly employees talking about their weekend plans.  She then wandered off and hung out by the servers station with another waiter giggling.  I watched as other tables tried to flag her down.   No luck.  I ended up having pizza at Luigi's on El Cajon.  In/Out 30 minutes and they were very nice. They should opena make your own pizza station so the clients could help each other. Sadly, I like their pizza. Maybe  the La Jolla site."
Phil A.,"San Diego, CA",24,40,9,4.0,9/28/2014,"Went here for the first time so far for a happy hour. The beer prices are great ($4 for each BJ's craft beer) and also the wings seemed like a good deal, $4 for plate of wings. I wasn't expecting only 4 wings to come out on it though...I realize it's only $4 but still... The beer is good but it'd be nice to see some local beers on the happy hour list too. I will be coming back however as the deep dish pizza was fantastic!"
Katherine L.,"Gardena, CA",464,14,102,3.0,8/3/2014,You can never go wrong with pizookies.  The only thing was how long it took to get waters.  It's a hot day and yeah it sucks sometimes when a table takes up one of your sections just for dessert but you should show how irritated you are about getting us as your guests...at least we saved you from doing your whole spiel on specials or drinks for the day.  I was in the service industry for years and I still welcomed guest that wanted just desserts. I mean you are still getting a tip.
Rana R.,"San Diego, CA",100,303,410,4.0,7/8/2014,"The word ""Pizookie Trio"" should be enough to warrant a 4-5 star rating for BJ's. Their decadent dessert can never be imitated and I can never get sick of it since they keep adding different flavors! It's pretty much my go to restaurant if I can't decide on where to go. They have really great menu options without overwhelming the customers. Their beer selection is excellent for a ""chain"" establishment. This location in Mission Valley is oddly placed and looks small from afar, but it's definitely not small. I love their outdoor patio, it's elegant and even has a fire pit for those ""cold"" SD nights. The place overall is clean & majority of the staff members were smiling. The layout of the dining area was spacious, props to whoever designed the flow of the restaurant cause it's a lot more spacious than the one in Chula Vista. In the words of Yelp, ""Yay! I'm fan!"""
Grace C.,"La Mesa, CA",0,7,,5.0,10/13/2015,The bbq pulled pork burger is so good. And there is literally no better dessert than a pizookie. This location is great and has plenty of parking. The servers are always fast and friendly. And their menu is extensive. Something for everyone.
Ciara S.,"San Diego, CA",215,5,2,3.0,2/8/2016,"Came here tonight to eat with my 2 friends and I, we got seated and ordered promptly. I ordered a ""classic burger"" when it came it had no dressing at all which made me upset cause I've been to this BJ's multiple times and I enjoy the environment but just having to pay $11.25 for a burger that was dry without any dressing was upsetting. I asked the waiter for mayonnaise and he seemed upset about it like I was a burden. I understand it was about 11pm but I just expected more since I've been here a lot. Other then that a waitress helped us out after the gentleman didn't come back, she was very nice and made sure we were taken care of. These 3 stars are for you great service for the waitress."
Brian J.,"Elmont, NY",5,3,4,4.0,10/11/2014,"Great food, decent service.  Had the bone-in New York steak.  Have to say this was one of the best steak I've had in a while.  The prices are average, $25 for most entrees and it was $17 for a pitcher of a good ipa.  My only complaint was that everyone except for one bus boy were really fake and/or sarcastic.  Would recommend it simply based on the selection of craft beers."
Erin L.,"Tempe, AZ",0,21,,2.0,4/24/2016,"While I'm grateful I can eat late, I'm underwhelmed by food and service. When I'm checking out the menu, I don't want to be greeted with ""so do you know what you want?"" That is NOT hospitality. My salad was pretty bad and the server didn't seem to care. My drink sat totally empty three times. Also, ""sure"" is never an acceptable response to a request. I served for 10 years and ""sure"" just screams indifference. If you don't care about my dining experience then I do not care about your tip. The only positive thing tonight was that they were open, although I'm not sure it's any better than a drive thru. I will not be back to this location. Yikes guys!"
Gina H.,"Ramona, CA",132,108,67,3.0,7/23/2015,"Mom and I actually had intended on going to Cheesecake Factory.   Dad's in the hospital and mom's rattled.  So I picked her up from Memorial and thought a good dinner would make things better.   Parking was impossible at Fashion Valley cheesecake factory so we ended up at BJ's.  Horrific name.  How can you go there with a straight face?  That aside, mom had never been.  The hostesses were very friendly and seated us right away. I ordered sirloin with a salad and asparagus  for 15.50.  Mom got the loaded burger with shoestring fries. Both meals were delicious.   I wish that there would have been more asparagus on my plate.  It was a little sparse.  I was definitely not over full when we left.  Can't say that about mom.  Her dinner was served on a metal lunch tray thing.  She powered through most of it, though I stole a few fries. It's noisy there.  Really noisy.  I hate ambient noise so it was a little rough for me.  Other than the noise and lack of asparagus,  it was a good meal.  Not spectacular.   Maybe like a pricey Denny's.   I have tried the beer previously and liked it."
Paul T.,"Tustin, CA",5,55,7,5.0,12/6/2015,"We love the BJ's. Came down from orange for the chargers game and decided to stop here. Sam W killed it with the service. We Had to rush because we had a meeting to get to and Sam was prompt - on time with everything. Thank you again guys, you never disappoint."
Daniel S.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/25/2016,"Good food, good beer, good atmospheres. Pizza took a little long to come out. The wait staff are always nice and cheery."
Lauren H.,"San Diego, CA",4,32,13,3.0,7/25/2015,"Went here with bae and a friend of mine. I loved the potato skins appetizer. It's a must have and was a great way to start the meal. I ordered the fish and chips, which was a mistake. It was over-cooked and not something I will be ordering again. I loved the pizza too. Deep dish was nice. :) I would go again. The service was great too!"
Renee S.,"San Diego, CA",1,4,,2.0,2/28/2015,"I'd only ever come here to order their Triple Chocolate Pizookie. Their food and alcoholic beverages are over priced for what you really get. The quality of their food is not very impressive either.  Their service is hit or miss.  Also, I would never order their Tomato Bisque unless you want a bowl of oily spaghetti sauce."
Steven D.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,3,2.0,2/1/2016,Don't order the steak. I order a medium sirloin that came out almost well done. Honestly I could've cooked it better at home. Same thing with the burgers. Maybe the location is the wrong one to come to. No problems with any other BJ's I've been to. Just the Frazee road location. This is the second and last time this happens. What a shame. Thank goodness the server/bartender was good looking and a sweetheart.
