Erika P.,"Corona, CA",74,19,3,1.0,11/18/2017,We went to celebrate my brother's new job and the service was so horrible that he walked out before we even got our food. I called the manager and she said she would mail us a meal ticket and we never received it. Smh.
April S.,"San Diego, CA",57,11,24,1.0,10/27/2017,Took an hour for one appetizer to come out (burnt and gross) and then 45 minutes for dessert after. Then another half hour to get them to cash us out. The servers purposely avoid eye contact to do work and I saw one hostess kick food scraps under a table. Gross.
Cristina V.,"La Mesa, CA",2,37,31,4.0,8/31/2017,"Service sometimes a bit slow but that's because they are always pack no matter the location! The food is good, the lar dish I had was amazing! This place is great to have dinner with family or friends!!"
Jin L.,"San Diego, CA",77,77,10,3.0,2/6/2017,"First things first, don't get the big sampler appetizer thing. It comes with avocado eggrolls, chicken, mozzarella sticks, spinach & artichoke dip, and maybe something else I'm not remembering? Well you won't have to know since you won't get it since I told you not to get it (haha!) because it was super underwhelming. The chicken and mozzarella sticks are for sure from the frozen food aisle of Costco, avocado eggrolls tasted meh, and so did the spinach & artichoke dip. The food was kind of cold as well, what a waste of money.  If you do come here, get the deep dish pizza. BJ's cooks the crust quite well! The crust is crispy and has enough oil saturated in it to make it moist. Dry crust is a chore to eat, always need water since thirst overwhelms your desire to eat more crust. Not a problem here. If I had the pizza itself, maybe this place would be a four star establishment, but the disappointment from the appetizer dish was pretty big."
Chloe M.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,4,5.0,11/16/2017,"Food is always great and the service here is truly the best, ever server is incredibly nice and accommodating."
Ellie K.,"New York, NY",0,5,,3.0,10/16/2017,"I go to this location often, and never had an issue until this past weekend when I decided to order through their curbside to-go. The girl who took my order was Janelle (spelling?) and she was unbelievably rude. I asked for an extra side of hot sauce for my wings, and when it appeared she had misunderstood, I repeated my request just for clarification. She proceeded to snap ""yes I'm going to get it now,"" and then (this is the part that blows my mind) rolled her eyes and shook her head IN MY FACE before storming to the kitchen. As someone who's worked in the service industry for 10+ years, I understand being stressed out during rush, and I even understand if you really need to vent by rolling your eyes and being nasty. But you do it privately in the back or at home, not in plain view of the customer. She ended this exchange by returning with my side and asking sarcastically if there was anything else I needed. The manager happened to come by (didn't get her name, but she had curly hair and glasses) and she was very pleasant and apologetic. She offered some pizookie coupons which was a nice gesture. I hope she spoke with Janelle about the situation -- she's not going to last long in the service industry if she keeps treating customers that way. Basic respect is a must. Anyway, this place has always been consistent with everything else in the past. Knocking off the stars for Janelle's poor service. Will probably be back in the future, and will hope for a better experience."
Cesar V.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/28/2017,"This place takes forever to bring out food, drinks, appetizers. Food isn't hot when they bring out. Food is mediocre. They walk by your table when there's obvious used tableware. Bad bad place. First and last bjs ill ever go to."
Joanna R.,"San Diego, CA",900,186,169,1.0,6/10/2016,"We have gone here on a Thursday night, around 10 or so, and it was super dead and slow. We sat at the bar, since it was happy hour. The plan was to grab a quick dinner before heading to incahoots... But that obviously didn't happen accordingly....  As we sat, our waiter asked us what we would like to drink. We got 2 beers, a wine, and a soda. Yes I know the bar sometimes lags, but not for 20 mins! So we waited and waited for our drinks to come, and finally they arrive! As soon as they arrived, we ordered appetizers and two mini deep dish pizzas (which were so good, by the way!), but that took 45 minutes to come out! I don't understand how the people next to us got their meals before we did, and we had ordered about 20 minutes before they did!  Half way eating through our pizzas, we decided to get another order of calamari.. (Which was probably a mistake!) Finally we finished our pizzas and our calamari still wasn't out! I guess they had delivered it to the wrong table, (which they still charged us for!)  Long story short- I love BJ's food, but I will not be returning to this location. The service was horrible and no one ever came to our table to see if we ever needed anything. Yes the next location is the Escondido one, which is a drive, but at least their food is bomb and their service is on point!"
Crissy L.,"San Diego, CA",5,110,102,5.0,8/16/2017,This has ALWAYS been one of my favorite locations! I have been eating at bjs since I first heard about them in 2009 I believe. when moving to San Diego I was happy this one was opening and have always has great customer service here! BUT TODAY was the best ANGELA and ANDY!!!! thank you sooo very much for going above and beyond what customer service should be! My son and I had a great lunch! Of course I will be back!
Cinnie T.,"San Diego, CA",144,123,1535,3.0,7/30/2016,"I still prefer the BJ's located at north county mall further up in Escondido since parking spaces are not as compacted as the lots here. However, this restaurant is still very nice and resembles all the other ones. The ambiance is loud but lively and dim inside.  FOOD: The food is good too, kinda reminds me of a higher-end TGI Fridays. Don't expect the ahi poke ($12) to be traditional poke, it's drenched in soy sauce. The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut since it was really doughy, but silly good. The chicken Alfredo ($16) is delicious!! But the chicken was dry.  SERVICE: Our waiter was very upbeat and friendly, but they do get pretty busy and forget to come around to check up on you from time to time. I'm not sure if it was because we came late at night, but three of the servers (including ours) were hanging out in the back tables gossiping/talking with their friend... Kinda unprofessional since I was trying to get his attention for the check like three times, but I guess they can do whatever they want.  **if you are celebrating your birthday: you get a free pazookie. Or if you are celebrating anything, just let your waiter know and they will usually give you a treat at the end!"
Ronald V.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/1/2017,"I have been to this location multiple times and this was the worst.  We just got there around 12:45pm and just put in our appetizer and drinks when one of the employees rudely yelled at us to quiet down. There was a loud table about 10-20 feet over and we were accused of this. This employee ended up being the GM Ryan Olivieri, I can't believe how unprofessional he was running up to our table. He literally looked like he had been drinking and when asked by our table if that was the case he replied ""I've been at work since 6am"" which was only about a 7 hour shift with a 30 minute break. Extremely unprofessional which sucks because our server was awesome.  Complete unprofessionalism from a manger, he needs some extra training."
Lisa G.,"Poway, San Diego, CA",823,403,3499,5.0,6/1/2016,"We had wonderful customer service from our one time here. We came on a Sunday night right before Memorial Day after we finished watching X-men. We had said we wanted to get a ""snack."" Which ended up being a craving for pizza and pizzokie. Our waitress told us about a special which we could get a salad, pizza and dessert. We were totally down for that.  We being- two girls and two guys - double date; both pairs got a choice of salad, us the house salad and them the caesar salad, a medium pizza to share (half half was a choice) and then the chocolate cookie with cookies & cream ice cream and cookies & cream whip cream on top for the pizzokie. For drinks, us ladies got the pear cider and the guys both got the snake bite. Pear cider was crisp and bubbly. It tasted the most similar to the pear cider I had at a farmers market back in NY, just more bubbly. The snake bite had a creamy taste with a sweet aftertaste as it also contains pear cider in it according to my boyfriend; to me however it still tasted bitter because of the stout. Total was around $80ish. Would not mind coming back if I was in the neighborhood - we had a lovely time and the restaurant people actually didnt kick us out when they closed. They close at 12."
Jasmine H.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,23,4.0,11/20/2017,"the food is really good but a little bit pricy for my taste. it's perfect if you come during their specials and use the app to get good deals, like a free pizookie for signing up! love the late hours which allows for hangouts after late classes, even on weekdays."
Terre H.,"San Diego, CA",35,14,2,5.0,11/18/2017,A favorite of ours!  Today we stopped in for a quick lunch. We Love the potato skins to share. I ordered the mozzarella tomato salad & my husband got a beer & the wedge salad !
Richard M.,"Mesa, AZ",14,21,4,1.0,9/23/2017,"I kinda liked BJ'S until today, had a wait to seat, about 15 min after we were seated behind a large group, we were forgotten about. I would say about 15-20 minutes more go by . So she went over to the waitress gathering point?? Not sure maybe it was a ordering station and asked for someone to wait on us. After a few more minutes a waitress came over and said it's not my table, she said that our waiter is real busy with the large group, but she can take our drink order. We gave her our order, which we were ready to place our food order after waiting such a long time, she said our waiter will be over when he can, clearly swamped with the large group, and she walked away to other tables to wait on. So Done not going back. EVER!"
Dustin B.,"National City, CA",16,372,122,5.0,2/5/2017,This place has a very large menu.  The food is generally okay.  It is pretty typical corporate food.   However the last time i went here the service was outstanding.  I would suggest this place to other based on how good the service was the last time i went here.   Thanks guys.
Lance L.,"San Jose, CA",126,40,4,2.0,7/13/2017,"There were three of us that went to BJ's.  At first, things went well, but here is where it failed. Our Portobello Mushroom Salad arrived late and after us having to ask for it. The Mini Pozolli (sp?) that we ordered didn't arrive till after we asked about it again. And then I noticed when i walked into the main seating area, the floors were extremely slippery. That tells me the floors were not being cleaned effectively, which could be an indication of other things that might be going on. Yes, it's a bit critical, but for somewhere I am paying for quality service, that is where i'm at."
Crawford S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Horrible service. I am generally easy going and understanding. I have worked in the food service industry and can relate to the problems that pop up suddenly. However, when I order a beer and have to remind the waiter 3 times, the friends I am with have ordered their  food twice and  have not received it 45 minutes later, while watching two other groups be seated and receive their orders....I get a bit irritated."
Christine K.,"San Diego, CA",1382,942,1673,1.0,4/29/2016,If it wasn't for the pizookie this place would burn. My fish and chips were disgusting. Very bland. My fries were unseasoned.  Nothing on the menu really catches my eye. I should have just tried a bread soup bowl.. You can't go wrong with soup right?
Bee ..,"San Diego, CA",28,12,,4.0,8/27/2017,"Love the food. The service is always good except one time. Friday night around 9pm a very snotty girl (medium height brown hair in layers white girl). She works in the front as a host, she is absolutely terrible, has no idea what customer service is. Aside her, everyone else serving is very nice. The environment is loud and always crowded."
