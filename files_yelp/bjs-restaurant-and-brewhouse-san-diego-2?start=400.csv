Johnna H.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,1,5.0,10/5/2014,"My boyfriend and I had such an amazing dinner tonight at BJs. We ate out on the patio while watching the football game. We had Alexis as our server, she was friendly and made great suggestions which we loved! You have to try to S'mores pizzokie, it's fantastic. Thank you Alexis for the exceptional service."
Brittåny Z.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",7,59,4,1.0,12/6/2015,"The staff here is incompetent. My husband and I were quoted ""a few minutes"" so a table could be cleared off. 20 minutes later we were still waiting. I went up to the head hostess and I said I would like to take my name off the list. We were quoted a few minutes and we are still waiting. And the hostess looked at me and said ok thanks bye. I called to speak to a manager and waited on hold for 5 minutes and just hung up. Save yourself the time and go to Wood Ranch it's in the same Peking lot the staff is better and so is the food."
Adrena R.,"Tustin, CA",51,44,16,5.0,12/6/2015,"Sam W is AWESOME. We came in after the Charger game tonight and sat on the patio. Our drinks were never below half way and we had refills, we were on a time crunch and he made sure we were out in time. Sam W needs a raise and a management position. Ask to sit in his section and you will be very impressed."
Ryan C.,"San Diego, CA",12,5,,3.0,1/5/2016,Often go here with friends and family but this recent visit was okay. Granted we had a big group but some of the staff need to be more professional. Yes we can hear you gripe and complain and see you make a face.
Thao N.,"San Diego, CA",25,38,110,2.0,5/16/2014,"I've been to the location in Grossmont before and the food & service was always great! However, this location made me feel like I should've went to Lazy Dog instead..  I was in the mood for something small and light so I looked at their happy hour deals and none of it really stood out to me, which made me think I really should've went down the street to Lazy Dog instead. Nonetheless, we ordered the California(?) flatbread, I can't recall the name, but it had chunks of tomatoes, avocados and grilled chicken with a tangy white sauce, and the Tuscan Chicken Limone pasta dish. It took about 15 mins for this tiny dish to come and the restaurant wasn't even busy at all. I noticed our server was walking extremely slow to our table like he was just taking a nice walk in the park. Thank goodness the food made up for it because the flatbread was delicious! The ingredients all seemed very fresh without being too heavy.  The pasta dish finally came and that's when we realized they never gave us our utensils or napkins. We flagged down a waiter and that's when the girl who was originally our waitress came by and dropped off our utensils without even apologizing and didn't bother to look at us. I'm not sure whether they didn't pay attention to us as much just because we only ordered two dishes or their service is just straight up crappy, but hey, what can you expect from big chain restaurants right? And even after she dropped it off, we realized the napkin was completely filthy and had to exchange for another one.  The pasta dish was okay, nothing really stood out to me. It had two pieces of toasted bread, angel hair pasta, two thick pieces of chicken, canned artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. The chicken was perfectly cooked and had a good taste to it and the sauce was cheesy yet light. The canned artichoke hearts balanced out the flavors with a hint of acidity. Pasta was okay, but a bit overcooked. I usually soak my bread into the sauce but there was barely any sauce and the bread was too crunchy to the point where it was hurting my mouth.  I don't think we will ever be returning to this specific location or go to BJ's specifically for their happy hour, but if I am ever craving a pizookie or a deep dish pizza then this is the place to go to!"
Alysse A.,"San Diego, CA",390,108,121,5.0,10/11/2015,This place is great. The entree caesar salad  is perfect for two with a medium pizza(with some to take home) we got the pict Hawaiian with no jalapeños. Delicious. Service was attentive but also gave us our space to watch the game. Come here if you want to avoid a busy crowded bar. It's a wonderful place for football Sunday! Family friendly on one side and bar- like (not crowded but classy) on the other side. Perfect mix.
La Shawn H.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/10/2016,"This past Sunday I had a reservation to have bridal shower lunch for a very dear friend.  Upon arrival there was a mix up with our request the staff immediately jumped in to action to get us taken care of.  The most helpful individual was our server Melissa.  Our party consisted of 21 women with several requests and many checks.  Melissa did not miss a beat!  She was very accommodating, helpful and remained pleasant throughtout.  She even had some fun with us.  Melissa I can not thank you enough for your service!  May God bless you and keep up the good work."
Hami O.,"San Diego, CA",4,17,1,2.0,4/4/2016,"I did NOT have a good experience at this BJ's location. I've been a regular at the BJs in my hometown of Burbank and have had generally good experiences but this one really left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). Here is what went wrong: 1. Parking sucks, its a big shopping center with a lot of business. While there is a good number of parking spots, its a quite a walk for a (unusually) cold, rainy San Diego night. 2. When we got there, the hostess told us it was 20 minute wait OR we could sit outside or cocktail area. They DID not tell us the outside area has no umbrellas or anything to shield us from the rain. Why would they even have they area open? We sat there for 15 minutes ordered food and drinks but the misty rain took a toll. Finally I gave up and found the manager who promptly seated us but they didn't bother bringing us new salads or drinks. When the food came it was subpar and my steak had absolutely no flavor. Overall I was very dissatisfied with the service and quality of food here and won't be coming back."
Eric M.,"Provo, UT",69,23,3,4.0,5/29/2015,"I usually love BJs. It's an awesome environment and they have amazing wings.  Tonight, however they messed up both of our large Pizzookies, they came out totally burnt and within a matter of a couple minutes they were rock hard.  Fortunately the manager took them off our bill but it took them a long time to re-split the bill and let us be on our way.  Fortunately our server Nicole was totally helpful and had a great attitude.  We'll be back!"
Kelly J.,"San Diego, CA",79,113,1017,3.0,4/15/2014,"The service or lack thereof has been heavily discussed in other reviews. Because of this, I will start this review by commenting on the service.  Here's is what I liked and what I think needs improvement about the service: Likes: 1) Our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu. 2) She was patient with all our questions and did not rush us with our order.  3) This is very cool......she told us when she was going on break and told us that another waiter would be checking up on us (our food and drink had arrived at that point). I can't tell you how many wait staff at other restaurants would disappear leaving us to wonder if they were done for the day or were taking a break. This was beyond professional. Nicely done! 4) She served us the first slice of pizza. It's the small things that add up. Needs Improvement: 1) While our waitress was on break, a gentleman wearing a blue shirt which was different from the rest of the wait staff, came over and asked if we wanted a box for our pizza. We had only finished two slices of pizza. I think it would have gone over better if he had first asked us if we were still working on the pizza. I understand restaurants are volume driven businesses, but making the customer feel rushed is not a model of great service. And who knows, maybe the customer will order dessert, more drinks etc. if they don't feel rushed. Just a thought.  2) Probably being a little nick picky here, but we ordered an appetizer, salad and pizza.  It would have been nice to ask if we wanted everything all at once or if we wanted the salad and appetizer first and then the pizza. Instead, they brought everything out at once without asking. This goes back to the first point about not making the customer feel rushed.  3) I had finished my tasters, but I was not asked if I wanted anything else to drink. Again, back to the first point.  Conclusion on Service: I have mixed feelings about the service. I can't say it was the worst service but I also can't say it was the best. I do not expect perfect service, but I also do not expect to feel rushed. There are tons of factors that account for awful service such as not enough wait staff on duty for the amount of customers, problems in the kitchen, lack of training, etc. None of these factors were present during our recent visit. So I do think they can fine tune their service a bit more. I realize service can be hit or miss at most places and this is only one visit. But, if they are that way with us then I have to assume they are that way with some of the other customers. That's my two cents on the service. The food was pricey but really good.  We ordered the crispy calamari, seared ahi salad, and the BJ's Favorite (aka supreme) hand tossed pizza. The crispy calamari came with two different dipping sauces, marinara and some kind of garlic mayo. Both were great complement to the perfectly fried calamari. The seared ahi salad was probably our favorite of the three. Everything in the salad was really fresh. As mentioned in my other reviews, I'm not a big salad fan but this was really delicious especially the buttery slices of avocado and the tender slices of seared ahi. The pizza was loaded with fresh toppings and came out nice and evenly cooked. I think the crust itself could use a little work, it's got a nice texture but it lacks any flavor. Because of this I did not bother finishing some of the crust.   I had the four 5oz beer tasters for $6.95 which is decent deal.  Mixing it up, I decided to go with the Tantonka Imperial Stout, BJ's Porter, Piranha Pale Ale and Hopstorm IPA. The Piranha Pale Ale was probably my favorite. It was very tasty and sweet for a low abv beer.  On the other hand, the Tantonka Imperial Stout lacked any thickness and seemed very forgettable for this style of beer. For imperial stout, it did not coat my mouth and the coffee, chocolate, etc flavors were lackluster. My wife had the mojito which she enjoyed and would order again.  This BJ's is a solid three stars for me. The food and some of the beer was really good, but it was a bit on the pricey side. When I come to restaurants during the weekend, I do not want to feel hurried. It's the weekend I want to relax and take it slow. This service did not cater to that."
Eva N.,"El Cajon, CA",3,4,2,5.0,3/25/2014,Love happy our here !!! Must try chicken club sandwich it's simply amazing !!!!! Bazooka for dessert hits the spot !!!!!
Cassidy C.,"San Diego, CA",341,36,8,3.0,1/12/2016,I Would have given this location more stars but I'm so upset they changed their happy hour menu! Bad choice Bjs. I used to come here 4 days a week or so and now only once in a blue moon. I come alone so I loved the smaller apps on Happy Hour! It looks very slow these days now that the Happy Hour is awful. The Bartenders are always nice at least! I usually receive good service. Bring back Happy Hour Bjs!!!
Caitlin G.,"San Diego, CA",1,1,,5.0,3/28/2016,"I've come here several times for lunch and dinner, and I've never had a bad meal. There are plenty of options available for vegetarians and meat eaters which helps my husband and I out a lot! We request Morgan as our server every time we go. She is the best server I've ever come across and she goes out of her way to make sure our dining experience is perfect. She genuinely cares about her customers and we just love her!! We'll continue to be regular customers here for sure!!"
Doreen B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",187,399,1850,2.0,6/26/2014,"05/23/2014 It was my birthday on the 25th of May, so my friend Aneita suggested that we go to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse to have a gathering. My husband and I met with 11 other friends as we waited for 1 1/2 hours, even thought we made a reservation. (why makes us make a reservation)???. I did not hear any grumblings from my guests about the wait.... because we were talking about 1. Once upon a time 2. Star Wars  3. Comic Con Past 4. FOOD and then finally the little UFO blinked and WE finally got a table ordered.  Some people got appetizers, some people got an entrée.  I felt bad for one of my good friends because she ordered a burger and she was the last one to receive her food-- even the steaks got to us before the burger. Tracy had mention that the waitress had assured her it was coming and that she was not forgotten. Tracey is pretty easy-going and happy, she mentioned that the was a nice gesture the waitress had done.  I ordered the ribeye with Asparagus and White Cheddar Mash, the whole plate tasted like someone salted it to death. When my friend tasted a piece, she stated that it was salty, but that she liked it.  And... I know that they ask is the steak to your liking... it's a CYA thing. But i cut the very edge of the steak... that part was good. So I tried to scrap off the salt and then eat what I could.  Now the two stars were saved by the waitress and the manager who cut my cake beautifully. For a party of 13, the waitress was very attentive. Now I repeat because I was concerned the my b-day cake would become a Mexican Chocolate Slaughter, however that manager did such a great job. KUDOS to you. We had separate checks so the closing was pretty simple and fast.  *****Tips They have the option to reserve a table-- but beware you're whole party has to be there.  Make sure you taste a couple of pieces of your steak, before the server walks away. They allow cakes from outside of special events. ***This note is an update 06.27.2014 to Trevor something rather he may work or may not work here, or maybe he has a significant other who works here.  I don't know or care. Next time you send a compliment please do not curse at me or put innocent people down. That was really rude, and your curse words are not welcomed in my comments. We paid our bills and tipped our waitress very well. So back off Mr. Rudeness.***  This is why I did not post your comment."
Brian C.,"San Diego, CA",5,154,81,4.0,9/14/2014,Fun place and great food. The service last night was outstanding. Wish I could remember the name of our waiter!!
Chris B.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,1,4.0,7/23/2016,"BJ, s has always been a go too for dinner for my family.  There food selection offers something for anyone's taste.  Too much to choose from really. My wife and I always hit the deep dish pizza. Buffalo chicken pizza never a bad choice. Wife swears by the fresh tomato salad. Service gets a little sketchy especially when your server is required to go on break or bring you a beverage from the bar but still on par. Don't forget to try one of there beers. The piranha pale goes down smooth with the Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish."

Dani S.,"San Diego, CA",67,34,2,5.0,6/7/2014,"Great food.  Ian was our waiter and was perfect.  We had potstickers and pepperoni flatbread appetizers and speciality drinks - all great.  For meal, we tried a pizza, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, Tuscan chicken limone, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, and Parmesan crusted chicken.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  For dessert, we shared the BJ's Baked Beignet (bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream) - it was very good!   The wait was 25 mins, but there was seats available for our wait and it turned out to only be about 10 mins. (Friday evening around 7pm)"
Brooke D.,"San Diego, CA",156,114,136,4.0,5/25/2015,"We love going to BJ's because we get great coupons in the mail for buy one entrée get another entrée for free.tonight our servers name was Ian. He was very nice, and very helpful. He set expectations very well and letting us know that he would keep his eyes open for one or drinks needed refills.The food is not super super super wonderful, however it is very tasty and we would definitely return for more. Especially when we get our buy one entrée get another entrée for free deal. As a vegetarian, sometimes it is difficult to find an ideal meal on menus. He was very helpful and offering different types of options on my chicken pesto sandwich. I got avocado and tomato inside of my pesto sandwich instead of the chicken.  The deep dish pizza is pretty good, but really nothing like Chicago deep dish pizza.  Next time we will definitely save room for a pizookie!"
Cristina L.,"Chula Vista, CA",35,15,1,4.0,4/8/2015,"Great salads and the prices are very reasonable. The service was fast and the desserts to die for. The pizookie its amazing, I had to go to the gym for 2 hours to burn it off but it was worth it."
