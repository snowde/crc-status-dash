Leon C.,"San Diego, CA",24,17,22,2.0,4/12/2014,"First time at a BJ's Brewery and I was not impressed on any level.  The excitement of my friend's words were way out-of-bounds.  Only plus was immediate seating during a busy lunch.  The restaurant decor layout and atmosphere is nice.  But what's a good looking anything that doesn't run smoothly.   Service was way beyond slow and way below par.  The table I was seated at didn't have any silverware.  Took over 5 min for the server to arrive to our table for an initial beverage order.  And a nice 10 min before they returned with the drinks.  Next the server only gave my friend napkins for them to place their drink on.  More to be disclosed at the end of the meal. As a heads up this is not the place for any seafood lovers.  The menu is extremely limited to burgers and chicken.  I only viewed a salmon dish, lobster bisque, and lobster tacos.  This made it tough for me to practice no meat Fridays during this lent season.  So I settled for the mini one topping deep dish lunch pizza (extra cheese).  I think the food would have tasted better if it didn't take close to 20 min to reach our table.  My friend enjoyed the salad with blue cheese dressing.  And that's all that can be said. The avocado spring rolls bland and drenched with chipotle sauce.  My friend's chicken quesadilla combined four triangles were smaller than my hand.  Pizza is pizza.  We left not hungry and definitely not satisfied.   From prior dining experiences I thought when close to finishing a meal a server would approach and ask how we are doing and ask is there anything else we may like.  At least refill a drink or two.  Well at this BJ's my expectations may be a little to high especially when customer really wants another salad or water.  My friend and I sat close to 15 min after no food was left on our plates.  Also be forewarned do not ask any one outside your server for anything.  I attempted to ask a different server within the restaurant to break a large bill so we could leave and pay the bill with an exact amount of the check plus tip.  We were quickly instructed your server has to do it.  Apparently shame on me for not wanting to sit for another 5-10 min with money I wish I didn't have spend here.  So my buddy and I went to the front and paid the billed.   He asked what should we do for tip and I said give two reasons where a tip was earned.  The hostesses were nice and for me thats where it stops. For the first time in my life I used the 10% marker of bad, bad, bad overall experience only because I was forced leave a tip.  Still I'm nice enough to know it may have just been my server and not the attitude of the restaurant.  2 Stars for appearance and greeting."
ryan r.,"San Diego, CA",13,81,9,2.0,8/20/2014,"I love the food from BJs at other locations. I know this place hasn't been open for very long but they did a really bad job when it came to hiring wait staff. We have come here about 3 times now and twice had bad service. One time it was so bad (the waiter was busy talking to his friends, he missed a few items we had ordered and didn't like when we brought it up) that we left with a very unsatisfied. Overall I hope this place improves their wait staff, because it is so close to my house."
Jennifer M.,"San Diego, CA",53,65,6,2.0,3/30/2014,"Where do I begin.. took about 30min to he seated, then another 25min to get our apetizers, and when we did we had no silverwear and no extra plates till we were half way done using our hands.. the server was so busy running around I can't totally blame him. None the less the deep dish pizza was way over priced and was okay, tbh Dominoes knocks this out the park. We also go the Shrimp Scampi Pasta, it was decent, it had a lot of shrimp, so huge plus on that!  All in all, you can try it.. don't guarantee you'll have a good expirience or a bad one, but I'd skip this and check out any other neadby resturants.."
Angelena M.,"San Diego, CA",0,22,3,1.0,10/21/2015,"Went to BJ's Brewhouse at Hazard center today with my fiancé. He ordered a burger well done it came out pink,he sent it back and it came out pink AGAIN. I ordered Cajun chicken pasta and it had absolutely no Cajun seasoning . I think I've had better cans of spaghettios. Extremely disapointed about this location. I will not be coming back."
Christina M.,"San Diego, CA",43,8,,5.0,7/6/2016,"Great service and delicious food. And the waiter was awesome ,his name was Lewis. Service amazing."
Jayro L.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/16/2015,"My first time in any BJs, and I was really looking forward to it. But the service and food was subpar and expensive. I would not return."
Krystal A.,"San Diego, CA",46,14,,5.0,1/13/2016,I've been to BJ's several times and every time I leave satisfied. The food and service is great. The pizookies are awesome! You must try them if you're thinking of a dessert. BJ's will forever have my service. :)
Daniel R.,"San Diego, CA",6,41,24,5.0,5/4/2015,"Nice place, delicious food, I haven't had any good pasta for long , I got their Grilled chicken Alfredo (Pasta) which reminded me of Giovanni in Italy . Super creamy and tasty. Love it and will go again."
Killer S.,"Paradise Hills, San Diego, CA",64,59,1,1.0,8/21/2014,This place is a nice place...  It's just the service was so damn slow.  My wife was enraged and it ruined our night.  The manager tried to make it better by giving us a free dinner.  My wife was 6 months pregnant and had a car accident earlier that day and she wanted some good pizza to calm her so we decided to come here instead of Joe's crab Shack. Big mistake...  It ruined our night.  The food is decent though...  But if you combine decent food with terrible service it's a disaster  waiting to happen.
Frederic S.,"Corona, CA",39,13,16,5.0,6/12/2014,Great BJs Excellent service Ashley was great have a piranha pale ale and some sliders perfect combination
Ann B.,"Las Vegas, NV",21,32,17,5.0,7/25/2014,"Great place for date night or a group of friends. The menu has a lot to choose from and there's a lot of noise here so bring the kids! Food is great, beer is awesome and our server Stacy was the best!   Watching my diet so I ordered one of the enlightened dishes. It was the first time trying the grilled scallops with grilled asparagus and brown rice. It was a very pleasant surprise. Not over seasoned, just right for my taste! I had a side salad of tomato and mozzarella with balsalmic. My husband ordered the 9""deep dish veggie pizza w/o olives. He said it was tasty. He's such a pizza guy!  For drinks i had the PM porter, Similar  to a Guiness but a bit smoother with chocolate and coffee tastes. Totally yummy, my hubby ordered the Oasis. Just asked him if he liked it and yes, he did. We'll be back soon!"
Jeffrey T.,"Winchester, CA",156,22,,4.0,2/26/2014,"Venue: Parking is tough if your lazy and dont want to walk. Plenty of parking in lower parking levels though. Restaurant is huge. Hard wood floors, vaulted ceilings, they did it right. Parking is the only reason I didn't give it give stars, btw.  Food: With San Diego being the Mecca of craft beer this is a great entry level brewery. True hop heads will want more ibu's and alc content. The beer is bomb though. There red most definitely crept up on me. I had Mediterranean tacos. They are a definite must try.  Service: Our server was attentive even though he was obviously busy. Food came out quickly and warm. Everyone that came to our table seemed to genuinely care."
Nate S.,"San Diego, CA",0,70,,3.0,8/2/2015,"Our gal server was great - very friendly, cheerful and knew the menu well. Calamari appetizer came out not very hot and somewhat stale as if it has been cooked long before and sat under a heat lamp. Drinks were horrible  - ordered a muddled mojito and the mint wasn't muddled and the mix tasted like limeade. Tried a margarita that was mediocre. Food was generally okay.  Server, atmosphere and our dinner conversation was the best part I would say."
Justin M.,"San Diego, CA",30,28,16,5.0,10/27/2015,"Wife and I decided to go here for the first time last night for our 14th wedding anniversary.  Initially we were going to another restaurant that brews in mission valley but my wife saw BJ's on the corner here and suggested a stop.  Couldn't be happier we did.  We made it in time for happy hour and decided to sit on the patio since it was such a beautiful evening.   Service: Exceptional. Our team was James and Casey who work together on the patio to make sure everyone is taken care of; James was our main Brewmaster.  I pretty much pinged him for suggestions on everything I ordered, from food to beer and his recommendations were spot on.    Food: I ordered garlic wings for an appetizer, the new Portobello Swiss Burger (from loaded burgers section) substitute Bison meat, the thin cut fries, a side of Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl, and BJ's in house Black and Tan (can't remember the exact name of it).  First off, the 5 appetizer wings blew the skin off any of the wings I've had at a certain restaurant that specializes in wings; I won't mention any names BWW...The Portobello Swiss burger was so delicious, it's like the chef was reading my mind as far as how I wanted it cooked; pink in the middle, excellent.  I highly recommend substituting the beef for the bison. The fries were acceptable as fries go, warm enough not to burn my mouth when they arrived.  If you order soup, make sure to get it in their toasted, garlic butter slathered bread bowl; eat the soup, then the bowl!  A two-for!  Then there was the beer, so many to choose from I couldn't decide, so I went with their in-house black and tan since it's been a while and I was pleasantly surprised with it's goodness; I'd definitely have it again.   My wife ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza and she said it was delicious, tons of flavor, and enough left over for a meal the next day. At the end of our meal James brought us a ice cream covered chocolate chip cookie with a couple of candles in it and the very nice manager took our photo.  Totally unexpected and very much appreciated.  Topped off our dining experience nicely.   Again, the service was exceptional and we're definitely going back.  Don't let the bad reviews steer you away, they deserve your business.  Thanks again James and Casey!"
Ray V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,83,3,4.0,3/19/2015,I'm a fan of their Happy Hour.  Dinner and drinks right before watching a movie at the UltraStar Cinema.
Kelly M.,"San Diego, CA",25,128,84,3.0,7/9/2015,"Had a pleasant lunch here today. Super disappointed that the bruschetta-is GONE off the menu! What's next the cookie dessert thing? I must say service was outstanding! Our server was super nice and attentive to my mom. When you get great service it really makes the experience so fab. My soup and salad combo was great. The house salad was so yummy! Not sure why! The soup was good, I just wish restaurants would serve truly hot soup! Why is this a chronic problem? Dessert was very good...s'mores topping on that cookie was spot on toasty and delicious! The ice cream was good quality vanilla...a simple but necessary splurge! Convenient parking and drop off for my handicapped Mom. Great decor and menu choices...just miss that delectable appetizer :("
Trever F.,"Hartford, CT",750,287,28,2.0,12/5/2013,"This is just on the review of the waiter we had ...... justin. He was a terrible waiter, who rushed us from the moment we sat down, and insisted we paid our bill before we ever started eating, in order to get the 35$ deal. Then on top of that it took about 45 minutes for our pazookie to come out so we could leave afterwards.  He asked us how our food tasted before he even placed it down.  I was super pissed. That issue needs to be addressed.  The food and beer of course was amazing like usual and the place looks great, but I warn you if you get Justin just ask for a new section so you can enjoy your meal. As a side note, I have read countless other reviews of this place and it seems that customer service is lacking big time, and now there is a bjs yelp troll who will harass you about your bad review.  I have written BJ's corporate not to get a response..... and all I have to say is when I was there all the staff seemed more concerned with their personal lives then working..... if this is an indication of the generation to come into the work force next, well then we are all doomed."
Mason N Venus B.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,7,,1.0,11/25/2015,This place awful the service was really bad the manager just laughed and kept apologizing the waitress ignored us so many times we had to swallow the pizza without any water as big as the places they cannot find any good help should've checked Yelp before I went in
Angelica C.,"San Diego, CA",281,71,30,5.0,6/20/2015,"Came here yesterday 6/19/15 around 730.  Our waitress was Stacy.  We sat at the bar and alllll  the food, aps, and drinks came out super quick!  She was so sweet and on poooint!  Our first time here and we will definitely be back!"
