Shannon T.,"Linda Vista, San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/6/2013,"This is the second time I've visited this BJ's. Honestly, I would suggest everyone go to another location. Our (second) server was great, and the female manager was also wonderful, but this BJ's has a long way to go when it comes to service.  We sat at the bar and ordered the appetizer sampler with our first round of drinks. 50 minutes later, our appetizers come with our food. The bartender complained on behalf of us, and the staff took our food back saying they would make more. Our appetizers were clearly forgotten about and had sat under a heat lamp or something because everything had that old crust on it. When we finished the appetizers, the entrees were brought out to us COLD. The manager came, was very nice, and got our entrees remade for us. The food was delicious when it came back.  Then we got or check. We were charged twice for everything :( After complaining again we finally got everything worked out, but they really need to work on communication and training here."
Ashley M.,"San Diego, CA",96,24,,2.0,9/8/2015,I love bjs but the service was terrible and the food was bad too. We asked for our pizza with no tomatoes it had tomatoes and mayo on the side of the meatloaf sandwich which they did but they put mayo on the sandwich too and when we sent it back we didn't get until we were done. The egg rolls were gross too. Everyone was friendly but they need to change their service
Michelle H.,"San Diego, CA",7,11,2,1.0,9/8/2015,"My boyfriend and I have eaten here 3 times and BJ has not impressed us. The service is slow and inattentive. The restaurant was clean and everyone was friendly; however, it did not make up for the long wait. We waited 10-15 minutes for water, 30-45 minutes for our food. When our food arrived it was either over-cooked, over-seasoned, or bland. We ordered the Crispy Calamari, Chicken And Spinach over Quinoa, and the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. It was not delicious. We will not be returning."
Samantha N.,"Elk Grove, CA",142,5,,3.0,5/16/2015,"I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta. I never thought you could go wrong with shrimp scampi pasta until I had it at this BJ's location. First of all, $17 for a pasta is ridiculous. I know I know, I chose to order it. But I assumed I would be getting my money worth. The pasta had no flavor at all. Until I mixed my pasta up there were parts of it that seemed to not even have sauce on it. I was disappointed with this locations shrimp scampi, I hope next time I try something else here I won't be disappointed again. I also hope that my order wasn't the way it was due to it being a take out order."
Nik V.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,5/27/2016,"Patio server was rude, rushed, and we waited for over 15 minutes before she came over to take our order."
Bianca Q.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,10,,4.0,9/6/2015,I visited quite some time ago but I would like to leave my feedback. I was immediately intrigued by the outside and the spinning doors. When we got inside the hostess was kind and friendly. The guy who led us to our table must have been new because he was a little slow but that's okay. The table where I sat had a odor that was unpleasant but it was sealable since it was so crowded. Our waitress was the sweetest person I have ever met. She made sure that we were taken care of and suggested what my sister should get as she was majorly indecisive. My food wasn't anything special but I wasn't expecting great Cajun from a San Diego restaurant. When it was time to go we paid after a pen mishap that was greatly taken care of and we were on our way.  I would definitely go here again without hesitation and I would tell my friends. I also recommend the root beer.
Janet M.,"San Diego, CA",8,86,19,4.0,7/13/2014,We have wifi and % alcohol on the menu!  No guessing!  Cold beer!  Friendly barlady!  My piraña pale ale tasted suspiciously like the Lazy Dog Pale Ale which leads me to believe micro breweries are making genetic brews and 'u name it'. Correct me if I'm wrong but certainly food for thought.   And they are sharp enough to put 'brew house brand' on the draft tap!  No flies on these guys!  Husband had the Nutty Brewnette which he enjoyed. Good attentive service from Hannah and Rose! Gents bathrooms clean! Ladies clean too! Hey!  And the prices are on the menu too!
Amy W.,"San Francisco, CA",179,1041,1323,3.0,5/31/2014,"We were a big crowd and I will say they do handle a large table (of 10) very well.  This was not my choice, but what they heck - sometimes you gotta go with the flow (or so they say).  After a weekend of eating my bf and I decided to split a sandwich, we got the French dip. Nothing remarkable or anything to write home about, but we got the wedge fries which were decent.  His son got a large pizza (something with chicken and a white sauce) it also was decent and could been a little hotter. Bottom line - if you are a big crowd and are okay with ""okay"" food, this place was fine, service was pretty good and - they did not do the ""automatic add on of a 20% tip"" to a bonus point."
Alex A.,"San Diego, CA",466,58,51,5.0,11/15/2013,"Not sure how you can leave a poor review for a business that has not opened yet or a poor review for attending a soft opening. Be happy you were invited to the soft opening.  For sh*%s sake, give them a chance to open the doors. Soft openings are soft because they are working out all of the kinks.  Can't wait for BJS to open. I'm looking forward to getting a spot at the bar, backing up my wide load into a nice bar stool to enjoy a few brews!"
Melissa M.,"San Diego, CA",48,5,,1.0,11/12/2015,"Worst customer service... First football game of the season, and only 2 bartenders at the bar at 11am."
Wash J.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,5.0,11/11/2015,"I'm an active duty service member, and I came with my girlfriend (who is also active duty) for the Veterans Day special. Rather than letting us both enjoy the spoils of Veterans Day, only 1 meal was complimentary. I know it seems trivial to give a restaurant 1 star over this, but Veterans Day is a holiday that comes only once a year. Just give us our free pizookie! Is that so much to ask??? **UPDATE** Manager came and apologized for the confusion and comp'd our meal. Thank you for the great service and appreciation for the military!"
Dan B.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",83,6,4,1.0,11/25/2013,"We called in advance since we were bringing 10-12 ppl for a birthday party, but were told that they don't take reservations after 5pm... Weird.  The service was slow, we had to flag someone down every time we wanted another beer. When we were able to place an order it took 15 minutes for our waitress to return with our drinks every time. The number one rule for customer service at a restaurant is to keep your guests drinks full!  I usually love BJs, the vibe is great and the pizza and beers can't be beat, but this was hands down the worst location I've ever been to. Go to another of their locations."
Antoinette J.,"San Diego, CA",1,7,2,5.0,10/1/2015,"I loooooooooove this particular Bj's. The set up is so comfy and nice. I go A LOT and the employees are pretty good! Attire is professional and the food is alllllll good. You can't go wrong here. There is a big variety of food which is very important. I think thats another reason I go so much, I can always count on trying something new and knowing its going to be delicious."
Chris P.,"San Diego, CA",406,539,63,3.0,3/27/2014,"Glad my service experience was very good compared to other reviewers.  It was a busy night too so it seems like they got their service issues mostly ironed out... I don't really eat at big chains as much as I used to, and its always interesting picking up the menu at a place like this.  Its great for when you dont know what you want to eat because they have everything!  I dont know how the kitchen keeps up with everything.   Anyways, my gf got the mahi mahi and it was overcooked.  Like pretty dry.  The rice that it was on was decent. My friends steak was overcooked.  Like no blood at all when ordered medium.  My chicken and potatoes had great flavor.  The chicken was cooked nicely.  The plate was drenched in balsamic dressing though...just not sure about that.  Mashed potatoes...I love mashed potatoes. Ambiance is nice.  The bar area is legit...like makes me want to sit there and drink heavily and watch the giant TV. Overall, I think I like Lazy Dog better in the battle of franchises."
Carl S.,"San Diego, CA",9,58,4,5.0,11/12/2013,"OMG I am the second review. Like the first reviewer, this place is not even open yet but I am way cooler than her because tonight was their soft opening...oh I did not go inside, but I drove by it and I could see that it was 5 stars just from that. I could tell that the pizza was cooked to perfection and the service was better than any other location.  In all seriousness, it's people like the first reviewer that make Yelp a subjective useless tool. So I encourage everyone else who has never visited this location, but has ate at BJ's to write a useless review as good as mine."
Donna H.,"Fremont, CA",0,16,2,3.0,9/26/2015,Not too busy of a night around 830 PM on a Saturday night me and my boyfriend got seated in about 10 minutes. Servers were hard to find and didnt really invest themselves into good customer service just kind of did the bare minimum.... Food was okay and came out fast but it wasnt anything special. Drinks were good. A little disappointed in service.
Joseph D.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",5,42,68,4.0,6/9/2014,This is one of the largest BJ's I have ever been to. I have been here twice now and both times u have really enjoyed the happy hour prices. I ordered the house IPA and it was only $4.00. The hostess at the front could have begin a little more welcoming but I sat in the bar and the bartenders were excellent as far as service. They have a very nice patio area if you prefer to eat/drink outdoors. Food wise I ordered the Great White which was delicious! Def a go to spot!
Lux S.,"San Diego, CA",145,135,135,4.0,3/17/2014,"This particular location is fairly newer than the other ones. This establishment is geared towards bigger parties looking for food and fun. Great for parties, birthdays, celebrations. The parking can be an issue. It is a decent lot however it is always difficult to find one close to the entrance, you usually have to park very far from the restaurant especially during busier hours. I've always enjoyed the flights. You can choose up to four or eight. If you get eight, be prepared to be either drunk or at least slightly intoxicated. The stout is always favored by me but I also enjoy their hefe and the brown ale. They are generous in their flights and priced fairly. They an extensive list of beers but also provide a full service bar if you're looking for more than beer in the alcohol department. I've had the ahi poke which is OK but nicely paired with thin crispy chips. I feel it is prepared mediocre and is a shared appetizer but small in quantity yet pricey.  I always have good service here, everyone is professional and welcoming in their demeanor. What is nice is their lunch menu from 11-3pm. If you're looking for a quick meal and a beer, this place is definitely worth a shot."
Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152,1.0,12/1/2014,"I try to be fair with my reviews so I've been holding off on writing this update in hopes that things would change here, but after getting food poisoning from this location, I just can't hold back any longer.  I've been to BJ's more than a handful of times in the past few months to sit at the bar for football games. The bar is usually pretty full, but not more than any other restaurant I've been to on a busy day. The service is ALWAYS incredibly slow but typically, I don't care that much if there's a good game on. For a while, I thought that maybe they were just having a difficult time handling football season, but I started to look around and notice employees standing around, talking to each other, and doing a whole lot of nothing.  On Saturday, I went with some friends and my boyfriend to BJ's to watch the Apple Cup. Initially, we were sitting outside but decided we wanted to move inside where it was a bit warmer. We were told the game would be played outside so we didn't want to move inside unless the game would also be played inside. I grabbed a table and asked the first server that walked by if the Apple Cup would be on one of the TV's. He said that he would find out for me so I waited there patiently. He disappeared for a few minutes and came back into the bar and started serving his tables again, as I sat there waiting on if I should tell my party to come inside or not. Finally after waiting awhile, a waitress comes up to serve me. I told her I asked one of the waiters if they would play the game and that he never came back. She confirmed that it wouldn't be a problem.  Once we finally sat down, it took a LONG time to get our first round of drinks. By the time we wanted to order food, I couldn't find our waitress anywhere. As we waited, I made eye contact with several employees that walked by, as well as those who were standing around talking. They simply looked over and looked away quickly. Finally, I saw our waitress and had to flag her down since she wasn't even planning on stopping by. My boyfriend and I ordered sliders for an appetizer and BBQ chicken pizza for dinner, with a side of ranch for myself. My friend ordered pizza with a side of ranch as well, while her husband ordered lasagna. The food was okay, or so I thought. Before I get into that, I have to mention that by the time the Apple Cup was about to come on, our waitress told us she could not play it after she had promised they would. We called a manager over and luckily he said he would turn the game on for us. Well, the game had already started and we were still waiting for the channel to change. I looked around at several employees that ignored me again so I went up to one of the hostesses and asked for help. Finally, the game was turned on.  About 3 to 4 hours after eating, I started to feel nauseous. I know most people have their own idea of when food poisoning occurs, but if you take a look at the FDA's website for food poisoning, you'll learn that there isn't just one generic timeline of when it occurs after you've ingested contaminated food. For example, the website notes that foods such as egg salads and creamy foods can cause food poisoning symptoms such as sudden onset of severe nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. The symptoms may be present within 1-6 hours and last for 24-48 hours.  It really depends on the type of food and bacteria ingested.  With that being said, my friend and I were up throughout the entire night with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and fever. My boyfriend and her husband were fine, so we narrowed the problem down to the ranch dressing we both ate. We did not eat any of the same foods the day(s) before so it would be too big of a coincidence that we were both up all night long with the same symptoms. She was vomiting blood at one point and her parents almost took her to the emergency room. I was considering going too as I lost track of how many times I had vomited, but figured I wouldn't since my boyfriend wasn't sick. I didn't know till the following day that my friend had food poisoning as well. We were both sick all day on Sunday and could barely eat a thing. Today, I still feel as if I got kicked in the stomach, but I'm a lot better than I was yesterday.  I called BJ's and notified them so other people don't suffer. They apologized and told me that I would be contacted soon by corporate. The manager I spoke with suggested that ""there's been something going around lately"" as if we can't tell the difference between obvious food poisoning and the flu. I wasted the last day of my Thanksgiving vacation being sick because of someone else's carelessness. Mistakes happen but like I said before, the staff here overall just doesn't seem to have their act together and I don't plan on eating here again since I can't trust that the food is managed properly."
Daphne W.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",45,165,27,5.0,5/20/2015,"BJ's is my new go-to for when I'm craving a veggie burger (you can substitute the beef patty with a veggie patty for any burger on the menu). Aside from the burgers, the menu's other choices include pizza (deep dish or thin crust), pastas, soups, and so much more -- definitely pleasing to a crowd or to someone who appreciates an extensive menu."
