Camdin J.,"Rockville, MD",14,58,12,4.0,5/15/2015,"I'm actually really surprised at the reviews on this place because I have always had a good experience at any BJ's location I've been too. With this particular one, the food and drinks were great! The service, yeah it tends to be a little slow, I'll be honest.  Overall I love the food, the atmosphere, the drinks and I always have a good time with friends when coming. I'll def be back."
serina c.,"San Diego, CA",869,713,283,5.0,2/1/2015,Bomb gluten free pizza!! Omg finally a place that serves gluten free options that actually taste like the real thing. Service has always been good and the manager Jack was very helpful whenever we had questions. The chicken pita tacos were pretty good on the low calorie menu. Flavors were def there so thats a good option when you want to eat healthy. Save the calories and split the pizookie lol
Jess C.,"San Diego, CA",4,10,53,3.0,7/8/2014,"After being seated for about 5 minutes without a hello from anyone. We got up and asked the hostess for our waiter.  We seen him probably 3 times our whole dinner.  My water was empty half of the meal.  Worst service I've ever received at BJs and it was basically empty (late Monday night).  The food was okay. Even our Pizookie was over cooked. By far, the worst BJ's experience we've had.  We will be making the drive to the La Jolla location from now on."
Laurie S.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,,1.0,3/28/2015,Update: we were in the area and decided to chance it again. Bad move. Food Great. Service Horrible.  The waiter never brought my second glass of wine. They gave us an Oreo Cookie Pazookie instead of the Gluten Free one we ordered. Good thing I caught it. You'd think the waiter would have asked twice if he misheard us as we ordered the GF Pizza and told him our son was GF.
Bob L.,"Temecula, CA",9,54,14,3.0,7/4/2015,"Always get pretty good food. Today was no exception. Brewhouse burger, and pulled pork sandwich were both good. Bar service was slow. Margaritas weren't great. Not a fan of their sweet n sour mix. Signed up for their rewards program and downloaded their app... But wifi was so slow that the app took our whole visit to download. This location was not as good (service-wise) as others."
Kenneth V.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,1,5.0,10/12/2014,"Lana is perfect. I've never seen one person run around and cater to so many people so effectively at once! I will come here again because of her. She checks in at the perfect time and I feel like she genuinely wants me to have a good experience! Wow, find her, promote her. BJ's has too little staff for how busy it gets. But Lana handles it very well. This place has great food for good prices."
Lisa F.,"Tahoe City, CA",0,17,3,3.0,4/23/2016,I love their honey mustard chicken salad.  Their happy hour is great too.
P M.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,4.0,5/10/2016,Love this place for happy hour and a good beer. Stuffed mushrooms and the flat breads are perfect to share and so are the delicious deep dish pizzas! It can get crowded and loud around dinner time but the patio is a perfect place to sit and actually hear your conversation.
Cal C.,"San Diego, CA",20,22,9,1.0,7/3/2014,Disappointed with quality of the food at this location.  The one in la mesa is much better.
Ivory R.,"Santee, San Diego, CA",6,25,13,1.0,1/16/2016,"My experience here was okay. I say this because the food was good. The service was horrible. I gave the waitress Alyssa the benefit of the doubt when we first got there when we didn't have our silverware and napkins/plates when we sat down. We had to ask for plates when our appetizer came out. She brought us 2 plates and there were 3 people eating. When our dinner arrived we didn't even have silverware. She didn't realize it was missing,  we had to ask for it.  We ordered dessert  (pizookie) it was the chocolate chunk cookie. When she brought it out it was one with peanuts. Thank God myself or my husband wasn't allergic because we would have been in the hospital tonight. When we told her we didn't order one with peanuts she laughed it off and said she hoped we weren't allergic. I didn't find it funny.  She said she just grabbed it and thought it was chocolate chunk. Someone else brought out the correct one. When we were ready to leave we asked for a bag to put our boxes in and she completely forgot about us. Never came back to give it to us. We just asked the front. I won't be coming back to this BJ'S. Horrible service here. If it was up to me she wouldn't have been tipped but my husband made me."
Andrew D.,"San Diego, CA",171,2,,2.0,8/2/2015,"Probably the second worst service I've ever had. I've asked 4 different people including the manager for a spoon for my coffee... A fricken spoon. Oh but this wasn't where it started it started when we had almost an hour wait for our food... Manager comes out, naturally, and speaks with us saying she'll take care of us at that point, but nope, asked for a refill on my coffee from another 4 different people including the manager AGAIN then it's back to the beginning of our story. The only this salvaging that one extra star is they ended up comping about 20 dollars from our appetizers because of the wait, but how ridiculous is it to not get a cup of coffee or even a spoon after talking to even the manager? Other than the service though, if you don't mind waiting an hour for shrimp scampi that's nothin special, l go right ahead and come by."
Justin H.,"Bellingham, WA",311,119,238,5.0,12/20/2013,"I can't say anything was bad about this restaurant. I went with my girl and we started off with drinks and the stuffed mushrooms which were delicious and only 6 dollars. They were stuffed with artichoke cheesy goodness and we pretty much demolished them seconds!  For drinks my girlfriend got the candy cane martini which was actual pretty strong, while I got the house brewed hefeweizen which was awesome. After that we got the ribs and chicken pasta, both excellent and full of flavor. The customer service there was great and our waiter was phenomenal, checking on us multiple times. The environment of the entire restaurant was just a nice feel and I wouldn't change a thing about it. Definitely recommend to anyone in the area to go."
Stacey M.,"The Colony, TX",59,32,5,5.0,6/23/2015,"I'm from Texas and I've always liked BJ's Brewhouse restaurants. I was waited on by Matt at the bar on my first night and he provided excellent service. I was looking for a Russian imperial stout and he suggested Tatonka, which I really liked. But that's not why I'm giving him a great rating. I watched him work his rear off, it was very crowded the Friday night I was there. He was very pleasant and, even though he was moving very quickly, he took time with each customer to answer all of their questions with a genuine smile that never faded. The next day we came back to BJ's and sat in the patio area. The patio area was very nice with comfortable seating and a great atmosphere. Ian was my server and he was one of the sweetest, most attentive waiters I've ever had. He was constantly checking on our table, making sure we had everything we needed. I have to say, the service I received at this restaurant was fantastic. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the San Diego area."
Adam S.,"San Diego, CA",1644,752,174,3.0,11/9/2014,"I've always been a fan of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  The variety of food is pretty good and the quality is descent.  And of course, how could anyone say no to a pazookie at will?  However, as far as San Diego BJ's goes, I do not find them all that great and this location is no exception.  I had high hopes that when this one opened, it was going to be the premier BJ's location that San Diego deserved, but it is not.  It is just like any other chain but with a bigger building (yet still is smaller than it looks).  The customer service was mediocre at most.  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly but was not around other than to take our order and serve the food.  Considering that the place was barely half full, I have no idea what she was doing in the meantime to avoid checking on us.  The quality was still better than most places.  However, BJ's has cut down on the portion of its dishes while maintaining a high price over the years so I cannot say I am a fan of that.  Overall, if you're looking for a good restaurant to go out with a group of friends or just by yourself, then BJ's is a solid 2nd/3rd option. Definitely come here if you have a craving for something sweet, because the pazookie is where its at!"
Donald H.,"Lakeland, FL",2,3,,2.0,6/22/2014,Service was very slow. Waited 10 mins to get asked for my first drink. Chelsea C seemed to have more important stuff to talk about with the hostess. The guy clearing the plates had more of a presence.
Cassandra F.,"San Diego, CA",164,95,20,4.0,1/30/2014,"Well hot damn! First, I'm glad they put this restaurant in the city of ""all things commercial and generic"" - mission valley.   I'm not one to love chain restaurants, but the pazookie weighs BJs in my favor .... Just keep it out of my cute and charming neighborhood :)  please and thank you!  With that being said, this place may be THE place for after work cocktails. I recently met up with a friend there not really knowing what to expect. But upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised. The bar probably takes up more than half the restaurant which definitely sets the tone for the kind of market they're hoping to attract. I would say 90% of the patrons were coming directly from the office and were looking to let loose - as loose as you can get on a work night - and network; both socially and professionally.  My kind of party. Great vibe, centrally located, fantastic happy hour specials, and needless to say, the pazookie. I will definitely be back!"
Ria B.,"San Diego, CA",374,9,6,5.0,5/26/2015,"Came in on a Sunday night for a quick bite at around 10pm for happy hour. If weather permits, go ahead and sit outside by their fireplace. This BJ's is byfar the most aesthetically pleasing one I have been to. We were served by Emily, who was very sweet, attentive and helpful. The food, service and ambience were great and I will be making it a point to go here again in the near future!"
Elizabeth M.,"San Diego, CA",55,27,12,5.0,5/9/2014,"I have only gone here once, but I will say my experience was great!  Loved the food and the waiter joked with us and was patient with us while we decided. He made suggestions without up selling and never once tried to upsell a bar drink.  Just like another reviewer posted, our server went on break, and told us beforehand so that's a plus, The girl who took over, he introduced us to her! This is nothing I have seen at a restaurant haha!  I ordered the scallops with rice and asparagus off of their lite menu, absolutely delicious!!!! Planning on going back for a second time for mother's day!!"
Elizabeth C.,"San Diego, CA",91,335,257,4.0,12/2/2013,"Welcome to Mission Valley BJ's!  I discovered BJ's Restaurant and Brewery 12 years ago when I was living in Boulder and I have been a fan ever since.  After Maria Maria shut down a couple of years ago, this location sat sad and vacant for far too long.  Then one glorious day there was a sign announcing a BJ's was coming soon.  Excellent choice!  This means in Mission Valley alone you have San Diego Brew Co, Gordon Biersch, Lazy Dog, and BJ's (just to name a few) for a place to get some food and drink some good beer.  Yum! BJ's always has awesome pizzas and calzones.  I tend to make my own calzone to avoid an overload of pork options that I am allergic to.  It's so nice when restaurants offer a ""build your own"" option, and I wish more did.  Their sandwiches are delicious, especially the beef dip.  When I had lunch at this location just a week ago, we started our lunch off with an ahi poke appetizer, my husband enjoyed a bison burger, and I got the grilled maui mahi.  We also enjoyed some pints of their harvest pumpkin beer, and it was very tasty.  BJs has over a dozen of their own beers to choose from on tap, from your lightest ales to your darkest stouts, they will have something for you to enjoy. For dessert we got a pizookie  (baked cookie with ice cream on top).  They have multiple cookies to chose from and you can even mix and match for a half and half choice.  So we got half red velvet and half white macadamia nut cookie a la mode with French vanilla ice cream. I felt the service was up to speed and the staff were all friendly.  Even the manager stopped by and asked how we were enjoying our meal.  Considering I went here shortly after they opened color me impressed.  I've seen restaurants fall apart in their first month of being open, and I'm not seeing that as the case for BJs. Parking is shared with the other businesses of Hazard Center.  I don't ever have a problem with parking, but I'm sure on more busy/popular nights for that shopping center it can become a bit more chaotic.  That's to be expected for Hazard Center.

Rika L.,"San Diego, CA",2,86,10,3.0,6/17/2014,"I only come here out of convenience because it's close to work for lunch meetings.  There is never a wait for a table and easy parking.  Service is good. The food is decent, but like yelp says ""meh. I've experienced better"" for the that price.  Great for lunch meetings."
