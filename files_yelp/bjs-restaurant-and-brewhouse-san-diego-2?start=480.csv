Mikela D.,"San Diego, CA",16,160,1,4.0,2/1/2014,"I have been to this new location twice. I think it's an amazing location for another Bj's, if only it was bigger. Literally waited 2 hours for a table. Once we were finally seated, the service is so slow! We had about 4 different waitress' and waiters, So it was just so confusing lol I understand it was the first week opening and Friday night, so it was expected. The second time around was a Sunday afternoon, completely dead and still slow service. Now there was no excuse. Saw the workers huddled in groups chatting rather than waiting on their tables. Not very professional. The food here is amazing! I can never complain. So that's why I will always go back. Delicious drinks!"
Realtor Karl B.,"San Diego, CA",59,1973,16,4.0,12/7/2013,"This place recently opened, and it was absolutely packed on a Friday night. Our group of 16 waited 1.5 hours starting at 530pm but at least beers were only $4 (mon-fri 3-7pm). Food took at least 30 minutes to receive after ordering but overall it tasted great. I suggest the deep dish pizza, lobster tail dipped in their special butter sauce, and potato wedges. I usually like their beignet for dessert, but today it tasted a little off. Maybe give them a few months to work faster and cook their food better. Parking is tight and be prepared to walk a long distance."
Richard F.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,4,4.0,9/21/2015,"Great addition to Mission Valley. Great food. I recommend the Shrimp Scampi, they cook the noodles just right and they drizzle toasted bread crumbs. The pazooki cookie dessert is legit too."
Samantha N.,"San Diego, CA",447,335,13,4.0,11/19/2013,"Why are people so freaking mean?!  THEY JUST OPENED. I went there twice and I enjoyed the food and the service.  Also, Tall James if you're reading this, I hope you can join me for happy hour with my buds!"
Shannon S.,"San Diego, CA",3,50,19,4.0,12/21/2014,"I remember hearing about this place and chuckling to myself because it sounded like a nasty innuendo... if ya know what I mean.  I love this place due to A) lots of Food choices,  2) Rocking Drinks_ Any "" Tini"" gets me  3) Take Out.4)  Cool Atmosphere  5)Pazookie It has a variety of choices in food for I never know what I want to eat so this way I have choices I want to eat. My Favorite- Cajun Pasta with Grilled Chicken:) The drinks are strong and delicious- ""ANYTINI"" - WE Discussed this above. Take out= When I don't feel like socializing order ahead- park and they bring it to you. There is a guy who answers carry out _l Love you because you were a sweetheart-We need  clone more of you please ..especially in Customer Service Dept. Cool, loud atmosphere and in Fashion Valley that view is nice.  Parking not so great but hey this is our city so deal.  Pazookie- I have had foodgasms over this dessert. Rich, Bad, Many Calories- I don't Give Rat's Booty since it is heaven. Don't want to share unless I am watching my calories. That damn good. Check it out, K?"
Dave M.,"San Diego, CA",3,19,,2.0,6/9/2014,"First ever not-so-good review. Seems manager and staff are still learning the ropes. I know this BJ's has not been open for more than a few months. Walked in and three rather youthful appearing staff members looked at us for about 10 minutes before one member of our party of four finally got up from the table and asked if we could order something to drink and see a menu.  Food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. However, of the four meals ordered, three arrived at our table in a manner that was not in keeping with what we requested. Of course we have no idea if that were a waiter or a kitchen issue.  Even though our family loves BJ's, and this new location is less than 5 minutes from our house, we will not soon be back."
Lee T.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",0,5,5,4.0,1/29/2014,"There are a lot of reasons to like this place:    Lots of room at lunch time    Nice, big TVs    Extensive menu    Low Calorie selections    Servers that keep my soda filled    Plenty of parking    Delicious Ahi Salad I would just say stay away from the fish tacos. Mine were average at best and I prefer real guacamole, not some kind of avocado sauce. No San Diegan should have to settle for mediocre fish tacos!"
Rachel H.,"Coronado, CA",161,104,111,2.0,3/11/2015,"I have not had a good experience at BJ's. Went because it was for a friend's party, and we had a big table, so I get the service might be a little slow. No. This was bad. We had 2 servers and they seemed to not be able to get in sync with each other, the cooks, or most importantly our table. We had slow service, and were not attended to a lot. Bills brought out at all different times, (as well as the food) without asking if anyone wanted more beer, drinks, or desserts. And we ordered a side salad with our burgers... I can't believe they charge $3.75 for this tiny thing. Ridiculous."
Art S.,"San Diego, CA",0,17,82,1.0,7/7/2015,"Decent prices and good quality food. This is my third time here. Unfortunately, the bar is always understaffed during happy hour and service is awful."
Curt T.,"San Diego, CA",38,94,87,1.0,2/11/2014,"I've been to this location many times and generally the service is pretty good. Today we didn't get any service. We ordered the unlimited soup and salad and my friend got the mini one topping pizza for lunch. The sad thing is was he was almost done eating the pizza before my salad and soup arrived. My friend had to mention the fact that he never got his salad and that was brought about 10 minutes later. Once our food was brought to the table we Never saw our waitress again. Many servers walked past our table and didn't even acknowledge we were there. A bus boy cleaned our dishes off the table and I wasn't even done eating. ( yes the dishes were empty) but I would think that most people that order something that is endless would at least get a second serving if not more of it. Hence that's why they get the endless/unlimited version of it.  So here we were, sitting there waiting for our server to come back so I could get another bowl of soup and salad. SHE NEVER came back EVER!!!! I finally flagged down the hostess when she walked by to seat another customer and she said she would get them for us. 5 min later no one still appeared at out table. Saw the hostess what appeared to be walking around looking for our server but she  apparently  was no where to be found. We got up and walked up to the hostess stand and asked for our check. They said the server is working on it and the hostess stated that out server was missing in action. ( her words not ours) I told them I got the unlimited soup and salad and still hungry but at this point I just want to leave and go to jack in the box and eat something there.  They gave the excuse that their computer system was having some problems. I can give them that for the slow speed of getting the check to us but doesn't explain why we never seen our waitress or never got a second bowl of soup and salad.  A computer doesn't cause bad slow service.  So they ended up adding our total bill at the hostess stand with our help. They just apologized but never offered us a discount or a coupon for a possible next visit. They could have handled this much better.  Again I like BJ's and am ever a reward card holder and don't expect top notch service all the time but this was beyond bad service. They could have handled the poor customer better. I work in customer service so I know good from bad."
MayMay N.,"San Diego, CA",666,51,23,5.0,4/15/2015,"Bjs was a great venue for my networking group. Food was good, drinks were good, and service was excellent. Shout out to our server Bailey and manager Stephanie for an exquisite job! THANK YOU!"
Andy S.,"San Diego, CA",188,5,,2.0,7/6/2014,"1st up we are big BJ fans, having gone to their restaurant in Reno NV 100's of times. I have to say that this BJ's is the worst BJ's food wise in the chain. We tried them about 2 months after the opened as we were excited one of our favorite restaurants had opened close to where we now live. Unfortunately the food was sub par at best, it was like someone who had never been trained to cook had been thrown a recipe book and simply did their best. The service was ok nothing to rave about. So we left feeling a little bummed that our Experience paled in comparison to our Reno BJ experiences. Anyway we decided that we would wait and went a 2nd time because we thought maybe it was opening issues and we wanted to know if it had improved we wanted it to be improved so bad! Unfortunately the 2nd time  i can easily say that the food was worse. My wife enjoyed her taco's but the steak i ordered was burnt our stuffed mushrooms was so embarrassing i call the manager over and he was horribly embarrassed. It seems they have a very lazy kitchen. Some one in their isn't doing a very good job. We will try it a again in a few months just because we know BJ's typically are good value. The staff was very nice, friendly and helpful the restaurant is awesome to sit in and look at but the food has some serious issues that need attention. My hopes is that the management does something about it soon so we can start enjoying our BJ's experience again."
Gracey L.,"San Diego, CA",3,27,3,2.0,1/19/2014,Been here again for football and Happy hour.  The servers are rude and takes forever with your drink order. I have probably seen 1 or 2 of the same faces and the rest of the staff are new and not nice.  Where did crew that opened this place go?   The food is still good.
Breanna H.,"San Diego, CA",0,27,2,5.0,6/28/2015,"Best restaurant experience so far since moving to San Diego! Will definitely go again! Waiter (Andrew. S) was awesome, the food was great and fast, the Oreo pizookie was to die for, and the atmosphere was laid back!"
Aleks L.,"San Diego, CA",6,9,,5.0,11/24/2014,There's no way Bj's has only a 3 star rating! Been here 3 times and every single time we leave full and satisfied! Service is great food is good and the selection in alcohol is phenomenal!
Katie W.,"San Diego, CA",124,125,,4.0,1/13/2014,"First time at BJ's tonight with a group of friends for a birthday.  Color me impressed!  To start, you really can't beat the location if you live in the city.  We got a table right away walking in.  Music was on the loud side -- we had to speak a bit loudly to hear one another, so not a good spot if you're looking for something quiet or intimate.  Not a big deal, though. Service was fantastic.  Had a good handle on the beer selection, fast, non-intrusive, and friendly.  We got the avocado egg rolls (delicious), wings (I didn't have any myself), a large Great White pizza (wonderful) and the mini trio of the pizookies (died and went to heaven).  We had a really pleasant time and I would definitely return."
George H.,"San Diego, CA",24,41,,2.0,4/27/2015,"Usually great. Sunday night they must have run out of pizza ingredients. Took a Tavern Cut Spicy Pig home along with other take out only to find the ""pig"" was cold shredded cold cut meat added along with jalapeño at the last moment. Disappointing. Had to pitch it out."
Jessica O.,"San Diego, CA",292,184,287,2.0,11/11/2014,"If you're thinking about checking out this place because it's new.. Just don't. Just shared soup, salad, lasagna & chicken wings.. All were lacking flavor. Leaving the food & going to find something to eat"
Elijah S.,"San Diego, CA",1872,116,34,3.0,4/19/2015,Just your average chain restaurant. Nothing really stupid out. The staff was friendly and the food was good but still nothing really caught my eye. I would come here again to have a beer or kill time but probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Kyla G.,"San Diego, CA",49,139,16,4.0,3/15/2014,"I adore BJ's. It's an ideal place to go when nobody can agree on what type of food they want.  Instead of having my usual shrimp tacos for the umpteenth time in a row, I splurged and had the Crispy Jalapeno burger. It was amazing. Like exceptionally delicious. Comfortably spicy, juicy, saucy, and fabulous. Will definitely be getting it again! I would highly recommend putting yourself on their ""Call-Ahead"" list, especially if you're a party of 3+ and it's a weekend night. Calling ahead puts your name on their list, without having to be there. Usually, you still end up with a wait, but a much shorter one than if you had put your name on the list when you got there. Think 15 minutes vs. 40. The catch: you can't call more than 30 minutes ahead of time. However, you can seat yourself in the bar area without waiting. They serve the whole menu there, so it can be a great idea if available."
