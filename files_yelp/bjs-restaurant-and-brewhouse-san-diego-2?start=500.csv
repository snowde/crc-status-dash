Angela C.,"San Diego, CA",504,9,37,1.0,10/16/2014,"The girl at the front desk sat my boyfriend and I at a table that had drinks all over it with someone's left over food! We sat there waiting trying to get someone's attention for about over 20 minutes. Servers were walking right past us and making eye contact as they see we have a dirty table in front of us, and do nothing about it and continue walking. Need I mention, they aren't busy serving food or helping anyone. I finally go back to the girl at the front desk and ask if someone is going to come clean up the table. She responds, ""Oh you wanted someone to come clean that up?"" Seriously!? Are you kidding me!? (sarcastically) I'm just going to sit at the dirty table and enjoy the atmosphere. What horrible service!!! How do you seat paying guests at an uncleaned table and not have anyone come clean it?? So many people working and you can't even get one person's attention while servers/waiters are just standing around! I highly recommend going to the La Jolla location instead."
Connie J.,"San Diego, CA",35,5,12,1.0,11/18/2014,"This has been the worst experience at BJ's by far. We came here to celebrate my sisters birthday. The waiter was just the sweetest thing. The food was horrible. Most of us had fries with our meals. The fries were cold and old. There were dirty forks. I got a burger and it didn't have lettuce and they added jalapeños. Mind you I can't tolerate anything hot. We didn't get a refill for over 25 minutes. Plus, my friend got sick in the bathroom because of the food. We talked to the manager and she was more than happy to take care of everything. But still, this was the worst experience and I actually love BJs, but I will definitely only be coming for pazookies from now on. Disappointed. Smh"
Shari T.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,50,13,1.0,4/13/2015,"There's six of us and none of us were satisfied with the food. Cold pizza, bland shrimp scampi, rubbery lasagna. The server was wonderful. Oh- nachos with corn chips? Beautiful restaurant and crowded so there must be some appeal but it eluded us."
David F.,"La Mesa, CA",1,2,,1.0,3/25/2016,"This was the worst service ever. We first asked the waiter what the specials for happy hour were and he responded with ""I don't work that much so I don't know."" We order appetizers and fast forward 15 minutes and I find myself having to go look for a waiter so we can actually order our food. By the time we received our food it wasn't even warm. Not to mention the bartender didn't let us order drinks and advised us to ask our waiter who was apparently M.I.A. It's sad but I definitely will not be coming back here and I would advise you to do the same."
bryant p.,"San Diego, CA",28,78,5,2.0,1/14/2015,Only reason I gave 2 stars is because the person helping me was very kind. However my food was completely disgusting. Ribeye was cooked medium although I asked for rare. I don't know why we even ordered steak when we always get pizza. Fries were cold too. Seriously disappointing.
Lily V.,"San Diego, CA",209,26,49,3.0,5/4/2014,"I was excited to have a BJs near me but I will not be going to this one for awhile... It's getting 3 stars because BJs is generally good but for some reason it was not on it's A game the night my bf and I went.  The calamari tasted different than usual. Super bland! Not sure if they forgot the seasoning or what. The ranch also tasted funny... The pizza was good. So that was a relief! However, my bf got sick the next day. Not sure if it was the food, but he thought so... (He's not a picky eater by any means! )"
Khrystyn C.,"Santee, CA",1,19,1,5.0,7/4/2014,"Richard S. at the bar was awesome! Very personable and we were taken care of very well. We were seated right away. Very good food, fast and delicious. Great service. Overall good Expirence. Not to busy. I would totally come again!"
Christine L.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",34,4,6,5.0,11/26/2013,"I use to be a restaurant manager, and went through a LOT of openings!  Soft openings can be a nightmare, but this location seems to really have it together and has done an amazing job!  Cudos to the team!!!  I've been here 2 times and other than an 86'ed menu item.....there have been NO glitches and friendly fast service!! I work in the area and have seen this space go through at least 3 different restaurants over the years, and BJ's is a far better fit for the area.  I hope this one sticks,  I'll be a regular in no time!!"
Yoshi R.,"San Diego, CA",53,21,7,3.0,3/16/2014,"Second time here.  This time we ordered the deep dish pizza.  We ordered the BJ special.    It has cheese, pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.  Okay...  I  am going to just focus on the pizza.  It was not great.  I know they don't claim to be Chicago deep dish, but they serve up deep dish pizza as their signature menu item.  I could of gotten more enjoyment off a Tombstone frozen pizza for the evening.  The dough was spongy, the sauce tastes canned, the sausage seemed like pre- frozen bits, and there was hardly any cheese.  If a restaurant is going to serve up a so-so pizza, please don't skimp on the cheese!!!   As for the service, it was great.  We also had  calamari as an appetizer.  That was fine also.  So I think a three star rating is fair."
Ali M.,"San Diego, CA",17,54,7,1.0,12/4/2013,"I tried giving this place a second chance today and it failed. Again. Yes, they just opened, but just opening is no excuse whatsoever for super crappy service and a manager who could not give a flying crap about the customers. There is a difference between working out the kinks and just sucking.  I made a reservation for a group of 8 at 11:30 two days prior. I got there at 11:20 by myself. I sit down waiting for 10 minutes. Keep in mind there is almost no one in the restaurant at the moment so it should not take this long. Some of my co-workers arrived and still no table. Someone came over to us and asked us if we needed any help. They had completely forgotten about me and clearly the word 'reservation' means different things to different people.  We sit down at 11:45. The waitress takes our drinks and orders. 12:30 rolls around and NO FOOD YET. We did not each order ribs with a side of burgers and steaks. The food should not take that long (salads, pasta, and sandwiches...really?).  I looked around for a manager for about 20 minutes and did not see one in sight. Finally, someone at my table asked for a manager. Fernando comes over. My co-worker expressed his numerous concerns in a very polite and concise fashion. When he told the manager he should be walking around and that not one out of eight of us had seen him so we could get his attention, he pointed aimlessly towards the other side of the restaurant and said he was walking around over there. A MANAGER should not be giving childish excuses, especially when he knew he was in the wrong. He mumbled sorry and walked away. Didn't talk to the waitress about the situation, didn't apologize sincerely, barely acknowledged our existence, and didn't take a thing off of our check.  This BJs in the middle of a TON of corporate offices. Our office is very close and has about 800 people in it and I will advise every single one of them to stay away from BJs for work lunches."
Diana C.,"San Diego, CA",9,75,2,5.0,12/10/2013,We had a huge party in the bar and Mimi was so patient and helpful to our group.  We loved the big tables and the great service and food.  Thanks for great prices and a truly happy hour!
Raymond. H.,"San Diego, CA",19,32,7,3.0,3/3/2015,"Customer service is excellent, decor is nice.  bar drinks suck.  I purchased a mini deep dish pizza and it was delicious."
Amy H.,"El Cajon, CA",49,52,146,5.0,3/16/2015,"Eric was our server tonight. He was super attentive without being overbearing. It was super busy in the restaurant but we never felt neglected. He was personable, and very well educated with the menu. Our food was great and the atmosphere here is really cool. I love the avocado spring rolls, pasta was great and enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich. Definitely coming back."
Vanessa H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,4,2,1.0,12/30/2014,This place is horrible! Worst service ever. The food is ok but they really need to focus in growing their servers professionally and their people skills!
Alex M.,"San Diego, CA",36,107,56,4.0,12/16/2014,"The pizza here is fantastic, the pale ales are tasty, and the Pazookies are legendary. Good place to watch a game too."
Ed M.,"San Diego, CA",334,978,840,4.0,1/20/2014,"This is a fairly new location for a BJ's in San Diego.  Very big place, TV screens well placed out (caught the tail end of the NFL playoffs here), and the service here is better...much better then the Chula Vista location.  Good stiff drinks also."
Lucas C.,"San Diego, CA",25,25,54,3.0,2/27/2015,Its right next to my work so I tend to grab a beer here from time to time. Foods decent. Not a huge fan of places like this but its close to work and open late. Bartenders are cool as f*
Jacqueline G.,"San Diego, CA",220,348,35,3.0,1/10/2014,"I am a big fan of BJ's beer and like the fact there's a large open location as opposed to the tiny La Jolla one near UCSD. Actually this location is even bigger than the one in downtown La Jolla. You can tell the staff is still pretty new but nice. I wish they would be diligent about your water as well but they were good about watching if people wanted more refills on beer. I was surprised that the pizza was not greasy but I guess it just depends on what you get. We ordered two large pizzas: The Chicken Bacon Ranch and the BJ's Original. I was surprised of how little pizza sauce was on the BJ's Original. I guess I didn't fully read the description. There are a lot of chunky ingredients on there like olives, cube tomatoes, onions, it's like you're getting your healthy serving of veggies on a piece of bread. The pizza dough wasn't doughy but it was more like on the simple bread side. Good bread. But since it was lacking pizza sauce it was kinda dry and you had the urge to dip it in something. I usually don't need hot sauce or ranch to dip my pizza but I felt that I needed it for this one. The Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza wasn't my first choice but friends wanted it. It turned out that it was not overpowered by ranch. Actually, didn't really taste much ranch. You'll probably enjoy the bacon pieces if you like bacon. I'm just meh about bacon in general. Depends on my mood. It was pretty cheesey though. I think there was cheddar and mozzarella.  Again, the location is huge and they have an outside patio with a fire pit. I can imagine on a beautiful San Diego day that it would be awesome to sit out there. Oh yeah, there are TV's all around so hopefully you're lucky enough you're sitting by a corner of them so you can enjoy the hockey and basketball game at the same time. I'll be back to enjoy other BJ's menu items at this location but it doesn't feel smooshed in regards to spacing of the restaurant. Be warned, the parking lot is kinda small and I can imagine during prime lunch and dinner times you're stalking those who are leaving or you just park far."
Cassie O.,"Oceanside, CA",136,65,65,1.0,8/19/2015,"We were in the area and decided to come here for a late night dinner before heading home since it was right next to our appointment at David's Bridal, and was hoping for some good food and brews... that was NOT the case with this visit! We have normally had pretty good experiences with BJ's, but last night was very disappointing to say the least! We had a ask several times for refills on drinks, the drinks that were delivered were incorrect once. The appetizer arrived within a good amount of time, we ordered the Beginners Sampler, and the food was AMAZING on it! Will definitely be ordering it again! We also ordered the medium deep dish pepperoni extreme (or explosion, can't remember the name!), and were disappointed on several levels. The waitress CLEARLY forgot to put our order for it in, since the two people next to us who were seated 10 minutes after we placed our order, got theirs first, and we specially ordered a medium because it said it was 8 slices, and it came sliced for 6. Normally not the worst thing in the world BUT... it was not a good meal! The dough was half undercooked and half over cooked, there was hardly any pepperoni on the entire pie and it just in general did not meet expectations! Disappointing experience for sure!!! Not sure I will be back due to the fact of distance and the lack of service and food qaulity!"
Angela F.,"San Diego, CA",13,6,1,1.0,5/21/2015,Just tried to call in and order and was transferred three times.  Not sure why no one can take my order and the girl I kept getting was no help at all.  Customer Service Sucks!
