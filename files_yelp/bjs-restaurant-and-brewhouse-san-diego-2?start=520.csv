Dan E.,"Milton, FL",67,627,198,4.0,11/21/2013,"We came here during their trial run. Despite the limited menu, the food was good, service was friendly, the decor was obviously new and beautiful, and seating was comfortable. Will be trying it for real soon!"
Jieun P.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,4.0,6/23/2015,"I went to BJ's Restaurant in hazard center with 4 of my friends about 2 weeks ago. It was Friday night, so restaurant was really crowded. Despite of their busyness, they treated us kindly. We expected at least 15 minutes of waiting, but soon we got a seat after only 5 minutes of waiting.   And then we ordered the foods. Actually it took quite a long time to get a food, but the foods tasted really nice and we forgot all complains about the time we waited for the foods. I ate deep dish pepperoni pizza and grilled chicken alfredo pasta and I think grilled chicken alfredo pasta is the best menu in this restaurant.   I have been to same restaurant at Grossmont transit center before, but the one here in hazard center is much better. Much cleaner and bigger, kind staffs with nice services, and great foods. I would like to visit again and want to eat Pizookie next time!"
Renata H.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",80,22,2,2.0,10/29/2015,"I normally go to BJ's in Vegas and have had a good experience there but I can't say the same for San Diego's Mission Valley location. I came for happy hour and was told they switched it up. Their menu says $2 off shareable appetizers mind you no where on their menu specifies which appetizers are ""shareable"". I was excited because before there were only certain items on happy hour. My bartender told me it was great because now you can get what you want. After eating a dry pizza I received my bill to find no discount on my mushrooms. I brought it to the bartenders attention and she went to check only to return saying oh no it's not on this appetizer. WTF you said we could any appetizer we want. Management should clarify which appetizers are part of your happy hour so guest don't feel bamboozled. Every time I come to this location there is always an issue. I won't be back not will I refer my guest here as I am a GM of a near by property less than 2 miles away. Customer service is key and I felt like I was told ""oh well"". Yall need to figure it out quick and more staff training is needed."
Bethany W.,"San Diego, CA",151,87,48,3.0,11/9/2014,Decent service; food was not that great on this particular night. Not up to par when comparing to other BJ's.
G G.,"New Haven, CT",0,51,5,1.0,11/12/2014,"Apparently they just jacked up their prices, because they actually gave our group different menus with 2 different prices for the same items. I asked for a manager to clarify the prices, but no manager ever came. Service was super slow.  If you want an evening of bad food and being ignored, this is the place!"
Jake T.,"Rigby, ID",58,7,,5.0,9/13/2014,I have yet to have a bad experience here. The beers are awesome. Jeremiah Red is quite possibly my favorite but they have a wide variety of beers they brew right there at the restaurant. The food variety is amazing. You're gonna be hard pressed to find a meal that isn't to die for. I tried the ribeye steak and it was juicy and melted in my mouth. My go to meal is the Parmesan crusted chicken or the chicken fettuccine but I'm starting to explore the menu more and it is awesome. Pizookies are a must. You have to try one at least once so save room for that scrumptious dessert.
Tony D.,"San Diego, CA",20,24,2,2.0,5/4/2015,"Stay away from the salad dressing . We came for lunch ,service was good, overall food quality good . But the salad dressing was so shiny and odd tasting that it ruined the salads. We were on lunch so we did not have time to speak with manager so later that day I contacted BJs on the web site. no one ever contacted me , guessing they know it is bad but do not care."
Michael G.,"San Diego, CA",17,11,2,3.0,3/23/2015,"Been here a few times and nothing special what so ever. Decent beer, okay food and a mediocre staff.....not once have I had a ""WOW"" experience. Nevertheless check out the fashion valley location and hopefully your experience(s) is/are better."
Frank M.,"San Diego, CA",2,1,,2.0,3/22/2015,"We like the pizza from there but on Saturday we did a dine out like we usually do and this time the service was the worsted. They told us 20 min and it would be ready, it took them over 40 min to get my pizza. And the hastiest was not very good or was not trained right. I don't know if we will ever go back."
Katie B.,"San Marcos, CA",55,32,7,1.0,1/22/2015,I just left and I will never go back. Horrible service!!! We sat in the cocktail area and we waited 10 minutes for menus then waited another 10 minutes for a server. Even thought multiple staff members walked by no one even acknowledged us. The experience went down hill from there. It took forever for our first rounds of drinks and the second took even longer. Meanwhile the manager was talking to the table next to us because they had the same type of experience we did. BAD!! the table behind us waited almost 20 minutes for there drinks and talked about walking out. We had considered leaving when it took so long for menus and I wish we had!! The experience was horrible!!
kit e.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,,2.0,5/16/2016,"Good food but VERY long wait..Came here mid day Mon for lunch. Party of 9. restaurant not crowded yet WAITED 40 minutes for soup/salad combos and a few sandwiches. ONe person at the table,who ordered soup salad, had both items come out after 15 min and I had only my salad come out at that time (not  the soup even though it was the same soup como as the guy's who they just brought to the table!).  EVeryone else at table had nothing come out (even other soup lunches!) and those folks just looked at us with our food. AT 35 min spoke with manager who looked into it and within 5 min other orders started coming BUT one person still waited 5 min more for his soup (even though others got their soup!) and I still waited EVEN LONGER for my soup after all other orders on table. ONe would think the same flavor soups should be ready at same time and the soup/salad combos would be served rather quickly and brought out TOGETHER. these aren't rocket science menu items! Despite food being good I wouldn't come here mid day if you have to get somewhere and if you don't have patience . HAve been here once in past and didn't have this problem. Not sure if  service is declining or if this is anomaly.."
Susan M.,"Temecula, CA",20,161,692,3.0,1/8/2014,"We got there right as it started getting busy. Bar area was very crowed and the more they drank-the louder it became. We were there for dinner, seated at a table.   As I was looking the the menu, placing an elbow on the table it landed on a &#%^* BUG!  Menus 2 stars for the uninvited guest. Flinging it on the floor, our server came over grabbed a paper napkin and took it away.  We did not  let a black beetle ruin it.      ****PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN Our marinated chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs, lightly pounded and pan fried to a golden brown. It also had sundries tomatoes an basil ,With cheddar cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli. Served still hot, no heat lamp warm.  Prices are on the high side, so if you are on a low budget...go else where.   Food we had was great, service was awesome. Please let me know if this review was useful, funny or cool.  Thank You so much"
Muriel E.,"San Diego, CA",7,29,178,3.0,1/5/2014,Good environment for football but food takes a while to come out and when we ordered chips and salsa they never came :(    The BJ's brew house blonde craft beer is real refreshing
Ashley L.,"San Diego, CA",3,34,7,5.0,1/5/2014,"I have only been here once, but I did have a very good experience and will definitely return.  We sat in the bar which was packed, but managed to find a couple seats at the bar.  There were a ton of TVs with different games on which was a huge plus.  The bartender informed us that it was happy hour until one of the football games was over which was a very pleasant surprise. We ordered quite a few of the appetizers off the the happy hour menu which were all pretty good and I also tried a couple of their mojitos that was also on happy hour.  They were delicious and made with real fruit which was refreshing.  With the amount of food we ordered and the amount of drinks we ended up drinking the bill was tiny.  The happy hour is definitely the way to go."
Racquel A.,"Gilroy, CA",4,12,,5.0,3/3/2015,Great customer service and food was excellent. My order came out exactly how I ordered it. Atmosphere was perfect for families and friends. I will definitely be coming back!
Q T.,"Del Mar, CA",4,133,41,5.0,12/27/2013,The best deal on their menu is the unlimited soup/salad Love it. Had the chili and a mixed greens Followed by broccoli cheddar and another mixed greens
Joe C.,"San Diego, CA",120,135,142,4.0,11/22/2013,"We were on our way for a quick snack at Smash Burger in Hazard Center when we noticed BJ's looked open? I could swear I was here only a week ago, and they didn't even look close to being ready for business. There were televisions on on the nice patio, a fireplace going on the patio as well, people walking in and out....they were open! They opened on Monday, 4 days earlier. Well screw Smash Burger, this place looks dope! We walked in the cool rotating doors (Love Rotating Doors), and wow, this place is huge! Its like one giant room with high ceilings. On the left wall is the kitchen, and the right wall is a bar, with lots of bottles and colored lights. Its got this cafeteria feel when you first walk in, but not in a bad way.  I manage a restaurant, so I'm paying attention to everything. Having just gone through a grand opening 10 months ago, I know how hard opens can be. They of course had plenty of staff on, the hostess staff were very friendly, and when a host sat us, he was surprisingly knowledgeable for a host. He offered us the rundown on craft beers and cocktails, and even threw in ""his favorite"" was the orange soda, nice suggestive sell guy! I got the orange soda, it was great! I remember thinking, that guy was a fantastic host, he'd be a server in no time.  Our server was nice, did a great job of suggesting appetizers and entrees he liked. They did switch servers on us halfway through the meal, which I don't recommend doing. You cant possibly be worried about labor during the first week of opening. Anyhow, our second waiter was actually better than the first, sorry, he had more personality and definitely felt more comfortable taking about the food.  So for the food: The fried hush pup (I think) with the bacon aioli was bomb. Like little donuts with bacon mayo. The margarita flatbread pizza was good, nothing too special.  Chicken lettuce wraps were better than good, but the spicy mustard is hot! I put too much on and gassed my nose pipes.  The warm cookie with ice cream was too damn good. I gobbled that thing down. We got the ""mini"" version of that dessert, and it was the perfect size.  Overall, we only ate apps and desert, so I'll be back to try entrees and maybe they can squeeze another star out of me.  Nice job new BJ's, I look forward to coming back!"
A Matt P.,"Flower Mound, TX",23,26,16,5.0,11/21/2013,Hopping (pun intended) place. Wait staff know their business and very friendly.  GREAT party atmosphere!
Hunter L.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/11/2015,"Where do we start. We went to the Frazee Rd BJ'S . The place was half filled at the most on a weekend early afternoon just a few days ago. We were seated by a hostess .After about 6 minutes passes the  the manager who seemed a little angry about something or another approached our table. No smiles no greeting. He Began to ask what we wanted to eat. We said we would like drinks first then we will order. He took our drink order walked away and never got our drinks. We know he never told the server because we watched him walk away and he or the server never came back. We were sitting there for another 15 minutes or so and no server and no drinks and no nothing. In fact the server female server with the large arm tattoo walked right by us, looked at us and kept going. HuH? The place was only half filled. Well after seeing we were never to be served we decided to leave. I seen the guy that asked for our drink order and asked him whats up? Why were we not served? He said angrily "" Have a good day""! and pointed to the front door where my wife was already at waiting for me. I asked for the manager at the front desk and this is where we discovered that this angry big guy coming right for us WAS the manager! I would describe this guy as a big angry bully by the way his mean ways were put upon us.  We are both senior citizens. Why would this so called manager treat good customers like this? Why would BJ's hire such a disrespectful angry man. This guy was bout 6 inches right on top of me with his hand pointing at the door telling us seniors to ""Have a GOOD DAY! We left and vowed never to go back to BJ'S Restaurant again. My wife is a really good tipper to. BJ'S lost and the servers to.  The food and beer is high priced and of low quality, so not our lost. We were only in the area on this very hot day and decided to stop here. We were also very thirsty for water and we never even were served anything. Then to have this mean manager tell us to "" have a good day""? Do they have some kind of agenda we do not know about? If this was my restaurant this manager would be FIRED immediately !"
Brittany M.,"Fallbrook, CA",1,7,1,1.0,10/26/2014,"The server was good, the drinks were good, however the food was not!! I have never been here before but i was told it was a hit spot by my friend. We ordered the avacado roll as an appetizer. Then i got the alfredo and he got carnitas fries. The avacado rolls were okay but my friend told me they werent like normal and he was disappointed over spiced and over fried. They also forgot the sauce. His fries were cold and wayyy too salty my alfredo was very disappointing, the pasta was undercooked and there was hardly any sauce plus it had little flavor. The two stars go out to our server and the drinks! Very sad this meal was paid for!"
