Paul D.,"Menifee, CA",125,25,4,4.0,10/5/2015,staff was nice and professional but when you advertise the day lights out Oktoberfest beer via email/pamphlets at the bar and its only week one of October. the customer is going to expect you have it and when you don't you have disappointed customers and I'm one of them :-(
Mike S.,"San Diego, CA",6,84,1,4.0,12/6/2013,"The service was slow, but made up for, partially, by the fact that the food was decent and a great value for lunch. I had the chicken parmesan sandwich off the lunch specials menu and after tax and tip, around $9 for the sandwich and it came with a fairly generous portion of wedge fries, which were also good. Their lunch menu specials are a smaller size, but it was plenty of food for me.  We were a group of about 9 and they were nice enough to give us individual checks. That alone is worth a star.  Parking may be a bit tight outside around the restaurant but I have never had a problem finding parking in the garage at this shopping center."
Lee B.,"San Diego, CA",4,13,27,5.0,12/15/2013,Great place to come for football Sunday. The waitresses are real nice and provide great service. They do beer samples if you don't know which to try. The menu is great. They have a full bar. They make pizza any way you want!
Trisha Z.,"San Diego, CA",77,58,16,5.0,11/29/2014,BJ'S hit it out of the park with their twisted BLT salad.  I was concerned about the siracha sauce but it was flavorful not to spicey.
Kim H.,"San Diego, CA",2,35,75,1.0,8/6/2014,Worst bjs I have ever been to. My family went there a few nights ago and it was a disaster after we were seated it took 45 minutes to order food because the waiter just would not come. Then when food did come it was over cooked and gross then me and my baby went to the bathroom and I went to wash her hands automatic water and all she started crying because it was to hot and it was right there come on if customers can not control the temperature don't put it that hot. It took us 3 hours to get out of there and that was 81 dollars that I really wish I didn't spend. I go to bjs about 3 times a week and never again I think I will go to stacked from now on food is very good and you don't have to wait for the dumb server that wants to avoid you
Denise H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,25,1,4.0,3/31/2015,"This is your typical BJ's food wise.  My review is based mostly on our wonderful server, Justin.  He was awesome, super attentive and friendly!"
Jana M.,"Santee, CA",7,7,,2.0,3/18/2015,The waiter took 25 minutes to return after he brought our drinks. Noticed as we were waiting he was leaned up against a station. After peering at him he came over with an excuse which was fabricated. We were a table of two. My house salad was extremely skimpy. How do you screw up a house salad. (Prepared by the waiter) I have this each time I visit BJs. The manager took care of us however our dinner experience was less then standard.
Jacob P.,"Salem, OR",13,5,1,5.0,2/6/2015,Our waitress had a huge workload and handled it perfectly! We were well taken care of and had great food.
Jesse S.,"Gulfport, MS",32,43,48,3.0,12/28/2013,"My wife and I decided to go here for lunch today. When you first walk away the hostess is very pleasant, and looks to seat you quickly. After we were sat the waiter came and took our drink order recommending beers off first hand. We don't drink, plus I don't like going to places that just start talking about alcohol right away.  We ordered our drinks, he brought them. Placed our orders I went with the brew house burger blue cheese style, and to say the least I think the 3/4 cheese burger from Wendy's taste better. The only reason I give it three stars is because my wife didn't complain for once about her French Toast."
Alicia B.,"San Diego, CA",130,175,100,5.0,7/28/2014,"Look I'm sure this yelp page probably has a bunch of people leaving bad reviews, as over entitled jerks tend to about chains. BJs is always consistent with their food, and I love their brews. The beer flight is totally worth it. and how can you say no to a pizzookie?!  Late night happy hour with discounted mini pizzas is perfect. They also have good lunch specials. I've never had bad service at this BJs. So five stars for always providing good pizza, cookies, and beer. Can't go wrong."
Justin R.,"San Diego, CA",171,14,2,2.0,12/23/2015,I usually love coming here to eat but tonight I had one of the worst waiters ever! He took forever with coming to our table when we first sat down. Then after we got everything ordered it took him forever to bring our food to us. Come to realize he was basically ignoring all of his tables to spend more time at a table full of females. He never once showed his face the whole time I spent eating my food. Never asked us how our food was and then when we asked for two boxes he only showed up back to the table with one for the pizza and then gave a look of disgust when we asked for a second box for my friends wife's food. I don't even know his name because that's how poor of service it was. The only distinguishing thing about him from all the other servers was his beard. I really wish I would have asked to speak to the manager because we were highly disappointed with our service and lack of attention towards us. I never even got my drink refilled and it took him almost 20 minutes to refill my friends drink.
Krystal S.,"Austin, TX",0,15,6,1.0,1/5/2014,"I went here with a party of about 20 people during Sunday football. The happy hour sized food is very small considering the prices. The waitstaff was attentive but we had trouble seeing the chargers game. There's a good amount of tvs all around the restaraunt. When I requested my table I confirmed that we would be able to see the Chargers game, they told me it wouldn't be a problem.  The tv by our table kept flipping through channels but never landed on the chargers game. We literally asked at least 5 different servers to put the charger game on and everyone said they would. This literally went on for 3 hours and they still never turned the game on. A manager came over and we asked her what the problem was. She literally almost started crying and said everyone was asking for different things and she couldn't please everyone. We empathized but reiterated that our party of 20 that literally took up the entire area of the restaraunt wanted our TV changed to the Charger game. She said she would put it on, then walked away and we never saw it. I was really perturbed because I thought we were in San Diego. Why would you have to fight to watch the hometown team? Since we didn't leave one before, here's a tip, next time put on The Chargers game!"
Edward N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",67,20,2,5.0,10/10/2014,"Fantastic service, great atmosphere, awesome food.  I looove the big screen TV's.  I'm glad to live right around the corner to this place. Its awesome to hit up prior to going to the Mission Valley movie theater."
Vanessa X.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,5,2,5.0,1/7/2015,"Bjs brewery the savior. After a awful experience up the parking lot at the hole in the wall Applebees that we walked out on after almost rwo hours of waiting with bad service, we cancelled our order and went to bjs. The staff was so friendly and attentive. Immediately had us seated. Our waiter was amazing, I wish I remembered his name. He was patient and friendly with us especially since we were so undecided. We had never went there before, but he was friendly and welcoming. Once we ordered our appetizers came out hot and yummy and fairly quick. Big difference from waiting for our drinks at applebees. I got my mozzarella and tomato salad, it was god sent I swear. It was so delicious, I always crave one now. The roast beef sandwich was a roast beef sandwich not much you can do there but the fries and everything else was amazing. Our server had great up sale skills. Sold me so quick on a pazookie. Ill be going back for that alone. Its a little pricey but I will go back for the service alone. My fiancee and I had a great meal after the b.s. we had experienced at applebees."
Tom Z.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/30/2015,#staffingissues. It's game night for the Holiday Bowl and they only have enough servers to open 1/2 the dining tables. 12 open tables???? Half hour wait and no one ahead of us
Carrie B.,"Columbus, OH",36,114,11,2.0,6/29/2014,"This place was just ok, I honestly don't see what the big deal is, it's expensive, the beer is decent nothing out of this world or nothing I wouldn't find in any other brewery. We were there to eat and had a couple of beers, our food was again just ok. The server forgot to bring the salad I ordered before my entrée, I ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi and it was as dry as a shoe, the rice was good tho. And my friends food was nothing worth what we paid for. The servers must really not want to make money, they were rude and didn't care if we liked our food or not, no personality nothing, they looked miserable. Quite frankly this place is not worth going back, there are many other places with much better food, drinks and service."
Allie E.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",1,8,3,2.0,7/27/2014,Service is horrible! The hosts and the waiters are sooo slow and forget everything! We waited for them to fill our water because our waiter kept on forgetting about us.  My moms chicken was not cooked all the way and it took 40 minutes to finally get our check. Definitely the worst BJs I have ever been to.
Jules-Tracy M.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/17/2016,"Wanted to express our gratitude to this location. We had a party of 30 that we needed a table for last minute. Being that it was a Saturday at 6 which almost seemed impossible. After calling this location desperately, they were able to accommodate us in 30 mins. Our server Rose and her helper rocked with their organization, quick response and great personality! If you get to this location be sure to request her section, you won't be disappointed! Thanks again to this BJ's entire staff!"
Mary B.,"San Diego, CA",1,34,20,5.0,11/13/2014,"I love BJ's they have such a variety when it comes to their menu, it's the perfect place to go to when you have a group or even a date night. You can't go wrong with having everybody satisfied. I've been to both locations. For date night, I like the grossmont center location it's more cozy, and for groups the mission valley location. The food is really good as well."
Vivian A.,"San Diego, CA",48,80,53,5.0,6/16/2014,"All five stars goes to our amazing server: Mark! He was incredible and its because of him we're coming back next time :) this was only the first. Food was amazing, the place is beautiful! Loved the outside seatings!"
