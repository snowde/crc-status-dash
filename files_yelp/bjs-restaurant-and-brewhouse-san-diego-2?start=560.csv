Josh B.,"San Diego, CA",3,132,,4.0,7/22/2014,"I like that they have such a large selection on their menu. My date only wanted a few appetizers, and although we were disappointed they weren't able to make one of the appetizers the way she wanted (I forgot actually what special order thingy she wanted....you know how women can get with their special orders; it was something about not wanting chipolte cheese in the dish)....she ordered a few other appetizers she loved. One of them was relatively cheap. It was $3.95, for 4 pieces of bread with cheese on them. Have no clue what they were called, but they were amazing. I wanted to order another 20 of them. We got the sliders, which were great, and I always love their Asian chopped salad (I can kid myself into pretending I'm eating healthier). The service was outstanding, as it always is at this location. I had never been impressed with the previous restaurants in this location (Marie's was one of them, can't remember the name of the other expensive place, where I once spent $140 on dinner with a date)."
Jillian T.,"Norfolk, VA",32,35,5,3.0,12/11/2014,"Just ok. Although the spinach artichoke dip app was delicious. FRESH... I mean FRESH fried corn tortilla chips hot out of the fryer. I'd buy just those chips if I could. Amazinggggg. Got soup and sandwich for main course, sandwich kind of sucked: dead wilted and brown lettuce, slimy tomatoes... Yuck. The tortilla soup was pretty good though. Definitely try that!"
Keely P.,"Orangevale, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/6/2014,"Not even one star. Messed up my mom's order by giving her fish tacos not chicken and thought she wouldn't notice. Then gave me a plate of lettuce with 5 croutons and called it a $12 ""Chicken Caesar Salad"""
Michael M.,"Serra Mesa, San Diego, CA",11,1,,5.0,10/17/2014,"The flatbread lunch special was amazeballs. Roasted veggie and baby green salad delicious. Also Carla service was so sweet and nice, I will defiantly be back."
Victoria S.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/2/2014,"I would give them Zero stars if I could.  The food is not ""good"" especially for the price.  I went there on 4 separate occasions and everything I ordered was not good at all.  I ordered appetizers, sandwiches and pasta dishes.   The waitress would disappear and took 20 mins to get Water on out table.  The dessert was messed up.  They gave me the wrong pizookies.  Isnt that what they are known for is their Pizookies?  So you would think they wouldnt mess up which trio I ordered.  Alas, they did. Drinks are expensive.  No real good happy hour appetizers either. Above everything the service is the worst I have had pretty much anywhere.  I dont understand.  They are a huge chain and they can t hire enough help???? BJ's get your menu tasting GOOD and hire some decent servers."
Christy H.,"San Diego, CA",12,307,1,5.0,9/15/2014,"I love this place. Their pizza is really good. I like their flatbreads too. For the first time, I ordered chicken. It was a parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and it was really good! I'm not usually a chicken eater but I have been craving another serving of this. And seriously...who can pass up those yummy warm cookies with ice cream?!"
Monica J.,"Chula Vista, CA",40,11,,5.0,9/14/2014,Never thought I'd want to write a review for BJ's takeout. Did my order online and was disappointed to see the wrong kind of pizza come out. Thought it was just going to be a little hassle and wait. Shout out to Kitchen Manager Mr. Rodriguez who gave the best customer service I've gotten in ages. Brought us lemonades while we waited and made us another pizza himself. Left BJ's beyond satisfied... Thank you!  :)
Ben C.,"La Jolla, CA",38,59,7,5.0,9/12/2015,"This BJ'S is really good. The best item on the menu are their ribs. They have a great sauce and a full rack is pretty big. I came here recently and the rack was actually huge.  Even the waiter thought it looked bugger then normal. Right now their Octoberfest beer is a great seasonal. I tried their pizza for the first time in years too and it was really good. The deep dish meat lovers. And of course, the pizookie was really good. Definitely recommend the oreo cookie one."
Rikyah B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,4,,5.0,12/17/2014,"I love this place. The service is good! I love the santa fa rolls and the pasta which I get all the time. Idk what I would do if they got rid of santa fa spring rolls. One thing I don't like about BJ's is that, each BJ's cooks there food different. Another thing I really don't like are the lines, but that is understandable, it is BJ's. What is not understandable, is the long wait for your food every single time."
Jose D.,"San Diego, CA",27,33,16,1.0,8/13/2014,"First off the place looks nice luv the decor but.... The food not a fan of, ordered the potato skins and i dont know about u guys but i like my bacon well cooked where it crunches in ur mouth not the bacon that u have to pull apart with your teeth. Next up was the pizza was still doughy in the middle, cheese was melty but not cooked. Not happy at all. Was here on a date and he ordered the shrimp scampi and shit was bland and flavorless.. How can this place say they are the best place to go eat? We sat next to another couple who tried to get their attention several times after they got their salad yet no fork.. Got pizza and guess what still no fork! Damn how many do they have to ask to get silverware?? I dont recommend this place i know its just my experience but you all are grown adults you can decide for your self. At the end they did make up for it tho.. A free desert... Yumm that was the best part because its hard to fuck up on ice cream just saying"
Zach C.,"San Diego, CA",93,24,9,1.0,8/9/2015,"Love the food, however ok this occasion I came with my wife's family from Trinidad. Yes, they look different than me (im white) and yes they can be difficult to understand (thick accents). And yes they felt as though the waitresses were just annoyed as to have to deal with the entire table OF 18! Waitress initially refused to split checks because she didn't listen to my wife the first time second time, she walked away from her as she was explaining it. (We had asked this initially upon sitting down with the hostess). Then told well you're going to need to wait 30 minutes in a rude tone almost as if to convince us not to want that done. Of course we waited. The manager was kind friendly and understanding) (young blond, thank you). Anyway, for a post wedding lunch, we felt like they couldn't get rid of us sooner but we enjoyed our family time but we won't be coming back here sorry. Not even for pazookie. I'm white so I rarely experience feeling outcast for my appearance or dialect, but 17 of members of my new family sure did.  First time in California for them, and at BJs. And the last. 604 dollar bill. Pretty sure the tip we reflective on that stay. Next time we'll just like into an In and out. But don't worry this to us was not reflective on my overall BJ experiences . Just don't hesitate to speak honor your frumpy waitress is having a bad day and wants to make her unhappiness become your (or 18 people's) unhappiness. Maybe I could have offered her a job. I work with at risk children and I am disrespectes hit kicked spit on and assaulted on a regular basis. Maybe this lady just needed some perspective."
Lisa M.,"San Diego, CA",0,103,1,2.0,3/17/2014,"Place gets busy during happy hour and their bar area is small compared to the rest of the place, they should have expanded that or had a better more efficient layout. Staff needs to be better trained, at least pretend you care about your job and doing what you're paid to do...that includes the manager, he stinks. Anyways food is not very good, and this place has nothing to really offer, happy hour is not good. Also parking in this plaza is terrible and that's it."
Rafael M.,"Escondido, CA",63,19,3,5.0,8/30/2014,"I been to Bjs a few times and usually is an ok experience, but this time I had an amazing experience all thanks Ryan, he has been the best waiter I had in Bjs"
Kitty C.,"San Diego, CA",0,28,9,3.0,11/1/2015,"We were there previously and the food just didn't stand up to the prices so we had not gone back. But we got a gift card so we wanted to use it. Things didn't seem good right in the door. I went in while my husband parked the car. The hostess was helping someone so I politely waited. About 3-4 minutes later another couple came in and walked in front of me (rude) and after about a minute she took their names to be seated. I stood there wondering if I was suddenly invisible! I told the hostess I'd been waiting while she was helping the other customer (I know she saw me waiting!) and I hope she didn't just put the other people before me. She never said she didn't see me, she just said she was sorry and she had me seated next. Thankfully the service was good. The food was OK. Again, I think they are over priced. I had the Asian salad and my husband had steak. The salad was good but his steak was tough. He had a side salad and the croutons were stale. We shared a dessert and got the strawberry baked beignet and it was delicious! So things ended well at least. I don't think we'd go back anytime soon since overall it doesn't knock our socks off."
Kira E.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/3/2015,"Excellent food. We ordered the filet medium-rare, along with the tomato bisque and ceasar salad. Everything cooked to perfection. Tried the peanut butter pizzookie dessert. Also wonderful. Helpful professional staff. Will come again"
Megan H.,"California City, CA",15,40,8,5.0,5/28/2014,So I came here with kal and my grandma! We decided to take her out to eat while we were in san diego visiting. The service was great! The food was amazing. We got a large SWEET PIG. which is hawain pizza. It was great we ate it all! We also got stuffed mushrooms for an appatizer which were also very good!. I had a code to get 25 dollars off..I showed the waiter my screen shot of the code and accedently scrolled over to a picture of me painted as a cat. .....it was embarrasing lol
Vanessa M.,"San Diego, CA",102,16,8,2.0,8/21/2014,I love BJ's but this is the worst one I have ever been to. The service was horrible! The only reason why they get two stars is because the food was good and the host was nice...
Eduardo O.,"San Diego, CA",2,5,,2.0,10/20/2014,Really slow service during Sunday morning football... bacon and sausage were raw.. took about 20 for fully cook meat to arrive...they also forgot to include potatos... took another 20 mins for them to bring potatoes...on side note the bloody Mary was good and the happy hour price was decent..
sarah m.,"La Habra, CA",2,2,,2.0,9/14/2014,"Food is typical bjs food. Our server was nice. Hot as hell. The server said that the manager is cheap and doesn't turn the air on. We dude, you're losing money Cus I will never be back."
