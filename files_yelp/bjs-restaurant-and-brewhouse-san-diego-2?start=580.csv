Theresa B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",437,171,369,3.0,2/26/2014,The food is good as is the service. Walked over here from the hotel. I had the Moroccan spiced salmon and subbed the couscous for mashed potatoes. The portions are really big and I needed that since I didn't eat lunch. Nice meal in a comfortably BJ's atmosphere.
Jane K.,"Austin, TX",26,68,15,4.0,7/12/2014,We came for dinner while staying at the Doubletree next door.  Appetizers were fantastic.  The rest of the food was ok - standard chain fare.  The best thing about our dinner was our fantastic waitress Bonnie.  She was very nice and took very good care of my four kids and me.  My youngest Charlie said she works so hard and is the best waitress he ever met.
Vanessa C.,"San Diego, CA",44,48,8,2.0,4/12/2014,This place oozes mediocrity and is overpriced as well. Only dish worth a damn is the balsamic chicken. Pizza is weak. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for pizza. Anything else is made way better at outback steakhouse down the street.
Michelle H.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",12,51,4,4.0,7/26/2014,The good here is so delicious. I usually go with the Cajun chicken pasta and of course it's hard not to pass up a pizookie for dessert. One thing I wish they would do is add more calorie conscious meals. Last night I noticed mine was 1100 calories!!!! That is crazy and the light offering ranger from 600-750 which isn't so light really. The beer here is good also since it is a brewhouse. I prefer blondes and they only have one on the menu from what I saw. Although it is a chain I still love the food here!
Kara C.,"Laguna Beach, CA",8,7,,2.0,12/6/2013,This is the second time we have come to this location and it was all sorts of chaos and confusion. We had multiple food and drink orders come to our table that weren't ours and the waiters/waitresses definitely need more training. Our waitress tonight told us happy hour was over at 6 (it's over at 7) and denied our order/inquiry. I then found a happy hour menu that clearly states that it is over at 7. She came back over and told me I was wrong! I then showed her the menu and she was hesitant to admit she misspoke. It then took 25 minutes to get my new drink order. :(
Danielle B.,"Bonita, CA",3,12,10,5.0,9/20/2014,My fiancé and I love this location. We are always seated so quickly and our servers are always friendly and accommodating. The food is excellent and we make it a point to only go to this BJ's location because they never disappoint. I was pregnant at our first visit and the hostess made sure I was comfortable and seated where we wished (and where I could fit haha!). Absolutely love this BJ's and we will keep going back.
Tanya S.,"Bermuda Dunes, CA",166,11,15,4.0,3/27/2014,Morgan W. was our waitress and I have to say she was outstanding. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the chips we a bit to salty for our taste and she took it off our bill no problem. The grilled pork chops are delicious and be sure to get a pizzookie.
Felipe E.,"San Diego, CA",0,30,92,3.0,8/15/2014,"Went there last night. My girlfriend and I only ordered apps for happy hour. They took way too long to bring them out. About 30 mins. The mini deep dish pizza was terrible, it had almost a spoiled taste. Not the best BJ's location."
Peter H.,"Waukegan, IL",28,19,1,4.0,11/11/2014,This was our first visit to this restaurant.   The wait was a little long which was completely understandable with it being Veterans Day ans them having a free lunch special.  The food was even better than we had hoped.  The only down side was the service which again may have been due to them being busy.  We will try this location again because we over all really enjoyed ourselves.  Definitely worth stopping in for lunch.
Priscilla W.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,16,1,2.0,2/26/2014,"I love BJ's but worst experience ever from take out... I order the Cajon pasta and when I get to my office they supplied no utensils, no napkins, then I open my pasta and I'm missing my chicken. The point of take out is to be fast... I had to go back get the chicken and come back to a cold pasta, never again I'm sticking to Applebee's"
Tommy S.,"San Diego, CA",32,40,36,1.0,1/11/2015,"Can I just start with the service is terrible. Okay every birthday I like to treat myself out to a nice dinner. Since this BJ's was somewhat new to Mission Valley My partner and I thought this would be the perfect place. Well let's just say I was extremely disappointed. For starters it took a while to get our order taken but when we did I ordered the house top sirloin, now I really like my steak well done. When I got my steak I was asked if I would like some A1 steak sauce and I said yes. Well it never came, so after waiting and with no one passing by we decided to just eat. When I cut into my steak it was pink. So when I mentioned this to the waitress all I got was I am sorry. I then asked what happened to the A1 sauce and she chuckled and said oh I'm sorry again. On my bill there was no discount offered. The only good thing that came out of this night was that the Chargers won their game. Now I know I should not go to a place like this to order steak and this night proved that. So if you took the time to read this please save your time and money and go someplace else."
Tricia C.,"Spring Valley, CA",16,39,5,4.0,7/6/2014,"Food quality: excellent.  Beverage quality: excellent.  Service: a little slow,  but it has been really busy every time I've come here. Over all this is a good place to go. I have been to another BJ'S and this one is a step above.   I drive farther to come to this location."
Michelle L.,"Coronado, CA",14,16,3,5.0,8/1/2015,I like this location best over C.V.  They have a new dish - brussels sprouts that were about the most delicious thing I've ever encountered!  Seriously...a must try (if you like brussels sprouts).  i happen to love them and whatever they do to them...omg...incredible.  The calamari is always a solid choice - one of my favorites. And the pizzas - thin crust? Can't get much better...
Carol M.,"Rolando, San Diego, CA",182,20,8,3.0,1/20/2014,"I've been to almost all of the BJs in San Diego and this one had just opened up so I decided to try it out.  Don't get me wrong, I love dining at the other locations but my experience here was not the best.  At first impression everyone was really nice and it seemed like I would be having the usual dining experience I would have had at BJ's but as the evening went on it got worse. Since they are a new location their menu is much smaller but our server failed to tell us that so we didn't know what options had changed from the traditional menu.  My boyfriend always orders the Chicken Parmigiana every single time we eat at a BJs and he always specifies 'the one with the spaghetti noodles' because they have menu items with the same name.  When we saw that they had brought out the wrong dish, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken instead of the Chicken Parmigiana, we kindly corrected them and patiently said that it was okay because this had happened before.  Two things went wrong after this: the foodrunner didn't communicate with the server and so they brought out yet another wrong dish. After bringing out two wrong dishes and ten minutes of painfully trying to explain what the freaking Chicken Parmigiana was, our server finally said 'Oooh yeah I'm sorry, I don't know what that is because our menu here is smaller since we've just opened up'.  (Obviously they hired servers who have no knowledge about their business or their traditional menu). In the end, my boyfriend ate something he did not intend to order at all, it was brought out twice so it was cold, and they basically threw the chicken on a bed of boiled spaghetti noodles with no sauce.  Okay, they tried to make the Chicken Parmigiana but if we had been told that the menu was different from the get go, all of this could have been avoided and I might have given this location a better rating. For now, I would suggest eating at the more established BJs locations if you are a regular and like to order the same thing because their menu here is reduced and the servers, unfortunately, won't tell you that until you've realized that you wasted your time and money..and the company's as well."
Anna R.,"Sonoma, CA",37,57,111,3.0,12/8/2013,"I can confidently say the only good part about the meal was the food. The hosts are awful and so unintelligent!! The wait to be seated took forever, 40+ minutes. The waitress was clearly barely trained and never took my empty glass I set at the end of the table for her to take. We got calamari, balsamic glazed chicken, and top sirloin steak, all of which were very good. Thank you to the chef for being the only good employee there! We definetly won't come back, or at least for a few months until they fix all this."
Leele C.,"City Heights, San Diego, CA",2,29,15,1.0,7/12/2014,"The service was okay, ordered their shrimp scampi pasta that came out very bland. Parmesan crusted chicken(super salty) that came with a couple of pieces of broccoli and mashed potatoes that was also very bland.  their fried calamari came out very soggy and the total came out to $72! With a waitress that wasn't so helpful about the items in the menu and disappeared 90% of the time we needed her. Plus,  the place was practically empty when we went. Definitely not coming back."
Jessica F.,"San Diego, CA",252,98,10,3.0,12/28/2013,Mediocre service. Somewhat timely. Would like to see a little more excitement in the environment. Will have to return at a busier time to see if they can handle the traffic. Love the specials and it's nice that everything is so new and clean.
Mindy N.,"San Diego, CA",34,494,4,4.0,4/19/2014,"Love this new BJ's location! The restaurant and bar areas both are great sizes, not to mention the outdoor patio with fire pit is a great place to kick back! The food, drinks and beer selections are really great! We had a large group and tried a variety of things: pizza, spinach/artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls, crispy calamari and santa fe spring rolls - everything was great!!! Their pizza is one of our favs and for sure their gluten-free crust for their pizza is one of the best out there!"
Gleeba P.,"Palatine, IL",0,23,1,3.0,6/4/2015,"Jambalaya tasted exactly like Zatarin's Jambalaya Rice Mix!! Ew that was another visit last week. But today's visit... bae and I ordered calamari and it was so disgusting, tasted old, and definitely not hot. Then we ordered the Root Beer Glazed Wings and Big Poppa's Desert Gold and the Big Poppa came with one less wing. Not a big deal but that was what I picked and I was so hungry and also disappointed with the calamari. I would have to say the service was very great Ashley K. comped the calamari and made sure we got that last wing with an extra, newly made. The atmosphere is wonderful! Great place to watch the NBA FINALS!"
Brad W.,"Lexington, KY",2,21,3,1.0,2/16/2014,"Disappointed.  This place looked so promising from the outside.  I'll make this quick... My beer was warm and my pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut, which is never good.  The boneless buffalo wings were just ok but the worst part of our experience was the service.  Which is the easiest thing to get right.  It was inattentive from the beginning, and though she was nice, it went so far as my friend didn't get his order until the rest of us were finishing up.  With all the other places to eat in fashion valley, skip this one."
