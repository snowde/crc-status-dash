Anna G.,"San Diego, CA",5,32,5,2.0,9/8/2017,"I've been here a few times because I like the BJ's chain, but this one is a mess. If you sit in the ""open seating"" it is unlikely you will get service unless you stop someone. We ended up waiting for quite sometime because the one server running the outside table was so overwhelmed. When I finally got my order it was incorrect. The guy was nice about it, but there really needs to be more staff and less chaos, felt bad for the guy."
Michelle C.,"Oak Park, San Diego, CA",24,33,5,5.0,6/13/2017,"My daughter wanted to go to BJs for her grad night celebration. We had a group of 9 and most, like myself had never been to a BJs before. ...well at least the restaurant... The service was outstanding.  Our server was super sweet and helpful.  Legit had the patience of Job with all our questions.  The food was great, drinks were plentiful.  We will with out a doubt be back."
Dan W.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/19/2017,"Great spot to grab a few beers. The bartender Ryan is great. He embodies what top notch service should be. Nice as can be...helpful...and knowledgeable. They were out of my favorite IPA, so his suggestion on the Piranha was on point."
Brandon J.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,19,16,5.0,4/29/2017,"Visited San Diego for a week and paid a visit here many times during our stay. The Food is seriously some of the Best compared to any Chain Restaurant [Yardhouse, Applebees, Cheesecake (comparable, just different)].. What really made our visits was the fact we were well taken care of by the Servers Dylan H and Norris N who were the best servers we have had at a restaurant. We wish we could have him as our waiter every restaurant we go to now :(      More good news, if you visit on Saturday or Sunday Morning they have a simple but Delicious Breakfast menu! Another BIG advantage is they are open until 12am during the week and 1am on Fri & Sat which is late for the area, most places close at 9 or 10!      They are often busy, but you can seat yourself in the cocktail area which is convenient during rush hour. Unfortunately if you don't go to cocktail you sometimes have to wait up front for a host to show up to get seated especially during the daytime hours it seems. Huge selection of House and Guest beers to choose from (Their beers are All Very good!) They also have an extensive menu some of our favorites were; Deep Dish Pizza's, Spaghetti & Meatballs, Fried Artichokes Appetizer, Siracha Brussell Sprouts Appetizer and their Monkey Bread Pizookie for Dessert!"
Jo E.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,4,1.0,11/3/2017,"I Went  for lunch and it was the worst experience I ever had at any of the BJ's I've been too. I was very disappointed in their service especially when we complained about the food not being anywhere near what the picture looked like , both the manager and waiter argued about how the food was cooked and prepped. Apparently the manager took a test on how to prep the chicken but it looked like the chef used no bread crumbs and tried to mask it with burnt cheese. Even our appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) was very burnt as well. Will not be coming back to this location, possibly any BJ's restaurant at all smh."
Sergio G.,"Spring Valley, CA",96,55,30,4.0,6/11/2017,This place is truly a great restaurant. Honestly the portions match the price and the quality is amazing! Had the avocado rolls and was highly impressed! Had a date with my lady and she enjoyed the food and service. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. Had the grilled cheese buffalo sandwich and it was alright. It's a little dry but it's not bad. Fries were different and definitely fresh. Loved it all around.
Kyle J.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",6,8,,2.0,6/10/2017,"Very sad, this was the go to spot.  Prices seemed to have risen yet the quality has definitely gone down.  I've gone to this specific restaurant for the past six years and I've definitely been let down.  I hope the owners re-evaluate their restaurant to make customers more happy.   Barbacoa cauliflower taco basically a tomato taco with cauliflower crumbs PLEH with a side of cold bird food  Late night burger, tastes exactly like its title.  Except if i was intoxicated it probably would taste better."
Austin L.,"San Diego, CA",301,27,43,5.0,6/6/2017,"I had a great dining experience at BJ's Mission Valley, and I definitely see myself coming back.  I came with my girlfriend and we got seated almost immediately as we walked in. The host was nice and polite even after we declined his offer to sit at the bar and requested a booth. After being seated, we were quickly given menus and time to peruse through them. Our server was very helpful and polite when taking our orders.  When the food arrived, it did not disappoint. I went with the rack of ribs and my girlfriend got the chicken fettuccini Alfredo. The ribs were amazing. They came out cooked to perfection and were not served burnt and dry like some locations (Bj's @ La Jolla). The Alfredo was also delicious with a nice warm dinner roll that was incredibly fluffy.  The service was also great. Our server was the gentleman named James who looked like Conor McGregor. He was kind as well as fast. He refilled our drinks quickly and retrieved condiments such as honey mustard for me when I had requested some. I didn't feel like I was waiting around for anything which was awesome.  Overall it was a great dinner. BJ's is great to eat at especially late at night since they're open late. I only wish I hadn't filled up on calamari because I would have liked to get another pizookie!"
Vanessa V.,"El Cajon, CA",10,12,,5.0,8/21/2017,Great for a late happy hour!!!  i am horrible on names but the Bartender (the one with glasses on his 40' s) makes the BEST lemon drop martinis !! anywhere i go i always compare their lemon drop martinis and they just don't make it like you. he is always polite .they have a deal for $7 i think and you get to choose 4 draft beers that you get to try . The Grilled chicken Alfredo pasta  is good . i like the Calamaris . and their pizza .i totally recommended for a late happy hour . the bar is open and self seating   and it is good for big groups .
Ramona G.,"San Diego, CA",3294,1439,1446,4.0,3/24/2016,"This BJs location is A-Okay! I've been here a few times now, most recently last night. I usually order a pizza but last night I ordered the root beer-glazed boneless wings $11.95 which were surprising really good and sweet! the wings have the perfect light crunch to them. Their pizzokies are always good too! The few occasions that I've had their BJs rootbeer, I didn't really like it. Not for me. I prefer Pepsi over it. Just my preference.  BJs is usually busy but we came on a Wednesday night and there was no wait. It's a nice place to go for large groups. A go-to restaurant in Mission Valley :)"
Chelsey C.,"Austin, TX",29,4,,1.0,9/4/2017,Sitting in there now trying to have a nice dinner with family. Drinks don't get refilled. Food is cold. Forgot about my mother pizza after they gave her the wrong one.  The mashed potatoes were instant and tasted terrible. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone.
Saba M.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/24/2017,"Okay, so today I went to BJs with my family to celebrate a new job.  I order the top sirloin. I was excited because my daughter wanted to pay and she was so happy about the fact that we actually let her pay for us.  We got the food and my meat was so dried up. The asparagus was old and wrinkled, it was as if someone had returned their food and then they just put it on my plates.  On top of that, we waited 40 mins after we received the food. Waiter was very friendly, but we were so disappointed in the food."
Cindy C.,"Lawrence, MA",215,34,5,4.0,10/23/2017,I like this place because 1. It's close to home 2. It has great customer service 3. The specials are awesome ! Specially in Sunday's when you want to do some happy hour while watching football. It's not too crowded also which helps when you are watching your favorite game
James C.,"Lompoc, CA",1,120,70,4.0,5/27/2017,"Another great dinner at BJ's and another Yelp update.  I've been using the BJ's app on my smartphone...and it has been a bit difficult to figure out.  But, I'm gettng it.  Problem is, I don't use the app to reserve a table or do any meal planning beforehand...so when there is a coupon or deal offered, I don't see it until after we've ordered our meals.  Tonight I had a free Pizookie, but missed a free appetizer.  Nuts.  Got the Pizookie, but I'm afraid the free appetizer will expire before we are back in the area again.   Had the turkey burger again tonight.  It was excellent. I highly recommend it. Wife had a top sirloin steak, medium, which I was pleased to see was still pink in the middle.  She said it was excellent.  We both had add-on ceasar salads.  Guess what?  They were excellent.  Daughter had the Brewhouse Burger.  It was excellent.  Other daughter had two beautiful pork chops...they were excellent.  Son had a pulled pork sandwich.  It was.....Excellent!   It was LOUD in BJ's tonight.  I mean, rattle my fluffing eardrums LOUD.  I don't like that.  Take a star off for the management not being able to control the dining atmosphere more directly.  Figure something out, guys.  It gets painfully loud in your place and many of your regulars don't like it.   JC (elite '18 in my own mind)."
Melanie T.,"San Diego, CA",153,62,144,4.0,9/24/2016,"Gotta live BJ'S for their famous deep dish pizzas and pazookies (cookie pizzas with ice cream on top!) This review is for a mid-week lunch with a group of co-workers: Ambience: a little dark but great for the brewery vibe (they brew their own beers!) Food: ordered the lunch special, half California club with thin fires and cup of broccoli cheddar soup (a steal for under $9) Notes: cali club is more like a chicken breast panini, not you typical cold club with thin deli meat stacked high. This one was served hot. Broccoli cheddar soup was more cheese/velveta tasting than a true soup. Not the best food experience but I know their other items are on point. Birthday boy got a free mini pazookie, which was delish! Since we had a larger group our experience was a little longer than we liked since we were on a schedule, but other smaller tables were turned over at a decent pace, so definitely hit them up for lunch! Tips: join their BJ rewards program for coupons and free items."
Lindsay H.,"Los Angeles, CA",271,85,28,2.0,4/30/2017,"I hate to give this place a 2 star honestly. I used to come here with a group of over 25 ppl and one server who also was the bartender was able to handle our requests just fine. Where is he tonight??? I brought my girlfriend in here for a much needed cocktail, appetizer, and salmon dinner. We waited way to long to get waters, and then to finally make an order for the amount of customers here on a slowish Sunday night w plenty of staff.  Our waitress doesn't have her sh*t together n may want to revisit the menu and take some fish oil supplements or something. Take a break, go collect yourself and come back killin it. I've been a server i know what it's like‍ but cmon"
Jennica S.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",639,405,1362,4.0,2/15/2016,"I've been to one other BJ's location several times for different occasions. The main thing I would eat would be their BBQ chicken pizza and their A+ pizookies, which are both tasty! This was the first time I've been to this location and I ordered something completely different, and I was happy with the outcome!  My best friend and I each got fruity cocktails that were both pretty, and strong. We shared an appetizer and a burger. The server told us the chicken would come with 10 wings, and the receipt even said 10 piece wings, but our plate came with 9! We weren't going to be annoying about it and it wasn't a big deal, but those lemon pepper dry rub wings were so good that we wish we had that last wing.  We shared the bacon-guacamole deluxe burger and it was good. The downfall was that there was no smoked bacon really. Rather than crispy pieces of bacon like in other burgers, there were minimal microscopic pieces mixed in with the guacamole. The thin cut fries were amazing, though.  I wish we could've gotten a pizookie, especially the salted caramel one, but we were too full. Instead of a 3, I gave this place 4 stars because our server, Samuel, was the best. He was hilarious and helpful!"
Julie P.,"San Diego, CA",55,2,,3.0,1/1/2018,"Service at this restaurant is very disappointing compared to the one in Temecula.  I live in Murrieta and my family and friends are frequent visitors of BJ's in Temecula.  Last night, 12/31/17, b/w 8: 30-9:45 was the worst experience in this restaurant.  The appetizer came out cold after waiting for over 30 minutes.  I ordered 3 appetizers and we were served 2.  We asked the closest person who was cleaning the table for utensils and napkins and the poor man went somewhere and came back with a handful of napkins but no utensils so my husband got up and got it himself at the hostess station.  We also asked for plates so we can share the appetizer but never arrived.  We raised our hands frequently for water refill.  Our main course came out cold (again).  We had left overs so I asked for 3 to go boxes.  I asked a couple of people for a bag but everybody seemed too busy so my husband got up and asked the person at the take out counter and the guy gave him one.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the dessert.  Otherwise, I would have given it 1 star.  I wouldn't stop going to BJ's because of this experience but I sure would be very hesitant about going back to Mission Valley."
Amber K.,"San Diego, CA",18,2,,2.0,11/10/2017,"I was a huge fan of this restaurant when I lived in Tucson but since moving to San Diego I have been nothing but disappointed. I have visited two separate times, the last being tonight when they are holding their Veteran's Day promotion. Both time the service has been lackluster. Tonight is a busy night given the Veteran's Day promotion but at the same time it was severely lacking in effort. There was a wait just to put our name on the list. We ended up sitting in the bar area but moved due to the extended wait time for a refill on beverages. Our server visited the party at our communal table but failed to ask if our drinks (which were empty) needed to be refilled. Our food took an exceptionally long time to arrive and the pizookie that was included in the meal took another almost 20 minutes to arrive, prompting us to miss the movie we had planned to see. I understand the fact that offering such a promotion will draw crowds but at the same time given that management should have scheduled staff to accommodate such business."
Liz M.,"San Diego, CA",397,124,758,3.0,3/17/2016,"Came here during happy hour and sure enough the bar was packed! I wasn't surprised.  The deals are pretty good... $2 shareable appetizers/flat breads and $1 off beer/wine Monday - Friday 3PM-7PM.  Our server was extremely sweet! Given she was busy since it was so hectic and everyone needed assistance. She had her game face on and still managed. We came for the free ""Pi""zookie since it was 3/14 along with the happy hour offers. We had asked her about it and she honored what we said about being reward members! She also gave us a free Oreo birthday one since my boyfriend didn't want to try the new monkey bread they offered.  Love love love BJ's food selection and drinks so I'm not going to complain about that!"
