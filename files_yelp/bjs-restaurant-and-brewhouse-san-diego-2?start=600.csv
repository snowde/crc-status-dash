Gerald M.,"Escondido, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/9/2015,My first time at this restaurant and I was impressed.  The pizza was great but the service was even better.  We were with a group of eight and our waitress was excelent.  She even asked if we wanted individual receipts.  This place goes to the top of my list.
Mark S.,"Long Beach, CA",27,6,1,5.0,8/3/2014,We ate lunch here today and had the s'mores pzookie that has just been introduced. It was an amazing combination of chocolate cookie with peanut butter covered with perfectly roasted marshmallows and vanilla ice cream. I hope they make this a regular item.
Matt B.,"North Chicago, IL",0,14,,1.0,11/14/2013,"Made a reservation and showed up to a disappointing, ""the wait is 1hr right now sir!"" If the hostess simply would have actually done her job and taken my reservation down I would have most likely enjoyed my meal, Instead she wasted a party of fours time. Don't waste your time with this new Bjs"
Patrick P.,"San Diego, CA",0,34,1,5.0,6/18/2014,"The location of this BJ's has been a revolving door for restaurants that have come and gone, but BJ's has found a way to make full use of the large space, and I think they're going to stick.  With the quiet and reasonably priced Hazard Center Ultra Star movie theater in the same complex, this is a great place to come for dinner and a movie."
Hershell O.,"San Diego, CA",1,3,,4.0,9/15/2014,Awesome Craft Beer Selection at decent prices. Had two: One Nutty Brewnette and one Jeremiah Red. Both were amazing!
Rudy R.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",26,4,2,1.0,7/19/2014,I would rather go to mcdonalds. Waitress got my friends order wrong and my other friends calamari was burnt. Food took like 40 minutes even though we ordered only appetizers. Waiters and waitresses kept dropping glasses all around us including a couple across from us that got soda spilled over them.
Rick K.,"Vista, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/22/2015,"Food was ok, Hostessing was poor.  They made me feel as if I was just another customer.  They did not smile or greet us."
melissa l.,"San Diego, CA",321,108,2,4.0,4/2/2014,"Gave BJ's another chance since they have us a gift card to make up for terrible pizza last time. I ordered the kale and Brussels sprouts salad and it was so yummy!!! My mother in law ordered a thin crust pizza with zucchini and it was amazing also. Well done BJ's, you won us back!"
Jade T.,"San Diego, CA",84,228,166,5.0,3/15/2014,"Food here is so good! Everything is served piping hot and full of flavor! The Moroccan Spiced Salmon, Chicken Baked Potato, and Chicken Tortilla Soup are all worth coming back for! Next time I'll have to stop sampling food from all my coworkers, I was to full to try the desserts! They all looked good!"
Diane G.,"Coolidge, AZ",0,48,15,4.0,8/19/2015,"The menu has great variety and our food was presented beautifully.  The beer choices make the place, of course, but other drinks including non alcoholic ones are notable as well. The potsticker appetizers were well cooked. The Ravioli was a good portion size and the garlic toast just right.  The triple cookies are larger and more than expected,  even 2 of us working on them left some on the plate."
Carolyn T.,"San Diego, CA",57,120,9,3.0,11/25/2013,"My daughter and I have been wanting to try this place out for years. When they opened this location we couldn't wait to see what they had to offer. We walked in to about ten employees waiting by the hostess desks...odd, but maybe they were waiting to clock in?!?! We gave the lady the number in our party and she told us to step to the side and wait to be seated. She had lovely eyelids...we never once had eye contact as she was busy typing away. Seconds later we were whisked away by our hostess we gave us a very well rehearsed sales speech about their specials ( i hate the ""our specials of the night"" speeches! It's like a website with flash) i kindly interrupted her to ask where she was from,she was very sweet, handed us our menus and disappeared into the sea of employees. Our first...yes first waitress walked over quickly and I told us her name. She was kind of a blur,either she downed ten cans of red bull or had someplace to be. I noticed a waiter behind her standing with a stopwatch....ummm okayyyyy lol. I guess she was just our drink waitress since we never saw her again. A second chick brought  us our drinks,a third took our order and maybe dropped off our food. All the waitresses were pleasant,not one had a bad attitude, but not one went above and beyond to make our visit memorable. I'm assuming most are still training or perhaps just stalk one another as most had a confused coworker following them.  We noticed a group of workers off to the side just standing.....BJs cult?!?!? Lol  Now for the important stuff.... I ordered their stout... The worst stout I have ever had. It tasted watered down,not strong and full of flavor. Maybe it was an old batch?!? I couldn't finish it.  For food we had the roasted veggie flatbread... It was ehhh. The mac and cheese..again ehhh. As well as the the cookie and cream desert...tasted familiar.  I would go back,maybe it a few months...when the customers out number the staff lol. This time I will aim for an entree....perhaps this will increase some stars ;)"
Ken H.,"San Diego, CA",162,57,60,3.0,2/4/2014,The only reason for a 3 star was because I called before I got off work to see if the had a specific beer and they sayed yes when I arrive it was sold out so I just got something else and left...tonite fail
Jason R.,"San Diego, CA",2,5,,5.0,7/8/2014,"I love BJ's (pun intended). The food here is great, atmosphere is nice, impressive tap beer selection, friendly staff, and I highly recommend the berry cider they brew here."
Erica C.,"San Diego, CA",7,34,8,3.0,4/9/2014,"I've always loved Bjs so when I heard about a new location opening in mission valley,  I definitely wanted to try it out. Usually go to the one in La Mesa. We only had a few minute wait. We were seated in a booth. We ordered drinks along with our appetizers and entrees. We enjoyed our drinks but there was no sign of the waitress after we had finished. Ordered another round while we waited. Surprisingly, our entrees came before our appetizers which I was a little disappointed. Food was good, but was not happy at all with service. Maybe saw our waitress 2-3 times the whole dinner. The place is beautifully done, but until service improves I will probably stick to the La Mesa location."
Steph R.,"San Diego, CA",60,57,1,4.0,2/13/2015,I love this place. They have great food and drinks! The service is sometimes a little slow but not always. Good location and plenty of parking.
Terri S.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,33,1.0,12/23/2014,How does a restaurant chain eliminate a appetizer staple of Boneless Buffalo wings? What are you thinking !!! Won't come here for the games anymore... Re-think people! Pizza Beer Wings Sports ! That us your clientele
Wendy V.,"San Diego, CA",17,12,1,1.0,4/30/2014,"Wednesday night at 9pm we came in for dinner and drinks . I  wish it would of allowed me to do ZERO stars. Our waiter was the worst !!!! our waiter eric p. (#318) didn't even asked us if we wanted another beer , that's less money for you guys , never asked if we wanted desert  either . bad bad horrible service   , we had to ask another server for a side and for our bill . Oh but when he came to pick up our credit cards , he was rushing us with his hand out . Really ??? . I felt uncomfortable and not welcomed . As much as I liked the food ... I won't be coming back to this location . This place wasn't even busy , he should of paid more attention to his area than watching the basketball game that my boyfriend caught him doing numerous times ..."
Lauren W.,"San Diego, CA",0,24,3,4.0,4/28/2014,Really great drinks awesome food selections. Thai shrimp lettuce wraps are amazing. The desserts are amazing. Everyone knows the cookies. Pomegranate margaritas are amazing. Good service. Large dining areas.
Quincey Q.,"San Diego, CA",1,34,,4.0,7/1/2014,"Awesome place. Great service the waiters made sure we were taken care of, the drinks were good and the seating was nice outside on the patio. I'll definitely come here again."
Cristina d.,"San Diego, CA",330,40,47,2.0,3/14/2014,"I came in for a birthday dinner and 3 of my friends including me ordered the grilled salmon... All of them were burnt! And tasted burnt! Other than that, the server was good an atmosphere was good also."
