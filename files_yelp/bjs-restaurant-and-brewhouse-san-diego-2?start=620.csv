Danny A.,"Bonita, CA",2,19,3,4.0,5/19/2015,I also go to BJ's for drinks and they have really good food!!! My go to restaurant it's never gets old to me. Prices are not bad and have a really good happy hour they make the best mojito's then any other place I have been to!
Diana S.,"San Diego, CA",2,9,,4.0,6/18/2014,"This location is very nice, I like that its open and not too noisy. The fireplace outside is my favorite spot. I love the Pizookies and pretty much everything on the Menu is delicious. The only thing is servers are too young and they do not seem to understand the value of customer service. If you have good customer service guest will continue to visit location. Great Area and as mentioned its hit and miss with the customer service."
Leyla K.,"San Diego, CA",89,17,4,1.0,12/30/2013,"We were disappointed with the service received. We ordered our drinks. They arrived AFTER our appetizer. Our food did not arrive until multiple requests to find the status. This was 42 minutes after we placed our order. And the food delivered was not what we ordered.  I informed them about my food allergy. Yet, my food had the spice. Drinks weren't refilled in a timely manner. No check back done.  The worst part is that we missed our movie :-( I informed the manager Luis of the situation and he did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT.  I hope that they put their act together.  As a customer, It appeared that the manager did not care. He also did not seem to be supportive of the staff."
Sarra L.,"San Diego, CA",193,67,2,5.0,11/18/2013,Amazing food and service. We went to the free charity dinner even though it was not open to the public until today. Kaitlyn was the best server I have had in a while. Food was perfect like I expected. We had a pre selected menu of mozzarella sticks and fried chicken with corn and mashed potatoes.  My meal was so good I will order it again. The pizza was great. The wait was like 20 mins even with our reservation which they offered to us. That's the only reason I almost gave 4 stars. They were not organized at all. People without reservations were walking in and they only had one little dude out front to keep track. He wasn't able to so anyone could have said they had an apt. Will be back tomorrow!
Rachel B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/21/2015,"The service was ok. The waitress was friendly enough but service and drink refills were define tell slow. Food was ok, there are def better places to spend the money. My husband really liked the beer he ordered, an Irish red. The biggest downfall was it was hot inside. The people in the booth next to us were fanning themselves when we came in, and that should have been a clue. It was so hot the ice in our drinks melted almost immediately."
Natalie S.,"Kensington, San Diego, CA",6,20,,3.0,4/11/2014,I love BJs food and drink. Honestly I do. However their service is seriously sub par. They have been around long enough that service and organization shouldn't be an issue. And when their employees aren't nice and look unhappy then that just adds to the overall lack of dining experience
BunnyLowk1904 ..,"San Diego, CA",0,27,,2.0,5/8/2014,"Some of the staff are really friendly.  Others seem lazy and like they dont even want to be there. They're really really slow to get orders out. Especially take out. I ordered a steak to go after my meal and nearly waited 45 Minutes. Mind you, it was not even close to busy. And when i brought it home to my husband it was burnt. Also, when I asked one of the servers to close the door because it was super windy, he seemed annoyed.. Like hello,  your job is to tend to the customers needs. Its not like I'm asking you to do a back flip. On top of that, he didn't even do it Right away, he started watching tv for ten minutes and then got up and asked a girl if he could close it. Wtf"
Robert F.,"Placentia, CA",1,4,,2.0,5/28/2014,I really can't recall an experience whereby a bartender can so completely ignore a patron. It seems like years but more likely it was 15 minutes between the time I sat down and the time the bartender acknowledged my presence. Who am I to deserve attention - I'm only some shlub traveling on an expense account clearly not the demographic they seek here. Oh well...
Nelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/2/2014,"I went to have lunch with my husband, the staff was umm alright. we sat outside on a nice sunny day, which was nice that they gave us the option where to sit. The food was great, till I found a hair on my food. didn't want eat the rest of my food, pretty gross! you have this nice looking plate and you dive in to eat, and you find a hair yuck!!! that's a big no no!!! and the waiter never come to see if we needed it anything, till we ask for our bill, till then I told them I had found a hair on my food. Didn't even afford to serve me another plate nor refund.."
food s.,"Escondido, CA",1,22,27,1.0,11/17/2013,"Great, just what we need in SD, another severely overpriced, appetizer portions for one, poorly managed, slow kitchen & wait staff chain brewhouse. No thank you. The location in Escondido is SO BAD that we gave up. But I am looking forward to the Cheesecake Factory. One can only hope."
Zaira M.,"Los Angeles, CA",377,78,95,5.0,10/5/2014,"Been here a few times already and never thought about writing a review, bcuz I never felt the need to, good or bad. But today, our waitress Gwen was SO amazing that I knew she deserved the recognition! My boyfriend and I have soaring and elevated expectations when it comes to our dining out experiences, especially when it comes to the service. Gwen displayed a serving experience that is rarely common these days. She hit every check mark of what makes an Excellent server. She introduced herself which was quickly  followed up by a recommendation of what we would probably like to drink, suggesting several different cocktails. She checked up on us frequently enough to fill up waters, answer questions, and anything we ordered she followed up with detailed questions to make sure nothing had to be customized.  I know this probably sounds typical to most, but I eat out probably 5 days a week due to a busy work life. So coming from experience, I felt she was the most authentic, knowledgeable, accurate and attentive server that I have engaged with in a long time. That means alot when I'm takimg the time to write a review just about her and recommend that if you do go to BJ'S, ask for Gwen!"
Allie S.,"San Diego, CA",1178,320,145,4.0,1/15/2014,"I like this new BJs! parking is a pain as usual in this spot, but it's very roomy and the finishes inside are very nice compared to other BJs. The food and service is typical of any other BJs =)"
Roger C.,"San Diego, CA",64,67,,2.0,4/5/2014,"We ordered an appetizer and some drinks, our main meals came out before the appetizer and when i asked where my drink was, I was told the bar had run out of glasses. Service was also slow. While the food was good I know I wont be returning here in a hurry"
Michele B.,"San Diego, CA",0,45,,2.0,7/7/2014,"Went Saturday, the place was understaffed and too hot, air conditioning not working ??? . Guess they decided to save money on a busy week end ??!! A lot of restaurants didnt make it in that location and if this continues this BJ location wont make it either..... Location Cursed ??!!!"
Jacque M.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,,5.0,11/19/2013,"So glad we finally have a BJ's in central San Diego! This location does NOT disappoint.  My husband and I ate here during the grand opening, and they have it together already! The food and service are great.  We had a yummy flatbread for an app, and shared the BBQ pork sandwich, and the mahi mahi and scallops holiday combo- delicious! The building is brand-spankin new and looks it. They have plenty of huge TVs for the sportsfans, and a really nice bar. Next time we hope to eat on the awesome patio with a gas firepit. This will definitely become one of our regular spots for eat-in and take-out."
Britney C.,"Fairfax, VA",345,33,6,3.0,1/15/2014,I've been to this location twice because my experience the first time was awesome. However my second visit was average...the waiter must have been new or in training because he barely knew the menu and never came by to check on our table. I love the food and drinks so I'll be back!
Mike G.,"El Cajon, CA",13,20,23,1.0,3/19/2014,Honestly I'm just not sure that the steak was edible. Hope you make the right choice before coming here
Walker D.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,2,4.0,3/18/2014,Awesome food. Good service. Great atmosphere.
Gerry E.,"San Diego, CA",4,35,1,4.0,6/22/2014,"A group of us ate here for lunch.  The prices for lunch special was really good, the food was good, but it was so noisy that we could not hear each other talk."
