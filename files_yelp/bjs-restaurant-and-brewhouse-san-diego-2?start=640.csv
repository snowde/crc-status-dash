Kathrina M.,"San Diego, CA",85,37,,3.0,11/16/2013,"Came for a soft opening dinner 11/16/13. The place is a big cube with no windows which is a little disappointing considering it's San Diego and it's always nice out.  We had a set menu which included potstickers for an appetizer and the choice of BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, Turkey Club Sandwich,  Balsamic Glaze Chicken, and BJs Favorite Pizza. We were happy to have good choices. The potstickers were cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce was savory.  The Balsamic Chicken dish was delicious and had an equal balance of chicken mashed potatoes and spinach with crispy onions. The deep dish pizza had a generous amount of toppings and was soft in the middle and nice and crunch crust on the edges. The salad on the other hand was pretty disappointing.  I'd rather pick one up at Trader Joes. It was basically a big bowlful of shredded iceberg lettuce and a couple black beans, corn kernels, and 6 cubes of chicken. Our table agreed it would be the only thing we wouldn't order again. The guys in our party pointed out that their beers did not have the proper head so they appeared flat even though they tasted fine.  Overall, the service was impressive for a soft opening and the food was great, aside from the salad. I'll be back for the regular menu for the grand opening."
Amanda Z.,"Coronado, San Diego, CA",9,76,20,3.0,11/11/2013,My husband and I went for lunch with a reservation for their trainings. It was a complimentary meal with donations to a charity. My husband loved their homemade root beer. The menu was limited but we both enjoyed our meals. He had mahi mahi and I had the flatbread pizza.
Chandra R.,"Spring Valley, CA",4,5,,1.0,9/16/2014,"First, let me say I love the restaurant, however this location sucks!!   This is not a review about the food.......because we never were given any.  DO NOT GO THERE BEFORE A HOME CHARGER GAME!! I went there past Sunday before the Charger v. Seahawk game. Right at 10 am when it opened.  I was seated immediately even though I came in with a crowd.  I ordered 2 bloody marys and a water.  By 10:25, the rest of my party (7) had arrived and only had my water (which needed a refill). At 10:30, I got up out of my seat to track down the server to ask if he could get the rest of my table some water and to check the status of my bloody marys.  By 10:45, no waters, bloody marys, or food! There was a large party across from us who although had their drink order still had not gotten any food......they walked out without paying.  We waited 10 more minutes and the manager finally came over at my request.  She said they were short staffed, she was helping out the bar, running around and that she was doing it all on a broken toe. She also added that they didn't expect such a large crowd.  Really??  On the FIRST home game of the NFL football season against the defending superbowl CHAMPIONS???? Really??!!  Her response to the current situation lacked professionalism and frankly, it was unbelievable. This is not a ""Mom and Pop"" restaurant, it's a chain! There is no excuse for the lack of preparation or poor service that was exhibited here. We walked out with about 20 other people who were in the same position and went to Smashburger.  This whole incident was embarrassing since there were so many out of town visitors that were there.......they must think our city is nuts! Thanks BJ's for ruining our pre-game brunch!! Thankfully, the Chargers win made it a great day in the end.  But, I wanted to share with others who may be planning anything at that particular location......know that it is not operated well."
Richard F.,"Indio, CA",4,9,6,4.0,2/24/2015,"Just came back from a great night! The deep dish pizzas were great and so was the french dip. That was probably the best meal I've had in a long time! Our server, Eric was great with the amount of work that he had on his plate and with taking care of us. Keep up with the great work, Eric! I'll be back soon and I hope you're serving me!"
Lilian C.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",0,4,,3.0,2/15/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here on Valentine's Day since it's close to home. We've been here a few times before, nothing terrible, nothing great, but we do enjoy the beers. Once we got to the front, the hostess let me know it would be a 20 minute wait (expected on such a busy day). Our waitress came to tend our table quickly, to which we ordered. I ordered a medium well steak, and my boyfriend ordered a jalapeño burger. Before our food came out, our waitress let us know she was going on break and that Rose would be taking over. When our food was brought out, I eagerly cut into my steak and found it to be Rare-medium rare....I let the waitress know and she was appalled that it was so bloody still. She quickly took my plate and got the manager. I wasn't upset because I know how hectic of a day it was, but the quickly brought out a steak cooked perfectly. I asked for a to go box to take my leftovers, and forgot it (along with my wallet) on the table. Rose ran after us into the parking lot to give me back my belongings which was very nice! The food is okay, the service is usually alright, but Rose really went above & beyond and was so sweet(which is why I added another star) ."
Angelica C.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",7,36,13,3.0,1/15/2014,"Tried this place this weekend. We had been meaning to try it as the restaurant that was there before (Maria Maria) disappeared before we got a chance to go. Anyway, it was a Friday night so it was packed. They told us it would be about a 20-25 minute wait. We were seated within 20 minutes. The server was very attentive, despite having all his tables full. He always made sure our cups were full.  I ordered an individual hand-tossed vegetarian pizza. It was okay, & I have definitely had better. They were very stingy with the bell peppers, but put too many black olives on it. Boo! Also, they need to add sweetened iced tea (not Brisk) to their beverage menu. I had high hopes for this BJs, and I can't give it anything higher than 3 stars right now.  I'll probably go again, but order something else. Their rewards program is pretty cool. Earn points for every dollar you spend to earn free menu items."
Jessica A.,"San Diego, CA",75,95,279,5.0,11/25/2013,"Great Lunch specials!!!! Fast Service and good food in convinient location. Super HAPPY that there is a new lunch spot !!!! By the way dinner ,manue is pretty fantastic as well.!!!!!!!"
Lila W.,"Tulalip, WA",42,48,,4.0,11/19/2013,"Loved it! The hubsters and I went for dinner last night and we were seated right as we got there. Every server we met was very polite and we never had to wait for drinks. We got just a plain deep dish pepperoni pizza in a combo with a wedge salad and clam chowder. The chowder was fabulous, according to the hubsters. We did have to wait a while for our pizza, but it was great!  We also a red velvet cookie with vanilla bean ice cream (they had some weird word for it.) and it was the best thing I've ever had in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. I could have died and gone to heaven right there. I did read somewhere that the wait staff was still in training, but there had to be a 3-1 ratio of servers to customers. It was packed with STAFF and it was a little upsetting that I couldn't even talk to my hubsters for more than a minute or two without someone interrupting us asking how our food was. Overall, pretty legit Get the red velvet cookie, you will NOT regret it."
Tiffany S.,"San Diego, CA",28,19,5,4.0,4/14/2014,"I will start off by saying that I LOVE LOVE LOVE their food- there are so many yummy things to choose from that I always have a hard time deciding.  However, a pazookie at the end of the meal is always a must.  I was so excited when I saw that they were opening up a location within walking distance to my house.  The building is beautiful on the outside but I was not as impressed with the inside.  They were going for young, bar scene as opposed to a family feel like their other restaraunts.  All in all I love this place."
Stefanie T.,"Big Bear Lake, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/1/2015,Service here is terrible. We Called to make reservations and when we got here they claimed they had no record of it. Managers were not friendly or accommodating.
Colin R.,"Downtown, San Diego, CA",417,109,14,2.0,11/15/2014,"Wow, I'm disappointed I have to write this review. BJ's food and beer is delicious, hence the two stars. Our service (Manuel was our server) was the worst I've experienced in at least 6 months to a year, and I dine out just about every day. We chose the self-seating on the outside patio and it didn't take long for our server to approach. We ordered waters and an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) and he left. It wasn't until we were half way done with our appetizer that he came back to take the remainder of our order. We ordered the mushrooms appetizer, the bacon corn fritters, and a small 11"" hand-tossed pepperoni extreme pizza. My beer came out about 7-10 minutes later, and our food came out another 5-7 minutes after that. Not horrible but not that quick. Our food was dropped off by a food runner, not our server, who we didn't see for another 15 minutes or so. After a few bites I realized I was given a 9"" deep dish, not the hand-tossed 11"". I asked a random server walking by and she confirmed I was given the deep dish and would get my server. When he came over I told him what had happened, and I said at this point I didn't want to wait for another pizza to be cooked so just charge me for what I ordered and I'll eat what was in front of me. He half-heartedly acknowledged the mistake and told me he'd check the menu for prices and let me know how he'd resolve the issue. Meanwhile we were thirsty as our waters weren't refilled once during this unnecessarily extended meal. When he came back he started reciting prices for ""shareable pizzas"" until I reminded him again that I ordered the 11"" hand-tossed, so to just charge me whatever that would have cost. Fast-forward 15-20 minutes and we're way past done eating and can't get his attention (he seems to be ignoring us at this point). I showed him a rewards coupon I had for a pizookie and ordered that and asked for the check as well. A food runner brought the pizookie and he eventually brought the check, then took another 5-7 minutes to pick it up. I still tipped 15% because I don't have it in me to tip less, knowing I'm taking from what the cooks, expos, bussers, etc. are getting from that, but I wish I could have tipped them directly. Left me regretting that restaurant decision. I had specifically gone to BJ's for the handtossed pizza. They also didn't clear a single plate (appetizers, side plates, etc. until we were leaving). The only defense I'll provide on our server's behalf was he appeared to have been seated several tables at once when we first sat down, but he did appear to receive backup in the form of 2-3 additional servers within 5 minutes of the mass seating."
Kim W.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,2,3.0,1/17/2014,"Eh, it was alright. Food came out in good time and it was bomb. But service kind of lacked, cheer up ya'll...you don't HAVE to be uptight just because you serve people who hit the FV area...honestly I'd go to the new Buffalo Wild Wings down the street, service, atmosphere, food, and BEERS are way better in my opinion!"
Nanthony N.,"San Diego, CA",80,157,58,2.0,6/2/2014,"This obviously isn't a five star dining establishment, so I can't complain about the food. I know what to expect and the food tastes the way it does at every other location.. lol, but I just HAD to say something about the crappy service here. After being seated at our table, we waited forever for someone to come by and take our order. The server in our section, Miss braided ponytail, ignored us and had a stupid smirk on her face after we repeatedly tried to get her attention. We finally got the attention of one of the bussers and he ran off to find someone for us. We continued to wait some more before they finally found a server for us. A server who had just clocked into her shift. I wish I had gotten her name because she was wonderful. Very friendly and attentive. She deserves five stars for sure! Yeah... But still... I can't get over the fact that we sat there for over 20 minutes without anyone checking in on us. They were just so freaking rude."
Jonathan M.,"Sedona, AZ",0,4,,3.0,3/15/2014,"Good food and atmosphere with friendly staff.  The only thing that wasn't great was food-appetizer timing, and having 3 different waiters in less than a one hour period.  Overall, I would recommend checking this place out."
Cyndi B.,"San Diego, CA",0,8,1,3.0,2/4/2015,"Arrived at 9 pm after class at nearby Art Institute of California Culinary School. Bad vibe from the start if you expect a restaurant. This is a bar that happens to serve food.  Ok. I can go with that. But a bar that can't make a Manhattan cocktail?  Fist it came on the rocks with minimum vermouth but plenty of ice. When we asked for it ""up"" it came back to us in a half full martini glass and it was warm. Never shook it. Do the bartenders know anything more than beer and vodka drinks?"
Adrienne M.,"San Diego, CA",133,72,,4.0,12/19/2013,"This is the third restaurant that's been at this location since I moved to Mission Valley 12 years ago. Perhaps the third time's the charm. I've been here twice for lunch and once for dinner, and haven't been disappointed. The eclectic menu has something for everyone. The deep dish pizza is one of my favorites (and I'm from Chicago); it's not as heavy as some of the traditional pies, but its crust is outstanding. I can see how people might not be thrilled at the parking situation, but since I live across the street, that's not an issue for me! Looking forward to going there for brunch soon."
Ket I.,"San Diego, CA",43,10,,4.0,11/25/2013,"Yelp led me to the wrong directions when trying to find this place! But we called our party who was already there! Service personnel was friendly and courteous! Our server Sarah was prompt and available with quick service, however her assistance could have used better training:I ordered my drink with Sarah and I received in 10 mins later, however out guests whom arrived well before us had ordered and yet to receive theirs! Thank you Sarah for your service! Food was delicious even better than the one in Grossmont Center!!! Ambiance was superb great decor, we sat next to an available television with the game on and it was perfect all around dining area! We were a party of about 20 and things were a tad bit unorganized when it came to billing and order taking....! Clam chowder was a bit salty but man were the clams plump and chunky not watery and stingy like most places in San Diego!"
Kenneth D.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,4.0,11/25/2013,"Long wait if you don't call in to rsvp. They only allow you to reserve 30 minutes in advance. Oh and if you don't come to check-in after 5 minutes they text you, your spot will be forfeited and you might have to wait again. I was seated at a table near the kitchen entrance and oh omg, so many workers bumped into my chair walking in and out. Their special brew beer selection was quite good. We tried a few appetizers and deep dish pizza, the pizza was not all that great. Made us full after just 1 slice. But I might come back and try other dishes since their menu is like a freaking book!!!"
John J.,"Dana Point, CA",0,59,,1.0,8/13/2014,"Terrible service.  First in this huge place there was no one to greet us and give us a table. Despite multiple employees sitting at tables taking and looking right at us. I almost left then but was hungry and in the mood for a beer. So after asking random busboys and whoever else was walking by we finally got a table.  Then we waited for a waiter.  And waited, and waited. Finally I once again had to ask an employee walking by.  So I order a beer for myself and water for my 13 year old daughter. Then we waited and waited and waited.  Finally someone other than our waitress brings the drinks right as I was on the verge of asking for a third time for service.  Wow. Our food arrived fairly quickly and wasn't bad but I will never go to one if these places again.  This is at 3 pm on Wednesday afternoon August 13th by the way and the place wasn't remotely busy.  I'm typing thus Yelp review still sitting in the resteraunt and I have never felt compelled to do that before. Avoid this place and in guessing other BJs are just as bad."
Allysha C.,"San Diego, CA",37,13,12,5.0,11/13/2013,"Amazing location, love the service, even though it was. Soft opening the service great our server Christy was amazing!! She was super helpful, and spunky! Defiantly coming back!"
