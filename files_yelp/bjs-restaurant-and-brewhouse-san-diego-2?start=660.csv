Jonathan R.,"San Diego, CA",2,38,9,4.0,2/18/2014,"Good first experience here. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about which counts as a win in my book. Ordered the Moroccan Salmon, it was delicious, accompanied that with their house IPA....in a city full of top notch craft breweries theirs did not stand up, not bad but not great. Sat at the bar and received great service. I will be back again."
Michael C.,"San Diego, CA",125,35,3,2.0,1/19/2015,"pizza has always been amazing, however everything else we tried tonight was mediocre. pork chops: dry, tasteless. shrimp scampi: completely tastless.  clam chowder: average, have had better from a can.  I would come back for the pizza but everything else needs improvement."
Alesia F.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/12/2014,This was the first time I've ever been to BJs and it was absolutely fantastic. I will definitely be going again.
Kevin K.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/26/2014,"I was initially excited that a BJ's opened up close to my house. My wife and I stopped in for happy hour and I immediately realized that I should have gone to lazy dog or Gordon birsch. It took over 10 mins just to get a drink and the after asking two waiters for happy hour menus I did not receive one. Eventually I just asked what the specials were and the waiters could not tell me the happy hour specials. After half an hour I did not receive a happy hour menu and I was told that ""basically the appetizers a  cheaper and beers were 4 bucks"".  We ordered two drinks and an ice cream for my daughter and the waiter forgot to put the ice cream order in. My wife and I decided not to order food and we headed over to lazy dog instead. Hopefully they hire more people or starts to train better because this place was not busy at all, I can't imagine how it would be on a crowded day. On the plus side this is the nicest BJs I have seen. Hopefully next time turns out better."
Gerald S.,"Coronado, CA",0,14,,5.0,12/1/2013,"Holy moly.... Excellent service, Excellent food quality, preparation, and hosting. I hope they keep up this type of service once they establish their opening."
McKenzie D.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/14/2014,"The service was awful! Our server, Nadia, forgot to put our order through so we were sitting at our table for over an hour waiting for our food. When it finally came out, my entree was not what I ordered. Nadia took it away and then about 20 minutes later my dish came out, COLD; as if it had been sitting for a while. The silverware was dirty, the table was sticky and the glasses weren't clean. Once we were done we waited for over 40 minutes just to get our check, then we had to wait another 20 minutes for Nadia to come take it. It was the worst experience I have ever had. I will NEVER go back!"
ari p.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,2,1.0,12/19/2013,"snotty men in black behind the bar. like monkeys humping a basketball NO customer service, they cant even operate the POS system or pour a beer. went on 1/16 kids at the front desk yucking it up but had NO clue just standing there looking stoopid. bad service bad people working thinking they are entitled. just over priced greasy spoon food feeding zombies."
Jayla Y.,"Sacramento, CA",71,19,,3.0,3/7/2014,I'm so disappointed! Been craving the steak salad and finally came in to find out they changed their menu and don't sell it anymore! Won't be coming to bjs so much anymore.
Tori F.,"San Diego, CA",10,25,8,3.0,7/17/2014,"Normally I would rate these guys at a 5 this time not so much.  Our server managed to bring us orange soda rather than cream soda. The wait for the food was not to bad, but my 11 year old had to wait over 10 min after the rest of us to get her personal pizza... we had to wait quite a while for the server when we finished.   When she finally came to check on its we asked for two kids pazzookies to go then say for another 20 for her to take the dinner plates another 15 to get the dessert which was supposed to be packed to go but were not all in all 3 stars for sucky slow service. now if had been busy I would've understood but it really wasn't. Oh did I mention the piece of paper that was stuck on my husbands pizza and the two servers that were obviously fighting over tables. got seated at 6 finally left at 8:30.   Hubby had to go find a server to get the bill. Normally one of my faves after tonight I am going to look for someplace else to go."
Romin I.,"San Diego, CA",18,65,19,3.0,3/6/2014,pizza quality and pizookie bombness has gone down in my last 2 visits...
Greg S.,"San Diego, CA",1,25,,2.0,6/13/2015,"Since moving to the college area a year ago (from Escondido), we've visited the Mission Valley location several times. When we first went to this location, the service was great, fast - a much needed breath of fresh air in comparison to the location in Escondido. But recently, we've noticed that Mission Valley has become progressively slower in service and has become what the Escondido location was the last time we went there. Today (6/12/15), which will probably be our last visit, we waited about 15 minutes before a waiter even came to our table. When we did and took our order, it was another 20 to 30 minutes before we got food. At the same time, two adjacent tables, where people arrived AFTER we did, got their food before us and were finishing up while we still waited for our food. I spoke to the manager about the decline in service. She explained that the service issue (on this day) stemmed from a ""transition"" and under estimating the number of people coming to see the women's soccer match. Not sure I buy that because this has been a trend observed during our last 3 to 4 visits when there was no special event. To the manager's credit, she ""comped"" our food order. Hope they get it together - we won't be back."
Bubba T.,"San Diego, CA",2,76,11,5.0,6/27/2014,"It's 8:53 at the Bar. Came here from Incahoots with my gf cuz they had no good beer. Dude behind the bar can work it really well!!! Speed and knowledge. Props to you buddy! Bjs is gonna lose a good server the day you go to work the industry downtown or a busy bar. I would come back just for the service alone. My chicks ""lemon drop"" even tasted super bomb! Extra tip for you bro! He didn't have a nametag but clean cut guy working the left side of the bar from the screen!"
Elain L.,"San Jose, CA",55,95,22,2.0,12/28/2013,"Born and raised in San Diego, but currently living in San Jose and I like my San Jose BJs MUCH better than this one. This one is new to the block and I can understand why they put it in Hazard Center... it definitely has a good flow of people from the plaza and Fashion Valley. HOWEVER my waiter was a straight up rookie. I asked for their adult alcoholic version of a root beer... I pointed to what I wanted. I named it as it was listed.... I got plain root beer. That's right you lost out on an alcohol sale. Then I mentioned that our party only wanted dessert... and he goes missing! EXCUSE ME... just because we're only doing dessert doesn't mean you don't have to pay attention to the table. Another waiter had to run our Pazooki order and he never came back... until it was time to drop the bill of course. I have no idea what he was doing because his section was empty. Like seriously couldn't have suggested coffee...or I know some alcohol? LIKE I ORDERED IN THE FIRST PLACE. LAME. I'm sorry I didn't catch his name because he was horrible, I guess it's a good thing I have a much better BJs in San Jose so I won't have to go back to that location for my Pazooki cravings."
Eric P.,"Escondido, CA",29,19,6,4.0,2/18/2014,"I often drop into BJs for happy hour which lasts until 7pm. I enjoy their personal pizzas (which are half price just $6) and a cold beer ( only $3.50) . I love their micro beers which they brew themselves. When ordering the pizza get the thin crust. It's larger and as a result you get a lot more toppings that way. I also like the fact that I can keep an eye on the game with their multi screen TV system while I eat. They are still more restaurant-brewery than sports bar but I find it a nice compromise between the two. They only put on the volume during a big game or the playoffs but at least you can enjoy the game while your eating. Dinner service is a little slower than happy hour or the bar and seems to be more hit or miss on the service. Over all I will give them 4 stars splitting the 5 stars for happy hour with the 3 stars for slower, spottier dinner service. The beer at happy hour for only $3.50 I would give 6 stars if I could."
Linda B.,"San Diego, CA",34,13,,1.0,12/20/2013,"I took my teenage daughter there for lunch today before going to a salon.  Our appt at the salon was at 2.  We got to BJ's at around 12:20.  We were seated very quickly, which was nice.  I ordered iced tea and they said they just put some on to brew.  The waitress came back with my daughter's drink and then said she had to greet another table and would be right back. We knew what we wanted to order before she left.  She greeted the other table and took orders from 2 other tables that were seated after us before coming back (I had to try and get her attention for that to happen).  It took 20 minutes for us to get our food and mine arrived cold.  When she asked how things were I told her mine was on the cold side and she said, 'do you want me to go back and see if they can do anything?'  I told her at that point we didn't have time to wait any more because of our appt.  She said okay and walked away.  Even my daughter noted that she wasn't a very good server.  She wasn't rude, just not very attentive and not very concerned that we had to wait such a long time for food or that it was cold.  There was also no consideration for the tardiness of the food or the fact that it was cold on our bill.  Due to time commitments, I didn't have time to ask for a manager.  At this point, I can only right a review and say they will not be getting my business again."
Sharon M.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/9/2014,"VERY disappointing... this restaurant's service is nonexistent.  I ordered a Santa Fe salad with blackened chicken and pink lemonade...received my lemonade in a somewhat timely manner; however, waiting 25 minutes for a salad and noticing that the place wasn't crowded to warrant this..well, let's just say I shall take my patronage elsewhere."
Michelle P.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,7,5.0,11/21/2013,"I wanted to try out this new Bj's location and I would have to say this is the best Bj's I've been too. I ordered the Crispy Potato Skins and Chicken Tortilla soup last night and they were both good. (I have ordered this before at other locations) I would recommend the soup bowls preferably in Calm Chowder. (I didn't even know they had bread bowls until I actually scanned the menu and it is literally the best bread bowls here) There Pizookies are okay, there too sweet but its worth trying. I don't recommend eating one by yourself lol I did that the first time I got it in Red Velvet. Also the service here is quick and they ALWAYS check up on you! I would definitely come back to this location and it looks fancy vs. all the other Bj's location I been too... PS. You guys should put your phone number on your YELP because we were trying to get your number off here to call for reservations last night. (We ended up not having to wait though.)"
Kellie P.,"San Diego, CA",76,3,,2.0,8/28/2014,"Great food, nice casual upscale atmosphere , but very bad service.  Came in for dinner last week and sat up in the bar area (should have sat at the bar bc the service seemed to be great)  at a high top.  The server on duty was the only one working on the floor it seemed, and was running around quite a few tables.  I ordered my wine through him and saw it sitting up in the window for over 10 minutes, after they were delivered he took even longer to take our order.  He was very busy with tables, or what seemed like he should have been considering the volume that came into the restaurant.  Instead, he was mingling with his buddy that was sitting at a nearby table.  I very much thought about complaining to a manager because I was so disappointed in my service  but I am also in the service industry so I held back giving him the benefit of the doubt that he had an off day maybe.  My 2 stars are for my delicious pizokie dessert and good food."
Rayna B.,"San Diego, CA",61,144,10,2.0,2/15/2014,"I love BJ's and I occasionally stop in when I'm craving a french-dip, so it was ironic that I had not yet made it into the new Mission Valley location, right by work. I was finally craving a french-dip last week and had time to go for lunch. I was seated quickly but had to wait about 15 minutes before someone acknowledged me at my table. I ordered promptly and waited another 15 minutes for my food. Ironically, I talked my self into getting a burger when I saw that they had a really cheap lunch special that sounded good. The burger was fine, except that it didn't have the grilled onions described in the menu. Since my hour long lunch was almost over by the time I got my lunch, I took a few bites before requesting a check and to-go box. Once someone came back with the bill, I handed them my card before they could get away again, since it might take another 10 minutes before they came by to collect my card. Anyway, I was overcharged for the burger because they didn't give me the lunch special. I told the hostess on the way out and she was unhelpful but apologetic. She told me she could try to get a manager if I want, which made me feel like I was making a big deal over a $2 charge. I think she should have insisted on getting it fixed, rather than making me feel like I was creating a problem, and frankly, I didn't have time and didn't want to feel stupid for making everyone deal with refunds over a $2 charge. They should have given me a coupon or something for a future visit, but really, they should just be sure to charge people correctly in the first place. Oh well. I may or may not go back, but this first experience left me kind of bummed and disappointed."
K M.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,2.0,2/5/2014,"I am  a B.J.'s Brewhouse fan. I have enjoyed each one I have visited, as well as the Food, service, etc. all great reviews.  Carmel Mtn Ranch and Grossmont locations have been great! As I live in Mission Valley, myself and friends were all very excited when we saw B.J.'s coming soon! So we watched diligently for them to open. Then the day had come! We saw tons of people going in, and thought, ""well let's go!"" So we did. We were not greeted kindly at all. We made it into the front door, and were approached by a man that said, ""do you have an invite?"" We said., ""No' aren't you open?"" He said., ""No this is our Test night and invite only"" I have no problem with that except for the man could have been much more professional with his demeanor. So we left not feeling welcome at all. About 2 weeks went by, and we decided we would give it another shot as we were craving our favorite foods from there. So we were greeted very nicely this time. The date was 12/16/13 5:11pm. We had a female server at first, unfortunately I didn't remember her name. I have many food allergies, so I always order about 3 of the same items each time bcuz I know I can eat them safely and they are delicious. So I ordered the chicken flatbread as I always do, told her I had allergies to onions, garlic. So please make sure that their is no sauce. My friend ordered the same and 2 sodas. Simple, right? Wrong, it took over 30 MINUTES to get a soda, we were sitting directly across from the bar, my receipt shows table 805. The patrons at the bar drinking and being loud was difficult to have a conversation at a dining table since they are right next to each other. As I went to get up and go find our waitress, she came out of a swinging door and I asked about our drinks. Sh apologized, got our sodas right away. So she obviously forgot about us. Another 40 minutes went by and our food came out, both covered in Garlic sauce. Are you kidding me! We waited all this time and then it was wrong! She apologized and took it back. A few min later we were approached by Gabrielle, he was now going to take care of us as the other waitress was on a break. He asked what I ordered and he would take care of it, I was stunned at his gesture. I said, "" I already gave her my order and it is suppose to be getting remade already so why do I need to reorder?"" He stated ""he was taking care of us now"" with no other explanation. We were about to get up and leave and then my friend said he needed to use the restroom. Well B.J.'s employees, YOU never know who your customers are. My friend is a ""Health Inspector"". He returned to the table and said, let's go, you are not going believe what I just saw."" He said, ""an employee was in the bathroom the same time he was, as he was washing his hands, the employee relieved himself and walked right by the sink and walked out of the bathroom and straight to kitchen!"" As we got up our food arrived and we said NO Thank you and as we were leaving We saw the manager. So we went to him and explained everything that happened, and also stated we were leaving with out paying our Bill. He was apologetic and agreed. Ya this place is literally 3 minutes to get to, and I will NOT Be a patron there ever again. Patrons BEWARE! Contaminated Food, Servers, and a complete lack of organization is the best description of this experience. I will stick with other locations even driving further."
