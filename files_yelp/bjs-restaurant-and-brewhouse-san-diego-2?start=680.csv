Lorna R.,"San Diego, CA",3,71,1,2.0,6/16/2014,"second trip here. came back because first trip was good. this time, a sad tale of ""no bread, no salad."" I mean I had the salad, which was the same I had the first time, but I asked for bread, thinking I would get a couple of little rolls with butter maybe, or maybe some pita bread...anyway, a plate soon arrived with two pieces of toast, no butter. the toast was well done, almost burnt. I said, ""sorry, not having toast with my salad."" it was sent back. another plate soon arrived, along with some butter because I asked for it, and on this plate was two pieces of stale sourdough bread. She said their policy did not include complimentary bread, so I was charged $2.25 for the stale bread. CAROL you could have gone to bat for me and talked to the manager and made an adjustment on the bill, but I guess you were too busy to do so. so sadly, my second experience turned out bad. win some, lose some. it's still a nice place but next time I think i'll try that crab shack place."
