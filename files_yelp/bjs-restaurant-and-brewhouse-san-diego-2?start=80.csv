Jan L.,"Leawood, KS",52,114,64,5.0,4/10/2017,"My dining experience was wonderful. After visiting the San Diego Zoo we stopped here to enjoy a meal before returning to Murrieta with our friends. My husband and I split the following meals; Seared Ahi Salad and the 16 oz Prime Rib with roasted Asparagus and potatoes. They nicely substituted a starch with Brussels Sprouts. The prime rib was rare as we like it, the roasted veggies amazing as so so tasty, the Ahi Salad delightful. However, the Prime Rib came with the Pizookie dessert. I don't eat desserts, but from the appreciated voices of me husband and friends...the Peanut Butter S'Mores Pizookie was a big hit!!! Very nice dining time, even for a Friday night when the place was hopping with customers."
Steven A.,"San Diego, CA",343,40,82,3.0,1/29/2017,"We love to enjoy the food and adult beverages at BJ's around the county. We were a bit disappointed in the lack of consistency in food dishes between the other locations and Mission Valley. The salad cane with way too much dressing drenched all over the leaves. The burger came out medium well not medium rare and it had the onions, tomatoes and pickles on the burger even though requested with out. The pizooki was as delectable as ever. Absolutely LOVE  THE SALTED CARMEL!!!"
Kaimi Y.,"San Diego, CA",244,22,12,4.0,9/17/2017,"Great place to watch games. Loud, but fun environment. Service was a little slow in the bar area, but expected for such a large busy spot."
Gabbi W.,"Oceanside, CA",127,140,352,3.0,4/4/2016,"The 3 star review is because of their pizookies. Pizookies are really the only thing that keep me coming to BJs. They are heavenly and magically delicious. I will keep coming back for pizookies, but I think I've given up on the food. And beer. Beer and cookies- can't beat that, right? I'm never excited or impressed by the food; it's pretty mediocre. The flatbreads and pizzas are the best entrees in my opinion. The drinks are WAY too sugary and never taste like they have any alcohol in them. I tried their new watermelon margarita this time hoping it would be different, but still really sweet.  Service at this location was pretty good. Our server doesn't have that many shifts so he apologized a couple times about things, but he was friendly and had a good attitude, so we didn't mind. Other BJs locations I've been to have horrendous service; service is crazy slow and servers aren't usually that friendly or on top of it."
Angelina M.,"Lemon Grove, CA",69,23,,3.0,9/7/2017,My roasted portobello mushrooms and asparagus salad was delicious.  I always like the pizooke.  It's very good with reasonable price.  I ordered pick up and the only thing was my pizza was a little on the cold side.  It wasn't like I was late because I was still waiting on my salad.  Hopefully next time I will get hot food.
Tommy T.,"El Cajon, San Diego, CA",6,3,,1.0,10/21/2017,By far the worse services I have ever received from BJ's. I went to BJ's last Friday evening for Happy Hour with about 8 friends from work.  We sat down in the bar area and waited about 15 mins before a waiter came to take our order.   It took another 10 mins for us to receive our order.   As we were finishing our drinks we started looking for our waiter.  Could not find him.  I spoke to the bartender and he said he just went on break for 30 mins.  I asked if he could send someone over to take our order. 10 mins later another waiter showed up to tell us our waiter is on break and he would be back to take our order.  He showed up about 10 mins later.  So 20 mins later we finally place an order for drinks and food.  10 mins after that we got someone else order of food.  When we finally got our order of food and drinks everyone was so frustrated on the long wait we barely finished our drinks and food.  The bar was not busy at all.  About 7 or 8 tables with people sitting waiting and walking out because of the wait.       They screws up our Check which took additional time to fix.  The entire time we spent at BJ's was a wreck.
Kari L.,"San Diego, CA",116,21,23,2.0,4/23/2017,"And the only reason why I give this place 2 stars instead of 1 is the nice server. We waited 30 mins for our brisket burger and steak to come. How long does it takes to cook steak and burger???? And the restaurant where barely filled... So food finally came and it looks nothing like the pictures in the menu. My brisket burger tasted like two different burgers. The bland ham burger patty has no bussiness to be between those buns! All it does is taking up space of the barely there brisket... my husband's steak was ok but all it was on his plate where a piece of steak, a scope of mashed potatoe and a few asparagus.... I could have done a better job at plating,  and I don't even cook!!!  The cook really drop the ball! So underwhelming."
May-Lanie M.,"San Diego, CA",8,31,4,2.0,2/25/2017,"On 2/23/17, my co-workers and I went here for a bridal celebration and painting. Our waitress was Lauren and she was awesome!!  I would give Lauren 5 stars for such an attentive, friendly and all around great customer service. Unfortunately, the experience went soar when an employee who just finished her shift decide to steal the Bride-to-Be's( Sarah) sash.  Sarah had dropped the sash and and my other co-worker saw another person wearing it. Well this other person is Gabriela (or Gabrielle), who is an employee of BJ's.  She and another employee were sitting at the bar drinking and laughing like it was funny to steal a customer's belonging. Though she was off, she is still a representative of the restaurant. We requested for the manager, Kody, but he was useless!!  He did not reprimand the thief and allowed her to stay at the bar area without any repercussion. What manager will allow this is unbeknownst to me!! Apparently, stealing and staying at the scene without any consequence is absolutely ok for this facility. Kody's management style is a freakin' joke!!   After the bridal celebration, most of our party of 13 left already and three of us went to the bar. Sara was our bartender and she was awesome too. She said it was the talk of the employee about Gabriela and Sara apologized for her. We thank her and told her it was a nice gesture but Gabriela should be the one apologizing.   I gave this BJ 2 stars: 1 for Lauren and 1 for Sara. If it wasn't for them, I would have given this place a negative five.  The sash was something petty but it was still stolen. Gabriela never apologized or gave a lame excuse for her action. I would not recommend anyone to go here if this girl remains employed at this BJ's or any restaurant or retail industries. Gabriela is a thief and I would not trust a restaurant that allows this. You have been warn!"
Padres F.,"San Diego, CA",0,26,,5.0,5/19/2017,This is a great addition to the area. The service has always been very good and the food is good as well.  The Happy Hour and offerings in the bar area are great for after work or during a game. The open air vibe makes this place really appealing as most people dont want to to sit in a dark restaurant this close to the beach during the summer.
Jordi E.,"Calexico, CA",7,11,34,4.0,4/14/2017,"Hanging out on a Friday night with my kids, just ordered the mahi tacos although thay had a very tempting weekend prime rib meal deal. Great food and good brews"
Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Yuck, not a great experience. The food was mediocre and overpriced. Disappointing since I could have gone to the Cheesecake Factory for what I paid and had a better meal. Strike 1: The Bloody Mary was bland and the server said they couldn't make it any spicier. Strike 2: The BBQ chicken salad came with almost no dressing on it, and was mostly a huge bowl of lettuce with really salty chicken and skimpy on the other ingredients. It was also missing the green onions, which might have saved it. Definitely didn't look like the picture on the menu.  Tortilla soup was just okay, also salty with two little pieces of avocado thrown in.  Strike 3: Service was really slow and we had to wait 10+ minutes for a kids pizookie after I already paid the check. The server did apologize, but she should have taken the dessert off the check. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing, but prob not coming back. I'll stick to my other favorite restaurants in the area."
Deborah S.,"San Diego, CA",401,178,707,4.0,11/23/2015,"We returned to BJ's yesterday after the Veteran's Day debacle and it was a very different experience. We were seated immediately and our waiter acknowledged us within minutes of being seated. We placed our order of parmesan wings, root beer rib, and mini pepperoni pizzas. I must say everything was delicious.  Parmesan wings - perfectly cooked, crispy yet still juicy with just enough sauce Root beer ribs - moist, tender, tangy and sweet all at the same time Pizza - had a perfect char on the top, large pepperonis and parts of the cheese was crispy. In the middle of the meal the GM came out to apologize for our last encounter and to thank my husband for his service as well as our return to BJ's. It was a great meal with good food, excellent customer service and football."
Tori O.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",10,9,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"The customer service at this location is awful, the one in La Mesa is WAY better. My mom and I didn't even make it to a table before we walked out it was so bad. Their website says you can call in to put your name on the list, so I called while sitting in the parking lot because it was crazy packed and if the wait was super long we didn't want to wait. Well the lady on the phone said it was only going to be ten minutes for us two and I asked to make sure I could put my name down on the list over the phone. She said yes and that she put us on the list so we walked into the restaurant and sat down to wait. Twenty minutes later we asked her how much longer it would be and turns out she never put us on the list! And then she blamed us for not telling her we were there when we'd literally told her we were walking in over the phone. My mom was so upset with how rude she was we immediately left. Which turned out to be a blessing because we went to Lazy Dog and they're amazing all around! So for future reference if you want BJ's drive to La Mesa, that location has a much better staff, I've never had a bad experience there and I've been going there my whole life."
Amanda R.,"San Diego, CA",359,279,1116,4.0,12/6/2015,"Last time we came here we had a really interesting experience and I filled out the survey I got in my email. The manager replied to my survey and invited us back with a gift card.  We love BJ's so it's not like he had to twist our arms. The experience in the prior visit was not enough to keep us away but was enough to make me not leave a review since I knew it wasn't their norm but wanted to let someone, not everyone know what we experienced. We really appreciated that the the manager took the time to reply and apologize. So this visit, we decided to get something different that our usual and we got a Mediterranean pizza, lemon pepper dry rub wings and side salads. Everything was delicious! The service was great and the atmosphere was rowdy and fun due to the SDSU game."
Mike D.,"San Diego, CA",352,15,7,1.0,12/7/2016,"My friend and I split our check.  Our waitress came back and said his card couldn't be used because it's a debit card.  She came back later and said the same thing about mine.  Not since the early 2000s have I heard of not accepting debit cards. After we questioned this, she half admitted that they didn't feel like installing the ""keyboard"" for the card machine, which would have made it work.  LAZY and ridiculous. The avocado spring rolls are delicious, though."
Amr B.,"El Cajon, CA",2,5,,1.0,5/14/2017,"It's just as simple as this place is awful, from the staff through the food. I ordered a $25 well done steak and waited for 30 mins to get literally a burned steak."
Calvin N. H.,"San Diego, CA",721,300,1910,3.0,10/15/2015,"I've been to various BJ's on many occasions. I've frequented this particular location a handful of times. Parking can be a pain depending on when you go. During peak hours on weekends, expect a long wait. There's a Barnes and Noble nearby to kill time if the wait is excessively long. One person will likely have to take one for the team and wait at BJ's in case your table is ready. This location is pretty spacious with indoor and outdoor dining options. They have big screen televisions so you can catch sports action. Food is generally pretty good. I'd rate it 4/5. I've tried pasta, entrees, burgers, pizzas, salads, appetizers, and dessert. Service can be hit or miss... pretty inconsistent. I've had anywhere from 2-4 stars out of 5 in service. I've noticed larger parties get better overall service. This makes sense because their ticket will come out to a larger dollar amount (versus a table for 2-3) and this correlates to the tip. For this reason, there have been times water and drinks haven't been refilled, it's taken forever to get boxes, utensils, the bill and so on. But I look over at the bigger table and the server is all up on that table like Barney Stinson on a hot blonde. I get it, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. There are plenty of places I've frequented where customer service is much more consistent and I don't see favoritism because of group size. Atmosphere is okay, pretty standard. This place is clean, spacious, and has plenty of televisions. I'd score it a 3 out of 5. My last few visits, service hasn't been good. As a result, I can only rate this place a 3... food is the only reason this score isn't lower. I'll return (if friends or family are in the mood), but I won't be expecting great service."
Sonny G.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,2.0,9/28/2017,"Very bad service. No help . Ask for water we didn't get it. Asked for an appetizer, it came with the meal. Needed another beer since it was Wednesday and no love. Had to go to the bar to get it. Wife's order was inaccurate, it came with the white sauce we asked not to be included.  Cool spot for games and to take a date. Not family friendly at around 5 pm on a week night. Two stars because they comped the appetizer."
Diego G.,"San Diego, CA",124,3,,3.0,11/12/2017,"Service is kind of bad. We waited for an hour just to get a drink, and then even longer for the food. Its cool if they are understaffed, but at least let us know. It seems the waiters only care about their own tables :("
Amanda N.,"San Diego, CA",570,241,68,2.0,5/23/2016,"I probably wouldn't keep coming back here if it wasn't for the pizookie. I've come here twice in the last few weeks and did not have a good experience either time.  The first time I came was around 10pm on a Sunday night. My friend and I decided to sit in the bar area to take advantage of the late night happy hour specials. The server took awhile to bring menus and when she did she plopped them in front of us and walked away, no greeting, smile, or anything. When she FINALLY came back to take our order we had some questions as it wasn't clear what the happy hour specials were. Her response ""look somewhere in that smaller menu they are in there somewhere"" and walked away. We finally placed our orders. We both ordered pizza. It took 45 minutes for us to get our food, and the place was not busy. Once the pizza was delivered no one ever came back to check on us. We had to flag servers down to ask for the box and check. The pizza was good, but the service was horrible. I decided to give this place a try again since I remember BJ's being better than that. Second time around I came on a Sunday afternoon. Decided to sit at the bar area again to watch the bball game. This time the service was ok, but the food was terrible! I ordered a steak cooked to medium. When the steak arrived it was burnt crisp and was so rubbery I could barely cut it open. I said something to the server so he said he would have another steak brought out. The next one that came out was cooked medium well to well done. I decided at this point to just suck it up and eat it. The meal was comped but I would have much rather paid and eaten a decent tasting meal than get a horrible meal for free. If I do come back it will be for pizookie only!"
