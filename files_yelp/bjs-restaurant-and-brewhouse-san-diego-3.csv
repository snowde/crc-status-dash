Christine K.,"San Diego, CA",1382,942,1673,4.0,12/29/2017,"BJ's is a decent restaurant for food but it's mainly known for their Pizookies. I didn't know that they actually switched locations but I went with my family. All BJ's restaurants look the same. Staff is nice. So we ordered 2 large pizzas, Pepperoni and the Great White for 4 adults, one kid and an infant. The pepperoni came with a lot of meat. I personally liked the Great White much better. The creamy alfredo sauce had the right anount of sauce to pizza ratio and the roasted garlic really brought out the flavors. We also got a kids - chicken alfredo pasta which was pretty big for a average kid and good. Get the pizookie trio. You can opt with 3 different flavors. I went with chocolate chip, white chocolate macadamia nut and cookies and cream. All delicious!"
Marcela G.,"San Diego, CA",20,25,,1.0,1/8/2018,"worse service ever, this past Saturday at 1pm i went in for lunch, i got seated but no one came to offer me a drink or take my order nor even to greet me, after 7 minutes of waiting who I think was the manager(bald guy  not wearing the black attire) asked me if everything was ok. after i explained what had happened, he apologized, took my order and left, never came back to check if my service had gotten better, a girl brought my salad and that was all the interaction i had with the staff, never knowing who my  server was! i had to leave my table to get the bill which had a mistake and i was over charged. normally the service is great but not this time. horrible, horrible service, very disappointing."
Crystal N.,"San Jose, CA",867,155,431,3.0,11/30/2017,"Mondays are half off pizzas! Their pizzas are pretty decent and you can split two flavors on one pizza. 2 large pizzas was more than enough for 5 girls. Happy hour is also nice because some appetizers are $6 and drinks also have deals. I have to say the food is pretty decent but it's the service that ruined it for me. It took the waiter forever to get us even just water and to take our order. We were outside in the patio so there may be a lack of waiters or people are just not attentive. Everyone is walking so fast it's hard to wave someone down and when you do, they forget about what you ask for and the process happens all over again. The food also took ridiculously long to get out to us- at least 30+ minutes for appetizers! It shouldn't be that hard to make artichoke dip!!! We all just getting hangrier out here. :( Overall all, food is good, but the whole experience just took way too long! And backless stools aren't fun to wait on outside. Not a place worth going to unless you want to wait for expensive food (unless there's a deal or coupon)."
Sari K.,"LADERA RANCH, CA",481,168,592,3.0,11/8/2017,"Pretty good  California supreme deep dish pizza: alright, nothing fantastic. If probably like another kind.  Cookies and cream & salted caramel split pizookie: the c&c section was amazing and had the perfect amount of sweetness. The salted caramel is sickeningly sweet and wasn't good at all. Unfortunately, my pizookie had more salted caramel than cookies and cream. :'( Frozen margarita w sugar: yum yum"
Pratap C.,"San Diego, CA",373,74,246,3.0,8/23/2017,"Another disappointing visit to this branch leaves me baffled as to why certain establishments can't maintain the standard and quality across different locations. This disparity comes to the fore when the difference is in both table management and the quality of food. When a couple of kids are part of a party of four, one would think that managing locating them at a table, getting their orders and serving them their order must be a breeze but these guys surprisingly fell short. Firstly, having a server come by and give a glass of water, much less take an order in a moderately occupied restaurant, should not take 15 minutes.... but it did. Next, if the waitress has an opinion on the order, it should not turn into a tirade against items on their own menu. I've faced this situation in other places and I attribute this to overzealous yet well intentioned behaviors.  But then, when we decide to share dishes or drinks, they suggest giving you free stuff saying that if we decide to share they might as well throw in some free drinks. This reaction might cross a fine line between good service and weird service. Now coming  to the food served on the table, the corn dogs orders were generic enough but flavorful so the kids enjoyed it. The veggies that accompanied them were however not fresh or clean... the celery sticks were not cleaned well enough and the kids complained and we verified the presence of sand... not something we would associate with a good BJ's outlet. The quinoa bowl was average and I would not recommend it as opposed to other items on the menu. The quinoa and rice were under-cooked. The quantity of greens and tomatoes in the dish was way too much and the only saving grace was the perfectly seasoned and cooked salmon it came with. Thankfully, the black and bleu-house burger that we ordered was very good. This is one dish that BJs delivers on consistently and we are happy about that fact. The roasted garlic aioli is such an awesome addition to this burger and it goes very well with the applewood smoked bacon in the bun. Hopefully, as this establishment gets more feedback and gains more experience, the service and the food will improve and match up to what we have come to expect from BJs at other locations."
Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,4.0,10/30/2017,"BJ's caught my attention this month with their $3 pizookie offer. I mean, how can you pass up a delicious deal like that? Since I knew that I would be indulging in dessert, I decided to order a mini pizza and only eat half to save room for the pizookie. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch without the bacon and onions. Basically, I just wanted chicken and tomatoes. My only complaint is that it could use more ranch but otherwise the pizza is nice and gooey. Deep dish pizzas are one of my favorites and this one is pretty good! As for the pizookie, I took advantage of the fact that you can get a half and half and tried both the cookies and cream and the regular chocolate chip. Both cookies were delicious and I especially loved the squirt of cookies and cream mousse on top of that cookie. I wouldn't make this a regular meal because the calorie count has to be through the roof but it's a delicious treat every once in a while!"
Samantha K.,"Cypress, CA",6,12,1,5.0,1/5/2018,"Came in and sat in the cocktail area. Our server tonight was Benjamin, and he was amazing. Kind, courteous and on top of everything. I always enjoy the food and drinks here but tonight our service was over the top. A great way to start our weekend."
Ed S.,"San Diego, CA",1,38,1,5.0,1/4/2018,"Great beer and spirits selection, AND the food rocks, e.g. Dbl cut pork chop, lentils & cauliflower, ribs, salads, Apps, etc."
Kimberly T.,"San Francisco, CA",424,67,79,4.0,10/17/2017,"Went to BJs because my friend just came back from her vacation and we wanted to catch up while getting $3 pizookies! We shared the chocolate chunk which was yummy and got an order of fries and their BJs brew house classic pizza. The fries were nice and crisp which I liked a lot, but the pizza was a bit disappointing since I didn't realize the bread would be super thin. It was still pretty good but price wise (about 16$), it's not really worth unless you just plan splitting with a bunch of people and/or don't mind paying for it (think of this as a $16 appetizer for a big group rather than a satisfying meal for 1-2). Atmosphere is great. It's a great spot Togo with a group or just catch up with friends. Service was good for us. Our waiter was super friendly and kept coming back to us and checking on us at good times, which I appreciated.  But ya, def go for $3 pizookies! Worth :-)"
Faye L.,"San Diego, CA",514,1202,8732,4.0,6/6/2017,"Friends have been wanting to try out BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse so we finally had a chance to visit (twice) in the last week. BJ's Restaurant is located in La Jolla Village. The brand new building was built from ground up. They took over the previous location that housed TGIF (does anyone else remember eating there when they were younger). I actually visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse a few months ago and sat at the bar. I thought the food was mediocre and found the restaurant to be cramped. Fortunately, the last two visits have been better. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse offers lunch specials Mon-Fri so I took advantage of that on our first visit. They have an unlimited salad and soup combo for only $8.95. Ashley, our server, was the funniest girl. She was incredibly helpful and kind. We ordered: UNLIMITED SOUP & SALAD: - I tried the clam chowder, chili, chicken tortilla, and broccoli cheddar. One word to describe all soups : LUKEWARM. All these soups would have benefited from being served hot.  - mozzarella & tomato salad: AMAZING. Straight up fresh and yummy. The small spheres of cheese were plentiful. The parm cheese and fresh parsley brightened this side salad to another degree. I am in love with this dish. ROOT BEER GLAZED RIBS: - BJ's Restaurant currently has a promotion. Spend $9.95 on any entree and you get a free appetizer on the house. Friend's entree was over $9.95 so we opted for the root beer glazed ribs. The ribs weren't very meaty and tasted dry. The sauce wasn't too sweet but it also didn't taste much of root beer. ENLIGHTENED MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN PITA TACOS: - I was surprised when the tacos came out served on toasted pita bread. I immensely enjoyed the flavors of these Mediterranean inspired tacos. The bite size pieces of chicken were tender. The red wine vinaigrette tasted tart and refreshing. The feta cheese paired well well the tomatoes and red onions. The pita bread was perfectly toasted and was warm & soft. The chicken was a bit scarce though. CHOCOLATE CHUNK PIZOOKIE: - download their mobile app and get this pizookie for FREE!! The chocolate chip cookie was baked fresh to order. It was thin, crispy, yet creamy with the molten chocolate chips. I liked the thinner cookie.  ...2nd visit... AVOCADO EGG ROLLS: - I was hoping the avocado egg rolls would rival the version I adore at Cheesecake Factory. It didn't. I was worried the cream cheese would be off putting but you could only taste a bit of it. The egg roll wrapper was nicely crispy. There was a decent amount of avocado but that was about it. NEW ORLEANS JAMBALAYA: - friend requested pasta instead of rice pilaf for his jambalaya. It was hearty dish. ENLIGHTENED MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN PITA TACOS: - I ordered the same pita tacos as friend from the last visit. BUT, our nice server let me sub out the bistro grains for, yes, you guessed it - the mozzarella and tomato salad. Still so wonderfully amazing. Please don't ever get rid of it. You get two pita tacos with the order so it's not a big portion. I wish they could add more chicken but it's satisfactory for the $10.75 price tag. My blog has more detailed review and pics Service was fine second visit. But Ashley, from our first visit, was fab.  Don't forget to have your receipt added to your app in order to earn points. I forgot both visits so had to input the information myself (good thing mom always taught me to save receipts). The menu here at BJ's Restaurant is huge so I would come back to try out more items (or lunch specials). I hope they continue to offer the mozzarella and tomato salad as it appears to be new. Overall, aside from lukewarm soups, the visits here have been good."
Seetha G.,"San Diego, CA",145,179,738,5.0,6/2/2017,"Update 5/24/17:  Since the last review we have become regular customers at this location and have been impressed with the consistently great quality of food and service.  We recently did an appetizer combo -  Sriracha dry rub bone-in wings: 5 stars, fantastic rub Root beer glazed pork ribs: 5 stars once again..juicy tender ribs with a nice sticky glaze w/ an amazing flavor.... equally impressive portion of this dish was the side of sriracha slaw- it packs quite the punch! California club flatbread - 3 stars. Was rather simple but the toppings were not well distributed on the slices ... some portions / slices have generous toppings while others are mainly just plain flatbread ... The kids menu as always is a hit with the littles"
Arlene P.,"San Diego, CA",2108,1086,4222,3.0,2/17/2017,"Had to try the new and enlarged BJs in La Jolla--- they built it over the spot where TGIFridays used to be and just across the parking lot from their old location. I just wanted a place to do work on my computer on a Saturday night and they were happy to have me in their bar.  So that was very nice. I ordered a taster of beer - 2 ounces I think - and a pizzookie.  It took eons for my pizzookie so i finally asked - 30 minutes later-  and I suppose they forgot me! haha oh at least they were nice enough to take it off of my bill.  Unfortunately the pizzookie (PIZZA COOKIE) was still kind of raw when it came and just not like how I remember they used to be... but I was already tired and didn't want to take the time to make them remake it and have to wait around, so I just ate it partially and then left. Good news is, I saved myself some calories! To be fair, it was a BUSY night!  But the servers and hostesses were nice enough. I think I'll consider giving it another try one day. We'll see."
Amy P.,"San Diego, CA",152,9,30,5.0,7/30/2017,"This place never disappoints! Soo yummy...and healthier meals as well for those looking for some healthy options! The soba noodle dish with the chicken, was so delicious! Made with buckwheat noodles 2nd time getting it! Only got a pic of my leftovers because it was too good to stop eating it lol Great staff! Our waiter Jonathan P. was great and so is their GM, Rodney! Our mushroom appetizer was on the house and we used their great coupons/loyalty program too! Thanks! Belly full lol"
Ryan E.,"San Diego, CA",42,267,53,4.0,8/14/2017,"Just like every BJ's, cut down on the technology and get back to good ol service. I don't want to order my food on an app or figure out how to pay on my phone. Just come take my order and take my money when I'm done.  The food is always good and their deals have been great. I usually order some wings and a burger and am pretty happy at the end of the night. This location is great too, pretty central to everything."
Steve H.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",20,86,89,4.0,2/26/2017,"We come here often for family dinner, and the same for the previous location (now Nordstrom Rack, when they took over the TGI Friday's spot).  The reviews here are accurate, and you probably know what the food is about. I mostly want to warn people away from their BJ's App.  The Android app for loyalty-club and such.  It claims to ""put you on the waitlist' when it does nothing of the sort! The hostess (any of them) at this BJ's has never heard of the app, and apparently never sees the ""waitlist"" that the app uses.  So, you'll be waiting there on the bench for a really long time, even though the app confidently ""confirms"" that you're waiting to be seated. You have to sign in at the front desk to get on the waitlist.  The whole app is buggy anyway, so you're not missing anything.  After trying it three times, it was time to send it to the big Uninstall bin in the sky. On the rest of it, I do appreciate the menu printing calorie counts without secrecy for Every dish.  Some are surprising, in both directions.  The beers are excellent, always.. very predictable/repeatable, so if you find something you like, it won't change on you."
Robert H.,"Quincy, MA",90,678,959,3.0,2/16/2017,"BBQ pizza good, drafts good, French Dipper good.     The were out of Porter and Stout both, most regrettable.     Big place, not cramped, big windows."
Triple T.,"Chula Vista, CA",12,46,42,1.0,10/18/2017,"Bad bad ... worst location in one of the best areas in SD ? How can this happen? I had Black and rotten avocados in my deep fried avocado rolls chips were cold and stale. Service was poor and just completely disconnected and unfriendly staff. Hard to believe there was even any one managing this place. Will never go back,  worst BJS ever!! will file complaint with corporate  as well as health department."
X D.,"San Diego, CA",35,299,1247,4.0,10/26/2017,First time eating int at this BJ's. I love how their menu has such a variety. JP was a great waiter.
Emma W.,"San Diego, CA",157,39,32,4.0,11/11/2017,"Came to BJs before closing on a Thursday night. I was craving nachos, but couldn't find any nachos on the menu, but there was a flatbread nacho on the menu. I asked our waiter if they still had nachos on the menu, and he said that they had just took it off the menu but he could still have the cooks make them for me. They brought out the nachos quickly and it tasted good. The portion was huge for only $10 and could easily feed 4+ people. My friend got a pizookie and it was also huge and she enjoyed it. Definitely would come back for a late night snack!"
Vanessa B.,"Las Vegas, NV",6,22,29,4.0,10/28/2017,"Great place to get something to eat and drink especially with a family. Brought our baby (14 months old) and they had the cutest little high chair. Food was good, a little slower than what we anticipated, maybe because they are busy??  Ordered: Kids - grilled chicken, mashed potatoes & steam veggies (broccoli & carrots) - pretty large portion for kids definitely had leftovers & came with choice of beverage  Sirloin steak & 2 sides: wedge salad & asparagus. Sent back the wedge because the greens were spotted brown so we ordered the sriracha Brussels sprouts (so delicious) which they ended up comping out of kindness. Sirloins was cooked to perfect MR and everything else was perfect.  Barbacoa chicken with black beans, feta cheese, brown rice, kinda spicy but super moist chicken breast and pretty healthy.  The manager apologized for the salad and took care of our pizookie in which we ordered the white chocolatier macadamia nut pizookie which was more than plenty.  Pretty happy with the service and flavor of the food. Only downside was that things took too long. Great spot for a good meal and if you like to watch sports, lots of TVs."
Luis A.,"San Diego, CA",152,1,2,5.0,11/10/2017,Here for Veterans Day. 12.95 discount. Ultra surprised by how the service was exemplar. Thank you Jeremy. Made a simple lunch feel like a 5 diamond resort service. Will definitely be back.
Ken L.,"Northern California, CA",229,138,2124,5.0,6/22/2017,"This my ""to go"" place to satisfy my pizza cravings in La Jolla. The entrees are always awesome and my server, Adrian, was very attentive to make sure we are happy with everything."
Alexus A.,"Escondido, CA",78,3,,1.0,12/5/2017,We ordered food online and the food never even got picked up from BJ's by the delivery service. I was charged $10 for the delivery service fee and would like my money back because we ended up just picking up the food ourselves 45 mins passed the estimated delivery time. The ice cream was melted and the food was cold. BJ's just let us take the food home cold!! But replaced the ice cream. Worst delivery experience ever!! I want my money back!!
Magz K.,"San Diego, CA",231,598,2477,5.0,11/27/2016,"Went driving around trying to figure out what to eat and came across the newly open BJ's location. Got super excited to try this one out now and it wasn't a mistake!  The waiter was super nice and was very attentive. The food actually came out pretty fast and was amazingly good. Ended up ordering a lot of food and only ended up taking a small amount of food home. Ended up ordering Avocado Egg Rolls (in love with this one!), Root Beer Ribs (very tasty and had an amazing flavor to it as well as a sticky sauce on it), Calamari, Cesar Salad with Grilled Chicken, BJ's Favorite Pizza, Seared Mahi Salad (would suggest getting the wasabi on the side, we would end up getting random wasabi bites in the salad), Spicey Peanut Chicken Soba Noodles, and the Trio Pizookie (got the double chocolate chip, salted Carmel chocolate, and the monkey bread - - all three were amazing but we especially loved the double chocolate chip one)."
Erica B.,"San Diego, CA",299,193,500,5.0,5/20/2017,"LOVE the new location. It moved down the street and this is SO much better.  The indoor that can transition to an outdoor feel is my favorite part of the new design. The large garage type doors slide up and down to accommodate for wind. The wrap around bar 1/2 in and 1/2 on the outdoor patio is great.  I love to sit outside by the bar, the large tables and the intimate seating around the fire tables.  All of the food is great--  the spinach and artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls, ribs, queso dip and chips, pizza in a pan and flat bread appetizers, buffalo chicken grilled cheese and wings are amazing. The menu is huge.  The beers are great and I love the breakfast hours on the weekends for mimosas and breakfast foods! Great to stop after shopping for to fill up before you tackle the day!"
C M.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,1,1.0,12/17/2017,"Waited for ten minutes no server. Asked the hostess who the server was, she wanted to move us to a different section than we already were. Still no server, then I complained some more and finally got service. If the pizza and beer weren't so good, I would have left already."
Bill V.,"San Diego, CA",36,380,415,4.0,6/12/2017,"As you would expect if you know this national chain of craft beer brewpubs, this is a nice room, though it is considerably smaller than other BJ's locations I have visited. Staff were good but very busy: The place was packed, with a 30 minute wait for a table on a Friday around 6pm. They have that great system where they text you when your table is ready, so I ran over to Nordstrom Rack while I was waiting to see if I could find a new shirt. Once we got seated, the food came out pretty quickly given home busy they were, and it was tasty. I particularly like the Italian Market pizza. And of course you have to get the pizookie for dessert (which is best described as a deep-dish chocolate chip pizza/cookie with ice cream on top).  The beer, well, it is not my favorite and it seems to be aimed at the average drinker but it isn't bad. On this occasion I had a pint of the Tatonka Russian Imperial Stout (8.5% ABV): It didn't taste high alcohol, but it also didn't taste like an RIS (which I associate with really deep, rich roast, raisin/plum notes, and chocolate-like flavors). It wasn't even as flavorful as Guinness or most other stouts, let alone a typical RIS. It did have a nice stiff head and it was pure dark brown.   I'd go back. The patio looks like it would be awesome on a warm day. I think I'd try to pick an ""off-peak"" time, though, to avoid the crowds. To follow my quest to visit all 160+ craft breweries in San Diego, visit  ."
Meri D.,"San Diego, CA",99,730,2683,4.0,4/19/2017,"This BJ's is a newer one and in LJ in the same shopping center as the old one. ;]  This location is in *The Shops at La Jolla*  across from Nordstrom Rack. There is plenty of parking in this shopping center. The inside is newer and like your typical BJ's set-up with the dining, bar area, and outdoor patio. There are TV's all around the bar with different angle for good views for watching sports. On my trip was helped by a male server than it switched to a female server (he said this was because he was leaving but he was still there the whole time..?). Service here was good as she was warm, friendly, and attentive!  BEER Flight: 1. Berry Burst Cider =] 2. Harvest Hefeweizen  =] 3. Jeremiah Red =] 4. Tatonka Stout (bummer i wanted the PM Porter, but they were out. =] I also got the La Paloma which was not good. Eeeeek! I think it's because their version uses Tequila and Vodka, so it's like a half-@$$ long island. I should have known better, because I usually like Paloma for being refreshing and boozy, this was not the case because of the BJ's remix.  For food I tried the ""Mozarella Sticks"" which were plentiful and yummy. The Root Beer Glazed Ribs were tasty, meat fell right off the bone with  bomb sauce. I opted for this with a side of brussels sprouts instead of cole slaw. And for food I ate the ""BJ's Classic Combo"" which was perfect and nostalgic because I love their dough, pizza sauce, and cheesey goodness with the topping so of pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms because I haven't had BJ's in a long time previously had been to the Escondido and Chula Vista one.   Overall. I like this location and food and beer!! Cheers~"
Sunny W.,"La Jolla, CA",290,245,873,3.0,12/19/2016,"Honestly, not a bad place to be watching the game and having a couple of their own brews. I remember this place being a deep dish pizza place and serving the delectable pizookies. Now it seems like they're trying to be the one stop shop with 30 pages of food and drinks on their menu. It gets a little intimidating when you first get in, but eventually you'll weave out the pages you'll never order from. Service have always been pretty on point so definitely cant knock on that. Came the other night and got a Snakebite (Guinness and Cider) and a monkey ball pizzokie. Which wasn't really a pizookie, but more like small cinnamon rolls with a GIANT scoop of vanilla ice cream. Check out the picture I took...it's actually quiet amazing."
Ibrahim A.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,4.0,10/23/2017,"I like BJ's. It's one of the few franchise restaurant chains that actually provide quality food and use fresh ingredients. If you like beer, they do have a very wide selection of housemade brews as well as domestic and local choices, and that seems to be the reason why most people go. However, personally, I have to say that the biggest winner to me personally is their pizookies; it's a cookie and pizza hybrid so if I have to explain why that is an amazing creation I don't trust you. My favorite is the salted caramel pizookie. This location particularly is especially clean and the service is great. I would probably give most other locations 3 stars."
Jeff Y.,"San Diego, CA",64,18,5,1.0,9/12/2017,"Great atmosphere, but that is almost the only thing that was great.  We stood waiting for more than five minutes before anyone said Hello. We're finally directed to open seating in the bar area.  Service started off good. Then the drinks were slow being refilled. The hamburger came out, no mustard or ketchup.  And the ""well done"" hamburger was, raw with charbroiled outer layers, barley cooked. Didn't notice until I was almost done or it would have gone back.  The pizza is pretty good. Tea has a good flavor but just didn't fill the glasses often enough.  Splenda had to be requested more than once. Waiter would say right away but you would need to ask twice.   The white Chocolate Macadamia desert was very good.  Not sure I am willing to go back again. Certainly not if I have another choice.  If you are going to claim like you are multimillion dollar La Jolla your service needs to be worth a million not 50 cents I should have left for your tip. ."
Elliott P.,"La Jolla, CA",979,301,120,5.0,10/13/2016,"I've been here twice now, once on its third day open, and on its sixth. Love what they did with the place, wide open space and high ceilings inside, along with a relaxed outdoor area with open seating and a bar. The staff are definitely still getting up to speed, my table was forgotten and 2 orders were taken incorrectly but the staff were very accommodating and friendly so I don't believe it worth docking a star. (I got a free pizza from the mistake too!) The Hop Pact IPA (collab with Green Flash) is worth a try, though they are currently out (10/08/16). I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls. They've been my favorite at BJ's since 2008."
Hayden C.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",35,64,644,5.0,6/3/2017,"June 3rd, 2017 - Saturday This is what I think... Pros... -So many selections of food   (Pizza, Pasta, Salad  , and More!) -Food is good- (Average) -Decorations are fantastic! -Facility is clean -Staff are very friendly -Many TV's everywhere to watch your favorite game -Restrooms are really clean Cons... -Prices are a bit expensive for what it's worth"
Manyara O.,"Ontario, CA",2,13,1,4.0,10/13/2017,My friend and I went in to get $3 pizookies. The service was very friendly but slow. The pizookies were great which helped make up for it
Julie D.,"San Diego, CA",300,107,192,4.0,12/4/2016,"Came here at 10 PM for my friend's 21st birthday and since we're UCSD students, we thought: BJs seems like a chill place to eat.  Read the fine print: Happy hour (10 PM to close) is ONLY at the bar. *facepalm* we were kind of excited about some of the Happy Hour deals such as half off the mini dish and $1 off drinks. The mini deep dish is tiny (like the size of a large woman's hand) and we were kind of astounded that it costed $11+ depending on the type. But thankfully the manager that night gave us the discount after we asked for clarification!  They take reservations so when we walked in, the table was already set up and ready for us. The service was a tad slow but I don't blame them, it's 10 PM (we stayed until almost close) and I'm sure the workers were super tired.  Honestly, The food was like a 7.5/10 due to personal preference but gave BJs 4 stars for pretty good service and decent food.  WHAT I ORDERED. - BBQ Bison Burger: served with Coleslaw. Nothing extraordinary about it. I liked the BBQ with the grassy bison meat. The burger was cooked really well, with some pinkness in the middle, just how I like it.  - Pizzokie Trio: I split this with two other girls and got the salted caramel Pizzokie. Not a fan of this. It was too salty and too sweet at the same time and I swear I bit into a salt pocket while eating this. However, every thing else was so freaking sweet it kind of counteracted the saltiness but I'd rather not go through that haha"
Chee K.,"Portland, OR",64,253,179,4.0,4/12/2017,"This was a really nice surprise. From the outside it looked crowded. It's a nice family friend pub bar/restaurant. Inside there's plenty of TVs and clientele ranges from families, people on dates, friends meeting up. I also enjoyed that they have daily special, we came twice and took advantage of the special on the second day $5 in house beers on tap. The first night was a little crowded but we grabbed a sweet spot on their patio. It was a little chilly but they had heat lamps. I order this most delicious salmon on quinoa salad. It was so fresh and tasty and everything worked together! My husband got salmon tacos on pita, also a win. Our drinks were slow to come, and I had to wave down a food runner to ask for them. There was a kids menu and the kids approved of the free fruit salad and garlic knot.  We also order a most delicious appetizer of fried calamari. Had to stop myself from scarfing the entire thing down. Love crispy fresh calamari.  The second night was a little more subduded. It was our last night in San Diego so I wanted more fish tacos. I order their grilled shrimp and one halibut tacos. It wasn't my favorite tacos on the trip but still pretty good. I also ordered their in house IPA. Weirdly, the beer had no taste. I was expecting hoppy and dry notes but I got nothing.  The service was pretty awesome on the second night. I feel that it's not always consistent but way above average in terms of food, service and atmosphere. Be ready for then book of menu though!  If I lived in this area, this place would be on the regular rotation. Yum!"

The BJ's that was in the same complex was one of the first ones I got to experience and after seeing so many of the newer locations pop up with a bar, outdoor seating and just bigger facility, the lil one we had in La Jolla (although still busy) wasn't really the idea place to go to that I ended up at their Mission Valley location more often.   Love their appetizers and happy hour.  Don't forget to get a pazookie!"

Our party of 9 had no problems getting a table during the week for lunch. We opted to sit outside. The patio has multiple tvs and also heaters, although we didn't need the heater on. Their lunch specials are really a great value so we all ordered from that menu. I had the chicken baked potato and the broccoli cheddar soup. Still tasted as great as I remembered, the potato was just smaller than I recalled. One of my coworkers had the unlimited soup and salad and he really enjoyed that. It was my birthday, so they brought out a mini pizookie for me, however, they just handed it like it was an order versus trying to surprise me...I can't complain though; it's a free pizookie! Food was great, but service was really slow. I feel like our server was responsible for the entire patio so it took us a while to get water refills and our bill. I often get coupons for BOGO free (even on to go orders), so I'll have to try out BJ's again soon."
Amanda P.,"Campo, CA",85,5,,4.0,12/2/2017,"Me and a friend came here for a late lunch on a Saturday, we had no wait for our seating and our server, Bonnie came right away to take our drink orders. She apologized in advance and let us know she was very busy and she seemed to be one of the only servers working at the time. She actually didn't have us waiting very long at all. I ordered a burger and when i bit into it, there was still paper on the cheese! We let our server know right away and she took the burger off our bill and continued to check on us regularly. She even suggested a few different beers to sample. Thank you Bonnie for being so great to us!"

Went there the past weekend - just one week after their opening :) The location is great - heart of UTC and the ambiance is so much better than any of the BJs I have been too. Recently i had stopped going to BJs because the food was not great anymore -- but looking at the place i decided to give it a try - and glad I did. They have ample inside, outside and at the bar. We choose to sit at the patio -it was nice - tables for large groups as well as small with pretty lights. The selection of beer and drinks were great - we opted for beer - I have always loved their lightswitch. They also had beers from local brewery like green flash - but they were out that day !  They have significantly improved their food menu with good vegetarian options. We ordered the flat bread nachos for appetizers and they were really yummy. We ordered their thin crust pizza and it was good - a good change sometimes from the fast-flash thin crust pizzas. I love that they now have mini pizookies. Perfect portion for one person. I got the ghirardelli chocolate one - and it was divine ! They have lot of servers - since the place is new and they are training the staff so might feel a  little uncomfortable - but for us it was not too bad. Plus they will return to normal numbers after the training is done. I love that they are open till late - perfect place to hangout on weeknights as well. I will be back for sure..."
