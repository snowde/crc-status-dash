Mark E.,"San Diego, CA",4,23,6,3.0,4/23/2017,"Many types of beer (not just BJs beers) and full bar. They are dog friendly on the patio. The manager said as much. They have a decent brunch on weekends. They have a huge menu, so not just pizzas. Everything is pretty good except the meat sandwiches. The pulled pork and prime rib dip are like 50% fat. On the other hand, the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles is great. The wings are pricey off happy hour ($12) but then again they give you a pound so it's a lot. Twisted BLT salad is excellent."
Debs S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/6/2017,"The fried chicken salad was ok but pretty bland. This place is way under staffed. We waited 20 minutes for a server to greet us. And then after that, 3 tables that sat down after us got their food first. We waited almost 40 minutes to get our food and it wasn't even that busy and there was only 2 of us eating. The service is bad and the food was not that great."
Scott C.,"Vista, CA",2,12,3,5.0,5/15/2017,I was part of a Wedding Party and we had the Rehearsal Dinner here.  The level of service was far and above that of any BJ's I have ever been to.  Thank you!  They were very quick to meet all our needs and they took care of us from start to finish.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience or better service.
Vince H.,"San Diego, CA",428,10,5,5.0,10/2/2016,"Attended the soft opening and was seated at the bar. The new open air environment, especially here in La Jolla, was the perfect ambient for a fun and social dinner. Since the weather is great almost all year round, making the decision to be an open air restaurant was a smart move. Definitely recommend coming out here on sport nights to grab a few drinks and bites. I had the pleasure of being served by the bartender, Alyssa. She had such a great personality that definitely brightened up and went hand in hand with the new layout. She served us our drinks fast, gave us great recommendations, and always made sure we were pleased. She will definitely be my go to person to be served by. Needless to say, I will be coming back here every weekend for some destressing from the work week and enjoying the fresh air, great sports on tv, and fantastic drinks. P.S. The house brew Oktoberfest and BJ's Royal Soda are my recommended drinks!"
Kacy W.,"La Jolla, CA",51,19,15,3.0,12/6/2016,"After calling ahead and only getting meager assurance that dogs were welcome on the patio, we decided to chance it and bring our pup. Once we got there, we found it to be quite dog friendly. The service, food, and beer were all great! Highly recommend the whiskey barrel stout; it is not the typical stout with random vanilla/chocolate/coffee flavoring. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was also very good."
Clark T.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,5,,5.0,5/5/2017,Our waiter Shean was great and super accommodating and the food and drink were excellent I had the BBQ bison burger and a Paloma
Kristi D.,"San Diego, CA",12,95,76,5.0,11/2/2016,"Oh so glad this place opened ...great location sitting in and outside . Fire pits on the patio and the food and drink is top notch . We have been here twice and my favorite well "" French dip"" my bf had the chili , don't let the name fool you it's just like ya mama made it but with beer! The feta stuff mushroom is a great share dish. Calamari is great and crunchy with dipping sauce . The beers well let's just say it can keep you busy but they have all libations just keep you smiling . Stop in but late night gets pretty busy with the college kids so we go early like 5 for hh specials... btw FYI NOW FRI,SAT&SUN THEY HAD THE BEST PRIME RIB PLATE LOOK AT THE SIZE AND VERY LEAN MY BF GETS THE HUGE SLOW ROASTED PORK CHOP THICK N JUICY"
Michael J.,"Lakeside, CA",30,195,2,4.0,1/26/2017,"The ribeye is always very good, asparagus was a bit undercooked. Patrick our server was great. Side of ranch could be bigger, had to ask for extras more than once."
Diana K.,"La Jolla, CA",0,11,1,4.0,10/4/2016,"I will start with the Pro's- AMAZING WiFi experience, attentive & friendly service, cool atmosphere, food was good. I love that you can order, pay, etc. from the mobile app. Shout out to BJ's for being ahead of the curve from a technology perspective! Overall this is a great addition to our neighborhood.   I had to remove one star- One big negative for us is that the patio is not dog friendly. There are plenty of great local places in the area that welcome dogs on the patio (Urban Plates!), so unfortunately we won't be spending as much time here as we would have liked. This causes the vibe to feel more commercial and reminds us as locals that this is a chain restaurant. I hope they will consider allowing dogs on the patio at this location once they move past opening week!"
James B.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/21/2017,"Well, we met another couple here for a pizza. After perusing the menu, we decided on one of the 'Tavern-Cut' pizzas and the 'BJ-Brewhouse Classic'. The small picture we saw was indicated to be a 16""x10"" with 12 slices. Gee, that should do it for the four of us! Turns out the 16""x10"" is an OVAL with the 10"" at its widest and 16"" at its longest (not a large rectangle as we supposed it to be). And, while it is flatbread, it is incredibly thin. And the topping; what topping? We were looking at the 5-cheese blend but not much of it. And 12 slices; while we thought 3 slices each would be great - turns out each slice is about 2""x1"" (this is a slice?) - kinda bite-size. We didn't think much of the mushroom portion of the topping, either. All in all, a HUGE disappointment as to quantity, just not enough to satisfy four people. Appetizer, perhaps; Pizza, not. And, I would have thought the waiter would have let us know just how small it would be for four people. Gee, and all that for only $15. Oh, yeah, in all fairness, the taste was pretty good for a sample. Don't know if we'll be back to try something else or not (probably not)."
Flash Z.,"San Diego, CA",3,240,4,4.0,2/27/2017,This is a good Bj's much better than la mesa! Enjoyed our dinner last night before the theatre!
Amy S.,"San Diego, CA",25,57,11,5.0,10/16/2016,"Yeah, I'm reviewing BJ's. I am finding it ridiculously difficult to find outstanding service at restaurants in San Diego, and Juan at the newly-reopened BJ's in La Jolla was outstanding. He was extremely attentive and had a great smile while he served us.  I mean, he actually seemed like he enjoyed his job. This is rare! The other staff was amazing as well. There was a server delivering drinks who was just as attentive as Juan. At least two or three others came by to check on us. Again, I have not had service like this very often in San Diego.  Their pizza doesn't ever disappoint. I had the tomato basil, and it has that wonderful, salty, buttery rich flavor you crave in a pizza. My husband had a very nice-looking seared tuna salad that he polished off. He also destroyed the calamari. He ordered the salted caramel pizookie on Juan's recommendation, and it was so amazingly decadent.  They have a great indoor/outdoor bar area. They offer tasters on their beers, and they made a very nice dirty martini for me. Well done for a satisfying Friday night out."
Alyssa L.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,7,5.0,4/7/2017,"We love this location of BJ's! My husband and I always love BJ's, but here the service is exceptional. The server was very attentive & the manager Johnathan was very kind. We will be back!"
Roberto N.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,5.0,4/27/2017,"Can't complain, food was good, service was good, plenty of games on the tv's by the bar area. Had some seared ahi tuna salad, was delicious. Thinking of trying that pork dish with 2 bones next time around..."
John M.,"Victorville, CA",0,30,4,4.0,2/28/2017,Excellent service and good food as usual I would definitely recommend this place to family and friends.
Lesia M.,"Kansas City, MO",6,62,2,4.0,8/5/2017,"Food was great but the waitress was lackadaisical. Reasonable prices nice environment. Spinach artichoke dip, Brussels sprouts, and tavern style pizza were all tasty."
Lindsay N.,"La Jolla, CA",8,25,2,5.0,11/18/2016,"SOOOO HAPPY BJS IS BACK. The service is great, the staff is incredibly helpful and the chefs are whipping up some incredible food!! Whoever is back there making the food...Thank you, it is sooo good. I will be back for sure. Headed to pick up a take out order as we speak!! Yum yum yum!!"
Blake B.,"Encinitas, CA",251,6,,1.0,4/7/2017,"Literally had the worst waitress ever here. I went here on a casual double date and she was SO out of it. She messed up our check 2 times and forgot to bring the check out to us for the 3rd. She came up to us and asked ""can I get you any water?"" after we had waited for the check for 20 minutes and mentioned we were still waiting on the check and she told us she had forgot about it... literally after 2 times of us sending it back so she could get it right."
Laura H.,"Tucson, AZ",4,50,3,4.0,1/28/2017,"BJs is always good. Love the home brewed Rootbeer. Have tried everything on the menu, but this time, got the salmon with couscous which was so delicious. One of the better things I have ever tried here. Mashed potatoes and gravy are always delicious. save room for the pazookies!! You can usually find a coupon for them online. I think the best is salted caramel as it also has chocolate in it."
Mia H.,"San Diego, CA",158,4,4,5.0,10/2/2016,"Bj's restaurant, new location on villa la Jolla, soft opening day. Oct 1 2016 Pros: friendly atmosphere, modern spacious design, awesome full stocked bar, family friendly, delicious food. Gorgeous open patio. Cons: the location is still around a few construction due to remodeling so parking might be a hassle, but it will done soon. On October 1st, I stopped by BJs on the corner of Villa La jolla for a bite to eat and drinks. It was around 5:30pm,  my flatmates and I live down the street and used to come by to dine with the previous location. When we walked in, the staff apologized for the commotion due to the soft opening and training thier new hires. So, the meals were free but alcohol was charged. What a deal am I right ;). All proceeds went to    a charity, I think it was cystic fibrosis.  We grabbed 3 spots at the bar, chairs were nice and comfortable living, atmosphere was awesome and had a nice relaxing escape with the extended patio. Our bartender was Alyssa, she was an awesome delight. She was patient with our orders, recommended lots of entrees, gave us options on what drinks she can make based on our tastes. We started off with thier homemade oktoberfest, watermelon mojito, and a pink Cadillac. The watermelon mojito was a custom, which I appreciated Alyssa doing. The pink Cadillac was an ultimate martini I definitely recommend, it's my favorite. As an appetizer, we started out with the Flatbread nachos. These were addictive and divine. We couldn't get enough. For entrees we ordered chicken soba noodles with peanut sauce, chicken club sandwich, and a chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. Alyssa was kind enough to grab us plates in order for us to sample each other's plates. Honestly, everything was delicious I would definitely order the chicken Soba noodles and chicken spinach quinoa bowl again. Chicken club if I felt like  lunch.    The prices are reasonably priced. Overall, I loved my experience at BJ'S, my flatmates and I enjoyed this place so much we have agreed we will return every weekend as our hangout (how I met your mother status)."
