Brandon B.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/2/2016,"Have a few things to say: 1. Food was great (flatbread nachos are huge!) 2. Atmosphere is great (bar open to outside)  3. People were great (bartender Alyssa was fun, and made tasty drinks!) 4. Oktoberfest BJ homebrew is a must try!"
Rachel E.,"La Jolla, CA",0,7,7,4.0,3/29/2017,"The pizookies are the only reason I come here! Soft, chewy cookie with ice cream on top! The food is average but the service is great!"
Ashley H.,"Mission Viejo, CA",1,5,,5.0,2/24/2017,"This was the first time checking this location out after their move and all I can say is WOW! It is so much bigger and better all around. Also customer service and food quality each earned an A+. We went in around 10pm, it was not super packed but it wasn't empty. We had our drinks within 2 minutes of ordering and then our appetizer within 10 minutes of ordering. Our server Jenny refilled our drinks before they ever got completely empty. Our food came out piping hot and delicious! We left super impressed with everything and would recommend this location."
Nick L.,"San Diego, CA",195,18,16,4.0,12/26/2016,Spoiler alert.... no more calzones  but they do have a huge menu and nice waitresses. Delicious beer too
Solomon S.,"El Cajon, CA",0,86,34,5.0,1/5/2017,"Had amazing customer tonight.  Elaine (the waitress) and Jonathan (the manager) gave us amazing service.  The waitress was mindful to fill our cups, and when my wife found hair on her plate, they put it on the house and gave her another place of flood!  The food was not bad either: I had the mahi mahi fried tacos with fries, and the the green sauce, which I assume has avocado in it, was really good.  My wife had the black and bleu burger, which she said was juicy.  My daughter had chicken strips, fries and chocolate meal (kid's meal).  And my sister, aunt and cousin had their meals as well.  Amazing service tonight in celebration of my cousin's 7th birthday.  Good job Jonathan (sp?) and Elaine G."
Haidii L.,"Las Vegas, NV",461,26,1,3.0,11/15/2016,Last time I went with a friend to free pizookie day.. however the only thing good was the pizookie. My steak was burnt and the service took way too long. It took forever to take my order and give us the food. Honestly getting the free pizookie was the only thing that made this trip here worth it..and even still it was a stretch. Would never come here unless it was pizookie day again.
Dianna M.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",30,33,9,3.0,11/3/2016,"Second time here.  Great atmosphere and location. Food is amazing but the bar staff needs improvement.  No basic knowledge on menu items - which okay they are bartenders so may not know the menu but they should know basic things like which wines they serve and which top shelf liquors. Also, they are very chatty with each other and could improve on customer service.  First time I was here I gave them the benefit of doubt that it may be a fluke but since this is my second time here and the same thing happened it may be time for more training."
Kaylynn E.,"San Diego, CA",71,1,,1.0,12/2/2016,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Let me start by saying that I don't think it was entirely our waiters fault. I believe it was the staff and the kitchen who caused us to have an absolutely terrible night. A group of 10 of us arrived at around 8:15pm for a friend's birthday. They said that they don't make reservations and could not accommodate all of us so we had to sit down outside (it was about 53F). We ordered drinks which took a good 20 minutes to get to the table. We then all ordered appetizers which came out without a hitch and then we ordered our entrées. We did not receive our food until 10pm! We kept asking about the food and our waiter said that it would be out shortly and he would keep checking. By 10:15 only 4 people had received their food, two of which were ice cold. Two people had ordered soup(which tasted like it came from a can) and a different blonde waitress came out with the wrong ones. We kindly told her there had been a mix up and she gave us complete attitude. Another ordered a hot chocolate because it was so flipping cold outside and half of the hot chocolate was on the saucer and spilled down the side of the mug. The birthday girl's sandwich came out first. Then her soup and birthday dessert came out at the same exact time after her sandwich. It was so frustrating. The food I personally recieved was decent but honestly I could have made it better at home. We asked to speak to a manager and it took him a good 20 minutes untill he could spare the time to talk to us. He gave us a discount on our meal but it does not make up for ruining my friend's birthday. I will 100% never come back here again. If you want BJ's, go down to the one in San Diego off the 8 freeway because this one is an absolute shit show."
Ernesto Y.,"Gardena, CA",59,21,,5.0,12/24/2016,Nice spot to kill time. I watched the Raider game here and it was enjoyable. Sarah was my bartender. Sweet as pie. The kitchen manager offered me a couple samples which was nice but by then I was already deep in Modelos and a Jameson so I couldnt partake. Next time Im in SD I'll be coming here. I woule give more stars but see the way yelp is set up......
Anand G.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/17/2016,"Thursdays are always a win win. Reverse happgy hour starts at 10:00 , so good beers and good food for a cheap price!  Just do it !"
Celly N.,"San Diego, CA",2,16,15,5.0,1/27/2017,"I love this place, the whole crew is friendly and prompt to help you out. Food comes out quick and tasty. Lots of options. Cristina was friendly and nice enough to accommodate my special order (;"
Randy H.,"Lansing, IL",0,6,5,5.0,7/30/2017,Food was very good! Had the spicy chicken peanut noodles. Beer was average.  Waiter was very polite.
Kekoa M.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",96,4,1,1.0,4/30/2017,"The general managers listens to apartments across the street and that is apparently is the tipping point for management. They cannot manage a front of house. A neighborhood bar which isn't closed until 1am... San Diego serves alcohol until 2 am. My group has been in the restaurant since 4pm and it is now 10pm. Our group has had awful service to start with an appetizer every hour until our second waiter was on duty. Hector was amazing!!! He heard our concerns and made them better ten fold. But the FOH manager Helaina Menterz came out and was aggressive and unapologetic. Our server was in control as were we and Helaina cut us off after ""receiving complaints from the apartments across the street as well as tables in the same section."" My group enjoys a happy hour, we also have non drinkers but my group definitely has fun loud friends within. Never once have we had an incident at a bar/restaurant or getting home safely thanks to ride share apps like uber and lyft. There was no warrants for treating us the way we were treated. Our second waiter made sure we weren't belligerent and had water before taking our next drink order and there was no warning that our single party was being too loud for the area that we were in. Helaina was out of line in her accusations and simply was inconsiderate. She completely disregarded that fact that we have had bad service for the first half of the night then cut off for being too loud with out a warning. Helaina had made up her mind before making it to our table. Her disposition on us as a gay couple and the situation of the group being eccentric as a fun loving group is unacceptable in this day and age. We are very disappointed in our treatment since we both have been great customers of bjs for a long time. It's just unfortunate that a company is so closed minded and full of hatred to certain groups of their customers. I'm very disappointed all around for being treated like a second class citizen."
Moni G.,"Ballwin, MO",25,30,138,1.0,10/7/2016,Not good... to many servers standing around not offering to get water for table.. staff to new not familiar with menu or serving
Drew A.,"San Diego, CA",133,8,,5.0,9/29/2016,Went to the soft opening yesterday and the layout there is awesome! Great date spot or place to catch a happy hour and/or sporting event. Super crystal clear big screen tvs with nice placement. Staff is very prompt and friendly. The outdoor patio area is amazing. Definitely a cool casual spot that you should check out!
Sandra S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",135,5,,3.0,7/17/2017,"The service is great. All of the waiters were super friendly and loved to interact with the guests. However, BJ's downfall is that it's very expensive while the food is a little mediocre. Everyone I went with was unsatisfied with the food, which felt as if it were just heated up in a microwave."
Jamie R.,"San Diego, CA",27,14,3,5.0,11/27/2016,So happy to have a great place to watch football in the area. There are a few but this place seems to have it all. Absolutely love bartender Cesar who is by far the best one there. He is always on top of his game.  Beer and wine lists are on point. The food so far has been great and the menu is pretty extensive so lots of choices.
Robert H.,"San Diego, CA",0,20,,1.0,12/13/2016,"Went back for a third visit tonight and what a change We sat at high top in the bar.even though it was not too busy @ 5:30. I finally had to go to the front to get menus even though our eventual server walked by several times. Due to past experience we ordered drinks first because we knew it would take awhile. In a nutshell, dinner came before our wine order, I had to go to the front desk to pay our bill because the server did not pick it up. I also had to go to the bar to get change when the Mgr. came up to see why we were still there. Explained the poor service, declined the offer of a gift card. Not a great time."
Pam H.,"Spring Valley, CA",4,8,,1.0,7/12/2017,"I didn't like the experience this week at this location for lunch. I ordered a lunch size spaghetti and meatball meal.  For $9.99 I the adequate dish came with one small bite sized ""garlic knot"" I asked for more bread. I was told ""one"" comes per customer. That just bothered me for the principle.  They make plenty of money on overpriced dishes. They should provide a decent size piece of bread with pasta without the customer having to ask.  I felt bad for the waitress having to tell her customer this ridiculous policy. I wont be back to this particular location as the view is of the parking lot. I am willing to pay more for ambiance. This has none."
Rakhi B.,"San Diego, CA",51,126,3,5.0,10/31/2016,"the food was good and the atmosphere was very well done.  I love the new BJs here, especially the fire pits area and the appetizers were delicious.  I also liked my cucumber lemonade."
