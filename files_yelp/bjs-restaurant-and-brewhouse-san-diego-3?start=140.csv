Matthew G.,"San Diego, CA",74,11,,4.0,7/9/2017,"We go here all the time. My toddler loves it for some reason, probably the kid's options. Pizza is good, and the menu is large. My only issue is the food occasionally comes out not as good as the last time I ordered it. The staff are usually wonderful, but I recently had a very inattentive waiter. Overall, a good place especially if your in need of a big menu."
Renalyn Q.,"San Diego, CA",644,16,1,4.0,11/14/2016,"The new restaurant across from Nordstrom Rack in the same plaza as Whole Foods. It's location is easy for anyone to find. Inside it looks more of a home decor. The staff there are all very friendly and they always have monthly specials. Don't forget to become a Bj's reward member, it's free to sign up and you receive a free mini pizookie on your next dine in. All the money that you spend in the restaurant gets accumulated to points which you'll be able to redeem at any time."
F R.,"Washington, DC",0,7,,5.0,11/6/2016,Pretty busy on Friday. All the staff was really nice and friendly. Waitress gave good recommendations. We had a grea
J J.,"San Diego, CA",4,45,8,1.0,10/12/2016,"Nope! We went a few nights ago to give it a try, and really wish we didn't.  They don't have reservations, but something called the ""call ahead list"".. which ended up being the same wait (30 mins) as the people who just showed up at the door. Minus points. The service: was unbelievably uncomfortable. Felt like there were more people working than guests. All the waiters/waitresses were trying SO hard, it made us feel super uncomfortable. We heard one waiter literally repeat the exact same words, in the exact same fake happy tone, to about 5 tables.. felt like we were stuck in some creepy matrix. We don't like forced kindness forced upon us. Minus points. The food: We got the dry sriracha rub boneless chicken, and a flatbread (can't even remember which one), and a kale salad. The boneless chicken was a lot of batter, very little meat. The flatbread was obviously not memorable. Salad was gone in 2 mins cause it was tiny. But, the worst part was after leaving the location. I don't know WHAT they put in the food, and we both had indigestion issues that lasted 2 days. So beware if you have a sensitive stomach or are not used to eating fried foods, and a shit ton of oil. Super minus points!!! The menu: all over the place. No wonder why the food wasn't good. It's like a glorified Chili's. The only good thing about here is they have a pretty decent selection of beers, and a lot of TV's, so probably good for drinking + sports. But as a culinary location... no."
Abbe A.,"San Diego, CA",13,69,,1.0,3/26/2017,"I stopped here mid afternoon yesterday (Saturday) with my 2 preschoolers because they enjoy the North County mall location and we were all hungry after an adventure at La Jolla Cove. We were quickly seated and greeted by a server and her trainee. We ordered drinks and I asked for a large cheese pizza while we decided what else we wanted. Things seemed to be going well, except they didn't! After a long while (approximately 20 minutes) the server and her trainee returned and I asked about the status of the pizza and ordered a salad. They said they would check on the pizza. The salad came out and we ate it. The problem seemed to be that even though they had only a few tables and there were 2 servers, they didn't have a good sense of what was going on and didn't do a good job of checking back frequently. I think it was this point- about 35 minutes in, that I realized something was really messed up. Eventually a ""kids pizza"" was delivered with the promise of another one coming. I told them that I had ordered a large pizza and not a kids size. At this point the manager came over and we started getting somewhere with the promise of a pizza in about 12 minutes. It was at this point that I considered bailing as my kids were climbing and being kids. They were hungry, heck, I was hungry. They know the drill, they sit down and color and a pizza comes out...but not here. After much time (over 1 hour)- a pizza was brought out. We ate, the servers were not easily found to get our check and a to go box. My concern is that the person training the new server was subpar. She had really poor customer service, wasn't attentive, just didn't seem to care. The manager comped our pizza and I paid for our lemonades and salad. I have never not left a tip even when the service is slow or not great. I was a server for 2 summers during college. I appreciate great service. But I also expect to be treated respectfully and with care. The staff here did neither. I got the general managers card and will be sending a similarly worded email. This is not the way that customers should be treated."
Whitney P.,"San Diego, CA",0,18,,5.0,11/18/2016,"I was so impressed by the customer service at this location. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted by the sweetest hostess. I didn't catch her name, but I wish I had to give her props for her service. She immediately took note of my 3 year old and offered us one of the huge booths, knowing that toddlers never sit still. It was so refreshing to have someone take the time to acknowledge that toddlers are not easy to dine with, and try to make it as comfortable as possible for this warn out momma. I don't know her name, but I do know that she was the blonde working on 11/18 around 3pm.  The next thing that really stood out to me was the toddler starter they sent out complimentary. It was a roll and a few pieces of fruit. Seriously, how stinking awesome to feel like my child was welcome, not like we were stuffed in the corner hidden from bothering other guests as we are so often.  The third thing that made this visit special was our server, Sean. He was just so on point. He was prompt attentive and so polite. Honestly probably one of the best servers I have ever had. He knew exactly when to come back and check on us, he was always keeping an eye out to see if we needed anything else, and took the time to make awesome beer suggestions.  I have been in BJ's restaurants many times, but this by far was the best experience I have ever had. The food was awesome, the service was awesome, and the location is so convenient. I am very excited I discovered this location, I will be back.  Thank you BJ's for showing me that customer service is not dead!"
Joanna M.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/17/2017,"Came in for a graduation party. Our server, Sean, was absolutely amazing! He was very attentive & such a pleasure to talk to! He made us feel very welcome & made the experience great for us all! Will definitely ask for Sean as a server when we're back :)"
Say H.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,24,4.0,10/22/2016,"Stopped by this place after the private shopping party at Nordstrom Rack on a weekday.  As expected, parking was a challenge.  Once at BJ's, everything went smooth.  The patio set-up was perfect.  BJ's food and drinks were great.  We had calamari, chicken wings bone in naked with side of blue cheese dip, artichoke dip with chips and stuffed mushrooms.  For drinks, I started off with a glass of pinot then cucumber/jalapeno cocktail (cant remember the name).  Friends/coworkers got the fruity berry drinks which they said were good too. Overall, we all went home happy and most likely will come back."
R A.,"Escondido, CA",0,43,,1.0,8/7/2017,"Uggggg. Worst experience. The waiter  tried so I hate to do one star but awful... Took about 5 minutes to be seated (it was NOT crowded). We sat outside and EVERYTHING- (napkins, coasters, skin) stuck to the table. We asked the waiter for a rag but he said, ""that is just how the table is made and u can wipe it down but it will stay wet and sticky."" Are you serious?? Just GROSS. Waited on our drinks for about 10 minutes. Another server ended up bringing them bc we could just see them sitting at the bar. Had to ask for our friends drink to be brought as we saw it just sitting at the bar. Waited at least 25-30 minutes for our food. Once again- NOT CROWDED (maybe 3 tables inside and 4-5 outside) Table seated after us was done eating by the time we got our order. Had to ask for our food and mine came out cold. Didn't even bother to send it back. Everyone's order either didn't come with what they asked for or came with extra of what they requested to not be on there...  Horrible experience. Will not be back."
Honest C.,"San Diego, CA",1,31,,3.0,5/16/2017,"Have been to this BJ's several times and the food is quite good.  I knocked down a couple stars for the following reasons.  Their hamburger is served dry, with no sauce.  They don't even put sauce on the side.  You have to ask for ketchup, mustard, mayo or whatever sauce you like. Also the waitress gave us a to go box for our pizza, but didn't clear the table.  It was very difficult to pack our pizza with all the plates in the way.  Other than those 2 issues, it's a great place to eat."
Gina C.,"San Diego, CA",188,11,15,1.0,12/26/2016,"Boooooooo we order the queso dip and chips, nope! Then the burgers  nope! Don't do it.... so salty so greasy and my salad had way to much dressing.... burger over cooked  ... thank goodness I had water!"
Jeannie C.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,1,1.0,4/29/2017,"This was by far the worst service experience we have had at a BJ's location. It took 24 minutes to get a cup of coffee. The creamer was bad so it ruined that cup. Second cup had the same issue. The server did not come back to check, we had to find her. She was nothing short of annoyed that she was going to have to actually do her job. The kitchen manager, Axel, was able to provide us with a cup of coffee and apologized for the situation. He was doing his best to do damage control for several guests, so it seems dreadful service is the culture of the servers at this location. Again, nothing from the server. She was not concerned or friendly. This was terrible service. She never came back to the table."
Aubrey W.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,32,,4.0,2/27/2017,"Only reason for the missing star was the crowd. We came during the dinner rush and the hostess seemed a bit overwhelmed as the lobby was filling up fast and she was dealing with a customer on the phone before she could seat anyone. We skipped the wait and went straight to the bar. The bartender, Jeremy, was awesome. Great attitude, checked on us consistently, made great beer recommendations (try the PB stout!) and suggested we alter our order to get more bang for our buck. Mediterranean flatbread was flavorful and crispy perfection, you should've seen the look on his face when he saw how quickly we inhaled it"
Jay Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,57,4,5.0,5/27/2017,Get the dessert try the cookie ice cream thing. Save room for dessert I'm telling you. Thank me later. The pizza is great also. The pasta is okay.
Spencer R.,"San Diego, CA",294,3,2,5.0,10/5/2016,"This was our first time coming into the new BJ's location. We did not expect our dining experience to be so great. Rose was our server and she made our experience awesome. She was funny, kind and extremely helpful. Rose was patient and attentive. We will definitely be coming back and we hope Rose will be our server when we return."
Kayla R.,"San Diego, CA",21,8,,5.0,2/5/2017,came in late night with my boyfriend. our server sean was awesome.. helped us out with our questions and was super friendly. we'll be back because of him!
Joyce C.,"La Jolla, CA",42,33,,4.0,7/24/2017,"I used to go to the old location  a few years ago and it was pretty bad food wise that I have not returned for  a  good few years.  After the remodel and  being in a new location I  took the risk  and I can tell you that the  food is  much better all the way around.   Food is consistent in quality and  also service  is a lot better more attentive.  I like  ho its more spacious too so its comfortable. i think I asked the corporate guy last night if they  changed their cooks   because the cooks  in this new location seem to know what they are doing. Apparently, they said they got better  ingredients so that makes a  big difference. I gotten the  Shrimp Quinoa  bowl twice now and love it. The  stuffed mushrooms   last night were  great wish they were  bigger mushrooms but still yummy.  The Shrimp scampi  was  yummy from what my  cousin said. He also had to fill out the  form for the  dish as they are  trying to get feed back before putting it permanently  on the menu. Did the Pozookie trio  Love the salted  caramel,  big chunk chocolate chip.  Not a  fan of the churro as its only churro and ice cream that's it, no cookie  with it.  Overall very satisfied, overall great food and service!"
Andrew H.,"Boston, MA",163,1,,5.0,4/3/2017,One of the most friendly services I've ever had at a restaurant! The waiters and waitresses were super eager to help us with anything we needed. Doesn't hurt that the food was fantastic too!
Kit C.,"San Diego, CA",37,3,5,2.0,3/15/2017,Do not order online for takeout- my order was missing one entree and i was not given a receipt. Called the manager and he said refund will go back to my card-did NOT get my $$ back - BAD customer service. This was Feb 10 around 6pm at BJ La Jolla
Ciara F.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/10/2017,This place sucks. They have good food but if your ready to spend 4 hours waiting for it be my guest. The waiters disappear for 30 minutes at a time and are super oblivious. They lost our order and we had to wait an additional 45 minutes for them to correct it and then they ended up getting our check wrong 3 times. I came with my 2 other friends and they wouldn't split the check for us. This whole processes was extremely frustrating and instead of a peaceful Friday night I got a stress filled environment. The manager who was at the restaurant didn't even come apologize for the ordeal. It was ridiculous and I will never go back.
