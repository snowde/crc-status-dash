Erlin K.,"Glendale, CA",0,8,,1.0,2/3/2017,"Horrible service... Seated fairly quickly, yet left us in the corner with not even a cup of water for over 25 minutes before a waiter who just started his shift decided to come and help us. Ridiculous."
Kusum J.,"Lancaster, CA",51,1,,1.0,2/27/2017,Giving one star just cause the food was good. Otherwise service was horrible came in here to have a few drinks. The waitress most have some personal issue since I ordered a vegetarian pizza with jalapeño but did I get it no and when told that I had ordered jalapeño on it she said no it doesn't come with it ok but I asked you to put them on it. Instead of fixing it oh I can bring some on the side I didn't hear you say you wanted them. Ummm yes you did cause you said sure. Then I asked for napkins instead was given a cloth with utensils umm I didn't ask for that cause I already have it. Wait there is still more my friend asked for water first of all you should give water to start off anyways unless one says no so I asked for a water also but did I get it? No my friend got hers and I had to ask for it again kind you I had ordered another drink and had to wait for that for 30 mins still no water then she finally came with my drink but no water so I ask again can I please have water yes I'm annoyed now finally I get water but the waitress slams it on the table and leaves with an attitude. All I can say is I'm not having that and she needs to go back and learn how to serve and keep a cool admit when you make a mistake and apologize. I won't come here again. Nor recommend it. I think the waitress was racist cause she was white!!!

GRANT our server made our night ! He was attentive , knowledgeable with drinks / menu and personable . We will be back again soon !!!"
Bambi G.,"Whittier, CA",3,4,2,1.0,11/26/2016,"Worst BJ's I have ever!!! We waited 30 minutes for them to clean the empty table where we were to be seated (I know because I could see the table). They finally sat us and about 10 minutes after we orders it started raining and we were seated outside so we asked the manager if he could move us under the patio where there where empty tables and he said no because they have a reservation coming in 30 minutes. So he rearranged us at the edge of the patio that leaked with the rain and has no side covers!!!This manger was more worried about the customers that where not even here yet than us! Never ever will I go back. Besides the horrible customer service we received from the manager it is the smallest I have ever been to! Very disappointed because we eat at BJ's very often. The only thing good was our waiter sorry I didn't get his name wish I had. He tried to make the best of the situation, very attentive and willing to help with whatever he could! We received better customer service at the McDonald's we ended up after because my children were still hungry."
Chesty P.,"Escondido, CA",0,9,,5.0,12/10/2016,"Service is amazing, atmosphere is great. Food is a little on the expensive side but it is totally worth it"
Martha I.,"Rancho Bernardo, San Diego, CA",3,12,4,4.0,10/18/2016,Service was great. Mahi tacos and seared ahi tasty. Crispy chicken salad would be better with mixed greens rather than iceberg lettuce.
Pav B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/4/2016,"Person at the front who took our to go order was nice. It was crowded, there were two seats at the bar and we wanted to get a drink while we waited for food. The bartender rudely shoo'ed us away. (Why have chairs there?) Food comes and they got the order wrong. I was excited for the food and ended up with bad hospitality and the wrong food. Meh"
Ara Celia M.,"San Diego, CA",70,13,13,5.0,10/1/2016,"went to the soft opening, and honestly, haven't been to the bj's here in la jolla since my ucsd days (almost 10 years ago). love the look of it, and the outdoor seating area. service was great! kayla & nick were our servers and they were amazing! we tried a little of everything and nothing disappointed. we had calamari & the potato skins for appetizers, yum! my hubby tried the the vanilla cream soda and my sis got the orange cream soda. for entrees, i got the santa fe salad; my hubby got the cherry  chipotle glazed salmon; bro-in-law got the hickory brisket & bacon loaded burger (it was huge!), and sis got the shrimp & arugula pita tacos. soooo stuffed! from what we experienced tonight, they are definitely ready for the grand opening! can't wait to go there again & grab pizza this time."
AMY G.,"San Diego, CA",1,13,,4.0,10/6/2016,Went here the first day they opened and was very pleased. The service was attentive and the food was great. We ordered the avocado rolls as an appetizer and the ziti for dinner. Delicious!
