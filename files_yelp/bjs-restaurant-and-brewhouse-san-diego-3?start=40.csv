Mili P.,"La Jolla, San Diego, CA",520,63,60,4.0,5/2/2017,"I'm so happy BJ's opened again in La Jolla - due to renovations they closed down for a bit but recently opened up again in the same complex. Despite being in the same complex, this BJ's is notably more spacious and inviting than its previous location. The aesthetic appeal has gone up and they've introduced a wide variety of happy hour deals to the menu. In addition to the happy hour deals, there are special weekday deals from Mon-Thu which mitigate the price significantly. I'm surprised that the clientele is generally families and older patrons. I expected there to be more UCSD students, since the location is walking distance from the campus, but the $$ is unlikely to be a regular on a college student budget.  All the pizookies cater perfectly to my sweet tooth. On occasion we come here after dinner solely for the pizookies, which are reasonably priced for a satisfying dessert."
Angie A.,"San Diego, CA",23,58,23,4.0,4/27/2017,"Been in here for happy hour perhaps 8-10 times in the past few months. The happy hour prices are good, the bar is nice, even though they have a frustrating habit of changing the TV in the middle of a game. I normally get a beer and a mini-pizza since they're on special. Staff is good about suggesting a good beer or blend. Pizza itself is hit and miss. Obviously I like it enough to come back."
Queen M.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",1,9,8,2.0,3/12/2017,"Im disappointed that this most restaurants are unaware of the environmental impact of serving straws that NO ONE orders!  It's plastic! It ends up in our oceans ! It's so wasteful and an unnecessary item that if you were asked if you need a straw, most people would say no! Wake up people and tell your server - NO STRAW!"
Siobhan A.,"Redwood City, CA",2,14,4,5.0,10/12/2017,Stopped by last night for their $3 pizookie deal and left happy and full. I ordered the cookies and cream pizookie thinking that it might be too sweet but I was pleasantly surprised as the cookie and ice cream complimented each other nicely without being too sweet. The cookies and cream mousse on top was good but kind of unnecessary in my opinion so I left most of that on the side. But overall I would recommend to anyone craving some affordable dessert!
Rachel L.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,2.0,12/8/2017,"I realized that BJ's is a chain restaurant but I've heard good things about it. However, after my first time, I was left really unimpressed.  I initially noticed how pricey the menu was but I put that aside in my mind because I figured, ""the food must be some good stuff!"" Nah. Food is OK. My friend said it best, ""Yup that pasta... taste like pasta."" Bottom line, it's edible and nothing special. Some of the dishes lacked any sort of flavor at all.  Portion sizes were also not a big as I expected them to be considering how expensive the entrees were. Spent about 60$ of OK food to fill just two people and a smidge of leftovers. Yikes.  My server was nice though so I'm giving a star for that. I'm a server myself and I could tell that he was going out of his way to be friendly and accommodating.  I really think I missed the hype here. But that's just me, and I'm kind of exhausted by these weirdly overpriced ""high-end"" American restaurant joints. I won't return, unless it's strictly for pizookis I guess."
Hubert H.,"Cambridge, MA",30,601,,5.0,8/1/2017,"So so so so so happy that this place opened until 1a and actually served food until 1a! I ordered an elegant salad, made of goat cheese, arugula or some other mixed green, and cranberries, with sliver of almonds. The chips and fish wasn't so good - too much deep-fried batter, not enough fish, and the fries were a bit ordinary, like something you might get at a fast food joint. Thank you for having your kitchen open at a late hour!!! Menu is a bit convoluted and dense, but it's probably worth it, as it seems to cater to those who just want bar food and those who are looking for healthier options."
Richard K.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1,21,6,5.0,7/17/2017,"Picking up a to go order from this restaurant. Service to place the order was great, even at light night hours. Server even gave me a 50%discount. I highly recommend this spot for some good food. For the area, this is one of the few places that serves food till midnight."
Julie F.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,2,1.0,12/21/2017,"Service was not good. They seated me and my son and left us waiting for an extremely long time. I saw them serve 3 other tables that came in after us. Even after I mentioned it to the host, it still took another 10 minutes to take our order. Didn't make us feel welcome at all, not coming here anymore."
Yesenia C.,"San Diego, CA",671,235,106,5.0,7/27/2017,"I've been going to Bj's for a while and so when they opened this one up I was very excited.  I'm the beginning I was not impressed the food wasn't consistent and the service was hit or miss but then they got a new GM, Rodney and noticed a HUGE difference in service and food quality!  I love how close this BJ's is to my house and they have a incredible patio with so many TV's so it's great for game nights! PLUS they have a great enlighten menu too!  I must also say that Sean is one of the BEST servers I've had, not just in Bj's but any restaurant I've been too!  They have a call ahead option too which really saves time on the weekends!"
Crystal P.,"San Clemente, CA",46,55,5,5.0,10/23/2017,I came here with my 2 kids after a long day at sea world. The staff was very accommodating even allowing us to change our table 3 different times . Our food was excellent as always (medium deep dish pizza and avocado egg rolls) and when my toddler began to lose his little baby mind and we had to rush out our waitress was excellent and hurried to get us a to go box and the check. All around great experience with the restaurant itself... it was another story with my little ones though lol.
Rufas J.,"San Diego, CA",0,33,30,3.0,11/4/2017,"Service was slow, but we like the food for a chain. Ahi Tuna salad was great. Their fries and chicken tenders food for kids, but a lotta breading in the chicken. Beer on tap was great. Good kid friendly place, but tons of college kids."
Sonya R.,"San Diego, CA",479,56,57,1.0,7/20/2017,"I should not have tried this place again. Service is worse than last time and they forgot our jalapeños in our jalapeño burger. Their servers suck and I will officially never come back here again. (Came here 3 times every time thinking service would be better and failed us all three times). I'm completely disappointed in BJ's today. We came in at 11:00pm, hoping to grab some food and drinks. The server never came by even though we grabbed three different people to try to order the food. We finally got to order two beers after 40 mins of getting seated, but all we could do was stare at the beer that was already out but no server to deliver. This was not a busy day, and the servers should have been able to be attentive but by the time she came by, she said ""I need to close someone else's tap so can you please wait a little more"", in which I responded, we've been waiting here far more than 20 mins now. She still chose to walk away from our table. Eventually another guy server came by trying to cover up the situation. Finally the server that was assigned to our table came by but brought out a dirty plate with chocolates on it... great. Then I thought my wait was over when the food came out, but they got our orders wrong. At this point I called the manager Lileanna over where she so fakely apologized that I decided to give up. Yeah I gave up on this restaurant. Probably never coming by again, unless if I'm ready to wait an hour for our food. Checked in at 11pm, our food is partially out at 12:07am..."
Sang P.,"San Diego, CA",491,572,116,3.0,12/16/2016,"Okay, no shame but when I heard they had a BOGO deal, I had to come! Their menu has changed since the last time I came here (2012), when it was much smaller. The new location is nice, the interior is very modern, and it makes me want to drink and eat a lot, which is a huge plus! They also have a bigger beer selection than before. I ordered the Jambalaya with Fettucine instead of rice..and I was very disappointed. The dish was overly salty and the noodles tasted very bland. I tried mixing it more, but it didn't help much. Service was very friendly. I'm sure this place has good food. I'm going to try and order something else next time. Thanks!"
Mai H.,"Clairemont, San Diego, CA",64,52,66,3.0,7/19/2017,"Compared to the previous location which was across the parking lot - you get a lot more room, seating area and patio space. However customer service is not the greatest and the food is so/so. I'm not entirely sure if the staff are all new but when we first dined within the first month of opening - our waiter/server wasn't familiar with the menu and had to flag another member to help her with our order. We received our food, and asked if we wanted any condiments which we said yes. By the time our meal was done, condiments came out....  Since then, we occasionally order to go and you have to double check because they always forget something! It's a hit/miss restaurant."
Kristine T.,"San Diego, CA",83,603,431,4.0,10/21/2016,"We are avid BJ's lovers and were very sad when the La Jolla one closed but the new location just opened! We came when it was just three weeks new so it is definitely understandable that the staff were still getting the hang out it.  Location is great. Replaced the old TGI Fridays and is across from the old BJ's (now new Nordstroms Rack). The restaurant is smaller but nice and clean. Reminds me of the one in North County. Parking can be a bit cumbersome during busy business hours.  Upon arrival, the hostess told us that we would be seated in a few minutes. However, she did not ask us if we wanted to sit inside or outside...she just put us outside. The waiters that came to our table were very ""fresh"". I don't remember his name but he stumbled a lot on his words and seemed very confused. Another one had brought our food and he just stuck both in the middle and did not say a word. Again, it's still new so understandable that they needed to get the hang of things.  We went with our usual meat lovers pizza and the crispy chicken salad. Both still very good at this location. Thank goodness the cooks are well trained!  We are so happy we have a BJ's close to home now. Will definitely be back!!"
Rochelle L.,"Imperial Beach, CA",40,3,,5.0,11/8/2017,"I ordered the guacamole bacon burger and it did not live up to the expectations that I have heard. Sloppily made and not cooked to order. However, my server Marissa was very apologetic and understanding. Although I was not too happy with the food I still left with a smile due to the excellent service by Marissa. Don't know if I would go back for the food but I would definitely go back if marissa was able to be my server again."
Jay C.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,572,9,2.0,5/15/2017,"What a mistake we made dropping by for lunch.  Simply put, the food is awful here.  We both got salads and my lord how do you screw a salad up that bad?  Even worse was the waiter who felt he could recommend beers, dude had no idea what was what.  Its a pass, big time."
Daniel G.,"San Diego, CA",254,118,98,5.0,10/26/2016,"FINALLY a legitimately decent BJ's in this part of town. The old BJ's was old, dark, and rundown. This spot is perfect to watch the game, get a few brews, order a pizza, and get together with friends. There's plenty of space and easy seating, for now until people realize it exists. They have NFL Sunday Ticket, and the food options range from bar food to salads and even pretty decent entrees. We got and really recommend:  BJs Favorite Pizza Seared Ahi Tuna Salad BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad Santa Fe Salad Every Beer Chicken strips for the kids were pretty standard. The Garlic Knots were great, but only one comes if you order it as a side. Their side of fruit is a joke and is pretty much 2 grapes cut in half, about 6 blueberries and 1/4 of a strawberry. Otherwise, I recommend this location without hesitation."
Linh V.,"San Jose, CA",365,187,2465,3.0,10/28/2016,"How can I contain my excitement when pizookies are now a 5 minute drive from me?! I have always been a fan of BJ's, and this location is perfect. It's on the corner, has a decently spacious outdoor seating area, and It's across from the new Nordstrom Rack. I came here last weekend for a birthday dinner. My friend called weeks in advance and booked a reservation for a large party (20 people). When we arrived, the hostess said they didn't take reservations on Saturdays and told us we had to wait 1.5 hours to get seated. She gave us a hard time until we talked to the specific worker who booked the reservation. They finally sat us down after 30 minutes or so. The waitress, however, did a great job managing a large party and even separated checks for us! Overall, my experience would have been great if it weren't for hostess' horrible attitude. Luckily the pizookie trio made up for it!"
Shrimpie J.,"Montecito, CA",18,5,,1.0,5/7/2017,"Coming to the restaurant with a reservation, I had expected some sort of service but last weekend we got absolutely none! Upon being seated by the hostess in the patio, we waited patiently for over 40 min until we decided to leave. During that 40 min, our server never once showed up although we had asked the passing by waiters. We didn't even get a glass of water! There was zero acknowledgement of our presence and we had about 16 people.  There were plenty of other parties surround us that received service but due to either lack of staffing or communication, we happened to get none."
