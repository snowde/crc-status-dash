Daniel D.,"Los Angeles, CA",224,58,12,4.0,5/8/2017,"I come here for lunch often since I work in the shopping center, it's always quiet and quick! They have a large menu which is nice because let's be real....who doesn't like options?! They also have nice weekly specials!"
Brad S.,"La Jolla, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/21/2017,"I love this place!!  Tomorrow will be my 4th Sunday in a row to watch NFL.  They open at 10 am, when you arrive you will always be greeted by the host / hostess.  They will ask you which game you want to watch and show you which TV has your game.  The service and food are both a 10 for sure!!  They have HH specials on Sundays and you can earn points towards free food in the future (just download the app, so simple).  I always get the BJ's burger or Mini deep dish pizza, seriously both are really good for about 7 bucks.  Outside patio has TV's and once again the service is excellent as well as the food.  See you tomorrow :-)"
Carol K.,"La Jolla, CA",0,3,1,3.0,7/28/2017,"I've always enjoyed their pizza.  Their service needs some major work.  This was the first time here after reopening.  Great ambiance, food was good, service was not."
MJ A.,"San Diego, CA",2,14,18,4.0,6/2/2017,"This was my first time here since they reopened after relocating and remodeling, but I am so happy they are back!  And I noticed new items on their menu as well, like calamari appetizers.  I actually placed my order online and requested a specific pick-up time. I ordered the calamari appetizer and Asian chopped salad for lunch. I asked for no bell peppers on my salad and was happy they actually did that.  Sometimes places hear you and don't come through with your request.  Overall, my salad was delicious and the calamari was crispy and a great portion size for an appetizer.  I can't wait to come back here again for a sit down meal and try other items on the menu. Also, my order was ready at the time I specified.  That's always a plus in my book especially when you have only so much time to grab lunch. Finally, from when I picked up my order, I noticed they have plenty of seating and a patio dining area.  Now that the parking lot is no longer under construction parking is also ample as well."
Christian D.,"San Diego, CA",52,50,5,4.0,5/13/2017,"Came here for a post-graduation dinner with family. I've been to the old BJ's in the same complex that was good but this newer location in the same shopping center is way nicer. The outside patio area has a huge fire grill thing which is cool.  Ordered a large BJ's favorite deep dish, it was great and more than enough for 5 people. Also ordered their house pale ale Piranha which was great. For starters I had the spinach artichoke dip with chips and for desert we all shared a pizookie which was a great way to end the meal.  Only took us 15 minutes to get our table ready on a Friday night. Great location, good service, and good food. Definitely will recommend and come back."
Joey J.,"El Cajon, CA",4,3,,4.0,10/17/2017,Really like the food beer and staff here.. Its a great place to get tipsy before your movie at AMC.  Steak was on point flight goes for about 6 bucks
Anna G.,"San Diego, CA",5,32,5,4.0,5/31/2017,For a chain restaurant this place is pretty good! Our server was super friendly and they have a HUGE selection of beers.
Jinyoung C.,"Carlsbad, CA",462,224,103,3.0,10/10/2016,"I went to the second night of their re-opening. The patio is very very cold, and I can't imagine how cold it'll get during the winter time. They had way too many waiters and waitresses; even given that it was second night of re-opening. When I was seated, I asked for the happy hour menu. One waitress told me that there is no happy hour, but when a more experienced looking waitress came by, she said that happy hour is only available in the bar area. I went to the bar area, and I was just sitting around for 10-15 minutes before I had to grab some waitress, who was crowded near the entrance along with the other waiters and waitresses. Service was quick, but getting the attention wasn't. My cloth napkin was dirty; it had some weird sticky things on it. The tables were sticky too."
Moon T.,"San Diego, CA",9,92,,4.0,4/7/2017,"So many inexplicable things have happened to me and my friends at this location that I could never, ever fully articulate. Every time I enter this restaurant it's as if I'm in a glorious culinary Twilight Zone. Just incredible. Four stars for the food and constant excitement"
Darlene M.,"Chula Vista, CA",10,1,,5.0,9/6/2017,"Just wanted to say that the people here are very nice and patient. I made a pick up order and didn't pay attention to the time ordered and went to pick it up about 15 min to soon so  the order hadnt yet made it to the restaurant but was greeted by the manager Matt shortly after finding out my mistake  and he quickly jumped right on it and got the kitchen making my food and was so polite and made sure I  was in and out in no time, I will definitely be back to this location again! Thanks everyone!"
Gabriel G.,"San Diego, CA",4,7,1,4.0,8/2/2017,"After a short hiatus writing reviews on Yelp, I decided to log in to give this BJ's location a review. My brother and I came here yesterday, August 1st during the evening. I have been to the other locations around San Diego and this one was by far the best experience I've had. The food was outstanding and came out a timely manner. I came here with my brother and we ordered Green Flash Beer. Then we ordered the Jambalya and Asian chop salad and the mozzarella cheese sticks appetizer to share. Then topped it all off with a classic chocolate chunk pizookie! All great selections, all delicious and everything came out as expected.  Alongside the great food, the service there was spot on. We were greeted promptly and sat down near the cocktail area. Our server Samuel was attentive and made sure he went through some great beer and food recommendations. Regardless of how busy the restaurant was during that night, Samuel made sure we got everything we needed and made sure to check on how everything was going. We made sure to give him a proper tip for making the experience there full circle.  If you're looking for a great beer selection, great food and friendly service, I highly recommend visiting this BJ's location with friends and family. Thinking of dropping by here for lunch during a busy workday!"
KL M.,"San Diego, CA",20,200,58,4.0,2/5/2017,"It's maybe more like 3.5 stars. We were really sad when the previous location across the parking lot closed during the mall remodeling. So we were delighted to see the new location open. The food is as good as ever, but they were still suffering from opening staffing challenges. It took 15 minutes to order and 20 minutes to get water. And then our pizza arrived, followed by the wine, and then my husband's salad 10 minutes later. Hopefully they'll get the logistics ironed out before the next time we show up."
Thomas B.,"La Jolla, CA",698,108,76,5.0,2/5/2017,"What an improvement over the old BJ's! More seating, more TVs, friendly staff. Great new food selections. Choose the Salman with Quinoa bowl. A hit!"
Dena S.,"Chicago, IL",84,7,9,5.0,4/7/2017,"The food and drink were superb. Jonathan was great, super helpful and professional. The strawberry splash is delicious!"
A-Aron S.,"San Diego, CA",12,115,277,4.0,3/18/2017,"Good food and service. Great menu with many different food options. Stopped by here at 1 pm on Saturday. No wait and we were seated immediately. Waitress was nice and friendly and checked on us many times. We ordered wings as an appetizer. I ordered the Hickory Brisquit bacon burger with a side salad. My daughter got eh cheese pizza and lemonade. Food was well prepared and came to the table with enough time to eat the appraisers and salad. I really wanted to order the jambalaya but was not ready to invest the $18.5 dollars into my lunch. BJ's turned out as expected with a better menu than I remember. I will try them again and maybe after i save up some $$ for the jambalaya, lol."
Senior B.,"San Diego, CA",1,61,75,5.0,2/6/2017,"So it was a rainy Monday afternoon, I didn't feel well. Well I decided to walk in the rain to clear my head. I ended up in front of BJ'S brewhouse. I feel bad because, I was soaking wet! The staff greeted me with a smile! I was seated and my server was Lauren. I told her I wanted something light to eat, and a shot of whiskey! She delivered with quick responses! Everything she recommend was absolutely amazing! I got the shrimp pita tacos! They are amazing and worth walking in the rain for any day! Not to mention her professionalism, knowledge of the menu, and the relaxed and fun vibe was refreshing for someone who works in the industry. I truly appreciated the service and food! You have a new customer. Compliments to the cooks as well!!!!"
k g.,"San Diego, CA",38,40,3,5.0,4/22/2017,This is my new favorite place to come! Great service and the manager Rodney really cares about his customers. If you're trying to eat healthy try the lemon thyme chicken with roasted Brussels sprouts!
Ryan D.,"Chula Vista, CA",299,4,,4.0,6/3/2017,"Came here with a large party (13) on a Friday night, and boy was it packed. Our server was definitely overworking himself waiting three large parties and maybe two other smaller tables. He was a great waiter but he just seemed so overworked that I felt bad for the guy.  The food quite good though! Would come back here again, but the service prevents me from giving 5 stars"
Bailey J.,"Alpine, CA",394,24,,1.0,9/11/2017,"This place has always been a go to for a good meal & some yummy beer. My boyfriend and I had a long day and we were starving so we chose bjs! When we got there and we were seated we were not greeted for 10 mins not even asked if we want some water. Then we decided we wanted to sit by the fire so we moved and it still took another 10 mins or so.. till I decided I was going to ask the host if she could get a waiter to greet us. Good food, but terrible customer service. We spent $57 there and it wasn't worth it!"
Thuy N.,"San Diego, CA",117,54,669,5.0,3/3/2017,"This newly constructed location definitely wowed me and my hubby! Super awesome attentive service, good food, great happy hour deals and great flair! We will for sure come back more often!"
