Roy A.,"San Diego, CA",19,14,,5.0,2/20/2017,"Went there for dinner before LJ Playhouse musical ""Freaky Friday"" (VERY GOOD and funny)  Wife had Asian Chicken Wrap - super tasty, good amount of chicken (I poached some of hers) deceptive amount of food - you get more than it looks.  Ok - I'm more a Neanderthal than Omnivore but the new Lentil soup was really really good. Almost like a mild cup of chili with no meat. But it was lentils. Not greenish or yellow in color - more brownish so the color and thicker texture made me think of ""chillish"" but not spicy - really good. Big cup.  Followed up with Asian Chopped Cob. Big portion and really tasty. Different chicken seasoning but just as good as the wrap the wife had.  Service was excellent and fast.  Ask for one of Megans tables. Her level of service and attentiveness is one of the big reasons you probably chose to eat out in the first place!!! BTW - paying via their app - worked great.  Would return and ask for Megan in a heart beat.  I was actually kinda grumpy with low blood suger at first - but like that Snickers ad on TV , completely transformed way before we left."
Madelle R.,"San Diego, CA",1,22,11,5.0,4/10/2017,"I called to place a togo order @11pm. Marissa? took my order=medium spicy Hawaiian pizza, traditional wings flaps only, Oreo pizzookie w/extra cream, and extra ranch/buffalo. She told me it will be ready in 20 minutes. I got there @11:20pm. I was greeted right away by multiple ppl and by the manager. Download the Bj's app. I received a coupon for $10 off $35. The food was ready when I got there and was asked if I need any utensils. While I was waiting for the lady to pack my food I noticed a poster with week day specials on it. When I got to my car, I checked if my order was correct. It was perfect! The food was warm and delicious when I got home. The whole process from ordering food to enjoying the food at home was on point. I definitely will be back to this Bj's."
Timothy L.,"San Diego, CA",349,542,53,4.0,12/12/2016,Bigger and better location than the original location inside the same plaza. I love the food at BJ's so there was no disappointment here. Pizza is whats good here and it's what I always get.  This location features a very nice outside patio which I really enjoyed. They have great happy hour deals but it's at the bar only. Parking in the plaza can get tough if you come during peak hours.
Tape Hiss ..,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,28,,1.0,9/2/2017,Retarded amount of time for a called-in pick up order. I stood there for over a half hour and it was called in 20 minutes prior to me even coming into the restaurant. The staff kept on helping walk-in customers. I finally gave up and left after a half hour and I didn't even get my money back.  Epic waste of time I can't get back.  Won't return. The staff seems miserable and I don't blame them. BJ's blows.
Jared S.,"San Diego, CA",178,20,11,4.0,5/1/2017,"BJ's is a pretty recognizable restaurant. Their deep dish pizza is great and I love their beers! The Tatonka stout is always a solid choice to pair with dinner. I've had most of their beers and have been getting a little more adventurous and started trying their more experimental ones. The half stout half red was surprisingly good, I'd recommend it! Always served cold and with a fresh head. The buffalo wings are good and make for a solid appetizer. Don't expect anything fancy with the wings, they're pretty standard. For the entree I had the spicy Hawaiian chicken deep dish and that was pretty tasty! The bread had a nice crisp on the outside with a soft and fluffy inside. Cooked to perfection. I also tried the newer monkey bread pizookie, and it was great! I'd recommend it. One of the better monkey breads I've tasted and it's served with ice cream on top!"
Brian E.,"San Diego, CA",24,66,2,4.0,7/16/2017,"I enjoyed the beer I got. I got chicken wings, that were really good. Lots of TV's so you get a good view no matter where you sit. I liked it and I will be back."
San Diego S.,"San Diego, CA",30,16,,1.0,6/22/2017,"Sorry to bother you Mr. Bartender! I figured after counting your tips for 5 minutes, you'd be ready to serve me. Sorry for interrupting!"
Marissa S.,"San Diego, CA",4,45,13,5.0,7/29/2017,Came here for lunch and it was a wonderful experience!! The management was fabulous and very personable! Rodney & Matt were awesome and our server Brandon was fantastic! They were very attentive and the food was great! They also have an amazing Petrus sour beer  Just beware of sitting in the patio June bugs will attack and cause you to make a scene.
Crystal P.,"San Diego, CA",51,130,111,5.0,11/11/2016,5 stars for the patio alone. I LOVE some good patio space and this location delivers just that. It even has the patio table with the firepit/flames. I wonder if it's as hot as the teppenyaki grill that Tori Spelling fell on...anyway. This BJ's is smaller than every location I've ever been to but the bar and patio make up for it. I like that they have a fridge full of beer in case you want to purchase some to take home. Parking is not as horrific as I had anticipated. I have been here a few times since opening and have enjoyed it. I also like their late night happy hour because I can stop by when I get out of class. One pumpkin ale please.
Danny M.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",2,5,1,1.0,10/22/2016,"Forgot to include fries in my chicken club sandwich.  When I called to ask about it I was told ""it should be in there"" And ""I'm sorry that just was our mistake""  Don't ever tip on takeout without checking the bag here."
Marques A.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",89,78,47,5.0,10/16/2016,Food taste great.  Team was very helpful.  Manager came and checked in to ensure we were happy.  Server recommended a certain menu item and asked a few questions to ensure she made a recommendation that I would enjoy.  The open atmosphere of the place is the perfect setting to enjoy the ambiance of the restaurants theme and our California weather.  Everyone in the area should check it out.
Andreas S.,"San Diego, CA",44,14,6,3.0,11/4/2016,"Normally, this would be a 5 star review, but I had a bad experience last visit.  I'm a huge fan of chicken wings (who isn't) and rushed to BJ's during their opening week with all my co-workers.  I ordered the wings with buffalo sauce.  When they arrived, they were drenched in sauce, the chicken fat barely tasted cooked (let alone crispy), and after 3 wings, I felt like I was eating more fat than sauce or meat.  When the server came around to pick up the plate, he didn't say anything when noticing that I didn't eat most of the wings.  I didn't say anything, paid the bill and left feeling disappointed. So, my advice to anyone ordering wings is get them ""naked"" and ask for ""extra crispy"".  I'd suggest that the restaurant manager take a closer look at their process to better render off some of the fat.  Buffalo Wild wings and Dirty Birds do a very good job at it and these days you gotta get your wing game to an A. Otherwise, great place.  I'm going there after work today, matter of fact!"
Melissa D.,"San Diego, CA",1,51,,1.0,9/7/2017,"Horrible, horrible, horrible service! The bartenders need to move faster & take care of all the customers from both sides of the bar & be professional cause that did not happen tonight & I'm terribly upset! The manager had to take my order & it was slow to get my food! Also, I asked to close the side window cause it was cold & a manager named Matt said that they can't cause it blocks the walk way & the people sitting at the bar might get bumped into & I was telling him but it seemed liked he did not care cause I told him I've asked for it to be closed before & there was no problem & I have sat there before when it was closed & have been bumped into so I think he was making excuses & it hurt my feelings & I told him I didn't want my food to get cold but he didn't seem to care! The bartenders are super rude & the manager Matt was not friendly. This is my visit that I wish I didn't make cause it was uncomfortable & I won't be back for a while! I'm disgusted at the service"
Gehre M.,"La Jolla, CA",3,104,3,4.0,5/14/2017,It's very hit or miss in this place. Service is the same. Cab be very crowded during major sporting event and weekdays after work crowd
D V.,"San Diego, CA",7,26,2,1.0,7/8/2017,Service really lacked tonight which made for a bummer of an experience. Asked for two separate things from the server and got nether one. Maybe staff two less hostesses and one more server and things would have been alright. Food was good no complaints. Where has good service gone
Kimberly A.,"La Mesa, CA",1,4,,5.0,1/27/2017,"Just ate there...little too long to wait, but our server was the BEST!  SEAN U ROCK! Food was great and service was outstanding!"
Hugo T.,"Houston, TX",49,2,,1.0,7/27/2017,The service here is the worst ive ever experienced. The server was extremely rude and almost got into a fight with customers at another table. I was amazed and have never experienced such horrible service. I have been here a few times and i will never return.
Katrinka M.,"Chicago, IL",1,28,8,5.0,6/26/2017,"Fun place with good menu selection, especially for kids (lots of choices).  Loved the golden beet & arugula salad, & the root beer glazed ribs.  Rose provided excellent service."
Kelly B.,"San Diego, CA",6,9,,1.0,2/11/2017,"Don't Waste Your Money!!! Terrible service, crowded tables, 30 minute wait for cold and terrible appetizers. I complained to the manager and he hinted a dessert on the house, however sitting in that packed environment forever waiting for anyone to help us or even charge us out was ridiculous. It was beyond stupid. I left bj's with a funky taste, pardon the pun. And anger, perhaps a hint of rage. Never will I return, nor will my American Express. Dumb."
Taniyyus S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,24,10,4.0,6/17/2017,"Met for drinks and dinner at this place. Parking can be tough but location is prime. Cleanliness of the menu was questionable - it was sticky and you had to peel pages. Food was overall good, the cocktails were nice."
