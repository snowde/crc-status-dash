Christine B.,"San Jose, CA",59,125,54,4.0,12/5/2017,"This is your typical chain restaurant/brewery. I've been here for a couple good happy hours and some dinners while out doing errands. The happy hour is a great setup with good options and prices. I believe you can only get it while sitting in the bar, so be sure to ask to be seated there if you want to take advantage of the deals.  I've been here a few times, so the services has varied in its quality. The last time I visited, the server was great. He was attentive, helpful and friendly. But I've also had experiences where the servers have gone missing and I've had to ask other servers for assistance. So I think it really depends on your luck in who is assigned to your table.  The food has always been good. The beer is really good too and there are lots of options. The pizookie is their famous dessert. I had a bite of one the last time I was there. They are VERY good, but the calories are a little scary. They're listed on the menu, so no surprises there! There are lots of TVs, so the sports nut in your party will be happy too."
Kalen K.,"San Jose, CA",128,285,14,2.0,1/3/2018,"BJ's as a chain is really not my favorite spot in general, but the kids love their pazookies and you pretty much know what to expect when you go to one. And this location is right on par. Super slow service and predictably lame execution. Ordered an Iced Tea Lemonade (aka Arnold Palmer, I actually said both just to be extra clear)...got Ice Tea. Asked for no cheese on pizza and extra sauce (because no cheese sort of requires extra sauce to hold it together - which we laughed about with the server) and got no sauce. Pizza wasn't cut through so had to carve it myself, requiring me to ditch that hang in the air stand, which prompted server to come over and check on us. She was very bothered by us not using the pizza stand and actually put the pizza back on the stand. Since she was there, we asked for a side of extra sauce since none was on the pizza. Of course, she never brought it. She did eventually bring our check after we flagged her down. Granted, she was over seated. And she was friendly. The kitchen certainly didn't help her and the host wasn't doing her favors by piling more people in her section. But, like I said, you pretty much know what to expect when you go to a BJ's."
João P.,"San Jose, CA",13,6,5,1.0,12/22/2017,"Pretty bad experience here last night. We got there at around 9:15 to have a quick late dinner. We were only able to leave close to midnight. There was a mix up and they seated us after some people that had arrived there after us. We were seated and placing our order around 10pm. There was yet another mix up in the kitchen, and we only got our food at around 11pm. I had some shrimp pasta and the food was at room temperature and there was hardly any shrimp in it. Also, the restaurant was really cold and we had to keep our jackets on through the whole thing."
Lily L.,"Santa Clara, CA",37,544,2140,2.0,11/11/2017,"Not a big fan of BJ's food. Avocado egg rolls were pretty good with the dipping sauce. The prime rib was over cooked (asked for medium-rare and it came out medium-well). The picture in the menu of the prime rib showed a red piece of meat, but ours was brown. The Caesar salad was bland. The avocado bacon burger was average tasting. The monkey bread pizookie was OK. The vanilla ice cream was good but how can you go wrong with that? The monkey bread was like a hard Cinnabon. BJ has good beers at a reasonable price.  The only real positive note was we had a nice server."
Tushar S.,"San Jose, CA",81,62,174,3.0,11/11/2017,"This location has always provided 4 star service (at least in terms of burger quality), but today was somewhat of a disappointing experience. There was a 45 minute waitlist when we got there but we waited more than an hour until our name was called. I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts for appetizers and the Seared Ahi Salad for my entree.  While our food was good, the general customer service was sub par.  The appetizers came soon, but we had to ask for silverware, twice, while our appetizer waited to be devoured. We were served by three servers (????) and our final server (Cristal) was the best. She was diligent, and checked on us multiple times.  In the end, both dishes tasted pretty good. The sprouts were well baked and nicely seasoned, and the ahi salad was well cooked and dressed. This location has ample parking and both indoor & outdoor seating."
Julie L.,"San Jose, CA",433,54,201,1.0,10/27/2017,"Why doesn't Yelp have the option for zero stars?  When I saw the ratings for this BJ's, I wondered why it was so low. After today, I realize that the rating should probably be worse. My rating of this establishment is based solely on the SERVICE presented by the hostess at 6:30pm today. Please note that I never even had the opportunity to dine before leaving this review. I learned through the grapevine that her name is Elyza? Alyza? She is an Asian female hostess.  I have been wanting a pizzookie all week for some reason (maybe because BJ's was target marketing me on ig). So lo and behold, after a long week of work, I decided to take my mom here to have her first pizzookie. We arrived around 6:30pm, where the hostess (Alyza/Elyza) told me it would be a 10-15 minute wait for two. She took down my name and I told her I'd be outside / around the area. So, I went back to my car to drop off some stuff, went to target to pick up an online order, came back within 10 minutes, and asked for my table. She asked for my name, and then asked, ""Did you get a text?"" I was very confused and told her that she never asked for my number for me to receive a text. She acted flustered/confused (so i'm not sure if she may be new or not), but proceeded to ask me for my name again. I told her, ""Julie. for 2."" To which she responded that she can't find my name in the system ""for some reason."" So she decided to play it off and add me in the system, while telling me it would be 10-15 minutes. Note that this is IN ADDITION to the 10-15 she originally quoted and it was clearly her fault that she did not put my name into the system the first time around.  I'm not sure what kind of system BJ's uses, but I've worked in restaurants before (and have worked as a hostess) and it literally takes a lot to mess something up that is as easy as putting someone's name/party in the system. I'd also like to point out that there weren't many other people waiting for a table at that time. If there were 10+ people waiting outside, I could probably see how that can happen, but when I came to put my name down, there were only 6 people at best.  Spend your money elsewhere."
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA",2026,1460,8032,4.0,9/2/2017,"Always surprised at the low reviews BJ's gets, especially from the Yelp crowd.  I've never had a bad experience and while the wait times can be a little silly at times, the overall experience is normally really good.  Came here yesterday with the family and never actually stepped foot at this location.  It was nice and cool in here and great to deal with the heat wave hitting the Bay.  We were seated almost right away, but missing silverware, which they were ""low"" on.  Kinda weird to be low on silverware? I was able to get what I wanted to eat, which was a menu choice on their old menu. The burger melt is fantastic! Overall, it was a pleasant experience, with great food and drinks.  Thumbs up!"
Tiffany B.,"Oakland, CA",108,158,287,1.0,6/1/2017,"I came here for a quick bite to eat in between appointments and let me tell you it was anything but quick. I ordered the lunch stromboli and fries. By the time I got my food the fries were not fresh out the fryer hot, whatever, I hate complaining. The wrap itself was just ok. Nothing to write home about and nothing to order again. I finish and they ask if I want dessert. Sure why not. It was Tuesday and the pizookie was $3 so I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut.   I literally waited a good 20 minutes before receiving it. I asked for the check as soon as he sat down the cookie. I gave him my card and waited and waited and waited. I got so irritated I just walked up to the front to see the delay. The server made up some bs excuse about the system being down. Thank goodness this isn't my home town BJ's but they better importune they're service big time. The service was so bad I could've bring myself to tip."
Ronnie B.,"San Jose, CA",0,62,,1.0,11/13/2017,"""Shitty food, Shitty service"" should be the catch phrase to this place.  I took my parents and kids here for a bite to eat to take advantage of the veteran deal( What a joke that was$12.95 off). So we were seated within 10 mins of entering the building. But, or waiter was clearly not giving us the same attention she gave other tables. Took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks. Then after we ordered she messed up the special request I ask for the kids meal. So the kids no longer wanted to eat. I ask for extra sauce for my meal and by the time she brought it I was almost done eating my nasty meal which had no flavor.  I Don't think ill be going back anytime soon."
Kait P.,"San Jose, CA",89,176,105,4.0,9/30/2017,Came here with a girl friend for an early dinner and had great service and food! I think I prefer this one over the one at Oakridge but both are really good. We were seated within five minutes of our arrival and had a nice booth. Our waitress was really nice and quick with our order. Food is always good and naturally we ordered a pazookie after! Definitely will return
Victoria N.,"San Jose, CA",144,168,154,4.0,10/25/2017,"First time that I've been to the BJ's here since they opened up several years ago. Came for a friend's birthday and we had a party of 7 on a Thursday night after 7pm. We really liked our server, she made conversation and she was also funny. She was a true believer in servers making some kind of conversation with their tables or else, you'd be a boring server. All of our food came out at roughly the same time and there wasn't too much complaint for the food except there was a lot of oil in some of my table's pasta. My chicken Alfredo could have used more salt/seasoning though, but there was no trace of oil, thank god :) Drinks weren't too bad, the white peach that my bf had was quite sweet. BUT you could taste the tequila :) Also, they ran out of bread and the servers that brought out our food didn't advise us, we had to ask our server who explained more should be coming out and they probably ran out. Would have been nice to know when our food was brought out instead of pointing out that only one person had bread and 4 others didn't. Additionally, our server failed to notice that we didn't have utensils and still didn't realize this when our food was served. We had to flag her down and she came back with utensils for us, two trips. My plate was the only one who had utensils, but it was a spoon.. for pasta... Other than the missing utensils and waiting around for them, the atmosphere was loud and casual. Great company with friends, we got lucky with our server and surprisingly, the food wasn't all that bad and came out at the same time.  Best part of the night was their trio pizcookies! I recommend the oreo one, this tastes a lot more like chocolate, but I didn't mind. Delicious, but 3 is probably not enough for a group of 7, probably 4 if you aren't all that stuffed. Plenty of parking in this plaza as well."
Melissa L.,"Portland, OR",1459,1043,788,2.0,2/7/2017,"I've given this place 2 tries and I'm done.   Located in a strip mall with a Target, parking can be a challenge in this lot. The first time I visited, I tried the Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken.  A bit on the dry side, but glad to see they have a selection of Low-Calorie Entrees.  My issue that evening was the service.  Could not get refills because server never returned once our food was brought out.  In fact, I had to go to other servers to track down our server so that we could get the check to leave. Returned for a second visit, thinking that maybe that was just a fluke.  Nope.  This time around the service was better, but the food was worse.  Tried the BJ's Tavern Cut Pizza.  It looked nothing like the pictures.  Something as simple as spreading the ingredients wasn't done.  There were clumps of meat slices.  In addition, one member of our party ordered the standard deep dish and it came out very greasy.   This BJ's is disappointing."
Rupa S.,"Malvern, PA",140,227,98,3.0,8/10/2017,The food here is kinda ok-ish not the best. Their spinach artichoke dip is good but didn't like anything else.  Definitely try their pizookie though - absolutely amazing.
Steph F.,"Milpitas, CA",826,720,1407,1.0,7/21/2017,"If you have time waste, go ahead and come here. Otherwise, stay clear!  I don't remember the last time I've been to a BJ's but my visit today reminded me why I've stayed away for so long!  This place has SLOW service! I think it took 30 minutes before our salads came and then another 15+ minutes until our entrees came. Overall, our group lunch (party of 7 people) took about 2 hours. The restaurant wasn't even busy to begin with!  Their menu is extensive but nothing really stands out - think of Cheesecake Factory menu size. Food here is a bit on the pricey side for the quality of food you are getting. They do have lunch specials towards the back of the menu if you're looking for something less pricey.  Since I couldn't decide what to order, I just opted for their lunch special (unlimited) soup and salad which was a little under $10. I got the mozzarella tomato salad and a bowl of the clam chowder. The salad was okay but on the small side compared to what I would have gotten if I ordered a different salad. The clam chowder tasted like something that came from a can. Even if I were to ask for another salad or soup, I think the wait would be ridiculously long so I didn't ask for another round, not like I had the chance to anyways since our server never came back. Their only somewhat redeeming factor was that it was FREE pazookie day! According to their website, each table was limited to one free order. We ordered a classic chocolate chip pazookie and the new churro pazookie. This took another 30 minutes so maybe put your order in ahead of time if you know you're gonna want dessert. The wait time was still ridiculous but I'm hoping that meant it was because they're freshly made.  The table behind us ordered their pazookie after us yet received it before us so we were suspicious that they mistaking given our order to them instead. When we finally received our pazookies, we were surprised to receive an extra churro pazookie due to their mistake. The chocolate chip cookie one was way too sweet and overwhelming but the churro one was actually pretty good. They had a stack of mini churros topped with ice cream. In the end, our server comped all 3 pazookies but that didn't make up for the rediculous wait times for our food. If this wasn't a special work lunch, I don't think I would have made it to work on time during my normal lunch hours.  Stay clear of this place if you can. Not even the pazookies are good enough for me to want to come back here. Besides, there are many other food options available here at the Coleman Market Center."
Alicia Marie P.,"San Jose, CA",216,226,82,1.0,1/26/2017,"Well. Thought enough time had passed and I'd try again. Again, terrible.  The funniest part tho was my wings. Clearly says ""sauce on side"". Of course, there's sauce on them. And the lady goes ""oh. So like. You actually wanted the sauce on the side? We didn't know. I guess they can remake them if you want to wait""  Like honestly. Wtf  so bad it's funny"
Kimberly R.,"San Jose, CA",18,2,,1.0,12/18/2017,"If I were homeless perhaps the food would be okay.  The worst food ever, Taco Bell , McDonald's, would be better.  $12.00 Superior top shelf Margarita, tasted bitter, no alcohol, not a tang of sweet and sour.  Sadness. Christmas party sadness.  Ugh."
Tram N.,"San Jose, CA",631,2358,9298,1.0,7/2/2017,Extremely slow service and it's slow.  I am sitting here waiting for my check to come out. We waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to come to our table.  I regret ordering the Ghirardelli Pizookie because it was dry. The brownie was hard as a rock. I don't think you should be charging anyone anything for that kind of dessert.  I want my calories and money back.  N.E.V.E.R. A.G.A.I.N.
Archana R.,"San Jose, CA",129,171,322,2.0,11/5/2017,"Strictly for a takeout order: Did a takeout order online and requested the dish to be without meat. When I got to the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised that my food was ready. I asked to check the item to make sure it didn't have meat but to my disappointment, it did. The lady seemed surprised and offered to take it back. She said the manager was making a new one and it would be a few minutes. She then proceeded to charge me for the dish, which I was shocked it would be the same price even though I requested no meat. Not to mention the screw up with the food. The food itself was bland to taste. Had to season it myself.  I've never done takeout at BJs and I hardly eat here anymore but I'll likely not do takeout from here again. Got skimped on the breadstick too!"
Alisher K.,"Mountain View, CA",47,35,62,5.0,8/31/2017,"The staff, hostess and the rest of the BJ's crew are the best!!! I don't get any of the negative reviews. It took them 15 min max from the moment we were seated to take the order, cook it and serve it at our table. Great attitude, friendly behavior and good manners. Definitely 5 star experience"
Michelle T.,"San Jose, CA",1,32,,3.0,12/22/2017,"I came here with a group of 12 and it took awhile for the server to come take our orders and had to flag other servers down throughout our stay. I got the chicken club sandwich and it wasn't the best sandwich that I have eaten. The chicken was a bit dry and the sandwich kept falling apart. The fries were just fries. One of my friends ordered sweet potato sides to sub her regular fries, but they gave her regular fries instead. She let the waiter know, but it took a long while to get the correct fries. We had to ask for water refills a couple times and were checked on 1-2 times through the 2.5 hrs we were there. After our main meal, we decided to order pizookies because they are $3 on Tuesdays. I got the peanut butter one, which wasn't all that great and tasted basic. My friends got the triple chocolate, salted caramel, and monkey bread (most popular) which all tasted much better."
Vanessa M.,"San Jose, CA",8,2,,1.0,12/27/2017,"SHITTY service SHITTY food and SHITTY WATER WAITED 40 min for our forks water was from the sink, COLD BURGERS,  and crusty fries, burger gave my friend food poisoning, BAD customer service waiter forgot our drinks, and didn't understand that I wanted a cookies in cream pizookie regular size even after I told him a million times. Don't come here at night because all the waiters are sleepy AF!!!"
Robert W.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",5,2,,2.0,9/27/2017,"This restaurant has a problem.I feel it is very bad management.We went to this BJ's for dinner as we had just flew in from Florida for a. Vacation .There was a football game on and the bar area was full.We did not want to sit in the bar and were told we would be put on a waiting list for a table,other people were now coming in and were told the same.I asked why  we were not being seated and we're informed that we would not be seated  until 5:30.They had no help scheduled til than!  15-20 people had to wait with more coming in!Why would they not stagger their schedules just in  case such a situation occurred.The employees came in  at 5:30 and were under such pressure to wait on the customers,not a good situation .   After reading other reviews of this restaurant  you better react now. Bad for the Corporate image."
Court S.,"East Bay, CA",929,871,1775,2.0,6/4/2017,"This location is closer to home but I prefer the Cupertino one in terms of service and food quality (the only downside is horrible parking). Every time I come here there is either no silverware on the table, no napkins, empty dinner dishes left on our table as dessert is being served, absent minded waitstaff, etc. Last night our pizookies were rock hard, cold and we had to order freshly baked ones. The time before the ice cream was melted and we were told that the freezer was broken. Really though?  I'll still continue to come here, but know to expect some sort of snafu."
Kalani S.,"San Jose, CA",2,25,140,4.0,6/8/2017,Ok. I have been to this BJ location few times. And there are pro and con at this BJ location. 1) Food: the Food serving is more of a continental style....what it mean it have litter of everything... From Thai style avocado egg roll to Hawaiian poke and Texas style rack of ribs. A) the taste is good for the price you paid B) service is ok. And it really depend on the day and the time of the day C) it's an family style and social style restaurant .  2) environment is up beat and drinks are good with lots of selections 3) Pro: it have great long business hour. Con: they don't take reservation for parties of two... weird only this location don't allow reservation for 2 people. Overall great place to hang out...
Sallie H.,"San Jose, CA",4,1,,1.0,12/19/2017,We were a party of 7 and we got in at 6:30pm. We were told 40 minutes wait. At 8:30pm we were still waiting to be seated. I don't know why they cannot put 2 tables together. This place is absolutely ridiculous! They should not let their customers wait this long. Finally we were seated at a booth which can seat 4 people comfortably but not 7. I asked if they can put a table next to it but they don't have a table. I asked to speak with the manager and he came right away. I asked him if he thinks all 7 of us will be comfy eating dinner while we were squeezed like sardines. Suddenly a table materialized to accommodate all of us. No silverware and napkins. I had to request to get them so we can eat the appetizers. Never ever going to this place again! Worst place!
Makenzi B.,"Santa Clara, CA",31,88,89,3.0,5/12/2017,"Slowest. Service. Every. Single. Time. Why?!?!  I usually enjoy the food and I love that they have a wide menu. I liked their deep dish pizza, portables mushroom burger, tomato bisque soup...and Pizookies? Yes, please! Salted caramel & Oreo are my favorites.  But seriously, service always seems slow and unresponsive. Some servers aren't as interested as others.  For example, last week we had a server and halfway through our meal she went on break. The server that filled in for her came to our table to drop off our check and one of us asked for a refill, he took her cup and jetted off all fast and never asked any of us if we wanted one too? We would have asked ourselves but we didn't even get the chance! Oh, and piles of dishes were still left on our table. Even appetizer plates.  Our dessert came out to the table with still, appetizer plates, dinner plates, and side plates stacked up all over our table. Seriously?"
Abubaker D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,,5.0,12/17/2017,"Manager Daniel is cool and always tries to work through situations that take time with a good attitude. I learned from that. I went here while visiting my grandma. I took out the eldery ladies here for a bite and they enjoyed the food, atmosohere and scene.  Will hopefully stop by again when possible."
Lynne Marie Raguindin B.,"Los Gatos, CA",51,542,578,4.0,6/4/2017,It is way less crowded here than the airport. We opted to sit in the bar . Waited for about 10 min and no one came to us so we decided to sit at the bar top. Service was eh. We kept having to ask for refills where our food was. It has been a while since I have been to this restaurant. The wings were prepared different from how I was used to. My husband said his sandwich was amazing. Lots of patio seating. I will defiantly come here over the Oakridge one.
Melissa M.,"San Francisco, CA",69,13,3,1.0,11/25/2017,"We put our name on the waiting list and was told 10-15minutes for a table. Thirty minutes later I walk in and ask the hostess with drawn on black eyebrows and dark lipstick how much longer for our party of 5 and she tells me we're next. Shortly after a party 8 is called and then I ask my bf to go in and ask again, this same girl tells him there's a party of 5 ahead of us. How does that make any sense!?!? So I walk in and tell her--you told me one thing and him another, what's the deal? She had no explanation so we literally just walked out. Headed to Red Robin! Horrible customer service. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Anita L.,"Union City, CA",347,627,385,2.0,3/26/2017,"Came here for a brunch meeting in the late morning. We were served family style with some options pre-chosen for us. It was the weirdest combination that I've ever had - breakfast pizza, salad, french fries, and a deli sandwich. While the breakfast pizza was actually pretty tasty, the rest of the food was pretty basic. The deli sandwich in particular was kinda gross - I think I could have gotten a better sandwich from the prepackaged section at the grocery store. I also ordered an iced coffee which came out tasty kinda watered down and not nearly as strong as I expected it to be.  While the staff was friendly enough, overall the food experience here left me wanting for more. I wouldn't choose to come back to this location."
Veronica S.,"San Jose, CA",6,93,6,4.0,11/23/2016,"Date night with the hubster brought us to BJs for their 2 for $25, and I must say it's a nice bang for the buck! I got the chicken tortilla soup and it was a bit salty, the broccoli cheddar my hubby got was better. Deep dish was yumm and the monkey bread pizooki was bomb! Nice service, 5 min wait to get seated and 10 there after for food over all, not a bad experience!"
Cynthia L.,"Santa Clara, CA",435,155,174,3.0,8/24/2017,Came here with a friend while waiting to kill some time. We were happy to find out that it was happy hour. Standard BJ's experience except we waited on utensils for a while. Also finished our drinks and it took 10+ minutes to flag down a server to get another drink. Then it took another 10 minutes to find the server again to get our check. Still a 3-star review because I always enjoy the food + beer at BJ's. This one just seems a bit disorganized.
Cc F.,"San Jose, CA",352,16,,5.0,12/11/2017,"I've been meaning to write this review. My family came here a year ago after my mom's graduation. There were a few hiccups with some of the orders and a few plates came out cold. I was frustrated and asked to speak with a manager. Fredrick Greenleaf came and apologized to our table. He did a fantastic job of offering solutions and going above and beyond with the customer service. Even after the ice cream machine went down, he sent his employee across the street to target to buy ice cream so that we could still enjoy our pazookie. Talk about customer service! If this guy is still working there he deserves a raise and a high five. Will definetely be coming back here."
Sonam K.,"San Jose, CA",33,41,137,2.0,2/11/2017,"It's kinda like a knock-off of Cheesecake Factory, with a sports-bar feel. Came here on a game-night and it was pretty full with a wait.  The food is pretty average (definitely sub-par to Cheesecake). We got appetizers and dessert and skipped the main course entirely. We were stuffed by the end.  Our waiter was very pleasant. But the service is a bit slow - we could see he was running in circles. Ambiance is casual and sporty. Pizookie didn't live up to my expectations."
Clay C.,"San Jose, CA",64,46,44,4.0,3/12/2017,"I haven't been here in ages, but it was Pizzookie time! What I ordered: The bbq brisket and bacon burger with fries and a PM Porter. The burger on first taste was packed with bbq flavor and very over powering sauce. But then, the brisket flavor kicked in and it was very savory. The fries were very nicely battered and crispy as well. The PM Porter was my favorite part and was smooth and very chocolately. We also ordered the salted caramel Pizookie which was amazing, but definitely does have a very salty taste! Be prepared haha! Dislikes: I liked our server, but she was very short with my girlfriend and I. Tips: While you wait at this location you can go to Target or other stores around the area. Also they will text you when your table is ready!"
Rosh M.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,1.0,8/25/2017,"If you wanna wait 15 minutes to be approached by a server at your table, 45 minutes for water, another 30 minutes to order food on top of 30 minutes to wait for said food, and an additional 40 minutes for the check... be my guest.  I can't even blame the servers cause they've got a lot to do and they're human; I get it. I blame the management for not setting their team up for success and I hope this BJs reputation can be salvaged -- until then, won't be patronizing here and do not recommend to anyone.  Food's whatever, too. Not worth the time or money."
Bjorn R.,"Santa Clara, CA",136,206,4345,5.0,9/24/2016,"I can only speak of the bar area because that is practically where my wife and I sit when we eat/drink there. First, great wide selection of beers on tap! Second, friendly bartenders...you don't have to wait too long for a cold one. And third, they have a freaking huge television for times you run out of things to talk and just want to watch! Beer, great service, and huge tv...what more does a guy need right?!?   Guinness on tap is my favorite, and I usually get the proper way of pouring it in a glass...I like the reverse happy hour from 10-close M thru F. As good is concern, it is a bit pricy and a hit or miss. However, overall my wife and I love going here just to chill and relax and have drinks!"
Amanda N.,"Santa Clara, CA",222,328,568,4.0,9/4/2016,"Had my birthday dinner here with family and the service here was great w/ our server (Matt?) positive attitude and great service all around.  Came on a Tuesday evening and it wasn't too busy. Ordered the buffalo wings, great white mini pizza, and the ahi tuna salad. Buffalo wings had the right amount of sauce and the great white pizza will always be my favorite. The ahi tuna was still good but the ahi tuna is a little smaller.  Pazookie chocolate chip on the house for your bday! I could seriously come here just for the dessert. The only restaurant I would want to save room for dessert."
Dee K.,"Cupertino, CA",80,12,,1.0,8/16/2017,"Every time I visit this specific location, I always seem to have a bad experience. I visited other locations have never had any problems.  Let's start with the servers, extremely inconsiderate, will get you your utensils once the food is completely cold!  I got chicken thyme plate and could barley bite into my chicken, of course it was taken off my bill. Seriously? I wasted 30 mins to be seated another 30 mins to get my food and another 10 mins to get my utensils, just to bite into food that wasn't even cooked or prepared right. RIDICULOUS.  Please avoid going to this location! Terrible management."
