Gaby K.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,3,5.0,12/29/2016,From the past experiences that we have had here I totally understand why the rating is so low.  Tonight my family and I were looking for place to eat dinner while out shopping and BJ's seamed the best choice in the area despite the past bad experiences that we have had here.  TODAY it was totally different!! Our waitress Vicki was AWESOME!! She went above and beyond to make sure that the kids were well attended to as well as my husband and I.  I am defiantly coming back because of her and I will be requesting her in the future!! The hostess was also very nice and very accommodating.  Really am glad we had dinner there tonight.
Kayleigh C.,"San Jose, CA",1,17,3,5.0,10/14/2016,"We come here all the time and we (my husband and I) love it here! Courtney is our favorite server/bartender. She obviously loves her job and provides great customer service! The food is always on point and the drinks are always delicious. I definitely recommend the ""Double berry"" for anyone looking for a sweet cider drink. my husband will recommend a Jeremiah Red for those who prefer beer. Courtney is the reason we continue to come back."
Jess H.,"Cupertino, CA",6,22,7,1.0,2/20/2016,"We came here for a family line dinner. The wait was about 45 minutes for a large party, which isn't too bad on a Friday night. We were able to snag a couple tables at the bar and drink until we were seated at our table. Let's just say the bar had better service than our actual table did.  Took 30 minutes for our waiter to even introduce herself to us & I had to wave her down. Didn't provide us utensils or water at all and left. Took another 30 minutes to wave down the waitress to even take our order - fine whatever. The waitress and waiter switched shifts, she went on break and I thought ""oh thank god, better service."" Nope. He was no where to be found for a long period of time. Our food finally came, it was cold - of course.  Took another 30 minutes for him to give us our bill to pay and I had to walk up to him to ask for it. He responded he was getting it ready. No clearly you've been standing around not doing your job otherwise something as easy as printing our bill would've taken 10-15 minutes max.  We spent more time waiting on our waitress/waiter  the whole time we were there than eating and drinking. Never coming back to this BJ's ever in my life."
Isabella I.,"Las Vegas, NV",556,83,29,4.0,5/30/2015,"I am always a fan of BJ's. They have delicious gluten free pizza and pizookies! Yum! I also really like their cider, especially the berry.  My one criticism is that this place is insanely busy, and if it's busy while you are there the service can really suffer. Most of the time the servers are nice and good at their jobs."
Cherie C.,"Livermore, CA",1,29,25,5.0,12/23/2016,"Service started off horrible with being seated, and then completely ignored for 20minutes. But then my husband went up to the seating desk and asked if there was someone that could take care of us. Courtney came to our rescue! She was the bomb! Quick as lightning, polite, and knows her stuff! Kind of hard with such a big holiday crowd. She brought out our food, drinks quick and it was right. She made our trip worthwhile and is the reason we will be back. We have choices on where to spend our $$  and would feel great coming back as long as we get Courtneys type of service. The food ended up being just ok, but were willing to try again."
Aaron M.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,1,1.0,12/1/2016,So we ordered to a pizookie to go for curbside pickup. The lady who answered the curbside phone said she would check on it but hung up. 10 mins later we call back to have them check on it again and they tell us we have to go in and pick it up also there wasn't any parking in the curbside spot. So we get our pizookie and it looks like a piece of dog shit that's been stepped on. It's not even the size of a pizookie or a mini. We get charged for a mini but it's still not even the size of the mini. Not worth the wait or 5 bucks.
Jasmine G.,"San Jose, CA",255,301,55,3.0,7/20/2015,"I really love BJ's food. I've had a lot of different things from their menu including their burgers, pizzas, wings, pizza dip, calamari, crusted chicken, sandwiches, and pizookie. I recommend all of those things and wouldn't say I have a favorite, I just order depending on what I feel like eating that day. I also really enjoy their happy hour menu and the hours in which they operate. Sometimes I'll randomly end up here because it's the only place open late on any given night.  As for the service, that's where this location is lacking, especially during happy hour. I mean I have had a couple good experiences here but I can recall quite a few times where the servers would either forget about my drink, or for something that I asked for. Rarely do they even check up on you while you're there."
June Y.,"Milpitas, CA",293,263,653,3.0,7/12/2014,"Food is really nothing special but service the night we were there was really good. Didn't catch our server's name but she was extremely patient and attentive to our party of 6.  Ordered the lemon flavored scallop dish from their dinner menu and thought it was alright. wasn't terrible tasting but also nothing I would reorder. Scallops were tender but lacked flavor. Asparagus looked really sad and were a little tough to chew. Brown rice was very dry. Good thing the scallops came with a bit of sauce so I was able to chew my rice down. For a dish that's almost $20, you would really expect more. Maybe if you downed your dish with a drink or two, it would taste a whole lot better?"
Renee R.,"New York, NY",966,117,501,2.0,7/10/2015,"Worse than average for sure when it comes to food. I came here with a big group and I had three different dishes.  Here's what I had: The mac and cheese appetizer: 1 star The menu makes it sound super fancy, but it's not. It didn't taste like there was even cheese on it. It was very dry and not flavorful. Super bland. I'm not one to waste food, but they wasted their time making something like that for the menu. The noodles weren't even done right-- dry and chewy. Like, come on. How do you get mac and cheese noodles wrong?  The Best Beginnings appetizer platter: 3 stars This wasn't bad. The artichoke dip was good and I really like the Santa Fe spring rolls, as well. Good flavors in the spring rolls.  Mahi Mahi Tacos: 1 star Egh... Just no. I shouldn't have ordered it. I always take my food home, but it was't worth it here because I knew I wouldn't have eaten it. Guacamole was too watery, like, how do you water down guac? Fish was definitely not even close to fresh and the chipotle mayo was drenched with a too big soft taco wrap. Salsa didn't taste fresh either. They got this taco all wrong. Tacos are about fresh ingredients. Even if you don't have many ingredients, or it's not super fancy or complicated... have fresh ingredients for a taco. Definitely wouldn't ever order that or eat here again.  Service: 3 stars.  Okay enough. We had to wait mad long, even though there was plenty of seats available, but maybe that's a part of how they manage serving so many people. I don't know. The food was brought out at a decent time for a big group, and everyone we had was friendly enough. Nothing to rave about or complain about. Super average.  All in all, I would never come here again, unless it was with a big group and I had to for work, but I definitely wouldn't buy anything even if I was here. First impressions matter. Lovingly,  Renee Rises-- The Filipina foodie"
Aaron G.,"San Leandro, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/8/2017,"Wow. My server Marcus was amazing. 10 out of 10. He was very attentive and took care of me as soon as I sat down. This guy was a pro... he was sooooo polite and even funnier. Best BJ's server for sure. I was able to talk to the guy like I've known him for years. He makes me want to come here again. Next time I come for BJ's, I'm asking for Marcus."
Alyssa M.,"San Jose, CA",150,310,389,3.0,4/14/2015,"Went here on a Friday afternoon with my coworkers to celebrate some business! We ordered appetizers to share and they ordered drinks. Our waiter was very attentive at making sure our water was replenished and if any of my coworkers wanted refills on their drinks. Whoever delivered out spinach and artichoke dip totally wiped out and spilled all the chips over the table.  We were having a good day so it didn't bother us. BJ's is a chain restaurant, it's pretty much the same everywhere."
Melissa D.,"Fremont, CA",1,86,86,3.0,5/17/2015,"1)Unrealistic wait time. We called in and put ourselves on the waitlist and were told we would have a table by 8:40. At 840 they tell us to wait another 25 min. So we sit outside in the cold by a heat lamp. Ok not bad. Lpud airplanes overhead. 2)Slow service. Our waitress didn't come out to us for our order until 15 minutes of us waiting. No one even checked in on us for waters until then. There were only 3 parties sitting in the patio. 3)Not fully cooked Pizookie. We get our pizookie and the cookie dough is like half cooked- super mushy. We basically had Pizookie soup. Delicious nonetheless bc of the chocolate, but we wanted a Pizookie, not mashed cookie dough and ice cream. Not coming back here if I want a Pizookie bc it was way under cooked and service was super slow, even tho barely anyone was sitting outside."
Cammi A.,"Santa Clara, CA",24,3,,5.0,12/7/2016,Went out for date night with my boyfriend. We were a little disappointed that the food took almost 45 minutes to come but our server Courtney B was amazing. She checked on us and even came over twice to apologize about the wait on the food. Which wasn't even her fault. She even offered to take an entree off which I declined since the food quality wasn't the user just the time. She was a sweet heart and took off a side salad and a dessert we had ordered without even telling us. We will definitely be back! Thank you for great service Courtney.
Paulo P.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2017,We came by tonight for some Spinach & Artichoke Dip as well as some BBQ Boneless Wings. Service was terrible; it took nearly half an hour just for the appetizer. Food was nothing to write home about either. We're never coming back.
F. M.,"Fremont, CA",0,27,2,2.0,10/29/2016,"No wonder this restaurant has 2.5 stars!  The service is slow as molasses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     The starter calamari and drinks were served within ten minutes.  Twenty minutes later, main order is taken. Twenty minutes later, we are still waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Emily P.,"San Jose, CA",264,348,175,2.0,3/12/2016,"For a popular restaurant, the reviews and ratings on this place are horrible! I work downtown and was very excited about this BJs opening up close by. I was coming here for lunch and dinner like once a month and the service and food was great! Keyword: WAS  The past handful times I've been here within the last year have been not so good and actually getting worse and worse every time. I came here last Saturday and the place was not busy at all. We had a party of 7 and got sat right away! Half the restaurant was empty which I thought was a good sign for great service coming up. We ordered and it took an hour for our food. By the time we got our food, it was so cold! We didn't get checked up on once the whole time we were eating.  I ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and my sister ordered a side clam chowder in a  regular bowl. My bread bowl was barely dug out and made room for just a little of soup. It was half the amount of my sister's side clam chowder. BJs has a great menu but this location needs to train servers and the cooks better."
Nathan P.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,33,,2.0,6/1/2017,"Crap service as usual tonight. Didn't get my food. Two different people asked about it, but it wasn't until after the other 12 people in my party were fine that any of the staff actually tried to do anything. The issue was that the server didn't even write down my order. Thanks BJ's. Strike 4 or 5 now, so you're fired."
Crystal V.,"Reno, NV",97,2,,5.0,11/29/2016,"We had a large group come in during the lunch hour. Our waitress, Samantha, was amazing and wonderful. Super attentive, personable, and helpful with food recommendations. She was great and made the lunch awesome."
Alex L.,"San Jose, CA",1490,454,9470,2.0,12/14/2013,"Passing this shopping center on my way to work, I've seen BJ's being built day-by-day.  We finally decided to give this place a try tonight. We called in at 6:30 and was told there was a 45-min wait so we asked the hostess to put our name down.  When we arrived at 7:20, we were told there was still another 15-min wait.  We finally got our seat at 7:45 (1hr15min wait total).   We each ordered an IPA to sample this brewhouse for its variety of selection.  After 20-25 min, we still haven't received our drinks.  Just when we were about to flag down the waitress our drinks showed up.  About 5 min later, the food was brought to us. As soon as they dropped off my order of Moroccan Spiced Salmon, my jaw dropped.  You're kidding me right?  I saw 2 nuggets of fish and what was supposed to be roasted vegetable couscous looked more like someone dropped my plate on the floor and put the remains back onto my plate.  Are you serious? I immediately raised my dissatisfaction to the waitress who called a manager over.  She comes over and says ""Hi, how are you?"" to which I blurted out ""HUNGRY!"". I told her that this smidgeon of food on my plate resembles nothing like the picture in the menu.  She came and explained to me that ""the salmon was just sliced differently from the menu but the contents is the same"".  Sure maybe on the kids menu, but the last time I checked, this was on the adult side.  She then promised me that if I was not happy, she'd bring me out additional pieces. By the time our bill came, no food showed up.  The waitress didn't even bother to check on my promised portion so I had to state the obvious.  She returned from the kitchen and brought out an actual portion that was even bigger than in my original entree.  I was happy and it tasted great, but I still couldn't get over the fact that everything had to be pulled rather than pushed.   A service organization such as a restaurant should focus on customer satisfaction and service.  I feel this new restaurant has a lot of tweaking to do.  The staff isn't quite there yet and can stand to improve on presentation (see pic), service, and follow-thru."
Melissa H.,"Union City, CA",7,52,4,5.0,8/24/2016,My workmates and I headed over to this location to celebrate our birthdays today and had a wonderful lunch. The best part was the wonderful service we received from Chrisendra. There was something off with our sodas and before we decided to flag her down she was at our table asking if we needed something. She even helped us celebrate by bringing us birthday pizookies. Earlier in the week I had ordered a salad curbside and she took care of me in a flash that day too. Food is good here but service is spectacular!!
