Neva R.,"San Diego, CA",9,19,3,1.0,11/14/2016,"We got there at 4:40pm, and didn't get out of there until 6:15p.  We ordered dessert and it took too long and I went to the front desk and asked for the check and we left without the dessert.  People who's had arrived after us got their drinks and food way faster.  Every single thing took 15 minutes or more.  As for the food, my daughter order a burger with just lettuce and cheese, well she got lettuce and that's it, and of course it took 15 minutes to get her cheese.  The server was nice of enough to get her fries while she waited.  I ordered the mini Chicken Philly pizza, it came on a appetizer plate with cheese dripping off of it. It tasted like a pizza from Pizza Hut, which I despise, it definitely didn't taste like  Chicken Philly sandwich. It was basically a chicken pizza with mushrooms, bell pepper, and onions.   Don't waste your time or money. Ive been to BJ in San Diego and that place sucks too!"
Sudesna M.,"San Jose, CA",348,118,1356,5.0,12/13/2015,"My favorite place!!! Everything about the place is simply 5 stars. Stunning ambience and excellent service.  Impressive selection of beers and cocktails. Recommended ones: Strawberry mojito and Pink cadillac.  They have 'small bites' if you just want something light to munch with your drinks. Affordable yet yum. Try the Spinach stuffed mushrooms or Sriracha queso dips. Wate 3 things you must try here:  1. Signature Deep dish pizza - pick any flavor and it tastes oh-so-heavenly. Personal fav: Great white screaming cheesy chicken with alfredo sauce and roasted garlic - Awesomeness! You can build your own too! 2. New Orleans Jambalaya - House speciality with an exotic range of spices + Chicken + Shrimp served on pilaf. You can make it extra spicy and it will taste even better. 3 . Pizookie - Do not miss it for the wirld. Its the ultimate dessert - melting ice cream on an oven fresh hot cookie - Try the pizookie trio - sampler of 3 versions if you are a first timer. Personal fav : White chocolate pizookie with macadamia nuts. On top of all this great stuff, these guys are open until midnight which is a killer. Honestly im biased and i simply adore this place! They are consistently good and I just keep coming back! Tip: Sign up for a BJs membership card. Its free but they give great deals and free pizzokies."
Michael N.,"San Jose, CA",106,651,106,4.0,4/9/2017,"Decided to come here for dinner the other night and meet up with some friends of ours, it was a great decision as it was both halfway in distance for us both. We arrived in enough time to make reservations for four of us, of course they told us to be about 25 to 30 minutes before a table would be ready, so we decided to go grab a drink and stand around and chat for a while. During that time their text service how did visor that our table was ready. It did take about 45 minutes before this was available to sit down and order. This is probably the only main reason that were not given a five star because everything was not perfect. It took a long time from being seated to seeing the waiter come to our table to at least offer us drinks. This could be a problem if we had been waiting there without going to the bar and grabbing a drink earlier. However the waiter made up for this little hick up and proved very good service the rest of the evening. He was very slow at the back end as well and getting us our check and when we were ready to pay picking up the check and taking care of the bill so we could sign and leave. Overall this BJ's restaurant is a great location with plenty of parking. The restrooms were very clean, the facility is clean. For the most part all the servers were working very hard as it was a very busy night, we look forward and returning and give them another opportunity to earn that fifth star."
Audrey L.,"Santa Clara, CA",79,21,28,2.0,5/8/2016,"I'm giving an extra star only because our waiter was kind enough to communicate only..once...and tell us that the bar is a little slow and that he will go and see why they are taking so long with pouring our beers. How hard is it to pour two beers? We had to wait a half hour for these drinks. By the time we got our food, our beers that we were nursing were empty and we were not asked for refills. We order a flatbread and chicken wings with blue cheese dressing on the side. They gave us the standard ranch with no blue cheese. We had no utensils, no napkins, our waiter didn't check on us and when we were lucky enough to get his attention, he only did so after checking on all his other tables. Needless to say we will probably just attend lunch at a different restaurant in that shopping center next time"
Nebiate S.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,3.0,10/27/2017,Bjs had a good clientele though  Edwardo is the worst server I have ever had . Never coming back to this location
Jennifer D.,"San Jose, CA",7,5,,3.0,8/13/2017,Pizza is decent. Usually go on Monday's for 1/2 off a large pizza. They do have a happy hour. I have tried other menu items and not been too impressed. I think some of the food items are over priced for the quality. Average customer service.
Laure S.,"Upland, CA",0,56,8,2.0,11/6/2016,"Yikes! I thought all BJ's were created equal, but boy was I wrong!  I went today for a Sunday quick dinner. The dining room had a line so my friend and I picked the bar. After finding a seat we waited 10 minutes before being acknowledged by our server, Elijah. I can't pinpoint what exactly the issue was, but Elijah wasn't particularly friendly nor completely rude- so it's hard to give the service anything but ""meh"" ratings. The bar was visibly swamped so I understand the ""let's get to business attitude"" of service, but I didn't feel particularly welcomed as a customer. Since it was loud, our server seemed a little annoyed that my friend and I couldn't hear him and gave this awkward stare when we didn't answer his questions in a timely manner (due to background noise). The interaction was awkward and I've never felt so uncomfortable eating at a BJs.  The burger I ordered was waaaay too over cooked and dry. I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger done and I can easily say it was one of the most disgusting burgers I've ever eaten in my lifetime.  With the combination of ""meh"" service and bad food, I plan on never coming back to this location. I guess I grew accustomed to the great service and food at the Arden location in Sacramento. Like I said earlier, who knew there could be such a difference in quality between locations? This place needs to take a few pointers from their other successful restaurants."
Jen H.,"San Jose, CA",26,65,95,1.0,4/29/2017,"DO NOT.  I repeat... DO NOT order takeout from this place!  If you're thinking, ""Hey, I'll just download the app, getting takeout should be fast/ easy/ convenient""... think again!  I ordered two entrees from here at almost 9:30pm and didn't leave there with my food until almost 10:30.  There is no reason it should take almost an hour for TWO entrees, especially that late at night.   So, I came in about 20 minutes after I ordered.  They said one of the entrees was ready but the other (pizza) was almost done.  I paid right then as I waited (with tip, almost 20% I might add).  I kept waiting and waiting... I finally asked how much longer and was told ""Oh, they messed up your food so they have to start over now"".  By this point I am irritated.  Why wasn't this communicated earlier?  So I ask what the problem was and she tells me that they used a different type of olive on the pizza than what I ordered.  I told her that I don't mind, as I'll eat any kind of olive and she says that it's too late- they disposed of the ""messed up"" pizza and started over.  Ummm... again, communication!!  If they had told me, I would have happily taken the ""messed up"" pizza!  She says it will take another 5-7 minutes so I step outside and come back about 10 minutes later.  I saw a couple employees behind the takeout counter and no one even acknowledged me.  The girl I had been communicating with was talking to her coworkers, ignoring me.  I finally had to interject and ask her if she can check on my food.  She disappears in the kitchen for about 15 minutes.  She finallyyyy comes out with the pizza and then can't find my other entree.  I mean, REALLY?! It was a small pizza and sandwich.  By this point it was reaching an hour.   I have worked in the restaurant industry in the past and I understand that things go wrong but so much of this could have been avoided with simple communication!   Also, not ONE person apologized to me or tried to make it right.  All the while, I saw many employees coming out of the kitchen with their personal food to take home or just standing around gossiping about their coworkers.  Not one person asked if I was being taken care of or needed anything.  At the end of this whole ordeal I asked to speak to a manager.  I waited a few minutes and see the manager coming from the parking lot with an employee who was (loudly) going on about wanting to quit.  Totally unprofessional!  The girl I had talked to about speaking to a manager then tells me ""he's busy with another customer, so you'll have to wait to speak with him"" (as he's walking past me).  I was so sick of WAITING at that point and my family was wondering what was taking so long, so I just left.  This place was a complete mess tonight!  It sucks because I live fairly close to this location, but it's just not worth the time and the headache to deal with this place."
Annie H.,"San Jose, CA",11,183,93,4.0,1/22/2017,My husband and I enjoyed our visit and the food was very good.  I got a pizza and my husband got the sirloin.  The pizza was thin crust and tasted great.  The sirloin was good and the gin fries that was one of the two sides was excellent.  They were light and crispy.  The staff was pleasant and extremely friendly.  The bathrooms need some cleaning.
Tia B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,13,11,5.0,8/7/2017,"We had a party of 40 over the weekend, and everything turned out great. The food was was ready and our tables were all set. I reservation was at 8 but my family is always on Samoan time where they show up an hour or two later. The manager and our waiters extended our time so it helped so much they did that for us. Our waiter was super nice and had everything under control when it came to the alcohol receipt and our buffet receipt. Over all I recommend this place."
Jamie A.,"San Jose, CA",1,9,2,1.0,10/27/2017,"Not a place for kids.  Took our (almost) 2y. old here and they screwed up his order twice in a row.  Sent it back the first time and waited for correct order while wife and I ate our food and baby sat by hungrily getting more bored by the minute.  The second order took so long that we couldn't wait any longer (our kid was going crazy by this point), so we asked for it to go just to try to get out of there.  When the waiter brought the to go bag, we were shocked to see the same wrong order in the bag!  Waiter was rude and just walked away from us.  Talking to the manager yielded only slightly better results (at least he agreed not to charge us).  We were so annoyed with the situation, that we didn't stick around to make sure he voided the charges.  Not planning to return any time soon.  Oh, BTW, the flat bread was over-cooked (edges were like crackers), and the calamari was way too salty."
Sandra F.,"Albuquerque, NM",2,2,,1.0,10/2/2016,"Went there with group of nine tonight. We were there for hour and a half, and the food never arrived. Not a single apology. They tried to charge us for the whole order. Had to go through three levels of management to cancel the order, and pay for the two appetizers and four kids' lemonades that we had. Yes, they charged us for that.  Took half an hour to place the order. After another 20 minutes, tracked down the waitress and told her that we'll need to leave in 25 minutes for an event can we can't be late. A manager showed up, said the order would be done in 15 minutes. Asked to at least rush food for the kids. 25 minutes later still no food, we needed to leave. Found a waiter, ask to cancel the order and get a check. He brought a manager who said that he can't cancel the order as it was cooking. Disappeared. Another manager showed up, who was not authorized to charge us for the drinks and appetizers only. Finally a third manager, 15 minutes later, rings us for the $35 for the drinks and appetizers. And we are finally off. After the event we went to, we are at Panera next door.  They were fast."
Robert H.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,2.0,5/24/2017,This is for their Door Dash. Ordered burgers in the past and was happy. Now if you Door Dash you are REQUIRED to get a salad for an extra $4.50 AND REQUIRED to upgrade  a topping for $1.95. And there are only four choices of upgrades.      Um... no thank you. I pay the $4.99 delivery fee (plus I always tip the driver 20%) and I expect to order the menu item without required extras I don't want and that cost me more money.       Their greed for an extra $6.45 cost them a customer who orders over $40 most of the time. Do the math BJs!
Lauren V.,"San Ramon, CA",97,134,801,4.0,3/13/2016,"First of all, the service here is excellent. In a large family gathering of 27 people, it's usually hard to say that about the restaurants we go to. The waiter and waitress were very attentive and patient to the demands of our table. Also, the food came out very fast (for such a large party!).  The reason why I can't rate this location five stars is because of the food portions. My clam chowder in a bread bowl had WAY more bread than soup in it. Also the soup was pretty salty.  My cousin ordered a kids spaghetti, which had little to no tomato sauce in it! She had to ask for extra sauce on the side.  Despite the disparaging food portions, I would definitely recommend this place for large parties!"
Bhargavi S.,"San Jose, CA",112,2,,4.0,8/1/2017,"Jonathan Neese Manager is awesome .We ordered veg pizza , but by mistake they got us chicken pizza . Other staff was not good but Jonathan is very nice and immediately ordered new one for us ."
Joe D.,"San Jose, CA",25,4,,1.0,7/22/2017,Would give this place a zero if I could.  Every time we ever came here it's always been a straight disaster. Orders always come missing something or adding nuts to a salad that doesn't even have nuts or cold fries every time. We always say we will give this location 1 more time since it's 5 minutes away from our house but never again will I give this place another dollar of my hard earned money
Mr M.,"San Jose, CA",0,31,,2.0,6/11/2017,"There is something wrong with this BJ's that I have not experienced in other BJ's.  A few days ago we thought we would give it a try for we haven't been to this one for months, for ever time in the past there was a problem.  Sure enough, another problem.  Waiter comes over with his hand held electronic pad for our order.  My wife orders something, he marks it in, and 3 seconds later she says oh, I want to change it.  The waiter says he cannot change it because he has already entered it into the computer.  He refused.  I explained to him that we could walk out right now and not owe him a cent.  The waiter immediately says ok, I will change the order. Plus, my wife's food came 5-10 minutes before mine.   Strangely, all the waiters and servers are very nice, but the place does not seem to be managed well.  A friend of mine that usually goes to the BJ's in Oakridge Mall- in lives near it, walked out of this place because he got tired of waiting.  He talked to the manager that didn't seem to care.   I've have written to the corporate office, they don't seem to care either.  We go to the health club not far away and have, in the past, gone here because of the light menus.  I guess we will just have to quit again. The other BJ's we've gone to have been great."
Michael T.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Pro Tip, it's a bad sign when you get to an empty restaurant to seat you at noon and they say it'll be a 5-10 minute wait to seat you. Needless to say, it took over a half hour to get three of our four meals. Two were cold, largely inedible overall. The crispy bacon we requested was the soggiest thing you've ever seen. That said my kid seemed to like the Kraft Mac and Cheese that they served him, and they did refill our water once. Save yourself. Go to the Panera next door or maybe you can find something better in the dollar aisles at the Target."
Julianne J.,"Philadelphia, PA",147,6,,2.0,7/27/2017,"Service was OK; however, quality of food was pretty bad. I got the half rack of ribs which was extremely dry and didn't have a lot of sauce on it. The brussel sprouts were the best part of the meal. Most of our food also came out cold and incorrect, on top of being late. The chili cheese dip didn't include chili and the wings didn't have the sauces that were supposed to be on them and were essentially chicken nuggets. Management was kind enough to come out and apologize, but due to the quality of food I don't think I'll be back."
Chris D.,"San Jose, CA",70,5,,5.0,4/15/2017,"My Pook's Pilsner n Macadamia Nut Pizooki was yummy, Matthew served us well! Quick fast n chatty! Be back soon!"
