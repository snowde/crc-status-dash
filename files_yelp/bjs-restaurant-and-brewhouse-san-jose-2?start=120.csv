Victor C.,"San Jose, CA",4,2,,1.0,10/26/2016,Do not recommend BJ's for a large parties.  We had a party of 12 people and the service was awful.  It took them 15 minutes to come to our table after I brought up to the manager.  The soft drinks and beer took another 15 minutes to arrive.  It practically took a 1/2 for the waitress to come to our table and take our order. Never offered an apology.  It's a good place for small groups but for large groups it's thumbs down.
Chris H.,"Tracy, CA",29,13,,1.0,7/9/2017,"Yikes!  Cold pizza, metallic tasting clam chowder, cold everything except piping hot kids food.  Stay away!!!  Over staffed and friendly but the kitchen is going to make someone sick eventually."
Allan D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,43,11,1.0,4/6/2017,"Had an interesting soup and salad combo with lentils and ancient grains. Much to my chagrin, the soup was Trader Joe's bulk soup. I resent paying for store bought soup in a restaurant setting. When I bought it from Trader Joe's I loved it. It was better from the source. 6.95 for a cup of soup and some lettuce is an insult. BJ's can do better! Pizza is creative and good there. I wish I had bought that."
Paul S.,"Saratoga, CA",51,90,996,3.0,4/28/2016,"I like coming here with the team because we have both vegetarians and carnivores at work. Everybody can get something that works. The only downside is, well, it's BJ's and the food is decidedly average. Drinks are solid. Friendly staff. When you have our parameters, it works."
TaylorMarie G.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,2,1.0,1/19/2017,"Regarding this visit today, my fiance and I went to dinner tonight and I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger cooked medium. It wasn't busy and my food came out first... just a patty on a bun. Five mins later, the server came back and took the burger, bringing it back to me with an under cooked slice of bacon and a slice of unmelted cheese with just one pickle piece. I bit in to the burger to find the center cold and all the way pink. The wedges tasted like they came from the safeway deli. It was DISGUSTING and no one was around to help us. I would love to send some pictures of how gross and unappetizing this meal was."
L C.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/14/2017,BJs! Burgers as greasy as your face in middle school! What a waste of time and money. Went there looking for a quick burger and got a truck stop version of it. Save yourself the stomach ache and don't eat here. Much better options and pricing a couple steps away.
Phillip H.,"Santa Clara, CA",11,15,6,2.0,6/8/2017,Fried calamaries were soft ... not crunchy ... still waiting for our foods ... 40 minutes already went by ... was told silverwares are being washed  ... got 3 sets for 4 people ... can't rate on the rest of our order yet since they are nowhere insight...my 12 yrs old niece already said ... bye bye to this place ... btw ... we came in at around 1:30 pm on a Thursday...
Cindy M.,"San Jose, CA",196,338,853,4.0,7/28/2015,"The downtown location is in a nice shopping center with some great stores. The low-lighting and cool atmosphere make for a relaxing meal. Stopping in on a weekday after the lunch crowd was gone was the right choice. We were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately.   While deciding what to order from the large menu, I noticed management showing the staff what needed to be cleaned and how. I appreciate seeing this. It means they care enough to clean the booths in great detail and customers like me will enjoy a meal in a clean and sanitized environment. I've worked at a restaurant before and providing the best experience to patrons is key. Big kudos!  The food can be hit or miss at different locations, but it was great this time. Our order consisted of nicely battered calamari and pepperoni explosion flatbread. This was so tasty! The mains were ahi tuna salad (big, delicious salad indeed) and deep dish pizza (what they are known for). The sparkling rasberry lemonade was refreshing. Free refills of course, except refills on the root beer float were minus the ice cream. They make their own root beer. Everyone left satisfied and full.  I want to send thanks to our server Jessilyn. She was attentive, friendly, patient, helpful and provided outstanding service. She accommodated every request we had, even my request for a cup of hot water to heat my granddaughter's bottle up who had woke from her slumber during our meal. After the baby was fed, and we were ready to scoot, she boxed up our leftovers nicely and we were on our way.  Next time it's going to be a poozookie (I think that's what it's called)!"
Sandy B.,"San Jose, CA",2,37,2,1.0,5/3/2017,Most terrible experiences here (yes multiple). I have been here a handful of times always hoping they would become as good as the one I used to go to in Foster City years ago but alas perhaps this is as good as this location will ever get. . Terrible experience with not getting food until almost 2 hours after ordered.  And food quality was very very sad.  Management last night was pretty ineffective. Poor Bjs.
Chris J.,"San Jose, CA",11,26,7,2.0,9/9/2017,"After dining here a dozen or so times, I feel I now have enough experience to write an informed review of this establishment.  I have consistently experienced very slow service and incorrect orders, but my last dining experience at this location will be my last.  I stopped in here Tuesday around 9pm to get a quick (or so I was hoping) bite before heading home and calling it a day.  I ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer and the California club thin crust pizza for dine in.  I also ordered the BJ's classic chicken sandwich as a to go order.  The waitress assured me that the sandwich order would be entered after the other two entrees had been delivered to my table to  guarantee freshness.  All three orders were delivered to my table 25 minutes later.  The tuna was barely cooler than room temperature and was clearly sitting out for some time.  The California club pizza wasn't even warm.  It was literally at room temperature.  The sandwich order was served in a carryout container.  I didn't realize it until after I left the restaurant that the sandwich order was completely incorrect.  They served me the southern fried burger instead of the chicken sandwich that I had ordered.   Overall, the food here is simply ok, nothing to brag about.  In fact, the food here, particularly the bread that accompany the sandwiches, tend to be loaded with oil and butter.  There are no organic options here, though they have added a few healthier options to their menu in recent months.   I have brought this restaurant a good deal of business by hosting friends and family here since I moved to San Jose a couple years ago.  Many of those experiences ended in frustration as a result of incorrect orders and terribly slow service.  I will not make the mistake of coming here again.  It really takes a group effort to perform this poorly from the manager all the way down to the cooks.  It is my impression that there is no accountability here on any level and it definitely shows.  BJ's have permanently lost my business and I encourage all others to consider their options before committing to BJ's for a meal."
Philip T.,"San Lorenzo, CA",77,11,,2.0,6/22/2017,"The entrees were good and the server was awesome! However, this place is very understaffed..takes forever.  Also the ice cream in the pazookie was crystalized really bad.  Couldn't even eat it..chomping on ice crystals.  Very disappointing..will not return to this location unfortunately."
Carol C.,"Alameda, CA",198,883,6321,3.0,2/26/2015,"After a group tour of County of Santa Clara District Attorney's Office, the Crime Lab division, we came here for lunch and dessert. Our group of 50 people had already pre-ordered our selections about 1-1/2 months ago. Selections were roast beef sandwich with French fries, grilled chicken sandwich with French fries, or a cobb salad. A dessert of pizookie (warm chocolate chip cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream) was included with our meal. My husband and I opted for the cobb salad. Neither he nor I were totally impressed with the salad. It was a huge salad tossed with a creamy garlic dressing; however, more than 2/3 of the salad was loaded with chopped lettuce and romaine. There were a few pieces of chopped applewood bacon and a measley amount of cubed turkey. There was a fair amount of chopped tomatoes, crumbled feta cheese and 1/2 of an avocado. Cost of the salad: $12.95 - definitely not worth the price. (My spring mix garden salad with house dressing at Bubbaloo Cafe in Richmond was much better. It was served with two grilled pork chops and special onion gravy over rice. Cost: $8.95; a much better value.) Cobb salad: 2 stars. My husband bought me an Arnie Palmer. It was okay, but too much ice in the beverage resulted in a diluted, flavorless one after about 5 sips. (2.5 stars) The only redeeming factors were the pizookie (dessert), the ambiance, and the friendly waitress. (3.5 stars) A three star rating is all I can muster up for BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. It's a hit or miss in my book."
David B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",8,19,2,2.0,11/28/2016,"Sunday lunch with kids- restaurant just half full, and still we waited almost 50 minutes until the appetizers & food arrived --  c'mon guys... can't you get just the appetizers on time while the children are starving?    After the food has arrived, nobody really cared about us - no refills, no one asked if everything was all right, we were just forgotten.  the food was ok."
renay g.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,,3.0,5/30/2017,"Great food, lousy service.   It's a shame, I really like BJs menu.  The food is consistently good, but each time I go here I swear I'm not going to come back.  This time we went back because we got a ""we miss you $10 off"" coupon.   I ordered the shrimp quinoa bowl and it was excellent.  My husband ordered the Jambalaya and was also pleased.   The waitress had way too many tables and there was no way she could serve that many people well.  We ordered ice cream for dessert.  Pretty simple, right?  We waited 20 minutes and started getting impatient.  Finally, the manager brought it out and when my husband asked what took so long, he replied that the dishwasher was backed up and they had to wait for spoons.  A little communication goes a long way.  If they had told us that earlier we could have chosen to wait or cancel.  It then took another 20 minutes to get the check (and only after I went inside and asked the waitress for it). If you are a very patient person, and have a long time to spend on dinner, I recommend this place, otherwise go somewhere else."
Brandon Charlene D.,"San Jose, CA",1,1,2,3.0,8/30/2016,"Food: 4/5 | Service: 3/5  We went on a Thursday night, so we were seated right away since it wasn't crowded. Luckily, there was a Thursday promotion on baby back ribs: a salad and mini pizookie added. The babyback ribs already included two sides, in which we ordered the rice pilaf and french fries. Together, at a reduced price, we paid only $20.23 (with tax)! This amount of food was perfect for two.  We first got the caesar salad, nothing special. The baby back ribs was delicious; it had flavor both inside and outside. It wasn't overwhelmingly saucy - just the right amount. It soft and tender right to the bone! The fries were pretty good as it was seasoned well and had a nice crunch to it. Moving on to the rice pilaf, we strongly recommend that if you are looking for plain grains, then this is for you. It wasn't anything flavorful, but it was just there to balance out the flavors of the dish. If we were to come here again, we would not order the rice pilaf again however. The caesar salad came first as an appetizer and it was an enjoyable teaser while we waited for the main entree. Mmm, the pizookie was a delightful way to end the dinner as we had enough room in our stomachs to squeeze it in. It was served with vanilla ice cream on top that was melting as we took pictures of it. The heat of the cookie and the cold ice cream were like the best friends of the night as they danced on our tastebuds together. The texture and flavor were just combined to perfection.  As for the service, we understand why everyone else had a hard time coping with the employees. Although we did not have a bad experience, our waiter had a very tired look on his face and acted as if he hated his job. Wish he was more enthusiastic, but it's okay...we only tipped $2.67."
Saumya A.,"San Jose, CA",220,85,21,1.0,8/22/2016,"Generally the experience at BJ's was good for me (like a 4 star)... But today it was horrible (mostly the worst server I ever had). We came in the evening around 7ish. The host was good though. She seated us within 5 mins and also noted down my rewards number and kept it on my table for the server to see.  The server was horrible and looked tired or sleepy (or maybe drunk). He took that slip and tore it immediately even though I had some $5 in rewards to be redeemable. I asked him why did you do that, he blatantly replied - b'coz you don't have any rewards. I didn't want to argue so I just told him to bring wate. He kept an expression as if we asked me for something that he doesn't like. Then I ordered Santa Fe Salad (which has ""blackened chicken""). Another employee brings the salad but when I started eating, I realized that it doesn't even have chicken. So I called the server and tells him that salad doesn't have chicken which it is supposed to have. Even without looking at my plate/and checking himself, He quickly tells me that he is gonna bring chicken in a bowl on the side. :O :O That was a surprise.  He brings ""grilled chicken"" (photo attached) in a bowl on the side (instead of replacing the entire salad dish with a new one). Then after just 1 or 2 mins, he walks past us in our aisle and just randomly asks us ""how are you guys doing? Do you guys need a to-go box?"" ... WTH !!!! We just started eating and you just brought the entree, how can you ask us if we want a box when we didn't even start eating. That was done deal for me. Stupid server with stupid attitude and I immediately thought that something is wrong with this server. Then after saying no, after 15 mins or so, we were just about to finish our dishes, this server just took away the plate from my friends side when my friend was just having a last bite of the dish he ordered and wasn't even done fully. That was pathetic!!! How can anyone do that. .. . We thought its not a good idea to think about it more and spoil our evening. So we asked for cheque. On the cheque it was written two santa fe salad ... one for 13.95 and another with chicken for $13.95+$3 = $16.95. That was another disaster. How can the server put in two salads when I ordered only one (which by default comes with chicken and costs 13.95). We tells this server and he says that he would have to ask his manager if the second one can be removed from the bill. He comes back and started asking me questions - whether I am sure the salad didn't have chicken. WTF!!! You idiot, when I told you about it, you didn't even take a look at it and just ran away by saying you will get me a bowl of grilled chicken. And now you are doubting it. I showed him the menu which clearly says that Santa Fe Salad comes with blackened chicken. Then He somehow got the bill corrected and we were surprised to see the entry - ""Customer recognition credit of -16.95"" .. .seriously!!! :-O :-O  Dude, first of all its your fault (or maybe chef's) that you didn't bring the correct Santa Fe Salad and then you show you did a good favor to me by putting up ""customer recognition credit"" instead of removing that entry itself. Infact since you didn't bring in the correct order, as some top-level restaurants do,  you should have given that salad for free. Anyways, it was a worst experience for me so far in BJ's. And I wouldn't recommend this BJ at all. I hope the Cupertino one is atleast better than this."
Jaime C.,"Buena Vista, San Jose, CA",12,25,2,1.0,5/5/2017,"Horrible. Wasn't worth the wait for a table. Been here a few times and it just keeps getting worse. The food is now below Chili's. The margarita I had tasted like it was made with the cheapest tequila available and had no lime flavor to speak of. My wife's drink tasted like canned juice with no alcohol. Ordered an appetizer and the main course at the same time. Big mistake. What came out first? The side salad for my dinner. 20 minutes later, the appetizer and literally 4 minutes after that, the entrees. I'm done with this place for good."
Marcus T.,"Santa Clara, CA",141,20,1,4.0,5/4/2017,The buffalo wings appetizer is surprisingly good! I'd put them up against places that do wings alone. Good drinks and atmosphere. Service tends to go a bit too slow when they get busy. The automated order pads that the wait staff uses may slow things down.
H B.,"Santa Clara, CA",12,10,,4.0,3/20/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I dint expect much going by the reviews , but the cuisines were fine cooked & tasty. They have a nice variety on the menu. Its a good place to chill out with friends with good food & for watching games. Staff is polite & courteous..!"
Randy P.,"San Jose, CA",107,66,3,1.0,3/10/2017,"Yikes, there are so many negative reviews on this location, and I must agree with everyone.  I love their food but the services SUCKS so its kills everything.  I just came from there and sat at the bar area.  My server was named Mathew V and he was hands down the worst server EVER!   Theres no point in going to details because I dont think my review will make a difference.  But lets just our food came out cold, I had to raise my hands many times while getting ignored, and his customer service was a 0 out of 10.  Please go to the BJs next to Oakridge Mall.  Their customer service is a 10/10!"
