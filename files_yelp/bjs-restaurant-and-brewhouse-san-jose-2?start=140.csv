Fernando R.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,3,,1.0,12/4/2016,"If you like waiting 50 minutes for food this is the place to come. Not only did they mess up my order once, but twice. Not sure how hard it is to make a medium rare burger...I been to this location 3 times, not by choice, and every time has been the same.  This is for sure last time. I'll settle for the McDonald's dollar menu instead of coming to this place"
Roger Y.,"Santa Clara, CA",42,11,1,2.0,6/27/2017,"I have been to this location 4 times... all 4 times had to wait 15 min with no one in front of me. when co hostess came in from her making out in the parking lot, she sat me.... even though the expecting host was rolling napkins instead of seating waiting costumers. Food was ""OK"" ... but our waiter was not to be found... refills not happening. POOR SERVICE."
Meree P.,"San Mateo, CA",6,126,53,2.0,3/12/2017,"No Bueno, horrible service. Our waiter was nice but I'm sure just too busy so he was no where to be see. We had to ask a table next to ours to use their ketchup (these peeps were weird they acted like I asked to use their toothbrush) my child wanted ketchup for his fries and no service staff was around. Very slow on drinks and food took way too long so the food was just okay when you're pissed about the service. This is the second time I've been here and service was the same. Come on Bj's.. step it up! You know when your busiest times are and you need more staff and definitely more attentive staff. I've had a better experience at BJ's Oakridge which is too bad because this is closer."
James M.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,1,2.0,9/6/2016,"I've been to this BJ's a few times with varying levels of service and food quality (3 out of 5 best). Thursday night was my last time coming to this BJ's location. The hostess said the wait would be 15-20 minutes. Nobody else was waiting! Less than a minute later we were seated by the other hostess who heard what the first had said. Adriana was our server and had a serious attitude problem. She behaved as if we were inconveniencing her. The coke I ordered was flat and low on syrup, Adriana finally stopped by the table after passing us numerous times and ignoring us trying to get her attention to get something else. Food comes and my bison burger has pico de gallo on it after I asked for none when I ordered and my girlfriend's burger has two large cheese crisps (fried cheese) not specified on the menu in addition to the cheese that comes with the burger.  I return my burger to the kitchen with no apologies from Adrianna. Burger returned via another server. Burger is cold and someone dumped more sauce on top (can't taste the meat at all, just foodservice sauce that tastes between BBQ, teriyaki, and pineapple corn syrup).  Adrianna ignored us for at least ten minutes while taking orders at the tables on either side of us. No ""I'll be right back with your check"" not even a grunt out of her. She ignored the check three times to circle around and chat with other servers (we can see you) and finally returned to the table with only change in large bills after picking up the check. Sorry but your poor service reflects on the staff as a whole, I won't be giving a +20% tip for shit service and mediocre food. I had to physically go to her at the terminal to get my receipt, which she dug out the the trash rather than print a new one."
Abhijit P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,15,,5.0,6/20/2017,One of the best ambience. You love the atmosphere especially during a match. Enjoyed delicious huge pizzas and awesome desserts
Michael C.,"San Jose, CA",44,2,,1.0,6/18/2017,I didn't even get to eat. I'm writing this from Chili's next door. What horrible uncaring staff. Who is running this place?
Rogdrick B.,"San Jose, CA",10,1,,3.0,5/4/2017,"As a long term fan of BJ'S I always have enjoyed the food here it's always consistent, I always have to take my time to find out what is new and what is seasonal. This apparent time I loved the food as always but it tends to ruin your day when you have a bartender who is acting like you the boyfriend who slept with her best friend.  Kinda seems as if she was pissed about something. There was not on lick of customer service shown and to me image is everything so a smile can go a long way.. ohh yeh and also how can I start to eat if you don't give me any silver ware."
Sara T.,"San Jose, CA",347,355,2665,2.0,12/18/2015,"2 stars for this BJ's restaurant, because I'm annoyed with the hostess and their false waiting time. I came here yesterday (12/17/15) with a group of friends after graduation. There were 7 of us and they said it will take 40 minutes, which is the usual wait time whenever I come here. We were all very hungry, but we decided to wait and talk outside by the entrance. Like 20 mins later we decided to go in and ask how much longer, and she said it's still going to be a while, but if we want to sit outside, it will only take 5 minutes, so we're like sure! But like WTF, why didn't you give us that option first? So yeah that 5 min wait to sit outside turned into 10 minutes, and another 5 minutes, and another 10 mins and by that time I got angry cause everyone that arrived after us got seated before us? WTF. But seriously, can you get your estimate wait time correct? It's annoying when you give us the wrong time. I know I gave the hostess an attitude (and I apologize), but please give me a better estimate wait time? I would of been fine if you said one hour, but you kept giving us a false wait time :( don't say 5 min and get my hopes up...lolz. k. Bye. Besides that whole wait time issue...the food was good (just hoping they didn't spit in our food, since I was kind of rude)! The food wasn't like amazing, but I think we were all hungry, so we digged into our food!  Just a note, if you sit outside beware of bees, birds, and extreme cold or hotness. Not sure if I'll return to this BJ's location again ... I never had such a bad experience / wait time with this location and I been coming here for the past 2ish years since its near SJSU. K, done ranting. P.S Our server, David was very nice though :)"
Claire K.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/24/2017,"So I emailed the restaurant Tuesday morning and still haven't had a response. Not really sure they care about their customers.  Anyway Monday night I Ordered the Steak - ribeye at $24.75 with taxes $27.04 and it  was possibly the worst steak I have ever had! I asked for it to be medium. It was completely rare, chewy and disgusting. Worst dinner ever! We had ordered take out so couldn't exactly just sent it back to the kitchen. Ordered at 9.36 pm.  I also ordred coleslaw with it instead of potato ... guess what, I got a potato! No coleslaw.  I will not be recommending this restaurant, a steak from safeway is less expensive and tastes 100 times better.  0 out of 100 for you guys!  Look forward to hearing why your food is so bad and your staff can't follow orders."
Rod M.,"San Francisco, CA",174,864,564,3.0,3/20/2017,"Went here for lunch and it was a standard BJ's set-up very similar to the Newark, CA location but the bar area felt a lot smaller. Good service here as it wasn't too crowded."
Dony C.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",24,1,,1.0,9/23/2017,Horribly slow service when the restaurant was not even busy.  The waiter was good and attentive but the kitchen was a joke.
Nate R.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/20/2017,"The off menu nachos are  !! I usually come during the day so its not very busy but i have heard it gets busy on weekend nights. If busy, i suggest sitting at the bar and not wait to be seated."
Hans W.,"Valley Glen, Los Angeles, CA",365,3,2,5.0,4/15/2017,Mathew did an excellent job serving our table. Will definitely want to come back again!!! This gentleman deserves a gold star!!!
Annie D.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,2,1.0,4/28/2017,It took more than an hour for us to receive our food. Bad service. Don't bother coming on the weekends.
Timothy C.,"Santa Clara, CA",3,10,,1.0,9/4/2017,"We got here at 1:15pm place looks pretty empty but still half an hour to be seated, and over 45 min wait for food.  One person got his food early, and the rest of us had to wait 15 min more for our food.  For any restaurant this should be unacceptable especially with half the tables empty"
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,3.0,6/16/2016,"A great place for Happy Hour. Work organized a big get together for about 25 or so co-workers. We had called about a couple weeks ahead of time and reserved the patio. If you order food off their regular menu, they'll even provide complementary soft drinks. But we decided to go with the HH specials. All their appetizers and drinks are discounted. It's a chill place and service was decent considering the large size of our group. I had their mango beer. For the apps, I think we tried almost everything - ribs, wings, calamari, mozzarella sticks, sliders, egg rolls, chips & dip, potato skins, etc. I think the wings were the most popular as we got multiple orders of them.  However, there were some issues. Even though we reserved the patio, that didn't stop the restaurant from seating people in the patio area. It would've been ok if the other patrons were off to the side but they were smack dab in the middle if the patio. And then after about an hour, the restaurant started to get super busy and since we weren't using the whole patio, more people were seated around us. Which was fine, except we were occupying certain tables and the minute we stepped away to mingle, one of the patrons asked to move to that table. The restaurant couldn't say no (the customer's always right) and took away our table. Also it was a super sunny day. It's not a covered patio and there were not enough umbrellas for all the tables. Didn't even seem like there was enough for half the tables. So some people got really hot really quickly. Also I know they can't really help it but they're directly under the flight path for many planes landing/taking off at the nearby SJ airport so it got super loud at various points in the evening. I would sit inside next time I'm here."
Adrian Y.,"Saratoga, CA",114,90,6,3.0,3/18/2017,"Just a regular BJ's place. Burgers are pretty good, but nothing too special."
Adam S.,"San Ramon, CA",1,32,4,2.0,4/25/2017,I'm giving them 2 stars because the food was ok and the price was fine.   My wife and I stopped bye here on 4/24.  We enjoy visiting BJ'S for dinner and on Monday they often have great deals. Half off pizza or in our case buy one get on free meal.  We asked the waitress about the specials for the evening. She happy to tell us about the half off pizza and when we asked about the buy one dinner get one free she claimed to not know what we were talking about and told us that if BJ'S sent us a coupon to show her when she returns from getting our drinks.  Well.  We just pulled up the BJ'S website and showed her.  We got the jist she know about the special.  Not sure why she didn't acknowledge this from the start.  As you might have guessed this set the tone for the dinner. Had to ask for refills and not sure where she disappeared too for most of our dinner.
Ana C.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,7,5.0,5/14/2017,"We just had our Mother's Day lunch at this restaurant today, the food was great and you have to try the Avocado Egg Rolls and the draft beers. The best part of our dining experience was we had a great waitress Michelle, she had a great smile and she brought us things that we hadn't ask for (like my daughter's refilled drink, to-go-box for our leftovers & extra chips for our spinach dip), she can read my mind. Thank you Michelle! We'll be back for my birthday dinner in July."
Rohit B.,"Houston, TX",50,15,,1.0,5/26/2017,"Wow! Worse BJ's ever. The waiter was doing rounds like for every 20 mins. The food was super late, the drinks are late. Though the food is really nice the service is horrible. Just wasted a couple of hours for lunch. No plates or cutlery given. Stay away!"
