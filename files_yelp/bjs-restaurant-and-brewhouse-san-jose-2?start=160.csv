Shana W.,"South San Francisco, CA",66,248,90,1.0,6/19/2016,"I use to live in the San Mateo County and was excited to hear of a new restaurant in town.  So, I was able visit 2 of the locations in the peninsula.  After a few visits at both locations, service was good but just went down hill from there. Now that I live in the South Bay and saw that this location is fairly new, I thought I'd give it a try.  When this location opened up, service was good.  Within this year, I feel as the service has slowed down.  Last night we were in to dine and requested that we sit outside as it looked like the service inside looked really slow.  We guessed wrong, we waited a good 15 minutes and there wasn't a single server insight.  My husband and I agreed that if we didn't see anyone come in the next 5 minutes, we would leave.  Instead of being greeted by a server, we got greeted by a big fat COCKROACH on the table.  Yes a cockroach and within seconds my family and I got up immediately and just decided to take our business elsewhere.  Not sure if we would be back after seeing this creature in their establishment.  I honestly wanted to give your chain another try."
Lou Ann R.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/10/2017,"We go to this BJ's on Coleman more often than the one at Oakridge, which is closer to our house. Is is sometimes a bit less crowded. Had a great, light dinner there tonight. A deep dish pizza and two side salads. It was very tasty and hit the spot. Our server was great!! Great service and food. I didn't have their top shelf Margarita tonight, usually do. It is REALLY yummy. Love this place, lots of selections, for whatever kind of meal you want."
Tommie V.,"San Jose, CA",32,9,72,1.0,3/11/2017,"I waited 30 mins for my pizza and the waitress told me there was ""cheese"" on it, so they had to remake it and it will be done in 10 more minutes."
Zel T.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/25/2017,"We come in at least once a week and enjoy sitting in the bar area.  Service is always outstanding and we are always welcomed with our usual pitcher of blue moon with extra oranges, usually without asking!   It was so nice to have Matt as our waiter again, it's been awhile, but he remembered us.  Our home away from home!"
Vicky N.,"San Jose, CA",238,175,151,2.0,11/17/2015,"I came here for a weekday work lunch. Although it wasn't very busy, the experience was mediocre at best. My biggest complaint was the food and the portion sizes. The menu is huge (16 pages? Something like that), which usually gives me anxiety, but BJ's is known for its pizzas and burgers. If you like anything else, it will still most likely be here. Looking at the prices/menu photos and keeping in mind that this is a chain, I was under the impression that we would be getting a lot of food. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with gravy and potatoes -- which would have been better if it wasn't one spoonful of potatoes and one piece of chicken. Also, gravy drenched the entire chicken, so crunchiness + flavor = nonexistent. Service was also kind of inconsistent. Our server forgot to fill some people's waters, and the food came out randomly so that some of us finished eating when others would just get their meals. It's enough to just say... Eh, probably not coming back again."
Chris D.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/2/2017,"Had a school sponsored dinner here and the food was really not very good.  The service was good though.  To start we had the chips and guacamole which should have been chips and avocado since it was basically slices of avocado.  That was easily resolved though with just mixing it up myself.   Then I had the the sirloin, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The sirloin was cooked properly but was incredibly dry, tough and did not have much flavor.  My mouth started to hurt from trying to chew it about halfway through so I did not finish.  The asparagus was dry, flavorless and tough.  The mashed potatoes were ok.  My daughter had the kids burger with a side of broccoli and carrots. The burger was ok and she enjoyed it.  She refused to eat the carrots and broccoli as they had no flavor at all.  I confirmed by trying them myself, dry and flavorless."
Mr G.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"Wow, was that a shitty experience. six waiters hanging out at the hosted desk, open tables and still had to wait. The chili was barely lukewarm, pizza arrived but no stand so they walked around with our pizza looking for a stand while our pizza got cold. Kept asking for utensils and a napkin. The waiter showed up with drink napkins but no utensils. Had to go to the hosted desk to ask for them. The manager came by to offered a discount for the shitty service. We told him the waiter was not properly trained but i think he was just lazy."
Joyce T.,"San Jose, CA",1,11,,3.0,4/30/2017,"Came here for dinner with my friends last week. Bacon cheeseburger with guacamole seemed like an exciting one to try, but the meat was dry, tough to chew through, and just tasted like it was beyond well cooked.. Appetizer dishes on the other hand were quite delicious!  As for desserts, their pizookie with ice cream is good, but way too sweet!"
Dora G.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,2,1.0,8/25/2017,Very bad service starting from hostess they were talking and took a few minutes to notice we where there then they sat us in a dirty table and when I moved she got mad on top of that menus where very dirty too and service not to good
Nicole D.,"San Jose, CA",230,112,287,2.0,11/11/2015,"I guess I'm being nice by giving this place 2 stars. Been to a few other BJs around the Bay Area, but I guess this one had to be the last straw for me. I never really realized how bad this place is. I have a general understanding that BJ's is slow, but tonight was even slower. I ordered a mini pizza for the boyfriend and I to share. LOL! I didn't think it'd be a personal pizza-- the size smaller than a Pizza Hut personal pizza. $11+ for this? I wish I had passed that one lol. Maybe this one's my fault A friend's burger came out cold. The cocktail I got did NOT look like the picture at all. My boyfriend's beer flight was small as well.  We've definitely had better. The server was so unresponsive to us and very quiet and not confident at all.  We didn't ask for more than a bottle of ketchup (literally), so I'm not so sure why service is slow. I'm glad the Warriors game was on though lol. 2/10 Would probably not come back."
Michael L.,"San Jose, CA",128,87,1451,3.0,9/15/2015,"I've come to eat and drink here several times and each time was NOT a total disaster like some of the other reviews I have read. The food comes out wrong every time we come but they do their best and fix it. Ordered a cheese pizza, it came out with pepperoni.  They brought us a new one no issue. Pizza was burned on the crust, they gave a new pizza and let us keep the burned pizza. I then gave the burned crust pizza to the homeless man sitting outside. So that was a win win. All the servers were friendly with great attitudes which keeps us coming back.  Small issues here and there but nothing to keep us from returning. I usually order Guiness on tap, the pour and glass could be better..but oh well cant be too picky. They do have flights and I always order those as well.  One waitress told me that flight selection was limited to BJ's brews only I said hmmm I think your wrong LOL.  So dont let them tell you otherwise you can order anything on TAP for your flights.  One standout here was the Ahi tuna salad, it was delicious and I will order it next time I come back. *** 3"
Fernando S.,"San Jose, CA",9,8,,5.0,3/5/2017,"This BJ's is definitely the best one in San Jose. The hostess greets you at the entrance and the servers pay attention to your table. We have a BJ's that is closer to our residence, but my wife and I make the extra drive to dine at this location. I did have a question after we had left the restaurant, regarding an Email Discount that was being offered. I took the Survey and submitted my question. Shortly after, the General Manager named Fredrick responded and provided me with a token of appreciation. Excellent place to dine and it's great that the GM cares enough to respond to his customers."
Cynthia L.,"Los Gatos, CA",372,227,55,1.0,11/12/2015,"Would give them 0 stars if I could!!!!!!!! Came here around 9pm on a Thursday and surprised to hear a 5-10 minute wait for 2 people.  Sits IN FRONT of the hostess stand for 20 minutes.... Goes up to check on my name Hostess says to us ""OH we called you 18 minutes ago"" Are you kidding me? If I was sitting 5 feet away from the hostess stand and didn't hear a thing, then obviously you aren't yelling loud enough.  Not coming back here again!"
Ronald G.,"San Jose, CA",275,2,,1.0,3/20/2017,BJ's in general has poor taste in food and client service. In most instances when I go into a BJ's whether it be Northern or Southern California my experience has always been a half assed college drop out effort from people who seemingly don't even want to be there. BJ's might as well be a dive bar without even a pool table.
Bill H.,"San Jose, CA",30,60,18,1.0,12/16/2016,"Beer used to be awesome, hell I used to work there for 6 years opened two locations and guess what I sold my stock because they went corporate and the food turned into cheesecake and the beer went to shit. Really disappointing I miss Bjs 10 years ago..."
Pure L.,"Union City, CA",325,3,,2.0,7/7/2016,"The food was great and the service was not the best. The server spilled water on my friend's phone and dropped her pizza. I asked for ranch many times and it wasn't until my 4th request that I actually got it. The manager was kind enough to give us more fries because of the dropped pizza, but my friend's phone is not functioning properly now. Overall, the experience was not the best and it could have been the servers were put in a lot of pressure."
Amilli V.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,10,,1.0,8/19/2016,"I didn't even make it to the restaurant yet but felt compelled to write a review. I attempted to call in and make a reservation for a large party. I briefly spoke with an employee about my party number for the following day but did not say the specific time. She said ""okay"" and I was put on hold. I was on hold for 6 minutes and hung up.  I understand if I need to be put on hold for a bit, but just let me know how long I might be waiting!"
Geminyna J.,"Bay Area, CA",189,244,5350,1.0,8/4/2015,"Wanna eat? Then you've come to the WRONG PLACE.  We arrived promptly for our 8:30pm reservation with 7 starving kids and 7 hangry adults. It was getting late and hardly any other patrons were in the restaurant.  30 mins after taking our orders, our server comes back with water and says ""I haven't put in your food orders in yet cuz I wanted to get you guys your waters first"". A hush falls over the table. SERIOUSLY?! CUZ GETTING TAP WATER IS TIME SENSITIVE?!?? Another 20 mins go by and she brings out the rest of our drinks. Then advises, ""I just put in your kids' meals. After I drop this off to you, I'm gonna put in the adult orders.""  WTF WHO DOES THAT?!?! 50 minutes after taking our orders, she still hasn't put our food in?!  We were in such disbelief, everyone's eyes had to be pushed back into their sockets.  It took our sever ALMOST AN HOUR just to send our orders to the kitchen and serve a table of water. You know your toddlers are starving when they're devouring a shared salad to pacify themselves until their kids meals arrive.  To top off our server's lack of urgency, she had a smart mouth. In hindsight, I'm not sure if she was sassy or just one beer short of a six pack.  But with as many out-of-pocket remarks she made throughout the night, I'm surprised she's still employed.  Save yourself the agony. Go to Panera next door. Or Target. Or... anywhere but this particular BJ's with zero personality."
Buddha L.,"San Jose, CA",2,8,,3.0,2/26/2017,"Services very bad. Food was okay except the greasy oily Brussels sprouts dose not look appetize. My table Waiter was super slow and dint even give us any service the other Waiter who is not even has a responsibility for my table was taking care us. So big shout out to that pretty Waiter name ""ALISHA"" And booooo to Waiter name Arturo."
James C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/17/2017,"One of my favorite go to places to take the family. Always consistent and good. When you don't know what you want, they pretty much got it all. If something goes awry, they know how to make it right! Love It!"
