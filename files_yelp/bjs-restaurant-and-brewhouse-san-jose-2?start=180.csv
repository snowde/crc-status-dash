Sean J.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/13/2017,I'm a repeat customer and always glad when I get Azriel!!! He is always so friendly and makes my dining experience a joy!! Next time you come in ask for him. He is worth the wait. Very attentive and genuine. Hard to find in a server these days. Keep it up Azriel.
Sabrina C.,"Sparks, NV",46,4,,1.0,3/11/2017,"My family and I stopped here on our way to a matinee Sharks game. It was 11 when we arrived on a Saturday, and not busy at all. We chose patio seating because it was such a nice day outside. Our waiter took longer than expected to come take our drink orders and even longer to bring them and take our food orders. Our food we received was wonderful, but we were only checked back on once and that was after we had finished our food. We asked for a box and our ticket, which took five minutes to receive. We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our credit card back after giving it to them to pay. After accidentally signing the wrong copy they were quick to come after us to sign the correct one even though they drug their feet to do anything else. Overall, wonderful food and drinks but very, very poor and SLOW service, even at a time where we were one of maybe 15 patrons."
Laura T.,"Union City, CA",2,31,12,4.0,9/4/2016,"Usually frequent the BJ's closer to home but was in the San Jose area so it was BJ's for dinner.  It was a Friday night and still rather early for dinner arrived around 5:30 p.m. so we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  Our server, Yesenia was the best!  5 Stars for Yesenia G.! Very pleasant and efficient.  She checked in on us frequently and our beverages were refilled timely.   While still working on our dinner, our server asked if wanted to order desert.  Thought for a second, it was rather early to order desert when we haven't nearly completed the dinner portion but then I remembered it can take some time for the desert to be prepared.  We usually order a Pizookie but went with their Beignet topped with ice cream, whip cream and surrounded with strawberries.  The picture on the menu made it look so good, so we had to give it a try. There was an extended delay with our desert order and our server kept us updated on the status.  Just before our Beignet finally arrived to our table, our server informed us that she told her Manager about the delay and that our desert was free and on the house. That was a nice surprise and saved us an additional $7.25.  Thankfully, we weren't in a hurry and sometimes, being patient and pleasant does have it's rewards."
Alison A.,"San Jose, CA",75,43,6,5.0,2/10/2017,Had the best experience the other night for my boyfriends birthday dinner. We tried this location out just because of the convenience of location but i was scared due to previous bad experiences. We seriously lucked out. Our servers name was Andrew aka the brew genius... He could not have made our dining experience better. Quick knowledgeable service. Great personality. Food was great. I will definitely be returning to BJ's but I'll call and make sure Andrew is working first. Keep him around admin at BJ's.
Lushi Z.,"San Jose, CA",70,169,72,4.0,12/13/2016,First time at this location and the staff did a great job at accommodating my party of 20 people. Our server was very attentive with refilling our drinks and clearing our plates. The food did take a while to come out though but that was probably because they wanted to bring all of our orders out at the same time. We ordered two of the appetizer platters to start and one side of our table had finished it for about 20 minutes before the other side got theirs. But the appetizer platter is so good! I love the avocado egg rolls dipped in the yummy sauce! Most of us ordered pasta which we should've just shared because the portions were huge! I barely touched mine considering how filling the appetizers were lol!
George G.,"San Jose, CA",79,36,5,1.0,4/16/2016,"The service here is a real crap shoot.   Took the family here for a pizookie treat on Friday night.  40 + minute wait, that is my fault for trying on a Friday night.   By the time we sat down we had decided to add some apps to the intended dessert order.   Ordered some chips with a dip, forgot which one, a beer and some iced teas to start.   Server was slow and indifferent, maybe she had to manage too many tables.  Took about 15 minutes to get the beer.  After another 15 minutes the app was still not delivered.  Our food was later delivered still no app.  For the meal I had the sliders which were incredibly blah.  Tiny slices of triangle shaped meat thinner than a McDs 2 for $2 cheese burger.  There was a dab of ketchup under neither the 'meat' and absolutely nothing to make this 'burger' stand out.  Server did not offer to bring Mustard or any other condiments.  When she did arrive at the table to check on us, it was apparent she was already thinking of her next table.    Overall,  forgettable food, slow boring service, long wait times.  Couldn't wait to get out of there.   Note to mgmt., if you want to sell more beer, for me at least, get it out faster.   I was paced at 1.5 beers for this service, you could of served me four if you let me set the pace."
Marlene H.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,2,,1.0,8/5/2017,"I place an order to go through post mates since my husband is here on a business trip . Both of my entrees the Atlantic Salmon and the Parmesan crusted chicken came dry, no sauce whatsoever. The sauce is what gives it the flavor. My chicken and fish were dry. When I called it took a while to get a hold of the manager. I told her about my issues she said they couldn't do anything since it was through Postmates she said I should contact them. It was already midnight I didn't want to go through the hassle of waiting any longer. I asked her if there was anyway she could help me out since it was the restaurants fault she refused. I am very disappointed. The items were orders correctly therefore should of been made correctly. To top it of no utensils were included."
My D.,"San Jose, CA",15,35,37,1.0,8/19/2015,"Davina gave us the worst experience I've ever had at BJs. I usually have a good time here and return weekly with a crowd of coworkers. However, tonight took a turn for the worst and I doubt I would ever return again.  Our waitress, I believe her name was Davina, was extremely rude upon serving my party. I've always had the most pleasant service here until now. She got straight to the point and pressured us to order quickly even though we were not ready. Then our food came out more than half an hour later on a Wednesday where it was not very busy at all. The worst part is that our food was burnt. We ended up not eating our food at all and she never asked us if the food was okay. She just ended up taking the full plates of burnt food away and immediately gave us the bill for food we didn't eat which I expressed was clearly not edible.  The service tonight was unacceptable and I cannot risk ruining another night by returning here ever again. I hope they hire better waitresses."
Usman G.,"Fremont, CA",919,44,8,5.0,3/6/2017,Great food and best service ! Like the pizookie to be the best of all ......drinks are awesome too !
Amanda N.,"San Jose, CA",367,203,300,2.0,7/30/2014,"Pro:  I like the fact that they have curbside service for take out you don't even got to go and just call their number and sit outside your car . Con: I ordered the cob salad...I believe I had better, with more blue cheese, meat. Bj offered too much lettuce in my salad. I felt like I was just eating lettuce  for $13.00 I don't think I'll come back, they are stingy for the about of blue cheese which I couldn't taste the richness of it, and bacon??? Looks like I was just given the fat parts...Soooo tiny pieces that were crushed/cut up. Really?"
Audrey H.,"San Jose, CA",21,56,42,4.0,6/6/2016,"This location is pretty good. I took my mom for lunch yesterday and we sat in the bar area. I'm giving 4 stars because the weather was great but the hosts told us the patio was closed. :( However, our server was friendly and attentive. I didn't catch her name but she had long hair and dimples.  My mom and I shared the honey sriracha brussel sprouts which were great. They weren't too spicy at all but gave just the right amount of kick to it. Portion size is good too.  The Cucumber lemonade cocktail was really refreshing as well. I think this is a good spot to watch a game or have outside lunch... if they decide to serve on the patio! It was only about 2:30 when we got there."
Sheryl g.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,1,1.0,4/23/2017,"We've come to this location several times and never never had such horrible service ever. But tonight was unexpectedly slow people waiting 45 mins for food, refills. The section we were in people were walking out because it was taking to long to get their food, waitress attention etc...even after call the manger"
Steve M.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,12,3,1.0,11/5/2016,"Great place for slow service, COLD food, and a mediocre time. Wow it's a good thing the economy is well, or you wouldn't surVIVE"
Dahyei K.,"San Jose, CA",464,24,20,2.0,5/4/2016,Slow service. Cold food. Took an hour to get our food and another hour to get our check. This place sucks.
Andy P.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/4/2016,"My experience at this BJ's with regard to the food and beer was just as good as ever. Great beer and consistently good food.  Unfortunately my recent experience with the staff tells another story. The greeter was indifferent. The waitstaff - 2 different servers since they announced a 'break' midstream during dinner - was just ok.  What really gets me is that I left, by mistake, some nice sunglasses behind. I fortunately was nearby the next afternoon and went in to see if they found them. I received a blank and indifferent look. Then, the greeter went to ""check"" with the manager out back. She came back and simply stated that I could leave my name. I could tell that she didn't care but I left my name, contact, and a description of the glasses. Well, my wife was nearby today and went in to ask. This time she saw hesitation in the greeters face, an indifferent nod by the manager and then, after they went out back and returned, they presented the glasses sheepishly asking if they were the ones.  Well, if they had them and my note from yesterday, why didn't they call.  Every interaction suggested that they didn't want to be helpful or turn them over but for some reason they came clean. I'm really thankful but certainly don't have much confidence in the team there, in general."
Nin J.,"San Jose, CA",38,154,235,2.0,3/23/2016,I don't understand why this place takes so long on everything. Always a wait here and it's not cause they are busy. From the moment you walk in you wait to be seated. To ordering your food and the longest is getting it. Today's wait time from our food  took 40 mins.
Bobo U.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,7,3,1.0,8/16/2015,The 3rd time I gave this Bj's a chance but every time we visit they failed! starting with the hostesses...we asked for a table for 2 would be fast as no one waiting and many open tables but no she told us 5 min wait. 5 min passed someone toke us to an empty section but choose to put us @ the end of the row that is the worst end which people passes by behind the seat.  The only reason I comeback here is the pizookie but that too got served to us after 20 min for a mini size...not the server's fault  He was pleasant & attentive but this restaurant is bring managed so poorly!
Noah M.,"Los Gatos, CA",97,13,,2.0,3/15/2016,"The food here is great. That's not the problem in fact, it's what keeps us coming back even if we regret it afterwards. The service here is unacceptable. If I were to guess, I'd say that they have too many tables and not enough servers. Which is something the management needs to address. I've been here multiple times, weekdays, weekends, different times of day throughout, and have waited exceptionally long each and every time. Expect to get server attention in 30 minute intervals. Only here does a casual dinner turn into a 3 hour affair. This doesn't seem to be as much as a problem at the Oakridge location.  On the positive, the food and drinks are great and parking is very easy to find."
John D.,"San Jose, CA",100,544,13792,1.0,3/9/2014,"My really good friend just received a big promotion at work so he wanted to celebrate; my family was invited along with another couple to join him and his wife for drinks and dinner there on a Saturday night. I had tremendous reservations coming here because I had seen the Yelp reviews on the bad service, but my buddy wanted to come check it out because it was new -- far be it from me to piss in anyone's Cheerios. I'm not fan of chain restaurants in general but BJ's I can usually tolerate because they actually have great beer and decent enough burgers that I can justify going there in my head. Well, unfortunately the night didn't turn out so well. Which means I have to break out with another rendition of JD's ""The Good, The Bad, & The  Ugly""!! *crowd cheers* The Good: -The Beer at BJ's is always solid. Everyone enjoyed their beers and my wife was loving her Skinny Rita. -A couple of the ladies split a ""thin-crust"" pizza and seemed to enjoy it; I use the term ""thin-crust"" here very loosely because I've seen thinner crusts at the Grand Canyon. *rim shot* -The Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli were actually pretty good. I'd order them again. -The company we had at the table was great! Everyone was having a great time laughing and telling stories. At one point my 3-year-old was entertaining us with his rendition of Chamillionaire's ""Ridin' Dirty"" (It's a long story--don't ask). Yeah, I know, technically BJ's didn't provide the good company, but I'm trying to stay positive here, OK? The Bad: -I ordered the California Burger *medium-rare* with their wedge-cut fries. The burger came out well-done and the sourdough bread was charred to the point that I felt like I was eating charcoal. Also, the fries were served cold, and that's just inexcusable for a place that's as busy as they are. The Ugly: -My wife ordered the Honey Lime Seared Scallops and it was truly, truly awful. The brown rice it came with was gummy and the scallops themselves were over-cooked and still had sand on them. Yes, sand! I wouldn't have believed it if my wife hadn't forced me to try them. I took a bite and sure enough there it was: the taste of the ocean you don't want. On the positive side, at least I got some fiber out of it. This dish was so bad that it actually prompted her to go speak with the manager and get the dish comped; first time she's done this in the 13+years I've known her! -The service really is as atrocious as advertised; I feel bad because our main server (whose name I forget) really seemed to be trying hard but I get the feeling that he's just surrounded by incompetence. Here's a list of their wrongdoings:   1) We ordered 3 appetizers to share: the Best Beginnings, Corn Fritters and Boneless Buffalo Wings. The first two came out after 20-minutes and the wings didn't arrive until everyone was half-way through their dinner. We were supposed to get the wings comped as well (Yay, wifey!) but they ended up comping us the fritters which was a $4 savings on their end. 2) Service was slow and spotty. They seemed amply staffed so I'm not sure what's the issue. It would take over 10-minutes for people to get a beer; at one point this one waitress comes over and hands someone a beer and says, ""I don't know what this is.Taste it and tell me if it's the right one"" Seriously?! Hey, wait-a-minute! Is that Allen Funt over there? 3) My wife and my buddy's wife both ordered side salads with their meals. Neither received them and yet we were charged for them anyways. We didn't realize this until we were already well on our way home and by then you just want to wash your hands of the whole thing. I was trying to be positive about coming here and justified the bad reviews as maybe just growing pains for a new restaurant. However, they've already been open 4-5 months and that should be plenty of time to right the ship. I've been to the BJ's at Oakridge Mall a few times and their service has always been hit-and-miss. I suspect there's something deeper at the corporate level and they need to reassess their training program because whatever they're doing ain't working. Unfortunately, I'm sure BJ's Corporate could care less. The place was packed and there was a throng of people outside waiting to get in as we left. As long as there are people willing to put up with second-rate food, good beer and terrible service then they're more than happy to continue doing what they do."
Elizabeth S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/22/2017,"We went to have diner tonight Rodrigo was the server. He was very nice and attentive also the food was very good but for the most part, I really like the way Rodrigo help us and treated us."
