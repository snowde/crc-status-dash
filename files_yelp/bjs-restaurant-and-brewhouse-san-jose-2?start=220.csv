Michelle A.,"San Jose, CA",467,162,41,1.0,1/19/2016,"Okay, I have been here not once, not twice, more than three, 1 more plus 4.... YES 5 TIMES!!! and every single time within the last 2 years have been HORRIBLE! Let me clarify... It's not the food, its the service!  They actually suck and have no clue on customer service.  It appears this place is run with twenty something and are more worried about being friends than managing a restaurant.  Yes, even the management falls short.   What is BJ's known for (the clean version)  their PAZOOKIES! one time I went there and the waiter gave us the check and never asked if we wanted dessert.  HELLO? Does it look like I WOULD PASS UP DESSERT?  NOPE!   Another time I repeatedly reminded the server of my missing beverage and at the end of the meal you FINALLY decide I might want me drink?   Last night we went there, other than the staff playing with each other by locking each other out the side door and then running around to get in.  Forget that I said I wanted to still look at the menu and I let you know and then you still take away the menu. and dismiss the fact that I ordered soup in a brad bowel and there was a very little amount of soup and all bread. Ohh and you never checked on us to see how everything was going.  No worries.  When you FINALLY come back I let you know I want to order the dessert and I want to pay for everything before the cookies get here because we needed to leave as soon as the cookies come.  YOU NEVER CAME BACK!  I then was running behind on getting where I had to go and then still waiting on YOU!  I got up and asked the receptionist to get the manager and instead he gets YOU! I asked for the manager.   I then tracked the manager and had explained my frustration.  COMMEN SENCE!  I said I wanted the tab paid so I can just go after and not have to wait! The manager then had to hear how annoying it was about the lack of attention, lack of soup and lack of following a simple request"
Miami S.,"San Francisco, CA",144,252,28,3.0,1/21/2016,Not that great. Very busy...line out the door....noisy...love the menu only because it lists calories and you will gag when you see the sky high calories on classic dishes. Tried it twice. C'est fini!
Michael V.,"San Jose, CA",60,80,,1.0,1/8/2016,Ordered a deep dish pizza take out with extra sauce and I begged the cashier like twice to make sure she put extra sauce on the order and she said yes.  I take the pizza home and there's seriously like half the amount of normal sauce.  I'm extremely frustrated and have 80 percent of a wasted pizza sitting here and I'm typing this review instead of eating it. I am that upset.  I will never order anything from here again. You had one chance.
Lucy P.,"San Jose, CA",0,28,7,1.0,11/12/2016,"Terrible service because it's snail-pace slow and there aren't enough waiters. Our appetizer didn't come out until our entrees did (what a waste!) and then when I got my burger it was missing aioli and tomatoes. It took an extra 15mins until I could get ahold of a waitress to tell her about my burger and by that time it was already cold. The actual burger meat was crumbly and tasteless. Overall, NOPE. it's just not worth it."
Gil C.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,1,2.0,5/14/2017,"Was truly dissapointed in this trip to bjs. Mt wife and i ordered a Mediterranean pizza,in hopes of trying something different.  We got different all right. First off the pizza wasn't even hot.  It seemed like a digiorno pizza with toppings added without being put in the oven.  It also had picjled pepperocini on it. That was a horrible taste on a pizza. And the dough was more like bread and nit like a thick crust pizza."
YH L.,"Redwood City, CA",77,72,177,3.0,4/22/2016,"After our last visit, and bad reviewed; The manager of the store of BJ's had contacted me.  My friend and I decided to give another try.  Both of us ordered steaks, medium rawer; then again the kitchen did not deliver to standard.  We had talked with Ronddy, who was the manager last night.  He had paid attention to our concern, and we had decided to order a different item from the menu; each of us had made a choice Salmon pre in different way; the fish were cook perfect with plenty of vegetable that complement it.  Our service was attentive and cordial too.  I will not recommend the steak however you should give a try to the other dishes."
Narasimha K.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/12/2017,"I am a regular at BJs Brewhouse and today was the worst experience that I had. We checked in at 955pm seated at 10pm and no one to wait on us till 1030pm. Ordered the food and no food till 1050 pm. The food was brought cold. Asked to talk to the manager and he talked about problems with how the night was busy and being short staffed. While I understand that this is is an internal operations problem, I feel let down as a customer. I have decided not to visit this location ever again. The attitude of the staff is a huge turn off."
Justin P.,"Santa Clara, CA",41,10,2,1.0,12/22/2015,"Takeout didn't workout so well... So after sitting at the bar for forty minutes to go my takeout order I failed to check the contents. One of my entrees was missing which I found out when I got home. So I drove back to BJs in holiday traffic to get a replacement. The sad sickly looks ng chicken breast they gave me looks like something out of a bad TV dinner. I love BJs food don't get me wrong, and the staff was super nice... But this is an embarrassment to food. The wife is not going to allow me to do takeout again which is a damn shame, I really like the beer there."
Brittany C.,"Folsom, CA",1274,253,2362,3.0,11/24/2014,"Like any other Bj's, always busy, slow service during Happy hour, and food is mediocre. This location opened not too long ago and during lunch, I must admit their menu is great! But during dinner time, you get what you pay for. The food is pretty bland, their beer is great, but only if you could just have your cake and eat it too! My waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there, or if he really just hated his job. Ordered a beer and he completely forgot about it, asked for it once more and it took at least 15 mins to get. As you can see I have mixed feeling about this place...."
Shauna S.,"Campbell, CA",420,240,621,2.0,2/3/2015,"Because BJ's is a chain restaurant, you may have expectations going in. I loved visiting other BJ's locations, so I had high expectations. The service was good, the host was very friendly, and our server was nice. However, everything else fell short. We ordered calamari to start, and I would definitely steer clear of this appetizer. It was soft and mushy, and should have been crunchy. I have a feeling it sat under the warmer for too long, instead of being brought directly to our table. It tasted as if it had been sitting out.  We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to share, and it also could have been better. There was little to no sauce on it at all, and the large chucks of tomato was odd with the little bbq sauce that there was on it. We asked for onions on only half, and when it was served, we couldn't even tell which half had the onions (so either there were none on either half, or they were hidden under the cheese). When the pizza was served, my friend asked for a side of ranch. It never came. Our server also never stopped back at our table until we were done eating the pizza (or we would have asked him again for the ranch). For a $40 meal for two, it just fell short. I wouldn't say I'd never come back, but with such good options in the Bay Area, this is not a place I'd waste my money on."
Vee L.,"San Jose, CA",558,267,127,2.0,11/28/2015,"I don't come here often, but when I do it's usually not that bad. The wait was really long, which is expected on a Friday night. I'll need to remind myself to not come here on a weekend or a night that might be busy. Service was really slow. Tables and floors were really dirty. We had to ask for multiple things a few times. They seemed understaffed, or our server had an really big section of the restaurant to himself. Food took a really long time, and he was too busy to acknowledge it or apologize. Pizookie took at least 20 minutes. I don't come here often, so I'm not sure how long a dessert usually takes, but I don't think it should take that long. We were here for almost 2 hours. The food was nothing special. Pizza was a little soggy for a thin crust. Calamari wasn't that crispy, and still soaked in oil. The best thing we got was the crispy thin fries. Maybe I'd come back for happy hour on a weekday, but definitely not wasting another Friday night here."
Ale X.,"Redwood City, CA",1,12,9,1.0,8/5/2016,"Only bc I can't give no stars. Had a party of 15 got here on time, and nothing  was ready. Was seated after about 20 mins, then it took another 20 mins and THREE people asking for a server. Server was by herself and super rude throughout the entire time. This is not good service at all and it is not our fault you guys didn't have anything together. Shame."
Mac C.,"San Jose, CA",6,67,62,2.0,12/29/2015,"Wow. The management at this place sucks. The food is just ok.  So I ordered a hamburger. Medium well. The waiter comes by 20 mins after we place our order and explains the kitchen is backed up and if he could bring a salad out for us. Wife said sure and he brought her a Caesar salad. Another 5 mins roll by and my wife gets her meal and I get mine. I look at my burger. Part of it is burnt. I cut it in half and it is well done and completely dry. Also my fries are cold. He takes it. Offers a salad on the house I state no thank you. 25 mins go by. No sandwich. Another five go by and then I receive it. And it is now perfect. The waiter offers to bring me a salad for the inconvenience ($6.95) I said no think you and ate my meal.  After I finished I though hell if they were offering a free salad and I declined it, I might as well see if they take the appetizer off (5.95) I ask the waiter. He informs the manager. He comes back and the states the manager said no. I informed him it's the same thing as offering the salad. If anything I'm saving them about a dollar. I tell him to go back and ask her again.  She comes out and starts interrogating me. She asked was your food ok? I said yes. The second time but that isn't the issue here. She just stared at me all smiling and not a genuine one at all. It was a conditioned response. Instead of just taking off the appetizer she chose to come interrogate me first ask me questions and then leave without telling me what the point of her questioning was and without telling me what she was going to do! This was highly unprofessional! She ended up taking the burger off, so the bill was about $24. I left a $10 tip. As I wasn't trying to get something for free. Just trying to ask for what was already offered, but they ended up taking up more time for nothing. Anyway I think the guy sincerely did a good job and he shouldn't be punished for what the kitchen did. The chef should have made sure my burger was correct the first time rather than have me sitting there for such a long time and then wasting even more of it at the end with all the back and forth... The manager here...man...she really needs to learn how to treat customers..."
Renee A.,"San Jose, CA",101,18,7,2.0,4/28/2017,"This is at least the 3rd time that we have experienced poor service here. My daughter and friends waited 45 mins for their food. They are still waiting for their dessert. One of the times our dessert was never brought. It's like they aren't equipped to deal with Weekend crowds?! And it's never acknowledged by anyone. Really sad, it was the place her friend wanted to go for her bday."
Alexzandria W.,"New Orleans, LA",67,5,,1.0,4/22/2017,Terrible. Refuses to put on the Warriors playoff game because we did not request the TV. Management was rude.
Michelle V.,"Seattle, WA",2939,929,876,4.0,12/18/2013,"I used to hit up BJ's a lot back in my high school days and early drinking years. Funny how BJ's is now back in my life now that they've opened up a couple here in the South Bay Area.  This BJ's is pretty much brand new so I think they really wanna do their best right now to impress their customers. We came in for a quick bite to eat one weekend afternoon and surprisingly was able to get seated right away without a wait (you can't get that at any Cheesecake Factory or Yardhouse in this area). I really liked our server. He was extremely attentive and on point. To be honest, he looked like he could have been working as an engineer somewhere nearby at a software company or something. Kid looked smart! :P I ordered myself just appetizers with a nice glass of...water! Didn't wanna start drinking in the middle of the day if I was already going out later that night. I really liked the Thai shrimp wraps I ordered. But I especially loved the corn fritters with bacon aioli! OMG! Anything with corn...I'd die for! Delicious! I had no room for a nice individual-sized pizookie for myself for dessert. But maybe next time I'll just order that as my meal since they are HUGE! ;)"
Ann L.,"Fremont, CA",391,3041,24550,2.0,10/10/2013,"Tried out the chain BJ's at this new Coleman Ave location near Target & Panera Bread. Got there about 4pm & tons of people in the bar for Happy Hr deals.  I should have checked it out, but instead got seated in the main dining room. I asked about the $20 special which is 2 salads or soup, 1 medium pizza to share, & 1 pizookie to share.  I picked for B. a wedge salad w/ blue cheese dressing on the side, I got Cesar Salad which was ok, nothing special, Pizza I picked was Spinach Artichoke deep dish - it was pretty bad.  Very doughy, no spinach really, just Yuck - skip it.  Chocolate chip chunk Pizookie is pretty good - I liked it. Charged the meal.  Separate bathrooms near the bar in front on the Right.  Women's had 4 stalls & trough sinks."
Amber M.,"Milpitas, CA",52,5,1,1.0,10/19/2016,The service is terrible no refills 45 minute wait people who came way later then me are eating and I'm still not. I mentioned it to the waiter he said our food is ready but waiting to come out . Great that means it's cold. Never again will I come here
Drea C.,"San Jose, CA",22,25,2,5.0,1/9/2016,You don't go to BJ's expecting amazing gourmet food. You expect good food and a BJ's atmosphere with great service. I'm giving this place five stars because the manager at this place is awesome. We had six kids with us and he was super nice to them and very helpful in making sure we got everything we ordered and were satisfied. He even came to specially congratulate my son for receiving an award at school which entitled him to a free meal at BJ's and gave him a special pin. Nice guy!! It was a busy Friday night so it's obviously loud and food took a while but nothing crazy. The price for kids meals is an amazing deal everything is under $6 and huge portions. And they can get healthy stuff! Seriously the kids meals are more than enough for an adult.  I had the Brussels sprouts and they were yummy and crispy! I also had some of my sons grilled chicken with broccoli and rice and it was great for kids food. The kids had fun playing hide and seek on the patio /courtyard between BJ's and Panera while waiting for their pizookies. And the baby enjoyed watching the planes fly overhead :)
Aletheia A.,"Lynnwood, WA",1,11,1,3.0,5/9/2016,"The food here is very good, as are the beverages.  The service, however, leaves much to be desired.  It was a beautiful day and we were on our last day of vacation before returning home so we asked to sit outside. Our request was graciously granted. So we sat. . . and sat. . . and sat. . . and waited. . . and waited. . . until finally we had to re-enter the restaurant and ask if we could please be served.  The server finally came and took our order, which was promptly served to us and was delicious.  She never came out again. We would've liked to have some ranch for the delicious wedge cut fries... but she didn't come out until we were completely finished with our meal. At that point she tried to sell us more beer, or a dessert, but we had had it.  Won't be back."
