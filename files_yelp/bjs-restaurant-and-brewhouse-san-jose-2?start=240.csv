Chris C.,"San Jose, CA",146,6,1,1.0,3/8/2016,"First of all, tried ordering curbside so we didn't have deal with waiting for a table and their slow service, but upon arriving, there were no curbside parking spots available. All the ""reserved"" parking spots were occupied by unattended vehicles. Secondly, our scheduled pickup time was at 6:15 and our order was delivered 15 minutes late. Mind you we ordered our food 30 minutes in advance. Thirdly, the worker then calls while I'm still waiting for my food and requests for me to park in the handicapped parking spot because he couldn't locate my vehicle. Very inconvenient for an attempted method of convenience to the ""pickup"" customer. The only good thing that occurred was when I asked if I could get a discount for their very inconvenient service and was rewarded with $10 off the total of my bill. Get your act together BJ's staff."
Lynh N.,"Mountain View, CA",34,198,213,4.0,3/6/2015,"So for this one, I got Deep Lasgana for my pasta entree. It's good but I'm not really a fan of that tomato sauce. Lessen the dark flavor. The cheese in the ravoli though! So scrumptious!  Then I had a salted caramel on top of vanilla ice cream for my pizookie. It's pretty good. You can feel the lovely flavor of the caramel. Yum to the tum! Love the environment with its yellow orange lights in a retangular shaped thing. So pretty. It was a lovely day to treat mi luv out for his belated birthday!"
Mariah T.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,4.0,5/5/2017,"Love BJ's pizza but unfortunately had two pizzas that didn't come out great, but the manager Erin was great and made sure we were taken care of. Customer service is everything. Even though the pizzas didn't come out like we hoped for, Erin made up for it and we'll be back. Kudos to her!"
Christine T.,"Danville, CA",4470,648,905,1.0,9/23/2014,"Oh boy--this was a bad one.  Keep in mind, I wasn't expecting much from previous visits to this chain, but actually being able to eat would've been nice!!  The picture of my french dip sandwich speaks volumes...I mean they didn't even try.....as you can see, the roll was burnt black and they knowingly still served it to me????  BJ's, BJ''s, BJ's, I'm speechless."
Gina H.,"San Jose, CA",103,142,305,2.0,2/23/2015,"All my past experiences at BJ's have been A-ok and I did not feel like I left unsatisfied about the service or food.  I came to this location because I think it's not as busy as the Oakridge Mall or Cupertino location. We got seated earlier than our estimated wait time so that was appreciated.  Unfortunately I felt the service and food was not up to par.  I ordered a deep dish pizza and mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I specifically remember telling our server that I wanted to ""start"" with the mozzarella sticks cause my boyfriend and I were already hungry.  Instead, we get our mozzarella sticks the same time as our pizza. I'm already annoyed cause now it's gonna be hard to finish all the mozzarella sticks cause we have this pizza in front of us too. I was even more annoyed because the mozzarella sticks were not warm nor crispy as I remember them to be. I always get the mozzarella sticks at BJ's cause they're that good to me and I was a bit disappointed that they did not taste the same. It seemed like the appetizer was probably sitting under the food lamp/light/heater thingy while the pizza was cooking so they could bring out the food at the same time, which is something I clearly did not want.  On top of this, our server was rushing us to leave. He refilled our water only because I asked if I could get more water. Then he asked if we wanted dessert when we weren't even done with our pizza! Dropped off the check when we just started eating our Pizookie. He came by a few minutes later and asked if the bill was ready and it was not.  I was very annoyed that our server tried to rush us multiple times throughout our meal. Hope I never have to go through that again."
Samantha S.,"San Jose, CA",103,2,1,1.0,10/26/2016,"I placed an order tonight from Bj's to get dinner . Upon receiving my delivery which was fine , I got my food and found a rubber band in my salad . Needless to say it was disgusting and ruined my dinner . Also the pizza I ordered looked like someone put a foot in it . experience is very disappointing. Will not be ordering from here ever again ."
Linda P.,"Kansas City, MO",135,286,1188,3.0,12/6/2014,"I've been to the Cupertino and Oakridge locations many times in the past.  Although a little reluctant to try this Coleman location tonight I gave it a shot for the main reason that this location is more convenient of a meeting spot for my girl friend and myself. Parking was decently easy as this BJs is on the outskirts of the plaza and the businesses nearby it was already closed around 7:40pm when I was looking for a spot.  The wait for 2 people was 20-25minutes pretty similar to the other BJ locations. Other reviews made me wary of the food and either my taste buds have changed or my standards have or this location isn't as great as the others.  I had the enlightened chicken pesto sandwich which was a new item.  I have to say it was just ok.  The salad part tasted like it wasn't cleaned all the way and there was absolutely no dressing for it,  I had to use the sauce from the mini bruschetta to have some sort of flavor to make the dirt like greens go down easier.  The sandwich itself I would say is good IF they had put more cheese or sauce.  The chicken portion I wish was a little more to cover the whole slice of bread but I can understand for cost reasons why it might not be an option.   But why not add more sauce or even greens the amount on the sandwich was sad.  The menu says there is basil pesto and garlic aioli and I just saw a smear of pesto and another yellow color on the sourdough which I presume was aioli.  The sandwich needed a kick of more sauce for flavor as it was bland.  I ended up taking half the sandwich home and asked for some garlic aioli to go home but sadly when I got home I realized the waitress gave me Ranch.  How can ranch be the same as garlic aioli?? Disappointment  My friend had ordered the mini bruschetta to share and the honey lime scallops I was happy to see that the scallop dish looked like they offered a good portion of scallops and I believe she was ok with it she ate half.  As far as the bruschetta goes it was very hard small chunks of focaccia bread with a mild sprinkle of cheese and tomatoes, it definitely could've had more to it, especially when the bread was pretty hard and a thick thick slice.  Usually if the bruschetta is hard the slice is thinner. Funny thing is some waiter came by gave us 2 plates and said our appetizer was on its way.  A minute later our entrees came and no appetizer to be found halfway into our entrees the appetizer arrived.   Though I did find it odd to be told one thing is coming, but something else comes instead,  I think they need to perfect the timing.  If no one said anything about appetizers coming we wouldn't be concerned or care about the timing and would've carried on our conversation. The pizookie we ordered came out yummy, but I did question one thing I felt the inside of the cookie tasted more doughy and less cooked than I remember.  I wish I got the ice cream on the side since it helped mask the undercookness."
M K.,"Campbell, CA",0,119,13,3.0,9/10/2016,"Their weekday lunch specials are nicely priced. Service is slow, so if you're in a hurry, let them know. Don't come here for happy hour. There are no special happy hour prices, really. Just $1 off drinks, and $2 off food. Went here for the first time for happy hour, and won't be back. Chili's next door has better Happy Hour prices."
Wen C.,"San Jose, CA",601,287,124,2.0,5/13/2016,I was really disappointed in how the quality of food has gone down the s$@thole here. The calamari was drenched in oil and the batter was falling apart even before we picked it up. Our fried chicken plate and BBQ brisket burger was beyond greasy. Portions are not as big as they used to be. The waitress was nice but it took way to long to get a couple of Jamisons on the rocks. I guess the only thing they have going for them is that they open till midnight and have a nice dining area. I won't be coming back any time soon.
Emily A.,"San Jose, CA",4,31,6,1.0,12/21/2015,"Walking in should have been an indicator of service. My mother and I came here for lunch (12-21). My mother is handicap, she uses a cane since she can't use her left side. The guy at the hostess area asked if we would like to sit at the bar (which has steps) seriously?!?  Said no, they put us closer (wow! A concept!!) annnnd it just kept going down from there  40 mins waiting for lunch. Nothing difficult a roast beef sandwich for me and potstickers for my mom. We asked for the Santa Fe dipping sauce, 5 mins later the waitress drops it off but places it behind the ketchup and out of the reach of my mom who can't use her left side. Not too mention a bunch of other tables around us were waiting for their food just as long.  For being so new, this one is by far the worse in the area."
Donovan T.,"San Jose, CA",694,630,562,2.0,1/30/2015,"This particular location is smaller then Cupertino and Oakridge but what it has going for it: it's not attached to a mall (Oakridge) so wait times aren't as bad and it actually has tons of parking (Cupertino). The Marketplace is my ultimate one stop shop for errands, so it's actually a great location. Anyways going back to my dining experience, quality is off. For a chain restaurant to have inconsistent tasting food is no bueno. My last visit, I had the Great White Pizza and it just didn't taste right. Pizza wasn't also piping hot when it arrived. It tasted as if it was left out for a good 15-20 minutes before arriving to my table. And what's the point of bringing out some ranch sauce AT THE END of the meal?  I'm glad the service is better then the Oakridge Mall location (which is a HORRIBLE) but I probably won;'t be back here especially when there are so many better restaurants in the near by areas. (San Pedro Square)"
Bryson L.,"San Jose, CA",490,902,228,2.0,11/16/2015,"The service here is in dire need of work.  BJ's training program must be horrible.  While common among all of their chains I'd say, this one is pretty much the same.   Service: Hosts and hostesses are horrible at seating people.  They always seem to take their time, and call out names at a normal audible level instead of trying to yell out the name over the noise of their restaurant.  It's ridiculous that they don't just resort to the buzzers (they have them, but won't always use them).  Once seated our table had no dining utensils, and no one noticed until we got our food.  At which point the bus boy got them for us (nicest guy in this restaurant).  One thing that always bugs me here too is how when they refill your root beer, a majority of the time they'll take the glass away still filled with some root beer leaving me without a drink until they come back.  They ought to bring a new glass then take the old one away (once empty or not, I don't care, just leave the glass).  On a recent visit, the waitress also asked us if we wanted to look at the dessert menu minutes after our entrees had arrived.  She also forgot the bill when we had asked for it (we were waiting around for a while til she checked up on us again).   Food: The food here is decent, it's just a bit overpriced.  I would only come for lunch or dinner.  Their pizzas and pastas are pretty safe bets.  Same for the appetizers.  I'd avoid the brunch though.  Did not enjoy it. Drinks and Desserts: I've had hit and miss service with the drinks.  The communication between the bartenders and our waitress caused me to get the wrong order (ordered 3 different shots, got all of the same shot).  But they do offer a variety of beers and such.  I really like the beers where they'll combine 2 together. All in all, this place suffices as a decent hangout spot, but the service is poor."
Jay U.,"Fullerton, CA",14,2,,1.0,12/1/2016,Ordered just one Pizza and a pizookie.. waited more than 90 minutes!! Managers and workers not responding well.. Please don't waste your time for an average type of food !!
Jake Jayzon L.,"Hollister, CA",25,2,2,5.0,2/27/2016,Food was cooked perfectly and delivered in a timely manner. Tasted great. Beer was refreshing. Server attentive and polite. Overall a solid lunch experience.
Celine L.,"San Jose, CA",22,225,341,2.0,8/19/2015,"The only thing worth coming to this place for is for the Pazookie and drinks. I took my boyfriend here for lunch and unfortunately we were very disappointed. The waitress was nice and seated us outside upon request. However, my boyfriend ordered the 5 Meat Deep dish pizza and I ordered the housetop sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes and shoestring fries. All of our food was cold and seemed as if it had been left out. Wtf?! Not to mention the sirloin steak I ordered was burned when I had asked for it to be medium rare. Not wanting to be a hassle, we decided not to say anything about it. The fries and potatoes were cold and we were unimpressed. Don't bother coming here for lunch. On the bright side, we ordered the Salted Caramel Pazookie and it was delicious!! Otherwise waste of money...."
Kavya T.,"Chicago, IL",397,318,823,3.0,10/11/2015,"This location has outdoor seating so that's a + for me! Took a little too long to get our lunches out, even though there wasn't much of a crowd. I would understand if it was dinner but people usually have to get back to work on weekdays..."
Ben L.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,3/12/2017,Ashley Bravo was our server and she was super sweet and attentive. She was smiling the whole time and made her guests feel welcomed.
Christina L.,"San Jose, CA",294,61,52,5.0,7/17/2016,"Great service from gennesaret! My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and was greeted by her right away, she suggested a beer and it was delicious. We come to bjs when we are in the area and out of all the servers Genna was awesome! Very bubbly and friendly! We are definitely requesting her to be our server from now on!"
Eric M.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,3,1,5.0,9/11/2016,Adriana Our server was amazing she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer selection and suggested I get a piranha which did not disappoint. her customer service was great and was very patient when I had trouble deciding what I wanted. And kept our waters full and made sure we got everything we needed very quickly. When we come back to bjs I hope to get adriana as our server again over all experience was great thank you adriana.
Cassandra C.,"Oakland, CA",131,221,,3.0,7/21/2015,"We were seated for about 15 minutes without attention. Then Samantha G. realised that whoever was actually supposed to serve that area wasn't going to do it and stepped in. She was cordial and efficient taking our orders and getting drinks.   We ordered a standard burger and unlimited soup and salad.  The delicious clam chowder and adequate wedge salad arrived 25 minutes before the burger. I was waiting to dig in until my companions meal arrived but was told no, eat now! We were eventually told that the burger was delivered to another table and they were grilling a new one.  Samantha even offered to bring another soup and salad (free) for my friend and but the runner brought 2 bowls of soup instead.   Finally the burger arrived and was fine, but nothing to wait 40 minutes for. . . SMH.   Sometimes things happen.  Someone is new in the kitchen or didn't show for a shift, there are missed communications, mishaps, mistakes and more.  It happens.  This would have been a complete mess if it weren't for our server, Samantha G.  She got us taken care of, had something removed from the bill, and never acted like they WERE doing a great job or our requests were a problem.  What BJ's needs is more employees like Samantha.  Give her a raise, already."
