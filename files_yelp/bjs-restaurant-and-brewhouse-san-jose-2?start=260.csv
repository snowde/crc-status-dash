Gita r.,"San Francisco, CA",198,261,274,4.0,12/28/2015,"We usually go to this BJ's because the one near DeAnza is ridiculous... Also this one is closer to my parents house. The parking here is sooo much better than any other BJ's in the area. I haven't had bad experiences with horrible wait time estimates, but I do know it gets busy and I've had that issue with other locations. I like that I can get quality gluten free food here. Though it's no deep dish pizza ( which I love and miss here), the pizza is still good - though expensive because any toppings on a cheese pizza cost $1 more for each).  But thank goodness for hh, because these pizza fall under it.  My brother and dad shared the buffalo chicken deep dish small pizza which I think is the best too. My mom got a personal deep dish veg pizza and loved it, and it really was the perfect size for her. We usually get avocado rolls but we figured we had enough food tonight. The beers are wonderful, but I have to say I always get a mix of negative and positive experiences with the margaritas. Tonight I got the watermelon basil margarita which was horrible on so many levels, but I did get some Sprite and soda to get it less sweet, but still I would recommend to stay away from it. Lastly we ended off with a gluten free pazookie... Tastes just like the regular one! I just wish they extended more of the other flavors to the gf menu like the salted caramel;)."
Tom S.,"San Jose, CA",3,3,,2.0,11/10/2015,"We used to go there a lot. We are both Vegetarian and I'm Gluten free. They have a good gluten free crust for their pizza. However, they frequently mess up our order. Last night takes the cake. I got what I ordered but she got Pepperoni instead of peperoncini (green peppers) as an add-on on her vegetarian pizza, Our waiter was great but he was the only one working in the Bar seating area, so it took a long time to get our food the first time. We talked to our waiter and he re-ordered the pizza. After it came, she was eating it and found a piece of sausage. YIKES. After examining it, we found a piece of chicken in it too.  So we made a big fuss. the waiter and manager were apologetic and said the kitchen staff was being lax. But, they had straightened them out. I was done eating so we asked for a THIRD pizza to go. The manager said he watched them make it to be sure there was no cross contamination. Well, you guessed it - that pizza had a piece of ham in it when she ate it the next day. Clearly something was seriously wrong in their kitchen. We are now looking for other good Gluten free and vegetarian pizza in town. It will be a while before we go back. Confidence destroyed....."
Nora B.,"Rio Vista, CA",14,21,4,1.0,2/12/2017,"What a total let down! OK, it was Saturday evening and hubby and I expected a wait. We were informed wait time would be approximately 20 minutes; no problem there. Almost 40 minutes later, we decided to ask how much longer, especially as so many people who arrived after us were already enjoying their food; no they did not all have reservations.  We were seated 5 minutes later and waited almost 15 minutes before waiter arrived. We ordered drinks and food immediately, as we had an event to attend. I was somewhat amazed it took soooooooo long to pour a Diet Coke and sparkling water.  Drinks eventually arrived and then food. Hubby had ahi tuna salad, which he enjoyed. I had pulled pork sandwich, which was ok. Waiter asked if we would like another drink. My hubby asked for another soda. Waiter approaches our table with drink; oh no, not for our table. Oh, here he comes again. Oh no, not for our table again. These drinks were refills for people seated approximately 20 minutes after us. I was going to catch waiter's attention, but hubby told me not to bother. Hubby beckoned waiter and gave him our card, as we did not wish to be there awaiting check and spending more wasted time. He also informed waiter we had event to attend. Conclusion? Last time for us; very bad service!"
Jay J.,"Chicago, IL",1,7,,5.0,9/25/2016,"A very nice place with a variety of fresh beers. Ambience is really good, friendly staff, value for money. An ideal place to hangout with friends."
Micaela B.,"San Jose, CA",146,33,8,2.0,10/26/2015,"I ordered my food online & got it to go. First of all, we waited quite a while just for the lemonade, I could see my food just sitting in the to go bag. My mini Great White deep dish pizza was decent. Pizookie trio (triple choc, white macadamia, peanut butter) was terrible, they were all burnt & hard. Chicken tenders (kids meal) was super salty, fries were literally reheated, you could taste how stale they were, and the included drink (strawberry lemonade) wasn't cold. Honey mustard container wasn't filled all the way & only given one. Basically, don't order online."
Donovan L.,"Milpitas, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/9/2017,"The wait staff here is absolutely horrible lmfao, you walk in and there's practically a wait just to be acknowledged. Fire the hostesses and get better ones cause they suck lol the take out girl too fire her, I promise it'll get better."
James G.,"San Jose, CA",21,218,46,1.0,8/1/2015,"Lame. Saw two San Jose Officers dining there. We picked up their check and left a tip but their waiter still took their money!  So pissed off, I will never be back."
Rudy J R.,"San Jose, CA",41,38,49,1.0,7/23/2015,"Experienced a very poor dinner with two friends. We placed our orders and waited close to thirty minutes for our food - one dinner took another fifteen minutes. The server, Frank B., brought one order incorrectly and we eventually had it corrected - only we had to get it to go because two of us had already finished our dinners. I had to go to the bar twice to get refills for our lemonades because the server, Frank B., never returned to our table to check on his. He did not even check with us to see if our food was ok. We called a manager and told him about our experience. When we received our check, we were doubled charged for one dinner and had to have it removed. Not a single employee or manager at the restaurant apologized to us for our poor experience."
Gui A.,"San Jose, CA",380,50,61,1.0,7/14/2015,"Food and service here are absolutely a joke! I mean, really bad!  Restaurant was almost empty and still 25 min to get a second beer and soda refills after ordering it-- not even an apology from the waitress  Be careful with the skinny Asian waitress w glasses. Run!!!"
Dana G.,"Hamilton, Canada",1,138,4,1.0,12/15/2016,Worst BJ's yet.  Dough was not good and undercooked.  Service was friendly but overwhelmed.  Bathrooms were gross.  Fail.
Ashley N.,"San Jose, CA",195,97,64,1.0,11/1/2015,"I'm not a huge fan of BJ's but my family does come every so often to switch it up from our usual dinner date spots. I've done happy hour here too and was pleased with the food and drinks before. This last visit was the absolute worst.  First, my husband is on crutches and they tried to put us at a table in a walkway. Hello, you can see him on crutches clearly he's hurt so why would you put him somewhere where people walking by might bump into him and hurt him more?! I had to ask for a booth.  Then, our waiter was really pushy about getting our order in. In case you didn't realize, your menu is like a freakin novel, give me some time please. And he kept pushing us to order drinks or appetizers. We said no thank you. You're a server. Not a used car salesman. Calm the eff down.  Then, my husbands wedge salad was drenched in blue cheese. He couldn't even eat half of it. No one cared to ask how it was and just wisked it away once he appeared to be done with it.  Then, my sons order was wrong. He was served sliders and weird happy face potatoes. He ordered a burger and fries from the kids menu and it made no mention of the burger being sliders with quarter sized patties. Not to mention my food was under whelming. I had shrimp and asparagus pasta. Some of the asparagus and shrimp were so over cooked/old I couldn't chew through it, which explains why it was covered in sauce. And my husbands ""pepperoni"" pizza had no visible pepperoni.  Lastly the check. The server charged us over $20 for this simple pepperoni pizza with olives and basil. The menu said $14. Then server explains that we are charged per topping. If you're going to charge per topping then at least put a visible amount of it. And since when it cheese and sauce a ""topping"" on pizza? Isn't that a standard pizza ingredient?!  This is the perfect example as to why tipping should not exist. Servers only care about the amount of the bill and the amount of their tip, not about the people dining or providing good customer service. Shitty food and shitty service. We will not be coming here again."
Katherine C.,"Fremont, CA",634,346,1964,2.0,10/21/2013,"We came here for Happy Hour for some team bonding time. I ordered a wildberry mojito from the bar. The service was really friendly, but I did not enjoy my drink at all. It tasted like it was doubled in sweetness. It took me the whole 2 and half hours we were there to finish the drink. We ordered several mini deep dish pizzas, boneless chicken pieces, lettuce cups, among other things. They were all fairly cheap. The portions weren't too small for HH, except the boneless chicken--which looked incredibly sad and small on the plate.  It wasn't busy when we got there, Monday night around 5:30PM. It got busy after 6 and there were so many servers on the floor running around. The food came out very slowly.  Though it was nice checking out the new BJ's, I don't think I'll be coming back. I've only gone to any BJ's restaurant maybe 2 or 3 times? I'm just not fond of the food."
Cuervo R.,"San Jose, CA",35,114,,4.0,9/15/2016,"Skimming some of the reviews, it seems like this location has some issues with consistency. But I've been to several others before, and always had at least a 3-star time. Last weekend was my first time at this location, and my best BJ's experience yet (didn't mean that as a joke, but I'll take it). Plenty of parking for Saturday dinner service, good space & atmosphere. Service was good overall, food & drinks were really, surprisingly good. I like to go along with a place's theme if I can stand it. But I just wasn't in the mood for beer at the brewhouse. Lucky for me BJ's has a nice selection of signature drinks besides beer. So I tried one of their crafted cocktails (black cherry something or other), followed by their cranberry cider. Both great choices. Our group got sliders & pizza to share, which were yummy. I also got maybe the best Caesar salad I've ever had, and the jambalaya I was craving. This is worth a special mention -- Caesar salad is not rocket science, and I've tried a bunch of 'em. Most of 'em are fine, nothing earth-shattering on the bad or good side. Some places really get it right, others really get it wrong. It's such a safe, simple dish I'm always amazed when I find a real standout. How do you make it taste so much better than the rest? How the hell do you manage to screw it up, let alone charge $$ for it?? Whatever BJ's does, lots of other places should be taking notes (Beach Chalet, I'm talking to you!). We had a really good time. I hope they can keep up the good work..!"
Elysia M.,"Portland, OR",163,353,1322,3.0,11/24/2014,"This BJs was okay. THe restaurant atmosphere was great, very clean and warm the only thing is that it's so dim inside that it is hard to see and it is really hard to see the menu. I am a young person with good eyes and I had to hold the menu close to my face because the shadows in the place made me feel like i was blind!  The food was great. I have eaten at several BJs and this one's food wasn't bad. I had a salad and my boyfriend had a sandwich. All of which was great even the wedge fries were cooked just right. The servic eon the other hand.. one of the worst services I've had at BJs. The front person taking down our name and number of guests in our party was very sweet and great. THe ladies that escorted us to the table were rude and when I had asked them a question, brushed me off like I wasn't worth anything. The girl that took our order was nice, but once she realized we weren't going to spend much money she only came back to give us our check. The thing that sucked the most was that it took over 35 minutes for our food to come. The table next to us ordered at the same time (with the same waitress) and ordered much more complicated food than ours and got their food about 25 minutes before we did. Overall, good food, but bad service."
Gregory W.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,4,2.0,8/22/2015,"Yes, 2 star equals 'Meh, I've experienced better'. Yes. I have, yet, I'll just say I was the not so smart one to order a burger at BJ's because I guess they don't respect cook temperatures or they were just too busy to give the effort. All in all, the double bison burger was good, but way over cooked. I mean, ya, maybe with the photo you could see some pink tint, but come one, if it was a decent 'bison', you would be prompt to under cook it right? In order to not ruin the burger, right? But whatever, ya, my fault for the burger. I'll stick to the pork chop even though I have to educate each and every server there that I can select a meat temperature other then hockey puck aka well done. I get it medium or med rare if they allow it; just hit or miss. I will still come back."
Marie C.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,The worst service ever maybe poor Mgmt plenty of empty seats but not coordinated.  Sat down after 25 min wait when told wait would be 10-15 min after a Sharks game!  Got tea no sugar asked for sugar food came quick but still the worst service ever.  Not servers fault but Mgmt should schedule more people to work.
Bryan M.,"San Jose, CA",9,69,6,3.0,10/12/2015,Long wait time but otherwise friendly staff. Pizookies aren't so great (really small).
Dop T.,"San Jose, CA",1,73,31,1.0,5/19/2016,"Ordered ONE burger using their premier rewards online system. Checked in at the ""take-out"" station. Guess they just *accepted/realized* the order when I told them I placed an online order. I was made to sit for more than 30 minutes. I went and enquired and guess what..The lady left as her shift got over I think and the next person had no idea about my order. Received my online order after 45 minutes of wait in the restaurant!! Ugh.. Horrible customer service. Way to go BJs.."
Penelope G.,"San Jose, CA",33,6,4,1.0,7/21/2015,"Worst service our waitress literally went and sat in her car and didn't attend to us. We didn't get plates, napkins, or utensils, we had to get up and get these things ourselves. We had to ask for something THREE times before receiving it! I wasn't even offered a water refill."
Nicole K.,"Aiea, HI",149,65,112,5.0,9/15/2015,Great lunch specials and a large selection to chose from. All kinds of food and drinks at a good price. I got the soup and pizza lunch special for under $8 and the arugula and beet sandwich. Surprising it was served with yellow Beets which were quite tasty. I've been here a couple times and it never disappoints
