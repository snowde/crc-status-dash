Trang B.,"San Jose, CA",163,585,82,4.0,8/2/2014,"Maybe it was a slow day, maybe i had good luck, maybe other people just suck. Regardless, my service was really good! My water was filled, the waiters were friendly and attentive without being ass kissers. Went for happy hour. Wasn't particularly impressed with the happy hour menu so we ordered some things off of it and some small bites. Spinach and artichoke dip: Average..... More artichoke and cream than spinach. Bruschetta: It comes with a pesto sauce. I didn't really like the focaccia  type bread it was on, but I liked it a lot overall. Corn fritters: Unique. It was fritters with a spicy chipotle, bacon, and corn. You kind of need to swirl it around and assemble it yourself. Sliders: Boring. Sliders with pickles, lettuce and ketchup. Comes with 2. And fries. Summary: Food was mostly average, prices were good, portions were exactly the price you pay for, unlike Yardhouse where they're massive, and service was good. I left happy hour happy, without having to be liquored up. Gasp."
Alicia L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",126,35,13,1.0,6/21/2016,"Both times I have been to this BJ's, they have the slowest service ever. Slow waiters, slow kitchen, and bad management."
Anne F.,"Milpitas, CA",24,42,16,4.0,6/24/2016,"We got lucky! Got seats for about 12 peeps without making any reservations. Food was okay, had big serving of sides. Wait staff was the best!!! The reason for the 4 stars!  Will be back!"
Alexandra W.,"Porterville, CA",0,5,2,1.0,9/3/2016,"Came to this BJ's before the Coldplay concert. I knew it was a mistake when I tried checking in on the app, only to be told that they didn't have anything under my name. Showed them the confirmation on my phone and the hostess just shrugged, then blamed it on their IT department. Food was okay- deep dish ravioli was bland. Took forever to get the bill, then when the waiter brought back my credit card he said their credit card system was down and they weren't sure if my card was charged so I needed to wait. Meanwhile, time is ticking for us to get to our concert. He came back 15 minutes later and asked for my credit card again to run manually since their system still wasn't working. I asked if they were sure I wasn't being charged twice- his response was to make sure to check my credit card statement. What a joke- how is this place still in business??"
Bryan F.,"San Jose, CA",27,40,1,5.0,7/6/2016,"First let me say I usually avoid this type of restaurant.  I prefer the smaller foodie type places. But this place is special, they actually care about costumer service, the management is very responsive and go out of their way to make things right!  I'm also always pleased that 9 out of 10 servers I've had (I do go here 2-3 times a month) are excellent!"
Topher H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",273,34,19,1.0,7/3/2016,"First server went out of his way to be rude.  After asking Rachel the manager to switch servers, she comped our meal.  However, the service got worse from there.  Drink refill came back with a tomato in the soda, the pizza was ice cold and not what was ordered, and the replacement server was WAY inattentive.  Not only worst BJ's Brewhouse, but restaurant!"
Cathy N.,"San Jose, CA",347,53,263,2.0,10/24/2015,It was quick because the actually check the wait list for us and put us in. We asked our waiter a question he didn't even answer it for us. They are very slow on service and we waited so long for our beer. Food want that great salmon was too dry.
Katy J.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,"This restaurant is by far the worst location ever. I been here at least 10times and each time something is always wrong. Service is way toooo slow so if you have time to waste go there. Oh yeah and the service sucks. Our server was Anthony. He's really nice but he needs to find a different job. Serving isn't his calling. I order a steak medium well to only get medium raw. I let him know my steak was wrong and of course he said he will fix it. Oh but my boyfriend has his food, he ate all his food before my new steak arrive. He did return to our table and he kind of shrugg off the fact my steak wasn't even at the table like it was the kitchen fault but really is.. he decides to bring my boyfriend ice cream real quick. When it finally arrive my boyfriend already had desert. I ask for a take out box not only did I not get one, my steak was wrong again because for some brilliant reason ANTHONY rung it in wrong not only once but twice. I decided this was officially the last time I tried this location. I never have these problem at the blossom hill location. Luckily the manager took care of our whole bill, but still that service and server is ridiculous beyond belief.  If you want free food and bad service go there ask for Anthony."
April T.,"San Jose, CA",34,20,,2.0,10/6/2015,"Went here for dinner with my friends over the weekend... we weren't impressed.  We show up around six and ask for a table for four, but the wait time was over 40 minutes. We waited around outside for a good twenty to thirty minutes until our table was ready. Luckily it wasn't 45 minutes that we had to wait, but it still took forever. Our waitress was a nice woman; she asked us how our evening was going and even complimented my friend on her dress. She said she would be right back with out waters, yah that was a lie. We sat there for another good ten minutes without a clue as to where she went. Eventually she came back with our waters and we were finally ready to place an order: I got the glazed salmon with a classic vinaigrette salad on the side and a pale ale IPA.  Surprisingly the food didn't take too long to get to us, but I didn't enjoy it very much at all. The salmon was for sure farm raised and tasted more fishy than it should have, not to mention the portions are not the biggest. The salad I had was actually really good, a little under dressed, but that's alright with me. The IPA was a little flat also, but still tasted fine I guess. About half of my friends liked their meal and other half (including me) didn't. All in all, BJ's has a lot of areas it could improve on. I'll probably not be stopping by here again any time soon, just not worth it in my opinion."
Eva E.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/22/2017,"Sat at the bar tonight and got amazing service from the bar staff! Chris and Ryan were on top of my drinks. Every time I visit this location, I head straight to the bar and receive great service each time. Will be back!"
Goldie V.,"Campbell, CA",124,8,1,5.0,6/26/2016,"The service here the handful of times we have been since it opened has been pretty terrible. A few waiters/waitresses told us there have been management changes though and they are trying to bring it back up to par. We had Eduardo tonight as a server and the server and he has been amazing! He's been super attentive, personable and he didn't miss a thing. Best service we have ever had here by far. Management-- give this guy a raise!"
Raghuveer P.,"North San Jose, San Jose, CA",4,2,,1.0,1/7/2017,"The worst BJ's ever. I've been to lot of other location and pretty happy with BJ's food and beer. But this particular location is the worst of all. I ordered chicken tortilla soup bowl but they served something even less than the size of a cup. We also ordered Santa Fe salad and it has literally 5 small pieces of chicken. I also felt that quantity was less in general as compared to other BJ's location. For our leftover when I asked a to go bag, they gave me some used BJ's bag as if they are reusing it. If they want to charge me $0.10 per bag, I'm okay to pay it but please don't give me used bag. I don't know what all was kept in it and if it's even hygienic to use this used bag. Not coming here again. I would rather drive to Cupertino or Newark but not this one."
Karen M.,"San Jose, CA",9,26,85,1.0,6/5/2016,needs to state location when taking phone orders. I called Coleman location thinking it was Oakridge and I was told at oakridge that this happens a lot for orders and reservations so just a tip for everyone. it's a major inconvenience
Peter F.,"Villa Park, CA",0,5,1,2.0,5/6/2016,"My pazookie was folded in half...my last one was burnt. 2.5 stars sounds about right. Seems like some staff care, but most dont. Save yourselves."
Cerelia C.,"San Jose, CA",97,11,11,4.0,8/17/2014,"I believe that this BJ's location was just fine tonight. I thought tonight would have been slow because it was raining outside, but it was actually quite busy. I was seate"
Kritter V.,"Santa Cruz, CA",27,225,5,2.0,7/24/2015,"Seated 20 minutes with no one asking if we wanted a beverage.  I finally had to call someone over and the girl gave us attitude as though to say, ""How dare you ask me to do my job.""  it was not that busy, either. Food was blah.  I had the cherry glazed salmon.  It was very dry and flavorless. The quinoa was pretty decent."
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,4.0,5/25/2015,"Really crowded, and a smaller BJ's compared to other locations. Bar was empty later on a Saturday evening, and drinks were quick and on point. Clean and great location to have drinks and good food!"
Serena S.,"San Jose, CA",146,82,154,2.0,9/5/2015,"I've come to this Bj's nearly three times and still experienced mediocre (if that) service.  The first time I ever came to the Bj's at this location was for my friend's birthday dinner. We were a party of about 10, and we came in about 8:30/9pm. The hostess told us it would be about a 20-30 minute wait. An hour later, we STILL weren't seated. I get it, a big party is a big party. But why tell us 20-30 if we're going to be waiting around for an hour?  At around 9:50/10 we were finally seated, but it didn't even look too busy inside. We finally ordered and it took forever to get our food. The food didn't even come all at once, either. After 30 minutes just one person got their food. We kept asking our server repeatedly for how long it would take, and he never had an answer. The food wasn't anything special (to be honest I don't even remember what I got) and the whole time i was just thinking about how much money I'm wasting at this place. At this point, we just wanted the check. You think they could do that right? But no. We asked probably 3 different employees for the check. Just that took probably 20 minutes! By the time we were done there was nearly no other customers in the restaurant. I don't know if they were understaffed, or the servers were just clueless and new, but either way you could tell how poorly managed this place was. I don't think it was really the waiters fault, and I don't want to blame them but the management in general was just really really bad. Okay, the second time I came to this place was because my group of friends wanted a pizookie for dessert. I was skeptical about this place of course but it was a weekday night and the 6 of us were seated right away. All we ordered was a trio platter with two original and one cookies a cream. 10 minutes later, they come out with the wrong order, nice :-(. We only ordered one thing and it came out wrong!  I understand how things can get mixed up and I'm not rude about it at all, buuut all I can think about is how things never really seem to go as planned here, lol.  The pizookie was DELICIOUS if you know Bj's. I think that's what gives them 2 stars in itself. So this experience was better then the first but still, meh.  The third time I came here was last night. it was a Friday night so I expected it to be a little busy, but I didn't want to wait because I was so hungry. It was just me and one other person. We walked in and just saw the employees standing around that little table thing where the hostess is supposed to check you in. We waited there for probably 2 or 3 minutes before anyone even said anything to us. I was so confused, like wait did I go to the wrong place? Like aren't you guys supposed to acknowledge us walking into the restaurant.... Anyways, the lady says hi to us and tells us it's going to be a 20 minute wait for two people.  That's my cue to leave. I would've stayed if I didn't have that awful first experience of waiting for an hour. And I really didn't want to waste another hour waiting for my food.  I don't write that many bad reviews so I hope you know I'm being honest! There are plenty of other restaurants in downtown that could satisfy your cravings, and if you really want that pizookie just get it for takeout :-)"
Anh N.,"San Jose, CA",159,132,931,5.0,7/11/2015,I really love it here! Servers are always nice and attentive. I love that it's a great spot to watch sports. Their happy hour is amazing! The food is great! Beers are delicious. And Absolut is their well vodka! I just wish the bar area was bigger it they are ice enough most times to open happy hour up in the regular dinning area. My favorite is their mac n cheese. I get it every time. Pizza is always good. Not a fan of their sliders. Saw the Warriors win it here! Nice people here.
Charmaine P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,23,2,1.0,6/5/2016,If you love to use ur premium rewards this place IS THE WORST PLACE TO USE IT! I love Bjs restaurants!! This is the very first time i got really annoyed! The food was good no complain but our server( old light lady) i guess her name was kathryn.. I asked her if i could use my 10 dollars off from my premium rewards she asked for my phone number and i gave her my card. When she came bck she charged me with the whole thing. I was like what the heck? Then she gave me this look like i cnt afford our meal. What a shame for this amazing restaurants!!! NEVER EVER EVER EVER one more time NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK IN THIS PLACE! AND I WILL ALSO TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE SO THEY WONT EVEN COME HERE AND GET THAT ATTITUDE FROM THIS PLACE!
