Kenna N.,"San Jose, CA",1,7,2,1.0,6/29/2017,"I am very disappointed with every single aspect of my dinner experience tonight. I came in with two friends. We ordered sliders and wings and when the sliders came out there were no grilled onions in it. Also, we ordered bone-in wings but they gave us boneless. This was not a big deal but when I mentioned it to my waitress, she was unhelpful and said ""the grilled onions are actually inside the patty"" like I was stupid. And no, there were no onions inside of the patties. Next, after we finished eating, we waited for our waitress to come take our dessert order which took about 10 minutes of us just sitting there. We ordered 1 original pizookie. When it came out, the ""ice cream"" on top of the pizookie was completely frost bitten and icey, clearly left in the freezer for too long. At this point we waited for our waitress to come around but she walked past our table like 3 times without helping us. I had to call over another waiter to help us. On top of this, it is a Thursday night and the restaurant was empty so there is no excuse for this horrible service and food. There was nothing done to compensate and I'm very upset. Please do better for your customers BJs."
Samuel H.,"San Jose, CA",45,8,1,1.0,12/11/2015,"This place is terrible! Everything is way over priced and over rated. The sandwiches come out soggy and they taste disgusting. The only thing I would recommend trying here are the avocado egg rolls but be warned they are not worth bothering to go here.  My experience with the hostesses has been horrendous! They are absolutely rude and unwelcoming.  Now for the service, I used to sit in the bar if there were seats available and I must say most of the wait staff are friendly and welcoming but once they great you that's going to be one of the few times you see them at your table - even when they're slow and don't have many tables. I'm not sure if they're in the kitchen chatting away or if they take a lot of breaks but you don't often see them. The menu has a ton of options but don't bother asking the servers what they recommend between the options your pondering because they're just going to tell you they're all good and popular - not very helpful.  The bar serves weak drinks and they're not really good at mixing, I mean how hard is it for any bartender to make a martini! Stick with the beer if you're going to go here and drink but be prepared to wait... AND certainly don't bother asking for the manager, they're absolutely useless and you'll see them way less often than the servers! Obviously they're terrible at their jobs, don't know how to hire or attract talented employees and they don't care about your experience.  The cooks come out of the kitchen sometime and they look dirty and frumpy makes you wonder about who's been handing your food..  It really is a shame I had high hopes for this place when they were going in so close to the rose garden. It was just a quick Uber away if you were looking for a hip place to relax on a Friday night and have some cocktails or beers with some friends. The BJ's in Cupertino next to Apple really has it dialed in a lot more. It really would be nice if this place could pull it together and figure out how a restaurant is supposed to work. But to bad I won't be going back to check and see. Enter at your own risk!"
Jason H.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,21,,1.0,1/15/2017,"Terrible service. Went in with group of six to watch football and grab lunch. They had several tables available with views of tv's but they would not sit us there as they were supposedly reserved. We ate lunch in the corner with bad view of tv's. when we left all but one of the tables that had been reserved where unoccupied. Obviously a terrible business plan and we will never go back.  What seemed like the manager, short blonde hair with glasses, was rude and totally unaccomadating."
Steve N.,"San Jose, CA",20,28,21,2.0,11/6/2015,"The food is reasonable, prices are a bit high but they send out coupons every month or so.  On my last visit the service was terrible, the waiter told us that it was not their table and made us feel like we should be appreciative that we got served at all. 50 minutes to get the table, 15 minutes to get acknowledged and then over 30 minutes to pay, which only happened after calling the manager over."
Kiyana D.,"San Jose, CA",116,88,418,4.0,6/19/2014,"Finally tried this location out, despite reading all the bad reviews on yelp since being open, thought it was about time to see if this Bj's lives up to par with the other 3 locations I've been to. Honestly, this location is the closes to me, so it would be nice to come to this one more often. Depending where I'm at I'd drive all the way to Fremont or De Anza just for Bj's. Went here twice in 1 week and both times I had great service and couldn't complain about a thing. I love Bj's food and pizookie so it'll definitely have me coming back. The only thing I could say I hated or surprised Was I had a soda, and in the menu it said ""complimentary refills"" not until I got home, the waiter charged me twice for it on my bill. A tad annoying since I was using my Bj's rewards and used my free pizookie that day. So she felt the need to charge me for something else? But Wthell, I should have been paying a tad bit more careful before handing my card to them. Other than that, service and food live up to their standards."
Rochelle T.,"Campbell, CA",7,52,1,3.0,6/8/2015,"We went here today for lunch and were promptly seated in a relatively empty restaurant - just a few tables ahead of us. Our waitress promptly took our order - got our drinks, filled them, filled them again and before we knew it 40 minutes had passed by with no food. Our waitress said ""the kitchen was backed up"" - um, when we sat down the restaurant was fairly empty. Granted 40 minutes later it was getting fuller (still not an entirely packed house as I have seen it). One manager came over and wanted to argue with me that we ordered at the busiest time - um, no we did not. Our waitress was very kind the whole time and you could tell this was not a good day for the kitchen. So our food finally arrived, about 50 minutes in at this point. My brussel-sprout kale salad arrived with no brussel sprouts :(. We were already so late at this point, I told the waitress I would eat as is (I hate wasting food) and it was quite tasty although those brussel sprouts would have been delicious I am sure. Now, the reason for the 3 stars - while still eating, I am assuming it was the supervisor who came out and informed us due to the issues we had to deal with, our meal was covered and she apologized profusely, no excuses, just covered our meals and provided me with a gift card and asked us to come back again. That was so sweet and unnecessary to comp our entire meal. And I am sure there was some crazy issue going on today that they did not fully explain - I understand issues do happen. And I really do appreciate that they went above and beyond to remedy the situation. We will absolutely be back!"
Anil J.,"San Jose, CA",0,37,23,4.0,8/3/2016,"I like BJ's for their beer choices! My friend loved the sampler and the appetizers we ordered. Our service was quick and prompt. Had been here few times earlier too and liked the food, drinks and ambience. It can be noisy on the days when local sports teams are playing and covered on TV. Overall good experience and would come back"
Kunal A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,3,1,1.0,1/7/2017,"Crappy food. Cold pasta, cold and soggy pizza. Appetizers were served after main course. Horrible wait times. Wasted precious time and money. Just go to round table piazza or something for better food and quality for less price."
Francis N.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,29,3.0,1/2/2015,The wait was so long. I waited a hour and a half when they said it was a 30min-1hour wait. The pizza was kinda too greasy for me and the calamari was mediocre.  The service was ok.It was pretty cold in there.I'd say this chain particularly is probably the worst
Desirae P.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,72,11,2.0,8/22/2014,"Second time I've been here. Previous visit was so horrible, I said I'd never come back. Food took forever, server ignored our table completely and our checks took forever as well.  Came back again recently, great service (can't remember servers name) but food was so so. The appetizer wasn't horrible, but looked like I could have bought all the items from my local grocery store out of the freezer section and put them in the microwave. Side salad was drenched in dressing, and my pizza seemed under cooked and was cold. Cheese wasn't melted all the way. The lights were way too dim so I couldn't even see what was on my pizza  great service this time around but food was lacking, most likely won't return."
Sal C.,"Lahaina, HI",0,3,,1.0,12/29/2016,I got here around 6:?  Got seated they took our drink order and now we have been here for over an hour with no food and the manager just came and said they lost our ticket order and just found it he also said he was going to personally bring our food out himself I just want my food I don't care who brings it i am starving I liked the looks of the place but the service and lack of being able to even Cook is horrible u don't know how this place stays in business I will never come back again and will not recomme8thus place to my enemy thumbs down at the end the night manager bought our dinner because of the bad service I just want my food I am hungry
Channing M.,"San Jose, CA",518,332,324,2.0,3/27/2014,"We came in today for lunch and the restaurant was not full at all. Our server or the kitchen (or both) were moving really slow today and it took us almost 2 hours to get through our entire meal.  He immediately asked us for our drink order when we sat down and when he brought back the iced tea we asked for sweetener. 15 minutes later we sill did not have any indication as to when the appetizers would come out nor did we have the sweetener. He replied that he was ""looking for it."" I am sorry, but in a huge restaurant there has to be sweetener somewhere. I could have walked to the target and back by the time we finally got it.  The food came out really slowly. If this were not a special work lunch then there is no way I would be able to go to this place on my lunch break and be back within the hour and a half time limit.  The ambiance is great, the decor is great, and from what I can tell it is pretty clean.  I will have to come back again to see if the kitchen/service is any better. But only when I have LOTS of time to kill."
Elina F.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,2.0,4/30/2015,"My boyfriend and I have been going here for some time now and overall we like it. However, I'm giving it 2 stars based on our last visit. We wanted to go to a place where we can have dinner and watch the basketball game, Spurs vs. Clippers. We discussed several places which we knew have TVs and show sports events and decided to go to BJ's. We were seated at the left-most side of the restaurant which is somewhat separate from the rest of the place. There were 3 TVs there, 2 playing NFL and 1 playing hockey. We asked if they can switch the channel for one of them to show the NBA game and both times we were told ""Ok, I'll check with the manager"". Mind you we asked two different waiters. 1hr there and they never changed it. What made it even worse was the fact that they were showing the game in the other side of the restaurant but because of the layout of the room, we couldn't see anything.  To top this off, we waited 15 min to be seated, I waited 15 minute for a soup and a salad, and 15 min for someone to pick up the check. That's 45min of our night wasted in waiting. Bottomline is - next time we want to go have dinner and watch a game, we will definitely avoid BJs. Such a shame, we used to like it there."
Angelina L.,"San Jose, CA",30,8,2,5.0,5/22/2016,"The food was mediocre. I ordered my steak medium and it came out well done. Our server asked us if we would like another one. I just ate it because it was too hungry to wait any longer. The five stars goes to Paola (our server). The Warriors game was on tonight so it was super busy but we were taken care of by Paola. Her service was amazing. She kept checking on us. Super friendly, and even told us not to rush out if we wanted to stay and watch the game. Paola! You're amazing! Thank you! Honestly, since I was not impressed by the food, if Paola wasn't our server tonight, I would probably never come back. The other employees we encountered were not 1/20 as nice and professional as Paola."
Nirva P.,"Nashville, TN",98,1,,1.0,3/4/2016,"Me and a couple friends went to get dinner and there was a 45 min wait, so we went to the bar and got some drinks and my drink came out tasting like sugar and water. I told the bartender and she ask ""so what do you want me to do about it?"" I said maybe put in some alcohol? She put in a shot of tequila and charged me 9 bucks on top of the 10 bucks for the drink without telling me that she was going to charge me more than the price of the drink for a shot in the drink. Then they texted us that our table was ready and while we were closing out at the bad  they gave our table away. Then the staff started talking crap about us for no reason so we left and went to Wing Stop. Terrible service!!!"
Diane P.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,5,1.0,12/23/2016,"Don't bother with call ahead service.  I had just finished touring lights in Willow Glen with four hungry children. Called from the car with all the kids hearing that our name was added to the list (she made me repeat my name 3x - that should have been my clue I was talking to an incompetent employee) and she said our table would be ready around 6:30.  I arrived at 6:20 and they said my name wasn't on list and wait was 40 minutes.  I didn't know the name of who I spoke to, so To them I guess there was no way to prove I called.  My four under 13 aged witnesses didn't count. Merry Christmas to us and off to a different restaurant that knows about customer service.  Merry Christmas to the BJs employees, including manager, who ruined our holiday dinner plans."
LaShae C.,"San Jose, CA",9,6,1,4.0,4/27/2014,"Finally, an experience worth raving about!  Apparently this particular BJ's has a bad rep for service, and until this evening, for me, food as well. I'm usually pleased the spinach stuffed mushrooms and avocado rolls they offer here, but haven't found an entree worth writing about until the tri tip dip I had tonight.  Fortunately we had the pleasure of being served by Courtney, who recommended my entree AND ensured my girlfriends salmon would actually be blackened instead of the oddly seasoned fish we've had here twice before, and once overly raw. Accommodating is an understatement for the service we've received from Courtney tonight. Friendly, attentive, accurate and definitely worth returning. I've left off one star because unfortunately some of the other staff here hadn't quite hit the mark attending to details in the past. Nevertheless, tonight Courtney made up for that, thank you so much!"
Julian B.,"Newman, CA",0,12,,2.0,5/30/2016,"Strict rules. I ordered the salmon with the couscous. There we're a few grains of couscous. Tiny portion. So I asked for more couscous.  I got it but was billed for extra couscous. When I complained,  the waitor kept  saying he was sorry and that was the rule. question: If you are paying good money towards a plate, the rule says ""no modifications, no accommodations for the customer ""? It is new to me. Next time my destination will be Dave & Buster where you can get what you want."
Jesse W.,"Santa Clara, CA",39,68,60,2.0,3/23/2015,"I often recommend BJ's for social gatherings because the menu offerings are generally crowd pleasing. The beer selection is good. Their signature deep dish pizzas are tasty. The pizookies are awesome. Unfortunately, I have to say this Coleman Ave location falls very short of the standards other BJ's restaurants have set. I first visited within a couple weeks after their grand opening. The service was terrible. I understand that many of them were probably new employees, and likely students from the nearby universities, but even their managers seemed inexperienced. The waitress who took our orders seemed very confused. When things were brought out they were incorrect. Some drinks we ordered never came, and after multiple reminders, we were finally told they were 'out of stock' of one of the ingredients. This was about a year and a half ago. I hesitated to write a review then, because I wanted to give them another chance after some time.  I came back a month or two later, and it was the same story. It was even worse to me, because I had brought back a bigger group for lunch time, with reservations. I expected with reservations being an advance notice, they would be sure to have adequate staff and service. This was not the case. Again orders were goofed. Service seemed confused. Managers seemed unable to help. But I still didn't give up. In the past year, most recently two weeks ago, I have returned 3 more times for various occasions. The story has not changed. I'm pretty disappointed to have to say I don't recommend this location until they get their act together. It appears the recent yelpers would agree with me on this."
Kae O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/21/2016,Excellent service. I loved our waitress Anna. Best waitress I ever had. I have bjs where I live in San bruno but the workers were never as friendly and helpful as here. She did everything to make us feel welcomed and enjoy our meal. Definetly will come back again. Thank you Anna and your manager for our free appetizer and pazookie. Everything was perfect and I am stuffed right now. If you ever eat here request Anna you won't regret it and don't forget to tip her she's worth it. Thaaaaank you again Annna. See you soon
