Maddy C.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/12/2017,I love BJs. The place is nice and clean. People are friendly. I always order a garlic shrimp asparagus pasta...the best pasta ever
Rebecca P.,"Milpitas, CA",178,104,88,4.0,4/28/2014,"I came here definitely expecting horrible service after reading all the previous reviews. I got here around 4:45pm on a Monday evening & we got greeted right away. The wait time before getting seated was less than 2 minutes. Our waitress of the evening was Stacy & she was super friendly. She made suggestions & checked up on us frequently.  Appetizer: Spinach & artichoke dip. Can't really go wrong with that.  My dinner: Cajun Pasta. Chicken was okay. Toast was okay. The pasta itself was pretty good & not as dry as other Cajun pasta I've had.  Maybe we came on a good day or got lucky with the right waitress. I wouldn't mind coming back to this location, especially when I can walk off the food at Target & do some damage."
Morgan L.,"San Jose, CA",2,12,34,5.0,11/7/2015,"This BJs has now become my late night, just got off of work, go to place for drinks and dinner. Especially coming here as late as I do (usually between 11pm-midnight), I always sit in the bar area, preferably at the bar. Previously here, and at other BJs locations, I've gotten terrible service sitting in the bar area. But at this location, the bartender that's always here Michael, he's ALWAYS on point. Very quick service, even remembers what it is that I generally order. He never appears to be stressed or under pressure, just keeps it cool and control of his area. Always appreciate to get him as a server/bartender. Mojitos and tortilla soup are a must."
Kimberly D.,"Stockton, CA",2,43,1,1.0,4/13/2016,"Wow. We decided to give this place a second try and again this place is CRAP! Can't get anything right! Can't even get a simple water right. What's so hard about getting an order right? We had to send back our meal twice. And the third time it takes you 30 mins to cook a burger? Wow this place is a joke. Waste of money, food is crap."
GJ W.,"San Jose, CA",0,45,,1.0,10/24/2016,"Really bad experience at BJs on Coleman-  First, they were out of silverware and told us only after they brought out food!!!! Asked us to wait while they cleaned some forks which took seven minutes as the food cooled. Second, my entree salad was limp, with brown lettuce, and warm. Yuck. Whole family came down with stomach nausea the next day--don't know if it is related but certainly wonder."
Bernie C.,"Santa Clara, CA",42,84,39,1.0,5/11/2015,"We are literally still waiting at this restaurant for someone, anyone to ask us if we need anything. It NEVER fails that our service at this location is ALWAYS so HORRIBLE, just like their food. We've been to this one about 4-5 times now and it keeps going down. Such a shame for a big chain. It takes forever to get our food, it takes even longer to get condiments, and don't even bother for a refill. My son literally bobbed his head and fell asleep waiting for a waiter to come so we can ask for our check. It's Monday night, so it's not that busy and we came after the basketball game ended. There's tons of empty tables all around. Such a disappointment!  I will only come back for the pizookies! Their food here tastes like gourmet microwaveable dinner. Not worth it. Pizza is hard, stale and flavorless. Baked potato was microwaved and undercooked. Steak was tough, dry and sucks for whoever has to clean the wad of steak gum my son had to spit out. Thin cut fries were mediocre. Cajun pasta tasted like cafeteria food. If anything, El Camino hospital smacks on their food here. We tried a few other dishes here but it's nothing special because I can't remember anything good about it.  Anyway, spend your money elsewhere. The Cupertino location is much better."
Binh L.,"San Jose, CA",168,36,16,3.0,3/9/2015,"Came in a few nights ago for my birthday dinner with a group of 15 people. I had no idea this place had reservations otherwise I would've called in advance (no, they don't take reservations on the day of). I thought the wait time for a group that big was going to be at least 1.5+ wait but it was only an hour, which in my opinion wasn't that bad. Our server was extremely helpful and very patient in waiting for everyone to place their order. I was getting tired of eating pasta so I decided to order the California Club Sandwich?.. anyways, I wasn't all that great. The chicken was really dry and I felt like the bread had a lot of grease on it. Of course for dessert I had to order the pizookie, I got the chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla ice cream and oh man! Too much sweetness going on, I could only finish half. Overall, the food here is alright."
Ryan H.,"Orangevale, CA",3,10,,2.0,9/1/2015,"Good Food, Horrid service, long wait times for food.  Maybe they were upset that our 4 top ordered the unlimited soup and salad, but if that's the case, don't offer it!! Both times the servers had attitude....  Maybe I'll return but plan to spend a long time here...."

Emma S.,"San Jose, CA",3,30,108,5.0,11/26/2014,"Had dinner there last night and everyone was so accommodating when we arrived with 4 little ones and 4 adults! Mixed drinks were on point and food was delish!  I ordered a side of the white cheddar mashed potatoes and expected it to have gobs of cheese over it or something! It tasted like the powder form kind of potatoes with salt.   Aside from the mash potatoes,  all our dishes were great!!"
Akshay T.,"San Jose, CA",108,4,1,5.0,5/7/2016,Superb restaurant. Went there for my birthday. The ambience is really nice and waiter/waitress were very attentive. food was really delicious. Try pizookie and BJ's signature deep dish pizza.
Rubi D.,"San Jose, CA",39,79,59,5.0,5/25/2015,"Best bj I have been to in awhile! I have been to many in Sacramento. I came to this one for the Warriors and rockets game. Although busy, the manager took my order right after she personally sat us down. I didn't know she was the manager until later. This restaurant is ran with great customer service values!"
Brooke J.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",0,1,,4.0,5/22/2016,"Just ate there with my girlfriend and Isaiah made a vegetarian feel at home, I never know what I can substitute at restaurants but Isaiah made sure I got a hardy amount of vegtables... Overall it was a good experience... I'm glad they have vegetarian staff."
Teddy G.,"San Jose, CA",125,94,82,4.0,1/14/2015,Had a great time here! Our server rocked! My buddy and I tried the beer sampler which is an awesome option! The signature pizza was amazing. That poor pizza never stood a chance once it hit our plates!!!! A great place to go to with friends. It has a casual yet nice atmosphere to it.
Kevin C.,"Gilbert, AZ",11,7,,4.0,11/29/2015,"Pizza was very good. Salmon was too. Sample beers was cool, so you could see which you like best. Best part was the service. Elijah was a great server. I rarely tip 25%, but I did today. Thanks Elijah. P.s. Bloody Marys were delicious."
Jo D.,"San Jose, CA",150,192,170,2.0,12/9/2014,"The setting here is just like the rest of the cool BJ's Breweries. Love the booths, lighting, artwork, TV's, etc.. but the service here is horrible.  I came for my work holiday party and walked in to the hostess area where I find 5 staff members standing around chatting amongst each other. One of them was mingling with her friend/guests and the others ignored me. I stood there for a few minutes pretty conscious of the poor customer service already. A few more minutes later a hostess looked right at me and the phone rang. She picked it up instead of acknowledging me. I finally asserted myself to the others and loudly asked, ""Which way is the private party?"" And only one of them pointed me the right direction, and I know damn well the rest of them heard me. Ruuuu!"
Regina A.,"Santa Clara, CA",12,94,862,4.0,5/5/2014,Went to this place on sunday night. The host is really nice and we don't have to wait to get our table. We order : Full baby back ribs ( sweet and tender) Cajun pasta (chicken is very tender) And Ghirardelli pizookie (too chocolaty i recommend the original pizookie instead of this one) The server is really fast and the food is satisfying. I don't know why this place has bad overall review but me and my boyfriend really satisfy dining in this restaurant.
Magee W.,"Mountain View, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/1/2016,"Came here last nite at about 7:30, found a seat at the bar booth.  It was pretty busy for a Wednesday nite.  No one came over for 10 minutes till we flagged someone.  Our waitress said she be back to get our drink order which was another 10 minutes.  We order a bottle of wine, after 15 minutes went by we flagged her down and she said they had to go to the back and get the bottle and she would be right back.  15 minutes later after we asked her again she came back with 4 wine glasses and the bottle uncorked on top of the bottle and dropped it off without a word or pouring it into our glasses.  She may have been busy but an apology would have gone a long way for the wait.  Our appetizer had come out before the wine and were almost done with it.  The cheese on the burger was crispy, the fries warm and pizza was just ok. I think BJ's need more help staff help. I would have been understanding if she would have had a better attitude.  I've been here before but never have experienced service & food this bad."
Elias R.,"Santa Clara, CA",513,115,30,2.0,11/28/2014,"I've been to other BJ's before. Some for food, some for dessert, some for drinks... you get the picture. Their food is definitely sub-par. Not good restaurant or brew house food. The buzz doesn't make it any better.. Some people love it, to each his own.. The Pizzookie used to be fantastic, but its been at least 3 years since i've had a good one. Good indicator that they have gone bad and may stay that way. I mean, the flavor and size is good, but the used to be crispy on the out sides and edges and chewy delicious on the inside. Not they just taste raw. And the beers, they're a brewhouse, and such a common one, you'd think the beer would be on point right? Wrong.. I'm not sure if they still brew o site anymore, I mean they used to sell growlers and don't know, wonder what that's all about, right? But the beer just doesn't taste fresh like it should. I mean, I love breweries because the beer is fresh. I even brew my own for the fresh taste. But the beer here is just overpowering, oddly flavored, and they make sooo many different ones. I'd rather them ""make"" 5 outstanding beers than 15 eh :/ ones, you feel me? It's drinkable, the mixes are the way to go though. I got a snake bite, not bad, but not good. I can't drink it all night you know? And they're kind of expensive for what they are. I mean, meals average close to 15 bucks, beers are like 6 for a pint, not a big a$$ mug like a brewery should have.. Anyways, I won't talk them down anymore. It's just a big bar, not a brewery. Good Luck Yelpers! (read my other reviews to see a good brewery if you want fresh beer every time)"
Lina H.,"Newark, CA",681,633,691,5.0,10/29/2013,"Not bad at all despite the negative reviews up to now.  I think you have to give them a chance with all the new servers going around.  There was no wait which is usually not the case for a BJs.  We got seated at an awesome booth right across from the bar with a perfect view of the big screen TV.  The server and a shadow server promptly took our orders.  We did have to wait quite a bit for our food but our beers came out real quick so we weren't complaining.  Only concern was that we only get an hour for lunch so we might had to take the food to go.  Our food came out and it was great.  Overall good experience, it is brand spanking new and everything is in tip top shape so no complaints about anything else.  I'll come on by before a Sharks game.  ;)"
