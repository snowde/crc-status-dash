Simeon S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"We just wanted a couple drinks for happy hour. While waiting for our table, I overheard a hostess comment on how they were over staffed. We sat our table for 10 minutes with no greeting from our waiter.  I got up and interrupted a manger having a brief meeting with the team of hostesses. They still didn't locate our waiter. We finally walked out after watching 3 tables who were seated after us be greeted by their waiter. The team of hostesses and the manager watched us walk out and no one said good bye or questioned it. Amazing how they neglected us while being over staffed."
Wilson N.,"Mountain View, CA",0,23,2,1.0,3/29/2016,"This review/rating is for this location only.  Came here after a Sharks game for late night happy hour apps. Unfortunately, they must not know that people may do that after Sharks game and didn't staff accordingly. There was only 1 server for the entire bar area while there were 4/5 servers in the dining area which was sparse. We sat for about 15 mins before being greeted and was only able to order drinks. When we wanted to order food at the same time, we were told to wait because she was busy and had to come back.  The server ended up taking orders for the middle tables at the bar but never came back to us. Tables even got their drinks that sat after us. At this point, it was about half an hour without any drinks and no check up. Another server eventually brought out waters but at that point, we were ready to leave.  Management should be aware of situations like this and jump in to help out. This experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I would come back to this location."
Thuy H.,"San Jose, CA",227,223,221,3.0,10/11/2013,"Decided to do hh yesterday from 5p-7p yesterday and it was ok..... It wasn't too busy since this location has only been opened for less than a month but it's like any other average BJ's. Tips: On Thursdays selected beers are $3.50 instead of $4. Even though the bar area is ONLY for happy hour crowd, if you get the manager's approval, you can have hh prices at the tables (not too much food selection for hh and there won't be a menu at the tables either for what's on hh). Shots are like $10 so just get two $5 mojitos instead or 3 beers. If you're looking to watch the game, make sure you sit at a table that's in SIGHT of a TV. ALWAYS end your night with a pazookie. Parking is unlimited since you can park in the Target lot. Service is good and always a great spot for a large crowd :)"
Djoe p.,"Honolulu, HI",50,24,76,3.0,11/10/2013,"Order a drink when you sit down because its going to be awhile before you get your food.  We came in on a Sunday night to watch a football game and ordered off their happy hour menu. We sat for over an hour while we waited for our food. So we were glad we had drinks to keep our hunger at bay.  The waitstaff were nice, the food overall pretty good except for the boneless wings (skip it) but service was very slow.  P.S. if you get the waitstaff's attention order everything you need including water because they tend not to check up on the tables very often."
Susan A.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,67,16,5.0,1/31/2016,"This review is SOLELY based off of the service my friends and I received on Friday, January 29th. In short: there were some extremely rude inconsiderate customers before us who horribly affected our plans, and the management at BJ's did what they could to make up for it. I had reservations for my birthday at BJ's at 9pm, I was originally coming in with a group of twenty people. The way reservations work is that you're only allowed to stay two hours max. Unfortunately, the rude inconsiderate group before us decided to break that rule. My friends and I ended up getting seated at 9:50 pm because of those awful people. Because of this, most of my friends couldn't make it to that event, and I don't blame them, because just like me, they work 45-65 hours a week, and plus, we have school. What made my case even more upsetting was that I was also sick. To add insult to injury, those inconsiderate rude customers walked out laughing, and one of them just gave me a card that was only 20% off as her way of apologizing, and it was set to expire in two days. Unbelievable. By the time we got seated, I asked the hostess for some exemptions. The manager ended up coming out, and instead of granting the small requests I asked for, he gave my little remaining group and I an offer we couldn't refuse to make up for the horrible guests before us. Our server was also just as great. With that said, I will most definitely come to this establishment again. You can't always expect to be lucky thinking you'll have good guests who will be considerate of others, but you can at least try to make the awful situation less problematic, and that's what the manager, server, and hostess at this BJ's did."
Raymond G.,"Salinas, CA",117,4,7,1.0,5/1/2016,Service was not good server was to busy took for ever to Bring Us Food Then Made Mistake On My Daughter By Time They fixed It Everyone At Table Had Fins he'd There food!
Jan P.,"San Jose, CA",302,861,1692,4.0,9/23/2013,"We came today for the soft opening which provided training opportunities for the new employees. In addition, the food was free (though via a variety of select menus) and 100% of the booze benefited the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. All the employees were extremely friendly and particularly ebullient.  The restaurant itself is nestled at the corner of Coleman Ave and Autumn St, by Panera. My first impression was that it was nice and clean with a very open layout -- though isn't as large as some other BJ's. Parking might be an issue with overflow into Target's parking.  My group was seated at the bar and though one gentleman at the bar appeared to be our main server, some number of employees walking around through out the restaurant checked in on us and provided requested items (extra plates, utensils...). At one point of us waiting, a young lady brought a pork chop to us however we did not order one and it was quickly shuttled away. Anyhow, we started with BJ's signature berry cider which was AH-mazing -- new favorite drink over Wyder's (but sadly, not for home purchase). We then went into our main entrees: the standard deep dish pizza was solid, my jalapeno burger with chipotle mayo was delicious, and the chicken marsala was okay (though my coworker really enjoyed it). For dessert, we tried the beignets for the first time and O-M-G, with a mound of vanilla ice-cream, whipped cream, and strawberries, it tasted just like funnel cake from a fair. Delicious and great dessert alternative to the pizookie (though ours was slightly raw at the center). Overall we had a really fun experience. Great, convenient location, solid food for a BJ's, and friendly, helpful staff. Perfect for happy hour! One qualm? The front door! A revolving door, really? I could do without (granted a single regular door flanks each side of the revolving one)."
Danyelle P.,"San Jose, CA",167,167,72,1.0,1/24/2016,So disappointed in the service here. I've had birthday's ruined for family members and rude service from waitresses and it seems to always happen at this location. It even gets to the point where I had to ask a manager to switch out the waitress taking care of my table and he didnt so I had to call the BJ's corporation to make a formal complaint. So over this place. I will never come back to this location.
Dmitriy S.,"Santa Clara, CA",293,905,2950,3.0,10/10/2013,"I tend to stay away from places like BJ's, Applebee's, Chili's, etc when there's so many better options in one of the most diverse melting pots in the world. However, when Kathleen W. invited me for happy hour at the end of a tumultuous week, how could I say no? We came when this BJ's had only been open for a week. It was already packed with customers, had a line out the door, and is so huge that it took me a bit of walking to find my friends.  Here's how Happy Hour works. Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm, Sun-Thurs 10pm-Close:  - $4 beers, call drinks, and simple appetizers - $5 mojitos, martinis, and more sophisticated appetizers - $6 wine and the fanciest appetizers I started off with their Oktoberfest (seasonal) beer, which is a toasty lager. Very smooth, crisp and refreshing. Later in the night, I got a Nutty Brewnette. A bit too nutty and strong for my taste, but still quite decent. The quality of their beer surprised me. Appetizers: - Avacado Egg Rolls ($6): Avacado, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, and spices in wonton wrapping. The ones we were served pretty much just had avocado and omitted most of the items listed above. It was bland, but fresh. Wouldn't recommend. - California Club Flatbread ($4): Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic aioli and avocado on a flatbread. Pretty tasty with a good amount of chicken. Not too overbaked, and the garlic aioli adds a nice flavor you usually don't expect on a pizza.  - Mini Vegetarian/Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizzas ($6): Your typical veggie deep dish pizza, with the buffalo one being the same but with chicken. It's actually not really ""deep dish,"" in the sense that the extra height is taken up by the dough, not by more ingredients. Pretty decent but nothing to rave about.  - Chicken Lettuce Wrap ($6): Diced chicken breast, mushroom, water chestnuts, veggies and crispy wontons served with lettuce cups and sauces. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. The lettuce was crisp and fresh. When combined with the sesame soy sauce, it was a fantastic flavor concoction. Definitely recommend.  This was all finished off with the much needed Pizookie Trio. Not sure which pizookies we got, but they all lived up to the hype. A perfect way to pig out one last time during the evening.  Service is very slow, but that's understandable considering they're new and are packed during happy hour. Once they get on their feet, they'll probably hire more wait staff. My friend's beer took half an hour to arrive and they kept making excuses. Eventually, he just got it for free, which was nice of them, but expected from us.  Overall, a great place for happy hour, but I wouldn't come here for a full meal. That's just personal preference."
Stephanie K.,"Salinas, CA",3,2,25,4.0,4/7/2016,"I went out to lunch with my mom and we both ordered . . . it's called the Ahi salad. Everything in the salad is good, however be careful to not eat too much wasabi that is on the side. We were able to sit down without the host taking us to our table.  We sat in a booth closer to the bar"
Trish S.,"San Jose, CA",31,377,192,4.0,10/2/2013,"Decor: **** Friendly Staff: **** Promptness: **** Flavor of the food:*** Drink selection:**** 1st time here & my family enjoyed the atmosphere. Lots of staff, so you never have to hunt anyone down for refills.  Big bonus: My son has food allergies & our server gave us a Food & Allergy Menu. Awesome!!  The only thing that I wasn't impressed was their burger. Not very tasty or juicy- Chili's is much better."
Blake L.,"San Jose, CA",342,13,8,4.0,6/24/2014,"Oh man, this place was amazing. I'll admit the wait time was only a little slow, and the prices were a little high, and it was a little dark, but all of those little things, among others, do not do much harm to the overall experience. The food, although a bit overpriced, was very good, although not quite filling. The service is amazing. They are so nice and willing to change orders once, twice, or (in my case) three times. I am very pleased with this restaurant, but am only giving it four stars because the minor details that were mentioned earlier should not go amiss. Other than that, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice, sit-down place to eat and unwind."
Del E.,"Saratoga, CA",2,29,21,2.0,11/28/2015,The 2.5 rating is well deserved. We had really bad service. Not sure why management at this location can't get their act together. Our food came in two different waves. Two people got their food first and they were completely done and waiting for the rest of us to get our food. Terrible. Just bad. Total wait after ordering our food was one hour fifteen minutes. Shameful.
Michelle S.,"Cupertino, CA",782,346,982,4.0,10/19/2015,"This specific BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is located in a gorgeous shopping plaza of San Jose and the exterior is absolutely beautiful. Walking into the restaurant, the hostess kindly led me in the direction to my party of four. Our waitress was very funny and nice, though it was hard to fetch her at times because the restaurant is just so gosh darn big. However, she was definitely accommodating and always fulfilled our requests in a timely manner - whether it be refilling our coffees or getting us extra sauce. As a passionate Avocado Eggrolls lover, I shamelessly ordered this appetizer at 10AM while the rest of my friends ordered normal brunch entrees. As always, I was satisfied with my appetizer and it definitely filled me up past lunchtime. If you come to BJ's in the morning, I would actually suggest ordering the brunch entrees, as they are actually really reasonably priced and the portions are HUGE! Also, the waitress brought my friend a Triple Chocolate birthday pizookie on the house at the end of our meal. Great first experience at this BJ's and I wouldn't mind coming back again in the near future :)"
Ali A.,"Fremont, CA",141,45,10,1.0,12/6/2014,"Apparently when you call ahead of time to put your name on wait list, you're not on wait list.. Your name is on wait list when you walk in.. Their phone app does allow you to put your name on wait lists.. And I did like tons of times in the past where I called in to put our name on guest list.. The front receptionist was rude and had attitude."
Kristen P.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/20/2016,"We got there a little before the lunch rush and ordered 3 meals. 45 minutes after we ordered we asked the server to ask the kitchen to just put it in to-go boxes, we couldn't wait around much longer. 50+ minutes later the server comes back with the wrong order. At this point it had been so long we didn't have time for the kitchen to correct the food let alone the time for the server to correct the bill. I understand that the kitchen and server were very busy but not once did we get an apology. All we got was ""oh, I'll check on your food""."
Casey H.,"Vacaville, CA",11,57,7,2.0,3/5/2016,"Wasnt horrible, service was slow, went home with a tummy ache after having the lunch special of chicken club/ceasar salad. Wouldnt go back, just ended up that the boss wanted to go there cause he didnt know what he wanted and the menu is huge...I'm a fan of small menu's and do one thing right, not everything mediocre."
Anna K.,"Los Altos, CA",1,4,2,2.0,2/22/2015,Their pulled pork needs a lot of work! Their wages are plain ... not something I'll try again Their calamari was ok...  Service was slow n not as attentive as I'd like
Dale D.,"San Jose, CA",0,125,7,3.0,7/19/2015,Had the pumbpkin ale.   Good stuff.  HH food was ok.  Service was adequate. I did not like the avacado egg roles but I set my self up for a ritch dish and got it.  Service was very corporate withch = the same fake monotone stuff.   All in all I did not have a bad experience but I did not have a Grat experience. Will i be back...... Na
Cory E.,"Alpine, UT",39,27,21,3.0,6/1/2015,I love that they offer a gluten free menu. The gluten free crust on their pizzas tastes great. I personally like the chicken bacon ranch pizza.  For dessert the gluten free pizookie is worth the calories. Get it with vanilla ice cream.
