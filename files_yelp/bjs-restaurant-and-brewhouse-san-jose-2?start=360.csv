Dominique R.,"San Jose, CA",92,13,8,2.0,1/18/2015,"My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 6:30-7ish expecting a long wait but surprisingly we were seated in less than 15 minutes which was cool! Pretty crowded but like I said we expected that due to the popularity and just because it was a Friday. The bathrooms are nice haha. It was both of our first times here, we heard good things but honestly the food was just okay. Don't get me wrong it wasn't extremely bad! It just wasn't as great as people put it out to be. We ordered some carne asada fries as an appetizer, which we asked to have first since our server offered, but we had to ask where they were AFTER all the rest of our food came. They were okay, the chile verde slightly over powered everything and there was just a large chunk or two of meat put on the side. I guess that's just how they make it? Eh, it wasn't so appealing. The ahi poke was alright. The corn fritters were really good at first but the last one I had wasn't cooked through all the way so the middle was a ball of batter and I just couldn't finish the rest of it after discovering that.  Also, when I tried to ask our server what corn fritters were since I've never tried them, she said ""Well, if you just read the description it says it right there."" Yes... I read it... It described what's IN it, but I just wanted some clarification since I am not exactly a corn fritter expert.. Maybe it was just me over thinking her comment, BUT I was slightly offended. Lol."
Estyn A.,"San Jose, CA",10,11,95,1.0,10/20/2014,"We love BJs, but the service and the food here are poor reps of this chain. We tried it out because it's close to home, but, gotta say... terrible. Worst service we experienced in a while.  When we walked in, the host did not acknowledge us even though it didn't look too busy on Monday night, and we were surprised because of the grand entrance through the revolving door. No smile, takes us to our seat, a lone table in the center of an aisle of booths, most if which were filled. We felt a lil awkward, like being on stage, so we ask our server to move to a booth right next to the table, still in her section. No prob.  Our server took our order, and that's the last time she talked to us the rest of the night. By the end, I forgot her name and what her voice sounded like. We tried flagging her down for water, small plates, questions on the menu, and it was so bizarre... She made eye contact, went to another table, and didn't revisit us or check up on us, ask us how our food was. After we lost faith in her, we tried flagging down other servers who walked by, but we might as well tried flagging down a train with no brakes. It was like... ""Zooommmm, not my problem.""  It felt bad being ignored and generally not acknowledged as guests and paying customers.  Foodwise, we got the great white pizza, cobb salad, avocado eggrolls, poke appetizer, fried artichoke small plate. The pizza was soggy, salad was mostly overdressed lettuce and no toppings, artichoke was mostly dense fried bread, and in the poke salad there was very little fish.  When we were almost done, our server went on lunch. We hoped that the new server would be more attentive, but NOPE. By the time we tried flagging someone down for the check, looking for our server, we felt like brats, saying ""pay attention to us!"" We definitely expect better service at BJs. After a while, we found our server flirting with the guy helping her run food... Very unprofessional.  Thanks Coleman BJs, but no more."
Briana S.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,2,2.0,4/24/2016,"I'm just so turned off by the customer service here. I probably won't be back by choice. We basically had to hunt down our waiter for refills. Our food took forever to arrive and once it did, we had to hunt our waiter down for utensils as well. The food tasted great, the service just sucked. Some people just aren't good at multitasking I guess."
Lety G.,"San Jose, CA",3,4,,1.0,10/23/2015,Horrendous service. Got seated and weren't acknowledge for a good 20 mins. All of the food my party ordered was cold upon its arrival to our table. Had to ask for utensils on 3 different occasions. One of our entrees didn't arrive until everyone was almost done with their meals. Also a beer that was ordered in the very beginning wasn't brought out until right before the check was brought out. On top of all this waited 45 mins for the server to process our payment because apparently paying with 3 cards and cash is incredibly difficult. Never coming here again.
Vivian L.,"San Jose, CA",18,17,11,1.0,9/12/2014,"Food was fine, but don't even get me started about the service. It was self seating so we found a table and sat. A man comes over and tells us that our server was a female, but a male show up as our server without explaining why it was not the female instead. Most of the time if the original server the table assign was going to be change the new server who comes will say something like oh ""so and so is going on a lunch break and I'll be taking his or her place"" but apparently that did not happen. So fine no big deal.  Our male server name was FRANK. He swing by took our order and some other guy came to deliver the food. We ate our food and was pretty much done. Frank comes back to the table and ask if we wanted dessert and we asked to give us a sec because we wanted to get a quick general consensus on whether we wanted to order or not. Well apparently Frank did not hear and said ""I'll come back"" because it was too much to ask to wait for 30 seconds. So there Frank goes off and the general consensus of our table was no dessert. We wanted to get the check instead and call it a night since it was getting pretty late.  We sat there for five minutes and see Frank no where in sight. Then after a few more minutes we still don't see Frank coming back to our table, so we ask another female server who walk pass by for the check. So apparently she tries to go around looking for Frank to tell him our table wants the check. Cuz apparently she can't go to the computer and punch in our table number to print the check since the computer was like right next to her. Fine..at this point we are already fed up with the speed of the service.  Frank then finally comes back with the check and goes missing again. We waited another five minute or so for him to swing back around, but yet still not sign of Frank. So one of use walk up to the front to ring up the check, but apparently they don't ring up the check. The people up at the front desk handled the check to another server who apparently also can't ring up the check goes on a major exploration to find Frank. Well of course by now reading this long we review you can all conclude that our server Frank goes ""missing"" a lot. So it took about another good five minutes for that server to find Frank. Our table at this point is very very upset at the speed of service. Come on how long does it take to ring up a check. It took almost as long for our food to come out from the kitchen. YES it was that ridiculous.  After at least a good 10 minute wait FRANK finally shows up with the check already ring up. AND GUESS WHAT??!! Frank with a very nasty attitude and voice told us ""Don't hand the other server the check cuz they have to go around to find me"" WELL Excuse me sir you were no where to be seen and we been waiting quite some time already. So friendly I reply back saying ""You were not around and we waited a long time"" Typically at this point you would expect the server to say ""Oh Im sorry to have kept you waiting."" But no FRANK here decided to back talk his customer saying ""Um NO I was right there at the table next to you"". Let me make it straight by the time Frank claiming himself to be at the table next to us we had already pass the check to the front desk long ago already. Last time I check server should be respectful to their customer. I am paying money for the food and service and this is how you treat your customer are you for real. Common courtesy that customer is to be respected and value when they enter your restaurant because they are the guest at your place. We will not be returning to this BJ location for its service is beyond disappointing and I hope future customer who goes does not have to experience a server like FRANK.  One more thing I still don't understand is why does every table need to only be designated one server. Yes I get that a server is in charge of certain tables, but why does it have to be split so clearly. This table is my customer and if they have some small problem like need plate or ring up check its none of my business since Im not the assign server for that table. Don't server works as a team yes you are assign a certain area table whatever, but why can't you help each other out since you are on the ""same team"" (same restaurant). Anyway this point is more a personal opinion I guess. I seen far more similar restaurant like BJ and their servers really know how to work as a team even if they were assign to tables meaning ring up check for their customer.  If you like to have good service I say save yourself the trouble and go to another BJ location."
Mike M.,"Santa Clara, CA",20,41,10,1.0,10/31/2014,"Let's start at the beginning... Appetizer: half and half boneless wings. Took a while for appetizers to show. When they showed up, only 5 pieces were on the plate--the other half of the plate was empty, but had remnants of sauce of pieces that WERE there. Not sure what that was about. Wife's entree: she ordered the kale and brussels sprouts salad with salmon. It came with no brussels sprouts whatsoever, and what looked like arugula instead of kale. It also had blueberries, which was not specified in the menu description. My entree: I ordered the salmon dinner. It was fine, until I discovered that one of the lemon wedges looked like it had been chewed upon already--very unappetizing. Also, it was hidden under the salmon, as if they were trying to hide it. I asked for the manager at that point. The server walked away to get the manager. We waited quite a while, and the kitchen manager came out to talk to us. Instead of apologies, he tried to explain that they use baby kale. It did not look like baby kale. Moreover, the salad was completely devoid of brussels sprouts. He went away to get my wife a bowl of Brussels sprouts and some lemon wedges for me. Instead of making us feel good about the outcome, he came across as arrogant and condescending, and we almost felt ashamed--but we were too upset to feel ashamed.  The server came back out, and noticed our dissatisfaction. She went back to look for the manager. After a long while (again), the manager came out to talk to us. I showed her the lemon wedge -instead of apologies, she started with ""let me teach you something about how lemons are cut in our kitchen..."" She went on about some mechanical cutter that automatically cuts lemons. My wife was displeased, but did not say anything at that point. I didn't buy the manager's story either. Most lemons I know are cut by hand with a knife. There's no process that I know of where lemons would be cut to look like they had small bites taken out of them. Again, no apologies. She was just as arrogant and condescending as the kitchen manager. We were done with the bullshitting experience. They took the boneless wings off of the bill, but we still ended up paying roughly $50 for a dinner experience that was subpar and disappointing. I was expecting a further discount for the unappetizingly lousy presentation, the extraordinarily long wait for our meals, the wrong dish being served to my wife, and for the overall treatment from both managers--the bullshitting and the arrogance.  I will never eat at a BJ's ever again. You see this kind of nightmare on Gordon Ramsey's show--I never thought restaurants could truly be this bad.  On the plus side, the server was quick--especially in processing my wife's debit card. At least that was fast."
Matthew M.,"San Jose, CA",1,6,,5.0,9/10/2016,"A great experience all around.  Gabby waited on our table and her cheerful disposition make for a very pleasurable dining experience. We had the fish and chips, which I asked to have cooked extra crispy. I have to admit it was the some of the best fish n chips I've ever had! The Brussel sprouts were delicious too. Thanks again Gabby for making our dining experience so memorable"
Alex F.,"Palo Alto, CA",189,8,1,2.0,11/11/2015,"Unless they were severely understaffed, which looking at the number of workers walking around was not the case, but took us well over 30 min to get our drink order in. Then our entrees arrived before our appetizers. Spinach artichoke dip isn't really a dessert but ok. I guess it was nice that the waiter didn't take our $5 tip, it was pretty much charity anyways. I would've said this was a fluke, but judging by the other reviews, pretty spot on. If your not in the mood for a pazookie then they're are much better options in the area."
Felicia S.,"Santa Clara, CA",38,4,,2.0,9/17/2014,"First off let me say I love bjs. And have been to many different locations; I love the variety of food as well as fast and speedy service. This is my first time and this location and our waitress SABRINA WAS HORRIBLE!  I am in the restaurant business and that was the WORSE SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! we waited 10 min to be greeted, then another 10 min to get waters. She only checked on us once the whole hour and half we were there. SABRINA WAS ONLY WITH ONE TABLE THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME BECAUSE THERE WERE YOUNGER MEN AT THAT TABLE. Also we had to ask other waiters as well busboys to help us multiple times. Never going back to this location again!  The food was great as always though! So thank you chefs! 5 stars"
Kathi L.,"San Jose, CA",6,5,,2.0,9/24/2016,"This was our first time here.  Didn't have to wait for a table, but it went downhill from there.  There was a big sticky splotch on the table. I ordered the summer peach drink, which the waiter described at sweet and tasty.  Since it was listed on the menu caffeine free, I ordered it.  When it arrived it tasted like unsweetened tea with peach syrup.  Asked the waiter and he confirmed that was what is was.  I told him I couldn't have caffeine so he replaced it with something else.  The watermelon feta salad is described as being made with arugula, but when it arrived, it was made with spring mix lettuce instead.  And, by the way, a fork is useful for eating a salad, but the server didn't seem to think that.  Then the artichoke spinach dip arrived.  Heated so long it was burned to a crisp around the edges.  Yummy.  The wings were ok and the fish and chips were good.  With so many places to choose from, why would I decide to go back here for a mediocre experience."
Spencer C.,"Pleasanton, CA",5,28,1,1.0,8/27/2014,"In JJ's posting below, she mentions walking out with her bf.  I am said bf and I'll describe what happened. We take a pager and go into the bar for a 5 min wait.  We both ordered beer and in 5 min the buzzer goes off. I take it back to the host section.  2 girls and a guy there.  I try to give the buzzer to the guy who's not doing squat and he points at the girl in front of him ""She'll help you"".  After the girl takes my buzzer this same guy grabs two menus and leads me to the booth.  Job specialization?  He's not trained in buzzer handling only menu handling?  Ok minor nit. We were both 1/4 of the say through our beers.  We scanned the menu, made our choices.  They wouldn't come by.  Beer 1/2 way done.  We closed our menus and put it the edge of the table.  No one comes, not even to bring water.  Beers 3/4 done - my gf stops someone and says ""We haven't been helped yet"".  Staff person looks confused, says ""OK"" and goes away and doesn't come back. Beers now finished.  I make the call to walk out.  On our way out I told the girl at the hostess station (the non buzzer handler wasn't there) that we finished our drinks and no one came by to take our order and we were leaving. Now at this point, a manager should have been called, an offer could have been made  - dessert on the house, drink on the house, 10% off coupon, SOMETHING to let me know you want my business back.  She just looked bewildered and said ""Oh, I'm so sorry"".  I even said ""I'm not chewing you out, just giving you feedback"". She nodded. I will say the BJ's in Dublin is better - not great, but better.   As JJ said below, I blame management.  Customer service is largely determined by culture and if your manager doesn't care (he probably doesn't even read these - my single star is not an isolated case) then your employees won't care. That night they lost our business to Chili's where the food isn't as good but they were all over it on service."
Martin N.,"San Jose, CA",246,132,103,4.0,12/27/2014,"BJ's is usually a hit or miss, but it's more like 3.5 stars for the service and 3.5 for the food. I just want to round up, since I'm nice. I got the 'new' deep dish lasagna, but it was more like ravioli in a deep dish. I'm not complaining, but I thought it was kind of funny. Good overall though! The waitress was really nice, but it took her awhile to give us our waters and come back to take our orders. We had to search for her. At the end of the meal, she kept forgetting to give us a box, even though we asked like 3 times. I always have a good experience at BJs, so there isn't much to complain about. For 3 people we were told that the wait was 20-30 minutes, but it was really 10! Awesome!!!"
Patty A.,"San Jose, CA",7,22,,5.0,9/2/2016,My boyfriend and I have been there a few times. We loved out waitress Alicia. She goes above and beyond to make our eating experience awesome- ie -put the college basketball on for my fanatic boyfriend. She knows the menu well and is able to make suggestions. We will be going back for the yummy food and for the great service :)
P D.,"San Jose, CA",0,22,,1.0,10/11/2016,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! They are very slow in seating people, taking orders and delivering the  food. Their staff is not friendly. We ended getting our food very late and one of the members in our party needed to take medicine and eat right away. We had our party member take the medicine after the waitress told us the food will be here in 30 minutes. It did not come until an hour later. Over it took us 3+ hours to sit, eat and leave. I've never gone back since and don't think I'll ever go back. I told my cousins and family members to avoid this place and they haven't gone since."
Daniela Q.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,5.0,8/28/2016,"Great server Kilvy C I been coming here ever since this location opened the servers that usually help me are slow and don't check if I need anything else, with Kilvy was the  opposite he was fast friendly and made sure everyone in my party was satisfied definitely coming back and requesting him as my server"
Judge C.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,33,16,1.0,10/30/2015,Left my makeup bag with work id and house keys among other things. Once I realized this I called them. They put me on hold for a while so I called back. My cute bag was at one of the two person booths near the front. At the second or third booth from the entry way. Not hard to find especially if you work there. They took my number just incase but said it wasn't there. I had called in a time frame where even if someone had sat there my purse would've still been there and unless that person had a huge bag with a zipper there's no way you couldn't see my glittery turquoise and white makeup bag. So I'm quite under the impression one of their employees is a thief and I'm thinking it very well may have been the girl who answered the phone. I also no they don't entirely hire wholesome people. NECER COMING HERE AGAIN
Dean B.,"Campbell, CA",15,183,59,4.0,1/10/2015,"Great lunch spot!  I usually get seated quickly and the service is great.  For the lunch crowd they really make sure that you get in and out quickly.  The food is pretty good with a small lunch menu, which helps them prepare the food quickly.  But unfortunately I have not tried the beer yet, and will have to come back at happy hour."
David P.,"San Jose, CA",3,18,29,1.0,11/26/2014,Worse service ever. Food before drinks. 45 minutes waiting for kids pizza.  Last time in here.  I guess was a big party around.  More tips 18%.  A/c on cold really cold.
Arika G.,"San Jose, CA",31,176,181,1.0,9/16/2014,"This review is based on the curb side take out. I have ordered for the curbside take out twice and both times have sucked. Today we placed an order for curbside takeout and mind you placed it 1 hour prior to the pick up time. When arriving, we had to wait 20 more minutes for our food. We didn't order anything fancy, just a few sandwiches, salads and soups. When asked to speak with a manager, we waiting for 5 minutes and no one came out. The only reason we left was due to our strict lunch hour; hence the reason we ordered to go.  The food looked sloppy and was not very tasteful. Oh & they forgot my mozzarella tomato salad. Will never order to go from here again. Dine in if anything. Don't think you should have to to get the same food quality but clearly that's what you have to do in order for a decent meal."
Michelle M.,"San Jose, CA",2,167,5,1.0,10/31/2014,"This location is a disaster.  A group of us from work have tried to eat lunch there a few times and there is always a problem.  First, you have to stand in the lobby area for five minutes waiting to be seated when the place is empty.  (Hint: maybe have your servers start 15 minutes earlier.) Then it might take another 10 minutes to get a drink. (Again, servers are just getting settled.) Then it is impossible to get your appetizers before your entrees.  And I am not exaggerating here...we have had this problem so many times that during our last visit, we were really specific with the server about the fact that he might not want to put our entree order in until our apps came, but we still got our entrees before the appetizers...and our sliders came as dessert.  And to add insult to injury, somebody's order is always messed up.  And when I say a group of us, we are usually 4 to 6 people, so our order should not disrupt the kitchen in any way. Our servers are usually friendly and I suspect the problem is all in the kitchen, but they have been like this for months.   Chilis, here we come!"
