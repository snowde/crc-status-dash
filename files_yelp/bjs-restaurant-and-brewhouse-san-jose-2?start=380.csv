Brian B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",373,1302,44,4.0,1/1/2014,"I never used to like BJ's, but I've had good experiences at this one.  The food has been great on both visits, as has the fact that they've been running a grand opening special of 2 starters, a pizza, and a pizookie for $20.  I'm definitely a fan of BJ's now. We had great service one time, and comically terrible service another time.  I guess BJ's are supposed to always be like this for service?  Doesn't matter, I'll still be headed back."
Nancy F.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,141,21,2.0,1/15/2015,"i've had enough of this place. This place is always busy, but usually it's not more than a 15 min wait for 2 during the busiest time of the day. I usually come here on weekdays to take advantage of the tail end of their happy hr (ends 7pm). I came on a Wednesday right before 7. They took my name and gave me a buzzer and said it would be about 15 min. Ok, so we go to the bar to order some drinks at happy hr prices. lemon drop martini and mojito for only $5 each!  We wait near the front, and about 20 min go by so we decided to check with the receptionist. turns out they never put my name in. So they said we would be the next party to be seated. I see about 3 groups go, (granted they had 3+ people), but we still waited another 15 min before we were seated. Unacceptable. We should have just sat in the bar area. When we sat down, it took awhile for the waiter to greet us. Then, she didnt even ask us what we wanted to drink. Instead, she was ready to take our order. Also, we had to ask another waiter for utensils. :/ I ordered the fish and chips, which i felt the batter could have been less heavy. My husband ordered the deep dish lasagna, which really should be renamed ravioli. Both were mediocre. The best part of BJ's is really the pizookie, but that's about it. Otherwise, stay away."
Celeste D.,"San Jose, CA",39,5,,2.0,2/21/2016,"Well, when you finally get the food it's pretty standard. What can I say? I waited an hour for a random burger. It was edible. The server, when one finally showed after about 30 minutes, was nice. He just couldn't bring us any food because the kitchen doesn't seem to be very quick on the draw in that department. I drank beer. House IPA. Also unremarkable. Then ordered another because there was still no food. The kids showed exponential self control in not misbehaving. Don't eat here.  Not if you're hungry or value your time."
Patsy C.,"San Jose, CA",9,38,2,2.0,11/10/2014,"You know what I dislike? When I come into a restaurant on a relatively slow day and receive inadequate service. Before people start judging and say ""You're too unreasonable!""-- I KNOW what quality service should be like, and I've worked in the the restaurant business before as a hostess/server. So I KNOW the struggle. Because of that I am a lot more empathetic to my fellow server brothers and sisters. But honestly, not everyone is cut out for this type of job.  When someone doesn't greet me, check in with me, or even bring me water after they finally came around to ""check in,"" there is something wrong there. Another waiter brought out our drinks, the bus boy brought out our food, and the young woman who was supposed to be ""serving"" us was talking to the same person 5 booths away for us for about 20-30 minutes. When she FINALLY came around, she claimed she ""forgot"" our drinks and apologized, then went BACK to talk to that person. At that point I was ready to not tip her. But the empathetic ex-server in me told me I couldn't do a disservice to the bus boy and other server who actually did above and beyond what they were supposed to do. We had another server pick up our check because she never came back to pick it up. When we finally left the restaurant, she was STILL talking to that person. I really hope BJ's works on different trainings and workshops for their servers so that they are motivated to do their job well. Or at least have management stress the need for servers to stay professional and aware of their guests, even if management isn't on site."
Mike P.,"San Jose, CA",126,286,309,1.0,12/19/2013,"THIS IS FOR TAKE-OUT.  I understand that the quality of take-out from a chain is usually worse than dining in, especially at an American chain restaurant, so take EVERYTHING I say with a grain of salt.  That being said... My first 1-star review!  I don't usually write a review the day-of unless it's truly memorable (or something I should remember), but since I am currently curled up in a fetal position because BJ's destroyed my insides and it hurts to move, I might as well just go for it.   We ordered online.  I got the black-and-bleu (bacon, bleu cheese, garlic aoili) burger with thin cut fries.  My coworkers got the steak, 2 pizzas, and a chocolate chip pizookie.  Things they could have improved on: 1.) Not putting the fries inside the container, so when they arrive they are not soggy from the heat condensation.  They could at least put them in a bag or something.   Ditto applies to the burger bun.  I don't care how much parmesean you fry onto the bun if it's still soggy.  Soggy buns might be even worse than soggy fries, because you can't NOT eat a burger bun.  That being said, I ate everything; something I would regret.   2.) Don't overcook our steak, please.  ""Medium rare"" does not mean charcoal.  Admittedly, it was their mistake, because whenever you order steak from non-steakhouses, you should always order a doneness level below what you want, but going from medium rare to inedible-charcoal-covered-meat-nugget is a pretty unacceptable.  I know this, because I tried it, and it was like eating a lump of squishy coal.  I would later regret this.  Do you see where this is going?   3.) Check our order before you send us off on our way.  They forgot our pizookie.  THE SIGNATURE ITEM OF BJ'S!   HOW CAN YOU FORGET IT?  It's even wrapped in gaudy-ass aluminum pie mold!    So we called back, asked for our pizookie, and for a non-rare steak, and, much to my surprise, they agreed to give it back to us!  Nice one, management!  That being said, when my boss went to pick it up, three ladies were chatting outside, and it took five minutes before they noticed that she was waiting for our replacement order.  So... not so great, management.    But the coup de grace is really the fact that I am curled up in a ball, a full five hours after I have eaten, sick as a dog.  I don't know whether it was the soggy, greasy fries that I ate, the bleu cheese and garlic aoili that simmered in their plastic containers, my foolish sampling of the overcooked charcoalsteak, or all of the above, but I feel like DEATH.  Food is supposed to bring me joy; thank you, BJ's, for taking that away from me.   We did get a kick out of making ""dry BJ's"" jokes though.  So thanks for that, I guess."
Roslyn A.,"San Jose, CA",46,15,2,2.0,11/20/2015,1st time here and the check in was horrible they tell you to call 30 minutes ahead ...I get here and they tell me it's another 20 minutes and they were rude and didn't want to put my name down after they couldn't even find my name.... there was 30 people waiting.
Marty M.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,1,1.0,10/1/2016,"Just ordered their Sriracha Bacon Chicken Mac N' Cheese through Door Dash. There's no bacon, cheese, or Sriracha. I just paid for wet noodles with chicken and broccoli. I've given them a few chances, but their food is so hit or miss...."
Laura I.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/1/2016,"Came here to watch a Warriors game on a crowded Friday night with my boyfriend and wanted to just relax and have a slow dinner to watch as much as we could.  Argus was awesome!!! He didn't rush us at all, was super friendly and made it a great experience. I've eaten at a lot of BJs, but this one is by far my favorite!"
Paulina D.,"San Francisco, CA",131,157,10,1.0,9/13/2014,"This BJ's is pretty terrible. The food is standard and generic. The service, however, is what sets it apart. It's awful.  I was looking at my menu and the waiter put a napkin down right where I was looking. Seriously? I was reading that. Also, I'm starving. I will go hunger rage on your ass.  He brought waters out for only half our table. Bro, the chicken wings you brought out were super spicy because you didn't change the sauce. How am I supposed to reduce this fire in my mouth?"
Cindy H.,"San Francisco, CA",207,19,33,1.0,9/14/2014,"I wish I could give no stars. Service was slow and horrible. Food was terrible. The grilled chicken pasta: bland! Came with 4 pieces of broccoli. Spinach article dip: meh, nothing special. Calamari: had a bitter and burnt taste to it. We asked the server if it was burnt and she said no, that's how their calamari is. She offered to take it back but it was pointless. I will not be returning. P.S. I just found a small shard of glass On the side of my shot glass. What. The. Hell."
Sarah K.,"Silicon Valley, CA",97,212,151,3.0,12/8/2013,"Aw, this place actually isn't THAT bad. Granted, I came during happy hour - maybe that's got something to do with it. I ordered the happy hour sliders and like 2 beers. Both beers (i don't remember the names) were recommended by my waitress and they were pretty darn good. AND i didn't know you could have 3 free beer samples at BJs! I've never been told that! So that was a plus. I don't know if a lot of people know about it - the table next to me certainly didn't because after I got my 3, they flagged their waitress to get their 3 lol and they were a table of 10 or so lololol 30mini-cups. The negatives are for the food quality. My sliders (2 on the plate for $6 + potato wedges and a few pickles on salad) were pretty overgreased and there was barely anything inside. Their potato wedges were great but still didn't make up for the overly-greased sliders. And my friend had the happyhour menu wings and there were literally like 5 pieces. I mean I know it's cheap and it's happy hour but ~5 pieces?! dang... that's just sad. The one plus for food was their mini pizza which was also $6. that one was pretty good in size (personal pizza size) and tasty.  But I will be back! Because I can't say no to their beers. And I found a list of award-winning drinks I want to try - perhaps all at once :D ...but after finals.  in 2 weeks. can't wait. argh."
Michelle K.,"Mountain View, CA",9,47,8,4.0,9/26/2014,"Pretty good place! Watched the 49ers game here last Sunday. There was a surprising amount of good viewing here! The bar is best with all the TVs, but lots of the regular seating area has good viewing and good sound too!  We decided to try something other than the yummy pizzas for a change and I was pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend got the buffalo burger which he said was really good and a bit lighter than a normal burger. I got tomato soup in a sourdough bread bowl. The bowl was surprisingly good with some garlic and herbs on it.  There beer and drink selection is pretty good too and decent price during happy hour."
Allisha A.,"Campbell, CA",24,25,,4.0,1/29/2016,"I came here for happy hour the other day. Excellent beer selection, and the wings were yummy! The food is decent, but still a little pricey (even with happy hour prices), but the ambience is fun, especially for bigger groups, and our server was very pleasant. And did I mention the delicious beers on tap?! I like this place a lot!"
Jack T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",66,258,121,4.0,11/24/2013,"BJ's Brewhouse has typically been one of my more favorite chain-type restaurants because they brew their own beer and their food is typically good. This Coleman location is no different. Lots of drink specials for house beers and happy hour food options. + Good beer options, house or not + Happy hour is on a lot for house beers + Service is friendly + Parking is not too bad - Front door staff is a work in progress. Three people in the front and I walk in and they still don't even look in my direction. But they were helpful once they figure out that they need to greet me It's not as crazy crowded as the Cupertino location and wortha  visit!"
Sony M.,"Milpitas, CA",0,11,,5.0,9/1/2015,"Pizookie!! yum yum :) lip smacking dessert is on your way.   Perfect place for special occasion like Birthday lunch or dinner. We reserved table one day before and had Pizza and Pizookie for my office colleague birthday lunch.  We ordered Chicken barbeque pizza and Hawaiian pizza.  The pizzas were delicious.  As I am vegetarian I asked waitress to do half n half for no bacon on hawaiian pizza.  This place is amazing. Service was good. Our waitress refill the glasses as and when its about to over. After main course, we order regular size pizookie which is good enough for six people.    Also we told waitress that our colleague has birthday today, so she brought small pizookie with burning candle on it, that was so awesome.  Special treat for birthday boy ;) !!"
vanessa e.,"San Jose, CA",5,26,4,1.0,8/17/2014,"As I am sitting waiting for my food going on 40 minutes now, I am wondering to myself why I masochistically keep coming to this location. The service is terrible. It's almost humiliating how they treat you as soon as you walk in the door. Not to mention, oh you want food?! No, they will make you feel like a vagrant begging for scraps when you wonder where your food is after 30 minutes. It's just unbelievable.  Also it's awesome how they blamed the wait on the pizzas taking too long but the pizzas weren't even hot when they came out. Great job! Way to treat your customers like idiots."
Linnea E.,"San Jose, CA",364,689,145,5.0,11/22/2013,"I see some pretty unfavorable reviews here... not sure if maybe I just got lucky? well whatever the reason, i'm ok with it.  i think it's a good location. service:  seemed good to me.  i did have to flag someone down for takeout once, but wasn't a big deal.  i just asked the hostess, and she got someone over there right away.  the people who have helped me have all been great. the food:  have to admit, i don't sample the menu.  i like the sesame chicken salad, and order it almost every time.  it's so good!  sometimes they go a little heavy on the white part of the cabbage, which i don't care for.  but all in all, a great dish.  LOTS of chicken on it, and the flavor is wonderful.  the dressing is sweet and thick, so it goes a long way with a small amount.  i've had the avocado eggrolls too.  they are yummy! i'm not as fond since they changed the recipe to add cream cheese, but still ok. i'd subtract a star for the whole pepsi thing (bleh)... but not really their fault at the location.  but if bj's corporate reads this... one word... COKE! ;)"
Ashleigh F.,"Watsonville, CA",37,33,2,1.0,7/13/2014,"AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!! This was my third and LAST visit to this location. The only reason I went to this location was for the free Pizookie Day, as well as the app stating the wait was about 5-10 minutes. Using the ""Order Ahead"" feature for the Pizookie promo was fairly easy.  Upon arriving to the restaurant, that's where everything started south. The wait was 45 minutes and once we were seated, we were not acknowledged by our waiter for about 10 minutes. There wasn't that many people inside, which made me think that they were understaffed. Once he did come over, we explained that we had used the app to order ahead. The copy if the order was on a receipt placed on the table. He looked at it then disappeared for 10-15 minutes to confirm the order was in the kitchen. He walked by but said nothing about the order being prepared which was odd.  30 minutes later, a manager came to our table to apologize for our order not being received! I was really close to hangry, but I stayed calm. 15 minutes later, my man's pizza arrived to our table with the manager.  He thought that's what we ordered, but my pizza was missing! In disbelief the manager asked to see the order confirmation email, and was embarrassed to see that I was correct. After profuse apologies, I received my pizza 15-20 minutes later. Overall it took over an hour for an order! Also when the Pizookie arrived, it was cold :(  Despite the manager comping the meal and our waiter being apologetic, this visit was the final straw. I refuse to come back to this location, and I highly suggest that corporate do some training. This location is damaging the reputation of a decent restaurant chain."
Lan N.,"San Jose, CA",213,445,81,3.0,11/8/2013,"This location still needs to find its legs. I went here with some friends and was told it was a 1 hour wait, but it actually turned out to be 30 minutes which was a good surprise. The place itself seems good for watching sports, but the bar looks be a bit small. They have a big screen that they split different ways to show sports. The night I went had NFL, NCAAF, NHL, and NBA all playing at once. There are some big screens scattered around the restaurant. As well as one outside on the patio area! Food wise, I was dissapointed in the pizza. I usually like the BJs deep dish, but here it was too flimsy. Needed more crunch on that crust. Also, the guy who brought the pizza just plopped it on the stand without saying anything. He also put it off center which I had to fix otherwise it might have fallen over.  Service from our server was good when she was around, but sometimes it felt like she dissapeared for a long time. One of our people were missing something and it took a while to get that rectified. Even though there seems to be a lot of staff, I wonder what proportion are actually servers? I think a few more would help out."
Jenny D.,"San Jose, CA",9,10,1,2.0,9/22/2015,"Went here to eat around 630 pm last night (9/21). Wait wasn't long (10-15 min). We came in, I was giving my name she said the wrong name, I simply corrected the host, not a big deal, but she had to comment with an attitude ""Well yeah you're over there I couldn't hear you."" Ok? Yeah there was some distance, I was getting over a cold and I didn't want to be in her face. But that was unnecessary. We got to our table. We ordered our drinks and appetizers right away. We got our drinks and ordered our entrees. About 15 min we get our appetizers. Everything's going smoothly. Our waitress is consistently asking if we're doing ok. Once she cleaned up the empty plates that's where everything went downhill... After that, she never once came to our table to let us know the situation with our food. We kept looking at the time because I actually work graveyard so I wanted to make sure I had time. We were waiting close to an HOUR for our food. What made it even worse was that we were noticing people around us. FOUR TABLES WHO CAME AFTER US received their drinks, appetizers, entrees, and some had dessert as well while we were STILL waiting for our entrees. All we got were two small pizzas, ravioli, and a burger... My pizza was flat out cold/warm, probably due to the fact that they made mine first and it was just sitting there? I didn't want to send it back because who knows how long that would take. The guy behind us had ribs and other things, the table on the other side had a few people with full entrees dishes... The other guy who I noticed ordered while we were eating our appetizer received their food before we even got ours...And the other table were already eating their dessert and they were seated after us.... All that was bullshit. We were ready to leave and our waitress finally came. No apologies. Didn't acknowledge that we were waiting. She didn't say anything. She acted as if nothing happened... And conveniently she had to go to break. She mentioned that there was someone who was gonna take over, BUT she didn't introduce us which they usually do, so we didn't even know who to ask if we needed anything. I seriously didn't think we should have even paid for our drinks or something. It's bullshit. 4 tables who came after our appetizers received their meals, drinks, etc. first.... Don't know where the manager was, usually they come table to table to ask how everything is..."
