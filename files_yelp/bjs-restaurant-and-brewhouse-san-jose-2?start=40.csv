Jia Qi F.,"East Bay, CA",557,202,429,2.0,1/9/2017,"We got seated at 8PM and we didnt get to leave by 11PM on a Sunday night...how is this possible?! Answer: slow service to the MAX.  Food was mediocre and overpriced, nothing too fancy about it. I usually come here for the pizookies anyways. We ordered a mini salted caramel pizookie and it was pretty bomb. I was a little sad that our icecream basically melted by the time we got it but I was over it. We loved the ### of TVs in this place. Slow service however kinda ruined it for me and our party."
Martin N.,"New York, NY",387,85,99,4.0,7/29/2017,"I will always come to BJ's for their pizookies. They are seriously the best ever!! But of course, the rest of the menu is great. Be careful of the machine on the table. I played around with it too much and ended up accidentally paying for the games, which is my fault. Though I wish it was more clear about it."
Gigi G.,"San Jose, CA",11,14,1,5.0,9/25/2017,"We had just ended a really tough couple of days, packing and moving. We decided we would try BJs because of location and we simply didn't want to cook, to tired.  Along comes Andrew, who had a big smile, genuine smile, and proceeded to make our day!  You see he is also a brew master there, and just was what we needed! He brought drinks promptly, helped with our order, even went to mgr. with a special request for us! He couldn't have been more friendly and professional, it doesn't happen often around here, we WILL be back!"
Alan W.,"San Francisco, CA",359,17,4,5.0,8/17/2017,"I love this place.  Great foods and superior services.  I always come here for major sports events and man, do they make it fun.   the service is always quick and and precise, even with all the patrons in there.   I highly recommend if you have any major events or just come to watch your favorite team play, this is the place."
Cynthia H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/26/2017,"Went here today for lunch with a colleague and ordered the cherry chipotle salmon, which in the past has been tasty. The service was slow. The asparagus was woody and dry--obviously very old. I reported this and received tasteless, steamed mixed vegetables in return.  When I was halfway through the meal, I discovered a pubic hair in it. So I won't be going back."
Keith D.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,7,,1.0,7/15/2017,"This was such a disappointing experience. A couple few months ago, I went to this BJ's for lunch. I had the grilled cheese with bacon, avocado, and tomato. I've been craving it ever since. I finally had an opportunity to return for lunch. I went to order the same thing but couldn't find it on the menu. Jackie told me I could still order it. (You should it back to the menu.) I ordered the sandwich and requested that the fried be extra crispy. Jackie brought me by Tontonka stout and that was the last I saw of her. Sadly for me, she was given a party of at least 15 people. While she was taking their drink orders, someone else delivered my order. The sandwich was perfect and exactly what I remembered. The fries were soft, not extra crispy. But no one ever checked back with me to ask about my food, and I didn't get the chance to flag down anyone else either. At first, I thought I would just eat my sandwich, and then eat the fries after they were correctly prepared. I don't necessarily mind eating one item at a time. Sadly, by the time I was done with my sandwich, Jackie had just appeared with the drink orders. I was ready to leave by then. I had planned on ordering dessert, but I paid my bill via the app and left. Jackie was still handing out drinks. I did not get to eat the part of my order that I paid for (fries) and I did not get to order dessert. Very disappointing. Your hosts (and managers in this case) should never seat such a large party at the same time as a 1-4 top. The upfront work required for ordering guarantees that someone is going to get ignored--not from bad service, but simple logistics. It takes a long time to get take down drink orders and fulfill them. It can be even longer when it comes to the meal (though at least there's a gap while the cooks prepare the food). Please note that this is not necessarily Jackie's fault. The host slammed her and made it impossible for her to serve me well. If that large party and I had been seated an very different times, there likely would have been less interference with good service to both parties. The wifi didn't work either. :-("
Manisha C.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",47,3,1,5.0,11/2/2017,Great salad and service last night. Our waiter was Carlos and he provided great service. Santa Fe Salad is the best. We also ordered Kale and Brussels sprouts salad which was also really yummy. Thanks BJs.
Michelle G.,"San Jose, CA",23,18,1,1.0,10/8/2017,Oktoberfest Fail...... 8 of us came for lunch and mainly to have the Oktoberfest beer.  No Oktoberfest?????  Why BJ's.?  I dont get it.   We all left and went to Chili's.
Mike H.,"Hudsonville, MI",156,114,212,2.0,11/21/2016,"Went here after a long day of travel. Myself and a couple of colleagues got there after 8:00 to grab a late dinner. I was starving and the waiter took our drink order really fast, which was promising but I was misled. That was the last quick thing that happened for us that evening. Our drinks showed up and then the waiter totally evaporated, he was swallowed up by the throng. It was over 35 minutes until he returned to take our order and another 50 until our food arrived. The burger was lackluster at best but I devoured it based on my basic need for food. I don't think I'll be back here again."
Debbie D.,"Scotts Valley, CA",39,42,7,1.0,10/11/2017,"Sorry, but I rarely give a bad rating.  The deep fried artichoke hearts were salty and burnt.  The server forgot our lemon that we wanted for our water, then brought them over with his bare hands and plopped them in our glasses after handling money.  They forgot my sandwich order, so I didn't bother to wait.  This is my last trip here."
Jon H.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",313,121,201,5.0,8/2/2016,"Great experience recently. Went in for the afternoon and got an app for free with a 10$ purchase. Sign up for the app and the coupon is there. Or take the link in Yelp.  Free wifi. Great beer choices from amber to IPA to red to Hefeweizen that they make themselves plus about 20 other beers on tap.  Avocado egg rolls and veggie burger is usually my order but all burgers, salads, apps, and main dishes look good as well. Pizza looks like a winner too.  Not sure why this place is a 2.5 because it's been good food and service all five times I have been here. Sometimes it can have a long line.  Lastly, the day time bartender, Stephanie, was nice, helpful and definitely added to our experience."
denise q.,"San Jose, CA",4,8,2,5.0,11/1/2017,"We came here to celebrate my daughters accomplishment, there was about 15 of us   We had the best and most patient waitress named Danielle   She took great care of us and our crying kid!   Thank you for accommodating all of us.  We had a great time ..... Denise"
Sherin L.,"Santa Clara, CA",370,182,221,5.0,6/15/2017,"Great hang out place after work. Easy parking (at least for me,depends on time), great service, good food.  Our server is great comparing to other reviews, I prefer this location than others just because I hate waiting in line."
Adrian D.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,1.0,9/24/2017,"I don't usually write reviews, but our experience at this BJ's was absolutely terrible. First of all, we called ahead to ask about the wait time. We were told that it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait, so we asked if we could put our names down over the phone. The host put our names down, but when we got to the restaurant 10 minutes later, we were told that we would still need to wait 10 - 15 minutes for our table.  Once we sat down, the service was so slow, it was almost non-existent. It took forever for the waiter to get to our table (mind you, this was a Slow Sunday evening) just to take our drink orders. It also took forever for us to get our food. But that wasn't even the worst part. I ordered the jambalaya, and when I bit into the shrimp, it was raw! When this was brought to the waiter's attention he offered to re-fire another plate but I just asked him to bring another portion of shrimp in order to make it easier on the staff. This re-fired portion of shrimp literally came at the end of the meal when everything else on the plate was finished. Also, my boyfriend's Dad ordered a pizza and asked for light sauce because of how the acidity affects his stomach. He politely emphasized this when the waiter was reading back the order, but when the order finally came, it was with extra sauce!! Everyone else (we came with 6 people) didn't care much for their food either. Every plate that came to the table was cold which made the already bad quality food taste even worse.  None of us will be coming back to this or possibly any BJ's ever again."
Da Kat A.,"San Jose, CA",20,16,,2.0,10/19/2017,"I've been here many times.  Almost every time I come (95%) and after ordering appetizers, they don't give us any silverware and plates.  The appetizers arrived first and all we could do was to stare at our food, then had to get someone to get us plates and silverwares. Tonight is worse.  We got seated at a booth but one of the booth is dirty (still with food particles on it).  I stood there and waited for 10 mins, no one bothered to come check or clean it.  I walked closer to the cash register area and saw a bunch of waiters/waitresses just hung out there to chat and watch TV.  I had to ""interrupt"" them and then somehow finally came to clean the booth. Their service sucks and they don't care if you just stand there by the table, or if you don have any silverwares/plates to eat your appetizers."
Harris W.,"Los Gatos, CA",1,18,4,1.0,8/16/2017,Tonight was a disaster. Three meals ordered. When two arrived after a 30 min wait we were told the 3rd order isn't served on Tues. Wow after 30 min and with 2 orders arriving its oops sorry would you like to see a menu. Fast forward another 30 minutes the replacement dish arrives ICE cold. WTF. For our troubles here's a gift card and  no charge tonight. How about firing the waitress who phones it in.  She didn't give a sh** about anything.
Laura M.,"San Jose, CA",9,10,4,2.0,11/1/2017,"Ok am giving this place two stars  both are for our server who tried his best.  A for effort dude! But, the meals, when they came to the table looked nothing like they did in the menu. My Ahi salad was like warm. The Calamari app was Soo salty and cold. The strawberry desert was floating in a sea of strawberry puree, and maybe there was 1strawberry cut into quarters. This is a chain, I would expect consistency. ""Sadfaceimojihere"""
Eleuterio O.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,10,4,5.0,10/29/2017,"I love this place! The food, the atmosphere, the service; you name it, everything is good. Any restaurant we have visited, we always get the same service, from down in San Diego to up in the Bay Area. Whenever we're out and about, I'm always looking for one. Highly recommend them all."
Kelly C.,"Clovis, CA",0,36,51,1.0,9/24/2017,OK we are frequent flyers at BJ's what the heck happen to the Santa fe chopped salads and the Tortilla Soup! I use to love both of these items the chop salad is Now not chopped and the tortilla soup use to come hot in a ladle that the waiter would pour over for you on your yummy chicken and veggies and now it just comes out already poured and most the time cold! Boo! I miss this place but why go back for just beer when I can get a beer and meal anywhere. This isn't the only location that has dropped the ball. I travel for work from Bakersfield to the Santa Rosa and further frequently. I miss you BJ's! (SAD FACE)!
Tuan P.,"Mountain View, CA",10,226,47,3.0,11/19/2016,"Typical BJ's story: Arrive at 530 pm. 630 pm pizza and salad is out. Steak missing, 2 kids meals missing. Kitchen cannot keep up with orders here. Waiter had manager comp the meal. Wait was so long we had two waiters as we covered a shift change. Wait staff not to blame, left a full tip. Calamari - not very crispy, maybe too long under the heat lamp Deep dish - small half bbq chicken, half Philly chicken - wifey remarked pizza never seems to come out hot - better eaten at home reheated in the oven to get the crisp back Mac n cheese - Kraft had perfected this dish - kids first love Pepperoni pizza - dbp says good but would not get it again Bbq chicken salad - consistently good across chains Rib eye steak - ordered medium rare which became a problem in the kitchen - apparently they kept overcooking it - kudos for not serving badly cooked steak - sad face for requiring 1.5 hours to make - wifey says French fries are super thin, crispy, and good Pizookie chocolate chip - it's hot, dbp protip use icecream to cool it down macadamia nut - ong noi fave and maybe the sole reason we come here and brave the marathon dinners Snicker doodle - always good strong in the cinnamon"
