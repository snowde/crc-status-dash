Dominique V.,"Arcata, CA",80,27,58,5.0,1/30/2015,"Thank you for finally putting another Restaurant in this prior vacant building. Hopefully this one will stay this time!  I shop at the Coleman shopping center at least 3 days a week. I was happy to find out yesterday that they put a BJs in the facility. We went for happy hour. Got the $6 wine and $4 spirit happy hour specials. Ate stuffed mushrooms, fried artichokes, avocado egg rolls, and chicken wraps. Good prices for the portion size.  Our server was Davey Jones! He was very attentive to our needs. We had questions about the menus and he was knowledgeable and helpful on decisions we were trying to make. With his service made our stay enjoyable."
Hernandez S.,"San Jose, CA",1,6,1,2.0,2/5/2016,"Came here on Friday night and I knew it would be busy and I didn't mind the wait, what I did mind was the bad service we received. The food was good but the server was mediocre at best! Towards the end of the meal she rushed is not knowing that we had planned to order another drink and dessert. She came with the check without asking if we wanted anything else and kept hovering around for us to leave.  As close as the location is to home I would think again before coming to this location."
Chris N.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/18/2016,"Went for my birthday last night. Made a reservation 5 hours in advance. It took 25 minutes to get seated. Took a hour for just 2 appetizers to come out. Our server (lolly) barely came to our table. Hair was wrapped in my sisters napkin with her utensils. I asked for a side of marinara for my daughter since there was barely any in her spaghetti, took 10 minutes to get it. Her food by then was cold. The burger condaments were just thrown on the side of our burgers. It was very difficult to eat. My family ordered me a pazooki when we got our food so we knew it wouldnt take forever after we ate. We were done with the food. And still no pazooki. Took over 30 min to get. We eventually got up to leave. As were were walking out, they brought it to us. I am never one to complain. I understand busy nights get hectic. But this was just not a good night for them."
Joseph R.,"Hayward, CA",464,32,6,1.0,12/21/2015,Just the worst experience I ever had. I've been to a few of them. But this one by far sucked. They kept messing up our order. Then saying oh wait let's see. So my thoughts are please don't come here. Unless you want the worst. Even as a BJ rewards member. All shorts of bad news.
lisa r.,"San Jose, CA",5,33,3,1.0,7/22/2014,"My visit to your restaurant was extremely disappointing. I had a lunch date with my daughter and we decided to come to BJ's and what a waste of time. DO NOT GO FOR LUNCH HOUR! We arrived at 1205 pm today and were told that we had a 10-15 min wait. I asked about the patio and was told that the server was new so we would have to wait for her to get her large group settled first. There were zero other patrons on the patio btw, but we waited and when seated, we were approached by another staff member who offered to get us beverages. I noticed that the large group was just now placing their orders and it did not look like we would be helped anytime soon. Well now its about 1230 and my daughter and I decide, we should get food to go because we wont have enough time if we sit here and wait.  We go to the take out order area that is unmanned, and wait again. We place our order and are told it may take some extra time because the kitchen is a little backed up! it is now 1240pm but we decide to wait. At this time I also ask to speak to the MOD who I am told is in the kitchen helping out.  I wait for her for about 7 mins and when she arrives she didn't apologize, offer anytype of service recovery incentive.   She simply asked what kind of pizza we had ordered and said she would speak to the staff.  I offered her the training opportunity advice of training your staff not to share the details of your poorly staffed and managed establishment and to instead thank the customer for their patience and offer them some gesture of  food or beverage. Even something as cheap as iced tea would calm people that are waiting. I did not need to know that the server was new, or that the kitchen was short staffed etc. I don't really care about that as a consumer, just want to know how I am going to be helped at the moment.  It was an extremely lovely and sunny day outside and we planned to enjoy our lunch on your patio but instead had to eat it inside of the office while working. We didn't even get so much as a cookie coupon or a simple apology."
Lyndsay A.,"Livermore, CA",2,8,5,1.0,1/30/2016,"Absolutely love the food here, but every time I come the service is terribly slow. We waited about 20 min just to get our drink orders in. Wish I could give a better review."
Gabriela W.,"San Francisco, CA",23,49,1,2.0,9/13/2015,"I feel bad giving two stars but that's the service I got. Our waiter, although friendly took eons to get our food. We ordered sliders for appetizers and he didn't tell us he was giving us half the order because it was happy hour. Ok, strike one. Strike two was that the sliders came out before our drinks, before plates and silverware. Strike three was that our food took forever to come out and even longer, our wait to pay. What I never notice that I did notice was that not once were our drinks refilled (non-alcoholic) nor were we asked if we wanted anything else. Hmmm, I guess I'll just door dash this place next time."
Christine Y.,"Reno, NV",40,29,1,4.0,3/9/2016,Their lunch menu was awesome! Great food for reasonable prices. It was kind of busy with the lunch crowd but we were able to get seated right away. I ordered their half-sandwich and fries with a salad all for less than $9! The California chicken club sandwich was so tender and the bread was seasoned and toasted perfectly. I also enjoyed their shoe-string fries!
Michael H.,"San Jose, CA",78,14,,2.0,3/23/2016,"I have been to this location 3 times, and the first two were fine. The 3rd time visit however was awful. I invited a friend to join us and try the dual layer beers, which is usually a great experience. This particular Sunday evening in March, the bartender blended my ""Dark side of the moon"" beer. I asked the waitress to bring it back, since its blended. She came back and told me the bartender said its the right beer and if you order again it will be the same. Nice way to treat customers. Awful experience, they need a different bar tender! That guy is a jerk!"
T L.,"Sacramento, CA",18,239,138,1.0,12/13/2015,"Normally BJ's are fast, clean and with good service. Today, slow bar service, food before silverware, then long wait, appetizers asked about before delivery to table, blackened shrimp tacos unblackened at room temperature, bacon cheeseburger with half a slice of bacon after 20 minutes of waiting in  a half empty restaurant. Not used to this BJ's! Not coming back! Come here at your own risk"
Gino B.,"Campbell, CA",91,4,2,4.0,4/26/2015,This place was ok. But the lady who sat us was the only reason they got this high of a rating. Stephanie thanks again.  Food was Good as well. But the timing of the courses was horrible. We basically got all our food at once. I really hope the next time we visit this location they have worked out the timing issues. No one wants to eat there salad app and main course all at the same time.
Audrey R.,"Santa Clara, CA",41,1,,5.0,6/30/2015,"Word to the wise poeple!! If you don't like it don't eat here! Plain and simple! If the service sucked it's probably your problem!!  Talking on the phone, not reading the menu then you expect the server to be ready when you are? Please! Stop being spoiled brats and sit down, decide what you want to drink then decide what you want to eat and then I'm pretty sure you will have great service.! I'm sure if you do that at every restaurant you will be pleasantly surprised at how great the service is. You should all get your head out of your asses.!! Oh and No I don't work here."
Mitch M.,"San Jose, CA",7,147,47,1.0,11/16/2014,Sunday.  Football.  TWO servers on staff.  Who is staffing this place?   This place never ceases to amaze me.  They were bad because they first openee....but still bad
Maria B.,"San Jose, CA",4,3,2,1.0,7/21/2015,"Service was horrible, waited twenty minutes for our drinks and another ten to order our food. One star is too high. No plates, no silverware, no napkins; until we got up and asked for them and didn't have a refill on our waters. I know this is too much to ask on a Tuesday night with less than twenty customers in the restaurant. Ashley B needs to look into a new profession, maybe watching paint dry."
Melissa G.,"San Jose, CA",158,27,23,1.0,8/3/2015,"Unfortunately, I didn't learn from my first experience. Took my family out to dinner here and had a really unpleasant experience.    Then last night, we wanted delivery and they were one of the only places around that were open. We used a food delivery app to order. The food came cold to the touch. We ordered their new tavern style pizza. It had very little chicken and wasn't really good. My mother and brother had fettuccine Alfredo. The noodles were dry and there was hardly any sauce. The only thing that was good was the pizzooki. Really disappointed with them. Was hoping they'd be better the second time around."
Matt S.,"Roseville, CA",12,6,2,3.0,8/30/2014,Went here with a group of 12. It was not a great experience at all. I think our server needed help. Big gaps in food delivery and some things didn't come. The food that did come was good though.  We were very bothered and planned on never returning. The GM came out and apologized sincerely and made things right. We will give them a second chance.
Anne L.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,1,1.0,7/13/2016,"I admit upfront that whenever I have dined at BJ's (this location and the one in Cupertino), it's under protest. I am often with others who want to patronize the restaurant for the beer and television. I just can't stand to pay money for consistently poor and slow service, not to mention average to mediocre food. Today I was outvoted by two family members, so BJ's it was. My elderly father who is recovering from major heart surgery and who had his first foray out in public, asked the hostess if she would move us (before we actually sat down and had utensils) to a different table. The one she originally walked us to was in a high traffic area and I know he felt skittish sitting there. With her back to my father but facing me, she made an annoyed/disgusted face and begrudgingly took us to a different table nearby. I then saw her walk back to the host station where she was clearly complaining about this incident. Perhaps she overheard me say to my father that we made her angry, but seriously? During our painfully long dining experience today, I saw this hostess in action; it was abundantly clear she should quit her day job because she can't smile, can't be bothered and doesn't want to be working. The same can be said for our waiter, who I know was not only exasperating to our table, but also to other diners nearby where I could see looks and chatter of annoyance over his inattentiveness and general cluelessness. As per usual, our meals appeared at different times. We were never asked how our meal was, but at least refills happened at least once. We spoke with friends who happened to be there today and they mentioned they will likely stop eating at BJ's on their lunch breaks because the service is very slow.  I know restaurant work can be grueling and thankless. That being said, it is a hospitality industry and if you are a hiring manager, consider employing staff who are capable of behaving professionally, capable of managing multiple tables, capable of taking pride in their jobs, capable of communication and capable of producing food within a reasonable amount of time!"
Mario S.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/9/2015,"These guys need new management & new employees! Every time I've been there it has been an unpleasant  experience! I gave them multiple opportunities to provide good service! Simply put..., they have failed! The last time was the worst! I came in, I'm in a good mood, mind you, and the bartender treats me like I'm bothering her probably because I'm putting her to work instead of letting her talk to her big, tattooed friend. Ask her a couple of questions about beer & fries....., forget it. It's obvious, I'm bothering her for service!!!! It's unacceptable!!! BTW, I always tip well & I never post negative Yelp reviews!! First time...., avoid this place!! Chili's down the street is better service!!"
Jocelyn S.,"Las Vegas, NV",227,212,332,2.0,5/16/2015,"Came here after getting picked up from the airport for a late night drink and dinner.  Restaurant was still open for another 2-3 hours so we had plenty of time.  Looked like people were still waiting to get sat so we headed to the bar.  Grabbed a booth and waited for someone to come over.  Few moments went by so we asked the server for a menu when she had a second.  We started out with some drinks and ordered some flatbreads and calamari to share.  When our food came out we were never given any sharing plates so we just ate straight from the flatbread plates we were sharing.  The flatbreads were ok, I know BJs is known for their deep dish pizzas but it was a little late at night and I didn't want something so heavy.  The food and service was just ehhh... I wouldn't go out of my way to return."
Rimi K.,"San Francisco, CA",523,430,422,4.0,5/21/2014,"*~*Accomodating, friendly staff, reasonably quick service and great late night eats*~* If I have the choice between a pazooki and...anything else...I choose pazooki! Came through late at night for a midnight snack. Ordered: Avacado rolls Seared Salmon Salad (per servers rec) Chocolate Chip Pazooki Filling with plenty to take home.  The salad was big and my friend really enjoyed it.  Good quality salmon. The restaurant was quiet and although we came after the last seating, they seated us anyways as opposed to sticking us in the bar which would have been less fun.  Its in a reasonably large shopping area but closer to the street with plenty of parking in the lot. Recommend!"
