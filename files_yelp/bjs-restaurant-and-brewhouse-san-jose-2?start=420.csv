Auden W.,"San Francisco, CA",466,409,1116,2.0,10/7/2014,"Food is bland, service is below average. What more can I say?! Generally this place is not a great place to dine. Prices were above average. If you were to get something similar that tasted better, olive garden is a much better alternative. On a side note, the alcohol is decent."
Rick O.,"San Francisco, CA",3,11,1,2.0,1/2/2016,Pizza is decent but this location has terrible organization. Placed an order online (medium pizza and pizookie) and was told it'd be ready in 30 minutes. Arrived at the location and order was not ready. 15 minutes later I follow up and cashier tells me all that's missing is the ice cream for the pizookie. Another 5 minutes later I receive my order. I get home and my pizza is cold so now I have to reheat it. Thanks BJ Restaurant!
Jennifer P.,"San Jose, CA",29,210,139,3.0,10/20/2014,"It's a chain so I'm not really expecting much. They are branching out and have some other beers on tap aside from their own. This location is new and spacious. And there's usually ample seating at the bar during happy hour, except when the giants are in the playoffs. But happy hour is now throughout the restaurant when the bar is packed for games. Which is great for me when funds are scarce.  Love the fall because everything pumpkin starts to be on the menu, and BJs is no exception. They have a pretty decent pumpkin ale and I gave up my starchless diet for a pumpkin pizookie. Which was well worth it. I got a mini pizookie to not feel so guilty...not sure if it helped, but oh well. This is a good happy hour joint with ok good. If you are looking for gourmet, this is not it. But every so often a pizookie calls."
Raya B.,"San Jose, CA",24,21,3,5.0,11/13/2015,"Max is the best server, ask for him when you come here. He works hard, he tries his best, always communicates, and let's you know what's good. Thanks max for a great evening here:) we will be back cuz of you."
Felicia F.,"San Jose, CA",514,181,150,1.0,9/16/2014,"I seriously wish I could give negative stars for today's experience. Do not use their curbside!!! It's pointless because you probably will have a quicker lunch eating there. Waited 20 mins to get our food, mind you we placed the order an hour prior to picking it up. Never coming back!"
Vivian H.,"San Jose, CA",1,11,,1.0,2/8/2016,The wait here is long.  The waiter brought out 1/2 basket of chips because they ran out but he did not inform us.  It took at least 30 minutes to ask for a water refill.  Not coming back.
Stephanie L.,"Morgan Hill, CA",72,117,64,3.0,10/1/2014,"There were highs and lows. We came around 6 on a Wednesday night, and it was pretty busy because of the giants game.  Hubby and my mom got beer flights (four 5oz pours for $6.95 - great deal that lets you taste a few beers). The server was knowledgeable about the brews and helped them pick ones they would like... or so we thought. There was only one they liked out of four. He did offer to get my mom something else, which was great. Our apps were great. We got potato skins (haven't had them in years!!!) And fried artichoke hearts. Mmm, who knew fried potatoes and artichokes were good?? Our dinners, sadly, not so good. I got the seared ahi salad. The server forgot to note the huge dollops of wasabi on the side of the plate, so my first bite included a mouthful of wasabi! I was almost in tears. Other than that, the tuna was just ok, and the rest of the salad was a massive pile of weedy lettuce.  Hubby's salad was lame, too, and my mom's flatbread pizza wasnt much better."
Megan B.,"San Jose, CA",16,27,,1.0,8/19/2016,"My bf and I have ate here a few times since relocating to the area. Tonight the service was very poor. I used to waitress, so I have an understanding of the job. I also understand it's Friday night and they were busy, but it doesn't excuse the crappy service we received. When we arrived, we were told it would be about a 20 to 25 minute wait. No big deal. I would expect that on a Friday night. Our wait time was actually less. We got a table within ten minutes. We waited maybe five or ten minutes for our waitress to greet us. We both ordered an alcoholic beverage and an appetizer. When our waitress returned with our drinks, we ordered our meal. We decided to share a burger. We requested the thick cut fries and a side of thousand island. Our appetizer was brought to our table by someone other than our waitress. After it was dropped off, we realized we had no silverware or napkins. We had to flag down another waiter for silverware. Again our dinner was brought to our table by someone other than our waitress. The burger was served with thin fries which were cold. We didn't receive the side of thousand island or an extra plate. In fact, there were no condiments on our table and we weren't offered any. By the time our waitress checked on us, the appetizer and burger had already been consumed. Both of our drinks were empty. I asked her for a side of thousand. She didn't ask either of us if we wanted another drink. After, the waitress takes another table's order before bringing me my thousand island. At that point, my bf requested the check. We were both beyond frustrated and ready to leave. If you're paying $50.00 for a meal, you should receive decent service!  Oh, and our waitress was Xitlally. I would suggest she receive more training. She clearly doesn't understand the basics of being a server."
Becca V.,"San Jose, CA",311,9,1,1.0,12/2/2015,"I haven't had a bad experience at other BJ's locations, but tonight was terrible here. They forgot to ring in my drink, then brought me the completely wrong order, then told me they'd take care of my entire meal including my drinks, then charged me for two beers. Horrible service, felt unattended to...I don't normally give bad reviews, but it was a horrible experience. I will never come back to this location again."
Alice S.,"Daly City, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/23/2016,"Service suck!!!(ex..our server disappeared for long period of time, drink were not refreshed , wrong drink order numerous time, took about 1 hr before our meal was served and addition 15 minutes for the last hamburger to arrived and was not hot(there only 4 in our party)... Needless to say we won't be back.....and this was the fourth BJ we been to and they all have similar problems."
Lisa L.,"San Jose, CA",29,107,190,3.0,10/9/2014,"Appallingly, they razed a Chevys that had on been built 4 years ago to put in this BJs, but it was a great decision and I bet they never looked back.  This chain restaurant has a local vibe and serves the 408 well.  Tonight we had traditional wings (great) and bruschetta (wonder bread not as great) and beer (they have 7 taps of their own and 34 more, which is great).  We come here frequently and love that they spin tunes from the 80s and 90, They've got the clientele marketing nailed."
Whyte F.,"San Jose, CA",69,45,3,3.0,8/18/2015,"I hate to say it, I even waited more than 6 months, hoping something would change. The location has a good ambiance and the servers are friendly for the most part... We get the same one every time? But never had a bad experience with the staff. The food on the other hand, man, hit and miss! I had some sea food soup and it lacked love, straight up. Now you might question ""love"" but if that's the way it's suppose to be made they might as well take it off their menu! The shrimp look like it can from a can, charge me 6bucks and then I would agree ""you get what you pay for, the mahi mahi was real... At least it tasted like it;) I probably won't go back, I never gave any restaurant 6 months to a year to get their sh!$ together. Lots of menu items but lacks passion. 3 stars for their servers/one we only get and she was a hot mess!"
Dixie L.,"San Jose, CA",130,192,33,2.0,5/31/2014,"DARK as f*ck.  Guys, bring your date here if you don't like looking at her :P  But seriously, I hate the menus! Is it really necessary to not include the prices on the alcoholic drinks !? FUUUU I had to ask my waiter how much it was, and even then she didn't know..she went to go find out the cost, only to bring the drink with it??? UH I didn't order it yet.... and the drink was expensive as heck ! and it didn't even contain that much liquid, let alone was it made correctly.. hello, who the heck serves a blended margarita without a salt rimmed cup!? obviously this place..... There was only one lunch special that was good and actually quite inexpensive! the ""BBQ Lunch Platter""! Only if you have the patience to wait for the food though..food arrives so slowwww"
Liz J.,"San Jose, CA",125,270,835,4.0,5/3/2014,We walked in around 10am and got seated immediately. Only a few people in this squeaky clean place. Our waiter was attentive and quickly served us some coffee. Coffee wasn't bad black. We tried the baked Italian omelette light on the cheese. It was pretty good and the potatoes had a crispy exterior. It's also served with toast either whole wheat or sourdough. We tried the short stack pancakes. Not bad. Our waiter gave us refills as soon as we needed them and brought the condiments out before the food. We will be back for brunch.
Trang T.,"San Jose, CA",291,226,49,1.0,5/11/2014,"I called to make a large party reservation, was put on hold for so long that the phone line rerouted me back to the main line. The girl ended up taking down my information for their manager to call me back in which i never got a call back. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise? I was initially very hesitant about having my birthday dinner here based on the high number of bad reviews but I figured its close and convenient, i'll take my risks. I mean, if the manager doesn't have it together enough to get back to you or do what they promise then how can i expect the establishment to have it together enough to give you a easy flowing dining experience right?  Thanks but no thanks!"
Pooky C.,"San Jose, CA",0,313,216,3.0,3/15/2015,"I usually don't like sports bars, but the food we had was not bad. I had the Flatbread Breakfast Pizza which had scrambled egg, sausage, potato on it. It was yummy. Hubby said the Pork chop was decent.  Don't be scared away by the 2 and a half stars. It's still better than Applebee's."
Joseph '.,"Tigard, OR",19,42,40,4.0,10/18/2015,"We sat outside and had a great time here. Airplanes departing were a bit noisy, but wasn't a huge issue. I enjoyed a salmon dish and chocolate chip pizookie."
D L.,"Santa Clara, CA",219,35,27,1.0,9/18/2015,Don't say it's going to be 15-20 min if it's going to be over an hour and a half. Despicable.
Jim C.,"San Jose, CA",2,18,,2.0,7/7/2016,"Hi, wanted to say how disappointed I was with my BJ's experience today.  I was craving a burger so bad, not being able to eat one as I have been dieting.  So decided to have a cheat day and have a burger.  Looking at BJ's menu I decided to go for it and get the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger.  Well let's just say it was not at all what the picture showed, or I expected.  I expected Brisket, instead I got less than a teaspoon of shredded beef.  I also asked for the burger cooked medium rare, it came out well done.  Lastly I asked for Extra Crispy Wedge Fries, they came out standard and soft.  So to end this note I can say I am not sure I will be going back anytime soon, at least to this store, even though it is only a short walk from my house.  The only good thing about the experience was the staff, they were great, friendly, and accomodating."
Vivian D.,"Modesto, CA",242,103,179,5.0,8/30/2014,I loved it!  Their Mac and cheese I UHMAZING. Small apportioned but still amazing. We got seated quickly and on a Saturday night. I will be back (:
