Mike D.,"San Jose, CA",74,51,,1.0,7/13/2014,"The pazuki was a good as I remembered.  However, the service and the food - what happened???? Especially on a big event day - bring your ""A"" game, please (at least ""B"" game would have been okay.  Glad I have choices in the future - not here next time. Sorry, but there has to be something like ""I kinda care"" mentality."
Thien N.,"San Jose, CA",90,208,280,1.0,3/19/2014,"This BJ's location has the WORST SERVICE EVERRR.  And...would it hurt to turn on the light?  It's way to dark, especially in the Bar area. I'm a huge fan of BJ's (no pun intended) and LOVE the Oakridge and Cupertino locations.  However, the Coleman location has the slowest and inattentive service.  I have gone here twice within the last month, once for Happy Hour and once for dinner in the main dining room. Found a table in the Bar area for HH but it was still dirty from the previous guests.  It took 27 minutes for them to clear the table.  Then it took another 15 minutes to get our drink and food orders in.  The waitress messed up on my order, so I had to wait an extra 10 minutes for my pizza while all my friends had their food.  This was really unacceptable.  Got in around 10, didn't leave until right before closing after all the waiting. Second time, got a table in the main dining room for 6 people.  Again, 20 minutes pass by before we got our food orders in.  The food came out and we had no plates, no utensils, no condiments we requested.  We keep seeing like 5 waiters keep walking back and forth but they just drop off the food and bounce.  The place was pretty dead at that time so there was no excuse for the service to be like that. Love the food and the drinks...Not so much the service.  Go to the other locations."
Paulina V.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/13/2015,"Food was good as always service was sucky ,lack of attention to our table,rude attitude every time we asked a question by Carlos C. and super slow service even to pay took about 30mins."
Mark F.,"San Jose, CA",128,55,33,2.0,9/8/2015,"First of all, when we first came in we asked to be seated at a table and they sat us at a booth.  We asked to change seating to a table and then never provided us utensils until we asked after our appetizer arrived.  My wife ordered the balsamic chicken, which was good, and I ordered the parmesan chicken, which was below mediocre.  The chicken barely had any dressing while the rest of the chicken didn't have any flavour."
Jessica G.,"Milpitas, CA",4,28,7,1.0,9/5/2015,Food wasn't that great. Plus my husband and I got sick after eating there. We love this restraunt but this location and food wasn't good.
Roya A.,"Mountain View, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/1/2016,"Roberto is the best server ever! He had the best drink suggestions, was always around when we needed him, and very fast and friendly. The food and drinks were good too"
Christa W.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,8,,2.0,4/2/2016,"I hate to rate so low. I want to love this place. The food is great, but the service is terrible. Long wait times to get food combined with a staff that really doesn't care about their customers, leave me wanting to never return. This place is worse than going to the DMV. In fact, I think the people who work at the DMV are nicer. Servers and hostesses/hosts need to actually like people or at least be good at pretending to like people. I won't be back."
H G.,"San Jose, CA",2,221,18,4.0,5/21/2014,"Great location!! Service was nice, quick and friendly! Got a lunch salad - smaller then a normal salad and a 'cup' of soup - the cup was HUGE!! Had clam chowder and was decent :) Will be back for more lunches!"
George W.,"San Jose, CA",1,13,12,2.0,1/11/2016,"The service in the most part I found to be very slow and inefficient ,at night hard to get basic service like drinks ,one night I went in ,new years eve there were 12 people in the reatuarant and seven wait staff  and I could not get waited on,it took one and a half hours to get a cheese Berger and coke ,and the coke came for desert , the wait staff were visiting with each other in the corner and no manager on the floor, but I guess that's a large corp these days, it makes me wonder how they manage to pay the lease ."
Jenelle G.,"Oregon City, OR",291,119,68,5.0,5/17/2014,"Get a pizookie. I don't care what you're going there for, you need to get a pizookie. Any one of them tastes amazing but I do get the double chocolate one. Comes with a single square of chocolate on it and it's already melting on the pizookie by the time it gets to you. Sitting outside is lovely. The places can be loud and create an awkward silence because you have to wait for them to go over, but if you're from around that area then that is something you're probably already used to. The staff has always been friendly and everything is always great and clean. Enjoyable and perfect for groups."
Yohann J.,"San Jose, CA",9,24,5,5.0,8/2/2014,"Great bar, good food and there's always parking. Good place to watch a game.  Recommend any of the brews and the low calorie menu is a good addition."
Sarmad N.,"San Leandro, CA",468,288,145,3.0,3/16/2015,Not bad but not great either. I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We came in at 2 pm which is much after the busy lunch crowd. We were seated immediately and our waiter immediately took our appetizer order and got us our drinks quickly. The food did take some time to get to us. I ordered the Mahi Mahi which was on the lighter side menu. The fish was cooked well and the veggies were great. However i felt as if they used too much ginger. I felt like the dish was over powered by it. I also ordered cheddar broccoli soup which was okay. I have actually had better cheddar broccoli soup from togos. It was nice to sit and talk and enjoy the ambiance. However the dishes i tried were not great. Perhaps next time I will stick to more classics.
Varun S.,"Creve Coeur, Saint Louis, MO",8,25,1,1.0,4/1/2014,"This place stands up to its 2 star review average. It should more like 1 star.  Took forever to get water, plates for appetizer came before water. When the server finally came with the appetizer there was no cutlery No napkins. Server left 1 paper tissue for the two of us and kept ignoring us all the while.  Oh! And since this is an eating place: food was acceptable."
Jenno H.,"San Jose, CA",0,34,6,3.0,4/24/2015,This js the first time ive been to Bjs in quite a while. The beer was awesome!! But the food...not so much. I ordered a shrimp scampi meal and it was pretty good i must admit. But my appetizer was horrendous!! I ordered the calamari and it was soggy and just did not taste good what so ever I was so disappointed. This is the worst calamari ive had yet. But the service was good and everything else was nice which is why todays trip earned 3 stars. If it wasn't for that this review would have been 1 star!
Kyle B.,"El Cerrito, CA",147,66,600,1.0,5/4/2014,"This location was a complete fail. Slow service. Messed up our order. I understand the place may be busy because there was a game on that night, but this place needs to hire servers who actually know how to serve..  I ordered a California Burger. An original burger came out. Didn't touch it, told the server and she left for like 15mins to see what went wrong. (mind you, we were in the outside seating area). Came back and found out she wrote down the wrong order. Asked if I wanted them to make a new one.. if it was going to take them another 20mins; no thanks. So I just asked for the sides that were not in the burger. Another 15mins go by..nothing.. Finally she brings it back, claiming the cooks said the burger is exactly the same with the avocados and peppers I asked for. Clearly its not. The only thing thats similar of the two is the burger patty, which was dry as sh*t.  Thought this could be fixed with a comped pizookie... Umm NO. Wanted to speak to their manager, but we just wanted to get the eff out of there.vWe even waited 20+ mins just to get our bill rung up. Really?  I'm only giving them one star because theirs no 1/2 star option. I, personally, will NEVER come back to this location.  **the table behind us had a different server, but waited an hour before their food came out out, which eventually was wrong as well.. **"
Miss C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2,114,14,1.0,5/24/2015,This place sucks! I called in ahead of time to get put on the wait list. I get there tell the young girl in the front that I called and I'm here. She tells me it'll be another 15 mins. okay sure. Sit there for the 15 mins. Finally go up and ask what the status is and all the girls in the front say that they had called my name over the intercom several times. Sure like I didn't hear that I was sitting right there and how do they not know I've been sitting there in the first place. Then they say okay donr owrry youll be next. Im sittjng there waitinf a d they call a Wendy?! Like really? I got up there and the girl just says soorry sorry. Psssh im leaving!! Bad bad service! Never coming here again. AVOID AVOID AVOID! The girls in the front are ridiculously stupid and slow.
Lucia E.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,9,1,1.0,5/24/2016,"I guess i should have checked the reviews before going to this location. A coworker and i came here for lunch earlier today 5/24 and waiting a little bit before we were greeted. We got sat by a very friendly blonde haired male waiter and sat unattended for about 15-20 minutes before i waved down that same host and asked if we could have a waiter sent over, He quickly apologized and offered to get us some drinks and also call over a manager. We then sat for at least another 5 minutes before our waiter finally came to attend us. After we ordered, we sat there waiting for another 15 minutes completely unattended before we decided to get up and leave since we only had 0 minutes to get back to the office. We walked up to the hostess stand where there stood a hostess with bright red lips (did not get her name) and asked her if we could get our orders bagged and taken to go. She actually looked annoyed that i would ask such a thing! If i wasn't already upset this definitely would have done it. She said she would go tell our MIA waiter and also get a manager. No manager ever came. She came back to the hostess stand and we were still waiting for our food to be packaged to go. I asked her if the waiter was new. i didn't think this was such a bad question since he did seem to be a bit lost. She rolled her eyes and said ""no, he just has a lot of tables"". Then she proceeded to walk off. i recall only having seen 2 tables with 2 people sitting at each on either side of us. Both who had been sat after us. Our waiter finally came back with our food and handed us our bill. Since our entire interaction was him handing us our food and saying ""thank you"" and the  3 sentences it took to order my simple soup and salad lunch, we left no tip. the only positive thing from this lunch was that the food was very good as always. I will definitely not be returning to this location."
Jonathan B.,"San Jose, CA",9,129,,5.0,8/31/2014,"I'm pretty excited that BJ's Brewery is expanding in the valley.  It's one of my favorite places and I'm weary of waiting in the Cupertino line with that notoriously difficult parking garage.   My first experience here was with a very large group of people for a birthday party; like about 20 people.  There were several servers assigned to our table and it was a bit of a mad house.  After a while, our food arrived and we noticed that one person (out of the 20, mind you) didn't receive her salad and then she didn't receive her food.  We mentioned it to one of the servers, and they rushed her order.  After she finally got her meal, the server made it clear that they house would take care of her check.  Then the manager came by and apologized for missing her order.  Her meal was free and later on we discovered that they had also not charged us for the 2 Pazookies we ordered.   I also noticed that the manager was going around to all the tables to check in on the customers.  We were all pretty impressed. The food, beer, and atmosphere at BJ's are top notch.  In my experience, this particular location has terrific management and is very customer focused.  It was crowded when we were there, so I think that this restaurant has some serious success in its future; and just in time too because a lot of people are going to be moving into downtown San Jose in the next few years."
Cate G.,"Campbell, CA",34,206,122,1.0,5/1/2015,"Such awful service it's ridiculous. Food is the same as every other BJs restaurant chain. You will wait  !!!! For food, a check, the cheney to just leave you get so pissed off."
John L.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,2,3.0,11/8/2014,"Its a chain, so what makes it different, in short: - Beer ****selection**** - Cocktails ***nothing special*** - Food ***standard*** - Service **below expectations** - TVs - there a a good ten of them, but they don't always play the sound of the game. Some are too small to see unless your at the bar top. ***just an okay place to watch a game*** - Crowds - bar seating is small, but can find a place quicker than if you wait for a table if your patient and persistent ***standard***"
