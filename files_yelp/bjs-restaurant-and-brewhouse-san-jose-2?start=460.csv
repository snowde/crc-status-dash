Taylor R.,"San Jose, CA",61,57,17,1.0,3/9/2015,"Okay, so I have been putting this review off for a couple MONTHS in hopes that this location would give me something other than negative points to write in this review, but unfortunately that is not the case. Every time. And I mean EVERY time I come here there is something wrong. So I will start with the first experience: I came in with a group of friends and say on the patio, out server couldn't handle a large group. We ended up staying give or take THREE hours. (This was meant to be a nice quick dinner to catch up with each other) One of the biggest things I was concerned about was when our server brought me an alcoholic beverage. I am 20. I did. Not ask for the drink and let him know. He apologized and took it back. Really? Do you want to loose your alcohol license? I think not.  Frustrated and annoyed with the lack of service we tracked down our server after not seeing him for close to an hour to get our check. Long story short, I did not want to come back. Second visit: I was a little hesitant to come back, but decided to give this location another shot since this time we were a party of three I thought or server could handle it. Well, I was wrong. My friends ordered a pizza and I got the chicken tortilla soup and a salad. The pizza took 30 minutes to come out(fine) But what was not fine was it was the wrong pizza. Our server took it back and placed the order or the correct pizza. 30 minutes later, the right pizza! Yay! So waited an hour for pizza. Thumbs down. And also got the chicken tortilla soup. We finished the pizza and soup and surprise! Still no salad. I asked our server to take it off since it never came out. Our total stay was 2 hours. 2 hours for a pizza and soup. I had to get up twice to ask for water, because our services did not once come by to refill our glasses. After this time I swore never to come back. Third visit: Yesterday. Why did in come back here? I know I'm just setting myself up for a terrible experience. But, a friend was in town and wanted to come here. Noooo :c  Anyways I got a table and waited for my friend and ordered potstickers. They were good and came out in a timely matter. My friend showed up and we ordered the carnitas fries, sliders and guess what? Chicken tortilla soup!. And I made it very clear I just wanted a cup. Of. Chicken. Tortilla. Soup. That's it.  Our server dropped off the fries and walked away before I could ask for small plates. Another server brought out  the rest of our food, sliders came out fine. But she set down a bread bowl of the chicken tortilla soup.... How do you mess that up? I just want a cup of soup :( I asked her just for soup. She didn't say anything and walked away with the bread bowl. Time passed No refill on water, so I went to go find our server. Yay water! And yay for finally getting chicken tortilla soup!! We didn't see our sever after that. Someone else took over. She didn't even tell us someone else was going to take over. She was rude. And clearly ""over it""  word of advise for being in the service industry: don't get complacent. Be humble. Else your tips will reflect on your customer service. I am going to be writing a follow up review for the server who took over, who is the ONLY reason I will ever be dining in on this location."
Mac D.,"San Jose, CA",72,3,,1.0,12/20/2015,"I'm here now, got passed over for 45 minutes to be seated, ordered, soup was cold sent it back, meal arrived before soup was out, over cooked. Got soup, finally too hot to eat. This is by far worse than chili's and that place sucks ass"
Ayka And Darrell H.,"Campbell, CA",0,21,28,2.0,9/24/2015,"By far the worst customer service.  Ordered appetizers and meal.  All came out at once.  Mentioned to server and only answer was ""enjoy"".  Are you kidding me?  Then pestered us for dessert.  Once we ordered, we received our final bill within 30 seconds.  No Joke.  So so disappointed.  Will not return to this BJ's.  Sad because it is so close."
Ryan E.,"San Jose, CA",67,116,158,2.0,3/14/2014,"Service not so good, beer good.   Sat down on a Monday evening, took 10 minutes and some asking to get a server to come over, the server wasn't happy as it wasn't the table they should have had to serve, and then it took another 10 minutes to get a couple of beers.    Lucky it was just me and not my family, as I would have been more upset about the service and would have asked for a manager."
Patricia D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",28,25,10,2.0,4/29/2014,"So two girls that I work with told me about this place on two separate occasions so I had to cheek it out  Walked in the place a quite a few people where seated I got excited, then I walk to the podium where the host was and wait. Expecting a HI welcome........ but nothing she turns her back to us, Ok maybe she's overwhelmed and busy. So I asker her how long the wait is, and she seats us right way. Our server greated us right away, asked us what we want to drink ,I was hafe way expecting him to offer us something or make suggestion but he didn't. So I went with sodas and fried artichoke hearts (my favorite) the appetizer took 20 min and it came before our sodas did!  When I got up to ask the manager if we could get our drinks, or maybe order our dinner his response was ok Ok Ok Ok where are you sitting I point out our table and I sat back down. Another 15 min go by and our sodas came , now 35 mins in to our experience and we have not yet ordered dinner.   I finally got to order a angel hair pasta dish with garlic, basil,  sun dried tomatoes and olive oil I opted to added the blackened chicken, it looked good. But looks can be deceiving.  Over cooked pasta almost no  basil or garlic the chickens seasonings where inconsistent from one end to the other. Fail   My husband got a jalapeño burger it had no jalapeños and tasted primarily of cilantro.  Fail big time.   Was NOT Impressed. Don't think all be going back     Well maybe if there is nothing else to eat and I have a choice of McDonald's or this place I might go and try Bj s again"
Jess H.,"San Jose, CA",141,17,12,1.0,7/22/2014,Several issues with this restaurant.  1. My medium rare burger fell apart as it was over cooked. The appetizer ahi poke was fresh last week. The Frys tasted ok. The water Mellon Salad was good.  2. Being inundated with the Aweful Fox News Channel blaring it's absurdities at me.  3. No visit from the manager on duty. You would think with a party of 20 people spending well over five hundred dollars a visit would be necessary 4. Asked the waiter to change from Fox News and because another group preferred Fox News they went with the other group of prefer the tv be turned off at this point.  Just disappointing all around prob the reason this place was empty...
An N.,"San Jose, CA",383,243,877,2.0,2/2/2015,"My experience here so far has been a huge let down. I am still here waiting on my food. I checked in at 7:30pm and still no dinner. Yes I get we came with a big party but by the time my appetizer came, half the other side of the table has got their dinner. Now I am still waiting here for my food while now 98% of us is done. They said our food runner dropped my food, but it took him so long to even ask if I still want it. Of course I do, I didn't have my dinner yet. So, he just came and said another 8 minutes it should be done. My whole table  is done eating and their ordering desert, while I sit here and wait some more. 2 hours later, I'm still hungry and no food. No apology no anything, just blame on the food runner who dropped the food. Manager keeps walking by but his focus is on the table full of girls behind us.  I finally get my deep dish lasagna, my first bite was luke warm. Wait a minute, lasagna is supposed to be gooey, steamy and so hot you burn your tongue, but not in this case. I had to send it back, luke warm was not what I wanted. By the time the time it came back out, everyone was done and ready to pay the bill. I really want to like this place but for what it is, that was not acceptable."
Jonathan O.,"Fayetteville, NC",7,3,,1.0,9/13/2015,"The service here is extremely slow and they continuously got things wrong..I ordered a hef and was brought a blonde... No big deal the blonde is good too.. Then I ordered wedge cut fries and was brought thin cut.. Don't come here, it's not worth it."
Rufina A.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,1,1.0,6/26/2016,"After having a previous server, Paola took over our table. We were a table of four... Had already had our drinks and food ordered. We waited quite a bit for our food and during that time had multiple drinks that needed to be refilled and we didn't get checked on. When we were checked on we asked for refills and waited another good 10 minutes for those. At that time our empty glasses weren't cleared from our table but just left there.... By the end of our meals there were 11 glasses on the table. Keep in mind we didn't drink any alcohol. All empty iced teas, water and soda cups. Our food was served to us cold, not to mention she didn't even bring us our food someone else did and we even received some of our orders wrong. Our server was so inattentive she didn't notice my friend waving to get her attention. When she did make the time to stop by she left in a hurry and didn't even complete her sentences to us. I personally had to go ask my server for our check at the hostess counter and at that point she asked where we were sitting..... We had been there over an hour now and she didn't even know where we were sitting? Overall I can say we were very displeased with our service."
Stephanie D.,"Atherton, CA",576,774,301,5.0,5/14/2014,"Things weren't 100% perfect last night but so close that I'm giving 5 stars.  I came with 40+ women. Huge, loud, demanding, group. It can be overwhelming. We had several tables in the back and a couple of servers ready to take us on.  We received our water and drinks quickly and our servers were so nice.   The food took a while.. a long while.. but, being generous, I figure that trying to feed this many people different plates at different times can be a big challenge! I was starving. positively starving. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms (omg the best) and the mini bruschetta (a new one for me).  The mushrooms came quickly enough and they were awesome! My other dish seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle and our server (I wish I had remembered his name!) apologized and comped it for me, it came about 10 minutes later.  Everything tasted awesome, everyone around me was happy and the servers were kind enough to bring condiments and extra little things for everyone.  The reason that this review is 5 stars is because our servers did something absolutely magical. He allowed each of us to pay separately.  40 different credit cards. 40 different meals. OMG. This is unheard of. With only one little mistake we were all able to pay separately.  THE DREAM! If I didn't love this place before, I certainly do now."
Angela V.,"San Jose, CA",50,5,,1.0,5/12/2016,"Not worth the wait, we've been sitting here for a long time haven't even ordered our main course, even though I told our waiter we haven't ordered he walked away and didn't bother to come back, worst service ever, I rather go somewhere where they take service seriously. I'm leaving and making sure their supervised know about this."
Ms. S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,24,7,5.0,8/6/2014,"I am surprised that bjs has such a low rating for this location. I went there on a date on a Friday evening around 9:15 and there was no wait at all. The waitress was really nice and was attentive to our table. The atmosphere is cool (like all bjs) and the music was good. The food was delicious! We got sliders, ahi poki (you must try it), and calamari. I tried the blonde brew house beer which was good and a strawberry splash which is like drinking candy. Overall, I give it a 5 for now."
John J.,"Santa Cruz, CA",29,104,3,2.0,12/27/2015,"Saw the BJ's so we decided to stop in. This location was in a shopping center with tiny marked parking spots. Ridiculous for anyone with kids and four doors. Once, we got over the 18 inches to slide out of the car we were greeted by a couple of workers who were barely interested in us and more interested in chatting with each other. Franchise looked like a typical BJ's. Food was typical and cooked like what I've had at other locations. Met our basic food need and was similar to what we expected from other stores. Had an older waitress who either hated her job or just did not want to work her shift. Can't recall if she ever smiled or even tried to make a pleasant remark even after dropping off the check for her tip. It was OK...but I doubt I will go back to this site."
Christian T.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,10/20/2015,"The service and food are great at this location. Servers are very attentive and helpful. I went again last week and the manager stopped by the table to reward us with membership program points for dining. Overall, great experience and the pizookie's are always the best."
Aileene C.,"San Jose, CA",141,187,122,4.0,5/12/2014,"I love this location! Way better than the one at Oakridge Mall. No matter what the occasion, the wait is never longer than 30min. My latest visit was on Mother's Day  (cause I'm a mother) and we waited like 5 min to get seated. We ordered the Ahi Poke for appetizer, and OMG it was def the best by far! I think it's the sauce they have for it. Mm so yummy!! I usually order the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it's always delicious. I also ordered  a strawberry martini, which was yummy and a mini white choc Mac nut pazookie! Our server was really nice and cool, I think her name is Stacy.  The experience I've had here every time I went was always pleasant."
Steven M.,"San Jose, CA",57,29,47,3.0,12/27/2013,"Let's just say that if it weren't for the waiter (Shelby), I would give this place two stars rather than three. She was attentive and friendly, despite serving a somewhat drunk, rowdy party of 10. She had even given a few of us free root beers and cream sodas! This being the result of her assuming that we'd be finished with our first glass (unlimited refills for whomever ordered their handcrafted sodas). My hat is off to Shelby for being an amazing waitress. Onward to the food. One thing I dislike most is chain restaurant food. Ugh. Because this was a special occasion and the fact that I was absolutely starving, I sucked it up and forced myself to order and ingest the over-priced, average/sub-par tasting dishes. I proceeded to order the ""Grilled Burger Melt"" which came with the choice of either thin-cut crispy or wedge-cut fries; I opted for the thin-cut crispy. I asked for MEDIUM-RARE on my beef patty. I got an all brown-gray beef patty = WELL-DONE. You get a pass on that, Shelby. The burger wasn't that bad actually. I think if it had been cooked MEDIUM-RARE, I would've probably enjoyed it a lot more, but average as predicted. Same goes for the appetizers: fried calamari and lettuce wraps. All average, possibly worse. The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice, but I wouldn't suggest coming here unless it was an option for a ""last-resort for someone's birthday with a party of five or more"" kind of thing or perhaps a ""late-night get together and let's grab some brews and watch sports"" kind of thing."
R K.,"San Jose, CA",21,155,3,3.0,3/13/2014,"I was a little hesitant about going to this location since there were a lot a bad reviews on the service. On our visit (weekday, around 7pm) I found the service level to be totally fine and our server was actually quite nice and good.  They even changed the TV over to the Warriors game after we had asked. Food was typical BJ's and pretty much on par with other BJ's I've been to in the past.  Nothing spectacular, but not horrible either.  Their beers are still quite good."
Jen T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",21,125,14,2.0,6/8/2014,"Food: They dun messed up. First of all, I ordered a drink, and after telling me that they were out, they didn't take it off the check until I pointed it out. Secondly, I ordered the vegetarian pizza, but they gave me the Mediterranean instead, which has chicken on it (I'm vegetarian). So disappointing. I hate the idea of wasting food, so I picked the chicken off the pizza and tried to eat that, but it wasn't even good to begin with. I ate maybe a slice or two and gave the rest to my boyfriend. The friends who were with me also had most of their meals leftover at the end. Really not good. Perhaps the only thing that people enjoyed was their beer. Prices: Not cheap. Given the quality of the food, not reasonable. Service: There were a lot of us, so the waitress had a lot to keep track of, so I don't really blame her that she messed up. They were also willing to set up a special table for us outside, which was nice. Service wasn't spectacular, though. Overall: Had a pretty bad experience here. Maybe it was just the situation, and perhaps it won't happen again, but I won't be going back to find out."
Sara M.,"San Jose, CA",52,31,8,2.0,6/24/2015,"Nothing special. I ordered soup and salad, honestly I could have had a much tastier option at Panera which is right next-door. I ordered the Saracha honey brussels sprouts and they were a little bit too charred and not flavorful at all! The tomato soup tasted like Safeway soup and came with three salad croutons. I guess the food just lacks ""effort"". The service was pleasant."
Daniel C.,"Blossom Valley, San Jose, CA",3,6,1,1.0,7/22/2015,The service is horrible. We were seated by the hostess and we saw our waitress every twenty minutes. We needed refills and napkins so when we asked it was like we were asking for too much. She should have checked on us more often i didnt know what was going on.
