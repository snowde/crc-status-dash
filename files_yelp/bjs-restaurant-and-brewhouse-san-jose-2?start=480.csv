Mystery S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,10,,4.0,5/25/2016,"A friend and I had stopped in for a late night drink/bite to eat. The service was OK, except for the guy who brought out our food. I believe his name was Jesse. He took care of us more than our actual waiter! Get this guy a waiting job! Other than that, our experience at BJ's is the same as always...good food, good service."
Johanna L.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2015,"This location is so bad, that we joke about what will be wrong with tonight's order. So far I got a baked potato with no butter/sour cream, cheeseburger w/ no cheese, fish & chips that fell on the floor as server delivered plate to table, then left fish on the floor.  I cringe when friends suggest this place. Definitely DO NOT recommend!!!  Really ZERO stars."
Megha R.,"Milpitas, CA",0,16,1,2.0,5/5/2015,"We were out at the Coleman avenue BJ's last night for a causal dine in. It was far less crowded than the one at Cupertino. The reception at the front desk was pretty decent. We were a 4 member group and given a booth which we pretty much liked. We had specifications of no beef, bacon or mushrooms in our dishes which was catered to very well. However, while taking our orders, we felt, we were being rushed into. The lady tending to us would end up completing our sentences. ""It's a good thing to know what your customer wants but it's better if you listen to them first."" Generally our ordering food was vocalized by her throughout which we didn't appreciate. This mode was going this until we finished ordering the main course. It had been just a few minutes since we began and the lady popped in to check if wanted any dessert. We didn't want any, and lo behold, just a minute later, the cheque lands on our table and she walked off saying we could pay up whenever we were ready! This high speed of having to finish and wrap away got on to our nerves.  Pointers to the management at BJ's Coleman avenue: -Train your staff members, especially the ones who are serving, to be patient and LISTEN!! Though they may know what we are trying to get at, it's nicer if we were allowed to express it first. - Do not rush us out, after all we did come there to spend time and make merry. May be we would end up ordering a couple of more drinks if you hadn't landed the cheque on us before we even hinted that we were ready. - Having verbal courtesies but your actions not speaking for it doesn't really do any good. Personally We may not go back there by choice but we would definitely go back to the one at Cupertino. PS: I feel the strawberry Martinis are slightly over priced at BJ's"
Guy C.,"Oakland, CA",0,13,,1.0,8/16/2015,"Tortilla soap was really good, my  steak was very over cooked and tiny and my son was trying to figure out why they toast his bread bowl for his soup. Then he bit into the stale bread"
Johnny G.,"San Jose, CA",221,140,72,2.0,1/11/2014,"2 stars..benefit of the doubt that they maybe still new? otherwise a true 1 star experience This place gets packed for happy hour..pretty intense.. It was an hour wait on tables to sit inside. Luckily the night we went it was nice and not too cold outside. We were able to sit outside under the heat lamps. Really nice patio furniture they had.  On to the experience. A couple of my friends got seated before I came. One of them ordered a drink. The drink was a cocktail and was delivered with no straw..uhh ok. She asked the waitress for a straw when the waitress took our order. After she left about 10 minutes later..still no straw. It was almost like straw-gate. Where have all the straws gone? We had to waive down another person who was delivering food to another table. She gave us a straw finally, a kids straw, one that bends. We all had a good laugh about it. As usual I never had an issue with BJ's food and im a sucker for their flatbred pizza. They have changed the happy hour menu to now have $4, $5, and $6 deals instead of previous happy hour menu. One of my friends ordered calamari as an app. We all got our food. His entree came out before the calamari and we were like no worries, we can still eat it! Sadly the calamari never came. When we asked about it they said they go check on it. 15 minutes later we had to waive another person down to go check on it. When our waitress came back we decided since its been 30 minutes pass we will skip on the calamari. This BJs service is terrible. I heard other tables complaining about the service and the manager at the time looked like a deer in headlights."
Armando B.,"San Jose, CA",82,1,15,5.0,11/7/2015,Mike (the bar tender)  went thru an extensive questioner of beers and emotions. Every suggestion was matched with an exact beer which matched the emotions of the party. Even after multiple questions the bar tender provided the most serperv performance.  Will order from this bar again.
Natty C.,"San Jose, CA",150,5,1,1.0,5/19/2016,"I hate to give one star but last nights experience was horrible. I went with my boyfriend's family to celebrate his little sister's birthday but the service was the worst i have experienced by a waiter. To start off my boyfriend let our waiter know it was his sisters birthday hoping she would acknowledge her. Our food took one hour to get to us, she never stopped to let us know if the kitchen was busy or if the food was on its way, at that time the restaurant was mainly busy at the bar. When she finally brought the food I asked the waiter how long their standard time to bring out food was and with a smirk she replied usually 20 minutes, I told her we had been waiting an hour and the least she could have done was be apologetic but instead she ignored me and walked away. She forgot to bring silverware and when she brought it we told her our food was cold especially the burgers and fries, she at least offered to bring new order of fries. At that point it was pointless to even ask her to re heat the food because we would have probably waited another 20 min. She brought the check 15 min later and never even came by to sing happy birthday or apologize after hearing us sing to birthday girl. I regret not getting her name to mention her."
Shannon C.,"Carlsbad, CA",252,472,762,4.0,1/4/2014,"HIGHLIGHT: Beer selection I've dined at plenty of other BJ's locations, so I'm familiar with their fairly extensive menu. I always enjoy a pint of their Nutty Brunette and a pizookie if there's room in my belly! This time we ordered their mini pizookie trio (peanut butter, chocolate chunk, and red velvet). The chocolate chunk is the best, in my opinion, and going forward I will not order any other flavors. Unless of course we get the giant cookie that feeds a small village!  Other meals enjoyed at our last trip: their ribs were excellent, the black n blue flat bread pizza was okay, the buffalo chicken tenders were really good, and my brother liked their Snake Bite (guiness and apple cider).  The location is new and our server Tim was really new, but he was super friendly and tried really hard to make sure we were happy. I can't say anything bad about his service because he was running multiple tables, so I know he was busy. As long as he keeps up his can-do attitude, in a couple months he'll be the perfect server! We dined on a Friday night around 8pm and there was still an hour wait! Instead, we opted to sit outside (read: cold). Luckily I was able to sit directly under one of their heat lamps because San Diego has thinned my skin. The rest of my family was fine not being directly under the lamp, and we enjoyed eating outside. There was more room all around."
Malia W.,"Tacoma, WA",118,343,362,2.0,12/7/2013,"After reading the horrible reviews about service I just had to see for myself. I almost didn't believe what people were talking about. Usually BJ's is pretty legit. Oh geez where do I start!  Well we walk in for a weekday lunch. We were ""seated"" ""immediately"". I say ""immediately"" because yes we didn't have to wait but we did have to walk through a jungle of bags and chairs. The row was too small while on the other side of the island table there was ample room. The employees I guess didn't measure the aisles before seating a group of 20+ people. Thought it was some what of a fire hazard. Anyways, I say ""seated"" because the hostess knew we were a party of 2 yet when we got to our table it was occupied by a group. She looked at us confused then asked if we were in that group. We said no and I suggested to her that there's an open booth behind us, can we just sit there? She said, ""Sure I think"" and sat us down.  After that weird interaction we meet our waitress and she was great. I had no complaints about her. I ordered the strawberry patch mixed drink. It had fresh cut strawberries with grey goose and other stuff. A truly girly drink. But oh so good. I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, yet felt good after drinking it. No complaints about the bartenders. While waiting for our food a waiter dropped and broke a few plates in front of us. Had nothing to do with us, just had to add that in. We ordered the calamari for our app. My husband asked me, ""How do you like the lukewarm calamari?"" Which pretty much sums up how we felt about our appetizer. Some of it was kind of warm and some were actually cold. Then came our small deep dish Mediterranean pizza. The guy who brought it out asked if we'd like anything else. So we ordered some ranch dressing. After waiting 15 minutes for the ranch to come out and seeing the guy walk past us 3 times since, I figured that was a no on the ranch. So I started to eat the pizza then. It tasted great, no complaints.  So to sum it up, service is the big issue! I think I'll wait some time until I visit again. Maybe they need some more time to get there stuff together. How long have they been open??"
Mehari A.,"San Jose, CA",2,12,3,5.0,4/23/2015,"Best restaurant by far. I have had two of my birthdays at this place and they have never let me down. You do not wait for too long to get a table and their food and customer service is superb. I have yet to find a restaurant that would beat this. Last but not least, no parking scarcity problem."
Andréa C.,"San Jose, CA",193,26,5,2.0,1/23/2014,PROS: -Food is usually decent. -Open late. -Nice ambiance. -Offers its own micro brews. CONS: -Service is exceptionally slow from beginning to end. -Food has been botched on a handful of occasions. Comped only once. -Wait staff is apathetic.
Parth S.,"Roseville, CA",1,2,,1.0,4/22/2016,"Wow, where to begin. We put our name down for a reservation on a Friday night and was told it would be 40-50 minutes. After 40 minutes, they called us saying we're ready to be seated. When we went to get seated, our reservation somehow disappeared and we were forced to put our name down again for another table. That's strike 1. When we were served appetizers we weren't given any plates, utensils, or napkins. Strike 2. We repeatedly asked for refills on water and they ""forgot"" multiple times. Strike 3. When we finally got our pizza it was cold as if it had been sitting on the counter for an hour. Strike 4. This is the worst service I've ever had and I'm not coming back. Based on the other reviews I'd recommend the same for everyone else."
Tom L.,"San Jose, CA",150,22,1,1.0,10/9/2013,"very disappointing experience, this location is not off to a good start. Lousy management, I highly recommend just driving to Oakridge (or Fremont if you live north).  I called in to check the wait ""how long is the wait for 2?"" ""it's 20 minutes"" I was then ASKED ""would you like me to put you on the list?"" ""yes, we'll be there shortly""  We arrived  about 20 minutes later (wed night, no A's, no Sharks). The person ahead of us had walked in and been quoted a 20 minute wait for walk ins. We reached the host and we're also told 20 minutes (Seems like a pretty common quote of time at this point). I let the host know we called in and were put on the ""call in list."" She seemed very confused and immediately got her manager.  The manager then explained again the wait was 20 minutes. I let her know we called in, she then began to explain some odd process of the time they quote over the phone is really half the time of the actual wait in the restaurant.............. I tried to simplify the conversation ""what was the advantage of me calling ahead and being put on a call list if the walk in ahead of me is quoted the exact same amount of time I'm being quoted right now?"" She then re-explained the process of quoting half wait times over the phone. Anyhow, I think she completely missed the point I was making (or refused to acknowledge it). There was ZERO benefit of me calling ahead and being put on a ""list."" ""we're still a new location, they're learning, it's dinner time"" She then told me to wait ""25-30 minutes""  seriously??? incredible. Not dinner time for me apparently! Guess I better deal with this learning curve they're having :) This was actually my second visit. The first I was turned away entirely because they weren't officially open and I was told you needed a special reservation in advance. (no i didn't call ahead, maybe thats why I did this time!!) In any case, no I didn't expect to walk in and be seated immediately, it's BJs, always busy. I've been to oakridge, been to fremont. I go quite often actually,. but to quote me the exact same or MORE time and to take zero action to make it right? Even make excuses implying that I misunderstood? Incredibly lousy service best part was the manager seemed surprised we weren't going to wait based on the experience. would you??? We chose to have dinner elsewhere."
Sunny S.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,3.0,11/15/2015,"I mostly love BJs in Cupertino but this one has some issues with the servers. One time, I ordered a drink and they got the wrong one thinking I would not know the right drink. I had to literally tell the manager by showing on google on how they made me the wrong drink and were still trying to fool me. Another time, I ordered a drink and got the wrong one and when I asked the server to fix it, he gave a very sarcastic answer - ""Of course Sir, I can change the drink"" with a smirk on his face. Then he sent another server to serve the drink. I do not like their attitude at this location. While in general BJs is great but this one requires their servers to be a little more polite. And this place is pretty loud."
Alicia S.,"San Jose, CA",110,12,43,1.0,3/11/2015,"I've always been a fan of BJ's the restaurant so I was happy that they opened this location because it's much closer to my house than the Oakridge location. Low and Behold- They're terrible.   The first few times I went the food was eh but I didn't really mind because I went right when the location opened so I figured they were still working the kinks out, no big deal. I hadn't gone for a while and I moved really close by so I've gone a lot more lately.  The last 3 or 4 times I had always sat in the cocktail area.  Mostly figured for the happy hour and never really thought twice about it because I had a good experience.  This last time I went I sat in the dining room because it was Saturday and there was no happy hour. Huge mistake. I got there around 11:15 so still about 45 minutes until they close. Our server, Michael Y, didn't greet us for about 10 minutes. And when he finally came we ordered drinks and the three of us also asked for waters. He came back and only brought two waters.. okay thanks? Whatever. Then he came another 10 minutes later and took our order.  I asked him to take off the mayonnaise on my order and change the side from salad to french fries. Not that hard right? My boyfriends entree has a choice of rice and he chose brown rice with his chicken.  When he brought our food my boyfriends chicken has the rice pilaf, my turkey burger had nothing but lettuce (when its supposed to have other toppings) the burger bun was black from being burnt and he brought me the salad instead of fries.  He completely ignored everything we had asked. He didn't want anything to do with us. He would walk away when I would ask him for something and he just didn't do any of the modifications we asked. When he could tell I was dissatisfied with my entree he asked if I still wanted it, at this point I was over it so I just gave it back to him.  And the manger did come by and talk to me so I can appreciate that.  And he said he was going to take my entree off the bill, but he said it like he was doing me a favor... I didn't even eat it. I'm not going to pay for it. Either way, the whole thing was a waste of my time and super disappointing. Terrible service and my entree looked disgusting.  I hesitated giving one star because in the cocktail area I've had two servers specifically that I really like. But this experience was terrible and makes me not want to support this location. Note to everyone: Just sit in the cocktail area if you must go to this location."
Aaron R.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,8,2.0,6/2/2016,Jessilyn seemed to be late to the table- then waited agin for water and 25 minutes for any food after ordered.
Keoni G.,"San Francisco, CA",151,121,1,2.0,3/18/2014,"Service was horrible. First time I went for lunch. Took over an hour to get my food. Second time I went last night. Got there at 8:15pm. Server was super nice but not his fault of how long the food takes. Took a half hour to get our drinks from the bar (8:45pm) Appetizer came out at 9:00 ish and they forgot to give us silverware. Food came out 9:15 with silverware. Ordered chicken pasta, cooks forgot to put chicken on the order so waited another 20 mins.  We finished dinner at 10:30 because we waited a while for the check. The actually server was the only good thing. Super nice and apologetic. Not sure if I'd go back."
Ethan H.,"San Jose, CA",27,3,2,4.0,1/29/2015,"Good food. Good beer. Great for post-season games. The prices are a bit high but if you can swing it, I recommend highly. The workers try. Bobby at the bar is top notch!"
Brian L.,"San Jose, CA",59,76,,4.0,4/1/2015,What a difference a year makes. This time when I went back recently I had a great experience. Friendly host staff to the friendly servers and of course great food. Well done BJ's. I hope this a trend that continues.
Cat F.,"Milpitas, CA",283,45,40,3.0,5/9/2014,"Food items here aren't amazing... However the service is really good!  Came here recently for happy hour, and the menu selection was not very large. Wished they could have a larger happy hour food selection. Drinks are alright, nothing special. But, this place does become quite packed around 6 PM so make sure to come early!"
