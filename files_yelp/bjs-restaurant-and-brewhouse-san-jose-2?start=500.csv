Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,3.0,10/16/2013,"I was thinking this was going to be perfect for Sunday football with some friends. Turns out, though this is nice and new, they dont nearly have the TV coverage as the Cupertino one. That one has the giant mega tv wall where you can watch all 8 series of the NBA and NHL first round playoff games at the same time. Here, there's a handful of tv's scattered throughout and someone kept changing the channels. ugh. service is friendly and helpful. THe roast beef horseradish au jus sando was not as good as I remembered though prob cause it was a bit lukewarm. Friend like the gluten free pizza, and the black cherry and cream soda on tap are solid. 3.5 stars"
Kristin Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,29,77,5.0,4/30/2014,"Ordered the italian styled Margherita pizza for appetizer, grilled chicken and asparagus for entree, the endless strawberry lemonade for drinks, and the beignet with ice cream for dessert. All was delicious especially if you like thin crunchy crust pizza which I absolutely LOVE :). Beignets are my most favorite dessert and surprisingly, in my opinion, BJ's has the BEST BEIGNETS in the South Bay! I highly recommend the beignets here, I truly do."
James K.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,,2.0,8/18/2015,"We typically get decent service, but the host/hostess staff is so awful - literally every time we come here, we have some problem, whether incompetence, rudeness, or general carelessness - it's probably not worth your time or trouble to suffer through it. The food is decent at best. The beer is pretty good, but not worth the headache."
Freeda L.,"San Jose, CA",11,13,1,1.0,9/30/2015,"It's the little things that make a big difference.  I have been to this location a number of times and am always left feeling like it was a bad experience.  The Oakridge location is much better, and because we go there all the time, I usually expect this place to be as good but the food and service never measures up.  Today I waited for over ten minutes to get ketchup for my hamburger, and by the time I got it, the hamburger was cold, soggy and soaked with grease and gross."
Mike S.,"Santa Clara, CA",56,20,7,1.0,3/14/2016,"Wow, just wow. Based upon our experience at BJ's, it seems that they are trying to go out of business. Start with waiting for 30 minutes while staring at empty tables. If I have to wait 30 min because the restaurant is jammed ok, but with multiple empties no no no. Perhaps someone called in sick so maybe not such a big deal. So upon getting seated our waiter promised to ""take care"" of us. He ignored us. our food was brought by other servers and cold no less. I ordered the prime rib and it was everything but prime. As my side I got vegetables. They advertise fresh never frozen food, and the food was clearly frozen. The sub-prime rib (which I ordered med rare and came med well) was dry and inedible. The veggies were more like veggie crumbs, Wife's burger was not any better. Had to wait an eternity to get a refill of water, and had it not been for a neighboring table asking for water, we would not have gotten it. We had no utensils or napkins to start, and that neighboring table had to borrow our ketchup, I only finished the veggies due to the fact that I haven't eaten all day. I decided to try to drown my steak in A1 to try to make it somewhat edible to no avail. So $35 is normally a decent price for a dinner for two, in this case it was a total rip-off and an epic fail. I should have worn my GoPro so I could submit the footage to FailArmy."
Alex B.,"Elk Grove, CA",17,92,159,1.0,3/10/2015,"Slow, plain and simple. If you have a two hour lunch break then please by all means stop in. I was with four other of coworkers and from the time we were seated to our food hitting the table it was 45 minutes. My food took an other five minutes because per the waitress fish takes longer to cook. I guess it could be a good reason however two other people at the table ordered salmon. With so much other options in San Jose and even in close to this location you are better eating elsewhere."
Kyle Y.,"San Jose, CA",81,203,296,2.0,3/7/2014,"Worst service I've experienced in quite some time. She said she was new, in which I can cut her some slack but don't be shelling out excuses for your mishaps. Forgetting drink orders and disappearing for extended periods of time.  No excuses, rookie!!! The food was subpar: the pizza didn't taste up to the standard from previous trips to this establishment. The potato skins were the size of my pinky finger. Chili's serves a legitimate size potato skin. I suggest you take notes.  I'm hesitant to go here during my lunch break because I'll be waiting for my food all day. So far the worst Bjs restaurant I've been to"
Paula V.,"San Francisco, CA",454,74,77,1.0,1/14/2014,"Read my friend Kim D.'s review for more info about how disorganized the workers were in accommodating for our friend's party of 17. I am giving a one star because of the service and food.  First of all, I can tell when a waitress is displeased when she clearly rolls her eyes while she is taking orders. Waiting impatiently does not make me or time go any faster. The one star is for her separating all of our checks. But in doing so she also got peoples' drinks messed up, overcharged and undercharged others and paid off people with cash instead of taking the hit for it and redoing the charges.  The food was terrible. I got the French dipped roast beef and the Au Jus was way too salty. It was not meat juices (as it should be) but pure sodium heart attack. I had to use HORSERADISH to mellow out the sodium. And had it not been for those thin fries I would have gone hungry.  Only pluses were that the waiters and waitresses were good at refilling drinks (soda) BUT not water. And they split the check for our large party instead of charging an 18% gratuity.  All I can say is never coming back here again."
Alexa R.,"San Jose, CA",12,7,,2.0,10/24/2013,"My experience here was terrible! A group of six friends including myself decided to come to this restaurant on a Monday night, because we thought we would be seated right away. WRONG! We had to put our names down and wait for a table to become available when......the whole restaurant was practically available!!! What is that?! The problem was that they couldn't find a waiter to wait on our table when.....THERE WAS A TON OF STAFF WORKING! We ended up waiting 20 minutes to be seated, three parties went ahead of us and when we finally got our table, we passed by a group of staff telling each other ""Ha ha they get the 'sh*tty' table."" Um, talk about unprofessional!  We should have left from the get-go but we didn't feel like eating at the Wingstop nearby and since we invested in all that time into getting seated, we thought might as well stay at the restaurant. The food was mediocre and our waiter was just okay. Definitely telling my friends to just stick to the BJ's by Oakridge or Cupertino. I'll only come back if I'm seating myself at the bar -- wouldn't want the hostesses to fight over what waiter should cover what table."
David N.,"San Jose, CA",311,75,98,3.0,12/28/2013,"Had to plan a last minute get together for my friend's birthday. Simply wanted some drinks and appetizers over some nice conversations without too many disruptions. Theres always chile's ... apple bee's ... TGIF... etc. but if you want to do something fairly nicer for a friend you either take em to yardhouse or BJs. We settled with BJs regardless of the horrible ratings it earned thus far. BJs being a chain ... it just doesn't make sense for the newer location to be worse .. If anything, it should be at least as good as or better than its predecessors. The reviews I have been reading are mad horrible though.  We ended up having a party of about 10-12. Took about a 30 minute wait because i did not make any reservations (I didn't think it was necessary based on the reviews). Ordered some drinks right when we got seated. Snake Bites, Buffalo Bites, their in house brews, etc... It was all good. Got our appetizers which was mainly calamari, sliders, and avocado eggrolls. Everything was as expected based off my experiences at other BJs. Nothing new. The pizookie's are always great. I thank god they did not ruin the pizookie.. Our waiter was very patient and considerate. Above everything else, the birthday boy had a good time and that was all i could ask for. This particular BJs got the job done."
LeDodo A.,"San Jose, CA",91,85,19,5.0,5/27/2014,Been dining and drinking at the bar here for over a year now Never had problems with wait-time. Desiree' waited on our table the other day and she was very  sweet and polite.
Alejandro C.,"San Jose, CA",4,2,,5.0,6/28/2015,"Very good experience compared to my past experiences here. This place is always good but not great. Our server, Esteban was excellent. Checked up on us every time someone dropped a drink or plate to ensure it was good. Small mix up with our dessert and he replaced it and took it off our check. Not necessarily looking for free food but he insisted. Good guy, great service! We will be back :)"
Michelle V.,"West San Jose, San Jose, CA",115,5,1,2.0,10/27/2013,"BJ's, I love you and I hate you. I think I just hate that I love you.  What can you honestly expect from the epitome of American dining?  This is another installment in BJ's growing empire and it offers nothing new that you can't find at any other location. Ambiance-Dimly lit, almost too intimate for a chain restaurant serving pizza and a kids menu.  Food-Consistent at best. You can't expect to taste anything exceptional here other than the already amazing pizookie.  Service-Spotty. They try at times. It blows my mind that people will walk into an establishment like this and expect over the top service. This isn't Gary Danko, they focus on volume.  Overall, if you want to indulge in food overloaded with calories and addicting qualities then by all means drive down to the new BJ's. Heck why not make it a family affair and bring your newly born and grandparents, servers will love you."
Selina F.,"San Jose, CA",61,50,6,4.0,10/14/2013,Not bad but not quite worth the prices.  I went with my family recently and since it was only around 1pm the wait wasn't very long. Our waitress was really nice and our order was perfect.  I enjoyed the chicken sandwich I ordered with fries (you get a choice of thin cut or wedge fries). The only problem was the chicken was basically 3 strips inside a bun with tomatoes and sauce. Still tasted good but not really worth $10.
Neil L.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,9/20/2015,"Bryant C at BJ's is a fantastic server!!  He was entertaining, engaging, and humorous while at the same time very attentive making sure we had everything we need and everything was alright. Bryant totally made another good meal at BJ's a very fun and pleasurable lunch experience. Thank you Bryant!! Neil Love"
Andrea G.,"San Jose, CA",3,26,6,1.0,8/6/2015,"It's unfortunate that this location has such poor service, because the food is decently good and the beer is cold.  I've come to eat lunch here twice during the weekday.  My partner has come probably five times to the point that he has seen the same bartender every time.  I don't want to blame the bartender- as she looks generally unhappy at her job.  It is often difficult to get her attention for either a beer, a napkin a sauce and or the check.  She doesn't check in enough with her customers to see how they are doing which is partly the problem.  And despite being there all the time doesn't know the menu and is often not very thorough.  And at lunch there are few customers.  On several occasions when our glass was given to us either by the bartender or other servers they were carrying the glass by the lip- where eventually I will drink from the glass.  This is just poor form, u don't hold the glass from here because it's unsanitary.  It has been a buildup of several small things here at this location that ultimately amount to poor service and poor management. My partner asked to see the manager on our way out.  A woman appeared named Joanne, after about 5-7 minutes waiting for her, she was the manager.  Myself nor my partner have ever seen her here, as she is not walking around the floor, though she claimed she had seen us.  When my partner let her know he was unhappy with the service as I mentioned above including the last straw when the server had his thumb in his salad due to carrying it wrong, she responded, ""well I've seen you here for the last hour and your cup has been full the whole time,"" among other statements, none of which were ""I am sorry.""  She not only implied that he was likely drunk she also implied that his account of how service was being delivered was false.  This manager needs to be better at customer service, actually manage and train her staff better, and listen to feedback.  Rather than acknowledge my partners feedback she defensively tried to turn the tables.  I'll admit he was unhappy but she definitely did not handle the situation as a manager should.  I think the overall yelp 2.5 stars speaks to this, we are not alone in our dissatisfaction.  We will not be returning to this location and we hope the manager reads this and improves her site."
Jane L.,"San Jose, CA",1,18,3,2.0,2/10/2014,"I had high expectations for this place because I heard good things about the Pizookie. And it's actually delicious. So +1 star. -1 star because of how long it took for them to notice we were long done on deciding our order. 15 min done actually. And then the following 15 min of not receiving our drinks. -1 because of how we already got 2 entrees before our appetizer even came, which by the way took 45 min. And it never arrived because they forgot to make it. We were also asked ""Do you still want the stuffed mushrooms?"" Well if we asked about them wouldnt we want them? Not wanting to wait another 45 min for it to get to is we decided to not have it anymore. And yet, when we asked for the check, it still appeared on it.  -1 because I ordered a pizookie, and after 30 min our server asked if we got our dessert. How is it that she wouldn't know if she is the only person serving us? And by only person I really mean it. All other servers refused to make eye contact while we were trying to flag them down. +1 Because one of the managers did come to apologize that the appetizer still showed up on the bill, and offered to give us a free desert, which was nice and redeeming. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't something to brag about either. I'm willing to try a different location, as I feel like the only thing that truly dampened our dinner was the service."
Christie A.,"San Jose, CA",4,11,,5.0,6/22/2015,Honestly the best service I've had here in a while. I normally ask for Denea but tonight we had Davina. She was awesome! Our dance group usually comes here on Monday nights and luckily we were seated in her area. Our dance group is usually very needy and tonight Davina was totally on it. She never once left us with empty glasses and was super attentive. I am very happy with her service and highly recommend getting seated with her. She is GREAT!
Habitual Line S.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,2,1.0,6/18/2015,"I called from the airport after a long flight for a take out order.  The take out group did not pickup the phone until 9 or 10 rings and placed me on a 15 minute hold, which I hung up on.  I placed an online order since Bj's employees wouldn't pick up the phone. My order for two basic items for curbside pickup at 11pm on a Thursday was 25 minutes late. I now get why this location has 2 stars.  I do not understand how Bj's in Cupertino can be so different than the Coleman location. I've had three bad encounters at this location and will never visit again.  I spoke to the manager who seems some what apathetic to the issue, which only made my view of this franchise location worse. Don't waste your time here, go to Bj's in Cupertino or the far superior SP2 down the street.  I have removed this location from my corporate lunch group and will be adding another restaurant to our list on Monday."
Eat F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,9,3,4.0,10/11/2013,"Went to Bj's with a group of 6 for lunch.   Three of the orders were messed up.  The entire meal time was over 2 and a half hours.  Many of my co workers said they will not be back.... However,  I thought my meal was awesome.  I loved the server she was awesome, and it couldn't have been all her fault.  I tried the October fest beer and it was amazing.  My burger jalapeno something was the best thing ever!  I even had specific request for it, and everything was done how I asked.   So, I will be back.  I give it 4 stars.  Just won't be taking a client, or a large group there again."
