Bang A.,"Santa Clara, CA",213,53,12,1.0,11/9/2014,"WORST SERVICE EVER!  Our server disappeared part of the way through our meal.  NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.  When he finally shows up, he apologizes and says that his friend was on the phone with him outside because he was having problems with his car.  Thanks for apologizing and owning up to it, but dude, we waited for 30 minutes for you to take our order.  AND THEN we got no refills on water and drinks.  Our food came out cold by another server.  I'm guessing the other server saw our food just sitting there forever and realized our server wasn't going to bring us our food.  At least we got our food?  His verbal apology was not worth the long wait!  Especially because it was late and we just wanted to have a quick easy dinner."
Amanda H.,"Santa Clara, CA",16,11,4,5.0,3/6/2015,"My husband and I are huge fans of this restaurant, this was our first time at this location and we were not disappointed. We were promptly greeted and seated. Our waitress Kathy was great and provided excellent service. The food was yummy and the atmosphere was nice. We will absolutely be returning."
Scotty G.,"San Jose, CA",171,11,11,2.0,10/23/2015,"I haven't posted in a long time, but for me to post something , it's a big deal. I got off work from a long shift and I wanted to order from door dash and give it a try, ordered my food wrote down my specific instructions and went from there. The only good thing about last night was the fact that my DoorDash driver was extremely nice, and showed up on time. The bad news however is that my order was wrong. I ordered the chipotle burger, no produce and  cooked medium... The Burger came with the produce on it, and I have never seen a burger so bloody in my life. It was so rare there was a little puddle of blood in the Togo box and my fries that were suppose to be extra crispy went soggy from the blood. I couldn't eat it, and it was too late to call So I threw it away... The wings We ordered was just  mediocre. This morning... I haven't been feeling good as well...With that said just want to say that the server should have checked the order,  cooks should've checked the burger before giving it to door dash! Two stars to you, but great service from door dash! If any servers from this location would happen to read this ( I know you will because  my work does as well) you guys are probably rolling your eyes are laughing, but you guys should've handled the food correctly and checked my order. I work with with the hospitality and food service so I should know."
ryan h.,"San Jose, CA",7,50,,4.0,5/12/2014,"I don't get why this place got so many negative reviews- we've had nothing but good experiences here.  We always sit at the bar because we adore Erin, the bartender.  She's super attentive and friendly, and has her own cult following, it seems :)  We've sat next to several regulars who've said they specifically come when she's working.  She always remembers what we drink- I'm a big fan of their beer selection, especially their Pirhana Ale. We generally order off the appetizer menu- pretty straight forward American fare.  The wings and the sliders are great.  We've also had the French dip and burgers- both very good. A lot of times, this place is a madhouse, especially on game days.  I can see why many people complain about the service.  That's why we always sit at the bar- closer to the beer! I gave this location and Erin a great review on their site, and got a personalized email from the General Manager, which I thought was a nice touch.   They've got a great happy hour menu.  Give this place a shot!"
Kay D.,"San Jose, CA",0,28,,1.0,4/18/2016,"This is my one and done visit. I will never come back here again. I always passed by this place and wanted to eat here. The service was bad from the moment I walked in from the server who brought us to the table. The actual waitress was extremely slow and didn't have an improved attitude from the first person who sat us. On top of that, they didn't explain the beer very well. I wanted to try the house brew but the waitress confused me. I asked for a refill on our regular drinks and it took about 20 minutes. I looked over my shoulder and the waitress was taking another order from a different table. I wanted to like this place, but I should have checked Yelp first before trying it out. There's a reason why this place has a two star rating."
Rox R.,"San Jose, CA",83,319,32,4.0,10/3/2013,"If I could give this place a 41/2 stars, I would. The service was great! I couldn't  make the soft opening but I can tell, they put a great effort to train their staff well. The gentleman who first served us was great. He was followed by another young lady and she was fine. You can tell they were getting ready for a big lunch crowd. I feel bad for chili's! The person who brought our pizza to the lady who collected our check were all very friendly. My husband thought the bathroom was beautiful and very clean. Yes, it's a new place with a new car feeling. So, the food.. We came for the party for 2. Wedge salad was good. Pizza is great. Soft dough with a lovely hint of garlic. Ham was excellent. What wasn't excellent was the lack of tomato sauce? Little tomato drops is not the deep dish of Chicago? But still good. Pizzuki...ghiradelli chocolate chunk was amazing. My husband had to keep up with me otherwise it would have been gone in a flashbite. Getting the change back from the bill took a little long considering we had to get going for work and a tired baby. Root beer. Yum! Vanilla cream soda? Delish..had a Carmel/vanilla flavor. We will have beer next time. Yep, can't wait to go back with my premiere card. And I would go to watch a sports game..bummer you can't hear the game, but that's pretty typical in this area."
Chris E.,"Oakland, CA",1,24,,2.0,6/9/2014,"Our server, Cassandra, was great.  My boyfriend was worried his drink would be too strong, so she brought it half strength with the rest of the alcohol on the side so he could mix it as he liked it.  She knew the menu, was helpful, and just all-around pleasant.   However, I expect that this kind of place should be able to make a decent steak.  I'm not expecting something high end, but the first one was well past well done.  It was ordered medium well.  The second one was a bit on the rare side of medium rare.  The cook apparently didn't believe us, despite the juices running red.  It was only when he was shown the inside that was nearly still raw that he accepted that it wasn't right. We were still charged for the steak."
Anissa M.,"San Jose, CA",107,5,3,1.0,6/5/2015,"Waitress was nice when we first got seated, but after that she completely forgot about us. I understand it was a packed night but the only interaction we had was ordering our food and paying our bill. We didn't even get a water refill."
Evan T.,"Saratoga, CA",0,3,1,1.0,7/17/2015,"First of all, I wish there was a negative star. The day started well when I went with my family to the BJ brewery. We were asked to wait and that's understandable but once we were seated I was overcome with the lack of care for customers. We started by getting our drinks... Which took 20 minutes and ended up ordering. A 20-30 minute wait for the food is understandable but a hour wait just for a refill is complete s!$&! Overall this experience was revolting and appalling and I would hate to come back to this heinous restaurant ever again. -24/0 stars"
Klara G.,"San Jose, CA",3,11,,2.0,10/14/2013,"Really unprepared staff... I almost felt bad for our server who stated he didn't know what a Black and Tan was (it's even on the menu) and then after 5 min of waiting for our drinks, he says that he wasn't sure where the Black and Tan button was on their POS... Seriously? Why don't you ask someone, like your manager? Anyways,  he finally let us know he found it only to come back 10 min later (I had to ask a random server for at least a glass of water at this point) saying the root beer keg had to be changed and there were only a couple people who knew how to change one.. At a brewery?!?!?!  Seriously, 20 minutes in, my hubs gets his drink and we get our appetizer and the main courses all arrive at the same time... So much for the timing! I still don't have a root beer... By the time I'm done with my main meal, he brings it out in a hot, fresh out of the dishwasher, mug... Well if it's gonna arrive at the end of my meal, at least make it cold!  Anyways, the food was decent so that part was ok but the lack of knowledge and management really took it's toll on us. It's one thing to see our server running around with his head in the clouds but it's another to watch the manager flirt with the hostesses all night instead of doing his job. Obvious room for improvement and we won't return to this location for awhile."
Alex K.,"San Jose, CA",643,334,79,1.0,11/18/2013,The service was terrible. My cheese crusted chicken covered in cheese was delicious. Steak was bootsy. So this is how it feels to get raped by BJs.
Cold D.,"San Jose, CA",0,64,,4.0,12/3/2013,"I did not read the Yelp reviews before deciding to dine here. The GF and I arrived around 5:30 on a Monday afternoon. The placed was packed and we almost walked out because of the noise, it is rather loud here, but not as loud as other places I've been. We decided we could handle the noise so we stayed. We were seated quickly and our sever came right over. We ordered the soup and salad with a calamari appetizer. The calamari arrived within five minutes and was VERY good, nice and crispy, with a great flavor. The wedge salad was typical and also very good. The GF had the chicken tortilla soup and she said it was delicious. I had the chili and I must say, it was the best restaurant chili I've ever eaten. I also ordered an Imperial Stout from the beer menu and it was excellent! The service was great, and the food was great. We really enjoyed ourselves. Why not five stars? Well,  I took a half-star for the noise level, it is just under the unbearable range for me. Another half-star was deducted because of children in the vicinity. I don't like to see kids in any type of bar and grill. It is not their place in my opinion. Otherwise, I will definitely return. I read the Yelp reviews before I posted this review and was surprised by the number of one and two star reviews. I can totally understand them for the place is rather large, and very busy during the dinner rush. My server's name was Luis and he was great. Ask for him if he is there when you visit."
Enrique M.,"San Jose, CA",74,45,31,4.0,4/28/2014,"After reading all these low rating reviews, I was a little skeptical  about coming here.  However, I'll give BJ's the benefit of the doubt and hope that my experience here would not be as bad.    I came here for a birthday celebration with a group of 5 people.   We had no trouble getting a table.  I really don't understand all these people who are hating on the service, the service was perfectly fine to me.  Actually a little better than most places.  Our server was always checking up on us, made sure we always had water, she even joked with us.  For BJ's I'll admit, the food is always consistent.  We got two pizza's to share, calamari, and stuffed mushrooms and they were spot on. The place was dimly lit kinda set a relaxed mood. Overall great place, not as good as my main BJ's on De Anza Blvd, but none the less a solid place to go to.  I'll most likely come back."
Nicole L.,"Albuquerque, NM",182,48,184,4.0,3/2/2014,15mins wait for a party of 3 on a busy Sunday dinner rush. The server was excellent. We had the mahi mahi tacos and jalapeño burger with crispy thin fries. The mozzarella and tomato salad was Ah-mazing!! The presentation and taste was 5 stars! Minus one star for the dessert that took a while to come out. B
Mishy N.,"San Jose, CA",105,94,17,1.0,12/4/2015,"BJ's almost killed my daughter today. Ok, well maybe I'm exaggerating a bit BUT when I order online and put a note that clearly says FOOD ALLERGY they should pay close attention. Ordered online for dine-in at 12:15. Somehow I live in a delusional little world where I think that ordering ahead of time somehow speeds up the process. At 12:50 the food finally comes but my daughter's sandwich comes with peppers on it (the ingredient I said she is allergic too). Sadly I work for the man (aka the government) so I only have an hour for lunch. The server takes the food back and says the manager is going to ""expedite"" the order. In the meantime my daughter gets to eat a plate of French fries for lunch, parenting fail. Server comes back to report the manager is going to comp both sandwiches (gee thanks). I asked for the sandwich to come back in a box because we needed to leave, oh and can we have the check please. Oh and the sandwich did NOT come back boxed. She says oh well since the sandwiches were comped do you still want to use your $10 reward. Yes, dummy I do because I don't think I'm ever returning so I might as well get my money's worth today. Now the check comes, wait for it.....Sure enough they comped the two sandwiches but then CHARGED me for the re-made sandwich. Are you sh*tting me! Then when I bring it to our server's attention, she clearly didn't understand so I had to speak to the manager. In her defense, the manager was very apologetic and did give us a gift card to use ""next time"". I really like the food at BJ's, they have good happy hour deals and the pizookies are yummy, but every time I go there I get so mad that I feel like I have a developed a case of Tourettes and can't stop cussing and want to throw dishes on the floor and squirt ketchup all over the booth as I'm leaving. Lunch is supposed to be a relaxing, enjoyable break from work. BJ's makes me a hostile lunatic. Pass."
Doug K.,"San Jose, CA",42,22,1,4.0,10/27/2013,"I'm giving them four stars because overall, the experience is good, food and beer is good, and I like the BJ's chain. But the service seems a bit ""uneven"" at this (new) location....  I have been going to BJ's since before they brewed beer... I am giving them the benefit of the doubt, since they've been open for only about 3 weeks, but geez...  Was seated today and seemingly abandoned...  Wait staff serving nearby tables, and passing us numerous times - no greeting, no nothing.... I ended up going back up to the hostess stand and asking if we would soon be served...   They promised that someone would be with us soon...  ""Stephanie G"" ended up waiting on us, although it was not her section...  She was VERY nice and took good care of us.  I would still give them a positive recommendation, and if you are looking for a place with a wide variety on the menu and good beer, plus sports on the numerous TV's around the place, BJ's will (hopefully) not disappoint...."
Emily G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",130,568,334,4.0,11/3/2013,"I love BJ's restaurants so I was stoked to find out one was going to be opening up nearby. I went on a Monday night about a week or so after they had opened. They were super busy but we were only given a 5-10 minute wait and were sat within that time frame as promised. It was very noisy inside, so I had trouble talking with my boyfriend across the table. My drink order took some time to come out, but I had kinda expected that with their busy night. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful though. She didn't know the answer to a question we had about the menu and she quickly asked a supervisor nearby and got the answer. The food was delicious too! If you go to BJ's, you pretty much have to get a pizzokie for dessert. Even if you aren't hungry any more, it's worth it."
Sara L.,"San Jose, CA",3,5,,5.0,7/9/2015,"I love this place ! Is very convenient for me because is close to my house, they always treat me nice and I love that is not too pack like the one at Santana Row, you have to wait like two hours just to get a table!  The other day I showed up with a party of 12 and they gave me a table within 20minutes of waiting without even having a reservation"
Claudia L.,"San Jose, CA",1,28,6,2.0,1/8/2014,"Came here on a Monday night because hubby was craving BJ's. Hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar area and we said okay, and just told us to sit where ever. We got a booth seat by the bar. I assumed this was part of the bar area because it was in the general area, but no wait staff came and greeted us or gave us menus. Keep in mind, it was 8:30PM on a Monday night... they weren't exactly busy. After 10 minutes, I finally walked up to the bar and asked for two menus. 8 minutes after that, a wait staff finally came around. She took our order. I ordered a soup and salad and asked specifically to hold the bleu cheese. Hubby ordered an ahi-tuna salad and a beer. We shared an avocado roll appetizer. My soup and salad came first. Nobody gave us utensils so we sat there for a good 5 minutes, until our waitress finally came around with utensils (she was apologetic). My salad was covered with bleu cheese. I didn't want to make a fuss so I just grumpily ate the gross cheese while drenching my salad in honey mustard. I ate for about 25 minutes while my husband waited for his ahi-tuna salad. Finally, we told the waitress that we'd been waiting forever for his salad. She was apologetic (again) and rushed in and brought out the salad. It must have been sitting in the kitchen for the past 15 minutes and no one bothered to bring it out. Last time something like this happened at the Cupertino BJ's, they comped the dish. Didn't do it here (not that we were looking for it, but it's a testament to their service). Also didn't help that the waitress at the table behind us seemed to know the diners sitting behind us. She kept coming back to them and chatting about personal stuff while lingering around. When it came to get the check, our waitress was nowhere to be found for 10 minutes. Ugh, so frustrating. They really need to up the level of their service and professionalism. I've never experienced anything like this at the other BJ's."
Christina P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",13,37,2,3.0,4/22/2015,"I've had my ups and downs with this BJ's, but I go back relatively often because there are plenty of options on the menu and on the TVs for whatever game is on. The food and service are both pretty inconsistent. I usually get the same thing, balsamic glazed chicken, but it has come out to me cold or missing sauce multiple times.  They have a pretty decent happy hour, but everything is half the size. Their strawberry mojitos are pretty delicious!  Even though they don't take smaller reservations, you can usually call while you're on your way and they'll put you on the wait list. This has worked for me a couple of times, but once I was waiting for nearly an hour and a half for my friends birthday! (Excluding the 15 minutes it took me to get there after calling).  Overall, I'll go back because I can't seem to stay away and they have pretty decent stuff and a good atmosphere, but just very inconsistent!"
