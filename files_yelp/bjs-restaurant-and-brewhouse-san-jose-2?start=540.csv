Christine D.,"San Jose, CA",12,1,,1.0,5/20/2014,"Place has the worse service, ever. Asked a lady who ran our food for gravy and butter and she never came back for it. And the male server we had sucked. If only I got his name I would totally put him on blast. He approached every table but ours, I sat there staring at him waiting for him to acknowledge us, but he just walked the other direction completely ignoring me. Didn't even seem busy, he took on like 4 table of 2 people and couldn't even make the effort to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else. Can't believe I spent more than 1 hour sitting there than even eating.. This server needs to realize that we as customers might have other things to do with our lives than sitting in a restaurant for hours just waiting to get service. Horrible, horrible, horrible.  This place is not the place to have a quick nice dinner."
Debbie T.,"San Jose, CA",22,70,,2.0,2/20/2016,Hostess is really incompetent. She said we would be seated right away. 10 mins later we ask if we're going to be seated and she said they ran out of menus so that's why it's taking long. A group came in after us and were seated right away outside (with menus -_-) . Another group comes in and they were getting seated. The host did not do anything until we asked her again. The waiter was great but front staff really need to be retrained
D J.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,1,1.0,1/16/2014,"so I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon plate and it did NOT look like the one on the picture on the menu, the salmon was half Â or less of size from the picture menu. then the waiter comes and tells me, is because is a low calorie plate HA! I knew it was a low calorie plate, but this one was no dinner. and it taste it bad!"
Jennifer H.,"Milpitas, CA",154,18,2,1.0,11/10/2014,I would give this place a zero if I could! Beware.. About to go on a rant!! - It was my sisters birthday party and it was a Sunday night. We understood it would be busy. I called ahead and told them we had a party of 12 coming. The girl on the phone was nice. We got there and she said it would be about an hour before we were seated. Understandable. So we were waiting... And waiting..... And waiting... An hour passes and we're patient cus they're busy. We get that. But then we've waited for about 2 hours till we got seated.  When we got seated they were missing two chairs..... Really? You had it written down for 12 people. Anyways we just grabbed our own chair and got everyone seated OURSELVES. Sat for about 10 mins before any servers came to our table to introduce themselves... Cool. We had two waiters Carlo and another fellow. Forgot his name. Worst service ever. We ordered right when we sat down cus we were starving and had been looking at the menu for almost 2 hours outside waiting to be seated. It took another hour for our food to come out. But 4 of our burger orders were cold and my plate didn't come out. I waited and waited and 10 mins later they said they have to make it again because anther waiter grabbed it..... By then the whole table had finished eating and my food hasn't even gotten out yet. I understand you can't blame our waiter completely but there were TWO waiters for our party and they couldn't even handle it? Seriously?  What made it worse was that they laughed when I was angry my food wasn't out. Then left our table and gave us another waiter. I believe his name was David. He was probably the best. He made up for all there slack. Carlo never asked about my sisters birthday and pizookie whereas David gave me my meal free and apologized and gave her a free pizookie but that didn't make up for everything.  WE CHOSE YOU GUYS TO HAVE HER BIRTHDAY DINNER. A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY. AND YOU GUYS FAILED. Never coming back...
Becky W.,"San Jose, CA",96,103,563,5.0,2/26/2014,Food is good. Pazookies are good. Just service is great now !!!!
Veeral S.,"San Jose, CA",80,158,4,1.0,3/3/2014,"I agree with many of the Other reviewers....the service here is TERRIBLE. Our waitress was very nice, but everybody besides her looked depressed to be working here. We didn't have enough utensil sets, so we had to use the napkins that came with our drinks. Another server slammed a plate on our table and just walked away (I don't know what we possibly did to make her hate us, because we had never seen her before the entire night). We didn't have enough spoons with our dessert, and had to ask several times for more. I would go to one of the other BJs in the area as they have far better service. It's really a night & day difference."
Eli N.,"San Jose, CA",7,65,5,3.0,10/11/2013,Not bad but nothing to write home about If ya wanna try it out it's not bad just come when not packed cuz your gonna wait & wait & wait our server was real good and on too of it but as a new location they are having growing pains.food was good enough but since I'm pretty much at chef status I expect more flavor in my food.
Renee N.,"San Jose, CA",106,63,26,3.0,2/23/2014,"Overall, a good solid restaurant but nothing fancy.  Pros: + Minimal wait time. Maybe it's because this place is still new, but it's never been really hard to get a table, including times I've come here on a Friday night with no reservation. The longest I've had to wait for a table was about 7 minutes.  + Good food. Food is not top-of-the-line, but it's pretty good. I personally love the baked potatoes, which they seem to only list on the lunch menu now. I've actually heard other people ask what happened to the baked potatoes during the dinner hour, so I know I'm not the only one who misses them. However, if you ask for a baked potato for dinner, they'll totally hook you up.  + Friendly wait staff. Everyone I've interacted with at BJ's has been very friendly and helpful.  Cons: - Some tables are very drafty. Twice when I've come here, they've sat me in a very drafty section near the wall. It honestly feels like you're outside and there's a cold breeze blowing in your face. I put up with it the first time, but the second time I asked to be moved. I noticed that the people they sat at the table after we moved also asked to change tables, and the waitress later told us all the tables along the wall had a draft problem. Hopefully someone fixes this!! - Don't come here for brunch. I really shouldn't hold this against them too much - this isn't a brunch place. But there aren't too many awesome brunch places in SJ and I was kind of getting desperate so I tried it out one morning. Do not do it! Everything tasted like it was just taken out of a freezer and reheated in the microwave."
Masako K.,"San Jose, CA",13,6,,1.0,8/7/2015,"We've been to BJ's in Carlsbad (near Lego Land), service was slow but got great food, so I thought other location should also be good, but it wasn't. We came to BJ's near airport for my son's birthday. I told our server that it was my son's birthday, so he got free ice cream which was nice. But no birthday song. It took away long to be served our meal, salmon was small and burned!  Very disappointed."
Stephanie T.,"San Jose, CA",35,148,18,1.0,2/23/2014,"I'm a BJ's fan but bad experience with our server tonight. My friend ordered a bowl of soup and a few minutes later asked the server to make it the large bowl. Server acted annoyed because order was already in like it couldn't be done. Um just do it. Then friend found a HAIR in his soup. Told the server. Didn't get an apology, didn't take it off the bill...nothing. Not good service at all.  My California chicken sandwich is always good but man...the hair siting is just so GROSS."
Steven H.,"San Jose, CA",114,391,134,5.0,10/12/2013,Crowded but worth the wait! I think because this is a new location there's a lot of buzz. It should slow down to a normal pace but I'm really please w the layout of the restaurant and bar. I love that there are so many choices of beer. Everything from their home made brews to a variety of outside beers on tap as well. The food is always very good. Can also never go wrong ordering a Pazookie. I promised myself not to eat so much dinner next time so i will have room for delish dessert!
Aash R.,"Raleigh, NC",1,2,,2.0,4/2/2016,The waitress forgot half our orders ! We didn't even get the desserts! Although the beers are good !
Christel L.,"San Jose, CA",5,30,11,1.0,1/15/2014,"I would give this place one and a half stars for poor service and mediocre food. My family of four waited for over thirty minutes for our food. A family of at least 6 or 7 people were seated at the table next to us after us. They ALL got their food before any of us did. We ordered a bison burger, brewhouse burger, bacon cheeseburger, and a veggie burger. All burgers (except for veggie) were cooked well-done and were dry. We asked for medium rare. The meat patties themselves were also just warm. They were not hot and did not look fresh. When we told this to the waiter, he stated that the wait is so long because they make their burgers fresh from the best ingredients. It sure didn't taste that way. I give that burger a 3/10. It was nothing special and definitely not worth the 30 minute wait. We also ordered a pizookie, which was the only good thing about this trip here. Our waiter was also not very attentive to us. He definitely was at the heels of the family sitting next to us though, making sure the game was on for them on the TVs, making sure they had all their condiments and extra drinks. Very poor service. The manager came up to us and asked how our experience was and we said we were pretty disappointed. He gave us free gift cards for an amount that would only be revealed when you use it. Thanks for the gesture, but I don't think I'm ever coming back to this location."
Steve K.,"Santa Cruz, CA",13,20,,2.0,5/5/2015,I had another business lunch at this BJ's today. The food was OK (just OK) and took a loooong time to arrive. From the time we were seated to the time our food was on the table was almost exactly one hour. The problem is that our last three lunches at BJ's have suffered from the same slow service. My colleagues and I all agreed that next time we will need to clarify our expectations when we first arrive.
Anna D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,17,,2.0,3/31/2015,"My Â family and I went to BJ's for dinner. Â It was convenient because we had just come from the airport. We arrived and were greeted and seated. There were very few people there, our waitress brought half of is water. We were very hungry, we had breakfast at 6:30. Then we quickly ordered, my daughter-in-law got a call so she went out side to take it. We waited and waited, 40 min went by and we asked about food and she brought 2 then min later 1 more and min later the burger, and claimed burgers take longer. Then we ask for the rest of our drinks and our silverware and napkins. It was very poor service, the food was not bad, but not worth the wait."
Barry M.,"San Jose, CA",7,7,,1.0,7/27/2015,Second time I've came here and my burger is over cooked I swear chef must have been on a break or just not in the kitchen!service is great and friendly very prompt the server and and took my plate back to the kitchen and said a fresh one will be made to a med-rare. I'm in the food industry and a over cooked burger (well) is unacceptable unless asked for by the customer I won't be coming back here again
Melissa R.,"San Jose, CA",293,8,1,1.0,3/13/2014,"One star is ONLY for the food, well, my food which was great! I had the calamari as my entree. It was my birthday dinner and my server was terrible. She got my boyfriend's order wrong but a family member said it's fine, we'll share this since we're hungry until his actual meal comes out. She spilled beer on my nearly TWO year old cousin and her response was ""oh sorry"" and walked away. When the food order FINALLY came out my mom asked that it be comped since it took so long and she said ""oh he said he'd pay for it so no"". WHAT THE HELL?! my cake came out and they sat it in front of my cousin and she said ""my bad I thought it was her birthday"" then when I had leftover cake she said we throw the boxes away, and handed me four different boxes to put pieces of my cake in. TERRIBLE SERVICE. Go to blossom hill location."
Monica H.,"San Jose, CA",927,683,956,2.0,12/18/2013,I am just not a fan of Chains.  But my boyfriend and I were off to a country concert across the street; so we thought of getting a table and have a pizookie and beer to get the evening started right... Well... there was pretty much an hr long wait for a table... Good thing I'm pretty smart; and got chumsy with a table at the bar; and they gave us their booth. So lucky us. But even so.... I felt bad for people who walked in ahead of us waiting badly for a table.. The wait on everything is pretty bad because this place gets really busy as it had just opened a few months ago.... Our servers were OK and tried their best to give us great service... Food wasn't really Great... I was OK with the alcohol part. So yah.. I wouldn't be craving and wanting to go back again.
Alexandra G.,"Milpitas, CA",73,216,136,2.0,3/5/2014,The only reason they get two stars is their soup and salad combo has wedge salad and clam chowder. Their wedge salad is not as good as outback. Their bleu cheese dressing is on the thinner side but it is not terrible. Their clam chowder is almost always very good. I say almost because a few times I've sent it back to be heated a bit more. I like my soup hot. Their service lacks for sure. At first I let it slide because they just opened and half the people probably lied on their application when it came to the serving part. But it has been a few months and still no improvement.  Their kids pizza is awful don't waste your money. The crust is often burnt and stale. There is no sauce. They give maybe four pepperonis. My daughter loves pizza but not from this place.
James A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,11,,1.0,6/5/2015,Waited 35 minutes to be seated after people who just walked in.  Tables were left un Â bussed. And seating hostess thought it was funny that she seated the people a head of us.  The manager had a less than concerned attitude.
