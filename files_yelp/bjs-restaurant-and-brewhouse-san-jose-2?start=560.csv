Net C.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/22/2015,"Pros: location, a lot of space, easy parking, excellent beers! I had a top sirloin once and it was really good. Cons:  on a different occasion I tried the New York Steak but I didn't like it."
Daniel A.,"Milpitas, CA",269,23,,2.0,10/12/2013,"TBH I should not be judging a place that just opened because not everyone is trained yet, but I couldn't help how uncomfortable my GF and I were.  What I am going to say is, as a manager, DO NOT awkwardly stand behind your server while they are taking orders and bussing and not helping them at all. Not only are you making the server nervous and you're making the guests nervous too.  I felt like I had to my exhibit my guest service to the server so she could look good to the obvious manager man that's standing behind her fixing chairs already straight. Pretty sure once they all get into the swing of things and have a better foundation, things will be better."
Rob M.,"Gilroy, CA",57,24,5,3.0,12/1/2014,"Went on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 10, not busy, so wait time was 5mins max. Seated in what seemed a ""dark room"", could barely see the menu and had to use our iPhones torch to scan through the menu. Ordered and wait time was as expected 15-20mins. We seemed to feel a little rushed with our orders though like as if the waiter had to be somewhere after her shift, anyway, the food was pretty good, drinks were coming in nice and quick. Had a great time among family friends. Spent a good hour and half there. Waiter again bugging us with a hurry up attitude asking if we have sorted the check, which had been done for 10 mins, and she then says ""great, now I can go home"". Ew, excuse you."
Sean H.,"San Jose, CA",15,137,25,2.0,1/29/2014,"I don't usually right reviews for restaurant chains but here it goes! Food: 2 stars  Drinks: 4 stars Server: 4+stars  Waiting time: -3stars Mistakes: -1star Our food just wasn't all that, it wasn't horrid, but it was far from fantastic. The pasta was like paste, and quite bland. The burger my friend had, she said was ok. I had a bite at it was just so overwhelmingly greasy, and overcooked!  Now the drinks were good! Nothing was too string, all good there! (Alcohol helps when the food isn't that great!)  Now our server was really nice! Kathy!  She was very sweet and helpful! She is the only reason this is at 2 stars! So props to her! Now we came in around 4:00 pm on a Thursday, no wait, not very crowded. We order an appetizer, and about two minutes later we order our food. Our food got there around 5 mins before the appetizer! (hmmm. kind of backwards??) . Then we order mixed drink refills which took just over around 20 mins, Now this was not our servers fault! She was trying to serve around 15 tables alone! Then we ordered a drink at the end, that didn't ever come. And were still charged! Took around 10-15 mins just for them to take it off!  All in all I don't think ill be back any time in the future!"
Eric T.,"Santa Clara, CA",23,41,16,1.0,2/24/2014,"I love BJ's, but my last visit at the restaurant on Coleman ave in San Jose was horrible. The server was rude and inattentive. Pizza was missing cheese. The wings only had five wings. The long forgotten salad finally arrived after the manager came by and asked how the meal is going. And the final mistake we made was ordering a pizookie which was burnt. The manager should have either comp'd the entire meal or fixed it, swapped waiters(it's kind if awkward receiving poor service from a waiter with his tail between his legs and still a poor job), and last but not least, come back to the table to ensure the remainder of our night was satisfying. Not a big deal though. I will be going to the Cupertino location."
P G.,"San Jose, CA",1,108,6,3.0,2/24/2014,"Been here twice over the last 4 months, the service is very spotty, need more help in the kitchen and with wait staff.  Food is OK, nothing great, I have been to other BJ's and liked them but this one has a long way to go in service and quality improvements. We called ahead to be put on the call in list and when we got there they said they would not honor the call in list...well, then they should not have taken our name and told us to be there in 20 minutes"
Michelle D.,"San Jose, CA",5,13,7,1.0,3/12/2014,"Service was okay... The reason why my review is a 1 star rating mainly because of what I ordered here. My boyfriend and I just wanted a pizookie, no food. I ordered a pizookie to share with my boyfriend. A pizookie comes in a circular baking pan with a scoop of ice cream on top.  When I started to dig in,  my spoon hit the pan right away..... Right off the bat, I noticed there was BARELY any of the cookie in it. Seriously, it was so thin?! I feel like a paid 7 bucks(tip included) just for a scoop of ice cream.  For a restaurant chain like BJs, why would you skimp out? SMH, Not coming back."
Debbie S.,"San Jose, CA",39,37,15,4.0,12/3/2013,"I really don't understand why there are so many negative comments for this place, we almost didn't come here because of it.  We thought we would go for happy hour and give that a try first.  We were greeted at the door by several young ladies who were very friendly and upbeat.   We walked right in and took a seat at the bar so we could watch the Monday night football game. The bartender came over to service us right away.  She told us all about the happy hour specials and said we could even order food there if we would rather have that. We had some wine and beer and order a few of the appetizers, the calamari was outstanding. We had an enjoyable time, and we will return to try out the dinner menu sometime."
Roger N.,"San Jose, CA",53,30,55,4.0,1/2/2015,"I went to here with my uncle,we order appetizer, so yummy.also I order chicken salad.the waiters very nice and polite,special Nicole she his the best,I recommend to give them try,no disappointing."
Sara S.,"San Jose, CA",15,14,14,3.0,4/7/2014,"Open late even on week nights. Creative extended menus. Veggie burgers are available, but not currently on the menu. Avocado egg rolls were delicious. However, the avocado cream sauce for the fish tacos was terrible, old or something. Too much paprika for my taste on the Moroccan Salmon. Service was okay. Refills could have been quicker. This place is crazy busy on the weekends as they are especially known for their beers and cocktails. They invented the Pizookie, which is yummy."
Francis P.,"Santa Clara County, CA",113,14,,1.0,4/7/2015,"Waiting 35 minutes for 2 steaks and the waiter comes out after 20 minutes. He offered something while we wait, but not interested. He says the kitchen us backed up and the restaurant  is not even full. I've experienced this twice before but this is the longest wait. The food is good, but it's not worth the wait and the waiters are consistent in not informing patrons unless you get their attention. This is the only BJ'S I ever been to, and I'm here because a friend wanted to try it.  I truly don't recommend this place based on the help and the long time wait.  Waiting can ruin your evening and you know what I mean by that statement.  Bad management and staff- at least the person waiting on us."
Wesley R.,"Santa Clara, CA",17,6,,2.0,10/28/2013,"I'm giving them 2 stars only because the food was pretty good and our server tried to serve us the best she could. I had a birthday dinner here last night with 12 friends. I called in 3 whole weeks prior to make a reservation. I called the night before just to make sure that they had my reservation and to let them know I would be coming. At first they couldn't find my reservation, this was foreshadowing what would eventually happen. I got there on time for my reservation and was told it would take about 20 minutes for another large party to leave. This was fine as people from my party were still showing up. However, after 45 minutes of waiting it got a bit ridiculous. I was then told that there was no room inside for a party of my size, and the other large party had just gotten their food. The only option they had was for us to sit outside. We chose to sit outside in the chilly weather. The heaters could only do so much with how cold it was outside. Our server was nice but she was being run around too. She wasn't supposed to be waiting tables outside and was running back and forth. The food runners kept bringing food to our table that we hadn't ordered, it was for other tables elsewhere. The food took a long time to come but it was pretty good. Our server had to take a break right in the middle of our evening and we were switched to another server. Later on, our original server returned. Afterwards we ordered pizookies and those took forever to come. They messed up the pizookie orders and forgot about one of them. By this time, it was 3 hours after people were told to arrive, everyone was freezing, food runners kept bringing food and drinks to our table that we hadn't ordered, everyone just wanted to leave, but we were waiting on a pizookie we had ordered that they forgot about. People were getting impatient and frustrated. We finally got out of there but it was such a bad experience that I will not be going back anytime soon. The management really needs to get their act together because the service was terrible overall and nobody knows what's going on. If somebody makes a reservation 3 weeks in advance, you must be able to accommodate that party! Maybe since this is a new establishment, they will get things together eventually but they certainly haven't gotten anything together yet!"
J J.,"San Jose, CA",2,40,6,1.0,8/27/2014,"I wasn't going to write a review because the only people who do so are those that received inferior service or products.  However, after two attempts in three days to eat at this BJ's, I feel compelled to write one.   I will not write about my first attempt that ended in my bf and I walking out and going to Chili's for dinner, nor will I write about my second attempt last night.  What I will say is this.  Everytime I have eaten at this BJ's, the food has been very good.  Better quality than the BJ's at TanForan.  My biggest gripe is with the management.  This location has got a serious management problem!  Any manager that allows his or her employees to provide such horrible service should be fired!  The service is always hit and miss!  Some serviers are very good.  However, the majority are terrible!  I blame this on the management.  Shame on you for not managing your staff!"
Ruthe R.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/30/2015,The food and beers are great. HOWEVER the service was atrocious! From the hostess not be able to pay attention long enough to seat us to the server that didn't even check on for at least 15 minutes. Then she couldn't bring any of or dishes at the same/correct time. One person got their soup & salad then about 10 minutes later we got an appetizer then another 15 minutes and we finally got our salads. OH YEAH and then ten minutes after that we got the bread appetizer that we wanted to start with. Have to say this BJ's has some issues.
Betty K.,"Newark, CA",23,56,82,5.0,2/25/2015,"Michelle B. Was my server, she was so nice and professional. Ask for all the question that I need... Quick and fast service...ordered kale Brussel  sprout salad yummy!!! Friendly services with big smile."
Jennifer L.,"San Jose, CA",2,27,,2.0,5/11/2015,"Hubby and I finished shopping a little early and decided to catch an early dinner.  We were seated right away (not crowded) but waited for our server for about 10 minutes.  He took our beer order and calamari appetizer order.  No kidding, it took almost 20 minutes to get our 2 beers!  The waiter kept telling us it was coming.  Then the calamari arrived, and it was cold.  Honestly, it was very bland and I was really disappointed that it was served with ranch dressing.  Ranch dressing for calamari?  Shouldn't it be tartar sauce?  My husbands burger arrived and it was very well done even though he ordered it medium.  My pizza was just okay.  The tomatoes on top tasted like they were canned and not fresh.  I've been to BJ's restaurants in other locations and had a good experience.  I think this one needs a little work.  Getting a beer at a ""Brewhouse"" shouldn't be so difficult!"
David G.,"Union City, CA",24,356,1,1.0,12/18/2013,"I frequent the Newark BJ's quite often and used to go to the Cupertino one as well.  This time I met up with a client for a quick meeting and drink.  We already ate somewhere prior and just wanted a drink so we headed to the bar area.  Did I mention we went to the BAR area?!?  The waitress took our drink order and asked if we wanted appetizers, we said no, she said she will leave the menu in case we changed our minds.  She must have came like 5 times rudely asking if we were going to eat.  Finally after we said we are just there for a drink she rolled her eyes and said whatever.  For the rest of the hour we were there we got dirty looks from her!"
Mazin K.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/19/2015,Avoid at all cost! Worst service I have ever had! The food does not have the same quality as other BJ's in the bay area. I will never eat at this location again. I wish I could give them zero or negative stars.
Harris H.,"Milpitas, CA",0,9,1,3.0,12/8/2014,Nice atmosphere. Great sport venue during game day. Great menu and good selection of beers.
Mike G.,"Saratoga, CA",0,1,,3.0,6/12/2015,"BJs is my favorite upscale casual chain and The food across the chain is pretty consistent and to my taste. I want to give this place 4 stars, but the service here knocks it down. For example, my Caesar salad just arrived in a hot bowl, I almost always ask for Sriracha (which they have) and get told they don't have it, which means the server is either lazy or uninformed (another form of lazy). Despite the spotty service, I keep coming back. I guess they won't improve until the bottom line shows it. Sigh."
