Betty B.,"Riverside, CA",87,140,48,2.0,6/11/2015,A few problems with this place. The service was extremely slow took forever to get our orders in and to receive the food. My biggest problem was that everyone got their entrees except my mom and I. We went with a large party. We did not get our food until after everyone was done eating. What got me upset was the server kept coming by saying oh a few more minutes. Well a few minutes was like 15. Not very happy with the experience there. I do not live in the area but I do visit a lot and I unfortunately I will not be back if ever suggested.
Lisa B.,"Rose Garden, San Jose, CA",2,10,4,2.0,3/9/2014,"I don't know why I keep trying to have a good experience here.  Last time I came to dine here, a friend and I got sat and waited about 15 minutes to be greeted by any server at all! Then we had to flag our waitress down again to put in our order like she forgot about us. Not exaggerating - an hour and a half later our food still hadn't come out. When it did, my pizza was cold but I was so starving by then so I forced it down. My friend asked for no veggies in her teriyaki chicken which, of course, came with veggies. At that point we asked to speak with a manager.  We got a complimentary pizookie which was nice. Still wouldn't bother with this place anymore though, not worth the hassle!"
Mr P.,"San Jose, CA",1,7,,2.0,11/17/2014,"I gatta agree with allot of these reviews ""LAME"" service. Decent grub, but they seem to always figure out a way to mess up my orders.....Check it out for yourself San Jose foodies. Mr. powers don't steer you wrong"
Rigo G.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/19/2016,"Ate their clam chowder and puked, poor customer service, took and hour for some ranch. Flat out garbage"
Catherine W.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,2.0,3/19/2016,"Was very excited to have a nice place to eat on a Saturday evening.  The wait staff are great.  Friendly, helpful and seriously great.  The atmosphere is good too.  The food not so much.  Every visit someone is off when they bring the food to the table.  First time the baked potato's were cold to the touch.  Another visit the sauce was too salty.  I hate returning food.  I am generally so ready to eat I don't want to wait for it to be corrected and you have that feeling like you are trying not to pay for something.  The last visit was horrid.  That's when we stopped eating there.  We waited a very long time for the food my chicken dish was cold and salty again.  We were told it was because his eggs took so long.  REALLY?  eggs are faster or should be then chicken and pasta.  So I switched dishes to ribs and decided not to bother with this place anymore.  Oh and once we were eating in the bar and they sat children right up to the bar!  And the kids were acting like kids.  So odd to me.  At one time it was a law not to have children in bars...... I guess that has changed."
Carina M.,"Seattle, WA",273,982,176,2.0,11/23/2013,"Food was fine enough to merit 3 stars. However, docking 1 star because the server, however efficient, was cold and unapologetic for the 15 minute wait before even coming over and getting our drink order. We were willing to overlook that, but she made an error on our bill and fixed it, but was not gracious about it - no apologies for overcharging us on beers we didn't order. She made it feel like she did us the favor when it was her mistake. Didn't appreciate her tone. Server also seemed put out by the fact that we did not want BJs beer - we specifically asked for NON BJs beer. Food was good enough and better than your average BJs. Service was good, if a bit condescending and ungracious. Will come back for the food, but not the beer and hopefully next time we'll have a friendlier server who doesn't keep us waiting for 15 minutes and tries to overcharge us on food we didn't receive."
Alexis G.,"Anaheim, CA",0,9,5,2.0,11/10/2014,"I had the WORST service ever. I have never had service this bad I actually left NO TIP. Our server Candi made us feel so unwelcome and was in such a rush. It took her 15 min to greet us, 30 min to bring out WATER, and never checked in on us after our food came out. When I asked another server for water, he denied me and told me to wait for my server who was no where to be found. She also kept bringing the wrong food and drink to the wrong tables, not just mine. It seemed like she had a lot on her plate and was in too much of a rush. Never want to go back to this chain again."
Samantha S.,"San Jose, CA",14,6,,2.0,2/25/2016,"I ordered food from here on door dash i asked for a brewhouse burger with onion straws, lettuce, burger sauce and swiss cheese. I received the blue cheese burger with raw onions and tomatoes. Nothing close to what i ordered. I also didn't receive my fries. I would not recommend ordering from here. I have two starrs because despite being incorrect i found out i do like blu cheese.  Unfortunately didn't make up for not getting any part of what i actually wanted."
Aparna K.,"San Jose, CA",31,180,198,4.0,5/18/2014,Love the food and cocktails here. Salmon with caramelized onions is a big hit. I also like the tilapia with mango salsa.  Their south west rolls are a bit oily but extremely tasty. Very good service as they recently opened this center in San Jose downtown:)
Joseph F.,"Denver, CO",4,3,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Sat in the bar area, waited for service, watched three waiters clean about five tables around us and never acknowledged us, got up and left. Sad"
E R.,"San Jose, CA",1,23,206,1.0,2/20/2016,"Worst server, worst food and the worst service we have ever had. We had a young boy who was our server who didn't even come to our table. After 25 min my husband had to go up to him to ask him to take our drink order. We immediately ordered our drinks and food. One hour later our food arrived...which one of the meals was wrong. At this point the boy who delivered our food(not our waiter) fixed the mistakes. We asked for him to get out waiter, but he apparently was too busy to come help us. It must have been all the waitresses he was trying to hit on instead of checking on his tables. One of the guests in our party eventually asked the waiter when he came to give us the bill how long he worked in the restaurant industry for. He replied, ""well I lied on my application to get the job, I really have only worked for four months."" This by far was the worst dinner we have had in a very long time. We will not be back and I suggest you don't waste your time and money on this place. The three girls that worked behind the bar were good though! I have to give them props!"
Erin H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",44,211,23,3.0,11/21/2013,"Okay. Another benefit-of-the-doubt review. So this location just opened and I understand that they have some kinks to work out.  What I find a bit ridiculous is that on a Wednesday night at 9pm in a half-full dining room with twice as many servers as necessary, a meal will take you 3 hours to complete. Not joking. Exaggerating a little bit, but not joking.  Our waitress was nice, but frazzled. Seemed like she was new or something. It took her a very long time to come to our table, a long time for our drinks to come out, a long time before she took our food order, a long time to get the food, a long time to sit with an empty plate and empty glasses, a long time to get dessert, but a surprisingly short time to have the check picked up. To be fair, about 3/4 of the way through our meal she went on her lunch break and some other dude took over. He wasn't spectacular, but he at least refilled our water glasses.  Honestly though, the only actual positive thing I have to say is that pizooki's are flippin amazeballs.  To sum up, don't come on a Wednesday night at 9pm if you are in a hurry. Order early, drink beer (it makes the waiting MUCH less frustrating), eat dessert, pay the check and leave.  A 2 star experience, but like I said, benefit-of-the-doubt."
Charissa Z.,"San Jose, CA",17,32,18,2.0,12/11/2013,"Okay I have to admit the second time was okay. The hist wasn't very much educated at what he was supposed to be doing, but the hostess helped me with my rewards card on my phone so that I can check in. The wait was okay. I understand that they were a busy restaurant. Didn't mind the wait. It wasn't too long of the wait. What's funny, is that my bf said we have had the same hostess who sat us to our table from last timweand it was the SAME hostess (as he says) that I didn't like from the first time we went to eat there aand was actually acknowledging me this time. Wow... but yet we had three servers the first one I think was off after she took our order. the second one, she was rude. The third one was very nice. All in all, the food was amazing all tho I regret not ordering the wedges :(. I should've ordered them. AND the only thing that satisfies my tummy there is the pazooki. Its always a plus with the pazooki in my tummy!"
Lucy L.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,1,1.0,11/13/2013,"I had high hopes for this local brewpub given I live close by.    They have been open long enough to have their staffing and slow food service refined at this point. From the time were seated, it took at least 20 minutes to even get a glass of water.    From that point forward, it seemed as though there was a steady flow of servers, none of whom we could flag down.     Eventually our food arrived...cold...and all I can attest to is our meals which were mediocre.    The waiter took my food before I was done...swooped in like an eagle and of course, given we'd been trying to track him down our entire time there with great diffficulty, we gave up.      We waited for another 5 mins or so to get someone's attention to order dessert to no avail. On my way out I spoke to the general manager and informed her about such horrible service, cold and mediocre food and I've never seen a manager so non-plussed about a complaint.    Now that I look on Yelp, I can see she has had many. Maybe they weren't prepared for the crowds, but given BJ's has invested in a brand new building, you'd think they would have refined their service and food at this point, or invested in a manager that would have some success in hiring and training staff. Unless I see an uptick in good reviews, I wouldn't waste my money on anything other than a beer right under the bartender's nose."
Lillian T.,"San Jose, CA",186,86,14,2.0,9/12/2014,"I really want to give them more stars, but every time I come here, I get pretty disappointed, even if I keep giving them chances. I came here twice recently and on both occasions, I was a bit disappointed. This review will be based on my recent experience, though I have had previous experience here also. The first time, I came here with some friends for dinner. For those of you that may not know, BJ's has a pretty extensive menu, much like Cheesecake Factory, so.. don't exactly expect the best food for that reason. I believe we came on a Saturday night, and there wasn't much of a wait. It's a pretty big location, so even though they were pretty busy, there were still open tables. I ordered their shrimp tacos (new) with a side salad. My friends ordered some other things that I did not try. Time passes, and they bring out all our entrees, but where is my side salad that was supposed to come before the meal? :( The server came by and I inquired about it. Turns out, she had forgot to put the order in, but said she would take care of it (comp). I thought that was nice of her, but when the salad came out, it was just this dinky place of lettuce! What kind of side salad is that? It literally looks like someone took some lettuce out of a bag and threw it out on the plate and added some dressing. Needless to say, I was actually pretty disappointed with that salad. I ate the salad and my tacos around the same time because my tacos had already come out. The tacos were around $10 and were okay. They use baby shrimp and there's about 3 or 4 pieces in each (2) taco. I have to say, it was hardly worth my $10.  My second most recent encounter, was for a weekday happy hour. Their happy hour has changed since I've known it. It used to have a bigger variety of appetizers and I believe it used to also be a better deal in terms of price. My friend and I ended up order two mini $6 deep dish pizza's, a $5 appetizer of wings and sauces, and a $5 with $1 supplement of sliders with bacon and cheese. These were all items on the HH menu. I'm not entirely sure how they make their deep dish pizza's, but all the toppings essentially sink in the middle so the pizza's come out looking a bit of a funnel going downwards. The pizzas were actually pretty good but a bit salty, considering we got the ones with so much meat. The meat was not slathered on, but sufficed. The sliders that came out were typically slider size, and comes with a side of fries. I don't really have much to complain about that order, and would probably order the sliders again, but man, little burgers are pricey. Next, our review of the wings. They allow you to choose 3 dipping sauces because the wings are not tossed already, but rather, you dip them yourself. The plate comes with 5 wings, and some celery. I mean come on.. for $5, you're giving me pinky sized wings that do not taste nearly as good as Wingstops pinky sized wings? I definitely regret that order the most. The wings were not the only downside to this story- but I don't know if they were short staffed or what, but service was extremely slow. My water never got refilled, I waited forever for the check and for my receipt. Our server was friendly though so that's a plus. Overall, I actually don't like coming to BJ's very much because they have always been pretty pricey for bar type food. I have had a few good experiences where I would vouch for them, but those experiences were quite a while ago, and I'm pretty sure the company culture isn't the same now. I always tell myself to not go, but I always end up back there for whatever stupid reason to give them another chance. It'll probably happen again, but I hope my review helped some people decide on if they want to dine here or not."
Ben D.,"Campbell, CA",268,7,,5.0,3/16/2015,My server tonight was Ariel. She was such a sweetheart. She came to my table with a beautiful smile on her face every single time. After a long day at work her service made my day. I will come back just because of her.
Yesenia C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/9/2016,"I have never been to a BJ's restaurant in my life so I was pretty excited, but boy was I disappointed. I got invited because of my friend's birthday and when we got there we were told that the reservation wasn't in the computer, even though we called to make it beforehand. They told us that two tables were just finishing up so we would be seated soon, the wait was almost an hour and now I understand why. It took our server an HOUR just so she could give us our tabs. Like, seriously? She kept saying "" I'm coming! I'm bringing the check!"" throughout the course of an hour but would disappear and not bring it. Also, whenever we would ask another server for something he said he couldn't help us because he's not our server but if OUR server is not helping us then who do we turn to? After we are seriously about to walk out because we need to go and no one is showing up she finally brings the tabs and excuses herself with how ""it takes a while to print"". I have worked in a restaurant before and split checks, it does not take an hour, especially when it's dead. Overall extremely disappointed, I literally got the Yelp app just to write this review. Don't go here, or at least don't get the server with the black hair and glasses, she never told us her name.  Ps. The Pazookis were bomb."
Dan T.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,92,128,2.0,11/3/2013,"Avoid this place until they figure out their staffing issues, food service is very slow.  Food Quality and preparation are weak.  Much better places to go."
Joshua N.,"Concord, CA",18,41,,4.0,1/25/2015,Met with a date to watch the Warrior game.  I ordered the Tuscan Chicken pasta.  It was okay.
Eric M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",132,8,51,1.0,9/6/2014,"Family dinner mixed drinks and beer good waiter good kids meals ok salad good wife's meal good my steak was to be medium and it was burnt , from the grill. I kindly told the waiter. Ten minutes later I had a nice looking steak took one bite and it was salt city . It was like the cook got mad and pored the hole salt shaker on my food . Had a word with the waiter he said I'll get the manager after waiting 10 min no manager. Told my family lets go ... I refuse to pay there out 150.00 plus a 20.00 tip I give the drinks and the waiter 5 stars and the chef a -5!!!!!"
