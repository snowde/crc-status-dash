Oliver C.,"San Jose, CA",36,103,116,2.0,6/17/2017,Not sure why I keep coming back except for the occasional change of scenery and casual food.  Extremely slow service.  Beers are relatively fast.  Apps come out fast.  But over 30 minutes to get a burger.  And asked for waters... never received.
Patty G.,"San Jose, CA",2,50,98,4.0,5/16/2017,So I came back to this location and this time around my experience was a lot better. Our waitress was so sweet and kind. Most of the food was great and our strawberry lemonades were delicious. I do think they should immediately change their broccoli cheddar soup recipe cause it was unappetizing! But the booth was clean when we sat down and the restaurant seemed pretty chill for 3:30pm.
Raquel K.,"San Jose, CA",185,156,194,3.0,12/9/2016,"The food was good. Always consistant. Waiter kept our glass full, both beer and water. Even though he didnt know it was Thursday night football and Happy Hour stays open...It was nice that he changed one of the channels to the football game in the dining area."
Amy A.,"Austin, TX",87,23,3,1.0,11/19/2017,"I am a female who visited your location, dining alone I chose to sit at the bar. It was busy so I patiently waited before the bartender took my drink order and offered me a menu. A female bartender joined the male bartender who previously tended to me. The stood at the opposite end of the bar visiting as he prepared drinks. She was more interested in flirting with the busy male bartender to notice the patrons. When they looked at my end of the bar I raised my hand to signal I was ready to place my order. They returned to their personal conversation giving no indication they acknowledged me. The female bartender eventually sauntered down and offered to take my order. I ordered the sirloin steak medium rare. When the meal arrived the steamed broccoli was cold in spots and the mashed potatoes were firm, not fluffy, and lukewarm. The medium rare steak I ordered was well done and dry. I let the bartender know the meal was disappointing but chose not to send it back because I was too hungry to wait for another meal to come out. Later the bartended asked if the manager came out to talk to me and they had not at that point. I was in a call when someone finally decided to come talk to me, but I let them know I was on the phone. The man apologized and left but never came back. I've waited about 20 minutes and still no one has come to talk to me about this awful experience. I shall not return to this BJs location. The service is poor and the food was less than stellar."
Bruce's A.,"Cupertino, CA",312,314,1457,1.0,3/30/2016,"This is an updated review on an experience we had. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had here, which is sad :( We made a reservation a week in advanced and as we got in, they didn't honor our reservation for some reason and we had to wait for over an hour. We weren't even properly seated, we had to make our own table OUTSIDE with chairs from other tables. Then we were pathetically served after even more waiting. Our food took so long to get to our table, and once it was given to us, it was poorly made.  I understand that they are people, and I understand that accommodating people can be difficult, however, both my friend and I felt as though we weren't properly taken care of at all. She was very disappointed for her birthday. I don't know if we would ever come back to this particular location. Learn a thing or two from the Fremont BJ's."
Josh Z.,"San Jose, CA",30,122,16,3.0,5/13/2017,Get this kitchen manager some help. Johnny was great with dealing with the issues we had with our meal but his support staff on the front end struggled.  Johnny seemed to genuinely care about fixing the issues. I'll be back because I really think he wants to improve the experience but overall was very underwhelmed with the experience.
Raymond G.,"San Francisco, CA",131,60,6,1.0,3/26/2017,"This review is based on this location only.   1) Drinks comes late from the bar if you are sitting in the dining area.  2) Appetizers took 35 minutes.  3) Waiter was super slow.  Literally.  4) Takes more than 10 minutes to refill drinks.  5) Ordered 6 meals.  2 never came within 1 hour and 15 minutes of ordering.  The two guests left.  The other two meals were incorrect.   After 6 people ordered, only three people ate because it took 90 minutes for the other meal to come back. 90 minutes! Coleman location - get you act together because you guys suck.  I love BJs, but this one BJ I do not want ever again......"
Aj A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,3,1,1.0,5/17/2017,Server was great. Actually getting food to eat took way to Long for how slow it was on a Wednesday night. I'm Hangry AF.
Katie N.,"San Francisco, CA",934,223,1227,1.0,3/3/2017,"Stay far far away from this location if you want decent services!!  I think I've been to this location 5 times since it opened, due to the convenience of Target and TJs in the same plaza, and the service is still horrible. I came tonight with a friend, sat at the bar hopping for faster services. One after another, the bartenders passed by my friend and I as if we were invisible, while the old fat dude next to us was greeted and served before us, SERIOUSLY?!?!? I almost snapped when my friend finally ordered 2 beers from the bartender and she acted like her job was SO hard!! It felt like pulling teeth just to order one item. If the bartenders wonder why they're not getting good tips, here's a tip for them, do your job and be attentive!! I recommend going somewhere else or just stay far away from this crappy location."
Myrna C.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,55,18,3.0,10/14/2017,Ordered wings and a salad.  Wings came out first and I waited almost 15 more minutes for my salad.   Ordered the monkey bread pizookie.... sad part was they brought it out with chocolate ice cream bc they had run out of vanilla...... on a Sunday night.   How do u run out of vanilla ice cream??
Susan L.,"Milpitas, CA",343,151,123,2.0,3/9/2017,"Great location! Lacking in service... Got here before the ""dinner rush."" So the main dining area was not busy. I would say about a fourth occupied. If anything, the bar area was busy due to those who were probably there taking advantage of happy hour.  Food was really slow in coming out. The person delivering the food didn't even know where to go.  I had to wave them down and say that it was our table's that he was holding. Food tasted off. Maybe the cooks were having an off day? Our server only checked in once and it was right after we got our food. Yeah, cool. The food tastes great when I haven't even picked up a fork yet..."
Chelsea R.,"Campbell, CA",18,64,11,1.0,2/21/2017,"It was 10:20pm on a Tuesday night, not busy whatsoever, and three waiters passed by us. No acknowledgement from any of them.  10:45pm and we were STILL waiting. My hubby and I got up and left.  This location has been consistently TERRIBLE with their service. Slow, inconsiderate, and uninterested in actually serving.  If you want to actually eat and not sit around waiting, I'd recommend going to another location."
Jasmine N.,"San Jose, CA",259,258,2280,3.0,2/27/2016,"This was my first one at this location. I've been to all the other locations, Oakridge and Cupertino and never had a bad experience. I decided to go here with my date since it was the closest one to us since it opened. This location is much smaller than the other locations I've been too but it is nice, and clean, and it's aesthetically pleasing and cures my OCD haha It wasn't too busy, went around 11pm on a Wednesday night. Plenty of parking in the plaza shared with Target, Panera Bread, Jamba Juice, and more . Located by Wingstop.  We decided on a Medium Sized Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza, Calamari to start and then ended it with a White Chocolate Macadamia Pazookie of course. Upon reading previous reviews, I was kinda skeptical since it said the service here was slow. It was not busy at all when we went but our server Ryan was attentive and nice. If anything I felt the food took awhile to come out. The calamari was good but damn, the size was so  small. I don't remember it ever being that small? Even the picture in the menu was like twice or even triple the size of that. It was expensive for 14-16 dollars :( (See picture for reference) The pizza was okay, not amazing. I've had deep dish here before but this one did not seem deep dish at all, more like a regular pizza but with a stuffed crust you would get from like Pizza Hut or something lol it needed more ranch and was sort of dry. For what it costs, i didn't think it was worth the 20 something bucks just for the pizza  The Pazookie was   as always. It was the winner of the night.  Thumbs up for nice staff, host and server.  Food is okay here at this location, Pazookie is good. I would come back only if I had to. Prefer the other locations over this one."
Bill B.,"San Jose, CA",5,17,1,1.0,6/18/2017,Service is horrible. Wait wait wait.  Employees on the deck enjoying after work yet still waiting for food.  Avoid and fire the Manager.
Jay A.,"San Jose, CA",3,116,11,3.0,2/24/2017,"The food is pretty good and very consistent wherever you go to one of these places. They have done a very good job at being consistent. I have been to half a dozen BJ's restaurants in CA and always know what to expect. The salads taste pretty fresh and all the items I have ever ordered from the menu are tasty. They have a bunch of microbrew ""craft"" beer selections if that is your thing, and even have a microbrew root beer which is really excellent! Their dessert menu is also really good, including what they call a ""pizzookie"" which is a giant cookie that comes out hot with ice cream over it. Damn those things are really good. If you read my reviews and have been to this place, you know what my complaint is. The f*ck!ng music. Always always always blaring like really super loud to the point that you can't even hear the person sitting across from you. I really wish places like this would stop with the concert experience. I am there to eat, not to get hearing loss. If they got their music volume under control, I would give them 4 stars. If they had no music, I would give them 5 stars."
Desiree B.,"San Jose, CA",189,15,10,2.0,5/2/2017,"My family and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner on Sunday evening and the table service was not great. We waited no more than 10 minutes for a table of 5, which wasn't a problem at all. Our server was not the best. I, too, am in the food service business, and I understand if you're having a bad day or maybe you're just new...but I just didn't feel like this was the best our server could do. We were served the appetizers we ordered, but we weren't given any plates or even utensils.  Later on, as we finished our entrees, waiting on dessert, our server did not touch one plate to bring back to the kitchen. Not even a single busser or other employee offered to get the plates out of our way. Even when our server took our order for desserts, she saw our plates and just walked away.  We had ordered two chocolate chip pizookies but was only given one. When we asked our server where the other one was, she looked confused as if she didn't confirm that we ordered two. My boyfriend said it was okay and that she didn't need to bring the second one out. She insisted there was ""another one"", yet we still waited 15 minutes for that one to come out. I wish this experience could've been better. BJ's is not really my favorite place to eat, but a better experience would've made it enjoyable."
a c.,"San Mateo, CA",1,60,21,1.0,8/5/2017,"Totally remembered why I stopped going to BJ's, expensive food with mediocre flavor and HORRIBLE service. This Coleman branch is certainly perpetuating this stereotype, ""Excuse me, may I ask for a glass of water?"", Reply: ""Let me find your server."", I understand service stations, but water shouldn't be a 2-server situation."
Natalia R.,"Santa Clara, CA",38,106,343,1.0,4/28/2017,Ive been to this location once before and the service wasnt bad. That changed on our last visit. We decided to come in with a party of 9 and order just desserts. It happened to be my sisters bday and they had piezookies on special. Perfect combo? Well not really.  It seemed that they were either under staffed of very confused. It took us about 1 hour to get our dessert. When they finally came out half were wrong and others had already melted icecream. The bill came and they had added another extra dessert. Good thing we did not order food otherwise we would've stayed there till closing. We got the 730pm but didn't get to leave until 930 between all the confusion. There were other tables which seemed to have had the same issues. They did remove 2 desserts for the inconvenience and they were very polite but the experience was a bit disappointing in the end as we were all ready to call it a night after being there for close to 2 hours. I might go to different location next time i want bjs. Quite sad
Andrew S.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,15,20,5.0,12/28/2016,"The Basketball game is loud.  But, we got our favorite server Roberto.  He has treated us well from day one.   This is our goto for dinner when we can't decide.   Food is great."
Munazzar T.,"San Jose, CA",128,63,9,4.0,9/9/2017,Always have fun here with my son...he likes the chicken nuggets and fries and I like my Heff lol...
