Amanda H.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,13,,2.0,3/1/2015,"Two stars are for the hostess and food...waiter was horrible and I try not to judge so much because I'm a server myself. Came here after arriving into San Jose and my bf suggested this place because he's been to other bjs and loved it. We noticed it was late night happy hour and when server finally came over with no personality whatsoever, we asked him if there were any food items on happy hour or if it was only drinks. His words were ""well if you pay attention to the fine print, you would see a few items here on the menu"".......I was actually shocked at what I had just heard lol with no ""just kidding"" or anything to follow such a rude statement.  Maybe you get that question a lot and it annoys you,  but go and vent in the back if you have to, never to a customer.  Nothing really got better the rest of the night. He walked past an empty beer glass about 3 times and we finally asked him for another beer. Had to ask for our check, and had to wave him down after about 3 times walking past our card. Maybe Frank was having a rough night or maybe helping people isn't the job for you."
Thang N.,"Campbell, CA",317,25,14,1.0,11/16/2014,One of the female bartenders was alarmingly rude. She was snappy in her demeanor. Idk if it was intentional or she was just careless. Right when I finished eating she just snatched the plate and towels away from me without even asking or making eye contact. Didn't even get a chance to wipe the grease off my hands. I was just there for a beer and a thin crust pizza appetizer minding my own business. During the whole time she was eyeballing me like I was a burden...creepy. Left her a much bigger tip than she deserved anyway. The world is what we make of it.
Jenn L.,"San Jose, CA",9,3,,1.0,1/9/2015,"Long wait and undercooked food! I ordered a burger online and when I got to BJ's had to wait a good 8-10 minutes to be helped at the takeout counter. Once, I was helped I was told that my order was not ready yet. Really?!? My order said it was going to be ready at 7:45 and it was now 8:05. After waiting another 10 minutes my burger was finally ready. Got home and my burger that I ordered well done was raw!!! Tried to call to talk to a manager and was put on hold for 7 min. Tried calling again and was told the manager was to busy. Well, I guess they are to busy for my business."
Catrina T.,"San Jose, CA",4,9,1,5.0,4/25/2015,I absolutely love this one specifically! I've been to this location twice and both times I had an amazing experience. They're super quick and fast and I love coming here. It's very spacious on the inside and the food is AMAZING! The waiters are always friendly and warming. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to!
Ashley D.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,7,,2.0,12/29/2015,Ordered take out online at 5 pm to pick up at 630 pm. Arrived early and waited at the bar until our order was ready. Finally at 7 pm it was. Before leaving we checked the bag to find one of our entrees was missing. Thankfully we were still in the parking and could run back in but you would think having 2 hours to prepare our order it would be right. I understand this was a busy time but spending $50 on take out my expectations were higher.
Julian H.,"San Jose, CA",287,66,12,2.0,10/18/2014,"Oh BJ's why you do me like that? BJ's is one of those iconic places you drive by and remember having a pazookie or a small dinner and some beer. I don't typically think poorly about BJ's but the other night's experience was just a tad lack-luster. Parking around here  is really what you'd expect from a busy plaza next to a busy Target and other restaurants. You might get lucky and grab a spot up front or you might find a place a bit further back, but it's still nothing to REALLY complain about. I will give them props for a good busy location however.  Workers here are pretty hit or miss in terms of quality. The front desk/hostesses were extremely nice and friendly. We were expecting 8 but had 7 and then there was some weird misunderstanding about if we actually had 9 (most of which was our group's fault so I can't blame them). The hostesses worked it out quickly and put us in a great spot near the window. Our waiter however was a bit awkward. I asked him if they had any seasonal beers which he explained and  when I told him ""Oh, no thanks, they don't sound that appealing,"" he waited for me to order a different beer. I guess he really wanted me to buy some beer. Anyway he was awkward in the sense that it seemed like he expected us to order more but we couldn't be bothered if there wasn't anything there we wanted. The same thing happened when we ordered our food. He sort of just waited there even after we said, ""I think that's it for now. Thanks."" The weird thing was even though he seemed so ""helpful"" it was like a 20 minute gap between my empty waters till he noticed that I was waving at him. Definitely a lack-luster experience. The food at this BJ's is just like the other ones, and for the most part I probably could have made the same thing at home. The pazookies were pretty normal but by the time we finished them people were dying of sugar overloads.  Overall, this BJ's is just... well, another BJ's and isn't anything particularly special. I'd definitely try it again and hope for a better experience but going on this past experience the other night I'd give it a whole 2-stars."
Amanda O.,"Saratoga, CA",0,11,7,1.0,7/26/2016,"I usually like BJs, but I have now had two bad experiences at this one.  One day I went for lunch with my husband and just found the food subpar, but since we had a gift card we went back for dinner another night.  After getting seated, it took 15 minutes for anyone to even bring us water, and throughout the night they rarely came to refill our glasses.  I ordered the roast beef dip, and the sandwich came out cold and soggy and with the wrong fries.  Also the au jus was cold and way too thick.  My poor husband ordered the pesto chicken flatbread without chicken (he's vegetarian), and they delivered it to the wrong table, so he had to sit there while I ate.  Then they brought his out, but with chicken on it!  Eventually they brought him another (try #3), packed to go at this point, and when we got home, we found a piece of bacon on it!  And bacon isn't even a listed ingredient for the pizza!  Luckily, the manager did not make us pay for our meal, but we definitely won't be coming back."
Maureen K.,"San Jose, CA",7,22,8,3.0,9/3/2014,"Came here for lunch today. Six of us walked in at 11:13pm. I was hungry. No one else in line. We get a vacuous stare from the employee at the podium and NO ONE of the other three employees buzzing around will look at us. Finally someone does and she goes off to set up a table and it takes her over ten minutes to put two tables together and find the place settings.  We were seated at 11:29. It turns out that we were in her section. She disappears for ten minutes but comes back very bubbly. She wants to take our food order at the same time as the drink order as obviously we have had enough time while she was gone to make a decision of what to eat for lunch.  They have a very extensive selection of food. I got a lunch special. I liked mine. It came with half a flatbread pizza and a green salad with all veggies. The other five peoples reaction to the food ranged from a shrugged shoulder to ""meh"" to "" it was ok/good"" to ""I liked it!""  I guess if you have what you want to eat instead of picking something in a hurry then it tastes better.  We had a birthday and got a freshly made cookie with ice cream. It was devoured quickly.   The service after we sat down was very good. The dishes were brought out timely and quickly cleared. We finished about 12:25 and there was quite a wait to be seated when we left. The Vacuous One was still there looking as though nothing was ""her job"".  I saw no host/ess leading patrons to any tables and we had quite a walk from our table to the front and saw many empty tables. It was crowded and disorganized in the front and again, no one looked like they knew what was going on.  I would suggest Management train staff that most clients want to be seated quickly. A good start to the dining experience encourages a larger tip. Secondly, look and act competent. This means knowing how much time it will take to seat guests, where the other staff is in relation to getting a table set up and being able to communicate with the guests, AND being able to process seating requests quickly. Then, training on not having the guests wait for the server to acknowledge them and NOT expecting that leaving them alone guarantees they will make a decision as to their meal.  It makes them cranky and makes them think of walking out. I might go back..but probably not for a while. I will take my business lunch dates to Chili's where they know what they're doing"
Carlos P.,"San Jose, CA",68,1,1,1.0,6/19/2014,"So I went to BJ'S for lunch today because I had never been, had someone waiting for me there who I asked to order something to munch on so that I would have something to eat when I arrive. I show up 10 minutes later and my friend still has not been helped. We sit there for another 5 minutes before someone arrives to help us. The server shows no enthusiasm and does not make me feel welcome at all. My friend and I look at each other get up and walk out. Maybe I will give them another chance but the first impression was a poor one."
Tiffany A.,"San Jose, CA",251,35,28,1.0,10/13/2015,"Went on a Friday night to celebrate my Birthday with 7 guests. Booked my table way in advance earlier the week of. Still had to wait 20 min to be seated. Started out well with our server Carlos. Once we got half of our entrees served, we asked for silverware. 15 min later served the other half of entrees and still no silverware. Food starts to get cold from first half. After he brings us everything, he is then no where to be found after over an hour. I go to the bathroom midway and see our server at the hostess booth just having a grand ol time fooling around. Back to the table and all of a sudden a new waitress comes by and gives us our Check and doesn't even let us know she is taking over. Carlos didn't even let us know. He just up and left pretty much!!! New waitress Hailey was super rude and confusing about splitting the check. It was a complicated 20 or so minutes. We then order dessert (don't even know why she gave us the check so fast to begin with...they just wanted us out seems like) I know it was my birthday and it would've been cool to have a candle on my pizookie lol but I guess that's alright? :/ meh...the whole experience with our waiters just killed the vibe of our dinner. Called the manager over to express our complaints and he managed to cut some of our bill. Then all of a sudden Carlos magically appeared and took care of our bill!  WTH! He was still in the building! Worst BJ'S experience ever! You guys give the restaurant chain a horrible name!! We got here at 8pm and didn't leave til midnight! Awful experience from BJ's. Keep a better check on your employees."
Bay F.,"San Jose, CA",0,45,,2.0,7/4/2014,"I feel bad for the servers who actually do their job here (as opposed to those who stand around, for whom I have no sympathy).  Our server last night was overworked but I have to imagine she could've been supported by at least one of the four others I saw standing around.  Alas, she wasn't.  So it took about 20 minutes to have our ice water request fulfilled.  Our wedge salad came with onions, despite our request to leave them off. Our son's kid's deep dish cheese pizza amounted to cheese bread.  Our BJ's Supreme deep dish was better, although if you want good deep dish pizza, I wouldn't recommend theirs.  The pizzookie was great, as usual. We'll come back, but I hope when we do, they have their service act together a bit more."
Jacob T.,"San Jose, CA",17,29,,2.0,5/16/2014,"as has been noted by many other reviews, this place is an operational disaster. service is a bogged down nightmare. do not attempt to have a quick meal here. not happening.  now, if you feel like coming at 3PM on a thursday, having a beer and a pizookie, that'll probably work for you, but i've been a few times for lunch, and they just can't handle it.  food is chain food. it's fine, and the lunch specials are a pretty good deal, though 3 and a quarter for a soft drink is madness."
Joshua P.,"San Jose, CA",36,6,,1.0,5/25/2014,Forgot sauce on first pizza. They remade it and forgot a topping and dough was raw. Will not return.
Annabell A.,"San Jose, CA",71,12,3,2.0,3/2/2015,"I attend for the First Time on friday night 02/27/15 and I was Not impressed with the Service given by the waiters.  The Hostess and front desk assistance was very professional and pleasant thye stated about a 25 min wait time and they sat us a bit sooner that part was Excellent. Once we were seated we sat and waited and waited and the Waiters and Waitresses kept going past us and  Nothing .... we waited a few more mins and still Nothing... So I politely went up to front Hostess desk and Complained that I had been Patienly for almost 15 mins. and still no sigh of a Waiter, No Silver ware, No Water, Not even any type of Eye contact.   When I was complaining a very Nice Well manner Waiter from another section (I forgot to ask his name) came to us and served us and place our order and he apologized for the unattented service from the waiter. He stated that the waiter was on his break or attending another table.  I think his name was Josh which he never showed up.  After our food was ready  Bernardo served us and was very Polite and Attentive.  Bernardo did an Excellant job picking up the slack of the other waiter. Food rating Was very Good and plates and food items nice and Hot and portions were well portioned. I might try one more time to see if I get better luck next time, still debating."
Hazel L.,"San Jose, CA",219,28,38,2.0,4/25/2014,"This BJ's definitely lives up to their two-star rating! && I'm actually being a bit generous giving them two stars.. Food = decent. BUT WHY TWO STARS?! Because the service at this location sucks ass. If you want to make a reservation here, THINK OTHERWISE. I called Wednesday 4/23/14 to make a reservation and this girl answered. I told her my reason why I was calling & she put me on HOLD so she could get her manager to talk to me and set the reservation. I WAS ON HOLD FOR 15 MINUTES! Eventually my patience ran out & I decided to drive and make the reservation FACE-TO-FACE with the manager. I arrive to BJ's tell the hostess that I would like to set a reservation for my party consisting of 40 people & she had the nerve to say, ""Oh to make a reservation, you could have simply gave us a call and we'd be glad to help you.."" LIAR, I mean she only put me on hold for like 15 minutes right ?! GIRL BYE. ANYWAYS, so I speak with the manager Diana as she attempts to help me make a reservation. I asked her about the times that are available to accommodate 40 people since the Warriors/Sharks had a game that day too. She told me 9:30PM.. I was unsure myself if that was gonna be a good time  to reserve, BUT I took a risk and told her to put my name down as a reservation for 9:30PM/40 people party. I seen her write the reservation down on her reservation paper & I told her before I left ""IF MORE OR LESS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ATTEND, I WILL GIVE YOU A CALL""..  **DAY OF THE EVENT** My party of 40 and I arrive the day of the event around 9:20ish & tell the hostess that I have a reservation under my name for 40 people. With a confused look on her face she tells me ""No, we have a reservation down for 30 people.."" && I was thinking maybe there had to be a last minute change with the reservation, so the hostess just tells me and my party to take a seat and wait a few minutes.. We're waiting and waiting and waiting.. Another BIG group of people enter through and say they had a reservation at 9PM for 30 people. I'm here like WTF is going on.. We've waited almost an HOUR && that's when the Hostess tells us that there has been a mix up with reservations & they thought we were part of the other big party whose reservation was at 9PM. I tell the hostess that I set a reservation with Diana the day before & when they check their system my name doesn't pop up... A FEW MINUTES LATER WE FIND OUT THAT DIANA NEVER SET A RESERVATION FOR ME. Supposedly there was a miscommunication that I didn't tell her clearly I wanted a reservation, when I clearly MADE one the previous day stating to put my name down for 9:30PM. Instead of acting as a manager and apologizing for her mistake she was just ignoring me and trying to avoid eye contact. Some manager huh??? I had to restrain my rachetness and make sure I didn't go off on this manager.. BUT.. THANKFULLY one of the hostess.. I forgot her name, but she looked Latin, had braces, and had long curly hair came to the RESCUE! All she told me to do was count the amount of people in my party who were actually there and told me to WAIT A FEW MORE MINUTES. We were seated around 1050/55PM.. At that time PEOPLE WERE GETTING HANGRY, especially since the Warriors/Sharks lost that day too.. Usually for a big party of 25+ they have a set menu called ""Pizza Pairings"" where the people in the party pay per person if they want Pizza (12.95/person), Pizza/Salad(13.95/person), or Pizza/Salad/Pasta (14.95).. We ended up not ordering from that and just ordered from the regular menu. To serve my big ass party, I give the waitresses that served us KUDOS because they were on top of their game! They were efficient with the getting our drink/food orders and they always came back to make sure we were doing fine and letting us know when our food was ready.  As much as my guests and I were annoyed from the manager's mistake for my reservation, I definitely am grateful for the hostess and waitresses that made the event work out perfectly!"
Emily L.,"San Jose, CA",4,80,57,3.0,10/28/2014,Service was kinda slow ... But then it was the giants game. and they switch servers on us. So we ended up with 2 orders of everything. But why do people come here? For pazookies! I don't like Oreos cuz they're super sweet but those Oreo pazookies was pretty good. The cold ice cream and warm giant cookie just work for me. And their HH buffalo wings are good. Not too saucy and very crispy.
John T.,"Fremont, CA",2,51,,3.0,1/5/2015,"Ate here today for dinner after work while waiting for traffic to die down.  Being a Monday, it wasn't busy so there was practically no wait for a table (not on the bar side).  When we were seated, our server came by in a timely manner and got us our drinks.  When ordering, I got a stuffed potato with a house salad.  The house salad didn't come out with my potato, but when our server came by to check on us, she brought it out right away, so no big deal.  The food was good and our server was friendly, so maybe 3.5 stars."
David C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/17/2015,"The cook doesn't know the difference between a steak cooked "" medium""  or "" well"" . I ordered medium and it came well done! My wife is too nice to send it back and I'm out all the money for a burnt steak.  Don't order steak at this restaurant!"
Deanna D.,"San Jose, CA",4,5,1,1.0,5/1/2014,"There lucky they got any stars and I'm very nice, the customer service here is very sad!!! They treat everything like it's an inconvenience to them as waters and waitresses and EVERYTHING (even water) takes 10 minutes to get to your table. The staff have their own personal agendas and they aren't professional at all. I like bjs but they are already over prices and I have no time or patience to ever sit in this restaurant  again. WORST BJS EVER!!!"
Adam H.,"Rochester, MN",24,36,33,5.0,3/5/2015,Awesome soup sandwich and hang over cure. Great taps but can be extremely busy at lunch so not a quick leave work stop for a sandwich.
