L F.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,4,1.0,11/14/2014,The Friday afternoon bartender does not want to be there.  She has a constant scowl on her mug and is fairly rude. The service is VERY SLOW!!!
Amber B.,"Castro Valley, CA",2,65,,5.0,10/12/2014,"OMG this was the best meal I've had in ages! The parmesan crusted chicken was so divine I could not get enough of it! I loved every single bite. Great service- sorry I didn't catch the servers name. Fun atmosphere, I will certainly be back soon for more chicken!!"
Vivian L.,"San Jose, CA",50,5,3,1.0,4/18/2014,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would do so in a heartbeat.  I was so excited to hear that  BJ's was opening up near my area since I die for their avocado rolls. SO DAMN GOOD. Went to this location TWICE and hey always ran out of it. Seriously? But that was not the most annoying part. My friends and I came here on another night and ordered rounds and rounds of appetizers and drinks. I could tell that they were getting a little irritated since they came by multiple times and asked if we were ready to order from the dinner menu, but we clearly told them that we were mainly going to get appetizers and drinks. Then, my boyfriend heard some of the waitresses BEHIND our table talking about us. They were saying things like ""Oh, why are they even here if they aren't going to order anything? They're taking up so much room."" First of all, there were absolutely NO other customers waiting to be seated. And secondly, our bill still came out to be over a fucking hundred dollars. OVER 100 and you're still complaining? They're lucky we even tipped them in the first place. I would have wanted to talk to their manager, but I didn't even know they were saying things about us until after we left the place.  If you want extremely shitty customer service, go to this location."
Kent J.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",0,5,7,1.0,6/25/2014,"I didn't leave the parking lot before writing this review. We got the wrong order, wrong drinks, left hanging waiting for a rude manager to hit us with a go F--k yourself attitude when we complained about the time resolve the problem.  Go ssomeplace else is my recommendation."
A Allen G.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/19/2015,"Horrible food, terrible service. I have a stomach ache after eating. Waitress lied about happy hour. How can you have old and rancid lettuce in a salad?? Really? Waitress had an attitude and only gave excuses, didn't apologize. Not worth the wait or money. Will not be returning to this restaurant."
Lady B.,"Santa Clara, CA",37,7,5,1.0,9/16/2015,"Horrible customer service! Visited this particular BJ's twice within 24 hours and both times horrible customer service! Hostess' from last night told me Happy Hour is only served in the bar area, but the bar area was packed! So you're telling me I can't get Happy Hour in the regular sitting area if you don't have any seating accommodations for me in the bar area?? LOL I asked the waiter later as I squeezed myself into seating in the bar area and he of course, told me he could honor happy hour in the regular searing area so I no longer had to rub elbows with the strangers next to me. THEN the next waiter was super rude, again no customer service and no smile. Not once. Then today, Miss Waitress stated she couldn't split the check for a party of 12. No, you're lazy! Lazy like the rest of your teammates. You guys need to increase the level of customer service and decrease the level of laziness. Maybe take a look at Starbucks policies on customer service. I'm sure it's a reflection of management in this particular location. Prime area location and your management team is not taking advantage of the given large customer base! Your people need training or clean house if they've been there too long. Your workers lack initiative and passion. You need to hire leader minded employees, not people who just want to clock in and out. Good luck!"
Justin P.,"San Jose, CA",71,5,,1.0,5/28/2014,No stars.... I've never done review for a restaraunt before... Staff seems like they're still in highschool. No customer service at all. Went with my family. Better off going to the oakridge mall location.
Erika H.,"Hayward, CA",1,4,1,2.0,1/1/2014,On average the servers here are questionable and don't know the menu. Most of the bartenders are great. One girl just looks like it's her job to hang out. I have seen her on more than one occasion just talking to a select few bar customers. This is a problem because almost everyone feels ignored. I also don't feel safe with all of that booze on the wall. If there is an earthquake every bartended is getting at least getting cut up by falling bottles. The kitchen usually sucks and usually messes up something I've ordered.
Kendra P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",44,7,1,1.0,9/5/2014,"This place has horrible service. We came in just wanting some drinks and appetizers. The waiter came to get our drink order and appetizer order. 15-20 minutes later we never even got our drinks. We then watched our food being given to another table and them accepting it! We ended up walking out and are not coming back!! The best part was, two managers were sitting next to us talking and didn't step in and help out!  BJ's you need to improve your service of both your employees and managers if you want to stay open!! TERRIBLE."
Brittany Jo R.,"San Jose, CA",88,6,3,1.0,8/31/2015,"If I could give this Bj's zero stars I would. This place is terrible. I have given this particular BJ's at least 4 sit down chances and 1 door dash chance. The servers aren't the issue. The issue is the kitchen staff. THEY DO NOT PAY ATTENTION. I have received multiple under cooked baked potatoes, I ask for no onions on my food for my family  and it was covered in onions. i am unsure if they don't care, don't understand, or simply don't give two shits. ** excuse my language** I have had decent servers at this location and some that are absolutely awful. My family and I gave this BJ's a try with door dash ( this review is on the BJ's only NOT door dash)  We ordered our meals according to our specifications and everyones meal was WRONG! I also found HAIRS not just a hair but HAIRS in my food!! GROSS!!! I wish that I could give this place more credit but if I am paying 60 dollars for dinner I want to eat the food I purchase. It is a waste of time and money when I should have simply cooked at home. I will NEVER visit this BJ's ever again in person, or take away. The owners and management team really should take a look into their kitchen staff and  over all restaurant staff. This establishment is awful. If they aren't careful someone could get extremely sick from the lack of personal hygiene and cleanliness."
Tori C.,"San Jose, CA",67,65,95,4.0,7/16/2014,"Good food, usually good / decent service,  great beer selection (if u like beer), nice ambience."
Kevin N.,"Milpitas, CA",144,9,4,1.0,4/29/2014,"When my friends said there was a BJs on Coleman, I was surprised. So I checked it out on here and I was shocked to see it had a two star rating, and after eating here, I'm not surprised.  We arrived at around 10 pm on a Monday, mostly empty in the dining area and moderately busy at the bar. We had a party of 10 so we had to wait for a table that could accommodate. When it was ready, our hostess rudely let us know with a ""'Kay, your table is ready"" and didn't even take us to the table; she just pointed to a table in the back that was barely big enough to accommodate us so we asked a different person if we could add another table, which we did. Our server was just as bad; she was inattentive and lacked urgency, that is until she realized she new one of our friends. She then continued to chat it up with him instead of helping us out. It took a while for us to order food and the food took just as long to come out as well, both meal and dessert, and drinks were left empty for long periods of time. A few of us were sharing food and our server was supposed to bring out plates, but that never happened as well. Our food was pretty good considering it's a chain but I was a little disappointed on the portion size of my parm chicken. Needless to say I won't be coming back, at least to this location"
Ray R.,"Eatonton, GA",4,5,,1.0,9/18/2014,"The food is decent and the price is right but the service is TERRIBLE. Seriously, don't go here unless you have 2 hours to burn because that is how long it will take to get your food."
Iman B.,"East Lansing, MI",148,63,11,5.0,7/17/2014,"We were 6 people and we got avocado roll which was great and two medium pizzas. the pizza was really good and I suggest you if you wanna try some hood pizzas, ho there."
Shawn O.,"San Jose, CA",75,17,3,1.0,7/28/2014,"Not a good night for us. We waited 40 minutes for our entree. Found our waiter as he hadn't even returned to fill our water or ice tea. He said ""let me check"". Come back and said one entree was burnt and they needed to cook a new one. Asked him how long. He said 5 minutes. After 15 minutes a manager approached to ask if we were stilling waiting for one entree. Said ""no waiting for two"". We told the manager we were done and leaving. Total time spent 60 minutes. Walked next door to panera bread. All done in 20 minutes."
Abby C.,"Redmond, WA",15,92,38,2.0,7/14/2014,"What happened to BJ's? The service is awful, I mean at least act like you care. The food has gone way down hill. Portions are smaller, which is ok, but prices didn't change. My burger was a waste of money. Over cooked, cheese only on 1/2, no lettuce, and cold fries. No thanks, you can probably get better at a fast food joint. 2 dinners, 1 beer, 1 orange cream soda, pizooki-$60??? No thanks, I won't be back."
Luis B.,"Castro Valley, CA",123,135,159,1.0,7/4/2015,Food is great like always but tonight I go into the restroom and it's a mess I use crutches. I felt good enough to not use my wheelchair. While I go in to the gentlemen restroom what u know i slip and fall down. Yup right down. It hurt made my leg hurt more then usual. So I try to use the restroom while keeping stable on my crutches I make it to the toilet nope can't use those it's a mess paper towels on the floor water like a wet dog just shock off the excess water. Well I just decide to hold it and try to get out without falling again. I try to wash my hands well no paper towels that explains all the wet floors. Now my leg and back hurt this sucks came to relax now I leave in pain. Well I get out and try to get someone to clean the restroom. Well passed by 3 people until a guy asks have u been helped well he heard the bathroom is a mess but not that I fell or am I okay. Just walked off to tell someone about the bathroom.
Richard B.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/24/2014,The service was horrible here!!! I would not recommend this restaurant  to anybody. The waiter was very rude and very gay; it seemed to me as if he still had a dick in his ass!!! On top of all this I wanted to get a puzuki and the waiter didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything he just gave us a check and treated us as if we were dirty minorities!!! I'm boycotting BJs who's with me
Lexy H.,"Millbrae, CA",2,35,34,3.0,7/20/2014,Service was good- food was cold- lettuce tasted like wet rag and the cooks got the order wrong.  I eat at BJs all the time. I don't understand why the good here was so bad. It's a Sunday but still. I don't feel that what I had was worth $30!!
Gary C.,"Brentwood, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/31/2016,"We had to have a good burger on Memorial Day and our first choices were closed. Had been to BJs on Coleman back during the Xmas holidays (because they were open) with a terrible service experience, but decided to give them another try (again they were open).  We were immediately seated as it was less than 25% full at 1:00 PM.  It took over 15 minutes for just the first server contact.  The server finally came to the table obviously harried from an apparent short staffing situation (same issue as last time).  Said she sorry for the delay; she was really busy.  They were shorted handed (more a complaint than an apology). I responded we were really hungry.  We were disappointed to hear they didn't have garlic fries.  The food came a bit slowly with an oversight in requested condiments that took too long to remedy (flagged down another server).  The burgers were OK, but not great.  We had to flag down our server after 2 empty drink glasses sat at the edge of the table for about 10 minutes.  In summary the food was OK, but the service (or lack of adequate servers) was the very poor.  We don't think the Coleman BJs will get a third chance any time soon."
