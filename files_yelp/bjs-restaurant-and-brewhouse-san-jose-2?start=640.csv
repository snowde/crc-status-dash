Jason Rommel R.,"Morgan Hill, CA",12,2,,3.0,9/3/2014,"It's a BJ's...same menu, same food, same drinks...stars for a chain like BJ's i base on service...been a good patron for my local games in the Bay Area...and have had not troubles outside of today at any other BJ's..but went to the bathroom first time (with a clean 59fitted hat still on the table) to have the table cleaned andy Hopstorm (which is is a legit IPA for the price/flavor)...in my mind, thought honest mistake, due to my team losing...had a beer after to cope with the loss and put in another b/c of the ""September countdown""..hit the bathroom again WITH COASTER ON MY BEER....and gets cleared off...apparently midstream, as i suppose it is a team rule at this location...all said and done...flip a coin in prime hours..."
Diane H.,"San Jose, CA",22,79,12,2.0,6/25/2014,Bad service and bad food.  The place seems very disorganized.  I went for dinner on a Tuesday evening and they had trouble figuring out where to seat us.  When I ordered it took quite a while to get my salad which came out missing half of the ingredients.  It's a TGIF type of place with the menus a size of a book.  There's no way the food can be fresh or tasty with that many items to choose from.  The experience was a let down and a waste of money.
Loni N.,"San Jose, CA",9,46,9,3.0,6/18/2014,Yummy ahi poke. They got a good selection of appetizer and dessert. That's what I come here for.  Service is getting better since they settled in a bit now. Lunch specials for 5.95. Haven't been here for lunch yet. Just sticking to what I like.
Wendy L.,"Sacramento, CA",2,18,3,4.0,6/18/2014,"Super thrill to get a free pizookie on 6/17/14 plus $5 off the bill for dL app n registering. Utilized the app to place myself on the waitlist. When we arrived, we were told the app is useless n wait time starts the moment we arrive. Was pissed off cuz we could've gone somewhere else to dine if we knew we have to wait longer than expected. Luckily, the wait was not that bad, maybe about 25 min? We used the app to place order ahead. Food arrived fairly quickly after we were seated. however, the salad that was ordered was missing 2 main ingredient. The cook should've said the dish was sold out instead of trying to cheat the customer. Our waiter offer to not charge us for the dish!! Great customer service!!! Thank u!!"
Melanie H.,"Redwood City, CA",172,18,3,1.0,7/11/2015,"Decided to eat here after graduation. When I saw the poor reviews I should've known better. Service was slow, and heaven forbid you want to see a manger because I swear they hide in their office to avoid customers! We placed our order and our waiter forgot the kids pizza. He looked surprised when I asked where it was, although he only gave us 4 plates for pizza for our party of 5! He placed the order, then came back and said he had written it on the back. Ok, at least he acknowledged, but when a server messes up, my experience has been they offer a free dessert or even give you the kids meal for free. I mean, how do you forget the kids meal? Because my son had to wait 15 minutes for his meal, he ended up eating some of ours and no longer hungry when his meal finally came out. Service, in general, was below par. Had to continually ask for refills, and even though it was graduation day, there were only a handful of graduates and families there; it definitely was no packed for lunch! After we paid, I thought I would see the manager. Nope, the manager took over 10 minutes to come out, at which point we left. We had enough of poor service. If a manager makes guests wait that long to talk to, it's no wonder why the servers care less about providing excellent service. Too bad. Good food, horrible service, and his tip reflected it! Consider this your tip - pay more attention to your guests and what they ordered!"
Dave H.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,1,2.0,3/7/2016,"We met friends last Saturday night for a bite before the Sharks hockey game.  We arrived first at 4:30 PM ahead of a 5:00 PM dinner spot so I went up to the check-in desk and spoke with a tall thin dark haired young man with black rimmed glasses.  I told him that we were meeting a couple and I wanted to see if they had arrived first.  I said that the reservations would be under the wife's name 'Jane Doe'.  He seemed rather put off but replied 'she's not here yet'.  OK...no problem...we'll just wait. for them to arrive.  They have a bit of a challenge because Jane's husband is disabled and uses a high tech electric wheel chair and we expected them to be running a bit late as it was pouring rain.  They arrived at about 5:10 PM so I went back over to the tall thin guy with dark hair and glasses and told him that our party was now here and we'd like to be seated.  He then said that he would put us on the list (huh?!?).  I then said that I had originally asked him about the reservation for 'Jane Doe' and he said 'we don't take reservations' (duh! why didn't you tell me that at 4:30PM and then put me on the list then?).  Apparently, they don't like seniors at BJ's is all we can figure out since then they proceeded to make us wait until 5:45 PM when a table way back by the kitchen opened up and they could stash the old gray haired couples back there with the guy in the wheel chair.  We explained to the waiter that we were on a tight schedule and could they bring the order (soup since there was so little time until the game) for my wife and I out right away.  At 6:15 PM our soup still had not arrived so my wife and I had to go (she had to open up a business suite at the SAP arena for clients) and left Jane and John there to eat alone.  They were kind enough to get our soup to go and then met us later at the arena to give it to us so we didn't go hungry ;-).  The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is that they actually gave us metal spoons with the to-go order of soup since they had no plastic ones...  We probably won't be back (unless it's to drop off their spoons whenever we are in the area)."
Teddy D.,"San Jose, CA",2,28,1,1.0,6/5/2015,"I've been here on several occasions thinking ""surely it'll be better than last time."" But each time I come I am disappointed with the service and cleanliness of our table. To avoid these elements I have tried ordering out from here, only to find that the portions we were provided were a lot less than what I would have expected. Avoid!!"
Ervi L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",18,152,81,5.0,5/22/2014,"Great place! Great staff! First time here. Didn't want to come here because of the bad reviews. But, after revisiting the Yelp page recently, I decided to try it out with my girlfriend. Glad we did! Our server was Shelby. She was so patient and nice. I hadn't seen my girlfriend for 3 months, so we kept talking non-stop. I felt bad for ignoring Shelby and kept asking for more time to decide what we were going to order. Sorry, Shelby (if you are reading).  So, the food was really good. We ordered the fried calamari, Moroccan salmon, and Cherry Glazed Chipotle salmon. We both shared our food (like most girlfriends do) :) We both liked the Moroccan salmon more than the Chipotle salmon. The Moroccan salmon has a crunch to it while the other one doesn't. Since it's cherry glazed, it's sweet. So, it wasn't our favorite. Though the fried calamari portion is rather small, it's pretty good.  I also ordered the Orange Twist drink. It's a little too sweet for me, but it's orange-y. I like it :) Our order came out pretty quick. It was super crowded when we went there around 7:30pm on Thursday. But, the wait was not too long. About 30 minutes to get a table.  I will definitely go back again!"
Kathryn W.,"Gilroy, CA",52,5,9,5.0,3/17/2014,Angelina was our waitress and everything she recommended was awesome. Love the grilled chicken pasta and she suggested adding Cajun seasoning which was excellent!  I added extra broccoli too. Yum!!
Allison R.,"Santa Clara, CA",49,161,52,1.0,2/24/2014,"I've been to many BJ's locations, and am typically a big fan (as far as big chain restaurants go anyway). This was my first visit to this location, because I was meeting my parents for dinner before they were going to the airport nearby. Let's just say, I will not be recommending this location to anyone based on our service experience. I'm not sure if our server was new, or maybe he was having an off night, but regardless of the reason, we didn't leave very happy. First tip something was off, my mom asked him if they had brown rice that she could substitute for white rice. He looked at her funny and then said ""oh ya, we've got rice pilaf that is kinda brown..."" Ummmm, seriously? This guy didn't know what brown rice was.  Then, I ordered a gluten free pizza with Italian sausage, fire roasted red bell peppers, and basil. The server asked me ""oh, so you want me to bring you a side of those hot pepper flakes?"" That's what he thought fire roasted red bell peppers were (which is an item listed right on the menu). I explained to him what I meant (even pointing to the item on the menu), and he seemed to understand.  After we all finished ordering, my mom said ""Wow, impressive! He didn't write any of that down."" I made the comment to her that we'd have to see how impressive it actually is once we get our orders. Sure enough, my pizza was wrong. My pizza had green bell peppers, and no basil (which I don't fault the server for too much, for some reason the basil is missing almost every single time I order pizza from any BJ's location). I was going to just eat the pizza I was given because I'm not that picky, but my mom was not happy. Besides, she is right; we should get the meal we order when we're paying customers. When I told the server my order was wrong because there were green bell peppers, not the fire roasted red bell peppers I ordered, and it was missing basil, his response to me was ""those are the only bell peppers we have"". I explained to him that I order this exact same pizza every time I come to BJ's (which is a true statement, I have been getting that same combo for years at various locations), and the fire roasted red bell peppers is an item listed on the menu. He was also defensive about the basil and said he put that on the order. Like I said earlier, the basil is often forgotten, and I know he didn't MAKE the pizza, but he should've checked to make sure it was correct before bringing it out. He took the pizza and said he'd go check. Sure enough, he came back and said I was right, they do have fire roasted red bell peppers. He did apologize for his mistake, and offered me a free gluten free Pizookie or a free salad so that I didn't have to sit there without food while my new pizza was being made. I didn't really want either, but he was still holding the wrongly-made pizza, so I asked if I could just have that one to go instead. He said that was ok, and brought it back to me in a box.  I got my correct pizza (basil and all) a little while later and it was piping hot, fresh out of the oven & it was delicious.  When the server brought the check over, he apologized for the delay and said he had to have his manager take off the charge for the second pizza...good thing he did that before he brought it to us or he would have gotten quite an earful from my mom... It was very nice that he allowed me to take the incorrect pizza order to-go after I didn't want either of the choices he offered to make up for his mistake. But, it doesn't really make up for the fact that he wasn't knowledgeable about the menu (or even food for that matter...rice pilaf is NOT the same as brown rice buddy). I'll stick to other BJ locations in the future."
Jefferson T.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/18/2015,"Wanted to sit next to the Baseball playoff game which was on only one TV.  Despite asking nicely 3 times and despite there being ample available seats, we were not allowed to sit in the area.  ?????  We left and watched the game at Rock Bottom Brewery in the pruneyard where we were allowed to sit where ever we wanted."
Sara J.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/16/2013,"Yuck!  OK, I have never been to a BJs before, and this one opened up nearby so I decided to give it a try. I walked in and my first impression: its like a glorified Burger King but with booze instead of kids. I check the menu, and hey: Calamari (squid). And I love calamari, so I asked the manager if it was really calamari, little fried squid and he assured me it was. OK, I ordered. Then they tell me it will take about 15 minutes. What? That's like saying it will take 15 minutes to fry french fries. Why would it take so long. Answer: I guess they had to go outside and find some dried twigs (I'm kidding but in a moment you'll understand the ""joke"").  Finally, they bring it out, and, there are only 4 little shriveled up little squids about the size of a quarter, and the rest is gristle and chucks of breaded bread saturated in grease, and some thin little onion-ring like things also greased and breaded. And the taste? Uggh. Disgusting.  So, of course I complain to the manger. ""Hey, there are only four little squids in this calamari order, the rest is little chunks of fried breaded bread and breaded twigs. This is a rip off. You sold me 50 cents worth of calamari for over $10.00 bucks."" What does the manager do? He argues. ""But that's the way it comes in the package"" he says. ""Its only supposed to have a few calamari. Its supposed to have all that extra breaded stuff.""  Me: ""Its a rip off and I want my money back."" Manager: ""I can't do that."" Bottom line: No thanks. Never again."
Wolfman R.,"Anchorage, AK",2,26,2,2.0,11/14/2014,"Wolfman come to BJ's for dinner.  Wolfman too tired to hunt and cook Wolfman's food. Wolfman come with great appetite from a long day at the office. Wolfman order appetizer before Wolfman order hamburger. Waitress did not ask what Wolfman want to drink. Wolfman try to howl for the attention that was needed to order drink. Without drink, Wolfman will die of thirst. Appetizer came 20 minutes later and drink never came after Wolfman asked twice. Food was filling but Wolfman no like service."
Julie S.,"San Jose, CA",1,37,4,2.0,9/2/2014,"I like the food which is why we came back but both times, even though we told them we are on our lunch hour, we had to wait about 45 minutes for soup and salad. The waiters and waitresses are nice but service too long."
Ryan M.,"San Jose, CA",3,12,2,2.0,10/13/2014,"I have been to a BJ's located in Dublin and had a wonderful experience.......Unfortunately, this BJ's service was much poorer. The food took forever to make it to our table, the food was not very good, and it took them quite a long time to seat our party even though they were not swamped."
Amaris D.,"San Jose, CA",179,16,3,1.0,5/17/2014,Customer service sucks. Our waitress made us feel like an inconvenience. Sorry I don't like to eat with dirty napkins no need to throw a new one at our table. Never again.
Emily K.,"Hollister, CA",0,3,1,5.0,10/8/2015,The other day I had the pleasure of having a lovely server by the name of Brianna( she had red curly hair and earrings) Serve my whole table of 4 friends. She was absolutely on point with everything and super fast to bring out our meals. This is the first yelp review I've ever written and Ive never been quick to do this but she totally deserved this review. Im definitely coming back and hopefully she'll be there to serve us again! Great job Brianna! You're amazing (:
Clark K.,"Stafford County, VA",0,78,,3.0,8/24/2014,"This was a tough review. Got here on a saturday night at 7 pm. Party of two.  Got seated pretty quickly for how busy they seemed. Ordered a delicious steak, mashed potatoes, and Brussel sprouts. Shared an artichoke appetizer with my GF who had the balsamic chicken. The food was as good as can be expected for a chain restaurant. The service was S L O W. Our waiter sucked. In fact, the people behind us took their check to the bar to pay because the waiter never came back to pick it up.  He was not attentive. So the food was decent, the prices were okay.  The service was mediocre. A lot of other chain food places to go to before going back here."
Jessica L.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,2.0,11/17/2013,"I was really looking forward to this location, but like the majority of other reviewers I am not impressed. I've been three separate times, had three different servers, and had three bad experiences. See rant below... First time we tried the call ahead list, but still waited 45 minutes once we got there. Service was okay- it was obvious she was new, but she was trying. Second time, we found an empty table in the bar right away, but our server was horrible. She was way too quiet for the loud atmosphere, didn't know anything about the food, and would ask a question but not wait for an answer- which meant we had to ask multiple times for sauces/drinks/etc- making her go back and forth, wasting even more time.  My third and final visit was the worst experience yet. Another super long wait, only to wait again at the hostess stand after our buzzer went off. This wouldn't have been an issue had there not been 5 employees just standing around behind the stand talking and not paying attention to their busy lobby. Once we FINALLY got seated, the server took forever. I'm not even talking about the food wait time, cause I know that can take awhile on a busy night, I'm talking about not even stopping by to greet us for at least 15 minutes. Then she completely forgot to bring our drinks (we had to ask the food runner who brought our salads out), and then she took another 20 minutes to bring us refills later on in the meal. It's not that hard to drop off a soda or glass of water... you can't control the kitchen, but you can at least make sure your tables aren't thirsty! I expected there to be kinks because this is a new location and there are probably a lot of new employees, but it's worse than I imagined. Their employees are unprofessional- standing in groups talking, walking in front of/cutting off guests, forgetting orders, saying inappropriate things, and just generally not paying attention. The managers really need to get their act together and start weeding out the people who don't deserve to be there. Wait time when it's busy is forgivable, but nothing else is. The reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food has been really good. My friends have also all enjoyed their meals. At least the chefs know what they're doing- though they seem to be the only ones. Looks like I'll only be ordering takeout from now on."
Will C.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/4/2014,"1 star, because 0 stars is not an option. Manuel was our server. He is the single reason we will not go back to a BJ's. We ordered appetizers and entrees, Manuel found it appropriate to bring them all out at the same time. I asked why he chose to do that, he just looked at me and walked away. How's a $.95 tip sound?  If I could take money from you I would. You suck."
