jim w.,"San Jose, CA",0,33,,1.0,9/30/2013,"This rating is only for those seeking to watch a sporting event.  This is, without question, the most poorly designed ""sports bar"" that I have even seen.  There is a central television which can be ""split"" into several smaller screens.  That is great if you get one of the four bar stools in front of the screen, or one of the tables directly behind it.  Otherwise, you are cranking your neck to view what is a rather small, low quality television screen, We waited for 15 minutes to get a seat only to sit at an angled stool for three minutes and walk out of this place and over to Chili's, which has far inferior food.  This is really unfortunate since I have been to the BJ's in Cupertino on multiple occasions and found the bar to be a great experience.  It is highly unlikely that this layout can be changed since the entire back of the bar is dedicated to showcasing multiple bottles of the liquor that is for sale. This was an absolutely dreadful experience for someone who lives within walking distance.  I will NEVER return and I discourage anyone seeking to watch a game from entering this place."
Tito C.,"Santa Clara, CA",31,9,,1.0,1/25/2015,"First off let me just say that I love this restaurant in general so this is not attack on the restaurant itself. However my experience at this one location certainly did put a sour taste in my mouth. I placed an order to go and arrived to the restaurant at closing to pick it up but they had already locked their doors. I signaled one of the waiters and even mouthed and said it out loud "" I placed an order to go and I'm here to pick it up"". The waiter continued to say sorry we're closed and pretended to ignore me and walked away. Mind you he was pretty far from the door and did not make the effort to get closer to the door to give me an explanation or anything. I continued to wait and saw him walk by again and I repeated the process of letting him know I was there to pick up the order but he did not make an effort to get close to the door and had an attitude throughout this entire time. Finally a waitress went by and let me in and I told her I'd like to speak to the manager about the situation. The manager was completely incompetent at her job when I told her what happened. She just gave me a lame apology and said that it was a matter of safety that waiters can't come close to the door. The waiter then showed up didn't really apologize when I told him how I felt he was rude and he still gave no apology. The manager didn't do anything else to reprimand him when I told her he could've explained the safety issue and that he did not show any willingness to notify me or help me while I was freezing outside being locked out. I too have worked in customer service and both these two individuals did not do anything to rectify the situation,  even the apology was half assed. All in all they need to train their employees and their management needs to be brought up to par. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT."
Jeff H.,"San Jose, CA",0,35,,2.0,5/1/2016,"Been here several times, and returned for dinner.  Don't know what happened to the customer service, but it's really gotten worse. Tonight my wife and I arrived and were seated relatively quickly, and noted others who were seated after us.  After being ignored for about 15 minutes, flagged down a waitress so we could get our order in. She brought us water - in a broken glass. 15 minutes later, they served appetizers to the trio that came in after us. Waiter replaced my broken water glass.  10 minutes later, full meal served to the trio and another couple who had arrived after us.  5 minutes later - total of 45 minutes had passed and all we had were water glasses -- we got up to leave.  At least six servers hanging around the front desk with apparently nothing to do.  Several open tables, so it wasn't particularly busy. At no time did ANYONE come by and give us an update  Please announce when you have this problem fixed and we'll consider returning."
Miryam Maria Z.,"Santa Clara, CA",33,17,,1.0,12/11/2013,I really can't understand how they advertise crispy calamari and then bring a soggy one to me.... After an ok meal I decided not to order desert just to avoid another disappointing dish.
Charlie T.,"Fernley, NV",91,10,,4.0,8/5/2014,"They had a very good selection of beer, as well as good food. Was a little pricey, but so is everywhere in san jose. I personally experienced good service, and was overall satisfied with the visit"
Esme L.,"Santa Clara, CA",123,21,13,1.0,5/21/2015,"I tried to give this place a -5. I came here in Feb for my bday. It was about an hr wait time after I called in 30 min before I arrived. That phone waitlist is usless. I came yesterday for my husband's bday and again, the exact same thing happened. We planned to come in at 7:30 since some of the children who came with us usually fall asleep by 9:30. Well, we arrived at 7:30. We were waiting to be seated for about an hr. After they seated us at 8:30, our food was served at 9:45. The kids were asleep. Horrible, horrible experience. They told us they had a party of 45 and they were priority. We tried to talk to the manager, but she also mentioned the party of 45. She was being somewhat sarcastic and didn't really offer a discount until we mentioned that the children did not eat their food becauae they fell asleep. She offered to comp those meals, but our whole night was ruined. Never coming back."
Third M.,"San Diego, CA",45,6,2,2.0,3/2/2014,"Meh...if Applebees is your American and Chili's is your Mexican then this may be your Brewery. I'm not a fan of their house beers (unrefined and nothing to em'), but they do have some regional favorites on tap. My turkey burger was a little dry, but eatable and our service was fine."
Scott N.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,,1.0,10/17/2013,"HORRIBLE service.  I understand that sometimes it takes time to properly train staff HOWEVER having a bad attitude is not something that should have to be gone over.   To start, we called ahead.  Yeah, their system (or staff) obviously have flaws.  We were told it was a 25 minute wait.  We arrived and checked in as instructed.  Upon checking in, we were told we ""still had 30 minutes to go"".  Wait, what? 30 minutes left to go on an initial quote of 25 minutes?  What was the purpose of even calling ahead?  To make the situation even worse, the marked attitude from the staff was ridiculous.  We explained the what we had been told on the phone and she replied with a completely inappropriate attitude, saying ""You have 30 minutes left to wait. "" (?)  I explained how I had to get something at Target before they closed (it was a Sunday and they closed earlier than during the week).  After being told that we could potentially have to wait an extra 30 minutes before being seated, I didn't want to risk having to rush through our meal, so we could make it to Target before they closed.  One person from the party stayed with the pager.  Literally the second I walked out the door, to run over to Target, the pager goes off.  How does a wait time go from being 30 mins to under 5 mins?  If the staff was trying to accommodate - they need to learn to not how to do so.  After getting the phone call saying the pager had gone off, while I was still in the parking lot, we decided to blow off BJ's.  I have worked in a quest service environment before.  I know how dealing with the public can be - it's not always easy.  Some guests just aren't pleasant.  This is EXACTLY why I never treat people who are assisting me poorly, unless it's deserved.  The fact that we were treated the way we were was absurd.  The ""Bon Qui Qui"" ghetto attitude needed to be checked at the door before coming to work.  These people at the podium are the first point of contact for the BJ's brand/experience.  Management should be appalled that this played out the way it did.   We were initially excited that BJ's was going on at this shopping center - it's sad that it played out as it did.  Management really needs to weed out these type of employees.  These days, there is no excuse to hire such inexperienced and worthless individuals.  It's called professionalism.  Ya may not love your job BUT people need to learn to put the damn face on - you are being paid to represent a company.  No excuse."
Charlotte D.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/13/2015,"We've been to this restaurant several times with good experiences and good food.  Unfortunately, they broke their winning streak tonight. Very slow service and very mediocre food. My Caesar salad was room temperature and limp. My calamari was also room temp when served and by the time I got to the last third of it was cold and mushy and couldn't finish it. My partner's meal of chicken was also room temp."
Kim D.,"Fairfield, CA",761,337,2691,2.0,1/12/2014,"Sigh.. If it had not been for the good service that we received from our waitress who offered to divvy up the checks for everyone and kept an eye on drinks that were low or extra napkins that were needed even when she had many other tables to attend to, I would give it just 1 star. Maybe it's because this is a newer BJ's, but everything was disorganized right from the get go. It was my friend's birthday, so she had made a reservation for 17 people a few days before since we were going to grab dinner here before heading to downtown SJ. They had even called earlier on the day of to confirm her reservation, but once we got there a few minutes before the set time, they said that they didn't have her name down for any reservation. After talking to the manager, she finally came back and said the wait would be 15-20min. Around 10min later, a different hostess comes by to tell us that our table was ready, so we all follow her and get settled at the table, only to find another large party standing behind us getting irritated because they said the hostess was supposed to seat their party instead of ours. So up we go again back to the lobby to wait for them to put together another table large enough to accompany us. Finally when they squished us all together, we ordered our food but unfortunately our appetizers came out after our entrees, and my salad took the longest and was the last entree to be served. Agh. Never again. At least my friend got her free birthday pizookie?"
Vivian T.,"San Jose, CA",71,12,25,2.0,5/15/2015,We were greeted by the hostess that was chewing gum and not once made eye contact nor smile. It was very off putting and unpleasant.  I think the entire front staff could use an upgrade!
Jen W.,"San Jose, CA",4,60,12,4.0,11/11/2013,"I can't speak to the restaurant service, I sat at the bar cuz I'm super smart like that. The service was prompt (cuz she's paid to be right there - see how smart I am), friendly, and helpful (I think the barkeeps name was Erin, but it might have been Lucinda cuz my memory's that bad). My flatbread was cooked to a nice crispy-crisp, my salad was green and salady, and my beer was cold and beery. Awesome. Thanks. See you again soon."
Eric C.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/9/2015,"I wish there was a no star option. We've given this BJs three chances and every time is a horrid experience. If I wanted to wait on myself, I'd stay home. Horrible waitresses!!"
Grant C.,"San Jose, CA",11,8,,2.0,12/3/2013,"My family and I have gone to this BJ's several times. Once when it first opened and thought the problems were just growing pains. Now after being there four times I am sorry to say there is no progress. Once seated the waitress in whose section we were seated walked by us several times. A waiter then asked if we had been contacted and took our drink orders for us. When taking our food orders he cut us off several times. This lead to issues with our order. Once the orders came out my wife's was totally wrong. The person who brought it just walked away when we said something. The waiter came back and made an excuse for the mistake. My meal, the Bison Burger, was cold when they brought it out. I rather doubt we will be going back down there again."
Louis L.,"San Jose, CA",74,7,,1.0,4/2/2014,"I've had 2 bad experiences here, enough to make want to write a review. First visit here I went with a group and everyone received their food except me. After several requests they finally brought out my burger and it was over cooked. Second experience here, I ordered take out. Apparently it goes to a Call Center and they relay the order to the restaurant. The restaurant never receives the order and they have to restart the order with a rush. I would avoid this place, service is terrible."
T G.,"San Jose, CA",0,52,6,2.0,10/11/2013,"I would give 5 stars for our server Stephanie, however the 2 stars are for the decent food. 0 stars for the service (or lack thereof, before Stephanie)  Arriving was weird. The staff were obviously not fully comfortable at this new location....awkward vibe during seating. Ok... Our server (he never said his name) came over took our order for 3 sodas, 1 beer and 2 appetizers and returned about 5 minutes later with the sodas & no beer. Said the beer would be right out. He returned 5 minutes later to take our order and still no beer (at which point I asked about it and he said it would be right out) 5 minutes later he returned with 4 plates for our apps and the beer. We then placed our order for our main dishes. Quick & easy (we have been to BJs many times before - love the one at Oakridge, HATE the one in Cupertino near Apple). 10 minutes later he returned with a stand for the pizza we ordered and it was wet and had previous pizza all over it (I seriously gagged). 5 minutes later (25 minutes after we arrived) a female server (Stephanie) came over and informed us she was taking over for the guy (he was off and had gone home). I asked her to get us a new pizza stand and when she returned with it she informed us that she was aware that our apps had been put in 20 minutes before and she would bring them out ASAP and a manager would be over to talk with us about that. I told her the manager didn't need to come over, we were happy she was taking over.  1 appetizer came out and while eating it part of my main meal order came out! Not happy:( About 5 (or more) minutes later the second appetizer came out. Rest of the meal came out pretty quickly after that. Food was good, although my daughter's pasta (she orders all the time) was under seasoned. Sodas were refilled frequently without having to ask. I ordered a 2nd beer which took at least 10 minutes (from the time I started looking at the time), so the manager (fully aware of our experience at this point) comped that one.  Stephanie was a great server trying to clean up the mess the previous guy left her. As for the time it took the 2nd beer -- I am pretty sure that was fault of the bar. We won't come back to this location. We will drive much further to Oakridge. This location will be fine because they are a big chain in a good location.  Management needs to iron out the kinks of being new and lazy staff."
Andrew R.,"San Jose, CA",193,133,45,1.0,3/24/2014,"Oh BJ's well this Coleman location, you've failed me. Came in after a soccer game and everyone was starving. Our server came over to introduce herself and first thing she said was 'I know this isn't an excuse but I have seven other tables so I might be awhile'..... Um okay. Thanks? Well she wasn't lying, we waited 20 minutes for our beer and another fifty for our food. I thought we were on a hunger strike. Our food finally came out and we were ecstatic, ready to dive in the food was cold. The worst part of the trip was closing out our check, I wanted to use their loyalty coupon for five dollars off. Closing out took another thirty, what a mistake. Super disappointed and won't be back for a while. Oh and the cellphone reception is nonexistent at this restaurant, don't expect to receive iMessages or calls when you're in here."
Donna B.,"San Jose, CA",2,27,,4.0,7/23/2014,I have been to this BJ's twice now and both experiences have been great.  First time there I had the beer samplers with a chicken ceaser salad.  Loved the sampler.  It enabled me to sample five of the beers and there was only one that I was so so on.  I adore the pzookies and had the salted carmel pretzel.  It was delicious.  The second time around I had the classic bacon cheeseburger and fries.  It completely hit the spot and was cooked perfect.  For dessert this time it was the macadamia white chocolate pzookie.....perfect
Eric M.,"Gilroy, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/10/2016,because of the waitress messing up my order here i accidentally ate a piece of pork. thats not okay. i was pretty crystal clear about what i ordered. clearly said beef. i don't like pork and i don't eat it. i asked to talk to the manager and the waitress left and came back and told me the manager was busy. even though i could clearly see him standing by the bar. i'm not coming back. the food wasn't great either. when i did get my correct order it was already cold.
Julie S.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,,1.0,2/20/2015,"This particular store has gone down hill with service. On February 15, 2015 I was there with two friends. Three to four waiters walked by us several times with no acknowledgement. After 15 minutes of being ignored, we got up and left to take our business elsewhere. I let the hostess know as we left, but she seemed to careless. Also, was there February 5, 2015 before the Eric Church concert and the service was very bad. Waiter disorganized and food not done right. I work near the restaurant, but won't be patronizing this place anytime soon. The Oakridge location has always been great so it is the management of this particular location. I will stick with Chili's for now on!"
