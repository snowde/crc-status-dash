Greg M.,"San Jose, CA",324,17,,1.0,2/8/2014,"Terrible,terrible , terrible service... Wait, how could I say that? We never got fucking served! Waited to sit for 35 minutes....then waited another hour and not a soul acknowledged that we were there! How do you walk by someone who has their hand up trying to flag you down? Fuck this dump...."
Craig K.,"Cupertino, CA",77,70,56,2.0,1/1/2014,"Better parking than Cupertino's, but the service is really, really bad. The portions are smaller, and the waitresses are rude. The food came out really late, like 45-75 minutes later after ordering. This is not based off of one experience, this is based off of 4 separate occasions. They really need to fix what they are doing."
Amy Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",162,1,,2.0,4/28/2014,I'm never getting their salads to-go again. They give you a half portion from what you would get if you were eating in and yet you pay the same price. This has happened when I've ordered to-go in multiple locations.
Paul T.,"Campbell, CA",1,30,16,1.0,11/8/2013,"BAD !!! BAD!!!! SERVICE !!!  It just seems like every single BJ's in San Jose is down right horrible . Oakridge being the worst , but I visited the one on Coleman today and I got the same horrible treatment I've gotten every single visit . Is it just that BJ's is trained just to not give two shitts about the people who walk in. I waited almost 2 hours for a table that I was told only would take 45 mins , then the service was all attitude and no smiles . Never gonna enter an other bjs after this . 3rd strike"
Rose A.,"San Jose, CA",146,24,4,5.0,11/6/2013,"First time dining at this new BJ's, Angelina was our server, it's a girls night so we've been at our table for hours. Angelina was so attentive, no pressure to order or move. She poured my wine and boxed up my food. So friendly and just a great dining experience. We'll be back for sure!"
Bailey R.,"San Jose, CA",30,33,2,1.0,12/23/2013,"This is one of those times where I feel compelled to write a review to rail against a bad restaurant. This place sucks - I just don't get the appeal. The pizza was salty and no better than the pizza at a 7-11. And then there's the $10 Margarita - this drink was so bad that even after diluting it 50% with water, it was unbearably sweet. Its as if they use a Margarita mix and the bartender put way too much of it in to my drink - he should be fired. Our waitress was really nice and the décor is trendy - maybe this is enough for people to queue up for mediocrity."
Viviane K.,"San Jose, CA",5,42,8,2.0,3/29/2014,"Disappointed with the slow service. My party of 7 was quickly seated on a Sunday night, but we were at a table with poor lighting. I had one of the pasta dishes, which was overpriced and something I could've made by myself. Felt like we had to always search for our waitress (who was really nice), but took a long time getting back to us. Should've gone to Sweet Tomatoes instead."
Jorge P.,"Milpitas, CA",4,13,12,3.0,5/17/2014,"Service-ok Food-terrible, fish was over cooked and dry. Asked for med-rare steak and got med-well.  -burger is bout the same as mcdonals new club burger. The 3rd star is honoring the 20% for using the online ordering while you wait"
D Z.,"San Francisco, CA",117,9,1,1.0,10/28/2013,"This is the worst service I have ever received at a large chain restaurant. I went on a Monday night at 8:30pm. Firstly, there were four servers gathered around the front podium and although the host greeted us, they took their time to seat us and made us wait until they were done chatting.  Secondly, the food was subpar because the ranch dressing on my house salad was watery.  Lastly, when the bill came, we were charged for four desserts that the table next to us ordered.  It baffles me that so many mistakes can be made within an hour.  No thank you BJs! Not coming back!"
Steve M.,"San Jose, CA",10,2,,1.0,6/25/2014,"Come here frequently but last two visits service at bar has been terrible. Waited 15mins before someone would come to our table. Once we ordered drinks, took another 15mins to receive them. We will know longer come to BJs"
Mark A.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,1,3.0,1/2/2015,Well they have happy hour which is great. The mojitos are hit and miss depending on which bartender you get. The hostess who seated us was very rude and had some kind of attitude. In the future would probably go to the Oakridge location.
Mary S.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,29,8,1.0,3/10/2014,"4 days of food poisoning, still going. Ruined most of my week, had to talk to the doctor, etc etc etc. Never coming here again."
Matt L.,"San Jose, CA",29,13,4,5.0,3/29/2014,"Service and food were great. Good selection of beers. The waitress was polite, and the food arrived quickly. Not too loud."
Rich H.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/11/2015,"Went for lunch and the experience was pretty poor. It took at least ten minutes for our server to come and we didn't dare let her get away without taking our full order. The food didn't take too long, but the quality was ""meh"". The bbq lunch platter was dry chicken and a tiny pulled pork sandwich. It then took a long time to get the check and the piece de resistance was their losing my credit card. I didn't have to pay...but now I have to cancel my card and get a replacement.The manager was very apologetic and I know things happen....I'm just bummed about having to do that."
Nicole M.,"Milpitas, CA",12,44,12,1.0,3/8/2014,I'm currently here in a booth with my boyfriend and we were seated as soon as we walked in but have been waiting 15 minutes so far because no one has came to take our order yet. The tables around us have both been helped by different waiters and none of them have even asked us if we have been helped. A family of 5 came in 10 minutes after us and were helped while we sit here waiting. UPDATE: We had to ask a busser to flag down someone. The waitress  didn't seem too happy as if WE were bothering HER! Pizza is ok though (we got the BJ special or whatever it's called). Definitely  not worth this horrible service.
Roqui P.,"San Jose, CA",26,71,3,1.0,10/15/2013,"Three reasons this place deserves a terrible review. First, we went here for Sunday morning football, there were 3 tables with guests but somehow it took forever for them to serve us. Second, we tried to come on an Friday evening and the place was crazy! No one was at the front desk for at least 20 min. Last, I called a week in advance for a party of 10, and they told me they had no openings till 10pm. Tried three times with either sucky service or no service. Won't be retrying this place again!!"
Marcos D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",6,28,1,5.0,4/26/2014,"Don't know why all these reviews are so bad. I had excellent service. Stacy T was our waitress, and she was wonderful. She was very attentive and prompt with everything. Food came out on time, water/beer was refilled in a timely manner. Asked about our food really did everything required of her to provide excellent service. Food was good here too chicken wings hot and crunchy, deep dish was a good choice too."
Ben C.,"San Jose, CA",4,13,,1.0,3/24/2015,"The wait for online ordering is BAD, at least when I order 45 minutes ahead and they have one--count him, one--server taking orders."
Rachael T.,"Oceanview, San Francisco, CA",100,5,,4.0,7/21/2014,"Food was great, hot, and fair priced. It was by birthday, and I had kind of a large group but my waiter was awesome! Keaton (I hope i spelled that correctly) was my waiter, he cracked jokes with us, checked on our drinks frequently and was just an overall nice person. With me personal experience, sitting outside kind of rare for outstanding service. Now I would have given 5 stars, but the hostesses are horrible! BJ's has a call ahead option, and its wonderful for a friday night, that is if they actually put you on the list. Somehow the lady didn't actually enter my party on the call ahead list, which is frustrating but okay mistakes happen. What I am pretty upset about is why these girls feel the need to have attitude with me about it. It isn't my fault that they messed up, and I didn't even give them a hard time! I also overheard several of the girls making rude remarks about other customers.  The whole front staff needs to be replaced."
Gin M.,"San Jose, CA",10,13,,1.0,2/23/2014,I tried the baby back ribs today-very bad. Super dry and worthy of 7/11 foodoids. The nutty brewnette is amazing.... Service is shite! My visits will be less frequent. I only come around because It's convenient to other shopping in strip mall.
