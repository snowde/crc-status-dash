Dustin W.,"San Francisco, CA",142,36,14,2.0,3/11/2014,"This place could've been better if the they changed a lot of things.  For one thing, the service was terrible, and the wait staff was untrained in the way that they couldn't even place the food down carefully.  One of the wait staff almost ended up spilling our dish of calamari because he placed the rectangular dish down from one end.  Second, it was hard to flag a staff member down to get a refill on my water. Lastly, when the food arrived, it was barely lukewarm.  I'm probably not going to be coming back here because of the service."
Jon C.,"San Jose, CA",98,7,,2.0,4/7/2014,Standard BJ's experience but with a longer wait time. Took us 2 hours to get a meal because of the inconsistency of servers here. 2 stars to be generous
laura m.,"San Jose, CA",36,3,,3.0,9/18/2014,"I love bjs and I have been to this one many times. I was disheartened to see so many negative service reviews. I have had spotty service before, but tonight our service has been great. Everything is prompt and our server, Alisha, is excellent."
Melissa S.,"Reisterstown, MD",4,54,1,2.0,1/10/2014,"The food is OKAY, but the service is pretty bad. After waiting 40 minutes for a table our buzzer went off. We went to the hostess station and were told it was a mistake and that our table isn't ready yet. Whatever. Our waiter was friendly enough, but he didn't put it our order right, so I received my meal and my SIL didn't. We waited another 10 minutes before hers came out. After that, our waiter was nowhere to be seen. We had to give our bill to someone else so we could pay, only to be told our waiter was the only one who could take our bill. Again, whatever. Certainly not the worst experience ever, but it doesn't make me likely to go back to this place."
Debra H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,4.0,7/10/2015,"We had a large group, eventually around 20, for happy hour drinks and apps.  They were very accommodating and provided us seating outside (nice). I explained we needed separate checks for all of us, and we had expected to just purchase our drinks and any apps from the bar. But they said they would keep a tab for us then give us separate checks at the end.  I was skeptidcal but they came through! Service was a bit slow at times, but granted they were busy and we had the large group.We were able to account for every charge on the final bill, which is really helpful with a group :-D"
Alan C.,"Fremont, CA",67,45,15,2.0,1/29/2014,"this location of BJ's is alright.  came here with a friend and we started off with so drinks before digging into our dinner. we each ordered a beer and some appetizers, but man, it took awhile to get our drinks. the place wasn't even that busy (we were there at around 530pm on a thursday). when we finally got our drinks, we decided to order. i got the balsamic glazed chicken. it was slightly below standard. the chicken was decent but the mash potatoes were a bit dry. once again, took forever to get the food. after we were done, we wanted to get the check. no server to be found.  this BJs is like any other, which are usually 3 stars. gave this one two cuz of the slow service on a non busy day."
John D.,"San Jose, CA",1,51,,1.0,3/17/2014,"I went here last Saturday for Lunch. I walked in the front door and the teenager at the front grunted something that sounded like 'hey.' as a greeting. I smiled and told him there were two of us and asked if we could sit outside. He grunted, 'sure, head that way' so we started walking toward the patio area and he said (audibly this time) 'uh, wait! I mean wait here.'  After a minute or so another teenager came up and asked us to follow her. As soon as we 'headed that way', teenager #1 grunted 'wait' again and came over to tell teenager #2 to go check with so-and-so to see if she wants more people or not. A couple of minutes later she came back, took us to the patio area and mumbled something. By this time I was fed up so instead of asking what she said, I chose a booth and sat down. She wandered off. Our waitress was polite and took our order after a few minutes. The only complaint I have about her is that she was never around when I wanted to talk to her. For example to order another beer when my first was finished.  I ordered a Cobb Salad and it came in good time but the person who brought it (not the waitress) handed it to me instead of putting it down on the table in front of me. That's the first time I have seen that one. It was almost like she was saying 'here, I don't know what to do with this, you figure it out.' The Cobb Salad looked fine but something wasn't quite right. After a few minutes I figured out that they had put the Caesar's anchovy dressing on it instead of the garlic dressing they had advertised.  By the time the waitress came back around and I mentioned it to her, she offered to make another one but it was too late since I had already eaten most of it and my mouth was coated with nasty fish taste so I had lost my appetite. The check came and it was $50 for two beers, a Cobb Salad with Anchovy Surprise, an appetizer pizza and a Root Beer. Not worth it at all. BTW I have to comment on the beer here: It is 'OK' and nothing special. The two different types I had were the IPA (flat and not very hoppy) and some kind of Scottish Ale they had on special (flat and the hops just didn't work with the malt - or maybe it was the anchovies...) I have been here before to try the beer and although I don't remember the specific ones I tried my opinion is a resounding 'meh'. Maybe they will tear down this place in a few months and try another restaurant, like they did with Chevy's?"
M P.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/27/2015,CAN I SAY THE SLOWEST STAFF EVER?!?!?!?! You guys are horrible and always forget me when I'm sitting at my table. I usually forgive a business a slip-up on the first time mayyyybe the second time but you guys are extremely careless and forgetful!!!
Kristi H.,"Grand Haven, MI",5,31,2,5.0,4/13/2014,"Their week-end brunch is wonderful!  We sat at the bar at 10 AM, had nice conversations with the bartender and other customers, watched sports on television, all while waiting for our car to be cleaned at AJ's!  Really fun, will definitely do it again!"
Beini Q.,"San Jose, CA",104,155,1,2.0,11/26/2013,"I frequent the BJ's in Newark as I used to live and work in Fremont and my coworkers often meet there for lunch. The food is consistently decent and the service is hit or miss there, usually miss. I was really excited that they opened a location in San Jose but waited to go there due to all the bad reviews, especially long wait times and service. Last Sunday night, it was late and we had not had dinner yet or gone food shopping in a few days. Normally I would have gone to some divey taqueria but we have a baby now so off to BJ's it was. We were seated at a table by the side door opening onto the patio, which a server was leaning against to chat with some others servers smoking outside on their break. Cold air and cigarette smoke is not what I prefer for my baby so we asked to move. Our server was very sweet and helpful.  As for the food, I was very disappointed by the mozzarella sticks, which I've ordered at least a dozen times at the other location. They were very dry, like if you open a box of frozen mozzarella sticks and then have it in freezer for too long and then try to cook them. I also hate that they always give you this dinky little thing of marinara sauce that is never enough for all the mozzarella sticks. I've asked for extra sauce when I order but they always forget. WAHHH! I also love their clam chowder but it is way too salty now. The only thing I enjoyed were the thai shrimp wraps which were delicious but extremely messy to eat. My other favorite is the potstickers. Come to think of it, the Asian inspired selections are all much better than the rest of the food lol. All in all, this is a chill place to come hang out and have a beer with friends. I always end up enjoying the company and the atmosphere a lot more than the food or the service."
Jon L.,"Satellite Beach, FL",1,60,22,2.0,2/20/2014,"This was our second trip to this location.  Our server this time was great.  Food and drinks came slow, but I don't think this was the servers fault.  We ordered the sampler platter for a starter.  Everything but the artichoke dip was deep fried and tasted like it had been in the freezer for a while.  I ordered the mahi tacos...thinking it was going to be fresh mahi, I was disappointed when it was another deep fried item.  Food quality could be stepped up a bunch, but the service is improving.  Oh, and it shows they take reservations, but that's a big negative."
Vijay P.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/18/2014,I really like BJ's for good variety of food and great atmosphere. They have a good choice of food for everyone and for decent price. I normally go to De Anza location right next to Apple. This Sunday we went to their new location at Coleman's road San Jose. We were a party of 10 people. I was very disappointed at this place. We were shifted through 3 waitress.  I can understand the long wait on long weekend but when we got seated it took quite some time to take our orders. The waitress was so much in hurry that did not bother to ask how we want my burger then when the food came out it was cold. It was quickly put on table and then there was no one to bring any of the condiments we waited for 5-7 minutes had to go search for some one to ask to bring the normal condiments. By the time food was so much more cold. We had to remind the waitress for our beer order which took another 5-7 minutes after reminder. I asked for glass of water and then waitress again forgot to bring it to table. I wonder if they are keeping up to good standard or just going down now. Overall experience was quite a let down and we are not going back to that location. Wonder if De Anza location has still good service.
Gilbert V.,"Vallejo, CA",57,7,16,5.0,2/16/2014,Jason is an impeccable bartender.  I have followed him from previous employers and would definitely frequent any employer that hires him.  The food is good here and the service is wonderful.
Kim T.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,,1.0,3/30/2014,No reservation and the wait time deserve one star.   Also pretending to take your name down on the waiting list and lying about the time?  Need I say more? I would rather spend my money elsewhere.
Todd W.,"San Jose, CA",14,31,30,1.0,11/18/2013,"We got take out and it was awful.  They got the order wrong, the food was cold and the employees are confused and don't know what is going on.  We ordered a beef and blue flatbread pizza, hold the mushroom and guess what? They held the beef and loaded it with mushrooms.  The frys were cold and chewy, which is new to me.  I didn't know fry's could be made chewy. BJ's has never been a favorite of mine but I still go occasionally.  This has put an end to that."
Margie M.,"Santa Clara, CA",8,60,8,1.0,1/30/2014,"Went here on the 23rd for my birthday. Everything took so long to get to us that our meal lasted about 2 1/2 hours (plus they forgot to even put our dinner order in, so we had to go over the whole thing again). Our table was never cleared of plates or drinks, so we had to keep stacking items. Ahi salad arrived with no Ahi. Salad arrived that we didn't order. The only plus what we asked the manager to comp the meal, which he did plus gave us dessert. They even forgot it was my birthday, and ran back to put a candle on my dessert after I'd already started eating it!"
Ruben M.,"San Jose, CA",6,7,,5.0,1/29/2014,HIGHLIGHT: Our Server!! Brian C was our server he did an exceptional job! He had such a positive attitude and was so pleasant to deal with. Our food and drinks were on time and he made our time here enjoyable! I don't know why this BJ's have so many bad reviews. But my friend and I had an amazing time! Thanks for the service!!
Alan T.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/8/2016,"worst place ever. wait 30min to get water and take order, everything take about 15min to 20min to get the waiter attention. whole dinner 3hr..."
Kyle W.,"San Jose, CA",24,11,,1.0,1/20/2014,"I've been here on 3 separate occasions only to be refused service. The last time I was there there were a slew of empty tables on the patio but was told it would be at least a 3 hour wait because not enough servers were available. Sorry BJ's, three strikes and you're out."
Gloria D.,"San Jose, CA",19,8,1,3.0,11/10/2013,"Great football happy hour. However, the food is not good. After visiting 3 times and ordering three different plates... I've came to realizing they don't put flavor in there dishes. I Will definitely visit for drinks and dessert only."
