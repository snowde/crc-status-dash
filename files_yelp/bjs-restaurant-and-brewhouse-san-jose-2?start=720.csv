Christina P.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,3.0,4/4/2014,The reviews are right on. The food is alright but not worth the money. The spinach artichoke dip was good. Customer service need a lot of improvement. The alcohol drinks were coming out steady. The people at our table that we're drinking water or soda never got a refill even after asking several times. Won't be coming back.
Jared A.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,11,1,1.0,12/29/2013,"I have given this place 3 chances and 2/3 times the service had been so horrible I refuse to go back.  We waited 25 min and finally had to get up and leave as no one acknowledged us being there.  On one occasion they never brought out one of the drinks we ordered, brought out our dinner salads before the appetizer we ordered 30 minutes prior, then less than a minute later brought out the main entrees.   The beer and food is decent, never have been overly impressed.  It looks like a fun atmosphere however I would never recommend this place to anyone."
Samantha B.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/8/2014,Worst service I've ever had at a bjs. Usually it's great but not a single person at our table got what they wanted. We ordered two of the same drinks and one looked way different than the other. The salad dressings were all wrong and the prices of our meals were different from the menu as well. Disappointed.
Litas L.,"Santa Clara, CA",9,18,2,1.0,12/11/2013,"This is the worst BJs I've ever received (no pun intended). Calamari soggy, flat pizza soft crust and oily, ribs are clearly boiled overcooked and tasteless, beans with ribs yellow soft and raw, bison burger meh. And the best part - manager with pride exclaims ""our veggies are cooked in microwave!"". I'm sorry, buy even at home I don't use microwave. This place sucks. Only service was OK even though took 20+ minutes for a first order to be taken."
Kiran J.,"San Francisco, CA",94,163,7,4.0,10/7/2013,BJs never fails! Good food and good drinks! Great service puts them above and beyond.
Con M.,"Medford, OR",2,7,2,4.0,3/12/2014,"BJ's food is always amazing and tonight was no exception. The burgers were perfect, the flatbread was delectable, and the Parmesan-crusted chicken was to die for. We came in 4 minutes before closing so we didn't get to experience the traditional service as our server was trying to close, but in general they seemed like a decent staff. I would go back again."
Catherine S.,"Santa Cruz, CA",82,15,,1.0,1/15/2016,"Arrived at 7pm 1/12/15 - after calling and putting us on the list for 7pm. We waited about 4 minutes to be seated, it went downhill from there. We ordered our drinks, iced tea with lots of lemon and some calamari appetizer.The tea came and all the lemon was showed to the bottom of both glasses. (we kind of like to squeeze it into the tea), asked for some sweet n low because it was not on the table, the calamari came, still no sweet n low, my friend got up and went to the  bar to get it, the waiter came back after 4 minutes with the sweet n low. Our food took another 40 minutes. We were watching the Alabama game on the tv, all of a sudden during a championship game with no explanation at all, they changed the channel. When we went to the bar to ask that it be put back on the guy said my friend was being very aggressive, not true. After 5 minutes of the game not being put back on, he went to the bar again and the same guy rolled his eyes at my friend. A few minutes later the manager comes up to our table and says that if we have any problems to come see her, where was she when we were and she tried to tell us that she was in charge of the TV not the bar, well obviously she was not, the guy at the bar changed the channel and then got offended when he was called on it.  When we asked the waiter for anything, it took forever to get back. Finally got our food, it was okay, not the best.  We finally left at 9:06pm paid 61.00 for really bad service and okay food. The managers attitude left a lot to be desired, poor service all the way around."
C E.,"San Jose, CA",0,20,,3.0,12/7/2014,"Bj's is a great place to enjoy a beer and decent food. It's very similar to cheesesteak factory but there are something's that cheesesteak does much better (avocado & southwest egg rolls). What I have enjoyed here are the burgers, flatbreads and pizzas and the bazookies are amazing"
Kat F.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,,4.0,8/28/2014,"We had a pretty good dinner here, and I will suggest a return to try out the pizza (which looked and smelled fantastic). This is not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination, but good nonetheless. A little pricey for what it is, but the the dining area is beautiful, our server was pleasant and mostly attentive, the margarita was annoyingly lumpy, the white cheddar mashed potatoes were fantastic, the broccoli was perfect, the chicken was bland and a bit dry, the burger/potato wedge combo was good, the spaghetti was odd but edible, and our desserts were very good."
Audrey N.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,,1.0,10/18/2013,"Don't bother trying this location. You've been warned. Told that wait time is 30 mins, actually 1.25 hrs later (it was one of those we waited this long might as well situation). 2 hrs after we arrived, our entrees still have not yet arrived. Apps was def not worth this wait."
Michael W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,3,,1.0,12/31/2013,Horrible Service and poor management. The floor manager Eric was walking around and talked to all the tables around us but never our table. First a dirty spoon with food on it. Then we tell the waitress they overcharged us and she gives it to the floor manager Eric and he fixes it while he is fixing someone else's ticket and delivered it to them right next to us but didn't bring our ticket to us. Then the waitress couldn't follow our instructions on splitting the check! Never go to this BJs it's horrible.
Dave M.,"San Jose, CA",0,35,,1.0,12/2/2013,"Food was not good, very bland and could have been microwaved. Servers were very inexperienced. BJ's is not a place that is ready to be trusted with for a good night out with friends."
BL C.,"San Jose, CA",0,42,,2.0,2/26/2014,Been 3 times to this location since they opened it. Two of the 3 visits were bad. Why? COLD FOOD on 2 separate visits! Appetizers small and came out AFTER our main meal was served (which was cold too). The restaurant is dimly lit...always. Service is slow.
Mel M.,"Fremont, CA",2,37,4,1.0,10/25/2015,"This place is absolutely terrible! Let me tell you, my friends and I walked for the Alzheimer's association, afterwards we were hungry to we came here. You would think Santa Clara county excellent customer service right?! WRONG! We get there and the table still had the old check there I told the hostess and she's like ""oh your waitor will get it"" seriously? Just go give it to him you idiot we are sitting here! The waitor (Bryant) takes a lifetime to just even ask us for our drinks.... Then another lifetime to ask us for our food order. But this man is THE DUMBEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. So we put in our orders and we let him know my friend has a serious food allergy, she can't have dairy and he's like ok I got it. So she orders chicken wings and ribs and the lady brings out 2 orders of chicken wings and she tells her oh 1 chicken wing and 1 rib. And she apologizes and tells us she will take care of it. She did a great job. But here comes Bryant...... He goes ""did you not realize we had them in the wings?!"" And we were a little taken back so we all pause and I say ""but that's not what she ordered.."" And he goes ""oh but I got you don't worry I got you"" so ok we get our food the manager (John) brings us the ribs but at first he doesn't even know where she's bringing it and he looks around and we had to call him over.  Ridiculous!!! How do you not know where you're going?! I call the waiter for the check and my friend says she wants the pazookie but put the ice cream separate and our other friend will eat it. She asks him ""are there any chocolate chips in the cookie?"" And he says ""no"" so she gets it. This fool comes back with ice cream on the cookie and I go ""but there's ice cream on the cookie"" and the waiter yells ""DAMNIT!"" Completely inappropriate! Unprofessional! He runs back and comes back with the cookie and ice crea separate but the chocolate chips are melted all over on top of the cookie! Seriously!!! Wtf! Then I tell him she can't have this and he takes it back and comes back FOR THE THIRD TIME! WITH A CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE! At this point I'm done! So I ask another waitress, how is this cookie supposed to come? She said ""it's a sugar cookie with caramel on top and ice cream"" my other friend then orders a beer on the side from our waiter Bryant so she waits for that.. Then I ask for the manager... So here he comes... Looking like a doofus! Comes over unprepared and I tell him what happens and he then tell us he will bring the pumpkin pazookie for my friend we wait 10 mins and we are reading the sign.. The pumpkin pazookie has CREAM CHEESE! Jesus! The idiot waiter comes back and brings my friend her change for her beer... AND BRINGS HER THE WRONG CHANGE! HOW DO YOU DO THAT?! THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU WHAT THE CHANGE IS!! So the manager comes back and says ""well, I'm glad I didn't bring you that cookie because it has cream cheese"" well good job you should've known that in the beginning! And I tell him I don't want to see that waiter again you take care of this and return me my money for the pazookie"" and he's like ""oh did you pay for it?"" YES! WTH! WHY WOULD I SAY THAT IF I DIDNT! For Christ sake! And then we tell him the other waiter brought the wrong change and it literally took him 3 minutes to do the math in his head..... The beer was 6.25$ the change is 3.75$ not 3$! And here comes Bryant right after that conversation ""oh sorry I read the change wrong"" REALLY?! Terrible customer service, terrible management! And overall, The food wasn't even that great. We will never go back! And I told the manager he needs to inservice his staff and the cursing at the table was unacceptable! He wasn't even manager material! He didn't know what to say or do to correct the situation! Pathetic!"
Kris G.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,1.0,10/31/2013,I have been here twice since it opened.  The first time our food was so wrong we had to send it back.  Service was ok. Tonight service is ridiculously slow.  The restaurant is very empty and our drinks took close to seven minutes.  My dinner salad consisted mainly do ice berg lettuce.  And we waited for the check for way too long. The drinks were horrible.
M. O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/17/2015,"I went with two friends a couple months ago to have an after work drink and munchies after a miserable day for all of us. It wasn't crowded bc it was only 430. We got seated right away but it degraded from there. We immediately saw four servers hanging around the exit door which is where we sat in our booth, and not one person came to our table in 20 min of waiting. I had to get the attention of the male server who of course said he thought someone else had our table. Before I got his attention we asked the useless hostess to get us a server and her response was, OK, if I see one I'll tell them. IF YOU SEE ONE? Really? This is the no talent that they hired? We were incredulous by her response. It then took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. Again, the place was near empty. I brought this issue to the manager's attention, who I watched during our visit and he looked like a goober, and of course, he did absolutely nothing about the situation. The least he should have done to recoup the situation was to comp out a drink or an appetizer. It seemed like the servers and manager had something better to do like talk and giggle, rather than serve customers. Good job, congrats."
Anthony P.,"San Jose, CA",0,26,,1.0,3/28/2014,Not good service and the staff is very disorganized. Went here a couple of times either they forgot or screwed up our order. Last they advised that the wait is 45 mins. Seen there was open seating outside asked about it they stated they were low on wait staff. Then stated the wait is for either or. After waiting for about 30+ minutes new people were getting seated outside. At least give the courtesy to people waiting first. Never going to another BJs cause of lack of customer service.
Wendy F.,"Santa Clara, CA",31,3,,3.0,8/31/2014,My husband and I stopped here looking for a good meal. Our server was actually really responsive and our food came out quickly but the food was an issue. First our calamari appetizer was overcooked to the point it was beyond chewy and the breading was bitter. Our server was great and offered to replace it but we had entrees coming so I passed on more/fresh batch. I ordered a burger and had to send back because it still had lettuce on it (ok so I admit I could have pulled it off myself but I told the server about it when he brought it to the table and he immediately took it back) my husbands scallops were another story. The asparagus that came with the scallops was inedible. Whoever cooked them had loped off the tender tips and cooked the woody ends. My hubs is a good sport and tried to eat them but couldn't. So I will give my waiter Tony and the mgr Chris props. Tony was very attentive and wanted to make it right. So did his mgr Chris who seemed happy to get the feedback. They are the only reason I can give this place 3 stars. I hope they will continue to work hard to improve the customer experience and I hope the kitchen will take the feedback and improve It's issues.
Antoinette M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,16,2,5.0,8/25/2014,i've been here many times and always liked coming here. this last time i went with all my biker chicks for a girls night and we had a great time. the service was excellent and the food was delicious. i shared a pizookie with one of my girls and it was on point. the server even did seperate checks for all of us which was awesome!thank you BJs for treating us #bayareabikerchicks so well =) we will have future dinners there.
stacey p.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,21,,1.0,8/21/2014,"Horrible. Tried to make a reservation for 7 ppl. Was put on hold for almost ten minutes. Their recording says reservations can be taken for 7 or more but when they finally took my call, the girl said 8 or more and wouldn't take my reservation. She said the recording was a mistake and actually asked me to find one more person to add to my party. Huh? As a courtesy she should have taken it down anyway. The food is mediocre at best and we've had bad experience with the service, so no thanks and after this time, no more. They just lost 7 customers."
