Teresa M.,"Campbell, CA",1,62,2,3.0,9/14/2014,"I've been to this location a few times and mainly after a target shopping trip. Nothing amazing but it's there and convenient. Usually go to the Cupertino location.  Few weeks ago didn't have a great experience.  Emailed and a manager contacted me to get more info. He apologized and offered compensation.  I would give this location another try. Kitchen could have had an ""off day"" when we went."
Majeed M.,"Downtown, San Jose, CA",1,6,2,4.0,10/7/2013,Lives up to the BJs reputation! And there are big screens everywhere so u will NEVER miss a big sports moment!
Tom D.,"San Jose, CA",0,98,4,5.0,8/13/2014,"Denny's with beer. Menus, with pictures of the food, for those who can't read. Plastic covers for the menus for those who like to spill. And lots and lots of choices for those who can't decide. Try the broccoli cheddar soup. Cheez Whiz with Brocolli? LOL, nasty. For anything else, you really won't need your salt shaker because every dish is LOADED with salt. But hey, its a big company, not fine dining. Servers are always happy and attentive. Just like Chotchkis."
Jill G.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,1.0,10/27/2014,"Service was the problem our food was good. I hate runners! The runner delivered all but one of the entrees. One in our party had no food. No server ever came back to check on us. At first we all waited for the last meal to be served only to end up eating cold food ourselves. We finally had to start waving our hands over our heads to finally get some attention. The missing meal was finally delivered when we had to get the attention of a manager. Drinks were never refilled. Now I could understand this if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't. Get rid of the runner concept. Servers should deliver their customer's food! This way they can see mistakes and even more important notice when someone didn't get served."
Robert L.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,22,,1.0,11/15/2014,The BJs on Coleman is just ok. The one in Cupertino is much better. The food us better fir dome reason.  Coleman BJs us always packed and too loud. Annoying!!!
Melissa D.,"San Jose, CA",56,22,1,3.0,7/27/2014,Not a great service experience - they don't like to sit singles - already had to send back my app (spoiled ahi) hoping it gets better
Joy B.,"San Jose, CA",34,12,9,1.0,9/5/2014,"#1 WORST BJ's experience! We've had BJ's from Burbank to Sacramento- Fresno to Salinas. Honestly, my best two were those! We always felt like we could walk in and know what we're getting with this chain- but apparently NOT THIS ONE!!! They must be hurting for money because our pizza (BJ's favorite) had VERY little toppings and honestly, we'd asked for extra sauce and got light sauce. When we told the waitress, she offered to bring us sauce, ensuring it'd be heated- I know how they do things- she was going to microwave it and  serve it up COLD! You should make me the next Long Island medium... This is exactly what happened. Next she offered to run it through the pizza oven as if that would heat it up. We said never mind because not only was the pizza lacking on so many levels... The carnitas fries were DISGUSTING! Cold uncooked verde sauce atop soggy shoe-string fries and carnitas that resembled tree bark, both in appearance and taste. Such a let down! Not going to give BJ's franchise any more of my money for sure! It's only good 1 out of every 3 times. This one was particularly horrible, so I wanted to warn people. This is to let the public know it's a place you should run away from because they are cutting corners BIG TIME! When the manager came over I explained all that I just explained above and he offered his apology and agreed you can't expect pizza sauce to be cooked in a microwave. So he only offered to take off the pizza which we adamantly refused to eat or take with us anyway- but no apology for our tree bark fries. Then as they both stood at the register and removed the pizza from the ticket he was saying something about us and laughing with her- After bringing us the bill for the fries and wings they offered a pizookie, if you can't make your other food right why would I trust you to make anything else? Diners beware! You would be better off going to wing stop or keeping away from this area altogether!  BJ's corporate, this kind of bar lowering standards is sure to bring your profits LOW!"
Jessica N.,"San Jose, CA",52,19,4,2.0,2/24/2014,All I have to say is that the only thing that was good was the food. We came on a Saturday around ten thirty and day at the cocktail area. Expecting to wait a long time to be greeted we actually only waited five minutes. We both felt pressured to order right away since our server frank kept hovering over us . We then ordered our drinks and entrees. He came with our water and soda at a reasonable time but I waited for my pumpkin beer for a long time. It took so long that my boyfriend had asked him about the beer again and it seemed like he forgot to ring it in since the bartenders did nothing but walk around in circles doing nothing. I received my brew right before our entrees came out. The service was very awkward and we felt pressured to leave right away. We finished our food and I barely drank my brew because it was just plain awkward. I've been a server for years and I just could wright a list of mistakes that our server and hostesses made. After we paid we left and seen five hostesses at the stand they sat around talking instead of saying have a goodnight like most places.
P C.,"San Jose, CA",2,18,,1.0,10/15/2013,"Horrible service and unfortunately the food wasn't any better.  I would give it a few stars for the beer selection but the service was so bad that I feel it pulled the overall rating down.  As for my experience, it involved being told the wait would be a certain amount of time only to have it extended by 15 to 20 mins each time, so a 30-45 min wait actually turned out to be close to an hour and a half.  Had they told me the wait would be an hour I never would have waited.   wait staff were great but the a host and the manager were actually close to being rude with us.  Food....no thanks, everything we ordered seemed overly greasy"
Rose B.,"San Jose, CA",0,68,,1.0,10/7/2014,"Went there last night with a friend, wasn't fond of going there but my friend I was taking to dinner wanted to try it out. Should have insisted we go elsewhere, service terrible still, food horrible as usual. I ordered a shrimp Caesar salad, it was like eating a bowl of dry lettuce, hardly any dressing, lettuce wilted and brown, old lettuce, horrible and next time I will INSIST we go elsewhere as things have not changed, the place was dead and I can see why. Go to Chili's next door, better service, better selection and better food by far."
Jocelyn A.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/8/2014,Kids meal served not as described.     Hamburgers always with cheese overlooked.     Manager kristopher Kent no caring just blames server.  Really
Keith R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,2.0,10/8/2013,"Got soggy pizza that was straight from the oven and I only live a mile away from restaurant.  And today got spaghetti with meat sauce.  They only gave enough sauce for 1/4 of the pasta, pasta was dry, and bread was hard.  Really trying hard to give this place because I still have fond memories of BJ's 20 years ago when I was living in Long Beach."
Lauren W.,"Campbell, CA",0,21,1,5.0,6/3/2014,"Great happy hour! We had a large group here on a beautiful sunny afternoon and they accommodated us so well! Thanks, BJ's!!"
Therealist D.,"San Jose, CA",33,14,,1.0,7/10/2015,My first experience here the waiter never brought us utensils and she never refilled our lemonades or checked on our table....so i gave it another try today thinking maybe service will be better i was wrong...first i ordered some avocado rolls for appetizer and a pizza i said no bacon or ham for religious reasons we cannot have bacon or ham on our pizza ... so pizza gets there 30 minutes later and no appetizer.... i told the lady and she told our waiter i said never mind just forget it at this point. I took a bite and then i felt something rubbish and my worst nightmare it had bacon!!!! my son bit a piece too and i immediately made him spit it out i spit mine out and told the waiter..manager came and he said they will re make it another 35 min later i ask him a box it it's too late and he did i walked out and right before leaving i checked box and what did it have bacon all over the pizza... im so mad i feel like they mockingly added a lot of bacon to piss me off i was so mad i left angry i told the manager he didn't say nothing he felt stupid and i left .. my sons were starving  and so was i and my sister we were so hurt that they didnt think it was important as it was to us ..never returning here again ever!!! If i don't want bacon respect my choice please if it was your belief you wouldn't want anyone disrespecting you don't  it to me either im so hurt and mad so livid saddest part it was my nephew's birthday and he didn't eat anything and his day was ruined..oh we never got plates or any utensils or refills either today dont  eat here bad service
Casey N.,"Aptos Hills-Larkin Valley, CA",25,168,,2.0,12/4/2013,"Had a late dinner last night at BJ's because it was convenient and open late.   I'm completely in agreement with the other 1 and 2 star reviews who cited the service as being awful.  Wow.. we were just amazed how lousy it was.  From the moment we walked in to leaving an hour and a half later, it got progressively worse. When I walked in, I was completely ignored by the hostess. In fact, instead of making any eye contact as I walked in and stood in front of her at the reception desk, she walked away for a few minutes without a word to chat and laugh with a server.  When she returned, she did not greet me, never smiled, was really unhelpful, then mumbled something, and was annoyed when I asked her to repeat herself.  Even though the restaurant was maybe 20% (at most) filled with diners, she told me to take a seat and someone would take me to the table.  I was fine waiting since the others I was meeting hadn't arrived, but thought it was odd.  I'm now trying to give more benefit of the doubt to people in customer service if they have a bad day, so I tried to shake her attitude off and tell myself that she must be having personal problems. Once seated at the table, the server did not check in for nearly 10 minutes.  He was very nice, but distracted - I ordered iced tea and water and he then asked if I wanted anything to drink.  It took many minutes for the beverages to be delivered.  When my party arrived, it took several minutes for him to come back and ask them for their beverage orders.  Just periods of looooonnnnggg delays between sightings of the waiter and his return.  When we were ready to order, he brought over another server and said he was leaving on break and she would be taking care of us.  She also seemed very nice, took our order by memory, and then disappeared for a long time.  Expediters delivered our salads 10 to 15 minutes after we ordered, and then brought out our entrees a couple of minutes later.  No ""do you want an extra plate since you're splitting"" or ""would you like some steak sauce"" or ""would you like a steak knife"" or ""can I bring you more water or iced tea""?  We flagged down our server several minutes later to ask for steak knives, an extra plate, more water, etc.  Again..... long delay.  Used the salad plate as the extra plate and sawed through the steak to divide it with a regular knife. The meals were okay.  Our wedge salads were funny.  A little slice of iceburg lettuce with some very sweet blue cheese dressing, perhaps a 1/2 teaspoon or less of crumbled bacon, and 5 tiny chunks of tomato.  The sirloin steaks were prepared perfectly, but the vegetables were tasteless and hard.  They had a special that included a lobster tail with the steak, so we ordered that and the tail was fairly small (to be expected for the price) and seasoned with curry.  I didn't mind, but it was a bit odd. When we were finished, our empty plates (salad and dinner) were all over the table and our water and iced tea glasses empty.  Even when the server came back eventually to ask if we wanted dessert, she nor anyone else picked up the plates. We paid the bill and left without anything being removed from the table.  When leaving, there were two ladies at the hostess station.  Neither said ""thanks for coming"" or ""drop dead.""  For a chain restaurant that competes for business with others in the area, I would expect that they would have some type of training and customer service standards?  I was just pissed by the time we left.    Prices were reasonable and BJ's definitely has a wide variety of items on their menu.  We read that Tuesdays are 1/2 off wine night, and they offer some very nice wines!  I would prefer not to give my money to this restaurant after our experience.  We've been to the BJ's in Cupertino a few years ago and enjoyed it.  This was nothing like that experience. I'm being very generous with the 2 stars, hoping they get their act together. But, actually and somewhat sadly, I couldn't care less whether this restaurant is successful."
Mark Z.,"Campbell, CA",1,5,2,1.0,1/25/2014,"I just had the WORST dining experience of my life. I went to this BJ's for lunch with my son and chose to sit on the patio. I asked our server for an umbrella to give us a little shade and she complied. Few minute later, another employee, a young girl introduced herself as ""Mattiana""(may have given wrong name since she had no name tag!) showed up and moved the umbrella without asking. When I nicely told her that we asked for that umbrella and our server put it there, she started yelling and screaming and suddenly laughing saying she doesn't care. At that time I thought that either she is on drugs or we are being pranked! When I asked for her name she said"" I don't care what you go and say about me because I am quitting today"" and then she started laughing out of control. Unbelievable!!! I went inside and asked for the manager. He came and I calmly explained what happened. He listened but I could tell he just didn't want to be there himself. He said ""I take care of it"" , but I know he did nothing because that girl was still laughing as we were leaving. The manager never made any gesture of apology for the embarassment his employee caused myself and my son.  I am still in shock!"
T X.,"San Mateo, CA",1,11,,2.0,11/19/2013,"Second time for lunch at this location and lots of problems.  Extremely slow service, untrained servers.  First time - asking for dressing choices, the waitress literally says ""we have a very long list of like 30 of them"" - but couldn't come up with any.  Waited 20 minutes for soup refill on soup/salad combo, etc.  Second time - waited 25-30 minutes for food (lunch time!) to be told it was ""stuck in the computer"" and didn't get placed.  Just overall unprofessional disorganized service.  Food fine, so it gets 2 stars for that."
Debra-lea O.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/12/2014,"The service was lacking and the food was even worse. My food arrived with ingredients missing, the servers were completely confused, and we sat for over an hour waiting for something to happen. We never quite figured out who our server was because people kept coming to the table asking if we needed help. I won't be going back."
Kai Chung Anderson L.,"San Jose, CA",92,45,7,4.0,2/21/2014,"I always oet the BJ's Favorite Deep Dish pizza at every BJ location I went to, so there was nothing to fancy to talk about.  I also got the combo appetizer this time, and it was decent.  I must say getting those two items together for only two people weren't the best selection.  Server was friendlier than the other SJ location I must say.  At least she remembered to bring out parmesan cheese and pepper without us asking her, and she brought out the ranch sauce quickly when requested."
Lilach S.,"Saratoga, CA",24,1,,5.0,4/26/2014,"I held a birthday party here for my 13 year old son with 30 kids. The service was incredible!!! Kristopher Kent, the manager, met with me before the event because I was so nervous, but everything ran very smoothly. The waiters were great and the food was delicious!  The kids had a great time. I definitely recommend this location!"
