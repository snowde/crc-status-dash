Kenia D.,"San Jose, CA",0,47,,4.0,6/1/2014,"Service is always good, food is pretty consistently good and satsifying.  I crave their pepperoni pizza on a weekly basis!"
Angela D.,"Morgan Hill, CA",21,16,2,1.0,3/27/2014,"My brothers and I decided to take mom to BJ's for her birthday. Waiter comes out with our drinks. He dumps the entire soda directly into her lap. Since she was sitting in the middle of the booth, she of course can't escape. What does the waiter do? Stands there dumbfounded. Doesn't immediately grab napkins. Nothing. Just stands there. After about 4 min of this, he waves a busboy over to clean the mess. Waiter doesn't lift a finger. At the end of the meal, he only comped us for her soda. W.O.W. They call that service? And so much for hearing happy birthday being sung. One waitress comes out and drops off some small dessert. Then walks away. Never eating at BJ's again. Poor POOR service."
Sunny K.,"San Jose, CA",3,25,2,1.0,10/26/2013,"I rarely give a one star rating but this place takes the cake for worst service EVER!  Dined in tonight and never have I been so irritated after paying good money. Since when was it bad to dine in with a group of friends after 9pm for some drinks and appetizers? Our tab was almost 100 dollars in drinks and appetizers and our server deliberately told her two other co workers to not serve us because we didnt order entrees. Our server even had the nerve to come by to our table after she talked shit about us to tell us about how gratuity works......  Employess are unprofessional and need to be trained better. If you don't even know what drinks you have in stock then offer something else. Our server coulnt even offer us drinks when I simply asked her for something sweet.... It also took forever just to get our beers, only time she came by to our table was to see if we were going to order entrees when I deliberately told here were here for drinks and appetizers and that we would tell her if we needed anything. Word of advice, don't talk about your table when you're two feet away, at least we had the decency to leave you 15% tip. Never ever coming back here again!!!!"
Mariah G.,"Milpitas, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/6/2014,"Seriously thee worst customer service ever! We get there at about 8:30ish and a few people get there after us and get seated before us by the time we get seated it's about 9:15 by the time the server comes to take our order it is about 9:30! I ordered a mock tail since I'm 6 months pregnant, and after I finish my first one I get a mojito as a refill... I didn't sip it since I realized what it was. Then my husband ordered shrimp in his pasta and got chicken! The service was HORRIBLE! Little to say I'll never go back to this bjs!"
BIG M.,"Milpitas, CA",8,15,26,1.0,10/26/2013,"First time and last time here..waited 10 min for tables. 20 minutes before I asked for a manager and she came. She gave us appetizers and drinks free but does nothing for me. The waitress was nice, it was not her fault but operations needs to be better. I might return and see if anything is different in 6 months."
Craig B.,"San Jose, CA",1,6,,1.0,3/25/2014,Service sucks! I have been there three times - Each time I stand around waiting for someone to help me and it takes forever. All three times they have made my order wrong..Yes all three times haha - So sad it's almost funny. I was so excited about them moving in but will not be returning due to service.
Anita M.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/18/2015,really bad customer service the wait is horrible we had had a big party but still two hours waiting for our order was horrible will never go here again bad experience not sure if they were being races but they looked at us like they were!!!!!!!! HEADS UP they don't sing happy birthday either and only give a cookie with a scoop of ice cream and walk away!
Susan M.,"San Jose, CA",39,5,2,1.0,11/22/2013,"A lot of these reviews about slow service are correct. My family of 5 had a late lunch there last Saturday around 1:30 or so. The place wasn't very crowded and we were seated very quickly. We waited forever to order drinks and appetizers. After another long wait, she brought my kids drinks out, then the appetizers, but still not the beers my husband and I ordered or plates for the apps. She said she would bring us plates. She came back to take our order for lunch, but didn't bring plates so took off again. Finally, we got the plates then waited forever for lunch. We finally finished by almost 3 pm because they were so slow. Ridiculous considering it was not busy. Food was only meh! The BJ's at Oakridge is busy and usually has long wait times, but their staff is better trained and worth the wait. Not sure I want to come back again after ready all these other reviews and seeing they had a bad experience as well!"
Carol R.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,,2.0,2/24/2014,"First I have to say we usually really like BJs as a chain, and we were super excited to find one opening just a few miles from where we live in San Jose..at previous BJs the food is usually consistently good, the atmosphere and lighting is very nice, great real sodas and excellent beer.  Unfortunately, in THIS newly opened BJs, we've not experienced what we are used to at BJs.  It looks the same (atmosphere/lighting) but the service leaves a lot to be desired.    Since they opened, we've been there at least  6 times...each time we've experienced slow service, and very long wait times for ordering a 2nd round of drinks.   The wait-staff seem to be quite inexperienced, but most have been reasonably pleasant.  Our most recent experience 5 of us were at a table in the bar.   When the waiter finally noticed us and came over to take our order, he could not tell us if happy hour was still in process or not, so we couldn't tell what to order (this despite the happy hour menu on the table and the fact that if there is a game playing - there was - in the past, BJs has called that happy hour) -- so it took him some time to find a manager to determine if happy hour was still ""on"" (it wasn't) -- took ages to get the first round of drinks. . we ordered a 2nd round ...[place was only about 40% full] - for ages our waiter kept walking past our table delivering drinks to others all around us.   After about 20 minutes we flagged him down.  He looked annoyed and said, ""we're out of glasses .. as soon as the kitchen has some clean ones I can bring  your drinks.."" -- and he walked away.  We sat there staring at the clean wine glasses and little wine carafes sitting and hanging above the bar,  watching the bartender pour a martini into a glass for someone who had just ordered one.  I would have  pointed out that we had a set of empty glasses on our TABLE and perhaps if the waiter TOOK THOSE BACK to the bar they'd be able to use those   But no - -the waiter had walked off (after us also telling him that we'd like to order some food).   [Really I don't know why I'm not giving this place 1 star, except I am reserving the 1 star rating ""standard"" for the Worst Dining Experience Ever that we had a few weeks ago in Japantown at Wings. . . and this experience was NOWHERE NEAR as bad as that!] Anyway - I asked to speak to the manager.   The ""manager"" was really out of his depth - didn't seem to know what to do or how to handle the situation.  Got a lot of canned, ""I understand can I do anything ELSE for you?"" (you know  - that passive aggressive sugary question that requires the complaining customer to answer in the affirmative as though everything is all right when it's not..) -- we finally got our drinks . . but the waiter never returned to take a food order.  The manager, out of the blue, said he'd ""ordered some complimentary appetizers"" for us, which was certainly an effort to do something to make up for the bad service/waiter's snarky attitude, but we didn't WANT appetizers  - we wanted to order a meal (which we were not expecting to be given to us free) - and instead of giving us a choice of what we wanted to order, a random selection of fried items appeared on our table. When they first opened I chalked up this sort of experience to a green staff, a newly opened facility etc., - but honestly, it's not getting better and they've been open a while now.   They need to train their wait staff and get some experienced managers in there."
Yen C.,"Atherton, CA",0,37,1,2.0,3/23/2015,food was greasy and overpriced.   with so many good places to go in downtwon San Jose which is just a few blocks away. .  I should not have settled to go to BJs.
John D.,"Walnut Creek, CA",8,34,5,2.0,12/24/2013,Service was very poor and it's slow here maybe at 15% capacity the food on the other hand was excellent we had calamari and sweet pig pizza delicious!!!!
Frankie M.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,4.0,2/9/2014,Oh man this places parmasian crusted/crispy chicken is so delicious! The mash potatoes are so creamy and the chicken is just mm to die for. Im writing this as im sitting here eating it yummy. Best plate of food ive ever had!! The wait was not long at all either and a more busy sunday night. The staff is super friendly too.
Vernon M.,"San Jose, CA",1,44,2,2.0,11/7/2013,"I think I will like this place, once they get their act together.  They recently opened, the beer is great, but they clearly don't have the kinks worked out yet.  Ive been here 4 times.  2 were ok, 2 were bad.   You know its an unsuccesul evening at a restaurant if after 2 plus hours you have to go to Wing Stop next door to get something to eat.  Tonight,  I waited 45 min for a seat at the bar.  I would have liked a beer while waiting,  but oh well.  Finally got a seat at the bar, and ordered quickly, an appetizer and a pizza.  The app was slow to come out, but they were busy,  so no big deal.  Later, the server apparently dropped my pizza on the floor.  The bartender apologized and said they would get another right out.   40 min later,  the gesticulating and pointing made it clear that no pizza was coming.   The manager apologized and said he didnt know what happened, but would comp me a pizza next time which was nice, and the bartender comped me a beer, also nice.  But in the end I still ended up at Wing Stop for dinner.  So I hope they get their act together."
AW B.,"Milpitas, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/21/2014,"I've been a fan of BJ's until I came to this location, unfortunately. Maybe we were just unlucky this night. Our waiter took our order & shortly after addressed that a different waiter would take care of us since he was going on his break. I didn't mind until we sat there forever waiting for our food. A waiter was walking around with orders & it was brought to our attention that he was going table after table asking if that was their order (very professional, right?). I automatically knew that it was ours but he seemed to ask all the tables BESIDES ours & went back to the kitchen with the food. We were almost 100% sure it was our order. Then a different waitress asked if we wanted dessert, but was totally unaware that we've been waiting patiently for our main dishes. We wanted to tell her, ""Bitch it'd be nice if we got our food first!"" I know it wasn't her fault, but we finally got our food after hella long & what do ya know, IT WAS COLD & the noodles were hard. They could've reheated it or something! Our assumptions were right, it was probably sitting in the kitchen that entire time because the waiters had no clue who it belonged to. Will not return to this location because of their bad service. & to add, I normally would order a pizzokie, but I was so livid that I just wanted to get the fuck out of there!"
Cee B.,"San Jose, CA",1,77,3,4.0,9/20/2014,"Friday night.  Only a 15 minute wait for two.  Nice.  Started off with the Calamari.   It came like 5 minutes after we ordered it.  RED FLAG.  How do you prepare and cook Calamari in 5 minutes during dinner rush?  I took one bite and it was soft and stretchy.  Yuck.   I told the waitress it wasn't good and she said she was surprised at how fast it came out too.  Mind you, our original waitress is not the one who brought the Calamari to our table, which leads me to my next comment.  We had 4 different waiters that waited on us in the 2 hours we were there.  #Weird!  Were they playing Musical Chairs in the kitchen or what? Aside from that everything was good.  I've been to every other BJ's in the Bay Area and this one is #2 on my list.  #1 is BJ's Cupertino.  I took one star off for the bad Calamari, which they took off the bill....but whoever made it had to have known they half assed it.  Ready in 5 minutes?   This aint Little Caesars!"
Johnny P.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,4.0,2/1/2014,me and a couple of broskis wanted to grab some brewskis we were in the area and also hungry so we decided to stop by this newer location. got two deep dish pizzas and a couple glasses jermiah red. and I just had to get a pazoooookie!
Jeff S.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,2.0,11/21/2013,"well this is the first time at this location. ok, started at the bar. prompt fast service.  when rest of party of four arrived we were seated quickly. unfortunately that where it went down hill from there. although food was good, they removed one item from menu, their great bbq beef sandwich. a favorite on one of our guest. one in the party had to send their order back because it was wrong.  then when it came had to prompt the wait staff for ketchup for fries. then had to get up to hunt someone down for it and they cracked a joke after multiple mistakes already. another of the party ordered red wine with dinner. waiter showed up with a white wine. it was typical noisey bjs. come to live with that for typical great food and drinks, but if they do not get the wait staff up to par. will stay over to location at oakridge."
Mike W.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,1,,3.0,1/15/2014,first I would like to say the food is great and I love BJ's Restaurant the servers are usually pretty good I go there a lotvsomething that I did not like at all is the manager Eric consistently flirts with his waitrpesses and servers laughing making jokes and worst of all put in his arms over their shoulders as they play around Eric this is not high school this is a work environment you are a manager and have a business to runwhen there are hungry guests waiting to be seated or waiting for the food you should be focused on them instead of pleasing your own needs by having fun with the young girls something needs to be done I hope by this review the managers will do the research and find a better manager to run a proper classy businesslast but not least I love the pizookie
