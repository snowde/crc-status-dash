Erin M.,"San Jose, CA",60,21,92,2.0,9/9/2017,"Very disappointing... We got to BJ's as soon as they opened at 11 o'clock to celebrate my boyfriends dad's birthday. We ordered and we didnt get our food until 45 minutes later. The waitress apologized because they were short staffed but the weird thing is that there was hardly anyone in the resturant! Anyway-- we got our food and the serving sizes were very small for the amount you pay. The salads that were served with all our entrees had a very sour tasting dressing on top. After that we asked if we could get a birthday cookie for His birthday. It took them another 20 minutes to get the dessert out... the ice cream was completely melted on it because they said the ""freezer was broken"". When they brought the cookie out they didnt even sing happy birthday or anything.. the waitress just apologized for the dessert and ran off. Very dissapointing expereince for a resturant with so much potential. I will not be coming back."
Karen P.,"San Jose, CA",0,103,28,1.0,3/11/2017,"We were hoping to continue a great evening after Luzia, but this visit on a Friday at 7 night was so disappointing. At check in our wait was 1 hour- leave your number and get a text when to return.  No biggie since there are nearby stores to kill time. We got a text 20 mins later (yay!) and rushed back from Target to check in only to wait an additional 20 mins- although we were standing right in front of the hostess, they forgot about us (boo!). And not sure how often this happens but on this night, just after being seated, a woman and her young daughter was going table to table asking for money to feed her family. While the food was not horrible, it was subpar- excessive oil on fried calamari (11.95) made the breading slide off, Brewhouse burger with  more bun than meat (8.95), decent parmesan chicken cutlets with pasty mashed potatoes (16.95) and a lukewarm deep dish ziti-looks picture perfect on top with melted cheese and meat, but is just plain pasta tubes underneath (15.75). Dinner is overpriced for the portions and quality of the food.   Service was meh- we had to ask for utensils and refills(most are free).  Food took a long time to come out. They do have a pretty good bar/beer selection, so maybe this is a good place to have drinks but definitely will not be returning for the food."
Joey C.,"San Jose, CA",27,53,17,2.0,8/29/2017,Came into bjs for a lunch and sat outside. The outside area was really sunny and didn't have any umbrellas for shade . After we got away from the sun blazing our eyes we both ordered a ahi salad. The dish was pretty pricey and for both of us only got a sale and one appetizer it was pretty price and over $50. Overall the salad wasn't the best. Who was undercooked and the fish didn't taste he freshest. Of course the sampler avocado appetizers are always a good choice. We had been waiting a really long time to get he check so we actually walked out to the front to pay. Downfalls are really loud airplanes outside and really sunny . Not a great location . I probably wouldn't go back.
Joseph H.,"Milpitas, CA",2,7,3,1.0,2/2/2017,"Traditional I've really enjoyed the pizzas and pasta dishes from BJs but I just received a delivery that is missing ingredients and made to a very low standard. I'm applaud by this lack of quality and care because I ordered delivery vs eating in. As you can see in the photo, it's painfully obviously how far the Apple has fallen. Do not order delivery from here"
Todd G.,"Santa Clara, CA",100,50,41,4.0,3/10/2017,"First of all, it puzzles me why this place gets only 2.5 stars.  Every time I've been in here, and sat in the bar area, the service has been impeccable.  Stephanie goes out of her way to help you out and pours a damn good drink.  The food is always on point and it's reasonable priced.  Maybe I'm not coming into this place at the wrong time.  But my experience here has always been a good one."
Alyssa B.,"Alviso, CA",506,469,880,2.0,11/28/2015,"I could live without going to a BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse ever again, but my boyfriend likes the place. In terms of chain restaurants with large menus and a stunning dessert, I'll stick with Cheesecake Factory.  When we do go here, the wait is always long. Sometimes they even have tables and just lack the servers to seat people. And if there's a game being broadcast on the TVs all over the restaurant, you can be sure that the wait will be even longer.  Service is friendly, but can be slow. The menu is extensive, but nothing really sticks out as amazing. Maybe it's just that I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I just can't appreciate this place. Especially not when the beer costs as much as a meal. And the meals are pretty standard, if not slightly underwhelming for the price. One of the redeeming things about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the pizza-cookie, the pizookie. I like the pizookie trio, since you get the option of 3 different types of pizookies to try with some exclusions for the special items. While I'm still open to coming here, I can't say it's ever going to be my first choice. I'll continue to keep an eye out for an item on the menu that I'll love to order, but to this day I am still floundering about with my food decisions. This location in particular has some perks. For one, it's in a plaza with A LOT of parking options available. Two, the outdoor patio is very nice. Three, they have plenty of waiting room. If you choose to wait outside, loudspeakers broadcast when a party is being called."
Frank G.,"San Jose, CA",8,5,1,2.0,5/6/2017,"After a while decided to come back, the service is still lacking, food came in different waves, had to keep asking where the rest of the food was. More communication from his part would go a long way, probably the kitchen got slammed but I'll never know. Management needs to push more customer service training on the staff. Food was AMAZING, everything we order was great"
Anj N.,"Oakland, CA",0,3,,4.0,11/18/2017,"I came here after work with my friends(total of six of us) during happy hour and our estimated wait time was 20 minutes but we end up waiting for 50 minutes. It was super packed and busy so it made sense. We received great service from our waiter, Marcus! The food was good and so were the pizookies!"
Yellow Boy A.,"Mountain View, CA",10,185,1129,3.0,3/12/2017,Similar to many of the other chain BJ's restaurant however it was pretty crowded. Good drinks and food overall.   Texting our phone is a good addition while we wait.
Robert H.,"San Jose, CA",588,298,2163,3.0,10/25/2015,"We've been to this particular location a handful of times, and their food has been consistently good. Since it is in a prime location, you have to be prepared for chaos. If you come at an odd time/hour, then you increase your chances of bypassing that long wait to be seated and served. Last night we ordered the following: California Club (Flatbread Pizza Appetizer) 6"" Deep Dish Cheese Pizza (Kids's Menu) BJ's Brewhouse Blonde (Fish & Chips) Baked Beignet  Everything listed above came out perfectly. The flatbread pizza was had a nice crisp to the crust, and had just the right amount of cheese. The deep dish cheese pizza was good, but I felt it had a little too much cheese. I'm a little biased because I'm more of a thin crust guy. If you are a fish & chips fan, they use Pacific cod fillets, and skinny fries that come out with the perfect amount of crisp,  and with very minimal grease! The baked beignet was a little tough and chewy this time, so I wasn't a big fan. Side note: They don't have any ""free"" house bread. They brought 4 plates of bread, but charged us $1 per plate. The upside was the bread was really good, but you have to tell us that it isn't ""house bread"".  Maybe they can call it, ""dollar bread""? :P Conclusion: Great atmosphere, good service, good food. I'd definitely come back, but I wouldn't wait longer than 20 minutes for a table."
Marco C.,"San Jose, CA",3,169,,1.0,9/14/2017,"Not a very good restaurant, all their food is very greasy and the pizzas are thick and very greasy. I ordered some calamari and pizza, but tasted not good."
Rachel R.,"San Jose, CA",109,41,6,5.0,1/14/2017,"I wasn't exactly having the best evening, but the fam and I were lightweight hungry. Decided to come here because, being the ""deprived child"" I am, I've never been here before LOL. Best decision ever. Roberto gave us amazing customer service and he was super nice! He was very attentive to our table and constantly came to check up on us and refill our beverages. He even suggested the best possible options since I wanted a small pizza - opted for 2 minis (1 to go) since it was Happy Hour. Thank you for letting me know! 5 stars to him for the amazing service!  The food: Everything we ordered tasted amazing! Great White mini pizza, Buffalo Chicken ranch mini pizza, Salmon Quinoa Bowl, and The Late Night Burger.  (Only issue was that the salmon quinoa bowl was a bit over salted, but it still tasted good) Bring on desserts and sweets!  FIRST TIME FOR PIZOOKIES! (haha wasn't kidding about being a ""deprived child"")  Anyways, we ordered the mini trio: Macadamia nut, Monkey Bread, and Oreo but the chef accidentally made all of them regular. We weren't charged for the accidental upgrade which was really nice on their part. It was a great way to end the night - made my evening a lot better! Each pizookie was amazingly delicious, but my most favorite one was Oreo.  Will definitely be coming back."
Lovejit B.,"San Jose, CA",4,7,2,1.0,12/16/2016,"Horrible customer service! Tried to make a reservation for a bday dinner and a lady answers the phone tells me she'll get her manager leaves me on hold for 25 minutes and then another lady answers the phone ""hi miss have you been helped yet"" are you kidding me!? Waited cus I really needed a table tonight only to be placed on hold for about 30 minutes and then another lady randomly picking up the phone just to tell me there's nothing available and they've been booked for a while."
Daniel A.,"San Jose, CA",6,1,,5.0,9/10/2017,"This is probably the new chili's for me since it has a greater menu, food is delicious, customer service was great, and the time wait for my food was faster than any other place. #1 in my books"
Samantha C.,"Scotts Valley, CA",5,7,8,1.0,4/28/2017,Super slow service. Dirty silverware. Wrong orders after an hour of waiting. Forgotten orders. Not very good food. Watery drinks.
Lisa R.,"Yucaipa, CA",85,3,1,1.0,3/19/2017,"We were just at this restaurant.  We were in a large group of 24. The servers brought out our orders and gave the wrong salad to one of the ladies.  The server realized his mistake and took the salad back from her, AFTER she had already started eating it. After circling the table a couple of times to try and see who was missing a meal, he then gave it to me.  I did not make a fuss because I was with my daughter's gymnastics team, but this is absolutely inexcusable! I couldn't eat the salad.  I like BJ's but I will never go back to this location. Disgusting!   The women's bathroom was also a mess!"
Patricia E.,"San Jose, CA",20,4,,2.0,2/24/2017,I am wanting to find out if anyone else has slipped and fallen on their very slippery floors or the ground out front when its been raining??? Please send me a message.. thank you The food was great but the floors/ground super slippery inside and out  anyone else?
Zibell A.,"San Jose, CA",94,3,,5.0,6/7/2017,My family and I come here about 2-3 times a week even when it's busy the service is still great! Also the we love the food of course! (:
Heleina M.,"San Jose, CA",68,21,21,3.0,6/30/2016,"The food was okay.  The service was okay.  Overall, the whole experience was alright. The only thing I enjoyed was the pizookie and the mozzarella sticks."
Verona N.,"San Jose, CA",149,147,1445,3.0,9/19/2015,"I met a friend for dinner last week at this location. We used the Party of Two deal for $25. We each had a small salad, shared a med deep dish Bbq chicken pizza and shared a chocolate chip pizookie. The food was great especially for the price. It was nice to have a mommy's night out without breaking the bank.  Our server seemed less than happy to be there and had the attitude of a wet blanket. But he was polite for the most part."
