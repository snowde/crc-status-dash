Vik S.,"San Jose, CA",78,230,3,4.0,8/8/2017,"Ribeye steak, asparagus, baked potato is my usual order Steak is really good, better than Cheesecake Factory next door and 6 bucks cheaper hehe Great value and yummy food , what's not to like?"
Quyen H.,"San Jose, CA",631,202,624,3.0,12/3/2017,"It's a great place for a glass of beer. There's a large selection to choose from! I was pretty impressed with it!  There's also happy hour that makes everything so much better. I remembered ordering the burger here and I was surprised at how big the burger was! I was able to substitute my fries for a side of salad instead. The waiter had no problem with that at all. Back to the burger, it was so big! I had to use a knife to cut into two in order to even hold it! It was quite delicious though.  There's some other menu items here that I want to try but I'm not sure which ones or where to start! Their menu reminds me of cheesecake factory where they have everything you can ever think of!  Overall, it was just a good place for dinner and a drink with friends."
Jasmine P.,"San Jose, CA",122,90,2,3.0,11/21/2017,"I wanted to take my sister and brother in law out with my kiddies.  We waited and the host was awesome!!  The server was pretty great as well but the food took a long time to come out. We were not going crazy about it because we were all in conversation and the kids were talking. So we were having a good time. But hen we realize that we were waiting for 45 min for our food. Then when the food came, some of the items (fries) were stale tasting. Then my sister had to wait a little longer for her plate while we all got ours. When her plate came the chicken was raw in the middle. The waitress we had was awesome, she came to us right when  we raised our hand for her attention. She didn't run the other direction. Once she took back the plate a few seconds later her manager came and apologized. He took it off our ticket and got her a different choice for the night. When it came time to go and get the ticket, it was not updated and the manager came right over to fix it. We were okay with everything, it was not great but i liked how the manager and the waitress were very nice and tried to fix any oops they had!"
Sophia T.,"San Jose, CA",181,12,6,1.0,11/5/2017,"We made reservations at 5:30PM. We waited for an hour, and our server was nowhere to be found. It's currently 6:30pm and I am fuming simply because we made this reservation and my mother has diabetes, so she has to eat on time. Thank you BJs for celebrating her birthday by not actually serving us and leading her to have a hypoglycemic attack in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered a soda, which came 40 minutes late. I am very, very upset, and me and my family will never come back again. This dang place almost costed my moms life, and I have never experienced a worse experience. I sincerely hope BJs fixes it's terrible service, because I will sue next time I step foot in here. We also had no apology for the wait, and the servers were blatantly rude and terrible to us and I'm still in shock as to how all the servers were irresponsible. This place is horrible. Horrible.  I'd rather die than come back. Honestly. Not to mention the staff was extremely racist to my family, thinking that we could not comprehend the American language, and ignored all of our requests. Thank you once again, for the racist, horribly slow, and disrespectful service! I wouldn't even give this place a star, and I would give it a - 7 if possible. As for food, the brown rice is uncooked, cold, and very unappetizing. Everything is not even lukewarm because they didn't even have the decency to bring out food on time. (I also requested for this to be brought out as soon as possible seeing that my mother had very low blood sugar. This was brought out 30 minutes late. And we got cold food. Really.)"
Ria A.,"San Jose, CA",433,67,380,3.0,10/14/2017,"This location is 1000 X better than the one on Coleman ave! If you prefer not to eat in a pitch dark restaurant, this location is it!  We've always gone to the BJ's located on Coleman avenue and did not even realize this was close by! Every time we've gone to the Coleman location to watch a game, I've felt as if I were seconds away from falling asleep! The place is so dark and made me feel instantly sleepy! Maybe I'm just weird..Anyway, if you like light, go to the Blossom Hill location.  This location also has a large parking structure next to it as it's right by the mall. Parking is never an issue and I love the out door seating area. As far as food and drinks go, it's typical bar/chain restaurant food. It's a great place to watch games and grab a quick bite."
Kathy N.,"San Jose, CA",447,40,77,1.0,9/24/2017,"WORST SERVICE EVER. My cousin and a friend booked a reservation here for a party of 16. The day or two before, they called again to confirm the reservation and add 1/2 people into the reservation. Well, BJ's said the reservation was never made?? The day after we called again and they said they still have our reservation?? Alright. OUR RESERVATION WAS 5-7PM. We ordered about 5:15. TELL ME WHY DID EVERYONE'S FOOD COME FROM NEARLY 6:40 - 7:40pm?? We waited OVER an hour for our food. We had creepy guys recording the girls, the staff kept saying the food is being made, and the food was suddenly being made AFTER our reservation ended. The food that came out for most people was not even hot. We all sat there incredibly hungry, waiting OVER an hour just for food. And quite honestly, bj's food was all show and not QUALITY. My friend's pizza dish made getting pizza a struggle. My vegan lentil soup was warm and looked like a dog took a dookie lmao. My other friend's salad was 1/4 of a cabbage + dressing LOL.  Some people ate super early, some people ate super late. My poor cousin had to wait for over two hours for food. Staff apologized after over an hour and a half and said they are finally starting on my cousin's dish WHEN BEFORE they said they are currently cooking it. What??  We didn't get a discount, nothing. We finished eating and doing everything around 10pm at the restaurant. Unbelievable. Never coming back again."
Alexys E.,"Antioch, CA",80,334,325,2.0,9/9/2017,"I mean y'all already know how these types of places go. It's a hit or miss. Weekend day with big families waiting for a table but if you're a table of 2 odds are you'll be taken quickly. This was the case of Scott and I. First table by the door. Anyone who knows me knows I hate when my appetizer comes with my entrée. So what happens? Our calamari came with our split Parmesan crusted chicken entree at the same time. Not only did the calamari come with our entrée, but it also came stone cold. Our waitress wasn't even the one to deliver our food. So, I'm left to believe the calamari was sitting at the window and she never gave it to us or the cooks just have cold calamari waiting to be served. Either way is unacceptable. Yet, the entree was hot. Pizookie was the saving grace. Oh BJ's, why you do dis?!"
Diane W.,"San Jose, CA",44,388,297,3.0,11/15/2017,Large menu with plenty of options.   Food is what you would expect at a chain restaurant. My husband had the Enlightened Ahi Salad which he really enjoyed.   I had the Peruvian Quinoa Salad - just ok.   Service was efficient.
Nancy T.,"Morrisville, NC",505,95,313,4.0,6/23/2017,I used to hate BJs but I have to eat my words because they've really stepped it up. I love the choices they have on their enlightened menu. The food doesn't taste like it's 500-800 calories and it's filling. Their fries are one of my faves. The staff at this location is so attentive and is always making sure you're doing okay. They also have daily specials and I believe Tuesday is $3 pizookies!! Download the app because you can put yourself on the waitlist and it'll help save time. They also have special offers and you can pay through the app and earn points!!
Jewel M.,"Cambrian, San Jose, CA",16,1,,1.0,1/4/2018,"Food is not bad, so is the stout beer we ordered, but service was terrible. Salad was served, dropped on the table, without silverware.  Had to wait quite bit (seemed a long time, when you had waited almost an hour to get a table and have order taken) before we can dig into the appetizer that was in front of us. Dessert was ordered but never came...and waiter was nowhere to be found. Should have taken the hint when he  vehemently declared chocolate was the only ice cream available...Many folks well behind us were happily getting their VANILLA ice cream melting over pizookie.  Utterly disappointed and felt like IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME...WHY DID WE EVEN GO THERE...NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Dave A.,"Campbell, CA",1,46,72,4.0,7/31/2017,"We came in on Friday at about 8 PM, the place was packed. We sat outside and had zero wait. Fantastic weather that day. *We noticed that the guy who sat us ... came back immediately and took our order, because our server was very busy. He answered our questions about the boneless chicken wings. He took our order ... then our server Sabrina came by and took the handoff. Great cust service. I had the mini pizza, BJ's fav, she had the boneless wings. Her wings were over cooked, very dark color and a little tough ... but my pizza was just right, very light and well balanced. A quick bite and it was off to see a movie. We've been to other locations (Marin County), where the service was hit or miss ... but we liked it here in Oakridge Mall. We'll probably be back."
Emily L.,"San Jose, CA",20,382,1183,1.0,10/13/2017,Why does this always happen to me!!!!!! I love this place but s**t keeps happening. The hh is great and the servers are friendly but omg. I came last week and there was a sticker in my food !!!! They only took it off the bill no sorry no nothing. They asked if I wanted another queso dip... no thank you. I lost my appetite after that.
Mario M.,"San Jose, CA",32,55,59,4.0,12/9/2017,"had the best customer service experience.  frankie is new as a waiter and was able to give us a good reccomendation on the beer selection.  we had the avocado wraps, not my favorite.  do not like warm avocado.  otherwise beer selection was great."
Lilia G.,"Petaluma, CA",106,38,42,1.0,11/18/2017,"10 minutes without anyone acknowledging a table is not acceptable specially when it's not busy. That's what happened to me and two friends this past Thursday. The manager sat us at a booth as soon as we asked for a table and said our server would be right with us...yeah, that didn't happen! Okay, I don't mind waiting a few minutes but to have no one come by to offer at least water or ask ""have you been helped"" after sitting for 10 mins is just not okay. Multiple employees passed by and no one cared to say a word. Not until we got up and were heading out. Manager then offer to take our orders right away but I was frustrated and annoyed by that point so I said, ""no, thank you"" and proceeded out the door."
Katie W.,"San Jose, CA",1,3,2,1.0,12/22/2017,"Usually love this spot but today was a total let down. Ordered a pazookie for pick up--they couldn't find our order, proceeded to give us the wrong order. Finally got everything figured out and found nothing but a disappointing burnt crusty cookie thrown in the bag with forks. How do you eat ice cream with a fork? No napkins. Messy car."
Amber V.,"San Jose, CA",0,68,5,1.0,11/3/2017,"We checked in tonight, the idiot girl checking people in said ""it's a 20 minute wait"", we waited... and waited... and waited. I asked her, ""hey we've been waiting for 40 minutes?"" Looks at the list, ""Oh ya it'll be just a few more minutes""  So we waited... and waited again. Keep in mind everyone else is getting seated. I thought maybe these people were ahead of us and just walked around the mall, whatever. I got so upset, I asked the guy next to her and he was like ""hmmm... your name isn't on the list"" Wow I was on fire at that point. I mean cmon you aren't curing cancer you're checking people in to be seated at a restaurant!  Never going back... -5 stars.  Done with this place."
Audrey M.,"San Jose, CA",106,187,214,3.0,3/6/2017,"This place is definitely a 3-star establishment. Always long waits to get seated, served on, and to get your mediocre food. Our service is usually friendly, but kitchen is always backed up it seems.  There are some pros to this place though. They do have a great selection of cocktails and beers, and there is something for everybody on the menu.  They have deep dish personal pizzas, which are actually pretty freaking amazing! I might be back just for these.  Of course they have great desserts too...everybody loves a pizookie! The baked beignet is pretty delicious as well. Overall, it's a pretty good place to go to if you have large groups or are looking for someplace convenient to go to around Oakridge Mall."
Yoceline B.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,5,1.0,9/10/2017,"Seriously , I ordered the pizookie trio as my ""birthday cake"" cause I don't like cake . And well imagine my joy when I opened up the containers and saw this  Great job Bjs , one happy birthday girl over here"
Marlene B.,"San Jose, CA",176,143,219,3.0,11/2/2017,Our server was great for late night happy hour in bar area. I was pleasantly surprised because other times I've been to this location haven't been so good. Late night happy from 10pm closing is great deal.
David N.,"San Jose, CA",5,112,168,3.0,10/19/2017,"I gave up on their generic bar food shortly after the place opened a few years ago, but heard they revamped the menu and wanted a decent draft beer while at the mall for lunch so gave it another shot. The Hop Storm IPA was the best part of the meal. I had the lunch special BACON-GUACAMOLE DELUXE BURGER, for which I'll review the elements: Bun: Very good lightly toasted brioche-style bun. Chipotle mayo: Far too little of it squirted on the underside of the top bun. Guacamole: About 1/3 of it was dark and rotten. Applewood smoked bacon: Didn't taste any smoke flavor and it wasn't thicker than regular bacon as it should have been. It was also old and not hot enough, clearly having been made long before the burger. Red onions, tomatoes and jalapeños: They were under the burger, but too mushy and sparse as compared with the menu photo. Pepper jack cheese: Didn't see or taste any pepper - it just looked like monterey jack. It was also cold and not melted onto the burger at all. Burger: Decently seasoned and cooked medium as I asked, but it's definitely low quality beef. Not sure how to accurately describe its texture and mouth feel but chewy, dense and slightly sinewy come to mind. Also clearly smaller than the one pictured on the menu. Fries: Okay-tasting and crispy but barely warm and about half the amount pictured on the menu. Overall not a bad deal for $10 but I think the kitchen has execution, temperature, and material quality issues to address."
Ismael C.,"San Francisco, CA",31,1,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Long story short . I asked for water and they gave me sink water ""unpurified "" and took a hour to bring a my fork lol"
Zachary A.,"San Jose, CA",232,13,10,1.0,12/21/2017,My friend and I came in tonight for dinner since I am back from an overseas tour. We came in and got our table immediately. And within minutes someone came by with water and said they would be back soon. After 30-45 minutes of waiting for someone to come and take our orders (we asked for servers) we got up and left. The manager did try to get us to stay but at that point I had already had a bad taste in my mouth. I grew up in the area and loved eating at BJs. If it was busy tonight I would have understood. But it was not.
Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2304,3723,3.0,11/29/2016,"2nd time dining here, and on a rainy Saturday, the service was beyond subpar. We were seated by the hostess, but the booth seats were dirty, and had to ask for it to be wiped down before seating. My friend and I went with the 2 for $25 deal which included 2 salads (the salad we chose - mozzarella and tomato, wasn't on the menu?) , a medium pizza and a pizookie. I ordered a soda, friend had a hot water. Our salads came and when we finished, we pushed our salad dishes to the side, but never got picked up. Our pizza came and I asked for a refill on our drinks and ranch, and 15 minutes later, still nothing. Finally flagged down our waiter and he brought it back when we were pretty much done with our meal. Salted caramel pizookie is missing the salty touch, but good regardless. Overall, the service here is the worst out of all the local BJ's, and would only come if it was my last choice."
Rupa S.,"Malvern, PA",140,227,98,5.0,5/17/2017,Their Pizookies are absolutely amazing... If you have a sweet tooth like me and my friend - you will probably end up loving it as much as we did... specially their triple chocolate is just amazing...  The food was kinda blah but the dessert is totally worth going to BJ's...
Benny H.,"San Jose, CA",2026,1460,8032,4.0,11/6/2016,"I also find it funny that the chain restaurants have an average of three stars. It's like a prerequisite. They have to have three stars average!  However, I actually like this place. Staff can be a bit of dumb dumb's at the entrance, but the service is normally pretty good. The bar staff also needs to hurry up as there seems to always be a delay.  However, they were able to make the grilled burger melt for me, which is no longer on the menu, which gives them a lot of bonus points. It's amazing! Also, they have one of the stronger Long Island ice tea's in the business of big restaurants. It's really good and strong. Makes you grow hair on your arms.  Overall, I'm a BJ's fan and this place is no exception."
Jennifer N.,"San Jose, CA",228,145,42,1.0,4/20/2017,"New menu, new stuff. Didn't have their blackened chicken Cajun pasta but the kitchen was able to recreate it for it which was really good.  I'm pissed because I ordered their ""new"" nachos? (Not new btw)... it says it comes with: beans, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo, jalapeños and avocado all for $10.95. I've ordered   from here previously and I raved about it. Ordered and this is literally what I got on my so called half-ass nachos.  Chips, unmelted cheese, chopped tomatoes, olives and green onion and sprinkled on Cilantro WHAT THE ?!?!?  First off it wasn't even PICO DE GALLO. Secondly they're missin half of the ingredients and lastly there wasn't even mention on olives?  Last time I'm coming here.  Manager also had the nerve to say oh avocado doesn't necessarily mean it's on it it's extra.. for your viewing pleasure I included the menu directly from their website and what I saw in person for you see that avocado isn't ""EXTRA"" it's included along with the other toppings that were missing."
Timothy N.,"San Jose, CA",108,63,48,4.0,10/24/2016,"If this was a dessert place with their pizookies I would give them 5*s for that alone. It was that good and I can't believe I haven't had a pizookie before. I'd come back just for that. Nonetheless, they are a restaurant and so there are other things to judge. This placed is packed on weekends and that really sucks but if going on a weekday most likely you'll be seated immediately which is nice. One really minor thing I saw and that I see noted in other reviews is that I felt like I was interrupting the front staff when we came in and I totally understand talking during down times as its normal in any job, but perhaps there can be a way to be both productive as well as socializing with co workers instead of just having a little circle with backs against the door.  I don't remember our waitress' name unfortunately but she was really attentive to our needs and always checking up on us as well as being enthusiastic even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant yet which is always a plus as having superb people skills regardless of it being busy or not is important.  For appetizers, Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. Now let me say I dislike Brussel Sprouts normally and that summed up my first bite. I took a random one off the side and I didn't see any difference from a normal Brussel Sprout. Turns out the sauces on the bottom wasn't in the particular area that I took my Sprout from so I was missing out and just eating a plain Brussel Sprout. After noticing that, the Brussel Sprout in the actual Honey Sriracha sauce is actually pretty good without being too overwhelming or filling to prevent me from eating my entree. Now for entrees I mainly wasn't that impressed because I didn't really see anything special in my deep dish ziti. It was good no doubt about that and the garlic knot was an awesome add on as well but I wasn't just super into it.  Overall desserts are bomb and pretty much the one reason I'd come back and makes this review a 4* versus 3* as I'd personally have it around 3.5 if I could."
Alexis R.,"Oakland, CA",7,17,18,4.0,3/27/2017,"I come here fairly often with my hubby for a pazookie. Most recently we came for dinner and most late Thursdays this place is pretty mellow but last Thursday this place was packed! We decided to sit at the bar since its open seating. Found a place really quick no issues. We went for their happy hour specials, I got a personal pizza and he got the burger which he had got before and was happy with.  Food took a little longer than usual which was expected. My pizza was fine. Hubby's burger was a little over cooked and it didnt have any thousand island dressing on it. The fries were also cold and in short supply.  We let our waitress stephanie know and she took care of everything she got a fresh plate of fries and grabbed the thousand island dressing. She was attentive the whole night and she was able to multitask perfectly. Thanks for the good service stephanie!"
Mac C.,"San Jose, CA",6,67,62,1.0,10/12/2017,"The staff here just doesn't care about their customers. So many times we tried to flag down servers to help us out. Even spoke to people that weren't servers who were just laughing and speaking with each other not caring about their customers at all. Others were on their cell phones again not caring about their customers. And when we tried to get their attention it was as if we were disturbing them! Look you are here to do a job. If you don't like your job, don't do it! But don't male a family wait for 15-20 mins without acknowledging them! We waited so long for our waitress. She even left the check three times as she passed by not taking the check with the cash already on it! Three times! She forgot that she even left us a check the other two times and they aren't even that busy! The waitress couldn't even find change for us. She stated she was trying to find change. Really?!? Wait...you are a restaurant right? How do you make a customer wait for change of all things... Bj's have definitely reached an all time low! I remember when this place used to have great service and food. Now the people here do not care.  MODIFIED: The incessant rude messages I was receiving from other employees and people commenting was slightly getting off point. So I modified this review to bring it back to its main focus.  A servers job is difficult. I'll give you that. I myself used to work as a server at Pizza Hut when they used to host people. But customers sitting waiting to be served while ignored by staff for over 20 mins upon entry and at 15-30 mins during the the meal at different times I may add is unacceptable! Period.  This is to all the employees here, if you are one of the few that do treat their customers with respect and attention then you are one of the lucky few...To the rest, if the people here don't enjoy their job and feel as if every time a customer asks for something that they are being disrupted, please go and find a job in a place that allows you not to be customer facing."
Ann N.,"San Jose, CA",185,396,873,3.0,11/10/2016,"We were at the booth in the bar area.  We didn't order entrees but overall, still very good.  Service was attentive, they have ahi poke!!!, potstickers and pizza. All pretty good and came out pretty fast.  If it's ur bday, mention it and a small dessert comes out just for you :)."
Marcia S.,"San Jose, CA",49,31,22,4.0,7/10/2017,"Very impressed with BJ's today. 1/2 off pizzas = every Monday! I ordered  the TAVERN cut garlic pesto chicken ! Thin crust, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, whole ""fun"" size garlic cloves, yummmmy And my drink : Jerry's Berry Burst blend = berry cider and Jeremiah Red ale  Good service, great food and drink, not too crowded"
Evan N.,"Blossom Valley, San Jose, CA",0,3,2,5.0,11/7/2017,"About a week ago I was picked up food from this restaurant and when I was walking back to my car I thought I left my keys in the restaurant but I left them in the car and only one employee went out to help me look for them and that great person was Max(I believe). He saw that my keys were in the car and he went back to grab some miscellaneous items to see if it will unlock my car, and it took some time but he unlocked my car and I just want to say that he went beyond what anyone would normally do, he stood out from everyone that day and I just want to say thank you."
Kimbria F.,"San Jose, CA",176,8,,5.0,12/16/2017,Shout out to Devon and Andrea for hooking us up last night with a table faster than expected. It was a graduation dinner and we were all starving for BJs. Service was fantastic and the food was delicious. Thank you again Devon and Andrea!
Bert G.,"San Diego, CA",82,609,444,4.0,2/10/2017,"Our party of four was in the mood for Happy Hour beers and snacks.  BJ's hit the spot ! Nobody had any problem with the beer discounts offered and the interesting HH menu.  Our beers were delivered promptly, cold, and fresh.  The food came after a short wait and was certainly as good as anticipated.  The Honey Sriracha Sprouts ($6.50) were out of this world good.  The mini pizzas and burgers were certainly up to specs for HH food. Oddly, we had three servers during our stay, which was about an hour or so.  However, the receipt says ""Stephanie"", so thanks for the good service."
Melanie S.,"Seven Trees, San Jose, CA",176,123,275,4.0,4/15/2017,"BJ's is always changing their menu. It is one of Amanda and my go to restaurant at oakridge. Whatever you are feeling or craving, they will most likely have or a version of it. All of the food is good here! I gave it a four out of five because sometimes the food does come a little greasier than I would like. Dessert can be totally the only reason you come to BJ's and I would be completely fine with it. If you have not had a pizookie, you are missing out on life. They are pizza size cookies with vanilla ice cream on top. They always come out warm and they have never steered me wrong, these pizookies come with different flavors so I do suggest the trio if you can share with someone. That way you can taste multiple flavors at once."
Celine L.,"San Jose, CA",22,225,341,2.0,2/15/2017,"Went here for Valentine's Day after dinner to get drinks. Very long wait unless you sit at the bar which is first come first serve. There's a huge selection of beers but the drinks here are not always consistent. My strawberry mojito barely had any rum in it so I don't feel like it was worth the price. We also ordered the Pazookie trio and we picked the white chocolate macadamia nut, chocolate chip, and salted caramel cookie. All topped with vanilla ice cream. It was enough for 4 people to eat. However, One of our cookies was pretty burnt and we could taste the charred cookie even with ice cream and caramel all over it. The service was subpar and the hostess seemed to be in a hurry to get us out although my friend still wanted another drink.... Probably will only come here for Pazookie."
Marcella R.,"San Jose, CA",21,22,11,5.0,9/28/2017,Their pizzas are so good. The place is always busy. I can't wait to try some other food. Great General Manager. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.
Aiden N.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,1,,1.0,11/21/2017,"This place makes you wait for hours!! It's absolutely sickening, especially when the food costs so much to begin with! I keep waiting and waiting and believe me, the food never came until an hour later. We waited longer for the dessert. Sickening!!"
Sanjose K.,"San Jose, CA",5,171,7,2.0,6/15/2017,"Ugh- every time we go here I keep hoping it will be a better experience, and it just ISNT!!!!!! We were sat outside, but apparently this is where all employees also take their break, even if customer are dining. On their break, they talk loudly, watch YouTube videos loudly, laugh at the videos loudly, and swear. I really dont care how anyone spends their break- it's their BREAK!- but when its literally at the table next to us when we're on our first date in 6 months, it is awful.  The service was slow, despite not being very full, and it took forever to get checked on after we got our food. The Brussels sprouts were rock hard and very under cooked. The rib eye was good, nd the sweet potato fries were average. Overall it was a disappointing experience for the cost."
Paige B.,"San Jose, CA",39,225,47,1.0,10/22/2016,"One star for wait list service, not necessarily food. We recently signed up for an on line account with BJ's and took advantage of their ""wait list sign in"". It informed us that there was a 45"" wait. We arrived at 3 minutes prior to that wait time expiring, having put my name in at 2000, we arrived at 2042. I informed the host of our name and he said he had us ""checked in"". I asked how long we might now expect to wait, and he said it would be 30 minutes! He then proceeded to show me his wait list screen and told me there ""were lots of people ahead"" of me. On the list, there is a phone icon next to names that have made online wait list requests. There were none of these ahead of our name. Only walk ins. What a horrible on line system. To be fair, the online system does state there will be a wait time as you arrive, so I expected a 15"", or even 20"", being Friday night, extension. I fail to see the point of having an online system at all however, if my walk in time will be the same as my online wait list time and time estimate given. Utter customer service failure before I've even engaged your restaurant. Your location lost business from us for sure and I warn all guests against using the system or becoming an online member of BJ's.  On that point, please see the photo if our receipt from the brand new Japanese restaurant next door to you in the mall and subtract this from your evening revenue."
