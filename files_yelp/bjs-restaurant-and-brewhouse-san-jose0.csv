Ken L.,"San Jose, CA",84,33,24,5.0,8/26/2015,"I haven't been here in a few years, and am very glad that I returned. The menu selections are very broad, and I appreciate listing the calories for those who need to think about that when ordering. I ordered one of their beers (Temple of Stone IPA), which is a must, and was not disappointed. I can see coming here just for the beer. Anyway, my main course was the House Top Sirloin, which was the perfect size, and I appreciated the nice selection of sides from which to choose (I opted for the wedge salad and roasted brussels sprouts). We'll be back, and intend to come here for dinner more often. Great selection, great food, and reasonable prices. Oh, and I paid with the Android app, which gave us a 20% discount (offer valid through 2015-08-31). Even without the discount, the app made it so easy to pay our bill."
Amber L.,"Stanford, CA",1,383,112,3.0,6/15/2014,"BJ's is clearly a place you go to to hang out with friends and not worry about the kids or have a couple of beers with friends.  The food is ok, par for the course not good, not terrible just ok.    They have ok service, but given the size of the place and the number of people kinds of what you'd expect.  The wait staff is average, not awesome but not great.  The food is average, not awesome not great.  The venue is nice, relaxing and easy to hang out in.   That is why we go to BJ's."
Maricella G.,"San Jose, CA",11,11,5,1.0,5/18/2015,"Usually when I come here I get pretty good service....well depending what time it is and what servers are there. The last time I went in my girlfriend stood in front waiting for someone to come ask us how many to be seated for about 10min (we were the only ones standing there) finally a guy who was standing on the other side starring at the booths closest to the bar comes over and sits us and lets us know out waiter will be over soon. So we sit down and behind us is a group of 3 which we noticed the waiter (who ends up being ours) is walking back and forth to their table conversating with them and what not. He finally decides to come over to our table and take our order... now with my girlfriends plate she asked for mashed potatoes instead of rice and asparagus instead of broccoli. I had a feeling he wasnt even listening because he was so concerned with the table behind us.  Sure enough when our food came out there was broccoli instead of asparagus. Not to mention we're sitting there for about 15min with no silverware. We then noticed that  of the guys who clean thr table's was actually friends with the table behind us. Just to clear up our waiter and other guy, the other guy was philipino or asian im not sure and our waiter was a very tall whitr guy who knees down when taking our order. Both young. So the asian guy takes New silverware to the table behind us and starts talking to them and my girlfriend hears them tell him ""no we dont need silverware "" so our waiter 15min later realizes we dont have anything to eat our food with and go gets silverware. We then tell him we didn't want broccoli but asparagus. So he goes to the back puts in the order then comes back when we're half way done with our meal. (But not to mention he was back and forth ""checking"" on his co-workers, friends table just ignoring ours)  We finish eating and again like the whole night we hear him behind us talking to his co-workers friends and telling them ""I'll get you one of each of the pizokis (i believe their called) and comp it.... it's all of ur bdays today""  He comes to our table ohhh some time later takes our dessert order then leaves. He later passes by our booth and takes the table their dessert. They then leave and are all by the walk way to the bar saying by hugging etc.  He then comes to our table like 10min later and says ""we're remaking ur pizoki because the cook burned it"" we finally get it finish get our check and notice that he charged us for the asparagus  even though it was his mistake and we didn't eat the broccoli. We were so irritated and mad that we didnt even feel like arguing over some damn asparagus. So how nice we get terrible customer service, amd charged extra for something that was suppose to substitute something else. But bravo to him for looking out for his friends behind us and giving them all free dessert because he's ganna pretend its all their birthday. Where was the floor manager when all of this was happening... no where to be found! I work in a concierge office and my girlfriend is a manager for customer service so yeah from this point of view management lets their waiters do what ever they want and treat their friends great and their customers like crap!"
Hans S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/12/2016,Waiters are drenched in perfume. Manager says they do not have a policy on employees wearing scents.  My food tastes like the Macy's fragrance department.
Anthony A.,"San Jose, CA",1,26,8,1.0,7/26/2014,I told the waiter I just ate an hour ago and I just wanted some chips and salsa. He said no problem and he charged me $6.50. Probably costed them 50 cents to make tops.  Another time I came they gave me horrible service. I got the soup and salad combo unlimited and then the waiter completely ignored us (probably because  she thought we were just teenagers and she thought we weren't going to tip her well ). Every time we wanted to place another soup or salad it was another 30 minute ordeal. we spilt our soda and a half our later she comes and she kicked the ice under the table and told us to not tell her manager. Are you kidding me? She acted like it was normal or no big deal. Ya now I'm not going to give you a tip!
Kristen R.,"San Jose, CA",34,7,,2.0,8/16/2015,"It was almost as if every employee took a bong hit before their shift started. Everyone moved at a snail pace and had to be asked multiple times for things.  Our waitress was nice but we had to ask 4 times for a box, 3 times for water, and 2 times for plates for our appetizer and those were never brought. Our appetizer was ordered significantly before our entree and only came out a few minutes before and nothing was hot, just warm. You know it's bad when a mozzarella stick is basically just a breaded piece of string cheese that doesn't move when you bite into it. Also, after ordering eggs, she came back and said they don't do poached. I found this weird that an establishment that makes eggs can't do a basic style. It was almost as if the high chefs just didn't know how to make that style and I pictured everyone in the back trying to look it up on google.  Mediocre at best."
Jill V.,"Sequim, WA",153,160,132,3.0,6/22/2014,"As a rule I avoid chain restaurants unless there is one item in particular that is consistently fresh and wholesome. I mean really-any restaurant whose menu is comprised of like TEN pages representing over 150 menu items that can be thrown together and served in less than 15 minutes? With that said, I avoid such restaurants because the food quality is often lacking.  But  BJ's southwest salad is practically perfect. The chicken is real, the greens are fresh romaine, and one serving is not too little or too much-it's just right.   So when I travel I go to BJ's-it doesn't disappoint."
V V.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,1,5.0,1/1/2017,Had a great experience with my family with Biagio as our server! Loved our New Years pizookie!
Diana C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/15/2017,"My boyfriend and I came here tonight for some dinner and naturally, for a Sunday night, it was very busy. It took an hour to be seated and another hour to finally receive our food. Initially my boyfriend and I were a bit upset for the long wait but the manager, Amanda, completely redeemed our experience. Not only was she apologetic and professional, she provided us with exceptional customer service skills by not charging us for the two entrees that came out late. She also went out of her way to get me some extra marinara sauce for my spaghetti when I mentioned how it tasted a bit bland. Our server was also polite and apologetic about the wait as well. Overall thank you Amanda for your excellent service. We will be back soon."
Alicia L.,"San Jose, CA",61,3,5,1.0,3/4/2016,Seriously bad service from just arriving today's date is 3/4/16 7pm The hostess at the door was not doing a good Job at all there was a huge circle around her people where pushing each other to try to get a seat all she said was 1 hour wait. We decided to wait and then one guy came up 20 minutes after us shook the guy hostes hand and he got a seat cause he knew him I'm angry... On top of that they didn't have eyes on walk in customers that as soon as a table got up and left they decide to seat themselves! Seriously just terrible service.  I left came to olive garden and got a table less then 20 mins and just sat down and got the text from bjs .... I waited 1 hour plus... Smh
Kevin Sr B.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,20,4.0,1/16/2016,"The wait was over 30 minutes while we sat and watched empty tables not being used and waitstaff standing around not working. The wait time is obviously understandable for a Saturday night, but the standing around and not working is unexcusable for any night. However once we were seated our server Richard was very attentive and quick with our orders even on a busy night. One of our favorite spots and we are looking forward to our next trip."
Kaycee M.,"San Jose, CA",56,13,,4.0,7/28/2016,"I came here with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised, I order the homestyle fried chicken, which was fabulous, while my friends mostly had pasta dishes which they said they had enjoyed. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place, while it was very busy it didn't feel crowded and you don't feel exposed to the mall crowd and it was also very clean. I am planning on returning very soon."
Pradeep T.,"San Jose, CA",6,13,,4.0,6/22/2016,"The restaurant is very well located,  right in the mall and well decorated.  We wanted to be seated outside and the wait was not long.  The waitress was also very kind and suggestive.  We ordered an avacado egg role to begin with. The dish was not great,  but didn't ruin or expectations either. Next we ordered a deep dish vegetarian pizza. Finally,  we went for a white chocolate pizookie. This was simply mind blowing,  although i would have preferred the lesser sweetness in the cookie. Overall,  i would recommend this place any day"
Martan A.,"Fraser, MI",17,66,185,4.0,5/11/2016,Here on a trip for work with a co-worker.    We both got the deep dish pizzas and they were very good.  Also tried the beer sampler.  Our server was very good and attentive.
Chloe D.,"San Jose, CA",2,34,13,5.0,11/7/2015,Very good and fast service! I fell in love with their new root beer glazed wings! It is soooo tasty!!! I will come back to get some more!
Stephy L.,"San Jose, CA",225,205,246,4.0,7/11/2014,"Their pazookies are amazzzing! I absolutely the original which is the chocolate chip flavor. There is a new flavor - salted caramel. I am not really a fan of it because it was too salty. There are some good spots but it was uneven. They did not add the caramel drizzle on top as shown in the picture. The red velvet is decent, but too sweet. Either way it's worth a treat!  I also love their wings here. Crispy and comes with two sauces, one hot and ranch. The deep dish pizza are delicious here (the great white, which is alfredo) and their calzones.  Overall their food is delicious. However, I was not a fan of their Summer Splash drink. It was too slushy, icy for my taste. The strawberry puree was good but after a while it went away and made my drink all sour."
Bella P.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,1,4.0,1/11/2016,"My family and I used to come here often in the past, but since they removed the ""teriyaki chicken"" from the menu, my father hasn't wanted to come here that much anymore. On Sunday, my family and I decided to go again. First, we came in and asked for a booth of 4, according to the employees, the wait was going to be 40 minutes! They were some people waiting, and as we were waiting, their was about 1-3 booths unseated, which was really annoying. After about 15-20 minutes, we got our table.  Although I love the food, the service can be good (not great or bad) to not good at all. This time, service was good. I had the ""baked ziti"" and it was absolutely delicious! Additionally, since a football game was occuring while we entered, the place was quite loud. Pros: - Fantastic Food - Pleasant atmosphere - Good beers (I have never consumed and alcohol  in my life, but people say the beer is good) - Lots of TV's! Cons: - Can be noisy at times - Service can be absolutely horrible at times - Long wait Overall, this place is good for large groups and/or for people who want to hang out at the bar and watch a game. The service can be mediocre, but the food is very tasty."
Charles Z.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,1,4.0,1/19/2016,I went here on Monday 1-18-2016 with my daughter to celebrate her 22nd Bday It was busy for a Monday so we waited 30 minutes to be seated our server was Kelly They were under staffed so service was slow and Kelly did her best to take care of us our Avocado roll appetizer came way after our dinners did we had Ribeye steaks which were very good so after getting the appetizer late Kelly let us have them at No charge which was a good touch then Kelly went a step above and included dessert for the both of us at No charge I will say Kelly going above and beyond on her own really made up for the slow service it made a possible bad night into a great Bday celebration for my daughter we will be going back to BJ's in the future and hats off to Kelly who knows how to provide Great customer service..
Jennifer K.,"San Jose, CA",19,33,21,1.0,2/18/2015,"FIRST TIME HERE &NEVER COMING BACK.  Came here last night around 7:30PM for a hang out. The wait wasn't that long considering that it was on a weekday. I came here with 3 of my friends, a total of 4. The wait was about 15 minutes. We were seated promptly to our seats and greeted friendly by a waiter. He was nice, but seemed very shy. You could tell by his tone and loudness of his voice. It wasn't too pleasant. We ordered right away since we were super hungry. I ordered the California Burger.  The wait for the food took quite long. We all ordered burgers, so it shouldn't take that long. But it did. It took about a good 35 minutes for the food to even come!  After our food came, our waiter apologized to us that his shift was off and he has someone else which was a lady. We were NOT greeted by her nor were we TREATED well. I felt as if since my group was young age, 18, she didn't want to waste her time. I felt very offended by that. I mean I'm a waitress too, I totally understand, but she has to be more mature and literally act more professional! Plus, our first waiter who supposedly said his shift was off BUT stayed there to hang out? I don't understand. If your shift is off shouldn't you leave? Not sit there, walk around, or hang out?  Also, for the check. It was super confusing and terrible! I had to personally come up to a different waiter to ask for change and LITERALLY they said they couldn't do it. They needed to find my waitress. Wait, did I forget to mention that whenever I held my hand up for service, NO ONE CAME?! They all just stared and pretended as if they didn't know anything. How annoying. We had to wait another 20 minutes until she came back! Super ridiculous. No kidding why this place has a 3 star. I wonder why! Hopefully, a manager at this restaurant reads this and trains their employees better because truthfully, you just lost a customer who could have been loyal."
Ron C.,"Evergreen, San Jose, CA",143,13,22,2.0,8/9/2014,"Where do i start, how about ""No"" unless you're desperate. The seating was fine and the atmosphere was expected of a BJ's restaurant. Eating here was due to the lack of choices for pasta at 11:30 as most places close at 10. I came with a party of 3 Notes on our visit. -To-go order came before all the other food  -Utensils were given after all the food came out -Chicken is drier than death valley  -The food has more oil than the United States -Failure to refill waters (had to ask 3 waiters and all said they would get to it but missed my party for about 20-25 minutes) -Personal thing but the food looked unappetizing -Other guest notes but the ""happy birthdays"" and the singing was hella monotone and it just lacked spirit. It felt like it was a sad game  -Seriously though about the oil thing. It's like the BP oil spill all over again -The pizzokie (excuse my spelling) came out melted and ""sad"" it was quite depressing."
