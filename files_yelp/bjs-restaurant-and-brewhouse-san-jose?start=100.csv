Randy P.,"San Jose, CA",107,66,3,5.0,2/1/2017,"I just came her with my friend because he owed me dinner.  The happy hour food was amazing and the happy hour shots were only $5.  We had an amazing waitress named Mollary M at the bar area.  She had amazing customer service and was really nice to us.  I told my friend to tip her 50% because she was a great waitress but he ended only tipping her 15%!  I didnt know this until I went outside.  So, if you're reading this, I apologize for that!! I'll make sure you get the right amount of tip that you deserve next time I come.  I hope at least your manager reads this."
Paula D.,"San Jose, CA",9,39,1,5.0,10/4/2016,"Always a great place for dinner whether it's with the little kids (delicious kid's chicken strips!) or adults only enjoying a frosty glass of their crafted beers, there's something for every palate. My salmon quinoa was cooked perfectly, the pizzas were awesome, and the crispy asparagus appetizer was the bomb! Tonight, Biagio was our man! Our water/tea/sodas were refilled several times, our every request was taken care of quickly (more sauce, etc.) and he was very personable and professional. We can't wait to come back!"
Karen M.,"San Jose, CA",13,87,4,1.0,3/5/2017,"Came here last night with a party of 7 people and was told wait is around an hour to 90 mins. The text message we got on the phone was 40 mins so we figure we'll wait while we walk around the mall. An hour in, we went to check to see if we are close and they told us they had us down for 4 instead of 7 people! How the hell did that happen? I have no clue but my guess is they are busy and the people that are working could care less. So even though they made a mistake they told us it'll be another 90 mins. At this point we told them to cancel it and we walked off. Ended up eating at the food court because we are now starving. Bjs have decent food, I mean but nothing worth waiting that long for. I am very disappointed in the host staff. Won't be returning since there are so many good food places in the bay."
Jodi N.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,9,,5.0,5/14/2017,Jenoveva was terrific!!! Such a great time and she accomidated all our needs! She was super fun and attentive. We appreciated her service.
Alisia V.,"Orlando, FL",110,202,139,3.0,1/21/2016,"Ok, so the service was a little off but she was very pleasant about it which to me makes a huge difference.  I had the appetizer root beer ribs and the saracha Brussels sprouts. Both very yummy and just the right size without being overly filling. Now the highlight of this visit was my cucumber jalapeño margarita. Ok the 2 jalapeño cucumber margaritas. Soo yummy and light and what a great way to get your veggies. I gotta try the basil watermelon margarita next time."
Manda Bear B.,"San Francisco, CA",4225,1783,48436,3.0,10/3/2015,"***************************** 1416 ***************************   Happy hour is happening here on a game night. The $8.95 unlimited salad and soup for lunch is good. However, their soups are often salty and the salads are over-dressing. I usually ask the dressing on the side.     Service is usually good here but super slow at lunch time. I think they don't want us to order more soup and salad, so they took their time..."
Anthony D.,"North Valley, San Jose, CA",0,4,,4.0,8/4/2016,"I stopped by this place a few months ago and was very impressed with my server.  His name was Bruk. After coming in and ordering our food, our group was met with a longer wait for food than usual. Bruk approached us and offered us free dessert as an apology. The food was great and service was top notch. I will stop by again."
Mike L.,"San Jose, CA",30,17,,3.0,1/30/2017,I was here last week for the NFL conference championship games. Good crowd on hand. Food is okay.
Maleah M.,"San Jose, CA",966,605,4671,2.0,2/27/2015,"Pizookie: a warm small pie sized cookie topped with ice cream. You can only get this at bjs. You can definitely make these at home, but it's convenient to buy it already made.  Other than the pizookie, nothing else stands out here. The pastas, the pizza's, everything is just okay. Go somewhere else for dinner then grab a pizookie here for dessert."
Joelyn C.,"San Jose, CA",24,15,1,1.0,12/23/2016,"I would give a zero if I had the chance. I came with my lido family to have a nice dinner but got very very poor customer service!! My waiter name was Caesar and at first was giving Us amazing customer service but all of a sudden after  he took out order, we were neglected!! Once the food came came out like we were invisible. My husband order the sirloin steak and with potatoes and wedge fries . ther steak it was really tiny and the fries never came out when we were looking for the waiter to ask if that's how it was supposed to be he was no where in so sight. My husband told me to just ignore because he has work in the restaurant industry before. But then when I saw the young gentleman leave the front door is when I was upset: we sat and waited to see if any one was going to come And help us and we just decided to just eat it and go. About 20 minutes after a young lady came and said she was taking over Caesar tables. And we ask for a box to go. Got the box  and again waited for the another 10 Minutes.when it came For us to get a check no one ever came. My husband went to the front end and ask for The check! I will for sure not b coming to this bjs ever again!!"
Jamie P.,"San Jose, CA",573,20,117,2.0,1/3/2017,"Usually my experience at this bjs is pretty mediocre, but this last time my server was not the best unfortunately. Don't come here after 10:30 pm and expect good service!"
Paul W.,"Mountain View, CA",14,166,,5.0,12/12/2016,"My particular experience here deserves five stars, though to be fair, I didn't come in during a typically busy time, but on a Saturday at 11AM pretty much as soon as the place opened (though when we left an hour later, there was a considerable wait list). That said, they did an absolutely superb job both on food and service.  I asked if they could make their jambalaya without onions, and they did, while also making sure to take a backup order from me in case what I asked for could not be done.  The jambalaya...absolutely great.  Plenty of proteins in it, with the right amount of heat and flavor.  And so much of it that I couldn't finish it all.  I don't usually take leftovers home, because most of the time I eat up all the ""good bits"" at the restaurant, or else it's just not quite a good enough meal I wish to repeat.  But I made an exception in this case...it was that good, and still had a lot of meat left in it after I'd eaten my fill, that I wanted to take the rest home...and actually was looking forward to eating the rest the next day.  And it was just as good.  They did a great job on the service as well, checking on us repeatedly to make sure our drinks stayed filled...important for the jambalaya dish because of the heat. I'll be coming back here very soon to eat the great dish again, and am eager to try the other stuff as well."
Dan M.,"Milpitas, CA",248,9,1,5.0,2/28/2017,We had Paul and he was awesome so sweet and accommodating gave us great suggestions and at the end had our checks all split without even having to ask!!!
Jayar T.,"Milpitas, CA",0,4,1,5.0,3/22/2017,Katie was a great server RECIEVED great service!!!!! Had a good dinner and a good night thanks!!!
J I.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,13,10,1.0,6/4/2016,"I knew I shouldn't have came back, but here I am... There was no silverware on the table when we got our appetizer. I asked the waiter and he responded w ""oh they didn't give it to you"" and went to get it... Why would I ask you for it in the first place. He continues to proceed with a dumb comment ""you guys are the first people I've seen to eat calamari with a fork.."" Ok maybe if your calamari wasn't disgustingly greasy I wouldn't need one. I will not be tipping and I will be paying my bill in all $1s lol. Not coming back. Today is Saturday June 4. I get that it's busy, but I have a 0 tolerance for stupid comments made by staff."
Stacey K.,"San Jose, CA",84,10,1,2.0,11/17/2016,"My boyfriend and I come here once in a while, we always leave very satisfied with our food. Last night was a little different... my boyfriend ordered a burger and I ordered pasta. We both thought that our food tasted good. As soon as we were done my boyfriend didn't feel very well. We went home and he had a headache and a non stop fever all night. He got up around 6am to get ready for work and started throwing up. I took him to the ER because he was in so much pain. Dr told us he has food poisoning from whatever he ate last night. I think we will be staying away from this place for a while."
Lynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",214,511,2093,1.0,11/12/2014,"Came in during a giants game with my friends. We sat at a booth by the bar.  In the beginning, our sever was attentive. She took our order of drinks and an appetizer. We told her we needed a couple of minutes to look at the menu and that happened about twice.  We waited after that, about 15 minutes. We order our entrees and asked for another appetizer.  30 minutes later, we receive our entrees with the appetizer. It didn't make sense so we asked for the appetizer, you know the plate you get BEFORE, not during, your entree off the check and had them take it back.  The food was very bland and cold. The worst bjs I've been to. And the worst experience. You'd think with a franchise there would be consistent plates and service. That's not the case here. I recommend going to the Fremont location. Way better experience and food."
Nick P.,"San Jose, CA",7,46,39,1.0,9/23/2015,Curbside service is BEYOND misleading.  First off All the internet lead time said it would take 15 minutes.  I got there 20 minutes after the 15 estimation onlu to wait for 20 more minutes with a screaming toddler i. The car with a 14 yr old.  Love the food. Not curbside or DOORDASH FOR THIS RESTAURANT.  The only reason I even did curbside is because Doordash for BJS was 120 minutes. Fyi the phone orders get less prioritized! Those words are the truth.  I saw 3 people get food and pay their bill before I was even acknowledged. Go out to eat people lesson learned!  Families with small children just ixnay Bjs all together! Jesus help us!
Pat L.,"San Jose, CA",107,74,106,4.0,9/5/2015,"Went to this BJ Brewery with my sons. We were quite surprised how crowded it was but the 30 min wait was worth it.  The waiting and host staff were very friendly and had great sense of humor even though the restaurant was packed.  Our dining experience was great. The menu selection was large and had lots of variety for everyone's taste buds.  We ordered a  pizza, burger and top sirloin steak. All were good tasting and priced reasonably.  But the dessert was out of bounds - the cookie and cream Pizookie.  Go check out BJ's at Oakridge Mall."
Dylan B.,"Gilroy, CA",121,1,,1.0,10/17/2016,"I sat at the bar and got a drink by Eric the bartender late night around 10 and the drink he made tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it at all. My advice, never order from the bar when Eric is bar tending."
