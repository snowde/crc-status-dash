John Z.,"Hollister, CA",0,421,13,3.0,11/19/2007,"Went here for dinner and took about 15 minutes to get our order in but they were pretty busy so no big deal for me. Ordered a big sampler platter, a Piranha Pale Ale, and a Shrimp Pasta Entree.  The sampler platter was ok, the avocado egg rolls weren't so good but the artichoke dip was great. The beer tasted pretty good as well. The spaggetti shrimp entree I got was HUGE! I didn't finish it because I guess I filled up on the sampler, my caesar salad and the 2 big cuts of bread they give you with the entree.  The spagetti sauce seemed a bit watered down and the shrimp was so so. Dinner and the beer with the tip cost me about 40 bucks so plan to spend some money if you show up. They have tv's all over the place but they were really only playing 2 games.  Our waitress was nice and the hostess up front was nice as well. All in all 3 stars, it was just about average.  Oh and parking at this location SUCKS!"
B N.,"Alameda, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/27/2010,"The Good The Pizookie was delicious, service was good although busy.  The Bad I didn't enjoy my main course which was the fettucini alfredo. It was really dry. I asked for more alfredo sauce but that didn't really much. Granted BJ's isn't an Italian restaurant but I expected better. We were sitting outside and someone opened the gate to leave and the alarm went off. This went off for about 10 minutes before it was shut off. It didn't help that we were sitting right next to the gate."
Regina R.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,3.0,8/28/2010,"So I came here for the first time with my husband, I believe it was on a Tuesday night, then again the following night. The food was so delish!! I got the spaghetti with marina sauce n the hubby got the chicken pasta with marina sauce. I would love to give this place 5 stars but the service sucked ass!! They forgot my husbands drink, and they took FOREVER to take our order. We'll def. Be going back but they really need to do something about that terrible service."
Ron O.,"Gilroy, CA",10,125,1,1.0,5/10/2011,"We stopped in on mothers day and to our surprise we had a nut job server.  This girl was smiley and seemed friendly but she couldn't wait for us to leave.  Every time she approached us she seem very rushed.  She didnt write down my order then came back three times to verify what I wanted...not writing down orders is impressive if you get the order right and can remember it. She stopped by to ask how our food was and without even listening to our answer scurried off.  The kicker was when she took my girlfriends last bite of pizza when she cleared our plates.  She didn't bother to ask if she was finished and before we knew she was gone with it.  She quickly brought our check and said ""here is your check no rush"" and came back only a minute later to try and collect a signed copy....my girlfriend still had half a beer left !!!  That was the straw...I tipped her lousy.  It takes a whole lot to make me do that.  Even mediocre service gets 15-20% from me because I always give them benefit of the doubt. It was busy.... but no matter how busy I never expect to be rushed.  Its not like we were trying to loiter.  Her name was Sarey according to the receipt.  Beware of this cute brown haired, fake smiling, RUSHER!.  On a lighter note...l love BJs and the Drakes IPA they have there is top notch."
Mark L.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,,3.0,8/12/2010,"This review is for the Oakridge location but it can apply to the Cupertino (Deanza) location too because I found their dishes to taste the same.  I typically order the pot roast open face sandwich or the steak sandwich.  Being that this is American style, you can expect it to be very rich (fatty) and salty.  But for the price (about $9) it's reasonably good tasting.  It fills me up, which is all I ask for in this price range.   If you're on any sort of diet (low sodium or low fat), you need to turn away.  Virtually every entree on the menu is 4-digits calorie-wise.   I would say the quality of food is on par with Cheesecake factory & Chilis, and half a notch below Elephant Bar."
Britney M.,"San Jose, CA",1,32,2,5.0,5/14/2012,"Love love love this place! My fav place to eat in the world. All complaints seem to be about red meat. Hello, thats why you dont eat meat let alone red meat when you go out. If you dont mind waiting for a bit, dont expect 5 star bev hills service, and arnt the super picky type when you eat you will love it. Pizza and cyders are amazing!! I have happily waited 2 hours to eat here. If your one of those ppl who findsyourself constantly sending back food and being disapointed, stick to AAA restaurants."
jessica s.,"San Jose, CA",118,133,20,4.0,10/16/2009,pizookie is YUM haven't really tried much of anything else
Stephanie R.,"San Jose, CA",114,82,16,5.0,9/5/2009,I love this place!! Their Turkey Cobb sandwich is the best ever! And top it off with a pazookie! Their wings are amazing too! Oh and their cheeseburger pizza! Yummmmmm! Oh and Fyi meatloaf is a no no lol
Charlie L.,"San Jose, CA",7,49,,4.0,5/16/2011,"the food was sort of on the bland side, i ordered a veggie burger with thin cut fries. the fries were really yummy and crispy. the service was good since it was pretty slow when we went. the peach ice tea tasted like water though, but smelled like peach.. what a disappointment haha. 4 stars because of the red velvet pizookie!"
Pamela N.,"San Jose, CA",8,27,11,4.0,9/26/2011,"This place has a feel of a typical brewery/restaurant.  The decor is clean with an open concept plan, where the bar is the focal point of the restaurant.  They have several signature beers as well as a whole range of other beers. The food here is the usual burgers, pizzas, and pasta entrees-- typical diner food but really flavorful and delicious to eat. Their happy hour options and prices are mediocre. The must have item on the menu is their pizookie. The pizookie is soooo good I wouldn't mind having it for my meal. It comes in five different flavors. So far, I tried the cookies and cream and the white chocolate macadamia pizookie and both were extraordinarily good. The combination of the warm cakey, cookie with the cold creamy ice cream is so simple, but definitely will leave you wanting for more!!! With Bj's cool decor, great food and mouthwatering pizookie, where you can't get anywhere else, I give it a 4/5."
Jessica G.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,3.0,6/23/2012,"We've gone to this restaurant MANY times, and we love the food (especially the loaded baked potatoes); service has always been great even though the place gets packed. HOWEVER, on Mother's Day, my husband called in our order for curb-side pick up HOURS in advance.  We had plans with another family; the husband had just been badly burned in a fire -- he couldn't go out, so we were bringing dinner to them.  Well, we got there to pick up our food 5 minutes early, and it took another 30 minutes for them to get the food out to us!  It was: cold, slopped together, incomplete, and incorrect!  Definitely put a damper on my Mother's Day . . . I ordered my baked potato, and that was ALL I got! No salad, no toppings.  Gross.  They left out the applesauce sides for both of the kids' meals.  They gave us the wrong burgers. I'll never look at this restaurant the same way again . . . totally disappointed."
Zito R.,"San Jose, CA",40,272,38,5.0,12/10/2009,"Just came back from this place and had to write a review on it. We were celebrating my friend's graduation at this place. They were pretty patient with our group as we didn't come all at once. They kept coming back and asking the new comers for their drinks and if they wanted to order. I have to say the beer here is one of the best ones i've had since i went to Gordon Biersch. They have a quite selection  and had to order up a pitcher even though i didn't want to drink a lot. ^_^ The appetizers we had were the callamari and the santa fe rolls, they were really good. They were good finger food as we were drinking our brew. The service was fantastic and one of them was pretty funny. I'd say I would definitely come back to this place again and have another beer."
Cristine I.,"San Jose, CA",7,53,7,2.0,9/10/2009,"I've been to this resturant many times. The drinks are a little pricey, the food is moderate (20-30 per person), the atmosphere reminds me of a sports bar and less of a restaurant, and the crowd is young. From the times I've been here...half the time the service sucked, but I think it really depends on the server you get. I do recommend the buffalo wings and BJ's brownie. Overall, this is still a good place to have lunch or dinner with friends or a night for drinks."
Robert R.,"Concord, CA",333,736,1032,4.0,5/21/2009,"I had eaten many times and I wanted to share my most recent visit here. I took my Mother to a belated Mother's Day lunch and I was impresses with the service here. We got there around 11:30 am before the lunch rush and we were able to get parking right up front. There was no wait and we were sat right away. Which is amazing for the Westfield Shopping Plaza. We started with Wings and ordered drinks. I never had their homemade Root beer, but I decided to try it because it was too early to drink beer. The Root beer was refreshing and there was a fresh crispness to it There was also free refills. .My Mom decided on an Iced Tea and a Sandwich Combo. I ordered the Bj's. Special Sm. Pizza and a Broccoli Cheddar Soup. I love the Hot Wings here because they have a little sauce on them, and you can dip as much sauce you want because they are served with a Bleu Cheese and Wing sauce on the side. The soup was for my lil' one and was very cheesy and delicious. The pizza was the perfect size for one person. My Mom liked her Clam Chowder and California sandwich minus the Red peppers. Our waiter was attentive and everything came out on time. My only regret with this visit was that I did not get my Beer, and I did not save room for the Pizzookie. You know, the one dessert Cookie that comes out all warm with Ice cream on top. Overall visit was great and the only blemish was the Hostess did not wait for us when we were being seated. My Mom has Mobility problems, and the Hostess did not walk us. She went way ahead, of us and we had to be directed by another server."
Erica R.,"San Jose, CA",68,7,4,5.0,10/29/2007,"Beer and deep dish Chicago style Pizza = one happy stomach. They brew their own beer with tastes varying from light and refreshing to dark and satisfying. Try the beer taster!  You and your friends will find out what beer suits you. Best pizza has to be the ""Bj's favorite"", and finish off with a pazookie which is freshly made cookie with vanilla ice cream on top."
samantha f.,"San Jose, CA",1,42,2,2.0,10/8/2008,"Am not  a fan of this place, the food was mediocre and the service sucked.  i just wanted a  dam root beer refill......."
Awni T.,"Mountain View, CA",99,63,1,3.0,1/24/2009,"I love BJ's not too fond of this particular location, parking is near impossible to find, the wait is pretty long, they do however pass out pieces of pizza to keep those who are waiting from starving. Always busy which can be a good and bad thing at the same time. Anyways, great pizza, good place to watch games, and good place to go in big groups."
ken n.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,3,5.0,5/14/2010,"This place (in my opinion) has the best beer ever brewed ""Jerimiah Red""....I love that beer!! You really should try it. The food especially the potato skins..pizza are fantastic...downside...the service needs some improvement (more servers at peak hours). This is my favorite restaurant (even with service being what it is)...I have them on speed dial for San Jose, San Mateo and Elk Grove...to be able to do call-ahead-seating. Well it's my Birthday dinner tonite...guess where the family's taking me??"
Serena R.,"Jersey City, NJ",30,66,,4.0,9/18/2009,"My cousin took me here so I can taste the pizookie.  She decribed what a pizookie was before we got to the restaurant and I was like ok it's a cookie with ice cream, big freakin deal. Yeah it was a big deal.  It's was a warm soft and chewy chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top but the best was when the edges of the cookie crisped up a bit from the coldness of the ice cream.  I tried to recreate the pizookie experience at home to no avail, it just was not the same. I'm not a meatloaf person but dang BJ's has some good meatloaf."
