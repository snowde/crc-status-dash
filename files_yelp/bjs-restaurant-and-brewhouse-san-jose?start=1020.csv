cliff k.,"Georgetown, TX",13,47,10,1.0,10/23/2013,"We have been BJ loyalists for years. But the last couple years I have noticed the quality dropping and the service getting much worse. Tonight we went and waited 20 minutes after being seated to receive our drinks. Then when our order 30 minutes later it was delivered, they messed up a simple pizza order. Their process is a total mess, waiters take your order and you do not see them until they drop off the check. Your food is delivered by groups of different people that drop and run. I asked to speak to the manager, the waitress spoke to him and he never came by. He was on the phone the whole time, not a good thing for a manager! We will not be going here again. We are really picky people. Just want fair meal, fair price, fair service for a fair price. 2 out of 3 mistakes, crappy manager. Although this place gets alot of mall customers, it will only be a matter of time before the business drops off!"
ADRIAN V.,"Fremont, CA",80,15,14,4.0,7/27/2011,"first time at this location.. i was with a party of 20+ seated in a separate patio area outside the restaurant.. our waiter was awesome, always filled our drinks, very patient and helpful wit the menu.. he was always busy at our table cleaning up loose plates and garbage even though we didnt need anything at the time.. i settled on the parmasean crusted chicken w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli.. chicken was cooked perfectly, crunchy and tender not too seasoned.. but they only gave me like 6 pieces of broccoli.. hahahha.. not bad tho.. i would come back to this location.."
Angie L.,"San Jose, CA",266,59,,4.0,6/17/2009,"the mediteranean deep dish pizza, skinny cut seasoned fries and pizoookiiieee!! :] yumm! i recently moved to a house super close to oakridge and all of my housemates love going there for drinks and a good time. ergo, i now have the same love for bj's. we always end up there no matter how long and heated the ""where should we eat?/what should we do?"" conversation is. half off mini pizza's is what i live for but its almost impossible to find a table at the bar on a thurs/fri/sat night.  we always get the same server and she is a sweetheart. i cant remember her name but shes got a cutesie accent. she might be from boston? chicago? i dont know accents very well. haha but shes awesome."
Chris W.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,22,,4.0,4/8/2010,"Had lunch today at BJ's and their thin crust pizzas was AWESOME!  The Teriyaki salmon was good too, nice service and setup."
E H.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,85,4,2.0,11/29/2008,"The food took forever to come out, and when it did finally arrive the pizzas were cold.  We asked that they just pop them back in the oven for a few minutes.  Steve felt what he thought was a hair in his food, but it was dark and he had already eaten it, so we just left that alone.  But aside from that, our experience was decent enough."
Cristina C.,"San Jose, CA",1,25,,5.0,1/15/2012,Love this place. Yummy beer and food :) service is awesome even on a busy Friday night. BBQ chicken pizza is my favorite
Cindy N.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/18/2010,"I got a Yelp account today just so I could finally bitch about the most horrible experience ever! The world deserves to know!! We went to this BJ's for my little sister's 18th birthday. She booked a table for 30 a month in advance. Even so, BJ's kept changing the time on us! We originally reserved it for 6PM, but the next time we called back to give them our buffet choices, they told us it was moved to 7PM. No one called to tell us this before! On top of that, they couldn't even take our buffet choices because the manager was busy and no one else could do that. They told us they would call us back, but they never did... When we called them again closer to the day, they told us the reservation was at 6PM and that they had no record of it being at 7PM, and once again the manager was busy in a meeting so they would call us back to get our buffet choices... and once again, there was no phone call! At this point we were really fed up with the service and considered cancelling the reservation but thought that it was too close to the day (less than a week) so it would be too short notice for our guests so we didn't. The day of the reservation, someone from BJ's called us to confirm our reservation. They said it was at 7PM... again! And told us to bring some paper/form for the reservation that we didn't have and that no one had told us about before. Because of the constant change of times, only half of our invited guests were able to make it. The manager spoke to my sister, the birthday girl who made the reservation, about the lack of people as if that were her fault for overbooking or something! Even though she tried to be polite about it, we could all tell how pissed off and annoyed she was. We waited and were seated at a table for 12 even though we specifically asked for a table for 15 because a few other people were on their way. The table was outside so it was cold, but we could clearly see our table for 30 was inside... Couldn't they have just split that in half?? Our waiter was no better than the manager. He tried to be polite and friendly, but we could all tell that he had not wanted to be stuck with our group of mostly high school students. When he took our orders, he was impatient, so he only took a few orders. We waited forever before he would come back to take the rest. During the meal, he was rude in his actions, snatching plates and utensils away while glaring at some of the kids and making fun of others... Maybe he thought they were being immature for some reason and didn't like that? When my sister asked for her complimentary birthday pizookie, he was reluctant to get her one. When he finally did bring one out, the ice cream was melted, there was no singing, he just plopped it down in front of her, lit the candle, and told her to blow it out. That was it. At the end of the meal when the check came out, my brother and I had to count the cash to make sure there was enough. With that many people there all paying cash, it took a while. The waiter was impatient again and kept coming by our table to see if we were done with the check... When we were, he snatched it right out of my brother's hand, couldn't even wait for him to hand it to him. We left that night not at all satisfied with our experience. The service was absolutely horrid!!! I don't know why we didn't just walk next door to Bucca instead. Never again will any of us go to a BJ's for any reason. 15 customers gone for good. Food: 3.5 Service: -1,000,000"
Taylor S.,"Little Elm, TX",98,203,,4.0,7/5/2009,"This BJ's location is pretty busy due to the mall, and as a result is VERY loud. We went with our 1 year old and thankfully her screams were muffled, but I think she only felt the need to scream because she couldn't hear herself think. The food was good- I got the rotisserie chicken and it was moist and juicy without being greasy. My daughter got the grilled cheese and seemed happy. We didn't wait long for a table despite the fact it was a Friday night and very crowded. Service was good. My husband loves the tri-tip and the avocado egg rolls, so I'm sure we'll be back, though next time we may just get takeout. My advice? Call ahead and get on the waiting list just in case, and if you're going on a weekend, definitely spring for the mall's valet parking. It's only 6 bucks and well worth it."
Roxana S.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,4.0,2/21/2012,"Their deep fried artichokes are awesome and at $3.50 a serving, you can share with a friend. Soups are great, service friendly and fast.  Family atmosphere."
Anosha S.,"San Jose, CA",20,209,12,4.0,4/7/2009,I love coming to BJs for a nice cold glass of beer. My favorite is the Blonde. Came here last night was Mere and we both enjoyed our meals. I got the Fish tacos...they come with some chips and a side of a green mayonnaise based sauce and some salsa...mmm drip some lime on those chips...dip it in the green sauce then the salsa and your in heaven. It would taste great with a margarita! The service was great and the restaurant was packed considering our current economic state and it being a Monday.
Joelle L.,"San Jose, CA",147,68,11,4.0,9/27/2008,I love coming to BJ's for the giant baked potatos & pazookies! Never once have I been disappointed with the excellent service here. Very attentive servers all the time & very informative as well. The beer here is really good too & their berry burst cider is my favor!! Mmmm yum.
Cherry X.,"San Jose, CA",16,57,12,4.0,8/31/2008,"Great place to chill with friends. FYI if you want to avoid the wait.......they have call ahead waiting list. The food is O-K. i really like it for the drinks and appetizers, The best girlie drink it the RitaTini...mmmmm...... For the boys they have plenty of beer. My personal fav is the piranha."
Pat R.,"San Jose, CA",0,32,,4.0,10/16/2009,Very consistent and good restaurant. I haven't had a bad experience here and the service here is pretty good considering how busy this place is. One of my favorite dishes here is the Cajun Pasta and Mediterranean Pizza. Overall this is a good restaurant to go to any day of the week.
Joseph G.,"San Jose, CA",37,40,,3.0,6/3/2009,"Ok I have no idea why people like BJ's food? Especially this one. The food is not good quality. I ordered chili as a light meal and they gave me a bowl the size of a cup and charged me $5 for it, it also tasted like bad canned chili. One time I was here they ran out of pizookies, how could they run out of one of their signature dishes.This Bj's is located in Oakridge Mall so parking is nearly impossible even in the day time. The only reason I gave it three stars was because of the Bartenders, they are pretty cool and their drinks are pretty good. Only go here if you and your friends just want to drink"
Loren E.,"Solon, OH",30,19,,4.0,5/23/2009,"This is a chain restaurant, but offers great food, great beers and good value.  They also have a lunch club that is a good value.  After 7 lunches, you get one free.  This is also a great place to watch sports with many large TV screens.  Try the Piranha Pale Ale!"
Rebecca D.,"San Jose, CA",39,99,42,3.0,2/27/2009,"I've been aware of this place since it first opened, yet never went.. until last week. A friend and I had a casual Friday night, after work meal. We got there after 5 and were seated about ten minutes later, in the patio. Now there was a chill in the air but they had heat lamps. We got seated under one of those heat lamps, and .. woo!! It got a little too warm, so we asked if it could be shut off .. they complied.  My friend and I kept it simple, sharing chips and salsa, each having the Turkey Cobb sandwich with fries and she had a Pomegranate margarita, while I had a glass of White Zinfandel. So far so good. Now that night there was a hockey game on (of which we are both fans), and since they had televisions, we asked if the channel could be changed. Sadly they didn't have that channel.  When it came time for dessert, my friend ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie and I the BJ Brownie. She ate hers entirely, whereas I could not finish. Getting the brownie out of that little tin it comes in was hard enough, but two scoops of ice cream (which I can usually eat) and all that whip cream was tough. Perhaps because of all I had eaten already, but the brownie wasn't great. I have a sweet tooth but this was a little much. And aside from the Pizookie, a root beer float and an apple crisp there isn't much in terms of variety. They should work on that."
Elizabeth H.,"San Jose, CA",30,70,47,1.0,3/25/2008,I've been to this place  few times every time I try it again and again I've always tried to give it another try but seems to me that this place lacks on the service..... I've waited for my meal for more than a hour once and there was another time I waited for a fork and spoon for a good 1/2 hour and my food was cold by the time i got them.... The worst service ever.... the food isnt bad but they need a new crew of waiters!
Sharon E.,"San Jose, CA",21,14,,4.0,7/6/2011,"BJ's Is a fun sports bar.  Their BBQ Chicken Pizza is Superb but it tastes so much better without the red onions and cilantro, both things I like a lot but just not on this pizza.  I have not a a dish I did not like here.  Enjoy."
Dani B.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,7,2.0,8/10/2010,"The food is good, the dessert is GREAT, but service is average. Went there about an hour before they closed the other night, and as I was waiting in the front for someone to seat us for 10 minutes. Eight employees just walked by without even acknowledging me. The server we FINALLY had was friendly and helped to make the experience better, but I wouldn't suggest going there late at night unless you want to be ignored."
Erin O.,"Neighbors Southwest, Beaverton, OR",85,643,59,1.0,7/5/2006,"Service here is awful and the food is not worth it. I've waited over an hour for food. The pizza is decent enough that it might be ok for a to-go order,  but then who wants to struggle getting into the mall area (even with parking spots for to-do orders) for pizza to go? I tried their avacado egg rolls once, hoping they'd be like Cheesecake Factory's and they weren't even  close."
