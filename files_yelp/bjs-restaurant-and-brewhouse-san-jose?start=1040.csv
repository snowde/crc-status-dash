Miguel R.,"San Jose, CA",9,58,2,3.0,8/28/2008,"This place exemplifies average. When I put ketchup on everything, it sure says something about their quality but i still end up coming back again and again with the girlfriend. That damn woman."
Sonia S.,"San Jose, CA",1,44,,5.0,8/19/2008,"In the words of Homer Simpson ""MMMMmmmm...Beer!"" The beer at BJ's is great, the price of a pitcher is super reasonable, and the quality is superb. They have good lunch specials too. The food is nothing spectacular but it is good overall. I would stick to the sandwiches, burgers, and pizza. Its a fun place to hang at the bar and munch on appetizers. I love that it is located at the mall cuz I can sometimes convince my hubby to come with me to the mall by enticing him with a trip to BJ's after the ""mall torture"" is over :)"
Maxine S.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,25,,5.0,7/15/2010,"I have been here several times and it is always great food and great customer service.  I have seen the manager there several times and he is always watching for things that need to be done.  We had a large party one time and more people joined than we had expected after we were seated.  The restaurant was so busy that they could not move us anywhere.  He told us we could have the table next to us when they leave.  He would just move it over to make our table larger.  He kept on eye on them and immediatly when they left, he himself started clearing off the table and then they moved it over for us.  He was so great and accomdating.  The food is amazing.  Everything I have ever ordered has been yummy!"
Ronald M.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,2.0,9/19/2009,"Stephanie is being nice lol. So seating did suck. I had to keep asking my friend to get me some food because I would have to either climb over a fence, or climb over like 6-7 people. The food did suck pretty bad IMO. I think the pizza would have better if they didnt drizzle Tobasco sauce all over it. And the Spagetti was pretty dry. I did like the RootBeer though. I really enjoyed going just because we got to hang out with friends. But BJ's I think drop the ball on food for large parties."
Lucy N.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,8,,4.0,9/15/2011,"Host/Hostess super nice, Waitress a little slow but very nice as well. Very yummy gluten free pizza. Allergy friendly is always a plus! :)"
Kathy B.,"Fremont, CA",2,20,4,3.0,7/5/2011,"The food is usually great, but sometimes the service can be a bit on the slow side.  The last few times we went there, we didn't see the server as much as I'd like to see them.  Other than that, it is usually a nice experience, and I still frequent this restaurant."
Alejandra A.,"Los Gatos, CA",10,44,23,4.0,10/4/2008,We enjoyed our first experience at BJ's today. The Lunch Specials are great. We ordered the Mini Pizzas and an Appetizer. The pizza was good and the service top. Our waiter was attentive always and refilling drinks and bringing what we asked quickly. The TV's and young college crowd makes the place an ideal environment for any sports fan. Highly recommend the Mini Lunch Pizzas. Overall great Lunch Menu.
JoAnn C.,"San Jose, CA",154,120,21,4.0,1/5/2009,"yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm pizzookie, and make your own pizza. then you regret it the next morning :p put the dressing on the side of ur salad. they drench it if you dont."
Vy N.,"San Jose, CA",3,62,4,4.0,11/23/2008,Their lasagna is good and white chocolate macadamien PAZOOKIE is off the hook!
JAYE m.,"San Jose, CA",4,25,16,4.0,4/4/2011,"I am big fan of brewhouse restaurants and always wanted to come here so for the first time I did for my birthday this past week. The outside is really nice doesn't look like a brewhouse but it looks classy what can you say it's connected to a mall. My family and I walked in had no reservations so we waited 25 minutes not bad for a place that's kind of small inside but have a lot of seats outdoors. Get to my table and greeted nice service here is great always making sure your having a good time lol even the chef came out to see if the food was good. We order drinks I start off with their 8 beer tester then a order a aged belgian ale man their beer selection is out of this world, and then order food man to much to choose from it all looked good but i am a fan of pizza and ordered a BJ's favorite. All in all I would come back here no doubt I wouldn't have to think about because BJ's I love and I mean BJ's by the restaurant lol."
Judy T.,"Fremont, CA",6,55,3,3.0,4/1/2007,This is a nice place to eat at the mall if you want better than food court food.  I had the turkey cobb sandwich for $8.95 which came with seasoned wedge fries.  The portion was plenty; I took home half the sandwich.  Fountain drinks prices are not listed on the menu; it is $2.40 with free refills.  The kids' menu is reasonable too.  $3.95 with a drink.  A kids' sundae is also listed on the menu but isn't included with the meal.  It costs an extra $1.  Service was good.  We ate early and avoided the huge wait we saw outside when we left.
Amanda M.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,2.0,8/9/2011,Their service is kinda slow. Nothing on their menu really strikes me. They no longer have my favorite dish (shrimp chardonnay pasta). Their avacado egg roll appetiezer is BOMB!
Laura G.,"San Jose, CA",2,15,,1.0,10/25/2009,"Usually Im a big fan of this place.  The food is delicious!  Unfortunately today was a different story.  A friend and I went for dinner and our server was so bad it ruined the entire meal.  We started off with soup and salad, my friend asked for pepper which the server never brought.  I had finished my soda before our food arrived, and our server never noticed and never brought a refill.  When our food arrived, my sandwich had a a piece of trash sitting on it.  Literally!  It was a piece of a sticker or paper or something that had been on the floor and had dirt all over it, and it was sitting on my sandwich.  Im not that picky but it was frigging disgusting.   I waited a good five minutes at least for the server to come check on us and take the sandwich back.   Then a bus boy brought it out without the ranch I had asked for.  I waited another 5  mins and finally flagged down the server for ranch.  She said she would be right back with it, then proceeded to go to the bar, deliver a drink, check on 4 more tables, run a check to another table, clear some dishes away and FINALLY came back with my side.  WTF!!  My friend had finished her meal almost before I started.  All this time, I still had an empty drink but clearly waiting for our server to do anything about it was a waste of time."
C M.,"Morgan Hill, CA",103,236,1,3.0,12/11/2008,"Had a large group of about 30, they told me they could do a buffet style for that many so i chose to do a pizza, pasta and salad buffet. They have you choose ahead of time what type of pizza you want, choose 4...pasta ( wouldn't recommend the marinara, wasn't good at all) and cesar vs house salad. PIzza was okay, i would expect the buffet to be on warmers or something but they were just kind of cold. I hate cold food so...the salad was good though. My friends were nice enough to get us a pizzookie which was like- the best part of the meal. It came out like a big pizza cookie with like half a gallon of vanilla ice cream on it. It started melting so we tried to cut slices like a pizza. MMM it was like so good. Freshly baked it was hot and the chocolate chips were all gooey. Half was white chocolate and the other half was regular. It was enough to feed like 10 people!"
Jo P.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,,4.0,8/3/2009,I've ate a BJ's several times and haven't been disappointed yet. I wouldn't recommend coming during evenings as it gets super busy but daytime eating is always enjoyable. I love their giant baked potatoes - I've tried all the different combos and really cant' decide which one is my favorite. The service I received has been a bit inconsistent but nothing so horrible I wouldn't come back again. Their rootbeer is very good as well as the other variety of drinks they serve. This is a fun place to eat with family or friends.
Debra S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/25/2011,"I had a wonderful dining experience at BJ's last night.  Our group started with some mini plates of bruchetta, tacos and stuffed mushrooms which were all tasty.     My chicken parmesan was delicious and a large portion (took half home and ate it for lunch-still yummy). My guests were equally happy with their choices.   Our server Danny was fun, cute,  professional and provided outstanding service with a smile. He definately added to a wonderful dining experience. I will definately be back!"
Nick H.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,3.0,7/19/2009,"Ok, every time I sit down to look at the menu at BJ's nothing ever stands out. I could never understand why people love this place to the point were they will wait for an hour to get seated?  I will admit that the beer is half decent and the Great White Pizza is really good, but everything else is below average."
Clarissa S.,"Pearl City, HI",172,123,16,4.0,6/26/2006,"the food is good, and i've never had bad service. however, if you sit outside there tends to be a weird ass sewage smell."
Francis J.,"San Jose, CA",0,79,,4.0,5/25/2011,"Been here 2 times and the service is on point. Ordered different items the 2 times i went here and i really liked both of them. I went here for my birthday the 2nd time, and since i turned 21 i decided to get an alcoholic beverage. I tried the strawberry splash which is a favorite it said, but im not a fan of it, it just tasted like numbing gel that they put on your tooth at the dentist. the server kept greeting me happy birthday which i thought was very thoughful, and you also get a free pazookie on your bday!"
Victor T.,"Houston, TX",12,40,,2.0,6/21/2006,"Service was ok, but food wasn't that great.  Maybe I was there on the wrong days but not the best place to go if you want a quick bite to eat."
