Annie A.,"San Jose, CA",124,114,12,4.0,7/6/2008,"I've already come here 3 times, and I would say the food is pretty good, the service is good too, but nothing that totally stood out to me. I don't remember what i tried, but everytime i come i'm always satisfied with my food. the problem is the wait, its horrible, i always have to wait for at least 20 minutes but thats because my parties have always been bigger than 6-7 people. they give you huge portions, so thats a bonus, you totally get your moneys worth. definitely worth trying if you havent! come here for a bithday party you won't regret it"
Daniel B.,"Fremont, CA",57,23,,4.0,2/26/2009,"BJ""s is one of my favorite restaurant chain..... One reason could be that i am a boozer and the beer sampler they have here for around 8 bucks, me likey! They also have a good amount of specialty beers (like the blue chamaine) with pretty good alcohol contents. Another reason perhaps, is the pizza (""the great white"" in particular). It is absolutely scrumptious and considering that BJ's isn't exactly a pizza joint, it says a lot for their food. Another delicious menu item are the stuffed baked potatoes.....filled with loads of good, artery clogging ingredients, the potato will definitely  have you begging for a nap by the time you are done eating it......well if that wasn't enough, try one of their delicious Pizookies. It is a desert masterpiece and will most likely put you in a diabetic coma for several hours (I never realized that sugar could force involuntary muscle movement, until I had one of these puppies) Overall, this is a great ""kick it' spot with a buddy or dinner with a lady friend."
L L.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,4.0,5/5/2011,"I like BJ's no matter where I go. The service in the bar during happy hour is a bit slow - understandable because it always looks like they have one server to the whole bar area plus one bartender. So knowing that now I usualy don't choose BJ's for happy hour, but love to go here on their off -peak times. Their oreo cookie pazooki is the best dessert on the planet, hands down!"
Joy D.,"Plumas Lake, CA",9,140,9,4.0,7/2/2008,"I'll usually go here for birthdays and what not. Their shrimp scampi is the best I've had, although kind of greasy. The nachos are a good appetizer, especially when there are eight of you and can't wait for the main entree. The best thing they have are the pizookies. I don't care what anyone else says about them! Yeah it's ice cream on a giant cookie, but it's still good as hell. The service needs improvement - sometimes we wait forever just to get our drink orders in and some of the waitors/waitresses are really rude. But I usually just deduct from their tip. So it works out fine. I'd definitely pick this place over places like Chili's."
Keyra J.,"Milpitas, CA",0,8,,5.0,3/30/2009,"I LOVE the wings here.  The spinach and artichoke dip is awesome too.  I am a big fan of their pizza.  I HATE pizza but I actually like it here.  Their deserts are pretty good too, but I rarely get around to it. Customer Service is always pleasant, some more pleasant and more attentive than others. As far as the seating goes, I've NEVER had a problem because I ALWAYS call in advance.  To all of those who are complaining about other people who come in after them, you need to realize that some people call ahead so of course they will go before you.  If you had called in advance, you would never have to deal with the long wait.  I've had to wait maybe 5 minutes tops."
M S.,"San Jose, CA",0,36,,4.0,3/24/2011,Love the food here but service can be iffy. Try and go when it's not too busy and service is great. If it's busy you can bet it will be a little slow! Pretty good place though!
Nicole W.,"San Jose, CA",62,385,445,3.0,6/22/2008,Good for a group dinner before or after a movie. Nice staff. Salads are good especially the FIELD OF GREENS or the WEDGE salad. mmm.. bacon....
Andy Y.,"Sunnyvale, CA",10,69,4,3.0,3/9/2008,"BJ's is a soild place for a meal. They are your standard Americana restaurant with burgers, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc.  I've been to BJ's a few times with my latest visit being tonight. I wasn't feeling a heavy meal so I opted for a Caesar salad. I was just going to order the Caesar salad and as I order, the waitress hits me with the ""Would you like to add chicken, shrimp or salmon to your salad?"" Something in my genius brain said ""SHIRMP!"", and I had a side of shrimp with my Caesar salad... My Caesar salad came out, and like 20-25 shrimp were thrown on top of it. These shrimp were just cooked in oil/butter, no seasoning. The Caesar salad..was Caesar salad. The shrimp on my salad, I could pass on. I probably had 4-5 shrimp total. The other times I've ended up at BJ's, I've tried their pizza, pasta and burgers. I would put this stuff a notch above your Chili's and Applebee's. The wait staff here was for the most part, good. You defiantly don't come into a place like BJ's excepting a whole lot. Overall, I'd go back if I was in the area!"
Lily N.,"San Jose, CA",12,177,55,3.0,5/21/2008,"Bj's is very average. There is a good chance if you ask anyone what they love about BJ's theyre gonna scream pizzookie. Ok good job thats their little selling point to get you in, but what about BEFORE the part where you stick a cookie the size of a small pizza in your mouth. The food here is average. I've had the sandwich and soup combo, its good but its something I can find at anderson bakery. I've tried their pizza's and its pretty much, ""Oh thats interesting, nice."" Nothing for me to be like ""OMGLETSGOTOBJ'SWETOTALLYNEEDTOGETTHEALFREDOPIZZAA­AA"" And it's always so mother freaking busy here. I've only been to this place 3 out of 6 times because it was so damn busy.  And the pizzookie, i mean if you really think about it, its not that big of a deal. Go to the store, buy a box of chip's a'hoy, nuke those thangs in the microwave and toss some ice cream on it. TAA DOW. Saved you $8 baby. You can thank me later. TAAAAA DOOOOOOOOWWW.                                                          taa dow."
Rinne R.,"Union City, CA",128,385,192,4.0,3/15/2006,"Hello!!  Wow, until I came to this restaurant, I never thought beer could taste this good!!  This restaurant is fun for large parties!  I don't remember my dish, but the most important thing was that it was great!!"
Marco M.,"San Francisco, CA",29,396,116,4.0,4/13/2006,"Pretty typical Brewhouse restaurant.  Great selection of beers, bigger than most menus.  The BJ's burger is pretty darn good. It's the first brew house I have ever been to where they haven't served soggy nachos.  Plus, the wait staff is is very good."
Xing L.,"San Jose, CA",17,45,2,5.0,2/27/2008,"i love this place! chicago style pizza is always a win in my book...the buffalo chicken pizza is divine and every bite is heaven...portions are hugeee here..you can feed 2-3 people with just the brewhouse nachos itself... ive tried almost everything on the menu and it seems as if i cant get enough...last night my friend ordered the country fried steak and it was a monster, i mean it looked like the size of a vinyl record...we also had the sampler which was awesome, presentation was so nice i didnt wanna mess up the arrangement by eating it  service was really good...but as people said it is really hit or miss...luckily our server was sensational...always checked up on us...really funny dude...i forgot his name but hes tall and has glasses  place can get really packed during the weekends and waiting for a table can take up to a hour so make sure you get there early to get a seat...if youre goin in mon-thurs theres a pretty good chance its only half full if that... we were dining at happy hour[after 10pm] so you get a $1 off pitchers, $2 off appetizers, and half off a mini pizza. you cant beat that for bj's prices! for a party a five with 2 mini pizzas, country fried steak, appetizer sampler, and two pitchers of beer it cost us around 50 bucks...try the jeremiah red beer...cheers!"
Glenn O.,"Campbell, CA",150,171,149,4.0,3/7/2006,"Overall good place for a group of people to eat and have fun, the pizza is good and deep dish type. (Chicago)  I went here before it opened as they gave away free dinners to the local neighbors, pretty much all you can eat which was great!  Atmosphere is great as they have a large bar and TV sets playing all types of sports. What else can you ask for?"
Wendy W.,"San Jose, CA",36,59,,4.0,6/18/2008,Yes!! This is a great place to have a Going Away Party for someone. Good food drinks and our waiter was able to get our food and keep our drinks a coming in lighting speed.
Jennifer C.,"San Jose, CA",82,17,1,5.0,6/5/2008,LOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!! My FAVORITE restaurant! Try the Apple Crisp! You will NOT be let down!
Sonia K.,"Greenwich, CT",27,103,3,5.0,3/27/2006,"I've never eaten a meal here, but 5 stars for the pizookie =)"
Jonathan M.,"Chicago, IL",22,56,,3.0,4/5/2006,"Not bad. The people that are having bad experiences here are ordering the wrong things. If anything, just go here for the pizza and Oreo pizookie."
becky f.,"San Jose, CA",106,173,12,4.0,4/22/2006,"uh yeah, don't expect to get much service late night if it's anywhere close to the weekend... lots of high schoolers and young groups of people gettin drunk... stuck in booths and seated waaayyyy too close to you.   what's good is the pizookie, the beer samplers, happy hour ahhh the most hearty but surprisingly not too heavy Santa Fe salad... grilled chicken, avo, corn, tomatoes, roasted red peppers... just add some jicima and black beans and you've got an amazing it's-late-and-i'm-starving meal!  (oh, and ask them to not sprinkle that red powder on everything... eww).   it's not a chichi place to go... it's there for late-night hang outs, beer, pizookies, pizza, big parties, loud talkers and not-so-bad food... when you can make it early."
jessica h.,"Livermore, CA",23,138,2,3.0,2/5/2008,"yesterday me and some girl friends went here for lunch and some drinks. the food and drinks were decent, but it took way to long for us to get our food, and the place wasn't crowded at all. i don't know if they were just under staffed at lunch time, but the servers we had didnt even come back often at all and ask if we were ok, or apologize it was taking too long. overall lunch was ok, they need to just work on the timing."
Shaina K.,"Chicago, IL",220,449,62,3.0,7/21/2006,"The service was good, but it took forever for the food to come out."
