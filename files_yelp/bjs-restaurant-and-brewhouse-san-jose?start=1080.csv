Mimi L.,"San Francisco, CA",52,33,14,4.0,6/30/2007,"My boyfriend and I always go here for their stawberry lemonade and pizookie. We enjoy the pot roast dinner plate also. This place is where we go to for a casual dinner together. Althogh during Christmas, the wait could be a bitch. I would also recommend the BJ's favorite pizza. The lasagna here is too cheesy for me."
Laura W.,"San Mateo, CA",312,180,2,4.0,10/8/2007,"I have been here a few times and Ive always enjoyed myself. its a great place to go with a group of friends. we all know the pazookies are amazing, and the food isnt bad either. The service is perfect, they dont bug you too much but they always fill your glass when it's needed. Its not somewhere you can always go because its a little pricey for us college students, but its a great date place or girls/guys night out thing. Great beer."
La Luna K.,"San Jose, CA",2,37,,3.0,5/4/2008,"I just called the local BJ's Brewhouse in San Jose to ask for info about the place, what time the kitchen closes, can I have a reservation (they don't do reservations but they do call-to-wait-in-line) and I hear shouting and cheering in the background.  The host immediately says, ""Hold on"" and I'm immediately about to Yelp! him for being so unprofessional. Some R&B music plays, and then after a little bit, he comes back on the line and asks me how many people will be coming to wait in their line.  I say, with some sarcasm, ""Who is playing?"" and he says in a matter-of-fact, why, didn't you know sort of way, ""The Sharks.""  Funny...once he says the Sharks, all my irritation is suddenly replaced with excitement about the hockey game.  Still...you're working there, buddy.  What would your manager say? Or is (s)he watching the game too?"
Carolyn C.,"Cupertino, CA",95,7,,1.0,8/28/2010,"The food here was great and all but customer service was horrible.  Maybe it's just my waitor, idk, but he was soooooo bad it...cracks me up.  I went on a triple date with my fiance and two other couples and reserved a table over the phone so we didn't have to wait.  THe waitor was really nice at first, but that didn't last for long. I don't know what he was doing, but he did not pay attention to our table that has a bunch of empty plates that needs to be taken away.  We ended up having to ask him multiple time to clear the dishes.  our glasses were empty and needed a refill, but we had to literally line them up on the side of the table in hope of getting his attention, but that did not work.  I was surprised when the other waitors walking by did not even say anything.  I understand that they have other things to do, but couldn't they jjust say anything ?!one of our friend decided to tip the guy $0.01, seriously ! bad experience,  but the tipping part makes me laugh"
Puchu ..,"San Jose, CA",12,89,,4.0,5/9/2006,"I like their imported European beers.  Food is decent, actually good considering it's bar food.  Place is big and airy and provides a comfortable feel.  Definitely one of my favorite micro-brew type places.  Definitely like it more then Tied House or Gordon Biersch."
Priyan P.,"San Jose, CA",136,52,,3.0,12/13/2006,"3.4 i love this location because it has cuter waitresses, and the service is better;  hmm, maybe its just the former. hehe I love the BJ's favorite pizza AND its the biggest poppin' place in the area OPEN TILL MIDNIGHT most days. AND PIZOOKIE! gooey cookie and ice cream goodness. drinks specials after 10pm. service is hit or miss.   you can easily get sick of their food so dont go more than once or twice a month."
Olga O.,"Campbell, CA",41,97,3,4.0,1/31/2008,"Great happy hour twice a day 5-7 on weekdays and 10 to closing weekdays and Sunday. Come early or come late - the parking is tough at par with finding seating... (must seat at the bar area for happy hour) although, still worth it. Food is good, never had a problem with a waiter. Love the beer, the enormous freshly baked brownie topped with ice-cream deserves to be mentioned, but the chicken wings are simply the best!!!"
Sarah S.,"Campbell, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/1/2010,"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. The last few times my husband and I have eaten here, we havwe been EXTREMELY disappointed. I was willing to wait the 20-40 minutes to be seated. Everytime we visit this restaurant, it takes forever for service. I understand that sometimes restaurants can be very busy, but waiting 15 minutes to get a drink order is ridiculous. People at other tables that were seated after us were receiving their food first. The waiter kept apologizing for the long wait. The manager made his way over to our table as we were still waiting for our food. He just commented that it would be a few more minutes. No sorry or offer to comp our food or drinks. I will NEVER eat at this BJ's again. I would have been better off to grab some food at the food court in the mall."
M G.,"San Jose, CA",5,239,,3.0,12/16/2005,I thought the beer was OK.  Burger was a little overcooked and salad was not so good.  Whatever the artichokes were soaked in destroyed the flavor of the salad.  I prefer Rock Bottom's burger any day of the week.
Sandeep S.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,,4.0,3/6/2012,i got there and the waiter was very polite and had great customer service skills. the food was excellent and i would recommend going here for a good time with family and friends.
Vardeen B.,"San Jose, CA",10,46,,5.0,11/9/2009,"I love Bj's, everything about this Bj's is amazing. Their service is excellent with nice employees that do everything with kindness, and efficiency. Their food is in a completely different category. The only place that makes the pizookie, so it has to be great. The pizookie is a must try thing when you go to any Bj's."
TJ W.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,3.0,3/23/2010,Not  too bad. Im not a huge fan of thier brew but its ok. Most of the food is pretty darn good and Ive never had bad service.
G J.,"San Jose, CA",7,26,,4.0,9/11/2009,We have been to many BJ's and this branch is great. It is always packed but the wait is not that bad. The ambiance is fun as well as great for kids as they have some crayons and color booklet to occupy their time. The kids meal is fairly price & I love the Root Beer. I usually get the pizza or calzone and I love how cripsy they are and freshly cooked. I also love the avocado eggroll. So tasty! Of course we can't forget the famous White Chocolate Cookie with ice-cream....yummy!
Lila J.,"San Jose, CA",69,180,,3.0,8/19/2007,"We always get the BBQ chicken pizza here.  A couple times we got it to go and it never tasted as good as dining in...even though the left overs tasted just as good...weird.  The Pizookie dessert is yummy if you have room for it.  It is a warm, soft cookie in a mini pizza dish with vanilla ice cream.  They have different cookie flavors you can choose from like chocolate chunk and macadamia nut. The downside... parking sucks here...you will probably have to park on the other end of the mall and there is always a wait on friday and saturday night.  You could always go to PF Changs next door if you don't want to wait..."
tena C.,"San Jose, CA",1,10,,5.0,2/24/2010,"I have to say, I have had some really bad service here, especially during weekday lunch time, but on this evening, Sat. Feb. 20, I had my b-day party here for 16 people. Our reservation was at 7:30 and we were seated just a few minutes after that. Our servers were attentive, quick, and efficient, and no one at our table had any complaints. I was really surprised, as service here is usually my only issue, but everyone who waited on us provided terrific service, and our food was fantastic."
Alma L.,"Chicago, IL",2,75,14,2.0,7/24/2011,"after realizing we were late for a movie last night we decided to come into this place just to have a beer and a snack.  it was around 10:30 PM and we got seated right away.  our watress looked like she'd been having a rough day, which is expected since it was late already.  she took our order of a buffalo chicken pizza.  the food came out and after that our waitress NEVER came back to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything else.  we saw her walk by SEVERAL time but NOT ONCE DID SHE COME BY!!!! WTF!  just when we were getting ready to pull a random waiter to the side and ask him for the check i saw our waitress leave with her purse!  she didn't even BOTHER INFORMING us of her departure and introducing us to our new waiter!!  THAT'S JUST BAD WAITRESSING MAN!  thankfully just as soon as we were to loose our patience another kind waiter came by and asked us if we needed anything and we asked for our check.  hopefully HE GOT THE TIP!  not her....bad service on her part.  other than that...GOOD PIZZA AND GOOD BEER!  i wish i had that waitress' name so i can burn her here."
Ryan S.,"Seattle, WA",2,7,,4.0,11/9/2006,Mmm...  Chili Cheese fries and Hef and wash it all down with a hoto pizookie.  What more could a guy ask for?  A staple for my buddies and I after a crappy Friday working.  We always come after 11pm so only the lounge is open.
T Is For Tom N.,"San Jose, CA",304,219,,4.0,9/24/2008,"It is one of the better joints in town for hot wings. The place is always crowded, but the service is always great in quality. I guess with them when there is a lot of quantity they still can deliver their quality. Every time I have gone here the food and service are always great and their Bazookies are the bomb. If you never had a taste of a Bazookie you need to get over to the closest BJ and order yourself one."
s c.,"San Jose, CA",2,142,,2.0,11/13/2009,"Great if you are under 19. But, if you have spent more than $20.00 for your dinner before your not going here. Low quality, loud and sloppy service makes this the dark side of the american adult dining scene......"
elle f.,"San Jose, CA",124,22,,5.0,6/29/2009,"our annual father's day brunch was held here this year and it was great!  to avoid the rush my sister in law made a 10:30am reservation for 14 people.  we were seated promptly and waited on almost immediately.  our waitress was awesome...friendly, informative and efficient!  this was the first time our  parents, aunts and uncles had been there so they were impressed with the prices and portion sizes.  we had a few varieties of the chicken dishes, fish and chips, steak and a burger.  everyone was pretty full and ended up taking home at least half their order.  since it was their first time, i ordered a few pizookies...a must have if you ever go to any BJ's restaurant!  my fave is the chocolate chip chunk! :)   the restaurant has a bar and tv's placed all over the place.  there are a couple of patios to accomodate bigger parties and it seems like there were a few large groups in the restaurant by the time we left.  for father's day, they also gave each dad a BJ's drinking glass that had the restaurant logo and ""father's day 2009"" printed on it as well.  :)  cool souvenirs! they have a huge menu...everything on it sounds good!"
