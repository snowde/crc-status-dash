Joseph V.,"San Jose, CA",50,150,52,3.0,12/23/2008,"BJ Favorites Pizza, Chicken Wings, Blond Beer, and Pizookie.  These 4 items that make BJ's restaurant great.  The BJ Favorite is a deep dish buttery crusted pizza with about everything on it.  Absolutely a must order.  Chicken Wings are drizzled with ranch and hot sauce.  These wings are not drenched in vinegar sauce or anything like wingstop.  The house blond beer is a great choice for a light crisp beer and goes well with pizza, wings and fries.  I normally don't get dessert but the pizookie is an exception.  Its a freshly soft baked cookie topped with ice cream.  The best dessert on the menu."
Veronica G.,"San Francisco, CA",204,461,,4.0,4/19/2007,"EWWW!!!!!!!!! I am disgusted right now with myself for writing this but I will plow through here because I actually have good things to say about this branch of this chain (damn I wish I had a pint or two of Tatonka stout to make this easier). Yes, you have hosted many of my former place of employments work parties. Yes, you put up with all of our evil shenanigans. Yes, you let me scream in your loudspeaker system rip roaring drunk on a dare. Yes, oh yes, your management let us reek havoc on your seemingly innocent waitstaff used to waiting on sports patrons and all those ""believe I can buy class with credit"" Almaden families and yet they never cut us off from the booze or told us we were too rowdy (even after one particularly inspired male coworker, who decided to do a table dance for the rest of us, fell off the table midshimmy!!!!!) These few tidbits I can proudly share with all my fellow Yelpers (before I go run and hide). First off all, a loaded potato will beat french fries almost any day (particularly when alcohol is involved). Secondly, Happy Hour 1/2 off minipizzas tonight are microwaved full flavored lunch tomorrow! Third, two words: Tatonka Stout (sweet and heavy, make ya' slur after a pitcher). Fourth, the bigger the group and the louder you are, the more attention you will get from the staff (they're almost morbidly fascinated by the loud, the rowdy and drunk--maybe it's because with the exception of the bartenders the majority are under 21.)"
James T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,23,,4.0,2/2/2009,"I like this place. It's family friendly, and with the current economy, it's no longer crazy crowded. The food portions is very generous. I used love their bruscetta, but they changed it and I no longer get it."
Jamie M.,Bay Area,12,42,,5.0,3/2/2008,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! My best friend and I went there a few weeks ago for Valentine's Day. I ordered an appetizer, Avocado Spring Rolls, and it was delish! My best friend ordered some kind of Potato dish, but I remember she said it was yummy and stuffing :) The best dessert is the PAZOOKIE! It's sooooo filling and soooo worth it. They have wonderful service and they know how to treat their customers good. I want to come here again. Maybe bring my boyfriend next time. I'm sure he'll love this kind of atmosphere. :) 5 stars"
Jane Y.,"Pleasanton, CA",88,275,93,4.0,2/28/2006,"i don't remember much about the food, i think it was okay? i think they're known for their pizza's? but i do remember their pizookie, ""freshly baked, hot out-of-the oven cookie with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream"" (hence the 4 stars). you can have your choice of cookie too! yum-O!!!"
Mike N.,"Chicago, IL",763,112,92,3.0,9/4/2007,3.5 because i applied to work there and they were really picky on who to hire haha or else it would have gotten a 4. i like this place very contemporary and modern with the plasma tv screen every direction you look. the service was like everyone said...hit or miss...luckily whenever ive been there we've gotten great service really nice...chats a lil..like this one server that saw my tribal shirt and asked if i did grafitti art!!! wow..she was cool hahahaha yup...food is pretty good here too...i mean not the GREATEST you kno? but good to eat with friends...then at the END...share the PARTY PAZZOKIIE!!! hahaha DONT ask for an extra scoop of ice cream..BAD idea...hahaha unless you want ALOT of ice cream...holy moly...that thing came out and we thought is was a mountain of towels and not ice cream...SOOO MUCH but it was GREAT of course haha come here every so often so yea you should too if you have not already...try it out once...and then you'll see
Itz L.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,4.0,10/17/2008,"I love the decoration inside, very chill and exciting. However, food is not all that great. Tried their baked potato topped with cheese, sour cream, broccoli, chicken and some other ingredients I don't remember. It sucked! I think regular bake potato is better. This restaurant is good if you go with a bunch of your friends who drink and like to chill. As for me I don't drink, so BJ is just another restaurant for me. :)"
Pat M.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,4.0,3/28/2008,The service I usually get isn't bad at all. Maybe I just get lucky and get the better servers whenever I'm there. The pizookies are the only reason I go there though. If you haven't had a pizookie go find the closest BJ's to you and order one. It is awesome and great and fantastic.
princess l.,"San Jose, CA",11,190,,4.0,2/17/2009,"very american, i've tasted better pizza & their known for pizza? uhmm..the environment is good for a group for an event or just family outings. i'm not sure whats really good because i've tried the bbq chicken pizza & hawaiian pizza. i like their ceasar salad other than that, its fairly decent!"
Alex B.,"Mountain View, CA",0,25,,5.0,12/6/2008,"This is a great experience for those who haven't gone.  Its a little pricey, but makes a great ""date"" restaurant.  I went with the lady and had a great experience overall.  After a relatively short wait (for a Friday night), we were seated and promptly helped.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful as to what beers to order.  As an appetizer we had the buffalo wings, and if you're a wing fan, these are AMAZING!  The presentation is awesome, the sauce is very good, and they were phenomenal. The rest of the meal maintained that level of excellence.  Our meals were very promptly brought out, and phenomenally prepared.  The girl had the Cheeseburger Pizza, and I had the California burger, and both were excellent.  We barely had enough room for dessert, but you can't go to BJ's and not get a Pizookie, so we split one and somehow made enough room to mow through it.  Unbelieveable.  Overall, I had absolutely no complaints."
