Yvonne V.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,3,5.0,8/11/2016,Service was amazing! Waiter was friendly and attentive! The cookies and cream pizookie was the highlight of the meal. A must have dessert!
Katherine N.,"Mountain View, CA",4,33,9,4.0,12/27/2016,"You know, I really want to hate this place. Big, bougie, whitebread American chain. Except, dang it, they have a nice selection of very tasty beers, and a lot of healthy, delicious food in addition to the burgers and pizza. This is one of the few places all my coworker's can consistently agree on, and we leave happy every. single. time. Food I've tried and liked: Brussels sprouts (OMG), Asian chicken salad, tomato soup, club sandwich, veggie burger, super food salad, chocolate chip pizookie, fried portobellos (seasonal?), cherry glazed salmon, thick-cut fries, jalapeño burger, kale salad (names may be approximate). Beer I've tried and liked: ALL OF IT DANG IT. And they offer 4 oz pours for lightweights like me who would spend the afternoon sleeping off a full beer. The one thing I'd steer clear of is the calamari. It just is not tasty, and it's soggy AF. One of my coworkers gets it every time, but I think that's only because it grosses out someone else on our team, and he knows I'll help finish anything... I've had it oh so many times now, and it is always nasty."
Christina L.,"San Jose, CA",250,215,279,4.0,6/14/2014,I give this BJs 4 star solely for their excellent customer service compared to the other BJs I've been to. Food quality seems a little better as well My family and I always get the tuna tartare and wings for appetizers. My personal favorite entree is the scallops and veggies. Pizzas there are always delicious and their jambalaya is delish as well. What makes the differences is their good customer service even if they're a big franchise. All the servers are attentive and make sure that you are satisfied and happy by the time you leave. I'll drive from Sunnyvale to come to this restaurant because there is a difference between the restaurants
Christian Z.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,1,5.0,1/5/2017,"Wow, I have been to be BJs many times throughout the years, and my experience were maybe all 3s, but today it was something else. I had maybe the best waiter I have ever had in my life. It was my friends birthday and we were a group of 15ish. With this many people I expected the service to be a little under average. Wow was I wrong. Luckily we were given the waiter Paul. This guy was one of the coolest and best waiter I have ever met. My drink was always full, he checked up on us the perfect amount of times, the food came out hot... he was the perfect waiter. Thank you Paul !"
Cathleen N.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,1,5.0,1/15/2017,Great selection of beer such as IPA and stouts. Cajun pasta is also not on the menu but is my favorite dish. Would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner and drink!
Heidi B.,"San Jose, CA",2,12,,2.0,9/23/2016,"Since we have had about 49 minutes to site here and wait for our server to check on us or pick up the tab, I thought I'd write a review about how much service sucked today. We have been waiting for over 40 minutes for our server to check on us. We had a question about the bill and haven't been able to find our server anywhere. Worst service ever!"
Garret B.,"San Jose, CA",4,30,10,4.0,6/30/2016,"Great tasting food, big menu, nice decor and pretty friendly waiters.  Portions are super small though.  Surprised by how small my California grilled sandwich was for $11.50 and my pazooki (spelling?) desert was embarrassing small in comparison to the picture in the menu (see picture).  So, whatever you see in the menu, divide it by two. ;) Tried the ginger IPA which was great.  I'd come back again but not as much as what I at first the ought I would. :-)"
Diane T.,"San Jose, CA",0,44,2,2.0,6/7/2016,"First time eating at BJ's... After hearing so many good things about this place, I'm pretty disappointed.  When we arrived, based on my own personal preferences, I was hoping to sit in the booths, but instead, we got seated in chairs. No biggie really- except that there was this stench coming from the table that smelled really gross, and the menus was really sticky for some reason.  When our server came to take our order, he didn't even try to help us as we were looking for the beverages to choose from. After getting our drinks, my friend ordered the grilled chicken alfredo pasta, while I ordered the shrimp asparagus penne pasta. We were both disappointed because the noodles weren't even fully cooked right, both dishes lacked a lot of flavor, my shrimp tasted raw and flavorless, and my friend even founded a piece of hair in his food. Overall, $50 (excluding tip) could have been well spent somewhere else... This restaurant really needs to work on improving their food quality, and maintaining a cleaner, more sanitary environment. I am not expecting to come back here anytime soon, unless it is for the pazookie."
Eddie A.,"Citrus Heights, CA",10,11,,1.0,12/18/2016,"I have been to this location once a year for the past three years I have never gotten the order correct I've waited 25 minutes one year to be waited on then got the wrong meal. The next year I went and once again waited 25 minutes for food and it was undercooked. This year I went in with my family not only did they get the order wrong they forgot the sides we sent it back it took 25 minutes to get a sandwich returned that was messed up, I never got my side dish . The server was so upset with the kitchen that he got the manager the manager heard what was going on and came over to the table personally to apologize and tried his best to take care of the problem. He made it to my satisfaction for the screw up tonight but this was three out of three I will never set foot in this restaurant again."
Sandra H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/1/2017,"First time coming in to this location. My server was Biagio, he truly made the experience worth it. He was so warm & welcoming will definitely be coming back!! :)"
Jill O.,"San Jose, CA",202,66,30,4.0,4/15/2016,"Donovan was fantastic! He was literally born for this job! It is clear that he was working really hard!   The food was pretty good, I just wished the calamari was a bit more meaty! Fettuccine was delicious! Over all, great atmosphere, good food, and fabulous service! I will be returning soon!"
Donnette T.,"Saratoga, CA",15,68,148,5.0,8/16/2016,"Avocado egg rolls. Don't need to say much more. Except Pizookie! Our server in the bar this Tuesday night is Ken, he is busy but totally on the ball and got us everything with a smile and in time for us to get to our movie -- great food & service,and Mai Tai!!"
Clif C.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,16,,5.0,1/12/2017,"Went there for a very special BIRTH day. Paul was amazing. Just a very wonderful personality, great humor. He's that kind of person and personality that's successful and ""living life to the fullest"" wherever, whatever he's doing. Two of our kids wanted food too, but they were at home. So aside from the in-house dining which was awesome, we had to order take out. Paul had the attention to ""time"" the take out orders. (So that the dinner was hot when we arrived home - and the dessert still cold, etc). They were difficult take out items. We noticed that Paul took the energy and focus to put the take out orders in such a way that it could be enjoyed really well at the house too. He remembered our preferences with sauces and what not. If something was meant to be cold or frozen, he separated them from the hot foods.  Just really impressed. He has an attention to detail, works hard, and also shows he loves what he's doing. When the kids opened and ate the takeout, there was that sense of care from Paul. He didn't just serve us and throw us away after we gave the tip. He took the energy and time to arrange things so that even with all the cuisine at home, the kids could enjoy BJ's dishes. BJ's Oakridge seems to attract this kind of staff. We've had great customer service experiences before too."
Jen R.,"Milpitas, CA",0,7,7,5.0,12/7/2016,O. M. G.  Without a doubt the best experience! Great food and amazing service! Thank you Sean! Your food recs were ON POINT and we never had an empty cup. Moms lunch out and this was a fantastic lunch! Thank you!!
Scruffy G.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,7,,4.0,6/8/2017,"Patrick, our server was superb, attentive and courteous. We had a couple of picky eaters and he had no problem with the requests. The food was very tasty , what a great experience."
Brian S.,"Aptos, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/3/2017,"Love the Jambalaya.    All 3 of us in our party had the jambalaya and we all thought it was great.    Our server Kadie did a great job, bringing us a complimentary birthday pizookie at the end of the meal.   She was especially attentive since we had been waiting for several minutes after being seated, and no one offered to take our order.    Turned out, her shift was over, but she stayed overtime since they were short-staffed.  We live nearby, and will continue to go here and recommend it to others. We were there on Jan 2, which turned out to be a holiday for some people, so it was very crowded."
Austin J.,"San Jose, CA",111,2,,5.0,1/1/2017,Biagio L was a great server he served us well & was very fast to help us . First time at bjs ever since I moved here to San Jose . I recommend you guys come to bjs and ask for him to be your server
Benjamin S.,"Sacramento, CA",192,8,9,5.0,5/31/2016,"I've been to plenty of BJs in my life, but I've never had the service I had at this restaurant. Our waiter--Frankie, I think his name was--gave my friends and I the best service yet. He was great at recommending drinks, food, and gave us some great laughs. Despite the delay in food, our waiter kept us laughing. Everyone in our group agrees--we've never had better service before this waiter.  Collectively, we were a pretty big table, but all of us ended up tipping our waiter at least 20. Great time."
Hadley W.,"San Jose, CA",4,6,,4.0,1/9/2017,It was a wonderful dinner for a wonderful food. We enjoyed the night as well as the service goes. The place is nice and clean.
Jacqueline H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",106,37,37,1.0,2/9/2015,"Super sad to give one of my favorite places 1 star. My boyfriend and I came here again to celebrate him getting a job.  I started with an order of the stuffed mushrooms and they were these teeny itty bitty things. And there was very little filling inside. He ordered the pull pork sandwich. It tasted as if they just smeared McDonald bbq on the pork and the fries were soggy. I ordered a mini deep dish bj Classic. It was terrible. The pepperoni was all stuck together, barely any sauce, giant lumps of sausages and it was all cramped in the middle. The entire pizza looked like a sink hole.  Another sad point is that they got rid of my favorite chicken limone, pot roast, and meat sauce spaghetti. Cost cutting factors?.. :("
