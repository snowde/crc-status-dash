Vanessa S.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/10/2017,"Slow service, bad food.  Food was delivered after over 30 minutes and was cold.  As we sat waiting for our check the waiter was taking selfies with friends at another table.  If looking for a late bite at Oakridge stick to Cheesecake Factory."
Mar E.,"San Jose, CA",66,38,,4.0,10/18/2016,"visited BJ's 2x in a month, for me, that's a good thing! the first time was the jalapeño burger, yum!!  the second time, about 2 weeks ago, my family went for my brothers birthday. we had 7 adults and 1 child. the appetizer came out quickly as did most of our food. i ordered a rib eye, but probably should leave steaks to steakhouses. other than that, the monkey bread is amazing and so is their pizookies!! i must say too, this dinner truly was a great one because of Biagio and his superior customer service and attention to our table. service is always just as important as the food! thanks Biagio!!"
Danielle D.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/23/2016,"Saba was a sweetheart and a really excellent server, I wish my service at every restaurant was as good as Saba was to us."
Manju N.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/4/2016,"We came here on a Sunday evening.. it was half an hour wait for us.. we ordered avocado egg rolls, extra spicy buffalo chicken wings and nachos for starters.. the service was pretty quick.. we loved the avocado rolls and the wings.. nachos was good as well but it's a huge portion.. for entree we had spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles and a chicken tortilla soup.. soup was a tad bit too salty for me and the noodles was okay.. dessert was pizzookie.. :) macadamia was aah so ""finger licking good""!"
Charles A.,"San Jose, CA",7,50,5,4.0,6/23/2016,"First of all, my wife and I don't drink alcoholic beverages which makes our appearance at BJ's seem out of place.  They do have some very tasty menu selections though. We frequent the 3 restaurants in the South Bay area and find that the food is very consistent between restaurants.  My wife loves the salmon and quinoa dish while I like the chicken and pasta dishes.  Their hamburgers are very tasty.  They have several very good dinner salads made from fresh ingredients.  Their pizza selection is excellent considering that it is not an Italian restaurant and the Tuscan Tomato Bisque soup is my favorite. They have a diner's reward program giving discounts when a certain point level is reached. My biggest gripe is that since I don't drink alcohol, I really enjoy a good glass of their Tropical Iced Tea.  They used to have it available on a regular basis but in the recent past, its availability has been shaky.  They promise that is NOT off the menu but every time we're there, they say that they are out of it.  Their regular iced tea is not so good and drinking just ice water leaves me dissatisfied."
Kathy T.,"San Jose, CA",37,111,189,4.0,5/27/2015,"Can't fault the beer, service or appetizer. Atmosphere for me was the only thing lacking. A bit dark for my taste, but who cares really when the beer is good and cold and not to mention delicious with a capital D! Had to try the Nit Wit draft and the deep fried calamari. Couldn't beat the price, and I noticed their happy hour prices were extremely reasonable. Will definitely go back on a weekday afternoon for that!"
Faraj K.,"San Jose, CA",5,10,3,5.0,10/30/2016,"It was a really good experience it has a variety of food and there is a sports bar I recommend it for anybody, also the spinach stuffed mushrooms are really good."
AKIN A.,"San Jose, CA",2,11,9,5.0,6/16/2016,I've been with my family already 4 times in this place everytime great service great food I really enjoy the place servers are amazing they're very friendly they have good food( if you want good times and have some food this is place to go( specially tonight Cesar P.)

VANESSA H.,"San Jose, CA",249,117,168,5.0,5/8/2015,"Service over a year ago was iffy but I'm confident that there has been some major changes the last two times I've been here the service has been excellent. I applaud the workers, cooks and management here. Food is warm on time and tasty, staff is friendly. Had a great time here today."
Sevak Y.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/3/2016,"Last night me and my girlfriend came to celebrate her 21st birthday with 8 other friends came to BJ's and the service was horrible. Our server was Kyle and he didn't greet us with a smile or anything just with a dry tone as if he didn't care about serving us. The food was ok not the best, 1 of our friends found hair in her burger and another friend didn't get his food for 30 minutes and overall the service was terrible food quality wasn't the best. I feel like the server Kyle didn't care for us at all because he rarely came to our table to see if we were ok but he had no problem going to other tables that clearly didn't need his help."
Laney D.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,3,1.0,12/4/2016,"Good food, WAY to expensive. For two people it took 2 hours because of the horrible service. I had to serve my self water and pay for a 40 dollar meal total. That's ridiculous"
Jazmine R.,"San Jose, CA",4,50,14,4.0,8/6/2016,"This restaurant is pretty decent. Usually is always busy especially on Fridays & Saturdays. Out of the many visits I've had here, there hasn't been an experience where I've had an issue with the server, they're all usually really polite and the wait for the food isn't that long either. they have decent variety on their menu, although I will say that the vegetarian options are not that bad either. They have this great new feature now when you check-in with the host and let them know how big your party is, you type in your phone number and they text you when your tables ready. Whoever thought of this idea is a genius because it allows you to walk around the mall or do whatever. Drinks are good, expense wise there are good options and nothing unreasonably priced that I see. I definitely recommend getting a pizookie they are delicious!"
Christine T.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,3.0,11/27/2016,Food is good. Service was okay. Ordered a drink that tasted like it had absolutely no alcohol in it  that supposedly did.
Arielle C.,"San Jose, CA",2,9,2,5.0,10/6/2016,"The five stars go to my ""not server"" Shawn. There was a miscommunication between servers and closing sections and my sister and I were not greeted by a server. Shawn noticed we weren't being helped and decided to take our order even though we were out oh his section. He was so kind and helpful, I really appreciated the fact that he went out of his way to accommodate us. Will definitely come back next time and request to sit in his section."
Ivette A.,"San Jose, CA",9,48,62,4.0,2/20/2016,"The service was amazing . I enjoyed my meal and found the staff extremely pleasant. The food was great.   I had the chicken and spinach over quinoa.  Really light and tasty.   Of course i cancelled out the healthy with their tasty piranha pale ale beer. Our server was Jason who then switched with another, whose name i didnt catch (spoke spanish). they were both great.  Someone else was running the drinks for them (young and of asian decent). a great team!   Thanks for great service"
Dave T.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/22/2017,"Our waiter, John, was incredibly knowledgeable and had great menu recommendations. His expertise was only enhanced by his awesome mustache. Tried the Ahi Poke, as recommended by John, and I will definitely be ordering it again. Great service, great food, well worth the visit"
Amanda S.,"San Jose, CA",7,13,4,5.0,1/24/2016,"Went into BJ's for dinner and had a great time. Everyone on staff was super friendly, even the buser who came around to clear our plates before we paid. Our server, Sean, was SUPER nice and attentive. Will definitely go back :)"
Sabah S.,"Dallas, TX",128,4,,5.0,10/15/2016,Our server was totally awesome. He greeted us kind and friendly manner and made us feel right at home. His name was Biagio. If you guys ever go to BJs make sure he takes care of you!
Claire D.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/14/2016,Sean Tan is the best server I've ever had. The food is always amazing and the pizookies are a must.
Jill B.,"Campbell, CA",183,11,1,3.0,10/10/2016,They must be bad on labor costs so they give their servers way too many tables and the servers run around like crazy and can't give good service. The bar area service is the worst. The food is always delicious though!
