Ash L.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,1,2.0,4/10/2017,"I first called to make reservations for dinner, the guy who answered the phone asked me how many and when. Then he asked if he could put me on hold and I was on there for over 5 minutes. Then we got there and the service hosts weren't that friendly and the service was slow and just okay. We went on a week night, and waited an hour to be seated then still waited for our food almost an hour. The food and beer are good but service, not so much..."
Ben D.,"Ewa Beach, HI",352,6,,2.0,9/18/2016,"Servers need to learn to prioritize, takes forever to get a server to get an order or refill. Hosts and hostess need to greet the customer instead of acting like they gave better things to do. At least tell us they'll be with us shortly instead of ignoring us."
Dionna M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",42,28,8,5.0,10/2/2016,"Haaa! I'm loving the management here. The professionalism of the young African American manager is absolutely awesome. Our meal took a little longer than it should have, maybe about 10 minutes longer and we were getting a little anxious. My son's pizza was colder than normal and we had decided to leave, then the manager stepped in. She made everything right. My sons pizza was prepared as it should have been, and other details that weren't sorted out right were handled. She took our table on as if she was a waitress. By the time I was done I was ready to pay the full bill. Bad service is something I detest especially when I am expected to reward the person with some sort of payment, but when service is great its just great, and the end result to our visit at BJ's was great service and delicious food."
Holly R.,"San Jose, CA",150,71,225,1.0,8/29/2016,"After waiting over an hour for our food, our order was wrong. Food was cold and poor quality. Service was poor, management (John) was useless- he didn't seem to care about the problem at all. Although this restaurant is conveniently located at the mall, I would not eat at this particular one after my last incident with them-management could have changed that view, unfortunately he only added to my dislike for that location."
Keyan M.,"San Jose, CA",88,4,1,5.0,10/14/2016,"Went to BJs with my family on a Friday night. Food was good as it always is. They are always consistent. But the reason i am giving 5 stars is because of the service. Our server, Biagio, was amazing. He was kind, funny, and attentive. Without amazing service like the one Biagio gave us, BJs would probably be a 3.5-4 star restaurant. Biagio made it 5 stars for us."
Michael J.,"San Jose, CA",1,9,16,4.0,10/26/2016,Erik makes the best cocktails in Blossom Valley. I'd give 5 stars but yelp filters out 5 star reviews- cheers Michael
Antonio M.,"San Jose, CA",4,14,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Sunday brunch menu looked good and the waiter was very nice but when the food was served the bad experience began. I had taken my mother out for a nice time and both us were disgusted with how our food came out. Things that stood out to us: 1. The food wasn't hot. 2. The eggs were greasy with oil and butter.  3. The sausages were undercooked. 4. Potatoes were bland and were mixed with burnt bell peppers and onions. 5. The worst of them all, the pancakes tasted like they were cooked on a stove that had cooked every other thing for the past two weeks without cleaning the stove off and then added oil it to them to cover the taste.  The food was awful but the atmosphere and the waitress were nice. You choose to do with this information but be sure not to expect tasty food."
Denise J.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/27/2017,"Thought we'd go out to watch the Giants v Dodgers game at the local sports bar.  What a mistake.  Had to ask to have the game on the tv!  Really?  We're in the Bay Area, it's the Giants vs the Dodgers for goodness sakes and the 'sports bar' doesn't even have the game on!!!  No, there's tennis, NFL draft bs (for a draft that starts 4 hours from now, no closed caption and you have no idea what they're saying), soccer, etc.  Then out of 8 tv's, they put it on one.  Let us crane our necks to watch something pertinent, while there's just filler nonsense on the other tv's.  Sad representation of a sports bar.  And then we realize we had the same issue last year.  Do you think you'd go into a 'sports bar' in Colorado or NY (or any other city for that matter) and have to ask for the Game?!?!  Pitiful.   Think we've learned our lesson."
Brian S F.,"Roseville, CA",60,17,,5.0,10/4/2016,"Biagio L was a great server.  I met my wife for lunch while I was on my break, and he got us in and out in no time.  Food was good too!"
Jonathan G.,"Livermore, CA",30,11,1,5.0,3/29/2017,"Food and beer came slow... So you might ask why I'm rating this a 5 star experience? Well, where do I begin... I stepped out for a call and my beer magically refilled. While this may have been my girlfriend that just texted me food was here, I don't know. I like to think it was our waitress. So I come in after a 20 minute call and food and beer were waiting for me. As soon as I go to take a bite I'm told that the manager is on his way. He apologies for the delay and takes good care of us. After he leaves, I congratulate my introverted girlfriend on complaining. Turns out she didn't, and the team was being proactive and working together to ensure a pleasant experience and make sure we come back. I've had much worse experiences without even an apology at higher level establishments. Kudos BJ's! Thanks for the free pizookie on free pizookie day. We will definitely be back and bring our friends and appetite and asking for Vanessa to be our server."
Anita S.,"San Jose, CA",321,27,79,4.0,3/28/2016,"I'd rate this place far higher than its natural competitors - TGIFs, Chillies, Hooters, Applebies, Dennys, etc, which by comparison all deserve only 2 stars.  Great selection on the menu, everything is well presented, delicious, not overly battered/fried/greasy. You can modify most menu items to be more palatable for low fat, low carb, low cholesterol, gluten free, no meat, no red meat, vegetarian, or vegan diets.  My only complaint is that with a selection, they should also a 1 page vegetarian/vegan menu in which they offer specific selections for those diets - which happen to be very popular in the SF Bay Area."
Veronica C.,"Cupertino, CA",777,641,3821,2.0,8/5/2014,"It's been a while since I last set foot in BJ's, so we decided to give it another try. Came here for dinner on Saturday and the wait was ridiculously long, rivaling those infamous Cheesecake Factory wait times!  It's nice, however, that they have a large waiting area outside the restaurant. The restaurant itself was quite spacious, loud and had a lively atmosphere.  It's the kind of place where people go for casual food and drinks with friends and family.  The service, however, was below average.  We didn't see the waiter again, after our food was brought, until he handed us our check at the end.  The food wasn't that great either. So yes, finally, onto the food.  We decided to go with their specialty deep dish pizza.  Surprisingly, this dish didn't take long at all.  Served on an iron stand, great for sharing, and gosh did it look yummy!  Sadly, it was false advertising as it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked; it was dry and the pizza wasn't even hot...more like room temperature. I didn't dig the angus beef dip sandwich either.  The beef felt all mushed up and the dipping sauce was too salty.  The skinny fries on the side, though, were decent. As for their chicken artichoke pasta?  Yum, we have a winner!  I thought their pasta dishes were pretty solid so If I were to come back and eat at BJ's again, I would probably just stick with them....and beers, hehe :)"
Shanice A.,"San Jose, CA",2,2,1,5.0,10/7/2016,Good service don't live in this area come all the way here and the food was amazing and they got me water on time and server name was Sean wright. Was kinda cute pretty ! Score BJ's
Mitzy B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",543,297,40,4.0,12/28/2014,"Came in here on Xmas eve and had wonderful service! Most people would be bummed they had to work late on a holiday but she didn't seem to let it phase her and was more than accommodating to our group of 7 Love the Hopstorm IPA - not something I would seek out to buy for home consumption, but always enjoy it when I'm at BJs Chicken tortilla soup was scrumptious. Brussels sprouts had way too much acidity, and Alfredo pasta was slightly undercooked (however it was perfect as leftovers the next day!)  And obviously the pizookie was awesome! (We got the Oreo) I wish I remembered the brunette servers name, but she was great!"
Mike D.,"San Jose, CA",4,10,,2.0,11/16/2015,"We used BJ's group option for a party of about 25.  The food was pretty good.  The thyme lemon chicken was very good as was the spaghetti.  I can't speak to the pizza since I didn't have any but it was all consumed by my guests. What was totally lacking was communication and service.  I had signed a contract specifying the meal (it was provided by a BJ's manager, not by me) but the night of the dinner, BJ's didn't know what I had ordered.  Fortunately, I had a copy of the contract to show them.  It didn't make the order right (since the chicken came as a single portion--hard to serve 25 people from a single portion)--but BJ's did correct it finally.   Getting sodas, water and coffee was slow and problematic.  As was anything that required a request (like a plate).   As bad, although not all BJ's fault, was sitting outside.  It was warm enough on a cold night but the wind blew the plastic curtains around and the weights holding them banged against the walls so the place sounded like garbage can lids were rolling around.  I'd suggest considering other venues for large groups (the only place this BJ's has for large groups is outside) in bad weather or when the wind is blowing.  When the wind died down, the outside area was pleasant enough. The manager apologized.  These things do happen.  It could have just been a bad night.  Another guest said he had had good group dinners there.  Still, I would look for other options for large groups."
Larry G.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/5/2016,"Great food and awesome service!  I went there to celebrate three co-workers marriages coming up so had a party of 20.  Andrea V was our server and did an outstanding job!  She was super sweet and pleasant even though I know my party was kind of loud and annoying, lol.  Thanks Andrea, you are the best!

Sara M.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/4/2016,Sean wright was an awesome server. He made our experience great! He was attentive and quick. We will definitely be coming back !
Suzie D.,"Cupertino, CA",440,18,131,5.0,4/15/2016,Great atmosphere! Come here often. Staff is fun and professional. Rochelle is an Amazing waitress. Love the food and watching all the sports.
Bee D.,"Redding, CA",1,11,3,5.0,6/9/2016,"Justyn was our server.. he is so very respectful, attentive and hustles (ask for him when you go there).  We love their lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls, they're so yummy.  The place is clean and fun...  We are definitely going back!"
Christina T.,"San Jose, CA",243,80,62,4.0,7/19/2014,"We stopped by BJ's for lunch and a couple of beers.  Our party of 8 sat ourselves in the bar area. I ordered an Ahi Poke appetizer and an Angel Hair Classico with shrimp. Ahi Poke: Chopped sashimi grade ahi tuna and green and yellow onions marinated in our signature poke sauce. Topped with diced avocados and served with crisp wonton chips. Angel Hair Classico: Toasted garlic oil, fresh broccoli, Parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and basil. With grilled shrimp This pasta dish had a good amount of shrimp and broccoli.  The only downside was that it wasn't saucey enough for me so I asked for a side of Alfredo sauce. They didn't even charge me for it :)"
