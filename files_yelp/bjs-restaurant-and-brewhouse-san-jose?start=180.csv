Sarah M.,"San Jose, CA",1,95,184,1.0,8/26/2015,"Disappointed! Ordered pizza for delivery, half of pizza didn't have ingredients. Very sloppy!"
Andrea R.,"San Jose, CA",36,27,4,2.0,8/3/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants so I decided to do my 21st birthday dinner here and it was a terrible experience. Why it was terrible? - Server was giving off a bad vibe towards my group. I don't except you to be the nicest but they were giving off a vibe that they didn't wanna be there and that they were annoyed. Server barely came to our table and when they did, it's because we had to run around the restaurant to find them. One of my friends got the wrong order and they seemed annoyed about it. I'm giving him the server the benefit of the doubt since we're all going through stuff but please don't let it affect your service.  - One of us got their dinner about an hour later. Everyone was almost done eating but he hasn't gotten his yet. Apparently they forgot... - One had hair on their food and her food got taken away but they never got any of their food back when she specifically said she just wanted the fries instead.  - My food was okay and a bit cold.  I've been here many times and I've always liked my experience but it was a shabby experience for my 21st birthday dinner."
Kadedra Y.,"Gilroy, CA",13,1,,5.0,10/8/2016,"This past Friday was my first time having lunch at BJ's and the service was great. My server was Sean Wright and he was a very handsome, nice, and helpful individual."
Jozza M.,"San Jose, CA",437,129,124,1.0,7/22/2015,This review is for the bar. Erik C the bartender is a douchebag. Had a horrible experience here for the first time in years of going here. Very disappointed. People like him makes such a good place look bad!
Lisa M.,"San Jose, CA",1,10,,2.0,9/23/2016,Horrible service!!! Very disappointed!!! I have never waited so long to order(30 mins) and other (40 mins) for my food to be delivered!!! I get better service at a fast food place!!!
Christian T.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/20/2015,"I've been dining out to bj's quite often lately so I couldn't help but write a review for this location. On a side note, I found the restaurant's renovations cool.  Alright, so from walking in, the hosts sat me and my family ( or friends) in a timely manner. Nothing too long of a wait.  Food is pretty good, I'll give it 3.5 stars. I love the ""best beginnings"" appetizer as its a ton of appetizers in one. I also like the balsamic chicken and the meat lovers pizza. The guacamole burger I tried one time though was extremely salty.  In terms of service. I feel that the servers just need to be more attentive. The few occasions I've come here, the servers I have had take long to either take entree orders, get water refills, or even drop/pick up check. I could understand if the server was busy, but I noticed each time that we were one of, if not, the only the tables in their section. Coming from someone who works at a restaurant, water refills shouldn't take 10 minutes. But either than that, pizookie's hit the spot and will always keep me coming back to bj's. Just maybe not this location in the future."
Harsha G.,"San Jose, CA",531,562,1332,4.0,3/29/2013,"Was here with 3 other colleagues from out of state for lunch(none of them were familiar with BJs :)). All of them had never been to a BJ's and I was playing host. A couple of us drank and lunch special prices were a steal! A pint cost us only $3.50. One og us had the blondie (one of the popular beers that are brewed here) and I got the Nutty Brewnette, quite balanced. we ordered the appetizer sampler and I was pleased that my favorites avocado wrap and the mozarella sticks were a hit with the group.  One of us had Lactose intolerance and he was quite happy getting the chicken tacos for main course and he not only liked the tacos but also enjoyed the accompanying black bean chilli. Another friend had the quesadilla and he liked it too. The remaining two of us got a pizza and you can never go wrong with any of their pizzas.  We ended our meal with a trio pizookie 9 - got the chocolate, red velvet and cookie dough kinds. The red velvet cookie was way too sweet but we all enjoyed the pizookie nevertheless. This particular BJs seems larger than the ones' in newark and san mateo. It was also packed during lunch. However, we walked in around 1.30, hence didn't have to wait too long to get a table as most people were finishing up lunch around that time. The service was excellent. Our plates were removed perfectly after each course, our water was refilled perfectly and our waiter was very efficient and told us exactly in how much time we could expect our food. Food wasn't expensive and it came upto $16/person including tip calculated at 20%"
Trevor A.,"San Jose, CA",51,3,,2.0,9/3/2016,"My first time here at this location the service was insanely slow we sat down and for 10 minutes no one so much as took our drink order and had to call someone over for that and once they did everything came out slow, after our appetizer all our drinks were empty and our waiter walked by several times not noticing and finally someone at our table walked up to say something. Our food came out the burger was good but the fries were pretty cold and my brother got a cold baked potato and had to wait for his fries to come out 10 minutes after the rest of his meal based on this I would not be returning any time soon"
Bryan A.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/3/2016,"I'd give zero stars if I could, terrible service and food is sub par for the price. We were seated quickly but it took one of the people in our party to speak up to even get a server and then brought our drinks only to disappear for another 20 minutes, this time we had to speak to the assistant manager to get our server to return. The server passed by on at least 20-25 tines without acknowledging us or refilling the drinks. If you're looking for overpriced and underwhelming this would be a great choice."
Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",968,1930,3483,4.0,7/8/2015,"BJs is awesome. The ambience is cool & the menu offers a ton of items like burgers, pazookies, sandwiches, tacos, salads, pizza and cocktails. Hours are great & the space is huge. They do curbside takeout like Applebee's does & they offer special menus (kids, gluten-free). You can order online & even get catering services for your next event. I tried a flatbread pizza appetizer here that I thought was really tasty. The CA club flatbread came with grilled chicken breast, smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzarella, roasted garlic aioli and diced avocado. They're open until 1AM on Fri/Sat & midnight on other nights. This place is always a great option for when you ""don't know where to go"" or when you have a big group of people & you're trying to accomodate to everyone's particular taste in food. There's probably something here for everyone."
Sal G.,"San Carlos, CA",140,34,9,2.0,9/23/2016,"The only reason why I'm giving 2 stars is because of the following: 1.) I dont know what it was but every time they opened the door it smelled like straight manure. It was so awful. Right when I was about to say something, a family asked about it and asked them not to open the door but of course the waiter was rude to them and gave him sass ""well how am I supposed to serve the people outside huh?"" I was pretty upset.  2.) when we got in to ask for a table they said this ""great, just enter your phone number and we'll text you right when your table is ready!"" So we decided to stay nearby in the mall and walked for a bit. When we got our text we walked back but he said ""oh sorry you didn't come in the 5 minute limit that we have so you have to sit down and wait."" That made me really mad because they did NOT say anything about a 5 minute limit time. So shame on them.  3. Sal was great though. He was really nice and on top of everything so thank you Sal!"
Harpreet M.,"San Jose, CA",9,25,12,1.0,7/30/2015,There customer service is awful tonight I have been waiting 15 minutes just for take out and I ordered online 30 minutes ago!!! #pissedoff
Terry W.,"San Jose, CA",1,15,,4.0,2/21/2017,"This review doesn't pertain to the qualitity of tbe food served but to the the treatment received by the management staff.  I had purchased a gift card from BJ's, during its holiday promotion.  I went to use the card for the first time and was informed there was no balance. Since the main office was closed for the holiday, I had to call the following day (today). After a short but productive conversation with Jeff Bowers, he reissued a new card. We decided to once again have lunch at BJ's. The manager, Amanda, recognized us and asked if we were able to get things resolved. We informed her we had, but jokingly stated the main office told us lunch would also be on BJ's. To our surprise, when we got the bill, there was no charge. Thank you Amanda, not only for the lunch but for your professionalism and treatment of this issue."
Donna H.,"San Jose, CA",4,17,,5.0,5/3/2016,"Trevor was an amazing server. There were 36 of us with separate checks and yet he kept his cool and was very efficient and friendly. Can I ask for him whenever I eat there, please?!"
Henry S.,"Dublin, CA",387,1497,49,1.0,5/3/2015,"The wait is long, the service is slow and the food is over priced. Yes the atmosphere is cool and there's plenty of TVs to watch the game but my wife summed it up the best:  The pizza is half a step up from Pizza Hut. Skip it."
Michelle T.,"San Jose, CA",46,54,69,2.0,6/2/2015,"I started writing this review as I wait for my food and slowly perish from starvation....then my steak arrived a minute later.  It.was.rare. I waited a long time for a rare steak.  I tried to eat it but it just wouldn't go past my esophagus.  So our waiter took it back to the kitchen then came back with that same steak, now medium well, and burnt on the outside.  If it weren't for my sister who's visiting, I would've happily gone to Chipotle and gotten a steak bowl.   I've been to BJ's a few times because of the pizookie and the long wait is not unusual.  I don't know if it's just me turning into a snob, but it seems that the quality of their food is deteriorating.  Yes, I am aware that this place is not exactly a steakhouse. But still.  (the pizookie earlier was also oily). So, in the end, our waiter took the steak off from our bill.  I was happy for a couple of minutes until I heard him say that the neighboring table's mojitos are free. Now that's fishy...."
Veronica B.,"San Jose, CA",2,31,1,2.0,5/14/2015,"I'm done with this place. I usually drive to this BJs over the one that's closest to my house because I usually get excellent service here...whoops.  My boyfriend and I usually come to BJs late at night on weekdays because I work late. So there's no wait to be seated, we take a seat in the bar as usual. It was a Tuesday a little before nine. First, it took 15 minutes for someone to bring us menus. A server walked past several times without even looking at us. When we finally got our menu, I ordered wine quickly (the only good part of the meal, because it was half-off) and my boyfriend wanted a minute to look at the beer selection.  He asks for a minute, she's back ten minutes later with my wine. He orders a Belgian from their craft brew section, only for our waitress to tell us that BJs is discontinuing their craft selection and they didn't have what he wanted. In fact, she showed us a picture of the beer fridge to show what they had left, which is just sloppy. Why would you put a menu down in front of a customer that is so inaccurate and then get huffy when they need time to pick something else? After delivering that bad news, our waitress just stood there and didn't even try to suggest him anything else, so he said he'd need another minute but we at least got to order our food. Here's where it gets weird. It took her FOREVER to come back and take his drink order again. Like, he tried subtle eye contact, small hand gestures, and she just seemed determined to blow right past us. (And we both used to wait tables, so we're not unrealistic like some other customers.) He finally resorted to shouting at her back, which she still didn't notice. He got to order a beer at 9:30 (I was already done with my wine), and it came with our food, which brings me to my next point.  We'd ordered a pizza and a salad with the dressing on the side. It showed up around 9:45. The dressing was not on the side, and when the waitress asked if I wanted her to take it back, I straight-up told her that I wasn't willing to let that salad leave my sight because I was sure I'd never see it again.  So now she knows we're pissed, and decided to try and make up for it by checking in on us every minute after that which was just so annoying at that point. We seriously considered just asking for boxes when the pizza came so we could just eat at home, but we were hungry. My boyfriend complained, but the manager guy didn't say anything, just that he was sorry we didn't enjoy ourselves, then he turned around and left.  So the boyfriend and I will be patronizing Flames downtown from now on. I'd rather eat less good food in a louder, less adult atmosphere because at least I always leave there in a better mood than I arrived in. This experience was just bad, and the worst part was that if the service had taken longer, we at least could have gotten happy hour prices on our food. As it was, it was a 50 dollar tab for a lot of nothing and I'm not giving them any more of my money."
Mike D.,"San Jose, CA",30,10,7,5.0,7/1/2016,Near perfect experience. Pace of service at Bar was great - Brandon greeted me by name. Very professional and courteous
Emily P.,"San Jose, CA",264,348,175,5.0,6/12/2014,"This BJs is located at Oakridge Mall and is always a long wait because of the amount of people that come here. I'm still giving this place 5 stars because it's not their fault that this place is so good and everyone wants to come here! Yesterday I celebrated my son's 11th birthday there and had a party of 15. Because I'm so smart, I called right when they opened yesterday to make a reservation for 6:30pm. I was told reservations need manager's approval which was easy for them to get. I'm not sure if a manager's approval is always needed or it was just needed this week because of all the graduation dinners going on. For people that were just walking in the wait was one and half hours to two hours (which is the usual wait for this place but I think it was a little bit longer because of all the grad dinners going on). I got there 6:20pm and my table was ready on the dot by 6:30pm! Which is nice about this place when you have a reservation is that your whole party does not need to be there to be seated. We had a nice long table out on the patio setup. We had great and fast service the whole night. A huge plus was that all our food for dinner came out at once and all of the orders were correct (this is always a huge challenge when having a big party).  For dessert, everyone got pizookies! But before bringing everyone's pizookie out, they brought the birthday boy's out with a candle for us to sing happy birthday :) I would definitely come here again for when I have a big dinner party! TIP #1: You can only make reservations for a table if you have a party of 10 or more. TIP #2: Don't forget to give your BJs Rewards Card to earn points! If you don't have one, sign up for free!"
Ann N.,"San Jose, CA",92,20,3,5.0,7/12/2016,"Extreme customer service! Torrence waited on me and when I had a concern about ""wheat"" he went above and beyond to make sure I knew all my options"" the menu! Wow!"
