Paola B.,"San Jose, CA",54,107,51,5.0,4/17/2016,I always love coming here! Ambience is always on point and the servers are always so friendly and helpful.
Alfredo F.,"San Jose, CA",56,7,,1.0,11/13/2015,"The manager talked to me, he said he was going to send me some coupons but didn't live up to his word. Once again I'm dissapointed by this restaurant"
Paula A.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,52,47,1.0,5/24/2016,Wow the wait staff probably couldn't be worse. Had 3 waiters in 1 hr. No one got any of the orders right. No one came over to apologize or try to resolve the problems. Can't believe they can operate this poorly. I've been to several BJs but this one really has poor service.
Jeffrey C.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/19/2016,"Return to BJ's today, Grand Cru tastes good as usual, service of waiter Biagio is excellent"
Alyssa U.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/6/2016,"Honestly the one star is for the two servers we did get. They were nice and I understand that we were a small (2 person) party so we didn't get constant attention but the food was by far one of the worst experience I have had. Bjs is no longer to the standard that they once were. I also feel like they are skimping on foods that aren't even properly cooked. The Brussel sprouts we ordered were practically still raw, the ribs were dry and barely had any meat on them and the shrimp asparagus pasta just did not have taste to them. We left with a really bad taste in our mouths. On the bright side, the pazookie is the only thing that we felt was still the same as before. We most likely will return for awhile, at least to this location. :("
Amyangelbee N.,"San Jose, CA",25,36,29,5.0,3/2/2015,"I really love this place. I absolutely love the pizookie which are really delicious. My first experience here was awesome. I ordered the crunchy jalapenos burger which made me realize that i love crunchy and spicy burgers. I usually hate jalapenos but here i love it. My only pet peeve here is the lighting. I get that they dim it in the evening, but they apparently dimmed it too low for my area i for a while i couldn't see my burger clearly."
Denis C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,3,1.0,12/20/2016,"This place has awful service. My girlfriend and I experience probably, the worst service we've ever had at any restaurant. Please take a few minutes to read about our experience.  We were greeted warmly upon arrival and told that there would be a 20 minute wait for a table for 2. Which is fine, we were willing to wait. A few seconds later, one of their employees stated that they had a table for 2 available, and we were escorted to the table. That was the only pleasant thing that happened during our meal.  Nobody ever came to our table. Not to say hello, not to say ""I'll be right with you"", NOBODY!!! After 15 minutes of being ignored, I flagged down a waiter who was walking by and asked for water and let him know we were ready to order. He stated that we weren't his area, but he would still take care of us. And he did. He took our orders and brought us water. During the meal, he stated that he was going to take his dinner break and introduced us to a new server. The original waiter stated that they'd take care of dessert for us for the long wait. Something we didn't ask for but accepted as a sign of good faith. Once we were done with dinner, we asked the replacement waiter for dessert. He said, ""Its on its way out. It should be out shortly."" More than 30 minutes went by and nothing came out. He nervously came back to our table to apologize for the wait and he would personally go see what was taking so long. They had forgot about our dessert. He came back to apologize again and at that point we just wanted to pay and leave. The mall was closing and we had to finish Christmas shopping. He took more than 15 minutes to bring out the dessert and our check. He knew that we had waited almost an hour for dessert and stated that his manager was going to come by and discuss our terrible experience.  THE MANAGER NEVER CAME TO OUR TABLE!!! That was the ultimate slap in the face. I wanted to speak with the manager to explain how awful our experience was. But since he never came, I couldn't. We also couldn't finish Christmas shopping because of how long we waited for a Pazooki and the manager. Needless to say, we left the restaurant very upset, did not tip a dime and wrote a note to the irresponsible manager on the receipt.  I will never return to BJs at Oakridge Mall. I will also suggest to friends and family to never go their either. Their lack of urgency and respect is something I will NEVER forget.  Worst service we've ever had. I will do everything in my power to make my experience known to the masses and use every social media outlet to do so."
Mary T.,"San Jose, CA",130,89,97,3.0,6/4/2014,"This location really does deserve 3, average stars.  There is absolutely nothing memorable about this BJs. The waiters don't go above and beyond, matter of fact they do the bare minimum.. I'm not one of those SUPER PICKY customers but hey, I'd like to see some smiles and maybe a couple of winks here and there.  I almost want to buy them  all shots and tell them to have some personality.  The food?!? Well, it's BJs.. Your normal type of food...You'll find bjs everywhere, im giving the ratings based on the service, which was Bleh. .. But  if you're curious, I'm in love with their soups! Tortilla and tomato soup is mouth watering.. I'd try if I were you.."
Phoebe P.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,,3.0,12/2/2016,Good food. Good beer. Can accommodate big parties. Good luck finding parking in the Oakridge mall on the weekends though. They do have valet parking though.
Anu M.,"San Jose, CA",448,889,1280,3.0,1/23/2014,"First up, I love this location! It has CPK, Buca di beppo and several other restaurants nearby.  We came here recently on a weekday, for a very late dinner. Al though we got seated immediately, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was filled with patrons at 11 in the night. We comfortably seated ourselves in a booth and ordered the following: Avocado Egg Rolls - Love this one! Thai Chicken Salad - It was just okay Southern Fried Chicken - Okay Service is very friendly! But all the meals are very fatty. It's nice that they display calories next to each meal, but hard to find a decently healthy meal here."
Noah A.,"Alameda, CA",93,31,22,5.0,7/10/2015,"Great food, And the server ""RANDY"""" Your amazing !!  Suggested my good and drink and they both were DELICIOUS !!!!!!!  Thank you!!  Wouldn't come again unless I have a reason to visit, drove from Alameda hahah Awesome place"
Eloquent E.,"San Jose, CA",5,17,14,5.0,9/15/2015,"You know I really did not enjoy their food selection at this brewhouse before but its has changed for the better! They offer a ""semi-healthier"" variety of food that is easy on the wallet, but at the same time a bit healthier and way more flavorful than their last menu. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had our plates, drinks, box, and bill on the spot! Thanks you for having us, made us feel welcome and they revamped the menu; we had Stuffed Mushrooms (appetizer), Quinoa Roasted Salmon, and the Chicken Alfredo! All good dishes with plenty of flavor. Also, I had the black and tan variety beer that was on point! Hats of too you guys, we'll be back let's just hope y'all stay that way. Ps. Our waiter was an african man with a ponytail and white coat on and glasses good job! We will be back!!"
Lauren C.,"Saratoga, CA",349,1,,5.0,5/31/2016,"Normally I don't go to BJs because I try and to stay away from chain restaurants, but a friend loves the restaurant so we went. My table of 5 was served by Frankie. Frankie was so knowledgeable about the beer selection and food selection (we had very picky eaters and suggested offers for each picky eater). He knew when to come to our table and when to not. He was so personable and he made us feel important. I will go back to BJs because of him. Great food and most importantly great service!"
Becky W.,"San Jose, CA",96,103,563,2.0,1/24/2015,"First of all the waiter was very friendly and helpful. However, I only went there for a pazookie and decided to get the peanut butter s'mores one that everyone had been taking about. I am typically an Oreo or salted caramel type of gal but I thought I would tip toe out of my comfort zone and try something new and different, especially since I am a peanut butter fiend.  It was awful. There wasn't even a cookie under it.  I was extremely disappointed and I figured the waiter would at least tell you that there was no cookie involved. Also, this particular location does not use Haagen Dazs  ice cream which makes the pazookie  10x better. They used a basic vanilla bean ice cream that was just not getting the job done.  Looks like I'll be sticking to the bjs on Coleman from here on out."
gilda v.,"San Jose, CA",19,28,,2.0,11/23/2016,"The only time I've had their food is through Eat24 delivery, and the delivery service knocked a couple stars off my rating. The driver got lost (my home is VERY easy to find), and by the time he got here, our burgers and fries were nearly cold. The burger itself was tasty, if lukewarm, but the fries were soggy, not crisp as advertised. Very disappointed for a $40 meal for two. Next time, I'll drive through Jack in the Box."
Tametra J.,"San Jose, CA",35,13,2,1.0,2/26/2016,"We went there for take out. The online ordering was simple and the person who brought our food to the car was prompt and polite. When we got home we found our order was incomplete. The appetizer was missing sauces, the burger was ordered with condiments and it came dry with undercooked bacon, and my large salad was missing the cheese and had only 1 small cup of dressing. And for dessert my strawberry  bengiet came with no strawberries. I gave a $10 tip and received no utensils.  Horrible waste of $60!!"
Linnea E.,"San Jose, CA",364,689,145,3.0,8/22/2012,"It's ok.  Food is fine if you know what to order (and what to avoid).  Service is inconsistent. Food: salads usually good. i love the sesame chicken salad. bruchetta is tasty. avocado eggrolls are yummy.  skip the pasta dishes. bland.  pizza is good. service:  all over the place. i've had decent service. last night was horrible. really really horrible. screwed up even a simple order for a kid's dish of ice cream not once, but twice. seriously? that's pathetic. i'd say this is not a destination place for us, but rather somewhere we tolerate when we're at that end of the mall and hungry, and not willing to wait for cheesecake factory."
R M.,"San Jose, CA",20,26,8,1.0,4/19/2015,Ive been meaning to write a review about this restaurant. My husband and I have been here twice and had a horrible experience both times. The bartender was horrible. We brought in Jell-O shots for our friends birthday and the server asked for one went around the corner and took it while on his shift. He recommended the gumbo. Don't eat the gumbo.  If you want good gumbo go to Cheesecake Factory. I barley ate any it was so gross.
Andrea M.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,1,1.0,12/1/2016,"Don't order BJs through Door Dash, Door Dash was fine but I ordered the avocado egg rolls and the avocado was completely black and the eggroll was just soggy. How do you not put a little lemon in the avocado so it doesn't turn black and if they were fried right they should not have been soggy, I order eggrolls from other places and they are still crispy the next day. I also ordered their Beignet and it tastes like a biscuit with sugar and cinnamon, won't be ordering from there anymore :-("
Debbie S.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,6/1/2016,Had dinner last night in the bar and I must say Frankie was the bomb!!!  He was attentive without being overbearing.  I will be back.
