Patrice L.,"Livermore, CA",94,23,34,5.0,6/13/2015,Great service from Crystal! We came here with over 30 people from an 8 year old softball tournament . Not one single complaint. she was wonderful with the kids and all of the adults . The food came out in a timely manner and she was very attentive to any needs that came in between. Thanks again for a great experience .
roger t.,"Belmont, CA",3,107,17,3.0,3/27/2016,Does anyone regulate the curbside service slots?  I ordered online to find myself double parked till someone finally eating finally left from Bucas!!! Otherwise I would give them a higher review since I do enjoy their food.
Ray W.,"San Jose, CA",128,54,56,2.0,5/18/2014,"This is just your typical BJ's. Nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary. If you go to BJ's you have to get the appetizers. I feel like the entrees are really hit or miss but the appetizers never seem to disappoint. The potato skins are a personal favorite of mine. Unlike most places, the potato skins are cooked to perfection. The outside is extra crispy even though the skins are cut thicker than most other places. It's also topped with bacon, green onions and sour cream. The Avocado Eggrolls are not a bad choice either. However, the sweet sauce that comes with it is a bit too sweet. Both these appetizers are super filling so I would recommend getting a smaller entree. Their deep dish pizzas are a personal favorite of mine, especially the Chicken and Bacon one. It's loaded with chicken and bacon (of course) along with green onions, tomatoes and a white creamy sauce. It is delicious with some red peppers sprinkled on top. I decided to try the traditional deep dish with sausages, bell pepper, tomatoes and onions. I must say, I was pretty disappointed. Some slices had no flavor and some slices were extremely salty. Not entirely sure what was going on with that. The one thing that really irked me was how slow the service was. My girlfriend and I spent two hours there but only 20 minutes of that were spent eating. The rest of the time was spent waiting for our waitress to take our order and bring our food. We waited a good 20 minutes before we could flag her down to bring us our check and another 15 minutes for them to charge my card. The service was terrible and the food was awful. I would only recommend going here if you can't decide what to eat and happen to be in the area."
Vivian A.,"Arvada, CO",858,880,1831,3.0,11/22/2011,"This BJ's is attached to Oakridge Mall. We were shopping at the mall when we decided we were getting hungry and we called in to put our name in the queue. The guy on the phone told us there wasn't a line but we figured we'd put our name in since we still had to hit up one more store. By the time we got there about 20 minutes later, there was a 30 minute wait but since we had called ahead of time, it was only a lil' under 10 for us to get our table ready.  Sweet. Ordered a Frosty Peach to calm my shoppers nerves and this thing was refreshing but GANGLY SWEET! I love sweets but this was like dumped on sugar.  It seemed like a light pour and heavy on the sugar but 10 minutes later I was feeling a bit happy, so there was definitely some alcohol masked under all that sugar. What we swallowed: FRIED ARTICHOKE HEARTS: I love artichokes. I love anything battered and fried. These tasted like those bottled marinated artichoke hearts you put on your salad, battered and deep fried. I'm glad I tried them but they didn't ""WOW"" me enough to order them again. FRIED CALAMARI: Good portion with nice dipping sauces. It wasn't chewy, so that's a big plus. CHICKEN WON TONS: These were more like a cheesy-chicken wonton. Still a good flavor whatever was in the middle but good thing there were only three in a serving 'cuz these weren't that great either. SPINACH and ARTICHOKE with add-on ITALIAN SAUSAGE DEEP DISH PIZZA: This was scrumptious. I'm glad I ordered the Italian Sausage as it cut up the spinach and artichoke. The bread is spot on: nice and doughy with crispy edges. I only had a small piece as the three appetizer dishes were more than enough food. The pizza was even better the next day (just make sure you toast it so you get that toasted edge bread action). HALF PEANUT BUTTER/HALF CHOCOLATE CHUNK PAZOOKI: You can't come to BJ's without having a pazooki! Even completely full from the appetizers this was happily inhaled. Hot, moist, the slighty salty peanut butter cookie offset the chocolate chunks, topped with oozing cold vanilla ice cream all in one bite gooified in your mouth. You can't go wrong here. The Canadian ordered the POT ROAST open face sandwich. The portion was a bit on the small size (glad we got appetizers) and he said it was lukewarm. It was actually an open faced sandwich with a big hunkin' mashed potato scoop in the middle with chunks of pot roast on each side. He said the flavor was good though, too bad it wasn't served hotter. The server was nice but a bit forgetful. He would take our order and three steps later, completely forget what we just said.  Three stars for the Frosty Peach, Fried Artichoke Hearts, Chicken Won Tons, and the lukewarm Pot Roast Sandwich (4 items). Four stars for the Pizza, Fried Calamari, and Pazooki (3). Three and a half stars on the round down so three stars."
Jennifer T.,"San Jose, CA",529,285,823,4.0,5/30/2012,"I went here to catch the laker game...and they lost so i'll try not to let that influence my review!! I hadn't had BJ's in a while and i remember that i used to LOVE the great white pizza but for some reason it was super bland this time around :(  Luckily, they have the best avocado eggrolls ever.  I have tried avocado egg rolls at many places but no other place has that delicious sweet sauce that compliments the eggrolls so well.  I feel so bad for all the people allergic to avocados because I would keep coming back to BJ's JUST for the avocado egg rolls. My co-worker knows my obsession with patty melts so she recommended a sandwich there that is pretty much a patty melt (just with a different name).  Look in the sandwich section for sourdough bread and like a burger meat/onions.  This sandwich definitely will NOT disappoint.  Want to make it even better?  Get a side of thousand island to go with it.  You can thank me later! To end my meal, I got what people actually come to BJ's for...their PIZOOKIES!!!  get a half and half pizookie so you can have some V-A-R-I-E-T-Y :) ENJOY!!!"
Puja K.,"San Jose, CA",158,213,777,4.0,1/11/2014,"Late on the yelp review. I've been here more times than I can remember: more so during happy hour than regular hours. Their pizzas are really good (and half off the mini during HH!!), and so are there potato wedges. They also have a nice selection of beers...some that they brew themselves and some on tap. I recommend pear cider.  You'll always want to save room for dessert as BJs is known for their pizookie. A soft/right out of the oven cookie with 2 scoops of ice cream. Mmmm sooooo gooooood."
Angelica C.,"San Jose, CA",68,8,39,3.0,9/28/2013,"First, lets begin with location. Restaurant is at a mall which makes this place a good choice for dinner after a long day of shopping. There are other exceptional restaurants lined up as well next to BJ's.  Second, BJ's allows call ahead seating so I suggest to call because the wait is quite long on weekends.  Third, the waiters and hosts are all very friendly and charismatic. They made dining a pleasure.  Now, lets move on to the food. The calamari is perfect! I always get it. The Clam Chowder soup (with no bacon) is delicious. I wish I had more. It's creamy and the chunky contents such as the potatoes and clams are cut in small pieces and aren't too big to eat. You'll be taking big spoonfuls for every bite once you get it.  Presentation isn't impressive but the taste of each dish is satisfying. I ordered the Alaskan Salmon. The plate is a light dish with perfectly sized Salmon covered in a light white sauce, a tasty rice with herbs, and vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and cucumbers.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp gumbo. This plate doesn't look big when it's first presented, but it's actually quite a lot. It's a heavy dish so if you have a small stomach, you'll get full quick.  And obviously, the pizookie. This amazing little circle of a cookie has different flavors like Chocolate Chip, Cookies and Cream, and Red Velvet. If you're an Oreo lover, you'll love Cookies and Cream. In addition to the Oreo cookie and vanilla ice cream, it's topped with a whipped cream that appears to be mixed with very little crumbs of Oreo that compliments the pizookie nicely. If you're in a table with 3-4, I suggest to get the pizookie trio platter and just share. With an appetizer, main dish, and drink, you may already be full before the dessert comes out. But even if you are full, it's a MUST to eat a pizookie at BJ's so make sure you save room for dessert!"
Richard J.,"San Jose, CA",803,111,428,4.0,9/10/2013,"$3.50 tall beer!! My buddies love going to this place to drink, it's a good place to chill before dinner time. I actually like the service before dinner they are just awesome. I gave it a five star because those reason. I have not tried a lot of the dish on the menu but for a clean bathroom,good customer service and awesome beer deserve a high rating."
Donovan T.,"San Jose, CA",694,630,562,1.0,7/14/2011,"I'm usually not a man of few words but I ate here not too long ago and the stuck up girl who i will refer to as my server actually asked me to clean my own plate and table off. NO JOKE.. Not like I made a mess or anything, she actually asked me to put my utensils on the plate and wipe the crumbs off the table onto the plate and hand it to her. I seriously was dumbfounded. Management, I don't know what kind of idiots you hire but I'm seriously done with this place."
Van N.,"San Francisco, CA",235,308,350,3.0,9/2/2013,"Pros: -food was good -large portions -great ambiance -server was nice Cons: -the hostess did not acknowledge us and did not communicate our wait time -the server told us she was sick, (coming from a food service background) did not reassure us -the server was young, not 21 and not well informed on the bj's beer menu"
Kyle P.,"Fort Lee, VA",271,33,241,5.0,3/6/2014,"The pizookies and Parmesan Crusted Chicken will change your life. Excellent drink selection. Due to it's popularity, be prepared for a wait if you show up at prime eating times. No complaints other than that after upwards of two dozen trips to three different establishments."
Samantha D.,"Santa Clara, CA",5,3,,5.0,4/5/2016,We had  our daughters 2nd birthday here at bj's after a horrible experience at cheese cake factory and waiting 2 hours not to be seated ...bj's brew house gave us great service and excellent food. Our server Sean did a awesome job and was very friendly  .Thanks so much for helping us make our daughters birthday special:)
Sonia T.,"San Jose, CA",209,237,248,4.0,11/23/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to while at Oakridge.  It is a lot cheaper than eating at Cheesecake Factory. I definitely come here for the pasta, and their legendary pizookie  Cons: Be warned you will have to wait to be seated. It is very rare for me to have a table within 15 mins. The food takes quite awhile to come out. So don't come here if you are starving or in a rush. The food is good, but sometimes it can be sort of bland. I give it a 4 out of 5. I do like coming here, but it's not a place I would go out of my way to eat at."
Alex Z.,"Escondido, CA",2,4,1,5.0,10/1/2016,"A friend and I came here around 8pm on a Tuesday. We were seated us fast and had the best server! Biagio was amazing! I've eaten at almost every BJ's in SoCal this was my first time visiting one in the Bay Area and by far it was the best experience I've had. If you go in definitely as to be sat in his section, he knows his stuff and will make your meal even more enjoyable!"
Michelle D.,"Campbell, CA",355,398,1018,3.0,8/4/2013,"The main reason I visit BJ's is for their pizookies.  The food is ok, but I would rather just order appetizers and dessert. The chicken nachos were very good.  I loved how crispy the tri-colored chips were and the amount of toppings that were on it.  The cheese was warm and not very melted, but overall the nachos were good. I ordered the soup and salad entree with the tomato soup and the caesar salad.  The tomato soup and the caesar salad were generic and they were not bad.  It was a good lunch portion, filling, but not heavy. I shared a half original chocolate chip, half white chocolate chip macadamia pizookie with my friends.  The cookie was nice and crunchy on the edge, but nice and chewy in the center.  They put just the right amount of ice cream on top as well.   Since we had a large party, the service took forever just to order and then wait for the food.  Our reservation started at 1:30 and we did not leave till 4:30.  Because our party was big, they sat us outside.  When the plastic shades were down, it felt muggy and when they opened the plastic shades, the sun was on our backs.  There were some umbrellas but they were in fixed places and they could not be moved to cover everyone.  It was difficult to get a hold of our waiter at times and we had to be conservative drinking our water because we weren't sure when we would get a chance to flag him down. When I come back, I will request to eat indoors and stick with the appetizers and desserts."
Jordan D.,"San Jose, CA",63,2,1,5.0,10/13/2016,"I go to BJ's semi-regularly, and typically enjoy the food and the service. This particular time actually stood out. I dined in with my girlfriend at around 10 pm last night. Biagio, our server, took great care of us. You could tell it was at a relaxed point in the evening, and instead of feeling left alone while some servers would be off chatting with co-workers, Biagio was attentive at all the right points of our meal. I think the only thing he didn't check back to make sure I was enjoying was the dinner salad I had ordered. Ironically it seemed that the salad was the only item with an issue - it had been garnished with cilantro instead of parsley (not typically a problem, but I can't stand the taste of cilantro). Not really an issue, but a noticeable error for me. Otherwise, all food tasted fantastic (even the rest of the salad was excellent) and the drinks were tasty with refills offered at an appropriate time. It was clear he cared that we enjoyed our meal, and did everything in his power to make it so we could."
Tyler K.,"San Jose, CA",451,191,191,4.0,1/16/2015,"I like BJ's. I love the feeling during and after. I also really enjoy the restaurant ;) I come here often for the beer (and their home-brews are amazing) and pizookies (to die for) quite often. However, I do typically enjoy their meals. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was a pretty solid sandwich. My biggest recommendation is that if you're a first timer, you must try their red ale, Jeremiah Red. It is fantastic."
Dianne M.,"San Jose, CA",10,3,,5.0,7/8/2015,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  My family loves this place too!  This is our ""go to"" restaurant.   We always head to the bar area seating to avoid having to wait for a table.  Love that you can swoop on a table as soon as its available.  Or ask the people sitting if they can save it for us as soon as they're done.   ONLY AT BJ'S THAT WE ORDER OUR DESSERT FIRST! THEN WE HAVE OUR APPETIZER/ENTREE.  EVERYONE SHOULD DO THIS!   The food is always good.  Service is great.  If you don't get the service you like, then say something!  Yes, sometimes the servers may occasionally fall behind and forget, but they are apologetic and try to make up for it.  You may have to flag down your server for something like a togo container.  If you're in that much of a hurry, get up and ask.  Seriously, why can't people sometimes just be curteous and not be so expectant with standards.   I love the BJ Rewards program.  Getting emails of the special offers is good too!  If you live around the area it's good to enroll in the program. My kids are old enough to go there on their own, get a meal, and use my rewards card."
Martha Stuart H.,"San Jose, CA",21,152,8,4.0,5/6/2016,This place is good to come have a drink at the bar they have plenty of tvs to watch sports. Their food is OK. I mostly come for drinks and once in a blue moon I'll grab a small pizza.
Josefina A.,"Brentwood, CA",9,5,2,1.0,9/29/2015,I went for a school fundraiser on a Tuesday night. We arrived there at 7.10pm. They told us we had to wait 40 minutes and we accepted. They had ran out of pagers so they asked for my phone number so they could text us. I get the text 45min later I get there 4 min after to find out they sat another party. Lame. The hostess did not give us any other choice or tried to fix the inconvenience. Never going there again. Train your staff. Customers will def walk away.
