Ali L.,"Mountain View, CA",11,5,,4.0,4/29/2015,"I came here after shopping with my friend and starving. We ended up waiting a pretty long time bc our order got dropped the first time, made wrong the second time and then not going through the third time. By the forth time it came out the without buffalo sauce on a buffalo chicken pizza. That all sounds bad but our waitress Kadie had our pizza comp'd and kept apologizing and brought us a side of buffalo sauce for our pizza. After it all our food was selfish and we left overly full!!!"
Kai H.,"San Jose, CA",55,38,1,1.0,9/25/2014,"Every single time....EVERRRYYY SINGLE TIIIME I have been here (not my choice) the service is SA-LOW.   Where in the hell do they find these people?  Cold food, wrong order...and an hour or more to get our food....after being seated...20 min to get water?!!!! WATER?! ugh."
Steven P.,"Campbell, CA",215,56,30,1.0,10/11/2015,"Worst service ever, they were too busy hitting on each other and the customers to actually help their  guests at there table.. Oh and the food was cold.. Thanks guys!"
Angel K.,"San Jose, CA",176,292,2781,2.0,8/21/2013,"Came here a couple of times when we had big group dinners. The wait is always horrendous if you want to eat at a normal time. Even when we came early around 4:30 PM we had to wait about 10-15 minutes before we could get seated. The service here is okay. It's usually pretty slow, but our server always stopped by every time we tried to wave her down.  For some reason, all of the silverware and utensils we had were filthy. We had utensils that still had food stuck to them, cups that had stains in them (one's that you could scrap off with a fingernail) and plates that had things stuck to them too. Didn't make me feel too good when I saw how dirty everything was. Made me wonder how the dishes that the food was served on looked before they got to the table.  Food wasn't anything too special. The highlight of the meal was probably the avocado egg rolls but I could just be biased because I love avocados and a sweet sauce. We also got a deep dish pizza and southern fried chicken. Pizza wasn't anything too special and chicken was just okay. Nothing that really wowed us.  Pazookies used to be one of my favorite desserts, but there was something off about the pazookie. Something didn't taste right and I wasn't sure if it was because of my taste buds. It was something in the cookie that tasted off, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. White chocolate macadamia nut is my absolute favorite pazookie, I'll probably give it another try the next time we have a huge group dinner outing to see if it's any different. Maybe it was just that batch? TL;DR: might have to wait to be seated, good for big groups and beer, food isn't anything spectacular and you have to shell out quite a bit for dinner."
Alvaro A.,"San Jose, CA",13,1,4,5.0,4/2/2016,I'm rating a 5 stars for the service I just received from Kelly S. She was great with my kids. Even though we had a mishap with our order she made our experience very delightful. I also want to thank the General Manager Taryn for ensuring we were taking care of. I surly will be back to see Kelly.
Joy H.,"San Jose, CA",27,33,62,2.0,8/28/2014,"I didn't write a review for the first time, but this is the SECOND time they forgot my add on for avocados for pizza on take out. Good thing I caught them this time before I left! When they gave the pizza back, they just added the avocado without heating it and it was just cold. It's also hard to cut out the slices one by one because they aren't cut down all the way. Good food but sucks at service.  They always forget add ons."
Ricki M.,"Hayward, CA",0,4,2,1.0,9/13/2016,"Food was not the best. Siracha cheese dip, more like a can of melted cheese with tomatoe on top"
Lydia D.,"San Jose, CA",0,48,9,1.0,12/22/2016,"Happy hour ends at 7pm, but our server didn't know if happy hour was on. Got seated at 6:30pm and ordered appetizers. Our server asked another server that was on lunch and asked about the happy hour.  That server said happy hour was only served at the bar.  That's such bs because I've been seated in the patio before before 7pm and we got the happy hour there. The food took a long time and the people bringing out the food didn't know which food belong to which table. Not very organized. This was a work party and we wanted to do spilt bills but the server said she asked us about that.  That's another lie. My coworker got the wrong entrée and he took a bite out of it before the server ran out to grab the plate back because it was the wrong one. Apparently they gave his dish to another table. He had to wait for his food that they ended up comping for free. That doesn't make up for the mistake. We started to wonder what they did with that last dish that took back that had been bitten into. What still really bugs me is how happy hour is only served at the bar. The bar isn't that big to accommodate all the people coming for happy hour right?"
Mary-Anne M.,"San Jose, CA",17,41,16,2.0,11/21/2015,"What happened tonight?  I used to be a fan of BJ, but service tonight was not great.  Did not check up on us, refills did not happen till at the end, forgot one order and was brought at the very end. The bison burger did not come with fries and was not all that."
Christina N.,"San Jose, CA",9,71,15,4.0,10/9/2014,"I usually receive great service here which makes my experience more enjoyable :) I personally don't like their pastas, but my friends and I have enjoyed their burgers! I like the California burger for when I'm feeling fatty and grilled Atlantic salmon for when I want to eat a bit cleaner. I also love their fries--thin and crispy! And their pizookies as well, my favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut. It's a decently priced place to eat at if I'm looking to grab lunch and catch up with a friend :)"
Scott B.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/10/2016,"Saturday night we went to BJ's for dinner with another couple.  Although the wait was long it was worth it in the end.  The service was okay, not fantastic, but okay, and the food was great!"
Andres A.,"Campbell, CA",101,70,1,1.0,1/23/2016,"I'm beginning to see a pattern here. I called in an order and was told 25 minutes. I get there and the order hasn't even been out through yet.  Now I'm told no longer than 10 minutes, 20 minutes later the order finally comes out.  The pizza wasn't even sliced.  I'm not sure where the breakdown in service is happening. It wasn't an especially busy night, I counted at least four empty tables.  The kitchen couldn't have been slammed.  I would not recommend and will not come back. I'd recommend either Buca di Beppo or Pizza kitchen a few doors down"
Melanie N.,"San Jose, CA",136,16,1,1.0,4/28/2016,"I wish I could give this restaurant less than one star. I met some friends to celebrate a birthday. (BJs wasn't my choice) Our first server disappeared for a long period of time (we were waiting for a 4th friend to show up and didn't want to order without her). Thankfully we got a new server, Miguel who was the ONLY thing positive about the visit.  1) Our beers were warm so we sent them back. My friend ordered a margarita without salt to replace the beer she sent back and it came with salt. 2) We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer and ended up with a stale, mangled platter of ""bottom of the bag"" chip pieces. My friend asked the expo for ranch and he never returned with any. 3) My friends side salad was ordered and requested to be served before our entrees. It came out after our entrees. 4) Two of us ordered Mediterranean Pita Tacos without onions and they came with onions. We sent them back and the new batch still had pieces of onions. We saw a server (Patrick) and asked if he could take them back to the kitchen and he looked at us like we asked him to do something completely insane/ridiculous. I thought maybe it was his first day on the job but it turns out he's worked there for a long time and it wasn't ""his problem"" to deal with. The manager on duty didn't seem too apologetic when we requested him to our table. He was quick to offer a discount and didn't ever come back to check in on the end of our experience. Clearly, if we had this many mistakes with our table, there must be other parties with problems too. It seems like no one was willing to take accountability. It's safe to say I will never return. Not even for happy hour.  I feel for Miguel, who clearly holds himself to a high standard of customer service. The kitchen, management and other servers do not support the experience he tried very hard to provide us with. We tipped Miguel well but realize not all patrons will be as forgiving to Miguel's ""lack of support""."
Cathie N.,"San Jose, CA",477,176,1057,3.0,6/24/2013,"Their service isn't always great. We were here with a group of 16 for a birthday and most of us got pizza and shared with each other. The people that ordered after everyone got their food first and the two of us that ordered salads got their food 5 mins after everyone got their pizza. Our server seemed confused when I asked if the salads were coming. I guess she thought everyone had gotten their food. I had ordered the Enlightened mango chicken salad. It is a new item on the menu, and I was kind of disappointed that the mangoes were not even ripe. They were really hard. The sauce to the salad was really sweet and it was topped with some sort of pepper powder. Possibly paprika.  My boyfriend had a split cheeseburger and Mediterranean pizza. The Mediterranean pizza was super cheesy. It had like feta and the regular cheese. As for the cheeseburger one, he liked it a lot, but I didn't try it because I don't eat bacon. Wish they had better service so I could come back."
s m.,"San Francisco, CA",59,16,3,4.0,12/22/2014,"Had the shrimp lettuce wraps, and a starter salad with beets. The food was fresh and tasted good. Wait times weren't bad overall - 15 min to get a table, 15min for our apps, and another 10 min for our dinner. Customer service was good - our waiter was friendly, funny, and attentive without being over bearing. One star lost because it did take a while to get some condiments for my friends burger. All in all it was a nice casual spot, with fresh salads, friendly service, and a welcoming atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this particular BJs to anyone in the area."
Akash K.,"Redwood City, CA",384,418,83,2.0,8/1/2013,"Let me just say that I've been a longstanding member of the ""I must fork over bucketloads of money to BJ's"" club. In Phoenix, my homies and I went there twice a week for happy hour. Twice a week ... ahh the memories. Anyway, I went to this BJ's expecting the same quality of food. Big mistake. First, the beer is good. Actually since I've last gone, the beer has gotten slightly better because they have more options. My problem was the food. Everything we got was almost inedible. How do you screw up mac and cheese? It had no cheese in it. It was mac and grease. A small pile of mac and grease. That's enticing! The stuffed mushrooms were runny and flavorless. The asian mango salad was just bad. The mangos were raw, the dressing didn't go with any of the flavors, and the salad was wilting. I'm sorry, but next time I'll just go to the Cheesecake Factory that's 10 feet away for a beer and some snacks."
Juan M.,"San Jose, CA",15,67,724,1.0,11/3/2014,"Wow!!! This is the most worst time to get here,drinks over poor on alcohol,food don't event close to what we ask (cool) service terrible,push all the time for next course when we try to enjoy are moment in here,we ask for few things and never came on the table,the server never show give any apologize or something."
Tien D.,"Sacramento, CA",4,63,7,3.0,3/3/2015,"I tend to come here for lunch more than dinner. One of my go to dishes on the lunch menu is the BBQ chicken platter. It is a great deal for $6.95 since you get a grilled chicken breast and bbq chicken slider and fries and very small bit of cole slaw. The chicken is not smothered in bbq sauce either, which I like. If you want more sauce it comes with a side of extra sauce for dipping. The fries are hit and miss as sometimes they are perfectly hot and crispy and other times they are cold and soggy.  My other go to thing to order is the mahi mahi or shrimp tacos. It comes with two tacos for lunch and you can get the fish grilled or fried. You can get one of each or one fish one shrimp. They don't skimp on the shrimp so theres usually one in each bite.  Good place to go for a quick lunch."
Linda P.,"Kansas City, MO",135,286,1188,4.0,12/4/2011,"I don't believe I've ever had anything I didn't like on the menu. I usually go for dessert with a girlfriend for their infamous Pizookie which is a big hot cookie topped with oozing melting cold ice cream.   Their club is actually surprisingly big also and delicious.  I love to get half a Great White (alfredo chicken garlic pizza) with another half someone else likes. They specialize in deep dish pizzas, but also have thin crusts and BJ's is a brewery so they make their own beer. If it's your first time try the sampler it gives you a feel for all the flavors they have. A new spin is their berry cider which I don't believe you can buy in a bottle at a grocery store.  Or if you want more alcohol beer flavor they have one mixed with a beer."
Brandon L.,"Milpitas, CA",8,7,,1.0,3/1/2016,"Today I ate at this resturant and was very disappointed. We had an issue with the food were the first part was our guests fault were he order the wrong dish however the other pizza came out wrong. While the first food went back, we ended up waiting another 25 minutes for the food to come out again. I'm a server myself so I'm not one to complain but when I have poor service, I have to speak up. I was very disappointed with how it was handled. While the server was doing an alright job. The manager never came to check on us. I will not be coming back to this location as it seems that the guests needs were not important"
