Cristal H.,"San Jose, CA",116,80,7,3.0,2/6/2015,"Normally I enjoy this place very much and have had great experiences, but last night was not one of them.  1 Star - For being open later than most restaurants. 1 Star - For their menu and expanded beer selections. 1 Star - For cleanliness and general politeness of its employees.  Last night - I wanted nothing more than to leave. It was just two of us, the host had us seated immediately and advised us that our server would be by shortly. Okay, standard. 5 minutes, nothing. 10 minutes, nothing. A friendly server named Tasha walked by and asked if we'd have drink orders taken, and said she'd happily take them and send our server over. She returned a few minutes later with our drinks and asked if he came by, Nope. She was nice enough to take our orders. Since we sat down I had noticed a server being awfully chatty with two girls sitting in a corner booth, assuming he was off I didn't think anything of it at first. Until about 10 minutes after our food came out, and this guy came over and asked how our food was. Who the hell are you? Oh, dude in the corner IS our server. Nice.  Tasha kept coming over and checking on us and she was wonderful. Once we finished our meal, we sat patiently for someone to ask us if we wanted dessert or the check. 5 minutes..10...seriously? Again? And who was standing in the corner with the two girls at the booth, oh of course, our server. So we flagged down Tasha and politely asked for our bill, and also confirmed if the gentleman in the corner was our server, he was. We asked if she could be our server and have the check put in her name so the tip would go to her. Justyn D (our ""server"") - we were there for an hour, you came over for 2 seconds and we didn't know who the hell you were because you spent almost the entire time talking to the two girls in the corner booth. If you didn't want to work, you should have asked the host not to seat anyone in your section. It's not unreasonable for patrons to come to your establishment and expect to be acknowledged.  Tasha was an absolute delight!"
Alyssa B.,"San Jose, CA",297,32,130,5.0,10/8/2013,"This BJs gets all 5 stars because of their manager Zeke. He goes above and beyond customer service for his customers. Opens the door for you, treats you like an old friend, and even walks you out. He's done this with me and the people I go with on multiple occasions. Hopefully you get him when coming to this place.  In terms of desserts, red velvet pazookie is a MUST EAT. If you like pizza, hand tossed are thin bread and pretty darn good as well if you get the right combination."
Katherine C.,"Cincinnati, OH",432,300,1223,4.0,3/31/2013,"#81. This review is way overdue.  I came here for happy hour by myself.  Yes, you read that right.  I wanted to de-stress after taking an exam so I decided that I was going to treat myself to BJ's since I hadn't been there in a couple of years.  I really need to get out more often. MY ORDER (HAPPY HOUR) - Mini bruschetta: These were a bit dry-- I felt like I was a parrot eating crackers!  Still decent as an appetizer though.  Even though they look pretty small, one bite is a mouthful ( ). - Spinach-stuffed mushrooms:  I loved this.  You could tell each mushroom was full of flavor.  So juicy!  I'm such a sucker for these things.  They were gone within minutes ( ). - Birthday pizookie: Best thing at BJ's.  Seriously, if you've been here and haven't tried their pizookie, what were you doing?!  A wad of ice cream on top of a warm cookie.  Irresistible goodness.  Good thing I don't eat here often cause I would end up with a pizookie top ( ). I didn't have to wait to be seated, but the wait for the food took forever, even though it was 3 pm on a Wednesday and half the place was empty.  And when you're by yourself, the time passes by twenty times slower than it actually does.  Everything was half off during happy hour, so the bill came out to around $9 including tax and tip.  Sweeeet.  Definitely worth coming here for happy hour!"
Peter M.,"San Jose, CA",144,30,17,1.0,11/13/2015,Worst service ever. They only help you if you look rich because those looser only wants tips. Dumbass. I have never been to a place like this and rated you guys this low. It should be no Fucking Star At all!!!
Winry R.,"San Jose, CA",10,76,7,1.0,7/14/2014,"WORST BJ'S I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!!! i just went last night. I invited 7 of my friends to dinner. we've been FASTING for Ramadan all day.  Here's a list of all of the mistakes they made: 1) forgot to bring a drink out until 30 minutes after ordering 2) didnt take down 1 of the girls orders so she didnt get food at all until the manager finally got involved and bought her dinner to apologize. she got it 45 minutes after everyone else got their food. 3) my fries AND sandwich were ice cold 4) the appetizer came AFTER 3 meals already came. 5) when i asked for new fries, it came 20 minutes later. 6) after everyone finished their meals, we waited 25 minutes until we FINALLY got our checks. 7)he disappeared with out checks for 20 minutes 8) boxes came 20 minutes after we asked or them!! holy crap!! I was so embarrassed to have asked these girls to dinner here. i'm never coming to this location again. i wish the manager offered to buy all of us our meals, cuz everything was horrible.  I left a note on my reciept telling the waitor that i was prepared to give him a big tip since we are a big group, but he ignored us and screwed up so badly and embarrassed me so i left him .67 cents to even my balance. i dont feel bad because he just ruined business for that poor manager because he was lazy and inattentive."
Lauryn H.,"Cotati, CA",0,38,8,5.0,9/6/2016,"Andrea V made this experience better than normal on 7/3/16! She was very kind and worked very hard. The food was great as well, and brought to us quicker thank anticipated. I have definitely had bad experiences at BJs before but this redeemed it!"
Rami C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/27/2016,"Firstly I hardly Yelp but when I receive extremely poor service I definitely want other people to know to save their time and money. Me & my boyfriend went to have dinner here tonight & I can honestly say we had the worst service in the history of customer service. When your waiter is rude & purposely ignoring you even the food and drink start to taste bad. The whole time we were there we just wanted to leave but we were hungry & it was too late to go elsewhere. The server was the most meanest and rudest person I've ever encountered. He was arrogant and completely hated us because it was happy hour and we took up a big table as the lady at check in said we could sit anywhere in the happy hour section and we picked the round table that sits a group, we overheard him and the his server friend saying ""why would they take that table"", so unprofessional. Whenever we would order something he would just give us this horrid stare like he was mad at us not say anything and then walk away he would go check on other tables and skip ours and didn't even offer us water. It was such an awkward atmosphere because he was clearly talking about us to his other shift buddies and they'd all stare at us like it was high school and they were the bullies, he just didn't like us and I can't believe we stayed there and paid $80 for rubbish service. I loved BJs never will I go there again or advise anyone to go there especially this location. Worst experience everrrrrrr! Also the food was so bad, the avocado spring rolls looked like a mess on the plate and the mini pizzas were cold and the ingredients looked old and also tasted old and sour. My boyfriend took one bite and left his pizza. I'm sure the server told the chefs to purposely make our food bad. This was a complete waste of my time and money and I will never celebrate birthdays or have group functions here ever again also will tell everyone I know not to go here and will recommend anywhere else but this place!"
JT R.,"San Jose, CA",128,8,1,4.0,11/13/2015,"Went out for the night (about 3 nights ago) and found a seat in the bar area. We sat for about 7 minutes until someone brought us A menu (yes 1 menu for 2 people), who wasn't our server, then the server who was supposed to be serving us came around. He (heavy set guy with green apron) didn't look at us nor introduced himself and proceeded to ask us ""what do you guys want"". We weren't  ready, so he just left. Another 10ish minutes went by and he was an absentee. This is when things turned around. A totally awesome server named Anna or Hanna saw that we hadn't been helped and came right over. I've been a server myself and she is an exception. Super attentive and made us feel super welcome and special. When I go back I want her and no one else. Good job girl totally turned out experience around."
mong linh n.,"San Jose, CA",176,356,2345,5.0,10/11/2011,"OMG!  they removed my dereks favorite meatloaf off the menu! =(  i came there about a couple weeks ago, and was told that they no longer serve it.  how is that sooo?!   im sad, but there's still plenty of other yummy stuff to order there.  will always be my favorite place to have a bite to eat along with some yummy mixed drinks/my fruity beers. then walk it off at the mall after =D"
Andy H.,"Anaheim, CA",62,296,356,3.0,11/24/2014,"I love BJ'S, this is one of my fave places to dine at. The food is great and who doesn't love a good ol' pizookie.  However, the service wasn't the best today, nor was it the worst. It was mediocre, thus deserving a mediocre rating. I sat in the bar area and was happy to receive our food and drinks pretty quick. However, our waiter forgot about us when a new table was seated near by. He was super nice and friendly whenever he was around, so I can't really knock him. Overall, it was an ok experience."
Lauren F.,"Morgan Hill, CA",86,12,1,1.0,3/20/2017,"Calling to make reservations for this place is an absolute joke, the only people who can make reservations are managers so what's the point of calling to be put on hold or never receive a call back. I called to make a reservation for 10 people for my sisters birthday on march 9th I called about a week and a half out the first time the girl took all my info down and then at the end said they were super busy so they would call me back never did nor did she say only a manager could take my reservation. The next day I called again having not received a call back I was put on hold for 30 minutes so I just hung up called back 15 mins later finally got someone who knew what she was doing told me only managers can make reservations put me on hold and got a manager to help me. I spoke with the GM she was nice gave her my info and told her my frustrations she was really nice and apologized for the inconvenience. I arrived on 3/9 to find out they gave us a table outside had no other option because their booths only fit 7 hmm something they should have told me. Our waitress was amazing she deserves praise and a raise food was sub par but she really made up for my experience well so I thought. Yesterday 3/19 I receive a call from Bjs wanting to know if I am coming in for my reservation they had me down for I said no I already came 10 days ago I'm not sure why you have me down for today the girl apologized and hung up then about an hour later another one calls saying I have a reservation first of all do you guys not communicate because I've already spoken to someone second of all I already went to your establishment 10 days ago but it makes sense why they had me multiple times because these people do not have their stuff together. You would think they would want a party of 10 but I guess not I am so disappointed about the way I was treated. No sincere apology or anything as a manager myself in the hotel industry I strive on customer service and communication which this place is lacking. I will direct my guests not to go to this place as they are not a good choice and lack in service. I reccomend places to eat all the time this will not be one"
L S.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,4,3.0,2/12/2016,"Typically great food, but the quality is inconsistent. I love the quinoa but sometimes it come overdone, too salty or crunchy. Burgers are good, I haven't had any problems with them. The chicken I ordered was awful and soured my stomach. Salmon varies to perfect to overdone."
AJ J.,"San Jose, CA",7,15,,1.0,9/25/2015,"Food is okay. Service is just awful. The workers aren't accommodating at all, the servers are slow, and the mangers aren't helpful. If you say that you accept call a heads, that means your name goes on the list. If you don't, then say you don't accept call a heads. It's that simple. Don't say you do accept call aheads, then start our wait time when we enter the restaurant. It defeats the purpose and is extremely inconvenient."
Joseph P.,"San Jose, CA",0,25,,5.0,4/5/2015,"I love this place!  This place has the best burgers! When I want a big great tasting burger I go here! They have lots of great tasting food, but just can't beat those burgers!  I also love the beer selection, lots of great tasting beers.  Had an issue a couple of times with my girlfriends burger not being cooked well done like she likes it, but both times they went above and beyond to make sure they corrected the issue and that we were satisfied with what they did for us to correct the problem."
Allen C.,"Fremont, CA",107,414,3984,3.0,12/28/2012,"Very good food the first time we came.  Go early to avoid the wait.   Second time was just plain bad.  When u have a dry, freezer burned chicken, you have second thoughts about going back.  The food the first time was above par though so I have mixed feelings.   They really need to get more consistent with the food quality because I still haven't been back and it's been 3 months.  That isn't good for business.  Specially when we tend to do group outings and tend to repeat the better locations."
Damian M.,"Hollister, CA",0,27,2,1.0,7/15/2015,"Worst customer service ever. I've tried this place numerous times and it never fails to disappoint. The servers are horrible and won't check up on you, you'll wait 15+ for anyone to acknowledge that you need a refill. My friends went in for a birthday dinner (there were about 12 of them) and they waited a good 15 minutes for a server to even come up and introduce themselves and ask for drinks. The server told them ""you guys are lucky I took you guys, no one else wanted too"" how friking rude. I will never go back to this place."
Kathy A.,"Saratoga, CA",460,26,6,1.0,6/23/2015,"Worst service ever and the food kinda sucks. Came here once with a group of 7 friends. I barely ordered anything, i got a coke which was around 3$ including tax. I didn't feel the need to tip, knowing i wasn't serviced much at all as opposed to my friends. We were in a rush to leave but i paid with debit. As soon as the waiter brought back my card i ONLY signed the receipt and left the tip and total blank. I check my statement a week later and they charged me $17!! The waiter generously tipped himself $14... I couldnt believe it. After calling the manager and being put on hold and being told that they could do nothing cause i signed it... I gave up. The food is trash, its a low class ghetto place, and the service sucks and is sketchy. DONT GO HERE!!!!"
Paul D.,"San Jose, CA",89,275,,3.0,10/10/2015,Bjs is always packed so plan to wait at least an hour during busy times. Bjs has lots of drinks but my favorite is the root beer that they brew in house. For food I usually order a bake potato or a mini gluten free pizza. My favorite is the gluten free chocolate chip Pizookie.
Bethany H.,"San Jose, CA",11,9,4,1.0,7/9/2016,"Bj's use to be so so good! What else could you possibly want but greasy food and a giant soft cookie with ice cream!?! The past few times we have gone there though the service has been absolutely horrid. Last night was probably the worst. We sat in the bar area since the wait was 30 minutes. It's started out not so terrible but then we ordered drinks and food. First my drink wasn't made correctly and we had to ask him twice to fix it, flagging him down the second time to remind him about the first request. When I ordered our food I requested the two appetizers come out first as soon as possible (a normal expectation) and then a salad for me and chicken for my friend... 30 minutes later... My salad came.... 25 minutes later her chicken came.... No appetizers.. Then we were asked if everything was ok and I said well we never got out appetizers.. To which they said oh let's check on that and it came back out less than 5 minutes later... So... Now her chicken is getting cold while she try's to enjoy some of the appetizers. To top it all off while we were eating I ordered a pazooki to go and a half hour later after paying for our food and terrible service, after being told twice it was almost ready. and then waiting another 15 minutes and asking another server to check on it for me we finally got it and left.. Just to get home and find it burned! Long story short it was a terrible experience and I will not be going back. And I really wish I could get my money back!"
