Ben H L.,"Santa Clara, CA",304,1561,73,4.0,2/18/2013,"This BJ's in Oakridge is always packed.  There's always a wait on weekends when I usually go at anytime during the day, maybe except after 9pm.  But after waiting a bit to get a table, we got our drinks quickly, ordered some food, and got great personable service during our stay.  Our waitress even served us some waters even after we had paid our bill and were chatting afterwards. The only downfall is the parking because usually there isn't any.  Save yourself some time and go straight up into the parking structure and start looking on the second floor in the open air area of the structure and there usually are spots there."
Oumaima H.,"Royal Oaks, CA",1,7,3,1.0,5/31/2015,"I'm so disappointed in BJ's! Usually their food is good, but today was just awful! Except for their appetizers. I came here with my hubby to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but we're very very disappointed. Food was just oily, extremely dry chicken, very salty and veggies were not fresh at all. Last time coming here I guess..."
Tina B.,"Patterson, CA",5000,152,90,4.0,10/31/2012,"CAJUN PASTA is my favorite. There's always a long wait here no matter what day it is. Sometimes they do give everyone slices of pizza while they are waiting for their table. So thoughtful of BJs to do that. The string fries are really good.  AMF here is a real creeper. I had 1 cup and I was like this stuff is so weak I need another one. Not even half way through my 2nd glass, I started feeling really buzz. I ended up giving the rest of my AMF to my friend. After AMF I decided to try pink cadillac. Sweet drink but it taste really light.  Good Service.  Not a good place to take someone out on a first date just because it is so LOUD."
Ch A.,"San Jose, CA",0,85,12,4.0,7/14/2016,"Our family loves BJ's Restaurant.  Great selection of appetizers.  Their stuffed mushrooms are a big hit in our family. Love their burger selection and nothing can beat their Pizzokies! I like the fact that they have an enlightened menu so if you are frightened by the high calorie count of their mains - you have healthier options.  But honestly, if you are going to  BJ's you may as well just enjoy it.  Salads are also good.  Love their Asian Chicken Salad and am also a fan of their Shrimp Tacos. Lines can be long, especially on weeknights and Sundays so be prepared to wait."
Bea N.,"Seattle, WA",3,56,526,1.0,9/14/2015,The people that work here hates their job. It shows it in their face and super crappy service. What made it worse was that the food tastes like reheated old frozen food. I regret paying for garbage.
Vince N.,"Renton, WA",415,781,339,2.0,12/22/2012,Food is mediocre... Service is slow... Crowded and noisy... Just another chain with ok food. The front hostess were very nice though. Make sure you are seated in the main restaurant because sitting outside leaves you with little attention.
Steven H.,"San Jose, CA",114,391,134,4.0,12/3/2015,I like going to BJ's for a good drink and good food. The bar area is usually clean and inviting. Most locations have a above average size bar area so we normally just walk up to any open table or grab a seat at the bar w no wait. I wish the member points added up to more that just $25 after like 10 visits.
Anna S.,"San Jose, CA",6,27,12,2.0,2/2/2016,"We came in as a a family of 7 and was told we would be seated as soon as the table in the front was done. Well they had been done for quite some time but was just sitting there. So another family (of 6) comes in and 5-7 minutes later they get called to sit in a booth. Uhm...? We have been waiting for an hour. So my father in law goes to complain.  We finally get seated 15 minutes later.  So to the food, we had a waiter and he switched off to some other guy. The 1st guy was awesome and sweet.  My sister in law asked for a bloody Mary but with Strawberries not cherries and he said no problem. Then the 2nd guy took our food. It took soooo long to get our food we needed our drinks refilled twice. Now with this guy, when she asked for the Bloody Mary he said ""Uhm?? Ok??"" He came back and said ""Bloody Mary's come with cherries so you can't do that again. We don't have enough strawberries"" HOLD ON SIR. You just told us about fruit salads. They come with strawberries.  So after an hour of being sat the food comes out. My brother & sister in law had burgers. It was cold. My boyfriend got a pizza, the cheese was hard. I had a steak (medium) it was so char and tough. My mother and father in law got a pizza. Half with tomatoes and half without. She is extremely allergic to it & the had to remake the pizza. Also the first one had raw dough. It was ridiculous."
Shar D.,"Milpitas, CA",76,23,57,1.0,11/8/2015,All I have to say is SLOW! Slowest service ever. I've been sitting here for the past hour and have not received my food yet. It's not even busy.
Rita V.,"San Jose, CA",56,731,781,4.0,1/6/2011,"I came here during Happy Hour, which is Sun-Thu from 3-7pm.  They have discount on certain items: $2 off sharable appetizers $2 off sliders $1 off beer Half off mini pizza!! I decided to go with a mini pizza, which is half off during happy hour.  I ordered a Southwestern pizza, and it came out in 15 minutes.  For around $5, it was a great deal! The pizza was good but super greasy.  The crust was really greasy on the bottom.  I still enjoyed the chicago style pizza.  The chicken was a little bit spicy, but not too spicy for me."
Eric J.,"Fremont, CA",95,446,475,4.0,5/26/2013,"I've been to several of these, here in Kali and in other states. The menu has something for everyone! I've had several of their hamburgers, salads, and pastas. All have been great!  The service has always been great at each & every location that I've been to. The beer selection is awesome. A great place for good food, awesome beer, and sharing time with friends!"
Soph K.,"Wallkill, NY",0,8,8,5.0,1/29/2016,"Usually these big chains feel a little impersonal to me... Last Monday though, we were made to feel right at home by our server Brittany, who took the time to explain the beers and brought out complementary samples for my out-of-town friend. She even made me feel like a winner for being the designated driver with my drink orders! From helpful tips on the menu to turning our friend's day around with a sweet treat in the end... the server made us actually want to return for more hang-outs at the local BJs! We had appetizers, soup and dessert, so I can't say much about the food dishes till next time!"
Joe B.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/15/2015,"We just used Grub Hub for delivery  tonight, both pizzas  were not worth the cardboard they were delivered  in. Don't waste your time,  totally  inedible  food went right into  the garbage  can."
Denish G.,"Barcelona, Spain",101,261,160,1.0,8/1/2014,"! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! Bad service, disgusting drinks they will make anything else before asking for your approval. Example I ordered mojito they bring disgusting cocktail I drank it, I order Stella artois they bring blue moon I drank it, my friend order 4 classic margaritas well we got only the cup for margarita because drinks are nothing like Genuine.. so rude waitress didn't care we do this drinks our Bjs way sorry she said... For more than $245 fuc.  Not recommended at all food also very small portion and not well cooked grrrr."
Behzod T.,"San Jose, CA",32,29,6,2.0,11/15/2014,"This review is based on the service. Sort of. I think they get at least 2 stars because the food is okay. I mean it's a BJs restaurant  it should be good right?  The service flat out sucks..nothing but unsatisfactory rude customer service, straight face, throwing/dumping plates, condiments, etc.. on the table. Also got wrong order of food sent to us. Some dishes were a little cold...Ehhh this location is just hit or miss."
OB C.,"San Jose, CA",9,36,14,1.0,6/14/2016,"Terrible experience, the worst place I visited in recent years. Waited 40min to be seated and then sat 10+ min with no server at all. Then another 30 min for the appetizer, another 30+ min for the entree. Our server never show up during this whole time except bringing us food. Questioned another waiter where our server was and what was going on with our food, she came back and arguing we did not place our order until 13 min ago which was untrue. We asked our waiter for explanation, and he is not apologetic at all, instead he asked us to talk to his manager. I had never seen a BJ like this place, they really don't care how you feel and they don't give it a damn shit. After all these, our food tasted awful. Even though the manager gave us a price break, we still feel terrible about this place and decided never visit again. BTW, we were celebrating our daughter's 16th birthday, isn't it a bad choice to choose bj? Note: the GM reached out to me after seeing my review, however there is no sincerity at all. It makes me feel even worse about bj."
Alyssa S.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/5/2015,"On the night of Monday (7/27/15) My boyfriend and I just got a new puppy, we are trying to socialize her so she can be my boyfriend mikes therapy dog while going through cancer treatment. So I said lets go to Bj's and sit on the patio at oakridge mall. He walked in and told the host ""we have our puppy with us can we sit on the patio?"" The host said no problem it will be just about 5 minutes, so we waited and were eventually sat. We were on the patio while our puppy quietly sat there (everyone on the patio was Petting her and asking what kind of dog we had) we sat there for 20 minutes without a server, until finally I see a woman staring at us. I smiled and she walked over (BJ's manager).  She said : ""I think my employee misunderstood we are not allowed to have dogs on the patio unless they are guide dogs, but since you already ordered and everything I won't ask you to leave."" My response: "" well actually we have been patiently waiting here for 20 minutes, but haven't been helped yet.""  Manager: ""oh now I don't want you to leave. Let me run inside to get a server or paper to take your order."" That's when we decided to leave and three other guests who weren't helped on the patio either said they didn't like how we were kicked out, so they were leaving too.  There was no apology and she didn't sound genuine... It happened to be 100 degrees that day and we still didn't even have water, I know a manager should probably look at that before she kicks someone off her patio. My boyfriend and I have worked at restaurants for so many years and that's how we know we weren't treated kindly. She didn't say anything kind to us. The dog actually is my boyfriends therapy dog but she didn't care to ask. On top of that all California restaurants with a patio have to allow dogs.  We walked to California pizza kitchen and they welcomed us on their patio, the manager came right over and pet our dog."
Kambiz B.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/11/2016,"It is a nice and clean place and the food is very good. But, I think the desserts were a bit overrated."
Delia G.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/21/2016,This place sucks ass I went there for my birthday once and it was OK the food was good and the people were nice (2 years ago)I came the second time with my friend I haven't seen in a while.  we were seated and are waiter took for ever to get are drink order then we ordered our food everything seemed fine but then our food came which took a while  ( the lady's on the side got there before us n we got our food way before them) some guy just dropped off our food not our waiter so he just booked it and didn't ask if we needed anything . So my food was getting cold so I asked a lady for a soda refill and ketchup that lady gave me a dirty look and left for a while then came gave the tray to some other lady and came back with Dr Pepper instead of Pepsi  and a ketchup bottle wet with something inside the cap nasty . After all that our waiter decides to show up and he asks if we need anything what a but hole so my friend orders a dessert.Then we left never going back! The waiter service is going downhill
Sandy T.,"San Jose, CA",0,22,,4.0,2/7/2016,"Love their Chinese chicken salad, the nachos and of course the pazooki! Fun place to watch a sports game!"
