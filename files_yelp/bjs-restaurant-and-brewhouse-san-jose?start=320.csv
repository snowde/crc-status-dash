Therese W.,"San Jose, CA",11,41,,5.0,12/19/2015,"This location recently remodeled, and they now post their ""guest tap"" beer on the wall. In spite of that nice selection, we stuck to their porter, stout, and amber. Also had potato skins - plenty of cheese and bacon, nice and crispy potatoes, loved both sauces. We sat at the bar - our bartender was Ryan. Nice guy. Kept a good pace with us. Very helpful. Would be glad to have him again. We stopped there around 1PM on a Friday - place was busy, but not overly so. I have been there for dinner, so no idea if you will have our experience later in the day, but we always have good service at lunch."
Mercedes C.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/16/2016,I went for dinner yesterday with some friends we were sitting at bar. Food was good and customer service was great! But towards closing time you could hear a woman's voice yelling at the employees I'm assuming she was the manager. One of my friends said she was yelling about them making over time. I understand is her job to keep track of the hours worked but she should've Waited till there was no more customers and there are also other ways of dealing with the situation. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment
David H.,"San Francisco, CA",54,514,258,3.0,3/10/2013,"Great beer, my favorite red beer is found here. Noisy, party, after work atmosphere. Food is fairly mediocre for a chain. Some hits like calamari, flat bread is skimpish in ingredients but great for carb lovers Dont much care for their salads when compared to other chain restaurant counterparts (ie. Cheesecake Factory)"
Boaty M.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/8/2016,"Been to BJ's many times and it is always consistent in quality. Tonight my daughter and I had dinner and were served by a fabulous new member to the wait staff, Dana. Food was good as usual, but Dana made it an exceptional experience. Attentive without hovering. Very friendly and engaging. She's a keeper!"
Jath S.,"San Jose, CA",72,83,6,2.0,7/30/2016,Food is the standard set of dishes. Always enjoyed the wide variety of options they serve but their service is just terribly slow. Even if you ask for something fast it never really works out.
Kathleen O.,"San Jose, CA",7,14,,1.0,6/25/2016,"What happened to the service at Oakridge BJ's?  We been eating there since it first opened and always had great service.  Tonight the waiters were too busy by the bar having their own party. The service was awful!!  Honestly, I don't know if I'll be back., ever!  Example:  wrong beer delivered, no one checked if the order was accurate, and we waited and waited for the bill. I would have ordered desert, but could not get the waiter's attention. Where is the manager getting his crew working as they used to work???  Too bad."
Melanie N.,"Downtown, San Jose, CA",7,109,36,1.0,11/4/2015,"I've been here so many times and it's always a hit and miss. Tonight was the worst of the worst.  Slow service and awfully bad foods from appetizers to entrées. We waited for 30 plus minutes for the foods. Very disappointed and what really sucks is that we often come to BJ'S for bday's celebration. We even made a complaint to our waiter. He was very apologetic about it and said he would talk to the manager.  After waiting for a good 5 mins, he came out and said next time if we come back, he will treat us some appetizer on him. Good gestures from the waiter but apparently the manager didn't care about our concerns."
H S.,"San Jose, CA",24,23,2,5.0,7/3/2014,"Went to BJ's for the first time this week for lunch with a friend. Got there at about 11:45 and were seated right away. Our server, Izzy (sp?) was excellent...attentive at all the right times (even when it started getting busy) but not hovering. Nice to find out that Tuesday is 1/2 price wine day. Where else can you get a glass of Kendall for $4? We split an order of the corn fritters (excellent). I ordered the California burger and a side Caesar salad. Burger was great, salad was good, as expected. My friend had the potato and a side salad, both also good. Like I said, first time here, and I'd definitely come back."
Francis N.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,29,4.0,1/2/2015,"Some of my calamari was rubbery and chewy.The pizza was so greasy. The traditional wings are okay. The place wasn't as crowded as it is dinner time. I'd say my server did an ok job, at least he checked on us from time to time."
Boomer R.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,3.0,12/28/2014,"I love the food and the servers for the most part pretty generous. AND you can't go wrong with the occasional pizookie.  My main complaint would be the wait time. Typically takes awhile to be seated, and on top that the service is ridiculously slow even for a BJ's. Just make sure to call ahead to make a reservation for planned occasion.  It's pretty understandable due to it's location  (being attached to a mall), but if you have time, go for it!"
Dev M.,"San Jose, CA",180,13,18,1.0,9/16/2015,Why did I have to ask the front desk twice who my server was and who the hell is the front of the house manager?! Our server passed us by 5 times before I had to ask twice who our server ways? Know your tables and who you haven't served yet...
Shannon C.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,13,2,5.0,10/26/2015,"Came here for some pizza during a short stay in San Jose for a hockey tournament. We received excellent service from our server, and it kills me I don't remember her name! She was fantastic. Patient, prompt, friendly, and accommodating. Every single one of the people in our party appreciated her (there was 8 of us). The food was delicious, I'm usually never disappointed by the food at BJS. Thanks for a great experience!"
Shannon N.,"San Jose, CA",65,800,167,2.0,7/24/2014,"Meh.  If it wasn't for the pizookie, there would be no need to ever return here.  The nail in the coffin for me was when I ordered takeout, and they had no plastic cutlery.  Gee, thanks, no need for a fork for my salad or entree.  Ugh."
Evelyn R.,"San Jose, CA",84,8,,1.0,7/9/2015,"I've never had any bad experience here until last week. The food here is great and so was the customer service until last week. I had probably the most horrible waiter ever! Miss Gaby was so rude, while she was taking our order she leaned on our table and rolled her eyes. Who does that! She never came once to see how we were doing because she was too busy with an other table flirty with the guys. And when we told her it was our friend's birthday what she to say is ""That's cool!"" We gave her the longest stare of our lives until she finally said ""We do give out pizookies, if you want one."" Yea no shit why else would we tell you."
Jeffrey C.,"San Jose, CA",84,79,21,3.0,5/25/2014,"I'll be real, I come to BJs for the beer. The food tastes better after you've had a few. It was nice to see how much they've expanded the beer menu. Laguntias on tap, Belgian beer by the bottle and specialty house made brews.  Came here for Saturday dinner with my dad, had the chicken sandwich which was just what I expected. My dad's ribs were pretty overdone but like I said, I wasn't expecting to be blown away to begin with."
Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",301,1475,174,4.0,8/4/2012,"After an excellent 5 star experience at BJ's in San Bruno I tried the San Jose location after a San Jose Giants minor league game. (The SJ Giants are the future SF Giants.) Anyhow, we had an excellent meal and the slider appetizers were great. This is quite the place at 11PM as most places in San Jose shut their kitchens, really dumb! I'm glad BJ's is open after the ballgames as the hungry future SF Giants pour in to get their protein injections! Great service!"
Jim A.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,91,,4.0,6/14/2016,we went for a lunch in the weekend. it was nice to be there we ordered avocado egg rolls and flat bread garlic pesto pizza. Yummy. it was good. Also margarita pizza we had. Mojito. Good service. Decent food at reasonable price parking is a problem there. but we reached there around noon. so it was not too bad.  overall nice play to hang around
Vanny L.,"San Jose, CA",31,39,2,2.0,9/3/2014,"Seated 2A, 2K right away- however, happy hour appetizers (pizza, avocado rolls and chicken wings) were all cold and took too long- they also ran out of apple juice for the kids which was disappointing but everything tasted mediocre and out of frozen boxes. We were starving and by the time our entrees came, we scarfed everything down. Mahi mahi was actually hot and good- however the pineapple fried rice tasted like it was  like from a frozen dish and veggies are not fresh. Service was slooowww and the 1 waiter did the best she could, she did forget a lot of things and had to come back to ask us to repeat orders... ugh... I wouldn't go back, its too pricey and not worth it..atleast California Pizza Kitchen would be my first choice."
James N.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/10/2015,Terrible service. Have given this place many chances but every time the server is in a dull mood. Rude. That kills it for me. Food is average.
Rickie B.,"San Jose, CA",157,52,8,1.0,1/23/2016,"Called tonight to confirm an upcoming reservation. First call they had me on hold for 8minutes and 36seconds, then they hung up. Called back , obviously irritated, hostess could give a crap, then they had me on hold for 11 minutes before they hung up on me again. I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM MY BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE...."
