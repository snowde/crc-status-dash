Denise N.,"Santa Ana, CA",376,170,90,1.0,3/8/2014,"I came here with a group of 10 on a Friday night for a friend's birthday and since we had such a big group, we called in ahead to reserve a table at 7PM. I get there at 7PM, and apparently our table was never reserved even though when I called in, the person on the phone took my name down - spoke to the manager and apparently he couldn't do anything?! Wtf. My group and I should've left but we decided to wait 45 minutes for a table and didn't even get seated until 8:45 PM.  We basically waited 1 hour and 45 minutes but its ok, we were seated now so it couldn't get worse than the wait time right? NO.  Our service was terrible. We ordered a pitcher of beer with took forever to come out, on top of that, I asked for hot sauce on the side for the 2 pizzas our group ordered and the server took so long that I told him nevermind. He came out 5 minutes later with hot sauce - I appreciated the effort but by the time he brought it out, all the pizza was already gone. On top of our reservation being messed up and the terrible service, we didn't get ANY water refills, the bill took a long time to come out AND we got charged for an extra item (it was fixed of course) -_- I might give this BJs a chance in the future but the horrible wait and terrible service aren't worth 2 pizzas"
Jan R.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,,3.0,7/12/2016,"Food is ok. I ordered the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne. It was awful. Pasta was not cooked well and the sauce was bland. Tasted as if it came from a jar. Avocado egg roll appetizers were great as well as my sangria and the rest of our drinks. I think it's a good place to go for drinks, not so much for the food."
Robert R.,"San Jose, CA",51,9,,5.0,10/27/2015,"I love this place. I come here very often with my brother and usually sit at the bar. The food is great, the beer is great, overall great atmosphere. This past weekend I took my parents out to dinner and it was their first visit. I was very impressed by our waiter. Unfortunately I do not remember his name, but he was very professional and made great recommendations to my folks. At the end, everyone had a great experience. Thank you to everyone at the BJ's Staff."
Lyn R.,"Milpitas, CA",20,59,141,5.0,9/5/2014,9/4/14 Game Night! Was busy but our server James was great and always there to check up on us! He deserved that $Tip! For sure! Great service and food was amazing! My bf and I often comes here since we live nearby. I love those huge flat screen TVs. Very chill place!
Frank L.,"Campbell, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/21/2016,"15 minute wait for drinks then 30 minute wait for our appetizer, which was laughable. Boneless chicken wings with a lemon pepper dry rub was merely Tyson chicken nuggets sparingly topped with Mrs.Dash seasoning. I would usually say something but I just wanted to catch our movie starting next door. Safe to say we will not be visiting BJ'S anytime soon until they raise their standards on food, or describe their menu items as they really are."
Joe C.,"San Jose, CA",1,49,1,5.0,6/19/2016,"Wonderful waiter, did not have to ask him twice for anything. One of the better waiters we have had in a long time.  It is nice to go out to dinner and get what you ordered, have a pleasant waiter and not have to ask for refills twenty times.  Our meals were also great and plenty to pick from."
Jennifer F.,"San Jose, CA",24,24,149,4.0,8/31/2014,Had to kill some time at the mall so we decided to have a quick lunch at BJ's have a great lunch menu and I opted for the mini starter salad and the mini bruschetta both under four dollars my daughter had clam chowder and a baked potato service was excellent we sat outside on the patio and it was great
Joe P.,"Sparks, NV",0,6,,5.0,6/19/2016,"Service was great. Ate at a booth with my kids on Father's Day and was expecting chaos, but ended up going the opposite way. Clean calm atmosphere met with friendly service. I need to mention this most importantly, I have been working as a server/bartender for over 14 years and never experienced a person like Saul. Saul ran out our appetizers and made completely sure we were taken care of. He was kind and very attentive. Top Notch Saul, thank you very much."
Teresa C.,"San Jose, CA",15,6,10,4.0,12/24/2014,"This place is delicious! I ordered the strawberry splash marguerita and it was perfect company with the five appetizers I had (avocado egg rolls, calamari, nachos, fries and corn fritters). There was a mix up in ordering but the servers were pretty good about it. Then of course, ended the night with pizookies! Wish the waiter was just a little more personable but definitely enjoyed the night!"
Jose M.,"San Jose, CA",239,8,,4.0,7/2/2016,"I love the beer here! Great place and Bar Area. I always come here with my daughter and the service here is so friendly. The server ""Gaby N"" is super friendly and helpful. She always checks up on my table and makes sure we are happy and doing well. She has great people skills and knows a lot about the food and drinks. Overall she is awesome and makes me want to come back here more often, even if its just for a beer."
James P.,"San Jose, CA",153,25,57,3.0,2/6/2014,"To be honest, I don't come here for dinner too often. When I do come to BJ's, it's generally during week nights or happy hour. This is a great place to catch up with a friend to grab some great nibbles and a cold beer. Thumbs up for... - Their accommodation of large parties - a great place to host a company dinner party, going away dinners, family celebrations, etc... - Deep dish pizzas (my favorite: BJ's favorite). The crust is thick and soft with a perfect crunch. Good selections available. - 1/2 off Wine on Tuesdays. - Good variety of items priced at $4, $5 and $6 during Happy Hour. - Great bar seating with booths, high table tops and a very long bar facing their huge tv screen. Sounds great! But... - Their Happy Hour items are EXTREMELY small. My friend had to order two Margarita flatbreads ($4 per flatbread) to satisfy his ""snack hunger"" - This is not a great place to come to hang out on weekend nights. Their bar tables and bar are usually packed and there is really no where to stand and wait. - Service is a hit or miss. I would still choose Yardhouse over BJ's for their happy hour as they serve full sized appetizers with a wider selection of beers. Don't' get me wrong, I still like this place but it generally ends up being a back-up spot if something falls through in planning."
Sammy C.,"East San Jose, San Jose, CA",0,10,1,4.0,11/5/2015,Love the service tonight!! Our waitress was awesome. It's faster now and our waitress paid attention with refilling with my water
Diana M.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,1,5.0,6/27/2016,"This is always the best BJs restaurant around San Jose. And Biaggio was an excellent waiter. Great service with a smile and generous spirit. Thanks, Biaggio!"
Katy S.,"San Jose, CA",127,5,,1.0,12/23/2016,"Very disappointed with this restaurant and your service there. We had a going away party that we were planing to have there and I had called earlier to make a reservation and was told to do it online which I did. We should up at 4:45pm and you host told us no problem let us move tables, then your manager came over and told us ""sorry they could not seat us, that they were full and had party's"". The restaurant was hardly busy at 4:45pm and both outside areas were empty also. I asked her if she was kidding she said no and pretty much walked away. I went next door to Bucca Di Beppo's and they were more then happy to take care of our party even with them having large Christmas parties going on. They sat us in 10 minutes. After we were done at Bucca's we walked back by BJ'S and your restaurant was still not very busy nor were the outside areas being used. We have always enjoyed eating at BJ'S but if this is how your management does things then we will not be returning."
Helennn H.,"San Jose, CA",112,74,1,2.0,1/18/2014,Don't go when you have a large group and during holiday and/or sports season. They will most likely mess up your orders and make you wait an eternity for the food. 2 stars is for BJ's only redemption: the pizookie.
Mark R.,"San Jose, CA",33,120,357,3.0,11/20/2012,"I've been here a couple times now and here's a few things I can take out of my visits. The line and wait can be ridiculously long because it's attached to the Oakridge mall so that's a given. The bar is a cool place to get a drink and watch sports with a homie or two during happy hour. The food is pretty good too especially there pizza but you should come with a group and order the bigger sizes or come during HAPPY HOUR and they are half off!   THE BEST thing about this place is the Pizookie! It's like heaven in your mouth and should ALWAYS order it after eating because it's just that good, it's comparable to the Chili's Molten Cake but I still lean towards the Molten. If i could, i would come here and just order the large pizookie and just eat it alone. LOL!"
Patti L.,"San Jose, CA",564,135,181,4.0,5/31/2013,I love buffalo chicken pizza and pizookies. They have an oreo pizookie thats super yummy! They also have seasonal beers. Seating: theres a wait during the evening and especially during the weekends.
Richard C.,"Saratoga, CA",300,137,13,3.0,4/26/2014,"Sometimes you're grateful for the transparency that is provided by the nutritional facts on a menu and sometimes you're horrified by them. Kudos to BJ's for putting the caloric values next to each entree on the menu but now my life has been shattered realizing how, when you combine meat, cheese, batter, and deep frying, you get an entire day's worth of calories! I've been to BJs about 5 times and each time the food that I ordered was pretty good. Most recently I've had the roast beef french dip but opted to not have the cheese to save a few calories.  It was pretty good.  I'd say it's a 7 in an array of french dips that range from cheap, dried, and tasteless with canned gravy as ""au jus"" (your average pub or chain restaurant)  to tender and succulent (Los Altos Grill - which I routinely use as my high-end benchmark).  The meat was good, the bread not too doughy or overpowering and and jus was good (not too salty or fatty).   I don't get the beers at BJs (I'm sure they're good to most people) because after I had their sampler I pretty much verified that I only like light wheats or black stouts.  In between there are too many funky flavors between ambers, pale ales (most IPAs are too hoppy which too me tastes like boiled socks in dishwater), and reds. BJs is a good, consistent, brewhouse with good food and a lot of selection and great waitstaff (both the Cupertino and Oakridge locations have great servers!). Will go back!"
Diana L.,"Saratoga, CA",34,2,,5.0,6/18/2016,"Lovin' BJs, Friday during lunch, my grandchildren and I went to BJ Restaurant for a long awaited treat. Soup and ribs wew coming our way. Soup, one would say. My grandson wanted to try the much heard about soup. My grandchildren loved the BJs tortilla soup. Not sure I have the name right. 11yr old boy ordered it 1st. Then 12 year old girl ordered her own. Smackin' their lips. Best soup! We were there for a long time, never felt we needed to move along and give the table to someone else, being lunch and all. My grandson was watching soccer some big tournament. Service was spot on, attentive without pushing. Soup, ribs, salmon, and fries yum. Smilies all around. No room for the Pizookie though. Maybe next time."
Susana N.,"San Jose, CA",181,16,18,4.0,2/1/2014,"We transferred from the bar to the dine-in area. I can see how waiters can get irritated of that bc the split-tip system gets all jacked up, but they perfectly kept their composure. The new ahi salad and their new red velvet pazooki was bomb bomb bomb!  My friend was also crazy drunk, and our servers were just patiently awesome. 4 stars only bc I've had better and could've been faster. We had to repeat our orders 3 times."
