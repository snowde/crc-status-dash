Kathy W.,"Anaheim, CA",363,175,240,4.0,6/7/2015,"Good food, decent to good service. It can get loud but I expect that! I tend to order some of the small bites which are yummy. We had the shrimp wraps which where good, the poke salad which was fresh and the caprese salad."
Paul S.,"San Jose, CA",2,11,17,5.0,5/31/2016,"Big shout out and thanks to Frankie for the great service he's given us this past year in both the restaurant and bar. He always remembered us and what we liked to eat and drink. Sad he is leaving but wishing him all the best in his next adventure in So Cal. Next time we're in Brea CA, we'll be sure to visit BJs and see Frankie! Good food, good wine, great conversations, Thanks and Cheers."
Alesia D.,"North Valley, San Jose, CA",0,4,2,5.0,5/31/2016,"Tonight, a friend and I ordered 2 appetizers (the flat bread and ahi poke). Not only was the food delicious, but the service was amazing! Sean Wright helped us out tonight and was extremely helpful when we ordered. Not only was he quick, but he also asked us how our meal was and catered to us!"
Michael S.,"San Jose, CA",255,70,32,2.0,2/7/2014,"Not your average BJ's (hardy har har) and not in a good way. Now, I'm sure you've all been to a BJ's just as you've all been to a Chili's (or three other huge chain burger joints I can't think of right now), and you know that it's a slight cut above that genre of restaurants. The appetizers are more impressive than their entrees and, for a chain that serves chips and salsa, I really do like their chips and salsa the best. I'd say an average BJ's is 4-star worthy and that's taking into account menu diversity, quality of their food, atmosphere and overall satisfaction. However, this location is one of my least favorites due to their wait staff. The staff is always miserable (besides Justine). From simply their attentiveness for each table to their overall (un)cheerfulness, it's really bothersome to feel so.. Well... Bothersome to a waiter/waitress when you'd just like to enjoy a meal out. There are long times in between ""oh were just looking at the menu, big menu, haha"" to ""ok, I think we'd like to order an appetizer and a few drinks"" to ""ok were ready to order."" By the time you're ready for that final stage, your body has literally digested your appetizer and you're only ordering again because your nutritionist told you that eating every 3 hours is good for your metabolism. Like I said, we've all had BJ's (hardy har har) but unless you're absolutely craving this particular one for some weird nostalgic ""the place where we first met"" type of deal, I'd strongly recommend another location or even another restaurant."
Wesley B.,"San Jose, CA",3,67,,1.0,7/1/2015,"Epic fail.  Host has no idea how to estimate wait times.  Told 20 minutes and wait actually was at least 40....we can see no less than 8 open tables.  Place is being managed by kids who don't know what they're doing and ignorant of the definition of ""serving customers "". No idea why this place is busy"
Debie O.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,,2.0,4/30/2015,"This has the worst customer service I have encountered in quite some time.. We were consistently ignored, no welcome, no eye contact and when we complained we never saw the supervisor again, she adjusted our bill but never came back.."
Michael P.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/27/2016,Very typical San Jose BJ's.  Lots of open seating (basically 1/2) and they under staff the servers so you have to wait 30 min.   It's 5:00 not 3:00.  Management needs to understand their customers better not what they think is better.
ROBERT R.,"Gilroy, CA",1,8,,5.0,10/8/2014,"""AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THE STAFF TO THE MANAGER RODNEY!"" the staff and the manager Rodney are awesomenesss you might wait a long time to eat but its well worth the wait. Manager Rodney is needed in more restaurants to lead staff like he does so well at the San Jose Oakridge Mall location. My favorites are the Caprese Salad and there mashed potatoes are dam good with there white gravy."
Lauri D.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",193,17,9,2.0,7/6/2014,"I give this BJ's 2 stars because it has a diverse menu with a lot of gluten free options. I subtract 3 stars because the service is always slow. Staff is friendly but clearly overworked. Tonight we ordered curbside pickup. We were quoted a 5 minute drop off but no one came for over 15 minutes. We ended up walking inside to pick it up ourselves and waited in another line. Staff was apologetic and stated ""oh we had not gotten to you yet."" Clearly they were busy but at least do your customers the courtesy of calling and letting them know that their estimated delivery has been delayed due to business demands. Summary: good food & menu, friendly staff, SLOW service"
Tyson S.,"San Jose, CA",4,3,,5.0,9/28/2014,"My family and I went here for lunch the other day. I had not been to a BJ's before and figured it to be a bar food type establishment. That was not the case. It is a pleasant place situated in the mall and though it seemed to be pretty busy inside we sat on the patio which had plenty of elbow room. Our server Rayna did an excellent job making sure we did not feel neglected. We told her it was our first time at a BJ's and she just lit up with excitement. Clearly she loves working for that restaurant so we asked for recommendations. I have to say, she was not wrong about one of them, especially the beer! The service was perfect and meals reasonably priced."
Julie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,75,11,4.0,5/20/2016,BJs never disappoints. They were crazy busy do the wait was pretty long. I ordered take out but the staff were pleasant. They even suggested I add to the app to earn rewards and offers.
Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",960,131,7,3.0,5/19/2014,"Probably my favorite restaurant at Oakridge mall. Lots of variety! We ordered the flatbread pizza appetizers. Pepperoni was nothing to rave about. The California Club pizza had all my favorite ingredients (bacon..avocado..etc.) so that would have to be my favorite one. Portions were okay. I think they would be a steal at happy hour (half off I believe) but for $8, I had hoped for more. My shrimp scampi ($18) was not as flavorful as I'd hoped, although it was great the second time I had it for leftovers! There's not much sauce on it and I'm not exactly a fan of angel hair. My friend got the Lemon Thyme Chicken. That was decent as well. Any time I come here, I only look forward to one thing: The pizookies! It makes me forget about their average dinner selection and since it's always the last thing to hit my mouth at BJ's, I always leave feeling like I had an extremely positive experience. Got the pizookie party platter, which is essentially a GINORMOUS pizookie with up to 4 flavors, stacked with a bunch of scoops of ice cream. By far the best flavor is the white chocolate macadamia! The triple chocolate was too chocolatey ... but I guess we should have known that."
Marcos B.,"Martinez, CA",0,60,,2.0,7/15/2014,"First time at BJ's depsite being surrounded by them. Food was good, service was not. My girlfriend and I were coming from Santa Cruz after a day off and she wanted BJ's, and this one turned out to be the closest one to us. It took us about 25 minutes to be seated, not too bad, but afterwards it took us 15 minutes to just get a water. We got some Asian waiter towards the back and seemed as moody as we were, and on top of that we could barely hear him talk. He wasn't much of a talker, to us, anyway. Bastard didn't get a tip, so eh, who cares. The food was quite good, though. When we left we saw one of the other waiters treating her table with care, squatting down to talk with one of her younger guests and interacting, etc. Like all the other BJ's out there, it gets packed at night. Make sure you're prepared to wait. And, also endure the pain your stomach may feel if you get a crappy waiter. Other than that, food is pretty good for a decent price."
Brenda L.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,1,5.0,5/14/2016,"It's been a great while since I've gotten a very friendly server here, hopefully next time I come back I get the same server Sean with the green eyes!!! Every time we asked for anything he would get it right away with no hesitation--and we asked for a lot of things. He would always come to check on us regularly and I appreciate that. Overall, a great experience and I can't wait to come back!!"
Sabelle D.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/31/2016,"Wow ! I was absolutely blown away at the service I received yesterday at this BJs location. I'm usually not a big BJs fan, however our server yesterday made the entire experience. My friends and I went to BJs to watch the game, and our server Frankie went up and beyond for our table. He was prompt with our orders and  food, as well as extremely personable. One of my best server experiences."
Sue B.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,5.0,5/31/2016,"We had a great time at BJ's watching the Warriors win last night. Frankie was our server - kudos to him for making us feel welcome to hang out for the evening. Somehow he was always here when we needed him so we could enjoy the food (especially recommend the Santa Fe salad), the drinks and the game without feeling rushed."
Timothy H.,"San Jose, CA",143,1,,1.0,5/30/2016,Worst restaurant service. Had plenty of tables open and the servers just stood there. Came her to have a few beers to honor a fellow veterans and was stuck waiting for 3 hours.
Johnson N.,"San Jose, CA",517,352,112,3.0,3/16/2014,"The place is alright. Same old service, quality of food and atmosphere. Usually come here to chill nothing more. Selection of food is a lot, potato skins for lunch or dinner is better than then during nightly hours.  Beer needs more pitcher selections."
Kimberly A.,"San Antonio, TX",42,333,311,2.0,10/1/2013,"My boyfriend and I occasionally come here when in the mood for American food, & when we need to eat late & are trying to avoid food out of a window. I love how BJ's is open until at least midnight. However, when you are tired and hungry and it is late, the last thing you want is BAD SERVICE!  Seriously, 85% of the time we come here, it is a much longer, more stressful meal than necessary because service is rude, slow, forgetful, incorrect, etc. I have been brought the wrong food, charged the wrong amount on the bill, my food has been forgotten, my drinks have been forgotten, us as a table were forgotten... I have even had to get up & go in search of a manager to get our bill to pay, & express our disappointment at the experience.  Why do we still return? Well, we haven't come in a long time. We just don't have the patience & our repeated poor service experiences have really dampened their company reputation with us.  I think the prices are high for what you get for most items. I have a couple usuals. I always get the small plate tomato & mozzarella salad, with is caprese-style, & has a delicious balsamic reduction along with fresh onions for crunch. I also get the vegetable stuffed potato, which is simple but hearty. Other than that I have been disappointed by the quality and ingredients of their salads, and did not find their pizza tasty. We come if I want a potato, but otherwise, they really need to work on introducing some healthy, vegetarian options! And of course, the customer service! One thing I do like, is that you can call ahead to put your name in. However, there is most always a long wait, even late at night."
Michelle S.,"Fairbanks, AK",30,628,25,3.0,4/8/2014,Basic chain restaurant.  We chose BJ's at the Oakdale Mall for lunch.  I found myself sticking my finger in a big glob of BBQ sauce on the menu when I was looking through it.  Grossed me out a bit.  I was able to clean my finger off with the drink napkin and then use some hand sterilizer to clean up.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla.  It was good with salsa and sour cream on the side.  My mom got the flatbread pizza with salad.  She said the salad was good.  I thought the pizza was like school lunch pizza which isn't bad but not something I'd go out of my way for.  Prices were pretty cheap for lunch and the portions.
