Owie N.,"San Francisco, CA",622,1348,4663,3.0,10/27/2011,"Out of all location for BJ's, this one has got to be the worst location for me. Finding parking around Oakridge drive me crazy and when you finally get to the restaurant, it is definitely a wait. At least they give out free sample of pizza while you wait so that makes me a little bit happy and not moody. I love their pizza and pizookies! They also have good happy hour!"
H G.,"San Jose, CA",2,221,18,4.0,2/14/2014,"Came early on a Friday evening with the fam - we were seated right away and our waitress quickly came to get our drink order (maybe it was the look on my face after a loooong week at work or she is just an awesome waitress!!) . My cocktail came quickly, my hubs had to wait a bit for his beer - little backwayrds, but I was happy :) We ordered and the had a chance to chat before the food came out Kids were super happy with their food - mini corn dogs which was a HUGE portion so we took half home for lunch the next day I had sliders, which were YUMMY and hubs had jambalaya which he loved! Was a great time and the key was to come early because when we left it was packed!!!"
Deep S.,"San Jose, CA",508,384,3422,4.0,11/14/2011,"Tried the Chicken Marsala Pasta last night, tasted really good with a real nice flavorful kick to it.  I also mixed it up a bit with BJ's Pizza tried the Great White Specialty comes with Chicken, Alfredo Sauce, Mushrooms, more of an Cream Italian taste to it... I did an half/half of the great white and BJ's favorite didn't know u could mix and match like dad, they let you do it on the smalll-large but not on personal, but that's understandable :)"
Steve K.,"San Jose, CA",95,23,,2.0,11/12/2014,"Very interesting experience at BJ's last night.  We got there after battling the Oakridge parking lot and got seated right away, around 6pm.  It was more crowded than usual on a Tuesday night because of Veterans day and many people and kids had off.   We ordered potato skins first and they came out in a timely manner.  Besides bacon being on only 2 of the 10 skins and one being turned upside down and mushy (attention to details Mr BJ Chef), they were good.  We got some more bacon to add, which helped.  Lo and behold, less than 2 minutes after receiving our skins, out come the main entrees!  To me, this is unacceptable!  They are called appetizers for a reason and they should be enjoyed, not rushed down my gullet!  They took back the entree's and most likely put them under the heat lamp while we finished our apps (about 10 minutes).  The waitress (who did a great job) apologized and said that they didn't expect such a big crowd and cooks were just trying to get things ""out"".  Well, that is no excuse in my book. The Manager comes over and apologizes as well and I just conveyed my feelings on how it would be nice to actually take my time on my appetizer before main course showed up.   We got our main courses and were happy with the food.  We had the pulled pork sandwich and the prawns over pasta.  Huge portions which neither of us could finish but all tasted fine.   The waitress comes over and hands us a gift card and vip 20% off card and apologized for the way the food came out.  We thanked her and continued to try to make a dent into our entree's.  About 15 minutes later, the manager comes back, reaches down on the table and grabs the Gift card and discount card that were in an envelope thing and tell us that ""this was not meant to be given to you, it was for another table"" and walks away.  Really really strange!  We told the waitress, she was mystified as well and told us she would get the manager back over, but at that point, i had had enough and told her not to worry about it.  We went on our way with dumbfounded looks on our face.   I can say, i will be back but will not make it a priority to go to BJ's with all the other options in the mall.  This Manager needs to learn how to deal with people a lot more professionally in my opinion.   The food remains consistent at BJ's, the management not so much!"
Joseph L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",122,5,,5.0,9/7/2015,Service was really great. They made sure my food was cooked to perfection and since it took a few minutes longer they discounted our meal which they really didn't have to do. Top notch service.
Maria-Christina D.,"San Jose, CA",29,9,5,4.0,6/2/2015,Absolutely love coming here because of the food! Some servers are great and some careless. Recommend trying pizookie
Jackie L.,"San Jose, CA",96,11,16,1.0,12/6/2014,"Mother huggers... If I had the option I would give this less than one star. When we got here we made a reservation and they told us 1 hour. So we thought it was reasonable and waited. We have been waiting 2 hours and they finally came outside and told us to wait a little bit longer(about 10 minutes). They also told us that they paged us earlier and gave up our table, but our pager did not ring, we know this was a lie because we hear them constantly calling tables on the PA system. Even after they said it would take 10 minutes, it took over an additional half hour. I am not coming back here again, at least cheesecake factory is next door. Btw Grilled chicken Alfredo was watery and the pasta was hard."
Robert N.,"Henderson, NV",18,125,20,5.0,5/24/2014,"Went there for apps and drinks, happy hour(3-7) has great priced apps and drinks. Place was busy for a Wednesday, but accommodating. Patio looks nice but close to traffic(parking lot). Nice menu, takes some time to read it. Food is awesome got pot stickers and sante fe spring rolls. Tasty"
Elizabeth N.,"San Jose, CA",81,118,260,4.0,5/5/2012,It's a happy place. I like their selection of appetizers and mini meals. Parking is pretty awful as the place gets packed. Good party/sports bar vibe. Great comfort food.
Shakeel A.,"San Jose, CA",2,64,2,1.0,7/1/2013,"Service has really really gone down the toilet. I was here with another family this past Sat (June 29th) at around 9:30pm. Was told the wait would be about 45 minutes. They do not take reservations for less than 10 people. Kids love this place so we decided to wait. After about an hour we asked what the position was the guy at the table said we were a party of 7 (4 adults, one high chair and 2 less than 5 years old) and needed a larger booth. He then told us that there was a booth being cleared in the pub section and we can get that table as it was first come first serve. I ran over to reserve the spot but as I approached someone else got there before me. You would think that if there were first come first serve seating in a section, we might have been able to secure a seat an hour and a half earlier???? We then requested to speak to some up the chain... this is where it gets interesting... the lady told us we could sit outside.. or wait till more till the 2 tables were free(mind you all this while adjacent tables were emptying and people after us were being serviced because they were smaller parties). It was hot outside and the kids were beginning to get cranky especially the little one. We still wanted to talk to the manager and then someone miraculously showed up. She began attempting to explain our situation to him with her spin on it. I explained to the manager our situation, where he asked front desk guy what we were told the wait was. He told him we were told 45 minutes(doubt that guy will be there for long), then he asked if it was 45 minutes since we were here?????? Then I knew what I was dealing with... it continues....  He asked how long we were there, to which I replied for almost an hour and a half where she interjected saying I had said an hour before and now I was telling the manager it was an hour and a half. Since were at the front, I asked the front desk guy to tell us how long our wait was and still going on(I still had our buzzer with me)... needless to say she was wrong and proved wrong by her own staff. She was miffed big time!! Regardless, it was becoming a scene and we were surrounded by wait staff and one of the dudes became aggressive(Z was his name?) and told us to just leave while my other friend was still talking to the manager. I ignored him as I knew he was there because of customers like us. Without trying to help us in any way the manager told us he refused to serve us and asked us to leave. So we did......."
Scott J.,"Morgan Hill, CA",60,24,2,4.0,6/15/2015,The prices I think are a bit high but that's what you get for a location in the mall. Menu is pretty large and the deep dish pizza is good. Happy hour is ok price wise. Good for morning football games. Tip: offer discount movie tickets with meal purchase
Kaveeta A.,"San Jose, CA",81,27,21,1.0,11/1/2015,"Service is terrible here. Went in for lunch today and was told wait time for two will be 15-20 mins, got seated after 30 mins despite the fact that there were about 6 tables empty. I don't know if they were short staffed or just slow. Finally, was able to get the table for two, we already knew what we wanted, so when the waitress came to take the order we were ready. Repeated my order twice and she repeated back just to verify no bacon on my pizza. Waited about ten minutes for water and she didn't even bring out the appetizer. Waited about 35 minutes for food and guess what when the food finally arrived it was wrong. No chicken on the pizza but with bacon and ham. And I am still waiting for the appetizer. When I told the waitress that the order is wrong she looked very confused and finally offered to place another order. We were starving so we told her it's okay. She went ahead and told her manager who showed up and seemed more confused than anything else. I don't know how she manages the place. I repeated my order to her and the waitress repeated the order as well but the manager kept saying she doesn't get it. Showed her ham and bacon on the pizza but she believed that I made a mistake while ordering, so she went to grab the menu to prove me wrong but I was right. Anyways finally she said she will replace the order and by that time I told her I'll eat the pizza and remove the bacon and ham. Mind you my chicken pizza didn't have no chicken. After all that happened, the waitress didn't come and check on us once. She brought the bill at least with no sorry or thank you. Very crappy customer service."
Amy B.,"Los Gatos, CA",29,12,,5.0,8/14/2015,Bj's always has a great selection of food! My family has very picky eaters and there's always something on the menu that each one of us will like- not to mention really yummy!!! Because this place is so good there is always a long wait but it's worth it if you can hang in there ;)
Elainne R.,"San Jose, CA",31,54,43,4.0,4/17/2015,Loved the lemon chicken! Adorned my waiter and waitress! Definitely coming back :) thanks guys!
Meagan R.,"San Jose, CA",126,5,5,5.0,6/2/2015,"My friends and I enjoy coming here because they have a cool happy hour, good food and the drinks are whatever but we normally just get a glass of wine or something... The thing that I hate about BJ's is that they ALWAYS have terrible service... you sit forever before someone even comes to the table, food takes forever and the servers just aren't attentive at all. Being a server myself, I can't even believe it sometimes, but that's beside the point.. So, I go in yesterday (monday evening) and a friend and I sat in the cocktail area, I believe my servers name was Danny but I'm not completely sure.. So let me tell you, he was the best server that I have EVER had there, he was friendly, attentive, patient and made sure that everything was all good! He was definitely on top of his shit! Props to you Danny (if that was your name lol), you just earned five stars!!"
Lucy D.,"Milpitas, CA",485,786,1873,4.0,5/24/2011,"BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse combines new American cuisines with several other different cultures. They are known for there beers and there appetizers are simple delicious. If its your birthday they give you a free piziooke.  Pros Service: The service here is wonderful and attentive.  Food: They have a huge variety of food. There appetizers are simple delicious and there pizza is crispy and fresh. They have a large spaghetti menu and most of them are simple delicious. Like its name sake they are known for there specialty beer. AND the drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) goes well with all the food you get.  Location: This place is conveniently located in a shopping mall where you can shop and maybe catch a movie afterwards.   Atmosphere: The atmosphere is lively and the decorations is similar to a sports bar.  Cons Crowded: This place can get packed on the weekdays and the weekends during dinner so make a reservation or come early, but expect to wait long wait times if you don't have a reservation.  Parking: Can be a pain when it gets packed because its next to other restaurants and the shopping center so expect to park far if you come during the night time.  Overall this place is a great place to bring a group to come and enjoy the ambiance. Definitely a great place for sports fan to come and relax in a great atmosphere."
John A.,"Salt Lake City, UT",16,5,1,4.0,5/31/2015,"As a Georgia girl living in Northern California, the fried chicken was both nostalgic and orgasmic. Lost a star because they haven't figured out how to deliver well. Half my family's food was cold and it was all tossed around. I'd like to eat the food again, but not with delivery"
Anthony P.,"San Jose, CA",73,187,339,1.0,5/18/2013,"-5 stars I didn't even eat here because the hosts pissed me off before my gf and I could even sit down. We were shopping at Oakridge and were starving. I wanted something that wasn't going to fill me up too much and was going to order off their enlightened menu.  It was a warm day and we wanted to eat in the outdoor patio. The guy at the host stand said ""uuuuummmmm (while looking at the schedule) we don't have anyone covering that area for another 45 mintues."" We decided to eat in the dining room. The girl host brought us over to a booth that was uncomfortably close to another party. When we asked if we could have the booth right next to it she said ""ummm no I'm sorry."" WHAT!? NO I'M SORRY I EVEN TRIED EATING HERE! It was literally one booth difference. WHATS THE BIG FUCKING DEAL! We walked out and BJ's lost money because they don't know anything about customer service. It was a slow Wednesday afternoon and they couldn't even accommodate the simplest of requests.   Note to Management: What ever the customer wants the customer gets! ""No"" should not be in your vocabulary. I'm a paying customer and if I want to dine outside, you are supposed to find a way to make it happen, especially when your restaurant is near empty! Final Thoughts: Never coming here again and telling my family who dines here all the time not to return because of how I was treated.."
Hanh D.,"San Jose, CA",6,37,6,4.0,4/4/2015,Currently in love with their Mediterranean chicken pita tacos! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Lots of tvs all around so you can watch the sports while munching away.
Dany B.,"Union City, CA",323,530,2692,3.0,3/7/2012,"Love that we can call ahead for reservations, since most places like this won't even let us do that! Love the ambiance, it's never too load and never too quiet, Anywhere you sit you can spot a TV with something to watch. Host are always nice. Wish the Waiters and waitresses were too. But most of the time they are too busy since we go during lunch or dinner peak hours.  The last time I was there, the waiter kept forgetting my drink, all I wanted was water. I always order the classic potato with chicken and broccoli and a side of alfredo sauce. These potatoes are ginormous! I always have leftovers for the next meal at work or home :D. Pazookies! I always have to get one and share it because that portion is big too. Appetizers ... I would not get the wantons again. It was warm on the outside and cold on the inside. It was like eating cold chicken with a peanut sauce. You can never go wrong with the spinach dip though :D"
