Yennie L.,"San Jose, CA",112,354,151,3.0,6/1/2017,Not a usual here but my friend had her birthday celebrated here. We had a party of 10+ got an outdoor private seating area.they have a lot of selections here..
Jay A.,"San Jose, CA",3,116,11,4.0,10/20/2017,BJ's is consistently good no matter where you go. The only issue I ever have with this place is the noise. They blast music 24/7 which makes it very hard to hear anyone with whom you might be dining. Too bad.
Alex B.,"Oyster Point, CA",47,24,,2.0,5/12/2017,"I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes, it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar, I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes, but of course, there are shining exceptions.  The food is decent for the most part, with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times, and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard, but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas. While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller, contrarily, entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much, but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable. Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food, but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth."
Sergio M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,1,1.0,5/12/2017,Service was ok. Location is good. Ambience was as expected. Food was sub-par. They shouldn't show photos of the food if they aren't going to bring you whar they show in the menu.  Steak was inedible and tiny.
Jess R.,"San Jose, CA",3,18,1,5.0,10/15/2017,"I have been coming to this BJs for years. Food is consistently good, service is usually pretty quick, and the pizookies are always delicious. My boyfriend and I decided to have a rare date night tonight and wanted to share about the great service we received! We were both tired and hungry after a long day and John, our server, totally changed our mood around. He was attentive, made us laugh, and made our night! Will definitely ask for him next time we come in!"
Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",82,59,17,5.0,5/7/2017,"My boyfriend and I have been coming to this location for 3 years (regulars) and have had okay service. The food is delicious & we've never had a complaint about that. Our service however has always been lacking. Either the waiter takes too long to bring our drinks or to ask if we need anything else. Tonight however, we were delighted to have been served by Corina at the bar. She was attentive, smiling, and in such a positive mood that it really contributed to our overall experience. Next time we sit at the bar at BJs, we'll definitely make sure we're sitting in her section!"
Jim J.,"San Jose, CA",68,18,,1.0,4/27/2017,"So my wife and I decide to have lunch and watch the Giants game today. When we arrive, no Giants pre-game. Instead, there's an East coast baseball game, soccer, and tennis on all the tv's.  So I ask our waitress if it would be possible to actually watch a Bay Area team, the Giants. She said she would check. 15 minutes later they finally put on the game, on 1 damn tv. I'm trying to understand the logic of BJ's.  We are living in the Bay Area. We like to watch our local teams, especially when they are playing their rival Dodgers. So we get one screen, and the funny part is watching customers straining their necks to try and watch the game. Someone needs to knock some sense on their management. This is the last time I will be patronizing BJ's. and it's too bad because the beer and food is pretty good. Come on, get your head out of your rear orifice and actually cater to the locals."
Shu T.,"San Jose, CA",206,334,,3.0,5/5/2017,"I came here because they were giving out free beer for teachers for Teachers Appreciation Week. We also ordered calamari and a rack of ribs. There was a special on rack of ribs for $20. There is plenty of seating in the bar area, so I would suggest sitting there because there is a wait for the non bar area. I found the calamari pretty tender and the tartar sauce was yummy. I don't normally like tartar sauce. The rack of ribs was super dry, although adding more BBQ sauce made it taste better. It came with two sides, brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The brussel sprouts were overdone and not crunchy. The mashed potatoes were creamy though. The service was good, and I probably wouldn't recommend this place for the food. However, it is a great place to watch games and grab a drink with friends."
Asal F.,"San Jose, CA",12,4,46,5.0,12/11/2016,"Came here with my friend after a hard day, but ended up leaving happy and content!  A few slices of pizza and a few margaritas later ... life is good again! Lol  Our server Biagio made the biggest difference though... he actually cared and was very attentive to us! He recommended great choices for foods and drinks based on our likes and even comforted us with a hug (per our request)! He was sincere, sweet, and accommodating, a server who became a friend. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening  and the food/ drinks, and went home completely relaxed! He would do great in a leadership position with his calm and kind vibe!  Would definitely come back again as we love the vibe of this place. Highly recommend it !"
Scott P.,"San Jose, CA",61,177,15,3.0,8/18/2017,"My wife and I came here for a date.  for a Tuesday night and not being crowded, they were kinda slow.  the waitress really took her time to get to us. We finally ordered.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my wife ordered the fried chicken sandwich.  I would say that it arrived on time. However they did not give my wife the correct item.  They gave her some sort of burger.  The waitress never came back to check on us.  The burger was good but not what she was wanted.  When the waitress finally returned, she informed us she going on break and handed us off to her substitute.  He was much better. he was attentive and informative.  He came back to check on us.  We were disappointed with the first waitress, but the second waiter  (perhaps by comparison) was awesome."
Josie L.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,4/6/2017,"Service here is great! I'm only putting 4 stars because the Bloody Mary I ordered was VERY strong, I didn't taste anything but pure alcohol and couldn't really drink it. Other than that, I ordered a burger and it was super tasty and my waiter was so cute and helpful when I asked questions on the menu. I love their calamari also. Waiters and waitresses seemed very professional.  Will return but maybe try a glass of wine next time."
Alpha S.,"San Jose, CA",2,43,33,5.0,9/26/2016,"The five of us walked in around 6pm and got seated right away.  Cesar (I hope I spelled his name right), came by and got our drink order. The service was quick and friendly.  The food was good, and arrived fast.  Cesar checked on us frequently.  I had the seared ahi salad for dinner, and it was great. We had a bunch of weird requests, and they accommodated us. Over all, the experience was a solid 4, but Cesar pushed it up to five stars."
Kacie C.,"San Jose, CA",57,40,227,4.0,3/5/2016,"When ordering the steaks, ask for it to be cooked below your usual preference. My boyfriend ordered the top sirloin steak medium well although his steak came out extra well done, making the steak pretty dry.  I chose the shrimp and asparagus penne which was pretty good, nothing to complain about and I loved the knot roll that came along with it. We also got the pizookie trio which was our (and I think everyone else's) favorite! We chose the new money bread flavor, cookies and cream, and double chocolate..all three were amazing! I've heard many people had bad experiences when coming to BJs but we received great service that night from our server, Patrick!  This place is great for a late night dinner, but any place open this late you really can't expect a five star meal."
Marcelo I.,"San Jose, CA",20,63,47,4.0,1/8/2017,"Look, I know it is not super cool, but the deep dish pizza here is delicious.  If you are driving to the mall to see a movie, just eat here.  Sure you could drive somewhere hipper first before you go the mall to see the movie, but why?  It's right here. It has pizza, it has wings.  It has great Brussel sprouts.  Just make life easier and get over yourself."
Brian C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",49,59,24,2.0,1/27/2017,"I've been to another BJs before with a pretty positive experience.  My wife and I came in to watch the Raider game, have a drink and a burger. Well, two burgers and two drinks later, we were welcomed with a $50 tab. Theres nothing about this place that is worth $25 per person for lunch."
Daniel N.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",82,6,1,5.0,6/15/2017,"So I git the steak with two sides of mash. It was good and pretty cheap, around $24 for my meal alone, And excellent customer service"
Kay L.,"San Jose, CA",136,19,1,1.0,2/16/2017,"The server had forgotten to add our appetizers in our order, so those never showed up. Our main course took forever and my Fish and chips were not good.  I ended up substituting the fries with onion strings, it it was just a big soggy mess. The bill took forever. The silver wear took forever. Even water took forever. Everything just takes forever here.  I ended up not eating at all and my BF was so pissed he didn't tip. UPDATE: at the bottom of my review you can clearly see that someone from the company told me to contact them. I contacted her through email, got a response, emailed back, and still no resolution. Thanks for nothing. I still haven't been back since!"
Kait P.,"San Jose, CA",89,176,105,4.0,9/9/2016,"I always love coming to BJ's because their food is AMAZING.  Every time I go it's always on a weekend so it'll be busy - wait times are usually 30 minutes to an hour but if you want to sit in the bar it's open seating so I'd rather do that!  All the waiters are super nice and very attentive to your wait time and what you need during your visit. The restaurant is kept very clean - I've never had any complaints about sticky tables, food on the ground, etc. like at other places. The food is always super good. I love coming here for their burgers and fries - if I have a craving this is the place to go! The pulled pork sandwich is very good and you know you'll always have to get their pazookies!  They also have a deal where you if you eat at their restaurant, you can get discounted movie tickets. It's a win-win! Definitely returning"
Cindy C.,"San Mateo, CA",410,450,3439,1.0,11/22/2015,"It feels as though I'll never have a good experience at this place... Came in around 8pm on a Friday night and was told there was going to be 1+ hour wait. I liked that they took down our number and would text us when our table was ready. An hour passed though... no text message. We came back, asked, and was told there was just one couple ahead of us. Finally got seated. For the first time we got a server who was friendly and very attentive. Our drink orders were taken immediately. Hefeweizen for the boyfriend and orange cream soda for myself (with refills). I highly suggest it! Next time I want to try their new soda cocktails. Ordered the calamari (had to give it a second chance) for an appetizer. Again it was a disappointment being drenched in SO much oil. If you don't mind oil dripping off your fingers and face - I guess it was a decent dish. I, however, did NOT think so.  Boyfriend got the brisket bacon burger (I know, I know - heart attack in between buns). Came with choice of fries or potato wedges. I'm surprised they didn't offer a cold slaw side dish. Burger was good. The brisket was absolutely delicious. Apparently the kitchen misread the ticket and gave away my jumbo spaghetti and meatballs to someone at the bar, while I got a shrimp pasta... Sent it back of course. Took another 15 minutes before I got my meal and by then my boyfriend had long finished his. The meatballs were definitely jumbo and I did enjoy them. But the sauce was too runny and the worse part was how extremely spicy it was!!! After a few bites I just couldn't take it anymore and it became inedible. Taking a closer look I realized there were handfuls of dried pepper flakes. I don't remember it saying anything about being spicy in the description of this dish... Highlight of this meal was our server who constantly came to check in on us and refill our drinks. Too done with the meal to even go for dessert sadly..."
Monika H.,"San Jose, CA",421,102,172,4.0,6/10/2016,"We stopped at this BJ's restaurant to watch the Warriors-Cavaliers play Game 4 of the NBA Finals and to sip some beers.  The game was shown on the big screen TV near the bar, and we lucked out on getting some seats (eventually) at  the  bar. The crowd definitely was in to the game, which made it fun, and the beers were good.  I had a peach ale (the name of which I cannot remember) and my guy had a ginger IPA (""Devil's Brew""?).  We also split a jalepeno burger (substituted with a turkey patty) and steak fries. The kitchen apparently was REALLY busy.  So, the fries came out separately from the burger, but it was fine. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves tremendously, particularly because the Warriors won! GO, GOLDEN STATE!"
