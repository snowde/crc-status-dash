Alison ..,"Santa Clara, CA",5,162,6,2.0,9/4/2013,"A friend of mine really likes this restaurant.  We usually go to this location because it's kid friendly, and it's easy to get to from his home since we're off 85.  It was a pain to find parking at Oakridge Mall, but, we were there on a Saturday. Anyway, after taking a restless 2-year old to San Antonio Park, the five of us went for lunch on August 24th.  We've been there before, and the food and drinks were fine on our last visit.  But, not on this one.   Two members of our group, including me, ordered BJ's homemade Root Beer.  It was flat, much like leaving an opened soda in the refrigerator.  We asked for replacements, got the same thing. We asked if they could take it off the bill.  Service was slow- slower than normal.  Flora and I ordered fish and chips.  I've had better fish and chips when Jack and the Box had it on the menu.   Of the better items, the Barbeque sandwich that my husband ordered, and the Danny's Fettuccine Alfredo were the better choices.    The two year old had food from Mommy and Daddy's plates, just as well.  None of the food was hot, just  lukewarm.   After we finally received the bill, we noticed they left the root beer on the bill, even after we told them to remove it from the check.  I could see the server having a conversation with the manager, but he did not stop by or give us an apology.   If we go to another BJ's we will opt for another location.  Better option- somewhere else.."

Erika N.,"San Jose, CA",31,4,,2.0,6/17/2015,"The food was good and the waitress was friendly. However, my grandmother and I shared dessert, and someone else brought it and me a dirty spoon. It still had food on it and it was disgusting, I've only been there twice, but I've heard good things about this place. Now I'm not so sure I want to go back."
Tony R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",273,69,110,4.0,5/11/2011,"BJ's is definitely a good place to come to hang out, drink, and get a bite to eat. But what you would probably expect from a brewhouse/restaurant is a good place to come a catch a game. This is only half true, the bar area is decent, there is plenty of televisions and projectors to catch the games and latest sports news, but the bar area is kinda small here, and if you're sitting in the booths or tables outside of the bar you wont get much of a view of the games which is a negative for me.  The good points:  1.) Good choice of brews, both house and imports/domestics.  2.) Variety of food with good options, and their menu is quite tasty.  3.) Happy hour is good, it's only available if you're sitting in the bar area, so just a heads up.  4.) Plates are fairly priced, and the portions are big. The bad points: 1.) This location is located in the mall, as well as in the front where there is a lot of other restaurants, as well as a movie theater, so parking can be a (bleep) sometimes. 2.) Televisions away from the bar are small and spread far apart so it isn't great for watching games.  Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 3pm-7pm, Sunday-Thursday from 10pm-close. $1.00 Off Draft Beers, $1.00 Off Cocktails, Half Off Mini Pizza & $2.00 Off Shareable Appetizers. Wine Down Tuesday - Half Off ALL Wine by the Glass & Bottle (All Day Tuesday) Recommendations:  Spinach Artichoke Dip, Chicken Wings, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Seared Ahi, Great White Pizza, Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, the California Burger and you definitely can't come here without having yourself a pazookie, my personal favorites are the white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie and the red velvet pazookie. Trust me, you won't regret your decision."
Gaby M.,"Gilroy, CA",253,8,1,5.0,7/16/2015,"Bruk was my server this evening and he was amazing!! He was very friendly to my friends and I. He made our experience with BJ's AMAZING!! If you come in, please ask Bruk as your server! He will give you the best service! Overall nice and friendly guy! We will be back again Bruk!!"
Mellanie D.,"San Jose, CA",170,231,222,3.0,11/20/2011,"When I think of BJs I think of their Pazooki!!! Definitely a must try even if you are full!  You have a lot to choose from on the menu from burgers, pizza, pastas, salads, steaks, salmon, ribs, pork chops, and various chicken dishes. They also have a gluten free pizza and you can get a gluten free pazooki! How awesome is that?!?! Been here a couple times with friends for lunch and was here recently for lunch after a movie. Service is ok as we were checked on from time to time and our drinks were filled right away if we asked or topped off if the waiter/waitress came by.  I must say their giant stuffed potatoes are really stuffed and big, BBQ chicken pizza is yum, and their spinach stuffed mushrooms and mac and cheese saved me as they were soft and easy to chew after getting my wisdom teeth pulled.  Downside is how busy the parking area is as its connected with the mall, movie theatre, other restaurants and the mall's food court. You are better off doing valet for $7 or parking and walking from the nearby garage (unless you like circling around or stalking someone who comes out to grab their parking spot)."
Thang M.,"San Jose, CA",2,5,1,1.0,6/9/2015,Im starting to dis like this place and may never come to any bjs restaurant. I tried to be discreet about my complaint but its been almost a week i sent a complaint email to   and no sincere apologies ever made. I posted a comment on their facebook page twice but its filtered. Im not a yelper  but i sure do have lots of friends and family who does. Bad management...smh
Hanibal P.,"San Jose, CA",11,74,163,5.0,4/7/2014,Great food and awesome customer service. Tonight Justin was our server hes great smily and friendly.  Try fresh Atlantic fresh salmon. Yamiiiiiii
Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",285,689,138,3.0,8/10/2011,"I've been to several BJ's and this one is probably the worst, so far. It's always super packed and LOUD. There's always a 20+ min wait for anything after happy hour. When it's packed, the servers will try to shuffle you to the crappy outdoor seating unless you protest.. which you should definitely do unless you are a masochist. This is where LARGE, drunk, screamy parties are sat and the suckers who agree to be sat near them will experience intolerable levels of noise. I don't know what makes the sound reverberate so loudly, but it's just intolerable and I would not advise anyone sit outside if any large parties are already there. As for the rest of the location, my main gripe is the slow and forgetful servers. Reminding people several times to bring me what I asked for 20 minutes ago isn't pleasant.  I'd only recommend this location for happy hour or lunch unless you're just coming here to enjoy the bar and/or get drunk. If you're sober, you probably won't enjoy it much after 5pm or so."
Tee S.,"San Jose, CA",16,357,237,4.0,1/19/2014,"As with any chain restaurant, the service and food can be a hit or miss.  We seem to come up fairly if not totally pleased with this location most of the time.  The location has high volume of customers so your food is always fresh.   The servers are fun.  The layout of the restaurant is good."
Mona U.,"San Jose, CA",17,69,,4.0,4/27/2015,"I really like this place! The food is good, the beers are great! But the best thing is their handcrafted root beer! I've never tasted root beer that good from anywhere else! The atmosphere here is very relaxed and I love that there's ample seating inside and outside."
Guio L.,"San Jose, CA",111,42,,4.0,8/18/2013,"Pros: Love the ambience at the bar Good variety of beer Attentive service Decent price Cons: Recently, it has been piled with underage kids. Not drinking alcohol but really noisy. Bday parties, etc. not cool for a brewery Quality of ground beef on burger is like a Carl's jr  Parking is a nightmare  Would I go back? Yes, but stick to the bar."
John R.,"San Jose, CA",15,36,1,4.0,3/3/2015,"Been coming back for a little over a year now, and am happy to say that this location has greatly changed for the better.   I've had consistently good service, and overall food quality is excellent+.   TIP:  Use the BJ's app to put your name on the wait-list before you leave the house.   You still have to go up to the counter and check-in, and depending on who's working, they may appear a tad confused about it, but it appears to work well and can save you a lot of time."
Kimmy N.,"San Francisco, CA",106,27,29,1.0,9/2/2014,"Went here on a Tuesday night, and it wasn't too crowded. My boyfriend and I were seated right away but were practically abandoned after that. We went 15-20 min without being approached by anyone. We ended up flagging down a waitress walking by and waited another 5 min before our actual waitress came. She didn't introduce herself and just took our order. She didn't check up on us our whole meal, besides coming by to take away empty appetizer plates and in the middle of the meal while food on fork and fork still in hand she asks if I'm still working on my plate? (Duh!) and asks ""are you going to need a box for that?"" Talk about rushy! She disappeared practically the whole meal and came by only to rush us to finish. Worst and practically nonexistent service ever! Food wise, it was mediocre. Appetizers over entrees all day."
Kim C.,"San Jose, CA",46,6,4,5.0,12/1/2014,I come here at least 2 times a month with my bf and son. Every visit we had great service and great food. Nothing to complain about.
Jen D.,"San Jose, CA",21,90,10,4.0,10/8/2013,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a great place to have big dinner parties.  I usually have dinner at BJ's for birthday's, special occasions, or a date night.  Depending on what you choose for food, it can be hit or miss, but most of the time I'm satisfied with what I order.  When they're busy, their service can be mediocre.   It's a great place to come for dessert if you're ever craving a pazookie.  My favorite is the white chocolate macadamia pazookie, can't go wrong with that choice all the time."
Rohit M.,"San Jose, CA",54,148,20,3.0,7/22/2013,Just like any other BJs. Super crowded when I went though. It was a Friday evening. I recommend the boneless buffalo wings with celery. And their shrimp tacos are definitely above average. A light yet satusfying meal.
Steve H.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,1,2.0,11/8/2014,"My wife, son and myself arrived at 5:15 and was seated immediately outside. That is about the only positive experience at this restaurant. Our server was pleasant but seemed overwhelmed. We ordered burgers and Mac and cheese and It took 35 minutes to receive our food. In my opinion 20 minutes longer than it should have. When we received the food it was luke warm. The ""perfect ending"" to this experience was paying $40.00 cash on a $30.56 bill and getting a $10.00 bill back. Normally I would get a 5 and 5 ones. Was the waitress really planning on getting a $10.00 tip? I left leaving no tip due to not having change and it not being provided. I will not be coming back here."
Jacinda G.,"San Jose, CA",3,1,,5.0,5/12/2015,"Just recently returned to BJ's tonight after a whole 2 months of avoiding the restaurant after terrible customer service and not so good tasting food, but after being dragged out by my friend I have to say I may be coming back more often if I get the same waitress every time. My friend and I had dinner tonight and had Ashley Y served us and she was absolutely amazing! She was super friendly and easy going and really knew how to connect with her customers. She had an amazing personality and you definitely need more employees like her. I've never had a full conversation with a server who genuinely seemed interested. I will be returning to BJ's again in hopes I get the same amazing service that I received from Ashley tonight."
Michelle F.,"San Jose, CA",17,7,,1.0,5/11/2015,Not worth it. Spend your money at PF changs or Marie calendars. Tastes like it's frozen crap. Not a fan. The quality of the food for the money you pay is not acceptable.
