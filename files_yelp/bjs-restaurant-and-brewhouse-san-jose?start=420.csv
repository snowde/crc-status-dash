Jackie H.,"Milpitas, CA",276,232,57,2.0,2/25/2013,"Oh come on, I do not want to wait 10 minutes just for a semblance of attention from our server!! The food is standard between other BJ's establishments. It's consistently good, and I never have a complaint about my order. My basic critique is the service. Please, there were 12.5 groups in the entire restaurant, you would expect some attention.  We sat down, waited 10 minutes to be greeted by our server, only had three meek interactions with our server and we got better attention from the clean-up staff than our actual server.  Get your act together BJ's staff. I braved 35 minutes of hell with the ridiculous parking situation you have at Oakridge Mall just to eat your amazing pizookies. Give me some attention, I promise I'll tip well."
Robin L.,"Santa Clara, CA",131,15,11,3.0,7/11/2011,"The only reason I'm giving Bj's 3 stars is because of their pizookie's and the very few server's that have given me decent service.  I've been to a lot of BJ's restaurants and it's all the same service:  Uninviting, inattentive and unprofessional.   Their menu is okay.  I am a BURGER LOVER and i have to say their classic burger is awesome.  Maybe it was just because it was a huge chunk of meat and I was super hungry, but it was AMAZING.  The artichoke dip was okay.  I loved it while in the process of consumption, but then again I think I was hungry.  Of  course i have to give it up for their Pizookie's.  That's a given.  Everything else is bleh... I'm not a huge beer drinker, but their line up is good.  I've only tried a few, but I think it was the Jeremiah red that tickled my fancy!  There is a beer sampler option with all the beers.. such a great idea! All in all, BJ's has it's ups and downs (more downs than ups), but I will most-likely end up going there again... DAMN Pizookie's!!!"
Allyson F.,"San Jose, CA",3,12,8,3.0,4/5/2015,Great food. Long waits. Call ahead of time to reserve a table. Small bar seating area. Nice waiters.
Stefany V.,"Las Vegas, NV",2181,3981,9961,3.0,10/15/2013,"I've been to BJ's before and was unimpressed- frankly, I think their prices are set a bit too high for what you get. But when BF and I saw their commercial for the current special, we went in- soup or salad, a medium pizza, AND a pizookie for $20? Not bad at all! Went in and there was a considerable wait due to the football crowd. Should have arrived sooner instead of at half time, oh well. Wandered the mall while we waited, then were seated and got a great server- unfortunately I can't remember his name.  Due to the good deal on the special, we felt comfortable ordering their seasonal pumpkin ale (which was AWESOME- not too sweet, not too pumpkiny, nice spice to it) and an appetizer of the chicken wontons. Unfortunately, the won tons order was not put in. By the time our server realized it, our pizza was out. Oops. We went ahead and cancelled it- we already had more than enough food and at that point, the purpose of an appetizer was moot. Started with the wedge salad with bleu cheese- love that salad, order it everywhere. Here, it's quite plentiful and the bacon is nice and crisp without crumbling apart. Very nice! Got the deep dish style pizza, half the Classic Combo and half the Favorite. Both were good, but I preferred the Combo- the veggies on the Favorite were not chopped very well and were quite large and undercooked. Not bad, but not my favorite, personally.  For the pizookie, we couldn't decide on a flavor so we had our waiter pick- got the macadamia nut white chocolate chip. Yum. Unfortunately this particular pizookie was very thin and overcooked- more than half of the cookie seemed to stick to the pan. Oh well, we really didn't need the extra calories.  Service was fine, especially considering the crowd and wait time. Server was polite and personable, and I tipped accordingly- with the deal and our beers, our order was a little over $30, without the deal it would have been closer to $45.  Will return to this location if in the area again while the special is still going, but it's not the closest one to me and their regular pricing does not appeal to me."
Shel N.,"San Jose, CA",321,208,254,5.0,8/27/2011,"SANTA FE SALAD!  This salad is my usual because I love everything about this salad; romaine lettuce, red onions, corn, avocado, tortilla chips, and especially the santa fe dressing. This salad will not let you down!"
Jason T.,"San Jose, CA",92,50,47,1.0,12/30/2012,"The managers at this BJ's discriminate against non-white customers. We were continually told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait while white customers were seated immediately without a reservation. (When asked if they had a reservation, they replied 'no'.) After a total of an hour of waiting, we were asked to leave. This is kind of behavior highly unacceptable and no one should eat at this location until the management is fired and replaced. Preferably they should also check their discriminatory attitudes."
Katrina T.,"Cupertino, CA",61,959,1588,3.0,6/25/2011,"I don't know why I always end up going to this BJ's location when there is one seriously 5 minutes away from my house. Every time I go here I always make sure to get a Pizookie. YUM. Probably the best part about BJ's is their Pizookie. I usually get the regular chocolate chip cookie with the vanilla ice cream, but this time I got the red velvet cookie with the vanilla ice cream because it sounded so mouthwatering. I should've gotten my original choice because the red velvet cookie was way too sweet and the ice cream made it worse.  The food quality is alright. It isn't the best food ever, but it is decent enough and the prices are like any other restaurant. The food always looks rushed whenever I eat here though. You could tell by the placement of the food. Oh well, I guess it is because this place is a chain and they just serve and make food at a bare minimum."
Melanie C.,"San Jose, CA",81,279,50,2.0,10/30/2013,"This place is usually packed, and we stalk the bar area to avoid 45 minute waits. Most of the time we avoid the restaurant altogether because of the stupid mall parking setup, but we do come occasionally. We usually just order the flatbread pizzas, being vegetarian, and things are ok. Avocado eggrolls are hit or miss between flavorful and bland. 3 star ratings. My last two visits however were not so great. I ordered a calzone and the waiter seemed a bit confused by my 'topping choices' and asked if I was vegetarian, to which I said yes. The food took an inordinate amount of time to come out, which the waiter apologized for.  And then I found multiple whole pepperoni slices in my calzone. Ugh. Waiter was apologetic and took it off the bill, offered to have it remade or a free dessert etc, but I didn't want to wait any longer than the two hours we'd already been there and declined. The more recent visit, we were seated in inside. The host sounded like he was reading a script. Eventually our waiter came over and took our drink/appetizer order..but not our meal order even though we were ready. He repeated that I said I wanted honey mustard on my salad. Eventually, I'm brought a salad with....ranch. Ok, don't really care so we ate it anyway. Main course seemed to take a while. Dining partner asked for a side of pesto with his flatbread and it didn't come, so we had to ask again. At some point later, he asked for a second order since the first cup was small. We never did get that one. It was also cold in there. Being cold outside, the coat I had with me was too bulky to wear at the table, so I just had to be uncomfortable the whole time. Meh. Not really all that worth it."
May N.,"San Jose, CA",131,170,2384,3.0,12/29/2012,"The food here is okay.  If you have a large group of people, I think this place is good.  It's pretty affordable for a casual large group dinner if you just order a few appetizers, pizzas, and pizookies.  It can get pretty pricy pretty quickly if you order a lot of drinks though, but that's the same anywhere. We usually get a few pizzas and pitchers of beer, and it often comes out to around $11 to $20 per person depending on the amount of drinks ordered.  It's pretty loud, and the service is usually pretty slow since it often is crowded.  But the servers we have had are usually pretty nice and bring what we ask for eventually.  I usually just come here if there's a good deal going on or if we are planning to have dinner with 10 or more people."
Catheria S.,"San Francisco, CA",239,65,8,4.0,12/3/2013,"Got the sweet pig. Not much sauce & the ingredients were skimped. I was disappointed last time I got pizza from this place, so I'm not sure why I ordered pizza again. The pizookie never disappoints & the service was pretty good compared to the other BJs I've been to."
Jen G.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,217,90,5.0,8/20/2013,"Came here recently for dinner on a weekday around 7:30pm or so and it was packed! Parking is always a nightmare on this side of Oakridge, but luckily, I was with someone who had a sixth sense for spots opening up.  I'm glad I wasn't the one driving! Once we got in the door, there was apparently a 25 minute wait, but the guy at the front said we could try grabbing a seat in the bar area. Lucky for us, they were cleaning a booth in the bar area just as we got up there, so we snagged it before anyone else could! Our server that night was truly on point. She got our food in a timely manner and my water glass was never empty.  We ordered: - Cream soda - Strawberry mojito (sweet) - Mirassou moscato (insanely sweet) - Hawaiian mahi-mahi (satisfying) - Balsamic Glazed Chicken (highly recommended) - Chicken Parmesan pasta - Black and Bleu Burger (blue cheese is a bit strong) Despite the stressful parking situation, I would recommend this place to anyone."
Michelle C.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/20/2015,Those 4 stars are for the servers and the food. But the management there is some of the worst I've encountered. Unprofessional to say the least. I am never one to write reviews and didn't even need an account before today but I felt the need to voice this. I was sitting closest to the bathroom and could hear a negative encounter between one of management and a server and to hear management speak to their employees in such a manor is not something I would expect from this establishment. It was simply out of line. Other than having to hear that conversation the service was great. And the food very good. I will continue to come to this BJ's because it is closest to my house and I have never received bad service from any servers at this location but I do hope the management may learn some tact.
Stephanie B.,"Tracy, CA",577,630,900,3.0,9/18/2009,"Came here for a friend's birthday. She decided to do the whole buffet thing since she had a large group of people. For us, it was about $18 per person.   Honestly, for that price i think we should've had a better selection other than spaghetti and pizza. Service was alright, they took care of our drinks pretty well.  I think they needed to keep bringing us food instead of asking if we wanted more each time. The seating sucked. I don't know if the place has no common sense, but why make such a long long table against a fence without any real way to get out.  They should've made a gap in the middle of the table. such a hassle!"
Wiranda D.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/29/2015,"I love BJ's, this time it was a big disappointment. We waited 20 minutes for a table and another 25 minutes for our food. Unfortunately we only got the good for one person. Had to wait for 15 more minutes for the second persons dish. What was supposed to be a nice night out for two ended up eating separately:-("
Charlene P.,"San Jose, CA",42,149,197,3.0,3/7/2014,I used to go here a lot because I adore their pizookies. But I stopped because of none of their actual entrees were all that appealing. The only thing I loved from their aside from the dessert was their wedge cut fries.  We ordered some meatball type appetizer and it was ridiculously small. Way overpriced for what it was. Their customer service and wait time was fine. Nothing overly exciting stood out. Maybe I'll go back sometime soon to see if anything prominent has changed.
Manfred A.,"San Jose, CA",9,23,2,3.0,4/10/2015,"Beer is good.  Food is getting bad every year.  Why did you guys change your jambalaya dish?  The old style was much better than what you are serving now.  The service is below average.  Past few times it has taken 20 minutes for a server to take our orders.  All said. . . beer is still the reason one gravitates toward this place.  As far as food is concerned, plenty of other places with better food."
Daniel B.,"Campbell, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/23/2015,"Had a terrible experience. Best thing was when i walked in someone was there to greet me, it was all downhill from there. We got out drinks ordered within a few minutes and when we ordered our food we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. 25 minutes later i had to get up to ask for my check because my server had not once checked on us. Reminding everyone that the server had been back and forth past us multiple times. In addition after i asked for my check he then proceeded to bring the food. I told him i did not want the food in which he proceeded with the excuse of its fresh, and its all house made. I kindly told him no, just a check. The manager comped our drinks thank god and then she told me he had put the order in about 15 minutes ago. I was as this point frustrated because he had not been to our table for much longer than that meaning we had obviously not been important enough to eat there. I will never go back unless i have a group of my friends and its the ONLY place that someone can eat."
Mohan G.,"Campbell, CA",3,85,1,4.0,12/19/2014,This is a great place for a team get together. I have been here a couple of times and  its my personal favorite. They brew very different types of beer at this place which are very unique. Their belgian flavors are the best. Their spinach artichoke dip is an awesome appetizer. Their vegetarian pizza is also very tasty and cheesy. BJs famous pizookie is something you should try when you are here.
Jon M.,"Little Elm, TX",216,133,43,4.0,2/11/2013,"I love going to BJ's.  This is a great atmosphere if you are in the mood for some drinks and some pretty good food.  BJ's own brew of beer is quite good as well.  I am a big fan of the Jeremiah Red.  They usually have some kind of seasonal beer too. If you are new to the place, try out the beer sampler.  They give you 7 sample's of their own brew from light to very dark. They have a great selection of food here and everything I have had has always been up to par. The food tastes good and it's hard to pick what you want from the vast selection.  I knocked it down 1 star because I have had a couple times where the service was pretty bad, but it wasn't that often.  Also, it can get kinda pricy between food and drinks.   Other than that, I love coming here and will continue to do so!"
Alex F.,"San Francisco, CA",237,99,61,3.0,4/7/2013,"Grades:  A) The seating area is comfortable and chill.  B) The prices are lower than the Cheesecake Factory.  C) Some of the food is actually better than the Cheesecake Factory.  D) The service is off and on, but most of the time pretty great.  E) If you're here late, enjoy watching the drunk suburban sports' fans at the bar. F) The manager doesn't like to work. He's lazy.  What's great is that they know who they're supposed to be. They're not trying to be something they're not, and that makes for a good restaurant. It's standard American fare, but curated and executed with restraint. Located next to the movie theaters, this is a great place to stop before or after a film. Or, you could take a stroll through the mall to knock off some of those pounds you just put on eating that Pizookie! If I had a friend from overseas visit me, and they wanted to try an ""All American"" dining experience... I would take them here. This is America, commercialized of course. Tip: If you've never been here, you should get an Oreo Pizookie for dessert :)"
