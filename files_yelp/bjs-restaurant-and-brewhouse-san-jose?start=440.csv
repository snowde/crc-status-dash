Holly N.,"San Jose, CA",149,81,1,4.0,11/17/2013,"This place has been packed every time I've ever been here, and like another reviewer, we make a reservation, but then stalk the bar to try and grab a table. This time the pager buzzed right when someone was waving us over to give us their table as they were leaving. So instead of the noisy bar, we sat outside, which was warm with the heat lamps and much quieter. The wait staff was friendly and responsive. We split the margherita flatbread pizza, spinach and artichoke dip, and a Santa Fe salad -- all of which was nicely presented, served in a reasonable amount of time, and quite good. The fun of course was working our way through the beer sampler menu, which sad to say, we failed at, lol. While the Hefeweizen, was good, we both like the Piranha beer the best. All in all a great dining experience, and perfect for a pre-movie dinner."
Mani B.,"Campbell, CA",34,23,6,4.0,11/13/2013,"Came here with the princess for her birthday and it wasn't our first time! I've been to this restaurant a lot and I've seemed to like whatever I've gotten. This time, I had the Scampi Pasta and she had gotten the Cobb salad. Both tasted great but the pasta would have tasted better if it was just $2 cheaper!"
buddhamae m.,"San Jose, CA",1,39,,1.0,1/15/2016,"My last visit I was truly disappointed.  They have gone from GREAT to just downright awful.  I ordered guacamole, salsa and chips.  The chips were the better than the guac and salsa. Who in their ""right mind"" would add cucumbers to guacamole and salsa?  What a ""god-awful"" mixture!!!  I wanted to order calamari, but they don't have cocktail sauce, only marinara.  They no longer have the Garlic salad dressing I would get with the Honey chicken salad, now it comes with honey mustard dressing...BJs, you really need to fire the person making these decisions because obviously, he/she knows absolutely nothing about food!  I won't be back ever again."
Leslie F.,"San Jose, CA",18,5,1,2.0,2/13/2015,We have eaten here many times but the mashed potatoes were to dry and the asparagus was old or over cooked
Mr. S.,"San Jose, CA",1,23,3,3.0,1/11/2016,"I don't know why people love this place so much. Honestly I think it's overhyped. Every time my friends or family drag me to this place, it's always a let down. The atmosphere and service is great though, so that's what pushed my rating from 2 up to 3. Starting with the food, it's all boring. Nothing special about their deep dish pizza. It's just like Pizza Hut's pan pizza. Super thick bread with cheese and toppings. Chicago-style would be so much better. The veggie burgers are average, and you can find better ones elsewhere. The thin and crispy fries were good. The tomato bisque soup was also good, though the sourdough bread bowl was bland and not sour at all. I liked the artichoke dip, though they only give a small amount for the price. And they got rid of the colored chips for plain white chips. The worst experience was with the beers. First, I appreciate that they have the 4 5oz taster flight option. This allowed me to taste 4 shit beers instead of just 1. I wanted their house porter and stout, as well as Santa Clara Valley Brewing's IPA and Red Ale. They were out of the red, so they gave me their house red. SCVB's IPA was pretty average for IPAs really, and that was the high point for the flight. Each house beer was terrible though. For one, I think both the stout and porter were on Nitro, since the beer was flat and the foam had fine, tiny bubbles, and I didn't notice that anywhere on the menu. I didn't like the nitro. In the end, I just got a 5th taster of Goose Island, which tasted great and washed away the taste of the bad ones that preceded it. On the way out, I saw they had Grand Cru, which I would have loved to try, but wasn't anywhere on the menu, nor on the drinks menu, nor on the little signs on the tables, so I didn't have the chance to order it sadly. I don't think I'd ever come back here for food. The atmosphere is pretty cool for hanging out with friends though, so I might be swayed on those grounds alone. Of course, there's plenty of other places in SJ to hang out too. No split checks, but they'll accept up to 5 cards if you do the math."
Alice B.,"Cupertino, CA",0,48,,2.0,3/11/2016,Called and was told it was a 45 minute wait and out in the call ahead list. It was well over an hour before we were called. We still ended up waiting more than 45 minutes. I would rather they just be honest with the time or don't use the call ahead if it doesn't work correctly. You just end up with a lot of mad customers.
Stephen R.,"San Jose, CA",136,252,188,4.0,7/30/2013,"This is a great place to go when looking to eat out late at night in South SJ. We called and put our name in as we were leaving the house and were seated right when we got there. They put is in the outdoor area which was quite nice even late at night, plenty of heaters out there. Our waitress was nice and friendly. The only speck in what would otherwise be flawless service was that I had to ask for ketchup twice. She quickly made up for this though by delivering freshly cooked fries with the ketchup. I added a star just for her doing this! Ive had plenty of dishes here in the past but this last time I went for the Double Deluxe Burger. This thing is HUGE, 2100 calories or so according to the menu. I also added the side salad. Overall the burger was good. A little greasy, but not to the point where the buns are soggy. I feel like the special sauce they use is a little tame, because to be honest it tasted like any other burger I've had. I think the sauce is what would (should) distinguish it from other burgers. The thin-cut fries were delicious!  No pizookie for us this time, I was stuffed. Food coma. Yes I literally did pass out the moment I got home, and even had a food hangover the next morning. Lesson: the Deluxe Burger is a lot of food."
Ivadine M.,"San Jose, CA",188,89,1,3.0,1/8/2013,"I've always liked BJ's.  Nothing wrong could always go here. Their food is pretty on point. Try out the appetizers, it's quite yummy. Calamari, this type of avocado eggroll, and such. Main dishes ain't to shabby, I don't really eat here for dinner, I just go here for a late lunch or lunch.  Enough about that, the desserts are so yummmmy. Pizookies are amazing! If you don't know what that is, it's a huge warm cookie with ice cream on top. You can have 2 different cookies in one dessert. For instance, red velvet cookie and chocolate chip cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream.  White chocolate macadamia is pretty good also too!  So, you have to make room for dessert. I would write a review about their beers, but I haven't tried any yet b/c I'm not even 21.. )= I heard it was good though ;)"
Elsvette B.,"San Jose, CA",388,220,204,3.0,9/29/2012,"I am not fond of writing lukewarm reviews. They are the hardest to write. What compels me to write is when either something really stands out positively or drastically horrible.  I've noticed I didn't have a three star review yet, and after my visit to BJs last night, it screamed mediocre! Yet .... I cannot avoid this place. I've been here many of times. A lot with an alcoholic German ex-boyfriend (who loved the beer samplers) and the other times when my friends and I were craving a pizookie while shopping.  BJs does its theme well, which is, beer and an extensive menu. A place where groups are ideal, since there are a variety of options. Even the pickiest eaters are bound to find something they want.  I will speak about my experience last night.  Why in fucks sake did I come on a Friday night? I should have known better. It's like I had temporary Alzheimer's. After an hour wait, we were seated in a comfy booth. However the door opening and closing from the patio made it a quite chilly experience. The waitress greeted us and took our drink order. Since we have perused the menu during our hour wait, we were ready to order and get our hungry tummies filled ASAP.  I decided I wanted  variety of things. I ordered from the small bites menu. I ordered the chicken wontons (buffalo style), stuffed mushrooms, and mac n cheese.  So while we were sitting down, our waitress and her replacing waitress decided to talk about their schedule right in front of us. Meaning we had to stop our conversation so that the waitresses can continue their conversation regarding when she's taking her break or when she was leaving for the day. Ummm ok? She did apologize and honestly, its not a big deal. It was really awkward though.  I got my food. The mushrooms were cold and unremarkable. The wontons were pretty tasty and loved the buffalo style nature of it. Never knew Asian and New York American flavors go together. It was a fun dish.  Finally the mac n cheese. It didn't taste cheesy at all. It tasted like cold pasta with no sauce. It was sent back, the waitress happily obliged and took it off our bill.  We decided to share the trio pizookie dessert. Hot cookies and ice cream will never fail me. We had the macadamia nut, red velvet, and cookies and cream. Delicious, you can't go wrong. However, we received the bill prior to receiving our dessert. WAY PRIOR. It was just weird again. Then I noticed a bread plate going to our neighbors and I realized we never got our complimentary bread. Overall, the service was bust but unintentionally. They ladies were well meaning but just didn't have the training to provide good customer service. The food, meh. However I do still love their fish tacos (had them in previous visits) and the pizookie. Hence the three stars."
Barbara H.,"Los Gatos, CA",43,12,1,5.0,4/12/2015,"We had a blast. We sat outside and had the best server ever ...KADIE !! She was scheduled to leave at 2:00 but her replacement hadn't gotten there yet. She had a ""no worries"" attitude. The lemon drops were well made and the food was great. Chicken wings, lettuce wraps, sliders and avocado rolls were all delicious. We will be back !!"
Wade N.,"San Mateo, CA",0,45,,3.0,2/9/2016,"Standard BJ's. Burger's are pretty good. Nice family location if that's what you're going for, not always a quick meal though."
Reggie M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",23,18,1,5.0,6/26/2014,"I've been to many BJs before, this was by far the best! The food was incredible, best wings and mushroom appetizer I've ever had! It's like they had Ramsay working back there! The service was fast and extremely courteous despite being very busy. I just had to give these guys props! Is this for real?? Way to go!!"
Carl H.,"Arvada, CO",2,51,16,1.0,12/14/2014,The service was terrible. 10 minutes from when we sat down to being greeted. Another 10 for drink orders and finally 26 minutes and finally the first round. The server ES consistently slow and very sweaty for some reason. The food is bland and the food expensive. I would avoid this pit.
Kev I.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,4.0,4/8/2015,"Too Long, Didn't Read: we had a good experience and I would give this place 4 stars on service alone. I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to bring to attention the service these gents provided. I will come back when these 3 men are working. Thank you, Richard, Roddy, and Nereo. My friend and I had dinner to celebrate her birthday. I screwed up and didn't call 30 mins in advance like I was told to in order to have a shorter wait time upon arrival. The host(Richard) graciously helped me out and took care of everything despite the hassle I gave him(asking for ETA of a table for 2, thinking my friend would be late and giving up the table he'd given me, then sitting back down when she came on time). Props to him. Nereo was our server. He did the best he could what what he knew and had - I think he was a bit newer to the team. We weren't provided things that normally would be set already, but I understand he may be newer and looked a bit distressed. There was room for improvement for sure, but he courteously helped us out whenever we had requests. Our food was another story I wont' get into. Ordered 2 starters, and 2 entrees and had a couple things redone. It wasn't good and Nereo offered to ask the manager to speak with us. The manager(Roddy, I believe) was a nice man and asked us how our meal was, etc. He said he'd take care of it and ended up paying for the whole thing. I nearly flipped out because my entree was OK and was very resistant to the idea - he wouldn't budge though. Stand up guy. That's the service you'd expect at Alexander's or at Forbes Mill. Since we couldn't pay for the meal, I tipped Nereo about half of the bill because I felt bad for being picky(normal). This review is for the service alone, as I was a bit taken aback by the food(room temp and soggy calamari, bland&dry scampi pasta). My friend, the Bday girl is actually a really decent cook so we were saddened when the food didn't meet our standards or the other times we had frequented BJ's. Luckily, my friend's Pizookie didn't have sausage in it like a previous reviewer experienced.  All things said and done, we had a good experience and I would give this place 4 stars on service alone. I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to bring to attention the service these gents provided. I will come back when these 3 men are working. Thank you, Richard, Roddy, and Nereo."
Carol A.,"San Jose, CA",20,11,,1.0,12/28/2014,"Big disappointment. Service was extremely slow. Had to go to the bar to get our own water refills. Salads were all mini portions with hardly any dressing. When you spend $10.95 on a salad, would be nice if it filled the bowl that it's served in. But the waiters we had all pretty much ignored us, so we couldn't even get their attention to mention it. Sad."
Tara M.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,3.0,4/1/2014,"Food is always great here, nothing fancy but always tasty. i do not have a gluten allergy but their gluten free crust is absolutely delicious and I prefer it over the regular thich crust pizza they have. The drinks here are usually really sweet, I prefer to have a beer. They have a great beer selection.  I have to give only 3 stars however for the very slow service I have had repeatedly when coming here. One time i was seated by a host and was not greeted by a server for 22 min. I know this because I actually put a stop watch on with my friend as a joke to see how much longer it was going to take a server to notice we were there. I have been a server for years so I understand things can be crazy during lunch time, but 22 min was ridiculous. After a while one of the servers asked the host what was up with our table and insisted we werent his section, but in fact we were. After he apologized everythig else was great."
Ruben P.,"San Jose, CA",2,14,10,1.0,12/24/2014,The main reason we come to BJ's is for the beer and avocado egg rolls unfortunately they changed the recipe of the avocado eggrolls extremely spicy and I will never order them again from what the waiter said we are not the first to complain why change a good thing
Dena O.,"San Jose, CA",82,10,12,5.0,1/19/2015,My mom and I eat lunch at BJ's almost every Monday but decided to go have lunch there yesterday with my sister and niece. Even though it was packed do to the football games going on are server and food were amazing.
David H.,"San Jose, CA",82,96,52,2.0,5/1/2014,"Although service was great the other times i've been here, my most recent encounter with BJ's was not so great. It was around 9PM on a weekday and we were seated promptly. Our server Ernesto (If i recall) seemed like he did not like his job one bit. Upon greeting us...wait he didn't even greet us, he just gave us this death stare like ""i hate you and the world...let's just get this over with.""  My friends and I wanted Pizookies only, so we ordered two of them. I handed him my menu and he just forcefully grabbed it from me (talk about rude). After we received our pizookies he handed us our bill right away (we didn't even ask for it). I opened it and encountered a smiley face with a forced ""Thank You"" on it. It kind of reminds me of two girls hating each other but not admitting it in person, so they force themselves to greet one another with a fake ""Heyyyyyyyyyyyy gurlllllll you look good today."" ""Oh so do youuuuuuu, did you just cut your hair?!? WHO DID YOUR NAILS?!! WHOOOO""  Just kidding, that was a little bit over the line. If he thought we weren't going to tip, he was completely wrong. My friend is a server so he knows how tough servers have it.  Never judge someone based on their age or appearance. Just because we are struggling college students doesn't mean we won't leave a reasonable tip. Thanks for the great service Ernesto."
Kristel Dianne D.,"San Jose, CA",101,12,11,2.0,12/5/2012,"First of all, it took the waiter to take our order about 30mins since we sat down. Second of all, It took over an hour just to get our food. Third of all, our food was totally unsatisfactory. The pasta was totally dry and they didn't add the chicken or bread with our plate. It took us about 3 times just to get our dipping sauces for our fries. Never got our refills. We spent about 2.5 hours in there and it was horrible service. I understand it gets busy but I've been here on weekends and it's not even as busy as it was today. Overall the worst experience my friends and I have had. (This post is a year late, but oh well.)"
