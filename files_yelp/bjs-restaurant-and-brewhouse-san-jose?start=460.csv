Yelp R.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/8/2015,"Great food/drinks, horrible service. I've been to this BJs multiple times and have continued to recieve horrible service by the employees. Wait time, they'll say for example 20 minutes every time has ended up being an hour or more. Waiters/waitresses take a long time to come to your table after being seated. They also don't seem to know much about what's on their menu. Drinks/food take FOREVER to come out to your table. Basically you become frustrated by the time you get your food. Food and drinks are good but doesn't make up for the horrible quality of this restaurants service. Will not return"
Garry S.,"San Jose, CA",1,10,1,5.0,2/16/2015,"This place is great. Its Monday and it's my friends bday, we came for lunch and had such a great time we stayed longer. Food was perfect, drinks made the day. I recommend highly."
Emily V.,"San Jose, CA",91,14,37,2.0,1/12/2015,"I wouldn't come back here again. My burger was very dry, even though I ordered my burger medium well, and of course, I expected a juicy burger,and I got it very.  The service was alright. The waitress only visited our table three times; to get our order, give us one refill, and to get the bill."
Tom V.,"San Jose, CA",0,26,101,5.0,2/20/2013,This is one of our favorite places to eat as a family.  The atmosphere is fun and the service is great.  The kids like the food on the kids menu and the prices are reasonable.  Their Jeremiah Red beer is great beer and their buffalo pizza has a great little kick to it.   But what's best about this BJ's is their GLUTEN FREE food options!  My wife has Celiacs which means she has a fairly severe allergy to foods with wheat / gluten in it) so finding gluten free friendly restaurants with good food can be a task.  BJ's has an amazing GF pizza and also offere a GF version of their famous Pizzookie desert. There's typically a 15-30 min wait when we go Fri / Sat evening but that's what the adjacent mall is for.  We can't say enough great things about this BJs.  Keep up the great work guys!!!
Tako B.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,34,1,2.0,10/30/2013,"This place is a hit or miss. Mostly miss though. I always make the mistake by coming here to eat instead of grabbing a beer to watch a game.  On game days it's packed and often the service is lousy. The wait can last for 30 - an hour on busy nights. I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory if its busy then. The food is tastier and less salty than at Cheesecake Factory.  The problem with service is that you are often neglected. I've had a few waitresses end their shift in the middle of my meal without telling me. I have to flag down either the manager or another server to pay my bill.  Sometimes I go to the bar because the wait is too long but service there is the worst. When it gets busy sometimes you have to fight for your table which is exhausting and infuriating. And even when you get that table you dont even know if someone will come to serve you.  Last time I sat at the bar for a solid 20 minutes without getting any menus or any acknowledgement that I am there. And I'm sitting right in front of the bartender. He rather sell drinks than tell me to wait a few minutes. It was a pretty bad experience getting ignored like that especially when there were 2 bartenders. I got up and left and went to Cheesecake Factory where the service is a lot better.  Down to the food. If you look at the menu most of the entrees are 1400+ calories which is pretty steep. Cheesecake Factory is worse but this is pretty bad. Even the healthiest salad is 700 cal. But the food is good here and the beer selection is good so go early when it isn't as busy. if youre going healthy the ahi tuna salad is good. If you would like something more caloric then the piranha pale ale nachos, piranha pale ale burger are good. I also like the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. The other dishes are good too. I would avoid the pulled pork sandwich too salty for my taste. I tend to think their pizzas are way too dry. But a lot of people still get them. The pizookie is a must if you have enough room for your stomach and your wallet. All in all go when less busy."

Dang C.,"San Jose, CA",3,99,686,1.0,11/10/2014,"this place is horrible! HORRIBLE x 1000000 I went on a Saturday night and the wait wasn't too bad. I did the call ahead thing and it worked for us. got seated in 20+ mins and then the shitty part happens.  I had to ask my waiter 2x for lemon for my water. and I'm not mad about that, I understand it is Saturday and it's busy. we placed in our order and out came our appetizer + a bowl of clam chowder. one spoonful and I was in awe. it was so bloody SALTY i practically finished my cup full of water. DISGUSTING. i flagged down my waiter and told him the situation and had him take back the chowder and give me two servings of broccoli.  entrees began coming out and the steak with two servings of broccoli only came with one, the kale and brussels sprout salad had none of the sort (just romaine and grapes ... WTF?!), my shrimp scampi pasta tasted like plain noodles with shrimp, which I could have done at home myself for a lot cheaper.  then i told my waiter again, about my second serving, him coming back 3x to check if it had arrived which it did not and he having to go to the back himself to see what is going on. it is steamed broccoli, it shouldn't take that long. finally it came and it was just 3 pieces. THREE! if that is a serving, please just keep it. it was just ridiculous.  never again will I be back, especially to this location. this place is overpriced and it's not even worth it. I'd rather wait longer at Cheesecake Factory than waste my hard earned money on this place.  ZERO STARS IF I COULD!"
Richard N.,"San Jose, CA",174,239,,3.0,7/18/2010,"The All-American Meal ( for better or worse ), BJ's Brewhouse is the type of place someone might go for a meal after they graduate from McDonald's to Denny's and are ready for the next step. BJ's joins a long list of restaurants offering similar fare...at least in price and style...such as Applebee's, The Olive Garden, Chili's and California Pizza Kitchen, to name a few found in the San Jose area.  These ""mid-tier"" places are the backbone of our ""let's eat out and not spend too much"" economy.  Solid and value-oriented with a cheerfulness provided mostly by older teenagers and people working through college. BJ's on ""restaurant row"" in the Oakridge Shopping Center facing Blossom Hill Road fits that mold quite nicely.  The menu is a combination of what seems to sell the most...a little of this and that... with an emphasis on comfort food.  Nothing really strays far from ""down the middle"", but that's probably one of its major attractions.  There's enough variety for everybody in the group from a vegetarian to someone wishing to eat red meat til the blood rushes out your mouth. Quality of food at BJ's, based on several visits over the years, is probably a notch about its peers.  Of course, it all depends on your expectations.  When I consider going to BJ's, it best to check my hankering for fancy food at the door.  A little perspective goes a long way with any restaurant. Since my wife and I haven't had mead, except for chicken and a little turkey, for the past 20 years, we usually order chicken dishes or a veggie burger or salads.  Most everything is tasty, the right temperature and worth the price.  I'm a particular fan of the wedge cut fries.  Big pieces of potato, light-moderately fried and warm.  I even go lightly on the ketchup.  Now that's a compliment. But I must register a note of disappointment.  I usually order a ""wedge salad"" of iceburg lettuce and blue cheese dressing with my meal.  While I realize my eyesight is fading fast, I'd swear those salads are getting smaller.  Maybe they're just giving us a ""wedgie"" these days. Drinks of all sorts highlight many pages of the spiral bound menu.  Beers and martinis take center stage and I've tried most of the former ...though not all at the same time.  I haven't found my ideal combination of flavor, color and aftertaste, but BJ's usually has at least 8 of their own mixtures available so there's probably something for everyone.  There are also a number of ice teas and feedback from my wife has been good. Service is what you might call ""perky"".  I define that as upbeat and friendly which befits a restaurant of this type and age of the servers, both male and female.  If a fork is missing or extra napkins are needed, you'll get them ASAP with a smile. So far, BJ's is shaping up for 4 stars.  However, there are a couple of reasonable nits to pick.  For a restaurant of significant size, both inside and on the 2 sided patio, the restrooms should be larger.   After you've downed a couple of beers or ice teas, the last thing you want is to wait in line on a wet floor.  Maybe if customers had more ""room"" to put everything they'd be tempted to order another round. Another thing I've noticed on repeat visits is the tendency to let the waiting list grow despite the appearance of open tables.  I've seen tables stay empty for 10 minutes while people grumble by the reception area or sit on benches just outside the front door.  If that occurred once or twice, I'd say it's due to understaffing, but I've watched it many times. The last item may be a negative, depending on your viewpoint.  The average age of people at dinner is young...very young.  Of course you'll find the usual mix of families and couple, but the group that tilts the balance are packs ( not in a derogatory sense ) of teenagers.  They're generally well behaved, but if 3-5 kids with shopping bags in the next booth at dinnertime are not your cup of tea ( or beer ), it's something to consider.  And the room can get noisy from the bank of TVs on the walls, background music, waves of patrons and the lack of proper acoustics.  But again, maybe that's the way they want it. Like I said way back at the beginning, BJ's is the next rung on a ladder for the upwardly mobile..or for hungry people just looking for a middle of the road experience. Pros:   Reasonable food at reasonable prices with smiling service.  Lots of beer. Cons:   Lots of beer.  Small bathrooms.  Sometimes crowded with ""mall kids"".  Noisy. Ratings: -   Overall:      3 -   Food:          3 -   Service:      4 -   Atmosphere:   2 -   Facilities:   3 -   Parking:     3  ( big lots are often full )"
Craig I.,"Hayward, CA",318,59,64,4.0,10/19/2013,"This place is great. Great food all around. Prices are reasonable and overall a decent service experience. I usually try to get in around Happy Hour for the best prices on food and drinks, but from what I understand it is only at the bar area.  If you get here on a holiday or weekend around 7pm expect a solid wait. It just how it is at a big mall such as Oakridge. Personally I recommend the cajun pasta...I think it is bomb. If your going pizza I would say you got to try the Great White. Their baked potatoes are also pretty bomb, they are HUGE!"
Nichole L.,"Morgan Hill, CA",83,75,48,4.0,7/26/2013,"Oh...my...word!!!  The pizookies are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I got the sampler with Oreo, white chocolate raspberry, and red velvet!   I also got the buffalo burger which was pretty good, but nothing compares to those PIzookies!!!  :D"
Betty V.,"San Jose, CA",60,20,22,5.0,8/24/2013,The foods great and its the only place nearby where I can buy a pizookie when I'm craving for one!
Jossie L.,"San Jose, CA",57,43,127,4.0,7/15/2013,"Great food (deep-dish pizza, lots of delicious appetizers, pizooki for dessert), large menu selection...about this I can't complain... BUT, their customer service could really use some help. They're always busy, and the servers have a tendency to ignore you. And also, expect to wait for a while for them to take your order, and then a little more to start enjoying your meal. Nonetheless, I'll be back to keep enjoying their delicious food! Update: Even though we had to wait for a table, it was only about 15 minutes, not bad for a holiday. Our server Joey  was good, he was checking on us every once in a while, and he was really nice. This time around they've really improved their customer service. Our favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls, their deep dish pizza is really good, too! And the beer tasting, $6.95 to try 4 different brews, not bad at all, I'd say."
Candice T.,"Burlingame, CA",519,377,312,4.0,11/18/2012,"When I go to BJ's, it's usually for two things: giant baked potatoes and cider. This visit struck me as unusual for a couple of reasons. First of all, I looked over the menu and the first thing to catch my eye and grab me by the stomach was the prospect of mahi mahi. That delectable white fish will always make me do a double-take. And second of all, there were a few dishes that were vying for my attention. I settled on the mahi tacos. I loved their avacado salsa, but overall, the tacos could stand to have more fish in them. Boyfriend reported dry pork chops, while still very flavorful. I can attest to his delicious mashed potatoes myself.  I guess the final unusual piece of my visit came after dinner, when I had no leftovers to take home. I wasn't uncomfortably full, but I was certainly cleaning my plate and ""taste-testing"" my SO's sides. The take-away from this experience, therefore, is to order an appetizer with your mahi tacos if you're not a 115 pound girl."
Jeff S.,"San Jose, CA",16,39,5,4.0,11/13/2014,Chain food and good! Never had an issue with service or quality of food. My son loves their jambalaya. My wife had their chicken Parmesan and I had their burger. Good all the way around. Stuffed so no Pazooki this time!
Cossette P.,"Morgan Hill, CA",173,360,1743,4.0,10/26/2010,Came here with a group of friends for their 10pm Happy Hour.  It was pretty busy for a Thursday night.  I ordered the Mango Mojito which was pretty yummy.  I also had their version of Blue Moon which was surprisingly good.  For food we ordered several $5 mini pizzas...can't go wrong with those.  Mixed review on the service...the drinks came pretty quick but the pizzas took more than 20mins (after we asked for them) to come out.
Danielle P.,"Milpitas, CA",1,17,1,3.0,1/11/2015,"The food here is reasonable for a brew house and the beer is always top notch, but the customer service is hardly what you paid for. If Jeff is your server, you better plan on tipping big, because he's money hungry. Let me give you a tip Jeffrey- you want a good tip? Don't circle the suggested gratuity five times with your red pen and then deliberately forget to bring the birthday guest her promised dessert. The customer isn't always right; as a party of guests who work in the service industry, we know that. But providing seemingly genuine service and creating customers for life is so much more valuable in the long run than being a dick and expecting high returns."
Kylie T.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,4.0,1/28/2016,"Takes so long every time that I sit and consider never coming back as my tummy grumbles, but then the food comes out and I fall into a temporary coma and forget all the negative things I have ever thought in my state of hanger. This food is top notch and they are very nice if they get your order wrong. The pazookies are to die for, just make sure to order them as soon as your food comes out. Great place as long as you don't have movie tickets you need to get to quickly; let's just say this is a ""leisurely"" experience (be prepared to wait a while for the excellence). AND GET THE GOURMET MAC N CHEESE!"
Victoria M.,"Clearfield, UT",103,427,869,4.0,3/4/2013,"Call ahead, it's ALWAYS packed! Other than that - order the Calamari, Chicken Teriyaki w/ sauce on the side or the Parm Crusted Chicken - those are my favs!"
Laurie R.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,3,5.0,2/6/2015,My husband and I went yesterday for an early lunch and the service and food were both terrific.Gabriella was our waitress... She was fabulous!!! I have a broken leg and needed seating to accommodate me... They were very helpful.
Michelle N.,"San Jose, CA",13,32,4,4.0,6/3/2013,I came with two friends and we shared the California Club Pizza(which is big and delicious!) We asked the waitress for no bacon but she left it on hence why I took off a star.But we picked it off and it was still amazing.Also the Chicken noodle soup was super tasty and had huge noodles! And of course 5 starts for the Pizookie! Ohmy just the best!:]
