Jean F.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,,5.0,2/5/2015,"My husband and I both enjoyed our visit enormously. It was unhurried, our waitress was awesome, and the food and wine was excellent. Nice choice of food, wine and beers. Jean"
Isaac L.,"San Jose, CA",498,435,65,4.0,4/18/2013,"The wait isn't that bad, don't be deceived by the line.  It's just a small inside waiting area. The best trick here is the fried wings - order JUST the wings and sauce on the side.  bomb."
Thuy T.,"San Jose, CA",404,55,1375,1.0,5/4/2014,"I get that the restaurant gets busy on a Friday evening, but to mess up our orders consistently throughout the night is not an exception. My boyfriend and I arrived around 6pm and found out their happy hour was still going on. We decided to seat ourselves in the bar area and shortly after, we were greeted by our lovely waitress. If I could recall correctly, I had asked the waitress the different types of dressings that came with the salads and in return I got my options with some attitude. My boyfriend and I then ordered our two appetizers, a pizza, dessert, and drinks. One of our appetizers came out super quick so we were certainly happy with that. The pizza came out second and we were both curious as to where our second appetizers went? We immediately flagged down our waitress and she told us that she completely forgot to place the order. We also told her that we didn't get our water or beer yet. She apologized and vanished. After minutes and minutes, she was nowhere to be found so we went ahead and flagged down a worker nearby to assist us. When we finally got all of our food in front of us, I decided to jump on the wagon and try one of BJ's delicious happy hr margaritas. Flagged our waitress down, ordered, waited, waited, waited, waited...and guess what? My drink never came out... At this moment, I just wanted to pay and leave. We got our bill and my drink was never even ordered."
Ben C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",484,280,219,1.0,1/3/2013,"Super disappointing experience tonight ... - Long wait. - Bad service.  - Lukewarm food.  - Average quality.  Have been to BJs before and I enjoyed it, so not sure if this was just an off-night for them or unlucky table for us, but it was no fun.  Yo Yo"
Yv W.,"San Jose, CA",4,7,2,4.0,12/19/2014,"We had a great time here. The food was very good and the food potions are large. The environment is very entertaining and is great for big groups. The service was great and they were very kind and generous. It is pretty crowded and we had to wait for a while to be seated. Other than that, we had a great experience."
Vanessa X.,"Gilroy, CA",225,199,53,4.0,5/30/2012,"Went in for happy hour/snacks at 3pm after shopping & Amanda helped us. Loved her, she was literally running...busting ash!!  Impressive. ;)"
Melissa P.,"San Jose, CA",70,101,18,1.0,6/21/2014,"I've come here before but the last time I went was terrible. I ordered the lunch salad and pizza and my bf ordered the fried chicks and mash. I ordered bleu cheese with my salad and ended up getting low fat dressing. And my pizza was soggy and not like bj's deep dish pizza is known for. Also, my BF's meal was forgotten and came one hour after we ordered it. The only reason it got one star was that the manager came and comped our meal."
Deekay V.,"San Jose, CA",8,67,44,3.0,3/16/2013,"So we came back here again on a Saturday giving this place another try. (also because I got a gift card). But aside from that, we avoided the lunch rush and was seated immediately. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We decided to skip on appetizers this time to save room for desserts. More on that in a bit.  My brother and bf each had a burger and I ordered a California club flatbread pizza. Their burgers were beyond dry! Even the buns were toasted to the point of dryness. I didn't have any but man did it look dry. My brother couldn't finish it because he was choking on every bite and finally gave up. My flatbread on the other hand was pretty good. It had a nice crisp to it and the flavors were well balanced. So our lunch meal obviously had mixed reviews.  After that, we wanted some pizookies since I was craving them. We ordered the trio and chose white chocolate chip, red velvet, and white chocolate raspberry almond pizookies. Boy were they delicious! You have to have a piece the minute it arrives at your table. The ooey gooey softness of the cookie along with some cold ice cream, ooh they make your eyes roll. But if you let it cool for a while, everything will taste super sweet and it could get quite sickening. Trust me, even with three small pizookies, we had a hard time finishing those. Overall, the food was alright. We came here twice in the past year and twice had issues with our food. I probably won't be back here in a while since the food is mediocre (except the dessert!)"
Katherine N.,"San Jose, CA",289,151,161,4.0,3/4/2012,"Bf and I came here with some friends on a Saturday night. The wait time was suppose to be an hour...but it was actually an hour and then some. By the time we were seated, I could have ate the menu. After flip flopping between the balsamic chicken (my usual) or a pizza, my bf and I decided to split a medium Buffalo Chicken pizza. The portion was huge and we ended up having to box two slices home. (Turns out, what we really wanted to get was the BBQ Chicken pizza but I guess that gives us a reason to come back and try it some time in the future).  After our main courses, we decided to have a pizookie party!!! It has to be sacrilege to go to BJ's and not order their famous dessert. I don't know. I could probably make it at home but it would not taste the same.  My only complaint is that our waiter was slow when it came to refilling water. To be fair, I drink water like nobody's business. But still..."
Ajay P.,"San Jose, CA",61,6,2,5.0,8/28/2013,"Came here last night- avocado egg rolls were awesome. the pizza was delicious (half great white, half BJ's fav) and the servers went above and beyond. Just want to thank Joey for his awesome service and AJ for his help. I randomly asked if he played fantasy football because I was clueless and he totally helped me!.. who does that? it was awesome. BTW if youre reading this- i'm projected to win the league!! sweet!  Come here for good food and good advice. I'm a happy man"
The B.,"San Jose, CA",1,16,13,1.0,5/19/2012,"DON'T go to this restaurant if you have kid(s)!!!! My daughter was crying (hello! Kids cry, but my daughter cried because she bit her finger), some rude customer at the next table told my daughter to shut up... This is not why I am giving the restaurant 1 star... The manager had the nerve to come up to me and told me ""nicely"" to shut my kid up. Really?"
Amy D.,"San Jose, CA",186,16,21,3.0,2/8/2014,"Service: Our waitress was super nice and accomodating. She seated our group outside that day and asked if we were celebrating any special occasion, etc. Food: As for meals, I tried one of their handcrafted pizza and a cream soda. The pizza was alright, nothing special. As for their cream soda....ahem...I didn't like it. The beverage sounded so good on paper and turned out to be hell. It tasted lke cough medicine. So unless you're into that stuff, you probably won't like it either. I literally took a sip and pushed it aside. Thankfully, our waitress didn't put the cream soda on our tab since she noticed it was left unsipped for the most part. So there you have it folks, 3 stars for excellent customer service and decent pizza. Peace out!"
Aliscia N.,"San Jose, CA",51,43,10,4.0,3/29/2013,Came here for date night with my boyfriend and there was no wait because we chose to sit outside being that it wasn't too cold. I ordered the cream soda and scampi pasta. My boyfriend ordered the pink lemonade and new orleans jambalaya. We also got the ahi poke for our appetizer.  The ahi poke wasn't what I expected at all. The flavor of the wonton really overpowered the tuna and there were chunks of avocado. Overall it seemed to be lacking some flavor or a sauce.  The scampi pasta was delicious though! It was flavorful and the shrimp wasn't too overcooked or undercooked. I'll probably be getting it again :)  My boyfriends dish was also really good! A little bit too much butter for my liking but that can easily be fixed. It came with shrimp and chicken! Plus the rice was really well cooked.  Knocked a star off though for the ahi poke and the waitress who took waaaay too long to take our order. But overall this is a really good place for date night :)
Kathleen G.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/2/2015,"Food was ok.  Service was exceptionally slow.  Order of buffalo.wings didn't come with menu stated carrots and celery.   When I asked for them the waiter took seversl.minutes to bring them.  Only celery.  ""Out of carrots"".  Really?"
Carole M.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/2/2015,"We came out of the movie theater and decided to try BJ's because it was just a few doors down.  We had the best clam chowder...lots of clams and and the perfect creamy texture.  really good!  I had flatbread and salad...both were tasty and fresh.  My friend had the stuffed potato and clam chowder!  Too full for the pizookie we were planning to try.  We decided to come back the next time we came to Oakridge. We had to wait awhile.  They were very busy.  But it was the day after New Year's! Thought the prices were very reasonable too, especially for lunch."
Jamie F.,"Stockton, CA",4,27,9,4.0,8/2/2013,"Love bjs Been here many times, each time good  Favs: pot roast sandwich, magherita flatbread, deep dish cheese and tomato, chicken wings, watermelon and feta salad, THE ROOT BEER, (and I HATE root beer) the Bloody Mary, the blonde, the brunette, and the red head, oh yeah also the berry cider... The pizookie is good and so are their sauces and dressings; ranch hot sauce, balsamic vinaigrette, all that (i am super picky about sauces) Service is always the same, but don't sit on the patio after a long Friday night, it will get annoying trying to get a refill..."
Natalie K.,"San Jose, CA",3,13,36,1.0,4/2/2014,"Terrible service for such a restaurant.  We ordered steak and had to ask 3 times to different servers for ketchup and A1 sauce. By the time they brought us our sauce our food was cold.  I asked for a refill on my drink from a different server.  She took my drink and said ok.  Waiting around for 5-10 minutes she's walking around with no refill In her hand.  We ask her where our refill was and she responds with ""I'm not your server""  And I said ""well you should tell me to tell my server to get my refill"" This bitch responds with a fake ass ""oh I'm sorry"" every 2 seconds cutting me off with an oh I'm sorry oh I'm sorry.  Unfuckingbelievable. Never returning to this restaurant with disgusting service."
Crystal V.,"San Jose, CA",382,718,212,5.0,4/17/2012,"I love this place. The food and menu is always great and they are adding things each year which I love because I think subconsciously I stopped coming because I was so use to the food. The service is always stupendous, however, having worked in the food industry I give what I want and I am always extra nice. Try their beers, I personally do not like their new one they are advertising, and you can try it for free a little sample, or buy the sampler which is duh, all of the beers that they brew themselves. So you are bound to find a beer for you.  I can recommend tons of things to get but you should stop in and try what you like. I have been here the past two days on gf dates and they have AWESOME lunch deals with tons of stuff to get. They also have tons of pizookies to offer now!! I cannot try anything else other than the red velvet one, it is simply to die for! Definitely come in if you are a tourist and have never heard of BJ's lol because you will not regret it.  I have also been to and planned my own birthday dinner here and I really recommend just reserving, I cannot remember the amount that you have to reserve for and the max they allow before they make you do a buffet and have everyone pay a flat rate and they give you options, I honestly would not recommend the latter, just get your group ready, call it in and order whatever you all want separately NOT A BUFFET, and make sure your cheap friends have their monies lol.  Oh and speak up! If you do not like it or barely touched it because you are a new customer or tried something new and did not like the change, tell them and they will either get you something else and take it off your bill. They do care about their customers and want you full!"
Jeff P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",71,46,11,2.0,7/26/2013,"My Cobb salad was decent, when it finally arrived. The service was slow and very inattentive... They forgot to bring one of our drinks. Twice.  We finally had to get up and go get the waitress and tell her we needed refills and a dessert order. Very disappointing."
Bob J.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/18/2014,"I go to BJ's everytime and place orders to go.  I usually order Scampi in tray for the whole family.  When I ordered one this time, the cashier struggled how to ring the order.  It seems like he never got tray orders before.  He has to ask his supervisor how to do it.  When the order came in, the serving is only in 2 plates!  Not the usual tray.  This serving is only good for 2 people that cost $17 each and not the $61 for the tray. That's it for me at BJ's.  The amount of shrimps in the scampi is there but, this time, it lacks garlic, lemon, and bread crumbs. Lesson for me for today is ""Do not buy tray orders at BJ's"".  The employees there  knows nothing about it."
