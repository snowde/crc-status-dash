Jessica F.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,26,4.0,10/15/2014,"Not fantastic, but a decent place to have lunch. Their menu is extensive so anyone can find something they'd like to eat."
Kimberly D.,"Stockton, CA",2,43,1,1.0,7/20/2014,"I've been to this BJs multiple times before for work dinners but today while I was out on a date with my boyfriend the waiter took our order at 11:00am and our food didn't come out until 11:58 how long does it take to make a burger? Really?! When our food came out, it was all cold and soggy. It seemed like it was left in the heater for 20 mins. Walked up to the manager and told her the story and then left. The manager looked upset, but hey not our fault. Lost multiple customers."
Cristal C.,"San Jose, CA",1438,797,415,1.0,2/26/2012,Worst service ever! Went in for a lunch when I was super hungry and needing to nurse a hangover. Why did it take an hour to get a sandwich umm wtf and the server ignored my mom and me the entire time. On top of all that when we finally got the food it was cold...much rather go to the Cupertino location.
Judie Z.,"San Jose, CA",2,9,,5.0,6/2/2015,One if my favorite restaurants!  I love thatYour the only person I know who has any money.  they have several choices on their enlightened menu!!
Cat H.,"San Jose, CA",29,302,1,4.0,8/16/2015,"This is a change, so the food is consistent. The oak which location is always crowded, but if you can manage to get a seat the food is pretty good and the service is always good. The beers are OK, the desserts are good, the salads are delicious."
Christine L.,"Daly City, CA",115,431,509,2.0,1/2/2013,"I've been to other BJ's locations where the crowds are busier, the rooms are louder, and with no large group seating.   You would think this location can manage.  I have found this location can't. Our group (party of 7) had to wait two hours for seating, even with reservations.  Okay, we can understand the wait.  We are a large-ish group.  After an hour we started asking the status of our table.  They kept saying 'Soon' or '15 minutes'.  We were ready to leave until FINALLY, two hours later, we were seated. BJs is known for deep dish pizza, which is exactly what I ordered (a small mushroom).  I got full after two slices.  The beer was cold and took the edge off the hunger and long wait. +1 star because service was friendly, even though it was sparse.  It's a busy Saturday night so I can't really blame them for being overwhelmed.  I'm glad we just got to sit down and eat. Next time I'm ordering pizza to-go here.  Not worth the wait, even for the great beer they serve."
Martha T.,"Milpitas, CA",448,121,156,2.0,2/3/2010,"I think I just gained ten pounds after eating here yesterday.  My sister loves pizza, so she picked this place for her birthday dinner. For a party of 6, we started out with the combo appetizer. Blah!! I would NOT get this again. Their eggrolls are completely filled with avacado, the spinach dip was not up to par and it seems like everything else was soaked in oil. Be on the safe side and get the chicken wings instead.  For entree, we got the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo and shared a Large BJ's Favorite Pizza. Two entrees between the six of us was more then enough. We even got a to-go box because we had extra food. The birthday girl loved the pizza but it was average to everyone else at the table. As far as the Fettucini Alfredo, it seems like they purchased a jar of afredo sauce at the supermarket and poured it over the pasta. Nothing special at all.  The best part was the dessert. We got the trio Pizookie so we can try all the different cookies. They even gave us an extra one because it was my sister's bday. That was very nice of them :)  Unless you love pizza, I wouldn't bother coming here. If you must, make sure you have room for dessert because thats the best part of the whole meal.  FYI: there are no reservations, but you can call in half an hour before you plan on coming to put your name down. This saved us alot of time."
Brandon B.,"San Jose, CA",145,62,80,4.0,7/23/2014,"Our server was super friendly and all our food arived in less than 15 minutes. The BJ's brewed beers are awesome and their menu organizines them by darkness level. Try the panzooki, ours showed up fresh and melty; sooo good. This place is pretty good for what it is."
Krystle B.,"Sacramento, CA",14,61,25,3.0,9/4/2012,"It's mixed service when I come here. Sometimes the service is great, the food is delicious, and the waiter is friendly. But other times, the table is dirty so we ask for it to be cleaned off, and someone comes and does it half-butt.  At least we've never been forgotten about here."
Bobby L.,"San Jose, CA",425,562,131,3.0,1/22/2010,"Happy hour - $5 mini pizzas, 1/2 apps, -$1 off drinks? I enjoyed my hefenweiser along with my southwestern mini along with calamari here while watching several games going on the big screen. Calamari - overcooked/chewy , it left a batter-y taste in my mouth (ew), I like calamari, it's edible, but not great. Southwestern mini pizza - chipotle tomato sauce with spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes topped with fresh cilantro. I'm surprised how soft the dough is and that i was able to cut through it with just a butter knife.  The sauce didnt have any taste of chipotle.  The tomatos and chicken were good though.  Overall, it's cool, but lacking anything to wow me. Great White mini pizza - Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, fresh Roma tomatoes, Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast. If you're allergic to cheese or lactose intolerant, this is probably your choice in pizza.  Its like a pizza version of pasta alfredo.  The alfredo sauce was flavorful enough to match the pizza dough.  I like garlic, there wasn't enough for me though.   Come early if you want to get HH because the lines/wait got crazy after we got in. Need to try next time: Chili."
Dora M.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/15/2016,"I went in on 03/06/16, the restaurant was packed so we had to wait for a table for about 45 min. I told the hostess it was 3 adults and a child and they still managed to sit me at a table were the was no room for a high chair for my 1 year old I told the hostess this she just smirked and ignored me! The next hour and a half we would wait for food in the meanwhile my daughter could not sit still and banged her head on the table, I should of known better and asked again but I didn't want to be rude!! The reason we chose the place was b/c I wanted to try their pita tacos which I did not enjoy due to the Greek yogurt (my fault) anyway my husbands ribs and fries were pretty amazing and so was their P'zookie and the drinks. The waitress who I shall not name was really nice and went out of her way to please us always smiling though the place had calmed down after the basketball game ended. Once the check came around we owed $93.06 and I was debating on whether to leave a tip or not, we decided $5 will suffice for the waitress who even wrote Thank you! On our receipt. Well last night I noticed my final amount had posted on my bank and the total was $108.06 woah woah woah since when in $5 + $93.06= $108.06?????? Like did I miss something?? Anyway I contacted a manager last night he said he would follow up and he didn't so I called again today and spoke to another manager SHE CONFIRMED that my check had been altered!!! The tip went from $5 to $15!! The manager was friendly and I appreciate that but all she said was sorry???? Reallyyy?? Whomever altered took $10 without my consent and I'll I get is a sorry oh and of course a refund for my $10 I never authorized to be taken from my account? Where's the ownership? Where is the guarantee that it won't happen again to me or anyone else? I just don't understand? Is it my fault b/c I tipped so little? Someone please explain to me what happened!!! 1 star for the ribs and fries"
Liezl S.,"Orlando, FL",164,86,152,3.0,11/23/2010,"Fridays are busy of course... Was expecting a 45 min wait but a table opened up at the bar and was seated within 20 mins =) The waitress was average w her service.  The avocado eggrolls was not tasty, rather have cheesecake factory's. My bf ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was okie, had better. And I ordered the meatloaf sandwich and it was okie, a little salty for me. The mash potatoes were very plain, tasted like it was made out a box but the steamed veggies were good and the thin fries.  Overall: disappointed w the food. Cheesecake factory has better avocado eggrolls and mash potatoes. Service is average."
Erika T.,"San Jose, CA",4,16,2,5.0,1/16/2013,"been coming to BJs for sometime now generally on a Friday to enjoy a beer never really concentrated on the service because it was always just average. Last Friday i went with my boyfriend and had the most amazing server his name is Darnell GREAT energy, character just a GREAT waiter in general!  If you want to go to a place have some good food enjoy a nice cocktail I highly recommend you get seated with Darnell it will really take your experience to a whole other level! Again ASK for DARNELL"
L N.,"San Jose, CA",1,84,,2.0,8/23/2015,"I should have listened to a friend who warned me that BJ's had taken a turn for the worst.  She was right!  Two stars are for the pizookie (still tasty and served hot) and the friendly woman that seated us.  Other than that, it was an all-around 1-star experience.  Food was served shockingly cold, waiter was non-existent, and then same waiter overcharged us.  And you know a place is dirty when your own children point out how filthy the booths are - the corner ""ledges"" of the booth are covered in thick dust.  Ick."
Shabnam J.,"San Jose, CA",420,56,9,1.0,12/31/2013,"This place is a joke. When it first opened the food actually wasn't bad and I absolutely loved their deep dish pizzas. However, the quality has gone downhill the past couple of years. I went there last night to celebrate my brother's birthday with my family (his choice) and it honestly was a horrible dining experience. To start, the waiter took ages to take our order. But whatever, I let that go. Our appetizers come out which were fine, but with no plates. Umm how exactly are we supposed to eat the food without a plate? I'd rather not use the table as my own personal plate, thank you. Once the plates finally did come out (appetizers definitely weren't hot anymore) the waiter had to make 3 different trips because the plates he brought were dirty each time. What are the chances that 3 different trips result in dirty plates?? Can we say UNSANITARY?!? And to add to that he kept trying to clean them by scratching off the leftover food with his finger...god knows what they do in the back when the customer isn't looking. Once we finished our appetizers my mom's dinner (soup and salad) came out 10min before everyone else's food and she obviously waited for our dinner to come out so she had to send her soup back since it was cold now...who would've thought (no apologies either from the staff). Finally our food comes out (took much longer than any other restaurant that I've been to) and of course my plate is wrong. I had asked for the spaghetti with grilled chicken and add basil. Instead I get a regular spaghetti plate and another plate with the grilled chicken pasta and no basil to be found. Why in the world would I order 2 pasta dishes???? And to top that off, the waiter had came back to the table to confirm my order with me after he entered it into the system. Honestly how difficult is it to get an order right? Staff as a whole needs some major re-training. AND when the bus boy was giving us our dinner plates, he completely knocked over my mom's ice cold water glass all over her with one of the plates in his hand and he acted so cavalier about it that I was in complete awe. He pretty much acted like it was her fault for having her glass there. Hello, it's your job to learn how to put plates down without knocking things over! If you can't handle it, then bring out less plates at once rather than 5 large ones. I finally ended up getting my corrected plate and the quality was whatever. Chicken was good, but sauce tasted like it was from a can. We got the check at the end and of course the two pasta dishes were still on there. You would think the waiter would've gone in and corrected that. Complete lack of attention.  All in all, I'm never going back even if it's somebody else's choice. There is no point, especially since Cheesecake Factory is right there and their food is always good and service is much better. They also have a ""Skinny Menu"" that actually tastes good unlike BJ's low calorie menu. I've given this place way too many chances and have been disappointed every time the past 3 years."
Megan L.,"San Jose, CA",16,12,5,2.0,4/1/2013,"The food here is pretty good. However, if you plan on going here on a friday or saturday night, expect a long wait. Don't even bother trying to place a to-go order on a busy night! My parents love the food here, but every time I call to place an order I get left on hold-- last time I had to call 4 times and wait over 40 minutes to talk to someone at the take-out desk! Also, they will tell you that the order will be done in 20 minutes, and then when you show up 20 minutes later they will make you wait for another 40 before your order is ready! The workers are very polite, but it is still some of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had, repeated on many occasions. As I said previously-- pretty good food if you don't mind the wait, but SO not worth ordering for take out."
Ewa H.,"San Jose, CA",1,13,1,1.0,1/4/2012,"So my friends and I using our day off (Jan2)to get some bargains at the mall and had a craving for BJ's.  We love their appetizers and of course, the pizookie.  Who doesn't love the pizookie?  The wait was crazy, but we held out since we could see all the yummy food being served.  There were quite a few tables that were empty, but the wait was almost 45 mins to 1hr  for 3 people.  When we were finally seated, the wait staff was running like chickens with their heads cut off.  When our waiter came by to get our drink order, we asked him what was up. He said the manager didn't expect the restaurant to be so busy so they understaffed.  WOW.  I'm surprised that they didn't staff up on a day that most people have off from work. We order some fun martinis since we know we'll be at the mall for awhile, and start off with some appetizers.  Well, we are waiting... and waiting... for our drinks, but to no avail.  Our appetizers come, and once we are almost done with them, our drinks arrive!!  The bar is backed up... the waiter apologizes.  Okay, i get it.   No problem. But wow... almost 30 mins for drinks?!?! He comes to get our entree order (not sure why he waited till after we ate our appetizers) but I order my favorite, the sesame chicken salad.  Since it's the new year, I'm sticking to my new years resolution of not eating meat. So I order the salad with no chicken and potato skins with no bacon.  So when I've ordered dishes with no meat at other places, they either discount the dish by a few bucks or give you more veggies to compensate.  Ummm, not BJ's.  Of course, I understand the potato skins only have the bacon as a garnish, but the chicken salad has substantial chicken on it!  And the salad didn't come out bigger than usual... it was just the same size salad with no chicken!  For a salad that costs almost $12, I would think there would be some discount if it was ordered with no meat. I asked to see a manager, just to inquire about how they accommodate guests that don't eat meat and if there exists and type of discount for dishes that exclude meat.  The place was so busy that they didn't really care to get me a manager.  We paid the bill, but waited to talk to someone.  It was clear that I was a last priority.  They wanted the table since they were so backed up with guests, that we left without talking to anyone. I'm giving 1 star for bad customer service.  Essentially, it was the principle of the matter.  I don't care if the food is great and people are lined up to eat there, but if you treat your customers badly, it will essentially erode your feeling about the place.  It was just a series of customer service errors that makes me not want to go back."
Joshua M.,"Painted Post, NY",110,217,29,4.0,1/3/2013,"Who doesnt love BJ""s, honestly. Tasty beer, huge menu filled with tasty items and great staff. My only negative on BJ's is the wait, it's all about timing it right at this location. Hit then 20-30 min before the normal rush and you are golden, hit them during the rush and you'll get the 45-60 min wait... Anyway, I really enjoy BJ's, the menu is huge. Really is something for everyone, and they do a nice job on all the items I've tried. Tonight my wife and I shared the calamari appetizer, which was great. The calamari were cooked really well (not rubbery) and had a tasty batter. I also had a calzone and a beer which hit the spot while my wife enjoyed the chicken parm. On other trips to BJ's I've tried the burgers, chicken fingers, etc and always have been happy. If I had to classify BJ's I'd say gastropub chain and a little more."
Bill B.,"San Jose, CA",78,34,38,4.0,12/1/2010,"BJ's is hit or miss on some of their dishes, but has constancy on others. This is not a fine dining place, so check your pretentiousness at the door. People come here for beer, sports on the HD TVs and a TGI Friday's like atmosphere.  The micro-brew is okay. I am a fan of the Piranha Pale Ale. Rockbottom Brewery has better beer. I love that they try to add other hard to find beers on tap. For a while they had Arrogant Bastard on tap. Wow! Sure, not hard to get a bottle of it, but I have never seen it on tap anywhere else in the San Jose area. So, for beer: B/B+ The burgers are great! The burger melt is one of my favorite burgers around! It can get messy because the toasted sourdough bread can get too soggy and fall apart (I like ketchup, mustard and mayo so I make a messy burger).  The pizza is pretty good. Not the best pizza around, but still a B/B+ on most nights.  The ribs are good. Much better than Chili's ribs. Sure a true rib connoisseur  will scoff at the chain ribs, but there is no need for that. As far as chain ribs goes, these are also a B/B+. I love the California Chicken and Grilled Chicken Club sandwiches. My family loves the Pizookie for dessert. I swear that they have gotten smaller over the years, but I may be imagining it. Still worth ordering, but with parties of more than four or if you have big eaters, I suggest getting two. There was a point a year or so ago that BJ's consistently had a 90min or more wait at night. That's crazy. It is not worth a 90 minute wait. Still, worth an enjoyable night out with friends or family. I also recommend lunch at the bar. It is A-Okay. Update: I recently had the BJ's Hop Storm IPA and a bowl of chili. The IPA was quite good. They have different IPA recipes, so Hop Storm is not always on tap. The Chili was good, but Rockbottom Brewery has much better chili. BJ's was a bit on the thin side."
Courtney M.,"Killeen, TX",37,53,4,2.0,3/19/2013,"Came here for the first time in a long time. We ordered a pitch of beer, the first time both glasses had lettuce pieces in them. Then round two, one of the glasses still  had lettuce in it. Then the waiter had us pour the beer that was in the glass back into the pitcher!!! Third glass was clean, finally.  My husband went and spoke with the manager on duty at the time and came to our table aplozied for the problems and gave a new pitcher. Then when the food came finally came my husband burger was over cooked and I got the wrong sides. So finally when we got everything and it was right the meal was great!  I will return...it was over all a pretty good experience!"
