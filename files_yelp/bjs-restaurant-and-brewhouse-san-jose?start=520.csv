Justine B.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/17/2014,Great happy hour and good prices. They always have the games on and a nice enough staff. But the bathrooms are awful! The hosts and manager seem to think bathroom cleanliness is not important though which is not good.
Shaun H.,"Santa Teresa, San Jose, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/17/2014,"Service at the bar has really fallen since my last review, I initiated contact with the incoming bartender, amanda, with an empty glass and wasn't offered service. Very disappointed."
Byron L.,"Los Gatos, CA",74,868,137,3.0,6/16/2014,Scallop was tasty.  They could have been bigger and softer.  Dessert was super size made for big parties.  The high light for me was the beer.  They have Gulden Draak here.
Jenn N.,"San Jose, CA",431,240,32,4.0,2/24/2010,"This place brings back a lot of HS memories for me. I used to eat here for every birthday dinners or before any dance =) My favorite dish is the grilled chicken pasta & my bf loves their hot wings. I also love their PIZOOKIES-- chocolate chip cookie or brownie! YUMMY. It's soo simple, yet so good.  I have mixed feelings about their service. Sometimes, it's reaaally good & sometimes it SUCKS! If you do go here, I recommend making reservations because this place is always packed. It's a cool place for a date or group of friends if you wanna grab a bite & get drinks after too."
David L.,"Phoenix, AZ",170,327,1173,4.0,12/9/2011,Is it just me or is everyone here kinda good lookin. Stopped in for a brew and this place has plenty of them. And shrimp tacos. The wait was like 15 minutes not to bad. For a large restaurant this place packs them in. Looks like the one back home. TV's and a decent bar but it is solid packed also.  These people must be doing it right.
Kristie A.,"San Jose, CA",34,44,11,5.0,8/28/2014,"Phenomenal customer service. I had an error on a to-go order. I politely left feedback in the online form and got a very quick response from the manager! The food is consistently good, lots of variety, and I love the convenience of online ordering. Prices are reasonable/fair for what you get. The Rewards program is also good for frequent diners."
Kel C.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,3,1.0,4/17/2014,"After my friends and I spend over $100 for dinner and a drink we sat and began to enjoy our conversation until we were rudely asked to leave by the assistant manager. We were told there was a reservation for a group of 20 who were crowding the entrance. We were surprised to find that the entry was NOT crowded nor was there a ""group of 20"" in the entry. We will not be back."
Colin G.,"Gilroy, CA",0,20,2,3.0,9/29/2015,Ii got the Ahi Tuna salad . It's very good but not much bigger than a dinner salad.  Going to go home and have a sandwich
Tay S.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,5,1.0,11/22/2015,"So for the second time in two weeks I came to BJs to get treated like an interruption in someone's day. I sat in the bar area in a booth while watching two other patrons get acknowledged, tables bussed, orders taken, and served. The entire time no one even acknowledged that I was sitting there. Finally I had to call the restaurant on the phone and ask for the manager. I explained that this was the second time and raised my hand so she could see exactly where I was. Once the manager was finished working on whatever she was preoccupied with she came and spoke to me. I was pretty much feed up with the poor level of service and left."
Amy L.,"San Jose, CA",128,107,14,5.0,2/17/2012,"Been here many times but have never added a review.  This time between 2 of us we had potato skins, fried artichoke hearts, Italian chopped salad and a chicken BBQ pizza. Tried the red velvet beer, it's a mix of the berry burst cider & a dark beer, really good!! Oh & finally tried the choc chip pizookie, yum!!"
Nicole W.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/25/2015,"We called BJs to ask if there was a wait time because we had reservations at another restaurant but we had to wait 40 minutes. They told us there is NO WAIT so we cancelled our reservations for a place that was about a 2 minute walk away.  We arrived in BJs and were given a buzzer, we waited about 30/40 minutes went up and explained that we were told there was no wait and we have been waiting 30 minutes. They explained the table for us has people still sitting and we are waiting for them to leave. They have been here for 2 hours and should be leaving soon. So we waited another 15 minutes and still nothing. So we went up again and said something to the hostess right in front of who we believe was a manager and they said the same thing they said 15 minutes ago. Still they did nothing to accommodate us nor did they apologize. If they would have told us they had a 30 minute wait it would have been fine. But we were specifically told there was NO WAIT but yet in the end we waited over an hour until we decided we did not want to give them our business for there not so great service. Hopefully they don't treat other customers the way we were treated. Very unhappy with their service!"
Angeline H.,"San Jose, CA",1208,446,359,3.0,2/14/2012,"Since Yard House at Santana Row I haven't been here since. Happy hour isn't a good deal or anything. It's average. Not much to say because I left the place still hungry even though I ordered a pizza, two beers, lettuce wraps, and another entree that wasn't memerable."
Jason H.,"San Jose, CA",15,3,,4.0,3/2/2012,"Great staff, good food, and amazing service... and the manager (Zeke) is ON TOP OF IT!!   My wife and I finally got a night alone and decided to hit up BJ's.  The waiter was really nice as we placed our orders.  Unfortunately, when our food arrived, they immediately realized that my dinner was not what I had ordered.  (wife's meal was fine)  I had ordered the NY Steak with green beans and cheddar mashed.  What they gave me was Ribeye with green beans and baked potato.  No biggie, I would have eaten what they gave me, but getting an order right was the issue that they addressed right away... The waiter took my order back and Zeke came over to explain.  He said that there was a ""mix up"" in the back and that they would work on my correct order right away.  To help, he offered to take my order off the bill... AND offered us a free dessert of our choice.  He showed compassion, understanding, and most of all... he wanted to make sure we were happy... I used to be in the food biz and know that sometimes, things just get messed up.  (orders, drinks, spills, etc...)  But the manager at BJ's (Zeke) was AMAZING!  He really didn't have to offer us the discounts, but obviously believes in great customer service and lives like it's his own restaurant.   We will be back FOR SURE!!  Thanks Zeke!"
Sappho C.,"San Jose, CA",167,183,640,3.0,12/8/2011,"You can't go wrong with BJs, but when I moved to Gilroy and craved for BJ food, had to check out the closest one. Well, service was horrible! I agree with other yelpers, service sure was bad! We sat at the bar section and we did not see the waitress for at least 10 minutes. She finally got to us and told us to wait again. During our dinner, the waitress did not come check on us and we realized she went on break without letting us know. We also sat right by the kitchen, so you will keep hearing workers go ""CORNER!"" That got a bit annoying, but what can ya do?  I guess I will come back... when I miss their Parmesan crusted chicken or their deep dish pizza too much"
Cassie S.,"San Jose, CA",5,90,4,4.0,7/19/2014,We always sit at the bar food is fast. The Parmesan encrusted chicken is great. A good variety of original beers.
Jasmeen M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",126,72,3,5.0,6/26/2014,"My husband and I came here and everything was perfect. With the Premier Rewards card we got a free 6"" pizza and a free mini Pizzookie! We had the stuffed mushrooms, hot wings, and pizza and they were all perfect in terms of flavor! The service was amazing too. They were crowded but we got seated right away and got our food in a timely manner."
Alex J.,"Manteca, CA",26,1,,5.0,9/17/2015,"I had a fantastic time here yesterday. I was here for awhile and I am absolutely digging the new remodeling.It was a little busy yesterday but service was still great. The manger, Raina? was running around like crazy and doing everything! She even came by and greeted our table.Great food, great atmosphere and great people!!!"
Wendy B.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,1,1.0,1/2/2014,"I have never ever had such bad service from start to finish as I did at this particular BJ's... It's so sad too, cause we love BJ's, but I'm done. Unless we find another location we will NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS ONE! The host forgot we were there, gave us a broken pager and got upset when I asked her how much longer it would be after she'd said 20 mins, and everyone before and after us had sat down at their tables and it had been 40 mins of waiting. Then our server took out drink order and appetizer but never came back to take our entree order, then when he finally returns it's to inform us he's leaving and we have a new server. THIS SERVER SUCKS!!! Sorry, I know all about having a messed up day, and being off your game, I've served before, but wow! This guy seemed stoned!!! He never came back to refill my husbands drink, I had to stop him just to get our order in, didn't even serve our food! He never asked if our order was correct which it wasn't. I never ever call the floor  manager to complain, but I had to, I was so pissed off. It took an hour after sitting down to get our entrees because of this! We have 3 kids with us, if you have kids, you know they're usually on a short leash of patience.  The server was skinny (think Orlando bloom), with a pony tail, black hair and a barely there but trying hard mustache. If he's your server, RUN THE OTHER WAY, and ask for another section, if you must go there."
Keith S.,"San Jose, CA",3,28,2,1.0,11/6/2015,Never on time with pick up orders... I'm talking like way late. Even when they aren't busy.
Allen R.,"San Jose, CA",180,14,101,2.0,7/22/2013,"I worked retail in Oakridge Mall for a year and would commonly eat lunch at BJ's. I was attracted to the food selections, but progressively the taste and the service got worse and worse.  On numerous occasions our party would alert the waiter that we were on a 1 hour lunch, and on almost all of those occasions we wouldn't receive our food until after 40 minutes of being seated (while ordering within 5 minutes of arriving).  THE FOOD: I ordered the fried shrimp most often, and I always complained about either the fries being cold and/or the shrimp being cold and not fresh tasting. It got to the point where they'd ask if I wanted ""wedges"" or ""thin fries"" and I'd answer, ""whichever is hotter""... to which they'd stare blankly... to which after receiving my fries I would send back for hotter ones.   I like the watermelon feta salad the best. It is $2.99 and it tastes fresh.  The pizza is interesting... I've tried many, and they all taste good, not great, nothing to write home about.  SUMMARY: If you're coming to drink and chill with friends it is a good place to go as they have tons of drinks and the ambiance is nice. I do NOT reccomend this place to my friends, and I avoid it whenever given a choice between BJ's, Chili's, Fridays, Outback, etc.. If they improved the customer service and the wait time after the food is ordered, I would consider it an option because they have quite a selection of food to choose from."
