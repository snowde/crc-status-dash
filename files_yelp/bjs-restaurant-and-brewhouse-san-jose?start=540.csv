J S.,"Campbell, CA",10,48,26,5.0,9/16/2012,"Home of the world's best salad: BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad - order it pre-tossed with extra BBQ on the side. Salad should be a bit brownish for it to be divine. The onion strings are what separates this salad from CPK's.  Pizza is great too - love the crust. Fave is the Sweet Pig. Yummo.  The flat bread appetizers are pretty great as well, Margherita Fresca is probably my go-to."
Dung N.,"San Jose, CA",1420,485,304,4.0,10/15/2009,"As a starter, you have try the 'thai shrimp lettuce wraps'! The spicy Thai sauce is delish. The 'spinach and artichoke dip' is a hit-or-miss item.  The 'barbeque chicken pizza' here is alright, nothing to brag about. I usually order this when I can't make up my mind.  Thumbs UP on the 'shrimp scampi'. Thumbs DOWN on the 'grilled chicken' pasta. I recently tried the 'balsamic glazed chicken' and it was pretty good. The sauce was light but still rich in taste.  Great place for drinks and food. Great variety.  You can come here for a date or to hang out with friends. I'd come here for birthdays too because they give you a FREE scrumptious pizookie!"
Miranda C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",92,21,21,5.0,6/17/2014,"Always great service in the bar. Food & drinks arrive quickly.  They make a good bloody mary too, one of my favorites."
Tony L.,"San Jose, CA",290,37,32,4.0,10/15/2012,"This would mark my third time at BJs and feel like my more recent visits were best. The first time I went I was thinking the food was average but maybe it was what I chose. My recent visit was great! I have the Chicken Marsala, Piranha Pale Ale Chili, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, and a Wildberry Mojito. The chili was good but I felt it was a bit cold maybe due to the glob o sour cream put on on. Otherwise it was very good. The Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms were very good as well. This would make it the second time I've had it and as I recall, not as salty as it was the first time. The Chicken Marsala was pretty good. I just wish there was a bit more pasta. The majority of the dish was the chicken, the mushrooms, and green beans. I guess the green beans are there to make you feel less guilty about how many calories are in the dish :-). The Wildberry Mojito was very good but I wish the taste of mint of more prominent. Don't get me wrong, the drink tasted great and gave me a good buzz. Compared to other places though, it could have had a bit more mint taste. Overall my experience this time was great. Nothing was really overly salty or lacking taste from this recent visit so I will definitely return another time. I recommend this to others as I think they will enjoy this place."
Chase M.,"Salinas, CA",29,13,,1.0,6/14/2014,"Lemme start by saying the good was absolutely great burger, mozzarella sticks, drinks, pizza was ok. The service sucked! The guy was acting too cool for school and rude. When he was nice it was super fake. On the way out a waitress cuts us off and doesn't say excuse me or anything the hostesses were very polite but the waitresses and our waiter need an attitude check. Spending almost $100 you would think someone would get better service...guess again"
Katherine N.,"San Jose, CA",211,2,,4.0,8/17/2013,"Many individuals have high expectations from a restaurant in terms of the variety & quality of food, the service, & atmosphere. I, for one, have very high expectations when it comes to eating in a restaurant but at the same time am very understanding. Let's start with the service. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse contains many varieties of servers which will be randomly selected in accord to which table we sit in. We have to accept the fact that there will be good & bad servers which is apparent in every restaurant. Having one bad server does not define the whole quality of the restaurant because there are some pretty great & enthusiastic servers that we have to miss out on. Random selecting can be unfortunate sometimes. Fortunately, I had a decent, generous server who took our orders well & delivered our food & beverages quickly & gracefully. Yes, it was busy & the server didn't give as much attention towards us, but it's understandable. We weren't the only ones in the restaurant & I was glad that he showed how much he cared.  There are many varieties of food in the menu. It's like a novel! For the food, I ordered ahi poke for starters & a grilled atlantic salmon. Both of the food were FANTASTIC. The appetizer came out on time & although the salmon took a little bit longer than I thought, it was fine. I had a really good time eating with my friends. I would highly recommend any seafood dish at BJ's! At the end, we shared an oreo pizookie which was incredibly mouthwatering & tasty. It was my first time trying a pizookie, so I realize that I found my new craving! The atmosphere was beautiful. There are many diversities in the restaurant & everything was pretty clean & classy.  Overall, my experience was great. I would give it 4 stars! Expect me to come back hungry for more. :)"

William S.,"Milpitas, CA",747,350,52,3.0,2/24/2012,"Decent place, just not to my taste with the price. I love the avocado egg rolls and calamari appetizers. My son liked his food too, thing is though this place is a bit on the pricey side. I'll come here every now and then when I'm in the mood to spend some cash for some good american food. The wifey here loves their pazookies which is a desert type cookie topped with ice cream. I think it's pretty good, but the thing is i'm not a fan of sweets, but the wifey sure is a sucker for this dessert. I won't be surprised if this place is known for this dessert, if you mention pazookie to someone who has eaten at BJ's I'm sure they know exactly .what it is"
Ray K.,"San Jose, CA",503,34,19,4.0,7/22/2014,Always good food. Love the beer. My favorite is the Piranha Ale and I get it religiously. I am an ale sucker though so not sure about the others I didtn really give them a chance. Today we went and it took our server about 12 minutes to greet us which wasnt good but once she was there she made up for it with her charm and the food got out quickly.  I had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad and it knocked it outta the park. Such a big portion too I coulda brought it home for dinner.
Billy H.,"Rialto, CA",0,4,4,1.0,8/24/2014,This is the worst experience ever !!! I came with whole family for celebrated my auntie birthday . Our server was the worst one she brought out my shrimp Alfredo not the way I wanted my sister 's soup was wrong and pizza it was take forever. When I just got here I told the host please who ever our server let them know that my auntie 's birthday . came out nothing right plus we have been waiting so long . So i decided to tell the manger that I have my auntie birthday but nothing still come out . Over all it not good bj's to go. I love bj's but this location I never ever think to go back . Our server and manger suck.
Ben H.,"Los Banos, CA",50,18,8,2.0,8/13/2011,"Food is always good...service and management is a different story.  I recently reserved for a large group of about 20 people and requested the patio...it was a busy night at the office and only 8 where able to make it. About a hour into drinks with those that showed up, the manager came up to our table and very rudely told us that our reservation was only good for 2 hours. I do understand that not everyone showed up. But there are better ways to talk yo customers. We could easily condensed to one table.  Sadly this wasn't the first time i experienced poor customer service at this establishment. So BJ's gets a 2 star rating from me due to poor customer service."
Tiffany L.,"San Jose, CA",53,11,,1.0,6/18/2014,"I came in with a friend after not eating for the whole day. I was so happy to dig into my food and I finished, it was alright. Problem is I got food poisoning an hour later and have been barfing all night with the most painful stomach cramps ever... Even had to resort to going to the doctor because i felt so awful. I love the BJ's chain but, I'm definitely not coming back to this particular location after this incident because ick, things must be really gross in the kitchen if I felt that bad."
Marcia B.,"San Jose, CA",46,14,1,2.0,8/18/2015,"Happy hour prices and food ok, beer so so, but service in the bar always seems to suck at this location.  This time my pizza arrived cold,  I had to get up to go find someone to get napkin and silverware... and another beer! WTH?!!"
Lesley W.,"San Jose, CA",9,27,,1.0,10/10/2013,Waiting for over half an hour for a takeout salad is a little much for me.  Especially when they tell you it will be ten minutes and its 9:30 at night.  Getting someone's attention at the takeout counter is also pretty trying...
Shells M.,"Hayward, CA",106,145,142,4.0,9/27/2013,"Meduim pizza with 2 side salads AND a pazookie for 19.95! Great deal with plenty of food to take home for my bf and I. Great deal for a party of 2 or more, hope this deal lasts for a while :)"
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",2,3,,3.0,8/15/2014,"The food is great but the wait times are terrible. Both times I've been,  I spent twice the time waiting that they promised. Burgers are amazing."
Sunny W.,"Mountain View, CA",133,316,483,3.0,6/11/2012,"FOOD: not the biggest fan ATMOSPHERE and BAR: BIG fan I'm a pretty big foodie and thus more particular about my food.  I don't frequent many restaurant chains such as El Torito, Chili's, Red Robin, Marie Callendars, etc. I wouldn't really place BJs in that same category because of the nicer atmosphere, large bar area, and multiple large TVs, but its still not a place I would pick to have dinner.  I've been here a handful of times for dinner because of friends' pickings.  Upside is, I can usually find something that peaks my interest. So as prepared food goes, I'm not the biggest fan.  If you're a fan of DEEP DISH pizzas and have had them in Chicago, theirs might disappoint.   I am a fan of their bars and TVs.  I occasionally enjoy a bottle of cider and its nice that they carry them.  Some BJs only carry a PEAR cider, this one also offers a BERRY cider.  Make sure to carry your ID, they will ask. SERVICE:  Never had a bad time with a server. PARKING: Will be a little difficult.  It is located at a shopping center and you know the drill on mall parking lots.   LOVE the multiple TVs placed strategically around the restaurant."
Kristi D.,"San Jose, CA",83,230,2,2.0,6/14/2015,"My friend and I were very disappointed by this location. The host/?assistant host (a Hispanic or eastern Asian young man) did not great us when we came in. He ignored us for two minutes. Then he didn't want to give us high chairs, only boosters even though our babies are only 15 months and not ready for them. Finally another hostess (african american woman) who was slightly friendlier got us high chairs and sat us. Our waiter was okay but didn't give us silverware, we had to ask for it, and only gave it to one of us. He didn't ask if we were enjoying our food. He brought things pretty quickly including the check (which was a good thing). A man started cleaning the floor with a broom (our two babies threw a decent amount on the floor but it wasn't a huge mess), before we even had gotten up to leave or started to leave. We were very disappointed by this experience.  The hosts need to work on people skills and always offer people with babies high chairs, it shouldn't be an inconvenience to get one. The busboys should wait to clean up until after patrons have left the table."
Robert E.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/17/2015,"Trevor H. our server was very friendly welcoming and constantly updated us on our food and drink orders, asked about our food and was very helpful in suggesting food choices or explaining options for our meals"
Camille G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",17,52,24,1.0,12/2/2013,"My husband and I used to come here often before catching a movie. We used to love the food variety and I am obsessed with pizookies. We came here last Sunday and we expected a wait. It gets really busy here on weekends. We were given a buzzer and sat on the benches right outside the door. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, but after 25 minutes and watching people come after us and be seated before, we approached the counter and we were told that they called us already. I told them that the buzzer didn't go off. They said that they had been having trouble with them lately and that it's best for us to stay closeby so we can hear them call our name. She assumed we wandered off. There were probably 6 people sitting on the benches and there is NO way we wouldn't have noticed the door opening and our names being called. They didn't bother calling for us outside. So we get seated and it takes forever for our server to approach and ask about drinks, we were ready to order by then. We get our drinks and wait. Our salads are brought to us at the same time as our meal. I hate that, like I'm going to eat a salad while my dinner gets cold or something. So we decided to give them a second chance today. It's a Monday, not busy, service should be good. We get seated right away and our server comes up quickly. My drink is brought to the table and the glass is dirty with chunks of food stuck to the outside.  Our salad and soup STILL come at the same time as the food. The garlic bread is so hard I couldn't bite into it and there was a broccoli in my spaghetti.  I'm fed up at this point. No more B.J.s for us."
