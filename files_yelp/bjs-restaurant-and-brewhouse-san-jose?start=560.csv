Dawn D.,"Reno, NV",4,19,4,4.0,8/12/2014,"First time at BJ's. Wonderful food, very upbeat and clean dining area. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back!"
Kumar G.,"South Jordan, UT",10,173,984,5.0,8/20/2012,"always a favorite. nice taste. i would suggest people order more appetizers because they taste wonderful.  the best for chocolate fans is the ""BJS Pizookie"". ask for extra chocolate sauce in this dish."
ChowNut ..,"McLean, VA",2,375,2688,2.0,4/1/2012,"Pretty much your typical chain like TGIF, Bennigans, Applebees, Ruby Tuesday, etc. here. I had the french dip and the meat seemed overcooked.  I really didn't expect this to be a hand carved sandwich, but the meat looked unappealing.  I guess the highlight of the meal was the thin cut fries.  Had 2 beers, but didn't note any happy hour specials. It was a rainy day when I went, but the outdoor parking lot was still jam packed."
Clarkson J.,"South End, Charlotte, NC",5,1,,5.0,8/9/2015,"Past experiences have been frustrating. Late checks, food took forever. That being said I normally don't post reviews of places I didn't like. I happened to go back to BJs for a party tonight and was served by a gentleman by the name of Francisco. Now this guy was awesome. He was finishing up his long day with us, a group of about 12. I've never been served as well at this restaurant by anyone else. Francisco was super kind and accommodating and he deserves major recognition. Seriously."
Angie N.,"Mount Hamilton, CA",221,35,30,3.0,7/16/2013,"Service, both back and front of the house, is slower than that prehistoric dial-up.  Y'all ONLY gets props from me for that decadent Jeremiah Red Ale I'd love to wine, dine and then obligatorily bed passionately.  Share this info with your Baton Rouge, LA compadre because service is like the majestic unicorn to you both."
B. V.,"San Jose, CA",1,12,3,1.0,1/17/2012,"Food is ehhhh. I would never crave anything on the menu.  My last visit here, the waiter was nice but hey he was helping 5 girls on a night out! We did separate checks like we asked and when it came we left the card with the check to be picked up. All of a sudden this girl with a squeaky voice comes up and takes the check. Our waiter comes back and notices the tab was gone. Turns out the squeaky voice chick took the tab and rung it up under her and she got the tip. For about 30 mins we watch her yell at our nice waiter saying she rung it up on herself on accident. The managers got involved and had to try to fix our checks.  Not very professional to watch employees go at it for tip. We wanted to leave our original waiter a bigger tip but it looks like he got sent home"
Kristen A.,"San Jose, CA",166,27,,4.0,9/29/2014,I've never had a bad experience at this BJs. Once we got our food and didn't get silverware until 10 minutes later but the waiter apologized and made the rest of our experience pleasant. Can get busy on the weekends but they always seat us quickly and were in and out within an hour. Good place to catch a game or eat a delicious pazooki.
Jackie B.,"Oxnard, CA",25,66,26,4.0,3/5/2012,"The only problem I've ever had at this place was being overcharged, but that server had long since been fired.   Other than that, a great place to meet friends for a large meal and drinks.  It's always busy here = always loud.  Not a great first date site, but bring your party here.  I've had many birthdays here, and every one involved a yummy pazookie!  Pizza, salads, appetizers, plated dishes, drinks, and desserts; all delicious and decently priced.  The bartenders are partial to serving females first, but they won't water-down your drink.  You might find me here watching the Sharks games on Thursdays or NASCAR on Sundays and always with a smile. Mangi!"
Sondra M.,"San Jose, CA",7,144,48,5.0,7/30/2012,"My absolute favorite place to have food and booze.  They have a great happy hour.  $5 martinis on Monday, aka, the lemon drops, yummy.  The pizza are half off too.  The staff typically are very friendly and quick.  The food is yummy and I'm rather picky about food in general.  I would recommend this to my friends and have taken several out of town guest there for dinner.  It rocks!"
Paula G.,"San Jose, CA",185,166,7,4.0,11/7/2011,Drinks are yummolicious - I always get the double berry burst cider.  Make sure you say DOUBLE BERRY BURST because the regular isn't as good.  It looks like a beer and hits like one but girly enough for me to drink.     Their chardonnay pasta is scrumdiliumptious.  Their massive baked potato is to die for.  The great white pizza is super good and the wings are crispy like fried wings but enough sauce where they can call it buffalo wings. oh last but not the least... Pizoookie! Warm ice cream baked on a pizza pan served with an ice cream on top.  What are you doing still reading this... frikking go get one!
Michael B.,"Redwood City, CA",0,29,,1.0,10/5/2013,"Last night was an absolutely terrible experience at BJ's. It was date night with my daughter and we were looking forward to spending time together having dinner and shopping at the mall. I have been to several BJ's, the one near Apple Computer in Cupertino and the one in Sacramento which were both GREAT and was looking forward to my dinner at Oakridge. Instead, the entire experience from start to finish was terrible.  When we arrived the front counter informed us the wait would be 30-40 minutes. Being told that the buzzer would not reach past the Mac store inside the mall we were stuck hanging around in front of the restaurant. Finally, after 58 minutes we were seated. During our wait we continually checked with the front counter for updates and their response was always the same....two more parties in front of you and it will only be another 3-5 minutes....clearly, the folks working the reservation system did not know what they were doing. Once seated we were excited to eat. Unfortunately, it wasn't for another 15 minutes that the waitress actually came to our table. On multiple occasions she stopped by to say she would be right back to take our order but never actually did. Finally, after the long wait she took our order...and then the long wait began. In fairness to the wait staff, my daughters soup and salad came within a reasonable amount of time but, unfortunately, her tomato bisque soup was stone cold. Sending it back we waited another 5 minutes before it was heated so I asked my daughter to start her meal while I waited for my fried chicken to arrive....and I waited and I waited and I waited.... 20 minutes later my chicken arrived. My heart sank when I looked at the entrée as the dish wasn't really fried chicken but a chicken fried steak. To make things worse the presentation looked like the chicken had fallen out of the sky into a cornfield sending the corn kernel out of the husk and splattering them all over my dish. It was hideous.  By this point I was thoroughly disgusted and asked to see the manager. 5 minutes later I spoke with him...he was nice enough...and I explained my problem. His response was that he asked me to forgive the terrible experience as everyone in the restaurant was new and getting trained. He said he had been brought over from the Infinite Circle BJ's to straighten things out but that he knew they were having problems. In a kind gesture he comped the cost of my meal....6.95...but by then the night had been lost. By the time it was over...well after 10:00... the mall stores had closed and I lost my chance to finish the date with my daughter. We left for Starbuck's and a Frappuccino which is always done right and then came home. Do yourself a favor....stay away from the Oakridge BJ's as you will be very disappointed. Their other locations are always spot on and I'm sure this one will be as well.....but like my wait outside....it will take a lot longer than they will tell you."
Kristin V.,"Campbell, CA",192,133,27,3.0,8/10/2011,I'm mixed about this place. I love it for some drinks and food with friends. It's great. Poozkie is DELISH!  What I don't like: always crowded and loud. You can't hear anything. Always a line to wait. Big party? Forget it. After being a loyal customer for years I tried to book a party of 20 for my husband's birthday here. We were told we could only be there during certain hours (no good party times) and we have a 2 hour maximum time and then we had to clear out. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! You are telling me you don't want 20 people ordering drinks all night. That's what people do when they CELEBRATE birthdays at a BREWERY.  This place still has good drinking food and good drinks...the question is do you have the patience to wait for a seat?
S G.,"San Jose, CA",0,48,,1.0,2/17/2013,"This was our first & will be our last visit to this restaurant.  Not a kid friendly place. had ordered mac & cheese with lemonade for my daughter. When the plate arrived it looked out of the fridge reheated in the microwave, My daughter took one bite & ended up eating mine & hubby's food.  We asked our waiter bout it & he said he will check with the chef. Came back with the answer that it's out of the fridge & was microwaved , Really !! Is that the standard of these restaurants so low.. I would say do not waste your hard earned money at this place."
Alice H.,"San Jose, CA",2,6,,5.0,5/30/2015,"Get Real People!  This place has great food, great prices! If your starving- get quick fast food!  This place has atmosphere- the hostesses are sweet, young and eager to please! Com'on people! Every one has their first days at their jobs.  How about a little respect for those young workers and new cooks!  We are so spoiled that we think we should be served liked The Ritz!!!  All good restaurants have long wait time for a reason- because we all want to eat there!!! Haha. Remember what your Momma taught you- 'do unto others as you want done to your self'"
Germana M.,"San Jose, CA",8,21,15,1.0,6/27/2014,"Usually we always get good service there even when they're busy but today, we were seated and 2 other couples were seated after us and got service and after 20 min, no waiter or waitress, I was ready to walk out even after asking the host who is our waiter or waitress cuz no one has come by. Yeah, I was not happy and those 2 other couples got their food already. I was like WTF??? 2 more min, we would have left.  And we got there around 530pm."
Carlos B.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,1,1.0,6/27/2014,So I went there to have lunch with my mother today Friday 6/ 27 2014 and it was around 4:30 p.m. And we ate outside and the rudest part was that everybody that was coming in or waiting for send them to be seated they started smoking outside and basically all the smoke from the tobacco dealers in the face and my son my 10 month old son was basically smiling the whole time ago I let the waiter know she said she's going to speak to the manager and nothing was done because when the couple came out they started smoking again which is really really rude and whoever you was smokin it I don't know your name or anything but you're at your an a****** and it should be a no smoking sign with in like 25 to 30 feet from the freaking restaurant
Lisa F.,"San Jose, CA",2,15,,4.0,1/3/2012,"You can never go wrong with BJ's. Came here a few nights ago with my boyfriend. We got seated outside which I was happy about until we were leaving. Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because by the end of our meal, they had seated a party of almost 25 people directly behind my boyfriend. They were so loud, It was to the point where I could barely hear him talking from across they table. As I was finishing my dinner, we had a 'lovely' view of some guys ass a foot away from our faces! There was also about three other tables of 2 or 3 people. If you know you're seating a huge party outside, don't seat smaller parties near them.  Other than that, the food was great and our waiter did a great job getting our food correct and checking in on us."
Destiny N.,"San Jose, CA",111,23,14,2.0,12/10/2013,"Bad service! Silverware wasn't clean, both me and my sister's untencils were dirty. Food was decent. Wait for our dessert took FOREVER, even got our order wrong. I only reccommend this place for their pazookies, there the best."
Loren C.,"Miami, FL",322,67,72,2.0,7/21/2013,"Usually my friends and I will just pop in for a late night pizookie, or a baked potato, and the food is decent. The service has never been exceptionally good here, but we never really minded. Sometimes the wait is long, and other times you get seated right away. It really just depends on what time you get there. The worst experience I had there was when my boyfriend and I were out on a date. We both ordered appetizers, and they came pretty quickly. I had the fried artichoke hearts, which were decent, although not something I'll ever go back for, and he had the mozzarella sticks. They weren't anything special either. Both appetizers were pretty bland, and such a waste of money. For our main course I ordered a grilled salmon Caesar salad, and this is where things went bad. It took them an incredibly long time to bring out our food, much longer than it should have. When it was brought out to me, it was more like a stack of lettuce than a salad. There was literally no dressing on 2/3rds of my salad! I could pick up a scoop of lettuce with my bare hands and no dressing would get on me at all. I asked our waiter for extra dressing, but I only got it after I had decided to stop eating. The reason that I stopped eating my ""salad"" was because I was continuously finding brown pieces of wilting lettuce throughout my salad. At first I attributed the brown pieces to being rubbed up against my grilled salmon, but I found a large number of pieces of ROTTING lettuce buried at the bottom of my salad on the opposite end of my plate from my salmon fillet. It was disgusting that they would serve rotten food like it was nothing! I found the head of the lettuce, rotten, thrown into my salad as well! I wondered if they had put all the throw away pieces on a plate and mistaken it for my salad... Needless to say, I was thoroughly disgusted and couldn't continue eating it. We pointed it out to the waiter and asked to speak with the manager about it. The manager took a while to come out and speak with us, but she apologized for the wait and thanked us for being patient, and offered us a replacement salad, or anything else off of the menu. I declined, because I was too grossed out to eat anything else from their kitchen. She removed the charge from our bill, and was very kind about the whole situation, which we appreciated.  Needless to say, we will not be returning for anything other than a pizookie in the future."
Jeanne K.,"San Jose, CA",2,9,,1.0,1/11/2015,I would give this no stars if I could.  Worst experience using their preferred wait list feature on the APP.   We put in our name using the APP.  It confirmed our name was on the wait list and wait time was 60 minutes.  Arrived at BJ's 45 minutes later and checked in.  Was told that our wait time begins the time you check in.  We were on a list but the clock begins when we arrive.  So it would be another 45 to 60 minute wait for a table.  So why offer this feature if it's a lie?  I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed but we were there for my birthday dinner.   I said to the host that if I had known this was going to happen I would have gone somewhere else. He then said maybe we should go to another restaurant.  Really?   No customer service.   Will not be going back anytime soon.   Thank you BJ's Brewhouse for spoiling our evening.
