Rebekah C.,"San Jose, CA",44,7,1,1.0,6/14/2015,"We came to this BJ's a few weeks ago and we thought we would get good service since there wasn't a wait and not all the tables were filled but the host said we would still have to wait 15 minutes?! So we asked if we could sit at the bar and the host said yes those are first come first serve. So we found a table sat down and maybe 5 minutes goes by and they brought us a menu and asked us for our drink orders. The guy took our order and walked off. We sat there for 20 MINUTES and no drinks. We never saw the waiter even come out, so we left and went to California Pizza Kitchen. We attempted this place again today and the host again said there would be a 15 minute wait. So 25 minutes goes by and we walk back in to see if.our table was ready the host said 5 more minutes and we would be next. We waited 10 more minutes and I said forget it and we left. This used to be our favorite restaurant at oakridge mall but this is just unacceptable. Service has gone down dramatically in the last 6 months.  Management really needs to make some big changes because based upon other reviews our experience is not unique."
KD L.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,1,3.0,12/31/2013,"Recently, their service has really started to lack, although they have some great things on their menu, it would help if you could get someone to take your order. This used to be a regular for me but ever since it's taken me 20 minutes just to get my drink it hasn't been worth it and I don't want to waste my time to wait on people to bring me my order. Other than that, their food is good and they have a great variety of drinks to choose from."
My N.,"Hayward, CA",217,61,19,2.0,11/13/2011,Horrible experience last night.  The waitress (Wendy) took AT LEAST 15 minutes just to ask us if we wanted something to drink. By which time we've already decided on appetizers as well. Let's just say the WHOLE night was a lot of waiting on our waitress.. Ordered a Cajun Pasta with Chicken AND Shrimp. Somehow the waitress entered Cajun Pasta with Salmon (WTF?!) the first time and Cajun Pasta with Shrimp ONLY the second time (with undercooked pasta bc according to the waitress she rushed the kitchen). I don't think I could've been more clear with the order. I DO NOT have an accent but apparently the waitress has issues hearing. Needless to say we didn't want to send the food back a third time because (1) we were hungry & tired and (2) we didn't want angry spit in our food. You best bet that Wendy didn't get the generous tip we originally set out to give her! I will NEVER return to this location. Food quality sucked compared to the other locations and for our trouble SOMETHING should have been comped.
Mojdeh C.,"San Jose, CA",189,85,7,1.0,8/16/2011,"This is the absolute worst service I have ever received at any restaurant ever! After we got sat we waited for about ten minutes to have our server, or atleast have someone give us menu's... but no apparently that was too much to ask. My boyfriend had to go ask a server to serve us, and she told our server who a couple minutes later came back to take our order. I ordered the steak and a baked potato and asked if i could also get vegetables on the side. The manager came by about 15 minutes later and informed me that they were out of that steak and he could get me another type... that's fine. So our server drops our food at the table and leaves, not even noticing that we had no silver ware. After waiting for a few minutes we got up and got our own. Then i notice my vegetables are not on the side but INSIDE my baked potato!!! What is that???? Anyways, the steak was decent and the pizza my boyfriend ordered was fine, but nothing special. My boyfriend had to flag down our server to ask him to refill his diet coke... which was never brought back to the table. Finally we asked for the check and our server, who im surprised has a job never came by to pick up the check and just left us sitting there. My boyfriend had to go up to the register and ask him to run our card.  I have now had this server twice, and both times he has been horrible. I will never ever come back here again."
Lizz S.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,3.0,11/6/2012,"I have been here several times and it seems every time the experience gets worse and worse.  The first time was probably tinged with nostalgia and that whole ""new"" feeling so it was very memorable. I had the meatloaf and couldn't finish it because there was just too much! Their appetizers are also fantastic (Avocado egg rolls) and I highly recommend the Ahi Poke if you are adventurous and don't mind a little ""sushi"" exposure. I don't think I need to mention their Pizookie which is pretty good considering I'm not really a sweets fan. I have tried the ""trio"" Pizookie which is three personal Pizookies that are perfect for sharing. You can pick and choose which variety you like. I had the Macadamia nut, Peanut Butter and Red Velvet cake ones. Out of those I probably wouldn't mind returning just for the Macadamia nut.  The reason for my three stars is due to service errors. I know we are all human and make mistakes but the waitress really should have read back our order to us so we were sure what she had written down, just so there is no miscommunication."
Chelsea H.,"San Jose, CA",0,21,,4.0,1/6/2013,"Came here the other night for dinner with the family. Called ahead and was told the wait was 45 minutes. Not bad for a Saturday night when a playoff game is on, right? Wrong. Got there and was told it was going to be another hour and 15 minutes. Kind of annoying since we called ahead, but luckily we were able to snag a table in the bar so it turned out ok. It was happy hour so we ordered a few appetizers and salads. Potato Skins and Wings are pretty good. Love their mozzarella and tomato salad on their small bites menu. Very light and refreshing! Instead of my usual soup and salad combo (they don't have Minestroni soup on Saturdays anymore, boo :( ), for dinner I ordered a mini Classic Combo deep dish pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and stewed tomatoes). The wrong pizza came out the first time but the waiter got it fixed really quickly which was nice. Everyone else in my party really enjoyed their food.  We also ordered a chocolate chip pizookie and a mini triple chocolate pizookie both of which were really good! Will definitely be back! :)"
Allison F.,"Cupertino, CA",16,17,1,1.0,11/21/2013,"Waited 45 minutes for a table. Got sat then waited another 8 minutes to be greeted. Took our order and then waited another 7 minutes for just our drinks. My son's soup and salad came before our appetizers. Then the appetizers came and the food runner said our potato skins was flatbread. Lol. So robotic and then she even got it wrong. At least 20 minutes went by, never saw our server after she dropped our drinks. Then she appeared but just to tell us she was going on break. At 9:00 pm? So then we got our main course. Never saw the replacement server. He then reappears but by this time we wanted our check and boxes. That took a looooong time too. Over two hours for dinner on a Thursday night and left feeling I should've saved the $70.00 and ate at home."
Juan L.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,4.0,6/6/2014,Pizookies always satisfies service 8\10 is good most days I get great service here and there ill have a bad waiter check on my refill once he gives me the tab. Regardless I would recommend it one of my favorites in oakridge!
Cas D.,"San Jose, CA",1,15,3,3.0,7/6/2015,"the food is okay  i wish they had more choices in what you can order . The service is always okay too, but non the less its a good spot for lunch and a great beer."
Timothy T.,"Morgan Hill, CA",3,33,14,1.0,5/3/2014,This place has been talked up. Well let me tell you. They are wrong. Its a nice place with great atmosphere.  Me and the wife were seated very fast for how busy it was and thats were the service ended. We ordered our drinks and some fryed artichok hearts. 13 minutes late they bring out the atichoke hearts. Our server at this point has not been seen at all and still no drinks. 16 minutes go by. My wife gos to manager. the server shows up. With our drinks 25 minutes after we got there. So we order our food. 45 more minutes go by. We get it. Looks good. My burger tasted burnt. At this point it was time to go. Paid and left. Will never go back. Horrible service horrible food. Not a good first impression.
Chia C.,"San Jose, CA",22,78,,4.0,8/26/2011,"BJs is a nice American chain restaurant, probably a step up from Applebees or Chili's and a step lateral from Cheesecake Factory (geared toward pizza, wings, and beer instead). The food is always great.  Their chicken wings are among the best you can get.  Crispy, large, juicy, a very good hot sauce on the side.  The potato skins are deep fried, the sliders are very good, the microbrew is excellent.  The deep dish pizza always has a great crust with a slight crisp, yet chewy/soft on the inside with great toppings. Get a pazookie if you've never had one.  I'm partial to the Oreo pazookie.  It is a half-baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream. The wait at this location is always long (connected to Oarkridge mall) and the service is hit and miss.  One time we went and they were out of wings (what??) and they have messed up our pizza order more than once, though corrected it and even gave us a free pizza once! I go back to BJs only when I get those cravings.  Otherwise, trying to sit down and eat casually or at a whim can be frustrating because of service and wait."
Tarlon K.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,6,3.0,7/2/2014,service is super important for me and they're terribly slow. I don't come here often because i don't like to wait over an hour for a burger. food quality and staff are both very good. pazookis are an ultimate favorite
Lana V.,"San Jose, CA",2,33,,1.0,4/28/2014,"Better in the restaurant.  I ordered online, which was very easy, for delivery.  The food was lukewarm and not very good. The avocado rolls were soggy and fell apart. The pasta was tasteless and needed more sauce. The shrimp were small and rubbery.  The garlic bread was crouton hard. Won't be doing this again."
Dave I.,"San Jose, CA",16,10,,5.0,6/23/2014,Went there last night with a few friends. Food was fantastic and the server although new to job did his best. I would always choose BJ's as a place for a dinner with friends because they are consistent with atmosphere and food quality.
Dan H.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,4,,2.0,9/1/2013,"Had to  wait to be seated, then the hostess  almost gave are seat to a party that came in after us.finally got are seat went to sit down and noticed large amount of liquid on the seat I wiped it down before sitting down . then order an appetizer they dropped it off with no  additional plates the plates came  five minutes after the appetizer . i opened my menu and the pages stuck together my wife gave me her menu and it had food stuck all over it . the only reason this place gets two stars is the food was good . dirty and bad service ."
Vee L.,"San Jose, CA",558,267,127,4.0,7/23/2013,"I love coming here for late night dinners. Happy hour is decent for food (I don't drink, so I can't tell you how the HH drinks are). Mini pizzas are super cheap and filling! I've never been unsatisfied with any I've ordered here, except for the temperatures of my steaks, but that's not big deal. Every server I've had here has always been friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable of the menu. I even got a free pizookie before because our server forgot our waters!"
Tram B.,"San Jose, CA",11,21,5,4.0,3/7/2014,"I always go here with my sisters when we have something to celebrate. The mood is very lively and the outdoor seating is very elegant. We love their potato skins and pazookies! You also get a free one if it's your birthday :). Their strawberry lemonade is also very tasty. The wait is long, so I recommend making reservations ahead of time."
Stephanie B.,"South San Francisco, CA",229,330,168,3.0,9/18/2011,"TIP: Make a reservation if you're heading here for dinner, especially if you have a larger than 6 party! It gets CROWDED. So save yourself the long wait. OR, you can do the long wait, and they'll page you. It's a 15 yard radius (no lie, I have no idea how far that is), but just letting you know in case you're good with your measurements.  I started the night with the Brewhouse Blonde - very light, refreshing, and kinda fruity. Probably your GF's favorite beer. I'd order this again, but then again, I'm a girly beer girl.  As for the food, I went knife & fork sandwich for the first time. What an interesting concept! Got the Angus Pot Roast Sandwich, which came with mashed potatoes, celery, carrots, raw onions, pot roast, and toasted garlic French bread. Drenched with so much gravy, it was pretty fulfilling! Fab combo. AND so much mashed potatoes! YUMM I LOVE POTATOES! I appreciated the generous amount of veggies, though the presentation was EH. Then again, it's BJs....how could I expect beautiful plating?  Standard, average, reliable, just AIGHT overall."
Anna D.,"San Jose, CA",82,75,29,4.0,1/22/2012,"The first time I ate here was with friends for their birthdays. They had our table when we arrived and we didn't have to wait as long. Our waiter Lou was so nice! We all think he did his job very well. He served us, gave us good advice on what food to eat, and he absolutely did his best to satisfy his customers. The food was very good. I enjoyed it and the prices were very reasonable."
nichelle n.,"San Jose, CA",3,4,,1.0,5/15/2011,"I never really liked this location. Something bad always seems to happen whenever I eat here. MOST, but not all, waiters and waitresses are inattentive, management blows, food is exceptional, but overall, this place doesn't even deserve any stars at all. Hire more intelligent staff who can actually take care of its guests. Eek! MeDOESthink not. Our reservation for my friend's birthday celebration was canceled because we were half an hour late when we were clearly there within the given time frame. We let that go and waited patiently for another table; out in the patio. We were finally seated and ordered our meal. It took about 5 minutes to get our drinks. 10 to get my salad.  And an hour or so to get our food. No bueno. I'm sorry but your restaurant wasn't even packed to have such lousy service. We didn't receive our silverware until what seemed like hours later, and we had to bother our waitress countless times before it actually went through her head that I couldn't eat a salad without a fork. Thank you for making my appetizer very enjoyable to eat. My croutons were soggy to the core!! You think I was happy with this?  So our waitress, Vanessa, roamed the patio and checked up on another table when she was clearly assigned to ours and didn't seem to show interest in serving us. After complaining to your manager about your ridiculous service and him having the nerve to hand us the bill was just a no no.Thank you for ruining my friends birthday celebration. An apology from you and your manager isn't going to turn our night around. You should just quit and go back to school. OH! I almost forgot. Vanessa doesn't check ID when you buy alcohol. Look for an airy head walking around in a pony tail if you want drinks, my underaged friends :D Thank you BJs Oakridge, you have taught us a wonderful lesson never to waste our time and money on crappy service such as yours. I appreciate you giving your name to us, VANESSA. :) One star because the house root beer is and always will be delicious."
