Samson W.,"Milpitas, CA",36,642,285,3.0,12/27/2015,"My first time eating at the Oakridge Mall location.  The only reason why I chose B.J.'s is because I did not have a good experience at Buca Di Beppo.  Also, Cheesecake Factory was a little packed. I ordered the breakfast pizza.  Pretty good with eggs and bacon. I also had to have coffee as it is a very cold day.  Too cold for late December here in the Silicon Valley.  Good coffee. Yes, not kidding. The service is the only thing that is a hit or miss.  The waitress provides good service one minute and not so good the next minute.  Took a little too long to bring me a refill on coffee. I would not mind coming again or visiting their other location.  Other than their Cupertino location, which is not a good location at all as it is on the Apple main campus."
Mariah G.,"Gilroy, CA",13,3,1,1.0,8/24/2017,The service sucks here. Our waiter was constantly preoccupied with a table that he was obviously friends with. We were waiting on him for everything instead of him being attentive to our needs as customers. The foods not that great to be ignored until we went above and beyond to get his attention.
Crystal O.,"San Jose, CA",8,3,2,5.0,10/4/2016,"Always love coming to Bjs! The pazookies are absolutely delicious and an all time classic. And of course you can't come to Bjs without ordering one of their famous brews (if you're of age of course). Our server Biagio L. Was awesome, he was super attentive and made great recommendations.  One thing I would complain about would be the patio being kind of chilly, but they did have heaters so it kind of balanced out.  Overall great experience, I'll definitely be coming back!"
Tiffanie A.,"Los Gatos, CA",89,194,265,3.0,8/2/2016,"This place is ok. My first 2 experiences that happened 3-7 years ago were really bad. Between me getting sick from their food one time, to all dirty dishes and a long ass hair in our dip the other time. BJs was a solid zero stars for me.  It's up to a 3 because we went the other day (only because my husband got a gift card there from someone).  I was dreading it but it ended up being fine. I didn't get sick, we didn't find any hairs, dishes/silverware/glasses were clean, service improved, and food was edible.  Is this the best place ever? No.  But If we ever get a gift card here again, I won't be afraid to go anymore lol"
Theresa M.,"San Jose, CA",143,128,96,5.0,7/25/2017,"It's been sometime since I've been to BJ's but the last two times in a month has been extraordinary! I'm in love with their PM Porter and Bourdon Stout. I wish they sold them outside the restaurant, and yes I've asked. Foods wonderful too. They've added so much since the last time I've been there and he healthy alternatives are delicious."
Jade S.,"San Jose, CA",3,13,,3.0,3/13/2017,"Came here on a Friday night to eat before our movie at Oakridge theaters. My boyfriend and I were starving and were really just trying to find the place with the fastest wait time. We walked in and the host said 45 minutes for a table. We were about to try PF Changs when another hostess said a booth in the bar had just opened up. Awesome, thank you miss lady! We ordered  -Hopstrom IPA -their double IPA, don't remember the name -Bone in chicken wings -New Orleans Jambalaya  -Spicy peanut chicken with Soba noodles  Beer was great! We both enjoyed. Chicken wings were amazing! Super crunchy and spicy. Huge sizes of drum and wings too. Our entrees were just blah. I have been to BJs once before and I remember my food being blah too.  Service was amazing though. I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was working the bar and had great eyebrows! :P. She was on top of everything. Food came out hot, she checked on us regularly and when my boyfriend said we had to catch a movie she brought the check out right away. We figure if we ever come back we will just get chicken wings and drinks."
nicole c.,"San Jose, CA",109,40,,5.0,6/17/2017,"Cesar was amazing!!! We have come here quite often but the service we received from Cesar made me want to leave a review! Cesar was on top of everything, drinks, food and just plain awesome!! Thank you Cesar for a great experience!!!"
Sony S.,"San Jose, CA",7,7,13,3.0,6/1/2017,I ordered a salad today and it tasted so bad...  like it might have been expired. 3 stars because I've been here before and it was pretty good the last times.
Natalie N.,"San Jose, CA",582,8,8,5.0,11/11/2016,"My experience here actually has gotten a lot better than the times I've gone before! Called in to add my name to the waitlist, and they were actually able to! AUTOMATIC STAR. When we walked in they said our name wasn't on the list. Luckily, my boyfriend remembered the hosts name who picked up so we got sat right away. Thank god. We ordered the spinach dip, buffalo chicken ranch pizza and the buffalo/root beer glazed wings. The root beer glaze actually does taste like root beer. Very unique and def should try. Nothing was wrong with any of the dishes! The service from Cesar, I believe, was attentive. Of course we had to finish off with the delicious pizookie!"
Alex K.,"San Francisco, CA",9,23,1,1.0,8/8/2017,"This BJs is the slowest and disgusting ones in the area. I had a party of 5, which the host said would be 45 mins - 1 hr wait. Not only did an hour past, but they also forgot about our party in general. The quality of food is garbage and the service was beyond pathetic. I understand I shouldn't have high hopes for a restaurant at a mall, but holy balls this place sucks! Our table decided to pay up front because we didn't want to tip the waitress for how rudely and lazy she was during the night. Keep in mind that it wasn't a busy night. There was hardly anyone dining that evening. Straight up trash."
Candice T.,"San Jose, CA",203,181,987,3.0,11/4/2015,"I've been to BJ's many times before and this is one of my go to restaurants. I enjoy coming here not only for the food but also their beers. I've listed a few items that I've had in the past. So far everything was good except for what I had just recently. I ordered the *NEW North Beach Mahi & Shrimp. I must say I didn't quite enjoy this meal because there's so much going on with regards to the herbs and spices they put. First of all, I HATE capers and if only I knew then I would have asked them to not put any. The capers, kalamata olives, fennel and anise seeds overpowers the mahi and the shrimp. Sadly, I did not enjoy my meal! I just won't order it again! Appetizers: (recommend) Spinach and artichoke dip Crispy calamari Crisp potato skins platter California club flatbread pizza (good) My usuals in terms of entrées: Balsamic glazed chicken Grilled Pork Chops BJ's handcrafted beers and cider: Tatonka Stout Berry Burst cider"
Julia H.,"San Jose, CA",85,148,327,3.0,1/27/2017,"I wasn't sure if I should give this place three or four stars. If it were based on the ribeye alone then I would say four, but I want to factor in the service and other foods. The ribeye was excellent. The sandwich we ordered was not that great and it didn't look very appetizing either. The service could have been better. We had to wave down someone to help us. I really don't like having to try too hard to be noticed when I sit down at a restaurant. Nothing else really stands out about this restaurant. I really only like coming here to socialize with my friends."
Kaylee S.,"San Jose, CA",1,58,6,1.0,8/13/2017,This place has gone so far downhill. It isn't even enjoyable anymore. The food is blah and the customer service is way worse. I wouldn't recommend this play to anyone anymore. The only good thing about this place is their pizookies.
Bryan D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",55,1,,5.0,8/20/2017,"Great Location. Took the family out for a pre-college celebration and ended up with a hilarious and quick server. Kadie made our dinner a great experience and kept us entertained with jokes and great food. Haven't found a better BJs since, definitely will come back for more great times"
Brianna S.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,5,5.0,5/27/2017,Jaime was amazing! Super friendly and patient. He even walked my grandmother to the door. She usually always has a complaint but not this time. Thanks Jaime !!
Jennifer P.,"San Jose, CA",21,53,,4.0,7/17/2017,We used to come here weekly for date night.  We moved away but decided to go back last week. We were pleasantly surprised to see some of the same faces. They changed the way food goes out and gave their waiters computers so they didn't not have to walk back and wait to put in the order. The food came out really fast. Great experience for not being able to go for a few months.
Destinie Z.,"San Jose, CA",409,546,527,4.0,5/19/2016,"I've had many birthday dinners/lunches/happy hours here at this BJ's and never had a bad experience. Staff is always friendly and goes out of their way to assist.  Pizza and burgers are good here as well as the thin cut fries. Spicy spaghetti was my former favorite item, but they changed the recipe and I don't care for it much anymore. I really do wish I remembered the name of our last server because he was amazing! Our bill came out to $30 for two vodka drinks and sandwiches and we tipped him $20 because he was an absolute rockstar when it came to service."
J B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",12,399,38,4.0,7/3/2017,The pizza was still good and the server named darryl a tall young colored cool guy was an outstanding waiter. The owner should give this guy a raise in pay and let him teach others how to serve.
Justin B.,"Palo Alto, CA",18,8,10,1.0,5/24/2017,"Long time customer of BJ's Restaurants in Northern California. Beer selection is wide and their own beers are very high in quality. My most recent few visits to this location have been satisfactory but, I had stared to notice that the bartenders here give preferential treatment to customers from what I overhear are employees at several surrounding restaurants. P.F. Changs, Bucca Di Beppo to name a few. Well It seems that my needs fall on the back end of those work nearby. I watched several bartenders (both Caucasian looking males) interact with said customers by giving out shooters and beers to them, while every time I asked for another beverage my receipt was immediately updated but it seemed that the local employees were getting freebee after freebee. Which to me doesn't look great when I feel that I spend enough money there not to be included in this generosity. Regardless the interaction with my bartender (Randy C.) was minimal and felt disingenuous. In short I didn't enjoy watching this happen and will recommend others avoid the bar top unless they work in the same field in the surrounding area. Maybe then free-bees will come their way too."
Lacey C.,"Santa Clara, CA",10,12,9,4.0,2/6/2017,"Me and my hubby often go here for dessert. We like to keep it simple and stick to a chocolate chip pazzokie. 90% of the time they come out perfect. Nice warm and gooey and not burned. We usually get in and out within 20 mins and service is always good.  He grabbed a burger during happy hour the last time he went and he said he like it. The burger was juicey and a good size for only $6. The fries were also good, hot and crispy, I stole a few and they got my approval.  We have gone to other BJs and we like their pizzas too, you can't go wrong really."
