Mike O.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,1,5.0,5/8/2015,Great Pizza. Amazing customer service. loved the pizza so much delicious.
Aly A.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,6,5.0,7/13/2014,Went there last nite and the service  was great !! Our waiter Adam was really nice and  the manger came out to greet everyone and to let me know that my pizza was a lil late and she was taking off the bill with out me  even me saying anything  !! Great service !!
Bobby L.,"San Jose, CA",1104,511,510,3.0,4/22/2009,"I went here during Friday happy hour with an old friend of mine.     Can't really complain about the service, the $2 off appetizers deal, and the attractive bar setting.    Nachos were plentiful.   The $5 mini pizza was just alright.   Spinach and artichoke dip was better (served with a flavorful bruschetta).     Their award-winning Tatonka Stout and Jeremiah Red (for $1 off each pint) weren't bad, but were not amazing either.   Their famous Pizookie will remain the most memorable.  I wanted more of this freshly-baked deep-dish cookie (pie) with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.  We ordered a half chocolate chunk and half white chocolate macadamia nut cookie.  It's made to order, so it took a while, but well worth the wait."
Jim O.,"Gilroy, CA",0,48,,2.0,5/4/2014,"I've been to BJ's several times. I keep trying to like the place, and they keep doing crap to thwart my good intentions. Today it was a boneless wings appetizer. From a choice of several glazes/sauces, I selected the sweet honey/Teriyaki glaze, because ALL of the other choices were described as hot or spicy. When this appetizer came, there were so many red pepper flakes in the glaze that it was inedible.  I understand why bars serve hot spicy food -- it helps them sell more beer. (It's the same reason that popcorn at the ball park is too salty -- it helps them sell more beer.) And while I don't like spicy foods, any restaurant is free to serve all the hot, spicy dishes they want to. But when I order something that's listed as a ""sweet honey Teriyaki"" glaze, and its principal characteristic is that it burns the hell out of my mouth., that is not acceptable.  I guess no matter how much I like the concept and the atmosphere, I just have to resign myself to the fact that if I ever go back to BJ's again, either this location or any other location, I'll just end up mad at myself for being so gullible. So I won't go back."
Drew P.,"Millersville, MD",12,33,23,3.0,8/28/2011,"Good food, but not amazing. Would definitely come back for beer selection and fried artichoke. They were awesome and the garlic lemon aioli was very good. Not over powering but added really nice flavor to the mix.  Next time I'll probably just come for appetizers and beer. I've only tried salads and burgers, so the rest of the menu could be good. Beer: I had the 4 amber and dark sampler. The porter and red were awesome, the other 2 were ok.  I would take home a growler of the porter or red anyday!"
Amarie S.,"San Jose, CA",3,86,54,2.0,9/2/2013,"Great for happy hour, food is hit or miss though... We often wait a really long time to get our food too. Over priced. Good beer. I'd come for happy hour but that's about it. P.s. parking sucks!"
Hai N.,"San Jose, CA",43,20,2,1.0,3/8/2014,"Terrible service and would not include this restaurant as one of my options anymore. Got seated later than estimated because the employee didn't notice there was an open table that was meant for us. After 10 minutes of being seated, my party was not assigned a server until we notified one of them. Stay home and make your own pizookie."
Michael J.,"Santa Clara, CA",1,6,,4.0,12/23/2012,"I always get their pot roast, very tender goes perfectly with the mushroom gravy sauce and mashed potatoes. Every time I look at the menu, I want to try one of the salmon specialty entrees but the price tag keeps pushing me toward the pot roast. Service is usually not too bad but during busy hours, its a 100% shit show.  All that is forgiven though when I get that amazing pazookie. ;)"
Borneo M.,"San Jose, CA",0,48,50,1.0,9/10/2011,"Me and a group of coworkers were planning to have dinner here. I couldn't get a reservation since the reservation can only be made for group of 10 or more. But I was told that I could call in to have my name put on the wait list 45 mins prior. So on the day I called in and a guy took my name. To my surprise and disappointment, when we arrived there we were told that they didn't have my name on the wait list. They said they'll get us a table in 20 mins. So we waited but half hour passed. We ended up going next door to PF Chang. SO BEWARE ! If you're going to call to have your name put on the wait list. Make sure you remember who you talked to so you could hold that person accountable if they don't have your name later on."
Blck R.,"Fremont, CA",13,124,363,5.0,2/17/2012,"Besides not having my Chicken Marsala, the greeters at this place are the best that I've come across in a long time. Susie, Alexa and Sam...the best of the best. Kudos to all three. Great job ladies Five Trans Fats out of Five..."
Kevin K.,"Middletown, PA",4,44,25,4.0,7/9/2013,"I love BJ's Brewhouse (if you've been to one, you've been to them all). I got the Mahi Mahi tacos and it was delicious. Nice, light meal, not heavy in any way. Great place with nice beer selection (their pear ale is awesome!). Highly recommended."
Krissy S.,"San Jose, CA",173,225,77,4.0,2/11/2009,"What's a guys favorite thing to hear?  BJ's!  ahahaha.. well I have to admit I'm a fan of the place myself ;) I have recently discovered their tomato bisque soup which is amazing! and they put their big ol' croutons on top too...  Their deep dish pizzas are beyond good and go great with their beer of course... which goes along with another saying I know... hehe...  My weapon of choice is their Brewhouse Blonde, I like a lighter beer and this one does the trick...  I always get either their grilled chicken pasta with blackened chicken or their fettuccini alfredo with the blackened chicken... if you haven't figured it out yet I'm partial to the blackened chicken....  Their sandwiches are great too, they have a couple different varieties of chicken sandwiches and turkey sandwiches.  They have great pot roast that is sooooo tender and you can even get that in a sandwich if you choose...  Their chili is made with their Piranha ale and is to die for... you can get it on nachos, a massive potato, or even an open faced sandwich...  they have a honey crisp chicken salad that is huge!  It has chicken strips, corn, egg, and mounds of lettuce with their honey mustard dressing...  and I absolutely cannot leave out the pizookie!!  It's a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie platter of goodness with vanilla ice cream slowly melting on top!  Oh my god... the melty chocolate chips with the just out of the ovenness.... mmmmmmmm! So this is the place with.... pizza, beer, & BJs... mwahaha don't pass it up!"
Maxim L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,6,,4.0,4/25/2015,"I had a great dining experience at this restaurant. It is a sports bar so it is loud and the wait times to be seated can be long in peak hours. But think about it: sports bars are loud and it is GOOD that the wait times are long, the wait times prove not only that the food is of good quality but also that people would wait just to eat here. That is actually a good thing. This means it is worth it. From my own view, this restaurant deserves a 4 star rating only because of the noise. I personally prefer restaurants a tad bit quieter but, again, I picked a sports bar which are generally louder than other restaurants. Otherwise, the experience was great. The decor was top notch, the food was delicious (by the way, you need to eat their pizookie), and our waiter was the best waiter I have literally ever had the pleasure of meeting. His name was Austin, and I believe he deserves a gold medal because the restaurant was horribly packed especially since it was a Friday night and he was still working with a smile on his face. He was kind and prompt with our order (especially mine because I was in a big rush). My food was ready and on the table in about 20 minutes. That's pretty good in my book. Plus, the taste is just WOW! Especially their burger and their pizookie. Seriously, try the pizookie. As you may have noticed I was impressed with the pizookie since I keep mentioning it. Try this place! But I wouldn't suggest it for romantic dinners, too much noise. If you are with a group of friends however? Oh yeah, go full out! Enjoy it! :)"
L L.,"San Jose, CA",1,77,11,1.0,6/5/2012,"Placed my curbside order at 12 for a 4pm pickup. Didn't realize how cold my food felt until I got home. It definitely felt like it was made hours in advance.  Also...""would you like to add a salad to your entree?"" Yes, and all I got a SINGLE piece of salad in this ""Small Bite"" salad. Plenty of tomato and mozzarella cheese luckily."
Ryan C.,"Los Gatos, CA",8,19,,2.0,11/16/2011,"It brings me no joy to right this review.  I have been a die hard BJ's customer since 1996.  I have been to BJ's in Fullerton, Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Roseville, Folsom, Cupertino, Elk Grove, Portland (Oregon),  and a few others I can't remember.  I love this place, the food, and in the past the service.  This review is only for the Blossom Hill location.   I have consistently eaten there at least 1 time a week for almost 2 years. Food---Great Beer---Great...side note...anyplace that has enough confidence to put their own beers side by side with competitors, got my vote Pizookie---smaller than it used to be but still phenomenal Service---sucks First red flag---a lot of new faces Callin reservation (or whatever they call it)---frequently of late, I call in and when I get there, my name is not on the list.  The last time we called in the person on the phone said there was no wait so don't worry about.  Got there 20 minutes later...50 minute wait.  We went to PF Changs.  Bar--- usually has the best servers.  It is the most coveted positions as far as the wait staff goes.  Bar wait staff used to consistently get a 5 star from me...now at 2.5 stars.  Once in awhile...I get better service.  Used to never have to ask for things like beer refill, now I have to ask for silverware, refills,  some plates have warm food some have cold food...sometimes servers do not show up for 15 minutes or more. Main room servers---In the last 6 months...rarely, I mean rarely have I received good service here.  One of the servers made my wife and I  feel like we were putting him out just sitting in his section.  The pathetic part about this area is that unless BJ's has changed their policy, servers in this area only have 4 TABLES AT A TIME! Takeout---Last Saturday, 3:30pm (not the busiest time of day).  On hold for literally 8.5 minutes to place order.  Placed order and told them I was parked outside so just bring the food out when it is ready (curbside service).   20 minutes later I called to remind them about the fact that I was outside (3yr old asleep in car) and they said it was almost ready.  6 more minutes food arrives cold!  This is at 3:30-4pm not the craziest time of day for these people. In the end I blame the management.  I know they have at least one new manager.  Management sets the tone.  If it was not for the fact I have been eating at BJ's for the last 15 years...I would have stopped coming along time ago.  I have friend that had such poor service in the bar last week that he and his wife are never going back.  His experience was that it was 3:30pmish with a lot of wait staff around, almost empty restaurant , and the worst service ever.  Table didn't get cleared for 15minutes, 20 minutes before even receiving menus, food cold on arrival after waiting what seemed to be too long. Not sure how to end this except to say I am sad."
Eric B.,"San Jose, CA",1,3,,1.0,5/23/2015,Hostess service is always hit and miss. Forgetting to call names and wait times not matching estimates at all.
Chris C.,"San Diego, CA",3,217,45,2.0,2/7/2015,"Boo. Very cold and dry calamari that obviously sat too long. Expensive cocktails that tasted like they didn't have a drop of alcohol. Inconsistent service. We had a horrible dry shrimp pasta that went completely uneaten, and when we let the server know, she said ""sorry about that,"" and cleared the full plate right along with the rest of the dirty dishes. Hmm. Now if I were serving a table with a $155 bill, I'd have made a little more effort. Just sayin."
Bj R.,"Watsonville, CA",4,23,,1.0,2/25/2014,"Super disappointed! Went on a Tuesday at around 4 and was seated immediately. Our server asked if we would like to order drinks and/or appetizers. It took me 3 tries to get a beer, even though what I was asking for was listed on the menu. The server went  to ask the bartender each time, and  the bartender each time acted a little put out to interrupt his conversation with another employee behind the bar. Needless to say we ordered boneless chicken wings and the spinach stuffed mushrooms. We got our appetizers and he asked if my boyfriend wanted another beer. 10 mins later he arrives with the beer and we then get a chance to ask for silverware. By then our appetizers are cold and we have no desire to actually eat here anymore. Not a great experience! Won't be back to this one"
Christopher N.,"San Francisco, CA",364,255,250,2.0,7/14/2011,"Does every place have to suck at this mall? We waited almost 35 minutes to be seated in which I went inside the Oakridge food court to buy a box of chili cheese fries. The cool part? The pager they gave me beeped after I got my fries. The sad part? The fries tasted better than all of the 9 plates we ordered. There is nothing at this place that I myself cannot make better at home, and that includes their beloved pizookie.  I have a CuisinArt ice cream maker, a Ben and Jerry's recipe book, and the years of baking experience to destroy BJ's pizookie in a taste-test my friend, believe that. Oh and their nachos was the one last dish that I hope would be good because, you know, nachos are easy to make and with so few ingredients, how hard can it be to not taste great? WRONG, son.  they f*cked it up too. this place is the pits, son, armpits. not enough cheese, chips got stale after 10 minutes, extra cost for microscopic pieces chicken. I don't write enough bad reviews.  that's probably the only thing BJs is good for, 1-star and 2-star review quotas. This place, olive garden, pf chang, and all the other bs chains will be the death of us. Well, 2 stars thought because they have tons of beer to choose from which I can rely on to chase everything down.  you can't mess up beer.... well, they better hope not."
Ken K.,"Aptos, CA",8,19,,4.0,7/17/2012,"I come once or twice a month.  They have a VERY wide menu... which can be a problem when you are hungry & everything looks good.  I am definitely more than a hamburger eater, but their Black & Bleu Burger is AWESOME, and their sliders generally gravitate quickly down my throat. Service is good, had one poor experience in which the server apologized of why it was taking so long to get our drink, though the manager came and comped a meal for us!   They care about taking good care of their customers:)"
