Hillary H.,"Atlanta, GA",926,220,77,5.0,5/12/2011,"Sunday night favorite....The more I write reviews, the more I realize I eat out alot! Lol....If its good, its good.  Berry Cider A+  Pizza            A+  Pizookie      A++  (Warning you are guaranteed to feel like Precious after you have a meal like that. Just Sayin...lol)  Overall, Ive had several different dishes here and everything has always been really good from the Pastas to Salads down to their Baked Potatoes.  Try and get a table with William W. aka ""Bill or Billy"" he is fantastic, funny and really quick."
Jasmin M.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,1.0,11/5/2014,"After being seated outside to eat, not only did they not put on the heaters until an hour and a half after I arrived but also had this disgusting stench of shit because the sewage from the mall being emptied out onto the street right in front of me!  An hour after ordering our food, it still had not arrived. And when the food did arrive, they brought out half of the parties meal, then the rest of the meals came out one by one. The last and final meal received about a half an hour after the first one. Half of our party finished eating before I even got my food. Many of the meals came out cold and the management came in and out, not really doing anything but talking to the waiter. However, the waiter, Kevin was extremely nice. In the end of all this, not a free meal or apology from the manager! Honestly I've never encountered such horrible managers or management! This was one of the worst experiences ever! The fact that the service was this bad on a Wednesday night and not a Saturday or Friday night is ridiculous. Do not come here unless you want to smell shit while you eat the food that you ordered come out two hours late."
Richard F.,"San Jose, CA",101,278,17,4.0,3/30/2012,"BJ's manages to do something most restaurants haven't seemed to capture. They can separate their bar and their restaurant in a manner where they both flow together but yet it doesn't remain rowdy. They are always packed too! Dinner here is great and the portions are huge. I have had meatloaf, potatoes, pizza, pasta and sandwiches and have never had a bad dish. The portions make for great leftovers if you don't want to gorge yourself Whatever you do. Save room for dessert. Chocolate Chip Pazookie! A giant cookie served with ice cream. Love at first sight"
M N.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,,5.0,6/15/2015,Our server was very friendly and efficient. Very caring and on top of things. Would love to ask for him again on our next visit.
Oscar M.,"Gilroy, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/12/2015,"One female server had really long nails, really gross if you think about it. My steak was good until i lost my appetite when i saw her nails."
Ryan R.,"Salem, OR",174,57,75,2.0,4/2/2013,"Food and beer is really good. Service? Not so much. We were seated, ordered waters and a few beers. Just the water came out. It's now been over fifteen minutes and we have been ready to order for almost that whole time and our waiter is nowhere to be found.  Bad form, BJs."
Pochacco L.,"San Jose, CA",66,23,22,1.0,4/6/2011,"If I can take out the required star from Yelp, I would, due to the horrible service we received from Vanessa last Wednesday. The next time when I'm back here, I will make sure that Vanessa isn't our waitress. First, she forgot my drink, though she claimed that the bar lost it. The truth was that I saw another waitress bringing my drink out, asking the guests around if anyone ordered a Delicious Berry drink. I tried to make eye contact with her and raised my hand but she didn't see me.  Since, Vanessa didn't even bother to check back on us, I couldn't tell her my drink was missing 'til she brought out our entree. Secondly, she missed our soup and salad! The whole time we were eating, Vanessa never came to make sure everything was going well. I raised my hand a few times when I saw her around, she never paid attention to us.  Last but not least, when I told the other waitress that Vanessa forgot our soup and salad, I was looking for an apology, but that didn't come across at all. Vanessa simply asked if we want her to pack our soup and salad to go? Hello! Soup and salad should come after appetizer & before entree, not as we're leaving the restaurant! If Vanessa served other tables the way she served ours, BJ's is in for lots of trouble."
janice h.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,,5.0,6/10/2014,"6/10/14 Stopped in for lunch with a friend after the movies. She ordered pizza and did not specify which one so they brought one she did not want. No Problem. They made her the one she wanted, packed up the one she did not order and sent it home with her. The manager of the store came over to apologize after Danielle the waitress told her of her error. What service!! Food is good and pizza crust is excellent. Like NY pizza crust. I had the chicken mango salad and that was good as well.  Definitely going to go back there soon. Janice"
Aaron K.,"Long Beach, CA",433,109,172,3.0,5/18/2013,"They have a new chicken and bacon ranch pizza and its bomb! 3 stars cause ive had a lot of the other stuff and im not a huge of it, however I do love the beer there, and the pizookies"
Sarah M.,"Capitola, CA",45,92,11,3.0,6/22/2011,"Wanted to love this place, but sigh. Couldn't. Came here with a friend during the Stanley Cup Playoffs to watch Sharks Vs Kings. We ended up in a gooooddd spot, right in front of the TV at the bar woo hoo! Except we had to listen to the annoying bartender all night..ugh. My drink was not so good, I guess they had something training? IDK. The saving grace of the night was desert. NOM NOM IN HEAVEN."
Jana L.,"Campbell, CA",10,17,1,1.0,5/2/2011,"In Summary: It is really too bad because I enjoy the food and drinks at BJs locations all around.  However, this location has the WORST service of almost any place I have ever been.  If you want specifics, keep reading.  But basicly this place sucks and I think the entire management staff and at least a few servers need to be cleared out or at least go through bootcamp first. They should have their franchise license revoked as they are giving all BJs a bad name. Was ignored by our server, had to chase her down multiple times, asked for a manager that never came.  Probably spent at least and hour or more just waiting 20 min for drinks, another 20 to order food, and another 20 for the manager to come who never did when we asked to talk to him.  THEY SUCK!   If you absolutely must go there, though I recommend a boycott until it is under new management don't get a table with Pricilla.... You will get ignored."
Jason M.,"Granite Bay, CA",41,137,209,4.0,11/30/2013,Love the seared ahi salad. Crunchy and the flavored pop.. Low calorie and very tasty!
Daina E.,"Tell City, IN",76,50,32,1.0,6/24/2013,"This was my first time eating at a BJ's, so I was pretty excited! I was just disappointed with the establishment when my friends and I left.  Went there for a friend's birthday dinner and the wait was expected being a Saturday night, that didn't bother me at all.  The food was good, had the potstickers, really good! However, the portion was too small, even for an appetizer. My issue was with the service! Our FIRST waiter came to take our drink order, and came back 10 minutes later. She than told us that we would have a new waiter, I'm thinking ok, she's getting off work, but she was still there for the next 2 hours we were there. It felt odd we were tossed to another waiter. This new waiter we got was lazy and sarcastic. He wouldn't come back when we asked for refills, over and over. The real kicker was my friend got one of those free pizookies for signing up with there mailing list, but had to wait for the email coupon to come. It wasn't coming to his email, and he signed up right there at the restaurant too. Our second waiter said he would go ask the manager for approval to do it anyways, but never came back. We had to flag down this waitress with a crumby attitude, she said no to the approve and said he would just have to wait for the email for next time. We finally flagged down our waiter, and he said he never got around to a manager, and we told him what his colleague said, he grabbed her over to ask about it and she YELLS at him in front of us saying she already told us no and blah blah... This woman was not a manager either. Our waiter, however, apologized for her behavior and said for the wait and the scene, that he would make it on the house for him. Which we appreciated.  Than when it came time for our checks. The snotty waitress printed our checks wrong and when i pointed out the error, she chuckles and says, ""well than you just don't have to pay more anymore."" Wow, sorry for being honest, and we payed with cash, I didn't get my change. I asked for my change from the waiter, he chuckled and said, ""you want your change?"", than walks over to the table next to them and ask if they have change because I i wanted my change! I started to bitch hella loudly! when he walked back with my change and final receipt, he apologized and told no ever asks for their change... wtf, who doesn't ask for their change! The service was AWFUL!! Not going to that location (oakridge) again!"
Joe A.,"San Jose, CA",0,12,1,1.0,6/3/2015,"Service is just awful. Employees are rude an disrespectful. We couldn't stay to eat, we just walked out and went to PF Chang instead."
Irina S.,"San Jose, CA",29,105,24,4.0,1/18/2012,There are some really solid dishes here and the atmosphere is always fun. My favorite meal here is the pulled pork sandwich (best I have ever had) and a pizookie. Yum! Downsides: the parking situation is a nightmare at this location. And now they put calorie information on the menu...what a bummer! I don't really want to know that I am eating enough calories for 3 people lol
Melissa P.,"San Jose, CA",10,45,25,4.0,9/1/2011,"One would think you might get better service getting there at 11:30  in the morning on a Tuesday. Nothing like having a somewhat empty restaurant and getting sat next to someone else.  I never understood that. None the less.....the food is always good here.  I was actually able to talk to the person I was with.  If you come around dinner time, it tends to get loud. All and all, it was good, just lacked some service!"
Victoria L.,"San Francisco, CA",759,70,1,4.0,1/19/2011,"I came here for dessert during happy hour. I ordered a pizookie - a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream! and my friend ordered the biniet? Anyways! both of the desserts were terribly delicious. The soft cookie just melts in your mouth.  both desserts were about $5 which i think is reasonable. I have tried the food here before, and I am always pretty satisfied. Will be coming back for the beer in a year!"
Naiyah P.,"San Jose, CA",324,51,7,5.0,5/15/2011,"5 complete stars.... why? Because their Blackened Chicken Pizza is frick'n amazing!!! It has to be my top 2....EVER. It's not on the menu anymore, I don't know why. But they can still make it if you order it. All the other pizzas are crap. They're all made the same way, deep-dish style, but the blend of ingredients just don't do it for me. The BCP's ingredients compliment each other perfectly. I love how they threw corn in there to give it that slight saccharine flavor. And oh! The crust is just lovely.... crunchy, yet buttery and rich. I can't wait to have this pizza again. As for other menu items, I think they're all okay. Nothing on the menu has really wowed me yet. I haven't had them all, but many. The potstickers they have are pretty awesome. Desserts are.....ehhhh. I don't know why people are so crazy about the pazookie. It's ok. If they think so, they don't get out enough! I love the beer here. They have beers for the whole spectrum, and lucky for me, I'm a beer connoisseur. Most of the beers have a harmonious blend of flavors. Alot of them are very rich and subtle - which is perfect. For ladies, I would recommend the Very Berry Cider. That is always a hit when I order a carafe. It's just so tasty and bubbly. I swear you won't get enough! Service..... is a hit or miss. Thats that. It actually tends to miss more often. I wish they could be more attentive and aware."
Melissa P.,"San Jose, CA",1,22,3,2.0,3/22/2014,"We called ahead and checked in at 5:40 and were told we had about a 15-20 min wait-fast forward to 7pm and several trips to the host desk later we were finally seated, I'm the bar. 20 mins later I have my water .... Wonder when my dinner will arrive."
Kerry Z.,"San Francisco, CA",12,37,2,1.0,6/20/2011,"I normally enjoy BJ's, however today I was thoroughly disappointed.  I was a party of four including myself, and the service was awful for the middle of a non-busy afternoon.   We ordered an appetizer after we sat down.  Twenty minutes later after the table next to us that got seated ten minutes after us (party of 7) got their food before we even got the appetizer, we got a little upset.  We specifically asked our waitress to bring it out before our food.. And of course that didn't happen.  Ten minutes later (30 minutes of waiting) we got our food with no appetizer.  The waitress did not seem sincere about it which was really frustrating. We will probably not go back."
