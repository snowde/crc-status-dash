Maria N.,"San Jose, CA",121,112,58,4.0,11/9/2011,"Food is delicious, and by delicious i mean omfg who made these superb food. I've been here several times, and i have never seem to be let down. Everything i ordered tastes fantastic.  They give you really big portions so it's best to share with others, but if you don't like to share, then good luck on finishing your food lol. Their dessert is the best. My friend and i ordered something with ice cream and whip cream on top of a brownie (not a pizookie), and omg it was so good. It was not too sweet or bland, the balanced between the ice cream and brownie was just perfect.  I usually do not order coffee for my meal, but my eyes getting droopy was telling me something. Usually i figured getting coffee at a restaurant wouldn't be that wonderful and just okay. Though, BJ's proved me wrong. The coffee was actually delicious and rich.  Their service is usually great, nothing i can complain about. However, during busy nights, you'd usually have to wait 45 mins. It's best you go early!"
Thao L.,"San Jose, CA",291,265,445,5.0,9/29/2009,"Stop by here for some yummy and affordable lunch specials. I usually get the Roasted Turkey Cobb lunch special. For under $10, you get half a sandwich with your choice of fries and a soup or salad. What a deal! For those who don't know already, they have a special lunch punch card. You get one punch per visit and it's valid from 11am-4pm. After you purchase 6 lunch specials, the 7th one is free (max $10). Hooray for the lunch punch card!"
Samantha L.,"San Jose, CA",5,14,1,5.0,5/15/2012,LOVE this restaurant my friends and I love to come here on a Saturday night after the club. We love the food and love that its open till late. Their Mediterranean pizza is to die for!
Natalie S.,"Mountain View, CA",43,56,9,4.0,3/24/2013,"Always had great food, the last time I came the beer seemed a little flat though."
Anthony C.,"San Jose, CA",70,188,12,4.0,2/11/2013,This place is great. The happy hour menu is good. I like the Ahi Poke salad and the variety of different beers they serve.  I usually get the chicken sandwhich and soup + french fries for 8.99 or 7.99 during lunch. This is a good place to have a birthday meal. The service is usually pretty good. Be prepared to wait awhile if you go during the busy weekends.
Charles L.,"Blossom Valley, San Jose, CA",0,7,4,3.0,3/10/2014,"I come here often and have never had a bad waiter or waitress, but today I went 20 minutes after getting my food without seeing my waiter once. As always the food was good but that was pretty disappointing. By the way I was here on a Monday at around 145 it was not busy so there is no excuse. She later apologized and gave us a free pazookie so that was pretty cool."
Sylvia D.,"San Jose, CA",33,206,845,3.0,12/29/2010,"BJ's used to be my favorite restaurant back when I was a naive college student and didn't know any better. I eventually figured out that BJ's wasn't super rad; it was the people and experiences I associated with it. I don't know if this has to do with my quest for happiness, but throughout the years, I tend to end up at BJ's during happy hour. HH is in the bar area only Monday-Friday from 3-7 pm and Saturdays-Sundays from 10pm-close. HH is pretty decent and includes $1 off draft beer, $1 off cocktails, $2 off appetizers and flat bread pizzas, and half-off mini pizzas. Half of their appetizer menu is filled with the usual HH suspects like cheese and bacon potato skins, fried calamari, sliders, and chicken wings. Nothing exciting. The other half of the appetizer menu is occupied by Asian/Asian fusion BS. I'll pass. I usually go for their mini pizzas ($5.19) because they're deep dish and unhealthier than their flat bread cousins. If you're new to BJ's microbrews or like drinking a little bit of everything, they offer a good beer taster options. You can go for one 5 oz. taster, four tasters of their lighter lagers and pale ales, four tasters of their amber ales and dark beers, or eight tasters of everything. Overall, their beer is okay. I've had better porters and their's has a bitter finish. Their raspberry cider is good. I'm also a fan of their handcrafted root beer for whenever I'm not in need of fermented wheat/yeast/hops. Overall, food and drink is just A-OK, hence the three stars. Maybe I would've given them another if they still served their beer in BJ's pint glasses. I need to swipe one for my brewery pint glass collection. Just kidding. The pint glass from the Oxnard BJ's mysteriously rolled into my bag. That was like eight years ago so this review is not a self-confession that I'm a kleptomaniac."
Katie Anne N.,"San Francisco, CA",631,1335,908,4.0,1/10/2009,"Holy Pazookie! That thing is nuts. Huge cookie with ice cream on top. What more do you want? Food is standard Bar type food.  I suggest sitting at the bar. They have a wide variety of beers, especially Belgium! They offer tasters 5oz if you want to try a bit of everything at a mere $1.95. Good deal to me! There are TVs at every corner so no matter where you sit, you get to watch something.  My other gripe is parking on the weekends at Oakridge Mall. Ew..."
Anastasia Z.,"San Jose, CA",105,59,8,5.0,10/14/2013,We come here often and we are always pleased with the service and the food..vegeterian burger was delicious...buffalo wings were also very good! The server Nate was great!! We have also been served from A.J. as he is super too!!! In general the atmosphere is very friendly and fun in here.
Butterfly A.,"San Jose, CA",582,790,406,3.0,11/3/2010,"I went here for dinner with one of my women's meetup groups. The place was packed but luckily a table was reserved for us in the patio. Parking at this location is very hard to find since it's by the mall and the theater. If you have a hard time finding parking, park by Sears as there is usually parking there. It's around the corner from the main parking lot.  Anyways, the menu reminded me of what they have at the Cheesecake Factory. It's almost as extensive. One of the ladies in the group suggested that I try the pizza. I've never been here before so I trusted her opinion. I got the deep dish pizza with sausage and pepperoni, the mini size with a small Cesar salad. The pizza was terrible as was the salad. It was the worst Caesar salad that I've had in my entire life as it had barely any flavor and hardly any cheese on it. The service was good and the servers were nice and attentive, but the food sucked, at least what I got!  Someone in our group ordered one of their special pazookie deserts which is a giant cookie or cookies topped with a ton of ice cream. I did like the cookie. It was warm, gooey, and great. If it wasn't for that cookie desert and the good service, I would've given them two stars. Maybe their other dishes are better. Stay away from the pizza and Caesar salad. I only ate everything since I was hungry. I really was expecting the food to be better."
Anh D.,"Milpitas, CA",295,561,228,2.0,2/27/2011,"The flatbreads were pretty good but nothing spectacular. We came here specifically for the much-touted pizookie that came with vanilla ice cream, BUT much to our incredulous dismay, at 10:00 pm on a Monday night, BJ's, which has a dessert menu with 85% of the desserts containing vanilla ice cream, was completely out of vanilla ice cream! We told our server how disappointed we were, but rather than expressing empathy for our dessert-starved souls, our server was very non-plussed about the situation and just served us some pizookies with chocolate ice cream, which did not make for a good dessert.  Mostly, I am surprised about how we were treated when we were simply telling the server a criticism about their customer care/service. It was not a criticism of her directly, just of whoever did the food ordering that week.  Anyway, other than that, the food was pretty average, minus the desserts, which I never had a chance to taste the full potential of."
Jackie V.,"San Jose, CA",27,107,10,4.0,4/20/2011,"All hail BJ's! Now if you've read my reviews, you will remember how happy I was to find gluten free pizza at Amici's. Sadly, the $25/medium price doesn't encourage me to eat there often. Enter BJ's! I'd heard that they put out a gf (gluten free) menu, so we had to go check it out. Not only do they have gf pizza, but it's reasonably priced (around $12 for 3 toppings for a decent sized pizza), AND it tastes even better than Amici's; you can't even tell that it's gf. I've had it a few times now and as a die hard pizza lover, I'd eat it all the time if I could. I'm taking away one star because the wait can be stupidly long & the service can be rather slow, but my love for their gf pizza makes those things much more tolerable than they might be otherwise. Thank you, BJ's, for making this celiac chick's life a little happier!"
Danielle S.,"Sacramento, CA",482,360,325,2.0,3/28/2009,"I don't really like reviewing chain restaurants. Eh, this particular location needed to be ranted about though. My friend wanted to have her birthday dinner here, so she came around 7:30 pm to get a table for 15 people. BJ's is anal about only reserving for parties of 9 or less, so when we heard that our wait would be 2 hours, we were annoyed, but let it go. Then other parties that came after us were seated before us.  We weren't seated till about 10:30. And we gathered up the balls to keep asking them about our table once we hit the 2-hour mark. Service kinda ranked. The waiter was a little catty. The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is cause the pizookies make a fat girl like me very, very happy."
Mark F.,"San Jose, CA",40,76,24,1.0,4/22/2011,"I have been frequently visiting BJ's for about 4 years (I eat there weekly), and I generally enjoy it every time.  There have been times when I have received excellent service, and other times when the service was not as great... but I always end up walking out satisfied.  Last night was not the case...  We were a party of 6 and I, along with the whole party, was fully disappointed with the whole experience.  Our server Danny B first of all did not even introduce himself to us or tell us his name, he completely dismissed us when we were asking for drinks, couldn't crack a smile and last but not least he must have completely forgotten about the soup I ordered because it took over 25 minutes to hit our table and i know they normally have fast ticket times. When i finally asked for the soup for the final time he acted as though i was TOTALLY inconveniencing him.  I just found the service extremely disappointing since i myself have worked as a server and am now a restaurant manager for The Elephant Bar, I know no one in my staff would act like that especially if they only have to serve 3 tables at a time.... never again will I go there.

Garrett L.,"San Leandro, CA",467,27,7,1.0,11/25/2010,"Any BJ's other than San Jose is awesome. It is not the food that sucks its the service at this place.  My friends and I wanted to go to a place with good old American cuisine like pizza, pasta and salmon teriyaki (sarcasm...) so the 10 of us decided to drive 30 miles to BJ's. The wait for the 10 of us was suprisingly not that long, it just took 8 mins to get seated.  The waitress took forever to order our drinks and seemed very rude when we asked to put our orders in. She first brought out some plates for the salad and I noticed that there was a piece of left over food on the side of the plate (it made me question what kind of  food BJ's was serving, that can cling on after the dish washer...). I asked the waitress kindly can she replace this plate because there's food on the side. She rudely responds ""well there's no charge for that!"", i know what your thinking, Garrett, your over reacting its just a bad joke, no my fellow yelpers she said it in the rudest way possible with a straight face. I guess when you don't have to work for a tip, the asshole comes out.  On a separate note I give BJ's knife and fork sandwiches a 4 out of 5. Its at a reasonable price around $12 and it can fill you up! I have tasted all of them and they all has not failed me yet. No BJ's dinner is complete with out a freshly oven baked cookie with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top served in a deep dish, the black mamba itself,  THE PIZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKIE!!!!!!!!! When I handed my v-card to BJ's famous pizookie for the first time, I cried myself to sleep 3 nights in a row reminiscing on how organismic the taste was and  I promised myself I would never settle for anything less.   The service killed it for me at San Jose's BJs, not even the pizookie can recover. If your a fan of BJ's and you server is named Christina, do yourself a favor and just leave, because she would tarnish your image of BJ's. Peace, Love, and Sadface"
Scott B.,"Aromas, CA",1,50,1,2.0,7/13/2013,"Went here on a Sunday. 1:00 pm  Party of 2. Parking sucks. But your at the mall. Secret is to park at Home Depot. Ordered a club sandwich and Chicken sandwich and 1 sampler appetizer. The quality of the food was ahhhhlkkk. The quantity was ok if you like bread. The shoe string fries had more grease than potato. Oh and the appetizer never came. The service sucked because the waiter never brought the appetizer, never checked on us or refilled the water or tea glasses. During our visit, the waiter went on break and the girl who was covering, didn't seem to care either. No more BJ's for me!

Amit S.,"Mountain View, CA",125,32,2,1.0,12/13/2013,Bad service. They add your name on the list but then essentially boot you to the end of the line.
Gabino U.,"San Jose, CA",49,2,,5.0,3/19/2014,Thank U Bjs !! Finally a real btender ... Sarah ... Lol making the 4 person job ... I'm back ...  She rocks ... She is the best .. 100 things at the time ...
Joel V.,"San Jose, CA",581,870,105,3.0,7/26/2009,"Sadly, I really like BJ's and would like to give them a better review, but until they get their service down - I can't give them the 4-star rating their food deserves. I'm a big fan of their starters and salads - especially the egg rolls and their wedge.  Their burgers are amazing, and their other sandwiches are good as well.  Their pizza was not very good in my opinion.  Best for last - the Pizzookie dessert...a fresh baked cookie (I like Peanut Butter) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Maybe the best desert ever. Unfortunately, I've been to four locations and all of them have a very poorly trained wait staff.  Slow and tons of mistakes.  Consistently too.  3.5 stars - wish I could give 4."
Matt H.,"San Jose, CA",335,210,14,3.0,12/7/2011,"It's been hit-or-miss, we've had phenomenal service...we've had horrible service.  Food is good, food is eh whatever, you get the idea.  Its one of those places you just need to have an open mind about and not be thinking you're going to Santana Row...remember you're still attached to Oakridge Mall.   My recommendations, ""A Drink Like That"", Classic Pazookie, and Chicken Lettuce Wraps...probably not in that order."
