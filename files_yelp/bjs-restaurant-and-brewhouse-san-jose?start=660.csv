Robert R.,"Sparks, NV",44,58,5,2.0,3/28/2013,"If I was rating on beer alone, 4 stars. But, the restaurant food is horribly inconsistent. I've lived in this neighborhood for 35 years. So this isn't the first chain joint I've seen go from good to awful. The pizza is pretty good, but this review isn't about that. This evening I ordered the ribeye, medium, a baked potato and a salad with house dressing(ranch). I got a piece of leather, a salted rock, and bowl of blue cheese. My daughter ordered some shrimp thing in lettuce wraps. We knew it was a cold dish, but the shrimp still needed to thaw and they forgot to marinate them in anything that resembled flavor. Everyone else has staple pasta dishes or kids meals so there was little complaint there. But, this has been a typical experience, so I think we are about done."
Alexis G.,"Reno, NV",49,50,10,3.0,1/23/2013,"Our host made our experience. We told him of our last experience and how terrible it was an he made our visit great. He brought us our long over due birthday pizookie, and much more attentive service from our waitress."
Jerry C.,"San Jose, CA",8,6,,1.0,4/18/2014,"Been here once last year,  was chaotic.  Same story last night.  Waited for half hour for table of 4. After been seated, waited another another 15 mins for waiter to stop by.  Put our drink and food order in, they got delivered in reasonable amount of  time. But with 2 mistake -  a drink was wrongly made and 1 dish was wrongly delivered. At the end of day, things got rectified, drink was not charged along with certain confusion as severed keyed 2 drinks instead of 1 which was only alcohol drink ordered. Food are okay - edible, nothing special worth to mention about."
Jenny O.,"San Jose, CA",250,211,975,4.0,5/14/2009,"So tempting to make a sick joke..but I'm gonna refrain myself. Took the BFF here for a surprise 21st birthday dinner and boy was she surprised..surprised to see all our friends lookin' gloomy from a nearly 3 hour wait, lol. Despite the dreadful wait since we were such a big party (like 15 heads) everything was great. Pretty whack that they didn't take reservations on a Saturday night, guess it's that busy! I'm totally diggin' the service and the drunks at the bar. Our server had to cut short because she had to leave for a party..aww..but everyone was too intoxicated to care. Food was delicious, or does everything taste better when tipsy? You have to try the Avocado rolls..hella BOMB!! The dipping sauce made it even better.  And if it's your birthday they give you a free pizookie..I don't think they even checked my friend's ID. So just say it's your bday and maybe you can get away with scoring one! Definitely a great place to go with your friends."
Kristine L.,"Silicon Valley, CA",279,373,75,3.0,7/10/2011,The food is alright...just normal whatever food. I never go here for their entrees anyway. It's really all about the PIZOOKIES! Delicious baked cookie topped with ice cream. The cookie itself is soooooo good! It's soft chewy and hot. Paired with the ice cream...yummyyyy!!
Isaac M.,"Milpitas, CA",5,2,,5.0,2/28/2014,"Went around 1 on a Friday afternoon. Was crazy busy, but was seated fast. Even though it was busy our waitresses Renate was awesome! She kept us updated on our order and was very knowledgeable of the bear menu. Best experience I've had at a bjs in a long time. Way better than the one in Dublin hands down"
Justin G.,"Santa Nella Village, CA",17,10,,2.0,12/12/2013,Went to b j 'a today for a friends b day the service was ok but the glass's were dirty they got are order wrong.
Jessica S.,"San Jose, CA",118,2,,4.0,2/25/2015,"I love Bj's! This is my first time writing a review and I knew I had to after my experience on Saturday. The wait was okay (typical for being a Saturday) and I was sat promptly by a nice girl (Dina I think?) Our waiter Justyn D gave my group the best experience we could have ever asked for! He had other parties but made sure to be attentive at the same time. He greeted us quickly, made sure to give us our refills, and the food came out promptly for being a Saturday night. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because the food isn't that great. The ice cream on our pizookies were mushy, you can tell that the food isn't the highest quality but the service is what made the experience so great. Thank you Justyn!!! I'll be sure to come in and request you!"
Jasmine V.,"Campbell, CA",0,2,,2.0,3/30/2015,"We really enjoy their food but lately their customer service has been so-so.  We recently went in for dinner, called ahead for 2 adults and a high chair.  Showed up and they couldn't find our name....they finally were able to locate us, but not by our name, just the first letter of our name and they had us down as 3 adults.  We asked for 2 adults and a high-chair and she said no problem, it would be 30 minutes to wait.  About 40 minutes passed and we saw plenty of families with babies getting seated.  We checked on our status and they said 2 parties were ahead of us.  Three parties later I checked again and they go to seat us with a booster, not a high-chair.  The manager on duty was nice and was able to get us to a seat with a high char right away.  We were able to put our order in, but it took about another 30 minutes for our food and we never were checked on again.  2 1/2 hours later we left.... Not sure if we will deal with the hassle again in the future."
Rae A.,"San Jose, CA",63,77,524,4.0,8/13/2011,"First Impression: I've been coming here for years, and not to mention had my birthday dinner 2 times and probably might have more! Their staff are very friendly, I remember this one time the wait was ridiculous that a waiter came out with slices of pizza! I'm in love with their Shark pizza, this is a MUST try! Their Chicken wings are one of my favorites, happy to say that this place doesn't have to expertise on a dish to make this place great. My favorite dessert is their Pizookie (White Chocolate & Macadamia Nuts), this also is a MUST try. This place is definitely a sport venue, there are TVs everywhere with a big bar. Did I mention they brew their own beers?! Awesome! I kudos those who do. My pick would have to be the Berry Cider. Everyone here seems to always be happy and free spirited. They have outdoor seating with tents and pole heaters just in case you get cold. The service is consistent and on point, so expect to tip them good  Last Impression: I'm in love with this place! I haven't tired everything on the menu yet, but I'm already anticipating on my next visit. This place is YUM! Check out my photos I posted!"
Jennifer T.,"San Jose, CA",151,223,169,3.0,1/24/2011,"OMG seriousllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...Sunday night and this place is SO PACKED. Hated the wait (40 minutes). It's nice that they have a bar area so you can relax and wait with a drink. Why can't they put up the Australian Open on more than one screen? It got A QUARTER of a TV screen while college basketball got 3 WHOLE screens. Meh. One of the waitress is a BEE-OTCH who literally pushed me aside so she can pass by, how about an ""excuse me?"" I am just full of complaints but I think I'm done now... Food was great. Potato skins are yums. Pizza can be quite confusing with so many options but you can always do half/half. I liked their porter -- chocolate-y. Wait time for food was decent. I saw a busboy stop in the middle of an aisle. He busted out his tip money (HUGE WAD) and started counting. Kinda unprofessional, but what a funny sight!"
Anh T.,"San Jose, CA",434,188,118,3.0,4/14/2009,"We went here fro Holy Thursday late night grub.  Didn't have to wait that long because we opted for sitting outside.  Pretty much, it's always busy here because it's a rocking place.  We ate with a soon to be priest and he did praise.  it was kinda funny having people look at us but whatever, I love God.  I prefer the DeAnza one. Pros: Wait list is faster then you think it is. The pizza is pretty big and the crust rocks! Water rills are off the hook because they reload with lemon most of the time. Slow on ordering but fast on giving the check. Cousin's Shrimp Pasta was pretty good. Cons: SLOW about almost any thing but then again it was pretty crowed. Don't sit outside when there are a bunch of kids for a birthday party.  They all shared their soda and alcoholic beverages.  It was a Sharks night so that pretty much sucked. Good look parking because it is part of the mall. Waiters switched like 3 times.  How annoying..."
Marshall C.,"San Jose, CA",90,141,5,3.0,8/7/2011,"Why is this place so crowded all the time? They don't take reservations, so I always try my luck at the bar area. Average food, but very expansive menu offerring. No subtle, complex flavors here. Everything is over seasoned. It's an assault on your palette. Prices are slightly high, but acceptable.   Service is a little slow due to the full crowd, but they are attentive and make an effort to be timely."
spice e.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/16/2015,The worst service ever.  I took  my  nephew  for his 6th birthday  and they told us the wait is 45 mins. We waited  almost  2 hours and still didn't get  our  table. The young teens working  in the front  where chatting  and kept telling  us your next.  We just took off after. 2 hours wait.   I will never  go  back there  again.
Naomi W.,"San Jose, CA",215,62,27,5.0,3/20/2013,Love the daily lunch specials! Love the unlimited soup & salad! I was even able to take it togo! Sucks that they only have broccoli cheddar sun-tues.. but I work at the mall and I always ask them for a quicker service and im always walking out satisfied! Oh! & try their handmade sodas! So good & gluten free!!
Danster L.,"Orange County, CA",1683,730,2280,4.0,8/9/2008,"I first had BJ's many many years ago at Laguna Beach where it looks like a hole in a wall. Little did I know it was a chain and would expand throughout the Bay Area. When it comes to my favorite BJ's, this location is the closest and the most frequented. I love the parmesan crusted chicken which was one huge serving for less then 12 bucks! Piled high are mashed potatoes but they are forgettable. If it's your birthday, you get a free pizookie. I won't tell you what it is but if you happen to be there on your birthday, get one. The pizzas are good and the atmosphere is really energetic. A great gathering place on a weekend night or any night."
Kivani R.,"San Jose, CA",66,126,13,5.0,1/23/2013,"Love the 2 for 20 deal. It's not on the menu, but if you ask for it they will do it for ya! It comes with either 2 soups or 2 salads (or one of each), a 10""in pizza of your choice, and a pizookie of your choice! All for 20 big ones! Delish. Also service is great each time I've visited. Thumbs up BJS!"
Mitch R.,"San Jose, CA",25,15,1,2.0,11/6/2013,I would expect better for their prices.. Pretty disappointed in their food. But their pizookie  are absolutely delicious! That's only the only thing I'm going there for.
Shaun C.,"San Jose, CA",1180,231,9,3.0,7/6/2010,"So I know, I lose credibility reviewing a BJ's Brewery (for a third time).  Whatever - the experience was worthy of being written about.  We sat in the bar, the section was empty and was greeted by Kimber.  I loved her voice, it was kind of Chicago meets San Jo in terms of accent.  She rocked.  She was absolutely fantastic.  She got sat 8 tables within ten minutes and busted ass.  She was on it, we never went without and nobody else did either.   It is always refreshing seeing someone at a restaurant like this actually care about doing a good job.  She was even helping the lone busser out, bussing her own tables and generally just handling her sh*t.  Good for you Kimber.  I am going to put the bartender on blast for a moment.  I think her name was Shannon.  You are a biatch.  You are not cute and honestly, if you listened to the way you spoke to your peers, you would probably be ashamed of yourself.  When someone asks you for help, don't talk down to them and/or talk about them when they walk away.  TABLES CAN HEAR YOU.  This is the second time that I have come here and heard servers talk about each other and/or their tables.  Have some class and grow up.  Because at the end of the day, you are a bartender at BJ's not curing cancer. Other than that, SERVICE WAS FUN TO WATCH!!! 5 stars for Kimber -2 stars for bitchy bartender..."
Cathe T.,"San Jose, CA",17,64,13,4.0,8/12/2010,"This place never disappoints me!  Definitely try these (I usually eat these items on the regular): -Italian sausage flatbread  -chicken pesto flatbread -Asian sesame salad -Aki poke appetizer -Spinach artichoke dip - SPAGHETTI WITH SPICY SAUCE (IT'S A MIXTURE OF TOMATO AND ALFREDO SAUCE) ----SOOO GOOD! -chicken wings -mini brushetta with pesto vinaigrette  - PIZOOKIE! servings are BIG, so you can share! Decent pricing---plates run $9-$13 (dinner time). I say come here for lunch---the servings are the same size, but you pay less than the dinner price!"
