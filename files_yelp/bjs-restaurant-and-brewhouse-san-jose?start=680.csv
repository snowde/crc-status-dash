Ron S.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,4.0,3/12/2015,I come on occasion for a beer or two during their happy hour. Their broad selection of craft brews are good. I particularly like their Red and Stout. The Brewnette and Pale are decent. They also have a reasonable selection of beers and ales from other breweries. The bar staff rocks; they are attentive and friendly.
Ruby Doo S.,"San Jose, CA",17,6,,5.0,1/28/2011,"These 5 words back up the 5 star rating: White Chocolate Macadamian Nut Pizookie! The best desert in my world, hands down. The veggie baked potato with alfredo is delicious, the personalized calzones are amazing, and avocado eggrolls are scrumptious! Hubby loves the Hefeweizen  on tap. Enough said."
Al M.,"San Jose, CA",42,8,,4.0,2/27/2011,"First things first: this is NOT what you might think! I was as surprised as the next man (or woman!) to see an establishment so overtly advertising BJs, and so one day I decided to go in and get one for myself. Why not, right? Disappointingly though, this is actually a Restaurant and Brewhouse, and the letters 'BJ' do in fact refer to their respective letters of the alphabet. However, once you settle down at one of their many tables or stools conveniently located within the Restaurant and Brewhouse itself, you realize things could be worse. Variously, kind people offer beverages and even eats (food), bringing them to you shortly after you have asked for them, often correctly remembering your original request. Try the whiskey with some diet pepsi - a unique slant on a popular cocktail. To conclude, this place is a delight for the taste buds, but may need to rethink its misleading marketing to be a true contender for greatness."
frankie g.,"San Jose, CA",6,34,,2.0,10/26/2011,"Bj's pizza is hella good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just thinking of it I want to go eat it!  The pizza is hella thick in a good way!!!! There pizookie is off the hook you must try it!!! There pasta is okay, they are very stingy with there sauce and I been to this place a hand full of times and all those times they were hella shaddy with the sauce but the pizza makes up for it! Omg there sevice sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you go in the evening it will take you at least 1 hour on a slow day to get seated if your party is 5 or more, then it will take you another 30 minutes to order even if you know what you want already after that dammmmmmmmmm just plan on being at this place for a long time!!!!!!!  BUT THIS PIZZA IS VERY GOOD!"
Sam W.,"Gilroy, CA",269,261,16,4.0,9/19/2012,"Good pizza, and decent brews. But the pizookie earns it four stars."
Sherry M.,"San Jose, CA",88,376,127,5.0,9/6/2013,"This was my first time at this BJ location and I had a good experience.  I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad and it was deelicious!!  Their customer service was good, it wasn't too crowded at all at 4:30pm though parking was a little hard to find.  Kids had mac n cheese and chicken tenders, nothing special."
Aerin L.,"Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, HI",2,185,38,3.0,12/28/2014,Great drink specials but on and off food experiences. I used to like this place but the last time I went I had a really bad experience I won't be back for awhile.
Christine N.,"San Jose, CA",22,19,5,2.0,1/6/2013,"Thanks goodness their food is good because their service sucks. I personally love their food but every time I come back the service is slow and the servers don't seem like they could care less about or needs, even the food runner with the established mustache is super rude. I work at a restaurant and there is definitely a difference with service here. The workers here don't care that they made us wait a long time for them to approach us. They just don't seem to care about their guests"
Kimberly C.,"Austin, TX",93,342,86,5.0,4/14/2009,"Oh BJ's.  I wish i discovered you sooner especially since I'll be moving far from any of your locations shortly.  So, like most restaurants, there are a few things that aren't the best entrees, but the ones I have ordered were mediocre to really really good.   This is the place to bring people that may be picky because there is variety ranging from pasta, sandwiches, pizza, asian/fusion, and other standard American dishes.  I like the environment even though it may get packed at times.  Service has always been good (I've been to this location a few times).   Decent:  buffalo wings, some kind of chicken sandwich, caesar salad REALLY good: white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie, grilled chicken w/basalmic glaze & mashed potatoes, fried potato skins, pizza, and CHILI (my fave)"
Nelson C.,"San Jose, CA",2,16,,4.0,2/23/2015,"I have gone here a couple of times with many friends for their birthdays. One time we had a server accidentally order us an extra pitcher and beer but because he made the mistake, he gave us the pitcher for free! He knew it was better to let a few customers enjoy something free rather than dumping it down the drain because of a misunderstanding."
Emily S.,"San Jose, CA",3,111,7,3.0,7/1/2011,"Went here for lunch today. I ordered the lunch size cobb salad with the dressing on the side. What a disappointment! Here's how the online menu describes it:  Chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce tossed with our special creamy garlic dressing and oven-baked seasoned croutons. Topped with roasted turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, feta cheese, tomatoes and avocado. The menu has a picture of a lovely looking salad.  My salad was iceberg lettuce - no romaine. No croutons. A couple cubes of turkey. A couple scraps of bacon.  It was a sorry looking salad. I couldn't let this go - I've seen better salads come out of Subway. So, I spoke up to our waiter and he happily replaced it. I got the fish tacos instead and they were AWESOME. Service was a little pushy. Our waiter asked us to order twice before our drinks even arrived. But we were never ignored, which was nice."
Anna C.,"San Jose, CA",7,152,1,1.0,8/5/2013,"Poor service and mediocre food.  I think our server, Jason, was high. On a Monday night, we waited 15 minutes and asked twice to have our dirty table at the bar cleaned off.  Had to ask for silverware from another server who looked alert after our pizza came out cold. We weren't asked if everything was ok, nor were our drinks refilled.  After our meal, we asked for 2 boxes and the check.  After 15 more minutes of waiting, my husband had to get up to get the boxes himself and I flagged down the manager to tell him about our experience who then pulled up our check at the to-go counter so we could pay immediately. Will probably choose Buffalo Wild Wings over BJs at the mall from now on."
John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,215,17,4.0,8/3/2013,"i'm rounding up because this really should be a 3.5, and 3 seems too harsh. there are a lot of choices on this menu, and that's great.  i'd say it's a step up from chili's and applebee's, with ae emphasis on pizza. i had the spicy meatball pizza, and that was great if you're into spicy tomato-based flavors.  very tasty, and it was a decent-sized portion. i'd come back to check out the rest of the menu."
Lori M.,"Santa Clara, CA",91,10,136,4.0,8/2/2011,"So I had a shopping day with my mom and daughter today so we choose to grab lunch at BJ's .  They have a super huge menu it's like a book with lots of yummy things in it , but we choose the lunch menu . They have a new low cal menu so I ordered the flat bread pizza with side salad .  The pizza was a Margherita stye it was so full of flavor and my salad wa sthe  balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes it was good and paired with my pizza good . for under 600 calories it was very yummy.  My mom also got a pizza and salad combo she got the deepdish sausage and a house salad with ranch dressing and homemade cruotons .  They also have the mini appitezer menu wich I love when place have the smaller menu options so we ordered the fried artichoke hearts they were tender and yummy with the dipping sauce they were only $ 3.95 thats pretty good .  I really wanted a pazooki but since I already slurged on the artichokes I was good and did not have one . Next time I will...... we had a nice lunch ....."
John Y.,"San Jose, CA",2,30,3,2.0,7/25/2013,Terrible food. Fish was salty. Steak was raw!!!
Jenna V.,"San Jose, CA",1,10,1,2.0,1/8/2015,"my husband and USE  to come here every Friday for beer and pizza. Then it was nice after we had our baby cause its pretty family orientated, but i haven't been too this one in a while since the one on Coleman opened, and its closer to my house. Anyways I came here with 2 other friends, we got 1 appetizer, a beer each, and waters and simple meals off of the menu. OMG!  We were here for over 2 1/2 hours waiting for food, and our tab! 3 people had sat in the table behind us before we paid! our waiter was horrible NEVER  refilled our waters or too check too see how everything was in general. Highly disappointed because this place use too be really good and now its just another chained restaurant. Mind you this was on a Wednesday that we went so not even as busy as it is on the weekend :("
SplitSecond A.,"San Jose, CA",174,49,137,5.0,7/17/2013,"Thanks for the good service and food!!!Was originally suppose to go to buffalo wild wings across the street for my birthday but the service was NO GOOD, decided to come to BJs to eat and grab a few drinks for my birthday, At this point I was pretty pissed off about how BWW had treated us. Needless to say I waited 2 hours at buffalo wild wings and didnt get any service at all, went to BJ and right when I walked in I was seated, and food was on our table within 20 min, I then told the server the service was up to my satisfaction and he appreciated it and gave us 5 free pazookie togo!!!"
Val R.,"San Jose, CA",11,19,1,2.0,8/30/2013,"Waited 25 minutes for a beer sampler which was not good. All the beers (tried variety) were overly hoppy or bitter, waitress seemed overwhelmed, nachos were bland, gluten-free pizza was decent, steak salad was great. Gluten-free chocolate chip cookie with ice cream saved the night. Overall, not my first choice."
Jan P.,"San Jose, CA",302,861,1692,2.0,7/21/2008,"Okay, seriously, where in the menu does it say that every mini pizza is made with some amount of tomato sauce in order to temper baking? Oh wait, nowhere! When I sliced into my mini white spinach artichoke pizza, I knew something was afoul when red started to bleed out. I asked the waiter about it, and he attempted to cover it up with a lie when clearly I was not happy with the taste.  I normally enjoy BJ's, but after this experience, I don't think I'll be back to this location, which is unfortunate since I am a local. The staff members are fairly friendly, though the quality of food has deteriorated and/or is inconsistent. Note: Their happy hour has one of the better deals than the other restaurants attached to the mall."
Tony L.,"San Jose, CA",7,24,1,3.0,11/28/2014,"I have been coming to this one since I was a kid.  And it's just okay borderline 2 stars.  The food is consistent compared to all the BJs I have been too.  I still like the root beer here,  but the service here is so inconsistent.  I have had great people and really bad ones.  I go here when it's late and there isn't much else open or when I want a pozookie,  but it is not a place I would ever go out of my way to come here."
