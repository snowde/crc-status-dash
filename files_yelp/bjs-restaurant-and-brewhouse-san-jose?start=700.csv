Hellen D.,"Foster City, CA",308,181,95,4.0,5/21/2010,"3 things I only get here: Great white pizza with extra alfredo sauce on the side Grilled chicken potato  AND the pazooki. (this item is a must have, even if you think you can't fit anymore)."
Lovette L.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,31,15,5.0,12/19/2013,Came from Santa Cruz to check out BJ's  and had a wonderful gentleman named Chris go above and beyond service even though he was not our service he took time to help us. Our server Renate was amazing as well she was an amazing server will definitely have me and my family coming back. Great first impression made by these two workers. Potstickers very good and cooked well and the Ahi Salad was very fresh.

Ms. Y.,"Campbell, CA",270,540,112,4.0,8/8/2010,"We joined a group of friends here after a BBQ so I didn't order anything this particular time except dessert. I ordered the chocolate chip chunk pizookie. It was super sweet, warm, and yummy. One was enough for the both of us to share because though it is delicious, it's also 600 calories! eek.. o_0  So sharing... really was caring this time lol. Customer service was fine. The girl who helped our table was friendly and pretty attentive for it being a Saturday night.  They even brought out a birthday mini-pizookie for my boyfriend."
Sunny C.,"San Jose, CA",105,137,226,4.0,7/10/2012,"Yes, this place is always packed but you just have to know when to get here! Buffalo pizza is on the money and the avocado rolls never disappoint.  Get the beer sampler if you're not sure.  I love their Harvest Heff and the Nutty Brewnette.  And of course no meal is complete without a BJ's Pizzookie.  Plus they have a pretty decent size bar area with plenty of screens to catch all the games."
Alek K.,"North Hollywood, CA",145,101,186,3.0,6/21/2011,"The place was loud and obnoxious.  The pizza dough was raw, the pasta was undercooked, they forgot my beer, and overall it was just average.  We were there for a graduation, so we had a blast.  It was fun and the employees were very nice."
David K.,"Cupertino, CA",735,970,188,3.0,2/5/2009,"I will keep it short cause this is a chain restaurant. Got to say the food is probably better than Chili's but not as good as Cheesecake Factory. So somewhere in between. Bunch of food on the menu that will totally do the job. The beer is cool, love drinking the samplers. Love all the TV screens to watch whatever sport game you desire!  One thing I have to say that every BJ's I have gone to from up in norcal to down in socal where I went to school. You're customer service SUCKS. There are times that some waiters will leave you waiting forever just to come to your table and greet you. Maybe its all because corporate needs a better way handbook (how to be a better waiter/waitress for their servers.  Because yes this place does get busy most of the time so servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off and there is always a wait. On thing I hate about this one though, is the location. PARKING is horrible here!!!"
Anna S.,"San Jose, CA",174,362,164,4.0,5/27/2010,"Hehhhehhahahaaha. Pizookie in the whee hours of nine oclock. We did not want to wait, so we went to sit in the bar area even though we only wanted a pizooke. We read that it was half off wine night, SCORE. So we decided to order a glass of wine. I got some Australian Red Wine...no good, do not get. My fellow adventurer's wine was better. Anyways, we ordered a pizookie and wine & our waitress tells us, ""Pizookie & wine? You are my type of people!"" HAHA ROCK ON, thanks Ashley. It was indeed delish and enjoyable, minus my wine that needed roundabout 10 more years of sitting. I think I will go back on a Tuesday night for wine & pizookie becuase, fudge, what a grrrrrreat combination!"
Gloria D.,"San Jose, CA",19,8,1,3.0,7/22/2013,"This was the second time visiting this location. First time was a friendly service (we sat at the bar during happy hour). Our second visit we sat outside; my boyfriend asked how big the quesadillas were and the waiter responded by saying he doesnt know, he's new. He could have easily said ""let me find out."" He did not serve us well and in fact concentrated on the large party and pretty ladies. Plus, what my boyfriend ordered he did not like."
Lj M.,"San Jose, CA",80,1,1,2.0,1/18/2015,"Server was wonderful and checked in with us constantly. The wait took double the time they told us though. We waited about an hour and fourty minutes though we were told 45 minutes or less in the first place. Also, the other five people who I ate dinner with and I all had dry and extremely over-cooked food. Again, the waitress was nice and constantly checked in with us, but the food was not at all what you would expect from this restaurant."
Sherrie Rose M.,"San Jose, CA",26,106,,3.0,6/4/2013,"I have been to this restaurant two different times.  The menu is overwhelming there are so many choices!  When I was there last night, I ordered the Cajun Pasta with Blackened Shrimp.  It was delicious though it was not spicy at all and I wasn't convinced the shrimp were blackened.  The waiter was very friendly and pleased with each of my choices (including the IPA, the pasta, and later on the baked beignet that I shared with my friend).  The IPA was perfect and strong.  If you're looking for affordable beer and food in a friendly environment, this is your place!"
Jasmine P.,"San Francisco, CA",287,247,4,4.0,4/2/2010,"Four Stars for the Restaurant, Five Stars for our Server!!! Slide your host or hostess a few bucks, wink and nod and cut that longer than life line to get in.  Well... that's what we did.  Worked like a charm! So... Ashley our server made our night that much more...um... ""more"".  Fun, memorable, yummy.... Yeah.  First impressions, weren't that great, as she snuck up on us trying not to interrupt our menu reading, we felt like wild animals being attacked!  Immediate defense, we hated our server.  It only took us ten seconds to fall in LOVE with her.  Sorry for anyone who got a crappy server tonight, ours rocked our socks!  She was patient, personable, funny, thoughtful and had one heck of a memory.   Did everything by the book when it comes to table tap time (the time we had to wait for her before she greeted us) refilling our drinks, and suggestions.  She even apologized for something that was clearly not her fault!!!   WARNING:  At the night's end, I approached Ashley's manager about her amazingness, only to discover there are apparently  3+ other Ashley's!  So don't be fooled, our Ashley is a college student, studying nursing.... she has a hell of a head on her shoulders and I think she should be running the place.   Time out... I know what your thinking... ""She's probably your friend"". Wrong, don't know her, but I like her.  And I like to write my opinions that's why I'm yelping, and that's why your reading my opinion! Most memorable thing about our server:  1. She was awesome, and once we told her how much she sucked (with sarcasm of course); she confessed that tonight was one of her worst nights.  Now, if this was this girls bad night (she was feeling blue)... I envy those who have her as a server on a good night!   2.  Why go for a hard sell when you can win with a soft one?  Rather than asking "" would you like soup or salad with that"", Ashley warned us that our our meal would be enough without the side, and suggested that we go with the desert instead.  Yummy Pazookie!!!! Much better than salad any-day!  *Go for the Pazookie trio, and sample some different flavors!!! Note: we are a couple of demanding, impatient, picky, and outspoken food critic types, and she gets 5 stars.  The restaurant on the other hand, was pretty awesome, not as awesome as the server, but alright.  Food was great, but the majority of the staff seemed a bit off their game; dropping food, forgetting things, etc.  I also have a problem with the fact that all the servers looked identical!  White, brunettes... just different shapes and sizes.  Short, tall, skinny, whatever... just splitting images of the same person at different phases of life or something... Super odd.  Oh, also no male servers, guess that's because restaurants in general are biased in think that women pull in more cash.  Yeah."
Will B.,"San Jose, CA",21,125,2,4.0,11/17/2011,"We were there with a friend before a movie.  As returning customers, we expected good food and service...and were not disappointed.  My wife and our friend had the pot roast which was excellent.  I had the baby back ribs which were alright.  Not exactly ""falling off the bone"" and a bit tough...but  tasty. I had a ""home brewed"" creme soda.  Outstanding, and the two birthday ladies were treated with vanilla ice cream on chocolate chip cookies to celebrate the occasion. The only downside is the demise of the meatloaf dinner ad sandwich.  One of our all-time favorites, but the waiter (who was outstanding, by the way) said the it just wasn't selling.   Perhaps sometime in the future. Will be be back?  Without a doubt."
Khoa L.,"Morgan Hill, CA",30,2,1,2.0,11/14/2013,Food is good service is horrible. Made reservations and 20 minutes past my reservation time my table isn't even set up yet.
David N.,"San Jose, CA",126,91,20,2.0,7/8/2013,"Second time dining here in the last couple weeks and the service was (again) pretty bad.  To me, this is a reflection of the tone set by management.  Last Saturday (June 29th) I had lunch with my daughter and a friend.  Our food seemed to take forever and eventually the manager came by to explain that they ran out of salmon for my salad and had to cut more.  I asked if the other meals could be brought out along with my salad (minus the salmon) with the salmon when it was ready.  He took care of it (and also removed my salmon and my daughter's dessert from the bill.  This was all fine , except for the fact that the server just disappeared.  Went back yesterday for lunch and again the server would disappear for long period of time.  In addition, the strawberries on my salad were not the freshest."
Deborah G.,"Brentwood, CA",3,29,,3.0,8/30/2013,Just picked up a pizza at curbside service. Great way to avoid the terrible parking situation at this mall. Very convenient. The deep dish pizza was good if you like a ton of bread. Personally I prefer a deep dish that is crusty and crunchy on the edges.This one was too soft but was fresh.
Viet N.,"San Jose, CA",56,161,5,5.0,6/28/2011,"Pizza is the greatest here. P.B.S = Pizza, Beer, & Sports 5 Stars"
Brian T.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,8,1.0,8/17/2013,"Good food, but staff has gotten rude and management figures they are too busy to care.  Called ahead and was they took my name and said 25 minutes wait.  Showed up 15 minutes later and they told me it would be another 40 minutes.  When I talked to the manager was told that the time on the phone is just an estimate to ""get people in the door"" and the wait really starts once you check in.  That sort of dishonesty just isn't worth putting up with so I walked over to CPK instead."
Cherryl D.,"San Jose, CA",362,645,188,3.0,4/2/2010,"My Ratings:   Quantity: 4 - alot Quality: 3 - tasty but some dishes are bland Price: 3 - ok Location: 3 - ok Parking: 3 - dinner can be a problem Service: 3 - ok Speed: 3 - ok My Opinion/Story:  We got there at 7p and placed our name for a party of 10. They only take reservations 24 hours ahead of time. And I think ""WTF""!!! They told us the wait is about an hour and a half, come back in 30 mins to get a pager. Fine, we decided to walk around the mall to kill time. Got back in 30 mins and they gave us a pager and told us the wait will be another hour... yeah right! It was 9p by the time we got to our table. We finally got seated and after 15 mins gave our orders. Got our orders about 30 mins after that and we took about an hour and a half to eat.  By the time we got done with our food it was 11pm. That was the longest dinner I've ever had. The food was mediocre.  The pizza I got was a little bland but crunchy.  The servings for all the dishes were pretty good and some of the tastes were ok.  The service was fine.  Our server was patient and tried to be really accommodating but she was so busy with other bigger groups that she was only able to concentrate on us after the other groups left. Overall: I'll definitely come back to try other dishes but I'll make sure it'll be alot smaller group next time... perhaps just a party of two."
Jenny L.,"San Jose, CA",70,109,25,3.0,2/25/2011,This place is super crowded during the weekends because its packed with people having their birthday dinners there. Expect a long wait if you arrive later than 6pm unless you just want to grab a drink at the bar. Even the bar is packed with people. They have some good selections of their home-brewed beers. The food is okay. Nothing fancy really. I got their grilled chicken sandwich. It was okay. I think it needed a bit more kick to it. I had their cajun pasta. The chicken was a bit bland to me. I think it needed more seasoning. Expect a wait even if you have reservations. We had to wait another 40 minutes to get our table. (for a birthday party of 20-30). The waiter/waitress is a hit or miss. You get the nice/mean ones. There's no actual consistency. They are famous for their pizookie. You get a free pizookie on your birthday. I'm not much of a sweets person but I actually think it's pretty good. It's basically a big fresh cookie with various ice-cream flavors. You can also pick your cookie flavor too. All of them are pretty good. I haven't tried their other desserts besides the pizookies.
