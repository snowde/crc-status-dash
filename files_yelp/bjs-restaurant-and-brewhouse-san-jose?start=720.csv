Emily C.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/15/2013,"Food was average, but the service was really really bad. We felt so unwanted here. No smile, no greetings and absolutely no next time."
Thomas L.,"Los Banos, CA",95,30,23,5.0,6/12/2013,"Me and my Mom love this place - the food is good but most of all the service is exemplary - you can sit and talk and don't feel rushed at all, and the servers are very attentive. It's a nice, reasonably priced place for a drink or a lunch out."
Kelley W.,"Morgan Hill, CA",7,56,,3.0,10/28/2010,"I go here on a semi regular basis and usually the service is o.k.  This time not. My sister, who practically uses this restaurant as her home base even had issues this time.  We got seated and didn't even get asked about drinks for about 15 minutes.  It took at least another 10 to get them and order.  Keep in mind that this is not the dinner rush hour, plenty of available tables.  We ordered.  One of us ordered a sandwich, one soup in a breadbowl, one of those patooie desserts and one soup and salad.  What we got a long time later was the wrong sandwich (twice) one soup (no salad) and a breadbowl.   Of course the items were brought to the table by someone other than our waiter (I hate that practice because mistakes aren't caught right away) so they didn't know what we had ordered or didn't bother to check the order slip.  By the time we flagged down our waiter (he never stopped to check on us, we had to flag him down to get anything) we didn't want the salad anymore or the dessert (he hadn't even put in for the dessert which takes a really long time to put together) and he looked shocked that we didn't want them anymore.  I should have asked him if he wanted the salad from his soup and salad more than a half hour later.   The food is usually good here and the food that we actually got was fine."
Chrissy N.,"Seattle, WA",193,483,13,3.0,5/24/2010,"A chill place to hang with your friends. They can accompany large groups, but if you don't call ahead (they take reservations for groups of 8+ only) prepare to wait for literally an hour++ on the weekends.  The food here is good. I really like the ribs that they serve. Yum! The pizza to me is not cooked well because the middle is always mushy like the dough isn't cooked all the way through. Ewwies. And of course, you must have the pazooki. Duh. Also, prepare for a JILLION high school/middle school kids. So, the atmosphere is SUPER loud."
David H.,"Cupertino, CA",0,83,,2.0,4/11/2013,"We went in for a late lunch (3pm).  The hostess seated us immediately, but we had no menus, water, forks, anything.  After at least 5 minutes of waiting, we hailed her and she took our drink order and got a waiter to take our food order.  The food arrived lukewarm, but edible.  Actually, it was quite good in spite of the luke-warmness.  But no one refilled our drinks.  Once again hailed the hostess, and she got the busboy to bring us refills.  When he took our plates, he asked if we'd like dessert.  We ordered a dessert, and a cup of coffee.  The dessert came, but the coffee didn't come till we had gobbled up that delicious Strawberry Bignet.  Maybe the poor service was because of the time of day, but still....."
Tia F.,"San Jose, CA",88,66,27,4.0,7/16/2010,"BJ's is great when you want a ton, and I mean, A TON, of choices. Plus the pizookie choices are great. The following are my favorites: APPETIZERS: calamari- never rubbery, the batter has a bit of kick to it which I like a lot piranha pale ale nachos- can't go wrong with nachos, always delicious DINNER: Grilled Chicken Pasta- this one is my favorite and what I get almost every single time I eat here. comes with tasty garlic parmesan bread too giant ""classic"" stuffed potato: this pototo is seriously about 5lbs. I like the classic one with just cheese, sour cream, butter, and chives. I tried the chicken one once and it was just too filling for me at least. babyback pork ribs: these are awesome! super tender and their bbq sauce is delicious! DESSERT: pizookie for sure! my favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut!"
Allysa H.,"San Jose, CA",155,107,89,2.0,3/30/2012,"Why people will wait 45+ minutes to be seated for dinner here on Friday & Saturday nights is beyond me. Nothing on the menu stands out to me and even though I've eaten there at least 5 times (not by choice), I couldn't even tell you what I ordered. I'd say it's just a typical chain restaurant with underwhelming food. Not my cup of tea..."
Luân N.,"San Jose, CA",102,118,16,4.0,5/8/2010,"I think the first time I went to this place, all I remember was the pizookie. However, just had a repeat visit last night, and the waitress was very nice in asking her manager to give us happy hour while we dined on the floor. Half price mini pizzas? $5 each? Great deal! $1 off cocktails? Awesome. $2 off appetizers? Woo! I had the Cheeseburger pizza (with pickles) that really did taste like a cheeseburger. And. I. Loved. It. I also had the Mediterranean pizza and while it was a bit heavy on the Feta, I enjoyed it a lot. I tried someone's Southwest eggroll which is chock full of avocado. It's nice that there's a lot (more bang for the buck!), but all you taste is avocado and deep friedness. Ehhh...I'll pass on that. I also tried mozzarella sticks, and those were just standard fare. -1 star only because the price is not worth it without happy hour. Otherwise, we had great service and good food."
Graydon M.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",86,192,30,3.0,1/7/2013,This is your typical bar type restaurant.  I had their New Hop Storm IPA and the double deluxe burger and it was pretty good.  Nothing to write home about but I would stop here again.
Sofi P.,"San Jose, CA",292,398,1038,1.0,6/17/2007,"1.5 This place gets one star for opening up late till 1am and .5  star for being close to my ex's house. Other than that FOOD SUCKS! Went here several times, but the most notable was day before Father's Day. Got steak, fish n chips, ribs. They all tasted horrible. Steak was bland and chewy. Ribs were fatty and when it wasn't fatty the meat was tough. The fish n chips were moist w/ grease. Oh and the avocado eggrolls are disgusting its just a crisp shell wrapped around chunks of avocado Food sucks."
Stephanie T.,"Glendale, AZ",119,260,42,3.0,11/18/2010,"I only like a few selections on their menu. Everything else is either too expensive or just plain nasty. My number one favorite is their New Orleans Jumbalaya for dinner. I usually don't order anything else because I've tried most of the things on the menu. Last time I went here with a few of my girl friends and the waiter was a nice man that always had a smile on his face. UNTIL THE CHECK CAME. He tried to charge us for something we didn't order. We caught it before we put down our money. After we pointed  out the mistake he made, the smile on his face was no longer there. I'm thinking he did this on purpose to get more money. We only left him a few cents for tip because he didn't deserve a good tip if he was trying to gyp us of our money. I forgot what his name was, but I know next time if he's my waiter, to check my recipet first!!! Their desserts are the best, PIZOOKIESSSSS!!!!! Sometimes I come here just for the desserts. Yum, Yum, Yummmmmmm!"
Annie P.,"Gilroy, CA",271,203,2026,3.0,2/21/2010,"K, so I've been here a couple times and personally as a place to eat I don't enjoy the food at all BUT I do enjoy the happy hours they have and I like some of their appetizers. What I ordered: -2 glasses of Barefoot Chardonnay -Avocado egg rolls (I was starving and needed SOMETHING) It wasn't that greaaaat :/ I shoulda went w/the chicken wings -Sierra mist (So poo poo that they don't have Coke products)  Anyway...tell me why our table was filthy and when our waiter brought out our beverages he brought out the wine and a glass of iced water with disgusting pieces of FOOD in it!!!! I wanted to vomit :9 So nasty. To top it off....I didn't even order water, I ordered a Sierra Mist. I understand that was a little mistake and that's not what drove me crazy it was that there was ""stuff"" inside the water. Ahhhhhhh.  Overall 3 stars because I really do love the happy hours :)"
Angelina B.,"San Jose, CA",0,19,,2.0,6/5/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been going to BJ Brewery since they open after the remodel of Oakridge Mall. When we first started coming her everything was excellent! The service was awesome and food tasted great! Up until recently, I would say the past could of months there service went completely down hill. They got a new manager a short mexican guy who obviously does not care about the restaurant or its employees. We had two bad experiences since new management came on board. First time: I order a pasta and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The pasta came out first, of course i was going to wait til his burger came out, its a burger how long could it possibly take. I swear it took 8-10 minutes for the burger to come out! My plate was completely cold and to top it off it was the wrong burger! This was not on a busy night, so NO excuse could make this situation right. When i told the waitress she became completely defensive and said that she only puts in the orders its up to the cooks to get the order right! I ask to speak to the manager and she said ""Hes too busy"" and walked away. My boyfriend immediately got mad and left $15 enough for my plate and our two Cokes.  Second Time:  It took a long time for our waiter to come to our table to get our order. Where we were sitting the manager was directly kiddy corner from us talking to our waiter about the baseball game that was on TV. Me and my boyfriend came back for a Sunday lunch after shopping. I got a soup and salad combo and he got a sandwich. after he took our order it was not a long wait from our food. By the time we got our food, my boyfriend was ready for refill on his soda. The manager and our waiter were talking again. My boyfriend put his hand up and made eye contact with the waiter to come over. The waiter then turn his back on us and continued talking to the manager!! I couldn't believe how rude he was being and the manager did not say anything to him! I told my boyfriend that i would share my drink with him and it will just come out of his tip!(We always tip really good atleast 20% if service is excellent we tip 25% my mom was a waitress her whole life and she taught me to always tip well) so we done with our food. about 5 minutes went by and my boyfriend seen our waiter and once again signaled for him to come over. he went straight to the bar. another 5-10 minutes went by and we are just sitting there! i become extremely anger and walked straight up to the manager and said we have not seen our waiter for nearly 15 minutes. He tells us that our waiter was off work 20 minutes ago. and that he would get the bill! what a douche!! and the manager did not see a problem with it! We will not be going back!! Since this new manager came in its been all down hill"
Cathy N.,"San Jose, CA",438,287,139,4.0,4/2/2010,"Pazookies!! Nom nom nom. If you never tried a pazookie before, you are missing out!! vanilla ice cream served over a giant warm baked white chocolate macadamia cookie...how could you resist such temptation!? Even after eating a crazy stuffed meal, and having the need to unbutton my pants to let my tummy breathe, I still seem to always manage to squeeze this baby in. YUM. anyhow, their meatloaf platter here is my favorite. i get it just about every single time i dine here. it always comes out juicy and flavorful. their pizza is average. the wait time to be seated? horrible! they don't take reservations and this place is always packed no matter when you go! it'll be AT LEAST 30 minutes before you actually get a table. but once you do, it'll be worth the wait!"
Lya H.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,5.0,10/15/2013,We love this place!  Kimmie is the BEST SERVER  that we have had here! She is such a blast and treats us like family!  There is always a good variety of sports on the TV's and the beers are great!
Mike D.,"Shreveport, LA",62,37,1,3.0,6/2/2011,Amazing beer!  Great food!  Horrible wait time. We walk into an empty restaurant and they couldn't figure out where they wanted to seat us and didn't listen when we said we wanted to sit outside.  Brian was our waiter.  He was a good guy.  I am pretty sure it wasn't his fault that our food took for-ev-er.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't his fault that two of our party didn't get their garlic bread either. I liked the food.  I loved the beer.  I am just annoyed that it takes an hour for a couple sandwiches and some pasta to be brought to the table.  Really?  An hour?  In a empty restaurant?  Dinner rush must suck.
Susan D.,"Seaside, CA",605,1122,1076,4.0,5/9/2007,"This place has some of the best pizza - Chicago style deep-dish with ultra fresh toppings!  I always get the Works and add Cilantro to it.  Yum Yum!  It's always busy.  I was there tonight with my boyfriend and we had to wait 20 minutes... yes, on a Tue night.  Good thing it's on the mall, we just walked around for a while and chatted. In the L.A. locations I've also had their ribs, which were good.  I don't care a lot for their dumpling appetizer but their salads are good.  My favorite pizookie is still the regular Chocolate Chunk but it's so sweet I can only eat a few bites.   I like the atmosphere, big comfortable booths with many large TV's that keeps my boyfriend happy.  We can go here if I'm hungry, even when the game is on!  Our service was good, they even traded at shift change with no problem."
Renee r.,"Hayward, CA",1,11,1,2.0,10/19/2014,"so after reviewing some of the Yelp reviews we decided to take my sister here to bring in her 23rd birthday. we made reservations and was quickly seated upon arrival. while we waiting for our other party members to arrive we ordered some appitizeres, once the appitizeres arrived we waited for utensils, plates and napkins, however by the time they arrived we'd already consumed the food with our hands. shortly after the busboy cleaning the table behind me accidently spilled ice water down my ""rear"" i was so mad, but he quickly apologized and got the manager in which my meal was comped. so i was happy with how they redeemed themselves. once our entrees came out my brother who ordered pizza had raw dough at the bottom, they changed his meal to a shrimp scampi pasta, however the sauce was watery, so they changed it to fish and chips and he was happy with that (to accomedate him they comped it for him.) to make matters worse, for my ""comped meal"" i ordered the steak and that was dry and flavorless, but i didnt complain about that. i figured we've done enough complaining already. also the refills for our fountain drinks were coming super slow. i gave the restaurant 2 stars because the managment staff was super nice and understanding, they knew how to recover thier mistakes.  Will i be going back here in the future? no, but kudos to the managment"
Ram G.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/20/2012,"Our family has a worst ever dinner experience @ BJs located at Blossom Hill Road, San Jose CA. The sever was very unfriendly and very bad at hosting the restaurant guests.  Following is our experience at this place along with our visiting guests. * The server did not get the drinks for every body after the order is taken.  Need to remind her several times to get one of our drink. We got this drink after 10 minutes.      * Did not bring enough plates (brought 5 for 6 people) for serving the Appetizers /Starters. Again need to remind her to get the extra plates.      * Did not clean up the Appetizers dishes before serving  the main course and we need to ask for her to clean them.      * Did not bring enough plates again for the main course. We need to ask again for the plates.      * No Ketchup was served with the French Fries Order for Kids. Need to ask the server  again for it. This time she brings the whole bottle of Ketchup with a big attitude.      * No refill of water / drinks was offered for any guests during the entire time.      * The server did not bother asking if we need any thing else during the time we are having the dinner.      * At the end, I have asked her that I need to talk to her supervisor and she told us that he is going come to our table, but never showed up even after we wait at the table for 5 minutes.     * I went to the front reception and saw the manager (Mr. Robert) to share my experience and he showed the very least interest in the whole incident when I am telling him about our experience. Over all we had a awful experience and spoiled evening. I never suggest this place anybody to take your guests / family to this place."
Sharilyn S.,"San Jose, CA",22,40,,1.0,4/7/2012,"This restaurant has terrible service.  The hostesses are never truthful about the wait time and you have to wait over an hour every time you go in there.  Once you are seated, you have to wait another 45 minutes to get an APPETIZER..then another 20 minutes before you get your actual food.  I don't think we will be going there again."
