California R.,"San Jose, CA",37,155,,3.0,4/8/2010,"I like this place. Ive been here to watch playoff games or just have lunch on a weekend and dinner at evening plenty of times. This place has everything big....burgers, salads, and ribs. This location can get packed and than the hotess will give you a buzzer so that when you number does come you than your small device just vibrates for your attention.  There is a full bar and the very good hefenweiser beer served cold."
Eva O.,"Redwood City, CA",27,80,57,3.0,10/1/2012,"After watching a  movie on Sunday  night, we decided to go in for some appetizers and beer to watch the last quarter of  a football game, we had the crisp potato skins  Overall... didn't love it, Beer was good :)"
Lisa A.,"Parker, CO",9,126,12,3.0,1/22/2011,"I really wish I could give BJ's a higher rating because they have a nice resturant, always  clean and inviting and the menu options are varied and sound good. The execution however is all of the place. I can say the dishes I enjoy from them are quite good, but more often then not they miss the mark.  The take out service though is terrible. I have used it 4 times in the last year since having a baby and 3 of the 4 times something was wrong with the order. One time all we ordered was a pizza and while the pizza they gave us was tasty it was not even close to what we ordered. They tend to leave out items that you selected and paid for (like my 2 year old's side dioshes).  It's a nice place to go out with friends for happy hour but bottom line is don't have your expectatinos too high, and check your food before leaving if you use take-out."
Connie C.,"Belmont, CA",5000,1539,1424,4.0,10/27/2009,"BJ's brings back lots of memories of my UCLA days, when BJ's was still brand new and in only a few SoCal locations. It was always our favorite spot to hit up for pizza to-go while waiting in line for opening night movies at the FOX Theater, or late-night grub after a long day of classes. While locations have multiplied since then, I still do love me a slice of their deep dish pizza.  This BJ's is the closest to my house, and while parking is horrible at Oakridge, and there's almost always a wait, at least you've got a huge bar to hang out at, and I can always make a quick run to F21. The staff here is very friendly, and service is excellent.  Their handcrafted beers are pretty good. I like my beers pale, so I prefer their Brewhouse Blonde. We had a taste of their Pumpkin Ale last night, which is a seasonal beer, but I wasn't a big fan.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and there's something for everyone. However, I always stick with my fave: Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Like the menu says, it's for Buffalo Chicken Wing lovers! I love the toppings, and the ranch dressing and buffalo sauce on the pizza is just so yummy.  I used to love the Pizookies, but now that I'm with a guy who bakes cookies better than anyone else, I'd rather have a homemade one! I think they still do a complimentary Pizookie on your birthday, so take advantage of that!"
Mehak C.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,1,4.0,11/9/2014,"Love love love. I have never been unsatisfied with their food and even though their super unhealthy burgers and pazookies are the best if you're going with a friend whose obsessed with their diet, they have some healthy options too. If you have an allergy, there's an allergy menu that can help you order, but don't feel restricted to just those items because the servers are normally more than happy to adjust some of the other dishes to fit what you can eat. The only issue is the restaurant is always soo so so busy, so if you don't make a reservation you're gonna be waiting a long time, especially if it's a Friday, Saturday,or Sunday."
Naomi B.,"San Jose, CA",27,31,38,5.0,1/13/2013,"I had no idea they are open till 1am which can be awesome for a late night snacker like me. Im in love with their buffalo wontons, parmesan crusted chicken and of course the poozokie is a must! They have call ahead reservations if your gonna be in within the half hour which saves soo much time cuz it can get busy. Overall, I love bj's!!"
Milla H.,"San Jose, CA",1,40,33,2.0,5/14/2012,"This review is more about the food than the service. Went with my family on a sunday, we were seated right away.  I've been here before a couple of times and it's never dissapointed me or super impressed me but this time the food was a let down. We got the avocado egg rolls which were good, like always but the entrees.....um....the majority of it was not edible. My bf and I both got steaks, I asked for medium cook,  we only got to eat a quarter of it and the rest was superbly undercooked. For a minute I thought my steak was going to start moooing!!!!  I've seen the movie ""waiting"", so I opted not to have my waitress take my steak back.  I just took it home and regrilled it."
Rez A.,"San Jose, CA",86,24,3,4.0,2/15/2013,"I have been to this Bj's more than 100 times i guess. My gf and I really like the food here. Our favorites are the Avocado  egg rolls, the buffalo chicken pizza, and White Chocolate Macadamia Pizookie. Sometimes the wait to get our food is too long. the food has usually been good. Sometimes they ran out of things and takes forever for someone to let us know."
Rocky T.,"San Jose, CA",29,19,,2.0,4/3/2013,great hangout spot. Food not too good. I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce- it looks like it came out of a jar. 2 garlic bread sticks was like biscotti.
Seares R.,"San Jose, CA",133,91,239,4.0,10/21/2009,"I go here like once a week because my brother loves to go the bar for happy hour. We'dnormally sit in the bar area,  the service there sucks compared to just sitting and eating in the other area. (prolly that's what I get it, or it's just really laid back) I love the food, I love the Sweet onion strings, tender crisp, and the calamari(it's new :D) and i love the dipping sauces :D Tips: But the mini pizza here for 5 bucks during happy hours M-F 3-7, Sunday-Thursday 10-closing) appetizers are also 2 dollars off! (times for sweet onion strings and calamari) The Pizzokies are so awesome. (cookies in a cookie pan with ice cream on top, still awesome)"
Jill G.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/27/2014,"I ordered the new Kale and Brussel Spouts Salad and added salmon. Salmon was excellent, but the salad needs some work. I expected warm brussel sprouts since they were herb roasted, but they were hard and cold. The salad was overly sweet with cranberries, blueberries, grapes, and strawberry vinaigrette.  I would not order it again. My husband got the deep dish pizza. He really liked the crust. When he orders it again, it will be with extra sauce since it was a bit dry. Overall, this was probably our best time there. Our service was better than it has been in the past, but I still really don't like restaurants that have runners deliver the food. Our pizza came, but we had no plates, crushed pepper, etc. The runners never ask if everything is here."
Melate M.,"San Jose, CA",206,24,1,5.0,12/29/2011,"THEEEE best food place EVER!! It's been my favorite since my 1st day of eating there which was years ago and I still go there regularly because I just can't get enough! The staff is friends, the atmosphere is more .. friendly as well. For instance, if you wanted to take your bf/gf to a REALLY romantic place to eat, I wouldn't take her/him HERE .. it's not really a ""let's get dressed up on our 1 year anniversary and let me take you out"" type of place. It's more ""let's go out to eat tonight! I don't want to spend my life's savings on just dinner but I also don't want to take you to Pizza My Heart or Happy Hound so how does BJ's sound"" type of place. The food is ... amazzinnnng and their pizookies are .. RIDICULOUSLY GOOD! :D All & all , you'll loveeeee this place; trust me :D"
Jennelie S.,"Saratoga, CA",33,32,2,2.0,1/21/2013,Meh. I've experienced better... At their cupertino location! I feel like even the food tastes better there. And the wait is not as ridiculous.
Donna Z.,"San Jose, CA",630,557,106,4.0,6/3/2007,"Even if it's a busy night, I always manage to find seats in the bar for 4+ people in under 15 minutes by ever-so-skillfully stalking almost-finished tables.  I don't lurk.  That's just annoying.  I've just mastered the swoop.   Anyway....great drinks (if you avoid the margarita...too much sweet n sour!).  The friends and I love when ""Red"" is our server (sorry, don't know his name, but he has red hair...you get it) because he's totally on point.  Not around enough to get annoying, but always seems to be there when your lemon drop, pint, etc is getting on the low side.   And if you're not just there to drink (what's wrong with you??) the pizzas are all amazing.  The oreo pizookie is also a personal fav.   Oh and during happy hour, appetizers are a dollar off and there are drink specials too.  How could you not love this place?"
Steve S.,"San Jose, CA",111,29,21,2.0,4/12/2010,"We come here for one reason only... The Pazookies.  Our kids love the Pazookies, so we come.  Their regular food though is very salty, but since our kids love the Pazookie... we come.   If you do come here I do recommend the Root Beer and the Pazookie:)"
Cheri M.,"Tracy, CA",106,584,31,4.0,2/3/2010,"This place is BOMB. There seems to always be a wait and parking is horrible but it's worth it every once and awhile. I've had those giant baked potatoes, the spicy pasta dish, a couple of the sandwiches, bbq chicken pizza and they were all really good. Tonight I had the parmesan crusted chicken and it was delicious. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had and the broccoli was disgusting.  Oh and you cannot forget the pizookie! They are AMAZING. The beer is okay. Nothing too spectacular."
Mike N.,"San Jose, CA",28,22,5,3.0,3/10/2010,"I thought BJs served the best foods when I was 18. As I got older, I realized that its just an average place to eat at. It's a fun environment for going with a big group, going on Sundays/Mondays for football games, and going during happy hour...because which place isn't fun for happy hour.  Once again the food is decent. The salads always have too much dressing (remember to ask for it on the side), Potato is as big as your head but I mean who pays $8 or more for that size of a potato. Might as well go to Sweet Tomatoes, pay the same amount and eat unlimited potatoes and salad bar. The chardonnay shrimp pasta is tasty but its very oily.  Lots of people raves about BJ's pizza but I just think its decent. It's not too tasty and its usually soft. I need my pizza crunchy. However, here are the reasons to go to BJs.  1) Pizookie - all flavors are to die for. I love how it's freshly baked out of the oven.  2) Mini Pizzas during happy happy since its half off 3) Chicken Wings - Tasty and crispy 4) Some of the waitresses =)"
Hang N.,"San Jose, CA",74,147,267,3.0,9/13/2012,"Recently had dinner here for a friend's birthday. He was recommended a drink by the waitress, Watermelon Mojito, it was superb! I was more impress with that drink than all the food that we had!! I had the Miso Salmon, and it was quite tasty. The rice is very creamy, so beware of that. A few other dishes we had: santa fe salad, mac n' cheese, shrimp wrap, tuna tartare, pizza, and some pork chop dish. Borderline boring food, all of it. Just get the mojito! oh, and pazooki!"
Jessica M.,"San Jose, CA",47,63,1,3.0,2/26/2013,"I'll keep is short and simple. Food was overpriced and not very original the few times I've gone. Service can definitely improve. I won't write it off completely, but it's definitely a last resort."
Francesca B.,"San Jose, CA",243,182,18,4.0,10/4/2012,"This place is great! My friend and I came here on Saturday night to get drinks, eat and chat. Our server, AJ was attentive, patient, and very friendly where he didn't rush us to finally order after looking over the menu for at least 15 minutes. I ordered the Strawberry Mojito, Garlic Parmesan Chicken Wings, and Bacon Cheeseburger. While,my friend ordered the Mac and Cheese with Bacon bits and the Peach Margarita. First, the chicken wing appetizer arrived but it was boneless. However, my friend and I didn't make huge deal over the mistake order because I was too hungry to even care, and my friend has braces. Overall, I liked the food at BJ's. On the other hand, my friend thought she would enjoy eating her Mac and Cheese. But the entree barely had any sauce and the presentation of the food looked like something that came from the Kraft's Easy Mac kit."
