Lincoln D.,"Milpitas, CA",0,51,,1.0,2/26/2012,I came here with a buddy on a Sunday for lunch. I ordered their chicken fried steak and it took a while for the order to come out. A manager approached us and apologized for the delay and offered us a free dessert. I told him their chocolate cake. The dessert never came and the steak was dry.
Zerrilyn P.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",222,294,663,3.0,8/5/2012,"Came here today for brunch with my bf and brother since they said their tummies were growling haha... The weather was just right, so I asked if we could be seated outside. The menu is pretty wide--everything looked so good, but just having read the calories of each food was pretty intimidating, luckily I found something from the brunch menu that was just a little over 500 calories (still sounds loaded I know, but definately not compared to the 4 digit food items you'll see on the menu haha) For appetizers, my bro and bf ordered the stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari: -Stuffed mushrooms--I only had one, and wasn't really impressed with it--the flavors of the stuffing and mushroom itself didn't blend together--you don't get that simultaneous taste of the stuffing AND the mushroom..it's more like..you taste the stuffing...and THEN the mushroom...hope that makes sense... -Fried calamari--unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with this either--just breaded and fried squid was all it was--no special seasons on it or anything--texture was inconsistent--and top of that...we found a strand of hair on one of the lemon wedges...ewwwww....I told the waiter, and came back with a new plate of lemon wedges...not his fault that there was hair on it, but he should have noticed it on there...clearly visible...I didn't harangue the guy since he had been so nice and attentive to us...he even made a joke about the hair by saying,"" We charge extra for hair on food."" The three of us were just like,""Sorry, what'd you say?"" only because we didn't hear what he said the first time around haha... Took awhile for our entrees to come, but the appetizers were enough to hold us over for just a bit longer...our waiter was so nice to come up to us every so often to update us on our food...I'm guessing the crowds were growing from the inside...I don't know... Anyways, for entrees: -I ordered the baked italian omelette with wheat toast--it's three scrambled eggs with italian sausage,tomatoes,onions,and mushrooms, with a side of wheat toast and hash? (I think that's what it's called)--the guy forgot to bring me some jam with my toast and apologized, and again I didn't nag at him for that b/c I too, forgot to even ask for it...I was fine with eating the toast by itself anyway haha -My bf ordered the fried chicken--laid on a bed of mashed potatoes and corn--from what he said he liked it -Broski orderd the bacon cheeseburger with thin fries--monster burger I tell you...greasy as hell just by the look of it--I'm sure he liked it since he killed it all lol Overall experience at this BJ's was good, just minus two stars for the hair thing and the wait time between appetizer to entree... I've eaten at BJ's at the San Bruno place--don't remember what I've ordered from there since it's been so long since I've eaten there...but the pizookie is always memorable...I've tried all flavors...and all were delish--especially with the ice cream on top...mmm...now I suddenly have a craving for this dessert :)"
Gabriela G.,"San Jose, CA",33,37,35,4.0,10/14/2010,"Located in a busy mall, takes us a while to find parking. Can't believe there is a 40 mins wait on a Thurs night, this place is busy and packed! Nothing can beat their 2 for $20 deal, GENEROUS PORTION (salas/soup, medium pizza and pizookie), which they don't advertise publicly. Also remember to try their avocado egg rolls."
Hong An D.,"San Jose, CA",259,56,8,3.0,4/9/2012,"Always packed so be prepared to wait. Come during happy hour! Pizzas and chicken wings are good, and of course PIZOOKIES!"
Eric H.,"San Jose, CA",320,516,149,4.0,6/9/2010,"Busy busy busy. But I guess that means it's good, right? I like this place because you can come here and just have good beers at the bar with friends or sit down and have a good dinner and beers with friends, either way you win. Plus their Pazookie is awesome then they add ice cream and then it is Pawsome!   All in all I recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy some quality time with old friends or just have some beers and meet new ones."
Bebe E.,"San Francisco, CA",239,107,7,4.0,8/6/2009,"Everytime I eat at this restaurant, I am never disappointed by their service.  My servers are always very personable and charming, even when one of them had ""the table from hell"" in her section and still was a complete sweetheart to me and my friends.   I have to say their cajun pasta is definitely one of my favorite dishes here, as well as their fish tacos.   Last time I was here, I was on a bit of a budget (as it was not payday!) and order the nacho appetizer.  I wouldn't recommend it...too many not tasty chips and not enough toppings.  Though it was entertaining me to have red, blue, and white chips.   GO JEREMIAH RED!!!"
Lee O.,"Santa Cruz, CA",16,293,12,5.0,3/20/2013,My favorite place to eat and drink in the whole world. Its all so good I don't know where to start. Key points are the happy hour in the bar and the point system. I love places that reward you for eating there. I go back every chance I get.
Casey  B.,"Mountain View, CA",2,20,2,2.0,3/9/2012,Me and my friends come here a lot and it's not to say that this is a horrible place. But the staff is less than average and doesn't seem to care much. Don't know if they are understaffed but even when we have talked to the manager we got the impression that they don't really care. Food is average and can't complain. Service is always lacking.
Ann D.,"San Jose, CA",65,53,55,4.0,8/24/2010,"got the Best Beginnings™ Appetizer Combo This sharable platter is designed to delight all tastes. It features a generous assortment of four of BJ's most popular appetizers: Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. around $15-18 They spilt the plates so everything was even for two people expect for the spinach and artichoke dip but they did give us two spoon.  really like  4 avocado egg rolls and the dipping sauce it come with. tasted really nice and creamy the spinach and artichoke dip- you can actually see the chunk of artichoke which my friend likes and the different color tortilla chips  4 mozzarella sticks come with Mariana sauce and the 4  santa fe spring rolls had a nice corn and pepper taste to it with a dipping sauce i got PIRANHA® PALE ALE CHILI CHEESEBURGER* An 8 oz. Angus burger served open-faced, smothered with Piranha® Pale Ale chili, jack and cheddar cheeses and topped with onion strings alongside sliced tomatoes and pickles. Served with wedge-cut seasoned fries. about $10 i got mine well done. it was a little brunt in some place but still pretty good. i had two slice of bread underneath everything. which i dont really get cuz it is a open-faced burger. after a while didnt even eat the bread. just ate the meat and chili-cheese. i like the wedge fries cuz it a thick cut with the skin on which i like. better then the kfc ones. and some of my chili cheese went onto the fries. tram got ANGUS POT ROAST SANDWICH Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables. about $10 she like the Cheddar mash potatoes but the meat remember me of a Salisbury stake with the meat and mushrooms on top. she said the sauce/ gravy was a little too strong to her.  and for dessert BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE® You're never too old to enjoy our freshly baked, hot out of the oven, rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Peanut Butter around $6-8 'they have different flavors like triple chocolate and chocolate chuck but we got strawberry. the pizookie was really good warm and the ice cream on top made it cool down but it was good. we were gonna do a trio but was too full the service was good until we switch services cuz it was now dinner time. but it got crowded around dinner time so i will forgive him for that. the two servers did refill our water on a regular basic and was patience with us when we didnt know wat we wanted to order right away.  total around $46 (includes tax) without soda, we got some water and some sparkling water from target instead"
Brian K.,"San Jose, CA",22,10,17,1.0,4/18/2012,I'm from Chicago and this pizza should not have the Windy City's name attached...  The service at this location is very poor.  You'll see the servers spend more time enjoying the company of their co-workers than refilling your beverage.
Matt K.,"San Jose, CA",3,10,,4.0,2/17/2010,"BJ's is a great place to eat! I often compare it to an upscale Chili's. Their food selection is very wide and the majority of it is very good!  Although many reviewers have had problems with wait times, I have never experienced more than a five minute wait. The waiters/waitresses are mostly attentive and always very nice. Only one time have I had a slow waitress. Otherwise, they are very attentive and quick.  The food is pretty good, like I said before, an upscale Chili's. Their menu is quite diverse, going from pasta, to barbecue, to seafood. The food is never spectacular or mind blowing, but they do a good job. The food can be a bit bland, but still very tasty, and they have huge portion sizes. I can definitely count on taking home leftovers every time I eat here for dinner. (Their lunch portions are much smaller and rarely do I have leftovers.) Overall, I would give the entrees 3 stars.  The Pazookie is a whole other story! It deserves 5 stars. A warm cookie served with ice cream. The cookie is always soft and moist and it very good. I would even consider coming here just for the pookie for dessert.  Overall, the atmosphere is nice and the food is pretty good. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I will definitely be eating her many times to come."
Leza D.,"Campbell, CA",105,180,,2.0,1/19/2010,"I have mixed feelings on BJ's. I've never left feeling I LOVED it...but I also really never felt like i hated it either until last night. Ok hate is a strong word...but I wasn't impressed. It actually made me a little sick to my stomach. Maybe it's partially my fault I'm not a fan of Chicago style pizza anyhow. But this we ordered a peperoni, artichoke, olive and ham pizza and it wasn't cooked all the way through. =( It was pretty doughy and then for some strange reason there was feta cheese on it...EW. The gyoza were decent though. And honestly the appetizers have been pretty good that I've had in the past. I really just didn't enjoy the pizza. It tastes greasy, heavy and needed to cook more. I seriously felt like i had a rock on my stomach when I was done and I only had a piece and a half.  Service also wasn't very good. We did sit in the bar so I know it tends to be a little more hectic. Eh..over all BJ's is ok but I'd pick other places to go over it. And won't ever order the pizza again."
Ly D.,"San Jose, CA",643,402,911,4.0,3/16/2010,"Make sure you have a reservation! Call several times to confirm it, too! The last time I was here, we supposedly had reservations but when we got there, they said we did not. Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait too long since we had dinner a bit early. Crispy calamari & chicken tenders = good appetizers. I love their parmeasan crusted chicken and their chardonnay shrimp pasta! They are well known for their pizookie so make sure you leave some room to try it!"
Ricardo B.,"Truckee, CA",18,13,10,1.0,5/19/2014,"At night the lights are set way too high to set the mood for an evening dinner environment, the one on Coleman is better for dinner ambience. Besides that, well the service was mediocre at best. I went there with my date and was told to sit at the bar area and a waiter would be with us. We sat at a booth and the waiter looked at us and didn't approach our table. After about sitting down for twenty minutes, still no service. We didn't even get a glass of water. At that point I was embarrassed since I was on a date, maybe the waiter didn't care for a gay couple, I don't know. Either way, it was upsetting so I got up and left with my date to The Cheesecake Factory down the road. Before leaving I told the hostess about the ""great""service and she replied with, ""Have a goodnight"" and rolled her eyes as I turned around, according to my date. I won't be coming to this place ever, that's for sure. I'll make sure to spread the word about the homophobic service. #homophobic #rude #disappointed"
Britney L.,"Corte Madera, CA",53,237,257,3.0,9/12/2011,"If you are trying to make happy hour, go EARLY! Happy hour is designated only near the bar. Of course, I made the mistake of showing up at 6 and there were no empty seats or tables to sit at. For regular seating it took over 45 minutes to be seated. Definitely arrive really early during peak hours!"
Brandon H.,Bay Area,662,266,10,5.0,6/30/2009,"Fantastic place indeed.  GO HERE if you're ever in San Jose. BJ's is definitely worthy of a 5 star rating. I had lunch here on a hot Saturday early afternoon after attending a graduation ceremony. Air condition inside saved me from the sweltering heat. The impression I first got upon entering this place was that of an interesting one. Decent service. Wide selection on menu. I ordered a Grilled Chicken pasta and was satisfied beyond expectation. Just a quick in and out but this place can substitute for a hang out spot any day, open bars, open decorated space. Fun atmosphere. AND IT'S NEXT TO A MALL WEE. I want to try the beers here next time since it is a brewhouse. I heard you can sample a multitude of beers for a cheap price. Yes. And the deserts? Nuff said lol. Will definitely make a visit back. I am looking forward to the other scrumptiousness (is that even a word?) this place has to offer! RECOMMENDATIONS: BJ's Favorite Pizze, Chicken Wings,  Blonde Beer, Pazookie!"
Vicky H.,"Milpitas, CA",952,393,328,3.0,3/3/2010,Beer good. Food OK. I like the appetizer here. Thai Shrimp Wraps. mmmhmm shrimps.
Chris T.,"San Francisco, CA",725,593,40,4.0,9/4/2009,"I think I like this BJ's a little better than the 1 in Cupertino next to Apple.  Both are around the same size, but this one is closer by, has mall/movie access, and more parking, even though you might have to walk a bit if there's no parking out front.  Can't go wrong with Belgium beer.  Their sandwiches make good alternatives to the Pizzas if you miss the happy hour specials.  Had that BBQ Beef sandwich last night.  Shit was bomb with some honey mustard sauce on top. And you can't go wrong with a Pizookie for dessert!  Popped my Pizookie cherry over here a few years back after my 21st birthday. Favorite restaurant on the Oakridge restaurant strip."
randi s.,"San Jose, CA",0,23,,1.0,2/15/2014,"What a disaster of customer service, either the people can't count or they just lie to you when you might be seated. We arrived and were told it would be 20-25 minute wait and about an hour later we were told ""oh only 3 people ahead of you and then it was ""oh you are next"". Basically they are trained to lie or they are just not very smart, take your pick. Oh and the food, horrible would be a compliment so I won't give it one . terrible service and just HORRIBLE customer service. Pass!!!!"
Jessica K.,"San Diego, CA",48,35,2,3.0,8/19/2010,"This place can be good or meh depending on your expectations. It's the kind of place where if you can't figure out where else to eat with your friends, you go here. Or if you're feeling lazy and just want to go out and eat at a place nearby, you go here. This place has never failed me, but it's never been like ""DAMNNN that tasted good good."" Service is okay; place gets busy sometimes so be prepared for a wait. When I'm here it's usually because there's some sort of big gathering with my friends, like a birthday or reunion or something. Then this place is good. But for a dining experience, not so much. I will say that I'm in love with their pizookies though...Oreo being my favorite."
