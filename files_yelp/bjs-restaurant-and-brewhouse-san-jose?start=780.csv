Alisa O.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/23/2012,My friends and I came here for dinner before seeing a movie tonight. It was the best dinner out I've had in a long time. We had Francheska as our server and she was awesome! She was so outgoing and had a great sense of humor. She really took her time with our table and gave honest answers about different menu items. Our meals were perfect and we definitely appreciated her help with our choices. I was torn between the boneless wings and the pulled pork. Francheska suggested pulled pork and I explained how picky I was with my pulled pork. She promised I wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't. It's one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had. We'll definitely be coming back and will tell our friends about how much fun we had. This girl deserves a raise!
Kenny P.,"San Jose, CA",660,881,2500,4.0,11/16/2009,"I've been on numerous large group dinner's here in the past, and even with smaller parties of like 4 or 5.  I can say that they do accommodate large groups well but only if you make reservations in advance.  It can be pretty tough getting seated with even a group of 3 or 4 during a Friday or Saturday, the wait would probably be a minimum of 45 minutes.   The beer choices are pretty good here, menu is laid out well for a kid who has just turned 21 (or someone who is not familiar with various brews).  I've tried most of beers here, and even the stout (would not be my typical choice).  As far as the food goes, I usually pick a pasta or a deep dish combo if everyone is down for that.  The deep dish is probably one of my favorite things on the menu, as it is with others.     I think you'd want to come here if you plan to have a large relatively loud group of people eating dinner.  It's a bustling place all night long, and if you want to eat here with a few people on a Fri./Sat. night, it's probably not the best choice.  I had some memorable dinners here when I was in a club back in college, so I'll be nice and give them a 3.5 to 4."
Uyen L.,"San Jose, CA",297,158,53,4.0,5/3/2012,"My bf and I had our anniversary dinner here last night. I ordered the portobello mushroom pizza as usual because its so delicious. A lover of mushroom and cheese, this is like heaven to me. To balance out the carb overload dish I ordered, my bf got the seared ahi salad. Oh my lord, I kid you not, its our new favorite dish. The ahi tuna was seared perfectly, combined with mixed baby greens, cabbage, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avocado, and pickled cucumbers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette. Give it a try and it won't disappoint."
Mickey C.,"San Jose, CA",0,24,1,4.0,7/13/2014,"I love this place! The service is great and the food is equally good. However, I wish we can place reservations as sometimes the wait time is quite long. Other than that, everything is up to par. The family and I love this place!"
Joe C.,"Oakland, CA",56,43,,5.0,7/26/2012,"Well my first time to BJ's I wasn't really blown away... so I didn't really intend to return.  However a friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat and it was a toss up between PF Changs and BJ's... so BJ's it was... What I expected was soooooo much different than what I got.  The food was just alright, but the waitress we had Ashley... ZOMG she was amazing.  I don't think I've ever had such a great conversation with a waitress in my life, just don't ask her about cats... or eat horse radish sauce.....  She was extremely attentive to our table, and even went so far as to say it was my birthday and brought me a pazooki which I have never had before.... and let me just say that is some sort of evil deliciousness.  So if you're in the area, ask to be sat in Ashley's section she's got it going on!!!"
Tee B.,"San Jose, CA",1,47,,1.0,7/25/2011,"Completely appalled.  Well first I will say that the food is decent, the wings are my all time favorite.  The beer is decent (though no longer decently priced!) , but has declined in quality throughout the years.   But my experience last night and the way the managers didn't handle it blew my mind.  I grabbed a drink for my girlfriend and I from the bar and was waiting for a table. Within 1 minute, some guy sitting 15' from me started yelling at me.  I asked him what his problem was and he thought I was staring at him and continued to swear at me and threaten me.  I got an employee to get a manager involved.  He ""investigated"" gave the guy a warning and warned me (who had just got there on a a date and was dead sober) to stay away from him!!!  And get this, they continued to serve him alcohol. Managers here clearly are not concerned about the safety of their guests and employees and by not dealing with violent guests such as this, are encouraging this environment.  Once a great place and great staff, the managers have managed to fire all of the servers that have been there for years who have helped create the once comfortable environment.   Plenty of other great placed to grab decent food, a beer and watch sports out there"
Gervin G.,"San Jose, CA",25,2,1,1.0,11/22/2011,I went here last week with some family to get dessert and drinks...and the place had a bad smell...I think it was coming from the carpet because anytime anyone would walk by...you can take a big whiff of it...it smelled like thy haven't washed or vacuumed the carpet in a long time...yeah never again...=/
Lianne D.,"San Francisco, CA",437,169,122,4.0,5/2/2010,"In my opinion, definitely better than Cheese Cake Factory! I definitely can't wait to turn 21 and try out their beer ;P  Anyways, my friend and I order their skinny french fries to munch on while we wait for food. It was amazing! It's like In-n-out but skinny! Haha, that good :) My friend and I shared a Grilled Chicken Pesto, yumm :) Definitely felt healthy and of course for dessert, my friend popped my pazookie cherry! We ordered the cookies and cream pazookie! I swear its just like gharrideli brownie with ice cream! :)  Definitely will be coming to BJ's again!"
Jenny Y.,"Milpitas, CA",60,126,216,4.0,3/15/2010,"I've been here twice with a big party of people. Great service Good food Clean Call ahead for seating! The wait is just aggravating. Sitting outside waiting for your table, watching numerous people walk out finishing their satisfying meals, SUCK. Pizza, Strawberry Lemonade, and don't forget, PIZOOKIE!"
Katherine L.,"San Jose, CA",99,150,112,4.0,4/16/2012,"I have a new go to order of Bjs and that is the maui glazed pork chops. It is one of the restaurants lower calories plate but it is surprisingly very good. The pork chops themselves are juicy, tender, and perfectly cooked. The glaze is sweet but not too sweet, and the entree comes with boiled green beens and potatoes. The portion size may seem small when you get it, but I think it is perfect, especially to order a to-die-for pizookie ! I don't think you can ever go wrong with a piping hot, fresh out of the oven, baked cookie with ice cream on top. Crsipy around the edges and soft closer to the center. Absolute perfection."
Paulie L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,327,66,5.0,8/31/2009,"We came to this place before heading to the movies. We weren't crazy hungry, some we had sample plate and a small pizza. There pizza were very delicious, the toppling were really fresh.  The waitress was really nice, I let her know that we were trying to catch a movie, she helped us speedy up the order. And I mean ""speed up"" we ate and left about 30mins. That's was awesome. I love the environment...sporty bar like with good food. Kind looks like a first date kind of place...."
Emiko T.,"New York, NY",279,329,100,5.0,5/28/2011,"I've been coming here for years and I must have never written a review about this place because I just take it for granted. Like a favorite pair of jeans that you don't expect to wear out on you because they've been so loyal. ""I'll do write something next time,"" I tell myself. ""For sure I'll review my stellar experience when I get home,"" I often repeat. But my BJ'S Yelp review cannot contain itself anymore and all due to the little piece of ecstasy called the red velvet pizookie. And because it's the only thing on my mind right now I'm starting backwards with dessert. After all...why would you go to BJ's if not FOR the pizookie? It's their gimmick and it works like a charm. No matter if your button is exploding and your pants are suffocating your sides like a boa constrictor, you're always going to order the pizookie. Up until tonight I thought the best and most indulgent pizookie they had was their triple chocolate chip (complete with a Ghiradelli chocolate square and the only one with chocolate ice cream). However, they've blessed the menu with a new red velvet pizookie cookie, and as my beautiful date so aptly said, ""This is what Hawaii tastes like."" She took the words right out of my mouth as I stuffed my own with a big chunk of red velvet and white chocolate chips and melted vanilla ice cream. Holy cow you've never tasted anything so luscious. We were actually angry with ourselves that we only got HALF a red velvet because we ordered a split pizookie with a chocolate chip cookie--such fools we were, but never again. We've found our one true dessert calling and we're never going back. It's like finally finding the love of your life, being smitten at first sight/bite, and you're hooked. The taste lingers and it's calling me back. I figure it'll take me another five workouts to successfully undo the damage from that pizookie before I return.  To comment on the rest of the food, I'd say just as a restaurant in general, BJ's is on par with Cheesecake Factory. It's as if they share the same motto--pile the food on the plate, make it look like a good deal then charge them juuussst enough for them to say ""ouch"" but don't hurt 'em too bad because they need to keep coming back. And that's usually what ends up happening. You define your indulgence as worthwhile and you inevitably go back for more of the same--a kind of fun, very predictable menu with a pseudo-gourmet flair that will fill you up for the next two days. BJ's likes to claim they do deep-dish pizza but if anyone's really dug their way into a real deep dish (Chicago) style pizza will know that BJ's version is like a thin-crust. But hey, I must say they got a great thing going with their Great White pizza. If you try any of their pizzas once, I recommend that one. If you've got a hankering for some cheese and sour cream drenched goodness you should also share the nachos with someone who has a bigger appetite than a quarterback, but if that quarterback happens to be you, then by all means, eat the whole plate of nachos. They're pretty addictive and have got this chili bean sauce thing going on at the bottom of the pile. So if you search for that within the mountain of chips, you've got a pretty tasty combination.  Also, if you're a mojito-lovin', mixed drinks kind of person I highly recommend their Wildberry Mojito which is actually a new drink. Delicious, refreshing, just enough sweetness without being sugary. I ordered two, so, I guess it was pretty damn good. Any other day the Berry Burst cider is awesome. (And if you happen to be a beer fundamentalist by now you are probably scoffing and scrolling your way away from my review after reading about cider, but to each his own. But you seriously don't know what you're missing out on)."
Savannah C.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/3/2013,"We kept telling ourselves about the passed 7 times we would never come back here.  I have a million stories I could tell.... all due to the terrible customer service. Every time we have gone something always goes wrong.  Two out of the passed 7 times a manager has came to apologize to us without us even complaining! That's when you know you have messed up. Appetizers are brought out after entrees, food still cold, water cups never filled, the list goes on and on. The last visit was the icing on the cake. They pointed at where we were supposed to sit, didnt walk us. Table still had dishes and the bill/tip from previous people. They picked the dishes up and never wiped the table. There were crumbs all over which we ended up wiping down ourselves. I ordered a soup which never came out. When entrees came out 40 minutes later (we had a party of 4 and went on a Sunday night) I told the waitress the soup never came out and I didn't want it anymore. She came to check on us when we were almost finished eating and said she's going on a break here is your new waitress. When we got the bill the soup was still on there and I told the waitress to please take it off because I never received the soup. She said she wasnt our original waitress when the food was being ordered so we would have to wait for the other one to come back. I told her I'm not going to sit here and wait for the other waitress to come back that's ridiculous. She ended up just removing it herself that was that. I couldn't believe she told me that I would have to wait.... Best believe we didn't leave a tip. It's really unfortunate because I do love the menu but I won't be returning to BJ's because I am tired of the terrible service."
Tarra R.,"Austin, TX",7,357,38,3.0,5/11/2009,"I will save all of you from a disgusting and horrifying story and just say that Saturday nights experience was one I hope never happens again.   The manager Brenden (Brennen?)  totally redeemed the restaurant from the fault of a customer.  I couldn't believe his hospitality and kindness even though technically they didn't have to do anything for us. We will be back mainly because of the service from Angela, Chris and Brenden."
Pearce C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",3,26,,3.0,8/29/2009,"Pros - Pizookie  - Their fries are delicious Cons - They make you wait a LOOONG time for a table - Food is not good Overall do not eat main dishes here, just go for desert. This place is overpriced and it would probably cost your arm to get a table quickly."
Hello G.,"Los Gatos, CA",101,40,4,2.0,3/22/2009,"It's like a liquor store combine with jack in the box.   Went here about three times because my coworkers ""loves"" to have their birthday here.  I love how the waiter and waitress base their services and mood on how they're feeling that day or even better if they are having a bad day.. you will see it and of course they will see it on the tip if you are getting bad service.  Bj's food are not great, the prices are dead on for their food and the wait is super fantastic i love it.. not really. If you're coming here for dinner you're in for a hand full. Underage kids with their posse, raging angry mothers with their loud mouth kids and of course we cant' forget the tough guys with his groupy going to get a pitcher or four.  They have a good variety on the menu so if you don't like stuffing your face with a pizza try their fish tacos or their salads. I'm not sure what's healthier but feel free to try their huge menu of oh so tasty stuff.  If you're coming here and hoping it's something special it's not but it's food right? food is food eat it and get it out. same thing. whatever makes you guys happy.  I didn't enjoy the service the food is as expected and the people were great.  Enjoy"
Archie G.,"San Jose, CA",1116,1026,42,4.0,3/17/2009,"One of my favorite chain restaurants.  Highlights: The thick crust pizza is delicious. The appetizers are stellar. Their dishes are tasty and looks as if they actually try. They offer super awesome baked potatoes filled with awesome awesomeness inside. Oh and of course, the Pizookie is outrageously good. Lowlights: The wait can be long.  But for the most part, it's worth it."
Vicky T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",446,2659,990,3.0,8/4/2007,"My friend was dying for a pazookie or whatever they are called so we ended up here.  So my over all view-- two stars on food, four stars on customer service  1) decent beer (they have kegs if you order in advance)  2) Onion strings were thin which I like but ridiculously oily  3) My ""halibut fish tacos"" were nothing but some honey mustard sauce on cabbage and two fish sticks.. WTF!!! The ""guacamole"" tasted like it came from a can   4) Their chili cheese fries were tasty  5) their pizza dough is yummy  6) I don't get what the big deal about the pazookie is.. here in Santa Cruz we have Marianne's Ice Cream and Pacific Cookie Company-- so much better hands down!!  They get four stars on customer service:  While we were waiting they passed out mini slices of cheese pizza which I thought was cool. Our waitress was very friendly and actually sounded genuine (unlike the false smiles and overly high pitched ditzy talk). Our glasses were refilled without asking and she joked around with us while ordering.    I am not going to go out of my way to come here... I feel its really expensive for what you get....."
ANONYMOUS C.,"San Jose, CA",13,8,1,2.0,8/10/2011,"I always love their food and drinks, but I HATE their service! Everytime I've been there, I constantly wait for something. Either the food takes way too long or I end up with my drink after I'm almost done with my meal. If you want to go, it's better to sit in the bar area, especially if you just want something small. The best thing there... the dessert sampler! Must try!"
Lauren A.,"Morgan Hill, CA",63,21,,5.0,9/2/2012,"Great food, good service and great gluten free food, beer and desserts!!! I'm very picky about food and service and this place always meets my expectations!!"
