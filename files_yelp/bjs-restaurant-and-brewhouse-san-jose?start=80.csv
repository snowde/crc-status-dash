Leah C.,"Martinez, CA",23,24,,5.0,3/29/2017,"Had the best service from our server Cesar this evening. He was prompt, kind, and did a fantastic job anticipating our needs! Also, it was free pizzookie night and we didn't even know it until we ordered our DELICIOUS desserts! Bonus!"
Daywa H.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",2,8,1,5.0,2/21/2017,"I come to BJ's often, it's a nice restaurant to go to to grab a bite with your friends or family. But, this review is solely for Mark. As many times as I've been here, and the customer service has been alright. It's never been exceptional like it has been with Marcus. Not only did he make sure or table was taken care of by checking in with us often, but he also related to us and made us feel comfortable. Knowing the menu pretty well, made it easy to order. But Mark also offered suggestions to try new things. Which we all loved! Anytime I come Into BJ's I will ask to be taken care of by Marcus! I hope management acknowledges Marcus's great work ethic! He has made a remarkable impact on my experience."
Thu V.,"San Jose, CA",280,16,12,5.0,7/18/2017,"Food was really good and the waiters were really attentive. My friends love the deep dish pizza, and I love the burger. Place is clean. I don't know why this place is only 3 star average, bc it deserves a lot more."
Kalen K.,"San Jose, CA",128,285,14,3.0,10/13/2016,"Yelp says I have checked in here 14 times. That is probably a low ball number compared to the actual number of times I have been here. This is sort of our default Saturday after the kids soccer lunch stop because it is close, reasonably priced, the kids actually will eat the food, and they have beer.  What I HATE about this place is the service can be horrible at times. It can be totally dead, and it can take 10-15 minutes to get our first drink order. 40 minutes from food order to table. Wrong items, etc. The people are always nice, but their process and execution is mostly miss. Consistently. And it is one of those frustrating places where you see 5 workers standing around bs'ing. Granted, they are probably busers or hostesses, but text book example of a poorly managed restaurant.  Some of the food is actually pretty decent. Kids love the mac-n-cheese, the pizza, the ribs, the pazooki. I like the ahi tuna salad and their pizzas are pretty good. I am not a big beer fan in general, but I like several of their brews."
Jenny H.,"San Francisco, CA",543,142,129,4.0,9/17/2015,"This is a pretty solid restaurant for a girls night out or even for a date. The burgers are huge and can fill you up so fast, but they're so delicious. My favorite is the Portobello Swiss burger! Also, get the potato wedges whenever you get the chance. They're incredible.  I absolutely love the atmosphere here. I usually don't like places that have dark lighting, so this place is spot on for me! I can actually see my food and my pictures out nicer as well. :)  The wait can get super long. I recommend calling in or getting a reservation beforehand. We had to wait for about an hour.. And on top of that, the our food took forever."
Tammy L.,"San Jose, CA",57,20,35,3.0,5/1/2016,"It sucks that you can't make reservations unless it's a party of 8 or more. When I called over the phone, the worker told me that I was put on the list, however when I went to check in, he told me it was another 40 minutes.  Their texting system is pretty helpful and accurate. 40 minutes later, we were seated. We started off with calamari and when it arrived, it was such a let down!!!!! It was drowned in oil and abnormally soft, and chewy. We also ordered the traditional wings, because our waitress, Brittney, recommended it as her favorite. Their traditional wings came with celery and with both ranch and/or mild or super spicy sauce. You can pick either one. The mild sauce had an abnormally strong smell, but it tasted great!!! For the main meal, I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with a side of seasoned potato wedges (you can pick between this or crispy fries) and my girlfriend ordered the deep dish ziti. Honestly, the side of seasoned potato wedges didn't taste ""seasoned"". There was really no difference between the potato wedges and crispy fries. Overall, I really enjoyed my burger - mainly the BBQ sauce!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU DONT MIND 1200 CALORIES. When I tried the deep dish ziti, it tasted like a pizza in pasta form. It's actually new to the menu, and well worth the price, if you're looking for something really cheesy. After the group finished all our meals, we ordered the monkey bread pizookie and salted caramel pizookie - the waitress put both of them on the house because it was my friend's birthday. The pizookies are definitely why people come here. After our meal, the waitress brought us our meal, and though they didn't incorporate tip into the price, their receipt does show the calculated 10% and 15% tip wages. No pressure, I guess. Would definitely come back, but the waiting staff seemed to be in a rush constantly."
Janice C.,"Sacramento, CA",1,48,3,4.0,7/27/2017,"Not bad. So,  not all of the food turned out the way we liked.  Appetizer  came out after our main course and was cold.  Churro pizookie had absolutely NO cinnamon and sugar on the churros.  Our water was only refilled once.  The waitress comped our appetizer and took our pizookie back to sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar.  She also honored our coupon without looking at it.  So,  at least the service was great."
Jackie G.,"San Jose, CA",12,35,3,5.0,3/19/2017,Besides this place always being packed its great. I have been to this one and the one in Newark and out of the two this is the better one. I live near Oakridge so i come often and have awesome food. When I go to Newark their management sucks so bad. In fact my coworkers have gone into screaming matches with the managers there. Unfortunate since our agency holds so many luncheons here!
Cindy L.,"Sacramento, CA",47,5,,5.0,4/16/2017,"I love servers that go above and beyond and are all about 100% customer service. That's exactly how every restaurant or retail store  should be. I love being treated with so much kindness and I absolutely loved that our server didn't just take our orders, but he tried to get to know us as individuals.  Sean was the best server I've had so far."
Dan M.,"Milpitas, CA",1,4,,5.0,3/22/2017,"Best service I've ever had at BJs. Our server, Katie, was definitely the best I've had here! If you ever go I would recommend her as your server! Would come back next time and ask for her!"
Tina L.,"San Jose, CA",5,59,25,3.0,10/2/2016,I hate the long wait but it's always yummy. The buffalo wings are too salty for me but everything else is pretty good still. I love their pastas as well and my boyfriend got the steak so we got clam chowder with it. It was a little too salty for me as well. Overall I'd come here again because of the nice staff and the ambience. Hopefully my food isn't too salty next time!
Dalena D.,"San Jose, CA",1,5,,5.0,4/2/2017,"Mine and boyfriend's go-to dinner place. The food always comes out quick and the servers are always friendly. When I need something & I don't see my server, someone will gladly help out or get them for us. I always order between their Atlantic salmon (LOVE THEIR RICE PILAF) , chicken alfredo & of course their build your own pizzas. Also, a great place to bring your kid as well. It's not too quiet where you're worried that people will notice your child and it's not too loud that would startle or arouse them. I love this location especially. Plus, it's at  the mall so you can roam around when you're waiting for a table."
Philip M.,"San Jose, CA",12,147,79,5.0,10/6/2016,"Celebrated my bday dinner tonight with a party of 8. Decided on BJ's because I've seen so many posts in the past with pizookies that I had to try one for myself. The food and pizookies did not disappoint! Had the black & blue cheese burger and really liked it along with the crispy fries. 5 stars for food & service. Biagio was our server and he was super attentive, friendly and our whole party enjoyed his great service."
Glenn W.,"South San Jose, San Jose, CA",12,1,,4.0,7/13/2017,"Woody & Joyce - always get the best from here. Bar service is excellent, Rayna is the BOMB, good people hang out and we have a good time.  Only downside is it's usually 64 degrees in the joint."
Nique A.,"San Jose, CA",6,48,2,1.0,1/16/2016,"I had BJ's via delivery from the Door Dash app because just a week prior, I attempted to order via Eat 24/Yelp Delivery, and I received a call from them nearly 30 mins later stating that they were shutting down early due to ""1 hour+ wait times"".   I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts, BJs Brewhouse Burger w/ a turkey pattie instead of beef & thin fries for myself, and a Bacon Cheeseburger (medium well) & thin fries for husband. All items were a disappointment. The driver took the initiative to call and let me know he was still waiting almost an hour after I placed the order, so when the food arrived it was lukewarm  (not the driver's fault).  My turkey burger was clearly a processed/frozen frisbee pattie with no flavor as opposed to fresh ground turkey meat, and appeared just literally thrown together. My husband's beef burger was dry and cooked well done despite ordering medium. The brussel sprouts were the biggest disappoint, as I was looking forward to them since having them once before. The  brussel sprouts were burnt black and completely inedible (see pic). Like, why would they even plate those?! I can't say I'd never come here again because they have great beer, and decent food as far as dining in. However,  I'd definitely NEVER do take out or delivery again because they clearly take it for granted and skimp because they know you can't send it back."
Sean M.,"Dublin, CA",432,474,621,2.0,1/10/2016,"I have to say that a 2 star could be considered generous given the experiences I've had here. I will give 2 stars because the menu is decent (and relatively veg friendly) plus the beer options are good.  Aside from that the service is mediocre at best. Quite typically the service is totally and completely sub par.  You have to wait endlessly to get a table quite often. The bar is terribly crowded regularly. The ambiance is douche bag ""bro"".  Overall, I'll take my money elsewhere."
Steve P.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/3/2017,"I was pleased to get seated right away at 5:30pm on a week night. Unfortunately everything took a long time to get after ordering. When we finally received the food, the french fries were cold and the salads tasted like they were prepared hours earlier. After waiting for desert for 30 minutes the waitress informed us that the waiter had accidentally dropped it on the floor and asked if we wanted to wait longer for a replacement......Won't be back for a while."
Jessica R.,"San Francisco, CA",70,21,4,5.0,1/30/2017,"We have been to this Bjs on several occasions recently and always had a lack lustered, unfriendly dining experience. But since we were shopping in the mall we were hungry for pizza and some beers. We agreed to give Bjs one last chance. We sat at the bar on a semi busy night and were greeted right away by Erik the bartender. he was personable, professional, and engaged in us as customers. Gave us great happy hour suggestions and answered several questions we had about pizza toppings. This employee has single handedly restored our impression of the Bjs brand and will specifically only sit at this locations bar to enjoy his service again. Yelp is mostly for complainers and trash talkers clearly but I felt it important to give credit where it is due. Hope to see him here again on our next visit."
Leslie R.,"Palo Alto, CA",141,20,49,5.0,2/13/2017,"I have to give recognition to the bartender Erik C. since we came into the restaurant the other night, we asked about an old sandwich that we had in the past on menu and Erik was quick to inform us that we could still order it (California Chicken sandwich). He happily confirmed our order and communicated it to a manager about the trickiness of making it so that it would come to us right. Unfortunately it did not come out correct and needed to be remade. Eric was very sympathetic and handled the problem with top priority for us which we appreciated. The manager in the end even comped the item entirely due to the problems we had over it which wasn't necessary but appreciated nonetheless. We only sit at the bar when Erik is working since he seems to be the only bartender that shows genuine care and concern for us as customers. Thank you BJ's!"
Eileen L.,"Sacramento, CA",338,239,226,2.0,11/17/2015,"BJ's food is always consistent throughout the locations, I would rate the food a solid 4-stars. Certain items can be a bit prciey for the portion, but their pizzas and beers are divine. The service on the other hand, varies per location. This location has the worst customer service of the 5 BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse locations I have visited in Northern California. The waitstaff seem to be bothered right when you walk through the door. They don't seem that friendly and they do not like to smile. One time, my unenthusiastic server took my order frowning the entire time. And continued to do so when there was a food run or answering our questions when we needed assistance. I've worked in food service, I get it, it sucks sometimes. But you gotta stick it through and provide exceptional service if you're getting paid for it. Granted, I came here with a party of 15 and had gotten another server, who seemed to be a bit more friendly and kind. It's really hit and miss, which is rare considering I usually get awesome service at BJ's. Location is convenient, it's located right in the midst of a large shopping mall. Great for hungry shoppers who need a bite."
