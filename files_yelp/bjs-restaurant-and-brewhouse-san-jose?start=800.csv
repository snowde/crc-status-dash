Michael H.,"Pittsburg, CA",42,271,7,4.0,1/26/2010,"One of my cousins introduced me to this place a while back and now I've made it a habit of coming by here with the wify on occasion. While it's menu and look is different from the BJ's I used to frequent when I was living in Las Vegas, it has the same great tasting beer. As in Vegas, I'm a big fan of their Jeremiah Red. The only downside of this place is that the outdoor covered area is non-smoking, so you have to go all the way outside to smoke and then you're directly in front of the entry way of the mall, which is an odd place to direct smokers too in my opinion. It should go without saying that because of the location of this place, whether you go during the day or in the evening it's always going to have a decent crowd, so be prepared to wait a bit before seating or sit in the bar area."
Amie D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,30,,1.0,9/29/2011,"Came here for dinner a while back on a random weekday evening. I was so disappointed with the service. First, our waiter doesn't come for about 15-20 minutes after we are seated. That is okay since we have water...I guess. He comes and introduces himself and then something must have caught his eye across the restaurant, he completely zones out in the middle of our order and runs away and says he will be right back. He comes back another 10 minutes later. Finishes taking our order. Food comes out maybe 30 minutes later..COLD. Are you kidding me? I can understand if it's busy and all, at least make up for it in your customer service. Everything was lacking. Worst service ever. We made them take the food back and re heat it- did you guys just stick it in the microwave? That took another 20 minutes.  I usually love BJ's but customer service is lacking at this location. Disappointed."
Stine H.,"San Francisco, CA",201,478,198,1.0,3/1/2009,"PLEASE! I NEVER WANT TO WAIT AGAIN. I suggest if you're really craving your deep dish pizza or whatever it is...ORDER TO-GO PLS. The wait is dangerously CRAZY and causes you to break into bar fight mode and want to back hand some beezys. No matter how big or small your party, expect to always wait a good TWO hours before being seated. God have mercy."
Ravi V.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,39,,1.0,5/30/2012,"I would go to the other BJ's in the area - Fremont or some other place since we had a bad experience at this place with the HOSTESS. We were told upon arrival that the wait time is 25min and the same time (25min) every single time we went back to them and after about more than an hour of waiting , we went to PF Chang's (across this location)."
Stephen N.,"San Jose, CA",163,173,2,4.0,2/1/2010,"Wow, how is this place not a four star restaurant?? I hope my review is a step in the right direction. If you like Hefeweizen, you have to try theirs! It is awesome here, my family actually orders the keg of hefeweizen for our family parties every once in a while! (YEAHH you know we get down) The food is good--- pizzas, potato skins, calamari, burgers, and of course.... the PIIZOOKIE ( a huge fresh out of the oven cookie with ice cream on top)"
Yennhu N.,"San Jose, CA",221,14,,4.0,7/20/2012,One word. PIZOOKIE. It is a must. The sole reason why I come here so often.
Chrese D.,"San Jose, CA",7,84,,3.0,8/7/2009,"Cons: - Okay service, never great - Waiters are always super slow  - Long wait, you can call ahead if you don't want to wait. However, one time the phone person made me hold for 6 minutes because he forgot about me so I had to hang up and call back. tsk tsk  =[ Pros:  - Open late - Food is yummy, they have a large menu - I love their pizookies and the texas style chicken fried steak - Best strawberry lemonade =]"
Erin V.,"Sacramento, CA",2,127,14,2.0,10/17/2011,"Logistical Nighmare.  I know its not a review of the restaurant per say, but they did pick the location.  I cannot stand Oakridge Mall and its parking maze.  Plan on 30 min on the weekend to find a place to park.  Our meals were reasonably priced at under $13, but its $7 for valet parking.  Or spend 30 min in gridlock parking hell.  Other option is to pack your car as if you were sneaking folks into the drive in movie and pay for valet.   Atmosphere is LOUD, very LOUD.  If that's your thing then you'll be fine.  It gives me a headache every time.   Servers were very polite.  And they were extremely patient with our older guests.  If they hadn't forgotten my Marguerita I'd have given the service 5 stars and the dining experience 3.   Food was OK.  Yeah it was good, but nothing I could not produce at home, myself.  It is fairly priced for what it is.  Given the location, I can get similar or better food in a lot of other restaurants at the same price point."
Trang N.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,,2.0,7/1/2012,"The two stars is for the decent food and the ok server. However, the wait is way too long even when you make reservations. I called and made reservations and they said the wait was 20-25 minutes. I arrived 10 minutes later and now they said the wait was 35-40 min wait?! Whats the point of making reservations when it is pointless? The only way you can beat the rush is if you know someone whp works here because I witnessed two people who were able to get seated immediately while the rest of us waited for 35+. There was also a party who waited over an hr and a half. If it wasnt for the good food this place would be done. Shitty service and rude hostesses.  Be prepared for rudeness and hostesses who are incompetent."
Myles G.,"Richmond, CA",49,75,,4.0,1/6/2010,"I always enjoy going to BJ's and my trip here last week was probably one of the better visits I've had.   So I came here last Wed and the whole area was crackin'.  When we walked in, we saw a bunch of people waiting and asked how long the wait would be.  We were told one hour so we decided to pick up some stuff from Target while we were waiting.  After 20 min, we came back and asked them how far we were from being seated and luckily we were able to be seated right away! The food is always good here.  They have these huge baked potatoes which will definitely fill you up, as well as, sandwiches, burgers, entrees, and pastas.  Our main goal for coming there that night was to get their famous PIZOOKIE!  What we ended up ordering was the Pizookie Trio which is three smaller pizookies on a plate.  It's good if you want to try a variety rather than your usual.   I'll always come back... there's no question!  Also, try their BJ's Irish Root Beer.  It's their home-brewed root beer with bailey's and a few other liquors.. it's really good!"
Rosario G.,"Fremont, CA",0,8,3,4.0,10/4/2013,"I absolutely love BJs Brewhouse ! My boyfriend and I visit another location at least once a week for dinner and drinks . My experiences have always been wonderful and the service we've received has exceeded our expectations .  The drink I always order would be the Double berry , it's a blend of a beer and cider I believe . The first few times I had this drink I fell in love . And I regret ordering anything other than the Double berry ( not that the other drinks aren't great) I'm just a creature of habit and once I find something I really like I stick with it . Now this past week I visited my closet location twice , both times ordering a double berry . On my first visit it seemed off but I didn't think much of it . And then again on my second visit it didn't seem quite right . Again I over looked it and thought maybe it's just my imagination . Now on Thursday I was in San Jose for a comedy event and went to BJs for dinner in Oakridge . I ordered a double berry as usual , and was definitely disappointed . The consistency of the drinks on my last 3 visits were very off . I absolutely loving coming here for dinner , my food is always great and the service as well . I would definitely give 5 stars if drinks were more consistent."
Carrie F.,"San Jose, CA",3,8,,1.0,8/22/2012,"We went for lunch and were seated in a booth in a section that the waiter was feeling overwhelmed. He made it very clear he did not want to serve us. After a half hour wait for a salad and a sandwich he finally brought it. The warm sandwich was cold as well as the sides.  We spoke to the Manager, Tina who said all the right things but we didn't get a feeling that she was sincere. Needless to say we will never return to BJ's. There are so many yummy places to go in Oakridge Mall why waste time in a place with horrible service?"
Patricia A.,"San Francisco, CA",86,594,5,2.0,8/27/2011,"Ok This is the bad review that has been ruminating in my head and now its coming out.  First, zero gretting inside the door on a Saturday afternoon Second, Bar is covered in leftover plates  Please note the bar is maybe 10 feet long and the ""woe is me bartender is claiming its busy with less than have the bar area full"" Thirdly, Sticky and slow to clean again the bartender does have about a 20 by 10 area to maintain but is calling for reinforcements. Fourth 15 minutes before bartendar acknowledges my existence Fifth Another 20 minutes for an Arnold Palmer...THE BARTENDER COULD NOT MAKE AN ARNOLD PALMER she asked one of the waiters to do this...... Sixth the suggestion she made was a messy burger where the actual size of the burger was chopped meat that was maybe four ounces Seventh the bar remained unclean for a full 45 minutes I was there Eight: Bartender gave EXCUSES for not being up to par.  This is while the bartender is HAPPILY chatting away with the waitstaff I would give 1 star but I have hope that management can change this faster than their staff can make an LEMONDADE and ICE TEA drink"
Eileen H.,"San Jose, CA",94,73,23,2.0,6/10/2009,"I just ate dinner at  BJ's with a close friend.  For a Wednesday night they had terrible customer services.  Our first waiter went on break without telling us and so they brought out our food late.  My BBQ chicken sandwich was NASTY.. inedible. I tried the chicken sandwich at other locations before and they have tasted fine, but not here.   The only good thing about this place is you can hangout with your friends and have a drink, but I would not come back to this BJ location for dinner again."
andy n.,"San Jose, CA",2,21,,4.0,6/8/2010,"One of my favorite bar restaurants. They have the PIZOOKIE which is the best dessert ever made. and NO its NOT JUST A COOKIE!!!!!!!!   On the other hand, don't expect GREAT food here. I mean, I like it better than lets say, Chili's or Applebees (gross), just to get you an idea of what kind of foods I like. Their pizza is good, thick doughy bread if you like that kind. They got the biggest baked potato in the world.  Everything else is decent. I tend to lean towards the fettuchini, lettuce wraps, jambalaya and wings. Actually the wings are awesome. Lightly sauced with dip so they are crunchy. Lettuce wraps are good. I'm not a big fan of their beer though, but they got a good enough selection to chill out with a big party."
Tone P.,"San Francisco, CA",627,21,5,4.0,2/25/2012,Great selections and good for family fun or a night out with friends. Great place for watching sports.
John H.,"Milpitas, CA",347,112,89,4.0,11/14/2009,"I went her last night with 2 of my closest friends to watch the Lakers vs Nuggets game... Lakers disappointed me but BJ's didn't. =D Warning: This place is crackin' on Friday nights. I called around 7PM to get on the list to get a table and the girl said it would take 45 minutes. We get there at 7:30PM and didn't get seated till 8PM. Very busy place. =) I wanted to stay for the entire basketball game so I started off slowly with just chips and salsa for me. My other two friends got a pizza and sandwich. I don't know exactly how their foods came out to be but I'm sure it was fine since they didn't say anything bad about it. I did happen to try the pizza but I don't remember what the exact topping was. As for myself, I got a Hefeweizen beer, chips and salsa, calamari(new item), and shared a chocolate chip Pizookie. The Chips and Salsa were good, as always. Their new menu item, calamari, was actually pretty good. The batter that they fried the calamari had a nice crunchy texture to it and the sauces they provided were satisfying but nothing great(white and red sauce). The chocolate chip pizookie was awesome too. The cookie was nice and warm along with the contrast of some cold ass vanilla ice cream... YUM. Lets just say this experience last night was a pretty good night except for the fact of the Lakers let down."
John P.,"Hollister, CA",2,48,,1.0,7/18/2009,I have to give it something so 1 it is... This place is without a doubt the WORST place I've been to in San Jose. I had to re order my wedge cut salad 3 times to get a fresh cut of lettuce. Ever time it came out it was from the prep done @ 5:am ..  I also ordered the NEW shrimp lettuce wraps. They went back 2 times and came the 1st time cold then 1/2 raw the last.  If you go to this Cafeteria Style Food Joint. You deserve what you get. Oh the 1 star is for the beer. It was good.
S C.,"Mountain View, CA",77,164,293,4.0,1/7/2012,Just stopped in for a nightcap - black/tan and some appetizers.  Great service and good food.  Decent wide screen TV for watching games.  Worth a visit.
Nicole F.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,9,13,1.0,2/2/2013,"SUCKS!! Called ahead to skip the wait, only to have the punk seating host say that ""really doesn't help much"" now we got a buzzer and were told ""just under an hour wait"" ....but 1 hour and 25 min later, there is still one more group before us. How hard is it to under promise/over deliver!! So frustrated with this place, I'm sticking to the Cupertino location, despite their crappy parking arrangement!!"
