jenn w.,"San Jose, CA",142,745,541,4.0,9/22/2009,"The pizza and beer here is not bad!  It pizza always comes loaded with tons of toppings which I love and the beer is always cold.  But the pizookie is the real reason to come here!  You cannot beat a warm baked cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  The only thing that sucks is having to pick only one pizookie to get, because I want to eat them all.  Oh, and the long wait also sucks.  This place is always packed, and the little beeper does not work inside the mall."
Jesse D.,"Redwood City, CA",314,55,,2.0,3/22/2009,"SO. You'd think with how often I come to this damn place it'd be a 5 star place for me. NOPE haha -1 Oakridge parking is terrible. -1 The wait can be fairly long if you go on a busy night.  -1 Because 95% of the time I come here, the service is TERRIBLE. For instance. One time we were seated, waited around for a good 25mins. Had to GET UP and ask for a waiter to come and take our orders. The waiter had not even checked in with us at ALL after we had been seated! We would have been a bit more sympathetic if it had been a busy night. But it was NOT. We even saw a few of the waiters/waitresses standing around and talking! So then, why do we come here if it's rated so crappy? Well, whenever we come now, we expect to wait, to have crappy service, and to have a hard time parking (gogo valet parking!). Usually when we head here, it's just the guys, leave the women at home, run to the bar right when we get seated, and get a pitcher for ourselves, order one from the waiter, so by the time the terrible-service-waiter/waitress brings us our pitcher we're done with the first! It's a great place to hang out, drink a few... pitchers, be loud, and have some grub. The food tastes fine, and is priced well. Although I only give it 2 stars, it's still one of the top places on my list to hit up when the guys wanna go chill."
You B.,"San Jose, CA",0,14,,4.0,7/18/2012,"My ONLY real complaint is that its way to hard to get a table. Most time when we eat there it's spontaneous so I would not have thought about getting reservations, if they even take them. We end up at a table by the bar most of the time. The kids love it - all the TVs and thank God for the beer.  Servers are inexperienced and need to greet faster, but did I say Thank God for the BEER?"
Pablo J.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,141,,1.0,6/22/2011,"I've been here at least twice before (once with a group of 20 and once with just my family), and I wasn't particularly impressed by the food or the service then. But against my better judgment, I had lunch here yesterday with a friend and immediately I was reminded why I did not like this place. The table we got was dirty. It had crumbs all over it left by whoever sat there last. There was no silverware (we had to beg for some later on), and the stickler for me: THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. WE WERE IGNORED. No one paid attention to us, and we waited at least 15 minutes before someone stopped by to get our drinks order. Waiters were whizzing by but it took ANOTHER 15 minutes to get someone to take our appetizer order. Then YET ANOTHER 20 minutes to place our actual order for food (which I'm telling you right now is NOT worth your hard-earned money). The entire experience SUCKED GOAT BALLS. What a waste of money."
Will D.,"San Francisco, CA",11,483,,4.0,1/30/2012,"This place is good if you want a little variety in their menu. None of it is high cuisine, but it's pretty diverse so you can find something. This place is awesome for their beer. I recommend the Tatonka stout or the Jeremiah red ale. Both are really good. The root beer and orange cream are also super tasty if you don't want alcohol. And if you like craft beer check out their imports/belgian menu. My only complaint is that people don't seem to be ordering the belgians (you're doing yourself a disservice people) and sometimes they are spoiled. BJs needs to check their stock and keep it fresh."
Carlos M.,"San Jose, CA",354,8,,2.0,7/1/2011,"About 5 months ago i went in with my fiance, son and our family friends out for lunch, and there was not that many people in there. the service was slow i asked for ranch 3 times untill i got it. but other than that we got food poisoning and my 1 year old son at the time got it too... just for that i will never go back there again i give it 2 stars just because i know the service could be alot better."
John P.,"San Jose, CA",384,209,679,3.0,3/2/2009,Food was OK.  Prices were good for happy hour at such a popular place.  Eat near the bar and you get orders pretty quick.  The parking is a nightmare and I'd pass on this only because I can't stand cruising for ten minutes to look for parking three blocks from where I want a beer.
Lyn C.,"San Francisco, CA",116,1169,22,1.0,11/12/2008,"BJ's= AWESOME BJ's at Oakridge= SUCKS! This review is only for the oakridge bj's.  Note, I have been here before and had a pleasant time, but after this incident, i will boycott this place. Made a reservation (on a Monday night!) for 7:00.  Did not get seated till shortly after 7:30.  Our waitress, Denise, was unpleasant.  She was rude on many accounts: 1.  Yes, I understand we had a big party and we're rowdy young adults, and I suppose she's hard of hearing but she scolded us twice for being too loud because she couldn't hear what's going on.   2.  She informed the girl sitting next to me that her jacket fell on the floor and she had stepped on it.  However, she didn't bother picking up the jacket. 3.  We were seated in the outdoor/covered area.  Sorta like a tent extension to the restaurant.  Something kept dripping on the people who sat closest to the wall.  When we informed Denise, all she could say was ""Lucky you! You're in the drip seat!"".   4.  While trying to clear the plates, I was still picking at the last of my pizza.  I'm a firm believer in not wasting food, so I wanted to finish what I had even though I was extremely full.  She tried to take my plate from me but saw I was still eating and then mocked me for trying to finish my food. I found Denise to be so rude that although I usually love this restaurant, I would opt to go somewhere else if I had the choice, especially if she was our waitress again."
Linda L.,"Campbell, CA",221,334,45,2.0,12/19/2008,"If Yelp worked better on my Treo and if I wasn't feeling game, I would have skipped this place in favor of something more solid. Alas, not to be.  DH and I were out doing our last bit of holiday errands, found ourselves out in Blossom Valley and decided BJs looked interesting.  Initially, we were seated at a small table in front. However, we were blasted with arctic air each time the door opened/closed, so we moved to a not so chilly table.  Service was on par and very solid. The quality of our meals is where points were lost (along with the piece of hair wrapped up in the napkin with the silverware).  DH ordered a Caesar salad and clam chowder soup. He commented that he soup was very fishy. The salad unmemorable.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger w/fries. The bacon was undercooked and chewy, so off the burger it went. Pass on the bacon. The bun was solid, but the toppings could have been fresher, as they were a bit limp. The meat was good quality, although just a tad too over seared. About halfway through, the charcoal flavor dominated.  The fries were uninspiring and undercooked. Pass.  We also ordered a side of onion strings. These were quite possibly the worst onion strings we have ever encountered. Soggy, limp, undercooked and seasoned with an array of flavorings that just don't work well together. Pass.  The menu is huge and overwhelming - but perfect if you're there to nosh with several friends."
Susan B.,"Salinas, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/24/2012,"Went to BJ's last night in North Salinas  - not a long wait which was good but the rest was not so hot-Waitress was friendly and seemed to be on top of things but my order did not come as ordered.  This exact thing happened the last time I ate there for lunch.  Also, our appetizer was delivered to the wrong table and our waitress never noticed- we had to bring it to her attention. The appetizer  was brought to table with dinner!  Food was so so... - can not really recommend unless you want drinks only!"
R L.,"Santa Clara, CA",7,54,2,1.0,1/29/2011,I hate  BJ's Brewhouse. I used to go here all the time with my friends and now i will never go again. I ate a pizza there and became very very ill from food poisoning. it was the only thing I had eaten that day and within an hour of eating there is when I became ill. I wont go into the details of what happened to me during that night and the 5 days after but I did have to go into the ER to be treated. It took 5 days to even start to recover. I called the manager at the restaurant to inform him of what happened. The manager could care less and offered no sympathy at all and offed nothing o compensate me for my trouble and nor the cos of going into the ER and the cost of the meds i had to take. I wrote 2 letters to main corporate office and have never had a response from them. Now my friends and I have boycotted BJ's forever.
Ant's M.,"San Jose, CA",8,24,4,1.0,6/14/2012,"Seriously, the hostess sucks! If you tell me it's a 5-10 min wait, that's cool, I'll make the decision to wait or not. Don't tell me there are "" more than a couple booths in the bar"", when there is only one and it is dirty, still with dishes.  When I went back down to tell her, She said I could find someone to clean it off?!  SAY WHAT?!"
Danny K.,"Cupertino, CA",188,285,62,4.0,3/25/2009,"I think this is one of their biggest BJ's (I've only been to 3 other).  They have a solid bar with multiple flat screen TV's (one extremely large one in the middle).  It gets packed here for sporting events (Sunday football, good luck getting in).   Pizza is the stuff to get, large portions, thick crusts, and most importantly - they taste good! But before you dip into the pizza's you've gotta get their hot wings!  Probably the best hotwings I've had next to Hooters.   This is the place to go hang out with friends and have some beer!"
Nilam P.,"San Jose, CA",62,76,21,4.0,4/23/2011,"Waiter was awesome but the guy who showed us our table totally ignored us. I always get the pizza (awesome) and pizookie. Unlike the Cupertino location, the pizookies that I get here are always perfectly soft and delicious."
Angel G.,"Union City, CA",227,205,122,4.0,2/3/2011,i must admit.  This BJ's is the best by far...the staff was attentive maybe a little too attentive.  Work for that tip damn it! haha but really the waiter made sure we were ok.  made sure the food was ok.  made sure our glasses were full and made sure we were satisfied with our pzookies! i will definitely come back
diane d.,"San Jose, CA",186,69,26,4.0,11/7/2009,"I LOVE THE PAZOOKEE, the famous freshly baked-giant-cookie with ice cream... is probably the best hot+cold dessert you can get in San Jose... I personally love the chocolate chip cookie and cookies&cream..This dessert alone gained BJ's an extra star. =] The food is much better than Cheesecake Factory's... their pizzas, pastas, and giant potato is actually GOOD... although this place is very crowded, especially at dinner time, their quality food is worth waiting for.  +affordable, $10~13 dishes average +quality food +clean bathrooms +great service (usually)"
Kristin L.,"San Jose, CA",2,3,1,4.0,2/24/2011,"I usually love the food and service here, but today I wasn't so lucky. I gave them 4 stars because of my past experience and because the food is amazing! I love the Parmesan crusted chicken and the angus pot roast sandwich! So good! And all of their pizzas are amazing! They also have a nice selection of beers! Anyways, I came here for a birthday dinner and of course they add gratuity for large parties so the servers don't really have to work for their tip! If you eat here, don't come in a large party! They're getting paid regardless of the service they give. So annoying! I ordered a sandwich, not attitude. Parking is a b**** too. Even on weekday nights the parking lot is super packed!"
Rich W.,"Aromas, CA",20,88,,3.0,12/8/2011,"Part of a group of 15 for lunch today, so maybe not a totally fair assessment. Having said that, I thought it was perfectly fine. I had their jalapeno burger, which I thought was good, if somewhat overcooked. Menu said it came medium-well unless requested otherwise. I didn't request otherwise, but neither did the waiter ask. I got the regular crispy thin fries with it, but apparently other fry styles were available (seasoned, or wedge-cut). Again, I wasn't asked. OTOH, when you have a group of 15, this is somewhat understandable. When the food came out, three different waitpersons served it, and they had no idea who ordered what, so it was like ""who had the xxxxx?"" repeated multiple times.  All in all, though, a good experience.   BTW, they made us wait about 15 minutes even though we theoretically had a ""reservation"". Yeah, I'll go back  but not in a group."
Ben V.,"San Jose, CA",19,7,,4.0,5/20/2010,"2 words:  TASTER ROUND! You've seen the other reviews, food is fab, fries are phenomenal, pizookie is perfect.  But if you are a beer lover like me... I don't mean a chugging schmuck who just wants a buzz... I mean a student of the brew, then BJ's taster round is a great selection and a great education. Get the full taster round with every regular brew and whichever seasonal brew is on tap.  You won't regret it. Incidentally, if you tackle it all by yourself... you'll find there's more than enough to get you ""happy"" too. Bottom's up!"
Larry C.,"Camino, CA",26,89,35,1.0,3/24/2011,"Slow service. Got my order wrong. Twice! Asked for no feta cheese and a oil and vinegar dressing. Brought back with feta. Strike one. Sent it back. Brought it back with wrong dressing. Strike two. Slow service. Seriously, how long does it take to make a salad? Strike three. The food at BJ's is typical brewpub food, so not worth it if the service is this bad. Won't be coming here again."
