Vicky C.,"San Jose, CA",58,111,62,3.0,3/10/2009,"I like coming here at night with friends for drinks and snacks. One night we ordered, I believe its called the stop light? it comes with three shots red, yellow and green. All I can say is, ew! The red shot was spicy, the yellow was just disgusting, but the green wasn't that bad it tasted like a midori sour. The boys on the other hand ordered heffenweizer with orange juice and they had no complaints. We also ordered dessert, the brownie with ice cream and a pizookie which were also okay, not bad. The brownie could have been softer but its a brownie, I'll eat it.  I came here for lunch the other day for the first time and it wasn't bad either. I ordered myself a mini pizza and shared potato skins with my friend. Pizza was okay, but the potato skins I really liked! They were flavorful not too salty and dipped in ranch,even better. I think next time I'll just order myself some potato skins and skip out on the pizza."
Treena F.,"San Jose, CA",44,116,3,3.0,9/14/2011,I am from Washington and we dont have BJ's up there so I was curious to see what this place was all about. We went here before seeing HP7 pt.2 and the food was good. I like the atmosphere and the big menu. Ill definately come back and see what else is good.
amy c.,"San Jose, CA",53,117,27,4.0,1/22/2009,"BJs is one of the better places to watch a hockey game on big screen - they have so many TVs it's bound to be on one of them.... it's a great place to chill and get together with friends. i usually don't go at ''peak times"" (fri or sat night) so i can't attest to how long the wait is... if you find yourself there and maybe a bit loss, you can't go wrong with these: any of their deep dish pizza CAESAR SALAD PIZOOKIE PARTY PLATTER - so before we start an hour long debate over how 'authentic' their deep dish pizza is here, let's remember that this is a chain restaurant afterall - it's what they do, they 'interpret' the food...  but i think they do a good job at serving a thick crush, deep dish pizza with what appears to be fresh ingredients. their ceasar salad is usually on the money - and i usually don't crave ceasar salads but i do with this one. pizzokie - what is this? this is the best, fresh, piping hot cookie, cooked in a persona-size-pizza-size pan. hot, soft cookie center, crispy cookie edge. served with a few big hunking scoop of vanilla bean ice cream in the center... who knew a cookie can make me this happy? i guess i can be a cheap date afterall.. ------------------------------------------------------------------- so my love affair with the pizzokie has spanned quite a few years already. we had an interesting start. the first two times i had pizzokie, they were on the house. the first time, the waitress forgot to put in our order. the menu tells you that pizzokies are made to order so it takes 10 minutes to bake (you can specify which combination of up to 2 flavors of cookie you wanted). after 15-20 minutes, we asked about our pizzokie, and that's when the waitress realized she hadn't punched in the order. she was cool enough to comp the pizzokie. ---------------------------------- the second time i ordered pizzokie, i was excited because it's sooo good. after a very confusing first mouthful, i chewed slowly, trying to connect all the feelings and tastes and resolve all the differences in my head. i love the sweetness of the chocolate chip cookie dough.. ok. i love the cold and smoothness of the vanilla bean ice cream... ok i love the spicyness and the fennel in group sausage... wait .. what?? NOT OK!!! i mean, i love sausage. just not TOGETHER with cookie AND ice cream.  poking around the pizzokie, i saw other pieces of sausage sticking out of the cookie dough. hm. called the waitress who called the manager over, and we all poked at the pizzokie and concur that indeed, this pizzokie had sausage. yes, they promptly comped my dessert and rushed another order of non-meat pizzokie to my table. it could've been worse if the pizzokie was intended for vegetarians. but apparently the kitchen accidentally reused the sausage scoop to scoop the cookie dough. OOPS. well i wasn't offended. :) makes for great stories, you can't make this up. i want to give this a 3.5 stars. for what it's worth, it's a decent, causal hangout where you can get GOOD BEER and a decent meal while watching hockey on TV, so that bumps this up 0.5 stars. the pizzokie is a must have. i know some guy friends who are reduced to having salads and appertizers so they can save room for the pizzokie. so manly. *wink*"
Mandy A.,"San Francisco, CA",737,320,242,1.0,9/16/2010,"i'm actually a fan of bj's, but usually frequent the cupertino location. every single time i've gone to the oakridge location we get the world's worst terrible service and at least one or two orders completely wrong. to top it all off, one time my friend found a BOLT in her pizza. that's right...a bolt. one that looked like it had fallen off of the golden gate bridge. why i went back after that....is beyond me!"
Andrew V.,"San Jose, CA",72,20,,4.0,1/3/2012,"BIg burgers, good pizza, a bit crowded and long wait lines unless you reserve. Delicious desserts, hot waitresses, great place to be at overall."
Patricia B.,"West Hollywood, CA",263,253,162,5.0,2/22/2009,"To me, BJ's is pretty amazing. I'm a huge fan. Their service is consistent which is a good thing. The wait is always long on the weekends (45 minutes-1hr) and you can only get a reservation if your party is 10 or larger. The food is consistently tasty and delicious though! Also, it is usually fast and the servers are quick.  The prices are decent as well. I believe lunch ranges from $6-15 and dinner probably ranges from $9-20. The most expensive thing is like NY steak or something (which is good). The best thing on the menu would probably have to be the PIZOOKIE!  My favorite would probably be the chocolate chip one! Mmm! Things that I would recommend; Jambalaya, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Pizza (Bj's Works), Broccoli Chicken Pasta, Big Potatoes, Broccoli Cheddar soup (not too cheesy)! All these dishes are SO SO SO tasty and flavorful. AND OF COURSE, I definitely with out a doubt recommend the PIZOOKIE. It's simply amazing. Other things that are pretty good are their sandwiches, burgers, chicken strips, chili cheese fries, and the spinach dip is pretty good as well. The decor and atmosphere of this place is good. They have a lot of TVs which is nice and entertaining. Outdoor seating is OKAY..I personally don't like it because when it's windy outside you can definitely feel the breeze when seating out there even though there are heaters."
Patty N.,"San Jose, CA",160,117,10,4.0,5/14/2009,"PIZOOKIE! 3 stars for that alone.  My friends surprised me with a birthday dinner for my 21st here. The wait was about 2-3 hours long on a Saturday night! No reservations on saturdays so beware!  The food is much better than other American chain restaurants. The bar is a great place to sit and watch whatever game is on that night. The service is great (although everyone appears much more friendlier when you're intoxicated).  BJ's all the way! Live, Laugh, and Lunch Patty."
Laura B.,"Santa Clara, CA",145,114,2,1.0,9/16/2008,"Absolutely the worst place ever.  My coworkers insist on this place for lunch constantly and I just don't get it.  The same crap happens every time.  Today we went for lunch again.... It took 10 minutes for someone to even come to the host area so we could put our name in. When we got a seat, I ordered a diet coke, I got a regular coke. Most of my coworkers didn't get their drink order right. 35 minutes later, some of our food came.  The food server was a different person than our waitress and she was incredibly rude.  She asked in a loud, rude manner what each of us had ordered when their was some confusion over whose dish was whose. I ordered the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich with toasted bread (instead of grilled).  I got the ""lunch special"" which was half a sandwich and a salad.  And the bread came extra grilled and greasy.   Several of my coworkers had mix ups with their orders as well.   The manager brought the bill and pointed out that she had removed two entrees from it for our inconvenience.  Except that the waitress had added two extra entrees to begin with so we ended up paying full price. I wish I could say this was a unique experience, but it's what I've come to expect from BJ's."
G. F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",7,84,795,4.0,10/7/2011,"I've been to BJ's lots of times but I went the other day because my brother had never been. Our party of 4 were seated quickly, which is always nice, even though it was during their lunch rush. Drinks arrived soon and the ordering process went smoothly. I tried the Jambalaya which was good, wasn't ecstatic about the rice pilaf but wasn't disappointed about the dish as a whole. The pulled pork sandwich that was ordered was tasty with the meat nice and tender. Also tried the open-faced pot roast sandwich which was different and interesting. Everyone enjoyed their dishes and the service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and personable. Thanks Jason! We had a good time as I've had here before."
William S.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,1,1.0,4/21/2012,Horrible service did not get what ordered and then. Mgt says we ordered wrongthen he says take it or leave it wow no more bj staying with cheese cake factory
Joy V.,"Bay Area, CA",27,75,12,4.0,7/25/2009,"1 word: Pizookie. If you are into dessert at all, you must try this.            As far as my overall review I am giving 4 stars. The only reason not to give it 5 is because of the forever long wait due to being so busy.           Service has always been good, there is something for everyone. Having vegetarian friends, meat lovers, dieters, etc. as friends this is a great choice to satisfy each appetite. Plus in the immortal words of Homer Simpson ""mmmm beer"". Lots of choices and a full bar for those wanting a little something different. Give it a try, you'll enjoy."
Kim T. N.,"San Jose, CA",19,175,2,5.0,9/18/2009,"I love BJ's!!! The environment and food are both so good! There are times where you have to wait forever for a table! Even though it doesn't seem like there are a lot of people. But there are times where the wait is about 10-15 minutes.  Normally I usually go here for skinny fries and a pizookie. Clogged arteries, high cholesterol, etc etc right? LOL. I think that is the best combination ever. When I actually eat ""real"" food, it is pretty good. The portions are HUGE. It really does fill you up. At the end, you need that pizookie. I refuse to leave BJ's without one. One bad thing, you feel like a tub of lard leaving. But it doesn't hurt to have a fat day once in a while. :)"
Chelsea M.,"San Jose, CA",16,69,1,1.0,11/14/2010,"Worst. Service. Ever.  - I know this is a very busy location, so I already lowered my expectations, but they still take the cake for the worst service.  We called ahead to get on the list and were told an hour wait. Got there, and managed to sit at the bar at a table - we should have stayed at the bar since we actually got service.  We get seated after an hour and a half waiting. Then we waited 20 minutes for a sign of a human in the area. No Water, no cocktails, no nothing. Not even a wink in our direction - and that goes for the whole area we were seated in - not just us. You could hear crickets in the area. Hubby got up and went to the host table and asked for someone to serve us. They were apologetic, but again - another 5 min waiting. Since we had a waitress, we ordered drinks and food at the same time. Good thing we did because we didn't see the waitress again for another 20 min for her check-in 'how's your food'.  Once we got our food, another waiter brought us our food and left.... we were without utensils - nice. Hubby went to the server station to ask for utensils and HE came back with them - not a waiter/waitress/etc.  The same pattern continued until we asked for our bill. We did get a random dude in khakis and a blue shirt come and 'apologize' really half -a$$ed about the service. That would have been good about an hour plus ago, plus he didn't identify himself as anyone of related to the restaurant (was he a manager? a random dude that tries to act important?).  I had friends warn me about this place, but I'd been to other BJs and not had a problem. Apparently this is the anomaly to the chain.  I have no plans to ever go back."
Sarah W.,"Holly Springs, NC",21,25,,5.0,9/15/2009,"Great beer, great appetizers, great pizza (not even close to the Chicago style they claim, but good nevertheless), decent service. My hubby and I usually grab a bite at BJ's before taking in a movie. We usually do this on Friday or Saturday evenings, which tend to be busy but we manage to be seated within 15 minutes. They have a book for a menu, so we have reason to come back and try something different each time. We are usually tempted by several appetizers, namely the Santa Fe spring rolls, spinach and artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders. We have also ordered their pizza and it was delicious. But for those looking to experience Chicago-style pizza (which is their claim) won't get an authentic experience at BJ's. We have had real Chicago style pizza in Chicago (a la Lou Malnotti's), so you can't fool us. The sauce is supposed to go on top of everything!! Oh the beer brewed there is delicious as well. I have had their hefeweizen and a slightly darker brew--I think they call it Nutty Brewnette--and both were excellent. Rivaling Gordon Biersch for sure! We will definitely return!"
Zeba E.,"San Jose, CA",159,161,32,1.0,11/6/2010,We went with a large group and the service was very poor. I ordered a pineapple orange drink and our server brings the drinks and doesn't even bother to tell me that they are out of pineapple and assumes I would be ok with just oj. Then I asked if he could mix some sprite instead and he said he would bring me two separate glasses one with sprite and one empty w ice so that I can mix it myself at the table and make a huge mess. I had a total of three glasses in front of me. That's not my job! He also forgot to bring out the sauce I asked for and had to remind him again. Anyways I had higher expectations for the amount of money we spent.
Jackie D.,"Fremont, CA",131,298,1,2.0,11/1/2008,"I've been a fan of BJ's brewery, but my experience this past time has gotten me to write a not-so-fan-like review. Don't get me wrong, their food is pretty good - I think they are the best when it comes to deep dish pizza and their signature pizookies. However, this particular location doesn't have great service. Our waiter (reciting his speech like he just learned it) came to our table, took our beer order and then disappeared. Thankfully he came back with drinks. When it came time for the food, the pizza I was sharing with my two friends came piping hot, but we waited 10-15 minutes before the waiter came by to give us our plates. He looked kinda annoyed everytime we would ask him for something.  I hope this location improves their service - its a busy location and the food is pretty good. Bad service keeps good foodies like me away."
Stephen D.,"Las Vegas, NV",5,66,,3.0,11/29/2011,I really like the fish and chips I ordered. Crispy on the outside and big meaty fish inside. I don't go to BJs alot but this one of the restaurants I like.
Anna G.,"San Jose, CA",64,119,31,3.0,6/16/2009,"Somehow, I always end up here with a bunch of friends. I love their burgers but everything else is alright.  Their happy hour sucks because its only about $1 off of cocktails and maybe $2 off beers.  It's a fun place to watch the game. although you should come early to grab a table.  Wait here is usually 45 minutes long.   The pizookie is always good though!!  I'll probably end up eating here again."
Sara H.,"San Jose, CA",13,52,12,2.0,1/29/2009,I was so disappointed with this visit to BJ's. I've been there several times in the past and never had anything to complain about. Kyle and I went last night (Wednesday) around 6pm ish. The restaurant was full enough that we had about a 10 minute wait for a table. When we got seated our server was there quickly and took our beer order. When she came back we ordered the appetizer and was assured even though they were busy the food usually comes quickly. The  beer was good and reasonably priced. $4.75 for a pint.  We were sitting enjoying our beer when next thing we knew our entree's were there. What happened to the appetizer?? We asked our server and she said she would go check on it. By the time she got back we were halfway thru our dinner. I was disappointed when the final check came and they didn't offer a discount or take the appetizer off our bill even though it was so late.  The entree's were just ok. I had the BJ's cheeseburger and that suited me fine. Didn't realize it came with thousand island so watch out if you don't like it. Kyle ordered the chicken pasta and was not happy with it. It was dry and flavorless and the chicken was overdone. The server said she would've taken it back to put more sauce on had we mentioned it to her.  Overall it was a so-so experience. I've had better meals there in the past. Not sure if I can convince Kyle to give it another try. We wont be going back anytime soon.
Teresa N.,"San Jose, CA",161,274,126,3.0,3/6/2009,"I think BJs is a good place to go to for a casual lunch or dinner with friends, but there isn't anything really special about the food here (except for the pizookie!), or maybe it's just cos I can't drink yet, cos I see many people order the beer sampler when dining here. I usually like Bjs at the other locations I've been to, but I felt like the service here is a bit sub-par compared to the other ones I've been to. Some co-workers and I went here for a birthday dinner, and we were seated on time according to the reservation, so I was really happy about that. After we were seated and our orders were placed (we were seated outside with that patio thing around us), we were just talking and what not, and the waitress servicing the table behind us spoke very loudly about how she dated this guy 6 years ago who broke up with her cos of world of warcraft. HAHAHA. ok, not only was this unneccessary, but it was also very awkward. Our table was just kinda like O__O wtf? hella weird. good thing her shift was over or something cos we didnt see her for the rest of the night. When we finished up dinner and got the check... our waitress took FOREVER to come get it again. Our table was like helloo... uhh dont you want your money? We even had to tell the other waitress to go get OUR waitress to pick up her check. So... for ok food, and good beer (i woudlnt know), I guess BJs is good. You might wanna try out the other locations though... unless you want to meet the waitress who got dumped over WoW... I stil think she's kinda upset about it."
