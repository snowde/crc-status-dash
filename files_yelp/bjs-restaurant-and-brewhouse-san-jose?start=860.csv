Huy V.,"San Jose, CA",386,45,1,4.0,9/14/2011,Beer Heavan and the customer was awesome because last time they ran out table for the bar side at Happy Hour and we were offered the same deal on the diner side.
Jackee K.,"San Jose, CA",165,383,3,3.0,3/15/2009,"Much better parking situation than the one in Cupertino.  Decent sized bar area, and pretty good service.  The beers are good, but the food isn't too spectacular.  Their blue cheese dressing is pretty disgusting, and was even described by one of the waiters as being ""different.""    P.S. Who puts feta cheese in a Cobb Salad?  I mean, come on!"
Angel S.,"San Jose, CA",34,116,,3.0,1/11/2011,"Came here with some friends and family for dinner. I ordered the fish and chips and strawberry lemonade. Fish and chips were okay but strawberry lemonade was good. Not as sweet as the other strawberry lemonades I had in other restaurants. Of course, we ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut w/ vanilla ice cream pizzookie but it was too sweet. However, it was served warm and the ice cream melted like crazy so eat this delectable desert ASAP. Servers were attentive and helpful."
Bayrex R.,"San Jose, CA",71,7,2,3.0,10/24/2009,Had a great lunch with some friends. The beer I tried was excellent. Friend said it taste like dark chocolate... and initially it didn't but after a while... definitely. Happy hour's are definite.  Overall a great place to hang with family and friends.
caneisha h.,"San Jose, CA",63,114,24,2.0,8/2/2011,"Pizookie, nuff said.Oreo is probably the best. I like the chips and salsa with a preference for the red chips only. But every other time we go here the chips are stale. Pizza is good we usually get a mini during happy hour. Other favs are the broccoli cheese soup which my honey likes but Im totally over it. The tomato soup is good not the best but good. Try it with the bread bowl which is ah-mazing. Stick to BJs during happy hour save yourself the $."
ben n.,"Pittsburgh, PA",131,13,,4.0,10/20/2011,"Super friendly service from our cute waitress Kimber, everything was right with our orders, food was well made, very attentive staff! Great onsite beer selection and samplers available. We would recommend this place if you're in the area. It can be a little bit noisy inside as it is a large place and somewhat of a sports bar setup with big TVs but we didn't have any problem talking."
Zaydian A.,"San Jose, CA",196,79,,4.0,6/26/2011,"Came here yesterday for a birthday, party of about 30 people. We had one main server, who was really nice, and a few other people that came and brought food & drinks out for us. The service was pretty good for such a big party, and the food didn't take that long either. Everybody knows the food here is above average, but I will continue to go here because of the service & desserts. Red Velvet Pizookie is the business."
Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420,3.0,3/1/2011,"I am not really a big fan of big chain restaurants. There is nothing really special about them and they tend to lose the personalization that you get with family/privately owned restaurants. They are a big corporation and they are totally cool with serving crappy to mediocre food at really inflated prices. I really do prefer smaller restaurants but we ended up eating here tonight with some friends. I have been to BJ's in various locations in the past and it has not been that spectacular. I also feel like with these chain restaurants service varies by location and it is hit or miss. It is really hard to get any consistency whatsoever. I could come here tomorrow and get a 5 star experience or I could visit another location and get a one star experience. You just never know. However, since I have discovered yelp I feel like it is my duty to report my experiences at all of the places I visit. So here it goes.  This visit is very much like the rest average at best. Our friends were running a little late so my husband and I ordered some drinks and chips and salsa as an appetizer. These arrived in a timely fashion. The chips and salsa was not that great. It was really bland and blah so I really didn't eat that much of it. About 20 minutes pass and our friends finally make it. They order their drinks and ask for some time to look over the menu. After that our waitress seemed to disappear. About 25 minutes passed before she surfaced again and we were all long ready to order by then. For that 25 minute period I was stuck with an empty glass and nasty chips and salsa. She took our orders and brought out refills. She would stop by sporadically to refill our drinks but our food took forever. Another 30 minutes passed before we received our food which was very annoying and resulted in another 30 minutes of me being stuck with a growling stomach and nasty chips and salsa, at least I had a full glass. I got the grilled shrimp tacos and they were mediocre at best. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich and he seemed to enjoy it. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and I can surely appreciate that with customer service the way it is today. Like I said before nothing really spectacular or memorable.  Overall, I would rate the experience average. Our waitress stayed on top of our refills with the exception of her 25 minute disappearance and the food was ok at least. (Except the chips and salsa.) Not my favorite place to go but a great place to go with friends. With groups chain restaurants seem to be the better choice most of the time. Diverse menu and familiar location puts everyone at ease. There is something for everyone."
Michelle P.,"San Jose, CA",2,3,2,1.0,1/21/2013,I usually have no problems with this bj but for some reason today the service was ridiculous. We ordered 2 chicken parm and one spaghetti dish and wasn't told till 20 minutes later that their was no more chicken breast. Like im pretty sure you ran out way before so you couldve saved us the time and told us when we ordered. 30 minutes passes and we finally get our food. What really ticked me off more was that the spaghetti dish was just warm and not steaming hot like the others. It's obvious they let that dish sit there for 20 minutes while making the last two orders. You'd think theyd put our orders in the front to make first since one pasta dish was already done but guess not. On top of that one of the plates was missing garlic bread like how can you not notice there's no bread on a plate when there's two plates that have it?!!!? And to top it off the garlic bread was hard! Could've knocked someone's head off! we literally waited longer than we ate! Worst experience ever!
Theresa E.,"Los Gatos, CA",11,19,,5.0,2/18/2012,"Awesome lunch with great atmosphere, and amazing dessert (pazookie) great rimes at BJ's  with the hubby :o)"
Joy L.,"San Jose, CA",22,47,8,5.0,9/1/2008,"5 stars simply for the beer. They've got a good selection. Also, nachos kick some ass as well. Good place for appetizers and beer. I don't know about their main entrees, never had. Update 10/02/08: I went back to Bj's, I wasn't feeling well this particular day, so I just got clam chowder soup, it's one of the best I've tasted. Great Consistency, more than enough of chunks of clams, which is always a plus because most clam chowders lack CLAMS. hah."
Judy K.,"San Jose, CA",289,65,14,3.0,6/20/2009,"I love the decoration of the place, big screen t.v.s everywhere, and its always lively and packed. The wait is usually 15-20 minutes during dinner time. The waiters and waitresses are usually pretty cool. No one outstanding, but not bad at all. Last night I ordered the texas chicken fried steak. Mmm, my lil tummy could only finish half of the dish and I took the rest home. SOOO GOOD. Sides were mash potatoes and steamed veggies. I tried their ribs, and pizzas here before too. Pretty good stuff =) There's nothing to really rave about though. It's good, but not great... I like the fact that they stay open until 1 am on fridays and saturdays =) Cause I love to eat out late. keke"
Nicole G.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,6,2.0,2/9/2012,"Used to love this place but it seems they care more about gettin their customers in and out than providing good service. Lately everytime I have ordered to go I have to sit on hold for at least 5 minutes or call and hang up to get to speak to someone. Last time I repeated my order 3 times, had her repeat it back to me, tipped well since I understand they try, and then go home to see my order is messed up. Again. Issues like this need to be taken care of or this business is going to keep going down the hole. I will give it more chance and update."
Iggy Evee H.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,2,4.0,2/2/2012,"Iggy:Well the wait was short the parking sucked took along time to park the ordering was good pasta tuscana, buffalo wings, chicken sliders, and one kid corn dogs and one kids pizza all was good. the waiter used brain memory but fell short on the drinks. They have tv's all  over this place lighting was average. Its worthy of a try."
Jacqui W.,"Kent, WA",28,35,,2.0,1/2/2009,"Ever since my friends introduced me to BJ's I've became a big fan, but the past experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I love their deep dish pizzas beer and ooolala Poozokie. I have to agree with the other Jackie on this location service, lousy. I came the other day to escape the wacky Bay Area weather. Our waitress took our orders and literally disappeared, we didn't see her until we got our check.  I really hope this location really improves their service, because my first experience here was a lot better than the one that I recently got. I'm sticking with the Newark one."
Jenni E.,"San Jose, CA",104,58,7,3.0,11/11/2011,"Stopped in today for a quick lunch with my parents after a couple hours of shopping.  We were seated quickly, which was a nice change.  Usually, BJ's is jam-packed and it's slow getting a table.  But for once, the restaurant was not completely full. All three of us ordered the soup/salad lunch.  Service was slow, and it took about 10 minutes just to get our salads.  Then, about 5 minutes later, our waiter brought 2 bowls of soup (it was the tortilla soup...yum!).  We kept waiting for the third bowl to show up...and wondered where our spoons were.  Another 5+ minutes went by and I saw our server race by, so got his attention.  He looked dumbfounded that we were missing a soup and had no spoons.  He quickly went to get our soup, but brought back the wrong kind.  But at least we did get our spoons, however by now the first two soups were no longer very hot.  I will say that both of the soups were fabulous. My salad was just the house salad.  Not all that impressive as it was mostly clumps of iceberg lettuce, a couple small tomato slices and weak tasting dressing.  My parents both got the Cesar salad, which they said was really good. I'm not sure what went wrong here.  Maybe the kitchen was giving our server the wrong food.  But I think he should have caught the mistakes before they got to our table.  And simple things like spoons for soup...should not have had to ask. We go to BJ's every couple of months, and this particular visit was the worst.  But I will go back, assuming this is just a one time bad visit. I will make it a point to update this review after I eat there again."
Hilari T.,"San Jose, CA",1,68,,2.0,10/7/2008,"The only reason they get 2 stars is because the food is actually alright.  What sucks is the service!!!  OK so this place is ALWAYS packed.....I have NOOOOO idea why either.  We went in with a party of 6 (3 couples)  after 40 minutes or so of waiting we got seated.  The waiter seemed like he was on the ball...WRONG! So prior to ordering we asked that each couple have there own check....He says ok no problem and we even pointed out to him who was with who.  We ordered,  the food was good. The waiter did a decent job and then we asked for the bills..........HAHAHAHAHAHA 15 minutes later he comes with 3 bills and NONE of them were right.  We pointed out what was wrong and he said he would fix it....opppsss I have to go on break so this waitress will fix it WTF!!!!!!!!!! The girl tried but we had enough of the run around and 35 minutes of waiting so we asked to speak to the manager.  He was nice enough and actually comped are entire dinner.  Thats bad when you lose over $125 because your staff is useless as tits on a turd!! We will never ever ever ever go back.......EVER"
Shaheen A.,"San Jose, CA",459,52,1,4.0,10/29/2011,"BJ's is a fun place to eat at. It was the first place that I tried Apricot Ale and I look forward to trying more brews from them. Decent pricing for an array of burgers, pastas, etc. Service was good."
Eric N.,"Milpitas, CA",5,1,,1.0,8/12/2010,It was ok at first until the two female servers left cuz they don't know wtf they're doing and  they come back with mix orders and came out with half ordered drinks and most ppl didnt get their drinks. Waited at least two hours to get the food ordered. This is the last time I'm going here to eat.
Cindy D.,"San Jose, CA",109,84,2,4.0,6/3/2009,"I mostly like this place b/c it's a good place to chill.  My friends and I come here or to the other (Deanza Blvd?) one every once in a while.  Beer, chicken and pizza are good.  There's also this one bbq salad that's bombb..I forget what it's called but it's a must.  It's pretty big also so you should sharee=)  I hated this place once b/c of a bad experience.  My group of friends were seated in a corner booth one slow afternoon and were ignored for the longest time.  Then a server proceeded to not service us, but to move us to another table b/c this booth was reserved. Wtf, seriously? I think we just decided to leavee.  But yeah, my experiences after were good/decent enough to change my mind."
