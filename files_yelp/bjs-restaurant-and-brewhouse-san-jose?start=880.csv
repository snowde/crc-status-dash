Ming S.,"San Francisco, CA",146,132,390,4.0,8/17/2008,"Fun atmosphere for late night dinning. One of the first things you'll notice about BJ's is their choice of decor - which is favored by the younger individuals as oppose to the old. Definitely a great place to grab a bit, but would question the place for family occasions.  One of my favorites from BJ's is their salad and soup special - simple, yet full of taste. I strongly recommend BJ's if you are looking for a fun place to hang out with friends."
Maddie O.,"San Jose, CA",53,72,32,5.0,6/17/2011,". I love their burgers! its nice how its a sandwich and all.I had the club sandwich 2nd time , and it was Oh so delicious! But i did have better club sandwiches somewhere else. Good chicken wings and pizza too! Their pizookie's are the bomb, you gotta always make room for the dessert, cause youll miss out on that."
Manish P.,"San Jose, CA",115,239,23,4.0,8/8/2008,"Their beer is really good. Service just about OK.  We tried their spicy pasta sauce, and it was really good. Their salad is quite delicious too.  Try to go when there's not much crowd, to get great service and food."
Anna N.,"Redwood City, CA",3,102,26,3.0,3/29/2011,"Shrimp Jambalaya was just okay. I loved the idea of the small bites menu. I had Mac n Cheese which was a disgrace to Mac n Cheese lovers worldwide. I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good. For dessert, the Pizookie. Couldn't they have come up with a better name than pisscookie?! Anywho, the wait staff was great. Although 45 minute wait on a Saturday night was a not nearly worth it for the so-so food."
Kyle Y.,"San Jose, CA",81,203,296,4.0,3/3/2011,Offers a great selections of beers and food. I recommend the pizza here. Its a deep dish form and is very good for a chain restaurant. Also do enjoy the root beer here as it is top-notch. I always enjoy eating here if I'm in the area. Side salads here are the kind that comes out of the bag. Not very good.
Cindy O.,"San Jose, CA",61,24,,3.0,9/15/2011,Decent happy hour. Poke app was fresh and the beer is good. I'd go back.
Laurie H.,"San Jose, CA",72,156,293,4.0,7/12/2008,"Land of the Large Salads, and Good Happy Hour Specials I love BJ's for a few reasons, just come off hours or be prepared to WAIT. Brewhouse Blonde Beer (which is a Kolsh) a refreshing pale wheat beer, goes great with a salad or a thin crust appetizer pizza.  Speaking of salads they are so gianormous you really could share with someone, however I have to say I can eat the entire thing when hungry.  The Field of Greens (no onions, no peppers, add grilled chicken) is my #1 choice for a sweet, nutty fresh salad.  The happy hour specials you can only get when you sit in the bar section are a good chance to try a few different apps for half off regular price."
Jen W.,"Hollister, CA",44,35,7,4.0,9/10/2011,"Great food, great atmosphere.  Superior customer service."
Adam C.,"San Jose, CA",207,70,21,1.0,3/31/2010,"I am writing because of an extremely disappointing experience at BJ's in San Jose, CA.  I arrived to the restaurant at 9:10 p.m. on a Tuesday, and was told that the wait time for a party of 8 was 30 minutes.  After 50 minutes of waiting and having not heard from the hostess (young brunette with hair tied back in a ponytail), we checked in with her and she basically told us that we would not be seated for a very long time.  She even recommended that we go elsewhere since they only had 4 servers working.  My initial thought was, ""Are you serious, you're telling us to leave?"" and my second thought was ""We just completely wasted our time here.""  I told her that if there was a change in the amount of wait time, it was common courtesy to let us know or even offer to break our group up into smaller groups.  She again mentioned that there were only 4 servers, but as we were waiting, we saw 3 servers saying bye to the hostess and leaving (2 males and 1 female).  This shows us that there was a lack of planning/scheduling and no work ethic (we saw a lot of workers just standing around behind the host check-in area doing absolutely nothing).  The most extremely disappointing and frustrating moment of the night was when we witnessed a server seating his friends before us, not having to wait at all, when they obviously came in a long time after us.  The restaurant needs to treat all customers fairly, whether we are friends of the servers or not. I have been to BJ's numerous times before because of the good food, but after this experience, will not likely ever go back."
Amy T.,"Dublin, CA",292,395,153,4.0,7/8/2008,"Can you say PIZOOKIE? OH MY LORD.  My friend raved about this pizookie and I had no idea what was in store for me when we ordered it.  It sounds so basic and ho hum, but it is INCREDIBLE.  We were like cookie monsters devouring this thing (there were no words spoken while eating this thing).  Freshly baked cookie (about 8 inches in diameter) still hot in a baking tin topped with vanilla ice cream.   The restaurant itself is a decent size with a huge bar area great for big groups looking for a place to wind down (or up) after work.  They have outdoor seating as well.   The food was quite good as well.  I had a meatball sandwich with deeelicious shoestring potato fries (you can choose shoestring or the big wedge kind).   They have a wide variety on their menu from thin crust pizza, deep dish pizzas, salads, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  There's something for everyone. But it's all about the Pizookie. And a portion of the pizookie goes to charity!!  What better excuse to eat dessert? pizoooooookie...... pizooooooookie.........pizooooookie......."
Denise P.,"San Jose, CA",253,311,78,2.0,8/25/2008,"I've only been to this BJ's once, and I haven't gone to another because of the negative experience I had here. Here is where I had the worst dining experience ever in my life. Went here for dinner.  We ordered, and everything was going great. Before we got our food, our server said she had to go to break, and that another server was supposed to help us. She was going to introduce us to him, but he was doing something, so she said that he'd be in to check up on us. This guy never came. We received our orders from a bus boy. And that was it. We didn't get service for about 30 minutes. No drink refills. No questions of whether or not we needed anything. Nothing. Luckily we knew the hostess. She ended up serving us. She refilled our drinks, and even took our dessert order. The manager finally came and apologized to us. He offered us a $25 gift certificate to the restaurant. We took it and just used it to pay for our dinner that night. It ended up that the server guy just never came. He was waiting on all the other tables around us, but for some reason just didn't wait on us. I still haven't gone back.  I know that this place is probably really great. Especially since their prices are okay, and the reviews from others say that it's a great place. I just haven't been able to go back. I'll re-review this place when I do, but for now.... ehh not so much a place where I'd like to go."
Rick L.,"North Valley, San Jose, CA",1,4,2,3.0,1/6/2014,Great food and one of the best beers I have every had on tap was here. There customer service was good manger comes up to check how the food is once it comes out. Overall I like the feel of the environment as well as all the TVs for sport games.
J R.,"San Diego, CA",6,66,6,4.0,8/16/2011,This place has excellent food and good service. My only complaint is that it's busy all the time. I guess that's what happens when the food is good. Try the ahi tuna salad and the wings. I love them both. The pizza is always excellent too.
Miss Mary P.,"Aptos, CA",84,49,5,3.0,5/3/2011,It was okay. Just went for lunch and had the chicken tenders & fries. Nothing special.
Michelle E.,"Pearl City, HI",107,66,,5.0,8/11/2011,"My boyfriend and I decided to try BJ's out because we had never eaten here before. We went around 5:00pm, so it wasn't busy at all and we were able to get a table immediately.  Our server was one of the best servers we have ever had anywhere!  She took our drink and food orders right away, and told us that if we didn't like anything we could always get something else.  We both got chicken dishes, which were both absolutely delicious, and we then got a strawberry dessert which was delicious as well!  By the time we left the restaurant it was around 6:30/7:00, and there were tons of people waiting.  I would definitely recommend getting to the restaurant around 5:00 or so if you don't want to have to wait.  The food was wonderful, the service was one of the best, and the prices were decent.  We would definitely go back here again!"
Liz L.,"New York, NY",272,164,2,3.0,2/13/2009,"I would give this place 4 stars.. but I have to take away 1 for the parking here.. which really sucks because it is at Oakridge Mall ... and also because of the service we got here last night.. There were many parties there.. so I could understand the lack of quality service.. but they weren't doing too well on taking our orders promptly and refilling our waters..  I've been to a couple of BJ's before.. so I already know what to expect when I come here... the beer is great.. but if you haven't tried it already.. get the Raspberry Framboise... its SOOO GOOD.. its kind of like a raspberry flavored beer.. and its on tap! I haven't found another bar/restaurant that actually served it around here..  As for the food... I think all of the food is pretty good here... I've had the jambalaya, balsamic glazed chicken, pizza, derek's meatloaf, pasta... can't go wrong w/ any of those..  Their happy hour on weekdays I believe is from 9-close? And you can get mini pizzas for only $5 and $1 off draft beers.."
Kim D.,"San Jose, CA",489,603,6,3.0,3/20/2008,"Um... This place isn't bad for what it is (you'll find me saying that a lot). Me and my friend Joe or more so I needed something to nosh on after class, so we went here. The food was standard, I found myself dumping a lot of salt on this pasta with cream sauce that I had. I held back from a Pazookie which was sad, but I was dumping a lot of salt made me bloated. But the food was decent and is good a late night standard. The only quip was I had a good 10 minutes before someone even noticed I was sitting at my table. And that's even to the point where I wondered if I was going to get any service. But our waitress Nadia, was more than nice to make up for it."
Danielle N.,"Hollywood, FL",133,63,12,4.0,2/7/2011,Every time I come here the service is great. I really enjoy the food and they have a great selection of beer. The wait is awful and I'm not sure if it's worth it. I recommend going during a time when it's not so busy.
John P.,"San Jose, CA",2,4,,1.0,9/15/2010,"My girlfriend had probably one of the worst dining experiences of all time! Our server did NOT want to be there. It was written all over his face. When he took our drink order, I ordered an iced tea and a water, my girlfriend ordered a water. When he came out with the drinks, he handed me the water and gave her the tea. He started to walk away, then stopped and came back to ask her if she wanted sweetner. I said ""yes, I'd like some for my tea"". It took him 10 minutes to bring it to the table! Each time we asked him for something (a total of 3), he would roll his eyes as he walked away. At least wait until you're in the kitchen where no customers can see you! Ranting on about the server...he constantly wiped or touched his nose. It looked like he had snorted an 8-ball of coke in the bathroom before his shift started! The more he touched his nose, the more I didn't want to eat my food. It was a Tuesday night, so the place wasn't crowded...but there were groups of servers just standing around, talking, laughing....blocking walkways...you know, nothing too terrible. The person working the curbside pick-up spent 10 minutes texting someone without looking up from his phone. Too bad he didn't see the people trying to get his attention so they could get their food and get the hell out of there. OMG it must have been such a GR8 txt convo LOL. I would have liked to tell a manager about my unfavorable experience, but there weren't any to be found. They were probably doing lines of coke in the bathroom with our server! Yes, I'm ranting, maybe a little too much. But would I go back to this place, definitely not!"
Roger C.,"San Jose, CA",251,243,137,4.0,1/29/2009,"I came here not so long ago to celebrate yet another birthday party. IS it me or is this the place of choice for birthday parties? Well, its a bit ways from me since I live near SJSU and I must drive down 87 to get to Oakridge just to have BJ's. But let me see, what to say about BJ: Food is decent and affordable. The few times that I have come here I have tried the G)-MORMOUS baked potatoes. I swear I have never seen such a large baked potato at a reasonable price. I kid you not, they are not the standard tiny ones you see at Wendy's. Its like a size of a Mans shoe, like maybe size 8-10....massive if you ask me. Yes, I really recommend the Grilled Chicken baked Potato if you decide to try it. DELICIOUS! I have also tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta and that too is served in a generous portion for a decent price. To end on a good note, my friends and I shared two types of Pizookies that they offered and I hear they are famous for making them. It was good but I don't know if its THAT amazing.  Overall, I give them a 3.5 to four stars. They are decently priced with pretty good portion sizing. Um, dessert felt fattening, and service was great too. I think you should come check this place out. Great for parties and//or to chill with your friends and have a nice dinner with :)"
