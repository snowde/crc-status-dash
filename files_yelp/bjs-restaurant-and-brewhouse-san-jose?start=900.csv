Erica S.,"San Jose, CA",2,12,,5.0,11/26/2011,"Went here tonight with my family and my parents who are here visiting.  The food was delicious, quickly prepared and our server was awesome.  My daughter almost spilled her drink, which caused my husband to knock over his own beer.  Our waitress came to the rescue and brought back a beer ""on the house"" to my husband, as well as many additional cloth napkins.  Great for kiddos too because it's pretty loud.  Order the PIZOOKIE!  All I can say is, ""oh, mama!""  Will be going here again!"
Dustin W.,"San Jose, CA",4,50,,4.0,8/2/2008,"This review is just for their happy hour, which was already one of the best deals in town and recently had some changes. Here's the discounts: $2 off appetizers. This hasn't changed, but rules for some items like the wedge-cut fries. A huge pile of them ends up being $1.95. $1 off all draft beers. This used to be only for BJ's brews but now applies to all drafts. Cool if you wanna get something like Guiness but I always get their beer when I'm here so doesn't really affect me. $1 off all cocktails. This used to be only for well drinks, so its much cooler for me now when I feel like a Sapphire and tonic. 1/2 off all mini pizzas. This is the same as it used to be, but they recently raised the prices of the pizza so it's not quite as good as it used to be. But the pizzas are still pretty good so its alright. Also, happy hour starts an hour earlier at 3pm. I probably wouldn't ever come here outside of happy hour. The food other than the pizzas and the fries is just okay. But the happy hour is fun and relatively cheap so it keeps me coming back."
Haily W.,"Beaverton, OR",79,308,45,4.0,12/25/2008,"**Update 12/26/08** Went last night with some friends for a druken festivus the night after xmas. The wait at 7 was an hour fifeteen so we grabbed a buzzer and walked around for awhile. We were seated outside but it's ok since they had the heaters. Our server was an older lady who was so funny!!! After she carded us we all got our drink on and she even brought a taster of one of the beers for my friend to try. We got the app platter to share. The Santa Fe chicken rolls were REALLY good, but I did not like the avacodo spring rolls. To much avacodo made it very had to eat as all you have is this big mouth full of warm mush. Service was a little slow, but the place was packed so it was understandble. We still had a great time, and she laughed at us as everyone was getting crazy and drunk and taking wild pictures. Good times =D Deep dish BBQ chicken pizza. *drools* Best thing on the menu. Everything else is decent. It's almost always super crowded but better then the Cheesecake Factory! Service is usually friendly and attentive as well."
Rick S.,"San Jose, CA",371,74,224,3.0,5/22/2008,"Slightly above average. That's about right. The operative word being ""slightly."" Hey, it's a California idea of what a Chicago eatery would be like. And that in itself is what makes it a little identity-confused. The 1st BJ's was BJ's Chicago Pizzeria in SANTA ANA, CA. Dig?? So yes, it's the beer, the beef dips, the pizza, the burgers... but a taste of Chicago? Nahhhh. Portillo's PLEASE come to San Jose!!!!!! I still regularly eat the casual meal or get-together at BJ's though. I like the wedge salad, I like the sliders (mmmm) and the Beef Dip sandwich with horseradish sauce is palatable too. The proprietary Blonde beer is good. And for a kick now and then, so is their beer sampler. The wall of big-screens, as well as the scattered sets around the joint are great for sports nights... always there's always a good crowd on hand for football, baseball and regional heroes like the Sharks. The service is generally friendly and attentive too. Really. The usual long wait there for a table, is more a testament to the sad state of good, casual restaurants in the area. But the menu is OK, the food is prepared as good as you'd like your average hamburger/ribs/pizza/chicken breast/salad - type restaurant to be... and the meals are priced at a pretty fair value. It's all pretty much what you'd expect at first glance upon walking in the door. Hey, it's noisy, talkative, fun, casual... go have a beer and burger with your buds now!"
Sim U.,"San Jose, CA",1,27,,4.0,7/7/2013,Love almost all the dishes over there..my husband loves bear...we go atleast once in a week
YumCha L.,"San Jose, CA",6,48,,4.0,1/15/2009,"Grant it that BJ's isn't gourmet food, nor is it even amazing food.  But you have to critique it for what it is and what they are.  They are a sport's bar that is going to serve bar type food.  HD TVs are plentiful at the bar and prices are right, especially during happy hour.  $1 off beer and well drinks, $2 off all appetizers, and half off on mini pizzas.  Hours are usually from 3-7 pm and then goes on again from about 10pm to close.   Notable items on the menu: *Chicken Wings (crispy on the outside and hot in the inside)  You can even request all wing or all drumettes. *Nachos-piled high with cheese, meat, beans, sour cream and all other fixings that you know are not good for your heart. *Pazookie-cookie of choice served a la mode.  Signature dessert for BJs. Expect a long wait but you might be able to sneak into the bar seating area if you stake out there for a bit."
Christina G.,"San Jose, CA",362,473,144,4.0,1/12/2009,"Barbeque chicken pizza and avocado egg rolls. Need I say more?  A word on this location.... it's well managed, so the service is usually prompt and efficient.  This implies that others in the Santa Clara County area (i.e. Cupertino) are not. Word of warning... good time for lunch on a weekend is around 11:30, you will still find plenty of parking right near the restaurant.  Wait another hour and you're up the creek without a paddle! :)"
Roxana F.,"San Jose, CA",10,17,5,4.0,4/19/2011,The best chicken ceaser salad and pizookie I've ever had.
Casey B.,"San Jose, CA",9,56,13,5.0,4/21/2008,"PIZOOKIE, you my only friend. Sorry Abba-Zaba. They sure know how to make delectable pizza-cookie creations, but their pizza is no bueno. But I am not a fan of the greasy dip dish kinda pizza, so if that's what floats your boat you might enjoy it. The honey-crisp chicken salad is my favorite thing I've ordered there so far. Appetizers, pasta, sandwiches, and potatoes are just so-so. Anyway...back to the pizookie. We order a chocolate chunk pizookie party platter for everyone's BDay at work and if we have a seminar you better believe we order BJ's. They deliver too! (well, on days they have a driver anyway)"
Maxx L.,"San Jose, CA",24,126,26,1.0,10/12/2006,"Crusing by for a late lunch (3PM) on a thursday with some friends from out of town, I figured we'd just stop off for a quick bite to eat and a few brewskis. To say the service was 'Bad' is misleading - the service was literally non-existent!!!! We waited at the desk to be seated for 15 minutes, and not only did no one come up to us (the desk was unmanned), but there was an employee sitting there filling out a form that told us that we COULDN'T seat ourselves!! The phone rang about 10 times without being answered, and the place had maybe 4-5 tables with people and a few characters at the bar. I spotted about 10 employees (servers, bartenders, the chick filling out the form) hanging around - but none of them offered to seat us or go get whomever was responsible for doing so. We eventually left and went across to PF Changs - I will never set foot in this place again, and strongly recommend no one else does either... well, unless you're trying to hide from the cops, in which case they'd never find employees to question. AVOID!"
Rev. Dr. Christopher J. G.,"Mountain View, CA",501,520,1,3.0,9/4/2008,"OK, I don't hate this place, but I always feel a little bit, I dunno, let down when someone suggests the place for a family gathering or friend's birthday. I mean, it's not bad, in fact the food's kinda good, and the service ain't bad half the time. I guess the problem is that like so many other places , it's got nothing that stands out.  That's not true. The portions are big enough to view from space. From orbit you can see the Great Barrier Reef, The Great Wall of China, and BJ's Meatloaf. I will say that if I go, I finish my plate and then like a python, slither under a rock and sleep so that I won't need to eat for another week or two.  The waitstaff tends to be good...except during the rush times. Then it seems they put the gruffest of them out there, making the meal take even longer and the grumpiness even more pointed.  The place seems kinda fun, but it's also loud and often crowded. I come back about three times a year: twice for birthdays and once when Mom decided she hasn't seen her baby-boy in too long."
Tomas C.,"Mountain View, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/29/2011,"I've always had good experiences at BJ's. Went there again on Sunday and was greeted by attentive staff and great beer. Our waitstaff changed mid-shift but food and drinks came out without a hitch (thanks melody). My only complaint would be that the hostesses seemed to not know exactly what they were doing. We were quoted a 15 minute wait, waited around 25 minutes, and then when we walked to the table we saw 5-8 open tables with no diners..."
Jesus R.,"Mountain View, CA",0,15,1,1.0,6/3/2013,So we came in and we were told we had to wait 20min we were like ok maybe its busy.. 20 min later they walk us to our table and to my surprise I only see 5 other tables. We sat there for 20 more min unattended so we decided to leave there was another couple that showed up 5 min after us and got sat before us to. They did the same thing.. no service here. I get better service at the DMV. The olive garden across the street was a better choice..
Yvonne And Dennis G.,"San Jose, CA",4,9,12,2.0,4/4/2013,"So I asked my husband to pick a place for pizza since we had the three younger ones along to go on dads lunch hour. We were really excited because he said there were rave reviews on yelp about the pizza   we walked in we were not appropriately greeted by the hostess and actually to my dismay disregarded that we were even there and went on with her conversation.After what I thought was a rude welcoming she finally decided to greet us.The next hostess did a little better job and asked us how we were  and kindly seated   me that is a big part of the ""restaurant experience""and they failed in that   the kids got kids menu pizzas, and we ordered a medium pan pizza to split.The waiter was average but he didn't seemed to thrilled to be there at   the pizza arrives and looks delicious but it is not at all piping hot and the cheese is barely melted.I could not see or taste any sauce at all.The one good thing was that the toppings did taste good and fresh.After mentioning this to the waiter the manager did come over and comp us for  another pizza.But really ,we are not going back for the pizza ever.Who  wants cold pizza,maybe the kids but not me I need piping hot pizza that I can barely eat.If I wanted cold pizza I could have stayed home and ordered it.The waiter service was also very average.He didn't even bring us cheese and peppers and we had to flag him down after walking past our empty glasses on the edge of thte table which Im pretty sure he saw after walking by five times.Overall gonna have to give them 2 stars...... One for the lousy pizza one for the average service if I can call it that.The indoor seating was packed and the ambiance was nice with a lot of people talking we were seated in a huge booth which was probably the best thing."
Denise A.,"Salinas, CA",12,49,61,4.0,1/11/2011,I came here for a friends birthday. We had a very LARGE group and we all arrived at different times but our waitress was awesome and didn't make us feel bad about asking for several different checks. My friend and I split the Santa Fe rolls which were okay and also the ribs that came with minestrone soup a whole potato dressed with cheese and bacon. The soup and potato were good and the ribs were tender but there wasn't but BBQ sauce on it and none came on the side. The drinks were delish and didn't shy away from alcohol which was refreshing. The food was okay but the service (and company of course) made this visit.
George G.,"Chico, CA",45,116,36,5.0,12/2/2010,"My cousin took me out here a few month ago when i was visiting san jose. Food is always great here especially the pizza.... but the main reason i go to BJ's is for the dessert. I always order the Pizooki (i think thats how its spelled) its basically ice cream on top of a freshly baked browny.... Absolutely delicious. There is always a long wait at this place, from my experience at least. Once you make it inside and whether you choose to sit at the bar or at a table, the servers are great, very friendly, and most importantly they are quick!"
Pearl V.,"San Jose, CA",1246,993,3794,3.0,1/13/2008,"It's pretty sad when the best part of your meal was the side house salad. But that's how it was for me tonight. Okay, this place is either a hit or miss. I've had good experiences here in the past with the food, but tonight was not one of those nights. I ordered my usual fettuccine alfredo but opted to add shrimp instead of chicken to 'switch things up a bit'.  And may I say that my pasta was super BLAND... (seriously, no taste whatsoever!!!) and the shrimp was way undercooked for my taste (I wish they seared it for some texture rather than just boiling it or however the HELL they cooked it). Boyfriend ordered the New York strip steak (medium BUT it came out medium well). He barely finished half of it because I think it was way too chewy.   When our server asked us about the food, we didn't bother sending it back because... well.... we've all watched that movie ""Waiting"", right? I didn't want any ""garlic salt"" added to my tasteless pasta. GROSS. Haha. So I just lied and said that everything was fine.  What a disappointment, though.  This place is usually pretty busy on the weekends, but we were seated in about 15 minutes, as promised. Maybe because it was a Sunday. Our server seemed like she was maybe having a bad day, but she did her part in checking up on us every now and then, so I won't ding her on her service. It wouldn't have hurt anybody to crack a smile every now and then though.  This place is a fun place to go and have drinks with friends and/or watch the game. Kinda on the loud side though, so probably not a good place to take your grandma to dinner unless you want to keep repeating yourself throughout the meal. I wish I could give it a higher rating but tonight's dinner was truly a disappointment. Maybe my next experience will redeem this place. I'll update the rating in the future. ______________________________ Their BBQ chicken pizza w/ cilantro is pretty good. I think you can opt out of the cilantro if you're not a fan, though."
Victoria Y.,"San Jose, CA",239,679,,5.0,10/19/2008,"Bj's has always been a staple for me. It has always been a meeting point for me and my girls, or a family dinner, or a chill time with friends.  The wait can be horrible on weekends especially but to combat that I always go shopping to pass the time. By the time I'm done shopping I've def worked up an appetite.  I love the food here and I recommend all the pastas and burgers. I'm not a fan of their field of greens salad- just a weird combo and it didn't go together.  At this location, the manager and hosts are amazing. So sweet and very helpful. We were lucky enough to get a booth this time and a wonderful waitress named danielle. She checked up on us constantly and always had refills on hand. She was so nice and an ideal waitress. The only time we ever had to flag her down was to get our bill but we found out that we were overcharged on the dessert so she was trying to find the manager to fix it before she gave us the bill.  Usually bj's has overall really good service and its just a nice atmosphere to be around. I mean isn't it great to be able to watch tv and drink beer/eat with your friends outside of a house?!"
Gerald K.,"San Jose, CA",32,99,17,1.0,3/17/2013,We wanted to eat out kind of last minuet. We arrived to the the desks estimate of 45 minuets. So we walked the mall. We returned under our estimate time only to be told an additional 20 minuets. 30+ later we asked what's going on?  To the lame answer of we are busy. Finally our table was ready. Our server did his best but our food was over cooked to the point of dry chicken our daughters mini corn dogs soaked in oil and over brown and hardly eatable. To top it all off the we orderd a pizookie that  was badly burned. I will not be returning here again.
Ajay K.,"San Francisco, CA",42,61,3,4.0,1/28/2011,"A great place to go, espcially when there's a game on. Think of it like a large sports bar with tv's everywhere. Food is great too. Deep dish pizzas, huge baked potatoes, and great sandwiches. Nuff said. Word of advice though, this place gets busy (especially on weekends)."
