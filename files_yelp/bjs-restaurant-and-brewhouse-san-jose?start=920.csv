christine l.,"San Jose, CA",1,11,,4.0,10/25/2011,Some friends and I went to BJ's and had a great time. The service was a lol slow but overall I think its a great time if you want a sporty/dining place to enjoy
Rob C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",9,59,,4.0,7/25/2006,"I'll chime in here and agree with everyone else: the service can be hit or miss, depending on the server you get.  The last time I was at BJ's we got a funny server that totally met our needs and checked up on us every couple of minutes, refilling drinks and checking on our food.  The time before that I got a server who tried to interact with us as minimally as possible and really didn't do much, and we had to ask her several times to do this or get that.  Bleh.  And weekend evenings are the worst, waits up to an hour or more just to get a table are possible.  I avoid the rush hour and come after 9pm, when it's a minimal wait (most of the time).  Shout outs to the artichoke-spinach dip appetizer, da sourdough burger, mz. blonde ale, and my boy the pizzzoookie!  Ya'll make me fat and happy."
Mia M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,32,,1.0,2/17/2010,I gave BJs another try.This time the customer service was awful.We came in on a weekday just before 2 it was fairly crowded.We asked for a booth they said it would be about 25 minutes.After about 30 minutes I saw a booth being cleared off.Since we were the only 2 people left waiting I assumed it would be ours.I went into the restroom and left my companion sitting by the hostess.When I came out they had seated a couple who had just walked in to the restaurant at the booth.I immediately went over to the manager who claimed the people had already been sitting there.It was a blatant lie. I saw with my own eyes the table cleaned off my companion watched the people walk in and get seated.The manager than changed his story to yes we made a mistake .  I would have expected more of an apology a free soda something.But BJs really has a lack of understanding of what customer service means. My dining dollar will continue to go elsewhere
Steve S.,"San Jose, CA",0,17,,2.0,9/4/2013,"We went there for dinner on a Saturday night. Parking is horrific!!! The place was crowded but only a 25min wait so not too bad. Opted to sit in the bar area. Here is where the service sucked!  Never offered water, no utensils. Sensitive, rude waitresses. You want a good tip, don't be afraid to be playful. Don't be a snob. The food was pretty good and drinks were ok. Won't be back unless we're desperate."
Stacy Y.,"San Jose, CA",6,22,6,5.0,2/22/2011,This place like many resturaunts gets very busy! But that's because there food is so great!all I have today is pizooki!!! So yummy :)
Karen S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,219,49,2.0,5/13/2010,"Gourmet Mac n Cheese?? I don't think so.  Was very bland I felt like wrapping each noodle around a thick slice of bacon and then deep frying them to perfection.  Maybe immersing them in a hot bowl of melted cheese!! The pizookie was okay, nothing mind blowing!! Haven't tried my C0hicken Alfredo I lost my appetite.  Would I order here again? No."
Jenny C.,"San Jose, CA",116,199,59,3.0,9/25/2010,"As a restaurant chain you can't really be impressed with much. The food overall was good but it was all about the BOOZE! I had ordered the Berry Cider, my bf had the Harvest Hef and our friends Joe had 2 Piranha pale ales and BJ's Jeremiah Red®; as for Laura she had 2 Pomegranate Sunset. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly that we tipped $20 straight to his pocket. It was a good experience none the less and the oreo/oatmeal pizookie was a great way to end the night"
Zakk D.,"San Jose, CA",78,684,33,1.0,1/23/2007,"I really wish I cold give half star, or bump it up to a 4 but the staff really  is hit or miss.  I've had fantastic service and I've had to trek up to the bar to get water for the table.   Out last visit as a going away happening for my fiancee (went to Japan!) was certainly one of the better stops.  The waitress was great, keep the beers flowing, had some friendly banter and sat down and chatted towards the end of the night.   The pizza here is the same as all others, and if you get a good staff person, its a 5.  If not, the 3 is fair. Update: We'll I've been here a few times since the initial review and the service that used to be hit and miss is now firmly in the miss.  Our waiter yesterday was a joke.  Total nightmare.  screwed up the food, the drinks, was never again, seemed to be pissed that someone would *gasp* not want pickles on a sammich or want Grey Goose instead of well vodka.   1 star.  This place is going downhill quick."
Fraulein C.,"Santa Clara, CA",1187,656,126,5.0,8/27/2008,"Okay.I hate that I'm a fan of this place BUT it's because I love how they make my salad and their appetizers are pretty good compared to Chili's and Applebee's. YumMm.Honey Crisp Chicken Salad and their avocado egg rolls. I can't forgetPAZOOKIE!! Trust meyou'll understand why I love it. Cookie baked on the bottom and topped with a large scoop of ice cream on top. Yummay!!!  Anyway, this place is a lot like Chili's and Applebee's but they serve deep dish pizzas which isn't half bad. If I wasn't in the mood for salad, my boyfriend and I will order the buffalo chicken pizza with a side of blue cheese/ranch dressing and chicken fettucine alfredo. Pizza itselfnot too spicy but tangy which gives the pizza a good richness to it. The pastahmmmnothing too spectacular. Tastes the same. Nothing new to bring to the table. This is a brewery, so give their beer a try. You can sample each one off the menu.  There's nothing special about how the place looks, just a family-style (homey-feel) restaurant. This and the Cupertino location are always packed, so come early around 6pm for dinner OR a late lunch around 1pm-2pm. If you plan to make reservations, expect to have at least HALF of your party to be there on time or else you'd have to wait because they need to accommodate others that are waiting for a table. This place is good for birthday, graduation, or for whatever occassion it may   just seats a large group.  Their servicedepends on the day that you come. Varies if the restaurant is busy and they're short on staff. They really do think about their customers, so cut them a break. It's a lot harder for Chili's and Applebee's to seat a large party on such short notice for 35+....so I had my birthday at BJ's. Both of the waitresses were friendly and kind. Especially if a majority of them are obnoxious guys who get grumpy and just want to eat right away.  Overall, best place to eat and having a good time with a big group."
Sherry W.,"Berkeley, CA",104,183,196,3.0,8/25/2008,"Two phrases: sassy waitress, 18% gratuity. We had 10 people, but 18% seemed like a bit much when the waitress kept mixing up our orders and interrupting our conversation with lame comments. After our entrees and pizzas arrived on the table, we had to play Musical Chairs/Plates to make sure everybody ended up with what they ordered. Luckily, BJ's made up for that with three words: Beer, pizza, pizookie. BJ's lets you sample whatever beer you like before you order your glass or pitcher, and they all tasted pretty darn good. The Hef is a little nutty or wheaty, I can't decide which, but in a good way. And the pizookie is so good that I'm sure Sesame Street would rename Cookie Monster or at least give him a brother if it could. ""Pizookie?! Scrumgobblegobblesnarf!"""
Bernardo M.,"San Jose, CA",416,52,,3.0,11/9/2010,"BJ's is a nice place to hang out, but some of the servers are a hit or miss - sometimes, they're nice, sometimes not so nice."
Kevin P.,"San Jose, CA",20,88,98,5.0,12/14/2010,"Food here is excellent. It also depends on what you order. I'd prefer you to order off of the Pale Ale menu, with their finger sandwiches (my best reconmendation), Pale ale nachos (2nd), pale ale baked potato (vegitarians), and pale ale beer and you're good to go."
Jeff T.,"Morgan Hill, CA",29,22,20,4.0,1/24/2011,"Great food and huge selection. If your a deep dish pizza lover, trying BJ's is a must. The cheese burger pizza is always a crowd pleaser.  For an extra 5.00 you can valet your car and skip the hassle of parking. Expect a 60- 90 min wait during peak hours."
Alishea A.,"San Jose, CA",21,1,1,2.0,8/13/2014,"So I thought getting my car towed, being extremely late to work and just having the worst day ever was the worst my day was ever going to get...WRONG! It is my boyfriend's birthday so I decided to forget all about my horrible day and treat him to dinner at BJ's. Now usually I get excellent customer service and get our food fairly quick, not today. Our server Corina came by and she seemed nice, took our orders and said she'd return with our drinks. Like 5 minutes go by and I start getting really thirsty wondering when my drink is coming, no big deal they finally come. Now again with the waiting game this time about 20 minutes go by until our food comes, way longer than usual but hey they might be busy....instant letdown as soon as the food hits the table. My bf ordered a chicken TORTILLA soup only to see no TORTILLA Strips, no avocado just plain chicken soup. Next, he ordered Wedge cut fries with his burger and guess what he got? THIN cut fries. Also I specifically asked for 3 sides of ranch before the food arrived, do you think it got delivered? No. At this point we both are very annoyed I mean after all its his birthday and they messed up only on his order! Seriously? He tells her everything that was wrong. She returns with the same soup he had already eaten some of and adds it to a bowl of tortilla strips & avocado. Is it not common sense to serve a fresh new soup since it was not done properly the first time..obviously not. Now it's refill time and that takes about 10 more minutes, I see our server walking around the ailes offering to refill everyone's waters. um hello where's our drinks you said you'd be back with 10 minutes ago? She gets to our table and says ""can I get you guys anything?"" Our drinks would be nice! Her response ""what drinks?"" Are you fucking serious right now! After telling her what we were drinking she said "" oh yeah that's my bad""and walks away................how much slower and forgetful can you be?! She obviously didn't care for her tip with the way she portrayed her service. Needless to say my boyfriend's birthday dinner was an embarrassment and BJ's just ruined my night even more. Hopefully they train their employees to move quicker while getting the damn order correct."
Anna D.,"Birmingham, AL",20,173,4,4.0,5/31/2008,"I've dined at this location a lot. I love their rootbeer and the pizookie is to die for! I love ordering their appetizers for takeout and lunching with my friends at the park. Their Santa Fe spring rolls and bruschetta are awesome. You can get full just from the appetizers! Their portions are huge too so you'll have enough leftovers for another meal or two. They're almost always busy so you know the food is good. I have one complaint. I came here with my mom and sister. We ordered appetizers and entrees, which came with side salads. The appetizers came quickly. But then the salads came just a few minutes after the appetizers, and then the entrees came another few minutes later. We got everything almost all at once and barely had enough space on our table. I wish they had timed it better."
Waterman H.,"Berkeley, CA",0,17,,4.0,2/7/2010,"WATER Service: Water service is everything. I will usually get down to the bottom of my glass at Bj's before it gets filled up. On busy days I just have to rely on drinking 'Boob's aka watergirl's' water. Basically, if Bj's was a desert on busy days...I would be the first one in the restaurant to pass out and die of dihydrogen monoxide deprivation. As orgasmic as the cookie n' cream pizookie's are, without my glass filled Bj's is blue balling me. :( Food: We love BJ's Brewery for on-the-go, sit-down, or late-night snacking. Usually I go to BJ's because it is reasonably priced for food that will satisfy any craving, however, recently we go to take advantage of their great Happy Hour Deals.  Happy Hour M-F (3-7PM), Sun - Th (10-12PM) 1/2 off Mini Pizzas $2.00 off Appetizers $1.00 off Cocktails $2.00 off Draft Beer Mini Pizza:  -Spinach Artichoke Pizza is to die for. The ranch is deliciously creamy and the artichoke hearts are tangy and entire combination compliments each other. Appetizers:  - Buffalo Wings are a 5 -Mozzarella Sticks are -1 (taste straight out of a year-old Costco pack) -Spinach Artichoke Dip 3 (good as a filler, however, too salty for my taste...CPK's is better) -Shrimp Lettuce Wraps 3 (really sweet) -Chicken Lettuce Wraps 5 (definitely a NASAL opener...woooweee strong ginger wasabi stuff/thing/sauce/idk),  -Calamari 2 (Tastes straight up like fried batter) Beer:  It is beer, enough said. $5ish a pint, $13ish a pitcher. Though the ""Belgian Nit Wit"" tastes like BOLOGNA. WTFFFFF Watergirl loves the pomegranate sunrise. I don't know why, it just tastes like that strawberry's wild, or razamatazz stuff they serve at that one place."
Christina S.,"Seattle, WA",1,9,1,5.0,7/16/2009,"BJ's not only has amazing food, but also great beer and fabulous service! My husband and I first went to BJ's with some friends from work and we immediately fell in love with the place. I highly recommend the Mediterranean Deep Dish Pizza if you are in for a change, it's super yummy! The atmosphere is very laid back. Definitely a place you can take your family to, or just to go with your friends.   The place is usually extremely busy in the evening, so if possible, try to make reservations. Otherwise five stars!!!"
Yezel R.,"San Jose, CA",46,49,41,4.0,9/6/2010,avocado eggrolls. great ambience. friendly staff. terrible parking. awesome pizookies. beer.
Tom C.,"San Jose, CA",95,7,,4.0,2/25/2011,I've been here couple times the great food today I had the shrimp scampi it was bomb! The western burger here is good as well great place for drinks they have many selection of beer for beer lovers. Only thing about this place sometimes the wait is annoying. Oh yeah their fried calamari is good.
Vicki G.,"Snohomish, WA",67,14,4,4.0,2/23/2011,The food here is not the best I have ever eaten but it's good.  I'm not usually a fan of chili but I love the chili here.  I seriously crave it.  This is one of the first places we thing of going when we want to go out for lunch or dinner.  My 7 year old loves it too.
