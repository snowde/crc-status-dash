Lindsay T.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,456,20,4.0,8/10/2006,"I had a really nice time here last night.  The restaurant was very accommodating for my 7 person party.  I called in early, they suggested, since they don't do reservations for under 10 people, that I come in a 1/2 hour early.  That was fine, I came at 6:30 and told them a party of 7 for outside.  I had the option of either getting a buzzer or to give them my cell phone number so I could walk around the mall  I chose to wait outside, so I went with the buzzer.  I thought this was a very nice feature for a chain restaurant to have. When we finally sat down, the waitress was really attentive, and we never waited long for what we ordered.  She got everything perfectly - I asked for things to be removed from my salad, and it came out great.  The beer was good, the pizza is deep dish and kind of like pizza hut, but it tasted good, the appetizers we had - avocado egg rolls, bruschetta and spinach/artichoke deep - were all great.   BTW - they only take up to 6 credit cards if your party is going dutch. It only gets 4 stars because it's a chain, and I generally despise them."
Aashish P.,"Milpitas, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/10/2012,"Pathetic service! My friend and I took a table at the bar around 10pm. After waiting there for around 20 minutes, we were finally able to order the appetizer. After that, there was no one to come to our table and take the order for the main course. We finally told one of the other servers that we wanted to place an order and he told us that he would get our main server. We waited for another 15 minutes and there was no one to help us. Finally, my friend and I got up and complained to the manager about the poor service. But even his attitude was wasn't very friendly. We just paid our bill for the appetizer and left the place. I have been to many other BJs locations and all of them have exceptional service. The service here was just too bad. I will never come here again. P.S: There is a BJs at Cupertino which is pretty good. I will always go there as it is much better in terms of customer service."
Tien H.,"San Jose, CA",51,19,,3.0,3/23/2010,My favorite dish is their appetizer chicken wings other than that everything else is average and below.  Their service is all right but they are so pack.  I go there for the 7 tasters and the wings.
Jay S.,"New York, NY",50,157,,4.0,2/6/2007,"BJ's is a really fun place to go.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and they do everything pretty well. I have had their pizza, which was great, and their beer sampler, which I would reccomend to everyone.  Their calzones were not quite as good, and the giant potato wasn't as good as I've had elsewhere. The dessert, a ""pizookie"" was one of the best desserts i've ever had. The oreo one was the best I've had. I would go here just for dessert!  I had my 21st birthday here and it was the last thing I remember about the night, so it must have been good!"
Berg W.,"Sacramento, CA",94,298,1,3.0,4/30/2008,"BJ's is the perfect model of corporate inefficiency. You know how these busy places give the buzzers to their guests now. Well, there comes a time, when that's not really necessary. When there is one person waiting one minute for a table, you don't need to bother with the buzzer. The hostess could simply say, ""You're table is ready."" So when there was not a wait, the hostess entered our name in the computer, programmed our buzzer, gave that to us. I imagine she let the computer know our table was ready, which activated the buzzer. We took the buzzer back to her, and she directed us to our host, who then seated us. All of this happened in like 2 minutes. Another example of technology making things a lot more complicated then they have to be. BJ's makes perhaps the greasiest pizza on the planet. I'm not one to shy from a slice at Pizza My Heart dripping with grease, but BJ's takes it a little too far. To be honest I came here with a grease craving. I ordered the avocado egg rolls. Whoa. Incredibly rich. Avocado and cream cheese deep fried. Then I split a small BJ's Favorite deep dish with my GF. It looked kinda small, but there was a heck of a lot of grease packed into that little package. The crust was a like a grease soaked dough ball topped with extra grease. It tasted pretty good, but I felt like I weighed 500 lbs afterward. Their desserts are equally over-the-top. Just because you can make a pizza-sized cookie and sell it to people doesn't mean you should. Nobody really needs to eat that after all the grease they already had. We were awarded a free dessert after our server neglected to bring me my beer until after the food was finished. Although I couldn't really eat it, I had to accept it, and it was the sad finish to a greasy nightmare. I ate about two bites and waddled my bloated ass out of there. The beer was less than notable. I tried the porter, which was pretty good, but the red was boring and poorly crafted. Service was pedestrian...typical corporate chain service."
Dean Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,545,9,3.0,6/10/2008,the food is alright.  get the cookie dessert with vanilla ice cream.  The service is poor.  You always have to flag down a waiter.  Also the TV screens are not HD which is a drag-  they need to replace all screens.
Sophie R.,"San Jose, CA",2,47,29,2.0,10/16/2009,"well.. i went with my coworkers for some app. and drinks.  The food was really good.... However, the service sucked!!  Here was our nite in a nutshell:  1. we have only one table setting for 6 people. (we waited for 3 ppl)  2. they brought us our app. but left NO plates.  3. the rest of our party arrived.... and it took that dumb broad more than 15 min to come back to our table.... mind you... she passed by our table at least 6 times before she stopped to take their drink order!  4. She called the older lady at our table ""sweety"" which is disrespectful.  5. It took her more than 10 min to bring us cold glasses for our pitcher!  6. i watched our 2nd pitcher sit a the bar for more than 20 min before she brought it to us.  7. She came to our table only once to ask if we needed anything.  I can recognize that she was probably busy, however, if she should have told us something like "" hey guys! am sorry it's taking me a little longer, but am really busy"", we would have left her something ""small"" for tip!  However, she didn't... so, needless to say... we didn't leave that broad one red cent for tip, and i spoke to the manager... she was very helpful and listened to what i had to say and she gave me a gift card.  so be aware... that the food is good.. but the service sucked."
Norman D.,"San Jose, CA",1,4,,2.0,4/2/2013,"I came in 4/2/13 for a early dinner.  Dining area was sparse at best.  I was impressed with how many selections were available on the menu.  Ordered our drinks and Calamari.  When the Calamari came out, i noticed we didn't have napkins or utensils.  i actually had to steal them from the table behind me.  The Calamari had no crisp.  it was barely hotter than warm and were soft / soggy.  Two bad signs.  My Wife ordered the Salmon and Lobster and I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger.  Oh, forgot to mention, while waiting for the Calamari to come out, I noticed that people that were seated after us were receiving their appetizers.  Another bad sign.  After finishing the Calamari, we waited for our main dishes.  And waited.  And waited.  I actually seen a table that seated AFTER we finished the Calamari get their main orders delivered.  I waited patiently.  Our server came out after awhile and told us that the kitchen finally got around to working on our order.  Apparently the kitchen FAILED to prep the Lobster this afternoon and was just getting around to it now.  As he apologized he said the Manager was really sorry for the inconvenience and would be coming by to speak with us and probably offer a complimentary desert to make up for the mistake.  I told our server I would look forward to speaking with his Manager.  Long story short, WE NEVER SEEN A MANAGER.  I asked my Server where the Manager was.  His reply was ""He specifically told me he want to speak with you and would be by.  They must be busy.""  My server did make good on the Complimentary desert.  Overall, I'd say the food was mediocre at best.  Kitchen Service was a FAIL.  But our Server's Customer Service was EXCELLENT.  Our Server's name was Kevin C.  He was attentive.  Recommended certain dishes. and was very personable.  Kevin was the only thing about BJ's that stood out.  I found out the Manager's on duty was Andrew Barenborg and Tina Purpura.  You two get a big FAIL from me.  Fail for Customer Service and Fail for making sure your Kitchen Staff was fully prepared for Dinner Service.  I won't be back.  Not even expecting the Management, Andrew or Tina to even care."
Eddi K.,"San Jose, CA",2,24,,4.0,1/25/2009,"Hi, I'm Eddi and I'm an ADDICT, pizza addict. I guess the plants were aligned and the moon was full  (big and yellow) the day I discovered this pizza. I love love love the Deep Dish Barbecue Chicken Pizza:   Hikory-smoked BBQ sauce, red onions, tomatoes, CILANTRO and BBQ chicken breast sat on the pizza beautifully. A hot personal size pizza, fit for a person with a fair appetite, and can be sliced into four decent slices.  Filling I must say, to-go'd the rest of it. Service: usually packed during din din time, so anticipate waiting.  Decadent. Flavor country in my mouth."
Cathy C.,"San Jose, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/5/2013,"I know this is a busy place, but...  I love their food and beer, but service for people with kids should improve.  I ate there with a 2 1/2 yr old in tow.  They brought her food last, including a pizookie.  She had already eaten mine when they got around to bringing hers.  Toddlers should ALWAYS be served first.  Always!  Love the food but won't go back if I'm with the family.  Maybe they don't want families there?"
Maritel C.,"Hayward, CA",253,284,7,4.0,1/18/2008,"BJ's Brewery has a pretty decent deep dish pizza, but the 4 stars is really for the PIZZOOKIE!! I mean, who doesn't love a freshly baked cookie topped with cold vanilla ice cream! It's like heaven in a mini pizza tin.  We went on a Friday night around 6pm (big mistake) and saw the oodles of people waiting for a table, so we headed to the bar, to hunt for a table. First words of advice: Be aggressive and if you see someone with a tab or empty plates of food, kindly ask them if they will be leaving soon and most will be kind and obliging.  This BJ's bar area is pretty small compared to the one in Vacaville, so I felt like I was being a bit intrusive on others standing there in the middle of the bar next to someone's table waiting for someone to leave. But, in the end our patience and kindness and aggressivness got us a table. Words of caution: Do not order the appetizer thin crust pizzas! They are disgusting! I can make better pizzas with a tortilla in my microwave! Instead order a real pizza, which is worth the wait. Being that is was happy hour, the appetizers were $2 off which is Ok, so we ordered the sampler which was more than enough food, for me and my fiance. The only thing I wish the sampler had was some nachos on it! Oh well."
ChRisH B.,"San Francisco, CA",28,13,1,4.0,8/31/2010,"This place is where we go when we just wanna chill. Late night happy hour's a must: $2 off da appetizer, $1 off for drinks and $5 for mini pizza. So far so good bartenders are nice and friendly. The wide screen tv's are everywhere making you updated with sports. Restrooms clean. Beers are good: blonde(light) + chickenwings + chicken pesto flatbread and who would wanna miss the ""pizookie"". This place never fails us. We go home happy from the late night happy hour."
Allison R.,"Santa Clara, CA",49,161,52,4.0,7/25/2010,"Yay for gluten free pizza!!!! I'd heard BJ's introduced it a couple of months ago, but just got around to going last night (their GF menu isn't on their website, but the pizza is listed on the regular menu, and there are a couple other GF items available as well). Their GF pizza is delicious!! The crust was definitely one of the better crusts I've had. It was cooked perfectly and the price was much better than some places I've been to. I believe it was $8.95 for a cheese pizza, and then the cost went up as you added on the toppings. I got Italian sausage, roasted garlic, roasted peppers, and cilantro, and it came to $12.95 (WAY better that the $25 I've spent at some other restaurants that serve GF pizza).  The minus one star is because I'd heard they also have Redbridge GF beer, so I was very excited to be able to have pizza and a beer when I went out with my friends. But much to my dismay, they were out :( It is nice to know that a brewery is willing to carry a beer made by another company for dietary needs though. I did decide to try their GF berry cider, but I don't think I'll do that again. It smelled like old lady perfume to me, so it was a little hard to drink. But yay for the pizza (I would've cried if they'd been out of that too!)! And thanks to these large chains jumping on the GF bandwagon :)  (Side note on this location: parking SUCKS and it's almost always packed, so either make a reservation, or be prepared to wait)."
Joanne W.,"Morgan Hill, CA",37,20,1,4.0,1/11/2011,The service is fantastic and the food is just ok. Sean the bartender makes up for the food. This is a great place to go on Sundays for football.
David L.,"Fremont, CA",24,368,24,3.0,4/1/2007,"I had wanted to come to a BJ's after studying a menu that I picked up from their San Bruno restaurant.  Their menu selections range from deep dish pizza, pasta, sandwiches, traditional meat dishes, to stuffed potatoes.   I chose the salmon entree ($15.95) and asked to switch out the rice pilaf with their baked potato.  I have never seen a potato this big, which unfortunately dwarfed the salmon fillet.  The steamed vegetables was bland but at least made me feel good about eating them. It also came with your choice of soup or salad, so I'd say it's a pretty good deal.    The restaurant was nearly packed on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30 pm, so imagine what it must be like if we came at 6:30 pm.  Our waiter was earnest and helpful, but our drinks and food did take a long time to show up.  Good choices for kid's menu as well, all for $3.95, which includes a drink, but sundae is extra for $0.95 more.   Bottom line:  Big food portions.  The menu tried to have a little bit of everything to please everybody."
Bernard L.,"San Jose, CA",567,178,27,3.0,1/1/2009,"Decent food and decent beer. It's not that great to warrant the parking nightmare that you'll face if you come on a Friday or Saturday night. What were they thinking when they put BJ's Brewery, P.F. Chang, Buca di Beppo, and Cheesecake Factory next to each other? They built the parking lot big enough to only accomodate maybe 2 of those restaurants' patrons. My advice is to come early or be prepared to circle the parking lot dozens of times to find an available spot. A lot of people give BJ's more credit than it deserves in my opinion. Sure the pizza is good, but the beer? It's not the best beer that I've had. Their hefeweizen is okay but I still prefer the real German stuff. I guess what makes this place somewhat appealing to me is the pizookie dessert. Tell me who doesn't love ice cream slabbed on warm cookie. Mmmm."
S A.,"San Jose, CA",56,13,,5.0,3/4/2013,"Went in with the family yesterday. Was a bit irritated because we were waitng 20 minutes for our food then another 15 -20 for our deserts. The waitress was nice and we were patient up until my daughter started getting antsy. The waitress was not keeping us to date which is a pet peeve, and I felt like our patience was getting taken advantage of.   talked to the managers one of their names started with a Z . Anyways they were amazing! Got our stuff our rignt away, apologized and basically went above an beyond. Its important for your guests to feel like they matter and that is what will keep them loyal to your location/facility so kudos! I will reccomend this location to everyone!!  This could of been a - star review but because of the great management it brought it up to 5!! A smile and im sorry can go a long way!"
Michael H.,"Hayward, CA",319,1403,650,3.0,5/27/2008,"I would definitely choose this place over a TGIF or Applebee's for it's relaxed atmosphere and decent food.  If you have a group bigger than eight people visiting during evening hours, you'll most likely have to wait awhile to get a table.  The servers are relatively hospitable. Generally if you have a huge number of people, they'll sit you outside so that it's more private and generally easier for the wait staff.  What's helpful is that they set up a plastic tent if it gets windy or cold. The food is so-so; kinda hit or miss.  You just have to think in a broad sense when choosing your order.  Nothing really stands out.  One time my friend had a huge b-day bash here, thus the manager setup an all you can eat pasta bar -- a pretty cool deal, but again the pasta was so-so. The rest of the menu is your typical American bar food.  Burgers, sandwiches (hot/cold), steak, chicken, and deep dish pizza.  Getting two deep dish pizzas and sharing is a good idea. The pizookie that is somewhat legendary is just okay.  Yeah I said it!  Hahaha.  It's definitely good if you've been on a diet.  But if you eat crap all week like I do, it's nothing special.  You're better off making a huge one at home and scooping insane amounts of ice cream on it.  Wow I sound fat. __ A good alternative to the crap American food chains.  A nice place to watch the game with a beer or to have your b-day dinner.  Just don't expect much."
Harrison W.,"Aptos, CA",14,13,,5.0,2/24/2013,"One of my favorite restaurants, the one thing I miss the most about San Jose. Really good Chicago style deep dish pizzas, home-brewed beer and specialty sodas(the cream soda is great). Very nice atmosphere, kinda metropolitan-like. And they have a specialty dessert called a pizzooki, which is a giant hot cookie with ice cream. This place has some downsides though, the parking lot is ATROCIOUS, one of the worst designed ones I've seen, and you're going to be waiting quite a while, they don't take reservations either."
Alex N.,"Campbell, CA",1,25,18,4.0,12/5/2012,"Food is good. It's a trendy,  overpriced chain restaurant. They have some great beers though...which is really why we go, the food is an afterthought. If you like a good strong beer the Jeremiah Red is what I would suggest."
