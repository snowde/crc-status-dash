Spencer H.,"Milpitas, CA",403,222,,4.0,5/19/2010,"We had a group event here with about 20 people or so. The service was great and our food was good for the most part. I don't recommend anyone getting the pasta for their party as it is disgusting and bland. The pizzas are so delicious and thick here. Not only that, they are super generous by allowing you to take boxes of leftover food home. I took like more than half a pizza home along with a box of salad. I would recommend this place for large party events as they do an excellent job accommodating one."
Kelle Belle J.,"Los Gatos, CA",6,41,19,1.0,3/7/2012,"Decided to call ahead and put our names on the call ahead list. When my fiance and I arrived on a Sunday night it was busy and we were glad we called ahead. The hostess gave us a buzzer and we sat down next to the hostess stand on a bench after she told us it would be about 10 - 15 minutes. About 30 minutes later we are still waiting and we start seeing them seat people that were after us, but I didn't nag them because I have been a hostess before and I hate when people ask ""how much longer?"" 10 minutes later my fiance convinced me that we should go talk to the hostess and when I went up there to let them know we have been waiting well past the estimated time, she told us she already called us......I was stunned. I told her we had been sitting next to her the whole time and we were never called. She said ""oh....it actually looks like your buzzer malfunctioned so we called you on the loud speaker"" I told her that's not true and I named off the two different names she called on the loud speaker. Then she had the nerve to say ""see this right here (pointing to the loud speaker)....this is what we called you on."" She is not even the one that calls the names, so she was just assuming someone else did it. I was so mad that she was being so rude and lied straight to my face I was speechless. Then she turned around and had one of the hosts take us to our table with NO apologies or compensation. Worst customer service EVER here. This is not to mention the last time we were there one of the servers dropped his tray of drinks on my fiance. Don't get me wrong, I love the food and drinks at BJ's, but we will be making the drive to the Cupertino location from here on out."
Jamie C.,"San Jose, CA",37,32,,4.0,10/2/2009,"Big Fan, Usually Great Service, Awesome Food, Try the Jeramiah Red, It'll knock you over.  Fun atmosphere, really good place to meet for drinks maybe watch a game.  Not Quite or Romantic, Fun Fun Fun."
Russell D.,"San Francisco, CA",128,40,97,3.0,5/7/2011,"I have been here several times for lunch and normally it is a work lunch. Today the service was ok, the host that sat us was nice but did not seem very sincere and was on the phone for a while before setting us, our  waiter was good and everything was pretty timely, my soup and half sandwich was also good, I really like their Iced Tea and my coworker really likes the Flavored Iced Tea and wanted to watch a game so it worked out but its not my favorite lunch spot. I enjoyed BJ's so much more when I was eating fried foods! It seems much harder to get good healthy food here."
Allegra I.,"San Jose, CA",66,228,7,3.0,4/14/2008,"This place is good if you're hungry and want a drink.  Parking here is insane so be prepared to circle the parking lot for 5 minutes or more. The bar/lounge area is nice and the bar is well stocked.  The few times I've been the bartender was cool and the drinks from the menu were good. If you like caramel apples, try the Poisoned Carmel Apple. It tasted just like a caramel apple lollipop! It sounds strange, but go for it. I'm a big fan of baked potatoes and potatoes in general, so the fact that the menu has lots makes me a happy girl.  I like the chili baked potato. If I'm not in a potato mood I usually get the Buffalo chicken pizza.  It's like buffalo wings on a pizza, minus the bones. Consistently good food and service, shitty parking."
Reilly T.,"Campbell, CA",1,5,,4.0,3/19/2011,"I enjoy coming here then catching a movie after. The only two things I dislike is the parking outside the mall and the long looooong wait, but if you set those two negatives aside, it's a cool place to hang out with some friends. The food is really really good too, and a chocolate chip pizookie for dessert just puts the icing on the cake."
May C.,"San Jose, CA",69,183,3,4.0,12/14/2007,"OMG! Have you guys ever tried their AVOCADO Egg Rolls?!?!? OFF THE HIZZZOOOOK!!!  My cousin and I ate here for dinner last night and he ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls as our appeteasers. Truthfully, it didn't really sound that appealing at first... but after my first bite... WHHHOOO WEEEEEE! I couldn't stop myself. I'm tellin you right now, I'm getting those EVERY TIME I go to BJ's from now on.  Pizza's good. I normally get the ""Great White"".. Pazookies are GREAT. Strawberry Lemonade is good.  One bad thing: The wait can be a biznatch and finding parking can be a lil pain in the butt......"
Jessica B.,"San Jose, CA",117,62,,4.0,1/4/2008,"My experiences of this place have been quite good the only draw back is that they're always busy! Its located in the mall so parking can be a bit of a hassle.  The food is OK...a bit overpriced but one thing that i do absolutely love...PIZOOKIES!!!!!!! OMG it is the most delicious cookie and ice cream dessert ever!! I only go over there for it! Servers can be a bit rude at times considering what time of the day you go, but overall id say its a pretty nice place with pretty good food and great dessert!"
Marevie T.,"San Jose, CA",1823,674,26,3.0,5/5/2007,"Allow me to explain... how ""bootsy."" I know all of the girls have the potential to be somewhat of the cheap-but still good looking- gals that could run for a spot at Hooters, but got damn it. I felt like the girls had to pose at every stop, even to just give me my food! I used to work for a modeling company, how would they have known to audition?! Hahaha I'm joking (about the auditioning part) but its like, damn it... just be super cool and gimme my food! El Plato! (wait is that spanish or tagalog? Shnaps). I give it 3 stars because the pazookie will always be my favorite, and the salmon cesar salad. The two stars are missing because  A) My alcoholic beverage had no ALCOHOL at all! That was all just.. flavor!  B) Took hella long to pay attention to me and my boyfriend... just for an extra fork! (Nope, sorry couldn't take the one from the table next to me haha)"
Jamie M.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/16/2011,"Had my office holiday party catered by this place.  Horrible.  Arrived at the agreed upon time for pickup...it took 45 minutes for them to complete the order.  Our party had already started without the before we even left the restaurant.  By the time everything was loaded in the car, the food was cold.  When we unloaded the food...there was salad without dressing...pasta with barely any sauce on it...approximately 1/2 cup butter and sour cream for 4 trays of baked potatoes, and about 8 servings of pot roast for 40 people.  For our ""trouble"" they offered $115 in gift certificates for  an $800 bill.  Our party was ruined.  I will never go back to this establishment, and I will make sure that anyone at my company with over 4000 employees knows not to use BJ's Brewhouse!"
Jenny H.,"San Jose, CA",32,47,22,4.0,5/7/2008,"I've been here so many times. And majority of the time, it's pretty good. The food, service, and etc. However, don't go on a holiday such as Valentine's Day. I went one time on a quadruple date (on stupidity) and it was horrible. But the management there handle my entire bill! (it was about $250). If you decide to eat here, you MUST try the pizookies! It is excellent! Sometimes I crave the pizookie and I just go and buy their desert!"
Nichole M.,"San Jose, CA",112,72,21,2.0,5/31/2011,"Sarey was the meanest surver I have ever had here, I come here at least 2-3 times a week and have the nicest servers. Heather, Kimber, and some of the others (I dont remember their names) are some of the sweetest servers, but when I asked Sarey for something on the kids menu, which I order all the time, she proceeded to embarress me in front of my friends, going so far as to ask, ""how old are you?"" As a server myself, i would never go as far as to ask a customer that, a sale is a sale... Besides that, after i decided not to eat anything, it almost seemed as if she was relieved! As angry as i was, i cooled off and decided to go for something else, yet even after my friend joined us at our table, she continued to ignore us. My friend was waiting so long, she just ordered her drink from the bar instead. When my friend did finally did, not flag, more like, grab her attention, almost demanding to take our orders, she took them while walking away! RUDE RUDE RUDE, We LOVE BJ's, and will continue to come here, but not as Sarey as our server."
El Guey de San Jose U.,"San Jose, CA",2,13,,4.0,6/21/2009,"I give it 4 This place is cool the pizza is like Chicago Style Pizza, and Chicago has some of the best pizza i ever tasted. I like the plasma tvs,  service, food, full bar(even tough im not 21 yet but its cool they got one),and the outdoor seating area too. I also like that they're open late. The pizookie's are huge me and my friends always have to share it The only thing that sucks its that its always full in the weekends and it sucks finding a close place to park and then you have to wait to be seated but they give you a little alarm thing to carry around (meanwhile you can walk around the mall)to let you know when your table is ready. And its a bit pricey but overall it a chill place to be"
Farshid G.,"San Francisco, CA",5,14,,3.0,8/1/2010,I live very close to oakridge mall so this place is my favorite there . The california burger is a must try and their beer selection is really good I love the Jeremiah red But don't even think about getting wings here It has become worse and worse over the years Overall this is an awesome place to hang out and enjoy the food :)
Gloria R.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,3,1,1.0,2/5/2013,"So we went yesterday for an early dinner. We were greeted with fake smiles and quickly seated. Then nothing...we waited...still nothing...we waited...after 10 minutes of not being acknowledged or helped, and after seeing another table that was seated after us being helped, we walked out. I told a co-worker about my experience, and she related a bad experience where everyone at her table but her got their food. They offered no explanation, no apology, no discount, nothing but poor service. We will not be back. We will, however, go to the one in Sparks, where we had great service and great food. Too bad this location doesn't care about the reputation of this franchise. Even when we left, and my husband commented ""Thanks for nothing,"" the guys at the front just laughed as we left. They didn't get it."
Manoj J.,"San Jose, CA",3,29,1,5.0,9/4/2010,"They have great service, ambience and food. When they mistakenly got another item, they just took it back and brought  the correct one quiclkly. Their deep dish pizzas are really good. They have an excellent choice of beverages in the alcoholic and non-alcoholic area. Even though the wait times are high, this place is worth the wait. There is high demand as there are many people who like this place. This particular location is also good as it is  in Oakridge mall. So you dont need an excuse to come here."
artie l.,"Santa Clara, CA",8,74,,1.0,8/26/2012,dont even want to give one star the waiter said something came with the promotion they had and it did not was overcharged by 16 dollars service was very slow food was cold manager did not care no refills on tea or ice water very poor service
Tom E.,"Menlo Park, CA",29,124,,4.0,6/28/2006,"4 stars for the very good selection of beers and very tasty food. Their beers are nicely organized by weight, so you can pick the one that goes best with your mood. The something something red (yeah yeah, I forgot the name) was just a little sweet which worked out perfectly, and their porter looked great but I didn't get to try it. Their brew specials were a bit boring, but I've only been there once. The food was very good, I had the bbq chicken salad and it was fairly well saturated with chicken, corn, sauce, all the good things. I was hungry, so could finish it, else you may want to take some home. My friend got a pizza which looked very good and I hope to get one next time. The place was packed, but the service was still good, and although it lacks the pub atmosphere (there were families, kids, and a huge room full of people) I think it is a great place to have a beer, some food, and socialize."
Denny L.,"San Ramon, CA",42,55,,3.0,2/16/2010,the happy hour 5 dollar pizza is such a good deal! Beer and Pizza is an awesome combination. I haven't been in this place in a minute but Im about to go tomorrow. I recommend the white shark. =)
Cody G.,"San Jose, CA",28,100,4,3.0,2/6/2007,"Yeah, I frequent this place because it's close to home, the beer is good, and the happy hour specials are pretty good - especially the 1/2 price mini pizzas.  Also, seating has never been a problem - I never wait more than 5 minutes for a table.  Just gotta know the system ;) Seeing as I'm a happy hour junkie here, I'm well acquainted with the pizzas and the appetizers.  Love the lettuce wraps, love the buffalo chicken pizza.  Black and tan is good, rest of the bar selection is pretty good too.  Don't really choose to go when it's not happy hour, though."
