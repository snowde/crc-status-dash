Krystal N.,"Irvine, CA",92,571,5,3.0,4/23/2007,BJs is always hit or miss. Even the one in Cupertino is off at times. One time I came here and the server jumped into the booth with us...to seem more friendly? I don't know but I was weirded out. I've never found anything that I really like here but I'm sure I'll be back for someone's birthday someday. People always seem to have birthdays here! The one thing that I must get everytime: 1/2 choc chip 1/2 oreo pazookie!
Myka W.,"San Jose, CA",135,134,15,5.0,11/29/2007,"I love this place. This is my default place when I don't know where else to go. It's all about the avocado eggrolls! I love those things. Can't go there and not order them.   Last night my hubby took me for my birthday. HE got the nachos...way to much food. I got the Chili in a bread bowl. They have really good chili.  The top of the bowl was toasted and buttered like garlic bread. Just that made me smile and warmed me up.  My only little thing was that I thought it had too much cheese in it. My chili was closer to the color of cheese....lol...my man loves it that way, but that's not me. I'll just ask for it on the side next time. Anyway, our server was great, the egg rolls were spicy again (they stopped making them spicy for a long time) and I have half a bowl of chili waiting in the fridge!"
Jefferson M.,"Tarzana, CA",109,65,9,3.0,12/17/2007,"Date night.  And this was the wrong place to go.  Very noisy.  Our waiter hung out with some friends at the table next to us.  He forgot my iced tea.  But we got a new waitress in the middle of our meal.  I'm not sure who the tip went to.   However, the multiple stars are for the food.  I had the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad.  It was HUGE, and perfect.  I had leftovers the next day. Their Strawberry Lemonade is awesome too.   Positives:  Great food.  Huge portions.   Negatives:   Noisy.  Service is hit and miss."
Lisa T.,"San Francisco, CA",149,105,16,1.0,3/12/2011,"Me & my boyfriend were craving ribs from BJ's so we decided to come to this location since it's close to school, but this location has the worst service ever! Me and my boyfriend went to BJ's at Oakridge and the waiter we had was horrible. He totally gave off a bad vibe from the start & since then, he barely acknowledged us. Within 2 minutes after we sat down, he kept pressuring us to get our orders in, & when we asked him to give us a bit more time, he totally rolled his eyes and walked away. He was also the waiter for the people sitting behind me which were older than me & my boyfriend & they were well.. white, so the waiter was SO MUCH nicer to them than us. Me & my boyfriend was observing some people he was waiting that day & his attitude changes depending on people, ugh racist much? When we were done with the menu, he just kept walking by us pretended we weren't there & when we said ""excuse me, we're ready to order"" he just continued walking. We finally got our order in & when our ribs came out, they weren't even HOT or fall off the bone good like the other BJ's we have gone to. After we were done, he asked us if we wanted dessert & I think he wanted us to get some, but we weren't just feeling it so when we said no thank you, he looked at us weird like we were cheap or something & then came quickly with the bill & THEN started being nice asking us if we needed anything. Maybe he just wanted a good tip? well too bad, he didn't deserve one so he should be happy we even left him the change. I don't recommend this location AT ALL!"
Tom L.,"San Jose, CA",1,28,,3.0,5/23/2008,"Great place to get a beer, if you don't mind waiting.  The pizzas good, the sandwiches are above average, the appetizers are weak.  All that said I seem to always get the Chili Burgers, which is great & fills you up.  The wait staff is good, except when your seated outside...the best service is at or near the bar. The hosts/hostesses suck."
Audrey N.,"San Jose, CA",273,300,110,3.0,1/25/2010,"I came here in a large group for a birthday. Been here several times with large groups and it always ends ok. However, last week, we were seated and our food took forever to be served, while another large party came about 30 min after got their food served much quicker. What's up with that? I mainly come here each time contemplating on what I should order. For sure the pizookie but that's dessert. I've had their baked potatoes, good but gets kinda ehh after awhile cause of their alfredo sauce. Their minestrone is good and their chicken parmesan. But it's not something that I must order, cause everytime I dine here, I always get something different. Food, is o-k while the white chocolate pizookie is a MUST!"
Me T.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,7,,3.0,1/2/2011,"Great to meet up with friends for a beer. And the food ain't bad either! I've dined there several times. I've enjoyed just the bar, and they also have two little tiny patios on both sides of the entrance. No view but you can get some sun and have a nice meal with friends."
Amy L.,"San Francisco, CA",135,651,469,4.0,3/9/2006,"The best BJ's brewhouse I've been to yet.  Seating feels spacious, food quality is good, beer is good too.  There is also the ""special"" seat up near the front entrance---try to get it if you can.  Times visited: 3"
Jennifer F.,"Livermore, CA",47,367,322,3.0,5/30/2006,"Good food, service is not so good. We came here on Memorial Day, when there was no wait, but plenty of people sitting in the bar area.  We ended up with a booth there to try and get faster service.  Our waitress lagged sooooo much and only checked in on us once.  She didn't even bring us our food, another waitress did.  And we had to ask for our bill before we could lose her again.  The food was good, the service was not."
Jessica L.,"San Jose, CA",332,79,,4.0,8/31/2007,"BJ's is a great burger house and they have a large variety on the menu. I've enjoyed the salads, pizza and burgers there, but my favorite item is the pizookie. It's a must try, but make sure to share, since it's way too much for one person.  They have a much larger selection of non-alcoholic drinks than most restaurants I've been too, but no Dr. Pepper. The service has been good every time I've gone, but the wait can be a little long if you get there at the wrong time.  If you are going with a large group, they do take reservations but unless you are going with less then 17 they will require you to set up a contract and it will limit your food choices. This is good for banquets, but not good if you have a group of friends like mine with varied food preferences. Recently went with a large group of 16 and made a reservation but they didn't have record of it when we showed. Luckily they had room and were able to accommodate us, but I will not go there with a large group again. Luckily our service once seated was stellar and so I almost completely forgot about the ""missing"" reservation.  Therefore I do recommend them for smaller groups, but large groups are not a good idea in my opinion. Lastly, they only take reservations for large groups, but do have call ahead seating."
Kayla P.,"San Jose, CA",12,71,3,4.0,3/21/2010,"This place is probably the best restaurant at oakridge, a close second is Buca, but the food is always pretty good. BJ's is the best place for drinks and beer at the mall and every time I've gone the service has always been great. I usually always order the avocado egg rolls, which are so good! I love their deep dish pizza's, and stuffed potatoes very delicious. But by far my favorite thing here is the Cobb salad! I am always in search for a great Cobb salad, and BJ's defiantly has it. And of course the pizookie's are great, although over the years the dessert seems to have lost a little oomph but it's still pretty good. The one thing I would love to try is the beer sampler looks fun!"
Cynthia L.,"San Jose, CA",4,6,,1.0,12/17/2012,"My experience dining at BJ's was the worst dining experience i have ever had. period. The waitress tried her best but seemed overwhelmed and under trained. I will not mention her name because she was a sweetheart but my real complaint is with the management. I spoke to the GM JON CASEY after our meal was ordered wrong three times. I have never met a manager in the hospitality business that treated me as rudly as Mr. Casey.  When he approached us his attitude was as if WE did something wrong. He also seemed more focused on punishing the waitress(publicly) then trying to give us good service. He ended up not compensating us for our meal which was ruined. The money is not my complaint though. A manager should never treat a customer like the way he treated our family. I don't know if he is new or in over his head. It felt like he took his frustrations out on us. Because of ""MANAGER"" Jon Casey we will not be going to bjs any more and we will not recommend it to others, soley based on one this Managers ""approach"" to customer service."
Dee F.,"San Jose, CA",31,164,22,3.0,6/7/2008,"BJ's for lunch yesterday. No frills, traditional bar-food for a brew pub. The Pizzookie is nothing special. Prices are what you would expect, $8-10 for a burger fries add $3 for a side salad with wilted lettuce. But there again, I wasn't expecting Chez Pannise.  This is like any other Brew Pub, a high end Denny's or I-Hop.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place. On par with:  TGIF, Gordon Biersch, Rock Bottom, Outback. Above:  Denny's, Ihop, Chili's, Macaroni Grill, Applebee's. Go Back:  Sure. Recommend to someone else:  Sure."
M R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,39,,3.0,11/14/2006,"Very good cocktails. One cocktail will most probably be best....it is loaded!!!! Beers are so so ..... well its a brewhouse... not too impressive. Although I must say, they had this sampler of beers - a beer tasting of sorts...which looked good...didn't try it though.. Food was okay...we got one of the deep dish pizzas....pizza chicago's much better...Other than that i don't recall anything about the food.  I would go there just to get tipsy!"
Jonathan E.,"San Jose, CA",17,39,4,3.0,6/28/2007,"3 stars just because mostly everyone has had a bad experience w/ the service. I haven't really had any bad experiences with the staff, but then again, my fiance and I usually get the food to go. Sliders and Pazookies. That's all we get. :)"
rob. l.,"San Jose, CA",45,144,11,3.0,10/20/2009,The service here is hit or miss but only ever gets as good as OK. That said they have an excellent Belgian beer selection (you have to ask for the secret Belgian beer menu) and good happy hour prices. The food is also good when they get it right.
Li F.,"San Jose, CA",2,27,27,1.0,3/8/2009,Service has really gone down the hole.  We watched the waiters all gather around the receptionists area talking and no one came by.  Waited 15 minutes and then they were joined by the Manager.  Thought he was going to tell them to get to work but no.  He just joined in the pointless conversation.  In all that time no one came by to take our drink order or anything.  Other tables were seated after us who ordered and got their drinks.  Won't ever be going back to this place again.
David C.,"San Jose, CA",28,59,63,2.0,11/6/2011,dont get me wrong this place is cool if you like waitn for 50 min and get food you can get at denny's...imean whats the differents pizza and some wacked as tasten home made brew beer no thanks ill take my as to 7 eleven for some better beer and microwave borritos
Chan-Hua L.,"San Jose, CA",9,29,,4.0,8/23/2009,"I went there with my family and two friends this evening, and we all had a great time. We ordered bruschetta, chicken wings, BJ's favorite pizza, and grilled shrimp taco, and the food were great! My friend and I also sampled their beer and I liked Piranha Pale Ale the best. My son also liked his BJ's handcrafted root beer float. The service is also very fast and friendly."
Alan C.,"San Jose, CA",15,115,4,5.0,3/2/2010,Great atmosphere and good appetizers.  My wife and I go there now and then for a quick after work pick me up.  Prices are fair especially at happy hour
