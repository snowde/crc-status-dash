Massimo M.,"San Francisco, CA",729,245,129,3.0,12/8/2017,"As you guys know I don't often rate chains, but what the heck, I came, I ate, I drank, so here it is. This location is by the San Mateo bridge and surrounded by office buildings, Oracle is notably nearby, so you can expect a lot of local workers stopping by for lunch, HH and or dinner after work.  It is a modern look, with a good size bar - it is the BJ's look.   Wine is not their forte, but the drinks are solid, they can definitely mix a cocktail. I went simple with the food. Cheesburger and french fries, and it was really quite yummy.  Service is friendly, if slow. Do I recommend it? I don't not recommend it. I am sure you can find better in town, but it is convenient and decent so why not?"
Somphet P.,"San Mateo, CA",363,22,7,1.0,1/7/2018,"1 star for this location and BJs mobile app when it comes to customer service experience. 3 stars for the food selection.  I know this review is lengthy and long over due but please bare with me. BE CAREFUL  when using the BJs mobile app to place an order. Even after you've paid ahead of time using the app, the restaurant will see no payment status and therefore will have you pay at the counter; creating a duplicate payment on your order. This occurred on three separate occasions for me while using the BJs app that resulted in duplicate charges on my credit card. After discovering the duplicate transactions two weeks later, I spoke with the store manager and told them of the problem with the mobile app who assured me they would get in touch with their IT department. They also told me the refund could take up to ten business days and to check. After following up with the same manager three times over the course of four weeks with no resolution, I took it up with my creditors and filed a dispute. The way BJs restaurant handled my dispute was unacceptable. Please learn from my experience. Retain your paper recipes from the restaurant because I never received a refund on a credit card payment with a duplicate cash payment made at curb side.  I do hope a manager reads this review alone with a regional manager because I would be happy to discuss this over the phone a fourth time. To this date, BJs restaurant has done nothing to correct the situation regarding my duplicate payments."
Mrs J.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,17,2,1.0,1/7/2018,"I would rather wait 30-45 mins for a table, than 30-45 mins for my FOOD! We have tried so hard to give this location hope that it would improve in customer service, turn around times, and wait time, that we have come to visit on 4 separate occasions, and each one just gets worse than the other. Ultimately, we have concluded that the entire staff at BJs is unmotivated to be better at what they do, and at the same time, can't blame them while their leadership team stands around and stares at them.  On this last occasion when we visited on Jan 6th, we arrived at 7:15pm. Waited 15 mins to be seated, and 30 mins for our meals, which arrived at 8:00pm (as I looked at my watch). The server severely lacked any follow through on refilling drinks and updating my family while we waited for food arrival to our table. Once it was delivered, there was no offer to provide condiments, extra napkins, utensils, drink refills, or if there was anything else we wanted to have. Nothing. This is a very similar trend on each visit as well.  Also, when setting new plates of food down on the table, the servers never pick up the empty dish ware that is no longer needed - even the manager noticed this and had to do it herself. Again, another trend in bad training. Although the person in charge that night knew how disappointed I was, it is very sad to know that my displeasure is what it took to actually get this team to start hustling and checking on all of their guests to make sure all was well. That's a shame. This supervisor did come back to the table with me to take over for said unenthused server, but offered no apology for me or the family for having to get up  and leave the table to find her and inconveniencing her to do her job and lead this team. (she was no help), to help rectify this situation. This is leadership immaturity at its finest. Their reaction to my complaint was clearly taken personally, when all they needed to do it resolve the matter on a professional level, and realize that it's not about them, but about the BJs brand. One simple apology would have saved the night. Of course, this was not apparent for this team in Foster City.  After that event, the server was then overly friendly in providing guest service, but by then, it was coming off as the most insincere effort ever. I lost my appetite and just wanted to leave. He offered a box, but I declined. I had no faith that a clean box would have been delivered to me with the prideful and egotistical attitudes I received for calling them out on their horrible guest/customer service. I ended up throwing away a practically full plate of food. Please note that my complaint was sincere, stern, but never offensive. It was difficult for me to comprehend why they had taken my concern so personally. Very odd when your mission is to run a smooth operation. Instead, the server complains about me to the table next to us, and those customers look at me as if I had made the BJs team  do more work than they should have. It was laughable and again, immature on the server's end.  If you see that your customer is upset over something, please take the time to find out why. Don't make it about yourself, because you may not know their story. We had just traveled through hours of long flight delays, and were so hungry when we got home. Our displeasure had nothing to do with anything but fatigue and hunger, but your ""who cares"" attitude just ended any and all hope we had for this store. We may actually return again. However when we do, we hope to see that you have improved in the aspects of morale, organization, turn around times, training, leadership, and overall customer service. I'm not that ""we'll never come back"" person. Experiences like this deserve to be attended to, and the company needs to know. This industry is a very familiar to me, so I intend on making sure you make some changes. We've been to some absolutely wonderful and fantastic BJs restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas. Your store sets them down quite a few notches, which is unfair to the BJs corporation as a whole. Look beyond your walls, and try to see the big picture for the company's success. If you do that, you may just be recognized and rewarded by them as well. How is that not enough incentive and motivation for you? Good luck to you."
Eren D.,"Belmont, CA",1,13,,2.0,1/5/2018,"We have been to this location over 10 times in the last 2 years, and it had  been an okay experience until today. They were never better or worse than what we expected, so I never thought of writing a review before. But today, they deserved this 2-star review. People who work here do not care that you wait there. They do not explain what's causing the wait, just keep giving stupid excuses. We used the BJ's app to put our name in the waiting list at 5:30pm. Got there at 5:45, with just another party waiting to be seated, and were told that it would take 10 mins for our table to be ready. We were finally seated at 6:18pm, so they wasted a good half an hour of our time waiting at a restaurant that was 20% full. When I asked, they said they were waiting for a table to open, but the back of the restaurant was completely empty except for a few tables.  I asked the host that took us to our table if there was a hold up in the kitchen, which I thought could be one reason to not seat people. In an arrogant way, he pointed at two waiters close by, and said that they have to help all the people in there. So the shortage of waiters should be acceptable by guests, that's the message I got from that. What's funny was the restaurant had at least 5 waiters walking around, and even finding time to joke with each other or get into arguments in front of guests.  We noticed that nobody who helped us was nice, or cared about helping anyone, except for our waiter. The guy who brought out our pizookie basically dropped it off on the edge of the table and left without saying anything. I probably sound like I expect too much from people, but I wouldn't last more than a few months if I had a similar attitude at my job.  Not sure if this place is under new management, but we will try to avoid it for a while. The food is fine but it's just not worth it because of the poor quality of service."
Julie N.,"Los Angeles, CA",495,159,490,2.0,12/20/2017,"I came here for a birthday dinner and we were a pretty big group of people. Our servers were attentive, but one of our servers lost his voice so I felt pretty bad for him because he had to serve us and couldn't even talk - I felt like they should have given us another person, because it definitely must have been difficult to serve such a huge group of people while barely being able to talk.  I ordered the mini BBQ chicken pizza because I wasn't that hungry ($13.25??). The food came out pretty quickly and when it came to the table it looked pretty unappealing and I know it was a mini, but man was this SMALL for the price that it was. I seriously cannot believe they charged so much for the smallest pizza. It was also so MEDIOCRE - I have had better microwaved pizza. The pizza was soggy, bland, and I definitely would NEVER order it again. I was so disappointed, and that's all I could think about as I was eating the pizza - that it was super expensive and super boring. I know this is a chain, but man, I wouldn't have paid $5 for this pizza.  My friend ordered the full rack of ribs and he barely ate half of it. There was no meat on the bones, the ribs were lacking BBQ sauce, and they looked so dry looking. My other friend ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and the clam chowder was super bland and tasted watered down. My brother ordered the shrimp scampi and I felt like the noodles were NOT drained completely because the bowl of pasta was super liquidy. The pasta was bland and it tasted like straight up pasta noodles with a hint of garlic.  This place is not worth it - the food is SO expensive for horrible food. The service isn't bad, but honestly I wouldn't return just because the service is good. There are so many things on the menu, they really should just focus on a few things and try to make those dishes really good. Overall, I don't think I'd be returning for the food. Maybe for the pizookies, but that's a maybe."
Angelina H.,"San Bruno, CA",264,12,34,5.0,11/27/2017,"BJ's at Tanforan mall should take notes on customer service from this location.      The host, Chris was super courteous and polite. It was amazing getting to be seated right away. (At tanforan I've been made to wait even with open tables in sight.)     Our waiter, OJ was phenomenal. I never felt that he seemed obligated to treat us well, just because it was his job; instead, he was very genuine in his mannerisms. I love the food here; (see photos) the food speaks for itself. The pizza was the best I've ever had out of all of the BJ's I have dined at. I had to give my compliments to the pizza chef/cook, who eventually came out to greet us at my request. Thank you, Vee!"
Krisha A.,"Kaka'ako, Honolulu, HI",247,56,238,3.0,11/24/2017,We arrived at 4:00 PM and BJ's was wide open with seats. The host seemed extremely bored and practically slept walk to where we were seated. No sense of urgency whatsoever. I ordered the cauliflower pita tacos which were delicious and had a gluten-free chocolate chip pizookie. The food was good. Our waitress was very friendly and checked in on us every now and then as we dined. Overall the experience was mediocre.  I mostly returned for the pizookie.
Christine L.,"San Francisco, CA",113,141,445,3.0,10/30/2017,"Unfortunately this is one of my least favorite BJ's locations in the bay area which is such a shame since it's located conveniently in the Tanforan shopping center (next to the San Bruno BART station). My last visit here was for dinner on a weekday. Overall service was slow and unprofessional. The waiter I had gave me the vibe that he was still training because he lacked simple skills like making sure our food came out of the kitchen in a reasonable amount of time or to even check back on us at all. The food here was also subpar - one of my favorite things to get from here is their BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza. The food tasted as if it had been sitting out and was even slightly burned. Might go hand in hand with the fact that it took such a long time to come out to us. Might have been sitting in the back? Overall, this location is a huge bummer."
Claire S.,"San Francisco, CA",1260,1358,818,2.0,9/27/2017,"It's interesting how BJ's is trying to rebrand to match their modern, younger market. In my college/high school days, it was the place where you'd go for carb-heavy entrées, followed by the entirely delicious pizookies (massive chocolate chip cookies topped with a few scoops of ice cream, aka the best idea ever). This BJ's seems to be primarily a happy hour/post-work watering hole for the area. Service is pretty slow, but the drinks are extremely strong, so I guess decide what you care most about? Food is still as mediocre as ever, except now they have quinoa."
Cindy Z.,"San Francisco, CA",866,705,1110,3.0,6/7/2017,"Sometimes you just need a spot to watch the game, which was really the only reason we came here. The bar was packed, but waited a bit and found ourselves a booth. To start, the menu was incredibly overwhelming and I struggled so hard to pick what I wanted to eat. I ended up sharing the Prime Rib entrée ($26.95), which came with a soup/salad, prime rib, two sides, and a pizookie. It sounded like a great deal, but I should've known better than to order prime rib at a non-steak place. It was really fatty and it took so much work to cut into it. At least the sides were good, although the green beans had false advertising with the garlic in it. The pizookie to end made the meal all a little better though. At least I'd give it up for their drinks. We all had a round or two of their Irish Root Beer ($8.95) consisting of Jameson and Bailey's, which was yummy and a good hint of alcohol. Also, our server was very nice and accommodating, but did go missing a few times."
Javier P.,"San Leandro, CA",290,501,1782,3.0,5/17/2017,So we came here around 6:30pm. We thought there would be a long wait but to our surprise we were seated immediately. The hostess that walked is to our table didn't seem very happy to be working. She didn't smile or greet us. She brought us a missing beverage menu dropped it on the table and walked away. Maybe she's was having a bad day or doesn't like her job. My food buddy ordered the avocado roll. The presentation on it was messy like they just tossed the avocado rolls on the plate. They appeared to be old as if they were under the heat lamps for sometime. Look at the pictures that I uploaded and you'll see what I mean.  The chicken and shrimp jambalaya and pazookie were good. Our waitress was nice and very attentive and whose name I don't remember to give her credit on here. I was going to give this place five star but the hostess and old avocado roll ruined it for us.
Sandy L.,"Redwood City, CA",44,278,541,4.0,7/17/2017,"Their deep dish pizza, chicken wings, calamari and pizzokie are fantastic! Lots of seating and very family friendly. Sometimes the wait can be long but the service is always friendly and food is always reliably good.  They also have half off pizzas on Mondays, happy hour and other weekday specials. I frequently order take out pizza from here on Mondays for a cheap easy dinner. The pizza has a thick crunchy crust with a generous amount of toppings. Call ahead or order through their app! There's a rewards program where you can get a discount for points accumulated."
David A.,"Buford, GA",122,167,156,3.0,7/14/2017,"Popped in for a co-worker birthday today. Though we didn't get tanked like the large group next to us on shots, it was an ok time all around. This is typical for a BJs where it will never be horrible ... unless you show up at 7 pm. We were one of very few groups at 4:30, but by 6 the place was jam packed.   On the beer, my #1 and one of my favorite beers anywhere is the Jeremiah Red. The berry burst cider was also good today, but i was unimpressed by the porter, the LH lager, and the Oasis. For food, the happy hour specials aren't bad, but as I know from travelling a lot, you need the discount because of how high prices are in Silicon Valley. The flatbread veggie wasn't great, but was edible. The avocado spring rolls were awesome. The calamari was average. The spinach dip i think it was was very, very good. The Brussels sprouts were better than expected. We all did pizzas also, veggie, a pepperoni, and I did a five meat. In all cases they seemed a little undercooked and required a fork to eat.  The service was a little hit or miss. Despite being some of the first people there our apps were slow, and we waited a while at times for beer despite sitting at the table directly next to the bar. Our waitresses weren't rude, but their friendliness definitely didn't make us order more or tip more than 18%.  ... Overall you should never have a bad time here, other than when my wife ate something that had gotten pine nut oil on it which she is deathly allergic too accidentally 6 years ago. Luckily the swelling went down after two days."
Sofia B.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,7,1,1.0,11/25/2017,Gave us no gravy with the French roll. Sandwich was extremely dry. Want my money back. Foster city resident been coming here for years. This was so disappointing since we waited for 1.5 hours for the order (take out)! Not coming back.
Jasmine N.,"West Menlo Park, CA",208,14,8,5.0,11/14/2017,"Great time and great service! This time in this BJ's was better than my last experience in San Bruno. I brought my grandparents here to celebrate my Grandpa's honorable service for Veteran's Day. We had to wait for a bit since the line was about a 40-45 minute wait but it wasn't long til we got called to get a table. Once we got seated, it was another wait for about 10 minutes (probably due to the holiday and short hands at work). We finally got an attentive waitress and she had taken care of us with passion. I really enjoyed that! Since it was my g'parents first time here, they enjoyed their food and want to come again! Thanks for the service and giving us the discount for my Grandpa!"
Amber L.,"Stanford, CA",1,383,112,3.0,11/15/2017,Food is comforting. Had the chicken burger.  Overall good.  I would visit again for a consistent experience.  Nothing remarkable but sometimes you need normal.
Morea P.,"San Francisco, CA",28,64,59,4.0,11/15/2017,Typical BJ's / American sport bar restaurant. Extensive menu and expected dishes. We got the ribs that have a little too much fat but are very good. A salad. The calamari that were exactly what I was looking for! Thank you! And we finished with a cookie skillet...common....we had to! First timer for this dish and I was mind blowed! Loved it.
Enrique R.,"Mission Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,1/3/2018,"I was there this past Sunday on New year's Eve with my friends we were a group of six and our waiter was Chris big bald guy. Our meal was awesome he recommended us the prime rib he said was great and we agreed and best part was the pizookie that came with it at the end man. So the great thing was we felt welcomed to be there not like that shitty San Bruno bjs. Chris really helped us rethink what BJ's. Great service, great recommendations, and very funny guy I recommend him if you go there you will not be disappointed. And ask him for recommendations to. So thankyou BJ's San Mateo we will see you guys soon."
Larry N.,"Henderson, NV",46,372,647,3.0,1/17/2017,"Pretty much as the other BJ's I've been to... Same beer, same food, service was poor compared to the San Bruno one. I had a bacon blue-cheese burger which was very good. Cooked perfectly, lots of bacon & blue-cheese. Also, finally tried the pazookie!  Outstanding! Lots of TVs for games.... Not a great place, but good, familiar and consistent."
Eric G.,"Millbrae, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/7/2018,"One and done...I got a $50 gift card for xmas to this place... while the food was good, the service was horrific. It took 2+ hours... food was late and I got my prime rib 20 minutes before my kids got their childrens menu items. I also got my desert before one od my children... WT_!!!!The host could not even make eye contact with the arriving guests and our server apparently has yet to receive any customer service training. If this is a franchise, the owner needs to spend some time there. Several other people walked out."
Anita L.,"Union City, CA",347,627,385,3.0,10/8/2017,"Came on a Friday night to grab a quick bite. Luckily, our group of 5 was able to find a table right away in the bar area, which is very rare. However, we didn't seem to have a server for the whole duration we were there. It seemed there was one waitress that had to cover the whole bar area on our own, and she was so busy that she didn't come and bring us menus or take our order. I think one of the managers that was passing by happened to see that we were all waiting, so she was the one that eventually came and got our order started. Once the food came out though, there was no one that checked in on us. The one waitress did come by at the end of our meal just to bring the check, but besides that, we were pretty much left on our own. Not that we needed a ton of service, but you would think that a busy restaurant like BJ's would know better and staff more people during one of the peak times.  Food was decent though, we got the spinach and artichoke dip (one of my favs), the brussel sprouts, and the avocado spring rolls to start. I ordered their pepperoni extreme flatbread and was surprised by how big it was when it came out. It was enough to fill me up for dinner as well as be enough as leftovers for my bf to eat later that night. We did want to order a Pizookie at the end, but didn't feel like flagging the waitress again, so ended up cutting the night a little short."
Danny N.,"San Francisco, CA",1,182,87,2.0,12/18/2017,This location is my least favorite location. For some reason BJ's hasn't been the the same as the past. Service has been a miss last few times visiting this location.
Jason J.,"San Francisco, CA",59,138,571,3.0,11/6/2016,"""Burger me this,..."" - decent experience for our party of 5 - smorgasbord of options plus the sports-bar dining experience - menu serves a wide variety of typical American fare, everything from pizza and pasta to burgers and branzino, plus craft brews, plus sport - good for groups or if you need to see a game and need to eat, 241. Your experience is automatically upgraded if you are into the game/fight..without that hope for inspiring conversation. BURGER TIME: - bacon Swiss burger w/fries-very good    * large grilled patty, cooked medium - nice portion    * toasted brioche bun    * bacon was on the soft side    * pickles on the side    * mayo is automatic - note    * thousand island is auto - note - fries - good - chicken pot stickers - good - mozzarella sticks - good - hot wings (mild) - good EXPERIENCE: - sat in no time, reviewed a menu w/1,001 options (ordered the salmon w/rice pilaf too, descent) so you'll find something (hitting the gym may cross your mind), decor leans more to dining than sports bar but 10 TVs wont let you forget - service was good. No complaints - Oh, there is outdoor seating with a fine view of the Toys R Us parking lot (hey, bring your barska 10x40 monocular and see if anyone dings your car)."
Moana F.,"San Mateo, CA",56,5,12,5.0,9/18/2017,"I want to make it very that I am very disappointed at the service or lack there of in which I and my sister in laws received last night. We came in last night, Sunday Sept. 17, 2018 for my sister in laws birthday and the service was appalling to say the least. Our server  NIHAL was very inexperienced, unprofessional and unapologetic. While taking our orders she was distracted and didn't seem to know the proper use of her hand held ordering device. She didn't get our drinks right, she didn't order any of our appetizers correctly and none of our food was right.  When our drinks came she didn't know that your signature Root beer Float actually came with ice cream. When our appetizers came out, two thirds of the trio never came. When our food came out no one got their food at the same time and my sister in law, who's birthday we were celebrating, steak was over cooked and charred when she ordered a med- well.  Another one of our entrees was a completely different burger all together and another entree was so cold by the time her side came out that she didn't want to eat it. And while all of this was going on the appetizer that I ordered still never made it to the table nor did the 2 thirds of the trio we ordered. We sent the wrong burger back just to get the right burger with missing ingredients and poor preparation. For an example, the chicken burger was supposed to have gravy and none was found on it. The same burger was ordered without avocados and they were still in the burger and to top it off, the end of the tomato was put in the burger. The part that you cut and throw away with the black, where the vine connects to the tomato. We then asked for a side of mayo and when it was brought out to us the server who brought it said ""I'm sorry the mayo was sitting next to the pesto so it got in the mayo, is that ok?"" By then We had given up hope for a nice birthday dinner. We asked for the manager Max during this whole mess,  who was the shift manager for the evening shift at this location and he provided little help. Even with him present the entrees were still wrong or messed up. He decided compliment some of the meals that were a mess or never came or never came out at all but his body language and attitude by the end of our experience made the evening just an all around fail. And in the end we never got an apology from NIHAL and the manager MAX avoided us completely. I am writing because we actually frequent this location and have never in the years we've visited here and many of your other locations, had such a bad experience. I hope that this reaches someone whole can properly address this issue and hopefully train some of your staff on the proper serving etiquette in which you train your staff to have. Update:  I am so happy to finally do this update. The day after I posted this and emailed the company I got a very unexcpect call for the GM Gary, who then offered to comp our entire meal and then redo the entire experience all together. That following Friday the 22nd of Sept the same group of us returned to this location and was greeted my the GM himself and seated a table which had birthday balloons for my SIL. The entire evening was amazing and I'm so grateful that Gary reached out and took care of that situation. It was one of the best dinners we've had there and the service was just as great as it normally is! Thanks Gary for making my Sister in Laws dinner make up a nigbt of great memories for us."
Matt L.,"San Francisco, CA",55,20,,1.0,11/29/2017,Ordered through GrubHub for pick up and received all notifications as the order progressed. Went to pick up and they never received the order. Restaurant blamed the iPad for not working and couldn't offer much more than an apology. Make sure the tech works if you're going to implement such a system.
Em P.,"San Francisco, CA",503,163,127,5.0,5/10/2017,"Customer service here is Top Notch.  I ordered for curb side and they messed up my order. Good thing I caught it before driving off. Given the time I waited and the mistake I was left hungry and annoyed. I called back and the manager heard of the mishap. He came out and personally apologized. He re-made my order to my liking and it was perfect.  The manger was calm, courteous and accommodating. Restaurants can learn a thing or two from BJ's customer service. I'm a loyal customer for sure."
Sarah + Shaun P.,"San Mateo, CA",24,2,1,1.0,6/2/2017,"BJ's made their so called ""nachos' in a plastic container and threw them into the microwave. #1 soggy chips; absolutely disgusting and #2 we were eating melted plastic and didn't even know it. I hope we don't get sick. Thank you BJ's we'd like our refund now... Follow up next morning: we did get very sick. So thank you!"
Geny K.,"South San Francisco, CA",13,19,5,1.0,1/4/2018,"I really hate to leave this BJ's a bad review because I used to come here often and had no complaints on the food or services.  The waiters in the bar area are especially nice and attentive.  I came here on Monday 1/1/18 for a late lunch and our server was terriiiible.  He took forever to come and greet us (mind you it wasn't even busy, there about 3 other tables when we got there).  Then when he finally arrives he takes about 15 minutes to bring us drinks, so we decided to order right away since we didn't know how long he would take to come back.  It seemed like he would just wander into the kitchen to waste time because he would just walk back and forth between the kitchen and register (at a super slow pace) and wouldn't even check on the tables.  We got our appetizers and one of the entries together, at that point he had not brought us utensils yet,  or napkins.  I ordered a chicken Cobb salad, which took about 40 minutes to get to me.  By which the chicken was super cold and I was so annoyed that I had lost my appetite.  We had to hunt him down to ask for a drink refill or anything else.  Whenever we talked to him it seemed like he was half asleep or maybe hungover I don't know.  Anyway, the other tables that were in our area were getting really upset because they were going through the same situation as us, no utensils, no napkins, delayed orders.  Not sure if I want to come back here any time soon."
Tim Y.,Silicon Valley,53,715,4221,3.0,11/14/2016,"It's been a few years since I've been to a BJ's. A good friend of mine celebrated his birthday here on a Saturday evening. For large parties, they only  have early or late reservations available. He showed up at 5:45pm to put his name down for a table for 14. 1.5 hours later we were seated (at 7:15pm). I split a BJ's Special (combo) with a friend. The pizza was decent. I think Zachary's or Paxti's deep dishes are better. It was a busy Saturday night so the service was just OK considering we had a large party. Their pumpkin ale beer with fireball whiskey was really good. They lined the rim of the glass with cinnamon.  I don't think I'll be back to a BJ's anytime soon..."
Gautham R.,"San Francisco, CA",43,146,91,3.0,6/19/2017,"Casual place to get dinner or lunch with a big bar and friendly staff. This place gets crowded very fast on weekends, so be prepared for a wait. Also, if you call, it is picked up by an answering service. But when you get there, the wait and bar staff were very courteous and friendly. We ended up eating at the bar so we could avoid the 1 hour wait. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, boneless buffalo wings, sweet potato fries, salmon with quinoa, and mahi mahi with shrimp and couscous. All the food was delicious. However, the quinoa ended up being Israeli couscous (not quite the same thing), but was still very good. I give the food a 4, but 3 overall for the experience."
Rahul V.,"San Mateo, CA",3,6,1,1.0,5/5/2017,This is probably the worst service you can get from a restaurant. Ever !!! Here goes the list - only half of the table was given appetizer plates - for 30+ mins no one sevred even water or took drink order - eventually water was served in a broken glass. No one even changed it after asking for it.  - we were celebrating my daughters birthday and they just dumped the cake still in the box - then for 15 mins no one cleaned dinner table after dumping the cake box on the dirty table - after cleaning the table no one gave silverware to eat or cut the cake. List goes on and on.
Christopher I.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,1,3.0,12/16/2017,The food was ok but not as good as it used to be. It took forever to be seated while there were over 12 table open you could see just from the standing room.
Vish ..,"Santa Clara, CA",1,8,,1.0,12/12/2017,"We ordered lunch for 15 people from BJ's 1) there is a minimum order of $200 + 4% service fee + delivery fee 2) they took 2 hours to get the food ready on a working day lunch hour vs. listed as food will be ready in 35 mins 3) they did not even mark boxes with individual names, even though we provided details and requested to make them in the comments."
Lucy L.,"San Mateo, CA",17,162,330,3.0,5/20/2017,"Standard, decent American food and a wide choice of in-house crafted beers. The wait for a table can be long on weekends but it's better on weekday nights. Service is inconsistent depending on whether you get lucky with a good server or a less experienced one. Many offerings on the menu. It's best to stick to entrees that don't sound too ambitious. For instance, I would choose BBQ ribs over jambalaya. It's like a sports bar, brew pub and restaurant all in one place. TVs everywhere and you can watch sports to your hearts content. Portions are good, prices are two dollar signs."
Michael W.,"Honolulu, HI",428,285,522,3.0,5/3/2017,"I came in around 6pm on Tuesday and thought it would be crowded but I got seated almost immediately. I sat for about 15 minutes before anyone came to see me. The waitress that just got on apologized for the wait. I wasn't mad at her. It's not her fault the person before her didn't come give me some water or something.  I ordered the boneless wings and the peanut butter smores pizzookie. I got the wings with a root beer glaze and it was pretty good. It was like a sweeter version of a BBQ sauce. The chicken was crunchy and crispy so that was nice and the sauce was good too. I wish I had more ranch tho.  The pizzookie looked amazing. It was a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips, with a layer of pb on top, toasted marshmallows on top, and two scoops of vanilla ice cream. I tip a bite and felt my teeth hurt because it was so sweet! It tasted great, but it was unbearably sweet.  The waitress was very friendly and constantly checked up on me. I think her name was Melissa."
Sean M.,"San Mateo, CA",101,5,1,2.0,12/10/2017,"THIS IS POINTED AT THE MANAGEMENT!!!! I'm not one to trash a location unless they try hard for it. This week I have been here twice. And both times sat in the bar area. BOTH TIMES, waited more than 20 minutes for someone to take away the dishes from the previous dinners.  Please fix your scheduling issues! This BS will make me think twice about coming here in the future. That's really too bad, I've really enjoyed the new-ish menu. PLEASE FIX THIS! Maybe add one ""roaming"" helper.  I'll be more than happy to post an awesome review next time I come here (if it's up to par as it was months ago)! Wow....was almost done with this review when the waitress showed up. Gave us two menus for two adults and none for my daughter....with in seconds of giving these two menus to us...not even a chance to open them, she asks if I need a minute? I said ""for what, to look at the menu? You just gave it to me!"" This is some crazy ass twilight craziness going on here tonight! This is Saturday night...it's not even crazy busy here. (12-10-17)"
Kaelan P.,"Redwood City, CA",121,2,,5.0,10/16/2017,"Okay food here is good / alright. Tonight, I had a Bacon Guacamole Burger with a side of fries which was good. All of my family members enjoyed the meals that they ordered BUT any desserts here, whether it's a Chocolate Chip Pizookie, Oreo Pizookie,  or the Monkey Bread topped w/vanilla bean ice cream, etc... always seem to hit the spot!  Me and my family came here to have dinner tonight and the service from our waiter Steven was amazing. Everything went smoothly, food wasn't too long on a wait, drinks always got refilled, and always got checked up on. Our waiter, is the reason for this Five Star Review. So with that, Thanks for the awesome Service and a great Smile to top it off Steven!"

Thays V.,"San Mateo, CA",33,7,17,2.0,5/30/2017,"I really love the chicken wing, and all the food here is great, just sometimes here is really busy so it takes a little more of time but am ok with that because the food is good!

And the restaurant is empty so I cannot find any real reason for take so long! 50 min for a sandwich of jam and cheese... no way Jose!"
