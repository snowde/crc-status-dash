Summit S.,"Southlake, TX",6,258,2864,3.0,4/23/2014,"Pretty nice place; both for lunch and Happy Hour with coworkers and friends alike. Came here a bunch of times for lunch and Happy Hour on numerous occasions. Their lunch hour can get busy, so come around 11:45ish during the weekday to avoid lunch our rush.  They also offer some decent sandwiches. Their drinks are good; but to me, they felt a bit watery or shall I say; lacking any taste of alcohol. The appetizer specials during Happy Hour are good as well with a varied selection of items. I tried almost all of them when I went there with a rather large group of acquaintances. Their cooks do take their time in arranging each dish that you order. I noticed this even when they were pretty busy. Which says a lot about their attention to individual orders, regardless of the cost of the dish. It is nice of them to do so. I continue to go there even though there are tons of other choices in the immediate vicinity. Due to their service and courteousness of their employees."
Sreyoshi B.,"Washington, DC",117,55,142,3.0,6/13/2016,"The deep dish pizza was a disappointment. Not good at all. However, the Irish root beer and wings are delish. This is a nice place to grab a bite on a weekday evening. Not too busy, and good outdoor seating. Weekends are very busy and so I would recommend calling ahead."
Mike L.,"El Granada, CA",613,115,,1.0,11/22/2015,"Food was decent, services took forever, had ordered a veggie omelette and the size of the omelette was small along with some fruit that came along with the plate. Need to order dessert to hit the spot. This BJ's is just as bad as the one in San Bruno. Don't eat at either BJ's restaurant. Poor services."
Salonje R.,"Sunnyvale, CA",194,278,41,5.0,6/30/2016,Love the Chicken Thyme Lemon lunch special.  My waitress was really cool and had a great sense of if I wanted to answer a lot of questions or not.  Food came out in a timely fashion for the amount of people here.  Pretty loud but it is lunchtime! (For me). I would recommend this place to everyone who wants some tasty food
G. D.,"Burlingame, CA",0,17,1,1.0,12/31/2015,Worst steak ever! Don't even try! Save your money! Not even the manager came to the table and ask for my concern.
Ed B.,"Redwood City, CA",321,91,54,2.0,6/24/2016,I've had better luck at other ones but this evening was awful..the orders were wrong and one hamburger came practically raw.  the manager was nice about it and the only reason it has any stars
Tania T.,"Daly City, CA",5,9,17,1.0,6/23/2016,"Yeah,  I don't how you f***-up a Caesar Salad.  But they did that.  Half of my salad had to be trashed.  They don't know what good lettuce looks like.....can't give them no star, that's what I want to do.  So they get one"
David K.,"San Diego, CA",149,315,495,2.0,8/19/2014,"Meh. BJ's is BJ's - it really depends on the service and the kitchen. They hand you a book of a menu which offers everything from burgers, salads, to pizzas n pasta. Since this place is close to my HQ, folks like to come here. This place gets super busy - and when you get super busy - you are pretty much at the mercy of your wait and kitchen staff. That being said - out of 4 people at out table - only one of us got our order on time and correct (and it wasn't me). My food was overlooked and cold, my co-worker got a salad which wasn't the salad she ordered - so they sent it back....and returned three minutes later with the same salad. She just gave up and ate it which is just sad since you are forking over money for something you didn't order.  However......I ain't like that.  I write a reviews on Yelp ;-) So that being said - kinda disappointing comparing it to other BJ's which would typically get a three star rating for me."
Nima M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,31,1,1.0,12/14/2016,"Unbelievable shocking incident, I ordered a whole bunch of food! for my friend and I (so we could take some to go) After waiting 20 minutes to get our check and To-go box, the waitress knocked over our pizza to the floor! (half the pizza fell out the box onto the nasty carpet! She didn't even say sorry or ask if she can get it replaced! she just tucked it back in the box! We left ASAP! Wasn't going to wait another hr, this was ridiculous, big waste of time and money!"
Krissy L.,"Bronx, NY",255,203,79,1.0,4/2/2015,"I LOVE BJ's - it's always my goto for some good beer and food but just this particular location ALWAYS seems to ruin it for me. I've come here about 3 times and they're pretty consistent about crapping on me with their crap service.  The food always tastes the same at any BJ's so no problem with that BUT at this special location, they always manage to eff it up anyway by either serving it to you cold or just forgetting about it entirely.  I don't know what it is with the management or what's going on but the service is always so SLOW. I like to say I'm a pretty patient person but the first time I was here, after 40+ minutes of not receiving our food or seeing our waiter, I wanted to just walk out. Turns out our waiter took a break and the other waiter that was supposed to take over completely forgot about us and brought us our food packaged togo for us.  The second time, they got my order wrong and I had to send it back.  The third time we sat at the bar for happy hour. I understand it was pretty busy and hectic so I didn't care too much about how long it took before we ordered... BUT it was after we ordered our food, again we were completely forgotten. We had to call his attention and ask it again after 30 minutes of watching everybody who came in after us get their food before us- he was very apologetic about it but... come on. Our beers warmed up before we got our food- and we spent one hour more than we should have.  I HATE this location."
Jolie A.,"Daly City, CA",4,37,59,3.0,7/4/2014,"They have Open Bar seating :) There are plenty of tv's to catch the game. There is a wide selection of food. The ahi poke appetizer is delish! They have good cocktails including A Drink Like That, Pomegranate Margarita with a Sugar Rim, and Wildberry Mojito. They have good Salmon as a main entry. There is a huge parking lot."
Ali S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,19,4,5.0,3/9/2016,"I don't know what has changed at this BJs but wow what a change for the better!  My hunch is new management maybe?  From the phone call to order curbside pickup to the service at curbside to the food... it's a night and day difference.  I'm a local resident (by local I mean I live across the street) and BJs used to be our ""I don't feel like cooking tonight"" go-to but this last experience has changed all that.  The guy who answered the phone was great and the food somehow is on a different level.  I really can't explain it but keep on doing what you're doing BJs San Mateo cause you're doing it better than ever!"
Edmar C.,"Daly City, CA",18,32,7,1.0,5/14/2016,"Talking about poor service !!! Our very polite and no attitude server (I'm being sarcastic ) gave us attitude once we sat down, asked for our ID's with a little smirk  !! His name is Mario, I believe this is the management fault for not screening their waiter properly !!"
David M.,"Belmont, CA",50,9,,5.0,7/3/2016,So happy that they are open I went to a few places and they were closed good food good atmosphere and open late always enjoyed my local Bjs
Sandra Y.,"San Mateo, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/9/2017,"I've been to BJs plenty of time and the food is good that's why I keep coming back. however, my experience today was not a pleasant one. I'd give it a negative 10 if i can. The staff here are super lazy!! The host did not even greet us or acknowledge us. He just started walking slowly and assumed for us to follow him i guess. He handed us the menu half assed and left again without saying a word! not even a smile whatsoever! what a sloth! go home already if you hate your job! Our waitress, on the other hand, was attentive and helpful. When the appetizer was brought by this asian girl, perhaps a filipina, placed our appetizer to the table and when asked for an extra pair of utensils, she gave me an eye roll before leaving. Again, if you hate your job, GFTO. we don't need negative nancy serving us. Food is good but i will probably not be back because of the ugly attitude of people working here"
Jerri L.,"Burlingame, CA",48,21,14,3.0,2/16/2015,"Came here last night for Dinner, after spending an entire day of shopping. Tired, hungry and wanted to relax. Waiter Michael K took our drink orders and then we already decided to order. We are regulars at this place; therefore we knew what we wanted.  Sent in the Avocado Rolls and 2 small salads for our appetizer. Then told him our main dish is this one deep dish pizza we always order. (YUM!) I emphasized that the rolls and salads MUST COME OUT FIRST. I am not kidding you, 30 minutes passed. Drinks were empty, I'm already getting grouchy because NONE of our appetizers arrived, and I was shaking from hunger. Another waitress (not our original waiter Michael) came out and dropped off the pizza to the table. I looked at my boyfriend and said ""WTF?!"" I was livid.  He then came to our table and also gave me a look like ""WHAT!?"" and told me that that wasn't supposed happen. So I asked ""Then what the hell happened, where are the salads and our avocado rolls""  15 mins after we were done with our pizza; the salads and the rolls arrived, I almost threw it back onto his tray and said FORGET IT! We still nibbled and ate a little of each. The sweet manager Tina came over and apologized on his behalf and told me she'll take care of the rolls for us. Which was nice. He came back a little later to drop the check and made another mistake by adding another entire table's bill to our check making is WAYYY HIGHER than its actually really was. He had to take another 10 mins to fix. By then I've already had it. We paid and left. Probably not going to come back. Really left a bad taste in my mouth."
Richard B.,"Foster City, CA",0,27,,2.0,1/31/2015,We eat at this location about 3 times a month and normally the food is delicious. I have always been happy with my meal. This time I ordered the Louisiana style Jambalaya. I have to say that this is the worst excuse for food I have ever seen or tasted. This dish deserved to go directly into the garbage can. I took one bite and almost threw up.  This poor excuse for food was so extremely hot that I tasted it for two days. I enjoy spicey food but this was totally ridiculous. When I return I will definitely stick to the traditional burgers and fries. It's hard to screw that up. I will be back for sure because I like the atmosphere.
Danika Z.,"Walnut Creek, CA",311,101,14,5.0,5/14/2015,"Another wonderful experience at bjs and Angelina was our waitress again!!;) We had a team dinner here and were so happy to see Angelina as our waitress ;)  At the end of the dinner, the organizer praised her to her manager as well ;)"
andrew c.,"Foster City, CA",2,39,4,1.0,3/13/2015,"After 2 soggy pizzas and a mayonnaise sandwich, I should have learned my lesson about BJ's. But I really wanted a jalepeno burger. 2 bites in, I realize that they cooked the patty WITH A PIECE OF WAXPAPER still attached. Come to BJ's if you want microwaved Sysco food that could cause you bodily harm."
Gary R.,"San Carlos, CA",0,3,,3.0,10/18/2015,"The stars are for the food & of course the pizookies!! There are some really great options on the menu; great cocktails/draft beers, entrees, and desserts.  However, the service here is hit or miss. We've had some pretty bad experiences with the servers..but the pizookies will always bring us back!"
