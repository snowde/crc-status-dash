Marnie P.,"San Francisco, CA",32,70,11,5.0,4/29/2017,Our group had a really good time in the bar area.. food is good and waiter is really attentive.. a lot of parking so anytime you come by no need to worry where to park..
B P.,"Carmel Valley, CA",283,188,11,2.0,5/23/2017,I want to like this place I really do and for what it is it's not terrible but its just not my kind of place. Its extremely loud in here (terrible acoustics or it could have been the table of 12 screaming kids across from us) but I could hardly hear the waiter and I don't think he could hear us. We shared the appetizer that comes with a little bit of everything and it was all underwhelming. The salad I ordered was blah. Sometimes I think when you have that many items on a menu what do you really specialize in? Everything? Good spot for a young kids birthday or some late night or drunk eats otherwise not sure I'd bother.
Omar R.,"San Lorenzo, CA",64,344,1387,4.0,3/27/2016,"Catching up with friends to celebrate a birthday and have a few drinks and dinner. We had a group of over 10, so taking in our dinner and drink orders was a tall task for our waitress especially on a Friday night. Our waitress was amazing and humorous as well.        For starters I ordered a severed ahi tuna salad and Hawaiian flatbread pizza. The portions were quite generous and there was enough food to share with our group. My salad was huge and the dressing was sweet with every bite. The tuna was placed to the side and topped off with a slice of avocado. As for the Hawaiian pizza the portion was overwhelming and sliced in small squares easy for sharing with our group. Had a blast and drank a few. Big downer was the bill, although everything was reasonably priced, I however wasn't reasonable with my wallet. Had a great time and the waitress was excellent even checking in on us seemingly at the right time all night. Definitely a great go to spot on the other side of the bay."
Eric And Jennifer R.,"Austin, TX",16,618,37,3.0,12/2/2016,"I reserved a table for 16 people.  I called to confirm the day before our dinner.  They lost our reservations.  So I asked them to reserve a table.  The only time they had was 430pm.  I took it.  They said they would only hold the table for 5 minutes if we were late.  We got there at 415pm.  The table was not ready at 430pm.  We waited 30 minutes! I still gave them 3 star because the food was good, price was good, and the table was great.  Our family had a great time despite the unsatisfactory service."
Daniel K.,"Pacifica, CA",25,11,,1.0,6/28/2017,"Ever wonder what Applebee's would be like with louder TV's, slower staff and worse food?  Now you can find out!"
Raf P.,"Hercules, CA",13,9,11,1.0,9/20/2016,Went to BJ's last night and the experience was about the lowest on all levels. It took forever before they brought out the drinks. About half an hour after placing the order our waitress came over to apologize for not bringing our appetizer (boneless wings) yet. She said they would take it of our order and that the entrees would come out shortly. We insisted to still get our appetizer and asked to bring them prior to bringing out the entrees. About 10 minutes later our entrees were served and to my surprise there was a Mentos (see uploaded picture) in between my fries. They took back my plate and brought out the entree on another plate 5 min later. The burger and fries were cold so they probably just changed plates and removed the Mentos. Finally 10 minutes later our appetizer arrived. All in all a poor experience and nobody seemed to care about it.
Ben M.,"San Mateo, CA",57,34,4,2.0,11/23/2016,"I met some co-workers here for lunch yesterday (11/22/16) at 11:30 and despite the restaurant not being overly busy, we waiting over an hour for our meals after ordering. No bread, no explanation, just terrible service.  When my cheeseburger *finally* arrived, it was barely warm and completely overcooked (I had ordered it rare). After waiting this long, I wasn't about to send it back, but do yourself a favor and dine elsewhere until they figure out this whole ""serving"" thing. Such a bummer!"
Jason R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,50,830,2.0,3/19/2017,"This place ... good lord, with all the investment and location potential rewards it just never comes through. Always seems like a good option till you get seated, then the wait begins. Never seems to be much coordination amongst the staff nor any general priority to stay on top of the guest needs. Food is fine for a beer house and sports bar need, just the staff needs help and training."
Ashton P.,"Saratoga Springs, UT",204,186,196,4.0,10/7/2016,Great location and atmosphere.   Great food.  We enjoyed the pizza and homemade draft sodas
Louise J.,"Daly City, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/18/2017,The server Mileady was very inattentive from the beginning. It took us 10 min to get greeted which already goes against BJs gold standard. It took 5 min for the drinks to hit the table. We order all at once because we understand that it's busy. We order calamari and a medium pizza. 25 min. Later the appetizer still did not arrive at our table and our server did not even try to acknowledge try to get it for us. I called and called to try to get her attention and still no acknowledgement. I have been in this BJs plenty of times and I have worked at a different one before but Mileady did not uphold the gold star standard that was taught in training. If she can't handle the cocktail area maybe she should be moved to a smaller section so she can give full attention to.
Erik P.,"San Bruno, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/14/2017,if you are thinking on sitting outside this is the worst place. I waited 13 minutes with no acknowledgements by staff passing by. I had to get up and ask the host if anyone was going to take our order. waited another 4 minutes and still no service. so much for the patio on a nice day out
Julio N.,"Danville, CA",2,8,,5.0,5/20/2017,The patio was perfect! My friends and I we had a great conversation and our waiter was so suppler friendly!! We earched the Warrior's game on the screen Best BJ's in this area!
Mercedes L.,"New York, NY",93,13,4,1.0,11/11/2016,"Darn shame!  My husband went in to have a nice lunch at the bar today, he's a veteran. He looks forward to the specials on this day as a cool treat he shares with his fellow Military family.  He usually has a salad or fruit at his desk at work so he made a special trip to treat himself.   He sat at the bar.  The bar tender told him there were no Veterans Day Specials when he asked. Are you sure he asked?   So he quietly leaves.  Now my hubby is one to check online to plan his day and see where the specials will happen.  He's not one to complain or insist.  Knowing him he left embarrassed.  I missed his calls since I had my phone on silent.  When I did return his call he told me about his lunch then he said, ""I guess she thought I wouldn't tip her."" He ended up ordering to go and ate in his car.  He did ask again on the phone and he got the special but way to blow his special lunch date with himself and enjoy the atmosphere.  My thoughts, train your staff better.  We don't want a free meal coupon for the future. Its not a hoax, check your ""to go"" checks between 1:00 and 2:00 for today initials AY ordered a burger I believe.   Eating out is more about the experience most of the time.  One can make better food at home in most cases, unless the restaurant is very high end.  People go out to celebrate, to treat themselves, to enjoy the special service, atmosphere and decoration and yes sometimes just to eat. You guys blew it this time.  Everyone has a birthday, a mom and dad for their days not everyone has a Veteran to thank."
Rebel R.,"San Jose, CA",0,18,5,1.0,6/7/2017,Horrible service. I had to wait more than 55 mins to get a drink and I'm still waiting on the pizza. Never ever go to this place on a game night. We were here for the warriors finals and the service was HORRIBLE
Lisa B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",88,74,28,4.0,9/24/2016,"Family friendly restaurant with consistently good food. Robert was an excellent server, and service was quick and friendly."
Angela B.,"San Mateo, CA",106,146,5,1.0,8/3/2016,"I sent this email almost on 07/13/2016 with no response; not even an apology.  Good Evening,  I have spent the last few days debating on whether or not to send you an email about the behavior of your manager as well as the waiter at the San Mateo location, but with a lot of thought I think its best you know of a situation that happened last week; 07/08/2016 - 645pm My friend and I came in for dinner, sat promptly at a table in the bar and was greeted by Andrew N. who took our drink order, as well as our food order (which included an appetizer)  I was very clear as to what I wanted, the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer (happy hour was ending in a few minutes so we wanted to put that order in)  I also wanted the fish tacos with no sauce and guacamole on the side, my friend a salad with ranch and the spaghetti with meatballs - didn't sound or seem too difficult.  My friends salad arrived, and it didn't have any dressing on it so we asked the bus person to please bring some, and they did so without hesitation.  Our dinner then arrives, not our appetizer but our dinner. I first comment on that to the bus person and they go over to Andrew who then comes over to tell me that he did not put our appetizer order in and that it is passed happy hour time and the discount would have to be applied manually - all things neither of us really cared to know. But then I look down and my fish tacos are covered in the avocado and mayo sauce, I probably would have got over it and scraped the sauce off had the fish and the shrimp not been cold. But they were cold, ice cold actually.  I ask Andrew to get me a new order, and I know its not great being told something is messed up and I also know that having a customer complain is never a good thing.  About 15 minutes go by, it shouldn't take that long to make shrimp or fish - but I get it the restaurant is busy its dinner time so I let a few more minutes go by. The waiter brings my food over himself, and I immediately caught this horrible whiff of something sour and pungent - old fish is exactly what it was. The people next to us even made a comment about the smell.  I then asked for the manager, as this was now an issue. My friend had, had her meal now for over 20 minutes and was politely waiting on me to get my meal.  The manager comes over after about 7 minutes with another plate of food - I went over to touch it and he yanked the plate away and told me not to touch it. I found this to be odd, I am a paying customer I can and will do as I see fit to the meal you're supposed to be serving me. I told him how frustrated I was, and he stood there shaking like a leaf and told me ""I will take it off the bill if thats all you want""  But really, that wasn't all I wanted, i wanted to eat dinner - enjoy my time with my friend and possibly have dessert. But he was so rude and unprofessional I was in complete shock.  The bill then comes, and there it was the fish tacos no discount taken and the chicken lettuce cups.  I point this out to the waiter, who then sends the manager over - again. Shaking like a leaf, I explain to him our issues and what brought us to this point and that being in hospitality he has to suck it up and deal with all kinds of people - regardless of attitude or tone he needed to hear me out before walking away from someone.  He still shaking - with a very condescending tone asks what it is that I want, and I told him that I want the meal and the chicken lettuce wraps taken off the bill and that I would like to pay - but not before getting the general managers information.  His tone then changes, did he think I was not wise enough to know someone was above him? Did he think I was going to let this one go? I have always been pleased with the food and service I receive from this location so to be spoken to or treated otherwise was a bit of a shock - hence my delay in even sending this email.  When he comes over, after my friend and I had paid - he says he's going to take care of everything - now this threw me off. He saw that we paid, saw that my card was already handed back to me - yet he now all of a sudden is going to take care of our bill. It just didnt make sense to me or my friend at all.  I dont know what happens to managers that treat customers horribly, but I do know that being in human resources that if ever one of my representatives of the company I work for spoke to someone the way I was spoken to I would have been sure to not only give them a written warning but to probably put them on a final warning.  Now, as far as how you all handle things is up to you - but I can not see myself going to this location in the evening again knowing he was or will be there and with the possibility of him recognizing me and doing who knows what to my meal, drink, dessert or check. I know you're going to reassure me that things that I am imagining dont happen - but lets be honest here. You just never know 100%"
Caroline R.,"Burlingame, CA",21,7,5,3.0,8/11/2016,"I used to frequent this place for happy hour and dinner... The past year or so, I've noticed that they have been ""skimping."" The ahi poke appetizer is  A LOT LESS in quantity and less tasty. I always have to ask for extra sauce on the side. This goes for both San Bruno and Foster City locations (except tonight, my extra sauce never came!). I also noticed that the spinach artichoke dip is not as dense as before. Seems very light and almost ""whippy."" Still okay, but not as good. Ordered the sliders and the presentation was not at all appealing to the naked eye. The mini burgers just looked like it was prepared in a hurry with cracks and fingerprint indentations on the top bread (like it was slapped on). To top it off, one of the sliders' meat was about the size of a quarter (okay, slightly bigger than a quarter). I wanted to express this to our server, but hesitated. She must've noticed and expressed our concerned looks to the Manager, because he came up to our table to ask what was wrong and how he could be of help. I just explained how tiny the meat was on one of the sliders and he apologized and offered to give us free dessert, which was pretty awesome (had the pizookie, of course!). Despite of, I still gave it 3 because the Manager did express his apologies and gave us a free dessert, which makes me think that he will have a ""talk"" with the slider preparers in the kitchen (maybe be more strict about consistency). Bar drinks were great tonight! The bartender definitely didn't skimp on those Will return for drinks, not so much the food anymore."
Gary M.,"San Francisco, CA",2,37,35,3.0,11/20/2016,Brunch menu from 10am-1pm Saturday and Sunday. Happy hour at the bar every pro football game.
Garth S.,"Holladay, Salt Lake City, UT",31,12,2,3.0,5/18/2017,"I did an on line order and extremely satisfied with the ease of site and accuracy of the order. Disappointed with the size of the Caesar salad, I mean how much does lettuce cost any way? I had the baby back ribs and they were ok. For the money paid I felt like this was a small serving also maybe 4 to 5 baby ribs. Much smaller than the illustration in the menu.  Since this was takeout I would have like hand wipes in the bag."
Courtney K.,"San Mateo, CA",44,3,3,4.0,8/15/2016,"So - I'm going to be completely honest. I have just moved to a new city halfway across the country and had a really long birthday with none of my close friends or family here to celebrate with. I had some errands to do in Bridgepointe park when I stumbled into BJ's and was welcomed in like a regular. The bartender was incredibly kind and made me feel really happy to be there. I ordered some calamari and potato wedges with some wine (such a weird combination, but hey, it was my birthday). He told me not to leave quite yet as he had a surprise for me and a few minutes later he came out with a birthday Cookies n' Cream Pizookie. Beyond the fact that everything I ate and drank there was bonafide delicious, I can't tell you how kind and sweet this gesture was after moving all the way here from Vermont and not knowing anyone in the area yet. I just wanted to send a big thank you to everyone at BJ's in San Mateo for making a lonely, boring birthday into a lovely reminder of human kindness. Best wishes and I'll be back soon. :)"
