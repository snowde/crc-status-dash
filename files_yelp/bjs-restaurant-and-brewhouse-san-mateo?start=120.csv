Rich D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/5/2017,"Great bartending staff always helpful and attentive, and if you eat at the bar they provide great service as well. I want to say thanks to all of them, keep up the good work."
Diane B.,"Moss Beach, CA",274,324,513,2.0,11/8/2014,"What was I thinking?  Too much Costco shopping; I think it got my consumer radar off, and yes, I went to BJ's.  I used to meet my friend who worked nearby, but hadn't been here for quite awhile.  They used to have good soups and salads.  It was soooooooooooooo noisy in here... help. So I got the salad and 1/2 sandwich, which seemed like a good deal, but the sandwich options were pretty limited.  I got the ""new"" pesto chicken with a Caesar salad.  It includes fries, either steak fries or skinny ones.  I choice skinny. Already a bit cranky from the noise and the wait to be seated, I'm afraid it all made me focus on the negative.  So many different service people I can't figure out who my real waiter is. Strike 1: My 1/2 sandwich arrives with steak fries.  Since the guy who brought it wasn't the one who took my order, I decide to remain quiet about this. Strike 2:  Where's my salad?  Arrives about 5 minutes later.  Looks very tired. Strike 3:  Details, but important - The lettuce in the salad looked like it had been purchased already cut up, like what you get in  those bags at the grocery store, with lots of soggy blackened pieces like the ones in my picture.  The sandwich was made with the bread slices arranged upside down from each other so they weren't the same shape.   This meant that the all the contents around the edges fell out as I tried to eat it. BJ's, You're Out! The waitress who originally took my order did come by and noticed I had the wrong fries and offered to bring some skinny ones.  I declined.  She apologized, and I appreciate that.  Will not be returning any time soon."
Nimesh K.,"San Mateo, CA",20,24,1,4.0,11/20/2016,"I don't know why this place is 3 starred but the food here is pretty good, been twice there, loved the veg pizza, lentil soup was nice and amazing spinach stuffed mushroom but there were so few of them in the plate. Love the ambience, music is nice, sports always on tv, love the overall vibe of the place. Surely recommended. Forgot to mention, place mostly has a 30 min waiting time and they don't take reservation for same day."
Amy K.,"Foster City, CA",19,126,24,3.0,2/22/2016,"Came on a Friday night around 6:30 pm. Crowded but not a bad wait. About 15-20 minutes. The host was friendly and courteous as well as our server.  Typical bar food-- Sliders with crispy thin fries. Sliders (4) were tasty on a super soft bun. Love the grilled onions in them. Crispy thin fries (my favorite kind) crispy and yummy! Fish and chips (crispy thin).  Fish was lightly fried and a good portion. Really liked the homemade tartar sauce. Great complement to the fish.  If you want good bar food and a variety of beers and mixed drinks, I'd go back."
Stephanie L.,"San Mateo, CA",103,3,,1.0,5/20/2017,"Very unfriendly staff, had a long time waiting and they kept telling us to wait. We had a party of 6 and waited over an hour for a table they told us would be ready in 30 mins. The staff attitude was very bad, when we explained how long we have waited.  Finally after checking their computer, they said they were getting out table ready. Very unprofessional and unfriendly."
Victoria D.,"San Mateo, CA",70,76,1,4.0,9/23/2016,"I rally like this location and have been many times.  We have used curbside pick up as well as dining in.  The place can be a little load, but can most brewhouses and other restaurants that have TVs all over the place.  This last time our waiter was very kind and responsive, but toward the end he seemed to disappear for long times and would walk by without checking on us.  We had to stop him and ask him for a box, then for a dessert menu then our check.  I am not a huge fan of having to stop my waiter.  We waiting a long time in between stops.  We waited 10 minutes from the time we asked for a dessert menu until the time we were able to stop him and order our dessert. I don't know why the service changed so much during the meal.  It didn't seem to have become incredibly more busy in our section. I will definitly go again and this last service is not how we are normally taken care of."
Jessica L.,"Redwood City, CA",2,40,6,2.0,8/22/2017,Had a craving so figured I'd try this place. I chose poorly. Had steak and a salad. The salad was actually pretty decent but the steak was horrible. It was not trimmed properly. Also they served steak sauce -- usually not a good sign.
Elicia L.,"Foster City, CA",64,82,55,4.0,7/29/2016,"Thomas S. Is a fabulous server - he gets 5 stars.  Tonight's food & experience also gets 5 stars.   The reason I'm leaving a 4 stat review is because of how dissatisfied we were with our last experience here.  We took a 2 month break after that!! Overall love it here, the food is bomb.  Green Flash and Jeremiah Red are my favorite brews here. Delicious food: California Egg Rolls Brussel Sprouts Skinny Fries California chicken club, minus the chicken & aoli = (BLAT) Burgers Pasta  Pizookis Pretty much anything you order is awesome. Great job guys, keep it up and keep it consistent and I'll update with 5 stars next time if all continues on awesomely :)"
Valery T.,"San Mateo, CA",136,59,34,3.0,1/6/2016,"I was here on a Monday night around 10 pm, at this time I guess I shouldn't expect great service from a restaurant but it was actually pretty bad.... We sat at the bar which I understand the servers get really busy and it's very fast paced up here but that's no excuse to be messy and rude... The server we got was this girl kind of tom boyish you could say and I was asking her about a certain drink and she just looked at me like with the ""wtf hurry up"" look... I described it pretty well and she still had no idea. I was trying to get the berry cider and told her it was a fruity berry drink and she had no idea and looked at me all confused and annoyed.  All I ordered was the cheese dip and chips with my berry cider because I wasn't really all that hungry. And ughhhhhhhh my dip was so cold and gross.... I really should've returned it but I didn't feel like making a fuss that night at all but it was just so bad. Like the cheese dip was supposed to be warm and yummy and it absolutely was not... You could tell this was just popped in the microwave. I would never come to BJS for good fresh quality food. I would just come for the drinks, calamari, ( super yummy calamari here !! The garlic aioli is the best here!!!!!!) and the pizookies. You can't go wrong there, trust me."
Gene D.,"Mountain View, CA",3,740,71,3.0,12/27/2015,"Typical chain fare that consists of good, decent food.  But beware, most of the offerings are calorie bombs!  The choices are endless, from pizza to sandwiches/burgers to pasta.  The ""piece de resistance"" are their Pizzookies.  Think pizza sized baked cookie topped with ice cream.  Yum and OMG what a sugar rush! Service is consistent, regardless of which location you go to.  And so is their food!"
Mei D.,"Atherton, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/8/2017,"I could give 5 stars, food was good, price was reasonable, but the service was very slow. they don't have enough waiters to wait all the tables, one waiter cover too many tables."
Gabriella M.,"San Lorenzo, CA",242,6,2,5.0,3/17/2017,"I wouldn't usually give this kind of rating but in this instance I have too. Myself my mom and my boyfriend, all came in for St.Patricks Day dinner. We had a server named Kyle and he was literally the best. By far the best service I've ever received in this restaurant alone. He was perfectly attentive, gave great recommendations and was extremely friendly. We had a lovely evening thanks to him! We will be back!"
Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1546,2068,30593,4.0,8/30/2014,"A restaurant chain I was totally unfamiliar with. I see they have a huge presence in the West and Southwest, Florida, and a pocket between Maryland, Indiana and Kentucky. No presence in my neck of the woods. My first visit introduced me to a huge space that is like a cross between a Sports Bar and the Cheesecake Factory. The menu is gigantic, the beer choices are plentiful, the place was packed at 6:30 on a  Friday night. We had three entrees, a house salad, two beers, and a cider for $61. Very reasonable. Our food choices were a Thai Mango Avocado Salad for $12.50, a Margherita Flatbread ($9.75), and a Honey Lime Scallops ( from the calorie friendly ""Enlightened Entrees"" menu) for $13.95. The scallops were listed as 370 calories, so I was expecting a small plate, but man was I wrong. It was six big scallops, a modest portion of rice, and a huge serving of asparagus. Excellent on all counts. Our server was OK, not great, not terrible but solid, given how crowded the place was. BJ's is not a place for a quiet romantic dinner. But for what it is, it is very, very good."
Marcus H.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",0,3,,4.0,3/21/2017,"They were having an off night as: *they ran out of large pizza dough *the salad and chicken in the salad was cut weirdly & soggy  *the hand crafted root beer was flat and unlike the BJs root beer I always have.  However the customer service was excellent. The waitress was very understanding of our concerns and suggested other hand crafted drinks which I ended up enjoying. The general manager offered many apologies, was very helpful and took care of us.  Both the waitress and the manager mentioned they were running slower in the kitchen and they had a new chef which was causing delays and inconsistencies. While the food was disappointing, the good customer service was redeeming!!"
Ethan J.,"Berkeley, CA",29,36,4,3.0,8/2/2016,"Plus: small patio with outside beers. Excellent selection of beers, house brews not bad. Pitchers! Not difficult for vegetarians. Servers have all been really friendly. Minus: menu too huge for anything to be really good. Doubtful anything vegan, but I eat cheese so I was OK. Service can be kind of a long wait."
Snuffles B.,"Oakland, CA",43,32,47,3.0,5/16/2016,Service was a little slow here. My human friend ordered the unlimited soup and salad for lunch and it took the waitress 102277261617 minutes to check on us and ask if we wanted more! (Ok just kidding it was more like 25-30 minutes but felt like a while esp because it wasn't busy at this restaurant and we had an limited amount of time on our lunch break!) Extra star for the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie! #thosenutstho
Keniye M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,1,1.0,7/19/2015,"If I could put 0 stars I would. It might just be me but I work in an environment where great customer service is always a must have and unfortunately this Bjs does not meet the criteria. It's sad that I come in as a nice customer and yet I still get horrible & rude customer service. Like if you're having a bad day that doesn't mean you have to try and ruin everybody else's day.  All I'm trying to say is that some of the workers there need to either find a new job or get some proper training on customer service.  Other than that the food wasn't even that great, we also had errors in our order. I mean would expect everything to be right after waiting about an hour for our food but I guess not."
Luke M.,"Belmont, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/29/2017,The lady at the front was extremely rude and ruined our dining experience before it even started
Christina H.,"Alameda, CA",136,148,141,3.0,12/31/2015,"Nothing here is mind blowing on the food or beverage side, but BJs is a good place to hang out with a big group. We had maybe a party of 25 and there was more than enough room as the restaurant arranged a long table in the back for us. YUMs: (+) Big pizookie is the only thing worth eating. Literally a huge glorified cookie under ice cream. Joy from eating this comes more from having your childhood dreams come true as opposed to actual quality.  (+?) they have alcohol and make it pretty quickly  OKish:  (o) Appetizer plate = a bunch of fried things. (o) Sliders are huge, but super basic (o) basically everything else in the menu Summary: 2 stars if you wanted to eat good food 3 stars if you wanted to eat food w/ many good friends"
Patrick L.,"San Ramon, CA",319,1013,875,4.0,11/27/2015,"I've been to a few BJ's and (mostly) disliked them. However, I've been to the San Mateo BJ's several times for business meetings and I have to say it's better-than-average. Great low-cal selections, attentive service and a good environment to conduct business. I've enjoyed the turkey burger, pita tacos and chicken pesto sandwich - no fries (thank you) with a tasty side salad. I plan on returning a few more times - keep up the great work. 3.85 stars"
