Francisco Q.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/6/2017,"Despite the consitently above alright food quality and decent service this place is as much of a rip off as Herbalife or Mary Kay. I came here monday night on the pretense of having a nice dinner but that was completely overturned. As advertised the pizza was half off however 5$ margaritas were more fake news than Donald Trump on Fox news. Me and my guest were charged FULL PRICE even though on the menu IT CLEARLY STATED they were only 5$. When confronted about it, we got the full marathon run around with no real solution or explanation. You are better off driving 5 min down the street over to Dennys, atleast their price is consistent. Would give 0 stars if our waitresses wasnt so nice and attentive. You could not belive me and say this is just another bad review but this place had it coming after countless times of trying to give it a chance and kept coming back. If you want to find out the hard way what bad buisness practices are like, go ahead and come here, you wont be disappointed"
dan t.,"San Mateo, CA",9,82,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Worst curb side ever, either they are late not on time , never answer the phone for curbside or the order is wrong."
Rod C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/14/2017,"Food is actually pretty good. But If you go to the bar and Angelina is working it, go somewhere else. She does not give a single fuck. Acts like she's got the toughest job in the world. Repeatedly. Burdened just to hand you a menu. This is after coming here multiple times so she wasn't just having a bad day. Booo! If you see the ponytail and frown, go somewhere else in town."
Dominique Y.,"Burlingame, CA",144,221,18,1.0,4/17/2016,I truly do not understand the operations of this establishment. My first beef with BJs was when they advertise themselves as the nfl zone with all games featured yet cannot accommodate the amount of games on at a time. Today we were again disappointed as it is a beautiful sunny day with the nba playoffs on. They actually have a tv outside and we were very excited. It was empty out. We went inside to get a table and were told they are planning for a large party and only one server and couldn't accommodate a party of 2 outside. It was empty.  I want to like this place but I don't think so. Strike #2.
Victor D.,"San Jose, CA",0,160,,2.0,7/19/2016,This BJs sucks...  But the waitress and manager were nice to offer 50% off on check since the food was cold and served like after 30 minutes.  They could improve on his location by lot of ways ...  BJ s you pay for the quality and comfort for the food and drinks ... You never go wrong with BJs....
Amy D.,"Denver, CO",359,340,97,2.0,5/21/2015,"Yeah, totally ""meh."" Was in San Mateo for a maker event last week and a co-worker and I got to experience BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse not once, but TWICE in four days.  First excursion was lunch before tradeshow set up. Burger and fries - pretty passable except they don't even ask how you want your burger cooked. So medium well it was. Skinny fries were pretty killer. My co-worker got a flat bread pizza thing and it looked pretty standard. Albeit kinda greasy. Second trip was for a later dinner after tearing down the booth. Apparently others had the same idea and the place was pretty packed for a Sunday night around 8:30. Started with a BJ's Berry Jack Lemonade - not a fan. Too much sweet/sour - weird after taste. Southwest egg rolls were pretty good though. Went with the fried chicken (lunch portion) for dinner - tasty. Overall the food is average, but the service is  lack-luster. Our server the first time was pretty on her game, but the guy we had for dinner took forever to even greet us, forgot the ketchup we'd asked for and really didn't seem to notice us at all."
Sofia R.,"San Francisco, CA",572,667,2522,2.0,6/5/2014,"We came as a family of 6 and shared a large buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. Some of the others ordered their own dishes but I only at the calamari appetizer and the pizza.  The calamari was okay. Not very flavorful so very dependent on the sauces (tartar and marinara) which were both also not very good. Lemon, pepper, and salt  was the best combo for me.  The pizza was very big but was ultimately not a deep dish pizza. More like a large, puffy, cheesy, bread stick with special toppings. Chicken was dry, buffalo sauce was kinda sour. Very spicy but that might be me.  Our waiter was not very attentive at that time. We had to remind him to take our plates and refill our cups. Overall, bad at checking up on our table.  Overall, meh. Ehhhh."
Greg C.,"New York, NY",4,3,,4.0,11/3/2016,"I had the ribeye steak with a baked potato and Caesar salad. Food was good quality and I enjoyed BJ'S craft beers as well. Nice, informal sports bar feel."
WIlliam K.,"Ventura, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/19/2017,"When the waiter referred to the back of house situation as a ""shitshow"" I knew it would be bad. Nobody got their order in a reasonable time. Some people got their order half wrong. We were brought things meant for other tables."
Iris S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,10,,1.0,2/12/2017,Sunday lunch service is terrible.  We waited over 20 minutes after being seated before a server acknowledged us.
Rebecca C.,"Burlingame, CA",0,67,1,1.0,11/3/2016,Last time trying to call in an order.  I am DONE.  I hope your corporate office realizes you folks don't answer the phone. Disgusting......
Olivia M.,"San Mateo, CA",108,5,30,1.0,4/22/2017,"I wish I could put zero stars. The food came out all wrong. Ordered marinara with noodles, got some kind of hot pepper sauce (for a child), ordered chicken alfredo NO BROCCOLI, it was covered in broccoli. And the server Elizabeth was terrible. She scoffed when we asked for another salad with no cheese (nowhere did the menu say a plain wedge salad had blue cheese), dropped off a new one and didn't even glance at us or apologize, and had an attitude that should be smacked out of her. Steak was ordered well done, was practically moo-ing still when it was cut. Pasta was undercooked, chicken was overcooked. And to top it all off, I'm eating my pasta and find onions mixed in, I'm highly allergic and could have been made severely ill..My worst experience at this restaurant ever.."
Mike A.,"Castro Valley, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/6/2016,"Waited for over an hour to receive my food. Then when it arrived it was wrong. Food is over cooked  This is by far the worst BJ's that I have ever been to. Also the waiter had no clue that my first ,2nd choice of beer was not available. The manager did however comp the food."
Shreyas P.,"San Mateo, CA",40,125,24,4.0,11/19/2016,The only reason I go to BJs is because I like there style of deep dish pizza. Thick crust with thin topping of cheese and vegetables. I generally go on Monday as they are running the half off pizza on Mondays for a large that makes this style pizza affordable and worth it. I have had to wait really long twice even after ordering Togo and being  asked to come after 20min. They are normally full and have a nice ambience.
Ariana V.,"Mill Valley, CA",41,8,9,1.0,4/25/2016,Service is bad. Was supposed to have my food ready last night at 6pm and didn't get it till after 7pm (I called the phone number from the designated pick up spots THREE TIMES and went inside twice). Wow!
Laura F.,"Millbrae, CA",3,55,172,1.0,11/27/2016,"Walked in here around 2:45pm, proceeded to sit at some tall tables in the bar area. 2 waitresses walked past me multiple times and after 10+ minutes of not even being acknowledged I left."
Noelle V.,"San Leandro, CA",0,10,2,1.0,12/22/2016,"Horrible customer service! Do not go to this location! They do no make accommodations and are very rude. Even the Managers are very rude and don't make your experience an awesome one. If I could give no stars, I would! Do not go here!"
Sarah D.,"Pacifica, CA",50,28,24,3.0,9/25/2016,"My boyfriend and I come here pretty often, the location and food quality keeps us coming back. The biggest issue at hand is the service. The wait times are always extremely long and the wait for the food once you order is even longer. We usually have very friendly servers but it still doesn't make up for how long we have had to wait on various occasions. Our most recent trip however was completely disastrous. Upon walking up to the restaurant at least a dozen employees were in the parking lot trying to get into a car around back, that was oddS We also signed up with the rewards program so we could avoid a long wait--We still had to wait way to long even though the place was practically empty! After we were finally seating two separate servers helped us not realizing another already had? The food was fine, but the tables around us were filthy! Servers just kept piling dirty plates on surrounding tables!"
Sandra W.,"Foster City, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/14/2017,Have been here many times but today was the worse service ever food comes I have to hunt down fork and napkins then the waitress comes and must have said oh do you need silverware well I didn't hear her so I said we need forks and napkins He proceeded to be a fucking ass and really smooth says that's what I said. Never should have had to ask for it in the first place if you don't like your job quit !!!  Cause your lucky I didn't bitch slap you smart ass right then and there. The manager came by all the tables but I really after that was not in the mood to deal with her mouth anymore plays it took forever for the food to come  hand a burger that was just thrown on the plate with cold fries. Will never go there again only thing good was the manager who seemed very nice and was really trying to make sure everything was going right !!! One star due to the little brats attitude next time speak up cause under your breathe talking to customers in a loud place is just stupid.
Stephanie E.,"Sunnyvale, CA",14,17,,2.0,9/30/2017,"I went to BJ's today with two of my friends for a late lunch. The restaurant was only about 30% occupied with ALOT of booths in the mail dining area were empty but we were told we had to sit in a booth at the bar. (That didn't make any sense, but we sat ourselves.....I guess a hostess can't take to time to seat you if you sit in that area) The waitress brought water and didn't ask if we wanted to order drinks at that time. About 10 minutes later she took our drink order and NOT our lunch order until I said we were ready to order lunch. We all ordered salads. 2 came at the same time and one came around 10 minutes later (maybe they had to go to the farm and pick the lettuce?) I ordered a soda and was NEVER offered a refill even though I put my empty glass near the edge of the table so she could see it. After she passed by (doing nothing) 4 times, I held up my glass and asked for a refill. When we finished lunch (which was OBVIOUS) because our plated were empty, we waited 20 minutes and she never came back to ask if we wanted dessert or the bill........I finally went up to the hostess stand and asked for the bill and paid it. TERRIBLE experience and TERRIBLE customer service."
