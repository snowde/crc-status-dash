Simone T.,"Los Angeles, CA",169,574,1123,2.0,2/2/2016,"We ordered curbside service from here since our hotel was just around the coroner. There was no issues with the pickup and service as our order arrived on time. After that everything went downhill, I think the cook was on a condiment strike because our burgers came with no dressings at all and our pizzas came with plenty toppings and no sauce. Did not bother calling back or complaining because it was late and we were hungry. The tomato bisque soup and Caesar salad is the reason for two stars, will not order from this location again the next time we're in town, total let down."
Tim M.,"Dublin, CA",0,1,,4.0,7/15/2016,Waitress took our order and that was the last we saw her until it was time leave. Food was less than average so no desert at this BJ's After being contacted by customer service I really feel BJ's cares about its customers. If you ever have a problem let them know and they will be more than happy to help.
David P.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",2,1,,2.0,7/14/2016,"Disappointed....again.  I'm only in San Mateo occasionally on business from the UK and have noticed a steady decline in BJs over the years. Last night I ordered the Sriracha Queso Dips, with Pork Chile Verde topping, followed by a Crispy Jalapeno Burger.   The appetizer arrived and I started tucking in.  Then I realized...wait a minute...the dip is just cheese.  I drew this to the attention of my server, who said she would take it up with the kitchen.  While I was waiting, my burger arrived.  It's a good burger and has never let me down, but I was almost finished it by the time my revised appetizer arrived.  At this point I needed a top up on my soda, so asked for it. Again, I started tucking in.  Again, I couldn't find any pork.  This time the dip was cheese and chile verde. No pork!  Again, I drew this to the attention of the server, who said she's go back to the kitchen and also get her manager over to talk to me.   The server came back and informed me that there isn't actually pork in the ""Pork Chile Verde"".  Apparently its just ""made with pork""...presumably the stock.  In the UK, we have a thing called the ""Trade Descriptions Act"".  You can't call something pork chile verde if it isn't pork.  And neither should BJs.  If you order nachos with beef chile, there's meat in it. I'd expect the same for ""pork chile verde"". Anyway, I was asked if I wanted a dessert and I said yes and ordered a mini pizzooki.  Again, they never let you down. Oh, and I asked where my soda was..... When done, I asked for my check.  I was heartened to see that the two appetizer had been fully taken care of.  Not so happy that they charged me for two burgers........not sure I'll bother with BJs on my next trip to San Mateo.  There are plenty of other places that do a good burger.  And some too that put pork in their pork chile verde....."
Joe H.,"San Mateo, CA",3,7,,1.0,3/18/2016,"Piss poor service.... 45 minutes to get a water - went to the bar to get my own drink.. Food arrived after an hour for a table of four... Original waitress up and disappears after taking my tables order, never to return again. Over priced food. The list goes on. dirty tables and wait staff that could care less about serving you then"
Koby G.,"Frisco, TX",15,80,86,2.0,4/22/2016,Restaurant has a old wet mop smell. Service is just okay. I asked for a Moscow Mule and was told it was $19. Are you fucking kidding me.....
Ava H.,"San Francisco, CA",2,68,76,2.0,4/15/2016,"Service...!!  So much potential here but the service just....sucks.  Pros: - interior:  spacious, ample seating - plethora of TVs at the bar....perfect for game days - overall, every meal I've ordered were made well and sufficiently palatable.   Cons: - SERVICE!!!  Each and every time I come to BJs, service is sloooow.  Slow from beginning to end...from getting a menu to the check.  From what I see on the floor, I don't think it's a problem with the servers' performance;  I think it's more to do with servers managing too many tables.  For example, we had a server (Angelina) who was also managing half of the bar floor, which was fully occupied.  That is a lot of orders to maintain for one person and to execute in a timely manner.  Because there were so many tables with small to medium parties, it took her awhile to finally reach us.  She was by no means slow or showed incompetency; she was quite fast and running to table to table like she was on fire; bless her heart.   If management just added one or two more servers on the floor especially on big game days, perhaps it will help expedite service (happier customers) and increase customer turnaround (higher profits)."
Jeffrey M.,"San Leandro, CA",4,5,1,4.0,11/2/2016,First time here with my wife  l was pleasantly pleased good food fast service reasonable prices
MacKenzie G.,"Hayward, CA",258,98,92,2.0,2/26/2015,"I swear, this location ALWAYS messes up my order. It's so frustrating coming to this location because they can never get my entree correct.  The service was fine. We sat in the bar with Sergio, and he was very accommodating and made excellent menu suggestions. The only problem with sitting in the bar is that service is really slow.  I ordered the turkey and ham sandwich. Customized because of dietary restrictions. Don't toast the bread. It arrived toasted. Bacon crispy. Bacon was barely cooked- they had to bring out crispy bacon. Add cucumber. Cubed cucumber arrived on a separate plate for me to put on my sandwich. Cucumber was so small that it all fell off. No tomatoes. Add avocado. Fries. Received a salad.  What a joke. Sergio had it removed from the bill. It was entirely disappointing and unappetizing. I hate toasted bread. They offered to remake it. ""No I don't want to wait another 15min for you to remake the sandwich. We have places to go to after dinner."" I was pretty pissed about receiving a salad instead of fries, but the sandwich being wrong pissed me off more.  I'm sick of this location. I won't be back."
Amanda W.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",2,4,,4.0,11/13/2016,"I have been here several times and each time the staff is helpful, courteous and the food is good. Its not something spectacularly different but I enjoy a chill place with a glass of wine and a large variety of food options."
Megan M.,"Berkeley, CA",2,5,3,1.0,5/23/2017,"A coworker and I decided to take a long lunch the other day and eat at BJs since it's down the street. When we arrived, no one was at the host stand to seat us, so we decided we would sit at the bar since we wanted a drink anyway. Although there were plenty of open tables in the bar, they were covered in messes left behind by previous patrons; again, we weren't all that bothered (having worked in the restaurant industry myself as a server) and we just cleared half of a high top table for us to sit at. After about 10 minutes we were noticed and the server was somewhat pleasant but unkempt looking and she half-heartedly apologized and said she would get the table cleared off for us. It took about 10 before she finally came back to us for a drink order. We got our drinks and 15 minutes after that, she came back for us to order food, I was just starting to speak when she said ""hold on, ill be back"" and just walked away. we sat there another 15 minutes and nothing. no server in sight. keep in mind, it was not packed. it had actually thinned out even more than it was when we arrived. So if you've been doing the math, we've now been sitting there for 50 minutes and have received 1 drink. Finally, I got up and found another server to close us out. Our original server came back all huffy and when I said thank you she just shot me a dirty look and stormed off again to go ignore more customers. We walked to red robin across the way and had food and drinks all within 20 minutes. Service here is awful."
Prerna A.,"Burlingame, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/19/2017,Zero stars if I could have given. Pathetic service. Worst i have seen in a while.!do not come here and spoil your dinner experience . Stay away.
Sam S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,16,,1.0,11/2/2016,"I was taken here by family and friends for my birthday last night -- AND I HATE THIS PLACE!!! FOOD SUCKS, SERVICE IS SLOOOOOOOOOW, AND YOU WAIT FOREVER FOR YOUR DRINKS!!! I tried to have them take me to a real resteraunt,  but they wanted to watch the World Series game. There were seven of us, drink orders got screwed up, half the ordurves (sp?) came out before our drinks arrived, and we never saw the other half. Two ordered the Chicken Alfredo dinner and there was six small pieces of chicken BETWEEN THEM!! Two of us ordered the Rib Eye medium. Mine came out medium RAW, and the other was well done!! The other three ordered a pizza which seemed just OK. After dinner they wanted to buy me dessert BUT I SAID NO LET'S JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! Avoid this place at all cost!!!"
D D.,"Boston, MA",53,36,12,5.0,5/4/2016,"I was inspired to write this review after my son, upon arriving at the restaurant, excitedly told me that it is 5 stars. It is one of his favorite restaurants. As for me, I would give it 4 and 3/5 stars if I could. A little less than 5 because occasionally an entree isn't quite perfect. Overall, the food is really good, or solid, depending on what you order, the service is great, and they always try to make things right if you aren't happy. My favorite menu item is the Parmesan crusted chicken, followed by the sriracha Brussels sprouts. Good beer selection too. Really easy place to bring kids, catch a game, have a brew, etc. it's always been an overall win whenever I've come here.  Ps. They have tons of TVs showing various sporting events, great for kids and sports lovers alike."
The Way Of The T.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/11/2016,"OMG!!! Worst restaurant ever!!! I get there. SUPER crowded, extremely cramped and really stuffy. This is just the beginning. As soon as we get there, we have to wait 45 minutes until we are seated. WTF? After 45 LONG minutes, we are finally seated, but wait, there's more, they take 15 minutes to ask for our drink orders, and another 15 to actually give us our drinks. Finally, after they give us our drinks, we order. Fast forward an hour and a half. Still no food... OMG!!!!!! Finally, the waiter shows up, and its, get this... THE WRONG ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Still waiting, and had time to write this review.  Summary 1. Cramped, stuffy, loud 2. Long waiting time before seating (30-45 min) 3. Didn't give us our drinks for 20 minutes 4. 90 min waiting time till food delivered 5. Wrong order given!!!!!!!!"
Christopher B.,"San Francisco, CA",41,13,47,3.0,4/3/2016,I've been here enough to know its a solid location. Food and services has been consistent. As far as chains go it's not bad and if you're into beer give this place a try. The food menu unfortunately hasn't changed much in the 4 years I've been in the neighborhood. They did introduce a weekend brunch which we tried but were unfortunately not inline with our expectations.
Susan T.,"Berkeley, CA",1,42,4,4.0,11/16/2016,"Had a bottle of wine and pizza here during the final World Series game. Really enjoyed it. Server was nice. BBQ chicken pizza spoke to my soul and the bottle price for wine was very fair. My single glass of Pinot noir however was overpriced and the same price as an appetizer. Stick to the whole bottle, it's a better deal. The restaurant is clean and so are the restrooms. I'll go back again for sure."
Subbu R.,"San Mateo, CA",0,8,2,1.0,4/14/2017,"Have eaten a few times at this place but today was the worst experience.. a vegetarian pizza was served with a piece of chicken. The replacement offered came back 20 min later with the wrong toppings and it was mediocre.. won't go again.. if you are looking for a vegetarian option, look elsewhere."
Danny O.,"Burlingame, CA",107,7,,2.0,11/7/2016,"I like bj's a lot. My regular is a California club pizza. But the San Mateo location is a joke. Only been there twice and both times the service is non existent. Both times there wasn't a host, and you have to interrupt servers to get seated. First time, I sat and ate there. It took an hour and a half to have appetizers brought to our table. They ended up giving us a discount that time. This time I ordered take out, and they told me 10-15 minutes. After sitting there for 45 minutes waiting for my food, I just decided to cancel the order and leave. Both times the restaurant wasn't even half way full. If you want the food, go to the san Bruno location. Your overall time will still be shorter including the extra 20 minute drive!"
K J.,"Sacramento, CA",5,18,,1.0,3/6/2017,"Went here late on a Saturday night after a long volleyball tournament. Had an older woman with me and 4 kids including a 2 yr old. We were tired and starving. Our food and drinks took for.ev.ver. There were no other families in the place. You would think they would have tried to be speedy since my kids were falling asleep at the table. Nope. There were plenty of servers dancing and joking with each other tho. Our food had definitely been sitting on the warmer too long. My soft taco shells were hard on the edges and there was a total of ONE CHIP and literally CRUMBS. Dirty wine glasses. It was horrible and cost me $100. I didn't even want to leave a tip. I want to like BJ'S but it's the same crap every time. I finally left before the pazooki came out because it was so ridiculously long of a wait and by this point we were practically the only people in the dining room. Garbage and inconsiderate. Also, my 7 year had it coming out of both ends as soon as we got back to our hotel room. He will never eat macaroni and cheese again. Thanks, BJ's!"
Nick S.,"San Mateo, CA",57,9,,1.0,11/2/2015,"Normally it's a good experience, the staff is attentive, the food is good, plentiful portions, clean restaurant. All that jazz.  This review is about my experience on one specific day, 10/31/15 at the host counter. We walked in around 1:15-1:30 and there was no one waiting to be seated so we walked up to the counter. There were two employees having a discussion about a customer that they just seated at their table. As we approached the counter, the male employee (wearing white contact lenses, it was Halloween) looked up at us out of the corner of his eye and continued his conversation for a few more sentences. Then greeted us with a simple ""Hi"" and nothing else. We asked for a table for two and he walked away from the counter, then looked back at us and said, ""Follow me, Ill find you your table.""  Does that mean we're going on a search for a table?  He then walked us to our table, set the menus down and said something to the effect of ""here you go"" (I don't remember the exact phrase/quote).  Our waiter was busy, but attentive and apologetic for being busy and took our orders pretty quickly and brought our drinks out almost immediately.  Our overall service was good, as expected.  I did notice the same host continually leaving the host counter unattended while people came in, and even saw one party leave after standing up there for a few minutes with no one to greet them. Meanwhile the host was over by one of the server stations chatting with one of the female servers who kept trying to end the conversation to get back to work, and she even asked if he was on his break, and he said he wasn't. The entire time he was at work, he had an extremely stern scowl on his face. I get it, we all have bad days, but you gotta leave it at the door when you're in a customer service/facing position."
