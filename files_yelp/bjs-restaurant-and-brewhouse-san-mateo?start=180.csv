Omar B.,"San Mateo, CA",2,6,1,2.0,3/28/2017,"The way they do over the phone orders isn't the most efficient.  After waiting and listening to the menu for what button to press, 1 for takeout, I ended up having to wait a few minutes for someone to even pick up.  Take the button pressing away and have the 2 or 3 people host or hostesses answer the phone and direct the call.  Every time I come in I always see at least 2 there just waiting.  The food is consistent, PRICEY but you know what you are going to get.  Its a decent place to go for happy hour, but paying for a meal for a family isn't the most cost efficient, subjective, but in general I think that is a fair statement. I'd eat there again, but its probably a once a month occasion."
Charlie B.,"San Mateo, CA",431,578,3192,4.0,10/4/2015,"The selection here is awesome, sometimes bordering on Cheesecake Factory! Happy hour is great with a pretty big selection of food to nosh on. Can be loud especially if there's a game on the tv but the place is upbeat and pretty lively!"
Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134,3.0,1/21/2015,"Friends and I hit up BJ's for a reunion of sorts and sat in the bar area. It was nice that there was seating available, though too bad that we weren't able to fit everyone (about a dozen people) in one space - we had to take up two separate areas so as to not be a fire hazard. Drinks were delicious - I really liked my Hefeweizen, and the appetizer big plate of nachos was tasty as well. However the bacon cheeseburger I ordered was a bit too salty for my taste. Had the obligatory pizookies afterward, which we all digged in to - also yummy. Overall, a pretty safe place to go where someone can always find something they like, though average tasting food but good brews."
Eduardo R.,"Millbrae, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/22/2017,I been to this place a few times and it has never gone wrong. We enjoyed our meals. Service was great.
Monique S.,"San Mateo, CA",3,67,18,5.0,8/15/2016,"I love this place, Christina and Lisa are great employee there and see so nice and understanding, highy recommend them. Food is awesome, people Are nice. I love it"
Archana B.,"Foster City, CA",17,12,,5.0,9/13/2016,Love the food here.... Thin pizza is amazing and my daughters favorite!! Have been here multiple times and never had bad experience. Staff is pleasant too.
Bob P.,"Dublin, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/25/2015,Came in for a Beer and appetizer. Sat down in the bar so did not have to wait to be seated big mistake....The service in the bar was really slow and in fact took over ten minutes just to get someone to serve  me a beer. Now 50 minutes later trying to flag down my waitress just to get the check. Really bad service...
Mona A.,"San Francisco, CA",290,62,36,3.0,7/21/2015,"Food is ok. Pros:     Brittany and Anahid are great servers!                Large menus to please everyone                Large wine and drink selections... Always a+              Lots of parking and open late Cons:  The hosts suck             Really big menu, so it's hard to chose and makes larger parties food take FOREVER Food is just ok nothing is OMG nom, but you get what you pay for"
Mirabelle T.,"Seattle, WA",20,5,,1.0,8/17/2015,"I would actually give this place 0 stars considering my first experience was pretty terrible. But I thought I should give it a second chance. But no, BJ's brewery & restaurant failed again! Long waits on a Monday evening, even when there were many open tables. So we took a table outside thinking it would be faster. That was ridiculous because when the host brought us to the table, it wasn't clean. He told us to wait. So we waited, & no one came to clean it. Then my sister went to ask the host again, and still no one came out. So finally, I went to the manager who clearly doesn't have managerial skills or communication skills in leading his team on how to effectively run the restaurant on a Monday night at 8:15pm!!!  Finally, we sat down, we waited to order. Then we waited again for the food. Finally at 9:40pm we got our food. We waited so long for mediocre food. Not to mention, the waitress forgot my husband's drink order & place setting for the children. She seemed like a nice person, but a little scattered.  I would like to say maybe this was an off night. But this is my second time at BJ's Brewery & Restaurant and it will be my last & I will not recommended it ever. PS..I normally don't like to complain about most things, unless it was outstandingly horrible! However, this is my SECOND time here & my experience & my family's experience was horrible again!"
Ahna B.,"Montara, CA",760,151,16,2.0,11/22/2015,"Very disappointed, why on a football Sunday would you only have one person running the floor and being a bartender all at the same time. This is the second time I have been to a BJ's and again the worse service ever. Food was average, but again the service. In San Bruno it was so bad I had to call your corporate office. How do you expect to stay in business with average food, service and spirits? I used to love BJ's. I went to BJ's the very first day it opened in Bridge Pointe many years ago. Makes me sad. Used to love to come there, but after another average experience I don't think I will ever go back. What will it take for this company to see your service has no sense of urgency or timing specifications?"
Marie M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,6,5.0,3/15/2016,"Angelina love you! Great waitress great bar service. That's why we keep coming back here. It's family and friends with great prices. Angelina every time. Smiles, jokes and getting what I ordered in a timely manner. Good job! Myla your awesome too. Came back to table 5 times to make sure we're happy. Another good waitress yes!"
Kat Z.,"Daly City, CA",15,36,21,1.0,12/19/2016,"This review is specifically for the service. The food is mediocre, at most. I came here last night with my bf to grab something simple. The first overlook that I should've heeded to was when we were seated without menus. Our server came 15 minutes later asking if he could get us anything and noticed that we had silverware, but no menus. He even addressed that and said why weren't you given menus when you were seated? You have silverware but no menus, that's weird. We proceeded to order shortly after. I inquired if I could do sweet potato fries instead of regular and our waiter said yes. For what seems to be 45 mins for two small orders, we finally receive our food from one of the staff coming from the kitchen. My bf notices that my order wasn't correct and told the person dropping off the food that this isn't what I ordered. The worker ignored our red flag and walked away scoffing ""Ooookkk"". At this point we were ready to leave. Our initial waiter comes back to check on us. When we tell him the fries are wrong he indicates that all he heard was fries and they don't serve sweet potato fries at BJs, and I quote ""Ooookkkkk"". If that was the case I would've ordered something different."
Trish L.,"San Mateo, CA",7,25,,5.0,2/18/2017,Awesome service from our server Zachary S! My boyfriend didn't have much time to eat due to his flight time and had requested a quick turnaround for the food. Zachary put in a request to get his meal fast - it came within 5 mins! He made sure if we needed anything and was very prompt and courteous throughout our time there. The lemon thyme chicken that I ordered was piping hot when it arrived and was a huge portion - two decent sized chicken pieces with plenty of rice and brussels sprouts. I could only eat half and had to take the rest home. Thank you for the excellent service. Please give this wonderful server and the cooks a raise - they deserve it!
Richard M.,"Hayward, CA",11,22,6,1.0,7/19/2015,"The hostess sat us down and the wait staff didn't even acknowledge us for the first 20 minutes. We have now been sitting here waiting for our food for about 45 minutes... The waitress hasn't even walked over to tell us the status of our order and it isn't even busy right now. At this point, I don't even care if our food is good. This place deserves ZERO stars based on the wait time and lack of customer service."
Tamara S.,"Burlingame, CA",245,303,225,4.0,9/21/2015,One of the better BJ's I've been too. The food honestly here tasted better than other locations. It can get crowded around lunch or when there's a football game. They have plenty of screens to watch sports on.  The service is friendly and quick. The restaurant is clean and so are the bathrooms. They have a decent beer selection and other drinks.  Their desserts are great! That hot cookie topped with ice cream is deadly!
Chantal H.,"San Francisco, CA",13,85,106,3.0,9/27/2015,Their food is average for the amount they make you pay. The service here was better then my previous experience at another location but still unsure why they do not have better quality. I do recommend the gluten free pepperoni and meatball pizza though!
Melissa C.,"Redwood City, CA",371,68,279,3.0,7/20/2014,"Came here for lunch on a Saturday morning around 11:30, so it was still pretty quiet. We were seated right away.  BJ's has a brunch menu on the weekends until 1pm, but I was more in the mood for lunch food, so I ask our server if we could order off the lunch menu (which is stated as m-f on the menu). He said it would be ok so I ordered the half sandwich and soup combo, which also came with French fries.  I had the turkey bacon ham, which is grilled with cheese, lettuce and tomato. The sandwich was a bit dry, but I did ask for mayo. There was a large helping of fries, and the Caesar salad was larger than I expected. All for $8.50!  Overall the food was decent, the helpings were generous, the service was good. The menu has dozens of options so I will definitely come again."
Samantha D.,"Boulder Creek, CA",280,75,256,3.0,7/6/2015,"I love the aesthetic of BJ's. This location has a great outdoor eating area and plenty of tables inside, as well as bar seating. There wasn't a wait time when I visited at peak dinner hour. This location is sub-par. Nothing really to write home about. Our server was friendly, but it took forever to get our food, our drinks, our silverware... well it just took some time so prepare to be patient. There aren't too many options to choose from for vegans but I got the brussels sprouts salad without cheese. I asked them to replace the cheese with avocado (assuming it would be an even exchange for avocado for goat cheese) and they charged me $2 for about a half an avocado. Wish I would have known that before I ordered.  The serving sizes are hearty so be prepared to eat."
Stacy A.,"San Mateo, CA",42,27,9,2.0,5/4/2017,"I'm not sure what happened to this place ?! I used to order curb side pickup all the time a few yrs back and it was great ,never had a issue . I would call when I got there and they would bring me out my food quick . But lately when I order curbside it's been a completely different story . My boyfriend and I ordered our food .called to pick up curbside and the phone range for 5mins ,no one picked up and when I finally got ahold of someone the girl was really ,really rude . She never relayed the message that we were waiting for our food .we sat at curbside for almost a hour before getting our food . Tried ordering again last week (curbside) and called to inform them we were waiting for food and phone was busy or off the hook for 15mins (heard from inside source they tend to do that if they don't want to bring food out and being lazy  ). I finally had to call the main number and then they brought out our food. What's the point of fast curbside pick up if your not going to answer and do your job to deliver food in a timely manner ?? Every time we have come to curbside all the kitchen staff decides to have a smoke break outside . One time I counted 6 of them outside smoking and then when manager comes out they run back inside .  I guess like a lot of other restaurants good customer service is hard to find ,kind of a shame bc I used to really like this place and gave them a lot of business and chances to redeem themselves"
Esther A.,"Burlingame, CA",1,41,2,2.0,8/11/2015,"This place sucks - No matter when you come in, there is always a wait. You wait to be seated, you wait to be greeted, you wait to have your order taken, you wait to have your food served, you wait for your bill.....you wait, wait, wait.  No one there really seems to like their job or realize that they are working for tips in addition to their hourly wage. You can complain, they don't care....free cookie? Food is just so-so but if you do take the plunge and go to this location - carve out at least 3 hours of your day."
