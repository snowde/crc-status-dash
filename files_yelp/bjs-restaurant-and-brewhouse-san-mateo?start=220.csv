Raquel H.,"Fremont, CA",9,6,5,2.0,4/10/2015,"BJs is always a hit or miss at this location.. After a long days work my mentality was just wanting to relax get some food and go home to sleep. Thinking this was going to be a quick dinner stop things turned for the wrong.  Sit down around 9:45PM greeted... Yes but wow it took 15 minutes to just get a drink order and some appetizers in. The drinks came very quickly but the food took over 45 minutes to receive and we had all our food at one time(ridiculous).  Our server was super friendly and because of him and a gentleman names Carlos which is why I didn't give one star. They apologized genuinely and said they will see what's going on. The manager did come over and apologize for the miscommunication but after reading all these reviews I see it wasn't a one time mistake.  I give them one last chance with ordering a Pazooki now by this time it's over an hour later since I first sat down. The gentleman who walked it over at 11:25 stood at the host desk talking to her than walked our way talked to one other guy who worked here. I'd rather not come here anymore this serious is not ok and Is just a joke, don't waste your time coming here."
Amanda R.,"Coarsegold, CA",41,2,,2.0,6/17/2017,"I first want to start by saying that I was really happy that I was staying next to a BJ's when I came to town on business. The first night I went we had a waiter that seemed that he had been through some things since it was visible, looking past that. It seemed he was not very attentive he would be gone for long periods of time, not refilling drinks etc. but when he was being attentive I felt like more of an inconvenience to him then a guest. He did separate our checks which I appreciated considering what happened the second time I went. It was a terrible an experience but we decided to try it again. This time we got another waiter, she was very nice at first. Refilled our waters, was attentive unlike the first one. As the night went on, my friend was still eating. The waitress proceeded to take the plate even though my friend told her she was not done. She then brought us our check and I kindly asked her to separate them, she then replied that she couldn't do that. We were a little surprised by this but we looked past it. So we intended to just give her all our payment methods, but it seemed like she still did not want to do that. That only one of us should pay the meal. She asked a question about the taxes, but we weren't sure since we are from out of town. As she just stood there glaring at us, because we were weren't sure what she wanted from us. I'm giving it two stars solely on the fact the food is so good. I'm very disappointed in the guest service at this location."
Marilyn D.,"Sparks, NV",407,247,87,2.0,2/22/2014,"Service has their highs and lows. Mostly lows, but I did have one waitress who was pleasant and bubbly and fun. The rest act like they are on a work release program from grumpy prison.  The food is also hit or miss. Some dishes are good - while others are pasty and flavorless.  I was there during the Winter Olympics and nearly all the screens were on an obscure soccer game. When we asked to have the channel changed to the Olympics,  we were told the staff wanted to watch the soccer. I actually don't care what the staff wants to watch.  Good meeting place - but average experience."
John H.,"San Francisco, CA",115,156,255,3.0,2/14/2016,I've been to many BJ'S including the San Jose and fremont locations but thus place was underwhelming for a prime location. Slow service and our food was cold. Wouldn't recommend it anyone on the peninsula looking for a bigger chain pub
Claire W.,"San Rafael, CA",940,436,2520,3.0,3/14/2012,"Went there for a work luncheon today and tried: Gourmet Mac & Cheese on the snacks and small bites menu - maybe Mac & Cheese is just not my thing; I was not very impressed with it as the pasta did not taste cheesy at all; rather, it was sort of oily, even though the menu says three cheeses. I guess I was expecting the melt, stringy cheese, not the oily kind. I did taste the garlic but not chipotle as stated on the menu. The bacon bites were a good touch but the pasta did not have the crispy crust on the top as stated on the menu ""oven baked to crispy"". I think maybe the execution or ingredients were a little off? One of my coworkers had the caesar salad with grilled chicken. He orders this dish all the time. I can see why. The portion of the greens (not just ramaine lettus) is huge and there is generous portion of grilled chicken. Looks like a very simple yet satisfying dish. Hawaiian Mahi Mahi - fish portion is good (not huge), but flavor was lacking and very bland and a little on the dry side. The pineapple fried rice was also not impressive; a little oily and the rice was a bit hard. I prefer the rice to be soft and starchy instead of not cooked all the way through like this. Even though the menus says that it is under 600 calories I will not order this dish again! I just don't think healthier or lighter dishes need to taste so bland! Well, I think I shall always stick to what I think they do better, such as burgers & pizzas and the like when I dine here..."
Meg G.,"San Mateo, CA",41,48,10,3.0,7/9/2015,"Not too shabby for a chain restaurant. They always seem to be understaffed though. The person who takes your order and brings your drinks and bill isn't the person to deliver your food. This usually isn't a problem, except it's highly likely that you'll get interrupted a few times by a delivery server trying to give you an appetizer or meal you didn't originally order. Breaks up the flow of the conversation at the table. Something else to note: I've been her a few times and the floor in the bar area is usually wet. My guests have slipped and fallen! C'mon BJ's...wipe up the floor please!"
Shontai C.,"San Jose, CA",2,122,15,1.0,5/19/2017,"Came here today with coworkers.  We arrived at 1135am.  We were seated down immediately.  One of coworkers was still at office so he texted us his order.  That co worker arrived before the server took our order.  I asked for the superfood salad.  Manuel, our server,  said no such thing as a superfood salad.  I had to point to the menu that list the superfood salad. Then he said its called a super salad.  Okay I guess I cannot read cuz I saw SUPERFOOD.  I guess the word FOOD is silence.  That was the last we saw our server cuz 1230 came around and still no food.  So I had to get manager.  Finally the food came.  Immediately our server apologize for the wait and said the kitchen was backed up.  the food looked horrible.  My salad was upside down.  No kidding.  The veggies were at the bottom and the leaves were on the top. No worries I am going to toss the salad.  Wait where are the veggies that comes with the salad?  R u effin kidding me . 11.00 for leaves.  I told the manager no effin way am I paying for this salad and I cannot wait another hour for them to remake. The manager said there was no wait in the kitchen. Hmmm  well Manuel told us there was a long wait.  Btw two tables next to us didn't get their food and they were seated at same time .  And the menus were dirty and  sticky.  Yuck."
Real C.,"Chicago, IL",0,19,4,2.0,11/15/2016,"I really want to like this place, but every time there is a problem when we eat there. Service is inconsistent and sometimes you have to beg for a waiter. Food isn't cooked to order - which is a problem. They have a good beer list (1 star) and it is kid friendly (1 star)."
Emi N.,"San Carlos, CA",307,233,1840,2.0,12/24/2013,"2.5 Stars How is it possible that I haven't written a review for BJ's before??? My office is nearby so I've been a lunch regular for the last 7 years or so.  I also dine-in for dinner from time to time.  What I've noticed over the years is that the service at lunch, even if you get there early (11:30am), is SO SLOW!  I know restaurants can be busy during the lunch hour which I am very understanding of, but the last couple of times were just ridiculous to the point I wanted to walk out before I even got my food.  That being said, I pretty much veto going there anytime someone suggests it for lunch now.  Dinner is not as bad and in my experience has been consistent.  The food is tasty and a Pizookie is a must!"
Jack T.,"Hayward, CA",1,84,1,2.0,11/1/2016,"First let me say that the food wasn't bad, it was more the service and frosty temperature inside the restaurant, and the prices of the food that you get that were the problems.  Service sucked even though they weren't busy, waiter never asked if I wanted my soda refilled or offer plates for the expensive calamari appetizer I ordered.  It was also very cold in the place, maybe even warmer outside with the winter rainy weather we've been having.  Not a crappy place but just nothing to ever bring me back, just mediocre food at high prices."
Luke S.,"San Mateo, CA",477,1211,,3.0,4/24/2014,"This place is great for big parties, I've had a few there myself.                   They are very accomadating and the service is great.                  THe beer is good of course because they make there own.              You usually get a pretty decent portion with pizza I must say tho the pork chops were a pretty small portion especially for the price.  It was very good obviously because it all came off the bone with one slice, it was very moist and juicy but it was more the size of a side dish.   There famous pazookie is always good, thats a plus. Great location and they get very busy but still maintain a good amount of quietness.  The avocado rolls are really good. It was better than I'd had expected I guess."
Cathy N.,"Menlo Park, CA",506,242,984,2.0,12/4/2013,"As fancy and I hear a great spot to knock back a few beers during sport seasons, I am not a BJ's Restaurant biggest fan. I never had bad experiences, but just nothing memorable that would make me return neither, and this BJ holds the same ground. Me and the Boyfriend was looking into trying something new. We never explored San Mateo (or more like, never gave it a chance), so he decided BJ's would be a great start for food exploration. LOCATION: The restaurant is fairly easy to locate (it may be easy if I followed my GPS, but the Boyfriend fancied himself a good navigator; we took a few extra turns and blocks to get here). If you've been to a BJ before then you know this restaurant looks as if they have a ginormous ceiling from the outside. You can't miss it. It's well lit with LED lighting and a easy on the eyes but attractive yellows and oranges painted on the exterior. A color that says ""we're fun, come in!"" PARKING: Definitely not an issue, and it shouldn't be (accept for Oakridge area). We came here on a Tuesday early evening, so there was plenty of parking spots. ENTRY: We were greeted by two(2) young ladies at the front (how unfortunate, they didn't smile - tsk tsk tsk). Once we told them ""party for two(2)"", they had a young gentlemen seat us. INTERIOR: There is certainly a lot going on for the interior. From colors, to light fixtures, to photos to artworks. It makes waiting for your food not so long (unfortunately for both parties that was sitting on both sides of us -they had not so happy experience -one waited over an hour for their food and the other didn't touch their food). SERVICE: The experience upon our entry can definitely improve with more eye contact and smile -definitely would help (someone re-train these kids the basics of customer service). Our waiter was pleasant and professional. He was probably the best customer service we've had the entire time there (sorry, I don't remember your name and I don't have the receipt that might have your name on it). Our food came out on a pretty decent time. FOOD: We ordered several snacks and appetizers to have a bit of variety. Incredibly disappointed. Out of all the selection of the Appetizer Combo, the only thing that had flavor was the spinach and artichoke dip. The rest was surprisingly bland (how can mozzarella sticks be bland?). The California club, Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms, Grilled Chicken club was bland. I guess this restaurant is more of a sports bar than a restaurant (get drunk and you wouldn't care what the food tastes like) at least the food presentation was pretty. VERDICT: Dare I say it, I don't think I will be dining at any BJ's anytime soon."
John C.,"Burlingame, CA",115,68,,2.0,4/26/2016,What happened to your menu.  The food was not good.  I don't go there for the beer.  I really don't know why the place is busy.  I'm just telling the truth.  $180+ for 5 people with a couple  drinks each total was $215 with tip.  Not worth it
Holly S.,"Pacifica, CA",0,4,,4.0,11/21/2016,My 95 year old mom and I often have lunch here.  Today we had the best server ever.  His name was Ramon and he was so kind to both my mom and I.  Just want the powers that be to know how much he is appreciated.  We can always know that the food will be good but today we found out that there is an excellent server on staff.  Thanks Ramon and thanks BJ's.
Jenna T.,"East Bay, CA",419,620,1266,4.0,4/5/2014,"The location is in the Bridgepoint shopping plaza, which makes it a prime spot. The decor and their added patio area adds a nice touch to the restaurant. There is plenty of parking. The shops are quite walkable distance if you like to get your miles in.  They added a brunch selection to their menu. My mom was excited about it so she ordered the California Scramble. The eggs lacked flavor and the bread was not dressed with butter nor did the dish come with jelly! How outrageous right? BJs isn't a restaurant known for any breakfast food, but if they want to branch out to that area then they need to do a better job.  I ordered the lunch special - half grilled chicken club sandwich and a side salad. My dish was delicious. For dessert, we ordered a mini salted caramel mini pizookie. It was surprisingly good."
Aaron C.,"Belmont, CA",400,203,204,3.0,3/31/2014,"Appetizers: shrimp lettuce wraps aren't bad Entrees: French Dip or Turkey Burger Dessert: Pizookie, no surprise there Drink: I'm all about the PM Porter, unless the Pumpkin Ale is being served (seasonal)"
VB L.,"San Mateo, CA",971,720,826,5.0,8/17/2013,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The food is terrific, the service spectacular and they have half price wine (both bottles and glasses) every Tuesday!  What's not to love?"
Hello M.,"San Bruno, CA",103,123,12,4.0,3/24/2016,This BJ's is one of the more SOLID locations along with San Bruno. Food is consistently on par. The service here is one of the best of any BJ's and is not quite as busy as San Bruno so food tends to come out a bit quicker.
Rosquete B.,"Belmont, CA",17,950,366,3.0,5/13/2014,"3*BJ Beer pub Great lunch specials The chicken tacos are delicious, but the beans are killer Nice flat bread entrees Kick back atmosphere Crowded So-so food service"
Harvey B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,2,,1.0,5/14/2016,Horrible service with average food  spend your hard earned money at another  restaurant.
