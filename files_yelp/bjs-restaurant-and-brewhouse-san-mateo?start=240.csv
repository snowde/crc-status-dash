Veronica T.,"Redwood City, CA",2,24,,1.0,6/19/2015,"This bjs is lame. The food has gone downhill, when I went on a Thursday night. They werent even busy and for the prices the food is pretty medicore. (Get better shit at mickey D's). I had a sip of my friends drink and I got hassled by some bar worker (who is clearly on a power hype) telling me I would have to leave if I did it again. Like please, im 20. Crusify me for taking a sip. People do that shit all the time and hes seriously going to make a scene about it. Laughable. As for the drink I tasted (something tequlia pomegranate) it was disgusting. Dirty tasting tequila and syrup combination made it taste like spiked cough medicine. Dont go here."
Nikhil S.,"San Francisco, CA",493,125,89,4.0,11/16/2014,"Big fan of BJ's. My 21st birthday was at a BJ's many years ago and I normally like their food, beers, and of course the pizookie.  That said though, this BJ's location is ALWAYS crowded. This always surprises me too because there are lots of other good restaurants in Foster City and San Mateo. But hey, don't be discouraged. You can skip the line if you sit in the bar area (and let's be honest, you're gonna get the beer here anyways) and can find an open seat.  The food here is just like any other BJ's. The menu is long with lots of appetizers and beer choices. I normally get the chicken pesto flatbread, but for some reason they didn't have it last time I went so I had a very greasy pepperoni flatbread. The appetizer sampler was the real deal though; it included mozzarella sticks, egg rolls, spring rolls, and spinach artichoke dip with chips. Yumlicious."
Paisely S.,"San Mateo, CA",28,27,,3.0,9/24/2015,"pizza pretty good, but they did forget one of the toppings I had ordered. Prices are reasonable."
Amanda G.,"Menlo Park, CA",834,1412,,2.0,6/11/2013,"Unfortunately, I've had to come here a few times, because family members picked it. Service is always bad, from start to finish. A reservation was made, (we had a group of 8) and we had to wait keep asking if the table was ready, each time we were told they were setting it up, and it would be ready in a few. BS,  it was almost half an hour past the res time when we were seated. Our server was pleasant, but, that's the only positive thing i can say about him. Drink orders were given, and after a VERY long time he brought them out-half of them. He forgot what everyone else had ordered, and then incorrect beverages were brought out anyway. MY FIL wanted to say something, but was unable to get the anyone's attention. The food order took a very, very long time as well. We saw some people we knew who were seated at the exact same time as us, had apps and entrees and were out in under an hour. It took us over two hours from the time we (FINALLY) got seated to the time the check was paid. My bison burger and my husband's burger came out super well done, when we both requested medium. We sent them back, mine came back cooked correctly, and in a reasonable amount of time.  I don't know what the deal was with my husband's, but his took way too long. The worst part? When he finally got it, it was still overcooked. Obviously, at this point he just ate it. He also tasted the GIL's spaghetti and meatballs, and said mine was much better, (and my version is even a healthy version!) When we got the bill, they did comp both our meals. I appreciated that, especially since we ended up eating ours after everyone else was almost done. I am continually amazed that people choose to eat here, and obviously a lot of people do, since they're often busy. There's a million great locally owned places nearby, why do people keep coming here? It's a great mystery to me.... I've been to a few different locations, and the bad/lack of service and bad/subpar food has occurred at all of them."
Barry R.,"Foster City, CA",1,23,47,1.0,11/3/2014,"Bad food, bad service, bad attitude .... What Happened to them? We use to go to BJ's all the time.  Last weekend we went for a brunch / lunch and it was an overall bad experience.  The eggs were undercooked and sent back twice.  The french fries were warm / cold,  My potatoes were dry inside and two of our guests complained about the coffee. Plus the food took 30 minutes to arrive and it took a while to find the waiter to even get service.  The manager did come by later and picked up the cost of the eggs and 2 coffees.  I'm so disappointed with this visit.  It will be a bit of time before we go back and try again :("
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,2/15/2014,"Our party of 12 we were accommodated well on 2-8-14. We called hours ahead to make reservations on the wait list. Arrived about 6:30 PM and waited to be seated about 35-40 Minutes. The hostess was great as we had added a few more to our party, they got us a perfect area and they were able to seat us all. Waitress was attentive. Food was good and all around experience was good. Menu is always great with many options for ALL. Love Bjs and the experience. We try to google & find this Restaurant when traveling as we always know it will be a good."
Kari G.,"San Mateo, CA",236,754,221,4.0,1/1/2014,"I enjoy going to BJ's. Who can argue with their delicious chocolate chip pizookie? For those who aren't familiar with it, its a hot chocolate chip cookie baked in a skillet and topped with ice cream. I've tried a lot of different entrees here that were okay but nothing that really made me love BJ's until I tried their sweet pig pizza. It is a delicious deep dish covered in ham and pineapple. Its hands down my favorite pizza! This location recently added a great outdoor patio with warmers and a fire pit. Its the perfect place to spend a summer evening."
Jessica G.,"Sacramento, CA",264,44,6,1.0,4/29/2015,"When I crave a pizookie, I always think of BJ's, but I haven't been back since they really messed up the last time I was there. I went with 3 other people, and we ordered lots of drinks & appetizers. None of the alcoholic beverages from the bar tasted good, and a margarita at our tasted like it had no alcohol in it. Then, when we got our entrees, they also sucked. Finally, we were so excited for our pizookies, when low & behold our pizookie is burnt!!! We got the chocolate chip one, and they poured hot fudge on it (we didn't request that, and it doesn't normally come with it). It was almost like they were trying to cover up the fact that they overcooked it-- it literally tasted like a charred cookie covered in fudge-- blechhh When we told the waitress about how horrible our experience was, she apologized, but gave us some attitude along with the apology.. so that wasn't so sincere. Not sure to return, or make homemade pizookies from now on."
Lauren K.,"San Francisco, CA",390,553,2093,4.0,6/23/2011,"Recently stopped by for our Father's Day Dinner. I called in about 20 minutes earlier and when we got there, we were seated immediately. Waiter was super awesome and chill. Our orders were easy. Water and ahi tuna salad all around. The Ahi Tuna Salad was super refreshing. It's a little over 600 calories for the entire plate and was surprised with how much ahi tuna was actually on my plate. I'd say it was about a dozen well seasoned slices. There was enough dressing for the entire salad and had a pleasant taste. I was hungry a few hours after I got home but probably because we ate an early dinner here (4:45pm).  We left with a Father's Day Beer Cup that said BJ's Father's Day 2011. I think our family will make it a tradition to come here every Father's Day just to collect the cups. hehehe"
Stewart B.,"Castro Valley, CA",12,256,137,4.0,7/8/2013,"We have come here a few times and we enjoy the food and beer.  I am a big fan of Big Poppa Smokers and heard recently that BJ's was using some of BPS recipes for there Blue Ribbon BBQ.  Big Poppa won the Royal Oak last year, so good BBQ was to be expected. We decided to try the Blue Ribbon BBQ combo plate for 2. The Baby Back Ribs and 1/2 chicken with the SWEET MONEY CHAMPIONSHIP rub were awesome.  The ribs were a bit dry, but the chicken was super moist and flavorful.  That rub really is Money.  Had anohter helping of the  Fries with Jallelujah Seasoned Jalapeno Salt, WOW!  The cole slaw also looked like it was hand chopped.  Nice touch. We will be back!"
Shannon L.,"San Francisco, CA",135,381,29,3.0,1/31/2015,"I've been to this BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse a bunch of times because I work nearby. We usually arrive early (around 11:35) in order to beat some of the lunch crowd. The best things about BJ's is they have a huge menu and lots of TV's for watching sports. The food is just okay and the service has usually been slow. For me, the only food item that kind of stands out is the Pizookie....but it's not perfect...it's usually too thin. It doesn't even come close to filling up the cookie pan like in the pictures on the menu. Overall grade: C+"
Jennifer F.,"San Francisco, CA",148,44,18,1.0,1/29/2013,"BEWARE OF THE RAW CHICKEN (Pic posted) Wow BJ's, I cannot believe how bad the customer service is here. I am your number 1 fan when it comes to pizza, but you just had to do me dirty tonight.  I'm here for a company dinner of 8  and we start by ordering drinks. Drinks come back and there's lipstick still on my manager's wine glass. No biggie, she requests for a new glass. The waitress comes back with a new wine glass - EQUALLY FILTHY. The waitress had a stankface x974382 by the time she came back with the 3rd glass. I had a sinking feeling that a big ol' noogie or other unmentionable bodily fluids was going to land in one of our orders.  Then come the orders. BJ's is known to take a day and some change to get your food over so this was expected. What I didn't expect was the order of RAW Boneless Chicken Wings heading our way.  My manager cut into the wing and it was as pink as the pink slime from McDonalds. How about I just throw up in my mouth now?  Called the manager over and he seemed less than apologetic about the incident. Great customer service BJ's - said no one ever.  Silver lining to such a hot mess: Skinny mojito? Eh.. Still deserved a 0."
Henry L.,"Belmont, CA",279,741,347,3.0,12/9/2013,"BJ's is a pretty big franchise now. So have to compare this one against the other franchises that I've been in... this is right in the middle. What they really lack is one central screen. The main screen behind the bar is split in 4. When I was here for a big game, they played the game on 80% of the TVs in the joint. But it would have been actually better to see one big screen and the other games on the smaller screens.  As far as food and service goes, it's on par with the other BJ's. So I guess this makes this place a 3 star location if you know BJ's. But if you've never been to BJ's before, I actually do like this franchise. They have a decent selection of beers (I like the Jeremiah Red) in addition they have more visiting beers on tap too. There's also a good happy hour that runs during all the NFL games."
John S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,1,3.0,3/29/2016,"Food was good...nice and hot. Service ok Waiter was cocky and when our appetizer came after the entrees were served,  he said ..""oh well, that's the it goes sometimes""...Really? He could of asked us if we still wanted it, or refire after , or anything other than blaming the kitchen ."
Sonya P.,"Redwood City, CA",52,32,2,1.0,10/17/2014,I hate to be giving BJs one star because I love their pizza and beers but after having 2 bad experiences I have to divorce this place. It's never a good sign when you have to ask a server if there is a problem or when your servers switch and never get checked up on to get that extra buffalo sauce you ordered oh and a water refill.  I'll be back once the staff is a little more friendly and attentive. Maybe...
Beverly T.,"San Mateo, CA",594,388,334,3.0,7/16/2014,"Sometimes you just want a BJ...........'s pizza. Great white: I love this pizza. It's not great, it's thick doughy, ingredients aren't high quality but it just hits the spot. Alfredo sauce (lacking depth or parmesan flavor), garlic, mushrooms, tomatoes (taste like canned) topped with parmesan and chicken.  Side note: Our waitress was really fun and sweet even though it was PACKKKED and she was scrambling to clean tables, take orders, etc. Plus stars for her awesome service!"
Susan C.,"Vallejo, CA",718,587,1322,3.0,12/27/2010,"Sunday football was processed at BJ's. The first BJ's I have ever been to was in LA, all we did was go to consume a pizza sized hot cookie with a mountain of ice cream. This time I attended with a much more healthy state of mind, having a garden salad with cajun shrimp.  The salad was healthy, the shrimp were deliciously buttery.   The nachos were something to behold.  Tri colored chips, ample cheese, sour cream, BJ's beer infused chili, and the kitchen sink. The bar was pretty crowded with sports fans but overall, I felt the energy to simply be that of a chain restaurant.  I have to say, the split projector screen over the bar was pretty neat though."
M T.,"Foster City, CA",0,21,1,5.0,3/20/2016,"I've been here a few times and every time the food has been excellent. I've only ordered beer here once though and they didn't have the IPA I asked for, so I tried the house IPA, it was terrible. I'm not knocking a star off for that though, most house IPA's are terrible."
Juliana F.,"Redwood City, CA",22,146,70,5.0,1/22/2016,"Came here on a Thursday night around 11PM. Our server KYLE was absolutely amazing. He is everything I admire in a server. He was outgoing, attentive and very informative. Definitely the best server I have ever seen. I had the EnLIGHTened Turkey Burger. It was mouthwatering. And the Avocado Egg Rolls were sooo good:) Everything about our experience was delightful, very quick service and excellent food! I will be visiting this location as often as possible!"
