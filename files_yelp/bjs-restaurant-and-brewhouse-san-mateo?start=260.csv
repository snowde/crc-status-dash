Luna S.,"San Carlos, CA",2,143,29,5.0,9/16/2015,"Had a plate of ribs, clam chowder, and potato wedges. Everything was absolutely heavenly. Thank you BJ's!"
Prasad D.,"East Bay, CA",13,279,47,3.0,12/22/2015,"All BJs are good for group parties.  I like many dishes and drinks. Pretty crowded during game days. If in group, I will recommend table reservation."
Jessica L.,"San Mateo, CA",7,4,,1.0,6/13/2014,"My boyfriend and I visited BJ's for dessert.  We asked to sit outside near the fire but the gentleman at the counter said he had no server out there.  Oh well..  We were seated quickly inside but the waiter did not even bother to introduce himself.  We ordered paninis (which are amazing here) and a glass of milk which according to the menu, comes with free refills.   Long story short, it took 20 minutes to get our paninis. Ridiculous.  It wasn't even that busy of  a night.   After that, our waiter didn't check in with us at all.  I asked another server for a refill on the milk.. to which she replied ""theres no refills"" and walked away.  I asked a second server who told me the same thing.  I told him to check the menu.  He saw that the menu states that milk comes with free refills and he went and got another one for me.  The fact that the servers don't know their own menu is awful.  Our server later dropped the bill on the table without saying thank you or asking how it went.   We will not be coming back."
Myra O.,"San Francisco, CA",364,30,63,4.0,6/9/2014,"4s b/c Love that we got to watch our SF WorldChamps GIANTS and other sports on big screens. *More Space than San Bruno, Ca. and Parking area. *Great for ALL groups of life. *Great HOT weather location, 682014! *I am not fond of Beer, and so I like their Wildberry Mojito wasn't to bad which I shared with my Sis-n-law...lol *Good Teamwork. *Good Food Selections: sampler appetitizers, etc. Ena our main server: very professional, very helpful with the food selection's(especially, not on menu), great customer service, friendly, patient, and efficient. Only Negative didn't like is why we only have 2-hrs limit when we have big family???"
Ben S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,15,,1.0,9/8/2015,"Bottom line - this place needs to either get new management that will train the staff on how to handle service or the current management team needs to get their act together.  We have a long running joke - the service is guaranteed to screw something up so we literally wait until a major mistake happens, I think it's been 12 times straight now over the last several years, I really don't know why I keep coming back except for convenience.  Yesterday was awful, they gave us 2 very dirty spoons w/our dessert (after we were practically ignored for long periods of time sitting in the bar area - took ~10 mins just to get water and menus). My wife got grossed out and didn't want any of the dessert (spoons had touched before we noticed) - we barely got a sorry and they still charged us for the dessert."
Lauryn R.,"San Mateo, CA",2,34,40,4.0,7/24/2015,"BJ's is a great restaurant mostly due to their extensive menu! I've been eating here for plenty of years and I don't think that I've ever had a bad meal here. As for the service, that could definitely improve, but what can you really do? Excellent salads, burgers, sandwiches and appetizers!! My favorite is the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad! BJ's is always a great option for eating out!"
A B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,42,,3.0,1/31/2016,"Tried the jumbo meatballs with spaghetti plate.  Lots of meatballs, but were mushy (more like a meat paste).  The sauce was bland.  Service, as always, was excellent, however."
Kelly S.,"New York, NY",25,20,3,4.0,1/17/2016,"I just love it here. It's an easy place to be. The staff are all friendly and competent. The menu has a nice selection of everything food and drink and dessert-wise. What more could you want?  Oh yes, they have a lettuce wrap option for your burger which means you can skip the bread and still get fires. Yay!"
Kim B.,"San Mateo, CA",5,15,,1.0,7/31/2016,"Curbside pick up failures  - yes multiple chances given  Summary: I've done ~5 curbside pick ups at this location now and 3 were a complete failure. Others were late and sort of okay.  My most recent experience trumps all the rest.  -an 11:00am pick up apparently isn't a ""real"" option so they should completely remove it from the site and app.  - when I called to check on my order they were working on it and said closer to 1120am -at 11:20am called again but they couldn't find my order now neither under my name or order information confirmation (I ordered though app). They insisted I didn't order with them so I checked my credit card app and could already see the pending charge.  - 11:45 after my 5th call to pick up (they can't put you on hold and ask you to call back as they look into it), they finally tell me ""oh your order has been ready and it's here. Come inside and get it!"" I ordered using curbside pick up and I had to argue with them for full minute to bring out my prepaid order.  -another 10 minutes pass and they bring out a partial order which is now cold. Melted cheese is now hard. WTF - After 12pm, called again, they're still cooking my order and it's not actually all ready can I come inside to pick up the last dish? WTF again, NOOOO, I have my infant sitting in the back, I'm big and pregnant with horrible back pain and the only reason I went to BJs is for the curbside pick.  What was worst is the guy who came out each time was making mean faces at me and is ruder than usual. (I would guess these folks don't like their job. I used to tip them some cash because I know it's hard work but nothing this time.) Anyways very frustrated and will never use their curbside pick up again. I asked for a manager to complain about waiting outside for over an hour and the line magically got disconnected, ha! Others curbside orders weren't smooth either but I always gave them the benefit of the doubt. They're late ~10 mins. and delivery guys seem pretty unhappy. :( At least orders were fine and food was good before."
Q Q.,"Honolulu, HI",0,236,,2.0,7/29/2016,"Food was a 4 stars.  Really tasty.  Service(Mario) was about a 5.  He was super awesome and checked on us and refilled without any words from us.  Awesome!!!!!!!!!  But the food took forever.  I mean more than forever.  Not sure why, but that's the reason for the low stars.  Sorry."
Miranda W.,"Pacifica, CA",160,27,,1.0,11/26/2015,"My friend and I decided to go to BJ's to get pizookies. We walked in and were seated right away (that's what the one star is for). Looked at the menu for basically 2 seconds and figured out what we wanted. 5 minutes pass and still nobody has even offered to bring us water. 10 minutes pass and after making eye contact with several employees and not one stopped by our table, my friend and I left. Other tables around us were being served and they showed up after us. I love this restaurant, but if I have to beg to get served then I'm not even going to waste my time."
Chad W.,"Mission Viejo, CA",32,12,8,4.0,1/15/2015,"When I travel I enjoy coming to BJ's to get some decent food and beer.  Menu is basic, but most food I have tried is decent.   Some BJ's have great guest beer on tap, this place not so much, since most their own beer is not good. Service was slow, but not due to the bartender (I ate at the bar).  They seemed understaffed for the amount of people. For dessert you MUST get a Pazookie!!"
Cassidy C.,"San Mateo, CA",17,44,,1.0,6/19/2016,"BJs gets one star for two redeeming points 1- our waiter Jesse was awesome 2- they serve beer.... Other than that- avoid like the plague. We waited for over thirty minutes for our table and over thirty minutes for our food. My food was cold, the order was wrong and they served me the heel of the bread for toast. My food was so bad, I was actually forced to eat the heel of the bread toast. We sat on the patio and they had two working umbrellas for the whole patio!!! Thankfully we had one of the umbrellas- but if we hadn't we would have fried. It was just an awful experience. Not worth your time, money or effort. Go anywhere else... And maybe see if you can get Jessie a job where his skills might be put to good use."
Brittany C.,"Castro Valley, CA",59,27,16,5.0,1/25/2016,Love coming to this Bjs. Our appetizers and meals were delicious. Honey sriracha Brussel sprouts are so good. Bbq ribs. My guest had the jambalaya which he loves because it's got a decent amount of spice. This time I got the Parmesan crusted chicken which always turns out just perf. Our server Gustavo H. was so great!
Judi D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,12,,1.0,3/29/2016,"This email is to let you know why I will never eat at BJ's again unless I absolutely have to.  For my birthday celebration I had a large party of 11 and we were told the wait would be 1 to 11/2 hours.  This wait was so long that 2 people ate in the bar and 2 people left.  I told the front desk that we were down to 7 people.  He told me okay, we'll seat you in a few minutes (holding to the 1 hour wait even though 4 people left).  When we were seated at 1 hour and 5 minutes, we were seated in an area that had open seats the whole time.  No amount of Pizukies will rectify your horrible service.  I am also posting this exact rant on Yelp! to alert other patrons what they will be in for if they visit your establishment.  This is not the first time I've suffered through long waits to be seated, served."
Emmalouise B.,"East Bay, CA",1380,1278,12479,3.0,8/3/2012,"Having lived within walking distance of this restaurant for well over a year now I was surprised I hadn't been here sooner but after now having been I don't think I was missing anything. One thing I just can't get over is how no matter what time or day you come here it's always busy. I pass by numerous times each week and every time the car park is full with people waiting outside for their table. I feel like I'm missing something, do they have a secret topless service hidden out the back somewhere or something? Because it sure can't be for the speedy service or food. It's the kind of place I imagine you would come if you can't decide where else to eat.  The food here really is just mediocre, borderline ''ok''. A lot of which is almost certainly cooked from frozen and overpriced for the quality you get. I think the highlight of their menu is the very well known Pizookie which although nice isn't amazing either.  My husband and I came here with a coupon for one of the free Pizooki for his Birthday and as they had ran out of every flavor except for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut ( ) that was the one we ended up with. The Ice Cream was nice but the middle of the Cookie (as others have also mentioned) was under cooked. But hey.. It's free so I can't really complain. One thing I will say is that the Cocktail selection is fairly decent and not too badly priced so coming here I would recommend taking a seat in the bar and having a few drinks with maybe a Dessert but as for a nice meal, go elsewhere. * TIP: Call ahead to reduce the wait time. * ** Birthday Tip ** Join their email club and receive a coupon for a free Pizookie for your Birthday. The coupon is valid for a week or so."
Crystal B.,"Palomar Park, CA",0,10,,3.0,7/13/2016,Our waiter Mario was rude as shit. Food was great.
Derek L.,"Honolulu, HI",21,44,46,2.0,7/9/2015,"I stopped by here for dinner last week, and I couldn't decide weather to make my experience 1 or 2 stars.  I have been going to various BJ's restaurants throughout California for a long time.  Their pizza is fantastic, and the drink's are good.  The one thing that tipped me over at this restaurant was the cleanliness of the restroom.  It was filthy! without going into detail, I walked out of the bathroom hoping they would have it cleaned before I left.  I told the waiter, and of course it was not clean prior to us leaving.  The thing that kept me at the 2 stars level was our waiter was extremely friendly, and he even changed the television right by our table so we could watch the soccer game.  But if you're wanting a great BJ's experience, go to another one since I had such a bad experience with the restrooms here."
Positron X.,"San Mateo, CA",0,32,1,4.0,12/31/2014,"You can always count on their pizookies for some sinful indulgence. I also like their beer selection, their bacon and corn fritters, and their crispy thin fries.  Btw, the brunch here is pretty cheap for the amount of food you get. Their French Toast combo is one of the better ones around."
Michael S.,"San Mateo, CA",2,68,35,2.0,8/3/2014,Food was great but service wasn't . Had to pick up my own napkins and my own utensils. We has to ask twice for the bill. The managment need to hire more severs .
