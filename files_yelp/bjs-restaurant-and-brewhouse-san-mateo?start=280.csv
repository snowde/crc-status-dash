Ryan B.,"Mountain View, CA",1,33,4,1.0,11/18/2015,"Let me start off with saying I like BJs Brewhouse. Been to many.  This place?  The worst BJs in California. This place provides, without a doubt, the worst Take Out experience. In addition,  dine-in Customer experience is subpar.  And the bartenders serve old bad wine and don't know anything other than pouring a beer. When ordering take-out onsite, dont be surprised if they take an extra 30 mins beyond what they communicate.  Don't be surprised if their staff tells you to use their mobile App to pay for take-out, so they can force you to pay a tip, without even knowing. Dont be surprised if they refuse to provide a refund afterwards.  Don't be surprised if they are extremely slow and unprofessional. Don't be surprised if you receive someone else's order.  For dining in, don't be surprised if you receive the wrong order. Disgusting unserviced restrooms as well.  Don't be surprised if half their staff (on a busy evening) is out front, socializing, smoking cigarettes and cursing up a storm while kids walk by. If I was the owner of this establishment, I would do some serious firing and work to set higher standards.  I will never take my friends or family to this BJs ever again --- likely others as well since it repeatedly has provided such bad experiences."
Cathy M.,"San Mateo, CA",6,5,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Deplorable customer service!  I came in to watch the second half of the Patriots-Steelers playoff game.  The bar was completely full so I waited to be asked to be seated at a small table in the restaurant.  This was at 5:30pm on a Sunday, and there were many, MANY empty tables available.  After a couple of minutes, when the male and female ""hosts"" had finished giggling and flirting with one another, the male finally walked over to me.  I told him that the bar was full, and I wanted to be seated at a table, pointing to a nearby empty table for two.  What's your name?, he asks.  I told him my name.  He then asks if I've made a reservation, and I say no, and again tell him that the bar was completely full.  Well, he says, you need to put your name on a list to be seated.  Why?, I ask.  Because, there are people ahead of you that need to be seated.  Looking around, I saw no one waiting.  Where are these people?, I ask.  Probably outside, he replied.  It's pouring down raining outside, and there's no one standing in the rain waiting for a table, I announced.  Again I pressed with why I couldn't have one of the dozen empty tables that I saw.  I need your name for the list, was his reply.  Forget it, I said.  I'll go to an establishment that actually cares more about their customers than the protocol of getting on a list to be seated sometime far in the future.  And, with that, I left.  If I had put myself on this make-believe list (when the restaurant was half empty), the football game would have long been over before I even sat down.  This was ridiculous and unacceptable customer service.  The staff was too young and naive to deal with adult patrons.  I will not return to this restaurant again!"
Jen C.,"San Mateo, CA",17,13,,3.0,2/28/2015,"Food here is decent. Some items are good like burgers and  pizzookie, others not like avocado egg rolls, flatbreads. It's a cool place to have brews and watch the game but the food is hit or miss."
Harmony D.,"Newman, CA",0,70,34,4.0,9/23/2015,"I ordered my rib eye steak to go. No potato, lots of veggies. Delicious steak, really flavorful, cooked as I asked it to be. Hard to have a steak delicious after transporting to a hotel."
Sarah M.,"Wailea, HI",49,10,16,5.0,8/30/2012,"I really enjoy coming to BJs.  They have the best beers, and if you have never had a Jerry Burst you must try one (but for me I get more Red than Berryburst ;) )  I love the seasonal beers that they offer as well - my favorites being the Nitwit, Octoberfest, and Grand Cru :) If you aren't into beer, try the Pomegranate Margarita, its amazing.    Yes, at times they get very busy so the service may be a little slower during these times, however, I have always had a great experience.  I love sitting at the bar top, the bartenders are always very friendly, and you can't beat BJ's TV setup!  I wish I could remember all the bartender's names, because I have had great experiences with all of them!   My favorite food items are the Ahi Salad, Ahi Poke, the Flatbread Pizzas, Stuffed Mushrooms, Boneless Wings, and Pulled Pork Sliders!  Try these items! They are delicious!  (Pulled Pork Sliders aren't on the menu, but THEY ARE AMAZING, and you can still order them!)   They just added a brand new patio with a fireplace, and it is beautiful! A great area to hangout in the evenings, as well as during lunch :) Overall, I love BJ's, and I will continue to be back for the delicious beer and food :)"
Tiffany Y.,"San Mateo, CA",1,8,,3.0,6/29/2016,"I must admit that one of the reasons I enjoy BJ's as much as I do is because of the seasoned wedge cut fries on the menu. We also had the fish and chips, derby cobb salad, and triple chocolate chip pizookie. The fish was pretty good - pretty much what you would expect from a brewery/grill restaurant like BJ's. The salad was very light and refreshing - not overly dressed and the grilled chicken was well seasoned. The star of the show was definitely the pizookie. It's been awhile since I've had one at BJ's but it was warm and rich. If you are a chocolate fan, this is definitely the one to get. All others would probably find it cloyingly sweet but I personally enjoyed it."
Paul B.,"San Bruno, CA",1,9,,2.0,12/19/2014,I like the food at this BJ's but that's where the liking stops!....I've come to the San Mateo location at least 6x.   The ONLY time I had a very good experience is when I observed a middle-aged female manager actually managing the staff.  That being said...is there no decent service anymore?! Tonight...the kitchen lost out check too.  The manager I spoke of above is the only reason this place is held together.  If only she worked every time I go. I've had 2 really bad servers at the Bar Area whereby they barely even check on you.  Can I get a refill on my water without having to use a flare gun?!  Come on guys.
Noah M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/28/2016,I would give them 0 stars if I could. This place is ridiculous. They gave us food that we didn't even order and the waitress was straight up negligent. She even poured water into my friends Mountain Dew. The drink is bright green how do you confuse that for water? And we asked for a free pizookie because we received an offer over email and she looked straight up mad that we were asking for it. And then she gave us one that we didn't even request and I couldn't eat because I'm allergic to nuts. I'm glad I didn't eat it because that would have been bad. I understand that she's busy but at least put in some sort of effort.
Ruth C.,"Littleton, CO",79,601,279,2.0,5/15/2014,Nothing special and if I weren't with friends I probably would have left and gone somewhere else. I got the ribs which were okay but not great. Service was weak and energy of the place was flat.
Sam V.,"Visalia, CA",2,2,,4.0,10/8/2015,Great service. Came here at lunch with a few of my coworkers and we were seated quickly. Food was good and came out quickly.
Barbara S.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",0,10,,3.0,10/7/2015,The food was great but the server was too busy and felt like It was a rush & hurry and get out. No time for the customer!!
paul h.,"Foster City, CA",5,9,1,4.0,4/25/2014,"I went there Sunday lunch time, and there were an employee training meeting just next to my table. Otherwise everything OK LOCATION: Close to Target PARKING: Easy ENTRY: OK INTERIOR: OK SERVICE: OK FOOD: Good VERDICT: will come again"
Sapna T.,"Hayward, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/19/2015,"Mediocre service. Jessica M just assumed the rest of our cash was her tip, didn't even hand our change back. Barely serviced us. Boo  tumbs down"
Crista F.,"Santa Ana, CA",1,3,,3.0,9/15/2015,"Today I called at 11 am (opening) and requested to have a reservation for tonight at 7:30 pm. It's officially 30 minutes after our reservation time and we have yet to be seated. Tell me BJ's, what is the point of a reservation if I'm going to sit outside and wait? Not only that, people who came after us were seated while we were still outside waiting. What a joke. I love BJs but I was really disappointed in this location. I waited until after eating to post this to see if things got better. The waitress helped to turn things around, she was really nice and patient, I noticed a lot of other reviews complained about the attitudes of the servers. Unfortunately I forgot to catch her name. The food was good and didn't take too long to come out, no problems with sanitation. My biggest issue was the fact that we made reservations and still waited 30 minutes to be seated.  Obviously this location ignores reservations."
Erika G.,"Oakland, CA",0,39,11,1.0,2/22/2016,"Terrible customer service! The food is good, but the staff is horrible. Went in on a Friday night and called to put my name on the list. I was told it would be 20-30 min. When I arrived the restaurant was packed. I go to check in and I was told my name was NOT on the list. I showed the guy my call log showing the call to them. I'm told that he will shorten my wait time. Well everyone who was already there is getting sat down. Even people who arrived after I did were sat! So I go up and ask if my wait time had been shortened. I am told I was next to be seated. Now on to the terrible service by the waiter! There is a large group of about 10 people to my side. The waiter comes over takes our drink order. He was friendly and almost a bit flirty. Young, tall, with a beard. (Didn't catch his name). Well we ordered a mojito and a beer, which took forever to come out. Ordered potato skins as an appetizer, and someone else brought it out. I needed ketchup and the waiter never came to ask if we needed anything. Had to eat potatoes without ketchup. Food took a long time to come out too!! Ordered a pizza and some pasta. Well ONCE AGAIN someone else brought out the food. I was told at the Fremont bjs that they are supposed to serve the first slice of pizza to you, which they didn't even offer. I asked the guy if he could bring cheese and pepper for the pizza. Well, I waited and waited and nothing!!!! Yet I saw him bringing out food to the large party by us, made eye contact with him and I never received the cheese and pepper. Well I had a slice of pizza w out the cheese and pepper, at which the pizza had already gotten cold. We were out of drinks and my boyfriend had already finished his meal. Then the waiter FINALLY comes to us and asks him if he wants another beer (he had not come to our table since he brought out our drinks) I ask him for more water and told him I had been waiting for the cheese and pepper since the food had been brought out. He brought it out quickly and didn't apologize. At that point we asked for a box and the check.  He brings out the check without the little notebook thing. When he goes to pick up the card and receipt he just walks past up doesn't say a word and picks it up. When he brings back the card and receipt for us to sign he DOESNT even SAY THANK YOU!!! Just places the receipt and card on table and walks away. Terrible service! Never offered us if we wanted desert or anything!!! We usually go to this bjs instead of the one in Fremont which is closer to us. But this is by far the WORST service I have ever had at Bj's. If I could give them half a star I would. WONT BE COMING BACK HERE!"
Denny M.,"Toms River, NJ",4,54,3,3.0,8/16/2015,"Good wings and flatbread. Couple of IPAs and I'm ready to pass out. Cool place, will come back."
Nishank K.,"San Francisco, CA",4,6,,1.0,8/14/2015,I was okay with this place but this is turning out to  be a nightmare! I am sitting here right now waiting for the cheque (been 20 mins) after sitting through wrong orders and ridiculously slow service.. I will miss some of their beer but this is it for me.
Steven C.,"Ontario, CA",13,5,,1.0,8/28/2015,So i go in the other night and sit at the bar took 15 min just to get a server for my drink i ordered appetizer and the ribeye i ask for it medium took about 25 min to come out and when it gets to me its well done so i ask the server to take it off the bill and just charge me for the food ate my sides for the steak were soup and salad if i had ate the steak it would of been $23 dont get me wrong i have no pronlem paying for my food but really $10 for soup and salad that were just supposed to be sides wow so that big ribeye with out sides is only $13 good to know no more sides for me
Larry S.,"Skokie, IL",16,25,,3.0,8/3/2015,"The food and the service was fine but all the draft beer was flat. A beer should have a nice layer of foam on top. A ""brewery"" should know that."
Sav V.,"San Mateo, CA",0,31,,2.0,3/3/2014,"I work in the same shopping center as BJ's so I find myself here a lot, and majority of the time the service is horrible. Although I do love their pulled pork bbq sandwich, last time I went with my boyfriend we had about 6 different waiters/watresses (I'm guessing no one wanted to designate their time to helping us, that's okay we didn't tip them) And when I asked for a refill (which took forever because no one would come to our booth) I didn't receive it until we were done eating, so it was a waste. Haven't gone back for about a month or so. Not really planning on it unless I'm craving a pizookie."
