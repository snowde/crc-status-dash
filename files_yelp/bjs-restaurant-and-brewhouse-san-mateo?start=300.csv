Ranisha P.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/30/2016,We were there for like 20 minutes at the bar and no one helped us. They decided to help the table next to us in a heartbeat though first time that's happened.. Pretty disappointed because that peanut butter pizookie is CLUTCH. Had to walk out smh
Marleny R.,"Redwood City, CA",53,16,1,5.0,2/7/2016,Omg i love this place it has amazing ribs. This is a late post but I've been here many times and I've always had good service and yummy food the best service we've got was from a gentleman named Kyle he's awesome. I would totally recommend coming here
Ta S.,"San Mateo, CA",96,41,55,5.0,2/11/2014,"Late night Happy Hour is from 10pm to closing, Monday through Thursday I believe. Walked in and went straight to the bar to seat ourselves. We came to just get some appetizers for dinner. The best beginnings are our favorite, along with the California flat bread pizza. Perfect dinner combination for 2 people who share food all the time. Waiter came and gave us our menus and told us it was Happy Hour. We weren't planning on getting drinks because 1 drink is usually from $8-$12, or more. So we ordered 2 rounds of strawberry mojito and vodka martini. We left full and satisfied. Food here is always amazing and priced right. We frequent here at least once a month, always on different days and times!"
April T.,"San Mateo, CA",96,119,33,4.0,6/15/2012,"Though I really like the food here, I usually hate coming here because the service is so terrible. Fortunately, we were seated in the right spot and had Gustavo as our server. He was the best server we have ever had here.  Potato Skins = Crispy, cheesy, bacony. Needs more green onions! Loved that an extra sour cream was no problem Cobb Salad = Love the bite sized crunchy lettuce, feta crumbles, diced tomatoes, avocado, cubed turkey, and creamy garlic dressing. I hope this is the start of a new relationship."
Phil J.,"San Carlos, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/18/2015,"We haven't been here for the longest time,  but I'm so glad we came back not only because of the good food but because we met one of the most excellent waiter we had  ,  Darren. You can tell he likes what he is doing,  gave excellent recommendations came back to check on us several times,  took his time to introduce  to us his reliever when  he went on a break  and even continues  to help us on his way out for his break.  We will definitely come back not only because of the food but because of people like Darren."
Vani J.,"San Carlos, CA",11,73,,5.0,5/30/2015,I like the sports bar look it has.  Try going on a game day and you will not want to leave this place till the game isover. BJ's has got the best 'deep-dish' pizzas. Appetizer samplers are also great. Pazookie as dessert is a cherry on the cake. They have a plethora of drinks on the menu as well.
NagrajN N.,"San Mateo, CA",0,29,,1.0,7/13/2014,"The restaurant is geared more for beer drinkers. Food and Service not that great. Probably a not so good place to go with your family.  They give the local school teachers ""coupons""  for the kids. Don't fall for it. Take your kid someplace else."
Quintara F.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2,,1.0,5/24/2016,I wouldn't give this place 1 star! My mother and I came in around 11pm and waited at the hostess booth for 8mins and a lady finally walked over an said have you been helped an we obviously said no. Then she told us to sit wherever we like and we did and no one ever came over to serve us. We sat there for about 11mins.. I do believe it was due to our skin color since the couple before us was not African American and went in 5 mins before us and got seated and apparently waited on right away.
Casey T.,"Glendale, AZ",118,48,7,1.0,11/3/2013,"WORST FOOD EXPERIENCE EVER. I am so disappointed with their food and service! I was part of a party of 6 (including my 2 year old daughter) and was seated 50 minutes after arrival. When we first arrived they seemed busy so I understood the wait, but then it slowed down a lot and I assumed they were trying to catch up.  After we were finally seated, we ordered some drinks and then again waited another 15 minutes for our server to come back around and get our appetizer order.  We planned on ordering our meal right then, but one of our party members stepped out so we decided to wait until he returned. About 5 mins later he did and she was nowhere in sight.  So we waited again.  We waited for 30 minutes for this server! It wasn't even busy in the restaurant!  At this point we had barley received our appetizers. After we ordered we were confident that it would be smooth sailing from here. Far from it. After another 20 minute wait I THEN see her start to enter our order in the POS system!! I've been in the food industry for years and I know that the kitchen does not receive your order until you enter it in! I was in shock.  A good 45 minutes goes by and I asked her where our food was. She goes back to the kitchen and then almost immediately brings it out..... Guess she forgot about us?  Anyways, we all got our plates and the order was correct. I ordered ribs for myself and macaroni for my daughter. FOOD QUALITY: ONE GRADE ABOVE DOG FOOD. The ribs were very tough, bare, AND COLD!! In addition, my daughters macaroni was from a box brand that I could have bought from a mini-mart!  By the time she took it back to heat up and brought it back out, everyone was already done with their meal. At this point I lost my appetite. I ate a few strips then asked for it to go. Bill was 170 and if I had it my way she wouldn't have received a tip, but some others in the party felt bad so they gave her a few dollars.  Point is I couldn't find this girl the whole night and we waited for over 2 hours! That is unheard of! Fast forward to tonight. I came home and was hungry for a snack so I ate the BJ's left overs. Well, I should have known better by now but I didn't realize the nightmare wasn't over. I ate the left over macoroni and ribs. Last thing I ate tonight. It is now 4:00am and I have FOOD POISONING! Are you kidding me?! My body literally just rejected their nasty food.  Question everyone wants to know.... Would I ever eat there again?  I think this brief horror story says it all! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"
Cait W.,"San Francisco, CA",89,8,,2.0,2/26/2014,"Overall I was very disappointed by the food and service at this location.  I had heard great things about BJ's in general (with respect to the fact that it is a chain) so some co-workers and I decided to give it a try.   #1 - The waiter didn't seem to know the menu, but I cut him some slack assuming he could be new. #2 - We ordered an appetizer that had bacon in the dressing but asked for the dressing to be on the side because one of our co-workers is vegetarian. Well, it came with the dressing on the side but they still sprinkled bacon bits all over the food and plate.  We told them we wanted it remade so a vegetarian could eat it and he didn't understand why we couldn't just brush off the bacon.  If any of you are a vegetarian or have vegetarian friends you know that you can't just ""brush it off"" to make it a vegetarian dish. #3 - My pizza, which they are supposed to be known for, was EXTREMELY dry.  There was almost NO sauce on it and it took me about 5 minutes to even get ahold of the waiter to ask for a side of dressing. Our experience wasn't horrible but definitely sub par.  I don't think our office will be going back there any time soon."
Jessica S.,"San Mateo, CA",78,13,,1.0,8/26/2013,"I went to BJ's on Saturday night (8/24) with one of my girl friends for dinner and drinks. The overall wait time for a table at 6pm on a Saturday wasn't bad at all (about 10 minutes).   When we got to our table we ordered drinks from the bar (I ordered the sangria and my friend ordered the peach margarita) when we got them they were very very very sweet (and i stress the VERY) and tasted like juice. Normally I wouldn't complain about such a sweet drink but this was overly sweet like my teeth HURT!  We ordered pretty quickly having come there plenty of times before, I knew what I wanted (A BBQ ranch chicken salad) and my friend ordered a (i believe its called) Thai Chicken salad. It tasted good. I enjoyed it. We even ordered a pazookie to share after our salads.  Since this BJ's is so close to the Target in Bridgepoint we decided to take a little stroll through after our meal. It wasn't even 30 minutes after eating and I felt really really sick and my friend did too! I needed to go home and QUICKLY! We got food poisioning! Bad. I'll spare you the details but I couldn't get off my toilet for at least an hour and once I did all I felt was weak and chilly. Sleeping was the only thing to make me feel better in between rushing to the bathroom.  Needless to say, I don't think I'll ever go to a BJ's again. I'm pretty sure it was the salad that made us sick because my friend and I had different drinks and even different salads but with similar ingredients (this is where we find a connection to possibly getting sick). The pazookie was cooked completely so I find no issue with it. My stomach has been in knots since then and I'm missing out on a full days pay just because of this horrible feeling in my stomach.   For that BJ's you get one (1) star from me and I'll be sure to talk to a manager whichever one will listen to me."
Boss H.,"San Francisco, CA",337,30,68,2.0,10/17/2015,"I usually love coming to BJ's, but this was by far the worst experience I've encountered. We came in at 9:30pm on a Saturday night and was surprised that there was no wait ; we were seated almost immediately. Once the order was placed it took nearly 40 mins for our food to come. Upon the completion of our meals the bill was brought out without a b-day shout out to one person in our party. We notified the staff about the mix up and they said they forgot to tell our waitress. Our server brought out a pazookie, slapped it on the table, lit the candle and then walked away without even saying happy birthday. To top off the evening I took my two sons to the restroom before leaving and was disgusted at the condition of the bathroom. Paper towels spilling out from two receptacles(paper towels outside the restroom as well), floors wet and dirty, and one sink filled with soggy wet paper towels; that one employee had washed his hands and just left everything as it was. The reason I'm complaining is that there were plenty of staff on duty, and somehow all of these things were overlooked, and it wasn't as busy as I've seen in the past. I'm giving the review two stars because the food was decent despite the bad customer service and filthy appearance overall."
Kristina S.,"San Mateo, CA",39,196,237,2.0,4/28/2014,"Their lunch combos are a good deal. I had the half sandwich and salad w/ thin cut fries. Pretty generous size portions that are filling for lunch - left with a to go box.  The sandwich and fries were decent. The salad in the other hand was disappointing. The lettuce didn't taste very fresh and wasn't very crisp. There were 3 drops of dressing. I didn't ask for more since I didn't want the added calories - especially since I wasn't truly enjoying my salad anyways. I had one of their frequent lunch cards but was informed that they transitioned to a new reward program. So the waitress have me a courtesy card in return. Will come back for appetizers, drinks and dessert."
Michael G.,"San Mateo, CA",0,11,3,4.0,9/10/2015,BJs is a chain so I wasn't expecting much. Good sports bar area with plenty of TVs. Really busy but was seated quickly. Had a server in training with a fantastic mustache and an odd yet enthusiastic demeanor. Food was good and their house brewed beer was also tasty. Only gripe was that my last beer I ordered was the wrong beer but that's okay.
H M.,"San Mateo, CA",1,58,,1.0,9/2/2013,"We attempted to have lunch there today, the order was taken wrong, 20 minutes after the order was taken the waiter told us we had to order something else.  When the orders did come they were 15 minutes apart and wrong again.  When the bill came we have been charged for the things we were told we could not get.   I asked to speak to a manager and he did not appear interested, he took the items off the bill we did not receive but could clearly have cared less.  Zero customer service and we will not be back."
Autumn S.,"San Mateo, CA",9,50,9,2.0,5/22/2015,"I've never had good service when coming here. It doesn't matter if they are super busy or dead. I'm not sure what it is about this bjs. Also, is their mayonnaise miracle whip? They ""mayo"" I ordered tasted a little funny."
David C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/28/2015,I love BJs. But I just watched servers go to all eight surrounding tables at least 3-4 times and serve food before someone noticed I hadn't even gotten a hello or a glass of water. What a disappointment.
Justin P.,"South San Francisco, CA",48,16,4,1.0,5/5/2015,"Martin was our server. It wasn't even that busy and service was so poor. Ask him what kind of desserts they had, Martin our server throws the menu and tells me to look and says we have too many.  Couldn't even describe any of the desserts, makes me wander if his menu knowledge is up to par.  Doesn't check back on our meal to see if we were good. Doesn't buss our plates after we were done. Again was not even busy. He needs to re-evaluate the steps of service because he obviously sucked. I used to come here a lot with friends and family, we always have parties here but now I am starting to re-think."
Tim D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,2,1,3.0,8/20/2014,"Pros:  1) Mediterranean chicken tacos were great 2) Food was cheap Cons: 1) Service was slower even at 9PM 2) Brought the wrong food to our table then forgot my wedge fries :( Overall I rate this dining experience a ""Meh"". Probably wouldn't go back with all the other cool places to try around San Fran."
Emily G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,128,1,3.0,5/27/2015,I didn't think there was anything special about this place. Nothing really stood out to me.
