Steve J.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/9/2015,"We love this place and eat here quite often. The food and service are both good. The ambiance is reflective a restaurant that costs much more money, it is morden, quiet and comfortable. For lunch, it is the best deal around. Our favorites are either the Salad and Pizza combo or the BBQ combo. Both are delicious, plenty of food and cost around $8.00 each. We will continue eating here for years!"
T H.,"Redwood City, CA",0,16,,3.0,8/15/2015,"The food is great and the lunch specials are reasonable priced. The service is a 50 50 split. You never get mediocre service it is either fantastic of terrible. The cookie ice cream desserts are pretty good, but you will feel the calories as you eat for those that care."
Jason B.,"San Francisco, CA",3,3477,5,2.0,7/5/2013,"Enlightened. First some credit where credit it due. They are at least offering alternatives: Bison burger didn't have the ""bold seasoning"" the menu proclaimed and unfortunately disappointing. Side salad at no charge was the best part. Rest of the menu is summed up here:  Overabundance of fried food, creamy sauces, cheese, and double patty burgers. Too many with 2000+ calories. It exemplified the chain dining experience. Bland surroundings. Numerous televisions. Server trying to get me to start with crispy calamari and end with a giant cookie. No. We have an obesity epidemic. Places like BJ's contribute. It's going to take collective effort to turn this trend around. Time to be enlightened: "
Royo Y.,"San Francisco, CA",7,47,6,1.0,11/9/2013,"So I ordered the lunch special because I wasn't super hungry and in a rush. After waiting forever for it, the waiter put it down in front of me. I just sat their stunned. Seeing my reaction, the waiter asked if there was any problem... I just pointed to the plate and thought... ummm I guess this is what you intended to serve me... I went and grabbed a menu to compare what they told me I was getting to what I actually got. Let's just say it wasn't even close. What I got was a TV dinner my kid made in a microwave. Sauce looked like it was thrown on the plate from across the room. I don't know if all BJ's are alike, but if the chain allows this location to operate like this, I'd be a little wary of their standards. Goodbye BJ's"
David H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,41,4.0,6/7/2014,"Go for the beer! Stay for the food. Hey! It's not Michelin rated, but it has consistently good food, good beer, lively waitstaff, and all the cacophony of a sport's bar. An enjoyable night out."
Gina M.,"Kansas City, MO",6,66,64,3.0,5/13/2015,"This place has a great menu and I love that they post the calories. However...service was super slow and there was no place in the bar to sit. I don't need happy hour because I'm here for work, but why do restaurants have to limit it to the bar only? The cocktail menu doesn't list the prices. Everyone wants to know the cost of anything they pay for-put the price on your menu. I ordered nachos for an appetizer (they were out of Frito's for it) so I had an ""off the menu"" nachos. They were large, simple, and too many bites had heaps of taco spice sprinkled on. The mango salad was good. I do like this place but this particular location needs work. (And a cleaning-it smells like a bar that hasn't been cleaned in months)"
Aaronette K.,"Oakland, CA",38,26,28,5.0,1/18/2015,We came in not expecting to be impressed but boy we're we. Rib eye cooked to perfection and only $20 and deliciously fried chicken wings.  And to top it off our server Annahid was knowledgeable and gave outstanding service. A definite return when in Foster City and we don't generally do these kinda restaurants. Kudos to our server for giving these industry folks a great experience.
J N.,"Chicago, IL",4,76,,2.0,9/16/2015,"I love the atmosphere here but they need to address the menu. The menu is is far too large to enable any kitchen staff to put out a quality meal. I would remove two thirds of the items and turn the menu into more of a pub menu. All you need is some fried options, a few sandwiches, maybe a soup and a couple of salads. If they actually did this, the service staff might have a fighting chance of being able to please the customers."
Marleen C.,"San Francisco, CA",162,77,232,3.0,4/8/2012,It is what it is.  Nothing notable.  The All Meat pizza was consistent with other franchise locations.  The wings and ribs were extremely dry and only edible after drenched in sauce.  Customer service was decent. The only good thing is that they're open late.
Angeli R.,"Vallejo, CA",99,31,100,1.0,4/9/2015,Worst customer service. My family came to visit me for lunch so I decided to take them here! What a horrible idea. We got seated right away and waited about 15 minutes because no waitress came not even to serve water!'
Joe S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/24/2015,"I was just here with some co-workers the food was good but when we arrived the place was empty we asked for a table and were told there was a wait, we asked why as hardly anyone in the place, it was a nightmare to get seated we were shuffled around from table to table.  Once we were able to order our waitress was very good friendly and the service was fast and the food tasted very good getting seated in an empty restaurant was the most bizare thing I have ever experienced"
Jessica M.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,56,,2.0,4/17/2016,"Food is usually good but they get 2 stars for service. It's sucks. Staff lets old plates stack up. Only here do I eat a new plate while the old ones are stacking up. Other than that, the place is cool."
Rachel W.,"San Mateo, CA",119,28,1,2.0,8/10/2014,"I came here at the beginning of July for my cousin's birthday. Note that I just stayed because it was his birthday and I wasn't going to destroy it because of lack of manners or someone's terrible ethics. I was hardly recognized by the waiter, when I walked in to allow a table. Nothing. If she was having a bad day and could not suck it up, whatever. Later on while we were outside waiting, my cousin (being the optimistic, foolish guy he is) says something along the lines of ""oh she must think I'm adorable"" jokingly. I look over and it is that same girl with the attitude staring at us. It really felt like a high school exchange. I called after my 24 hour shift two days after the event. Requested to speak to a supervisor because it was definitely uncalled for, regarding what occurred. No one called back. Thanks for the direction of that BJ. Actually professional. The kicker? I think it is pretty absurd for anyone to have this behaviour, especially when the customer has done NOTHING wrong and nothing to you. There are lots of other people who work through and can suck up whatever they're going and actually be grateful for a job and show it. I have been spit at/on, attacked, had I was yelled at by every obscenity, whatever you'll be able to think of on the job, and you understand what? I still suck it up and do my job because that's what I was hired to do. Not behave like an immature brat for no reason in any way. I know I'm only one customer and I wont affect your business, but I will never be back to this place. My apologies for the lengthy review, but I had to let it outside someplace."
Maria M.,"Redwood City, CA",32,37,3,4.0,4/23/2015,"Great service every time I come here! Came in last night craving their avocado egg rolls and they were delicious as always! Hostess and server were super nice and helpful. Our server was taking care of multiple tables at once and he never once neglected us, he constantly refilled our drinks and checked in on us. Big tip for sure! Besides the egg rolls I ordered the shrimp linguini, it was ok. Lacked some flavor. My husband had the steak with asparagus and rice, he enjoyed it. My 2 year old had the kids spaghetti with shoestring fries (loved the fries)!! and apple juice. I also had a strawberry splash drink and I loved the sweetness and frothiness (sp?). It was delicious!!! They have multiple televisions playing at all times for anyone wanting to watch a game while enjoying dinner. I don't live in San Mateo but I will definitely be back here soon!"
Anjelika G.,"San Mateo, CA",7,7,1,3.0,6/11/2014,"I'm so sad to give this place a 3 star because the wait was sooooo long. My waiter took forever! Especially if I'm in a time limit too, which sucks cause I didn't even get my drink until 20 mins later.  Fettuccini was good though. But man the wait."
Aaron L.,"San Mateo, CA",13,148,18,4.0,6/1/2013,"It's Friday night and a bunch of us wanted to get together for dinner.  By the time txts and phone calls were exchanged, there was 16 of us in all.  Where to go that would be able to accommodate that many people?  There weren't many choices that we could think of so we ended up at BJs.   Being Friday night and so many people in our party I assumed we would be waiting a while to get a table.  I called about 2 hours before we were planning on showing up to see if we could make reservations.  Turns out we couldn't make reservations, but they would place our name on the waiting list ""so we would only have to wait 15 or 20 mins when we arrived"".  I was pretty skeptical, but figured it was better than nothing. When we arrived they were absolutely crushed.  There were people packed inside the entrance and people spilling out the door waiting for a table.  I figured we would surely be waiting for hours.  When I checked in with the hostess she was super nice and said it would only be about 20 minutes.  I was still skeptical (yes I'm a pessimist) but took the pager and tried to stay out of the way.  After about 10 mins our table was ready!  I was totally shocked. The service from the waiter was ok especially considering how many people we were although he was definitely a bit frazzled.  The food was decent as you would expect from BJs.   The only negative is it took a while to get our food and then the check.  The waiter finally brought the check without asking if other half of the table wanted dessert (which a couple of the kids did).  Yes, we could have still ordered dessert but it was getting late and we didn't want to wait. With all the other reviews I just thought I'd chime in since the service was so good."
Jonathan T.,"San Francisco, CA",64,16,,4.0,12/13/2014,"Great place to watch games.  Good microbrew beer selection and decent specials during professional games.  The food is standard American restaurant fare, with nothing really special, but decent quality, a well-maintained restaurant with lots of TVs, and a fun atmosphere."
Camille C.,"Richmond, CA",76,19,11,1.0,9/13/2014,This place was the worst customer service I've ever had! First we came here to waste time and had to wait because they had 12-15 empty dirty tables and one bus boy working other guy was on lunch. Then we let the manager know about this issue and he said he would take care of it. Ok then in the middle of our meal my boyfriend finds a hair in his food. So we complain again. And the manager doesn't do anything he said he wasn't going to comp us. He had this I don't care attitude and told us we can leave if we want but that's it. So we took our food to go and left. He said he wants us to leave happy well we didn't leave happy I left pissed off and still hungry considering my plate was the one that had the hair so I didn't get to even eat! The employee helping us also said he was sorry and said his manager is like that to everyone. Just a jerk!
Erika G.,"Livermore, CA",368,754,449,3.0,10/26/2011,"The restaurant section the hostess sat us in was empty BUT she sat us along the wall with the benches RIGHT NEXT TO ANOTHER COUPLE!  LAME!   Our server was gave us space.  Brought the wrong salad to DH.  Checked that our food was delivered and that if  ""Everything Ok?""  We had to ask to refill our empty drinks.  Maybe he thought our one glass was enough for us.    Food was good for a BJ's resaturant.  Pizza was tasty, a bit greasy but it was filling.  I ordered a Classic baked potato with the works.  It was really good - but thankfully you can't really mess up a baked potato with cheese and bacon.  Not sure if we'd come back here."
Callie C.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/15/2016,Writing this because of the server we had.  His name was Daren and he made a busy place and average food into a fun experience for everyone at our table.  He joked with us and had us laughing.  He was so kind to my little boy and never minded bringing him an extra cherry in his drink and extra napkins.  You don't go to a sports bar chain and expect exquisite cuisine.  But it is worth the visit when everyone has such a fun time.  Thanks Darren!  My family will definitely ask for a table I your section next time.
