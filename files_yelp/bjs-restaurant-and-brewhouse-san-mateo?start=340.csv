Tim A.,"Belmont, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/27/2015,Waitress was inattentive and completely unintuitive and the drinks were awful. Took 15 minutes just to take our order. 15 more minutes to bring our bill on a Monday night.
Annaleise S.,"Redwood City, CA",11,14,,4.0,5/13/2014,"My boyfriend and I went here on my birthday around 8pm on a Saturday.  We had about a 25 minute wait of which was fine, we understood it was busy and a Saturday!   This is a great, laid back, jeans and t-shirt kind of affair.  The food was fantastic and our service wasn't too shabby at all.  About 5 minutes after being seated and our drink and appetizer orders taken, our waitress went on her break.  One thing I really admired was, before our waitress went on her break, she introduced us to her replacement during the time she was gone.  Not only did she do it at our table, but all the other tables she was waiting on.  I have gone to one other restaurant where our waiter went on a break, but didn't let us know and someone else took over for him until the very end when we were ready to leave.  I was a bit confused as to what was going on, but in this instance, it was very well taken care of.   Our food was delicious!  We ordered potato skins for our appetizer and they were amazing!  My boyfriend ordered ribs and I ordered the chicken and broccoli pasta (rotini with grilled chicken and a creamy white sauce, equivalent to alfredo and broccoli)  for our entrees.  Because was signed up for BJ's rewards and registered for mobile bill pay, we also go a free Pizooki, which was delicious!   I believe my only complaint would have to be, is that the waitress that took over for our original waitress was not very attentive and not very knowledgeable about the POS mobile bill pay system.  My boyfriend had a question about paying his bill via is cellphone with their online bill pay.  Her answer was rather wishy-washy and then, in a rude, condescending way, she says, ""or I could just print you out a bill.""  After doing what she said to do regarding the mobile bill pay, everything updated and all was fine.  I think, unless she may have been new, waiters and waitresses should be better trained on the mobile bill pay.  Mobile bill pay is a new technology that a lot of restaurants are trying to implement, if they're going to have this technology, they really need to give proper training!"
Jes L.,"Honolulu, HI",99,68,171,1.0,10/7/2014,"went to BJ's on a saturday night around 7 pm for my BFF's ""semi-bachelorette"" party. apparently there was a shift change just as we sat down and we were introduced to a new server.  we ordered a shot and a drink each, along with our dinner. 45 min later here comes our shots along with one of the girls salad. keep in mind we all have no utensils or napkins and i'm not too sure why pouring 6 shots (from the same bottle) takes 45 minutes? next came the drinks. the server asks ""who has the mojito lite?"" and serves me a sangria, then she asks ""who ordered the strawberry mojito?"" and serves the guest of honor a blended strawberry margarita.  i've worked as a cocktail waitress in a bar and know that.. obviously a mojito and a sangria are completely different drinks and have a specific look to them, same as a strawberry mojito and a blended strawberry margarita. you should know as a server that your bartender either made the wrong drink, or you are picking up another tables order. anyway, we ""try"" our drinks just to confirm our order was wrong. we flagged down our server- again asking for utensils and to let her know our drinks are not what we had ordered. she ran off saying she'll check with the bartender.  still no utensils as the rest of our entrees come out.  thankfully an hour later.. our food order is correct. the server comes back and plops 7 sets or utensils in the middle of the table and lets us know shes still checking with the bartender about our drinks.  food was ok, nothing special. here comes the server with an explanation. she says the bartender made the wrong drinks. ok, obviously. then she tells us ""since you've already drank from your drinks, we'll just keep them on your bill"" i told her ""no, if i'm going to pay for my drink i'd prefer the drink i ordered."" she took our drinks back and brought us our correct drinks 15 min later. we were all unhappy with the service and the maid of honor just about had it. she walked over to our server and politely told her that we are not happy, especially about the drink situation, and would like to speak to the manager.  end of story- manager never came and the bill was minus the 2 incorrect drinks as well as the 2 original drinks we had ordered. if you are smart, have any sort of customer service, common sense, or have worked in the restaurant industry you know that this situation was handled incorrectly and should have been prevented by either more training or staffing the restaurant accordingly.  if you want any sort of tip whatsoever- make a little more effort to resolve the problem and if the customers are asking to speak to the manager- send them over ASAP."
Mitch O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,24,,3.0,7/3/2015,"The food and beer is good, but is also a complete rip off. Good place to watch sports. The only time I order any thing is during happy hour when the mini pizza's are half off, same with the pints. This place can also get really busy."
David J.,"San Francisco, CA",3,217,6,3.0,1/30/2015,It works. Always packed. Very loud. Service is usually good. Food is fair. Good for a loud group after work with drinks and snacks.
George F.,"Apex, NC",10,381,9,2.0,11/5/2013,A slightly below average BJ's location. Their beer is ordinary at best. I usually go with something from the guest list. I had a Lagunitas IPA which seemed like the bottom of the keg and an Anchor Steam which was great.  Their pizza is just a step above supermarket frozen. I like BJ's during their happy hour otherwise it's overpriced.
Jennifer F.,"Millbrae, CA",86,92,67,4.0,12/7/2013,"There are two main reasons why we drive all the way from San Bruno ca to this BJs; Annie, a server we've gotten many times on trips here and the chicken wraps. The service here is otherwise alright but TTTOOONNSS better then the BJs in the Tanfran mall.  Favorite dishes: Chicken Limon  Parm crusted chicken Chicken wraps  Parm chicken is prob the the most popular"
Suzanne M.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/28/2014,"World Series night. 20 tables open and folks piled into bar area hoping for a Beer. Hostess says ""we don't have waitresses for that section"". Me: did you NOT know we're in the World Series?"""
Lauren C.,"San Diego, CA",533,224,57,2.0,1/12/2013,"I typically don't like writing reviews on chain restaurants, but I have to give my experience on this particular visit to BJ's. First off, my table for 2 still had old lettuce with dressing on it. Ew. Second, my water had specks of dirt or old something... idk but it was brown and weird. Third, my wedge salad came out after my grilled sandwich...which was weird.. The sandwiches are really good. I'm not a fan of their pizza, but I always come back for a Turkey Cobb and avocado egg rolls."
Richard T.,"San Francisco, CA",50,345,249,3.0,9/23/2013,The bacon Mac and cheese was a good taste to price ratio.  This is always a solid place for gameday.
Mike S.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4,24,1,1.0,6/3/2013,"Today came in for lunch. After waiting 20+ minutes, we got our water, and now  after 50 minutes we just got our food! Horribly slow and bad service. The waiter was super slow. Beware if you don't have 2 hours for lunch! They comped half the bill, which is appreciated."
Annie E.,"Tracy, CA",47,30,42,3.0,1/4/2013,"I gave this place only three stars because we did not get very good service.  I've eaten at a few different BJ's and usually have no problem.  However, we were sat in the back of the restaurant near what looked like a staff birthday group.  They were loud, and rowdy and kept going to the computers and messing with something...  We didn't get much attention from our waiter, I had to ask for a refill on water, and our food took forever to come out. Other than the poor service, the restaurant was clean and the food tasted good."
Heather R.,"San Mateo, CA",91,68,884,1.0,11/14/2012,"Having been to the BJ's in Tanforan for lunch, dinner, and happy hour and experienced mediocre service and food, I had high expectations for this Bridgepoint location because of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, I experienced below mediocre service and food.  My husband and I dined here on Monday, November 12, 2012 at around 1 PM.  We were seated after about 10 minutes and our waitress came asking if wanted any drinks or appetizers. We mentioned that we needed a couple minutes to decide on what to order. She took those ""couple"" minutes and doubled it because it didn't take us 15 minutes to decide on what to order. A couple minutes usually means 5 minutes in my opinion. We patiently waited and waited for her to return. And FINALLY, she arrives! I ordered a BJ's bacon cheeseburger and my hubby ordered broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl.  Service here is super slow and I couldn't seem to grasp why because the restaurant was not busy. There were several empty tables and plenty of waiters/waitresses walking around. When our food arrived after God knows how long, we were ready to dig in. My burger was ok and cooked well-done just as I requested. I could taste the char-broiled meat as I sunk my teeth in. The bacon was burnt, overcooked, and dry. I am a bacon lover and bacon -hands down- is what makes a burger so much better. This burger just did not do it for me. I've had better burgers at Red Robin and that chain is supposed to be worse.  My husband was enjoying his soup until he noticed mold on the bread cap of his bread bowl. He immediately stopped eating and informed our waitress. Her response was, ""Oh, let me tell someone."" She did not apologize. Less than 2 minutes later, a man with a blue buttoned down shirt (I'm assuming he was some sort of supervisor or manager) approached our table regarding the molded bread. He said, ""No, that doesn't look right. Would you like us to get you a new one?"" This response would have been just fine except he too did not apologize for us having been served mold.  I find it very unacceptable for a restaurant to fail at thoroughly inspecting the product(s) they serve to customers. And I am astonished by the lack of sympathy and good service provided by the staff at this location. We will not return."
Derek S.,"San Jose, CA",4629,2041,7554,3.0,8/15/2009,"Came by for a team luncheon a couple weeks back. I am typically not too fond of chain restaurants, esp. pub-type of joints as I'm not a big fan of spirits. The interior of this restaurant was really nice. There was a nice ambiance and the staff were friendly and in full uniform. BJ'S Flatbread Appetizer Pizza - Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage - Definitely more along the lines of an Appetizer - why was it on the Lunch Special? -Thin crust - Toppings were few and far in between! Pizookie - Cookie w/ Ice Cream topping - The cookie seemed undercooked....tasted like dough - ...interesting experience. All in all, a nice place for a business luncheon, as it was packed on our way out...not so much for a personal night out! ;)"
Mo S.,"Oakland, CA",31,14,1,4.0,1/19/2014,"For a franchise, it's a pretty good place for decent food, decent beer and lots of TVs for the game lovers! The location is great since there isn't any restaurant catering to the happy hour crowd and the sports-watching crowd in the Foster City area. So it does fill that void pretty well without much competition. The food menu is vast, thoughtful and mostly yummy. I don't think i've had anything there that I outright hated. Some menu items are better than others - the pizzas and pizookie (dessert) are outstanding! The service is, sadly, average almost bordering on sub-par unless you're sitting at the bar itself. The servers (not any particular one) do take a long time to take orders and check in between orders. It might be they are (always) understaffed? Not sure the reason but I see that most reviewers feel the same. Deducted a star for that."
J A.,"Burlingame, CA",1,7,,2.0,4/9/2015,"Had a miserable experience after stopping in with a friend for lunch last weekend.  We chose to eat at a table in the bar area since it's generally quicker.  Having opened the menu for 2 seconds I hear a scream and see that a gentleman has fallen on the stairs leading up to the bar seating.  A few guests - my friend and I included- went to offer aid.  I think the hostess came over once he was back on his feet and ACTUALLY SHOWED THE COUPLE TO A TABLE and gave them menus.  Well, I was concerned for the wellbeing of the man and I noticed he was bleeding.  I walked over to the take out area and asked for the manager, that there was an injury and that the gentleman required first aid. The lady told me ""yes, the manager is in the back filling out paperwork.""  Unbelieveable.  So I asked for help from the bartender - got clean cloths, bag of ice and a first aid kit.  Finally the manager pops her head out and I see her for about one minute, presenting some paperwork and asking the man to sign it... ...so why am I writing this? 1) HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT DECISIIN TO SIT IN THE BACK AND FIND HER INCIDENT REPORT PAPERWORK BEFORE ADMINISTERING FIRST AID OR CALLING PARAMEDICS.  And 2) the entire time I was eating I waited to see how long it would take for the manager to direct a clean up of the area where THE BLEEDING MAN FELL.  Apparently not a big deal to have bodily fluids in the handrail and floor at her restaurant.   The two stars are for the kind and quick bartender who helped.  That guy has more sense than the front end staff and manager... At least that day.  Plus, not sure if its because I watched two other tables seated after us get their meals served, that I was so hungry, but my food was pretty good. Too bad the experience was subpar."
Charmaine L.,"Burlingame, CA",306,615,3432,3.0,9/11/2010,"bbq pulled pork sliders with crispy thin fries. 4 sizeable sliders filled with tangy tender pork sanwiched with crispy fried onion strings between two soft and fluffy buns. the crispy thin fries were light and spot on. the chocolate chunk pizookie is original and my favorite. you can't go wrong with vanilla ice cream on top of a warm, melty chocolate cookie. i normally order the berry burst cider but recently, i have to send it back because it tastes like perfume. absolutely horrific. prices are very reasonable...almost on the verge of cheap. the wait is normally 15-30 minutes, but that helps to build up the appetite for their large portions."
S U.,"Chicago, IL",2,29,,2.0,3/4/2015,"Between my colleague and I, we had a total of one customization of our order: chipotle mayo on the side of my shrimp tacos.  And, of course, the shrimp tacos not only came with chipotle mayo already on the tacos, but with it slathered on in copious amounts.  It was annoying, but since it took a full ten minutes for the server to even take our drink order and a good fifteen minutes more for our entrees, I just ate the shrimp tacos.  Meanwhile, the server was primarily interested in pushing more beers or dessert on us.  Another recent reviewer on here talks about how this place always messes up her order, which I can definitely believe."
Di R.,"Los Angeles, CA",584,358,116,4.0,8/30/2010,"We were greeted by a bubbly little hostess who showed us to our table.  We got there before noon so the place was still not packed. We had the half a sandwich and and salad wedge lunch special My friend had the chicken club and I had the cob + fries. At $6.95 each all I can say is such a deal!!!! We were served by Christina who was cute and efficient. Though our hostess was a bit perkier and I can see why management might want her up front but she should be promoted to server cuz she is very good! All and all..... I do have to say that hands down the portions, (portions for sure! Even the water glasses are huge and I love it!) service and attitude was 100% better than Woodside!"
Lenee P.,"San Mateo, CA",5,13,,4.0,4/14/2015,This place is great. I'm picky and like to change what I eat and. They never seem to have a problem making my accommodations meet they're standards.  I'll continue to come here especially  since they're deep dish pizza is amazing and the waiters & waitress are always nice and on top of it.
