jeetu c.,"Kent, WA",1,17,,1.0,2/14/2015,Had to ask for service 3 times before somebody came to our table.  And then when server came to our table you think she would be nice considering our wait.   Nope.  This place couldn't care less about their customers.  Saw others waiting as well.  Can easily tell this is a very poorly managed restaurant.  Need new management and training.
Robin G.,"San Mateo, CA",2,33,,2.0,8/17/2012,"First off, my friend Bob had massive gas that night which didn't help but it was appropriate considering the rest of the experience.  The wait was very long and the food was pretty bad.  There was a big black hair in my salad of all things. Service was fair but not great.  Bob's lower intestinal situation was the highlight of the evening and summed up the experience overall."
Olga B.,"San Bruno, CA",315,249,893,2.0,12/27/2012,"If you're a fan of American food and you have a lot of free time to spend it on infinite wait cooking, then this place is not bad! Nice interior, all excellent. But the service is very slow."
Veronika G.,"San Diego, CA",6,205,5,2.0,6/26/2014,Do NOT order their new French dip sandwich!  It was room temperature and very greasy. The au jus was really oily and tasted terrible. Awful. They should take it off the menu or fix it
Thomas B.,"Belmont, CA",29,331,121,2.0,1/9/2013,"Maybe they listened to the reviews because the service is good. But my review is based on food. It's processed low quality.  Beer 5 stars, service 4 stars, service timing 3 stars (don't show up in a hurry), food definitely 1 star (essentially fast food, stay away from the pizza and burgers) I've come here a few times with a large group (under protest each time).  I suspect I'll be forced to visit again because of a function (under protest). I wouldn't of my own free will, I like good food."
Dub L.,"San Francisco, CA",5,7,3,1.0,9/3/2012,"I agree with the Honest F review.  Service at this place is for the birds!  My wife and I went in for dinner.  We were seated quickly, and was told our server would be back to take our drink order.  We looked through the menu for five minutes, and no server.  We waited another five minutes, still no server.  Meanwhile, there are a handful of servers, zipping by us with trays of food, and drink.  It's ten minutes in, and still nobody to take our drink order.  I told my wife to give it five more minutes.  No order within that last five, we walk. Meanwhile, a couple seated behind, us got service right away, even though they sat down after we had already been waiting ten minutes!  WTF?  We didn't even give it the last full five, and said let's blow this hot dog stand!  The food has always been decent each time we've visited, but the service sucks a$$!  This might've been the last straw!  A nasty email to corporate is in the works!"
Marck N.,"Emeryville, CA",138,1039,58,3.0,5/2/2011,"Came here only for drinks and dessert.  The pazooki was good. But who is not to like a warm cookie with ice cream on top. Indulgence.  Had one of the brews that BJ's produces. Don't recall which one, but it was one of the darker ales.  It was really good, sweet, savory, with a nice balance of hops. Overall it felt like your typical chain restaurant, but with it's own brewery.  Looking at the dishes that were passing by, the servings are huge. So the next time here for dinner, unbuckle the belt and let go."
Kenneth M.,"San Mateo, CA",25,15,14,5.0,12/24/2013,Great service great food this place is amazing I love the staff and the drinks are off the hook. I really like everything here. It's beautiful establishment and the servers are very fancy. They so deserve these 5 stars
Kenson K.,"Emeryville, CA",112,1054,157,3.0,4/24/2011,"This is a typical chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesdays or the like. It has a sports bar feel to it what with all of the vid screens with streaming sports events. I've been  to the one in San Bruno and it has the same feel to it. The food is your typical restaurant chain food, wings, salads, nachos, etc etc. The beer was and dessert we ordered was good. Service was meh. I think the server had an off night. She was just going thru the motions, but you could tell she wasn't happy to be there."
Aurora K.,"San Mateo, CA",26,19,,3.0,9/1/2013,"This review is for the service - the food is alright. The perks are a huge selection of menu items and late hours. Last night me and my friends went to BJs because I had a coupon for a free pizookie with the purchase of an entree. Problem is, we wanted the calamari appetizer instead of an entree. So I asked the server if we could make that switch and she said it wasn't possible. I asked to speak to the manager and he explained that the button the servers press is only for an entree, but that he would be able to switch it for us. I appreciate his explanation and willingness to go the extra mile to make us happy! My server was also very sweet and gracious. It's this kind of service that makes for memorable restaurant experiences."
Matt M.,"Redwood City, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/7/2013,"A few of my friends and I came here on New Years Eve. Our server was quirky, funny, and very helpful. He gave us the service we needed, and also came over just to say a few conversational things a few times. Great guy, great service. Our group had been there before, quite a few times and we all love the food every time. Great pizzas, and you have to love the Pizookies!  I also ordered take-out from BJ's not long ago for my girlfriend and I, and the food was ready on time, and it tasted just as good as sitting down in the restaurant. Could not be happier with this restaurant."
Joanna F.,"San Mateo, CA",8,37,,3.0,7/26/2014,"I've been here a couple times and today's visit left me wondering if I'll go back. I ordered the brunch flatbread, mostly because it had potatoes on it. When it came out, there were no potatoes. I asked our waitress (who wasn't the friendliest) and she informed me that you have to ask for them. Weird, considering it's listed as one of the toppings. She offered to give me them on the side, but sadly I was done and not interested at the point. It also took FOREVER to get our daughter's Mac n cheese and rice. But my husband enjoyed his bison burger!"
Kaiya E.,"Daly City, CA",6,15,,5.0,9/26/2012,"First off I want to start by saying that our waitress was really nice and very good and when it came to our food ,one of our pizzas was brought out (not by our waitress) and was burnt... Once we got our waitresses attention to tell her what was wrong she came to our table and saw the pizza before we got the chance to tell her it was burnt she said that they should not have served us the pizza and she was really sorry that it happened and knocked down the price of our pizzas.  Good service!"
Natalie L.,"Fremont, CA",225,38,28,5.0,7/7/2012,"MMM, good drinks and good food. Perfect way to spend my Saturday. :) I was in the area today picking up some stuff, and decided to grab some food with my mom before heading back home. We passed by BJ's and I got a craving for their delicious stuffed mushrooms, so we parked and went inside.  We were seated quickly, and our server, Jessica, was friendly, fast, and efficient. For drinks, I had a Watermelon Mojito, which was amazing...strong yet sweet- just the way I like my drinks! My mom ordered a Strawberry Lemonade and it was also pretty good.  Jessica asked us if we knew what we wanted, and I told her that we knew we wanted the mushrooms, and my mom and I were just deciding on other appetizers to go with it. She was kind enough to suggest a mini portobello pizza, and we agreed it sounded awesome as well. We also got the crispy artichoke hearts, and a tomato mozzarella salad, which we've had before, and loved. Shoot that salad....is soo good. It's simple and delicious, and I do plan to re-create it in my own kitchen, I promise you this. ;)  We were able to watch the Giants game while we snacked on our food, which arrived in a timely matter. When we finished, I confessed to my mother that I still wanted more stuffed mushrooms- so we ordered another round to go, and brought it home to share with my Grandma, too, along with some of the leftovers, which weren't much, since everything was so yummy! I really liked that Jessica was friendly, but gave us our space, as well. It was also so nice to get suggestions on menu items. I love BJ's, but sometimes the menu can be intimidating if I haven't already tried something. I am so indesicive when it comes to food sometimes, it's nice to have someone tell me, ""Hey, you might like this..."" and make the decision for me, before I change my mind eight times.  If you come here, ask for Jessica. And go on a day when you can catch a good game and drink a watermelon mojito- or even a berry cider, or a strawbeery lemonade, too! :D"
Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",149,660,557,4.0,10/2/2010,Add another favorite to my lunch list here: Tuscan Tomato Bisque (excellent bright flavor) with Grilled Ham & Cheese (a crispy and delicious comfort sandwich). And Krystal was an excellent waitress that gave me a Frequent Lunch card that gives you $10 credit for each 7 lunches.
Steve S.,"Antioch, CA",5,82,15,3.0,10/26/2014,Ok just average ..2 1/2 stars for service. Food was ordered medium. Came well done but was too hungry to send back.  Wanted to watch World Series
Todd A.,"Castro Valley, CA",112,25,54,4.0,2/8/2015,"Great menu.  Service was a little light. Those mixed berry drinks were really good. Great desserts,  make sure to sign up for their app to reserve tables,  get points,  etc."
Amanda G.,"Redwood City, CA",0,35,11,3.0,11/9/2012,"This place is good. My boyfriend LOVES the beer selection/quality and that they have huge tvs playing the sports channels.  The food is okay. It depends what you get. Pasta is a no-go for me here, as it was stuck together and chewy, but the parmesean crusted chicken is delicious and so is the chicken club. Burgers are good, but it's kind of hard to screw up a burger. Pizza is good but not big enough to feed entire table and is therefore overpriced. Their baked beignet (dessert) is not so good... kind of chewy and not so flavorful. It's basically hit and miss.  We went here for the Giants game one night (during post season) and informed them so, but they seated us in the far back corner with obstructed views to the tvs. My boyfriend was not too happy. Another thing is the waiters often have issues with my boyfriend's legit ID (he is turning 23) and they've also had issues with him ordering a pitcher before, getting the manager both times. It was awkward!  Sometimes service is slow. This place gets busy though. It's alright, nothing to get excited over."
L P.,"Oakland, CA",0,9,6,1.0,1/22/2015,"Wasn't impressed with the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi.  Ordered several to go plates for department meeting, 2 were the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi that were not identically plated. 1/2 the rice serving on 1 plate, both dry, no seasoning, rice soaked in pineapple juice."
Sophia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,289,5,3.0,12/18/2014,"Pretty good place for a huge party of people!! I love their eggrolls and Salads!! Their fries are delicious and also their burgers!! The best part is their pizookie ice cream sandwich !!!!!!! Their service could be a bit better, but overall I would still come in with friends and family to enjoy the meals!"
