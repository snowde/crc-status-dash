Annie H.,"New York, NY",193,560,1437,4.0,2/2/2011,"Plenty of hustle and bustle even past 1pm for a weekday lunch.  The food is pretty decent - definitely better than your average bar food!  I tried the Caesar salad (not bad) and the shrimp tacos.  You can tell the shrimp had additives to make it more ""plump"", but otherwise not bad a dish. The service was awesome though, and hence the extra star.  A bit slow but reasonable given the volume of the place versus how many waiters were available.  But they try hard to be as helpful as they can be, and even volunteered to subtract an item off our total bill for taking too long to bring it out. Look forward to coming back, and trying out their beer!"
Kaneisha J.,"Palo Alto, CA",34,3,1,4.0,11/17/2015,"This location is the best that I have been to. The food was great, the service needs improvement but over all great experience."
Janice T.,"Belmont, CA",18,25,9,1.0,10/17/2015,"10:40 PM on a Sat night.  Place is not full, has people here.  Still took forever to get seated!  Then to be seated...at a still dirty table.  Which took another 15 mins to get that spot cleaned.  Com'on now...it's not even busy?!"
Ed O.,"San Mateo, CA",16,93,26,1.0,12/5/2012,"This place is always packed...but it's bj's, so sort of popular with decent food. Good happy hour. Problem was at the end. We were given our bill (which we didn't ask for) but paid it anyway after we ordered pie dessert, 3 bizzookie. We waited 20min for it to come out. WTF!? Crystal the waitress apologized and said she would bring it up to the manager, still haven't heard from the manager. Haven't seen crystal either. Service took a shitty turn for the worst. Manager came 15min after. With a $10 gift card and apology. Wow... The cherry on top: they didn't even get the dessert order right! We ordered a white chocolate chip macadamia, not chocolate chip bizzookie. DON'T GO HERE IF U VALUE GOOD SERVICE"
Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97,5.0,11/4/2012,"Our server was Anahid... Not only is she beautiful, but she took care of us. Good Chicken Marsala. The Gluten cookie and ice cream are delicious."
Athena S.,"San Francisco, CA",70,776,71,1.0,2/29/2012,"ZERO stars - My friend and I both got very sick immediately after eating here recently. Called the Manager the next day to let him know what happened and while he sounded concerned, he also said he'd call me back after looking into kitchen temps etc.  He didn't bother calling back and NO follow up or concession was made.   I'll be making a report with the health dept.  My friend had to go to the hospital from puking so much.   I find it unacceptable to ignore something so serious. We had the steak and salmon and something went wrong.  I'd steer clear of this joint."
Liz D.,"Sacramento, CA",109,417,50,4.0,10/12/2012,"I was recently laid off from my job.  Is Yelp hiring, wink, wink.  :)  I met my sister for lunch this past Tuesday, since I have the time.  It was still warm outside so we wanted to soak in the sunshine.  Our waiter/server, Jordan was really nice and helpful.  Checked up on us frequently and all in all was excellent service.  Good service is very important to me when dining as well as the food.  I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos, one grilled and one fried.  It was good.  My sister had the chicken tacos and she enjoyed her dish as well.  This is a good BJ's location so I am glad I met my sister.  Lunch was fun, the company and the service overall was spectacular."
Jessica M.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,4,2,1.0,12/15/2015,"Do not order for large groups from BJ's. The quantity of food is so small, what they advertise to feed 9-10 people is 4 small pieces of fish or chicken. This was the first time I tried them, and never again."
Philip L.,"Belmont, CA",48,1184,6,4.0,11/21/2012,"BJ's is always a fun and casual place to meet up with my friends, and for that I am appreciative. The food probably has tons of calories (thick pizza, buttered bun for burgers, etc) but whatever, it's not like I eat here all the time.  I was very happy with the burger, pretty juicy and tender - so mission accomplished BJ's."
Sarah M.,"San Mateo, CA",13,16,2,3.0,3/18/2012,"I live about a five minute walk from this BJs. I didn't used to go here much, but since the recent demise of my ""only means of conveyance"", I have become something of a regular visitor, if only because it's the nearest bar to my house and it's easy to get to without a car.  I have mixed feelings about the place.   On the one hand, BJs is awesome - the lighting and atmosphere are maximum chill, the bar area has an above-average tv situation, their house beers are a pretty good deal at happy hour ($3/pint), and they serve some giant, triumphant nachos (nachos are my favorite) which are also a decent deal at happy hour.  Most of the non-nachos food is good, too.  My crew is particularly fond of the chicken-fried steak, the entree salads, and the (often overlooked) buffalo chicken wontons.   My FAVORITE thing about BJs is the service - BUT that's only because I always stick with my go-to server John.  John has always provided my friends and I with THE BEST customer service. I don't know about the rest of the employees, but if they are as polite, affable, and conscientious as John, then BJs is doing pretty well in a restaurant world often marred by servers that pay indifferent and/or sloppy attention to the experience of their patrons.   HOWEVER, dining at BJs is not entirely sunshine and happiness and being tickled about the groin with bluebird feathers.  It is often very crowded - there can be lines at any time, even on a weekday at 8:30pm. If you just want a burger and a beer and aren't down with waiting for a table, I'd recommend the Red Robin next door. Also, because the menu is so epic, none of the food is really THAT great.  You're not likely to get the best ""____"" you've ever had at BJs.  For the quality of the food, it's a little overpriced, especially outside of happy hour.  There are usually a lot of children there, so you will want to beware the crayon torpedoes, if you (like me) are not lookin' to tangle with these small creatures on your nights out. Anyway, I like to go to BJs for beer and snacks with my palz from time to time.  It's close by, nothing there has ever really sucked very much, and John is the best.  Ya heard?"
Chrissy M.,"Danville, CA",32,209,122,3.0,7/19/2012,"This is a review of lunch at BJs.  I work nearby, so I visit BJs during my lunch.  Today I came with a group of coworkers and we had 1 for lunch and allowed ourselves some time to get back to our office.  We told the waitress that we were in a bit of a rush and she told us we should be fine. The waitress was pretty good about taking our orders quickly, but the food took forever to come out of the kitchen.  We weren't really a big group, there were just 5 of us.  Also, no one in our group ordered pizza, so I wasn't sure why the kitchen took so long to serve us. I ordered the southern fried chicken lunch special.  In the picture, the chicken fried steak looks like a big healthy portion.  When the plate came out, I was wondering, where is the rest of it?  I was ok with the small chicken fried steak portion, because it was lunch, but the photo had a plentiful platter of corn.  The corn looked like confetti on my plate that was acattered sparsely. Overall, I really like BJs.  It is a good place to grab beers, ciders, or drinks.  I think it is a good place to go if you want to relax and watch 9 innings of baseball, because the pace of the food service will probably take you to the 9th inning."
Ellen H.,"San Francisco, CA",48,239,20,3.0,3/27/2013,"BJ's Mojito ($8.25) flavor was lacking, alcohol was hidden as was the price tag!  Prime rib dip $15.95 was decent as was clam chowder  Kale Brussel sprout salad $14.50 is big, sweet, barely ok. Chicken was marginal Small pizza hand-tossed, BJ's favorite ($13.50) was passable, average quality, nothing to write home about. Thai Mango and Avocado Salad ($11.50) was also passable for those who want to limit the calorie damage. A good amount of chicken and spices.  Kids Ribs ($6.95) was also average at best.  This place is decidedly average. The only reason we eat here, is because we were shopping in the center.  You can drive to Cooking Papa, ABC, Tokkies, 5 Joy to have a better meal."
Jessica S.,"Redwood City, CA",0,3,,3.0,12/26/2014,"The food is always good, typical bar food, and comes out pretty quick. I always find that I am waiting to get a table for at least 5 minutes even when there are plenty of open tables which kind of bugs me.  Other than that there is a good selection of food options and beer that will please everyone in your group."
AP H.,"San Jose, CA",207,25,10,2.0,7/13/2014,"Two stars for the food being decent and the floor manager listening to our disappointments and helping us get our check and get the hell out.  The hostess and host had poor communication. They had to ask me three times for my name before seating us. When our server came to the table we told her we only wanted entrees and no appetizers or beer, she seemed to be very disappointed and we could already tell her service was going to be terrible. When taking our orders, she started with my guy friend. I normally see women starting the orders, thought that was weird. The food was later brought out by another server, who forgot to ever give us utensils and napkins even after we asked. So I had to go steal some from another table. Then when we were able to flag down our waitress, she didn't even apologize for never bringing us the items and asked if we still needed them. After she dropped off the napkins, she never asked us about our food and walked away. After we finished our meal, she was completely neglecting our table. So then my BF had to get up and go talk to the floor manager. She was understanding enough to go find our server, get us our bill, and clear our table. Didn't leave a tip. Not coming back."
Amber K.,"Buena Park, CA",37,16,,5.0,9/20/2012,"Can't go wrong with Bj's. I'm originally from Southern California, but came into this Bj's because I went up north on vacation. As i entered the restaurant my friend and I grabbed a seat at the high tops in the bar where we were quickly greeted by our server. She immediately gave some suggestions, but because we were on vacation my friend and I wanted to try the beer taster set. All the beers I tasted were delish! After trying all those beers, I definitely craved some food. Got the buffalo wings and pot-stickers. Everything came out in a timely manner and was really good! Overall my dining experience here was great. People, food, and overall environment was awesome! Definitely would go back~"
Trish A.,"Hayward, CA",240,234,6,3.0,1/4/2013,"I can't say this name without laughing. Yes, I have a gutter brain. Couldn't you guys pick something different? At all? JB's? Really? Went here after picking up friends at the airport. Sat at the bar which served the full menu. The drinks were not watered down (whoo! score!) and we ordered deep dish pizzas and sliders - can't go wrong.  Service was friendly and efficient. Satisfied customer in the house."
Jonie Anne C.,"Foster City, CA",1,6,19,4.0,4/7/2014,What a fantastic Menu. Had a beautiful avocado egg roll and the honey crisp chicken salad. The service is excellent. I will come back again and try a new food.
Jeff G.,"Pacifica, CA",145,42,,2.0,8/29/2012,"On the positive, they have a HUGE menu.  On the negative, they have a HUGE menu.   My meaning is that lots of choices but any kitchen that tries to do everything will not be able to do quality.    This place must be a goldmine.  It is always packed.  You normally have to wait at prime time 10 - 20 minutes.  Service is hit and miss, never the worst, but never the best.   The crowd is mostly younger and expect a pretty high noise level. A great place to take teens, like my daughters when they are around.   Always some sports on the TVS that are everywhere in the restaurant.  The burgers are pretty good, much better than Red Robin nearly next door, so that is alone a reason to come.   Other dishes I have had were edible, but not anything to come for.   My wife just told me that they added a small outdoor patio, have not yet seen."
Rick H.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,26,,1.0,9/19/2015,Food took thirty minutes and the table order was wrong.  Incompetent service.  Not coming back.
Dave L.,"Austin, TX",3263,2340,17973,4.0,2/4/2008,"BJ's Brewhouse is primarily a west coast chain of restaurants, with one location in Ohio and a few in Florida. The location we went to had a fully stocked bar along with a dining room. For a drizzly Tuesday night, it was more crowded than I expected, but not crazily so - we were seated immediately when we arrived. A friend and I shared a BBQ chicken deep dish pizza. It was tasty, with a crunchy crust, pieces of chicken breast that weren't too dry, red onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and (according to the menu) a hickory-smoked sauce. Yummmmm. Jon, our server, was friendly and checked up on us during the meal. I was on vacation and asked for a creative, light shot and he came back with one called a brain hemorrhage, which I've never had. (That's peach schnapps, irish cream, and grenadine) It was sweet with a surprising texture. (Thanks to him, I ordered the same thing a few days later at another restaurant!) Prices weren't nuts, and I got buzzed on the cheap. Recommended for a try, if you've never been."
