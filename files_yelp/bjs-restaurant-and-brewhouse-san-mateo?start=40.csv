Austin D.,"Summerville, SC",67,163,88,2.0,12/27/2016,"Sadly every visit to BJ's is largely the same.  Go, have a rough time with service and/or kitchen, and swear we won't be back.  The menu and food are great, generally.  Good beer list, great desserts, etc.   It's been about 3 years so we tried again, and unfortunately the service and/or kitchen got us again.  Took about 45 mins to get our food (including the appetizers), and the kids drinks to a second try.  But it tasted good (apart from the mushroom app which I think was under the lamps a long time)"
Sanam S.,"Daly City, CA",8,21,7,1.0,11/9/2017,Ordered online my food and when I got there had to wait for 15 min. After getting home figured that order is totally wrong they forgot my salmon and other dressing was wrong as well. This place is going down really bad. When you are sitting at the bar area is a mess too. Barely waiters are coming to you and help you with your order. Terrible based on my experience
R T.,"South San Francisco, CA",54,8,1,1.0,9/20/2017,"7:00pm:  Placed order with doordash to arrive at 7:53pm 7:45pm: Doordasher calls me, says internet is down so BJs ""never received my order,"" but is going to place the order now and it will be 35 minutes. 8:15pm: Old doordasher left, new doordasher calls me to say ""BJs says they never placed your order, it's going to be another 35-40 minutes."" technology can be a nightmare, but this is just ridiculous and poor customer service.  Of course no one at BJs is answering their phone to try and resolve the situation. Not happy, will not be going back."
Alexandria G.,"San Leandro, CA",131,23,22,3.0,5/8/2017,"So this BJ's offers service consistent with what you would expect from a BJ's Brewery. The food is pretty good, the service is okay, and the atmosphere is lively. On my last visit to this location, I ordered their weekend prime rib special as did my brother. What I would say when comparing our two plates is there wasn't much consistency in terms of how they served their meat. We both ordered a 14oz cooked medium rare. His looked a bit darker than medium rare in comparison to mine but was also about a half an inch thicker than my cut. Further, their side dish portions left something to be desired when a side of broccoli was about 5 spears lol.  In terms of the service, the waitstaff was nice. However, it did appear as if maybe they were over worked as our waitress was a bit forgetful as a result. It also seemed as if they didn't want to completely utilize their restaurant space as it felt like my party as well as other parties, were confined to a small area near the entrance and bar.  Aside from all of that, the restaurant itself is family friendly as they do offer a kids meal. They have a full bar and TV's that play different sporting events. Parking isn't an issue as they are in a shopping center with a huge lot. All in all, its a good place to stop off and grab a bite if you aren't looking for anything with that non-chain restaurant wow factor."
Monique C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/22/2017,"It took them 45 minutes to bring my pizza out and when I called to ask wtf was going on he was like ""oh well it's right here""  ok well bring it outside!  Side note: the fool on the phone can't pronounce names for shit #HelpThatChild"
Ben L.,"Burlingame, CA",22,232,210,4.0,12/31/2016,I've ordered the rib eye many times but today it was exceptionally good for some reason. Baked potato and Caesar salad were very good as well. Good job cooks!
Katherine C.,"Saratoga, CA",405,34,42,1.0,5/23/2017,"I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts to go and the dish was completely burnt and bitter. Roasted or fried Brussels sprouts usually take on a sweetness that was completely absent in this dish and replaced by the bitterness. The dish was much more black and brown than green. I hope this isn't the regular quality of the Brussels sprouts, and would hope that they were not more lenient on food quality just because this was a to go order."
Lavinia J.,"San Mateo, CA",118,8,14,5.0,9/23/2017,"*****UPDATE REVIEW***** Tonight we (my sisters and I) were invited back to BJs for a ""do over"" of my birthday dinner by the GM of this location. I have to say that from the moment we arrived til the moment we walked out, we were escorted to our table by Gary (GM) who literally stopped the traffic of workers so that we could get to our table. They had birthday balloons at our table and he even allowed us to order whatever we wanted. Not only did the GM apologize for the last experience we had there but he served us personally and made sure we had everything we ordered and asked for. Our other server Steven was just as great and even went out of his way to make sure we had a great (birthday) dinner. At the end of the night they brought out a huge chocolate birthday cake for me. That was very sweet. They even gave us gift cards. Thank you Gary, for making this a wonderful experience. I appreciate this so much because I was feeling sad being that this was a place that we always enjoyed coming to with lots of family. I am happy customer once again. Thank you! P.S. My steak was perfect.  My family and I frequent this location and Im very sad to say that I had THE worst experience ever on Sunday 9/17/17! My sisters & SIL's took me out to dinner for my birthday here and we received the worst service EVER! Our waitress was new so we tried our best to keep that in mind but it was one thing after another. Between her and the cooks, everything went wrong. I ordered a Root Beer Float and she brought me Root Beer. I flagged her down to tell her I ordered a RBF and she looked at me and said ""Yes"" with a nod. I then asked where the ice cream was and she paused and with a puzzled look on her face said ""Oh, Sorry"". Everything just went downhill from there. My steak was supposed to be medium well and it came ""well done"", charred and dry. My sister got a completely different burger from what she asked for and when she finally got it, it was missing the gravy altogether. My other sister ordered sauce for her meal and her food got very cold after waiting for at least 10 minutes... she ended up NOT eating it. My Sister in law ordered 2 appetizers as her main meal and only got one. By the time she had flagged someone down (at least 20 minutes after her 1 appetizer arrived) she didn't want it anymore. There was also a trio appetizer that was never fully (only 1/3 made it to table) brought out. By the time the other 2 parts of trio came the other one was cold as hell. It was bizarre. Our waitress was often standing nearby fidgeting with her server tablet. And not really tending to our table or the many issues we were having. A manager comped the food some of the food errors but at the end of the night we paid a split tab on 2 separate cards. The next day it turns out they double charged us for our dinner. What a joke. Get it together people. Thank God a friendly server ""Treyana"" kinda helped us. We hope this NEVER happens again."
Remy H.,"Frisco, TX",0,35,,4.0,11/14/2017,"Great hot wings with bone in (sriracha flavor).  Very busy place with what we were told to be about 45-55 minute wait, but bar area open is where we sat.  It took only a 15 minute wait then they called us for a table. The person who waited on us was the Manager of BJ's (STEPHANIE); excellent food, excellent service. You won't be disappointed. Everything good...love love love their dry rub wings.  Steak good, ribs good, soup good, everything good !"
Krystyana D.,"Tracy, CA",105,14,4,1.0,8/9/2017,So we walk in and there are three young people standing at the hostess station and they don't say one word to us. So we head to the bar to find a spot...no luck..so back to the hostess bar where it seemed like we were inconveniencing them to ask for a table for two...they are not really saying anything like what's going on then we get escorted to the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen after passing 2-3 empty tables. I cannot imagine the customer service getting any better after that. NEVER GO TO THIS BJ's. It's worth the drive to San Bruno for the atmosphere and customer service.... Management needs to reorganize the staffing at this location and hire people who actually give a damn.
Anonymous A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,77,1,1.0,7/14/2017,"What a horrible experience. The service was appalling and so were the guests (a woman trying to get the crowd even more upset by sharing her story and demeaning the Host).The app for preferred seating is useless they have no idea how to handle call ahead people in person and the app. 40 minute wait despite preferred seating requests, yet there were many empty tables available it's a huge restaurant. Once seated (at the bar) the staff was overwhelmed forgetting to check in on seated guests with drinks not coming. This is one of my favorite places but this is the worst location I've been to. A day later and I still have a text message saying they'll text me when my table is ready."
Kelly A.,"San Francisco, CA",47,102,30,1.0,8/2/2017,Worst service ever!! The strawberry mojito made me vomit because it was so gross and maybe poisoned and ice cream too 30 minutes to get after waiting 20 minutes for a waiter. I left a 0000000000 dollar tip which I have never done before. I had an overall horrible experience.
Lee D.,"Green Bay, WI",25,125,90,4.0,10/4/2017,"We ate at two locations of this chain during our time in California. The first time, I didn't know what to expect as pub food is not my favorite and that was what I anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised to see multiple salad and other vegetarian options as well a statement in the (book like) menu that stated that many other menu items could potentially be prepared to be vegetarian. I had the vegan lentil and ancient grain soup both times and it was very satisfying. The first time I had one of the salads (sorry, can't remember the name but it had baby kale, blueberries and roasted Brussel sprouts) and it was quite tasty. On the second visit, I had the cauliflower tacos and they were very good. I didn't care very much for the side of seasonal grains that came with the tacos (might have been better if it was warm and not cold). There are three options of unsweetened iced tea as well as (duh!) many beer selections. Our first visit was to the San Mateo location and my mother in law, whose name is BJ, asked if there were t-shirts for sale. The manager came out with a t-shirt and gave it to her, saying she had never met anyone named BJ! (these are the t-shirts that the wait staff wear). Today we ate at the Tanforan location; it was rather noisy and crowded inside (there was a wait even at 1:30pm) and we were offered a table in the mall ""patio"". This is covered and MUCH quieter but I would not recommend sitting at the first table since every time someone opened the mall door, the breeze would hit us and the doors slammed shut, making a lot of noise. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised both times."
Juliet V.,"San Mateo, CA",141,2,,1.0,12/2/2017,"I looooove this restaurant and I can't believe I'm writing this review but my experience last night was awful! Bj's is usually my go to spot for family dinners and last night my family and I went to BJ's after my sisters school event at CSM. I came in with my family around 9pm (7 adults and two kids + nb) we order our food and it took a little longer than usual. Mind you I'm a regular at Bj's. A party of 15 sat down next to us 25 mins after our arrival and they received their food before us. When we finally got our food, 6 out of 7 meals were cold partially warm and my pizza was soggy. Food tasted warmed up from a microwave. This was absolutely disappointing! We immediately got the MOD attention because our waiter was no where to be found and he reassured us that they would have the kitchen re cook all our food in 25 mins. We turned down the offer and he waived the entire bill (duh! Why would I pay for crappy food) and told us we could order any dessert on the menu on the house. MOD ended up getting my 5 year old a fresh plate of spaghetti that was steamy hot. Here's my point is, why did i have to complain to get fresh cooked food? Shouldn't the restaurant serve fresh cooked food regardless?? We ended up eating our pazookies and leaving. MOD Never came back to check on us, i walked out the door with my family and he was standing in the foyer area talking to our waiter and didn't say anything to me or my family. Bj's you disappointed a loyal customer and i hope your other customers aren't treated with lousy service like my family did. I wish i took photos of the crappy food we were served and expected to eat  free pazookies was cool but i didn't come to Bj's to eat free pazookies! My family was expecting a nice fresh meal. It took a lot for me to write this review but last night was terrible!"
Sherry S.,"Visitacion Valley, San Francisco, CA",19,11,10,1.0,10/21/2017,First off I like how they text you once your table is ready. So my boyfriend and daughter order there food first and then 2 minutes after I order mines. The waiter Did notify me about it might come couple minutes after their food which is fine.  But they were done already with their food and my burger still wasn't  out? So then I had to cancel it... we ordered the potato skins. It was so crispy and crunchy (not pose to be like that) and no effort what so ever most of the bacon pieces was on the plate then the potato it self. I order this plenty times and never had it like that and it was disgusting at this place ! Story short we only ate two pieces that's how bad it was and didn't even take it to go and it was a whole entree.
Nidz P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",105,29,17,1.0,11/4/2017,"Went here last week. Wasn't too happy with the service or the wait. We went on a Wednesday and it was still very busy. We were really hungry and it took forever for us to get our food. When we did get our food, it had to be sent back because they brought out a chicken pizza instead of a veggie pizza. They took the pizza back and brought us our veggie pizza after 40 mins. I feel as though the staff here is short handed and they definitely need to hire more employees for a busy place like this. The waitress was over worked and was waiting way too many tables at once so it wasn't her fault that she kept forgetting what we had asked for and mixing up our orders with other tables."
Chad Y.,"Dublin, CA",2,36,39,4.0,11/7/2016,"If you've been to a bj's before you can expect more of the same here. What keeps us coming back? The pizza/pazookie.  Our personal favorite is the bj's favorite which is a nice deep dish with sausage, peppers, onion, tomato, mushrooms, and olives. This location's in particular had a great crust, soft enough for easy chewing but still had a nice crunch!  The pazookies here have always been my favorite simply because they were the first place I ever had one (or even heard of one). The secret strategy is to move the ice cream around so the center of the cookie doesn't get too cold.  They did dim the lights around 8 when we were here for dinner so if your sight is poor in dim lighting be prepared.  Screens abound with varying different games on so this is a great spot for those trying to watch the game. TLDR: this BJ's isn't anything particularly special from other locations, but if you're looking for the standard BJ's experience you won't be disappointed."
Sydney M.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",605,2,,1.0,9/8/2017,"Last night my team and I went to your restaurant for drinks and dinner to watch a football game. We were extremely disappointed with the service.... Our waiter  at the San Mateo location messed up everyone's orders SEVERAL times. It took an hour and forty minutes to get our pizookis after asking many times. BJ's was not busy so I am not sure why everything took so long. Our waiter gave the wrong drinks to people and then suggested we switch them after they had already been drank. Then he gave everyone our bills while still eating dinner because one person in the party asked to pay for his drink so he could leave early. All in all, I have never had worse customer service at a BJ's (or any restaurant) and will not be back."
John R.,"New York, NY",1,7,1,2.0,10/19/2017,The service is incredibly slow here. Get ready for a two hour dinner. Won't come back until they hire more servers.
Leon L.,"Redwood City, CA",8,55,115,4.0,5/30/2017,"Great place to hangout with a large group of friends. The place is quite noisy, so you can have a decent group conversation with your buddies without disturbing other tables.  The fried calamari and Buffalo wings are our favorites. The pizzas are quite good too. For dessert, the pizookie here is the best and the chocolate is my favorite!"
