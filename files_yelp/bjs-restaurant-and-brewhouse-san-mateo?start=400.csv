Katrina L.,"Pleasanton, CA",214,82,84,2.0,1/5/2013,"I went to this BJ's last night for lunch and was not very impressed. We ordered the calamari appetizer and the plate was barely filled.  For my entree I ordered the Scampi Pasta.  It was overall good, but a lot of my noodles were still stuck together as if they were not cooked all the way. The entree portions though were very big. I ordered the lunch size and I was only able to eat 2/3 of it.  I have been to BJ's before for pizookies and loved them! This was my first time going for a meal and I found it very average."
Jay L.,"San Francisco, CA",14,96,9,2.0,4/9/2012,"Food: 2 stars Service: 2 stars This is not the first time I've been to BJ's and normally I love to eat at BJ's. I've always had good experiences. Food and service was always good at the other BJs' I've been to. Until now. The one at Tanforan in San Bruno couldn't seat us all tonight. We had a party of 18. So we opted to come to this BJ's. First time here. The service we had was bad, and it wasn't even packed. There were quite a few booths near us empty. Just because 17% gratuity will automatically be calculated doesn't meant that we should get bad service. Our server was pretty much non-existent. We had to chase people down just to get our water refilled. A friend and I both got the Shrimp Scampi and when it came it was bland. Tasteless. We asked a server if we could get some more of the sauce for the pasta and he didn't get us any. We had to track down another server for that. And all we got was a small dish with tomato sauce. I'm sorry, but since when did scampi have tomato sauce? Then I did the unthinkable. I added salt to my dish.  I will not be returning to this BJ's."
Thomas L.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,23,34,1.0,7/7/2014,"This place is way beyond slow. We came during a slow hour on a Monday and these people still took forever. Slow to take orders, slow to bring out food, super inattentive. It wasn't even because they were short-staffed. One of the waiters was busy hollerin' at his coworkers. It was generally a negative experience. The BJs in SoCal seem to be managed much more effectively."
Drake R.,"Foster City, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/10/2015,I tried to simply call in and reserve a table and was immediately hung up on by LEON after 5 seconds. I then called back to place an order for pick up only to be rudely hung up on a second time by none other than LEON. Get an affable employee to answer the phone.
Kevin S.,"Plano, TX",28,825,2,5.0,9/19/2010,"Came to town to watch the Red Sox play the Giants back in June.  Don't know how I missed writing the review....anyways, here goes. A friend flew in from Houston, and he had a late flight, plus I wasn't leaving the Sacramento area until 6-7 pm, so I knew it would be late.  Traffic and plane delays made it about 11:45 pm before we both got to the hotel.  Not much open in the Foster City area on a Thursday night after 11 pm. Except BJ's.  We were very happy to walk in and find them still open....or so we thought.  The waitress at the door said they just stopped serving. As we were just about to leave, we asked if the bar was still open.  ""Oh yeah, but they have limited food.""  So what!  Food is food and beer is beer.  LOL Had the large combo pizza and a couple of sodas....yeah, I know I said beer, but we were both pretty tired.  So no beer. Took the pizza back to the hotel and had the leftovers for breakfast.  Good thing there was a microwave there! If you're going to come to this BJ's...make sure it's before 11:30 pm if you want the full menu and a ""seat in the resturant"".  Otherwise, the great staff at the bar will help! Parking was easy.  Prices were reasonable."
Norman S.,"San Jose, CA",73,402,445,3.0,12/30/2011,"3 stars for BJ's sounds about right so that's what I'm giving them as well. The collective intelligence works again.  Was there for lunch just before Christmas on a weekday and it was relatively packed with worker bees from the nearby offices. We had a reservation so getting to our table was quick. We ordered an appetizer sampler and the standard calamari and both turned our alright but nothing mind-blowing. Looking at the menu for lunch, the calories are out of control. Most are over 1000 calories so if you're on a diet, watch out! I went with the Creole Tilapia weighing at just over 500 calories. It tasted good but nothing special, in line with the likes of TGI Fridays, Chili's, etc. Still, it's a decent place to go for lunch/dinner/drinks with colleagues and friends."
Varun V.,"Castro Valley, CA",14,98,5,2.0,7/15/2014,"In spite of having a reservation, we had to wait for an additional hour. The food was average and the service was similar."
Maria D.,"San Jose, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/31/2015,"I will never go back. Horrible service, waitress did not come to table once. Busboy dropped off food, wrong food plates. Waitress-Sierra-showed up an hour after we sat down to deliver check. Manager new and incompetent. Hostess-Iona-not helpful, playing around with other employees. Complained to corporate offices. Highly recommend trying other restaurant, stay away from here, nonexistent service."
Derrick C.,"Sacramento, CA",97,1246,126,4.0,4/6/2010,"In my opinion, BJ's is the best when it comes to these American chain restaurants.  It took a while for them to expand up to NorCal but I have always always always been a fan of their deep dish pizzas, wide selection of beers, and overall vibe.  It's the little things that such as the way they have pairings of their beer and their foods or their reserved parking spots for take-out customers. The FC location is stocked with tons of TV screens so you can catch whatever game is on live.  Happy hour deals include half off mini-pizzas, $2 off all appetizers, and $1 off all drinks."
Kiran J.,"San Francisco, CA",94,163,7,3.0,8/7/2014,"BJ's will always be consistent. Nothing fresh or artisanal, but worth going back to a place you know will always have good beer and ok food."
Analyst C.,"San Mateo, CA",9,248,458,3.0,9/14/2013,I'm a regular at BJ's.  Different kind of food to order and service has been good and fast.
Thanh T.,"Hayward, CA",172,167,,2.0,10/15/2012,"Went here for happy hour with a couple friends. Service was what costed them, cocktails were unremarkable and seemed water down. We waited quite awhile for our food and drinks and had to mention it to the waitress.. Granted it was a weekday but consistency is what keeps the customers coming."
David W.,"Cornelius, NC",5,27,,1.0,10/9/2012,"Oh BJs, why do you disappoint me so? I must like the pain because I keep going and will continue to do so for a couple staff members and the beer but, at the same time have to warn people of something. Stay the F away from the Chicken Terriyaki!  It's kinda my favorite go to on the lunch menu but has come out totally mangled 5 of the last 6 times I've ordered it. To the point the bartender jokes ""are you really sure you want to try that again?"" Today was the final straw. It was burnt beyond eating. Even the non burnt pieces tasted like charcoal. 3 bites is all I got for lunch. What changed after 5 times to make me write a yelp review? Two things -  1) That would be Mike the manager who did not offer to refund it (I was in a hurry and paid before it showed up) or even try and get the kitchen to get me something else real quick to go. Instead he just awkwardly said he'd let the kitchen know and disappeared without another word. Great, thanks. 2) You can't submit feedback on their website. It gives an error telling me I'm dumb and can't get a captcha right. Whatever...."
Emily M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/12/2014,"This was my first time visiting a BJ's. The menu looked awesome, but the service was really bad. I usually roll my eyes when Yelp reviewers place a big emphasis on service at restaurants. My general philosophy is that if the food's good, service isn't that important. This place turned out to be the exception.  The restaurant was dead (we came well before the dinner rush), but the hostess took quite a bit of time to seat us. And she looked very confused and utterly terrified of people. I assumed it was her first day. Not a big deal, I know what it's like to be new at a food service job.  My boyfriend and I split the avocado egg rolls (amazing!). I ordered a Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad with dressing on the side, and my boyfriend ordered a medium bone-in New York steak.  My salad was served with the dressing mixed in. Meh, kind of a bummer, but again, not TOO huge a deal. I rarely send food back, so I just ate the salad. It was OK.  But then my boyfriend started eating his steak. It was rarer than rare - probably the least-cooked steak I have ever laid eyes on. Again, he ordered it medium.  We asked the waitress (kindly) if she could take the steak back so it could be cooked a bit longer. She asked us if we wanted the same steak cooked longer, or a new steak. We let her know we were fine with the same steak, and she took it back without another word.   Not once did the waitress apologize. Again, sometimes steak gets undercooked. It happens. But when it does, the very least the server can do is say a quick sorry.  Maybe we came at a really weird time or something, when they happened to be training all their staff at once? There's just too many great independent restaurants around here to bother going back here if it's going to be a mess."
Navid P.,"San Jose, CA",4,6,,4.0,9/10/2014,This is by far the best BJ's I have been too. The few others I have been to in the south bay really lack service. I came here today to meet an old friend for lunch. I love their chips n salsa. The pizza was delicious as well (I love their crust) .  And of course I had to have the pizooki.
Courtney M.,"Tualatin, OR",122,57,11,4.0,6/5/2014,"The location leaves a lot to be desired, but if you an look past that, its not too shabby of a brew house."
Andrew M.,"San Carlos, CA",112,65,3,5.0,6/16/2012,"Compared to Cheesecake Factory for an overall experience, BJ's takes the proverbial ""cake"". While its list of desserts pales in comparison to its competitor with just as extensive a menu (if not more so), the food is comparable and the service tends to be better and more consistent. One of things I do notice when I go to these restaurants is how they take care of the kids in our party. Time and time again, TCF sends food out from the kitchen for the kids that is incredibly hot and on scalding plates. Every time we've been to BJs, they seem to be much more on top of the concept that the little ones shouldn't be given scalding food.  This trip I had the 8oz sirloin with a bowl of tortilla soup and one of their giant baked potatoes.  Everything was cooked right and tasted good. The wifey had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, a dish she regularly gets and enjoys. The boy got a Mac n Cheese appetizer which I tried and was quite good. Em, the 3 year old had chicken strips and fries off the kids menu that she thoroughly enjoyed.  Of course a trip to BJs isn't complete without their signature Pizooki, a freshly baked chocolate cookie topped with ice cream. Of course the boy jumped all over that while the little one decided on a kids Ice cream sundae.  Even though my meal totaled a whopping 850 calories, I chose to pass on desert.  Once again, props to BJs staff for being prompt, attentive, and cognizant of the nuances that accompany serving a family meal."
Brian J.,"Belmont, CA",3,4,,2.0,9/7/2014,"Food was great, service... Not so much. Brought incorrect drinks twice. Water would sit empty for 10+ minutes. Asked for dessert 5 separate times by waitress after saying no each time."
Miss L.,"Dublin, CA",491,121,2182,2.0,3/19/2012,"Do not get the Ahi Apetizer , I had food poisoning last night! The Ahi tasted a bit akward, it  was  bit warm. I did like the service though. The waitress was nice, but my stomach doesn't feel too good......."
yin t.,"San Mateo, CA",137,85,140,3.0,8/24/2012,"The review  is base on lunch delivery through  .  I keep this on rotation since the guys like the pizza, burgers and sandwiches.  I stick to the entree salads."
