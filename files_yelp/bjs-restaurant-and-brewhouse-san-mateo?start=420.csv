Bradley W.,"Pleasanton, CA",453,81,51,3.0,8/24/2012,"It's a corporate brewhouse, fun to meet and hang with friends for a drink and some bites, but nothing really spectacular.  Sometimes the service is good and sometimes it takes awhile but okay either way."
Jess W.,"San Francisco, CA",66,554,528,3.0,7/10/2010,"I guess I can't be too opinionated since I did come in a group of 28.  They  messed up on 2 orders. That's not too bad, right? Mine came last. It was cold. I guess it was sitting in the kitchen. I just got meat loaf. It was okay.  I really like the grilled cheese. But then again, I love cheese in general. The prices I guess are decent for a place like this."
Kayla S.,"San Mateo, CA",4,67,76,3.0,11/16/2013,"BJ's is my go to choice for American food in foster city. They have a pretty good happy hour for late night appetizers and drinks. My favorites are the fried artichoke hearts, tomato bisque, pepperoni deep dish pizza, and always a classic pizookie. My issue with BJ's is that the service is very inconsistent. I'm a returning patron here and I walk in expecting bad service but good food. This is definitely my first spot to go to when the Olympics are on because they have tvs everywhere!"
Phil S.,"Monterey, CA",13,11,5,5.0,2/19/2014,Get Nicole as your server. She's great and has a lot of insight on the food to offer! She'll make you giggle like never before!
John L.,"San Francisco, CA",319,161,1345,3.0,8/4/2009,"Went here for my boss's bday lunch.  We had a large group but we made reservations in advance so when we arrived the staff was already waiting.  We were promptly seated and our waitress took our drink order.  I went for the Piranha Pale Ale, it was nice and cold, hoppy with slight bitterness.  For my entree I ordered the fresh atlantic salmon from their lunch menu.  It's a lunch size portion of salmon that can either be flame-broiled or blackened.  I went with the blackened and it included a rice pilaf, seasoned steamed vegetables, and side of tartar sauce. I also opted for a caesar salad side.  The salmon was definitely lunch-size portion as it seemed a little small, it was also a little dry. ( ) For the birthday celebrant, our waitress brought out a complimentary signature pizookie. It's a freshly baked chocolate chunk cookie (other cookie options are white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal raisin) topped with vanilla bean ice cream. ( ). I was lucky enough to get a bite and it was delicious, you can't go wrong with a warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream. Overall the service was good but the food was OK. Great for large parties with a decent crafted beer selection."
Greg M.,"Foster City, CA",27,102,32,4.0,5/23/2012,"Lately, since MIMI's change of Ownership, and Food Taste has gone down hill, we've been coming to BJs.   Since its just my Jen and I, we almost always are seated in less than 5 minutes.   Servers are attentive and first class.   Its more of a Team Effort so you might see several different faces involved with your food.     Spoors TVs are going nonstop and the ambiance is Lower Light than average like I like it.   Not at all like IHOP on Foster City Blvd where its so Bright you were thin you were being interrogated. I have eaten the Steak Salad on numerous occasions which is very tasty.   Their Hamburgers are the BEST near the Foster City Area as Turtle Bay lost their lease and closed.    They also offer a choice between your std size fries or the thin cut. Their Specials are pretty good and Calamari App is about a B when compared to Ketch Joannes at Pillar Point Harbor or that Restaurant in Davenport that also functions as a Bakery and Rest Stop for your Traveling Motorcycle groups. Their Margaritas and Strawberry Daiquiris are also tastily mine with Whip Cream but on the Pricey side at $9.95.   We noticed that none of the Cocktails had prices on em because they are pricey, but delicious and worth the splurge once in a while. Sometimes the Specials include various fish dishes which are good, but I much prefer the Fish Market Before 6PM Specials with Roasted Vegetables and a little better Calamari due to the  batter being a bit lighter and tastier.  There thin crust pizzas are also delicious."
Elizabeth M.,"San Mateo, CA",2,4,,2.0,7/23/2015,my friend flew in from San Francisco to come to BJs. when we arrived we received a horrible table. then the power went out. we sat in the darkness. then we left and the power went back on. we had to wait for a table and have waited for a long time for our food. I am very disappointed in you bjs.
Marc D.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,7,1,2.0,9/18/2014,"Just got the deep dish ""pepperoni extreme"" pizza. Can't speak to any in-store service as I did curbside, but the pizza itself tastes like a cross between Domino's and Pizza Hut deep dish, at twice the price. Not many options around here for deep dish, but if you're in the mood, your time and money are better spent at Patxi's, or I have heard good things about Blue Line."
Caroline K.,"Hayward, CA",174,189,103,2.0,6/2/2012,"Came here for lunch not too long ago and sat at the bar since I was by myself, and there was an open spot.  Ordered a lunch special mini deep dish + side salad. The pizza was great, just like any other BJ's.  The crust is not as crispy as some deep dish pizzas, which can be good or bad depending on your taste.  I happen to like pretty much all kinds of pizza crusts, so I'm fine with either.  But in case you haven't been to a BJ's before, that's the scoop. The salad.  Ooookay, so my server listed the options for side salads and I decided to go with the special watermelon & feta.  It came, and boy was it gross.  I am normally very open to mixing sweet and salty but the feta and watermelon did not go well together.  Either that or the dressing was wrong or had gone bad, but something tasted yucky.  I tried to eat the components separately to minimize the mixing of watermelon + feta in weird dressing.  What happened here, taste-testers?? The service definitely could have been better.  Yes, I came at the end of a busy lunch rush, but it seemed like everything kind of took awhile.  I guess I was hoping for a quick lunch experience, but it's hard when there are like 200 tech people who work nearby also hoping for the same! Then, my server suggested I try a mini pizookie, so that I could have just a taste without the crazy huge serving of a normal sized one (which should be shared, for sure!).  So I picked the red velvet one, with white chocolate cream cheese chunks.  Sounded amazing.  I get my pizookie, however, and it is raw inside.  Like they had stuck it in the oven for 5 minutes to get a crust-looking top, pulled it out, and served it.  I couldn't find my server anywhere, so I sat there for several minutes waiting for her to come back.  When she checked on me, I told her it was raw.  She graciously brought another one with no complaints, but of course it had to cook for another 15 min or whatever.  So that added to my annoyance about how long everything was taking...not HER fault, but the kitchen's fault, really.  So anyway, I finally get the cooked one and it is good.  It's really ridiculously sweet though, maybe it was the chocolate chips, but geez.  It's hard to finish.  I think that's kinda true of all their pizookies though.  The mini size was great though, it was still even bigger than I'd expected.  And I didn't have to feel quite as guilty. ;) Anyway, it is not my favorite BJs.  They need to step it up quite a bit to rival most of the other BJs I've been to (La Jolla, Westwood, Laguna Beach, even Tanforan).  If you've never been to a BJs before, don't pick this one as your first stop."
Steve T.,"Eugene, OR",163,14,6,1.0,9/11/2013,"Last night (9/10/13) is absolutely THE LAST TIME I EVER come to this restaurant. Waited 10-15 min without anyone stopping at our table. Made eye contact with the waitress serving our section and she never once stopped to say ""I'll be right back to take your order!"" I'm disappointed at this place 75% of the time. So, BJs, best of luck to you. You will never have my business again, nor my recommendation!!"
Joshua D.,"Palo Alto, CA",14,18,,2.0,12/24/2013,"Company dinner for Christmas, not impressed at all. Service sucked, food sucked, beer was good. Not going back. 2 stars for beer!!"
Akin B.,"Santa Clara, CA",12,114,56,4.0,10/22/2013,"I love coming here with friends or when there is Monday night football.  Food is good, service is decent, and the environment is a sports lover's dream.  Only big negative is the place gets too crowded because everyone likes coming here.  Come early or wait a very long time."
David P.,"San Mateo, CA",7,1,,1.0,10/26/2013,This is the 1st time I have written a review  period . Today I waited at Bj with a party of five for 40 minutes  watching other people with the same amount of people in their party pass us by. The order came to the table cold . My five year old waited for his Mac and cheese and it came cold. I had to inform the assistant manager who was useless in this whole experience .  I would not recommend this place to any of my friends
Jennifer C.,"San Mateo, CA",113,15,20,1.0,5/26/2014,I used curbside service which was fine. But when I opened my salad there was a papertowel piece in the salad...wth! I was starving too! Never again!
Christine D.,"San Bruno, CA",102,331,241,3.0,10/18/2013,"If you work in or around Foster City, BJ's is one of those safe overall ok places to have lunch...especially if you have picky coworkers.  There's something for everyone so it just makes it easy and convenient.  The service at this particular location is pretty good.  I've eaten here time and time again and have never received bad service.  Some of my favorites are of course their pizookie, the all you can eat soup and salad, and avocado egg rolls."
Karla P.,"San Mateo, CA",63,19,1,5.0,6/11/2014,My family and I come here all the time to have some snacks or pizza and by the way we recommend flat pizza is awesome we always get good service from bartenders as well as servers good happy hour. Definitely will come back!
Chris C.,"Mountain View, CA",74,29,76,5.0,1/22/2012,"Why 5 stars? It's what you want in a mainstream ""brewery"", complete with every type of food you could want. The appetizers are great, the lunch specials are killer, and the huge selection of brews + full bar has everything you want. It is what it is, and they execute their business model perfectly. The BEST food? Nowhere near fine dining, but it is what I expect. Everytime you pull into a mall, strip mall, or see a BJ's you know you're gunna have a great meal with no surprises."
Sonnia K.,"Berkeley, CA",341,626,1242,4.0,5/5/2010,"After biking the Coyote Point Trail, my Meetup Group and I went here for late lunch. I love their New Orleans style Jambalaya! (I'm a Jambalayaholic!) We combined three high-chaired tables and the service we got was great. We were taken care of real well. I'm sure I'd be going back here for another Jambalaya session after a great bike ride. You should join us!"
Edward Y.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Went for lunch today.  Should have expected what happened when our server was not as friendly as others on our other visits.  Service was slow.  My own food was tepid since I believe it was sitting in kitchen waiting for our other orders to be ready.  Two if our 3 main course came out extremely late.  All server said was manager will talk to us about the serious delay.  All manager said was ""here's your order.  Thank you for waiting"". No apology.  Extremely disappointing.  U guess will not be going back"
Rachel B.,"San Bruno, CA",86,86,2,3.0,12/5/2011,Pizookie all the way!  Pizza is ok too and wait times not as bad as the one in San Bruno. Good place to stop after shopping in the area.
