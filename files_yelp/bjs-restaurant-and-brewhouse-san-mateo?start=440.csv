Clara P.,"San Mateo, CA",2,14,,3.0,5/29/2014,"This was my first time here,  let me start by saying that the service was excellent I went there with the two children I nanny for 7 & 9  I'd say it was kid friendly even though it was very busy with lots of people but our server was very attentive to them and me that's always a plus for me as we dine out occasionally.  My dinner pasta with broccoli and chicken was good except chicken was dry....The dessert was very good would come back for that"
The M.,"San Francisco, CA",28,59,159,4.0,7/8/2013,"I like BJ's - the service is always very warm. Please dont go looking for healthy food option , BJ's is a place to hit when you are in mood for some not so healthy fried food. I love their finger food - be it fried mozzarella stick , buttoned mushrooms or the avocado roll. To think of it, I have never really had the main course at BJ's ..just finger food."
Stella Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",819,704,512,4.0,6/10/2011,"This place is a bit pricy but who cares when you can engorge yourself into a round, thick plate of deep crust goodness? I got to try a couple of the appetizers (crispy fried artichoke and spinach stuffed mushroom) but it wasn't much compared to their pizza! I got the BJ's favorite pizza aka, the one with the works! And baby, it worked. It was served in an iron plate making the pizza even more sizzling and hot right at your table. With its oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes, it was definitely worth the 25 minute wait for. Oh, did I mention the soft, buttery crust? I also had it with the pomegranate margarita and good company. A tall glass, very fruity, but also $10!! For that much, it could be a little bit stronger but it balanced out the meal pretty well.  I wish I had room for dessert, especially their pizzooki but I think that's enough calories for one day! I would say it's a place for a nice occasion with a very chill atmosphere. Yeah, I did stay for 4 hours. Couldn't move after all that food! Next time.. pizza buffet? I think so."
Karyn L.,"Milpitas, CA",118,138,152,2.0,3/24/2014,"It's hit or miss sometimes.  Pizzas and drinks are great.  I can't say the same for customer service (the people look miserable sometimes?).  I came here for lunch oneday and the waiter looked so angry - he was annoyed we didn't have table settings, annoyed we asked for sauce and looked so irritated that he had to pour chicken tortilla soup into my bowl.  No longer one of my first choice of places to eat, and this past experience will not have me coming back to spend money again."
Jennine M.,"Lansdale, PA",41,3,,4.0,8/12/2014,"Came in after a long flight from Philly. The staff was really friendly and service was fairly quick. They have a large beer menu, many of which are brewed onsite. I had 2 beers there and both were delicious. We had the avocado spring rolls, which were excellent, and I had the mozzarella tomato salad with a half chicken pesto sandwich. All the food was great. The menu is huge so I look forward to going back before we leave San Mateo."
Jojo L.,"San Mateo, CA",398,70,68,1.0,9/1/2013,"On the whole, BJ's offers pretty consistent food.  I've enjoy their deep dish pizzas and happy hour beer selection a handful of times.  However this review reflects the customer service at this location (which as you can tell by my one star rating is abysmal).  I came here on a Friday evening with my family so I totally understand that Friday nights are a busy time. We did call ahead around 6:45 pm to see how long the wait was going to be and they said about 20 mins.  so We arrive around 7:10 and they hand us the beeper and again reassure us, its going to be about a 20 minute wait.  Around 30 mins in we ask if our tables almost ready and the response we get is ""Almost, we are trying to find some chairs"".   How on earth can a restaurant not have enough chairs!  We wait for another 10 minutes so 40 minutes total!  Not so happy when I'm hangry and people lie to me.  We're finally seated and it takes the waitress for ever to come by and get our drink order.  Poor girl is running around everywhere.  We put in our order (a large pizza- half spicy meatball/ half Mediterranean chicken, the appetizer party platter, a Moroccan salmon and clam chowder bread bowl).  The appetizer platter comes out pretty fast but there's no plates.... the waiter told us he was ""trying to find some"".  Ok, again BJ's was packed, I get that, BUT shouldn't the management anticipate that and kinda figure out a way to have enough plates on hand/ rewashed so that they can keep up with their capacity? I guess not bc they're short of everything at this place!! We're so hungry at this point, we just start digging into the dips and mozzarella sticks since its all finger food anyways.  Next my dad's chowder arrives but its in a BOWL not a bread bowl like we order so they have to swap it out for us. Seriously? how many things can go wrong in a given night? Luckily, the chowder was pretty delicious so it was worth it to wait.  The rest of the food arrived pretty soon after that.  The toppings on the pizza were kinda all over the the place, you could tell that the kitchen staff was in such a rush bc the the toppings from the med. chicken and spicy meatball over lapped a lot. whatever, it all ends up in your stomach, right?  The salmon was meh, would not order it again. FOOD: 3.5 stars SERVICE: .5 star ATMOSPHERE: 3 stars So, I'm not ruling BJ's out in the future completely (late night pizzokies may have something to do with another visit), I would just avoid it like the plague if I had to come during the weekends because obviously they can't deliver proper service if it's at full capacity."
Lou G.,"Palo Alto, CA",56,53,15,2.0,6/5/2011,"I ate possibly the worst pizza of all times. Extremely undercooked, doughy, clumpy cheese, piece of trash of a pizza.  I ordered a large cheese pizza for pick up. When I got there I was greeted by a friendly host at the pick up station who offered me a drink while I waited. That was the best part. When the pizza came I paid and hurried to the car. I put my pizza in the passenger seat, strapped the seat belt on it and rushed home. When I opened the box I was shocked to see this pitiful looking attempt at a cheese pizza. Where did it all go wrong? Note to Management: You might want to have your oven temperatures calibrated every so often. Will I go back? To this location.... Hell Naw."
Rochelle S.,"Tampa, FL",1,69,,3.0,8/9/2014,"I'm not normally fond of chain restaurants, but came over for dinner with some co-workers and found that the food wasn't all too bad.  I ordered a sandwich with a request to make some changes to its content and was quite pleased with the results. Not only did they have any problem with my request, but made it for me exactly as I had hoped.  My coworkers got a number of the appetizers and soups and they all came with a very nice plate display and were well received as there wasn't much left besides crumbs. The only thing was the slow service. It wasn't very busy but it still took 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. If I'm in a pinch, I would return and know the food will be good."
Jon K.,"Bay Area, CA",0,8,1,2.0,11/8/2012,"Good place, bad service.  I've dined at BJ's numerous times and I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere, convenient hours, beer selection and variety on the menu.  But i must say that the food is average, except the pizookie is a gift from God. The one thing that ruffles my feathers each time I have an experience is the terribly slow service.  The waiters/waitresses mean well but always seem to go 'on break' for way more then 10 minutes and the temporary server forgets about our table.   If the management team had any clue about customer service I think it would not only help customer satisfaction out but I'm sure the restaurant would be making more as well."
David E.,"Danville, CA",1,15,,3.0,8/7/2014,Its A-Ok.  Been there for lunch a bunch of times.  The service has good and bad moments. The food is as you would expect for $9 bucks.  The beers on tap are good and they have a nice selection.
Christina L.,"Belmont, CA",0,11,2,3.0,11/3/2012,"Disappointed again.  3 out of 4 meals to the table were cold.  Cold fries are no good!  They we're busy, however, this is not the first time we have been disappointed. Slow service."
Honest F.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,105,1,2.0,8/25/2012,"Service at this location is awful!!!   3 of my 4 visits to this location has been AWFUL!  Today they sat us quickly, 15 minutes after being seated...no server...no drink order...finally flagged down a manager who instructed another waiter to wait on our table.  The kid was awesome!  Took very good care of us and if this location hired more kids like the Asian kid who waited on us they would get a way better review.  The server was SO SLOW the family behind us had to find someone else to get their condiments and later their refills..."
Monica T.,"Hayward, CA",0,38,1,1.0,8/24/2012,"What a HORRIBLE experience. I came here after a long day at work and just wanted to eat a nice dinner and have a pizookie.  The hostess said there was not a wait for seating outside so, being tired and hungry my boyfriend and I decided to go with that. We waited a couple minutes and were seated. The waitress came by and took our order for drinks. She didn't even know what drink my boyfriend wanted and had to look at the menu. A couple minutes later we ordered our entreés. I asked Ye waitress if I was able to add meatballs to one of the pasta dishes and she didn't know and referred me to the appetizer section to order them from there as a side-they were not an option. I just went a head and order Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs added. Wile we were waiting, these guys (who were rude and obnoxious) decided it was okay to take their beers and pull out reserved chairs and sit blocking the exit doors to have their own loud mingle session. Seeing that I was already a little annoyed, this shot my entire mood down. One guy took out a cigarette and smoked right by everyone else why they were eating next to a 'no smoking allowed' sign. Now, you might be wondering what his has to do with their service. The staff did not do anything about it and seemed to let it go. The manager even had a little pow wow with them. Seriously, people around me were staring at these guys and the staff didn't care.  After waiting for our food and having to sit next to the annoying guys, our food comes. I noticed that my plate didn't even have meatballs. I nicely told the waitress and she replied that she didn't know what to do. She told the same manager that chit chatting with the guys and simply replies 'oh well get her some'. By the time they get to me, I was already more than half way done and told my waitress that I didn't want them anymore and asked for the check. The food was not warm and they didn't give my boyfriend a steak knife with his steak. The poor family next to us who were seated before us didn't even get served after we received our food. They even complained to the manager as well. I didn't even get my pizookie ): Save your money and time elsewhere and get good service like a paying costumer should."
Annie D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",353,740,191,3.0,6/8/2011,"We're almost always here on Tuesdays after my bf's softball team is down with their games, so we're here pretty late, 9 or 10PM.   There will be a group or 10 or so every time we come and I'm not quite sure why it takes them so long to set up tables when during this time... it's pretty slow.  So 15 mins later, almost every time.. our servers have been pretty good with taking our orders. So besides the normal pizza that I would normally get at any other BJ'S, I thought of trying out some other new healthier items since it's so late in the night to be eating.  I've tried Creole Tilapia-Oven roasted tilapia topped with a tomato olive tapenade and served with rice pilaf, baby greens tossed in our balsamic vinaigrette and topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes- this dish is quite tasty, I would order this again.  Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta- Rotini noodles tossed with roasted vegetables, sun-dried tomatoes, capers and Kalamata olives mixed with a light vegetable broth and topped with pine nuts, fresh basil, Parmesan cheese and parsley.- this was almost like a pasta salad. Wasn't so bad. Good alternative to regular pasta.  Mini Tacos-Two mini corn tortillas filled with spicy, tender barbacoa beef or fajita marinated chicken breast, topped with cabbage, baja sauce and pico de gallo.  Served with a tangy slaw of shredded cabbage and pickled carrots- this was average, nothing special.  Seared Ahi- Sliced sashimi grade ahi served with Asian slaw, wasabi and soy ginger sauce for dipping- this had a odd taste to it and wasn't good, don't get this dish! Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad-Our new light and fresh Caprese-style salad! Fresh mozzarella and tomato wedges with basil, red onion and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze- very simple and fresh salad.  Gourmet Mac & Cheese- A delicious and creamy blend of rotelle pasta with three cheeses, chipotle and a hint of garlic. Topped with seasoned breadcrumbs and bacon then oven-baked for a golden brown finish- they got this mac right! Piranha® Pale Ale Nachos- Crisp corn tortilla chips over chili made with BJ's Piranha® Pale Ale and topped with jack and cheddar cheeses, diced tomatoes, green onions, sliced olives and sour cream- this dish sounded good, but when it came out, the cheese was hard and stuck to the chip, so any chip without cheese wasn't going to get any. The chili was in the middle on the bottom of the dish, like maybe a spoon full? Yeah, I returned the dish.  Chicken Wings-More than a pound of crisp, tender chicken wings, drizzled with hot and spicy buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Served with celery sticks, extra sauce and dressing for dipping- wings are always good. Beer- Great.  Overall, it's a good place to hang out, have some beers and most of the items on the menu isn't out to disappoint, but I would choose this place to come wine and dine."
Ben L.,"Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/29/2013,"I went there with my family last night. My order was thin crust veggie pizza with two extras: artichoke hearts and pineapple. After 40 minutes, I got a thick crust 'veggie' pizza but with anchovies and pineapple. Sent it back. 20 minutes later, I got a thin crust veggie pizza with the pineapple but no artichoke hearts. Complained to the waitress and she brought out a little bowl of artichoke hearts. Cold. To go with my pizza. When they should've been baked in... This is my second bad experience here. Shame on me for giving them a second chance. Never again, BJ's, you live up to your name - you blow."
Jacqueline Is Nuts C.,"Burlingame, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/7/2013,"BJ's Foster City tends to be a bit pricey for it's grill type restaurant, but the service is pretty good & the food isn't too shabby either. I've lucked out w/fairly good service as some of the reviewers here have had bad experiences. It helps to go on a slowday....I can see how going on a busy day would result in lower service needs.  On the positive....the appetizers & deserts alone make this place worth frequenting. Not to mention they have a sports bar with huge televisions for watching the games or just hanging out with your friends.  Parking is decent & they have a special section for ordering take out....you don't need to get out of your car!"
Jamie T.,"San Francisco, CA",264,408,52,3.0,7/15/2011,Happy Hour specials! I don't really like the pizza but the flatbread pizza looked good. I think the nachos needed more sauce - more flavor. The wings were amazing though. We had the beer sampler. Fun for a weekday happy hour. Also had my first pizookie! I'm not that big of a pizookie fan...sorry to disappoint - I can see how it is amazing but its still not an eye-opener for me...
Isabelle B.,"Foster City, CA",10,32,,3.0,11/14/2012,"While we love the food and the ambiance, the service has been really bad lately.  The last several times we've been there, it's taken us about 2 hours to eat - not because we're lingering, but because it just took that long.  We've had a few mishaps with our servers, including one that put one bowl of tortilla soup inside the other and served it to us like that - and didn't think anything was wrong with the fact that the bottom of one bowl was put inside our food. The beer is good and the food is pretty good as well.  The pizzookie dessert (warm cookies with ice cream on top) is awesome. The bar area has several TVs - always a good place to catch a sporting event.  If you have the time, I recommend BJ's - but definitely not a good place to go when you're in a hurry."
Richard G.,"Redwood City, CA",1,49,13,2.0,12/23/2013,"Remarkably slow, no apology. Took over an hour for my underdressed salad. Waiter no where to be found. Whole experience left something to be desired. Only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is, what the hell did I expect??"
Cat C.,"San Francisco, CA",1733,1578,2823,2.0,4/9/2009,"It's a shame because I like their sandwiches, appetizers and pizzas, and they have decent drinks but they have such lousy service and the wait for a table and wait for food can be awhile.  BJ's in my opinion is a nicer version (in terms of looks and food) of Fridays, but Friday's always had better service!   On my most recent visit, a couple friends and I came to nibble on some appetizers and dessert on a Monday night, so it wasn't too busy.  Right when we were seated I noticed my seat was still kinda dirty with some salad on the edge of the seat and none of the spare chairs along the side were clean either.  Our waitress didn't give us our napkins and utensils til after we finished our greasy nachos..so we had to lick our fingers clean...ghetto I know!  -3 for lousy service, long waits, & for being overpriced.  +2 for some tasty food though."
