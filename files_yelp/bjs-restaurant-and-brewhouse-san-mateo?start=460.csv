Ginger M.,"Raleigh, NC",175,35,4,5.0,7/10/2011,"Love this place! We stumbled across this restaurant yesterday 'mid day', where we knew we needed to eat, but still had a few errands to run, so we decided bar food was appropriate. Immediately seated on a Saturday afternoon around 2 in the bar area.  The place is nice and dark, dark wood all around, and very cool.  Giant TV screens, what a perfect place to watch any game.  Server came around quickly for our drinks and she was extremely pleasant and bubbly. I ordered the seasonal Wit (refreshing, maybe could have used a bit more citrus), partner ordered a brewnette.  Happy and satisfied. We went with a bunch to share, spinach stuffed mushrooms, mini tacos and deep dish pizza.  Everything was so good, the mushrooms weren't too soggy and had just enough cheese, the deep dish pizza was served piping hot and had the perfect crunchy-chewy texture.  The mini tacos were ok, a little cool on delivery but the spices in the chicken were very good.  I'd suggest serving these with more of a warm sauce than the reg salsa. Great experience!  We will be back on game days!!"
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1464,987,1073,4.0,12/4/2011,"Looks like they had a new pizza on their menu, and that's what I got... the portobello mushroom pizza.  I love when the crust is baked and there's extra cheese (or tastes like cheese at least) on the bottom and it gets crispy and crunchy and it's not only bread you're tasting.  Wonderful!  The mushrooms were really the best part....... could have eaten the whole mini but if I had the last slice I'd be too full for anything else later, and it would not be worth it...... so I felt kind of bad asking for a box for one slice but I really didn't want to force it.   I also think it's weird when people order food (like a burger) but they don't eat hardly any of it... or just eat the fries...and take the burger home (two people did that).  The best parts of burgers are when the meat is not over cooked, when the bun is crispy and fluffy, and when there is plenty of ketchup and mustard and oh (!) they happened to add bleu cheese and other stuff in it, but they didn't eat it, wow.  Really, it tastes better hot!!!"
D G.,"San Jose, CA",1,32,,4.0,12/26/2013,"This a place for my occasional get together with former coworkers. They seem to be always busy/popular and the mood is festive. Personally, I like their hefeweizen, ""BJ's Favorite"" deep dish pizza (if you like spicy, ask them to add jalapenos on top before baking) and avocado rolls are just great! You have to be prepared for slow service during lunch though..."
Tracy E.,"Orlando, FL",0,14,,5.0,7/6/2014,"Love this place! Fun atmosphere and they have a very large menu.  You have to have a pizookie, sooo yummy.  This is our go to place for hanging out with friends and the outdoor seating is great."
Ashley C.,"San Mateo, CA",102,166,42,2.0,5/20/2011,"This was the 3rd time we had dinner at BJ's within the last 6 weeks.  Tonight takes the cake!   Our server first off took several minutes to acknowledge us....maybe it was the back area as each time we've eaten there we always get seated in the back area. Dinner came out in a reasonable time but not all together.  Then when the server (jason) came to clear out some of our plates, we told him that we weren't finished with the appetizers and that it was ok to consolidate them, what surprised us was that he used his fingers to transfer the food from one plate to another instead of using a utensil.  Shocked all of us that he did that. He then proceeded to ask if we wanted to order a dessert ably and we told him that we'd probably order a pizzookie once we finished.  To our surprise it show up in the middle of our dinner.  Imagine ice cream melting while you are finishing your meal. To top it off....the dessert had a piece of plastic mixed in with the cookie. We asked to speak to the manager and it took him several minutes to finally approach us.  Though he apologized and took the items off, it appeared that this was definitely an off night. Not impressed with the service nor the food.  Unfortunately....the third time was in NOT the charm for this place. Very disappointed!"
Steph U.,"Chicago, IL",817,473,264,3.0,7/18/2013,"Good beers and good summer mojitos! I sat at the bar and the bartenders were fun and offered great suggestions. I don't normally like to come here just to eat regular meals, just because I feel like the portions are way too large and the food is just okay, but their appetizers are good and this is always a good option for larger groups of people like birthday parties."
Valeria S.,"Cupertino, CA",46,85,14,2.0,6/13/2013,"Sadly, this BJ's is kind of crappy compared to the one in Cupertino. It seems like the last couple times my boyfriend and I have come here it just so happens to be a graduation (didn't realize they started from like early/mid may!) so it's SUPER busy 10 minutes after we are seated & getting our waitresses to pay attention to us is SUCH a hassle and last time my boyfriend got a pizza, they didn't bring out a stand, a plate OR cheese & red pepper shakers! Hello! it's a pizza!! We have also come before graduation season started and service was just average, nothing worth writing a yelp review about but the crappy service the last few times was super annoying. I mean, I get it...it was dinner hour and all these parties were coming in from graduations but that doesn't mean you can just ditch your table of 2 and expect that we'll be taken care of somehow."
Diana H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/7/2013,Came with a group of 6 and had to wait forever for marginal food. Wish I would have checked Yelp first. My bad.
Rpm R.,"San Ramon, CA",829,437,,3.0,4/18/2011,"Ordered: Ahi poke: tuna was fresh, it came with this funky tasting chip(didn't care for the ""chip"" - t asted like sour cream and onion) Ceasar salad - good Garden salad - ok Chicken fried steak - w/vegies, mash potatoes- it lacked gravy, asked for more - it was ok Margherita pizza - all vegatable - very good Wine & beer - x4 Service - Friendly, accomodating however a little off - gave all of our orders a little too soon- appetizer first, a couple mins. later salads arrive and soon after entrees arrived. 3 Stars"
Morgan P.,"Burlingame, CA",94,36,,3.0,8/13/2011,"I've been to the BJ's at Tanforan Shopping Center (San Bruno, CA) multiple times and this BJ's multiple times too, and I'm beginning to taste  the genericism of food from chain restaurants. From Denny's to IHOP and now BJ's, chain restaurants are starting to blend in to each other with similar options on the menu and similar tastes (flavor, texture, etc). This particular time, I had the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger with crispy-thin fries. Prior to that, I shared an Acovado Egg Rolls appetizer with my sister. The egg rolls smelled great, but I found the inside to be slightly more juicy / slimy than I had hoped for with all the avocado, sauce, and other marinated veggies. They also came in a small dish of dipping sauce which did not fit the enlarged egg rolls. Moving on to the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger... I didn't find anything particularly unique about it. (And for the record, although I've been to this BJ's location and the Tanforan location multiple times, I have never had this burger before.) The burger was sandwiched by 2 slices of white bread which stuck me as odd, especially considering the patty itself was already thinking that a slice of bread. Added on the cheese and the rest of the burger filling and you've got a burger that barely fits in my mouth. Not bad, but like the egg rolls, too slimy for me. The big thing I got out of this experience was finally having the ability to distinguish between the tastes of chain restaurants and unique restaurants. BJ's is started to blend with its own chain stores. I need to start expanding my base of where I eat. On a side note, I do recommend Pizookie, under the desserts menu."
Kerri L.,"Bellevue, WA",71,232,262,3.0,1/12/2012,"I've become a big fan of BJs  soups.  I recommend the Tomato Soup and Grilled Ham & Cheese lunch combo.  Also, the broccoli and cheddar is a thick cheesy yum.  Their croutons are their secret weapon.    Note to self: ask for extra croutons!"
T D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",10,107,,3.0,2/8/2014,"Foods decent,  service is hit or miss, mostly miss.  It's not because the wait staff is bad, it's because they never have enough people to wait tables and the customers suffer.  Probably done coming here."
Julie Z.,"San Francisco, CA",258,124,207,1.0,4/7/2013,"I usually am a huge fan of BJ's Brewery because all the chains I have gone to served great food with good beer and an upbeat attitude. This branch is not one of those. I am mainly writing a review about the rude customer service I experienced from the hostess. Last night 3 of my friends and I decided to stop by BJ's after dinner to get a pizookie and some drinks for dessert. BJ's allows you to call in ahead of time and put your name on the wait list to avoid waiting as long, which is exactly why I called in.  Even though it wasn't a very busy night judging by the number of people waiting outside (and then the number of empty tables there were when we walked in later), I was put on hold for 10 minutes just to put my name down. When I asked the girl on the other line (the hostess) how long the wait would be she told me probably 20 minutes, which was expected. However, when we got there 20 minutes later, the hostess told me it would be another 30-35 minutes. When I told her I had my name on the list and that we were told it would be a 20 minute wait when I called in (which is why we got there later), she looked at me really annoyed, and in a really condescending tone told me that their wait times always change and she couldn't prioritize me over other people who walked in just because I had called (even though that is kind of the point of calling in and putting your name on the list). We waited the extra 35 minutes but that ruined the entire night for me.  Would usually rate BJ's a 4, but I am giving this place a 1 star. Go to a different BJ's if you want to be treated with the respect you deserve as a customer."
Tyler S.,"San Francisco, CA",742,177,39,2.0,8/16/2013,"Meh...... It is what you might expect. Big place, good food and drink... low level impersonal service."
Carl M.,"San Jose, CA",13,19,,1.0,9/9/2012,"Despite the slow service and at-best average food, I have been coming to BJ's for quite awhile to watch the Tebow games on Sunday.  However this morning, they refused to show me the game I wanted to see despite asking two different employees and learning that at least two games were being watched by no one.  I even asked some of the customers and found NO ONE watching them.   I came in and specifically asked at the front where the Jets (Tebow) game was playing, and they said they did not know.  So I sat down, took my order,  and looked out for the game to come on.  I then  walked around, and finally an employee told me there was no Jets game on because they ""only have 6 receivers.""  Long story short, they refused to turn the game on for me and I suspect the manager there simply has something against Tebow.   If you want to see your game, don't expect to see it at BJ's in San Mateo.  Especially if you come to see Tebow.  And even if you make a reasonable request to see the game, don't expect them to heed your request.  I told them specifically that I would have to give them a 1 out of 5 on Yelp, and still, they would not put the game on.  To make matters worse, most sets were tuned into the games playing on cable, which I can watch from home and save myself the trouble of paying $12-20 for average food.    Limited number of receivers to watch football, average to below-average service and food, and lack of care for their customers = go to one of the many other places to actually watch your football game!"
Kelly H.,"San Francisco, CA",82,33,15,4.0,5/30/2012,"My friend made reservations for a party of 13. They were good with the timing and we didn't have to wait very long. The waitor was very nice and gave us a little treat at the end because it was my friend's birthday.  When I first walked in, it felt like a sports bar because there were TV's everywhere and there's a bar on the left. We had to cram into a table because we had a lot of people. I don't recommend coming here with more than 8-10 people. But the food was good. The burgers comes with fries but it may be a little dry unless you add ketchup. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and it was VERY spicy. So, don't order that if you can't take spicy! I drank the whole cup of water and I never got a refill until the end of the meal... Overall, it's a nice place to dine out at because it's a very nice atmosphere and the lighting is very dim."
Alison A.,"South San Francisco, CA",27,131,51,2.0,2/11/2011,"So I went here with my cousin for dinner. It started off with our waiter bring us plates for appetizers. There was a hair on the plate, and also a wet piece of what looked like a straw wrapper. Later, we get our appetizers. I unfold my napkin where the utensils are, and there is ANOTHER HAIR in there. Gross. The service was seriously lacking. Our waiter wasn't very friendly, and we rarely saw him throughout the meal. It took him a while to clear our empty plates, too, even though he saw that they were empty and we were lacking in space.  I also saw another server rolling his eyes at a woman who asked for a glass of water."
Goober S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,18,,1.0,5/14/2011,"Oh BJ's... how I would love to give you more than 1 star just for your pizookies alone but after tonight, you don't even deserve the one star I'm giving you. Called in an order for pickup at 6:28pm... not a huge order... 3 appetizers & 3 entrees. Order was not ready until 7:55... and all they comped were 4 measly sodas... REALLY?!?! We wait almost 1.5 hrs and all we get are stinkin' sodas??? The wait itself is just unacceptable!  Not only that... when we got the food home, we discovered that all 3 entrees were wrong! They gypped us the side dishes that were supposed to come with the kids' meals. To make matters worse... because we had to sit in the car for that long, a run-away cart hit our car, leaving a big scratch! Had our order been ready at a decent time (even just 10 minutes sooner), our car would've been fine! Aaaarrrgggghhh!!! Sorry BJ's but all of this is just wrong!"
Joyce E.,"Daly City, CA",138,1014,2098,4.0,1/30/2014,"I've been here a couple of times and I definitely think this is a better location than the one in San Bruno. The waits are never too long and the service is friendly, prompt, and professional! However, I do have a problem with that awful smell that reminds me of Chuck E Cheese - almost like a combination between cheese and feet. So gross! Other than that, the food is good, the service is great, and I'm a happy camper!"
Patrick O.,"Sacramento, CA",148,282,,4.0,4/4/2011,"I don't get why I'm the only 1 out of all my friends that thinks BJ's is beyond average. I'm telling you, you can't rag on BJ's food UNTIL you try the Angus Burger. Out of the 5 things I've tried here, the Angus Burger demolishes everything in sight. Huuuugeee serving and the quality is definitely up there.  The interior is nice and my servers have always been attentive. The beer ranges in quality though. The Hef and the Stout are recommended but everything else is just ehhhh.  Oh, and for dessert, the oreo pazookie is BOMB!!!!!"
