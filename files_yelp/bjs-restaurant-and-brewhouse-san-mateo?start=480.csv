Victoria Y.,"San Jose, CA",239,679,,1.0,6/26/2013,My card was charged twice again after I left the establishment. I have the receipt of my original bill to prove one of the charges but not the other two. Super shady!! I'm not planning on visiting BJ's anytime soon due to this fact.
Kris B.,"Foster City, CA",0,3,1,4.0,6/29/2014,Love this place. Its yummy pizza and fresh brewed beer... Best in the area.
Ken B.,"San Carlos, CA",4,89,,1.0,5/14/2012,"Ok, so here's an update.    Went here with a group from work for lunch.  Service was just awful bad lame and, even worse, crappy.  Took ages to get our meal - about 45 minutes after ordering.   The food was not very good at all.   When I asked for ketchup, the server said he would bring it, but never did, so I got some from the bar myself. They seem to have enough staff, but management clearly has very low standards.    Will not return unless I absolutely have to."
Julia R.,"San Mateo, CA",32,83,63,4.0,2/12/2012,"Love the food, hate the service. It's never quick here, its like the waiters are in slow motion. Besides that the food is tasty and it's fun to watch Baseball and Football games here."
Amy J.,"East Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",527,1758,161,3.0,2/2/2009,"I heard they're known for their pizza here so I'll have to try that next time I'm in the mood for one. I had a chicken sandwich of some sort which was pretty darn tasty. I sampled my boyfriend's turkey burger which was also good but a little on the salty side. It's decent for a chain. The first menu was splattered with someone's nachos or something, even our server was grossed out. She brought me a new one. Service was OK for a Sunday night.  Some guy that you'd least likely suspect would know the words to an 80s classic was singing in the bathroom...at least that's what I heard. Pretty funny."
Dan L.,"Westminster, CO",0,15,,1.0,8/19/2013,"My wife and I love BJ's and try to find one everywhere we travel. This was our first visit to this restaurant. We had the ribs which were very good, but must have had a new waitress as she was lacking in a few skills. But that is to be expected and no real problem. We did have a problem with a table of 12 that was sitting in the center of the restaurant. This group was so loud and  obnoxious that everyone around them was uncomfortable. You could see it in everyone's face as they just looked around thinking someone would come over and speak to them. Yes, I probably should have brought it to the managers attention. But, it was unlikely that the manager could not see what was going on. We just ate as quickly as possible and left. Will not return to this BJ's."
Sisi W.,"San Francisco, CA",157,188,94,3.0,2/25/2011,"You know what's scary....the calorie count next to the price it took me twice as much time to decide what we want...maybe I didn't want to know whether i just order 780 calories appitizer... Anyway, I always get ** White Peach Mojito-Yummy ** Thai Shrimp Wrap-Good but sometimes too much seasonings ** Margherita Fresca-So thin and so good --FORGET MAIN DISH--- ** PIZOOKIE!!!!!--Can you NOT have PIzookie when you come to BJ's...NO!!! that is just crime! Pizookie makes me happie~ LOL  Actually I was craving for Pizookie so I decided to come here :) i don't come here for the service nor other stuff, just for White Peach Mojito and Pizookie...will I come back...HELL YEAH. only if one day I decide to make Pizookie myself, then I guess I don't need them anymore :P"
Adam I.,"San Carlos, CA",77,54,3,1.0,4/26/2014,Bad Service. Very slow took forever and the waiter is very inattentive. Not worth the wait.
Tim A.,"San Jose, CA",128,25,,3.0,3/5/2014,"I really enjoy the amount of food to choose from, pasta, burgers, seafood. Drink selection was great to match. I have been to this BJ's a few times and not happy with the service. The waiter would come by our table to only take our order and pick up the check. No refills. Other than that it was a good experience."
James P.,"San Diego, CA",8,33,3,3.0,12/26/2011,"BJ's is a brewpub atmosphere with a pretty broad menu and a full bar, if you want it.  This BJ's is always hopping, good luck getting a seat at the bar. I ate there 4 or 5 times in the course of three weeks (visiting on business).  It's hard to write a review when the short story is that the food is really, really good (by brewpub standards) but the service is bad, bad worse.  Every time I went I prayed that it wouldn't be worse than last time and it always was.   Let me start with the food.  For lunch I had the tomato bisque and half sandwich, which is a really good choice if you are not a big eater.  For dinner, I had the calzone, which was wonderfully delicious, served hot and really filled me up.  I also sampled many of their pizzas on other visits and they are high quality and dependable. I don't know where to begin with the service.  Let me work backwards.  In all cases, once it was time to get the check, it was like pulling teeth to get it.  In two cases we actually had to get up and find someone to bring it.  The check was usually wrong.  Servers made numerous mistakes (including the checks) and never took responsibility for anything.  This included spilled drinks, delivering the wrong food, total inability to 'customize' anything (like no tomatoes, dressing on side, etc.)  If I hadn't had repeat performances from multiple servers I would have thought it was just one. In short, I generally recommend it but bring your patience and do not go if you are on a firm schedule."
ngai w.,"Redwood City, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/23/2014,Waited 30 minutes to get a table at this half empty restaurant.  Ordered water and food right the way.  It takes 15minutes for the water to come and 30 minutes to walk out of the restaurant with no food on the table.  No one care as we walked out. Waiter gave us a smirk...Never again eating at this location.
Mary T.,"Hayward, CA",94,248,205,4.0,6/7/2011,"I love this place for their yummy bbq chicken pizza.  The flavor of the chicken, bbq sauce, plump tomatoes, and red onions go well together.  The pizza crust is amazing as well.  Comes served to you in the pan that it was cooked in, straight from the oven.  Delish!  I've also tried their pasta with grilled chicken and marinara sauce and broccoli (normally comes in an alfredo sauce), I enjoy it!  I'm a VERY picky eater so I'm glad that I can substitute alfredo sauce for my red marinara.   We went there last weekend to celebrate a few birthdays in the month of May and June and they gave us all mini chocolate chip cookie pazookies with vanilla bean ice cream on top.  The waitress was even nice enough to hook my hubby up with one even though it wasn't his bday.  OMG, now I know what people mean when they say the pazookie at BJ's is off the hook.  Again, cookie is served straight in the pan it was baked it.  What a decadent dessert is all I gotta say.  I'm a big sucker for chocolate chip cookies too, but I tell you straight from the oven with ice cream on top, dude how can I resist or complain?  No way, Jose!   Minus one star because we ordered the chicken wings with sauce on the side as an appetizer and the wings were so small, I mean come on now!  Also, the wait can be a bit long and even though they tell you 30-40 minutes, we felt like we waited about an hour.  I had to bother the staff at the front a few times before they actually seated us."
Erica C.,"San Jose, CA",12,43,32,4.0,3/29/2012,"First time I had a mojito - awesome! very refreshing summertime type drink. Pzookie is a bit much on the sweet side, love all the chocolate, but you need about a half gallon of ice cold milk to wash it down!"
James F.,"Redwood City, CA",10,185,9349,4.0,2/5/2010,"For a chain, the food isn't bad. Came here with 11 of my coworkers for lunch. We made reservations ahead, so we would have a large table. Service was quick and friendly, and the food was not bad, for being a chain. Everyone was happy with their meals, and we had no complaints. A 17% tip was added to the bill, but that is fine with us, since there were so many of us, and happy with food and service.  Ample parking in the massive parking lot, so that's easy. Yes, I would come here again.  Negatives? I would say during lunch hour, the place is packed to the max, and the place gets noisy, but other than that, we had a good experience."
Neesh Q.,"Milpitas, CA",224,278,58,3.0,1/10/2013,"Good for after-work happy hours and loud socializing. Relaxed atmosphere. Food hits the spot, especially the appetizers. Pleasantly surprised to see so many legit non-alcoholic options. Virgin strawberry mojito is really good. Service is painfully slow during lunch hours so make sure you're wearing running shoes to chase down your waiters."
Eduardo F.,"Cottage Grove, WI",21,89,41,3.0,1/20/2014,"Food is good, much better than other American places. There is only a few customizations allowed such as ""no barbecue sauce"" come on...service is OK not great."
K P.,"Burlingame, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/3/2013,"This was my first visit and it was quite pathetic to say the lease. I ordered a veggie pasta here and it took like almost 30 mins for them to have it made. And finally when it came, I see some MEAT pieces on it. WOW ! The chef came over and told that sausage was kept alongside olives and that is how it ended up on my table..  REALLY ?? So, why keep meat near the veggies that there is a chance it might spill over ?? That makes no sense whatsoever.. Will probably never visit this place again."
Mechelle A.,"Hayward, CA",129,97,306,3.0,1/15/2014,Food was great our server was great.. garlic fries was good .. had a steak it was cooked perfect  and the chicken wings was smackin .. but loss a star for the manager being a bitch to her employees  in front of her customers ... me being a restaurant manager/owner I was really sick to my stomach seeing how she interacted with her employees real downgrading them
Bowser J.,"Burlingame, CA",1,40,,2.0,1/1/2011,"I am basing this review on two visits. The first; Service was fast and friendly and the pulled pork sandwich was tasty. The second; The waiter had no depth or personality. I know you don't want to be at work man, but if you want to bring home a little extra bread - then you need to UP your game. Any bleak attempt of some sort of human like comment out of his mouth was awaited but only pertained to the food and his job. Way to make an enjoyable experience for people trying to go out and be somewhat fancy instead of eating fast food. He then brings the check as we're eating and has this statement prepared. ""Here is the check, I can still add anything you would like. It's just here...for your convenience."" Wow way to shuffle us out the door and make us feel like we should stay for a few drinks especially it being happy hour and all. On top of everything, I ordered a chicken sandwich that came out soggy on one side of the bread. Ughh.."
Shannon N.,"San Jose, CA",65,800,167,2.0,8/17/2009,"They've got a deal going on right now (found out about it via email, there's no mention of it on their web site or on the menu in-store) - 2 salads/soups, a medium pizza and a pizookie for $20.  This is a steal (the pizza alone is normally $20).  So we stopped by to give it a try. Started with the garden salad and the chili. Salad was boring (iceberg and shredded carrots) - two stars there.  Chili was tasty - big chunks of meat, a little bit of heat, and a dollop of sour cream.  Four stars. Pizza - we did the combination (forget its exact name) with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.  It's all crust.  Very little tomato, almost no cheese, just a ton of crust.  Extremely buttery crust.  Very, very disappointing - I'd been craving pizza for ages and this did *not* hit the spot.  Two stars. Pizookie - this is where it's at.  Get the ice cream on the side so it doesn't melt all over your warm cookie of love.  Four stars. Parking here is *much* better than their Cupertino location.  If you need a pizookie, go to San Mateo! Would stop by there again for the pizookie, and maybe the chili, perhaps.  But the pizza was so meh, I think I'm pushing this back down to a two star.  I would've been peeved if this meal had been full-price (closer to $40).  The pizza was such a disappointment.  Meh indeed."
