Sandra L.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",197,193,134,3.0,10/10/2011,"BJ's is your typical Beer/Chain food restaurant place that you can come to frequently and consistently get the food you expect to get. It's a great place you can come and enjoy a few beers with some friends, some appetizers, and maybe share some entree's as their portions are enormous. You can even enjoy some items from their ""healthier"" options menu, which if I don't mind saying are pretty tasty as well, if you can get yourself to make that lower calorie choice. All in all, BJ's has good food and beer which is why this place is always packed. They are opened up late also, which is always a good thing!"
Katie B.,"San Francisco, CA",180,169,293,3.0,11/5/2010,"The food is always good and they have great lunch deals but the service can definitely be a hit or miss.  Most of the times the service can be really slow and you feel like no one ever comes by but then there are the times you get the servers, rarely, who are really on top of their game.  They are the reason I come back - hoping I get one of those good servers because I really do like the food here. I love the new 'snacks and small bites' that you can order instead of getting one of their 'sharable appetizers' because the small bites are perfect size for something to munch on before getting your main dish but the appetizers are so big I usually get full off of those and I have no more room for my main dish. I always get the chardonnay shrimp pasta, to me it's the best dish on their menu.  The pizzas are really good too and very filling so between the two of us (boyfriend and I) we can get a small and share it and it's more than enough for us to be stuffed. Wish the service would be more consistent and they figured out how to make the wait not as long!"
Nixon L.,"San Francisco, CA",34,61,10,4.0,7/4/2013,"I go here a few times a month to watch my sports. Place is big. Television at about every corner. On some night it gets crowded and service starts slowing down. However, I never had any complaints with service being rude. The servers are actually friendly . And folks, lets give them bigger tips on busy days."
Alfred Y.,"San Carlos, CA",351,430,39,3.0,5/19/2011,"The only difference between other chain restaurants, is that BJ's draft beers can stand head to head with other microbreweries. The TVs and bar area are the only reasons why I head there for a get together. I can shout, watch sports, complain about today's teenagers, and beat my chest. Coming here makes me feel manly; and old."
Albert L.,"Temple City, CA",318,177,61,3.0,3/13/2011,"Eh, food is mediocre, but the atmosphere is GREAT for hanging out with friends and watching a sports game. The alcohol here is great, and the finger foods are pretty standard, but I really do like the avocado egg rolls! YUM! So if you're looking for a place to get together with a large group of friends and get rowdy, then this is the place to be! An excellent happy hour place =)"
Brian G.,"Uniontown, OH",5,17,4,4.0,3/15/2012,Jambalaya. Really #@$%ing great.  Their IPAs. Really #@$%ing great. Good servers too.
Gina R.,"San Carlos, CA",70,88,4,1.0,10/24/2010,"The only way to get your online order modified to your liking is to put ***ALLERGY*** in your comments field. 90% of the time they'll listen. As for eating in person. I've actually had to walk out after ordering drinks and waiting for our server for 40 minutes. It was night time and empty, too."
Matthew W.,"Martinez, CA",69,179,16,4.0,8/5/2013,Great deep dish pizza. I always order pepperoni and sausage. Beers and selection also good.
Lorraine C.,"Mountain View, CA",176,195,77,5.0,10/13/2011,"Though a chain, I thoroughly enjoy BJ's the food is consistent, which is to be expected.  I think what keeps me coming back is the staff. Matt, Crystal, and Julio are rock stars. Always greeted with a smile and brief conversation even when slammed.  As much as I run there occasionally to find brief comfort and sanctuary during a hard or not so hard day. They make me feel like they find comfort and sanctuary in my company as well. I like that! Thanks Guys, keep up the good work."
Red R.,"San Francisco, CA",97,76,17,2.0,11/21/2011,"Beers, Apps and finger foods are your best bet... Most full meals and sad!!! House salad was horrible.  But, the service was good so we didn't complain about any of the sad food."
Deborah F.,"Redwood City, CA",4,80,,1.0,12/26/2012,"Pretty pathetic went their for a pre- holiday lunch with some friends. Started out bad when the guy taking our drink order disappeared. Got bad meatballs cold & raw. My husband got a pizza ALL the cheese was in the middle. The manager Jimmy came over & had the cook make  a new one it was as bad. Jimmy informed us the cook ""does not know how to make pizza they are training him"" mmmm .The Mgr comped our pizza & dreadful meat ball appetizer but the lunch was a horrible experience, we were there for two hours most waiting for service.  This is the second horrible experience there. We only went bach  cuz our friends had decent experiences."
bonnie y.,"San Mateo, CA",114,52,14,5.0,1/11/2011,"HAPPY FOR HAPPY HOUR: sunday - thursday 4 - 7pm & 10pm- midnight (close) go for: their BEER ($3.75/pint), $5 mini pizzas also, $1/$2 off well drinks, cocktails, and appetizers. (but beware: cocktail prices aren't listed and are always more expensive than i expect) it's open seating, but as long as there isn't some sports game going on, you usually can find a spot. its really DARK there, i'm not sure why. servers are nice, but the service isn't very good... but its happy hour, what do you expect? so, if they haven't come to check on you or take you order, they probably won't any time soon. Don't be too shy or too patient to ask, or else you'll likely be waiting a while. my recommendation: go with a small group of friends to chill, catch up, and chat away, no one cares if you're loud :) Each beer has a nice description and is distinctly different, so there's one for everyone's preference (my pick: piranha pale ale, my favorite beer of all time!). our little secret is to order their shoestring fries-- it's not on the menu, but counts as an appetizer so only ends up costing a few bucks for a whole plate! bomb.  and hey, you might get lucky. last time we received a complimentary pizookie PARTY platter. no complaints here."
Jenny C.,"Burlingame, CA",36,394,60,2.0,8/9/2011,"Don't come here during Friday lunch time, unless you can get there before 11:30 or after 2pm...the wait was HORRIBLE for a party of 7...the wait staff/employees did not seem apologetic at all that the wait was taking forever...i understand that it could be busy during a friday lunch rush, but this was unacceptable. They don't take reservations for parties under 10. I called ahead to have my party put on the wait list but it was useless. Probably wouldn't be back during lunch rush, or any other rush, esp not with a big party."
Am T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,4,5.0,5/13/2013,"I just want to thank you BJ's staff. Couple of weeks ago my friend and I decided to get some dinner there. We were followed by some creep from the parking lot into the restaurant, we informed the staff and they handled this issue really well. The managers kicked that guy out, and checked in with us if we were ok. Our waitress was a sweetheart and tried to cheer us up! The food was also spectacular! Thank you for turning this bad night into a good one!"
Peter S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/23/2014,"Abysmal unprofessional hostess.   I went on a Saturday night between 9:30 and 10:00pm.  There were empty tables but our name was taken so we had to wait in an empty front area.  A party of 4 came in well after us and was seated right away.  We were told that they phoned in that they were coming so they bumped us.  Nowhere on the website does it say that they have this policy.   I was upset and asked the hostess why we were bumped?  Rather than get mad I walked away and she came over to where I was sitting and said rather stiffly, ""We will seat you in two minutes Sir.""  Calling a patron ""Sir"" the way she did is tantamount to saying FY; no apology for the misunderstanding or the lack of communication - just ""Sir"".  We left and will not come back."
Rick P.,"Campbell, CA",69,103,,3.0,1/29/2012,"Ehhh...This place is so hit-and-miss. Sometimes its awesome while other times it falls flat.  If you need a decent place to satisfy your burger/brew craving, and you are in the area, BJ's is worth checking out.  They get an additional half-star for their Avocado egg roll...that thing is killer."
Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",663,1265,21,3.0,10/7/2010,"You know, I really like the atmosphere at BJ's. Classy bar, plenty of TV screens playing your favorite sports, smoking area outside. They've also got a great beer selection, which a big draw. That said, I've consistently been disappointed by the food. It's overpriced, the presentation is awful, and you just never feel good after having a meal here. Getting drunk here is OK, I mean, you can get drunk anywhere. But stuffing yourself here is a pretty nasty proposition. I wouldn't do it. Add the number of corporate zombies that wander in here during lunch and happy hour and the consequent wait, and you have a not so fun place to go. That said, fun often depends on your company. And since my work is around the corner, we've had a few get togethers here. Would I come here on my own time? Most likely not."
Bill O.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",154,526,47,4.0,4/1/2009,"This place rocks.  I'll be right up front and tell you the ONLY problem with them (and it costs a star) is the 25 hour wait to get in during lunch or dinner... Great beer (seems to be a theme for me...what's up with that?)....great burgers, great chicken sandwiches, great appetizers, great staff.  Every time I go here, I have a fantastic dining experience with family and friends.  Highly recommended destination (just plan on that 25 hour wait.  Unfortunately, a few others have figured out this is the place to be)."
Yamileth O.,"San Bruno, CA",121,71,25,4.0,10/27/2010,"I go to this place way too often, but there is definitely a good reason for it. I love going to BJ's for lunch because they have such an affordable menu. I usually get half a sandwich, a salad or soup and it comes with fries and all for like $7. I know amazing!  Watching games at this establisment its definitely entertaining. There's always a good crowd."
Michelle G.,"San Mateo, CA",88,53,,4.0,8/20/2011,"Love Bj's especially durring football season because they offer happy hour pricing in the bar anytime a game is on! Plus the experience is the same regardless of which location you go to. This one gets a bit busy durring happy hour even durring the week. Most likely because it is a good meet up spot and there are tons of offices In Foster City. Overall, for a chain, I love their food and beers. Not much else to say!"
