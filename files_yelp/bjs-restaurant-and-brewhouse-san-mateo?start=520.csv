Bob S.,"Oyster Bay, NY",0,9,,1.0,7/23/2014,"Poor service - lousy food. All around bad experience. Other than sitting us before we were expecting, the trip there was a waiste. Last time"
Victoria A.,"Hayward, CA",9,4,1,1.0,12/29/2013,"Just ate lunch and had the worst service. Lorenzo our server made no effort to take our order. Its not like it was busy we were surrounded by empty tables! He kept getting our order wrong. Ordered rice dish, it came out more as a soup with the amount of sauce. The server never refiled our waters til the very end as we were leaving. He brought us our check before we were even done with our food. The check was the only thing he seemed to worry about. He kept making sure he came back for that but when it came to ordering food or trying to get his attention for anything he was no where to be found."
Chocoolate I.,"San Francisco, CA",0,468,752,3.0,4/24/2012,"The best thing about this particular BJ's is the location and atmosphere which, I guess is not a compliment considering that it is a restaurant. There is plenty of parking and it has a real sports bar feel. The bartenders are terrific and if you get there when Sergio is working you will get a fair drink. They have a full bar and great selection of beer. If you like Coors Light try the Light Switch Lager instead and they brew a mean Hefeweizen The food is another story in that it is nothing to write home about and they could easily change this by using things called spices.  The food is just too bland. The Tomato Basil Soup bowl was good and ample but I grabbed the pepper immediately. The Angel Hair Toscano was plentiful but tasteless but since it was so plentiful I was able to bring it to work the next day. After adding some garlic and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning it was pretty good. I will return on Sundays to watch basketball but I will bring a small salt shaker with season salt or something similar."
Marcial E.,"San Mateo, CA",19,8,,1.0,1/29/2014,Food is pretty good but our waiter Jordan provided poor service!  He ignored us most of the time and showed he didn't care about customers!
Kajal G.,"San Francisco, CA",141,415,436,5.0,9/16/2013,"Stopped in for a beer and snack (watermelon and feta salad and minestrone soup) everything was yummy, quick and service was great (I was sitting at the bar)."
Brittany I.,"Tracy, CA",370,70,44,1.0,11/20/2012,"Tonight my family of 4 (my husband, myself, and our two year old twin boys) went to eat dinner at BJ's.  At the end of our meal, we ordered a pazookie to share.  We waited for 26 minutes and it never came out! My husband waived down our waiter because not once in those 26 minutes did he come by to check in with us.  When he came over he immediately said ""I will bring it out in a second, it got real busy here."" Um, that is great and all but my twins are now going psychotic and throwing tantrums...we tried to flag him down to box it up but he was nowhere in sight.  By the time he came over the ice cream had melted all over and he charged us for it! I was pissed but at that rate we just needed to get out of there because our kids were exhausted from waiting for so long!! I am so irritated and I heard the table next to us complaining too.  Management really needs to reevaluate who they hire!"
Jerry W.,"San Francisco, CA",166,280,177,2.0,10/30/2011,"We had reservations at BJ's for dinner, had to make it because of the size of the party about 20 (including a 8 kids).  Plenty of parking, thanks to the shopping center. Really stupid policy of not seating the party if less then half party is there, even if the place is not that busy.  If they would have seated us, I could have ordered appetizers and drinks first, boy was I hungry.  I was tempted to going to Starbucks to pickup a muffin. I appreciate the calorie count per serving...it really helps in deciding what to order or what not to order. Service - not too swift, had to ask for refill of hot water 2 times. They did not check on drink refills until the entrees came out...they did bring out appetizers, but totally ignored all the empty glasses.  They also left the stacked used plates at the end of the table. Must be because we had larger party and an automatic 20% gratuity was added to the tab. Calamari ($9.25) - crispy and hot...love the lemon garlic aioli.  Premium Boneless Wings ($8.95)- pretty good, but we asked for Sweet Maui Teriyaki Glaze...when does ""sweet"" equate to ""a little bit of heat""...the kids were surprised for sure...my 6 year old spat it out then had to gulp down water.  They did however send out another order of BBQ wings, these were good, hope they did not charge us for it. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak ($12.25)...cannot go wrong with battered deep fried beef right?......WRONG!!!  After taking our orders, the waitress came back and said that they ran out of Chicken Fried Steak....how?  Can't they just butterfly a sirloin and pound it out...oh maybe they use Pre-Cooked Chicken Fried Steak that they drop into the deep fryer? My second choice was the Fish Taco ($10.25)...they can't go wrong with deep fried fish right....Actually I liked the tacos, you get two of them so they were really good with a slightly spicy slaw that topped it...I think it was spicy, still trying to get the ""Sweet Maui Sauce"" out of my mouth.  Note the tortilla chips that came with the dish...was shiny...a bit too much oil from the deep fryer I think. My wife ordered the Chicken Marsala.  We of course swapped plates, later on.  The chicken moist, but the Marsala sauce had no character, just tasted like a watered down mushroom sauce...very disappointing.  The noodles was just north of al dente...what I find a bit disturbing is that I found a number of twist pasta mixed in with the fettuccine...did they empty out the pasta cooker?  How long had the twist pasta been sitting there?  Bathroom is a double standee with 2 stalls.  When I went to the men's room before we were seated I found a lot of paper towels on the floor around the waste basket and some near the urinals...after dinner (about 2 hours later), the waste basket had not been emptied, there were still trash on the floor.  Note, sinks (4 of them) were all functional but the counters were wet...short kids beware."
The Dirty Truth F.,"San Mateo, CA",18,39,4,1.0,7/1/2012,"Slow service - my food was delayed 45 minutes!! When I finally asked for it, they served it in 5 mins. What!?! The service is trash and the staff look like airheads standing around with their mouths wide open. Idiots."
Kevin S.,"San Mateo, CA",16,34,,4.0,9/2/2011,Pretty good food. The Nachos are always something I can go for. This one is deffinitly packed and you have to wait on the weekend.  Not too loud and a good place to sit and chat.  we will deffinitly be back
Leslie P.,"Torrance, CA",70,1012,1212,3.0,7/5/2010,"Like all others, the food is only average, the pizzokie is overrated, but good for groups."
Kristen G.,"San Diego, CA",11,20,,5.0,10/21/2011,"I went here back in July and I loved it!! It is one of the only places I can get a good gluten free drink, called a Berry Blast. The food is also amazing for a chain restaurant. Also always leave room for dessert because the Pazookie dessert is to die for! Can get super super busy on the weekends so try and go on a weekday."
Christina F.,"Redwood City, CA",12,77,24,3.0,6/12/2013,The lunch menu is nice and quick - we came in here after shopping at Costco for a quick lunch. We ate up at the bar - we both got the pizza and salad lunch - The salads came out really fast and the pizzas were yummy! We split an oreo pizzooki - It was off the hook!!!
Alex Z.,"San Francisco, CA",3,36,1,1.0,12/11/2012,"Searched for Stella's in North Beach, this came up.  Been to the one in Westwood, eh.  Yeah, for bland, greasy, uninspiring American food I guess it's okay.  Pizookie?  Please. Pass."
Hailey H.,"San Carlos, CA",9,1,,2.0,1/14/2014,Service mediocre....food wasn't all that fantastic my French bread was more of a Crüe ton then French bread and the best thing about the night was leaving the place also I couldn't eat my food I got food poisoning that same night.......
Adrian A.,"Redwood City, CA",91,16,,3.0,1/14/2014,"I was a little annoyed with the staff at the Tan Fran location. Called to make reservations in order to watch the Niner game. First I was told that I could make reservations, then after I tried to make my reservation they told me I couldn't because it was unfair to the walk in customers for my party to come in and be sat while they have been sitting and waiting? Either way we walked in and got on the list. When my party was called the hostess told us we couldn't sit because only half my party was their. She was so rude and her facial expressions were as if she smelled something horrible. Rudeness. Food was okay. Our waiter was really cool."
Jason H.,"Ontarioville, IL",0,16,,1.0,1/19/2013,"I just can't figure this place out. Beer is ok. Food is average to above average. TV's and sports viewing are good. The service is just horrible. Always. In fact, everyone I know says the service is horrible. We joke about it. We get frustrated by it. It is just the weirdest thing. They must terminate the managers or entire staff weekly as everyone seems new and clueless. There is no lack of people/employees. I wish I had a better perspective. I now only go to BJ's if I have to. Did I say horrible service? It's the worst I've ever experienced, consistently. BJ's Corp HQ should dig into this location and figure out how it so tarnishes its brand day in and day out."
Steve P.,"Redwood City, CA",60,85,,4.0,7/9/2011,"BJ's has a LOT to offer. Great drinks, great deep dish pizza, great sandwiches and more. They are wildly popular and very busy so it is likely that every now and then a Yelper is going to catch them not at their best. Many of these servers are working their first jobs so give these kids a break. The drinks...we had the Throwback Cherry  Cola (an alcoholic drink) and it was very good. The BJ's Irish Root Beer was even better. We also had a Captain's Root Beer but the BJ's Irish was better. All 3 were good, but the BJ's Irish was best. The food...they do deep dish proper with very tasty ingredients. Beats the hell out of a Costco pizza. They've got a gimmiky dessert known as a Pizzookie or something like that. It's really good, so if you have room, you should definitely get one. I'll be back to BJ's for more."
Kasey R.,"San Francisco, CA",1,15,,1.0,7/13/2012,"When I go to BJ's (which is not often), my expectations are not very high. It's a chain restaurant that is known better for its beer and big-screen televisions than its fresh and local food, and I understand that. However, I still expect to be treated with respect and to have my party's food and beverages get to us in a timely manner.  That said, my most recent experience at BJ's has confirmed I will never be returning, except hopefully to get a refund. The service was horrible from the start, our food was mediocre (even for BJ's standards), and when we brought this to the manager's attention after the meal (I do not recall his name, but he is the overweight asian man) he was extremely rude and unaccommodating. We will be contacting his manager as a result.  So, here are the specifics as to why I will not spend money at BJ's ever again: 1. POORLY EXECUTED FOOD (which mainly consisted of FRIED dishes)  The roast beef sandwich was fine, but my blonde shrimp had been left in the flyer too long and were mostly overdone, some being burnt. The potato wedges and fish were lukewarm and had clearly been sitting at the pass for far too long. By the time we actually got this food we had actually been at the restaurant for close to an hour and did not have the time to send anything back. 2. HORRIBLE SERVICE  My party was seated in the back of the restaurant, and after over 10 minutes had still not received a hello or any water from any waiter-- even though the people next to us who had been seated AFTER US were being attended to by a waitress. One of us finally had to get up and find that waitress (I do not know her name either, but she was a younger, overweight  girl with dark hair and bangs) to ask her if she could take our drink orders. She responded NOT by simply taking out orders, but by saying she ""wasn't sure"" if she was our waitress, but she would go check. So, there we waited some more. A few minutes later, she returned and curtly said she ""would just take our order because it will be easier that way."" By that point we were ready to order drinks and food, so we gave her our complete order, which consisted of the fried blonde shrimp, fish & chips, and a roast beef sandwich-- SIMPLE food. She proceeded to take about five minutes to get back to us with water. Our food took about another 15 minutes to arrive, despite her telling us she would ""rush our order.""  Throughout the meal she never once returned to fill our water glasses, so we had to flag down a busboy. When she did bring over my husband's Jeremiah Red beer, she just dropped on the table with no eye contact and turned to help the table next to us again. When we were finished eating and the waitress was around, we hailed to her and asked for the check, which took her over 5 minutes to bring to us. We put the card in it immediately, but still after 1 minutes she had not come back to pick it up. At one point I even made eye contact with her but she still did not come over. Finally, we just decided to pay in cash and not wait for the receipt. 3. RUDE MANAGER After the meal, we went to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager. We waited almost 10 minutes and still he did not show. We almost left without speaking to him, but decided it was worth it to wait. So we waited another 6 or so minutes and he finally showed. He did not apologize for keeping us waiting. After we explained the horrible service and ridiculous mistakes with the food, he displayed no concern and said he did not have time for this. We wanted a refund, but all he would give us was a $20 gift card, as if we WANT to go back. As we were speaking with the manager, another customer came up to complain to him, but he rudely ignored the man and told the hostess to ""get another manager to deal with this."""
Nicole O.,"San Francisco, CA",103,207,154,4.0,6/2/2013,Ahi poke is yummmmm. Great happy hour here as well.
Naruto G.,"Mountain View, CA",5,98,42,2.0,9/30/2011,"order the food from    We ordered a lot of stuff, mix review.  the ceasar salad entree for 8.95 was very very little (the box was huge)   we order a side brocolli $2.95 for 3 pieces WTF.  The chicken marsala was really nice, but the pasta is really hard, i guess it undercooked.  the clam chowder was very salty. . . unbelievable salty.  i guess, because we ordered to go from   the quality is not good.  i tried the BJ at cupertino, overall it's reasonable and ok."
