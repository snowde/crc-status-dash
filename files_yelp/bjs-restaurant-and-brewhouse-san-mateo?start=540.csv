Joy L.,"San Jose, CA",41,197,53,4.0,5/30/2013,"I had the angus burger sliders as my meal and the sliders tasted bland and there weren't any onions on my sliders and it supposed to come with it.  The dish also comes with fries and this was all under $10.  As for my dessert, I had the macadamia nut pizookie and my friend had the chocolate chip pizookie which all were very sweet and good.  The waitress was friendly, however it took us 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered.  The table across from us was furious because their order took a long time too.  Overall, I'd come back to try their other food selections, but if it takes more than 20 mins to receive my food then that'll be the last time I'm going to this place again."
Rob K.,"San Carlos, CA",0,4,,5.0,2/8/2014,I have never had a bad meal at this location. I have worked on these restaurants and I can guarantee you they are the cleanest kitchens I have ever worked on. I eat at every BJs restaurant near me when I can. I am type 2 diabetic and they have always gone out of their way to accommodate my restricted diet. Definitely a 5 star restaurant and restaurant chain!
Kelley B.,"Foster City, CA",79,48,10,3.0,5/15/2011,"I have mixed feelings about this place - I love the food, beer, and TVs but I'm not a big fan of their service, as it's really a hit or miss kind of thing.  I've been to this BJs enough times to have a lot of observations to report, so I'll just make a few general points: *While their food and beer are bomb, it's really hard to find low-cal dishes.  Luckily I just saw an ad that they came out with some low-cal options so I really look forward to trying those (chicken, tilapia, pork chops all under 575 calories? Yes, please!). *Their bar area is great (albeit frequently busy) - it's a fun place to meet up with friends or to cheer on the Giants, 49ers, Sharks, or whomever else with tons of other fans. *A lot of their waiters apparently don't know how to wait on their customers when it's super busy in there.  They will be absent for long periods of time, and to top it off, I've gotten a couple different servers who've been snobby about it and then try to kiss up to you towards the end when they remember that the customers control how much tip they get. *My biggest turnoff, if you will, to this particular BJ's is that they always gyp me on my change.  Every time I pay with cash - regardless of the waiter or waitress - I don't get all of my change back.  Sometimes it's 75 cents, sometimes 40 cents, sometimes only a penny, but I'm always shorted.  The principle of the thing pisses me off, so I always make sure to ask for my change back, and they always pretend like they don't know what I'm talking about.  Really?  Are you all that bad at math?  Doesn't the cash register even do the math FOR you?  I'd prefer thinking that they're just dumb when it comes to numbers rather than the alternative: that they're taking their customers' money on purpose."
Isabel M.,"Redwood City, CA",18,5,,1.0,11/12/2014,I've been a BJs customer for quite a while now and it's always a hit or miss on the service. However this time I felt the service was beyond terrible. I came in and was seated very quickly. When the waiter Gustavo came around he asked us if we were ready to order. Being such a regular I always ask for the spaghetti with the spicy tomato sauce. I asked him if I could have a Shirley temple to drink and also two waters with lemons and of course like usual I asked for the spaghetti. Then he rudely said that's not in the menu. Therefore I ask for a minute to see what else I could order since I was not aware of the menu changes. He comes back with our drinks. The waters had no lemons in it and my Shirley temple tasted like carbonated water with a touch of grenadine. I put in my order and also asked if he could bring us more lemons. He passed us by 5 times and not once did he asked if we needed anything else and he still had not brought the lemons. I couldn't even tell him about my drink because he would ignore us every time he passed by. My food came out and I needed ketchup but I couldn't even ask him for that because he had not come to check on us therefore I had to ask someone else that was not our waiter if she could bring us condiments. Afterwards he still walked by without acknowledging us and at that point I felt that the service we were receiving was not right and very unpleasant. I spoke to a manager and he was quick to getting my drink fixed and asked us if we needed anything else. After eating my food the waiter rudely drops the tab without looking at us or saying thank you and walks away... Worst service I have ever received at a restaurant I was so loyal to
Ji P.,"Daly City, CA",0,23,38,1.0,10/26/2013,Service too slow. Waited too long to get our food. I will not come back here. I'd rather go to BJs at Tanforan.
Dawn D.,"San Jose, CA",353,596,20,3.0,5/30/2008,"I love their huge menu! There's something for everyone.  Dined here last Tuesday after a 25 mile bike ride and I thought I deserved a burger since I rode with faster peeps. Of course I couldn't really keep up, but I know the only way I will get better is to ride with better peeps! Anyways, I was impressed when I saw that Sourdough is an option for burger bread! YEAH!!! I went with a regular burger on sourdough with onion rings.  I had it medium and it was very good!! Service was kinda spotty.  From the time we finished our entrees to when our dessert arrived was a very long wait.  BJ's is lucky we had a really good group and  we kept each other entertained.  Our drinks weren't refilled. In fact, I remember slurping on the melting ice of my water glass. I hope I get better service next time I go back."
Jennifer L.,"Vancouver, WA",105,499,248,2.0,9/6/2010,"We walked in at 12:30am on a Friday night. I know it was near closing time but we couldn't find many food options nearby. We just wanted a place to sit down and have something that's not fast food after a very long day of moving so we decided to go to BJ's. There was nobody in the front. They had at least 7 waitresses and waiters around and some of them made eye contact with us but none of them came to help us. It was uber slow. We asked two customers in front of us if they were also waiting to be seated. They said no, they were just waiting to pay and leave and suggested we go chase down somebody because ""they've been chillin' today."" We took their advice and chased down a waiter in the bar. He said it's open bar so just sit anywhere...we actually had a minor with us and nobody asked to check our IDs...oh well I guess that wasn't a bad thing for us because they closed off the dining area. After we were seated...at an unclean table, nobody came to help us still. We went up to the waiters to ask for a rag to clean our table, menus, water, and somebody to take our orders; there was a lot of waiting between all of those. When somebody finally came to take our order, we found out they were only serving appetizers and pizzas...so our vegan friend had to have french fries for dinner. Our server was...nice but kind of cocky...I'm not sure...he was smiling...or was he smirking? I guess excuse us for coming in 30 minutes before closing but I don't get establishments like that. Why say you close at 1am when what you really mean is ""we want to go home by 1am?"" Then maybe you should close at 11:30pm so you can finish serving the rest of the customers and finish your cleaning and side jobs. The food was okay. I would say better than just okay considering it's a chain restaurant. We had wings, fries, and pizzas. The wings were okay but it can be topped by Foster Farms' Hot and Spicy Wings (value and taste -wise). The fries were made right...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They deserve props for that. I know french fries doesn't sound like a big deal but it's an utter disappointment and shock when they're not made right. I like how the pizzas were fresh and came with a lot of toppings but I think it should have more sauce. The dough and sauce and cheese and topping ratio could use some adjustment. The dough was soft and chewy, yum!"
Paul A.,"Belmont, CA",0,45,,3.0,1/14/2014,"Food is ok.  Ok, maybe a bit below ok.  Predictably below ok. I guess people come here for the bar / beers.   Never had problems with the service unlike others."
Kristine G.,"San Mateo, CA",109,24,2,3.0,8/1/2013,I've been here many times and not once have a had a server that was friendly and allowed us adequate time to look over the menu. They are either rushing us to make a decision or giving us way too much time. Their bruschetta small bites and the beer samplers are my favorite! I also enjoy their grilled chicken pasta. The one time I tried a pizza from here it was SO greasy and under cooked. I was only able to eat one slice and then I had to bring the rest home and re-cook it in the oven.
Star M.,"Rockport, TX",20,277,107,2.0,8/28/2010,"Service was the downside here -- host staff and wait staff both had issues.  Mostly,  the host staff -- apparently if you are cute & just go sit down at a table while you are waiting on the list, you get to stay at the table, even though there are several parties on the wait list ahead of you.  Also, asked host for a booth -- we walked by an empty one & sat at a two top table (yes, by the door to the kitchen); and the two guys being seated at the exact same time, got the booth.  But yes, they were definitely younger and tragically hipper . . . . Food was ok -- Cobb Salad was fresh, but uninspired -- no blue cheese on a Cobb, really?    Then it's not a Cobb -- call it something else.  Burger was dry.  Beer (their IPA) was way too bitter, even for an IPA -- didn't finish it. Meh -- I've had better."
Astha S.,"Livermore, CA",0,164,,1.0,7/19/2013,"our wine glass had lipstick marks and water drops on it, deep crust pizza was so bad. I stopped going there after two bad incidents. I love bj but the San Bruno one"
Tonya W.,"Redwood City, CA",1,5,,1.0,9/1/2013,"Ordered take-out for the first time and the experience was terrible. It started out well, ordering online was extremely convenient and easy. You have access to the full menu and the ability to enter special requests. Shortly after I placed my order I received a text message providing confirmation. When I arrived to pick up the order it was ready and waiting. I reviewed the receipt, everything was correct and I paid for the order. Then as the bag was being packed I noticed that the salad had blackened salmon on it instead of blackened shrimp. After 2 different people asked me if I specified shrimp and not salmon, they apologized and said it would just a few minutes to correct the order. It ended up taking about 12 minutes to correct the order. When I got home and opened the salad, it still had the salmon in it with the shrimp on top. I did not want salmon! Additionally, I ordered a pizza with olives and pepperoni but when I opened the box there were no olives on it. The pizza crust was totally limp and flimsy. The order was not complex and the restaurant was not busy when I got there. There really is no good reason for the order being wrong. Not sure I'll ever order BJs to-go again, but if I do I will thoroughly inspect each item."
Caroline Y.,"Redwood Shores, CA",0,17,,1.0,1/3/2015,"On a recent dinner visit, I noticed the kitchen operation was very slow, the waitress was forgetful and inexperienced. She forgot to bring our beer, and she broke a plate while walking in the aisle.  I sensed that this restaurant is paying its staff as cheaply as possible, and since this restaurant is surely not a cheap eating place, I began to wonder where all the money went?  after I went home, I did a little research on BJ's income statement since this is a publicly traded company.  Whoa!!  42% of this company's revenue goes to SG&A expense, meaning the corporate management was paying themselves a ton!!!"
Ajesh S.,"Oakland, CA",391,33,,1.0,5/31/2012,"We were a group of 25 and they completely dropped the ball. They never had a dedicated server(s) for our table. We would have probably ordered more if we had someone to wait on us. Also took 4 requests to order one drink that too they messed up. Worst of all, most of us fell sick from food poisoning. We have sworn on our lives never to eat here again."
Mike A.,"San Mateo, CA",23,34,,4.0,4/11/2011,Good beer. No Idea if it really is brewed on-site and I don't really care because I like it. I guess it would add to the credibility of the whole 'brewhouse' thing. Decent food that is better than (American) pub food. Staff has always been friendly and efficient.
Eric L.,"San Mateo, CA",4,5,1,1.0,10/10/2015,"Went to BJs at 10 pm and it was busy. We got a seat at the bar and service was so slow. Our waitress,  jessica was apparently really behind so another waitress helped out at our table. Jessica eventually came by but was inattentive. We had an appetizer and then got out pizookis. We must have waited 25 minutes for the pizookis and we were looking for Jessica so we can check, and she was a few tables away chatting up a storm with other customers and the bartender. By this point the bar was not that busy anymore. She saw that I was staring at her and looked away. So I stood up and walked over to her and then finally she wakes towards me and said she checked with the runner about the order. A few minutes later the pizookis came. It took a lot less time to eat it than the wait time. I had gotten a coupon for a free pizooki for my bday so it was so not worth the hassle. There is simply no excuse to take that long to get pizookis out. She was also incompetent when we asked to redeem some points/coupon on our frequent diner account. So it took even longer to sort out the bill. Overall, terrible service from Jessica."
Jenefer R.,"Santa Clara, CA",128,37,24,2.0,3/29/2013,"Seriously the worse service and it's not just at this BJ's. The server never came back to ask us if we needed refills, it took her 15 minutes to come back and check on us from when we got out food, and paying was so annoying given we had to ask her 3 times  for the bill. I am a server myself so I tend to understand if the service isn't on point and I see the server running around with other tables but no one helped us and we even had to flag down other servers which I personally don't really like to do but it's not like we had our server taking care of us. I definitely don't love the food here so I could live without it but their pizookies are to die for."
Emily G.,"San Carlos, CA",15,160,,1.0,6/10/2010,"Really, really noisy. We've been several times, but never was the service so slow nor the food so lousy. My Santa Fe salad with shrimp was drenched in cayenne and buried in tortilla strips. No cheese to be found, but tons of salt.  The meatloaf sandwich--angus beef? Mostly bread crumbs. Onion rings too skinny and greasy, and mashed potatoes were positively not of this world with a consistency like some food stylist's synthetic creation. The gravy was hideous and inedible. Service was unbelievably slow for 4:30 on a Thursday, overly chatty and intrusive, plus constant pushing of drinks on us. Hardly worth reviewing, but there it is."
Alain K.,"Redwood City, CA",355,79,2,1.0,6/25/2012,"0 stars!!!!! Why? We sat for 1.5 hours and did not get any food........ WTF!!!!! Oh, I am sorry the Italy/England game is more important than the guests who order. Short story shorter, it was the whole section we were sitting in and I had a chance to watch the pass the food comes from and not one dish came out for 1 hour durring the end of the match then miraculously food comes out 10 minutes after Italy wins.. Sorriest excuse of customer services ever!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Toni H.,"Oakland, CA",30,59,,4.0,3/24/2011,I am not sure why there is so much hate for the BJ's - it is a chain restaurant people... With that being said I think for a chain it's good.  Lot's of food selections lots of beer!  Really what more could you want.   They have a great gluten free selection including a gluten free pizza that is delish!!!!  Plus 3 gluten free beer/cider choices.   I also really recommend the hamburger pizza it sounds so gross - but trust me it is delish!!!!!! With extra pickles - you are just going to have to trust me on this one.   Subtract one star for charging $6.25 for a pear cider... come on people that is ridiculous!!!!  I will stick with ice tea from now on.   The only other thing is that there is ALWAYS a wait it usually goes quick but for whatever reason this place is always packed.  First come first served in bar.   High fives for the great happy hour specials!!!!!
