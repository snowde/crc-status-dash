Amanda A.,"San Mateo, CA",1,45,,2.0,6/21/2013,"Come here a few times for sit down and once for take out.  Half the staff we've interacted with have been snooty, the other okay.  Not very knowledgable.  Generally, we don't feel that welcome here.  Food is pretty good, as expected for a place like this.  Take out was better because it was faster."
Tyrone V.,"Novato, CA",64,287,9,3.0,12/15/2008,"FYI, I love BJ's as a restaurant chain, but this BJ's is my least favorite I've been to, and I've been to quite a few... If I could give this restaurant 3&1/2 stars, I would... Pros: Not overly crowded. Pizza is excellent. Clean and modern-looking restaurant. Friendly service. Cons: Slow to be seated (even as a couple with reservations). Service is slow, especially when it comes to alcoholic drinks. Somewhat expensive. My girlfriend and I went here on a Saturday night. There were a few open tables, which I thought was a good sign because I've had to wait a long time to be seated at other very-crowded BJ's locations. But it still took us about ten minutes to be seated (minus a star right there). And then minus another half-star for how long it took our server to get our drinks out. I ordered a pale ale and my girlfriend ordered a pom punch. The pale ale was bitter, but not the face-squishing bitter, but that's to be expected. The pom punch had just the right amount of sweetness, although a bit on the light side alcohol-wise. But other than that, the food here is always excellent, and if you don't mind waiting for good food, then come here..."
M W.,"Portland, OR",0,10,,2.0,11/18/2012,"Was traveling for work and in need of a good beer and simple pub fare....really not sure why it was as busy as it was on a Tuesday night.  It took 15 minutes to get seated as a single.  The IPA I sampled was good - a hearty and hoppy ale. The food though was very pedestrian.  I should have seen it coming with the boring iceberg lettuce house salad - iceberg lettuce, carrots, and some red cabbage - you call that a salad?   Finished off with an open faced chili cheese burger which was overcome with cheese and mass produced chili.  Contrary to other reviews the service was OK but somewhat unusual in that I was brought my check while eating my entree. Seemed like this was the practice as my server did this with the table next to me as well."
Jon L.,"Satellite Beach, FL",1,60,22,3.0,8/7/2011,"Stopped here the other night while waiting for a delayed flight at SFO.  I'm glad we got there at 6pm...it was packed after that. Food was good, drinks too. Nothing really out of the ordinary for a BJ's. Pretty much what I expected."
Jaime L.,"Santa Monica, CA",1450,1057,137,4.0,1/29/2008,"I give them four stars for getting me drunk on multiple occasions without having to spend THAT much money...and for having friends who work there, who also worked feverishly on getting as many discounts as they possibly could on our check. Sometimes, though, I'll warn you--the service is TERRIBLE. More often than not you'll get someone who actually CARES and tah-dah! You have your food at your table, beer in your pint glass and a smile on your face followed by slurred words of happiness.  They brew their own beers, and a sampler is nice if you want to get drunk quicker. The combination of 7 different beers is a doozy ,even if you don't like some of them. I personally go for the following: A blonde, followed by a shot of Patron Silver with a taster of Hefewizen.  For food...hmm..I've tasted almost everything. I worked here. Oh, forgot to mention that part...so yeah. I know my shit. And its really, really good. Their Santa Fe Spring Rolls are delectable. Start with their Best Beginnings or a thin crust appetizer pizza (OMG THOSE ARE SO GOOD TOMATO AND BASIL MMGLORHSFHFFF). I like the following, from their menu: Jambalya. Goodness Gracious...that is so wonderful. Don't ask questions. Fucking eat it. Their pastas, pizzas, and entree selections are superb! Fish tacos...sound a little fishy to me. Kinda weird. Baked potatoes aren't super awesome, just good if you want something to fill you up with carbohydrates so you can't walk out later.  Word of advice: Get a pizookie. Not for the faint at heart, because it is magical. It comes out so gooey and hot and wonderful, you wonder where it's been all your life. Plus, whenever you order one some of the money goes towards a charity for a disease that one of the owner's daughter has.  All in all, really good place. I leave stumbling most of the time. It might be a dressed up TGI Fridays--but at least BJ's is GOOD! Plus their name alone gives them that extra invisible star."
Joy L.,"San Mateo, CA",2,20,,1.0,8/25/2012,"Food and service really went down hill. We used to go there once at week. The last 3 times we were there, we had really bad experiences. We talked to the manager about our salad being watery, and she just said ""this is the first time I heard this"", and that was it.... no apologies or an offer to exchange our food. We will not return."
Kristinna B.,"San Mateo, CA",174,65,,3.0,4/20/2011,"Good FOOD...BAD Service!!! Me, my family, and my friends always use to come here alot because the food is really good, and I love the different things they try but I have to say the service was horrible. Ok I understand that waiters/waitress get stressed out, but we were not rude at all and just toatlly got ignored, and other peoples food was served before us even after they got there before us. I never really took the time to notice but I just think they could step up there service game, We probably saw our waiter 3 times, and then I had to hunt him down to get re-fills and my tab....smh! oh well we found a new place to celebrate all of our BIRTHDAYS & SPECIAL OCCASIONS."
Robert H.,"San Mateo, CA",601,68,5,4.0,4/4/2011,"Only a place like BJ's can you fill four people up on ONE pizza with a few rounds of beer and have everybody's grand total to be around $18 dollars a person (before tip). And that's the bottom line, BECAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO (just kidding). But yeah, BJ's is quite good in that, they really know how to make their food. Sure, the menu has its identity crisis but everything that you order is worth the wait, and if you're over 21 you can drink a beer at the bar before your table is called.  And as far as the bottom line goes, that really is it. You can really spend around $18 dollars a person (if you wanna be cheap on the tip) and have a good amount of pizza and beer in you."
Olma M.,"South San Francisco, CA",295,395,704,2.0,1/12/2007,"Came here for a quick break after shopping at the neighboring Target store and almost immediately regretted the decision to dine here.  My friend wondered why she always returns to this particular restaurant location when she's only experienced slow, bad service. Well, this day was no exception.  The place had a decent crowd, but there were plenty of open tables.  This restaurant seems a bit bigger than the Tanforan, San Bruno one, but it could be the open layout (not sure about max. capacity at either restaurant).   We were greeted as soon as we entered and seated within a few minutes.  But it was downhill after that.  It took forever for our server to finally meet us, take our drink/meal orders, and bring our drinks to us.  Who knew an Arnold Palmer and coffee could take so long?  They even had my order wrong (what's so difficult about ""no mayo, please!?""). I have to admit, however, that the Sweet Onion Strings here truly saved the day - ""mouth-watery crunchy perfection"" baby!  I hate to admit it, but I'll likely return.  I'm craving for those onion strings just typing about it..."
Bassman Z.,"Redwood City, CA",16,76,11,2.0,7/8/2010,"I try to avoid huge chain restaurants like BJ's and refrain from reviewing them most of the time b/c you know it's always the same crap from joints like these no matter which location you visit. For whatever reason I feel compelled to review my latest of ""business as usual"" experiences at BJ's.  To begin I have to say that they are extremely over priced for the re-warmed frozen slop they serve. The beers are not what I'm looking for in a ""brewery"". The IPA left me with a nasty headache. Inevitably when you go to BJ's your server will change at least twice. It's really annoying to have the early 20's kid come over mid meal to tell you they're gonna be taking care of me. I don't care who you are just make sure my beer doesn't sit empty on the table for too long. I did enjoy the avocado eggrolls but had to wonder what kind of impossible to pronounce preservatives they contain. They taste like a heart attack which I don't mind once in a while. I ordered a burger med rare and the bottom bun was almost soaked through by the time it got to my table. That's not proper.  Overall I think this place is best suited to after work happy hour w/ the coworkers. Don't bother taking a date here."
Sam H.,"San Mateo, CA",170,10,6,1.0,5/6/2013,We had an annoying server that messed up my check and had to redo my entire transaction. Not happy at all. You get a star cause the warriors game was playing.
Michael T.,"Millbrae, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/19/2013,Horrible service. The staffs piss pour attitudes made the experience Ohhh so enjoyable. This place is the drizzling Sh!ts.
Joe L.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",117,44,4,5.0,4/27/2013,"I don't like reviewing chain restaurants. This location does have a very friendly and attentive staff, however, and the food and beer have always been outstanding. I had a rum and coke once that I thought was weak. They're open late."
Stella C.,Hong Kong,293,659,271,4.0,10/22/2008,"Their pizza is so fluffy with a crispy crust (kind of like the pizza hut one but soo much better), and the BJ's favorite or whatever it's called is the best! Their giant baked potatoes cannot be beat - the garden veggie is the best ever! It's topped with vegetables and alfredo sauce (and they even give you extra alfredo sauce). Their house salad is pretty good but it's missing some ingredients; namely, red onions, cheese, and more of the purple cabbage.  Since they're a brewery, you just have to try something off the list. I had the Berry Cider which was cute (like a pink/purple almost) and was really delicious! I don't (can't!) drink beer, so cider is as close as I can get. I've never hI am definitely going to be ordered every time I come here. My ordering strategy for a party of 2: 1 small pizza and 1 potato and of course: THE PIZOOKIE!!! I'm sure all three of these things are dishes you can make at home, but you can NEVER EVER make it the way they do. They are truly a master at their craft of pizookies.  I never thought I'd crave chain restaurant food until I met BJ's."
Cherry B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,20,3,4.0,4/25/2011,"This is the goto place if you are looking to hangout with some friends, have few beers and eat lots of fatty/fried food! The menu is pretty good with many vegetarian options and small size appetizers. Nice desserts too. Tip: Be prepared to wait, there is usually a line"
Sophie P.,"San Francisco, CA",68,116,64,5.0,5/24/2012,Came here for mothers day 2012 ad man oh man was I pleasantly surprised. Frat of all I live in or around the city. The closest BJs is in San Bruno but they are always consistently booked and there is usually a wait. Not at this location. It even seems a bit bigger and way more mellow. Our food was prepared beautifully and our waitress was okay. I never really liked this restaurant until mothers day this year. I am officially a fan and will actually keep coming to this location only. I can't handle San Bruno I just can't .
Igor P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,13,,1.0,6/29/2010,"First I will talk about the things I liked about BJ's. I loved their onion strings; they're not on the menu, but they'll make them for you if you order them. The waiter was friendly. Now on to the bad. We ordered medium-rare burgers. We got burgers that had no pink in them whatsoever. While it's not like they were completely well-done, they were not even medium, more like medium to well done. We called over the manager and sent them back. I insisted that I have some pink in mine. When we got our burgers I got mine with some pink but my friend got his well done again. He just gave up and ate it because we don't have the time to sit around waiting for the people in the kitchen to finally make one as ordered. I don't know why they brought the fries back with the burger and brought us new fries, though. Especially since I had wedges and got thinly cut fries the second time. I also asked them to change the channel back to the fight I was watching and they said they couldn't do it. At least the burger was good. I also finished my friend's strawberry lemonade and it was overly sweet, but still delicious. But overall I did not have a wonderful time."
Roxanne K.,"El Macero, CA",190,128,1,4.0,1/2/2011,"This review is for their happy hour.  The $5 mini pizzas are a great deal. The drink specials aren't so hot, but at least they are discounted... Plus, during all NFL games, it's happy hour! Service has always been great and even when I've been here 10 min til happy hour ending, we're always greeted by a server to take our orders so it makes it on time! I'd suggest coming here with a group of 6 or less to make it easier to grab a table since it's 1st come, 1st served... Parking is fairly easy since it's in a shopping plaza."
Jennifer D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",83,182,22,2.0,11/30/2012,"I have to say overall the food tastes just like any other BJ's restaurant, it is what is expected of BJ's, just ok.  I will add though that every time I come, their pizookies are not as gooey and hot as I would like them.  Instead they are kind of dry and crispy; not what a pizookie is supposed to taste like.  The reason I gave BJs such a low rating is because the service is absolutely horrible!  We came here around 1:15 in the afternoon, way after the lunch rush and it took FOREVER for the waiter to come take our order and then even longer for them to get our food out and again an eternity for him to come bring us our check.  I hate when service is bad!"
Dan B.,"San Francisco, CA",4996,595,383,3.0,12/24/2007,"It's nice when a chain restaurant can come along and provide decent food and drink. All I was looking for was a burger and brew, but this place did so much more. * * *  So before I go any further, let me say we were lucky to find a seat in the bar area because the wait to get seated can get a little insane. * * * I was pleasantly surprised by how good the burger was.  It was nothing fancy: cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles on a toasted bun.  But it really hit the spot; although,  I'm not big on the wedge fries. If you get a chance to try their wings, you should.  Good stuff. Also, if you like dark beer, try their Porter."
