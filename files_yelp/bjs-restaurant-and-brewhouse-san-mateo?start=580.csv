Delius C.,"San Mateo, CA",33,14,,2.0,5/26/2010,The first time I went to this BJ's it took over an hour for them to get our food served. UNACCEPTABLE!!!  After a couple of years I revisited them with my kids and this time it took 35minutes. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is becuase the manager actually noticed and came by to apologize. Maybe in 2 more years it'll only take 20 minutes and the manager won't have to apologize.
John H.,"San Francisco, CA",30,822,93,3.0,11/19/2012,"Mini pizzas are half off at happy hour. Woot!  However, it could have been warmer. The cheese was melted on top, but the sauce under was still cold. The management should slow down that pizza heating track."
Shafaq C.,"San Francisco, CA",36,126,20,4.0,12/9/2009,"I like chains. Yeah, I know, that's almost sort of taboo in SF...but I'm an LA girl where we've got a lot of chains and you know what? The food isn't bad. BJs is a great example. Lots of variety, everything from sandwiches to pizza to pastas.  My fav is actually the chicago style pizza -- deep dish and oh so yummy. Try the vegetarian -- even if you're a meaty, its a good pizza and you might not even notice that the meat is missing. I've had some of the pastas which have been good too, and the garden vegetable baked potato is awesome. If you want the mom and pop restaurant feel, or some really authentic ethnic food, this is not the place for you. If you want just some good quality american food and maybe watch a game on the flat screens, go to Bjs and have a good time."
Cynthia C.,"Alameda, CA",328,1967,11386,3.0,7/20/2006,"A chain that is pretty consistent in quality, but the service is spotty.  This particular location and visit was pleasant, I'm sure that the time had a lot to do with the it: we arrived at 10pm.   I love the roominess, warm maple wood, ample booth seating and extra high ceilings.  No claustrophobia here!  It's nice and ventilated so you don't smell like the kitchen upon leaving.  Major plus.   The food is alright, standard, I'm not a fan of the very blah salads here, last night I ordered the roasted half chicken, tender, meaty, but a little salty.  They mention on the menu there is no added oil or butter.  Plus they give you an ample amount of steamed veggies on the side.   My dining companion had the turkey cobb sandwich, seriously it was huge, and it came with a side of 'fries', the nice fries that are wedged and battered with some excellent seasoning.  Yes, like the ones at KFC, delicious.  They held their crunch till the end of the meal.  The server was more than accomodating when my friend wanted chicken in place of turkey.   Skip the pizookie, I still don't get why people rave about this, it's a freakin' cookie with Rite Aid ice cream on top.  Really, it's not a culinary creation."
a r.,"Foster City, CA",0,5,,3.0,8/29/2013,"Have eaten there several times in the last couple of months. Food is variable-- many dishes are good, but avoid the pot roast open face sandwich with mashed potatoes, this is a misconceived dish. Also, the side salad is... a wan, sad little plate of lettuce that has seen better days. What's been good: things like fried calamari, fries, fish and chips, burgers, etc.; and the beer selection, which should have something for everyone. (I wish they had a better cider selection.) In the past I've had their thin crust pizzas, which I really like. Also, having calorie counts next to everything helps with smart choices, and they have a special menu with an assortment of low-calorie, satisfying offerings that are worth trying.  Also, surprisingly, it's fairly kid-friendly. When my wife and I go with our two year old we generally have a good experience.  Service can be a little uneven and slow, but is always polite and well-intentioned. I don't much like the indoor space but now that they have the outdoor patio, it's really a nice place to spend a late afternoon."
Drew C.,"San Mateo, CA",2,5,,1.0,6/12/2012,"I usually frequent this place after basketball with my friends to grab a bite and brew, and I haven't had any problems. But as I'm currently sitting here chatting with my friends and being ignored by our server, I have not one problem, but a few. #1: we walk in and sit ourselves down at a table in the bar area, granted, it is busy, but everyone was finishing up as the basketball game was ending. We wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by somebody and order a round of waters and a diet coke before we get to the good stuff. So we patiently wait for our waters, which they dropped off promptly after about 10 more minutes, without a diet coke. #2: 15 minutes after our drinks are dropped off, our server is nowhere in sight. And when she does walk by, she completely ignores us, and our attempts to get her attention. More time passes and we have a new server, whom we remind of our lost diet coke, and also order from. I order a salad, my friends a pasta and potato wedges.  #3: we've now been sitting for an hour, and are still staring at an empty table with empty bellies, sitting in bewilderment, and vowing not to return. Our food comes and we've simply stopped keeping track of how much time has passed and I ravage my salad that took impossibly long to arrive. Now I almost bumped this review up because they acknowledged the fact that they took eons to serve us and gave us some extra potato wedges, and my salad was very good. But the ultimate serving fail, and enormous amount of time passed, was enough to deter us from returning anytime soon..."
Robert S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,20,,2.0,6/15/2013,"We had a group of people doing a one-time going away party for a friend, and were hoping for a large table, or at least a few tables together.  Instead they put us in the bar area in a booth that only sat four.  There was no offer to move tables or chairs around so we could sit together.  There wasn't even someone to take drink orders.  When I gave up and tried to move a chair nearer so I could sit with them I was told it was not allowed. The waiter was rude, arrogant, authoritative, and made no effort whatsoever to actually serve us in any way.  I will not be back, and the 500+ people where we work will surely all hear what happened."
Sara K.,"Newark, CA",185,384,87,2.0,8/31/2008,"I'll have to admit, the first time I had the pazookie, I was ready to pass out from how good it was. With that said, the next few times I've been to BJ's, I haven't enjoyed the pazookie as much. It seems like it gets sweeter and sweeter each time, making it unbearable to digest. Oh, and almost every time, guaranteed, the service sucks. Day or night, wherever you sit. It sucks. Their food is mediocre at best. But by the time the food comes, you've been so frustrated and upset with the service that the food becomes unappetizing.  Add all of that to the unending wait for this place, and you get at least one person who never wants to go back. That person is me."
Bernadette W.,"San Mateo, CA",97,199,38,4.0,2/28/2010,"So this restaurant is about two blocks from our house, which means we are frequent visitors. It amazes us that every time we go it seems like they have all new staff. We know this isn't possible, but we comment on that every time. I like their ""to go"" option, but I find that the person at the takeout desk is always a bit stressed out. Overall the food is pretty good and the waitstaff is friendly and attentive. I like their shrimp lettuce wrap and the pizzas are pretty good - both flatbread and deep dish. There was only one time when our table was completely forgotten. Once they realized that we'd been overlooked,  however, they made up for it with a free appetizer."
Lorraine G.,"San Francisco, CA",29,77,129,3.0,1/12/2011,"I eat here sporadically, but I've been here twice within the past 4 weeks.  No, the food is not so delicious that I was craving it. Visit #1: Co-worker suggested soup and salad for lunch.  Unlimited soup and salad for $8...can't be too bad.  I had a bowl of clam chowder and their house salad with Italian dressing.  Clam chowder was good.  You really can't mess up a salad since it requires zero cooking.  I'd highly recommend dressing on the side.  My salad was drenched in Italian dressing and was really sour. Visit #2: Most recently we had lunch catered for the office.  We had chardonnay shrimp pasta, rotini alfredo, spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce, house salad and caesar salad with a side of garlic bread.  I tend to stay away from cream based sauces so I can only comment on the spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce.  The spicy tomato sauce was quite spicy so if you can't take the heat, don't order it.  Otherwise, it tasted like spaghetti.  The house salad had crumbled feta which was good.  However, they need to learn to crumble the feta so that it's evenly distributed.  The garlic bread was awful.  The bread was dry and chewy and all I could taste was butter. We've had pizza catered a few times and I think it's way better than their pastas."
praveen d.,"Redwood City, CA",2,9,,3.0,4/11/2013,"Loved the Irish red beer, And as usual great pizzas. Must try place. Bit expensive"
Victor V.,"Elk Grove, CA",25,20,6,5.0,7/5/2014,ive been to bjs before. the food is good . just left sf firework show and it was hard to find a good place without lots of bad reviews or cash only. thanx for  being open late bjs
Jessica K.,"Augusta, GA",366,1203,1284,2.0,6/12/2008,"Oh God, I hate all of you people who recommended this place on Yelp. I trusted you!!!! They're open till midnight (did they mention, they mean the bar, not the restaurant is open till midnight??) They don't have a full menu at night. Uh huh... They don't have soup. (They accidentally threw it out.) They don't have clean tables. (We stood there in the middle of the dining room while the server/host looked around at the manager who did NOTHING.  *Deep breath now* The menu with the deep dish pizzas and ripped off versions of all that is CPK and Chilis related made me realize why everyone tell me not to eat here. Too bad it's so close to the hockey rink though. Our server was wonderful, even if he was going back to San Diego and away from his dying grandmother (his words, not mine.) Deep Dish Pizza: medicore Appetizers: unimaginative and cold! unfortunately Soup: defrosted? Beer: not baaaaad Server: knew how to work the pity points Pasta: Clumpy and unseasoned Desserts: Prepackaged but who doesn't love chocolate still? Overall, I guess I'll stay away from chain restaurants. When the server came back to inform us they accidentally threw away the soup, I noticed the manager flirting with the host up in the front. Nice. Anyone ever see ""Waiting?"" Yeah, creepy manager flirting with underage chick cliche? Check and check.  If this place had a decent menu that wasn't stuffed with everything from every other chain restaurant, they'd have a decent chance. But no, no, they're doomed."
Michael H.,"San Mateo, CA",1,134,8,2.0,12/14/2012,So-so service. I always freeze my balls off here.  Like the beer and Ahi tuna saled tho...
Gloria H.,"San Francisco, CA",474,1486,8232,4.0,9/17/2007,"4 stars = Cory!  Cory is such a cutie and so pleasant.  Glad we decided to try the bar instead of waiting for a table.  We found 2 chairs at the corner and were helped right away by Luis (?).  He recommended the Jeremiah Red, gave me a small pour and that did the trick.  Hubby tried the Nutty Brewnette.  We eventually tried all and the Jeremiah Red is indeed the best - truly, don't bother with others.  We got an order of the nachos, big portion!  It went so well with the cold beer.   Also got the chop chop salad - cool and refreshing, just wish they used good salami but it was still tasty.  The food came pretty quickly...we are certain it was faster than those waiting in the dining room. The wait staff is very friendly and all so young!  This is definitely a place for a younger crowd to hang out in - all the colorful drinks filled w/ calories!  One of the more popular cocktail is over 2000 calories!!! Go there for what it is and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Oh, this is one of very few places that opens 'till 1am!"
Ryan B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/4/2015,"This restaurant is around the corner from my office so we frequent it.  Earlier today I placed an order online for my office staff and our office manager went to pick it up.  The order was for five items and she went over there at 12:15 pm to pick it up.  BJ's first of all didn't have the order in their system because of a ""system gliche.""  The manager finally came out and said it takes time for an order that big and she should just be patient.  The order wasn't done until 1:45 pm!  She was waiting for over an hour and a half and on top of that when we began eating three of the five orders were wrong!  They forgot a salad and screwed up two other orders.  It is very disappointing and I caution ANYONE who plans on coming here.  Their staff was rude and terrible and taking over an hour and a half for a to go order is absolutely ridiculous.  On top of that the manager was rude and condescending.  They will no longer be getting our business and I will go out of my way to caution others from coming here."
Hema K.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",344,928,281,4.0,2/22/2010,"This is a cool place located in Bridgepointe parkway.   Love their lunch menu.  Sandwich and soup are the best you can get for $7 bucks..  Always come here with my lunch buddy whenever we feel like trying their soup, sandwich and wedge potatoes - yummo!! Came here with couple of my friends/date for drinks.. their martinis are my favorite.  The parking lot is pretty huge and I even walked around the shopping hub just to sober up lol.."
Vivian L.,"San Francisco, CA",315,377,127,1.0,12/28/2011,"Came here for a family friend's birthday and was very disappointed. We thought things were going to get better, but we found hair in the jumbalaya. Service was good though. The peach ice tea had a lot of syrup dumped in. And the angel hair pasta was supposed to be a light type of pasta, but they used cottage cheese, thus making this food really salty and filling. We also ordered pot roast beef with mashed potato and it was way too salty! To a point where the salt would stay on your tongue even hours after. They were nice enough to take the jumbalaya off the bill, due to our surprising discovery! I think we were more surprised than Columbus finding out this ""New World!"" Holy Cr@p. I can imagine Columbus' expression!! I would not be back.."
Kathy D.,"Union City, CA",58,82,,4.0,10/26/2009,"If I had to give a restaurant the honorary title of  ""KATHY'S FAVORITE CHAIN,"" BJ's would be it. It has a huge menu selection, a brewery, and offers one of my favorite desserts in the world! I don't know any chain that meets all those criteria.  Yardhouse might be cutting it close, but BJ's steals the title with their oh so sweet, warm, softly baked, chewy-gooey cookie (it's not fully cooked and it tastes amazing), topped with a scoop of the creamy cold vanilla bean ice cream. Warm and cold, chewy and creamy - I love everything about that PIZOOKIE! I know, it's just a cookie and ice cream, but that thing can be the cure to any bad day! I've been to 3 BJ's locations.  On food selection and taste alone, BJ's is definitely a 4 star for me. The service is inconsistent from different locations.  When I don't want to bump into locals and actually have good service, I'll opt for the San Mateo location. On my numerous occasions to BJ's in Newark, I've always hated the service.  Pros: - Large selection - Great Lunch deal - Happy Hour ($1 off draft beers and cocktails, and appetizer deals) - Call ahead seating - San Mateo has a great staff Cons: - Gets packed at night (so make sure you do call ahead) - San Mateo doesn't have outdoor seating Recommendations: - Get to Happy Hour quickly on a Friday - YOU CAN NOT LEAVE WITHOUT A PIZOOKIE (I prefer 1/2 white chocolate macadamia and 1/2 oreo) - Big fan of the baked potato and clam chowder soup! - Piranha pale ale"
Ladi Da A.,"San Francisco, CA",661,494,194,5.0,5/9/2010,"LADIES - cute waiter alert! Cute waiter alert! Ahh, as if I didn't LOVE BJ'S enough already!!! BJ's has good food, good drinks...and if you get there on a night with a not-so-cute crowd, hopefully you'll be lucky like we were last Friday night and get their super CUTE waiter/sometimes bartender. Um, 6'2"", very attentive, gives awesome service (lol) and very bom-chicka-wah-wah! Get it ladies, GET IT! *teehee!*"
