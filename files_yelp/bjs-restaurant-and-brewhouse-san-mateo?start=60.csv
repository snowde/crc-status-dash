David G.,"Edmonton, Canada",19,126,14,4.0,5/11/2017,"Came here with a large group from work.  Food was good but not exceptional.  Except the Avacado eggrolls which were exceptional. Had peanut chucker in soba noodles.  Tasty with a nice spicy bite. Their beer was great.  Lots of selection on Brewhouse beer.  I had a red Ang it was just right.  Ang for desert they sell these warm cookies with Icecream. As good as it sounds. Two issues, out of all ciders, and service was slow. . We waited a long time to order and get stuff."
Morgan H.,"San Bruno, CA",240,2,,2.0,7/17/2017,"I have been to this location before but this was my first time sitting in the bar area. It was a shorter wait time so we decided it should be fine to get in and out quick. It was not quick. By the time our waitress came to our table we were ready to order everything. We got our food in a timely manner but we were not checked in on for about 30 minutes since we got our food and by then we were almost ready for the check by that point.  The worst part of the service was that we had asked for a box before the check arrived and once we put a card out for the payment she grabbed that assuring she would grab us boxes. When she walked away she kept bouncing around from table to table which is fine, that's her job. Our boxes for the food finally arrived shortly she dropped off our card back to us. I have never asked for a box multiple times like this or had a box delivered to the table so late in any restaurant experience of mine and it just makes me think that BJs is an unprofessional establishment."
Mara M.,"San Mateo, CA",0,12,,4.0,4/18/2017,"The food is comparable to other BJ's in the area.  The service is variable. The menu is *huge*, and offers several vegetarian options."
Emily C.,"CA, CA",21,11,,1.0,4/1/2017,"We are usually happy with the services when we go here. However, tonight, we were there for 20 mins. Seated at a table that was dirty and there were multiple staff standing around. NO ONE acknowledged us, or even offered us water while we were looking at the menu.  Our little one was getting fussy and had we had even a cup of water for her, she wouldn't have started to get fussy. 20 mins and we just got up and left. No one even tried to stop us. We passed a person who looked like a manager who didn't even seem remotely concerned what was going on. That manager was one of the staff just standing. Around by our dirty table. Mind you, this was at 5p on a Sat night ad it wasn't even busy in the establishment yet."
Andrei K.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/3/2017,"One of the worst place to go. Tables are always open but nobody get sited. Always excuses like ""not enough waiters"", ""kitchen overloaded"" etc. I don't understand this business model... food is just mediocre."
David G.,"San Mateo, CA",4,4,,4.0,9/22/2017,"The food has been consistently good for the price we pay and the service has never disappointed. I love the fact it's a casual restaurant with a bar that has multiple TVs , a great selection of drinks and tasty appetizers."
Linda R.,"Belmont, CA",12,2,,4.0,12/11/2017,"Big shout out to Javier, Stephanie and Crizzel (hope I spelled this right) for consistently providing excellent service - even when the restaurant is super busy!!!"
Jackie W.,"Menlo Park, CA",26,13,8,1.0,3/19/2017,Grossest restaurant bathrooms ever. I've been in dive bar bathrooms at 2am that were less trashed than this. (Photos included)
Georgia G.,"Foster City, CA",65,19,3,3.0,9/30/2017,"This venue is so promising with its sports bar vibe, big screen televisions and a variety of seating options. Alas the service was drab today (seemed like unhappy staff who need some morale boosting or a pep talk or whatever from their employers) and the food took a long time and was cold when served (I had a burger) and lackluster in flavor."
Rex C.,"Burlingame, CA",10,3,,5.0,7/4/2017,"This review is for the beer My favorite is the Tatonka Stout (8.5% ABV) A pic of the beer menu: List of the beers with alcohol by volume; if you click on the beer names, it will give you some more info Map of Bay Area microbreweries: Props to this program by BJs -"
Sophia Y.,"San Mateo, CA",816,1408,2385,3.0,2/8/2017,"Bumping my star up a little. The Pizookie - warm, fresh baked cookie of your choice with a scoop of ice cream on time = heaven. Just come here for that. I still think the food isn't that great."
Dlareg M.,"Daly City, CA",2,6,3,1.0,9/23/2017,"They said, ""come we can seat your party of 22 by 7:30pm!"" It's now 10:30 pm and still waiting on food. Let that sink in."
Sean G.,"Linden, NJ",1,2,3,1.0,8/8/2017,"If you want poor service and long wait times for appetizers then this is the place to come. They served us cold spinach dip, we then waited another 20 minutes for them to serve the same spinach dip again. By that time I sent it back to the kitchen when it came late again.  The pizookie are great but service here usually sucks when they are busy"
Cindy H.,"Santa Clara, CA",15,12,4,5.0,9/6/2017,Every time I go to bj seems my pizza gets dropped accidentally and everyone apologizes that have to wait again! I seem to get a free dessert awesome!! It's ok with me because I wasn't in a hurry!
Julie L.,"Redwood City, CA",345,136,266,2.0,7/30/2016,"I generally love BJ's, the service, the brews, and the food. However, after 3 consecutive negative experiences, I think two stars are necessary. I have always loved the pasta and flatbreads at BJs. I've also enjoyed eating pizookies and drinking their ambers, however, I think this location just has staff and waiters who aren't trained properly. Came here with a large group of friends and started off ordering a salad. I know large groups are difficult to deal with AND I had an allergy request, but it took three tries and over an hour before I got my food. I'm allergic to tomatoes and nuts. Our waiter came back after we had ordered to tell me that something in the salad contained nuts and it could not be made without nuts, so he had me order something else off of the allergen menu. I ordered a club flatbread. The waiter didn't hear the flatbread part, and I ended up with a club sandwich. Later, the waiter brought me the flatbread that I ordered but forgot about my tomato allergy. So about 30 minutes after the last attempt, after my friends had finished eating, I finally received the flatbread that I wasn't allergic to.  I came back here again for lunch with my dad and had a mishap with the bill. My dad had ordered the salmon and couscous for lunch. But our waiter charged us for a dinner sized portion. My dad didn't mind paying the more expensive meal, however, he wanted to point out that it wasn't what he ordered. The waiter was very rude and insisted he was correct and my father was in the wrong. Then he said he would adjust the price of the meal and make it the lunch price instead. But had to add that it was my father's mistake. Later when the final bill came, we saw that he didn't adjust the price at all. However, after waiting 30 minutes for him to get us the bill, we were tired of waiting and left just paid the bill and left. On a third recent experience, we were served what seemed to be scraps of mushrooms as ""stuffed mushrooms."" Upon first glance, the mushrooms seemed to be leftover scraps of mushrooms, some whole, some pieces, some tiny. Then we actually took a bite and realized that they were cold. Not room temperature or lukewarm, but cold. We asked our waiter if their stuffed mushrooms were supposed to be cold, and she seemed surprised and replied no. We were just very confused as to how this was an appetizer you would actually serve people. Also at this dinner, we ordered flatbread pizzas, which were uncut or only cut in half. And after pointing that out to the waitress, she just gave us steak knives for us to cut our flatbreads ourselves. After these three confusing and unpleasant recent experiences, I just hope other BJs haven't fallen to this level. I truly hope employees at this BJs will be trained to a higher level in the future so that the quality of this restaurant doesn't continue to drop."
Stacy M.,"Redwood City, CA",15,18,26,4.0,8/29/2017,"The server is awesome, friendly knowledgeable and informative and he's on his second double of the week."
Diver N.,"San Leandro, CA",1,4,,2.0,11/18/2017,"Great food, bad service. and understaffed. Ordered takeout for curbside pick up. Arrived curbside, called at least a dozen times for 10 mins, but nobody answered so decided to go inside instead to pick up. Stood in line for about 20 mins just to pick up the order. Told them we had called from curbside several times about half an hour ago - no apologies at all. On the way out, another BJ employee had the balls to tell us that the curbside parking was only for those who need curbside service. WTH!"
Rommel S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,4,1.0,1/27/2017,"I've just ordered a tortilla soup here to go, i specifically said a large tortilla soup I said a large size, they never mentioned on the phone that it only came In one size. But having eaten there and given the option of a small portion and a large portion (in 2 sizes). I always would assume I can do that to go as well. But no!!!!!!they charged me 7.90 for a measly size which I had gobbled down in less than 4 minutes. SO!!!!! NEVER HAD I FELT IVE BEEN ROBBED EVERSINCE THE GOLDRUSH EXCEPT WHEN I GOT THE F.......g size of a large soup in my life in this money thieving BJ RESTAURANT IN BRIDGEPOINTE IN SAN MATEO, so if you want to waste your money....your hard earned money, if you want to give it away!!!!! EAT HERE......and feel like a republican. But if you want your money's worth......I strongly suggest you go to MANCORA OR EMELINAS REST. On el camino. BELIEVE ME.... NEGATIVE FOR BJS"
Christine T.,"Danville, CA",4470,648,905,4.0,6/3/2016,"The picture doesn't do it justice...my burger was DELICIOUS.  Two times in the same week, I had a cheeseburger that was worth every calorie!! It was cooked perfect and just plain good.  The fries are thin and crispy.  The service was great.  The Warriors were on (and winning).  An overall great experience."
Ninja R.,"Tracy, CA",0,31,15,1.0,9/15/2017,Well I can't rate the food here since we never actually got to eat. Checked the website for wait list status before we got here it said open no wait. Ok... It's 530 on a Friday that's dinner rush time and you should be staffed accordingly (I worked as a server for 15 years and that's my experience) the host took his time to seat two groups of 2 in front of us then slowly walked over and asked how many I told him 3. Without blinking he said 15 minute wait.  There were open tables and booths  everywhere. I pointed this out and he mentioned there was no server. A huffy girl took us all the way in the back to a dirty table with no menus.  We left.  Not worth the effort to eat here.
