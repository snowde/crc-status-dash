corey w.,"Belmont, CA",120,12,6,1.0,6/18/2014,"Came here on a wed night, wasn't very busy but took forever to get our food! We only ordered 4 small dishes and waited at least 45 mins.. Im usually pretty understanding about waiting for food but our waitress never checked up on us to apologize for the wait or update us on when our food should be out. Usually bjs isn't bad, but out waitress was just horrible. Her name is Anahid and she was just oblivious to us. After about 20-30 mins of just waiting, we started to look around as if we needed something and she just turned away to ignore us. I even saw her on her phone at one point. We almost got up and left. We waited 45+mins, got our food, finished, and sat and waited some more. A large group came way later than us, and got their food right after we got ours! i don't understand why we had to wait so long especially when it wasn't that busy and we ordered small plates. I had to ask another waitress to go find our waitress to just get the check! Seriously? Not cool. Food was fine, service was not."
Danna O.,"San Mateo, CA",50,20,4,3.0,10/9/2010,"Food is good, but the service is horrible. I've been to the other BJs in Fremont and their servers are great. The one here however, lags. They're nice, but there have been one too many times when the drinks come at least 15 minutes later and the food 30.  We only come back for the BBQ pizza and pizookies."
P D.,"Encino, CA",0,37,3,3.0,7/8/2014,"I don't know where to start... First I used their new app to get priority seating and when I got there I was told it would still be 30 minutes because she didn't add my name to the list until I got there. Which means no priority for the app. After waiting 10 mins a table at the bar opened so I say there. Then I watched 4 waiters walk by me without even a head nod. Finally one noticed that no one had stopped and he  asked if anyone had helped me. The pizza was a BJ standard so no complaints. They need to retrain the staff to understand that if you want good tips, you provide good service."
Namthip P.,"Seattle, WA",29,19,1243,4.0,8/1/2010,"After a long session of windsurfing, my husband and I love to have fish tacos, mini BBQ chicken pizza, chicken lettuce wraps and pizookie at BJ's. Their fish tacos is the best I've ever eat. Really, you must try it! Although I'm not a fan of a chain restaurant, but BJ's is a great place if you like sports. Watching the games and enjoy your meal at the bar is the way to go here."
Harsha G.,"San Jose, CA",531,562,1332,4.0,6/14/2010,"Love their appetizers, pizzas and pastas - all of it is soo rich that I never could try their desserts :D"
R R.,"San Jose, CA",6,17,,2.0,6/30/2014,"BUYER BEWARE!!!  I hope management reads this comment.  I went to BJ's last Fri (6-27-2014).  The food was good and the service was excellent.  So why 2 stars??  Well, it has to do with paying the bill.  My friend and I paid cash.  We paid seperately and both bills were $16 and some change.  My friend and I paid $20 but forgot to tell the server to keep the change.  When he brought the change back we got 6 $1 bills...no coins!!!!   I feel like the server took it upon himself to keep the change.  I was going to keep the $3 and put a note on the bill saying...since you took it upon yourself to tip yourself, that's all you get. But I didn't.  Management, please inform your servers that they should return ALL of money due to the customer.  That's not cool...."
Alex C.,"Fremont, CA",1,2,,1.0,3/26/2011,"Service was bad, the server didn't smile during all time and he didn't want to speak Spanish when we address him in Spanish (we heard him talking Spanish with other co-workers). His name is Salvador. Food was ok but the chicken was super dry."
Sherry M.,"San Jose, CA",88,376,127,3.0,5/30/2014,"Me and my kids met my friend and her daughter here for our usual ""catch up"" lunch date.  I ordered the gluten free pizza with no cheese and mushrooms and bell peppers.  My kids ordered the kids spaghetti and kids grilled cheese.  They had the kids ice cream after which was only like $1.25.  Not bad but the scoop was really small.  The service was good it wasn't fantastic.  We did have to ask for spoons for the ice cream and our waiter said, ""Well there should have been spoons in your napkins but I'll get you some anyway.""  Wellllll, if we had some, then why would ask you for some right?  My pizza, yes, when you read it, doesn't sound all that great, however.....I've gone to Mountain Mikes pizza and ordered the same thing and the amount of vegetables they put on my pizza was good.  Mine looked like tiny chopped up pieces of bell peppers which wasn't much and barely any mushrooms.  They barely put any tomato sauce on their too.  Ah well.  But the experience was good."
Kimmy G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",212,390,36,4.0,5/31/2008,"Pizza....good Pizookie....good Waiting.....bad I am pretty fond of BJ's I have many fond memories from my high school and college days.  This place seems like it is busy all the time though.  There are a bunch of other restaurants in this center, so sometimes you might have to hike a bit from where you park.  I have had pretty good service here, except for when our pager didn't work, and we waited for what seemed like forever.  Good place to go with some friends to sit and hang out."
Steve M.,"Houston, TX",74,217,41,4.0,9/22/2009,"Came here Monday night after work to grab dinner and to watch the last half of the football game.   BJ's brews their own beers which I believe there were about 8 different brews that they offered ranging from a blonde pale ale to the darker american brown ale.  As well they have a special brew based on the time of the year.  This month they have a german lager called Oktoberfest. The food at BJ's was fantastic.  They have the standard bar foods including pizza, sandwiches, burgers, salads, pasta, etc.  The quality of the food was great and the portions are very large.   I went with the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheese Angus Burger.  This consisted of an 8 oz. Angus burger served open-faced, smothered with Piranha Pale Ale chili, jack and cheddar cheeses and topped with onion strings alongside sliced tomatoes and pickles. It also came with the crispy-thin fries. This was definitely a sandwich that you have to use a knife and fork to eat. The only issue I had with this restaurant is that even tho they have tv's scattered all over the restaurant and all of them were showing the football game.  They had the volume turned down on the game and were playing pop music. I believe that if you are a brewhouse and you are showing a sporting event on tvs all over the restaurant, that you should also play the audio that is associated with the sporting event."
Lyndsey S.,"San Francisco, CA",79,103,3,4.0,10/8/2012,"Food is good, the last two times I've ordered for pick-up I ended up with new people in training and they screwed up my order, but all-in-all the food is really good, try to avoid going during the lunch hour, it is super busy"
Steve L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,70,,4.0,10/4/2010,"One of the things I like most about this place is that the waiting staff are usually good college kids or similar age, just trying their best to save some money for school or whatever, and their service is friendly and attentive.  Stark comparison to the loser waiter hipsters in SF with some pharmacoma'd sense of entitlement, judgement and resentment. Ok, now I've got that done. Their in-house root beer is great, I really enjoy their pizzas, the place is clean, they do their best to quickly seat you during peak time, and if they stuff up anything, no questions asked, they over-fix it. Is their food great? Well it's better than Denny's , and the people who work there don't seem so desperate and dentally challenged. It always seems like a fun atmosphere , it's clean, and because of all of this..  I usually tip 20% ."
Joseph F.,"San Francisco, CA",309,160,,3.0,7/17/2009,"Ok really it's 3.5 stars... and that's only becauase I""m comparing to Red Robin. BJs is another ""American"" food chain, complete with a full bar.  If you think of Red Robin as more ""family oriented"", bjs is alot more ""workign man/drunk"" oriented. Plenty of beers, people, TVs and sports line up everything.  It's more upbeat than it's american counterpart and I was happy to see a more extensive lunch menu that tasted better too. I went with a ""house italian"" salad for like 8 bucks.  You hear ""house"" in the title and you immediately think of a crap salad with 3 veggies and some lettuce.... I was impressed though.  Cubes of salami, at least 3 cheese, peppercinnnis and more were sprinkled through, and lettuce was probably the least used ingredient.  GOOD SALAD! the bartender was REALLY good (wish i caught her name) and I have to say the experience sitting at the bar was top notch. I've been here in the past at a table and had a lot of problems with the service (speed and following directions... 2 crucial aspects of service).  I was really glad to see this remedied at the bar. Hate to say it but I'll probably be back... no more red robin for this guY!"
Dominic T.,"San Francisco, CA",499,344,375,5.0,6/21/2010,"No wait on Father's Day is enough for 5 stars. Usually a wait at the Tanforan BJ's is at least 30 minutes. Upon arriving, the greeter was ecstatic and cheerful, a plus. The dining room here is smaller yet the service is even faster. Amber was the server for my party of four (including me). She was very friendly and attentive and always stopped by to check up on how everything was going. There were two mistakes in the order but it was definitely not her fault. And she brought out the free father's day pint glass after I asked, good thing there was still stock. I ordered my signature grilled chicken pasta with a root beer float and my parents both got the meatloaf sandwich while my sister got a sandwich/burger with wedge cut fries. The wait for the food was average but I wish there was some kind of complimentary starter that other chain restaurants have (e.g, bread sticks, sourdough, whole grain bread, soup, salad, etc.). I nearly finished my root beer float before the food came. I wanted to shoot myself for not bringing in my receipts for a free mozzarella sticks appetizer for completing a BJ's survey. Arg, I've been dying to use them!!! There were flat screen TVs every few feet so no one was left un-entertained by baseball or whatever was showing on the screen. My entree was not served in the big bowl-ish dish that I'm used to but a flatter one that seemed to have a smaller portion size than San Bruno serves. Still delicious but needs more flavor and much more sauce. The pasta was somewhat dry and I resorted to adding a LOT of pepper to account for the flavor loss. Throw in the stringcut fries from my sister's burger meal (that were not the wedge cut fries she ordered) and some onion strings from the meatloaf sandwich meal, and you've got a winner! Mix it up for some delicious goodness. I finished it all of course. Now for the dessert, I ordered the apple pie pizookie (the formal name for it on the menu has slipped my mind). It was VERY VERY sweet. Unless you've got a full cup of water prepared, I advise you to order any other pizookie that doesn't involve chocolate. Actually, the first pizookie that arrived at the table was the macadamia nut pizookie, which was a mistake but we didn't know until we tried it. Then later the apple pie pizookie arrived to our surprise. I actually preferred the macadamia nut one over the apple pie, though I dislike anything with nuts.  The guys bathroom is clean but really cramped. It was really occupied and busy when I went in even though the restaurant wasn't so busy when I was leaving."
Joice W.,"Manhattan, NY",18,23,3,4.0,9/1/2011,"I just found out BJ's offer party take out menu... Nice variety of choices, and they even have their handcrafted beer in a bottle for only $4! It is on my list now :)"
David W.,"Foster City, CA",114,316,284,4.0,3/14/2010,"Living just a few blocks away, BJ's seems to be a place I frequent once a month or so.  Their food has quite a variety and there is something for everyone. I've tried most of their menu and:  I haven't tried any appetizer there I didn't like. They recently just rolled out a series of ""mini"" appetizers priced in the 3-4 dollar range. Certainly not good for you, but very tasty.  Their pulled pork sandwich (both regular and ""sliders"") is good... Their ""New Orleans style"" Jambalaya is good, but far from authentic.  As my favorite dessert of all time is chocolate chip cookies and milk, I'm a huge fan of their pizookie..... hot gooey cookie with ice cream! YUM.  The only thing on their menu I've had that I would stay away from is their meat loaf open faced sandwich.... Just lacking in all departments. Pick something else.  BJ's food is the same or slight better with the other chains such as Chile's, Red Robin or Applebees... BUT ... They have some good beers.... and their bar area is a cool place to catch a football game or 5!"
Celeste S.,"Truckee, CA",67,266,29,3.0,12/16/2009,"I've been to this BJ's several times in the past but not recently. Then a group of friends went for Monday Night Football this past Monday to watch the SF/ARI game. I was pleasantly surprised that there were a fair amount of SF fans there to cheer with :) But still a table for us to grab! The bar did fill up right after we got there.  I had been there for March madness before and it was fun then too. I like to see that someplace local has a bar you can watch sports without having to find a dive in SF. And then I ended up going back for lunch with my husband the next day! Week day lunchtime is crazy busy with all the office parks right around there. But we were able to snag a table in the bar area just as someone was leaving. I am always happy with the food I get. My only problem is with the service. It is very hit and miss. I will say if you go with just 2 or 4 people, it has always been fine. But the larger the party gets - the slower the service seems to get. And the service in the bar is much better than the main restaurant on all occasions in my experience. I've been here for lunch and dinner and the slow service in the dining room doesn't seem to have a time window. But when it was 4 of us, it was fine. A larger group - has been pretty awful.  But I will say every time we have sat in the bar area, whether 2 people or a group, the service has been good. I will definitely go back. The food is bar/chain type food but it's good for what it is. And better quality than other chains. They have a large selection of things to choose from.  I recommend the beef or BBQ chicken sliders - very yum. And their soups and chili are great!"
Raquel D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/17/2013,"Love this place. 99% of the time the service is great, the food is tasty, the price is good and the noise is bearable. The Sunday brunch menu though leaves much to be desired and the desert menu could have a bit more variation, but you just gotta keep that in mind when you go there."
Petunia L.,"Pacifica, CA",668,501,319,2.0,6/12/2009,I think the food is alright here.. i mean its typical american food pizza burgers and sandwiches right. So since the food is mediocre i would imagine the staff should be 100% right? no not at this BJ's on a busy night expect minimal service.. don't expect plates for your appetizer ok? just cause it's a brewhouse does that mean we can't eat civilized? anyways  food ok service sucks go to the one in tanforan instead =) hey atleast barnes and noble is right there!
L S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/5/2013,"This had to be my worst experience at a BJ's. Ordered a Seared Ahi salad and got almost frozen ahi and rotten lettuce mixed in with almost bad lettuce. I called the waiter over to tell the waiter, he took my plate and said, ""ok"" and walked away. ""Ok""?  What does that mean? 10 minutes later the manager came over and told him about the rotten lettuce. His response was,""well it's all pre packaged and its how it comes"". What the heck, ""how it comes""? If they got rotten meat delivered, would they cook it and serve it, just cause that's how it came? Please! He took my salad and had another made. Same thing with the second salad. Manager had the same dumb ass response. And waiter never came to see if everything was ok.  Oh yeah, I also ordered a pazookie, hoping it would make my dinner better. OMG!!! My pazookie came burnt!!! I definitely won't be back!!!"
