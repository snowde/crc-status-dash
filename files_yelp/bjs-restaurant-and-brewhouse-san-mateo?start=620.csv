Charlie H.,"Daly City, CA",0,39,1,3.0,5/14/2013,"My new favorite pizza, the Chicken Bacon Ranch. Round table used to be my favorite, since I had BJ's pizza, I have not had round table since. The pulled pork sandwich is also really good. If you are going to get a beer since it is a brewery, the Jeremiah Red is the best, I think. I have to say, I tried the bison burger that is new on the menu and I was REALLY SICK all night and the next day, otherwise they would get more stars."
Hyung L.,"San Francisco, CA",217,414,12,4.0,12/9/2009,Came here after helping a friend move for a quick bite to eat. Saturday night around 6 pm and we were able to get a seat at the bar no problem. It was busy that night with a bit of a wait for a table but seating in the bar area was no problem. BJ's has a decent selection of their house brewed beers which are pretty tasty. Decent coctail menu and decent regular menu. The deep dish pizza is good. Not as good of course as Zachary's or Little Star but it's pretty good. What I really love here are their chicken wings. It's not drenched in the sauce. It's more drizzled on and you can dip in the hot sauce and ranch yourself. Girlfriend and I got a couple salads and the wings and were stuffed.  The portions here are pretty big and the menu can be gluttonous. The appetizer sampler is tasty but avocado egg rolls and southwest egg rolls aren't exactly low calorie foods. But it's a brewer pub restaurant so what do you expect. The only gripe I have is the price of their drinks. Compared to an Elephant Bar and Grill the drinks are more expensive.  Either way we seem to find ourselves coming here when we're tired and want a quick easy place to eat.
annie P.,"Burlingame, CA",1,12,,1.0,3/24/2013,Awful restaurant.   The server kept talking over the plates of food as he was bringing to the table.  So unhygienic. I ordered the hickory-smoked baby back ribs.  The ribs tasted and looked like they were boiled in water and smothered with a heavy BBQ sauce. My friend's pasta came as a plate of clumped noodle.   The  friend calamari appetizer were like rubber bands. REALLY DISAPPOINTING.  My first and last time.
Daniel G.,"San Jose, CA",253,319,3,3.0,1/27/2010,"What guy doesn't like BJs? It's really hard to give the place anything more than a 3 star rating in my opinion. The food certainly isn't anything special...i think that's one of the reasons why they have such a large menu: instead of going with the business model of find a specific style of food and do it WELL, they go with the shotgun model of have a little bit of everything so that you can appeal to groups of people or people who aren't quite sure what they want to eat. I can't knock them for their model, but i must say that it shows in their quality.  I've had several different things--salads, appetizers, one of their baked potatoes--and not a single thing was really memorable, definietly nothing that i would ever order again. Nevertheless, the fact that they do have a huge menu is always a plus when one is not quite sure what they want to eat...but not much of a plus. So there it is, i don't like BJs. I may be the only man to ever say that, ever."
J M.,"La Honda, CA",0,44,,3.0,10/6/2012,"I've been here a few times lately and the food and service is usually good... However last night we arrived close to closing. Our waitress seemed less than friendly. Granted it was probably the end of a long shift, but this is still a service industry. She got both of our orders wrong, not that we had a chance to mention it because someone else brought our food out. She never even came to our table to ask how everything was. We didn't see her again until she dropped the bill off.     I understand mistakes happen but this just seemed like carelessness and generally not giving a damn about her job. You'd think someone who depended on tips for a living would try a little at her job.     We left feeling slighted and now I'll think twice before choosing BJs again.     I can't really fault the place itself because its been fine before, but if its neat closing you might want to choose somewhere else. If everyone was like Krystal, our waitress (not to be confused with Krystal the bartender), they'd be out of business!"
Justin R.,"Redwood City, CA",1,2,,1.0,9/26/2013,I have eaten here twice. It seems like the runners don't care what they put in front of the patrons. I had the avocado egg rolls and they were smashed with hand prints on them. It was thrown in front of me before I could say anything. After the waitress got done talking to here friends in the front corner of the restaurant. I stopped her and asked her to look at my plate. She was horrified and got us another plate. If you have 2 hours to eat and fell like good beer but well below average food then this your place. The services is slow and the manger hides. Save your money and go next door to Red Robbin. The service is 100 times better and the food is fresh.
Priya G.,"San Francisco, CA",11,17,3,1.0,5/24/2014,"seriously the worst service I've ever had. waited for drinks for 30 minutes, not even the specialty drinks, like the water took 30 minutes to bring to the table. drinks came 10 minutes later. but two tables had their drinks before us. not to mention they checked my id, but the waitress didn't know how to read it. it's a California ID, we are in California.... also, 45 minutes later and still didn't get appetizers. think again if you want good service. our waitresses name was Christina"
Kathleen W.,"Oakland, CA",417,1556,90,3.0,4/8/2007,"It's going to become one of those places where ""when all else fails, head to BJ's"".  But I can't complain ... it's a place to get a beer and where the boys can watch the game on the giant TV's strategically placed all around the establishment and the women folk can talk mergers and acquisitions.   The pizza is good and after trying some of their other food, next time I go, I think I'll go deep dish and probably stick to it from hence forth.  We ordered a pitcher of the Hefeweizen, but it didn't taste right to me.  My friend described it as too ""bananananay"" ...  My closing statement? ... ""If you're looking for a good time and BJ's comes to mind, bring some friends, don't rush it, enjoy the foreplay at the bar while you wait for the vibrator to go off."""
Kathy F.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/3/2014,I had never been to this restaurant and was excited to try it. If I could give no stars or a half I would. Greeter was on phone when we arrived and ignored all the customers in line. Finally we went to the bar. A supposedly just cleaned table was still messy. No one acknowledged us for the 15 minutes we sat there. Went to use restroom it was a filthy pig sty with an overflowing trash bins and two out of order sinks. Apparently BJs is a place I DONT want to be! and wasn't missing a thing.
Brian I.,"Hillsboro, OR",50,96,23,3.0,8/16/2009,Meh. Nothing special. Average food with average service. Had the cripsy chicken sandwich with piranha IPA The beer wasn't that great for a brew house. The crispy chicken sandwich was yummy (I was in the mood for crunchy chicken tender-like food). I've read that a lot of orders get messed up at this place. Mine wasn't.  Host was a bit short with me but otherwise  I got good (not great) service. Would come back here? Maybe. Would I make a special trip or take a date? No.
Curt O.,"Columbia, MO",0,73,,3.0,12/8/2010,"Ate here at lunch during the week. Ordered a Brown ale. Nice selection of beers on tap.  As an entre had the French dip with horseradish sauce and au jus dip. Very good. Lean, tender beef.  The bun held together well for dipping. The fries were thin, crispy fries just like I like them  Service was decent. 3 stars for being decent enough, nothing outstanding."
Amanda G.,"San Francisco, CA",50,12,1,3.0,4/26/2012,"BJ's is always disproportionately packed for how average the food is; however, it is one of the few joints in the area that is open late and that offers a relaxed sports bar vibe.  The best ways to go here, hands down, are the appetizers and pizzas.  My group split the avocado egg rolls, the artichoke spinach dip, the wings and the mediterranean pizza.  All very tasty.  My date also ordered the rib-eye to split- he ordered it medium which is a little done for my preference but it was actually really good.  We didn't have enough room for dessert but the pizookies here really are sinfully delicious as well.  (Our eleven year old waiter was nice and attentive too - Weird.. lol.)  All in all, I like this location a lot more than the San Bruno one even if it does feel substantially more crowded.  Solid place for late night drinks and appetizers.."
F P.,"Union City, CA",7,31,14,1.0,3/15/2014,The service was horrible here. No one pays attention to you and it takes such a long time to get your food. I understand you are busy but at least communicate with your customer.
Arun P.,"San Mateo, CA",14,29,,2.0,6/11/2014,"For a pub place that does their own beer, it's ok.  The food is ok, just like any other Friday's, Red Robin, Chevy's, etc, etc...   But the service SUCKS even the place is empty.  Don't even get me started at how bad it is at the bar.  Unfortunately, considering where this one is located (borderline of San Mateo and Foster City, it can milk the only game in town method, because the rest of the restaurants in the area are just as bad, but just close sooner.  And the town lacks decent restaurants.  Don't get me wrong it's not a bad place if you want to go to a sports bar, providing you can get a seat and some service.  I'm fairly convinced that the management doesn't give a crap, so the employees don't give a crap.  Which basically mean the customer get crap."
Scott K.,"Burlingame, CA",10,25,3,3.0,6/10/2010,"We're trying to stay away from chain restaurants lately because my girlfriend doesn't like the unhealthy amount of food choices they serve and wants me to live forever.  So Bj's wasn't on top of our list of places to go until they advertized this Ahi tuna appetizer and salmon choices to their menu; me, I'll try anything at least once. Walked in early as usual and the restaurant was pretty busy.  The hostess's greeted us right away and seated us in the lounge area where my girlfriend wanted to eat.  The hockey playoffs were on so you can imagine the crowd in the bar for yourself.  The bar area has lots of seating with very good plasmas to watch the games.  Our server Jose greeted us right away and took our drink order.   When he returned I ordered the Ahi Tuna appetizer for the girlfriend with many adjustments and ordered a green salad with the Thai spiced Salmon for me.  The salad came right away with your typical iceberg lettuce, croutons and a little bit of carrots and zucchini.  I'm not a cheap person but I don't think it was worth $5.25.  Entrees came in at a good time frame considering the business and the food was well presented.  Girlfriend modified the hell out of her tuna; Jose got everything right and she said it was perfect.  My salmon was hot, cooked very well and not too spicy.  I do need my veggies though and there weren't enough on the plate so I had to order extra on the side which also came very quickly. To sum it all up, the service is very good especially my server Jose.  He checked back on our table many times to see how we were doing and was very friendly.   The food is not jumping off the plate great, but was good.  The restaurant is very cool with good audio and visual aids."
B F.,"San Mateo, CA",18,97,35,4.0,4/28/2010,"BJ's excellent burgers (they're grilled buns are the best), thin fries, and those CRAZY ADDICTIVE sweet crispy onion strings (not on the menu anymore, but try asking for it) are what keep me drooling at night.   The buffalo wings were also delicious.  For drinks, I like their Strawberry Lemonade although they take forever to make more if they run out. Service at this place is slow and you can forget about getting drink refills.  But if you do manage to flag a waiter down, they are friendly and will listen. Plenty of flat screen TVs to watch while waiting for food. I almost always leave BJ's a few pounds heavier and happily satisfied with my meal."
Seamus H.,"San Bruno, CA",71,52,35,3.0,9/28/2011,"I will only go to BJ's in San Mateo if I am watching a sporting event with friends that live in the area.  Unless you are sitting in the bar, it seems like the wait for a table is always ridiculous and the service it pretty much sub par.  The reason I upped BJ's from 2 stars to 3 is because I love their Roast beef dip and they have a fairly decent IPA(Indian Pale Ale) on tap."
Boris M.,"San Leandro, CA",284,388,692,3.0,4/23/2012,Nothing special abot this place we got there this friday at 9pm not bad got our table in 10 min plus for that..... we order our food and I ask for shrooms on my steak nothing came out then I asked her again she run in back and got me my mushrooms when I was almost done with my meal come on....... over not my kind of place.......
Mike C.,"Hayward, CA",1,133,,3.0,9/6/2012,"Went to the one in Newark a while back and was not impressed at all. Thought I would give BJ's another chance here in San Mateo so I went in with the wife during a busy lunch rush. The wait was actually not that bad. We were in within 15 minutes and seated at a booth. They have plenty of TV's for you to watch a game and enjoy your drinks and food. The food was a lot better than the one in Newark and the service was much more attentive and hospitable. The burger that I ordered was decent but could have been cooked a little bit better. The fries were a little bit cooked too long and was crispier than I am used to but again not bad. The main entrees are a little bit different and could be cooked better as my wife had ordered the fish and it was not done as well as we hoped. But again, a lot better experience here than the one I went to in Newark."
Jenny L.,"Millbrae, CA",157,960,682,3.0,10/17/2005,"This place might be a winner if it can last at this location with a number of turnovers.  The deep dish pizza is comparable to Pizza Chicago and they have solid selections including avocado eggs rolls, mashed potatoes, ribs, chicken salad, and buffalo wings.  The sports bar grill ambiance makes it a great place to hang out after a game at the ice rink or getting a group together to watch one."
