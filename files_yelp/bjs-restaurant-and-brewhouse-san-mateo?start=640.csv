Esther A.,"San Francisco, CA",645,1160,406,4.0,6/13/2006,I like BJ's despite the negative reviews on this particular location/restaurant. The pizza was yummy. I'm not a HUGE fan of thick crusted pizza (too much bread) and I never eat crusts off pizza but this one was an exception. It was buttery and soft so I ate up the crusts. The avocado rolls (a toss up between BJ's and Cheesecake Factory's) was delicious!!! I tried to save room for a Pizookie but I saw one being served next to me and it was just a plain large chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. I think I can make do w/out ordering this. OR I can make it at home if I wanted one bad enough. And the service? It was decent. No complaints here. We got seated immediately and the food arrived surprisingly quick. =)
Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",285,689,138,4.0,1/29/2007,"This is a good chain-type place to grab a (long) lunch.,. and especially good for large parties. There's something on the menu to please everyone. Good appetizers and dessert, big portions, tv's everywhere you look (for the ADD-challenged) and it's pretty conveniently located for people working in the Redwood Shores area. They get an extra star for having a good wait staff (even during the busiest of meals), one of which was kind enough to introduce this beerphobe to a beer that I ACTUALLY LIKE (gasp!)... the frambroise they have on tap is really good (it's basically a berry beer, and better than cider). Minus one star for the fact that they *are* always busy at lunch and reservations are a must if you do not want to spend half your lunch hour waiting for a table, but I must admit this is one of my favorite chains in the area."
Christine V.,"Redwood City, CA",339,424,1439,5.0,5/29/2007,"I absolutely love BJ's and am so happy they built one near me.  I mainly go just for the appetizers. They have the best chicken wings and motz sticks ever, beats Fridays in my opinion and that's saying a lot!  I also like the sourdough burger, its one of my favs. The drinks are excellent.  My favorite is a Grape Sweet Tart martini. Tastes like grape juice but gives you a nice buzz.  This place is always packed so I suggest reservations or just finding a seat in the bar area."
Esther A.,"Sunnyvale West, Sunnyvale, CA",80,190,184,1.0,4/2/2009,"NEVER AGAIN. went here for lunch (apparently, i should've gone on the same day as Don D). took 40 minutes for them to get me a SALAD. granted, there was grilled chicken on it, but i can't imagine it would take 40 minutes for them to grill 5 THIN slices of chicken. my salad plate was dirty along the edges, but i was too scared to send it back for fear that it would take another 40 minutes (i only have about an hour long lunch). i ate the center of the bowl and not along the edges - not sure if that did anything. and to top it off our server only said sorry AFTER we finally brought our food. i mean, C'MON! even the chicken tender dishes came out before my salad (granted, only like 10 minutes prior) and he apologized JUST as he put our bill down. just like mimi's, i will NOT be returning."
Donna D.,"San Francisco, CA",32,119,554,3.0,4/13/2011,"Its a Saturday nite & Yes its busy! We got called for our seats at 7:37 pm. We sat down, looked over our menus, ordered, got our drinks & I notice its 8:16 pm & still no food. All we ordered was Ahi Tuna & a Trio Pizookie. But as I'm writing this the manager comes by & tells us he's sorry there was a mistake with our order. He'll take care of us. Finally at 8:20 pm the Ahi Tuna comes. Oh happiness! It's a good thing we were not in a rush."
Patrick K.,"Santa Fe, NM",43,99,1,1.0,12/13/2011,"Disclaimer: All I have ever eaten from here is pizza.I'd rather give a dirty homeless guy a BJ, than have to eat another slice of BJ's pizza!! This is the second worse pizza I have ever had. The worst pizza was in Siliguri, India : it consisted of a chapati, ketchup, and a little bit of paneer!  If you want pizza, a frozen pizza is better, and I am not joking!"
Mashimaro M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,234,6,4.0,1/29/2010,I'm not into writing many reviews of chain or franchise businesses but we went to dinner here last night and it was fairly good. Once can't expect much from these chain restaurants since the food tends to be pretty much assembly line standard. But the people were friendly and it was an overall good dining experience. I really enjoyed 2 glasses of their raspberry iced tea. Yum.  This restaurant wasn't as big as their Milpitas/San Jose (?) location but it was still nicely decorated and clean. It's always best to go out to eat during week and not on weekends since restaurants get so crowded on Fridays and Saturdays but I know that not everyone has that time luxury.
Stacey M.,"Dublin, CA",0,28,,4.0,10/13/2010,I enjoy this restaurant.  It is a favorite of my 80+ Mom.  They have great lunch specials.  The staff is always nice.  Sometimes there is a wait.    Two can have lunch for $20. including a tip.    (No Bar just sodas.) The Cons~ it is very loud.   So this is not a great place to eat if you want to have a intimate conversation.
T C.,"Oakland, CA",112,791,313,5.0,2/8/2009,"So I'm out last night with some guy and he asked where we should go eat. He suggested some seafood place, but I saw this place in the same center. So I said ""Oh my god, I love BJ's!""  He smiled and said he did too. [that's right, I pick 'klassy' guys]  So it was settled. Here is were we would wine and dine. The atmosphere here was busy but I didn't feel like it was my problem. The hosts seemed rushed, stressed out & chaotic. The host taking the names couldn't speak English, yet the chick that was simply seating us did..that made no sense but, whatever I don't work there, just observing. We shared avocado rolls which are basically a big, wrap-around chip with the hugest glob of guacamole you could possibly imagine piped into it.  I had the most beautifully sculpted cob salad that was perfectly sculpted into a huge, rounded heap of uniformly bite-sized tastiness.  It was really pretty. I washed it all down with a fruity & piquant  pomegranate margarita that could not have been more perfect. I found the set up of this BJ's made more sense than the one I am used to in Lake Forest. Here, they have the sports bar very separated from the dining room. I like that a lot.  As much as I love sports bar food, I hate sports and I really don't need to see that crap when I'm trying to eat. I'd go back here in a heartbeat. I love me some corporate chain food. It's the SoCal in me, sue me."
Brian B.,"South San Francisco, CA",93,259,681,2.0,4/4/2011,I always hate coming to this BJ's location. I don't understand how it can be crowded every night when all it is generic food. The service is really slow since it always crowded and there's atleast a hour wait for  a table. I try to avoid this restaurant as much as I can.
Anna A.,"Walnut Creek, CA",25,205,204,2.0,1/29/2012,Umm got the Toscana pasta which lacked in flavor. The server misinformed us that the pasta comes with shrimp when the menu states it's extra charge. She said its extra if you want additional shrimp. We believes her of course and realized she was wrong when our order came. She went on break and we never saw her again so we couldn't say anything.
Sue K.,"Redwood City, CA",0,73,46,1.0,2/28/2014,"Food Is okay, Service the worst.... we had to ask twice for everything, spoon twice, drinks, sourcream, and our bill. For a salad and a salmon dish we had to wait an hour before they served the food. With this big place do they have one cook?????"
Lydia M.,"San Mateo, CA",15,22,8,1.0,3/26/2014,This place just gets worse and worse each time I go. Always just one waiter working one huge section. You have to ask for your food and refills. They apologize they are busy because its Saturday....uhhh no excuses! Staff more waiters. They have about 4-5 host standing around. When asked for a refill they look at you like you're wasting their time!
Miss V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,10,3.0,6/14/2014,"Came here for  lunch.  After half way thru my meal,  I found a piece of short thin hair in my food.  Told the waiter and he replaced it.  Maybe I should of gotten a refund?  Found out there was a panda express just around the corner.  Damning but the drinks was good.  Wait line was OK."
Vini J.,"Los Altos, CA",33,3,,1.0,8/31/2013,"This was an absolutely awful experience. The wait was long and the service was extremely poor. The order was not fulfilled properly with most of the orders filled incorrectly, and it took 45 mins just to get a grilled cheese sandwich. The manager lacked the courtesy to deal with the issue appropriately. Will never visit again. Definitely to be avoided!"
Yeasir H.,"San Mateo, CA",2,16,9,5.0,7/27/2013,"Really good food, highly recommend. I recommend their California flat bread pizza."
BayAreaMom M.,"San Francisco, CA",3,45,,3.0,4/11/2014,Pleasantly surprised! Came here after my daughters softball game for dinner. Packed on a Friday night. Got a table fairly quickly after being told it would be 45 minutes. Dinner was good! Kids loved their ribs and chicken pasta. I loved the price. I got the salmon. Healthy and tasty. Kids got the pizookie for dessert. Delilsh! The service was top notch. Darren was super nice and accommodating. I'll be back!
Al C.,"San Jose, CA",114,291,1,4.0,3/29/2012,"A good selection of food.  However, the food is heavy loaded with calories.  So, not an everyday joint.  More of a place to hang-out with a group for beers.  Great bar and lots of TVs for watching sports.  Clean place too."
Rishi S.,"San Mateo, CA",62,17,,5.0,7/5/2012,"I have been eating at BJ's since 2007, from Ohio to California and I still love it!! This is a big deal because I quickly get tired of eating at the same place with the same menu.......Not at BJ's!! They constantly update and improve their menu for a fresh vibe every visit, I love that!! I also admire the fact that they have a global menu, not just one cutlure to enjoy. The service is always great as well."
Zeke A.,"Nashville, TN",69,152,17,4.0,9/4/2009,Oh BJ's. I'm not a huge fan of the menu or the food in general. The service is above average.  Why four stars? Well I always have a damn good time here because of the people I go with. The drinks are good and the happy hour specials are nice.  This is one of those average places that can be great with the right group of people.
