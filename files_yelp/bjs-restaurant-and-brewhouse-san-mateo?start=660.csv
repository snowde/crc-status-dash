Luis M.,"San Francisco, CA",53,44,111,3.0,1/12/2012,im a huge fan id BJs i came to this particular 1 because i was invited for lunch. The food was great as usual i had the California chicken. The service on the other hand was all right we got seated fast but before we were done eating the waiter brought the check smh....
Victor M.,"Redwood City, CA",0,10,,4.0,10/26/2012,"Let me tell you this.  The beer is really good, all brews are great, fav?  Phirana pale ale.  You can even take home some bottled pints for a price that will sting you. the food is really good and the variety is astounding for a place like this.  Burgers get an A  Appetizers get an A  Pizza is like a c+  Salads are a B Never pissed about my order.  Desserts.....no thanks. Service.  Well, Ive had better.  never really impressed, its busy though so it may be what bothers me, it isn't bad and the staff does a great job, but seem stressed out. Go there, have a pitcher or two with friends!  Games always on if thats your thing."
Mo M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,,4.0,8/20/2012,"Nice after-office, or lunch place. Lots of seating, no long waits (except Friday evenings) The food selection and staff is good -they are helpful with suggestions and polite. The food potions are very nicely sized - no super size extra food that leaves you over stuffed. This place does a great job with potion sizes. They also have some healthier choices on the menu, so you can feel a little less guilty eating after the beer !"
A.F. N.,"Burlingame, CA",23,28,5,1.0,4/5/2014,Went there for lunch.  Why does it take 10 minutes for a table when the restaurant is 80% empty?  Why does it take 45 minutes to serve our food?  Bad service.  Not going back to this BJ's again.
Erica M.,"Fremont, CA",101,191,37,5.0,1/4/2012,The balsamic chicken and mashed potatoes are on point! Portions are huge. Good service too.
Allison F.,"San Mateo, CA",4,31,,1.0,4/6/2009,"Every single time I go here, to this location, I say to myself ""why?"" Don't get me wrong, I like BJ's food. I do. Their pizzas are bomb, their pizookies always send me into a food coma. Their drinks make me reconsider driving home. But this location...what on EARTH is going on? Scary bad service, the dinnerware almost ALWAYS has to be swapped, the food (more often than not) comes out cold and I have to say something about it. Even better, you tell them that you really can't eat olives because you are kinda violently opposed to them (meaning I actually get nauseous when I see them) and lo and behold, the nachos come out smothered in the little bastards. Now, I understand - BJ's is a busy place. But ignoring me and my table for almost an hour does not justify requiring me to tip you, and quite frankly I am tempted to call BJ's corporate office and complain about the server who so brazenly implied that I didn't leave a tip. Well, of course not. Not with service like that! I unfortunately am usually dragged to this location by my friends, but it doesn't mean I have to like it. I'd rather go to Red Robin next door (and THAT'S saying something) than eat here."
Lulu d.,"Woodside, CA",1,87,,2.0,3/27/2014,"Ahi poke was half frozen-ewh! I've had the lettuce wraps and that was ok. Probably best as a  sports bar. Watch a game, have a drink and be happy."
Tony T.,"San Jose, CA",146,21,9,5.0,12/10/2009,"I absolutely love this place! Went here one day after work with 15 co workers to celebrate our friends birthday.  Called in advance and got reservation.  When we got there our table was already ready (Great!). Sat down looked at the menu ordered some drinks.  Manager came out with 3 huge complimentary  appetizer platters. What a great start!! After we ate and got our drink on it was time to sing happy birthday! The manager again came out with 3 huge complimentary Pizookie Platters with candles and we started singing and people around us sang too! 3 Free appetizer platters, and 3 free pizookie platters + Great food + Great service + Great drinks = LOVELY!!!! I had their pizza and 2 types of beer out of ALOT!"
Braden K.,"Honolulu, HI",516,390,3,2.0,1/2/2012,"called in to make reservations for 10+ they asked if we needed more than 2 hours? came in early and checked in but they wouldn't seat us until more than half of our party arrived... on a Monday night? the entire time i saw our lone table, cleaned and ready for seating just chillen... c'mon reserved tables are reserved tables lucky they've got the pizookie or else i'd never step foot in this one again.."
BosCal S.,"Pacifica, CA",1,85,,4.0,4/25/2011,"This is the place to go if you want that ""bad for you but SO good"" food :) I've been to the San Bruno BJ's often for work lunches - it's great to go with a lot of people because of the large menu selection.  The appetizers are seriously ALL good!  My favorite are the mozzarella sticks and I usually get the personal pizza (my favorite!)   Went to the San Mateo location over the weekend and first off - the service/waitstaff are GREAT.  It feels like they actually want to be there!  I ordered the mozz. sticks and the pulled pork sliders.  The sliders were a little sweet for my taste but I was so full from the mozz. sticks and my mimosa it didn't much matter :).  My fiance got the shrimp and chips which he said were really good (he liked the dipping sauces).  Then, even though we shouldn't have, we indulged in a pizooki and I was on a food high for about an hour after we left! Wrote this review to praise our waiter James, he was on point!"
Rebecca M.,"Redwood City, CA",2,36,,2.0,6/3/2011,Ate here a few times. I don't understand why people go back to this place. It's pretty bad. Below average for a chain restaurant. I might as well stay home and cook for myself.
Christiane B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,3.0,8/25/2010,"It was busy night because it was 103 degrees and we, too, wanted to go to a place w/ a/c and a cold beer. We were seated in the center aisle which I would never do again because it was too active with staff and customers coming and going.  It was really hard to concentrate on any conversation with my husband. Steven who was supposed to be our server was barely around. Another server who I think was named Julia helped us.  She noticed that we were sitting for about 10 mins. with our menus down as a signal that were were ready to order.  She apologized and said it was no excuse that they were crowded for the delay and she had taken it upon herself to get our orders.  We ordered 2 beers, appetizers and dinners. SHE delivered our beers.  He delivered our appetizers and said absolutely nothing to us.  He delivered the dinners to us as well with no follow up questions of needing anything. My husband completely finished his meal.  Steven picked up Tom's plates and asked if we wanted another beer.  We each said no. I ate half of my salad.  When I was done eating, I placed the fork upside down and along the top of the dish.  I put the napkin on the table.  It was another 10 mins. or so and nothing changed.  We did not see Steven during this period, not even helping the other tables of his responsibility. Julia saw us again.  She asked if we wanted the check and I said that I wanted to take my remaining food home. She brought the bill over and put my food in a container. Steven picked up the check with our credit card and said nothing AGAIN. Another staff person brought the receipt for Tom to sign. WE GAVE NO TIP TO STEVEN.  WE GAVE JULIA CASH. As I was leaving, she kindly thanked me and said she was sorry for any inconvenience.  KUDOS TO JULIA. Steven, you sucked.  You could have brought us waters.  You could have asked us if we needed anything.  Even apologized.  Asked us how we were.  Nothing.  You could have done something. The food and beer are okay.  I liked the mac, cheese and bacon appetizer.  My salad was really yummy.  The beers are enjoyable. I have never had outstanding service there, but the food has been tasty and good for a chain."
Andrew M.,"San Francisco, CA",12,156,,4.0,1/18/2012,"I am not usually a huge fan of chains but BJ's is different for some reason. The only real problem I had was the fact that their menu is huge (I need to get better at making decisions). I enjoyed the burger I got and the pazooki I shared with my girlfriend. There were so many tvs that I would definitely head back for a game or maybe check out happy hour (do they have one, I neglected to check?)"
Jennifer W.,"Daly City, CA",55,237,1,3.0,4/13/2011,"I would love to give this place 4 stars, but I remind myself that every time I come here I am aggravated, and I only return once every three months because of my frustration level.  I do love the good beer here and the deep dish pizza, which is why I give the three stars.  I have never really had any fault with the food, which is also why my stomach tries to lure me back while my common sense is screaming NOOOO!  The service here is just crappy.  It is slow, sometimes nonexistent for about 35 minutes, and they cram big parties into tight spaces so you find that you can't even back up your chair three inches from the table of 2 you are sitting at.  If I lived closer, I would call and pickup the food to avoid the service problems, but until my next household move, I am stuck waging war with my deep dish cravings and the audible groans from my conscience."
Evan M.,"Burlingame, CA",1,7,,1.0,12/30/2012,"This place has had so many terrible reviews but I thought I would throw mine in with the rest.  This was my first time to the Bridgepoint BJ's, and have been to the Tanforan BJ's once.  I was at the mall shopping and since my experience at the Tanforan BJ's was good, I thought i would just grab lunch here.  Wrong! FOOD - it's a chain.  The food is fine. SERVICE - Terrible!  I ate here today with my daughter.  I ordered a salad, she ordered the mini-corn dogs off the kid's menu, and we also ordered two mini-appetizers.  They went 0 for 4; they messed up all four things!  First the entrees arrived, no appetizers in sight.  The waitress came by a few minutes later and said, ""oh!  the appetizers didn't get here first?.""  Ummm...no they didn't.  We told her to cancel those now that we had our entrees.  She came back a few minutes later and said one of them was ready and asked if we wanted them anyway and that she ""would take care of that.""  Sure.  Then the manager dropped off the other one and he also said he ""would take care of that.""  Whatever.  Anyway, I ordered my salad with no dressing.  It came smothered in dressing.  And my daughter's applesauce didn't come with a spoon (or any kid's utensils for that matter).  We eventually flagged someone down, not a big deal but strikeout number four.  The waitress was apologetic.  Then when the bill came, I was somewhat shocked to see that I was being charged for the appetizers!!  I paid the bill and when the waitress came by to pick it up, I pointed out that she did charge me for the appetizers.  I'm not entirely sure if they meant to charge me or not (what does ""take care of that"" mean anyway?), but she voided the transaction and brought me a new bill.  I paid up and caught the manager on the way out to briefly tell him how bad the service was.  He said he hoped they could do better next time.  Well, I don't think there is going to be a next time! Summary, the food is fine.  Nothing special, but you can find something for everyone here and it's going to reasonably good.  The service is lacking however.  It starts at the top and this restaurant needs a complete overhaul.  Based on the other reviews, I don't seem to be the only one who has been disappointed here.  Anyway, it was a $30 lunch, not a $300 dinner.  I've given them the yelp review they deserve and I'm over it."
Nick P.,"Belmont, CA",24,16,,1.0,5/13/2009,"Dear B.J.'s Restaurant & Brewery at Bridgepoint Mall, Look, man, let's rap honestly, ok? I've had some good times with you. My superbowl experience was a blast. Drinks at the bar right after winter break? Balls out. And hey, your food is really pretty ok at times. Sure, your sandwiches kind of suck and your beer is really not that great, but as a brewery you're pretty freaking ok in my book, and it's great you're open late, and you do accommodate our giant after show parties very well. And those pizookies, man, I love your cookie goodness. But, seriously: your staff? What the hell, dude? Every time I go in it's some other freaking problem. If they're not giving me full cocktails instead of shots, they're ignoring us completely, or putting meat on pizzas for my vegetarian friends who specifically ask for them to leave it off, or generally just being surly and tossing three or four different waiters at us during the course of our meal. I mean, don't get me wrong, you have some cool bartenders, but on the whole your wait staff has really proved themselves to be inept and uncaring. So, look man. I want to hang out with you. I really do. I love spending time with your cookie bits, especially late at night. But it's always such a HASSLE, dude, and going out for a meal really shouldn't feel like an inconvenience. I wish you could be more like your sister in Cupertino. So, in conclusion: it's you, not me. Love, Nick."
Tim K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,102,22,4.0,1/6/2012,"I wasn't impressed early on a few years ago with this place, but it's really been good the past few times I've had it.  The burgers especially are really good.  Also, they have a tortilla soup that is outstanding, made fresh, tastes like it at least, great flavor.  The pizzas are good too and they have a ton of beer options."
Bryan B.,"Chicago, IL",6,73,45,4.0,1/4/2012,"Excellent all around. Had lunch at this trendy joint just before Christmas and the place was quite busy. With that said, the service was excellent (almost too quick actually) and I loved their lunch menu. Drank several glasses of rasberry iced tea and ordered a flatbread pizza (sausage) and salad lunch. The portion was small for me, so I ordered the same lunch pizza for a second round. Perfect lunch for an all around perfect day in San Mateo."
Dyuti S.,"San Mateo, CA",47,110,,3.0,4/19/2009,Like my Elephant Bar review. This is a chain. Some of the things are alright on the menu. The avocado egg rolls and the pizza are fine. It's the only thick crust I'll eat. We rarely order anything else. Loud.  My baby sleeps through the din. I can enjoy a rare evening of conversation over a beer with my husband when I go to BJ's. 80's music.
Sue Ann D.,"Fremont, CA",185,260,2,4.0,10/23/2008,"BJ's restaurants are awesome for the following reasons~ 1.  October-November they have their pumpkin ale that IS FANTASTIC!  2. Pizookies-cookie dessert that is served to you piping hot in a metal pan with ice cream melting all over it and the chocolate chips just getting all swirled in there too to make a gooey-who cares about calories -beautiful dessert :)  3. the cheeseburger pizza-sounds gross, but it's not, it's actually very good and on a really good crispy crust too 4. Did I mention the pizookies?   5. and finally, but not least best reason to go to BJ's??  The flat screen tv's everywhere with the game on!  Ale, the game, pizza, chocolate and my hubby right next to me?  hells yeah, im always in for that!"
