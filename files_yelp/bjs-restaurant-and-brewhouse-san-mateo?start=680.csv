Stacey B.,"San Mateo, CA",3,50,3,1.0,12/28/2013,"this review is a couple months over due, but still worth posting. i normally go here for a beer and easy dinner, i never expect amazing service or gourmet food.  this last time, i was served raw boneless buffalo wings. the manager apologized and told me they would go ahead and take it off the check..... no f'ing shit lady. then offers to let me order something new. no offer to comp my boyfriends dinner or the two beers, and no offer to comp what else i ordered. i declined, paid the tab and we left. i dont need a free dinner, but im pretty sure if you almost give me food poisoning you damn well pay for my beer."
Neal A.,"Poulsbo, WA",0,9,,4.0,7/12/2012,"I really like this restaurant.  If you like good beer, you'll enjoy the microbrews that they make.  The menu is varied and I've enjoyed everything that I've tried over the years.  I find the prices to be very reasonable considering the quality."
Ron M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,30,,2.0,6/20/2013,"Chain pseudo-brew pub. Staff has no knowledge of beers which are mediocre at best. Very confusing, too large menu. OK food - nothing special. Just another oversized chain restaurant with very inefficient service - a result of no training."
CJ F.,"Dublin, CA",0,47,,1.0,12/31/2012,"I received a $25 gift card for Christmas.  I've never been here before, nor any BJs.  I decided to order food to go.  I ordered it online at 6:30pm asking for it to be ready at 7:45pm ( i have a commute to get there).  I arrived at the ""To Go"" parking lot and called the number she said they'd bring my food out.  I had twenty minutes prior to an appointment.  I waited ten minutes outside no one  came so I went inside. I went inside to the take out area. I admit the poor one girl was swamped there were four customers there.  The one prior to me had ordrered something online but of course they had no record so he left. Then it was my turn (now I only have 10 minutes left) she had to go back to the kitchen to see if something was ready came out and told me the dessert potion I had the had ran out. The manager had to take it off the order. He was no where in site, while waiting she gave me my food then forgot my drink. Had to run to another section to get my drink (now teetering on 4 minutes left) then she finally wrang up my order. I was really really annoyed. Normally I would've left but I had already invested so much time.  Finally I was able to get out of there and was now LATE to an appointment. When I sat down to eat my food it was cold and the sticker on the food said it was cooked at 7pm!!!! A WHOLE 45 MINUTES before I had asked so it sat and sat and sat and sat yet they were late to give it to me so werid.  I still have a huge balance on my gift card but I certainly won't be going back there again. yuk!"
Michael E.,"San Mateo, CA",4,55,4,4.0,3/3/2012,"I like just about everything here.  The appetizers are all top notch, especially the Ahi poke (only 395 calories) and the chicken wings. Good tomato soup too.  The pizza has the best crust in my opinion of any place in the bay area. It's expensive, but worth it. I like they throw in tomatoes and garlic for free as toppings. It's a deep dish unless you order thin, so even a small pizza is the kind of meal you have to take home to finish by yourself, especially if you order an appetizer first.  I like the spaghetti & meatballs and the jambalaya too. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes they get pretty busy, so it's easy to understand.  If you're a hamburger or steak kinda guy, there are better options though.  Sometimes if they're super busy and you're waiting for you table, the hostesses bring out a small slice of cheese pizza for you to sample while you wait, and that's a nice touch."
Crystal R.,"Berlin, Germany",102,217,15,3.0,7/27/2009,"You're typical restaurant and bar but a little bit upgraded as far as appearance goes. Great brews I'd have to say and check out the deep dish pizzas.  They are pretty fantastic and moderately priced.  Other then that, I couldn't give them anymore then 3 stars because there is nothing use to really rave about."
Sperry T.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1,28,,4.0,3/29/2011,"Always a good time at BJ's. (Hence the name) But really, an awesome place to grab a bite to eat with some drinks. Also an added benefit is that u can watch almost any sports game. Came here late last night and the place was crowded. The service was fast and we didn't have to wait that long to get seated. I have been to a lot of different BJs and never disappointed. I love BJ's. Wish they had one in the Santa Barbara area."
Russell b.,"Redwood City, CA",186,16,,4.0,2/14/2010,Food is reliably good.  Surprising wide menu.  Nice music at a reasonable volume.  Staff is very accommodating. Great for children. Avoid peak hours; it goes from almost empty 15 minutes before lunch or dinner to a half hour wait almost instantly.
Wilson K.,"San Mateo, CA",27,231,7,4.0,1/31/2009,"Personally, I would give 4 and a half stars but since there's no half stars and since they're not perfect, only 4. I come here occasionally when I'm tired of my weeks of Kashi meals, Eating Right, or Healthy choice meals.  Sometimes I just need a greasy pizza, calzone, or hot wings AND some drinks.  I only have their beer here because if I want a drink I'm more than likely not going to have a ""That hit's the spot"" drink at a chain restaurant.  Maybe it's just me. I really like their hot wings.  It's not as greasy as I sometimes need it, and sometimes I really need greasy hot wings.  But they are good enough to have time and time again.  Their beer is good, I've had the sampler but mostly, I stick with the berry burst cider.  Very light, sweet, and flavorful.  Don't expect to get a buzz off it though. I've had their calzones, which are good but teeny.  I also had their pizza.  VERY TASTY.  However, for a deep dish it's supposed to be a regular crust LOADED with toppings.  Their pizza is a thick crust with a thin layer of toppings.  The crust IS tasty, very buttery and moist like a fresh croissant.  YUMMY.  So I guess it evens out. I've had average customer service, with one bad waiter when I was sat in the very back corner next to the kitchen.  When I got my pizza we had to ask for the pizza condiments, and all I really wanted was some crushed pepper flakes.  The first time we asked from a bus boy we were brought a 75% empty parmesan cheese shaker...  and finally the waiter brought us the crushed pepper flakes after asking him directly. When we were 97% done with our meal the waiter asked if we wanted more cider... if he had asked before we were half way through (because a pitcher only fills four glasses and there were three of us) then we may have ordered another one.  But a last minute addition to bump up your tip amount isn't working on me. Overall, it's good when you need a break from healthy food.  Food is good, but don't expect extraordinary service or bells and whistles."
Maria P.,"San Mateo, CA",7,15,,3.0,3/24/2012,"Great pizza, lots of variaty.  The only reason I didn't give 4 stars is the wait is soooooooo long. But the people that work there are charming and fun. It's kinda a man's club. Big sports TVs and blasting music. I like it there."
Cathy A.,"Hayward, CA",24,45,2,3.0,10/23/2011,"I would have given 4 stars if it were not for the one bad waiter we had the last time we went there.  Came here for family bday celebration.  Must've been about 25 of us all together.  They gave us two waitpersons and the female we had was great, very accomodating.  The male one we had was very rude and crass.  He offended just about everyone in our group and we are a pretty easy going group!  Food is good, portions as filing.  Will most likely go back but ask not to be in whats-his-name's section!"
Jennifer L.,"Belmont, CA",886,825,3697,2.0,8/9/2008,"Meh!  I've only been once, but I'd only go back if a friend really wants to go there.  It was a few steps up from airplane food, though the roll I got was actually on right par with airline cuisine (coach class, baby!). We only had take-out, and I only expected a 3-star meal from perusing Yelp reviews before going.   On the other hand, my brother's wife and her sister really like this chain, plus I remember some Yelpers yearning for BJ's food on talk threads, so I thought it'd be worth a try. They appear to like frying things at BJ's, menu items you wouldn't expect to be that fried or greasy.  I got a a Sesame Chicken Salad for myself.  I my usual questions (does the dressing have MSG? does the chicken have nitrates?) and was pleased with the answers, no on both counts.    My salad had these fried wontons that I picked around (very greasy, not what I look for in a salad).  The dressing was blah and the chicken was dry and tasted like it came out of an institutional kitchen.  I picked up a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich for the husband, which came with some of the most fried fries we've ever tasted.  I chose the thick cut fries, but I would call them the cardiac special with an extra thick fried layer before you get to the potato inside.  Hubby said the sandwich smacked of mass-production and didn't leave him wanting more. Neither the Mr. nor I were impressed."
Ned J.,"Palo Alto, CA",9,13,1,3.0,12/10/2009,"Pros:  Really close to work Bartenders do a fairly poor job remembering how many drinks you've ordered from them. Cons: Food is all greasy and not really very good. It's a bit expensive.   So, 3 stars, and that's mainly b/c the bartenders are all pretty cool and very forgetful ;-)"
Lauren S.,"Lafayette, CA",102,153,25,4.0,10/12/2009,"First time here and I love this place! Such a great array of menu items! My favorite section being the different baked potato dishes! I chose the potsticker appetizer and bacon, onion, and chive baked potato and strawberry margarita. Potstickers are potstickers! Nuff said! The best part about the meal was the huge baked potato and the strong margarita! Ok about this drink.....Usually when I order a strawberry margarita it's because I am trying to be a responsible night driver :) I never ever get a buzz from a foo-foo drink like this! This margarita was super strong! I was buzzing before my appetizer arrived! Ok that deserves an A+ right there because that was a margarita first for me! Bottom Line: Their bartenders know how to hook up a drink....any drink!!! A+"
Bianca K.,"Belmont, CA",195,13,,4.0,2/11/2011,"I've always been a fan of BJ's since the first time I tried it years ago in Cupertino. The pizzas are great - I can never say no to chubby dough! Plus, the pizookies are a real treat and is something to look forward to after a delicious meal.  My husband and I went to this particular BJ's on a Thursday night for a long overdue date night. The restaurant was moderately packed, but not insanely busy, so we were able to get seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress was prompt and took our orders immediately. I had the strawberry lemonade, hubby got Sierra Mist and we agreed on calamari to start with. The strawberry lemonade was too sweet for my taste, so I had to ask for extra ice to water it down. The calamari was delicious - loved the breading, and the sizes of the squid were particularly large. I guess I was expecting some tinier cuts of squid, but hey, I don't complain unless the tentacles are missing (those are my fave!) For our main course I ordered a small sweet pig (the combination of chubby dough, cheese, pineapples, tomatoes and ham are too scrumptious to miss) while my hubby ordered his usual BJ's meal, the crispy chicken sandwich. My sweet pig was delectable - the dough was as chubby as expected, though I could have used a little more pineapple on it. Hubby's sandwich was delicious too (I had a bite). I loved how the sandwich didn't have a generic large chicken patty, but instead, it showcased what seemed to me were moderately-sized pieces of crunchy chicken tenders. That made such a difference! With a side of their honey mustard sauce, you can even toss out the bread and just go to town w/ the tenders. Yum! Of course it wouldn't have been a complete BJ's experience if we didn't order a pizookie. We were much too full to eat it at the restaurant so we ordered the chocolate chunk to go and enjoyed it at home while watching Sammi and Ronnie hash it out on Jersey Shore. Amazing is all I can say (both for the pizookie and Sammi & Ronnie's drama). It's nice to know that after all this time, BJ's has remained consistent with their food, and has kept the pizookie perfect! Our waitress was swift and attentive - but not as attentive as I'd hoped. While she did swiftly refill our drinks without being asked, I wish she would have just stopped at our table to ask if we actually wanted refills because I hate wasting drinks. Plus, I wanted water instead of a second glass of strawberry lemonade, but because she was trying to be some sort of ninja server, she had no idea that she was serving me something I didn't want and ask for. A little note: ask before you bring something. It's good to be proactive, no doubt, but there is a reason why asking your customers is important. All in all, our experience was fun and memorable. We had an awesome date night at BJ's and would certainly keep coming back in the future."
Mochi L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,308,13,4.0,6/11/2009,"There is not a lot of places in San Mateo that are opened late. I'm giving them the 4 stars because they are a pretty decent place to go for a late night craving and they provide a nice ""happy hour"" menu after 10 pm. I found their service to be pretty good.  I lost my jacket here... I know because i didn't do anything from going to BJs and going home. So I called lost and found the next day but no one turned it in. That's sad! But I just went back to check one more time and the hostess was really helpful and tried her best to locate the jacket."
Marc M.,"Redwood City, CA",537,188,,4.0,11/19/2011,"Never miss with this place. Any time is a good time. Stopped in on a Friday after a long work week.  Appetizer: Clam Chowder: I actually prefer their clam chowder over most places. Its not salty, has the right blend of potatoes and clams and very tasty. Entree: Creole Tilapia: Has this dish with fresh vegetables instead of the rice. Well prepared and seasoned. A good meal at an affordable price. A few Martinis and ready to roll."
Abi U.,"Fremont, CA",228,304,3,4.0,8/8/2008,"For how crowded this place gets they do a pretty good job of taking care of people (I'm speaking for my experience!).  Whenever I go to BJ's I never make reservations. I probably should but what I feel like eating at 4pm might not be the same thing I feel like eating at 7 so for that reason (and laziness) I'll always wait. The last time I went was around 8 on a Saturday night and we had a party of 4. The wait was only about 15 minutes and from the look of it it seemed like it was a packed house. Getting seated so early was a surprise although I've never waited longer than 30 minutes here.  The scene is reminiscent of a vintage sports bar. There are TVs everywhere, a good beer selection (I wish I drank beer so I could actually appreciate this!), and there's that lemony pledge kinda feel at all the booths (a good thing!). The crowd here is pretty diverse so no worries on not fitting in. Although the place seems packed the dining area is spaced out enough to be able to enjoy your company and not catch too much of your neighbor's conversation.  Service is good. The waiter I had was very friendly and attentive. Since they were really busy he made a point to apologize for any extended waits we may experience and to just flag him down if he's slacking. Sounds a bit casual but we (my party) were comfortable and I felt for him and his 8 hour waiting shift...:T. Despite his advanced apology he really didn't need to apologize at all. Service was on point, we never had to ask for refills and he even came around to remind us about dessert which i NEVER refuse here! PIZOOOKIESSS MMMMMMMMMMM!  The plates are huge here so even though the menu leans more towards the expensive side you get what you pay for. The clam chowder was enough to fill me up but I still pick off of everyone else's plates! They have salads, steaks, fish.... your basic American dinner I guess is the best way to describe it? Trust me the food is pretty filling.  Pizookies..... you HAVE to get one while you're here. there's no excuse and when you go home and try to make one it won't work. I've tried :(.  I like this location a lot better than the Cupertino location because of the parking. Easy access to the car, easy to leave to get the bridge, then easy time to crawl out of the car and into bed from food coma.  Nice!"
Mary T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,37,,4.0,5/1/2012,"Was here on business, and BJ's was close to work and hotel, so went there quite frequently for dinner Tried the veggie pizza, veggie pasta, veggie burger. All were very yummy. Great Pizza, and the burgers were really good too. Men I was with tried the pizza, pasta, burgers - the big hit being the jumbalaya(sp) - they absolutely loved it and each had it on at least three occasions. Usually pretty busy at dinner, so had to wait 5-10 minutes each time(longest being about 15-20 minutes) but the food is good, and quite a large menu selection as well."
Michael S.,"Foster City, CA",9,11,,3.0,2/24/2010,I've lived in Foster City for 7 years and been to this strip mall too many times to count and yet I've never been to BJ's. Well finally was invited for a work lunch there today adn was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  I had Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps and the Balsamic Glazed Chicken Breast and both were delicious. Major points deducted for extremely slow and indifferent service.  We had a hard time finding someone to complain to.  It finally took my colleague walking into the kitchen to get some attention.
