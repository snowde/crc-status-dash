JD C.,"Belmont, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/22/2013,"The food is good, but the management and service are horrible. Every time I have gone here with my family, we are disappointed. One server put a hot serving dish down right in front of our 2 year old, and before we could grab it, he had already burned his finger. Other times we have made reservations and still had to wait an hour after being told 10 minutes. Once I took my  young son to the bathrooms and we left our jackets and food at the table.  When we got back the food was gone and our jackets were put at the hostess station. Time after time we have not had good experiences here and we won't be back to this location."
Jim L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,22,,3.0,6/3/2012,"Good food and reasonable prices. The negative was the service was slow and the noise level high. Waitress was fine (and cute), but the kitchen was slow."
Victor R.,"San Francisco, CA",184,8,,1.0,8/22/2008,"Since I work near this BJs I have been to it several times before. Their service is usually pretty slow, the food is over priced, and the food is only ""okay."" When I say ""okay"" I  mean bland, and sometimes cold. It's like they thrive off of bland food, but they think you will put up with it since it has a pseudo sports bar atmosphere, with the familiarity of a big corporate restaurant chain. I don't understand why there's always a line for such an over-rated place, but it doesn't matter since I will never go there again. Last night was the last time I will go to BJs. After winning my basketball championship at the PJCC, my team went to celebrate at BJs at about 9:10pm ( a Thursday night)  When we get there, I tell them that we need a table for 11 champions. The hostess tells me that there is no wait. She goes to setup the area. 1 minute later, we had an extra person show up, so I immediately tell them to grab 1 more chair. All of a sudden, the wait went from 0 minutes to 20...hmmm...okay, whatever. Well, 35-40 minutes later, we are finally seated. During the long wait, a 13th person shows up. I guess adding people is a big deal to them, because when we went to our table, adding 1 more chair was too much to handle. We were a lil annoyed by this, but I guess its understandable since we went from 11 to 13 people. However, there was no silverware or napkins at our table. We waited another 20 mins just to have someone ask us about drinks. After getting the drinks, nobody came to get our order. We got fed up, and decided to leave. This is not before they tried to make us pay for an extra pitcher of beer, when there was only 1 beer pitcher on the table. So, we wasted a whole hour and 15 minutes to drink water...fantastic. If you like to over pay for bland food after waiting at least 20 minutes to get it, then BJs has you covered!"
Bibiana G.,"San Mateo, CA",733,92,127,1.0,7/13/2010,"honestly, i think this is one of the worst chain restaurants ever. i never would've even gone here except for that my ex thought this was the greatest place ever... when you have a customer come in with a SEVERE FOOD ALLERGY, you should prolly avoiding feeding said customer that food. i've puked in that bathroom a few times too many. all the food that seems to be good [pizza, pizzokies, pasta alfredo, etc.] has dairy in it so i'm left with close to no options. on top of that i've experienced nothing but horrible service: cold food numerous times, drinks spilled on me by waiters, snippy waitresses, incorrect orders, long waits for simple items, over a half hour wait for a check, being asked to move out of my booth so that the family in the other booth wouldn't have us in their picture- and so many other stupid things. i don't get WHY people think this place is so great..."
Abhishek K.,"Redwood City, CA",2,37,,1.0,1/25/2011,"I have been eating and drinking at BJ's for quite a few years in Cupertino, Fremont and San Bruno; love their beer, atmosphere, service at the bar, and buffalo chicken pizza. This one in San Mateo plain sucks: 1. No chicken and ""sweet"" buffalo sauce on the pizza - first time in 6 years 2. Impolite waiting and hostess staff 3. Dull atmosphere 4. No apology from anyone on being told about the pizza. We usually have had the manager come apologize for any mistakes at other BJ's Maybe it explains the half-emptyness of this place compared to other BJ's in the bay area. Much rather drive more to Fremont from now on!"
Marevie T.,"San Jose, CA",1823,674,26,5.0,10/21/2010,Wow! I like it here! The waiters and servers were actually really nice and definitely check up on us frequently. Although I only ordered quick appetizers for lunch - it was enough to fill me for the rest of the day. I like how its conveniently located around things to shop @ to walk off the food.
Glenn R.,"San Jose, CA",156,278,82,4.0,4/14/2009,The lunch menu is very reasonably priced. The caesar salad is tasty and has fresh croutons. The mini peperoni pizza had fresh ingredients and soft thick crust. The skinny fries are too skinny.
Brown D.,"Vallejo, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/31/2012,"I would rate this a one, yet I've been suprised on SOME visits to this establishment that I feel as if it was unfair if I didn't acknowledge those positive points. Things that were positive were the amount of choices given for delectable dishes, desserts, pizzas and appetizers as well as beers on tap. Negative points included occasional server/hostess attitude and rudeness. You would usually find staff members giving a sense of superiority since they work at a very busy establishment, yet I feel that if you wish to continue having statisfied cliente then a change should be made in the attitudes expressed to customers during their dining experience. Of course like I said I've had several servers surpised me from my past experiences so I have decided to reflect it in the score. I also would like to mention food quality since service to get your initial dish usually gives you enough time to probably plan out your week. Quality has been hit or miss as well yet I have found a few instances where I felt as if I had to visit the facility several times during my visit and normally when I go out to eat I don't tend to feel as if my food is racing to get in and out of my system at an expressed rate. Positive things I could include about this establishment are their selection of signature beers as well as their signature dessert the pazookie which I wish at times was a lot cheaper since the dessert itself seems so much easier to make than how its priced."
david R.,"San Mateo, CA",2,9,,5.0,12/4/2011,Awesome resteraunt. One of the best resteraunts in the san mateo/foster city area. Great food. Service is good. Prices are ok. Atmosphere is awssome and they have about a million tvs and a big one over the bar area that has 4 different channels on them. Overall.. great resteraunt
Matthew G.,"San Mateo, CA",131,801,1348,4.0,4/10/2011,"this place is always so crowded. its poppin every night. place to go for foster citians. gonna run into someone you know every time you come. sometimes good sometimes bad. happy hour is great but the seating isnt enough to fit everyone. five dollar pizza and good drinks. havent really tried the beers but the specialty drinks are good. strawberry splash tastes like a smoothie and a drink like that is full of alcohol but tastes really good. could drink a few of those and feel good. the food is pretty good too. had a lot of pizzas, probably the bbq chicken is my favorite. also tried the chicken fried steak which is a lot of calories, about 2000! probably not worth it. thats your meal for the whole day. also tried the sear ahi tuna salad. a little salty for the dressing. the tuna was good though. and now to the pizookie. yummmm. the hot cookie is melting hot. just compliments the ice cream so perfectly. and on your bday you get a free mini one. so delicious. they also have the huge one that feeds about 10 people.  mmmm. good pizookie worth the two thousand calories. should never finish one by yourself or else you'll feel sick."
Devon S.,"Tucson, AZ",1112,430,2,3.0,5/27/2008,"There is much to love about BJ's, aside from the giggle-inducing name that allows me to taunt my guy friends with ""Nyah nyah we're getting bjs and you're not!"" I love their deep dish pizzas (blackened chicken!), lemonade (sugared rims!), and pizookies (myocardial infarction!). The beer is decent enough (meh!) and the portions are huge (5 stars for marathon training!). HOWEVER, this place ranks high on the Lame-O-Meter because the waitstaff was so inattentive. Let me know beforehand that I'm going to need to dance on the table to get a refill, and I'll make sure to pack some clear-heeled stilettos."
Patrick G.,"Redwood City, CA",133,244,23,3.0,9/7/2008,"If you like sports, and you like beer, and you are not trying to hand out Michelin Guide stars, then this is a great place to strap on the feedbag and enjoy yourself.  Been here many, many times.  Long line to get in if you arrive after 5:30, which says something.  The food is not health-spa-friendly, but it is generally tasty.  I really like the BBQ Chicken Salad.  More than enough to put you out of your hunger misery.  The beer is great - I prefer the IPA. Friday, in an exciting twist, we were witness to power outage in the place.  Went from the loud crowd roar to you-could-hear-a-pin-drop in seconds.  Then the emergency lighting clicked in, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.  Then, more importantly, the power came back on and all the college football games were restored within 2 minutes.  Phew!"
Ben G.,"San Mateo, CA",22,11,,4.0,3/1/2011,"BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants because I can always count on good food and drinks at a reasonable price.  Their menu has a lot of great choices and you can't go wrong with the pizza or French dip sandwich.  Cocktails are made well and the micro-brews are definitely worth trying.  Of course, it is almost required to get a pizzokie for desert as they are a great cookie/ice cream combo."
Kent L.,"Washington, DC",2,32,1,3.0,10/4/2011,Quick and friendly service.  Energetic noise level at 630p on a Tuesday night.  Flatbread pizza was tasty and filling.  Gotta love the half price glasses (and bottles) of wine on Wednesdays.
robert c.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,14,,2.0,1/13/2009,"The only reason it is getting 2 stars is because of the beer selection. The food is mediocre.  The service is HORRIBLE! Pretty much if you are not sitting in the bar area, you might as well just pull out a novel because your going to be waiting sometime for food and service.  3 different occasions, I and my wife were sat towards the rear of the joint, and for waiters to even acknowledge you was TOO much for them. The third time we went, the hostess sat us around the same area. After 10 minutes of not even a glass of water, we walked out. The same hostess saw us, but didn't make a move to ask if there was a problem.  At least I had some good beer before we left.  Cheers"
Robert S.,"San Mateo, CA",403,249,67,3.0,4/23/2009,"HAPPY HOUR!!! HALF OFF APPETIZERS!!! I like grabbing a few pints and some sliders during happy hour. Those tiny little tasty burgers are pretty good, add some bacon and your set. match that up with Bj's Porter or Stout and i am good to go!!! If you can grab a seat in the Bar area this is the way to go, quick service and right next to the Bar, but be weary as the seat vultures lurk around every corner and if you turn your head they will swoop and take that seat you were looking at getting."
MK D.,"Burlingame, CA",59,1986,1591,3.0,7/23/2008,"Went here for happy hour two days ago. Ordered two blonde ales, a bbq chicken pizza for the hubby and one chicken lettuce wraps for me. Service was up to par this time. I was pleased. We ate at the bar. Those chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good. So I scored!"
Johnathan Y.,"Contra Costa, CA",19,60,17,5.0,9/1/2009,"I've been here twice. I've loved it twice.  The mini pizzas are awesome. The Mediterranean in particular is a tasty treat. I'm not a beer connoisseur, but I *really* enjoyed their cider beer. The service is good. I don't know that it's great because frankly I don't care much about service. If they bring me my food and drinks in reasonable time then that's all I need - and they did.  It's the food that draws me to a restaurant. So far the food here has been frickin great. Their prices are reasonable too."
Ignacio A.,"San Francisco, CA",293,38,31,3.0,1/7/2011,"I've been to BJ's twice and both times were good. I tried the fish tacos, (Yes, I get it, why does a Mexican try fish tacos?) they were quite tasty except for the part where I broke out in allergies. No worries, the beer was good; I love their selection."
Kris B.,"San Mateo, CA",2,93,1,2.0,5/28/2009,"The food is pretty good, but the service is consistently AWFUL. When we were seated, the table had lots of large crumbs on it. The host came back with a DRY napkin to wipe it down. I order water without ice, but got water with ice. BF ordered a shot of tequila with no salt or lime. The tequila came with the rim of the shot glass salted. I asked the waiter the ingredients of their wedge salad. He said it was made on a wedge of cabbage (it's really iceberg lettuce) and listed one of the toppings as cilantro (it's really parsley!) When our salads came, we had to ask the waiter for napkins and silverware as he was walking away. And finally, the service was just slow. You have to wait forever for anything there.  I give this place a shot about once a year thinking that if they're still around, they must have improved their service. But still no. Too bad."
