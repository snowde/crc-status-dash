Alex C.,"San Mateo, CA",744,161,37,3.0,4/1/2009,"You know with BJ's...it always seems to be either hit or miss. Never any consistency between locations and times you go. Sometimes they service is just UTTERLY horrible...and at times its GREAT!  Out of all the BJ's I've been to though, so far this seems to be their best one. Their staff at the front counters are almost all smiles and are quick to greet you with a warm hello. Its their waiters however that really seem to need better training....... On one ocation, me and my friend actually sat around the table for a good 15-20mins before anyone even arrived to take our order! As it turns out our waiter was new and was a little overwhelmed with his responsibilities. Then on the flip side I once had a wonderful waitress who was not only attentive, but even offered to provide us Happy Hour prices even though we were not seated at the bar.  So yesterday evening I was at home cleaning out the inside of my car when a friend of mine pulls up to my house and drags me out to have dinner. We wind up going to BJs for a quick bite and boy...it was packed inside for a Tues evening at 6pm. Fortunately however we only had a 10min wait time and were prompt seated. The waiter was rather quick to take our order. However we couldn't seem to locate him at all later on into the meal! No water refill, no asking for more things.....this guy was nowhere to be seen!  After we were done with our meal, we sat around and twittled our thumbs waiting to pay the bill. Looking around, it seemed other patrons who were being served by the same waiter were just as perplexed. Finally after another 15mins of sitting around doing nothing, he finally comes back around only to get flagged down by a million tables all waiting for him to service them. Fortunately out of the chaos, we also managed to get his attention and grab the check. Not wanting to wait some more, my friend quickly stuffed his credit card w/ the receipt and handed it back to the waiter.  I don't know if their overworked, underpaid, or just plain understaffed. But really BJ's.....get it together!"
Amy K.,"Chino Hills, CA",89,80,243,2.0,4/26/2009,"The only reason I even come here is because it's literally around two corners from work and the majority of my lunch group wanted to come here.  If you arrive after noon, you wait with a gang of people and the wait can be more than 20 minutes.  WHY is this place so crowded?!?!  The food is barely okay, maybe people are here for the pizza, but everything else is so mediocre.  I've had better pan pizza (see my review of Windy City).  The one thing I like here that isn't available anywhere else are the pazookies with a scoop of vanilla ice cream......mmm...mmm.     Of the dozen or so times I've been to this particular BJ's, I've only gotten good service once.  It seems like the rookie waiters/waitresses start here to get their experience.  I'm guessing the reason why this place is STILL so popular is because there are a ton of office buildings near by."
Dante S.,"San Carlos, CA",115,81,1,2.0,7/13/2008,"BJ's, I want to like you. But you're so inconsistent. Your wedge fries tasted like they would have been good if they were hot. The fish pieces  in your Fish & Chips were...dry and chewy. Your tartar sauce tastes JUST LIKE McDonald's.  Those Poozokies are good, even if they taste like Easy Bake Oven cookies. Drown anything in ice cream, and I'm usually a happy camper. I will admit, the beers seem to be quite good, or so the few ""tasting"" sips I took led me to believe.  Service was both good and bad (we had more than one server). Just a lot of oversights (no one checked on us after the food was served for 10 or so minutes, drinks went without refills, bar drinks took 10+ minutes, one beer took 15 minutes). Being that we were a large party (9) on a Saturday night in a crowded restaurant, I'm willing to give BJ's a lot more slack. Minus two star for microwave-tasting food.  Minus one star for overcharging for microwave-tasting food. Minus one star for the first waiter being so slow. Plus one star for the second waiter being way more attentive.  I'd come back for the beer and the deserts. I'd get dinner somewhere else, personally."
Chen H.,"San Mateo, CA",302,4,8,4.0,8/4/2011,"Tried out the lunch special since the portobello mushroom deep dish looked really appetizing. Our server was helpful at substituting the onions for pineapple and the pizza turned out ok, was more crust and bread than the topping and kinda messy but wasnt bad either. The mint white peach tea was excellent, fresh mint tea leaves that u could eat after your meal to freshen your breath and a slice of orange make it a zesty drink! Thanks again Mark for serving us, always kind and helpful!"
Steve L.,"San Mateo, CA",833,684,1066,3.0,5/12/2008,"This place can get crowded, especially for dinner on weekends.  If we come in before 6:00, we're usually seated pretty quickly.  Food here is OK, and portions are pretty large.  Kid's menu is pretty large as well.  The kid's spaghetti is pretty meaty and tasty.  The kids' drinks are 16 oz (oh, oh, pee-pee time) In all of my visits, food has pretty consistent, wouldn't say outstanding, but good enough for me to make return visits.  Service is upbeat, and the servers do try to promo their specials.  Sometimes, the kitchen  will back up, but I've never had food that arrived lukewarm or cold."
Elizabeth A.,"San Mateo, CA",63,151,,4.0,3/28/2011,The stuffed mushrooms are great! mini pizzas and salad are just right meal. They have some killer clam chowder and caeser salad. Load baked potatos. The service is hit and miss...like last night...honestly thought our servicer hated the world.
John M.,"Hayward, CA",0,22,12,1.0,10/26/2013,Usually pretty consistent food and service. However it seemed as if twice as many people were working friday with horrible table service. Table next to ours got wrong food and waited a long time. I never got my drink and our order was wrong. I will avoid this location!
Rebecca S.,"San Francisco, CA",276,372,26,4.0,4/18/2011,"I like the Cupertino location better. This FC location seems more family-oriented with kids everywhere, (or maybe i had just come on family night?). Lines for this location are way long...Food decent, service friendly-but could be faster."
Lee W.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/27/2013,I'm not a super picky person when it comes to restaurants. I want good tasting food and good service.  I would not penalize a restaurant for being crowded or noisy.  A popular restaurant tends to be crowded.  That is a sign that they are doing something right. Tonights experience at this restaurant was excellent. I had parmagan crusted scallops that were delicious. My spouse had a chicken pasta dish that was quite tasty and well prepared. We were there around 6:30 and didn't have to wait for a table for two. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items. Our drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes and our meals were served approximately 15 minutes after ordering. Our server checked a couple times it see if all was fine and refill our water glasses. I consider this good service.  I would give this restaurant high marks.
Jenifer V.,"McKinney, TX",195,355,39,3.0,11/12/2008,"I don't know if I'm just feeling uninspired today or if BJ's is just an uninspiring place ....  I'm giving 2.5 stars, but rounding up to 3 because my dad enjoyed his sandwich and it did look really good (French Dip w/ a wedge salad). Now, my mood has been a bit shady of late.  Let's just say I've had better days ..... errr, weeks.   Whatever.  Let's just say my mood has been pretty crappy.   That said, I've been to BJ's 3 times now over the years (Cupertino once and Foster City twice) and have never been wowed so I guess it's not my mood after all. I met my dad there for lunch today because he happens to like this place, but my salad was just a salad.  I mean, it was good, but it was just a plate of lettuce with some red onion, chopped artichoke hearts (mmmm) and diced tomato.  What bugged me is that I asked for some balsamic VINEGAR on the side.  They brought my salad with balsamic dressing on the side.  So again I asked for just some plain balsamic VINEGAR.  What came out?  More balsamic dressing.  Third times a charm, right?  Not so.  At this point I have 3 little dishes of balsamic dressing on the table so I just left it there and used salt and pepper.  The fire roasted salmon that came with it was pretty tasty though. So .... good mood or not, I'm not sure that I'll ever choose to come back to this place.  I do like the location though.  Tons of parking and lots of shopping nearby (Target, Marshall's, Old Navy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Sportmart)."
Tammy L.,"Emeryville, CA",25,47,,4.0,3/8/2009,"dude, what the heck, 3 stars?  I know 3 means A-ok but this is much better than other places getting 3 stars.  Great space for groups, good beer, lots of TV screens, generous portions, much better than average appetizers, pizza that is really quite good, and PIZOOKIEs that make you feel like a giddy child on your birthday, anyday of the week. deep dish pizzas are of course the highlight, real thick, real nice crust.  bbq chicken and bj's favorite are recommended.  It's a good time in all aspects, and that is well-deserving of 4 stars.  psh."
Jovi P.,"San Carlos, CA",3,25,,3.0,7/7/2009,"Appetizers and atmosphere are good Main courses and pizza are ok, nothing spectacular."
Dana B.,"Oakland, CA",166,15,,3.0,4/11/2008,"Great place to watch a ballgame and have a couple of brews.  Multiple High Def screens...with the exception of the largest screen in the Bar.   A 10' projection-type screen with dull features.  But it's cool, you can still make everything out.    The staff was overly attentive in the restaurant section.  WORK DAT TIP!   The food is kool.  My homegirl had this ""Blackened Baked Potato"" monstrosity.  Effin HUGE!  Needless to say, she had 3 beers and 3 forkfuls...DONE!   I had an appetizer and their 1/2 lb Burger.  Pretty good. The Beer at this place will remind you of GORDON BIERSCH  a lil.  Not the taste...just their signature collection of brews, pale ales, and microbrews.  Great thing about BJ's now is that they've finally stocked themselves up with outside liquor vendors.  So yeah, they serve actual alcohol in this place now...sweet!"
Rajesh B.,"Danville, CA",0,15,,4.0,12/16/2011,"Great food if you don't count calories. Bit expensive for dinner, I am a fan of their lunch specials which comes under $10. Unlimited Soup and Salad (Don't forget to get Tortilla soup) Half Sandwich and Soup combo."
K. S.,"Seattle, WA",0,52,,1.0,12/8/2013,"It's mind blowing to go to places like this where it's packed, yet the food and the service are really crappy.  I'm never going back."
Shorty P.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,204,1,4.0,8/4/2008,"We're here in the Bay Area for the weekend and ordered takeout for a late-night snack. The only reason we came here was because it was just about the only place that seemed to be open until midnight. The city of San Mateo seems to go to bed a lot earlier than where I'm from. Anyway, we ordered online, went to pick up our order, only to be told that their online ordering system is new with a lot of kinks, so they never got our order. The manager was very kind and apologetic, and he told us he would knock off 50% for flubbing up. That was very generous and much appreciated. Apparently, they only serve appetizers, pizzas, and desserts late at night. We ended up ordering a lot because (1) it was going to be half-price for us, and (2) we were greedy. We got the appetizer sampler which came with tortilla chips & spinach & artichoke dip (yummy!), avocado egg rolls (OK but a little odd), Santa Fe spring rolls (meh), and mozzarella sticks (nothing spectacular). We also got an order of sweet onion strings (tasty but way too oily) and a mini vegetarian pizza (another meh). Yes, this was WAY too much food for two people, but hey, it cost us less than $13, and we just stuck the leftovers in the fridge. We were told it would take about 12 minutes to get the order ready (seemed like an odd number - don't most people give you an estimate in 5-minute increments?), but it took more like 20 or 25. I'm giving this place 5 stars for the service and 3 stars for the food."
Andrea B.,"San Mateo, CA",953,830,1271,2.0,7/23/2008,"Ok.. the only reason I dine here, is because my friends and family like to eat here.  There is like one dish that is okay, the chicken and pasta dish.  I have had their pizza, never again.  Restaurant tends to be on the crowded side, haven't figured out why yet.  Good place to watch the game.  Restaurant is also rather loud.  Parking is easy.  I guess you could say prices are fair.  Customer service is also pretty fair."
Margarita B.,"San Mateo, CA",144,4,,1.0,5/17/2010,"If I could leave no stars, I would. 3 of us came in hoping to have a wonderful lunch, and man,  were we WRONG. It was a weekday, not even a weekend. Not at all busy. It took our drinks 15 minutes to get there. We figured, meh... the bartender is probably on break or something, no big deal. Our waitress was nice at first, then she stopped showing up at the table altogether. When she finally took our order, it took another 50 minutes for our food to get there. My order was ALL wrong. Is it really so hard to put one topping on a plain deep dish pizza? Even after I told her, she seemed to not care at all, and when the pizza came it STILL came out with the wrong topping. By then I'd given up being nice. We skipped dessert (god knows how long that would have taken, two hours maybe?)  It was the worst service I've had in a while, needless to say, I will NEVER be dining here again."
Jim M.,"Downingtown, PA",0,1,,4.0,12/3/2013,Good avocado appetizer.  Just a pet peeve of mine the dinner came out  before we were done with the appetizer.  I like dark beers and the Tatonka Stout is good.  For my dinner I selected the fish tacos and the taste was good but very skimpy on the fish....  The atmosphere is ok the music is at a moderate volume and somewhat muffles the noise of the other diners.  Our server was courteous and prompt.  Overall it was a good experience.
Michael L.,"Oakland, CA",1270,568,2315,4.0,12/10/2008,"Can't go wrong with bj's. Service is usually pretty good. Pizza and burgers are always good. My favorite is the avocado rolls they have for appetizer. I always order that when I go. Cool atmosphere, one of my favorite chain restaurants."
