Voung Y.,"Union City, CA",25,17,3,1.0,5/24/2010,"I've been here a few times with my cousin, to watch football games in the bar and I've had a great time but since BJ's opened up in newark i haven't been back to this location for about a year now.  But my girl and I just got off of work in the city and decided to head to BJs for a late night dinner and some drinks.  So we head in and were sat immediately, after being sat we had to wait a about 10 mins to be greated and asked for drinks. At that moment, we knew what we wanted and ordered as soon as he asked us if we wanted anything to drink. we ordered a couple drinks, an appetizer and a pizza. The drinks came in about 5 mins and were strong and tasty, as we were sipping, another 5, 10, 15 mins went by and no appetizer. All of a sudden are pizza arrived, we were starving and started to dig in, our server was no were to be found, he finally came around and asked us how our meal was and i asked him it was great, but didn't we order an appetizer? he told me no, and said he can put in an order if we wanted and proceeded to walk away.  At that point, i was full and tired, we just wanted to go home.  We love BJs and there food. The service at this particular BJs EPIC FAIL!"
Kay H.,"Foster City, CA",0,26,,1.0,9/10/2013,"This place shows that if you make a nice enough atmosphere, put up TVs all over the place you can put slop on a plate and be successful.  Came here the other day with my kids and brother.  My brother ordered the mahi mahi tacos and pretty much received two tortillas filled with nothing but cabbage slaw.  I ordered the soup and salad and the salad had a bunch of brown/bad wilted lettuce in it.  The soup was overly salty.   My kids had pasta with meat sauce and the pasta was way over cooked.  Our waiter was less than enthusiastic about being there.  If your cable is out and you need a place to watch your game and have a couple beers this place is for you.  If you want to eat something edible I'd go somewhere else."
W R.,"San Mateo, CA",34,51,,1.0,7/26/2010,"Good food but consistently abominable service and horribly overpriced.  Sat for 10+ mins before we saw a waiter and it got worse from there.  Our waiter was nearly invisible for the 30 mins from when we ordered until we got our food.  Had to ask another waiter to refill our drinks, she told us she'd get our waiter, who never appeared. For my money, there are two better restaurants right nearby - Red Robin and MiMi's Cafe.  If you want good thick pizza, hit up Windy City Pizza in San Mateo.  Food is nearly as good, price is 1/3 to 1/2 lower, and service is much better. Have had similar experience here and at other BJs, multiple times.  We won't be coming back"
Mike N.,"San Mateo, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/5/2013,Unless you are under 30 and enjoy loud grunge rock music don't bother to go. We had been there on several times before but they now decided to appeal only to Gen X and below. The food & beer can't be enjoyed in this setting other then by their demographic set. The manger said Corporate likes it this way and she doesn't have discretion to change it. Fortunately there are other choices.
rm c.,"San Francisco, CA",54,57,,3.0,5/24/2007,"Do you ever have those days when it's just back-to-back-to-back-to-back...meetings? Too bad it's never as exciting as the back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs the Dodgers scored against the Padres last season...LOL.   Well, yesterday was one of those days. I probably go out for lunch twice a month, if that (on a work day that is...). Yes, I'm one of those types who likes to eat at her desk while working! Hey, this is in order to get my work done so I can get home early enough to make sure Art gets a workout in before dinner! ;-) Actually, most of my lunch periods are spent breaking out in a sweat!! Something most of you fellow yelpers should also be doing to justify reviewing all of these food establishments. Huzzah. =) To think, I probably save myself close to $200/month by not going out for lunch. Although, I easily make up for it by going out for dinners, d'oh! So there are usually specific occasions I will go out for lunch: 1- it's a co-worker's birthday 2- sushi or vietnamese with good company 3- DH and RA are able to persuade me to skip a workout for other good food 4 - the ladies and gents want to get together to gossip Yesterday, #1 and #3 applied, in addition to the need to just get some fresh air.   So, we headed over to BJ's @Bridgepointe. Great place if you want to catch a sporting event during work hours. The Champions League game was on and DH and I can finally talk about something else besides fantasy baseball. Phew... Well, I've been to this particular BJ's a few times. I've always ordered the same thing here - the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad. It's a good size, easily enough for 2 people to share. The only drawback is that I think they should add just a few more pieces of chicken. I also order the dressing on the side, otherwise it's a bit too rich for me. Whatever you do, skip the BBQ chicken pizza. The menu had a photo of it and it looked delicious. I split it with RA one time and it was way too sweet. I would definitely not order that again. Service was slow. Real slow. It's also super packed here during lunch hours, with other large groups of co-workers. ;-)  Ahhh, but it was so nice to get out of the office, even for just a little bit. =)"
Luis M.,"San Diego, CA",942,693,657,3.0,5/31/2007,"Much like my fellow Yelper Christine, luis m loves the BJs!  Not too hard, not too fast, not too sloppy...what the hell I'll take them any way that I can get them.  Unfortunately there were no BJs to be had here for luis m.  I did get to try this thing called a Pizookie.  Not nearly as good as a well done mouth servicing. I did have the company of a very drunk bar patron who wouldn't stop talking to me as I waited for my friends to show up.  He just babbled on and on and kept ordering beers.  At one point he got up and said he was going home and not paying for his drinks.  Whatever dude. With that annoyance out of the way we were seated and the night began.  I really wasn't ispired by anything on the menu so I just had a burger and a few more beers.  The food wasn't bad or anything.  If you have a large group that you want to bring together somewhere this is an option, especially if you want to watch a sporting event since they have some big screen tvs in viewing distance depending on where you sit. The service was a bit on the slow side but with a group as big as ours was that isn't uncommon."
PrincessPeac H.,"Cathedral City, CA",504,408,77,4.0,9/2/2007,"I'm going to judge this place solely based on the fact that it's a chain.  You can get fantastic avocado egg rolls, BJ's proprietary beer, and pizookies at any place you go to...or maybe not. I had a beer sampler, which was fun...except I only liked two of the four beers...  The blonde was like water and the dark beer was too dark for me (which is something).  The two in the middle were great. I like the atmosphere of the place, I had great service, and I got to watch Cal beat Tennessee on a giant screen by the bar.  I'll be back."
Karsten P.,"San Francisco, CA",193,329,16,2.0,1/7/2008,"This is a warehouse dressed up like a steakhouse serving TGI Fridays-style food. The beer is alright and the service is earnest -- but the food isn't up to the ""casual dining"" ambiance they're trying to create. That having been said, this place is great if you're looking for an  inoffensive place to bring a bunch of your geek pals from work. IT hermits love this scene."
Michael W.,"Antioch, CA",53,29,3,2.0,5/23/2012,Horrible service!!! Waited an hour for burgers! This place needs to get a clue. Cold food.....
Tiff L.,"Austin, TX",174,50,17,4.0,4/18/2006,pros: Great beer friendly staff good food lots of tv sets nice clean bathrooms cons: poor/nonexistent service pinner cocktails pricy food long waits no patio tons of people too busy!!
Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9796,55587,3.0,5/4/2007,"I'm used to the SoCal ones which seem to be a bit more happening than it is here. I guess this one suffers from ""strip mall near corporate complex"" syndrome. Lots of tech folk eat here and you can gleam that by the neighboring conversations. I go to lunch to get away from that type of talk but that wasn't happening here. The menu is fairly large and the overall space has the same interior design as the others but it seems smaller and has less character for some reason. The service is decent but our food seemed to not be very hot (termperature wise that is). I think for up here the Cupertino one is much better but if you're ever in SoCal, the Lagnua Hills branch is rockin'."
Prashant S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/18/2011,"Visited 4 times Visit #1) Best veggie pizza I ever had; never had such an experience before. Visit #2) Ordered the same pizza; they put beef in it and were very superficially apologetic.  Visit #3) Ordered the same pizza;served different size / crust and type. Visit #4 and last)  Ordered the same pizza; they put salami in it and were very superficially apologetic but sprung in action only when they had no recourse. If you are vegetarian for religious or other reasons, PLS DO NOT VISIT. What kind of place [ which charges twice as much the Pizza Hut (BTW: Pizza Hut always had my Pizza right)] and makes the same mistake 3 times and are not sincerely concerned. How difficult it is to KEEP the Veggie and Meat separate?"
Coco J.,"Belmont, CA",143,510,2337,3.0,11/24/2010,"We ended up here for late night drinks; the fried articokes were a treat. My companion tried the homemade rootbeer mixed with balieys and other liquors; it was really good. Our waitress was terribly unfriendly.  Atmosphere was alright, nice clean booths with almost a cheesecake facotry feel but more sports bar. open late."
Amy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",285,735,267,4.0,6/25/2006,"I went to BJ's tonight with two of my girlfriends around 9 PM. Although there were other people waiting to be seated, our party of 3 was seated within 10 minutes. I wasn't even able to finish my conversation with the little boy I was sitting next to in the waiting area. In case you're curious, we were talking about Australia and how his dad went there for business.   We ordered Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($7.95) and Wedge-Cut Seasoned Fries ($3.95). The artichoke dip was good- our waitress said it was the most popular appetizer at BJ's. I think bagel chips would have been a more fitting coupling with the dip. I'd highly recommend the fries though. They're so much better than the ones at Red Robin (which are more about quantity rather than quality).   Our drinks were okay. One of my friends ordered Strawberry Splash, a blended strawberry concotion that was supposed to have Grey Goose in it, but my taste buds could hardly detect it. My other friend had a fairly strong drink called Amethyst which tasted like liquor and little bit like grape Dimetapp. I ordered the Top Shelf Margarita frozen which I think tasted the best of all 3 drinks."
TM P.,"San Mateo, CA",10,26,7,1.0,8/1/2013,Poor service from beginning (trying to get a reservation) to end (over 1.5 hours to get food in front of us!).  Even trying to request a split check because we were with a large group (15+) was a hassle.  The food was blah at best.  The only good things were the beer (which we got from the bar ourselves!) and the company.  I would not recommend this place for a good *quick* meal.  Probably would be okay for happy hour.
Kimberly C.,"Palo Alto, CA",240,292,66,4.0,10/30/2010,I love this place.  Yummy beers and I am in love with their burgers and their chili!
Tahoe Q.,"Half Moon Bay, CA",0,74,,4.0,7/19/2011,"I just wanted to share an incident that just happened to me this past Sunday night. While I have been very pleased with the Reno BJ's, and go there frequently for lunch, this is the 2nd time I've been to the BJ's in San Mateo.  Well locals already know: the place is MOBBED on most evenings. Same was true for this past Sunday night. My husband and I ordered the blackened salmon salad to-go. We were told it'd be just 10-15 min till it was ready for pick-up. So we strolled the Bridgepointe shopping mall and returned about 20 minutes later. Order was somehow lost? How? Dunno! But the ticket was still there in the que. The to-go gal apologized profusely, went back to the kitchen to whup some a$$, and in about 30 minutes (total time), our salad was delivered to our hands by the manager. She not only apologized, but comp'd us - FREE salad - just for our waiting for 30 min.  There are many (so many!) restaurants that would simply not give a rat's patootie if a customer waited 30 min, 60 min. It would be our fault. If we got up and walked out, they'd probably be relieved! But the BJ's in San Mateo actually epitomized some very old-fashioned customer service values.  My other observation is that despite a menu that's about 10 pages long (always a worrisome sign to me - do they nuke the food right from the CostCo pallet?) BJ's in San Mateo and Reno seem to serve consistently delicious food! It's great value for the money. You have to be prepared for some crowds in San Mateo, but I think it's worth coming back to."
Michael N.,"Daly City, CA",71,47,4,4.0,5/29/2009,"I've eaten at this restaurant several times and have enjoyed it each time. It's good food well priced. I got the turkey burger today with their tasty wedge-cut fries. My colleague ordered a thin-crust pizza. We both had salad and a pizookie for dessert.  The server was pleasant, got everything right - which isn't a given these days - and the food was hot and tasty. The manager stopped by to see if we were doing okay, which I appreciate. He was very pleasant, too. I'll be back to this restaurant again for lunch. It's just right for that."
Alice C.,"Seattle, WA",916,371,464,4.0,10/23/2008,"The food here is pretty good, as far as a chain restaurant goes.  Granted, I've only tried a few dishes---Asian chicken salad, nachos, turkey sandwich--but they must be doing something right for me to order them again.  The menu also has great variety, so if I ever decide to branch out from my staples, I will have my pick of other dishes... The pizookies (delicious ice cream piled on top of a giant cookie) are also great! I will say that if you're looking to go here midday, I hope your work place isn't strict about taking 2-hour lunches.  It's minutes from my office so that's why I've gone several times for lunch, but I've never gotten out of there in under an hour and a half, even when we told the waiter we were in a hurry.  The servers are nice, but damn...speed it up!  Or at least offer me one of your delicious beers while you're making me wait so long..."
M. T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,26,,3.0,2/8/2011,"BJ's is one of those go-to places for friends, coworkers, or family who also want to catch a game on TV. Their food isn't stellar and mediocre at best. But it's good enough to make you feel so full that you want to run a lap or two to shed the extra weight. I went here today to eat lunch and here is what we ordered: 1) Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana 2) Chicken Tenders 3) Mac n Cheese 4) Oreo Pizookie The chicken parmigiana was pretty good for the first few bites. The cheese and spaghetti sauce gave a nice flavor to the chicken breast. The spaghetti is only ok and tastes like something you can make at home. The chicken tenders were dry and not special in any way. The mac 'n cheese tasted really cheesy and also not spectacular. The only thing that saved lunchtime for me was the oreo pizookie. I've had the other ones before and think this is BJ's standout dessert dish. If I come here, I always want to order this. My boyfriend suggested I try the Oreo one. I've never ordered it in the past, thinking it'll taste artificial in flavor like the original cookie version. But I was thankfully proved wrong. My first bite into the pizookie was like heaven almost. The straight-out-of-the-oven, melt-in-your-mouth first bite was delicious. I was so full by then but took every ice-cream topped bite with glee. I highly recommend the Oreo pizookie next time. The food isn't memorable so if you come here, don't expect much. Just enjoy the company you're with and root for your home team."
