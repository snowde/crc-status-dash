Ray N.,"San Francisco, CA",62,44,3,5.0,9/7/2009,- Great burgers & pizza.  - Good bar selection.  - Not a good place for kids (TRY RED ROBIN NEXT DOOR). - More upscale ambiance. - Service with a smile (all 5 times we came). - A bit on the pricey side. Will keep coming for lunch and dinner!!  Yumm...
Kristi D.,"San Jose, CA",83,230,2,4.0,4/13/2007,"For the sports-bar-esque-chain-restaurant category I place this into, it was quite good!  Compliments: Yummy cheese fries. Able to grab a booth at the bar and avoid the wait (40 minutes, um, no) Friendly waiter. Yummy pomegranite marghertas. Complaints: Hyped as Chicago-style pizza. There was no sauce on top, it was semi-deep dish, but not real Chicago style. And the cream cheese was kind of a gross touch. But still good enough for morning leftovers. Margheritas were yummy, (but weak).  Who would wait 40 minutes for this?! Are people crazy? That's like waiting 90 minutes to go to Elephant Bar. well we arleady know people are crazy, but yeah.  ---- I'd still go back if I were with people insisting on this type of establishment, and it's decent food that didn't make me ill with good service. :)"
Ryan T.,"Mountain View, CA",374,796,152,4.0,5/28/2007,"Really good portions and actually better than I expected, especially for places in the realm of franchised/chain outfits! I had the scampi pasta with the Brewhouse blonde--seemed to work very nicely. Fresh, well-seasoned shrimp and a good amount of garlic. I could have used more tomato, however. Great service as well. Looking forward to another visit."
David O.,"Foster City, CA",15,205,727,3.0,10/18/2010,"So been here a few times, and came back again recently with niece and nephew, this is a good place for burgers fry's appetizers, kids meals, beer and watching sports on the LCD's that are thought the entire restaurant. .... The kids had spaghetti and loved it, OMG I don't even like spaghetti so it must have been good, and kids get crayons coloring/activity sheet to keep them busy which was very nice. All in all good burgers, wings drinks and service will be back soon...."
Kapo T.,"San Francisco, CA",51,283,811,3.0,3/14/2008,Big portions for decent prices.  This location is not as crowded as the Tanforan location in SSF/San Bruno.  Maybe cuz it's not in a mall?  Great place for big parties. Got a sports bar and flat screen TVs.  I've had their pizza before and it was good - both deep dish and thin crust.  My favorite is the chicken wings appetizer.
Yummy P.,"Hayward, CA",8,64,26,4.0,12/1/2005,"I was there once, @ 12:30 AM, and this was the only place that's open in the 10 mile radius that wasn't an IHOP, Danny's or in-n-out. We sat a booth @ the bar and three of BJ's own managers were sitting in another booth checking out the waitress' ass and talking about how they'd hit it hard. That's when i know this is the kind of place i'd full in love with  Oh, and the food and beer was okay"
My V.,"San Bruno, CA",10,80,1,5.0,2/19/2008,"BJ's is known for three things: pizza, beer, and pizookie (warm cookie dough with ice cream)! If you stay within those realm you are good. I've been to the restaurant about 5 times and out of those 5 times, I've strayed away from the above-mentioned menu 3 times. I wanted to try new things to see if their other food that really that bad. Needless to say, I was right. The pasta was overcooked, the salad was tasteless, and the sandwiches  were forgettable.  But, their pizza, beer, and pizookie were awesome! They serve deep-dish style pizza and they have quite a few pizza selections. I had the Sweet Pig pizza (sausage) and it was so good. Pairing that with a BJ's house brew beer was perfect. Then, wrap up dinner with a pizookie will surely satisfy your sweet tooth. So, for the food describe above, I give the restaurant 5 stars. For everything else like service or atmosphere, it was ok."
K K.,"Los Altos, CA",0,46,5,4.0,4/28/2013,"This is a very busy place but people are kind and nice, and that makes up for waiting time. Food quality is good. If you are luck to get a table at the bar, you can start your appetizers and drinks while you wait for your table."
Samuel W.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/20/2013,"We were invisible to the waiter! We sat while he waited on others and we kept trying get eye contact! Food is usually pretty good, but waiting kind of makes you lose your appetite! Will NOT be back to this location."
Christine K.,"Menlo Park, CA",84,566,11,3.0,7/19/2007,"This is a regular hangout for the gang b/c of it's oh so convenient location (right off 92 and across from Target) and Hot Rob luuuvs the sampler. It's pretty much always crowded but we nearly always manage to get a table in the bar and avoid the wait. Food is your standard pub fare, with a few different things thrown in for variety. I really like their avocado egg rolls for example. Their nachos are killer too, instead of beans, they put chili! I get a calzone every time I go there, excellent crust. Pizookie of course deserves a shout out, b/c they are The Awesome. Warm, freshly baked cookie smothered with vanilla ice cream (and sometimes whipped cream). To. Die. For. The service is generally ok. Never outstanding but most of the time perfectly acceptable. Except for the last time (last night). Our waiter took forever to give us menus and bring us our drinks. The appetizer arrived simultaneously with our food, we were never brought waters and had to ask for silverware. Were only checked on once during our meal, our waiter left at the end and reassigned us but at least she was better than he was. Still took entirely too long to get the bill. My favorite part about eating here is the shopping at Target afterwards, which has now become tradition."
Elizabeth G.,"San Jose, CA",208,325,10,3.0,1/10/2008,"This isn't my favorite BJ's location.  It's always crowded, and just not that great.  In general, I love their pizza... love the buttery crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  P.S.  Pizookies are amazing!"
Chef J.,"San Carlos, CA",3,34,,2.0,3/1/2011,"Loooove BJ's.... just not this one. Service needs work, FOOD needs work. I'm gonna say it's safe to say that a restaurant should reflect the standards of it's management, which is most likely where the problem lies with this location. It just feels like there's a bunch of robots workin there. Sorry guys, I'll stick with the other locations. THEY don't make me ""return"" my purchase before I even walk out the door...."
Matt K.,"San Mateo, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/10/2009,"Went here late last Friday night with my brother. Sat in a booth close to the bar.  Went in for happy hour, but learned they don't do that on Friday nights. I was kind of bummed, but I guess it makes sense.  Our waitress was Lindsey and she was awesome. She told us about all the beers and made a couple suggestions. I had a Jermiah Red and the stout (forget what its called). Both were great, liked the red better. Waitress was really attentive and even made fun of my brother when he ordered a girlie cocktail.  I asked her what her favorite burger was and she said the california burger, so I got that. Reeeeeally good. Just a little spicy. I've been to this bjs a couple times, but always sat in the restaurant. When I go back I'll definitely sit in the bar. Faster service, friendlier staff. Oh and the music was good too. A mix of 80s hits and classic rock."
Brent T.,"Belmont, CA",87,380,30,4.0,2/22/2010,This a good late night place to eat.  I usually try to find a seat in the first-come-first-serve bar.  I rarely sit in the dining area.  The bar area is great because of all of the tvs.  The food is very good.  Last night I had the Thai lettuce wraps and the chicken wings.   I was stuffed.
Blake E.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,15,1,1.0,7/31/2013,"Do you like terrible food with service to match? Well then come to BJ's where the service is always dreadful, and none of the food is prepared fresh. Think of it as like a Cheesecake factory brew pub, with  an endless menu of food that is horrible for you - except it  also tastes horrible too. I work nearby and have had the pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and everything is equally bad."
Andrew Z.,"Redwood City, CA",32,229,13,4.0,7/6/2008,"Went here the day after the 4th of July for lunch. No wait to be seated. The waiter was friendly and quick. He re-filled our drinks with-out us having to ask. They have a very tasty turkey burger. I will definitely be back for their  ""classic turkey burger"""
Annalynn C.,"San Francisco, CA",89,360,51,1.0,10/13/2006,"I know BJ's from So-Cal.  I fell in love with their Pizookie in Westwood and was excited to try it again in Burlingame.  I was so disappointed!  The service was atrocious!  It took 15 minutes before our server took our order and while waiting for our food, the server forgot to refill our drinks.  Our appetizer was not served at all; I also had to request for them to remove it from our check.  At the end of our meal, I requested to speak with the manager, who apologized for the poor service.  He also gave us a gift card to make up for the mishap, so we would be tempted to go back and try the place again.  We returned to take advantage of the $20 gift card, but service had not improved.  I can't say I won't ever go back because I like the Pizookies (I'm a huge dessert fan!), but it will be a while until I return... I'll probably be back when I forget the service was so terrible and the vicious cycle will repeat all over again."
Theresa A.,"CA, CA",16,34,1,4.0,10/8/2008,"They have redeemed my faith in waiting for a table at any BJ's Brewery (see my review at the BJ's in San Bruno).  After being told I had to wait 3 hours at another BJ's for a table of 8, I called Foster City.  I wanted BJ's Brewery food for my birthday and nothing else.. hehe. They immediately took my name and put me down on the waiting list.  No hesitation. After driving from San Bruno to Foster City which is about 15-20 minutes.. we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving. Not bad considering the waiting times at most BJ's are usually an hour or more especially on Saturday nights. Thank you BJ's Brewery Foster City for saving my birthday dinner."
Allan T.,"San Francisco, CA",37,166,8,4.0,12/12/2008,"While doing some shopping in the mall out here, I decided to stop by and get some grubbin to get me through the long lines and crazy shoppers that were out .  Trying to be healthy I ordered a cobb salad and it was excellent.  Service was good and the waiter was friendly.  A bunch of Saterday college football games were on.  It was a good place to stop and rest before heading back out into the crazy christmas crowds.  Didn't get a chance to get a pizookie but it's probably better for my diet anyways.   Nice bar, good food, great service.   What more can you ask for?"
Winnie L.,"San Francisco, CA",29,114,,4.0,1/15/2007,"Come here for the buffalo wings.  They fry the chicken wings so that the skin is crispy and drizzle the buffalo sauce on the wing.  The sauce comes on the side so you can add the sauce to your liking.  The flavor of the sauce is a very standard buffalo wing sauce.  The crispiness of the chicken wing and all the sauce I want is simply AWESOME. The jambalaya is the other thing I normally order and this is also very good.  Loaded with plenty of ingredients, such as chicken, sausage, shrimp, bell peppers.  Warning, this dish gets spicier as you eat it but it's oh soo  good. The service is always pretty good whenever we're here, but the wait on the weekends can be sort of crazy, so be prepared to wait.  One time upon waiting, they did bring buy small pieces of their deep dish pizza. I'm not a deep dish fan, however, I did have a couple of bites the last time my bf ordered it and I have to say, the crispiness of the crush and bottom was very good.   I'll be back for the buffalo wings."
