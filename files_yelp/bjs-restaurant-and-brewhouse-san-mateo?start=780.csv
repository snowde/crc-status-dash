Heather T.,"San Francisco, CA",17,41,,5.0,12/11/2007,GREAT food GREAT drinks HUGE space I love this place. What's not to like? You have to try their Pazookies...hands down the best thing on their menu!
Chantal D.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",27,199,15,3.0,6/10/2008,"From being in SLO and loving the mom-and-pop, independent restaurants and shops, I'm back in the Bay and not too fond of these chain restaurants. It's not that they're bad, but I don't appreciate mass-food in mass-quantities anymore... unless it's Todai haha. So it's really nothing 100% against BJ's Restaurant, it's just these places in general I guess.  But onto specifics.  Most of the food on the menu is mediocre and not too memorable, with the exception of a few things... and I wished they'd slim down the menu (though people rave about how there's ""something for everyone here,"") because half the things like some pasta dishes and those 'pot stickers' that you can probably buy at Costco are, well, not really worth the money you throw down.   What IS worth my +/- $5 is the half-off, happy hour priced mini (10"") pizzas!!! ANY OF THEM! As long as it's a mini size, it's half off... So that's cool. 3-7pm and then late at night again, and also a dollar off drinks... that's enough to keep me coming. And those delicious pizookies."
Sparkely K.,"San Mateo, CA",467,832,159,4.0,2/1/2008,Every morsel of food I've eaten here has been really good.  The two Lemon Drops I had recently were *strong*.....hiccup. Loud inside.  This place is huge.  Nice to go here with a group as we did. Update 6/25/08: Just had lunch here with a good friend and had to add to my review.  I'll stick to drinks/appetizers at BJ's as the lunch I had was not flavorful at all.  My friend had appetizers and that food was great.  Sigh.  I should have done the same.  :(
Eric F.,"Vista, CA",24,29,4,3.0,1/26/2011,"Their food is kinda greasy these days, I'll probably stop coming here in the future if I can't find a dish that isn't grease tastic."
Clive T.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,22,,5.0,7/1/2012,Excellent customer service and very good estimate on waiting time on father's day dinner nite. Very clean and organized on a very busy day for outside dining. Will definitley go back.
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,2.0,3/8/2008,I don't get it... Maybe I am missing out on something.. The beers is terrible.. I mean it is really bad.. I drink beer often and this place has some crappy beers... The food is ok... They have a wide range of bar type food... Small pizzas.. Burgers... Ok... Not that expensive... The service is provided by younger kids.. It shows... I shouldn't expect much more... It is what it is... Overall.. I wouldn't go back on my own unless others suggested going... There are soo many other places... Go to Devil's Canyon if you want a solid beer...
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,7/2/2006,People marvel over the bizookies but you can seriously make those at home. They're still good though!  You have to wait a little while to be seated but it's good thing it's part of Tanforans mall so you can browse around while you wait.
Marie B.,"Redwood City, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/2/2013,Another bad experience at BJ The other times we let slide But not this one We ordered to salmon dinners & 1 steak & lobster. 1 Salmon was ok the other was 2 small slivers & I mean slivers of salmon mashed potatoes small also The steak was less than 1/2 of the size with a very small lobster tail. I have ordered this before so I know the size it should have been. The salads also was very small compared to other times. The manager could only say I am sorry. Well I am sorry too. We have worked in this industry far to many years to know there is more you can do beside I am sorry. Because of other times of bad service wrong food delivered do not give this place your business or on one of your visits you to will be sorry too
Mary L.,"San Francisco, CA",87,121,1,3.0,5/27/2008,"who's bright idea was it to call this place BJs?? My birthday celebration consisted of 16 really rowdy people...and in any other restaurant, we'd probably get kicked out but here at BJs we were free to run amuck. :D Combo appetizer plate- Yum Spinach and Artichoke pizza- Yum Pizookie- Yum"
Elias F.,"San Carlos, CA",59,28,1,5.0,1/14/2011,"Bj's is a pretty great restaurant and bar.  I've been there more times than I can remember, and I don't think i've had something I didn't like.  The burgers are good, the homestyle cooking is pretty good, and their pizza's are fantastic.  If you like deep dish pizza, I would recommend the BBQ blackened chicken pizza, the Mediterranean pizza, or the cheeseburger pizza (or anything else that sounds good.)  Their beer list is pretty great, including some good brews like Guinness and Sierra Nevada.  Being a brewhouse, they also have 6 or 7 house beers.  On a friend's 21st birthday we all had the beer sampler (where you get a smaller glass of each beer), and I enjoyed most of them, and didn't hate any of them.  Their happy hour is great with all house beers and cocktails being a dollar off, and mini pizzas and appetizers being half price.  The thing I like is that their happy hour is twice, once from 3-5, and again at 10 to midnight on weekdays.   Love this place.  Comfortable, delicious, and friendly."
Jeanne C.,"San Francisco, CA",291,888,209,2.0,3/2/2010,"The mini veggie pizza I had here was soooo much less than mediocre! Ahh.. what a disappointment. Bland and doughy, just what I don't love in a pizza. Had to pile it with red pepper flakes, which I got after I had already eaten 3/4 of the mini pizza. Sad story indeed. It was somewhat redeemed by the pizzookie (chocolate chip and vanilla ice cream). The hef beer was pretty good too.  Everything on the menu looked like it was 700+ calories minimum. I am usually against chains... and for a good reason. Funny thing to me is that it was PACKED for a Tuesday night. I guess I am just not adjusted to suburb life and chain eating! I would come back if I needed my greasy fatty food fix.  Something about it makes me seem like I need to come here in 10 years with my husband and small children."
Durif M.,"Belmont, CA",5,392,83,3.0,9/12/2008,"Casual place with good beer with OK food. We each ordered the 7 beer sampler but that was way too much for us.  Sharing might be a good idea if you're not a big drinker. Their pizzas and baked potatos are great.  Beware though, the portions are huge."
Chrys U.,"Union City, CA",12,134,17,2.0,9/3/2008,"I had always heard about how great the pazookies were and all that...so I decided to give this place a try tonight. At the front, we were told it'd be a 5-10 minute wait. The wait ended up being over 20 minutes. Byebye first star! We're seated, get our menus, order. The waiter definitely was not the friendliest guy I've seen...and as for the food, that took another 20-30 minutes (though it felt much longer). I honestly think the reason why this place seems so busy is because their food is SO freaking slow, so the table turnover isn't that fast or something. Ooops there goes the second star! The food was actually quite bland, not flavorful at all. Then came time for BJ's to redeem itself...with the pazookie. Another 20 long minutes after ordering it (although I guess it takes time to bake the cookie or whatever), we dig in to the pazookie only to find it unbearably and unnaturally SWEET. Like wayyyy too sweet...that it became a chore to finish. And that never happens with me and desserts. And now I'm at home writing this review and I feel nauseous like I've gotten food poisoning *sigh* and so thus...third star's gotta go... I really do think that for this price level there are much better restaurants with better food and service. Ugh..."
Elaine S.,"San Francisco, CA",198,442,16,3.0,8/26/2007,"Cobb salad and Pazookies are SOOOOOOOOOOOO good! The pizza is a little on the greasy side, actually so is pretty much everything else on the menu. The wait is usually pretty long, but for the Cobb salad, pazookies and beer, it's so worth it, especially if you are with a group."
Gita P.,"Belmont, CA",13,57,,4.0,9/13/2008,"This is an update of my previous review... I still love BJs for its great food including a vegetarian pasta dish, the steaks (hubby's favorite) and the salads.  I also love the fact that they are happy to accomodate picky eaters.  My minus one star:  I am not impressed with the mixed drinks selections!!  I have ordered margaritas and other mixed drinks.  I ordered the top shelf margarita--my favorite standby.  It is made with fresh lime juice and a splash of orange juice...mine tasted icky...a bit bitter instead of the smooth, crisp taste of a good tequilla, and lacked the tangy sour of the lime juice.   My hubby and I have made a pact to NOT order mixed drinks next time around!  The last time we went, the wait staff took the drink back to the bartender to fix the drink...it is a hassle and not worth the bother.  My recommendation, stick with the wine and beer selection. We are hooked on the great food and service at BJs.  We went last week and our waiter was Alex.  He was attentive, asked all the right questions and made great recommendations.  We have ordered pizzas, steaks, wedge salads and avocado egg rolls.  Everything is always really tasty, exactly as we ordered and fast!.  The place has a pub/ sports bar feel where you eat quick and run or lounge and enjoy the game.  Check it out, you will not be disappointed."
Jessica C.,"San Mateo, CA",157,156,7,3.0,9/15/2007,"It's a toss up between a 2 or 3. 2 because the food is ehhh but 3 because it's the closest bar to me since it's right across the street here in suburbia. The pizza - is okay, the other foods are alright. The burgers look okay. The fries are alright. Best thing - probably their beer selection?  This is the type of place workers go for Friday Lunches, corporate suburban lunches, family go for dinner when the dad/mom doesn't want to cook dinner, the Chevy's of American food. And where you go on a weekday night for a drink with a bud...because again, I can walk here. The food is forgettable but the convenience to San Mateo people...perfect. It's nonthreatening except to your waistline. Where else can you go do your errands at Target, go buy a space heater at Bed Bath and Beyond, grab a Mother's Day card at Hallmark, snatch a clearance suitcase at Marshall's and grab a meal? BJ's at Bridgepointe."
Frank C.,"Belmont, CA",271,96,28,3.0,12/25/2006,"The nearby Red Robin's was closed, so we walked across the parking lot to BJ's, which was still open at around 7 pm on Christmas Eve. (I know, I know, it's an untraditional choice for holiday dinner, but we're humoring the kids.) We've been here twice, and both times have had the traditional deep-dish Chicago style pizza. (Note the chain originated in southern California, so if you prefer to have Chicagoans make the deep dish, you'd best look elsewhere.) The kids love the pizza, but they love any pizza, even Round Table. I find the pizza good but not great, the service friendly, and the atmosphere lively. One thing I like about the pizza is it's not too greasy. Sometimes the deep dish pizzas can be a little too greasy on the crust side as the restaurants go for maximum flavor (mmmm...fried bread).  BJ's pie strikes a decent balance. We loved the pizookis, as did many other Yelp'ers.  We got the cookies and cream variant, which is essentially a warm Oreo cookie-cake-crust thing covered with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and some kind of whipped mouse topping. Tasty -- but eat fast, since the warm cookie layer will quickly turn your ice cream into ice cream soup (as my kids call it)."
Gerald C.,"Oakland, CA",118,598,27,3.0,5/19/2007,"Eh.  Pretty standard beer brew fare.  Maybe I've just been to too many BJ restaurants.  They seem to close up here pretty early on Friday nights - around midnight.  Anyhow, they're reasonably negotiable with taking our large after-show cast parties of 10-30 people.  But it's not terribly cost-effective when you're bringing a whole bunch of kids along.  Nice and spacious on the inside and pretty clean. OH!  I know what the problem is.  I'm hoping for an experience similar to the Tilted Kilt in Tempe, Arizona.  Ah, sigh.  EVERYONE MUST GO TO THE TILTED KILT!! (Sadly, San Mateo is too prude to ever allow anything like that)"
H C.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,153,,3.0,6/27/2008,"This is more a place of convenience than a destination.  I actually don't like their entrees much (I think a lot of them are pre-prepared and then heated).  I ordered the meatloaf once and the middle was cold while the outside was hot. Service while generally friendly is slow and it always is on the busy side there.  So expect a wait for a table or to stand if you decide to go to the bar area. So, why do I keep going?  I like their buffalo wings.  I just keep getting a craving for them.  So, most of the time, I just want to go have a brewhouse blonde or two and some wings.  I've found nothing else in their thick menu noteworthy.  Happy Hour isn't much of a bargain.  I think appetizers are a dollar or two cheaper during HH. I give it a three for its wings and cuz I keep going, but it's really a two star place."
Ignatius D.,"Belmont, CA",15,111,7,2.0,3/22/2010,"It's a sports bar. With food. Really a place to bring your guy friends who don't want to have to wear a shirt with buttons. Food is ok, service is ok. Nothing exciting."
