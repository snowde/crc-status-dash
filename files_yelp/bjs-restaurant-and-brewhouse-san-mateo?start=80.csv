Renee B.,"San Mateo, CA",1,16,,5.0,9/5/2017,"Love the bar at BJs and my special bartender Angelina!  I'm a fan and appreciate her great service.  The bar is usually crazy busy and Angelina is never too busy to get me a beverage or food.  The rest of the bar staff is great too.  Super service oriented and always willing to put my game on one of the 7 TVs.  Truly a great place to get a drink, a meal and a game.  Thanks bar staff!!"
Sahar F.,"Sacramento, CA",110,9,3,1.0,11/7/2017,Our food literally tasted like luke warm and soggy leftovers. Don't recommend at all.
Tony G.,"San Mateo, CA",0,17,1,2.0,9/3/2017,"Decent food, nothing great but a good variety for everyone. What is always a horrible experience is their to go service. Always slow with a line when pick it up. Always get it wrong so I have to hold up line more untill they get it right"
Joseph S.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,1,1.0,5/10/2017,BJ's serves an extremely small steak which is very misleading. I'm not a big person but was still hungry after I ate.
Sheba B.,"San Francisco, CA",2,48,,3.0,12/28/2016,"We came here not too long ago during the late afternoon and our waiter (Zach, Zachary?) was awesome, thin, youngish guy with black hair and a short beard. We were a small group of four, and the place wasn't very busy at all, which maybe is why (Zach) was able to attend to us so well. So, the stars are basically for him. It's basically a chain so, how can you really rate it. The menu sort of reminds me of an Applebee's and a Chili's rolled into one, with less options. The food is ok. It feels you up, with some leftovers if you're not too greedy. So portion sizes are decent. We were seated in less than t0 mins. We received menus and beverages right away. Our orders were taken and the food came out shortly after...hot. Zach kept the free refills coming while my cousin kept the poor guy hopping with her numerous requests. Throughout it all Zach continued smiling and responded professionally and positively. Behind closed doors he probably cursed us out! But who could blame him."
Shanise M.,"Redwood Shores, CA",307,301,1888,3.0,10/20/2015,"I have a weak spot for big chain restaurants like BJ's... the food is oh so average and the prices are oh so high - but it's just something about these restaurants that make me keep coming back!? I've been to this location countless times since I was a kid - even had one of my birthday dinners here when I was about... 14? 15? Strange times. Anyway - I've been back a few times in these recent years for appetizers and drank. Usually not here for a full meal because it's so $$$. Appetizers are big enough that they can be split - portion and money wise. BJ's has their own brews which is such a huge plus for a chain restaurant. Although their brews are average, I still enjoy trying what's available and the occasional seasonal ones. Plenty of guest brews (tap and bottle) which rotate from time to time.  Huge ass menus. It's hard to pick something every time. I usually end up picking the same ol' thing just to avoid the indecisiveness. I've gotten the carnitas fries twice now and I was surprised both times as to how good they were... the fries were extra thing and crispy just how I like. All their pizzas are also usually really good. Burgers are pretty average though they hit the spot when you have a burger craving. Everything else is pretty so-so. Fun to just order new things sometimes to share with a group. Service has been okay - can be really slow at times but waiters are friendly. Food takes forever to come out. May as well call in an order before you arrive... When it's busy, waiting and food service gets even slower. Thankfully, I don't really come in during rush hours anymore - I just stick to early afternoons now. Your average chain restaurant. Probably best to go in a big group or on game days if you want optimal fun and don't care for slow wait times."
Rohit S.,"San Jose, CA",264,119,273,2.0,12/12/2016,"Really slow service, brought us some other table's order, and kept us waiting when there were a bunch of empty tables. We waited 30 min for a table when the place wasn't even full! Food took a long time to get out, took us about 30 min for food. Don't know why this location is so much slower than other BJ's restaurants but they need to get it together. Food itself is your standard fare and it's got well placed tv's."
Ron L.,"San Bruno, CA",6,143,17,5.0,12/30/2016,"They make a great gluten free pizza for not a lot of $$ and I have never had a bad reaction after eating there. My mom likes the ribs and my wife likes the calamari. Like Sheba B says, Zachary is pretty darn attentive! As a side note, I live closer to the BJs in Tanforan but would rather drive the distance to this one. Much better service."
Ismael C.,"San Mateo, CA",4,3,1,2.0,8/21/2017,"The food is pretty good, decent pizza and wings. The service here is terrible though. Waited over 30 mins to get my order taken, and another 45 to get our food."
Ed C.,"Eugene, OR",0,10,,1.0,8/28/2017,"Apparently not all BJs were created equal. I've been to BJs in other cities a few times and were pretty satisfied. Probably there are too many fancy restaurants in the Bay Area and this BJ just gave up trying to compete. In fact, a Dennys would beat it hands down. The waiter/waitress pair were careless and indifferent. Silverware and napkins, and later on, meals, were thrown at the edge of the table - up to us to move them into position. It took a very long time for food to show up. When it did - we got wilted salad greens, rubber-like asparagus, overcooked meat and under cooked rice pilaf. Presentation was messy too. The floor surface was also dirty. One glance at it killed the remaining appetite. A weak link in the BJ chain."
Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,17,,1.0,6/19/2017,"Deceptively false advertising. ""deep dish"" pizza is a misnomer. Bait and switch, false pretense, whatever. Call it thick crust, but it's not deep dish. Their photos with cast iron pans are lies - they aren't deep dish at all. Very upset I bought $100 of BJ's gift cards, to get deep dish regularly, and it turns out to be just regular thick crust. Fast creation - only 15 minutes, however the pizza was NOT hot - had to go back and microwave it. While they offered to remake it or comp a dessert/salad, I said no. I want it made correctly, the first time. I don't want to waste 15-20 minutes for you to fix what should have been done correctly. Additionally, the pizza was smashed against the side of the box when I received it. Very disappointed. California law says merchants are required to redeem a GC for cash of under $10.00. I'll burn off my gift cards that way"
James W.,"Sacramento, CA",104,16,4,4.0,11/4/2016,"I could easily give this review 1 star but that would be completely unfair. Went to a later dinner with my gf and her parents. We all ordered and our food came out about 15 minutes later. My shrimp tacos were cold so I asked them to refire and this is where things went south. The food never came back out...5 min...10 min...15...20. Finally I cancelled it because everyone else was done.  I give this 4 stars because the manager was really kind and provided the shrimp tacos anyways and took a little off the bill. She turned a bad experience into a palatable one and for that I am thankful. I didn't catch her name, but thank you!"
Nancy C.,"Belmont, CA",51,227,2191,3.0,7/5/2016,"We like to come here when there's a big sporting event going on and to watch on their big screen tv's however, the food is just ok. Ordered many dishes at different visits and we still come away saying...just ok. The desserts are really good though, especially the pizookie."
Rich B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,7,,2.0,8/14/2017,"Told 20 minutes for seating. So I decided to sit in the bar area at an empty booth that was just vacated.  Nasty, took 15 mins to clear the dishes."
Lisa M.,"Palo Alto, CA",35,9,4,1.0,6/19/2017,Very slow service and the waitress was unbelievable rude. Got our orders wrong and still was rude. This women should not work here at all no tip from me
J J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,24,,2.0,11/2/2017,"It has a spacious environment but they do not  allow you to sit at a table you request. They do not bring water to the table unless requested. Food is served in a timely manner, and waiting staff tries their best to accommodate tables being understaffed. We were a group of 5 uncomfortable being seated at a booth so asked to be relocated to a table where we could have a bit of space in between us. It for some reason became a complicated request which ruined the evening. It could have been a very pleasant experience."
Stephanie S.,"Foster City, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/27/2017,"The place has terrible service. I was served food without utensils, they took 45 minutes to bring me marinara sauce for my mozzarella sticks. I have never had such horrible service at a restaurant."
Janet T.,"San Mateo, CA",918,211,,4.0,3/7/2017,"Stopped in close to 6:00pm, with a friend, for a bite to eat. Actually I prefer the San Bruno location better (personal preference, that's all) but traffic won over this location tonight. It was crowded when we arrived, not super packed, but it got more crowded & noisey as the evening wore on.  We were seated & served rather quickly. Our waitress was nice, a tad bit scattered, but not a deal breaker. We ordered Avocado Egg Rolls, which I could happily eat a whole plate of these. Delish, as always!  I ordered Fish Tacos (Well, it is STILL Taco Tuesday, right?) which was good. Not great, but hey it's tacos!!  Something just didn't seem right with the tortilla, but I ate it. My friend ordered the same and thought it was yummy! BJ's.....Not a great place, but good food, lots of TV's (much better if a local game is on) and consistent. Would I return?  For their appetizers, YES!"
Porsche C.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",1564,958,20079,3.0,4/14/2015,"A happy Hour that starts at 10pm till midnight? Okay, I'm down!! I came here for Happy Hour with a friend close to the late night Happy Hour time and was able to find a booth at the Bar area which is known to be ALWAYS crowded! I know BJ's is a chain restaurant but I have to admit im not big on the chain restaurants but I decided to give BJ's a try! They also have their own brews,  not bad, right? They have about 8 regulars in their lineup and a few rotating seasonals. Service is quick and friendly. Our server was amazing and always had this amazing smiley face! The atmosphere is pretty modern and commercial but it's nice After glaring at the Happy Hour menu for a while I wanted to order everything! HA. Everything on the menu looks good from the Deep dish Pizza, Chicken Pot-stickers, chicken wings, Mojito drinks (different flavors).....The list goes on and on... What I ordered: ~Chicken Wings- delicious!! The sauce on them was the topping to it, fresh and piping hot! (Rated 5\5) ~BJ's special Deep Dish Pizza- Comes in 4 small slices, yummy and crunchy (Rated: 5\5)  ~Chicken Lettuce Wrap- Although it surprising looked good, I wasn't that tasty to me...I wouldn't order this again for myself but I believe the only reason why I was turned off is because the flavor of sauce that they give with the dish. (Rated 1\5) Drinks: I ordered the Lemon Drop and I must admit that I enjoyed it! for the pricing it was decent. I was also able to taste the Strawberry Mojito and found that to be very good as well! I got the chance to glance at BJ'S full menu and have to admit that I am missing out and have more to taste on the menu. This is not Good-bye BJ...It's, ""I'll see you later"""
Urueta G.,"Belmont, CA",557,11,,5.0,1/18/2017,Beers are always good ... specially the pm porter and their Heffenweissen ... came for a drink an appetizers...
