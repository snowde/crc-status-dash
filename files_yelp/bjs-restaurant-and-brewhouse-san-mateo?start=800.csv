Jim T.,"Hayward, CA",0,532,3,3.0,2/22/2011,"BJs is busy, lively, and has a lot of menu options. The deep dish pizza is popular but was more like Pizza Hut than Uno's or Zachary's. I want to try other dishes before possibly changing my OK rating."
Steven V.,"Burlingame, CA",4,94,8,3.0,1/2/2011,"Just an okay place.  Beer quality is below average, but they usually have bottled Belgian beers available too (I'd recommend skipping the restaurant's own beer).  The food is fine and on par with other brewpubs, not bad and nothing exceptional."
Jon T.,"San Mateo, CA",74,36,,4.0,2/16/2009,"Good beer, fun food, good happy hour, pizza great, nachos tasty, avacado egg rolls pretty darn good. Did I say good beer?  Service varies, sometimes great, sometimes not."
Jeremy R.,"San Francisco, CA",192,312,26,4.0,8/1/2008,"This place kind of gets a bad rap... I doubt I would go here for dinner but the lunch specials are awesome. You can get a half sandwich with fries an it includes a full salad either ceasar,house or wedge ... all for under $10.... not bad at all. I haven't really had a bad food experience here... I mean .. you get what you expect... it's chain pub food. If you are into a large menu and maybe getting a dessert not to mention some cute hostesses and waitresses ... go here.... oh yeah .. call ahead to get your name on the list."
Julie F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",119,221,10,4.0,3/3/2010,"Great pizza and service. We split the buffalo chicken pizza (mmm), ceasar salad, and a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was $2.95 and beware, it has bacon in it, if you care. The pizza was great though, as was the service. They also have a nutritional information chart for every item in the menu, which was interesting to read, and helped us make an informed decision when choosing what to eat.       FYI I think the buffalo chicken pizza was the healthiest one on the menu, which you suspect."
Emily M.,"Redwood City, CA",174,742,6,4.0,5/5/2008,"A big group of us (about 14) came here after a teambuilding event (indoor skydiving - yay!!). It luckily was not lunch, but not quite dinner time, so they were able to accommodate us. We went crazy with beer, margaritas, food, and last of all, the Pizzooki. I had heard tell of its magical mindblowing qualities. And I was not disappointed."
Karen S.,"Taber, Canada",3,129,1,1.0,7/16/2008,"I do not know why I continue to come to this place. Well, I do know why... my dd loves this place. I can't say she does so for any reason other that the cute waiters working there.  On our last visit it was so nice that we didn't have to wait long for a table. It was not so nice when we got sat at the last table in the place, right next to the kitchen. We saw our server three times... to order to bring the check and to get the change back... it's a good thing I didn't need anything else! Every time a server came running out of the kitchen, I braced myself for a plate of food to come flying at me... fortunately I was not wearing white. It was too loud,  service was shite and once again, and the food gave me a stomach ache. Even dd gave it thumbs down.   Star for the boy watching, no stars for food, service of atmosphere."
shelley s.,"Redwood City, CA",1,5,,1.0,6/21/2011,"We had our traditional after opening night cast dinner at BJ's and did have a reservation.  We still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated and 90 minutes for service.  Our producer had to order her beer 4 times and even went up and waited for it at the bar.    We'd booked it for the following weekend of our show and cancelled, as it was such a disaster.  They also charged us $200 over on the bill...not goin' back.  There is no Tomorrow!"
Kristie G.,"San Mateo, CA",31,97,,4.0,7/9/2010,"This place has the best happy hours!  Their mini pizzas are half off, their $1 off their draft beers , and $2 off any appetizer. Here are some appetizer recommendations: CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS AVOCADO EGG ROLLS CRISP POTATO SKINS PLATTER CHICKEN WINGS SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP   Everything is standard bar/gastro pub food.  There is nothing super special about BJ's but when you want heart-clogging greasy, yet oh so tasty food, you can be sure that this place is consistent! I agree with other yelpers, this place is very very noisy so don't take a date here!  However, a group of co-workers...a great place to commiserate with the comrades."
Gina M.,"San Mateo, CA",1,40,,3.0,10/1/2008,"Food is good, and nice atmosphere as well. I ordered the roasted chicken once and it was so dry I couldn't even eat it. Since then I stick with ordering the half sandwhich and salad, and haven't had a problem. The pazookie is sooo good. I usually get half and my friend gets the other half, but the last we went there the cookie was raw. We sent it back, but that took another 20 minutes.  Great meeting place, or night out with friends."
Bob G.,"San Mateo, CA",16,100,2,2.0,2/7/2008,The 2 stars is strictly for their lettuce wrap appetizers.   Other than that they'd get no stars.   The worst service ever!!!  If you're sitting at the bar the bartender can be right in front of you staring into space and never notice you need a drink. I've had waitresses forget to bring the check and waiters argue with us when we requested lemons in the hefe (you see it's got its own lemon flavor....just get us some flippin lemons!!).
Kristin G.,"Reston, VA",123,422,13,2.0,4/1/2008,"The food here is average at best, but for some reason it's always crowded. I only go here when forced by coworkers and proximity."
Tracy Y.,Bay Area,131,148,396,3.0,5/12/2010,I've been to this BJ's twice once for dinner and once for lunch and both times the meal was good. I really like their cobb salad because it reminds me of a club sandwich but without the bread. The service is a bit slow but it's not as slow as their location at Tanforan. This place is good for lunch if you've got the time to sit and enjoy good food and company.
Michael M.,"Niterói, Brazil",77,119,69,3.0,7/15/2007,"I usually don't do chain pub food, but every once in a while you want some comfort.  BJ's was actually pretty tasty.   1. Buffalo Wings - unbattered, meaty, not to spicy, came with a side of bleu cheese and extra hot sauce (kudos for the extra hot sauce, feel the butt burn) 2. Thin crust sausage pizza - fresh, crisp, and tasty; for those who enjoy really thin crust 3. Garden Medley Salad - many ingredients, most importantly no olives, zucchini, or mushrooms. And the best part, dessert!  They have these cookie things called Pizookies.  They are cookies baked in a little pan and topped with ice cream and whipped cream (great for my diet).  BJ's donates money to Cystic Fibrosis for every Pizookie they sell; if eating a tasty dessert helps find a cure for a disease I will have another Pizookie! (RIP cousin Johnny)."
qirk z.,"Los Gatos, CA",81,1126,375,2.0,6/25/2008,"Yuk. So second time around, I tried something else... i got the Calzone, with Pepperoni and Sausage. The Calzone tasted like a frozen pizza... you know, that sauce taste and frozen sausage taste. I had planned to eat half and save the rest for next night's dinner, but I knew if I did that, I wouldn't want to eat it. So I did what's best and ate the whole awful thing in one sitting. If I go back, I'm sticking to the bbq chicken pizza that I liked the first time. Now  that last comment in my original review makes sense..."
Lisa G.,"San Mateo, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/12/2013,"went to bj's last night, my son absolutely loved the place ,ther sport's TV . great food , child safe atmosphere , and fun!!,fun!!!! fun!!!"
Mina B.,"Foster City, CA",6,33,,3.0,3/4/2008,"Two stars for the delicious fish tacos with chipotle dressing, one for the fresh-brewed Root Beer. NONE for the service!  Roomie and I decided to go here after even I was getting tired of Asian food ever night, and we'd had Italian the night before. Plus I'd just had a lot of dental work and wanted something soft.  I'm always eager for fresh root beer; the root beer was really good, it came in an icy mug and was fresh and not overly fizzy. However it took our server a good 20 minutes to even find our table, much less take our orders. I give him credit that when the orders were in the drinks and food came quickly, but he barely spoke to us and not once did he come back and ask how our meal was going. There were no less than 10 servers floating around the place and I couldn't understand why the service was so bad. You'd think people who make their living off of tips would be friendlier.  Roomie got a Chili & Cheese Potato, which was okay according to her. There was not enough chili, making it more or less a huge baked potato with cheese piled on it. I took a bite and though the potato was perfectly cooked, it wasn't as advertised and certainly not worth $8.95. The halibut fish tacos on the other hand were great. I have mentioned before that I'm sensitive to spicy foods, but the chipotle mayo was very mild, leading me to quip ""This must what it's like for people who like spicy foods."" The vegetables inside (red cabbage, carrots, onions and cilantro) were very fresh and crispy, but the fish itself was a highlight. Deep fried in panko the halibut was light and flaky and not overly fishy.  For dessert we split a Pizookie, but I was underwhelmed. Sure warm cookie dough with ice cream on top is delicious, but I very well could have done the same at home. Plus some of our cookie decided that the Tin Pan was it's BFF, and stuck there for good.  Overall, the food was good enough to come back, for me at least, but the service assures that I never will. Pity."
Henry P.,"San Mateo, CA",0,12,,1.0,1/17/2013,"Another and last chance.  This time the wait staff said they were out of and didn't have any martini glasses  WHAT! How can a so called bar be out of martini glasses. Does the manager ever come out of his office to check what's going on....I don't think so!  At the end the wait staff delivered me the wrong bill, not surprising at this point."
Antonio A.,"South San Francisco, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/12/2013,"Customer service was good but toward the end of our family lunch, we ordered 3 pizookies.  2 chocolate chip and 1 raspberry white chocolate almond. We waited for 30 minutes or so for them. The waiter brought 2 chocolate chips out but not the raspberry. He told us that it would take a few more minutes...we waited another 15 minutes until the waiter came by and told us the cookers messed up on the raspberry order and asked if i wanted to wait or remove that order from our check. I asked how long more would I wait for the raspberry pizookie and he said  10 minutes.  I told him forget it and just remove it from my check...but then, I waited for more then 5 minutes for my check (I could of just waited for the damn pizookie). They just didn't seem sincere about us waiting for so long."
shaun l.,"San Francisco, CA",103,271,10,3.0,9/1/2006,"Surprisingly pretty good pizza for a brew house.  Think pizza hut back in the mid 80's when their pan pizza was still pretty decent.  The crust is light and airy... pretty light on the cheese and toppings... Crust is to greasy though. The beer was just average to good.  We got a pitcher of their brown ale which was much better than the hefeweizen.  The hefeweizen wasn't terrible, but it was lacking that hefeweizen flavor."
