Janty S.,"Eugene, OR",19,38,,4.0,9/27/2006,"Despite being a chain, this gets Four Stars because it has three things on Sunday:  1) NFL Sports Package to watch Buffalo Bills games  2) Decent Bar Food  3) Space  DISCLAIMER: While the food is not spectacular, it does have some passable, All-American things (like baked potatos) and beats the food at the 3rd Street Bar and Grill in San Mateo.  You can also get half portion salads that are still humongous.  I just kick back with the New York Times while the BF has beer and football."
Adena D.,"Redwood City, CA",282,115,2,4.0,2/19/2007,"I've spent one too many nights... and dollars... at the San Mateo BJ's. For a place to go ""hang out"" and ""grab some grub,"" the food is rather expensive. Still, I prefer it over TGI Fridays by a long shot. The place has a very different vibe during the daytime compared to its late night hours (when it typically gets a crowd from local theater companies and other people out celebrating one event or another). This is a good place to bring a group of people. It's huge and usually the wait isn't long, even with a large group.  My menu favs --  Appetizer: Avocado Egg Rolls (Yum!) Meal: Veggie Burger Beer: Jerimiah Red Mixed Drink: Sour Apple Margarita"
Andrew Y.,"San Francisco, CA",179,1352,,3.0,6/16/2006,"Ok, I've been to BJ's at a different location and I liked that one. I was expecting sort of the same thing at this one, but when we ordered our first pitcher of beer, we were deeply disappointed. We ordered a pitcher of the Hefeweizen. The beer was really dark (not the unfiltered yellow look). The beer looked almost brown. We asked the waitress, what the deal? Her response was that it was the bottom of the barrel. Here's the problem. If you're giving us the bottom of the barrel, don't give us the bottom of the barrel. She was completely unsympathetic to the situation. No discount, no worry that we hated the beer and that she probably wouldn't stand for it if it happened to her.  Anyway, even though I play hockey next to restaurant, our team still chooses to bring their own beer for post-game."
Jojo G.,"Fremont, CA",73,95,101,4.0,8/17/2006,"Their home brews are great. I love the blonde and red. I like the brunette too. The servers look great and are friendly. This place is always packed though so prepare to wait. Their chicken wings are always deep fried first then basted in spicy sauce. I love it. Its not soggy like chicken wings from most hooters (yes, i actually go for the wings when I go). I would recommend the ""Great White"" pizza if youre in a mood for a meal. They are deep dish Chicago style so order a size less than what you normally would at delivery pizza places. Did I mention the servers are great looking?"
Arvind V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/11/2009,"This is a excellent place to have some good food, good beer and watch sports. The beer collection is excellent(they have their own brews and a few name brands) and have all sports going on throughout the day and night. The food is good. I would recommend the Santa fe spring rolls with their santa fe sauce(one of the best i have ever tasted), the california chicken sandwich and crispy fries."
Yan M.,"San Francisco, CA",224,1443,654,3.0,4/25/2006,"We went here for a company's team dinner/get-together. Food was mediocre but came in huge portions. I had the chicken salad since I wasn't very hungry but other colleagues ordered deep dish pizza which looked pretty good and others had salmon, salad and baked potato, etc. It was crowded for a Mon night and prior to going, we were forewarned of the following notes:  - They will only seat full parties. - They will only hold the table for 15 minutes. - They will not split the check. - We can only have the table for 2 hours. Pretty strict for a place like BJ's.  Interesting fact too that our colleague mentioned that during the recent Xmas holidays, all the flatscreen TVs in BJ's were stolen! Mind you, there were probably 5-6 in the entire place stuck to each corner wall. The thieves even attempted to take the jumbotron TV but apparently it might have been too heavy for them to lift it out of the restaurant!! So bizarre!"
Robert L.,"San Francisco, CA",61,235,2,3.0,10/30/2007,"Don't get the sesame chicken salad.  While the chicken is ok, the salad consists of only the non-nutritional parts of salad/ lettuce.  This place attempts to be nice, the servers seemed nice enough.  But through some unorganization or something, they forgot about our table, then forgot about my lemonade.   Three stars cuz it's not a place I'd care to come back to. Other restaurant/ bars would probably be better for Monday Night Football and other sports."
Jenny K.,"San Francisco, CA",145,107,9,4.0,11/4/2007,"I held a baby shower for a co-worker at BJ's. The food was pretty good and the service was friendly. I like their BJ's Famous Pizookie the best. The pizza is also great!!  You have to consider ordering the BJ's barbeque chicken pizza  & BJ's Favorite combination pizza if you give this place a try:) Another good thing they have a bar where you can watch sports, drink beer and just hang out.... The wait time is not too bad, better than the wait @ Elephant Bar."
Dustin H.,"Foster City, CA",217,209,2,3.0,11/6/2007,"I think that this place is mediocre. The food is okay, but I think it could be a little less expensive for my tastes, then again, they are obviously trying to cater to a certain crowd.  I usually get the Fish and Chips, which usually has waay to much batter on in for it's own good. The Pizzas are okay. The pastas are really good, but I feel sick after eating it. Of course, the namesake, the Pizzoki is awesome and should only really be eaten in groups. Of course no one actually finishes it.  The service is pretty horrendous. It's a bunch of obnoxious high schoolers or community college kids who are ""too cool for school"" and for good service apparently. They would literally just walk by you even though you ask them politely for the check. I remember our group was asking for the check, but no one was bring it to us. And then our waiter and all of his other waiter friends were schmoozing in the corner and he goes ""Oh these kids are taking soooo long. I just want to leave"" I was seriously about to slap him."
Miriam L.,"Milpitas, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/20/2012,"Very bad service, waited for a long time and they forgot to add us to the list. Then our waitress let us wait for 20 min before she took or order. I had to complain to the manager in order to get a proper service."
Donna Y.,"San Jose, CA",381,716,1,4.0,1/12/2009,Came here to eat after the DYK event. We were all famish from the hike and wanted a place to go with variety for everyone. We decided to come here. We had to wait for 20 mins since we were a party of 7 but once seated we all knew what we wanted. Our server was nice and accommodating. I ordered the Honey Fried Chicken Salad and that was good. I was trying to be good since we just did a hike and I didn't want to add all the calories back. Overall it was a good lunch and a great place to watch games.
Jennifer M.,"San Francisco, CA",81,159,14,5.0,12/15/2009,BJ in Foster City is great came here for a work gathering and it was a blast!  Thank you to the staff that was able to handle 20 very hungry people.
Sarah L.,"San Mateo, CA",3,30,1,3.0,11/3/2012,"Just got home from this BJ's location about a half hour ago. When we first walked in to the restaurant, it was packed but we were hungry so we waited the 30 minutes for our table. When we were finally seated, we read over the menu and our waitress took our drink and food orders. We started out with the mozzarella stick appetizers which were GREAT!! Then, we waited a little while for our entrees. I got spaghetti with meat sauce which was okay, but not as great as I can remember it being. It wasnt exactly hot, but it wasnt exactly cold either. It was just in between. My mom got the potato skins with a side salad, both were very good according to her. My dad got the chicken marsala which he also enjoyed as well. For our drinks, I got a raspberry iced tea. My mom got a chardonnay, and my dad got a diet pepsi. Overall, we did not have a bad experience. Service was a little slow, but they did have a party of 16 people that they had to serve so I can understand why it was hectic. Our food was good, we ended up taking food home because the portions are so big. I would most likely return again, but maybe not at 6 pm on a Saturday night. Maybe 5:30 or so, that way we beat the dinner rush crowd."
Fre D.,"Lathrop, CA",37,7,2,4.0,8/25/2008,Pizza is good. But the best part about this place is the White Chocolate Pazookie!!!!!
Ikeb I.,"San Mateo, CA",18,248,,2.0,5/16/2006,"I guess for a chain restaurant, it delivers what is expected. But for the price, i'd imagine you could find something more unique and worthwhile. Then again, maybe youre just into chain restaurants *shrug* In any case, i got the Bowl of Chili... which was hearty but on the salty side. I guess that's why i had to down 3 tall glasses of water to dilute the sodium! Everyone else's dish at my table looked pretty big, so at least you'll know this place doesn't skimp. The wedge fries were good. But isn't almost everything fried yummy? We got a table immediately for 5 people and service was adequate... a little clumsy but attentive enough. The atmosphere was fine as well, clean, lots of space, flat screen televisions at every angle and nice warm colors. Seems like a nice/safe enough place to hang out/eat in a group if you want to stay local."
Melissa H.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",7,16,,3.0,6/29/2010,"Had dinner here on a few occasions with some friends and despite the place being busy, our parties (between 3 and 5 but sometimes as many as 15) were seated quickly and had drinks and appetizers out pretty quickly afterward. Each time, the servers were helpful in making menu recommendations and paying attention to details like refills or splitting checks. Excellent service! The food on both occasions was not particularly different from other chain restaurants that serve American styled dishes. In some instances on the menu, the prices were slightly higher than anticipated for the same dish at an equal quality dining spot.   I had a Parmesan Crusted Chicken that was a bit on the dry side with relatively little taste and served with decent mashed potatoes but overcooked broccoli. Another time, it was a nicely done buffalo chicken deep dish pizza with celery, red onions, and grilled chicken with tangy buffalo sauce and ranch--it was definitely worth coming in for. Our group also ordered Pizookis (table of 15) and they were nice enough to make multiple pizza (large) sized cookie/vanilla ice cream desserts for us to share. Great for large groups, families and people who like that sports bar vibe and all-american food!"
Ana N.,"San Francisco, CA",83,98,17,2.0,3/21/2011,HORRIBLE BJ'S. maybe it was just the wrong timing but our server sucked! she seemed pushy and didn't get our orders correct and brought out our drinks 15 minutes later. the kitchen needs to heat up their food a little more because my pot roast came out luke warm . NOT HOT. it's like it was sitting on the line for ever. i just wanted to leave .
Edward L.,"San Mateo, CA",1091,238,43,4.0,12/2/2008,"Great place to meet up friends, watch sports or just drink and have a good evening. Happy Hours are usually the only times I visit BJs as their deals are alright.  I like their buffalo wings and their mini-pizzas."
Chris S.,"San Mateo, CA",44,15,,4.0,6/1/2010,"This was my second visit to this place and went away happy and full as I did the last time.  The beer itself is average at best.  I like the red ale the best, followed by the pale ale...wasn't really impressed with the lacking flavor of the so called award winning Hefe.  The food, however, was quite good.  We ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls and potato skins for appetizers and had the meat loaf and fish taco's for dinner.  The spring rolls were great.  Nice and crispy, not too greasy and came with two nice dipping sauces.  The potato skins were some of the better ones I have had.  My wife said the fish taco's were very good and the meat loaf was great as well.  They could have gone a bit lighter on the salt with the meatloaf though.  The chedder and garlic potatoes and the mushroom gravy that came on top was excellent.  Service was fine as well.  Would go back for just the food."
Brian J.,"San Mateo, CA",7,36,2,2.0,5/28/2010,"Average food for a not so average price. That is how I basically sum up my BJ's experience. The food it ok and expensive for what it is. One thing I do like here are the pazookies (spelling?) So if in the area, looking for dessert, and not a lot is open give it a try. Lotta ifs involved however."
