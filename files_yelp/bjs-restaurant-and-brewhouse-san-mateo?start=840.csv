Adelina W.,"San Francisco, CA",171,413,693,1.0,12/8/2010,"This review is for this location only. These incidents happened a couple years ago, but I haven't forgotten about them. I think about it whenever I drive by. The first time I came here the waitress got my pasta order wrong. No big deal, I got chicken instead of shrimp. When the pizza came out, it was stone cold so we had to send it back. Nothing was good about our order so the manager came by and apologized, even offered us a free pizza to take home. It was a very nice gesture and great customer service as far as I'm concerned. The second time I came here was too much. The reason I will never come back. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers, nachos and a pizza. Everything was fine until I bit into my first slice of the pizza. I want to throw up as I'm writing this. I had a hair stuck to the pizza crust. This didn't look like hair from your head. I immediately flagged down the waiter and told him what I found. His response was ""Oh gross."" Well, no kidding! He told the manager and he apologized. We were offered a new pizza, but I had already lost my appetite. The food was comped and I left very unhappy. I debated on writing them about the incident. I decided it was necessary and got an immediate response. I was offered gift cards to give them another try. I decided my money and appetite were better off somewhere else. I haven't and will never return to this BJ's."
Raymond H.,"Daly City, CA",176,47,,5.0,9/7/2012,Good food! Great service! Very nice manager! He gave us a pizookie on the house and discount off the bill! Always nice to know a person who works there! FTW!
Greg C.,"Brisbane, CA",25,160,1,2.0,3/15/2010,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants and BJ's is a prime example of why.  I have no idea why so many people pack this place when there are so many other good restaurants around?   The reason we came here is because we took my little cousin out for dinner and this is where she wanted to go!  We got there at about 6:30 and there were a lot of other people waiting, but surprisingly, we were seated within about 15 mins.  Not bad.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, we got a chicken pizza and also shrimp pasta and mac n cheese for my daughter.   Although our waitress was really nice, It took FOREVER for our food to come.  And when it did, it wasn't impressive. The burger was overcooked and dry, the pizza wasn't deep dish like deep dish is supposed to be, and the mac n cheese was supposed to be the blue box kind, but didnt taste anything like it!  Bleh!   I guess their idea of deep dish pizza is puffy bread?   I wasn't into it. So then, our waitress hands us off to another guy because she's going on break and we order the Pizookie.  10 mins go by, 15 mins, and maybe even 20.  The guy comes over and i start to ask a question and he immediately cuts me off and says 'it's coming right up in a minute' and walks off!!  WTF??  I thought it was overly rude to assume he knew what i was going to ask, even though that was what i was going to ask.  Haha  Jerk!  So then 5 mins later he comes out with the Pizookie and tells us that another server took ours and they had to make another one.  Fanfuckintastic."
Jason A.,"San Mateo, CA",71,53,2,3.0,3/25/2009,"I've been to BJ's on more than one occasion and I will admit that it has good food. I find it hard to make a decision on what I want though I always order the same thing; the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with Applewood Bacon and Cheddar Cheese. Personally if I didn't have to worry about gaining weight, I'd be here every night. Why do I give it three stars though? Unfortunately I think the service could improve. Every time I go here, I always notice the same issues; 1) Appetizers arrive seconds before the main course. Personally, I think there should be some time in between the Appetizers and the main course but maybe that is just me. Though it does lead into the next issue; 2) There seems to be a rush to get myself and whomever I am with to eat and leave. I can understand that the place is trying to make money but there seems to be an urgency to order and then give us the check as we're still swallowing the last bit of food. 3) What's up with the waitress or waiter disappearing after the food is served? The one thing that seems to irk me and whomever I am dining with is that the waiter/waitress that disappears after the food is served and ignores the fact that there are drinks that need to be refilled. I know, once again this is a busy establishment and there are other tables but if you advertise refills upon request then your server should not disappear and forget about drinks or any other needs that need to be attended to. Food is great, like I said though the service needs improvement. Sorry yelp, only 3 stars for this one."
Candice S.,"San Francisco, CA",61,220,4,4.0,1/17/2008,"I was so excited that the Bay Area had BJ's restaurant!  I recently moved here and BJ's used to be a local spot that friends and I would frequent while in college.  It's a nice micro-brewery that also has great food.   I usually order the same thing everytime I go here but generally, everything I've gotten is really good!  I'm obsessed with the Santa Fe salad w/cajun shrimp!  It's sooooo good! It has a mix of cheeses, avocado, black beans, a corn salsa and tossed with a chipotle ranch dressing.   For the most part all the BJ's restaurants I have been to are pretty laid back and casual.  It's a great place to sit at the bar and watch a game if you're in the mood!  Definitely order a pizookie if you go here! Soft, ooey-gooey, cookie pizza for desserts are the BEST! :)"
Macy D.,"San Mateo, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/19/2012,"Their service has tell on down.  They forgot my spoon for the soup.  By the time I got someone attention, it was already cold. They also forgot to give me back my credit card."
Jennifer P.,"San Mateo, CA",35,40,,4.0,10/15/2007,"As a vegetarian, it can sometimes be hard to find decent food at chain restaurants like this.  I did have to settle for a salad, but it was huge and really good.  (Field of Greens, I think.)  I had it without the feta and asked for avocado instead.  MMmmm.......   It has mandarin oranges and glazed pecans and a great raspberry/walnut dressing.  The second time I went and ordered this, though, they forgot the avocado and added way more nuts than I could finish.    My husband had their veggie stuffed baked potato.  Not many veggies and smothered in cheese; I'm sure most people like things smothered in cheese, but it was a bit too much. Lots of tv screens playing sports, so my husband likes that!"
Denise B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",6,55,33,4.0,11/21/2007,"I've been here several times and the food is generally really good and they offer a wide variety. The pizzas are pretty tasty but my favorite is the Angus Beef Dip Sandwich, it's the best one I've ever had.  Sometimes the service is a little lacking but for the most part, it is pretty consistent. I come in for lunch once a week or so and sit up at the bar. They have a ""Lunch Punch Card"" you can get and every 7th lunch is free. I think you have to ask for one. I must have been here at least half a dozen times before I was offered one."
Anthony M.,"Mountain View, CA",1,72,1,4.0,8/16/2008,"3 stars Food  5 stars Beer Not the best beer in the world...but I love beer, and im glad its micro brew.  Hope the beer maker is a fat guy!!!!!!"
tom b.,"Millbrae, CA",0,31,,2.0,8/7/2010,"Ive been here a few times and there food is always salted to liberally. They dont even have eggs at the restaurant which I wanted added to my burger. there pizza is okay / I rather eat at red robins there burgers are better, there staff more frendly & attententive"
Jeralyn K.,"San Ramon, CA",68,77,39,3.0,10/23/2009,"All I can say is GREAT BEER, esp. their Nutty Brunette & Jeremiah Red!  Pls. don't take your kids here during the lunch hour rush, esp. on Fridays, LOL.  You'll be more than like inclined to switch tables after hearing the loud, profanities of companies such as the one I work for ;)"
sandy k.,"San Mateo, CA",0,9,,3.0,7/29/2008,"Every time i go to Bjs its always busy, so as a result the service isn't so great, but i keep comming back for the food (which does take forever).   This time our server was Kathrine.  She took care of our needs and was an interesting person to talk to.  so for her i give a 5, but for all my experiences combined i give a 3. because it just takes too long to sit, get your drinks, food, ect. PS. i looove the beer there!"
Millbrae R.,"Millbrae, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/25/2010,"Nothing but negative things out of my experiences here..... Service was REALLY SLOW!   I went here twice the past couple months, and the food MADE ME SICK both times.  Each time, I ordered something different, the first time pizza, and the second time I had the angel hair pasta. And other people in my party got sick from the food as well.   It was not pretty. So, the next day after being on the toilet all night, I called the manager to inform him of the situation, just to let him know they might not be preparing the food as efficient as they should be.  He apologizes and then said he would call me the next day to check up and see how I'm doing.  Well, he NEVER called me. Never heard from him.  Talk about Professionalism and good customer service. *cough* WON'T BE RETURNING TO THIS RESTAURANT....EVER."
ST1223 T.,"San Francisco, CA",60,74,2,4.0,12/18/2009,"I love this place and for various reasons... A) It is SUPER close by to my house and to work so I can swing by after work with a co-worker or meet a friend for a drink. B) Their food is pretty good and has a great variety. C) I like the bar area and how you can just walk in and find your own seat if any are available. D) I do my annual b-day happy hour there ever December, and invite a group of girls and it's always a GREAT TIME!"
Regina B.,"Belmont, CA",166,94,61,2.0,1/26/2009,"Oh BJ's.. I always come back here having faith that the service had improved.  It never fails; something always goes wrong or my party ends up waiting ridiculously long to be acknowledged by our server! I admit I enjoy the food, the have a lot of good things on the menu for being a chain.  The first time I came our appetizers and drinks were comped by the manager because we waited so long to be greeted by our server.  Second time, was having lunch with a friend I hadn't seen for a while and was embarased that I took her to a place with such poor service; again we just waited way too long for anything.  This third and possibly final time, my meal actually cane it wrong I had asked for a bacon cheeseburger and got no bacon no cheese and no server even coming by to see if everything was alright.  As a matter of fact the server that was helping the table next to us noticed we were breaking our necks searching for our waitress ego apparently went on her break or something!  Yet another server came took our dessert order and then maybe 10-15 minutes after my friend and I had dessert the original waitress came with the check. Maybe next time I'll get it to go."
John G.,"San Mateo, CA",0,16,,4.0,4/10/2014,"food was blah, the avocado egg rolls where good beer was good staff was really nice but i can't recommend anything from their dinner menu, all i enjoyed where the appetizers i didn't finish my dinner because i wasn't a fan, but the beer appetizers and staff got it a 4 star i would have been 3"
Chris Q.,"Palo Alto, CA",3,47,,1.0,11/16/2008,"This could have been a four star experience, but they totally blew it by leaving a toothpick hidden in our wedge salad.  My girlfriend had to pull it out of the roof of her mouth - ouch!  When we let the manager know, he did apologize and comp the salad.  Ok, fair enough.  But then he said that his had been happening a lot lately.  Hello??  Perhaps this problem should have been addressed before my girlfriend cut her mouth open! Otherwise, a pretty good experience.  Debating on whether to go back."
Shaila L.,"Seattle, WA",89,15,,4.0,11/24/2009,"This was one of my favorite pizza places when i lived in San Diego so when I moved to SF a few weeks ago I was happy to find BJ's here too. The deep dish pizza is very tasty, not to be confused with chicago style though. Definitely try the pizookie!  Overall, it's a bit pricey but the leftovers will make for a second meal. Also try the house cider, very good."
Cathy L.,"San Francisco, CA",17,91,,4.0,9/7/2011,"god i love me some surburban food and BJ's does it just right.  had the nachos (ridiculously big), boneless wings, and the classico pizza.  all hit the spot (sure you may have heartburn later but it is totally worth it).  and of course you have to finish it off with the pizookie.  sweet jesus this is the most genius idea of a dessert.  the mini is just the perfect size, so glad they are offering that option now."
Kymberli C.,"Clayton, CA",136,1486,5781,4.0,10/22/2008,"I've been craving BJ's for awhile (that sounded dirty lol)...  we came here for dinner and had our ""usual"" we shared a small pizza and split the garden vegetable potato and house salads.... this was our only real meal of the day... so we had to go all out... the food came out fast and it was all really good like always... Stella had the Berry Cider which I tasted because the color of it was really pretty.. and that was really good! It had a really sweet after taste that lingered in my mouth even after a few minutes.... and of course we had to finish it off with a PIZOOKIE.  The service was friendly as well."
