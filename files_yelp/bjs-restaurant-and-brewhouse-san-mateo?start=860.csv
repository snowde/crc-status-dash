Alex O.,"Castro Valley, CA",24,77,1,5.0,10/29/2008,"What's not to love about a place called BJ's.  They have good beer and ciders and tasty food.  My wife loves the ""black and white"" pizookie (half chocolate chip/ half white chunk macadamia nut).  Tasty."
Kurt W.,"Foster City, CA",2,30,9,2.0,8/16/2009,"This rating is based on several visits for lunch and dinner.  While an extensive menu, I've never found anything I cared much for except the occasional HUGE baked potatoes and of course the Pazookies.   Other than those, the food is nothing special and neither are the beers, especially for a ""brewhouse"".  Service has always been a mixed bag though mostly sub par.  There is the occasional server who really is efficient with a pleasant personality to match, however more often than not, they are rushed.   So after so many visits, what finally compelled me to write a review?  Unfortunately it's not because of a positive experience.  This afternoon one of the people in our group suggested to go here for lunch.  I wasn't particularly hungry so didn't mind.  It wasn't too busy for a Sunday, so we got seated within a few minutes.   There were a couple of empty tables around us, but otherwise brisk business.   We quickly decided what to drink, we'd be ready as soon as the server came by......which after 20 minutes, never occurred.  Not one server stopped by our table.  We clearly had our menus closed in front of us and no water or drinks at the table.  If I'd really wanted to eat there, I would have asked someone to help us, but why the heck would I go and ASK to be served in a restaurant????  Finally we gave up and just left the table, but not before I found the manager and told him why were were leaving.   He of course offered the obligatory apology and said he would get someone, but I told him there was no point (after all, they'd probably just do unmentionables to our order).  I was calm but very direct.  On our way out, the host cheerfully thanked us which prompted another explanation of our hasty departure.  He too apologized and offered to serve us himself, but again, I'm not stupid. So this pretty much has done it for me.  I work close by so often times we have group or business lunches here, but not for me.  It's unfortunate as I know many of the people that work there truly do their best but I'm not going to support such inconsistency, chain or not."
Natalie A.,"Davidson, NC",0,20,,2.0,11/8/2010,"I only come here when my boss wants to take our group out to lunch.  The food isn't very good, but the portions are big.  So...come here for quantity over quality."
J N.,"Whittier, CA",0,11,2,4.0,5/26/2008,"This place is 100 times better than Elephant Bar. Great beer and big portions. What more could you ask for?  I try to have something new each time. On my last visit, I had the black olive and pepperoni deep dish. Wow. The best meals I've had are the chicken fried steak, Jambalaya, and of course the deep dish pizza. Don't come here if you are not hungry.  If you're into beers, the wait for a table can be short. The service is what you expect for a popular place."
Posi P.,"San Mateo, CA",7,30,3,1.0,2/18/2009,"I've been to this BJ's many times, mostly out of convenience. Now I just refuse to go back. I have never gotten good service, not even decent from the staff. The bartenders are pretty cool but thats all I'll give 'em. I will literally drive 20 minutes out of my way to the San Bruno/Tanforan BJ's because their service is always tip top."
Andy O.,"San Francisco, CA",5,46,,3.0,9/6/2009,"I was in town for work and went to BJ's with a friend because we were looking to have a few beers, grab some food, and watch some football.  Drank some Piranha and ate the California burger.  I wasn't blown away by the beer but the burger was outstanding.  I wish I had had half another burger when I was finished.  I'm generally not a sourdough fan but after this I'm going to have to rethink things."
Paulina C.,"San Francisco, CA",231,131,,3.0,7/7/2008,"woman: you like BJ's?  man: hell ya!!!!!!!!!! woman: cool man: you? woman: i heard it can be a hit or miss man: what do you mean? woman: sometimes it tastes good and sometimes it doesn't man: i see..... woman: i've only had it twice.  i've been lucky tho cuz both times were real goooood. man (thinking): two times, that's it??????????!!!!!???? FIRST TIME: jambalaya SECOND TIME: 4 mini sliders and minestrone soup love that they have big flat screens everywhere!  enjoyed watching the AVP game on the big screen this weekend.  i like this location a little better than tanforan mall.  the grub is decent.  our waitress was nice.  i'd definitely go back - i like BJ's   :)"
Matthew J.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/10/2010,"Somehow my friends and I ended up here on a Saturday night.... We got a few beers and watched the basketball playoff games on their big screen. The potato skins were hella good and I would come back any day just for that! Service was a bit slow and prices a bit high, but overall I really enjoyed BJ's."
Josephine L.,"Walnut Creek, CA",44,55,,3.0,1/4/2009,"three stars for good portions and decent food. perfect place to have dinner and watch the game. nothing special about any particular dish but all around decent food. i've tried a couple things here from the pizza, baked potatoes, to the chicken and of course the pizookie. it's basically like a cheesecake factory but not quite as good. i'll probably come again but not something i'll be craving. note: chicken and ribs were not worth the money. save yourself a buck and get a pizza or burger instead."
Hilary G.,"San Bruno, CA",14,18,,3.0,1/27/2009,"I wasn't going to write a review about dinner last night...but as I sit here eating the leftovers, I think a review is warranted.  We've tried to go to BJ's a few times, but always end up at Red Robin next door because this place is so packed. Since we were in the area last night, we stopped by to see and, alas, there were tables available! (Of course...it was Monday...but whatever.)  We walked in the door and were seated right away. I ordered a diet coke...but they only carry Pepsi products...which doesn't normally bother me. We ordered the Santa Fe egg rolls ( I think that's what they were called) and a pizza with artichokes and tomatoes and spinach. We waited for quite some time (which I anticipated for the pizza...but not for the egg rolls). At this time I tried my soda. For some reason, the diet Pepsi tasted a bit odd. I decided that I would order some water instead. The egg rolls finally arrived...and then our pizza arrived maybe 2 minutes later. I hate that! Why would the egg rolls take as long as a pizza? And why wasn't the pizza put in a little later so we could eat our appetizer before our meal arrived? Regardless, both of these were brought out by someone other than our server. We waited and waited and waited and finally our server stopped by. I requested some water, which I had rather quickly. The pizza and egg rolls were FANTASTIC. Its quite possibly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The sauce per pizza ratio was perfect...the crust is amazing...overall it scores a 10!  We finished our meal and then waited and waited and waited for our server again. She was never even in the area! She finally stopped by and I asked for a box for the leftover pizza. The box she brought was too small....so we waited and waited and waited for her to stop by again so I could get another box. Anyone noticing a pattern here? Our server was DREADFUL! She dropped off the check and was gone in a flash! She finally brought me a normal sized box and we were gone.  Moral of the story...fantastic food....terrible service. I'm not quite sure how to rate that...so I went with 3 stars. If i could give 2.5 I definitely would.  What's a girl to do? Do i return hoping for better service? Do I write them off entirely?  *sigh*"
Tiffany H.,"San Francisco, CA",31,160,13,3.0,7/11/2009,"I didn't want to like it, but it was actually not bad.  The food was decent for a chain, greasy of course, but we had the thin pizza (which was pretty yummy actually), the clam chowder was ok, avocado eggroll--wasn't a fan, the jambalaya eh, the steak--better than i expected.  So, overall, I'd go back if I'm in the neighborhood--thus the 3 star.  Crazy."
Mrs. H.,"San Carlos, CA",0,6,,1.0,2/16/2012,If there was a negative star I would give it!!!service is horrible!!!second time I have gone!never again!!!!!
Don and Regina S.,"Antioch, CA",3,73,85,4.0,7/7/2009,"We were in town to meet with some people for our up coming wedding. The vendor was running late so we went to BJ's to get a small bite to eat. We normally go to the BJ's in San Bruno at Tanforan. So I was surprised when we walked in and this BJ's had no wait time. We were sat near their TVs (had golf and baseball on). To be honest the food is average! However the server we had was EXCELLENT! His name was Alexander. He had no problem going back to the bar and getting me a new drink because I thought it tasted flat or even going back to the kitchen to get us ranch even though he just came from there. He was all smiles, very friendly and courteous throughout our stay. The next time we are in town we will be back because of Alexander and we will only sit at his table. Three stars for the food but one extra star for the EXCELLENT service."
Jeremy G.,"Palo Alto, CA",75,136,13,3.0,4/9/2010,"Interior 4, taste 4, health 3.5, service 3, price 3"
Amy B.,"Foster City, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/21/2009,"Every time I go back I get mad at myself..the service is ALWAYS with out a doubt the worst around. I'm talking an easy 10 minute to get a drink, then when the food arrives it's usually sparatic, like only half the table gets it, then 5 or so minutes later everyone else does! The crappy thing is, is that the foods great..but the service makes it awful!"
William R.,"San Mateo, CA",0,20,,4.0,10/5/2009,I love eating here. The family always asks to eat here the sandwiches and pizookie is AMAZING! 4 stars because orders get messed up sometimes. But the service is great. They offered us a free dinner because they messes up the order and accidentally gave us a bigger pizza.
W L.,"San Leandro, CA",4,45,5,3.0,8/8/2011,"Have come here four times for dinner after work, and all good experiences with food.  It's a very extensive menu (think Cheesecake Factory on a smaller scale). Now that chain restaurants are required to print calorie counts with menu items, however, it almost gives me a heart attack to read it.  You'd think a chicken club would be pretty innocent, not half your day's caloric allowance.  So, if you come here on a diet, you'll find something, but not a lot of choices.  You weren't coming here on a diet, were you? Always amazed at how quickly they can seat you when it looks like they're operating at over capacity.  It's always crazy busy here, but the service is good, efficient and friendly. Just this last time we waited 25 minutes for our appetizer, the ahi poke, long after another table had been seated after us, and was deep into their nachos.  The waitress finally brought us seared ahi instead, and that was only after we clarified that my husband was NOT asking for the ahi to be added into his dinner salad.  A more experienced served might have tried to clarify rather than try to run with this bizarre concept. Her manager came over later to apologize and gave us the ahi poke on the house. I like not getting attitude, and I like when management tries to get it right, even if this is a chain restaurant.  There are advantages to corporate food service, sometimes.  Prices are reasonable, and I can hear my husband when I talk to him even though it's a sports fans' paradise and big party atmosphere all the time.  You should go here!"
Destry H.,"Alameda, CA",188,207,998,3.0,8/25/2008,"My wife and I went exploring, and we found out that there was a BJ's in San Mateo. Being very excited that we had now had one in the Northern Cal/West Bay area we decided to venture over there one early evening and have dinner. Being that we have dined at the BJ's in Brea,Ca on multiple occasions, and have had extremely pleasant dining experiences, we expected the same here in Northern Cali! It was around 5-6PM .We were seated within 10-15 minutes, our waiter/server was attentive although it was Monday evening and I guess we hit it the right time because it started to get busy. The restaurant has a very open layout, but seating is very tight? Because it doesn't  look like  the""Restaurant and Brew house"" style.....it doesn't  have the same feel as the Brea location. However, the service was fast & attentive, the food was adequate in portions and in taste! It's not gonna make my ""Gotta go back"" to list, but I'll probably keep it on my ""let's check it out"" list for the future!"
Ophir K.,"San Francisco, CA",21,8,,3.0,9/22/2011,"Great beer, good service, food is medium-. Like TGI Friday, not in a good way."
Eduardo R.,"Redwood City, CA",11,13,,5.0,9/14/2009,"Good food, good home-brewed seasonal beer, great environment and good price."
