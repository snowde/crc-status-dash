Shauna S.,"San Francisco, CA",149,904,19,2.0,4/16/2009,"The food -- meh. However, it's entertaining to go with a group. Great service and a nice selection of beer -- so long as you're with a lighthearted crowd the mediocre food can be overlooked."
Retired B.,"Los Angeles, CA",570,1888,1488,3.0,10/2/2008,"Slightly better than your average chain restaurant. The service here is better than the PJs at Tanforan. It's also easier to get seated. Portions are big and there are enough ""healthy"" option dishes available.  I had to refrain myself from getting a pizookie this time since I finished an entire one by myself last time. Yes, gross, I know."
Joseph G.,"Fremont, CA",13,204,306,3.0,10/12/2008,"Good beer, Good Pizza, Whack Burgers, Horrible WAIT!!!!! The pizza is pretty good here.The crust is the best part,Nice and crunchy. Burgers though,ehh!!! Not so much! Allot of their beer are really nice,Cold and refreshing. Good place to go with your friends or family."
Scott T.,"San Bruno, CA",45,153,9,2.0,4/23/2009,BJ's itself is a fantastic place to eat at just this one just come up to par.  I understand when it's busy things come up and people sometime forget but when there's only 3-4 other tables being used there's no excuse for the service to be bad.  I felt that we were lucky to even get served drinks...which were the wrong ones.  The waitress said that she would be back to take our order then disapeared and when she came back she ended up helping a group that had arrived after us.  We ended up walking out of that place and going over to Mimi's Cafe.
Yun Z.,"Foster City, CA",11,25,32,3.0,8/17/2009,"I took the family to BJ's on Bridgepointe and had the dinner on Sunday (8/9) night. We got our table without much wait. The waitress was quick to serve but it took a little while for the food to arrive at the table. I ordered half a rack of baby ribs with a house salad and a baked potato with bacon bites, all for $17.55. The ribs were good, and so was the salad. But the dinning hall was cold as an a/c outlet wad right above me. The waitress seemed to be on a run, since she took away my plate which I was still working on. The total tab was $65, including the tips."
Morgan P.,"San Mateo, CA",99,169,25,2.0,4/15/2009,"Not very good, I wouldn't waste the time. Of course the food is like every other BJ's out there, pretty awesome; it's just the service really in San Mateo is terrible. It's painful. I live relatively close and love the beer but everytime the service sucks. I try to sit in the bar area because the good servers are usually in that area, but it really doesn't matter here. Last time I went even the bartender was rude, she was just...sour. Oh, man, and that ""big screen"" TV kinda thing at the bar? Really? They have a kinda grungy huge TV for watching the game(s). Drive the extra ten minutes and go to the BJ's in San Bruno. They do call ahead seating, so the drive won't be a big deal. You'll just be frusterated going here."
Frankie W.,"Eugene, OR",225,279,47,4.0,6/14/2008,"Never tried the food here, so I can't really say much about it.  My friends and I just came here to drink.  My friend's friend wanted to meet here to build up a lesbian community so we were just here to support her... Besides us, only two other people showed up (kinda sad haha), and they were old.. So that makes just the 5 of us. Geez, I have a high alcohol tolerance, but they were really trying to get me drunk! Luckily I didn't have to pay for any of the alcohol... We had 2 rounds of beer (apparently their brewed beer is famous all over) and my friend and I had tequila shots (THEY'RE HUGE..), plus I had a screwdriver (it was so strong.. I wanted to gag b/c of such a high alcohol content..), and we had vodka cranberries, and margaritas.  Yummy... My friend I came with got really drunk really fast and apparently she has a high alcohol tolerance too.. I guess she didn't have anything to eat though..  And she held my hand really hard under the table.. hahaha.. I was like, woah...  We went outside for a smoke and we were all guessing ages (if we didn't know how old we all were) and I told my friend and her friend that they looked early 20s, and then the old lesbo who tagged along got really excited and was like, how old do i look!?!? And note that I was starting to get a little drunk, so I was starting to tell more of the truth... so I was like, umm... 48? and she was like, really? that old? and I was like, ohh shit... I'm going to get my ass kicked now... and I went, Yeah.. you do. and my friends were like, oh shit.. we better run away... and the old looking woman was like, I'm 34! and I went, oh.. you don't look that young LOL...  Dangggg.. Anyway, good night after we sobered up.. 2nd time I came here was about a week after, when I was supposed to meet up with my friend to go to the beach.  But on the way, I got into a car accident on the highway (fucking retarded people..) So I came kinda late and I was sooo depressed b/c of my beautiful car turning into a glorious piece of shit, so when I arrived, my friend felt bad and brought me here again for more drinks.. Yeah.. Best way to heal a broken heart is by drinking... So  we ordered a bunch of cocktails and beer, and the girl who held my hand earlier drove over immediately when she heard I was here...  Anyway.. was sooo depressed.. ..What was I talking about? Uhm.... The restaurant is alright... The bathrooms look cool when you're drunk... I mean.. they're clean... The best part about coming here for a drink is that they don't card you (I forgot to bring my ID) and yet they still let me drink, so whatever.  4 stars"
Malalini S.,"San Mateo, CA",116,222,123,2.0,6/22/2008,"i had forgotten all about this place until we needed somewhere near home and open late for a late celebration of geezerdom(bday) of maybe the 8-10 times i've gone here, i've only really enjoyed 2 experiences and both were when my friends and I were seated close to the bar....  for some reason if you sit over yonder, you get the shittiest, air headed, forgot im the waiter your table jerkoff..... anyways, last tuesday was no exception only i got the worse waiter in the world....  he forgot a few of our plates, never bothered to check if we needed refills on drinks, and gave us dirty napkins that were supposed to hold and keep my utensils clean...grooooooosssss.... i dont even remember our waiters name but i do know he used to work at the bed, bath beyond in the same shopping center...i wonder if bbb fired him for being stoopid.   the only time i saw this jerkoff walking his area was when he was collecting the bill......i noticed this during our dinner and mentioned it to my sisters and bro in law...... sure enough... as much as he ignored us all night, once he brought out the bill, he lingered around and never went to to the back of house....what a bastard.... he was probably itching for his tip... too bad his ass get any. anyways...if it was based on this last nights excursion i would rate bjs as a one...but because my other visits were tolerable and two very memorable, i'll give it a two. oh... food is alright.... i mean its slightly better than mediocre, the atmosphere is coo... stick close to the bar for the best experiences.....  the farther away from the bar, the suckier the waiter.... otherwise, i like thats its big and noisy guests are okay....."
Brenda S.,"San Mateo, CA",33,39,3,3.0,5/5/2009,My kids love the PIZOOKIE and honestly it is good and it's the only place that you can order it PIZZA SIZE. I usually have the ceasar's salad with blackened salmon but yesterday I ordered the Pesto Cilantro pizza and it was all right.  I think the best thing about BJ's is their beer.
Monica N.,"San Mateo, CA",47,141,33,2.0,3/28/2008,"Lame! The service was so slooooooww, and it wasn't even busy during lunchtime. Unacceptable. I think my senses woke up and realized the mediocrity of their food in the process."
Marzan W.,"San Leandro, CA",261,163,5,4.0,2/27/2008,One of the best spots for pizza!  I love the crust.  The pizookie dessert is enormous.  The service is okay.  A bit slow but the food is awesome.
B B.,"San Mateo, CA",3,11,,3.0,11/24/2009,"This place is all right. The food is nothing special and is way over priced. The only reason i will go on occasion is because they have good avocado rolls. The service is hit or miss, one time i went in there with a party of 5. At first the service was just fine, but then he brought the food out and asked if we wanted anything else, my sister asked for ketchup and he rudely replied  "" yeah, anything else? I don't want to keep running back and forth"". I was speechless, what was he running back and forth to get us? Our drinks? Food? Because that is all he brought us before we asked for the ketchup. This place is usually busy so my advice is to call ahead."
Katie R.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,20,3,2.0,7/30/2009,"The food is fine, in fact they have a pretty good variety of choices on the menu and my husband really likes the beer sampler. Prices are reasonable. We typically go here when we're invited as part of a group, but never just my husband and I. I would give the food 3 stars but the service i've experienced here is so consistently lousy that I had to give it 2.  Three out of four times that I can recall going here, something was wrong with my order. The cider/beer blend is one of their featured drinks but twice I have had to explain it to our waiter after receiving just the berry cider when I ordered the blend. We have had our appetizers brought out before the main meal, incorrect ingredients on a dish, over an hour wait for our food. On the occasion that our appetizers were brought out before the main meal the manager took it upon himself to approach our table and compensate the group. Great, however when we received the bill, it was incorrect as well. We avoid BJ's whenever possible just because of the service."
Connie C.,"Belmont, CA",5000,1539,1424,3.0,3/27/2006,"Had it not been for Martin, one of the managers, and the General Manager who came to apologize for the slow and nonexistant service we received during this past Saturday night, I would have given this location 1 (zero if I could) star. After waiting nearly 20 mins for a server to take our order and another 20 mins without getting any drinks, we called over a manager. We, along with the couple sitting next to us who were also experiencing no service at all and also complained, ended up having our entire meal comped and personally brought over by the manager. We were encouraged to order anything we wanted throughout the evening. Throughout the rest of the night, a female server and the managers would check up on us, so by the end of our meal, we left happy."
Steven L.,"Palo Alto, CA",1,13,,2.0,7/21/2011,"I really don't see what the fuss is about.   In a (northern California) society where we prize fresh, local, and seasonal ingrediants, I find this restaurant full of heavy oily salty un-remarkable food.   Even the items that should be reasonably fresh are gross.   I ordered the avocado egg rolls, which had an excessively oily exterior, and some strange salty pasty stuff inside.  The avocados were recognizable.   For an entree, I orded the the tilapia off of the light menu, and received a nicely presented dish on some weird pretentious triangular plate.  The tilapia was dry, and was smothered in a very salty olive tapenade.   The rice pilaf was also salty, and had a rubbery texture.   I had to scrape off the tapenade to render this dish somewhat edible.   If BJ had used fresh fish, they wouldn't have to smother it in tapenade to conceal its true flavor.   I give this 2 stars."
San D.,"San Francisco, CA",28,257,12,4.0,1/22/2009,"We had a midweek lunch with some out-of-town family.  There were 7 of us, plus 1 child.  Even though they were busy with the business lunch crowd, we got a table within 10 minutes.  Our waitress was really great. She took our order quickly, and had a great attention to detail .  Someone ordered their meal sans dairy, but ordered the battered wedge fries.  Our waitress remembered the no dairy thing and changed the fries to regular ones when she found out that the batter had diary.  Extra star for her and the lunch menu sliders - inexpensive AND delicious (a lot too...I couldn't finish it all)."
Rick H.,"Oakland, CA",401,1285,1012,4.0,6/16/2006,"BJ's are something you get, not somewhere to go have a beer.  However, with that important comment behind us, it is encouraging to see a higher and better use of the space once occupied by the disappointing Cucina! Cucina!.  As yet another designer restaurant chain, this one deserves a bit of kudos for its novel presentation as a mini-brewpub.  Its got an industrial theme and is adorned with large wall murals depicting blue collar factory life obviously meant to resemble the WPA paintings of the 1930's.  A roomy establishment with an expansive menu and some surprisingly good comfort food."
Zack A.,"San Mateo, CA",0,14,,4.0,10/26/2011,Their pizza in my opinion is really one of the best of the few around.  Other than that it's pretty average but a place to drink if that's what you like.  Seating has been faster than they tell you it will be so that's another good thing I can say about them.
Osris Q.,"Redwood City, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/20/2009,"It was just the first day when I liked the food there and after that I am continuously getting disgusted with the restaurant.  Yesterday it crossed my limit when they made us to sit for 40 -50mins for a pizza and when it came it was cold and tasted like hell, worst than pizza prepared a day before.They have some very good staff and some are just the other extremes. destroyed my dinner yesterday.  So before going to restaurant I have to check if I am lucky enough to get good server, else probability of dinner getting screwed is 95%."
Kat M.,"Union City, CA",133,461,114,5.0,5/6/2008,"My husband loves this place, and always gets the beer sampler so he can try everything.  BJ's is great for me and the kids too since the food is excellent!!!  We usually order the Brewhouse Nachos and split a cheese with mushroom Deep Dish Pizza.  Yum-O!!!  Remember Uno's Pizzeria?  BJ's Deep Dish is definately much better than that! Perfect texture and crispness,never soggy.   The portions are large and we always leave with our pizza craving fully satisfied.  Best time to go is for early lunch (around 11:00 a.m.).  Not too crowded at that time."
