m. S.,"San Mateo, CA",1,77,,3.0,8/7/2011,"A sports pub, with a million TVs to catch the game or ignore whoever is sitting next to you. With the sports theme, good beer on tap so you can enjoy the win or even enjoy the loss. For the kids, and yes, this is a kids with team, adults with team, family with kids kind of place at dinner, there's lots of yummy lemonade. It's loud and the room like a cavern--I didn't look at the seating limitations, but I'm sure the fire department allows more than a hundred folks in there at a time.  It's a chain, which means carefully controlled menu--predictable but not inspired. (My brother from Texas went with us since it was near his hotel--yep, he says, it's the same thing).  Food comes in ridiculously large portions, so order stuff that goes home well. Or if you are with the team, order to share. And close your eyes when you look at the calorie count for the items. (To be fair, at least they have to post them). Be prepared, on weekends, to wait and wait unless you get there before 6. They hustle, but it's busy. The service is friendly but inept. We usually get drinks and salads within a reasonable amount of time...and then....nothing for a long, long time. No refresh the drinks, no how are you doing, nothing. Several times, waiters turn us over to other waiters who then forget about us. It's the oddest phenomena. Either they are severely understaffed or they are in the kitchen catching up on gossip while we are waiting. Just don't get it. We go there 'cause the son loves the pizza, it's near hubbie's work. But we won't make a special trip to go all the way out there..."
Rick S.,"San Mateo, CA",19,94,33,4.0,8/17/2007,"I love PIZOOKIE! last night we got the super pizookie platter and it was delicious. Up to four kinds of cookie with what looked like a whole carton of ice cream on top. My recommendation is the warm chocolate chip, the combination of gooey chocolate, warm cookie, and creamy vanilla ice cream is pure HEAVEN. My drinking buddies always get the beer sampler. Slider appetizers were a hit as well. Go in the evening and sit at the bar. After 10 is considered happy hour with drinks and appetizers half off! Probably the only late night hang out in San Mateo without having to hear the TGIDrunks."
Jeanne M.,"Marina, CA",4,84,,5.0,9/13/2006,"I love this place... the only occasional complaints I have are service/execution related (e.g., waiting too long for the check, not enough dressing, change of waiter shifts mid-meal). The food here is excellent, and a good value for the money. Ambience is good, and though you're usually in the room with a lot of people (at dinner), the noise level is reasonable. I love the pizza, veggie burgers, caesar salads, and Pizookie desserts. Yum! Try it out!"
Angela L.,"San Francisco, CA",62,242,113,2.0,2/29/2008,"what's with all the rave for pizookie?! if you never tried a cookie with ice cream in your life, then you might find it interesting, but then it comes in a tin pan in which the flavor of metal fuses in with the dessert.  Skip that and just bout everything else, just like how the chef skipped my turkey in my turkey cobb salad and the bacon in both my friends' turkey with bacon cobb sandwiches!?! they comped our dessert for their mistakes, but still not worth another try."
Huyness D.,"San Francisco, CA",28,24,27,3.0,1/25/2007,"the food is decent - it's typical american-italian pasta and crap.  the beer sampler is a good way to get really drunk off of small glasses. the best thing on the menu is the pazooki (sp).  it's a baked chocolate chip cookie served with ice cream.  it's so good yet bad for you, you'll have to run two miles and then spend 8 hours of community service just to write it off."
adrianna h.,"San Jose, CA",183,65,17,3.0,11/19/2008,"i thoroughly enjoyed eating at this resturaunt. the food was good, the atmosphere is fun... the waiters/waitresses could show a lot more urgency though....one of our waitresses forgot to even put in our order one time, and then another time, took my order only to tell me they ran out of that type of pizza so i was forced to order something completely different...which was strange to me because they are notorious for their pizzas, kind of like ""how does a burger joint run out of patties?""  strange...? gotta love the pazookies though!"
Sharon J.,"Dublin, CA",10,39,,5.0,4/3/2007,"The BEST pizza ever! the pizza is baked in an cast iron Chicago-style pizza pan. The dough is soft and airy. The great thing about this pizza over competitors, it's not greasy.  We sometimes go to BJ's in Portland, Oregon, which I think, is better. But, overall, It's all good. The place does get packed on the weekends. We normally go around 4pm, just before the dinner crowd. Pricing is reasonable. And when you've had enough pizza, try the steak, salads, and I almost forgot, The Beer! They have, I believe, 11 varieties, and you can sample them all (it's on the menu)."
Gavin T.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,75,2,1.0,6/17/2010,"When I walked in and sat down, it was really noisy. There were TVs in every corner, each playing different things. One football, one soccer, one baseball, and one just ads. I ordered butter pasta with grilled chicken, and waited for 30 full minutes for it to come. I was excited that it might taste good, (because munching on bread and licking salt isn't very tasty).  I tried a piece of pasta. It was bland. I asked for buttered pasta, but this tasted like blandered (not a real word) pasta. Then, I tried the chicken. EHH! It was bitter! (Yes, bitter) I really just spit it out, on the spot! The breadstick it came with was so burned that it was bitter and hard to bite. The broccoli tasted fine, kind of mushy with a hint of salt. So, anyhoo, this is my first 1-star Yelp review, so I really don't recommend this place to you."
Kerry M.,"San Mateo, CA",2,30,,4.0,5/29/2007,I think this place is pretty good.  Sometimes its really crowded which can be annoying but I would say that the times I have come here have not been disappointing.  The burgers are pretty good - and the beer too.  Good fries which is always a plus.  And the desserts taste good and are a good price.  Definitely a step up from a TGIFriday's or Red Robin's.  The servers have always been friendly too.  I haven't run into any disgruntled employee yet which is always a plus.
Joshua P.,"Burlingame, CA",2,20,2,4.0,7/18/2011,god to go to for a lunch or dinner to watch the giants play on a big screen and to socialize with the drunks. pizza is amazing though this one is great because there is usually a seat in the bar area unlike the BJ's in Tanforan
Matt D.,"Seattle, WA",4,21,2,5.0,6/30/2007,"One of my favorite places to go ever. The Red Robin nearby isn't even worth looking at when you realize the good food you get for the price at BJ's. I've tried quite a few items here: The pizza, pasta, various sandwiches, beer... all so very tasty! Certainly give the beer sampler a try, as well as the pizza! The seasoned fries are the best I've had. I take most people out to here as a first meeting. A must visit especially if you've never been to a BJ's! The service here is great, the one thing I have to complain about is they almost always take a long time to get you your check and get you out the door."
Douggles L.,"San Mateo, CA",4,41,,3.0,5/30/2008,"i got FRIGGIN WASTED at this joint. The menu is disgusting fried food, the beer sucks, and it's a chain joint with no personality. why three stars then? I GOT FRIGGIN WASTED HERE."
Angelina M.,"Allen, TX",176,258,43,1.0,8/27/2009,"ok so here goes my long review. family dinner tonight for my sons 2nd birthday. my brother called to put our name on the list and the hostess told him in a rude tone to get here as soon as possible. excuse me? alright whatever. we get seated and it takes forever for our server to come over, when he finally does he mumbles something about beer and appetizers. we all look at each other and order water. we order food and he slinks off. a few minutes later my salad comes out. we still dont have our drinks. he brings them and just sets them on the table in a group. whatever. he ignores us until our food comes at this point all our cups our empty and leah flags down a busser to get us more water. all the food comes out except leahs. about 5 minutes later he brings hers out. doesn't ask how anything is. doesn't see if we need anything else, just walks away. he brings us boxes and we stack our plates. my appetizer plate is still on the table by the way. after the table has been cleared he finally comes back and asks us about desert.(after already knowing is was my sons birthday.) he brings out the birthday desert and half way through singing happy birthday WALKS AWAY! the other pizookie comes out later and it tastes like ass. i wait tables for a living. i bust my ass everyday making sure people are happy have full drinks and their food is tasting good. there is a huge difference between being new and not knowing what you are doing to being lazy and a complete asshole. i never do this but ima put him on blast. BETO YOU SUCK! expect a phone call to your gm tomorrow morning."
Christina Y.,"San Francisco, CA",10,50,,3.0,3/12/2006,"Waited a good 2 hours for my boyfriends birthday dinner with about 12 people on a Friday night. Can't make reservations here so if you are expecting a group dinner on a weekend, make sure you send someone out EARLY to wait (buy them a drink for graciously sacrificing themselves to the long wait). The wait for the food isn't too long and our waitress was uber friendly and brought my boyfriend a pzookie [ a MUST ] with candles. The food wasn't too bad yet I wasn't feeling so hot after my piled high stuffed potato. Nice decor inside...at least we got to watch some sports on the nice screens while we waited. Also, since we waited so long, they gave my group a pizza appetizer. I believe you should be able to wait at least in Barnes and Noble with the gadget they give you as well."
Jen Z.,"Pleasanton, CA",152,220,,2.0,12/11/2006,"This place always has an enormous line and I just can't figure out why. The food is okay but definitely NOT worth the wait, nor the terrible service that everyone else is mentioning. I've been there twice and I wasn't impressed either time. I saw at least five servers/waiters walking around and talking while impatient tables were waiting for service. The stuffed potatoes are filling but I wonder if it was just because I was so hungry by the time I got my food that anything would've tasted good."
Shira R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2,13,,3.0,9/10/2006,"Worst Service around, but the food is good - so we keep going back, hoping for better service. The halibut fish tacos are sooooo good - so are the avocado egg rolls. But seriously, we've been here about 5 times, had to have our meal comp'd once because of crappy service (they pretty much forgot about us in a corner booth, then brought us the wrong food). But, it's the food that keeps us coming back. If you are prepared for the lack of service, then the meal can be quite enjoyable. One tip- Order everything (drinks, food,and dessert) as soon as the waiter gets to your table-because they're not coming back!"
Lina K.,"Belmont, CA",3,35,3,3.0,2/27/2007,"Besides the fact my co worker got food posioning from their fish tacos, I dont find that BJ's has that great of a selections, and my meatloaf was BBQ'Ed. YES!!! I know weird. It was flavorless. Some of the food is great the rest is BLAH!"
Lisa R.,"Daly City, CA",4,37,,1.0,10/21/2011,"We had a company lunch of 12 people.  We made a reservation the day before and called to confirm that morning.  When we got there they acknowledged the reservation but told us our table wasn't ready because other guests were taking to long.  We had to stand in the doorway for 25 minutes!  Then they sat us a several tables put together and there weren't enough seats and we had to seat two people on corners and squish together.  Then it took a little while to get our food and it arrived several minutes apart.  Then the best part - the waiter completely forgot to order our CEO's entree, and he had to wait until the rest of us were almost finished!  We actually spoke to the manager about it, and thought he'd give us a gift card or something, but all he said was that he wouldn't charge the automatic gratuity, so we could tip as low as we wanted.  Needless to say, we will not be back.  I've had slow service before too, trying way too hard to flag down servers to get more soup with the unlimited soup and salad lunch deal."
Huckleberry B.,"Universal City, CA",3,12,,3.0,3/8/2008,"Place was packed at 8pm on a Friday, so make sure you have a reservation if you want to sit down.  We ended up eating at the bar and having a few beers.  Had the avocado egg rolls (very rich and filling) and two hefeweizens.  Food was good but not great - what can you say about a chain.  Beer was decent but kind of generic.  My friend had the huge Italian chopped salad which seemed to regenerate itself over the course of the meal.  Lots of big screen TVs for the sports buffs out there.  Good place for drinks after work."
Hen A.,"San Mateo, CA",3007,3154,4803,3.0,5/3/2006,"pretty decent california pan style quality pizza.....good yuppie beer and pizza joint....little overpriced...but what isn't?....bartenders and staff are pretty friendly...it's a busy joint, but they always say, ""sorry""...long as they know..i'm fine with it......i bet the bartender a drink that i was older than her when she asked for my id....she took my bet...surprise surprise...i'm freaken 28....booyah~!....got myself a free beer...."
