Jonathan T.,"Foster City, CA",75,185,11,3.0,5/21/2008,"I think their beer is horrible, but the environment is nice and the food is average.  Typical bar food.  They can accomodate to big groups though which is nice.   I come here so often that after a while all the food starts tasting the same."
liz c.,"Burlingame, CA",142,331,17,2.0,6/26/2007,"not all BJs are created equal. this one definitely took my big, fat, red stamp of disapproval. i'm pretty sure everyone that walks in thinks they're really cool but really they're coming to join other people who think they're cool too. first time i went, the host was embarrassingly hard to understand on his own merit. it wasn't the people talking, the loud music. it was the fact that i really don't think he was enunciating his words. that was irritating. he gave our party of 6 a table that was clearly made for 4 people with 2 chairs on each end. after asking if we could change tables, they said they'd have to break up the party in to 2 separate tables. it wasn't a busy night so...how about 2 tables put together? nope. that was strange. and stupid. so we bailed. second time, i thought i'd have some mercy. i tried not to be judgmental when i walked in and so far everything was good. but after being seated, it was downhill. i don't know where this waiter was rushing to but he was definitely in always in a hurry, even when taking orders. when he rushed us to pay the check that was when we let him know that time is $$. third time, our waiter was just weird. i don't get where they find these guys.  peace out bjs!"
Gerald A.,"Pacifica, CA",41,19,,1.0,5/15/2006,"This place is an alcoholic's worst nightmare.  Their service is SUPER SSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOWWWWWWWW.   I understand it's supposedly a Brewhouse, but if feels like they go to make your beer only after you have ordered it.  Not to sound like a total lush, but how do they expect me to get shit-faced when my drinks come 30 minutes apart from each other.  The funny thing is I've been there a couple of times ever since it first opened up but their service STILL sucks!!!  It's not like they have a lack of employees either because there are times you see 7 waiters all huddled in a crowd just talking to each other while you're waiting.  I hate this place with a passion!!  AARRGH!!!"
Scott A.,"San Francisco, CA",364,371,9,2.0,7/25/2007,Decent environment with low noise level.  This makes it easier to talk among one another about how crappy the food is.  Another chain restaurant making cheap uninteresting food.
Julie B.,"San Jose, CA",7,58,,3.0,9/29/2007,"I've been here a couple times after they first opened and the service wasn't that great and the kitchen hadn't figured out how to make the pizzas quite right. It was very, very busy, so they must have been doing something well. I like the Cupertino location better, even though it is further away from my house."
Kristine P.,"Oakland, CA",0,35,,3.0,6/12/2008,"bj's is solid, has tasty fish tacos, and is all around not bad food for a place that serves the same purpose as a Chili's or TGIF.  It is what it is, and it's a little classier and more delicious than those other places"
Kit E.,"Mountain View, CA",69,663,6,3.0,3/11/2008,"Big portions for the price.  We tried their bbq chicken deep dish pizza, it was pretty good, just as good as Pizza Chicago.  I think I'd come here again!"
Melissa L.,"Portland, OR",111,564,50,4.0,10/23/2006,"The thing about BJ's, and in particular this one, is that you have to set your expectations properly. I mean, let's get real, this place is basically like an Applebee's with microbrew. And I say that with all due respect and love.  The pizzas, as many have mentioned, are really pretty damn good, if you like the doughy type of crust. The microbrews are not great, not terrible. Their IPA in particular (which is not, sadly, always on tap) is really pretty damn good for a chain.  The salads are decent, and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls are a better version of the Southwest Eggrolls at Chili's.  Also, I have NEVER had the poor service at BJ's that many others here mention. We must have been lucky every time we've come here. The second time we visited, we actually had a really on-the-ball waiter who even came out before out entrees were ready and brought us wet-naps for the ribs we'd ordered. Now that's thinking-ahead. They are just a bit too pokey in bringing out your next beers, but that's a minor quibble. If you're in a hurry to pound your beers, you should be sitting at the bar."
Rinne R.,"Union City, CA",128,385,192,4.0,5/20/2006,"Like the last few reviews, this BJ's definitely had slow service.  But I totally didn't mind.  Maybe it was the company or the fact that I was having soo much fun...I didn't really notice that the appetizers came 20 minutes later.  The food and beer were very good--the avocado roll appetizers, buffalo wings, BBQ chicken salad, and the Berry Burst were my fave!  And I finally tasted the Pizookie--chocolate chip chunk---and it was heavenly!!!  I'd come back again!!"
Matt W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",7,149,12,2.0,5/4/2008,"This place gets crowded really often and the ambiance is not always nice... If you get luck you can have maybe a correct service. i like the cider there more that the food, it's ok but nothing exceptionnal."
Brandon M.,"Houston, TX",288,403,37,4.0,5/2/2006,"Hangout place, sports bar, deep dish pizza, Jeremiah red beer. If you're into that, this is the place. Courtney the bartendress is the bomb, friendliest person on the planet."
Erick ..,"Foster City, CA",52,125,17,2.0,9/21/2006,"Not bad, though I don't care for their BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza.  More meat, less onion, please.  Oh, how I miss Pizzeria Uno.  And their restroom.  Hot water?  I understand management enforcing sanitation and all, but rinsing soaped up hands through hot water is rigoddamndiculous."
Eric C.,"Fremont, CA",248,310,304,3.0,11/10/2006,"The BJ's chain offers a sports bar with some class. Don't let the idea of a sport's bar turn you off, this chain has some ambiance and the overall setting is very comfortable. The food at BJ's is consistently good as well. I do wish the menu were a bit more extensive or had a few more options but you're sure to find something to your liking. Their salads are surprisingly good and worth a try as are their pizzas.  BJ's is a little pricey, it won't break the bank but lunch is an easy $12 or $15 per person. Look for the personal Calzone, that's probably the best menu deal going. A good place for a casual date, to drink with friends or to bring a large group."
Pooh C.,"San Mateo, CA",67,36,,2.0,4/12/2008,"So-so beers (especially considering its a brewhouse), good food, awful service."
Jay W.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,3,1.0,11/3/2012,"Worst service ever. Came in at 10pm for a later dinner after a Tuesday evening show in SF. NOBODY waiting in the lobby, 6 of us, asked the ToGo person to seat us after waiting 15 min to be seated. Original table selected was too small for 6 people, she moved us to an uncleaned table. The table was in the bar, which we were totally fine with, but it took another 15 min to get someone to clean it, had to flag someone down. The female server who cleaned our table was extremely rude, acted like we were bothering her. So we did not ask her where our server was. After waiting another 10 min, we decided to order drinks from the bartender directly. Server finally came. Almost 40 min to get our food. Most of the food was just ok, 2 of our plates came out cold and they were not salads. 2 out of our group had worked at BJ's in the past and realized these plates were sitting in the expo window way too long; reason for the lack of the presentation/yumminess you would expect from BJ's. Took another 20 min to get hot food replacements, 1 of the 2 plates compensated, NO manager face-time. No staff member cared at any point in our visit, to include the management. Hope they did not expect a tip and we are certainly never going back."
Shadi R.,"El Sobrante, CA",11,47,2,3.0,9/17/2007,I've been here a few times on the weekend and every time it has been busy so there's always a wait. So far i haven't got anything else expect a pizza and fries and both are really good. Maybe next time i go I'll try something else. But all in all the service is all right ( a little slow when you ask for something) and the food is good
Steven C.,"Fremont, CA",70,74,5,3.0,3/9/2010,"BJ's is probably one of the better chain restaurants out there.  I've had the fish and chips, BBQ chicken & ribs dinner, and their burger.  All were certainly well above average for a chain.  Fish was coated in a nice battered crust that was crisp and not greasy.  The chips were really skinny American fries while the dish is tasty overall it probably won't get the approval of my Brit friends as authentic pub food.  The chicken and ribs had a good balance of sweet, tang, and smoke and was tender and moist for both chicken and the ribs.  Their burgers tasted of real meat and were juicy on a nicely toasted roll.  The soups I've had there were not memorable...  Don't even remember what I had.  Try the Pizookie dessert if you have a chance.  A giant cookie baked in a smaller version of a pizza pan topped with a scoop of ice cream, certainly worth a try.  Also worth mentioning are some of the brews.  I especially like their porter, dark and creamy.  If alcohol is not your thing then try the house made sodas.  They also make ""deep dish"" pizza but it really is not the shortening laden gut bomb that you expect when you hear the term deep dish.  Think more of a lighter, better version of the Pizza Hut crust ""pan pizza"".  Had a couple of staff functions there and they handled our group of 60+ pretty well in a side room off from the main dining room.  Could have fit 100 or more in there I think."
Peter M.,"Daly City, CA",42,124,21,1.0,12/29/2009,"this place sucks. Don't go there.  I've taken the family here a few times after taking the kids to toys r us across the parking lot.  3 out of 4 times, the service was crap!  One time, our waiter was clearly hung over and couldn't remember anything we asked him to bring.  Had to remind him twice to bring our check.  Another time, after being seated, we waited about 20 minutes before a waitress from another section came over to tell us there was no waiter for our section because that person hadn't shown up for work yet.  At my request, she addressed this with the manager.  Pathetic.  If I was the manager, I would have stepped up and came over to take everyone's orders. Nope.  That idiot useless manager sent the waitress back over to tell me that someone will be over to take our orders shortly.  Ten more minutes pass, and finally, that same poor waitress came over again to take our drink orders.  During this whole time, the manager was just standing around.  Wack!"
rosanna m.,"CA, CA",26,72,1,3.0,1/30/2007,"Went here for lunch just to get some ribs and a drink. The place was empty on a Tuesday afternoon, but the waiter kept disappearing and forgetting our drinks. The ribs were cold when I got them , but the flavor was ok. The martini I ordered was off for some reason (it had the flavor of Rubbing alcohol) so I asked for a new one explaining my observation, which I was charged for, and the new one was just as bad so I didn't drink it. The check was dropped while I was still chewing on my ribs. It would've been nice to get coffee. So we pay the check and the ever disappearing waiter doesn't pick up our credit card and I hand it to the manager who seems extraordinarily annoyed with me for bringing it over to the register myself. He promptly says to me, ""oookayyy"" in a sardonic drawl. Boy did I high-tail it out of there. My husband said, ""never, again."" I agree."
Dank G.,"Redwood City, CA",0,110,,1.0,9/17/2008,"the only reason we go there is so the kids can have the sliders and happy faced french fries.  otherwise i would classify the food as Grade Triple E, but edible. pre made, previously frozen, mircowaved in single serving packages.  lettuce is the only thing that they serve fresh - the iceberg and blu cheese worth the one star. also their brews aren't all that."
