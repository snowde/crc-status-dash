Marc S.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,,1.0,3/20/2008,"Say it with me, now: deez-gust-teen. That's right. Disgusting with a capital ""D"". Had lunch here yesterday, and the experience was underwhelming, to say the least. Both the food and the service sucked: 1. The waiters did not come by to take our order for a long time. Too long, in fact. We had to waive them down to make sure that we could eat before the polar ice cap finishes melting. 2. I ordered a blackened chicken sandwich, and it was the greasiest, most disgusting thing I've eaten in a while. It was heated on a griddle, and the outside of the sandwich was slathered in oil and/or butter. It had an unnatural oily sheen to it. The wedge fries were almost orange instead of a nice lite yellow because they had sat in the deep fryer way too long. They were beyond cooked; they were completely saturated in oil and glistened in the light. Completely inedible. 3. When the food was delivered, they didn't bring us silverware. We had to ask for it. Maybe they expected us to just slam our faces into our plates. Sooeey! 4. Sandwiches with fries. Gee, do you think a good waiter would bring ketchup and mustard to the table with our order? No, of course not. That would make too much sense. Recap: bad service. Disgusting, greasy food. Never again."
Jaclyn P.,"Woodside, CA",4,130,142,3.0,1/26/2008,"The food is ok, I like the chicken ceaser sandwich, my husband likes the pizza. The margaritas aren't that great. The service is usually slow but the pizookie's are awesome. I suggest the chocolate chip pizookie. They put chocolate chip cookie dough in a small pizza pan, bake it and then top it with two dips of vanilla ice cream and bring it out to you. It's orgasmic and I highly recommend saving room for a pizookie during your visit."
Jno V.,"San Mateo, CA",1,4,,4.0,8/24/2010,"Great food, quick service. Nice restaurant but a really typical chain restaurant. We love their beers and avocado egg roles, but al of their food is good, you can't go wrong"
T H.,"San Mateo, CA",2,33,,2.0,10/21/2005,"Ok, so I wanted BJ's to work out. New face on the restaurant scene (for our area), interesting ambiance. Possibly interesting menu. Reasonably well established chain.  I've been responsible for 2 groups eating at their 2 new locations (Bridgepoint & Tanforan). A group of 7 and a group of 5.  The first visit, to Bridgepoint, was about a week after they opened. We waited a week intentionally to let them get the bugs worked out.  Ambiance is ok, interesting, and not usual. Considering that I'm bored to tears with San Mateo County's restaurant collection, I had some hope that this chain would be worth frequenting.  However, after the meal, not one person at the table had a ""wow, this is good"" response to any of the food on the table. (Yeah, we shared, trying a bite of several plates.)  And in fact, the most common response from our group, business people that eat out frequently, was ""nothing special"", ""too bland"", and my personal response, ""exploring new levels of mediocrity"".  French Dip has sauteed onions and melted cheese... ok, I'll try it. Bland. Au jus was cold by the way. (On the menu, it's called a Roast Beef Dip Sandwich I think.)  Onion strings. eh. Normal. But the 2 sauces served were tasteless and wasted. Too bad.  Chili Cheese Fries? Middle of the road.  The Pizooki dessert? Large. But nothing really special.  There's more, but I chalked it up to ""early in their location"" curve.  Was disappointed.  I really wanted it to work out. So, a few days later, I took a 6 person family group to Tanforan, and we decided to eat at that BJ's. I'll put that review under that location..."
Rob C.,"San Francisco, CA",6,10,3,1.0,11/28/2005,"After my first, somewhat positive experience with BJ's, I've been back twice and the place has lost my initial praise. The food quality is very low. The atmosphere is decent enough, but I won't be back."
Jason T.,"Hayward, CA",20,116,27,4.0,5/3/2007,the pizza is great.... i don't think you could go wrong eating pizza here. The crust is the best prat.
S L.,"San Francisco, CA",10,466,6,3.0,4/11/2008,Food was decent and beer on tap was not half-bad. Servers seemed content with providing just enough service to leave you be on a casual date.
s L.,"San Mateo, CA",1,22,,4.0,5/18/2008,Enjoy the food but its so cold there.  Bring a wrap!
Milena N.,"San Mateo, CA",3,25,,3.0,10/14/2006,"The food is not great, and the service is pretty much always bad, but the Pizookie is totally worth it all.  Seriously, I did it all for the Pizookie!"
John A.,"Foster City, CA",0,27,,1.0,2/23/2009,"Typical carb-heavy chain food. OK if there is nothing else open, but service stinks. Been three times and every single time the wait for my food was long and I had to wander the restaurant to get utensils since the poorly trained waitstaff always forget them. The staff seems generally  pretty slow and incompetent. They made mistakes with our orders on two of the three occasions and were extremely inattentive. If I want to get up from my chair and refill my own drinks I'll go to Taco Bell where I don't expect any actual service at all. I don't know if the service at this location is typical for the chain, but I no longer take coworkers to this place. Definitely recommend you go elsewhere."
Nassima K.,"San Mateo, CA",13,5,,3.0,2/4/2012,"pretty good for a chain. the chicken club is yummy, and so is the mushroom pizza."
paige t.,"San Mateo, CA",1,42,,3.0,3/28/2008,"Its pretty good but when my pal ordered the calizon it wasnt a calizon really. It looked like a big piece of toasted white bread with peppers, meat, etc stuffed inside. And if it was on its side it would look like an over packed taco. The pizza and Pazooki were good but other than  that it wasnt too tasty at all."
Charles C.,"New York, NY",562,386,,4.0,1/24/2007,"I really think BJ's is one of the better quality chain rests. one can go to.  Being spoiled from the great food SF has to offer, it becomes hard to have a desire to goto franchise places.  However, what can one do when he ends up moving to Suburbia and SF is just not as easily accessible.  The food here is decent across the board, but in my opinion if you go to this rest. u need to just order the pizza, its really the highlight.  The beers here are also the great part of this place.  Great house brews that really cant complain about.  One note worthy thing si that one in San Mateo really has a nice bar layout."
Richard N.,"San Francisco, CA",39,16,,3.0,6/16/2007,BJ's Restaurant offers up a good atmosphere with comfortable surroundings and good food. Their deep dish Pizza is particularly good however a little on the expensive side. theire chili cheese fries are very good as well as is their specialty dessert called Pizookie which is basically a large cookie served in an oven pan with ice cream. This particular BJ's I went to however has had rather awful service and slow turn around time from order to receipt of the food. This is based on a number of visits to the restaurant (totalling 4) with each time hoping that the time before was a fluke. As far as the food goes it is very good but if you can try to not go to the BJ's in San Mateo next to Tanforan Mall.
Chris B.,"San Jose, CA",2,25,,4.0,9/17/2007,"I went on a Sunday evening.  I guess that's a good time to go there.  We didn't have any wait for seating at all. The hostess seated us instantly, and the waiter was pretty attentive.  Maybe the service was a bit slow, but I didn't notice.  I was there to relax.  And there are a bunch of TVs around the place to keep me occupied while I wait around. Two beers and a decent amount of food leaves me pleased at the end.  I was too full to get one of those pizookies I've heard a lot about.  Apparently, they're pretty good. The food quality and selection is about what I expect out of a chain brewhouse.   The only problem was that after we got our food, I noticed we never got any silverware or napkins.  Rather than wait around to catch the waiter on his next pass through, I went up front to search for 2 sets of silverware.  I couldn't find any, but someone who worked there asked me what I needed.  I told him and he immediately took care of the situation, even though he had to do quite a bit of searching, too.  So that made up for it entirely."
Tinou B.,"San Francisco, CA",141,246,5,4.0,4/3/2009,"not bad for a chain.  the jambalaya was pretty good, had a good spicy kick.  extra star for the attractive waitresses at lunch."
John D.,"San Francisco, CA",95,70,,4.0,12/9/2007,"Went here with a party of 30.  We were seated quickly, and food was brought out fairly fast for such a large party.  Waiter was good at keeping the drinks full.  I had the BJ's deep dish pizza which was good, but not too much different in taste compared to Pizza Hut.  I prefer this place over other generic places such as TGIF and Applebees."
Rose W.,"San Mateo, CA",0,9,,3.0,1/1/2010,"BJ's is solid.  I don't go there much, but they're good for larger group outings or if we're starved while shopping at Target or Sport Authority nearby.  The food is typical bar fare, nothing to write home about.  It's really on par with an Applebee's."
Bay Area Y.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,107,3,2.0,7/30/2011,"my family eats here about once a wk (i know - i really should cook more) and my biggest complaint is the inconsistency of the quality of the food for example: last night (around 9:30pm) I placed a to go order: the steak dinner and it was cooked perfectly but in the past it's either been too rare of over cooked.  i also ordered the tilapia dish and requested that mashed be on the side. nope smothered all over the fish like it'd come from a SOUP KITCHEN + plus they failed to give the green salad that normally comes with the dish but incld'd the salad dressing!  lastly ordered the salmon dinner.  this has also come under and over cooked - GO FIGURE... last night it was charred. the incompetent manager, Chris demanded that i bring it back. it was late, my family was hungry and i was pissed. i told the mgr that i was not driving back to the restaurant that evening and wanted my money back for the salmon dinner.  he kept trying to push gift card on me.  rather than correcting the MISTAKE of theirs over the phone by offering to refund a portion of the cc i insisted i would return the dinner the next day when im back in the area.   not only do i plan on bringing this to the GM's attn. they have lost a consistent customer for certain..."
andreia f.,"San Mateo, CA",10,7,,4.0,10/6/2009,"We were invited to go to BJ' s and it was a great experience. It was our first time but I'm sure we will get there for too many times.I loved everything in there, friendly service, clean, food very tasty and reasonable prices formlunch and dinner. You need to go there and try their ceasar's salad , it's the best one I ever had."
