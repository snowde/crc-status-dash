Bella H.,"San Mateo, CA",1,12,1,4.0,9/16/2009,Love their lunch specials and their pizzookies are to die for!
Scott Y.,"Mountain View, CA",86,32,,3.0,6/1/2008,I have to say they have the BEST deep fried onions that I have ever tasted. Such a freaking good appetizer. Food takes a while and I like the Blonde drink. Great place to hang out after work.
Aly L.,"Chandler, AZ",510,749,8,4.0,11/30/2006,"oh bj's. thankfully you've made your way up to northern california so i can enjoy some more of your jeremiah red.  i went here because my coworkers were taking me out to a going away dinner. so sad. good thing they decided to pick a place i love to drink at. of course i ordered my favorite jeremiah red and once everyone saw, they followed suit. the waitress was on the ball enough to ask if we wanted a pitcher, so we said sure why not.  the brewhouse nachos were fanfreakingtastic. i think my boss was purely eating them for the chicken to which he was addicted to. i love it when nachos are smothered in sour cream and cheese until you can't see any signs of actual chips. mmmm. i had the bjs burger which was alright. they definitely cook your meat medium rare when you ask for it. i believe mine was still mooing just the way i like it.  all in all decent service, good food, and definitely good beer. bj's is a dependable brewhouse you can always go to if you want some tasty beer and food that wont kill you."
Jason C.,"San Francisco, CA",16,42,3,4.0,7/12/2007,"Not bad, been here twice during the lunch hour rush and both times i enjoyed my meal. Grilled chicken pasta and another time some sandwich.  Gonna have to try out the pizza next time, smells good.  Good service and they have sports on all around the restaurant, so that's a plus."
mary C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,18,1,4.0,7/28/2007,"I have been to this particular BJ's 3xs.  I have to agree with the other yelpers that good service is not garaunteed.  My first trip there I will admit that I was impressed that the server got my order right.  She had seemed in a hurry and I was ordering for two (and we couldn't make up our minds). The last meal I ate was recent.  I've discovered that their pizza and the pizzookies are the best!  The server was great.  Very attentive - she laughed with us and gave us as much time as we needed.  Halfway through the meal she introduced us to another server who would be covering her tables while she went on a break.  From that point on it seemed as though we had been forgotten.  Even a competition to see who could look the most bored at my table didn't get the server's attention.  The replacement finally came back and by then we had a list of requests - half of which she forgot.  She remembered the bill though! Their carry out service kinda sucks too.  I called ahead of time once and ordered the food (talking to some guy who couldn't seem to understand me).  When I got there, he had mixed up the order and so I waited while the new order was cooked and then while he figured out how to charge me.  In my mind, he must've been new so hopefully he's settled in by now."
Nathaniel S.,"San Francisco, CA",7,14,,4.0,7/31/2007,"Delicious food. I recommend the chilli cheese fries, which are made with well-seasoned potato wedges. I found the service to be above-average for a restaurant of this caliber. Oliver the waiter was a gem. If you like Red Robin, Bj's is just a notch above."
Maria M.,"Foster City, CA",0,9,,3.0,4/29/2009,"Went last night for a quick dinner with the family.  I ordered pot roast...it was gross!  More than half fat, with lukewarm mashed potatoes and sauce.  Yuck!  Anyway, my husband got the baby back ribs, which he liked but said they weren't hot.  The kids loved their meals and my oldest had the California Burger, which he raved about.  Good service, quick seating at 6:30 for 6 of us.  Decent, but don't get the pot roast!"
Sarah B.,"San Mateo, CA",0,13,,2.0,7/5/2006,"This place is always packed and I can't figure out why.  They're open late which is nice, but the food is only so-so and it is really loud with a sometimes obnoxious crowd.  I've tried to like it, I wanted to like it, but I've tried it 4 times and I'm done.  There are better places -- the Brewery in Burlingame is similar but has much better food and better ambiance.  Go there instead.  Or even Macaroni Grill..."
David S.,"Milpitas, CA",29,132,1,3.0,6/25/2008,This is an ok place to go. The food is ok and the beer is good. Nothing to write home about. I would say that if you think this is a sports bar you went to the wrong place. Just avoid this place on a Friday or Saturday night cause it will be jammed.
Rafael M.,"Burlingame, CA",1,12,,4.0,9/26/2006,"I love this place, not going to lie. I regular this spot and all I can say is that it's just a nice comfortable atmosphere. The staff is always nice no matter how hectic things maybe and the beer is good and at a good price. The beer sampler is one of the nicest I've seen and I'm addicted to the chicken wings. They are like crack and I need a fix every once in a while or I get the shakes. My favorite beer is the Red. Good food, good beers, nice plasma screens, what else could you ask for? Beautiful servers? They got them too."
ally o.,"San Francisco, CA",12,165,3,4.0,3/3/2006,"their beer samplers were okay. not spectacular but not bad either. i'm trying to gauge whether i prefer it to gordon biersch.. i haven't quite decided yet.  (although, i prefer being in SF near the ballpark/embarcadero rather than san mateo) i had a chicken sandwhich and it was pretty good. huge, actually.   their pizookie (pizza cookie) dessert was all right. gigantic!  with eight big scoops of ice cream!  for the most part, the food is tasty but nothing like 'oh yummy, this knocks off my socks' good. but i have yet to try more off their menu. good place for after work meetups, large groups (i had a table of 8 and the waiter was awesome), and for a chain restaraunt.. i dig it."
Vishal M.,"Foster City, CA",11,41,,1.0,4/22/2008,"SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE! This may be just that one waitress, but i doubt it, i've still had pretty crappy service here since this one incident. I ordered a veggie pizza and this waitress somehow heres combination and for religious reasons i cannot eat that. It was just an awful experience, the food isnt even that great and their beer sucks."
mark s.,"Burlingame, CA",5,112,1,2.0,9/4/2007,"Been there twice. They have large portions and very standard chain restaurant food and service. Since it's a large place, the food usually takes a while to prepare. It's more of a place for large groups where you are chatting away than waiting for the food."
