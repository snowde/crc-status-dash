Teresa W.,"Novato, CA",24,120,13,4.0,8/28/2017,Tried their Chicago pan pizza. The veggie is yummy. Hubby orders it on the way home from work. It is usually ready for him shortly after he arrives. Was really craving a pan pizzaz Was not disappointed. Their food is fresh and well prepared.
Rachel N.,"San Rafael, CA",45,275,24,1.0,12/28/2017,"Let me be clear: I've been to this location more than a handful of times, and while it's never been stellar, my last experience here was abysmal.  I don't need to go on in detail about it, but there were a lot of problems. We were seated first, but served last. The food was bland and cold. Our food came out before our drinks, and it took at least an hour for our food. They brought us the wrong drinks. We asked for things we never got and got things we didn't ask for, and when they brought us something ""on the house"", we noticed it on the bill. The server seemed so confused by how to use the in-house tech that I was shocked... just -taking- out order took five minutes. Our experience in total was two and a half hours. We didn't order appetizers or a dessert. That's simply unacceptable.  I know I'm going to go back. I like BJ's as a chain and they're convenient to where I live and work, but this kind of service is not going to fly with me again."
Martin W.,"San Rafael, CA",11,113,62,3.0,7/25/2017,"This is more a general review of BJs. This location in particular has always been a nice place to be, with friendly host and attentive waiters. We had not having any problems in San Rafaels BJs Location. But our last visit shows that there is a trend in BJs, her it what we figured: Since the last several years the food variety at BJs has changed dramatically. In our opinion to the worst. We started visiting BJs couple years ago. The menu was almost Upscale Restaurant style, with good food choices like Grilled PorkChops, with Mustard and Apple Sauce. And this wasn't your regular Mustard or Apple sauce it was a high quality home made style condiment. This has all gone, and today BJs is there where it maybe belongs all the time: offering and serving Bar Food.  If we wouldn't had experienced those great offers in the last years, we surely would not complain, cause you get what you can expect here. But we are just so disappointed cause we saw what BJs has been capable off. I don't know if they have a new Food Director, but we will continue to going down on our visit frequency.  I have to say the new addition on the starter side (roasted cauliflower with almonds) have been great and are the outstanding piece this visit."
Anita V.,"Novato, CA",4,85,135,3.0,6/26/2017,First when we were seated 4 other tables were also seated to the same server.  So Obviously she was very busy.  The severs have a little handheld computers so they don't make a lot of eye contact when they take the order.  She was friendly and did a good job considering the circumstances. We we're a party of 4.  The burger was perfect. One of the salads was so overdressed no one could eat it and The other salad was served not the way we ordered it so they comped it which was very nice.
Michelle B.,"Vallejo, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/7/2018,"I was really disappointed with this restaurant.  We were taken to a table and seated.  I put my arms on the table and it was dirty and sticky.  It felt like jelly.  I told out waitress and she said she would get someone to come and clean it.    It took 3 tries before someone cleaned the table and even then, I used the napkins that came with our drinks to clean it all off.  As I started looking at the menu the pages of the menu were also very dirty. When our food came we had no silverware.  When I mention this, the person that brought our food seemed irritated. Towards the end we asked for to go containers,  Those were brought and then it took forever to get the check.  Once I got the check, the waitress stayed and told me I will wait here until you are ready to pay.  When we were leaving I stopped to use the bathroom.  It was a terrible mess.  There are no toilet paper holders so they just leave the toilet paper on the floor.  The toilet paper holder is broken on both sides so you can see right through to the other stall.  I won't be going back."
Douglas F.,"Tiburon, CA",683,451,294,2.0,1/15/2017,"Unfortunately, what I'm experiencing right now has become a pattern. This is the 3rd time I've had the same poor experience. Poor Service from a bartender that appears to hate the world and lacks any/all social skills. This guy looks like and acts like the is no reason in the world to smile. Too bad, I really like this place and enjoy coming in on weekends to watch sports at the bar, but I'm sick of the service. I'm headed next door to Chilis or Applebees or what ever the place is, so I don't have to spend my money with such a poor service at the bar."
MImi M.,"San Bruno, CA",16,20,15,1.0,12/18/2017,Worst spot I have EVER been.  Worst management ever!!!  I absolutely hate his place.  Bad food.  Bad service.  Bad management.  Bad attitude of staff.  Gave me a two hour wait quote--SERIOUSLY???  We went to Applebee's instead and then my cell got text in 30 minutes to say they had table.  WTF?!?!?!?  Get your stuff together if you want customers.  We would rather eat BJ not Applebees but you tell us 2 hours?!???  We came back after we paid for our drinks and then they have lost our name!  GET A BETTER MANAGER!
Lori V.,"Sonoma, CA",0,5,5,2.0,12/27/2017,"Awarding one star each for delicious sirracha brussels sprouts and stuffed mushrooms. HOWEVER, bar service was horrendous. Not only impersonal, but slower than hell. Went at 1 pm on a Wed and only 3 people other than myself and my guest at the bar. The bar receipt read ""Paige S"", and while she gave a friendly hello and took our order pretty quickly (as she should with only 3 guests at the bar), she was far more concerned with gossiping with her two friends than serving paying customers. Had to ask someone else for silverware 5 minutes after our apps arrived, never asked how everything was, didn't offer another beverage, and barely even said goodbye! Yelled it from across the bar and said ""thanks"". Won't be returning to this location based on such poor service."
Don M.,"San Rafael, CA",1,6,,5.0,1/5/2018,"I've eaten at BJ's many times, although only for lunch most of the time. I especially like their Kale and Brussels Sprouts Salad with Blackened Chicken Breast. But, one of my favorites has become the $10 Loaded Burger available on Wednesdays with unlimited French Fries. Yummy! The staff is always very friendly and helpful. Sorry so many others have had poor service. This has never been my experience. Try it and see what you experience!"
Bill J.,"Petaluma, CA",0,58,1,1.0,12/17/2017,"Since this is brewpub I expected some decent beer. Oddly they didn't have any Pilsner other than Heineken. So we ordered it. The beer arrived completely flat with no head or carbonation whatsoever. Anybody serving beer should have immediately noticed it. We wanted to bring it to the attention of the waiter but he was nowhere to be found. It took quite a while to hunt him down. He finally brought a Stella to replace the Heineken. It was also flat. I ordered the Prime Rib medium rare. It arrived rare with an odd red color and appeared to have been brought up to a lukewarm temperature under a heat lamp. The horseradish was forgotten. Since a busboy brings the food, there is little chance to give the waiter feedback, or for him to check whether everything is satisfactory.  There is a lot of time between ordering and the drinks and the meal, and there is a definite lack of interaction that is sorely needed at this restaurant. To top it off, the pen left with the check did not work, and again the waitress who took over from the waiter was nowhere to be found."
Mikayla B.,"Lakewood, WA",158,14,1,1.0,1/2/2018,"Only reason I give them one star is because I can't give them 0 stars. As soon as we walked in we were ignored by multiple hostesses that seemed like they literally had no idea how to do their job. We waited 10 minutes before anybody even took our name down. It wasn't until what looked like the manager showed up that we got seated... after he asked multiple hostesses to seat us he finally got one to actually do it. We follow the awkward host to our table where we LITERALLY wait for 30 minutes before a waitress even acknowledges our existence. When we finally flagged down a waitress we found ourselves talking to someone that MUST have been under the influence. She was taking food to the wrong table and when she took our order she asked me multiple times what I wanted to drink as if she never asked me. We ordered our food too because we had so much time to decide, so we order a pizza and she goes ""ooooh... we're out of pizza. We're out of burgers too, a lot of stuff""... I had no idea what else I wanted so I asked for a minute to look at the menu and she just stood there awkwardly like she never heard us.. after she left we literally got up and left so fast.. literally the weirdest experience I've ever had at a restaurant"
Stacey D.,"Los Angeles, CA",349,273,416,3.0,11/12/2016,Meh! I didn't want to believe the bad service reviews but man.....come on! It took too long to order drinks and even longer to order a simple plate of wings. Our server didn't check on us and to avoid any further delays we just paid cash and left.
Ang L.,"Los Gatos, CA",199,284,392,1.0,9/4/2017,"We tried to come here for dinner the other night. But it didn't work out. The host at the desk told us it would be a 90 minute wait! I understand that he was busy with the phone, customers, and employees asking him questions. But the two girls next to him were standing around looking bored. I like the other BJ's that I've been to and was looking forward to having dinner here but telling customers that the wait is going to be 90 minutes is purposely telling customers to leave and not wait. If I were management, I would have a word with the staff about retention of customers and not turning business away. This makes me think twice next time when I want to go out to dinner and go to a type of establishment like BJ's."
Monica A.,"Union City, CA",6,2,3,1.0,11/21/2017,"What an awful experience. We came here for a nice company lunch and it was not what we expected. We thought we would be conserving time if we ordered online because we can also make our modifications online. But clearly that did not make our trip better. It doesn't matter if you order online, they don't start the food until you get there. While I understand this, all of our modifications weren't even taken into account. A couple coworkers got their orders wrong. There was a salad that was with no cheese that came with cheese. A chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato only that came with pickles and mustard only. Two burgers that were not cooked properly. The picture above shows a burger that should have been medium well but instead looked and was completely raw!!!! There was no point in ordering online when they literally messed up 60% of our orders. When we told the manager what was wrong, he was upset that we had ordered online! What's the point of having that option then!!! Needless to say, we will not be coming back."
Christina L.,"San Rafael, CA",21,133,502,3.0,10/1/2016,"August 15 2016 My mother and I were running around Marin doing errands and a little shopping when we decided to get something to eat at BJ's. We went in around 1045/11AM for an early lunch... I had a free appetizer coupon and we got calamari. How can you go wrong with calamari. The dipping sauce that came with the dish was pretty watery and overall weak... I don't know whether they decided to make their portions a bit smaller or if there isn't anymore calamari in the sea lol.  For entrees I had initially ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus dish. When I had a mouthful of the pasta... I was underwhelmed.  I'm not trying to be harsh here, I COMPLETELY understand this is a chain and not a 3-star michelin star restaurant, but I mean it had little to no seasoning and very very little sauce...  I think I had like 5 asparagus's and 6-7 shrimps for a FULL plate of pasta. After trying to take a third bite I had enough. I decided to order the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp. That dish is beyond good!!! I had never felt like LICKING my plate except when my mother cooks...  Definitely will be ordering THAT again. As for my mom, she ordered the California chicken club and she was pleased. The fries were nice and thin... Definitely better than any fries I've had in a while (except inn&out fries lol) Overall I had an GREAT lunch at BJ's! Made a mistake on my end for choosing the wrong plate first, but luckily my waiter was kind enough to take it off our bill. We were be stopping in from time to time for calm chowder, calamari (if they up the portion) and their fish entrees for sure !!!!! Jan 5, 2017 The portions have significantly gotten smaller. Ordered the Atlantic Salmon and like you can see, the rice and mashed potatoes were smaller in size. I had to tell the waitress if she could garnish the salmon with herbs and sauce (came with none). Rice was undercooked and a piece of the salmon was overdone. My boyfriend loved his dish and convinced me to tip the waitress well over 20%, so I did. Sure wish I had a bit more food on my plate. Already miss the 2016 portions lol. Jan 12, 2017 Tonight's visit to BJ's' absolutely worth mentioning. Sayra was our waitress for the evening. Once our food came out from the kitchen and onto our table, I noticed that I didn't have the Steak Cut Fries I had ordered. Instead of taking my dish to redo the fries, she told me to ""keep it"" and she'll put in an order for the fries I wanted.  Most of the time they'll (waitresses and waiters) take the dish and remake it. The customer (I) will end up waiting while the mistake they made is corrected. Ultimately ruining the experience of ""dining together."" It's happened to me a number of times and although I acknowledge slip ups... it sucks.   Sayra brought out the fries I wanted and all was good. She deserved well over the suggested 20% tip. It's people like this that keep you coming back. No attitude, excellent customer service and all smiles!!!!"
Kaley K.,"Chicago, IL",219,238,267,2.0,5/17/2017,"Run of the mill restaurant like Applebees or Chilis. The menu has EVERYTHING so I guess it has that going for it but a lot of it is food service or made outside of the restaurant.  The beers are okay and I'd recommend trying the Hefe, it was pretty good. On this visit we ordered a sampler platter but it was super boring and ALL made from frozen/food service. The main reason I gave this place 2 stars over 1 is the space itself and the tvs. If you have a large group then this would be a good spot to head to, otherwise, go somewhere else."
Jay R.,"Whittier, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Worst service ever!  Our first server came took our drink order and 20 minutes later a different waiter came with our drinks and didn't even introduce himself. I had to ask if he would also be taking our food order and he said yes. He left and returned 15 mins later to get our food order. Throughout the entire he kept tending to the other tables first, not sure if it was because we were Hispanic and they were White. The waiter kept forgetting to bring us refills on our drinks. We didn't have a pleasant night."
Loren W.,"San Rafael, CA",0,15,3,1.0,12/17/2017,"This is the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a long long time. It started when we were seated the hostess said we don't have any silverware ask your server. Server came 7-8 mins later asked for our drink order and left after the appetizer came ,brought by another guy. I realized no napkins so I ask the hostess that walked by for some she said we don't have any up here it's in the back ask your server. As my hand is now covered in sauce. But wait there's more.  Food comes food is wrong. Call the waiter tell him he runs away then the manager comes over ask  want us to try again YEAH IM starving why did the manager need to ask this .youd think that we would be a priority now well the water glass runs dry Pepsi has no more in it I have to goto the bar and refill my own drinks. So after 15 mins more and not so much as a I'm sorry it's coming out soon from the manager. I tell my girl we our out of here. I do customer service for a living and it's not if you make a mistake that counts it's how you rebound from a mistake that counts and keeps customers. Never will we eat at this place. Management it's the key to good employees and they didn't pick a good one"
Lynnette F.,"Novato, CA",29,331,1051,1.0,7/5/2016,"I ordered broccoli and cheese soup in a sourdough bowl.  They served me clam chowder,  which I'm allergic to.  I took two bites and my face and mouth started itching.  It was not easy to find help.  I'm officially done with BJ's."
William W.,"San Rafael, CA",134,69,105,4.0,6/25/2016,I feel like this could be considered a staple in Terra Linda if you're looking for a casual restaurant with a full bar and specialty beer. It's menu is extensive ranging from deep dish pizza all the way to low calorie items as well. So if you're looking for a restaurant and not exactly sure what you're in the mood for this place is a great stop because there will be something that entices you.  Personal favorite; I'm a big fan of the brisket burger. If you do enjoy burgers I recommend this one first (not for the novice eaters). Plus all burgers come with your choice of sides and I usually lean towards the seasoned wedges.  Also if you are a beer drinker this place has its own brew house with so many good tasting beers. They also offer the sampler of four beers if you can't decide. And to top it off the main reason I go there is for the famous Pizookie! This dessert is one of the tastiest treats I have ever gotten to taste and it comes in multiple flavors. All in all this place has a little of everything and I have had good service there as well. I'm a regular so I hope that counts for something!
Lacey A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",31,134,19,1.0,12/20/2016,"I've been here before once or twice with not the greatest experience but this last time was unacceptable.  We came in about an hour before closing, no one at the front to seat us. So we waited, and waited, and saw servers walk by avoiding us and said nothing. Finally a busser came over and said we can go to the bar.  The table was dirty but our nice server cleaned it. Went to the bathroom to find no toilet paper in nearly any of the stalls, the bathroom covered in paper towels and out of soap in 2 of 3 dispensers.  Thankfully, our server Jessica was amazing. She was prompt, polite and attentive. Food came fast and was good. Love the thin fries.  So 5 stars for Jessica  (name on the receipt) 1 star for the establishment. I hope this place gets the attention it needs and Jessica gets the praise for offering spectacular service."
T. B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/12/2017,"Lemon Thyme Chicken was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Sirloin was also quite good, asparagus could've been better. Sweet potatoes fries were awesome! Service was good not great."
Alice X.,"Seattle, WA",557,604,2333,5.0,6/1/2016,Great place to watch the Warriors game!  The place is pretty big and there are plenty of flat screens to watch sports games.  I've only been seated in the bar area and the bartender/servers there were all very attentive and friendly! Their cream soda is on tap. It's sweet but good.
Terri R.,"Sonoma, CA",1,18,5,5.0,9/29/2017,Had a wonderful lunch with my mom and Brooklyn our server was great. Food came fast & drinks were delicious. Love coming here.
Gimena G.,"Larkspur, CA",4,41,,4.0,6/22/2017,"I know a lot of people hate this place, but we love it!!! Service is always fast, food always the way I ordered, kid friendly (my kids actually eat here!!!!!) North beach magi and shrimp is my favorite!!! Ohhh and the stuffed mushrooms!!!!"
Anny N.,"San Rafael, CA",1,41,2,1.0,10/9/2017,"This place deserves no stars.. the workers here are rude or they hate their damn job.. or both. ive stopped eating here awhile back for the same reason but tonight for some reason i decided to order take out. I mean hey, that avoids the shitty service, ill just come get my food & go. STILL BAD. Not only that, they messed up my order pretty bad. I ordered the chipotle salmon with rice instead of couscous and fries instead of asparagus. I got the order and I didnt realize it was wrong in all types of way until I got home.. my fault I shouldve looked at the food while i was still there. The food came as is and my substitution werent honored however i did get a side of fries. The funny part is, the ticket on the to-go shows all the right modifications no asparagus sub fries & no couscous sub rice. So, i guess the chefs must hate it there too.. i truly hate this place"
Eldon T.,"Novato, CA",200,34,4,5.0,10/22/2017,I want to commend BJ's and Susan for helping the fire victims in the North bay. Oct 24th BJ's is donating a portion of its sales to help those who suffered loss during the recent fires. Server Susan helped out by providing food for those in needs. I plan on joining them on Tuesday and I will help to raise funds for the Jewish Family and Children Services Santa Rosa office.
Sophia L.,"San Rafael, CA",198,38,16,4.0,7/7/2017,Fun restaurant with your average all-American menu and bar. I was pleasantly surprised by the menu options when I went to eat yesterday for the first time in a year. It looks like they've expanded a lot of sections including the salads. I was really satisfied with my kale and Brussels sprouts salad with balsamic vinaigrette and lots of veggies. I shared a churro pazookie (a bunch of mini churros topped with vanilla ice cream) with the table for dessert which was a great treat. The one flaw in my dinner was the server's iPads which seemed to keep glitching and frustrating the servers. Ours was super sweet about the whole thing but it took about 7 minutes to place what should have been a quick order and I felt horrible for her.
Thomas E.,"Novato, CA",15,35,12,2.0,10/29/2016,"BJ's is always a challenge. Our server today too 15 minutes to show up to our table after passing us twice. Bj's had a flyer at the front desk offering a free PIZOIKIE when paying by there app (picture attached). When my wife went to order, our server argued that this was only for new accounts. I had to actually get the flyer and ask our server to show it to his manager. Then he agreed that this was the current promotion.  I don't know if the server was uninformed or the manager was trying to get out of honoring the promotion. Maybe both. My wife tried to pay using the app. And it was very difficult, and finally we paid via credit card."
Lindsay B.,"San Rafael, CA",757,133,2364,3.0,4/6/2016,"Lunch here was decent, the food was OK- nothing special, I had the chicken lettuce cups and the fried artichokes with lemon Aoli. Probably too much considering it was my birthday and we got a pazookie.  The pazookies are BOMB! The service was fine, we sat at a booth in the bar area. Not much more to say... if I come back in the future I will maybe have more to say."
Mamali B.,"San Rafael, CA",112,31,1,1.0,3/24/2017,"Me, my fiancé and two guests from London were visiting you store in San Rafael. We sometimes go to your restaurant and the staffs are usually friendly and helpful, but things were totally different last night. First your manager, Travis, came to our table after 45 minutes and he said sorry the kitchen made a wrong deep dish and the right one it's on its way. I totally understand that these things happen in restaurants since I work in restaurants during my college time. After 15 minutes pizza came in and it was the wrong order. Also nobody even bothered to clean up our table. I was really frustrated at that time and asked for the manager. It took him another 15min to come to our table. After explaining the situation he offered me to not charged the pizza. Seems like he did not get my point because couple of pizza is certainly not effect me economically. He grabbed few dishes and left the rest on the table. We waited another 15min and no one brought us any clean dishes. I went to the hostess to pay my bill."
Lexi A.,"Grants Pass, OR",0,4,,1.0,12/9/2017,I've never even eaten here. I just waited 20 minutes to be seated while every group that came in after me was seated before me. The host yelled at a woman in a wheelchair to hurry so he could seat her. They weren't even busy. Worst service ever.
Rose J.,"San Ramon, CA",0,7,,2.0,12/9/2017,"First off I want to say our Waiter was awesome!  After making an appointment 1 month before, upon getting to the restaurant we were told that they were not ready for us and that we would have to wait.  It took them 50 minutes to get ready and then seat us.  (Really? we had a reservation! You new we were coming)  Upon ordering appetizers and our meals. Our meals came out before the appetizers.  Food was missing from 4 of the people sitting with us.  It took the kitchen another 30-40 minutes to get them their meals.  The Manager never came over to apologize for the problem, however our waiter was on top of it all and very apologetic."
Danita-J'ordan D.,"San Leandro, CA",142,21,9,1.0,9/1/2017,"I walked in with my dad and sister and approached the area where you put your name on the list to be seated. There were 3 employees in this area, none of which acknowledged my family and I standing there and instead turned the other way to help another customer who came in AFTER me. I don't want to pull the race card, but it is worth mentioning that we were the only black customers waiting and even after walking out was never greeted. Very disappointing and I'll be happy to tell my 30% tipping elsewhere."
Nyomi B.,"San Anselmo, CA",45,15,3,5.0,6/20/2017,Love going up to sit at the large bar with so Many TV's on the latest of sporting events. Good service and the food menu is huge. They have their own brew  or a full bar  menus. There is always something new to try and the bartenders keep up With the customer flow and keep it coming!
Nichole G.,"Novato, CA",70,9,,1.0,10/10/2017,"The service keeps getting worse. Today we complained to the manager. His response, I know her attitude is rough, I'm sorry. He then proceeded to allow this woman to talk to customers however she wanted. The place was not busy and we were patient. I will not be back until something changes."
Oak S.,"San Quentin, CA",7,16,1,4.0,4/7/2017,"Prime rib special was fantastic. Med rare, super tender. Portobello, Swiss burger with sautéed mushrooms med rare, very tasty.  Service was terrible."
Chase B.,"Indianapolis, IN",6,2,1,1.0,9/17/2017,Great service food was great!! Spent hundreds on dinner plus drinks.... dinner great from kitchen the sever was amazing but the front of house manger was a dick. And the bartender was a bitch. The server came around and was asking for last call and my boss and a few other ppl ordered drinks at 10:50 and then the server came back and said sorry we are closed. The manager should be fired.
Michele M.,"Petaluma, CA",1,18,,1.0,9/17/2017,"Nothing like going to a restaurant and they tell you a 20 minute wait and they have empty tables everywhere. Sat at a table at the bar, had to ask for the table to be cleaned and when the waitress did she took just two plates, then a long wait till we left because no one wanted to take order. When we left some of the staff was outside the restaurant talking to thief friends. The staff was no where to be seen on the floor. Customers do not matter."
Hailey S.,"San Rafael, CA",70,1,,5.0,9/24/2017,"Bj's has never ceased to fulfill me but this time was extra special, our waiter Gabe went above and beyond for my dietary needs and the happiness of our dining experience. I really apriciated all the menu knowledge and friendly conversation he gave to our table. I know that we will come back to this wonderful establishment for the excellent food and for Gabes wonderful service!"
