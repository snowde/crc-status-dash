Sara F.,"El Cerrito, CA",251,328,235,2.0,8/1/2013,"Sorry BJ's ... but this last visit was the cherry on top.. I will not be back unless it is for after work meetings at the bar... The bar, I must say, is always good, personal service and great bartenders.. The sit down at a table experience.. not so good..It is really too bad cause this would be a great spot for regular work lunches. 1+ hour for the birthday girl's birthday lunch to arrive (in a to go container cause we had to GO) at the table.. mistake after mistake ended up costing us our workmate's birthday lunch hour, happy b-day song.. and then some!  The waitress apologized again and again, and so did the only manager on duty, who was a sous chef.. no front of the house manager? No wonder.. get it together peeps! Lunch hour can be a very lucrative time of day for a restaurant..not a good time for trying to cut your labor costs. This is generally why I avoid chain restaurants all together..  They tend to be impersonal and devoid of any creativity; usually manned by management who should care less about the bottom line and more about building local customer relations."
Monica F.,"Rohnert Park, CA",43,3,4,1.0,6/20/2011,"So first off, I've always heard great things about BJ's, the food, the atmosphere, the service, just everything was great! So I figured I might as well see for myself!  We walked in the door and the hostess was so rude, no exaggeration. No hello, no smile, just said ""it's gonna be 10 minutes,"" so instantly that threw me off completely, but I assumed she was having a bad day and shrugged it off.  We finally get seated and our server is so bland and dry. Obviously, you could tell she didn't want to be there, so how am I supposed to feel welcome. We made a few drink orders, I got iced tea. Waited for 10 minutes without getting a drink. Finally got them, I asked for sugar. We got the sugar probably 10 minutes after we asked for it.  We made our meal selections. The server didn't even bother writing our orders down, which we assumed would be a disaster. My mom specified asked for Cajun shrimp in her salad. And she didn't get that.  My sister and I shared the Great White deep dish pizza. It was delicious! Though we got it way before the salad. Finally my mom's salad came out with salmon on top of it. After telling the food runner that it was made wrong, the runner got defensive saying that we were wrong and that salmon was written down, when the server never bothered to. So she took the salad back. We finished our pizza, still no salad. Our server hasn't come by to see how anything is. Finally, the ""new"" salad comes out. There was still  pieces of salmon with cold pieces of Cajun shrimp on top.  We were beyond frustrated, as well as other customers. We saw 2 tables around us get so fed up and walked out of the restaurant. So we complained to management. You'd figure that it would make things better, but in fact, it was the worst eating experience I've ever encountered. He was incredibly rude. He was crouched and hunched over, mumbling and wouldn't even let us speak. And when he would, he would cut us off. After complaining about my mom's meal, he cut her off by saying, ""well if that's the problem, the least I can do is pay for the salad."" Yes, that was the LEAST he could do. Just the overall tone of his voice and stature made my skin crawl. I don't understand how he even got promoted to that position.  At this point we wanted to leave. The server finally came by to apologize and asked us if we wanted anything else. We requested our check and that was all. 5 minutes go by and she's standing at the computer chatting with other servers and the manager. She finally comes back and everything was on the check, including the salad. We were so annoyed, frustrated, we just wanted out. My mom then followed the server to the desk to demand a change in the bill. Then the manager starts to act like a total asshole and tell her that it wasn't worth her waiting, that he would just take care of it. Though my mom gave the server her debit card, and was still with the bill. After the manager told her it was on him, he immediately snapped at her asking if she ""heard him?"" Then leading to her telling him that the server still had her card. As my mom walked away they all started laughing, which is completely ridiculous! The food was good, but the service was absolutely appalling! I will never come back to BJs ever."
Jeffrey S.,"San Leandro, CA",329,444,250,3.0,9/21/2011,"I came here with my extended family for lunch as Sunday (9 of us total).  Even though it was the weekend, we were seated fairly quickly.  Part of the desire to eat here was to watch football, and there are TV's everywhere.  We had to swivel around to catch all the action! The food is OK; nothing to brag about.  You go to one BJ's, you've been to them all.  Great drink selection (for both alcohol drinkers and otherwise), food is acceptable, and great desserts. Since we had my brother 3 kids with us, instead of getting individual desserts, we shared the Pazookie Party platter.  You get to choose 4 different type of Pazookies, which they bake in one large platter, and pile on several scoops of ice cream.  The cold ice cream on top of the warm cookies make for a great dessert. My recommendation:  grab a beer (or 2), nosh on some appetizers, and save room for dessert.  You can thank me later!"
Ryan M.,"Sacramento, CA",35,3,,5.0,6/30/2015,Was really good! They messed up our order and made up for it. Very professional and I will come back! Thank you *mwah*
Tamami T.,"Novato, CA",12,65,9,4.0,6/23/2012,"We eat here once in a while -- usually a weekend lunch. My favorite is shrimp tacos. Light, refreshing and satisfying. Today's server was very attentive and sweet. Love it that the menu lists the caloric information, including kids menu. Brew is excellent also."
Forest J.,"San Rafael, CA",367,4,,5.0,8/16/2015,I cam here as I always do because it my favorite local go to.. I'm writing this to give kudos to the Manager (good looking Asian gentelman) who for the second time on a busy night went above and beyond when we had an issue with service on a very busy night.. BJs is lucky to have him and as usual I left very happy .. keep up the good work
Yohan S.,"Novato, CA",1,20,,5.0,8/13/2014,"I decided to walk into BJs with a friend on a whim. The place is very large and has a nice ambiance and a bunch of large screen TVs. We were sat down almost quickly, and the place looked fairly busy around 6 PM on a Saturday. The waiter came almost immediately and got us started. The waiter we had was exceptional. Not only did he contantly check up on us and kept our drinks topped off, he also had an amazing personality and was very friendly. I could also tell he was doing a great job with the tables around us and our section just seemed to be a bit livelier because of it. I normally don't pick from the appetizer menu, but I decided to try the ahi they had. The dish was amazing, as well as the main course. Plenty of food and so delicious! Near the end of our meal, our waiter had to leave so we were swapped with another. After being introduced she never came to our table to check up on us other than to bring the check. Because they stated that the original waiter would get the tips, the new waitress came off a bit cold. However, given the situation, I can't really hold this against her, but looking at the other reviews we may have been lucky to have gotten the waiter we did."
Emma E.,"San Rafael, CA",35,8,,5.0,7/9/2015,"One of my absolute favorite places, great food great services! always makes me leave with a smile."
Sekushii A.,"Fairfield, CA",92,29,2,2.0,6/18/2013,"So everytime ive gone to this location!  They mess up my order. Every single time, from my drink order to my food order. First time at this location: I ordered a DR PEPPER, and got cola instead. Im not a fan of cola. So i told the waitress that my dr pepper wasnt dr pepper, she said sorry and went to get me dr pepper. The new glass of soda she gave me still wasnt dr pepper it was diet cola. NooooOOo!  Then my order of food came out wrong. :( just my experiences"
Laurie R.,"Bainbridge Island, WA",19,6,2,1.0,10/11/2014,"Told it was a 15 minute wait for a table. After 20 minutes, host said we were misinformed..  We would be next table in 10 minutes. 40 minutes wait- no table. Never coming back. Dishonesty is a baaaad policy."
David H.,"San Francisco, CA",922,17,,5.0,5/13/2013,"A friend and I drove up from the city to see Wanda Sykes perform in Marin on Saturday night.  We decided to stop and grab dinner/drinks at BJs.  Unfortunately, in typical 'us' fashion, we didn't look at the time until after we'd been seated and ordered.  It was 7:55pm and the show started at 8pm!  We went into a panic.  How did it get so late so quickly?!   We flagged down our waitress and apologized.  We told her that we were running later and would need to leave.  She said the food was almost ready.  We had no time, so we asked her to just pack it up as a to-go/carry out order and we'd pick it up after the show. This was 100% totally our fault, so we paid for the meal, and tipped her. We made it to the show, and really enjoyed ourselves.  Afterwards, we made our way back to BJs to pick up our food, which we knew would be absolutely cold by now.  We were starving by this point so we didn't care. When we arrived, we went over to the carry out counter and had planned to just ask them to reheat it for us.  But after hearing our story, Chris (the manager) said 'Oh! We can't let you have this food - we'll remake it for you... please have a seat in the bar.' The food was remade, fresh - with no charge.  The service was excellent.  I am usually disappointed by chain places, but these folks really went out of the way to make the meal enjoyable for us.  Thank you, BJ's for making the night so great - we def need to get out of the city more --the Northbay has a down-home vibe that I can really appreciate."
Phoebe Z.,"San Rafael, CA",1,5,1,1.0,7/9/2014,"Horrible service. I'm usually not too hard on restaurants about the service but this may be the restaurant with the poorest service in which I have eaten. The food is mediocre but for the college graduate or the teenager with $20 to have a meal, i guess you could eat here. IF you can put up with the service for which i cannot.  May I begin with the fact that for a group of 3, it took 10 minutes to receive the waiters attention to receive water- and 25 minutes after receiving our beverages to order food. We asked another server if we could take our order, only to be replied with a roll of the eyes and grunt, as if we were not welcome in the establishment. The food was delivered 30 minutes later by a silent server with a rotten attitude. The food, once again, was mediocre but good enough. So before you take a seat, I recommend making sure this is your only option, as there are much better choices nearby."
Jacob H.,"Napa, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/20/2016,"The service from the waitstaff was ok.  However, the food was bad.  First, I ordered the chicken bacon sarracha mac and cheese.  It had no bacon in it.  I told the waitress, and she took it back to show the cook.  The new dish came out and it had bacon, but the rest of the dish was totally different.  Different color, sauce was watery, it had fetichinni noodles mixed in with the macaroni, and there was no sarracha sauce.  My dates potatoes were flavorless and cold.  We won't be coming back anytime soon."
John W.,"Eureka, MO",5,5,,1.0,9/2/2014,"Food was just ok..beer took forever. Fyi, Guinness should not be served in a chilled glass."
Wendy B.,"Holladay, UT",11,13,3,1.0,11/29/2014,"Do yourself a favor and just go to Applebee's. If the service isn't bad enough for you, the food will be:("
Jill M.,"Novato, CA",0,25,5,5.0,3/12/2016,Fun place for the whole family!  Something on the menu to please everybody.  Contemporary decor and high ceilings.  Lively atmosphere with music and lots of televisions playing sports.  Perfect meet up before a movie or after shopping in the mall.
Sara B.,"San Francisco, CA",55,14,,1.0,11/17/2014,"Terrible service, nobody greeted us at our table, had to get up for menus, to find server to order,  for silverware. Just really poor service fom everyone there. No attentiveness"
Cyd K.,"Peoria, IL",157,111,97,4.0,10/15/2014,"I don't get the bad reviews.  It's a chain restaurant.  If you're looking for some gastropub, go there.  If you're looking for gourmet food, go somewhere else. This place has consistent chain-food fare  every.single.time.  Sure the service varies, but you get your food and drink in a respectable amount of time.  It's called a chain restaurant, peeps.  Google it.  Now normally, I'd give this only three stars because I'm not a big fan of chains.  But I love that chicken wrap appetizer they have.  And it's the same EVERY.SINGLE.TIME."
Julia F.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,66,93,4.0,12/27/2011,"Just like the ""4-stars"" caption says, ""Yay! I'm a fan."" That doesn't mean I love everything they serve, it just means that in general, I usually have an enjoyable experience here. I'm pretty surprised that BJ's has such a low rating!  I like most of their food, except for a few items such as the deep-dish pizzas, mini tacos, fried artichokes, stuffed mushrooms... but everything else I've had I really liked.  If you want a burger but still want to be healthy, I highly recommend the grilled turkey burger, it's delicious! Whole wheat bun. I also really like their sandwiches (especially southwestern chicken), their pastas, and their flatbreads. The low-cal menu is delicious too, I particularly like the tilapia. And of course the pizookie!!!! I LOVE that monstrosity.  Service is good, large televisions everywhere, full bar. A good place to go with a group of friends! And conveniently located in an indoor mall."
Kirk H.,"San Rafael, CA",15,39,7,2.0,7/12/2013,"When they first opened, BJ's was a comfortable local chain-style place. Burgers were the best. We would think of BJ's when we wanted a nice dinner. But the accountant's and consultants have nibbled away at all of the reasons why we liked the place. They have replaced the tables and chairs with booths. Good for them - maximizes seating space. Bad for us. They're awkward and just plain uncomfortable. The menu changes are more subtle. The salad dressings went from thick home-made to watery out of a bottle - in ever-smaller portions. The burgers have gone from a loose ground sirloin to a pre-made frozen patty consistency. Tasty menu items like sweet potato fries have disappeared. The menu is crowded with items that are suspiciously similar to most of the other chains - one wonders if they are sharing suppliers or just consultants. Good for them, I'm sure these moves save a lot of money.  The service? No complaints really. The staff know their jobs and it seems as if the kitchen is well managed. Food is fast and orders are accurate. Hmmm. Where else have I seen that? That place with Yellow arches I think... So when I get the $42 check for two entrees - nothing else - I have to ask - was this worth it? Not even close. Chains seem to have a life span and it looks like BJ's is circling the drain. Too bad... Meh."
