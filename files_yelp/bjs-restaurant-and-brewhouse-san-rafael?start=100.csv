Jon A.,"San Rafael, CA",49,3,,1.0,12/27/2016,The service is terrible. I wait so long for my food. I set a timer and it is at 25 minutes after ordering. The food is great but fix on how much time it takes. Rating 1/2 but unfortunately i have to do a 1
Elyse S.,"Rohnert Park, CA",69,7,5,1.0,1/5/2017,I go here on my lunch and I have to say is for how they're relatively busy but not slammed they can never seem to get me out of there less than 45 minutes for a bowl of soup. There's no point ordering endless soup or salad because it will take them 30 minutes for one bowl. The food is the same as all other bjs.
Gerlie P.,"Vallejo, CA",147,60,43,3.0,11/6/2016,"Crave for pazookies, pizzas, and booze? Well Bj's is your upgrade go-to-spot from Applebee's! And, if you like 'Tokyo Teas"" definitely order one from here. Oh, and their watermelon margarita on the rocks is a quench thirster. And, you can't go wrong with ordering their calamari. Also, if you're a person that likes to watch sports while grabbing a drink or deer well then this is definitely a place for you!"
J L.,"Novato, CA",71,5,,1.0,5/28/2017,Overpriced subpar food and brew. Lazy service for lunch when it wasnt too busy. Second time ive gone there and ended up with a bought of diarrhea.
Wilma M.,"San Francisco, CA",114,10,2,3.0,5/6/2016,"They have more beer options to drink, than vegan options to eat. I used to come here before I went vegan, and their food was, OK. Their service was pretty stale, and would leave me with a bad taste afterwords when it came to their server's. However, I still come back. Now it's just for their bar. The bar staff is really nice and they have a fun atmosphere to watch the warrior playoff games. I'll keep enjoying their bar staff and brews. Their hosts are nice too, they always greet promptly when I swing by."
Karsen R.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/25/2016,"Nicholas the bartender is quite the multitasker. Regardless of the curmudgeon who threw a tantrum over a salad, we were more than satisfied with our service on Black Friday. BJ's is lucky to have him during the holiday season. Tip him well."
Carol F.,"Yountville, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/14/2017,"We needed a nice convenient place for lunch before Kaiser appointments n were delightfully surprised!! Staff was wonderful! Helpful, really sweet n sooo considerate!  Root beer chicken tasted delicious after not much food for days, chicken n pasta perfect, and a raw tuna salad surprisingly delicious!  They are getting a bum rap!!!"
Charlie H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,17,,2.0,5/25/2017,"Service here is very poor!  Food is not too bad. I'd probably eat here more often if they could manage the basic service essentials: refill my drink, check on me occasionally, and deliver the check in a timely fashion."
Allie C.,"San Rafael, CA",1,29,15,2.0,2/27/2015,"My little sister and I waited 15 minutes for our buzzer to go off in the waiting area. Then ended up standing around for another 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us. One of the gals behind the computer realize we've been standing there for quite awhile, and decides to seat us herself. (Which I appreciated) But once seated we wait another 10 minutes just to have our waitress speak to us.   My family, has been club card members of BJs for over a year now, and lately we have left consistently disappointed with the service, although the food is satisfying"
Frank J.,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",0,22,,5.0,6/2/2017,"People giving this bj's a bad review don't really understand the point of bj's especially here in Terra Linda. There is basically no other bars in the area, no other good places to watch sports games. I think they changed management I feel it is way better now a days. Enjoy bj's ! Cheers"
Christian J.,"Rohnert Park, CA",32,10,13,1.0,8/8/2016,"We've been here before, and usually enjoy it, however today we sat for 20min before getting a drink order in and another 20min before recieving that order and another hour before seeing our food. Only reason I bothered waiting so long is my daughters bday request was to eat here. Horrible service."
Mark D.,"San Rafael, CA",523,790,3778,4.0,11/16/2014,"This is a review of a solo dinner at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in San Rafael.  It is located outside of the Northgate Mall. The staff was friendly, professional and attentive.  This was true throughout my entire dining experience. The ambiance is warm and comfortable.  There are lots of TV's but, thankfully, the audio was turned down.  There is quite a bit of seating.  There is also a bar area.   The high ceilings give the space an open feel.  There are lots of wooden accents that help in providing a familiar and pleasant environment. The meal flowed at a nice pace. I was neither left waiting or overly rushed. I enjoyed all of my food. BJ's Fritos Nachos (Piranha Pale Ale Chili, crispy Fritos Corn Chips and Cheez Whiz Cheese Dip topped with shredded cheddar cheese, jalapenos, Applewood smoked bacon, sour cream, diced tomatoes and green onions.) - These were quite good.  The fresh ingredients were crisp and added a bit of lightness.  There were lots of Jalapenos but they were rather mild.  I would not have minded some slightly hotter peppers.  The cheese was fully melted.  I do think these would be even better if the chili was a tad more complex in flavour. It was a bit flat.  But overall, I really liked them.    Brewhouse Double Deluxe (Two 5 oz., fresh 100% USDA Angus beef patties, Applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions, crispy onion strings, cheddar and swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and BJ's signature burger sauce.) This was a pretty darn good burger.  The only real weakness was it had a pretty decent case of the soggy bottom bun blues.  But, it managed to hold together long enough for me to eat it.  The burger was cooked just right to the medium rare I requested.  The onion strings were a great crispy addition.  The bacon was tasty and perfectly cooked.  There was lots of nicely melted cheese.  The vegetables were fresh. This is a big burger with all of the fixin's. I also liked the fries.  They were crisp and there was just the right amount of salt.  Receipt (big dinner for one):  $20.61   Overall - Great service and a comfortable space combined with a tasty app and a very good burger to make for a very enjoyable dining experience.  For me, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in San Rafael was a winner."
Kelly T.,"Novato, CA",0,7,,3.0,4/19/2017,Went to pickup my take out order and had to wait over ten minutes for anyone to be there to check out my order. When they did arrive no sorry for the wait or anything.
Aletia S.,"Rodeo, CA",0,9,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Terrible service, we waited over 29 minutes to have our order taken. Meanwhile the waitress was nowhere to be seen. I finally had to ask the manager to have someone take our order. Then we waited about 30 minutes for our order to arrive. The food that arrived was hardly cooked -think raw pasta in chunks of uncooked veggies-. During our waiting time we noticed that the room divider was thick with dust so thick that it had to be a week old. The booth was sticky. The bathroom was messy and had wads oh TP stuck to the wall.  We will never go back!"
Bill H.,"Novato, CA",201,37,487,2.0,1/19/2015,"Nice for ball games with multiple big screens and enormouse beer selection on tap. Happy hour appetizers always a good call, but regular menu is too enormous with lack of execution to detail. Been here a dozen times and have never received a oustanding experience with quality of thebregular menus food prep, usually long wait, and not delivered very hot. I keep trying but the big screens, beer and apps are really all that keeps me coming back."
Jason Z.,"Petaluma, CA",156,305,184,5.0,1/12/2015,Really great service from Josh.Had a great meal there. Even when something went wrong...the salad was not 100% and they took it back no problem and got a replacement meal really fast. The manager even came over to apologize.  They have a ton of TV's for watching sports which I loved.
Vangie B.,"Redwood City, CA",2,20,8,1.0,12/13/2016,"I've been at a few location of BJ's, this by far is one of the worst services  I've experienced, staff are not friendly at all. Our main course came first, as supposed to salad & soup. No apologies from the waiter. They all have long faces, especially the waiter who brings out the food from the kitchen, I gather he doesn't like his job. I will not come back here ever again... service is pretty bad..."
Sylvia L.,"Novato, CA",89,172,66,2.0,11/5/2015,"I have been here a lot of times. BJ's has been around for most of my life. I'm from LA so I've been to many different ones over the years. Never had a bad pizza at any BJ's. This one just happens to be close to where I live now. I have been here a lot of times. I'm always fantasizing about the pizza when I arrive but then I start looking at the menu and something on page 23 catches my attention.... bad idea. I've ordered a lot of different stuff here and basically I regret not getting the pizza every time. I love their pepperoni pizza. It was a bit greasy the last time I had it but hey, you don't eat pizza because it's healthy. We eat it because it tastes good. That's why I gave them 2 stars. That and the Pizookie. Of course. I was with a party of 3 and we order the pizookie sampler. It was just perfect. The portions were much more reasonable for 3. They were 3 smaller ones and you could pick the flavor for each one.         The service is not great. Last time we were there the server had to go ask her manager questions for us that she didn't have the answer to. Simple stuff like for example the yelp check in deal. It's a discount off your bill and she was utterly confused when we showed it to her. I see this often in different places though.  A lot of times the employees have never heard of the deal or even yelp for that matter and they didn't know about it because someone (who should have) didn't educate them on it. That's fine but she literally had to go back and ask for us like 3 or 4 times about different things that she should've known more about. When we presented her with our check in deal, she had to go ask her mgr about it. She came back with a form for their frequent buyer program. We asked her if we needed to sign up for it to get the check in deal and she had to check with her mgr. She came back again and said no then on our bill there was an option to get a $5 coupon if you donate at least $1 to some charity. We signed up for the program and donated $2, Then we asked her how we get our $5 coupon and she had no idea what $5 coupon we were talking about. She had to go ask the mgr.  It's not her fault that she was just not properly informed about certain things. In the end we finally made it out of there after like 15 min of trying to pay the bill and leave. So, if you're in a hurry, don't get involved with any of that stuff, just pay and go while you can."
Antonia M.,"Novato, CA",10,284,67,1.0,8/8/2015,"The atmosphere is nice and the place looks pretty organized.  Don't let that fool you.  We were seated by the hostess and given menus, but nobody came by and talked to us for 6 minutes.  Water was then brought to us, but we had to ask for place settings.  We ordered buffalo hot wings and had to send them back because we asked for extra crispy and they gave us extra slimy.  By the time the wings came, we were done with our meal .  Sloppy service; not coming back."
Sandy M.,"Novato, CA",18,59,27,4.0,11/14/2015,"We liked our dinner, it was busy so had to wait for a bit. Waiter was attentive and kind. He checked on us often. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Pretty good, friend says her ribs were good too. A little noisy, but the beer list was huge. I would go again, the pumpkin hot cookie with ice cream was awesome. Might just be worth another star just for that. Yum."
