Jim N.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",0,7,5,1.0,6/23/2016,"My wife and I went to BJ's on a date.  They sat us down pretty quick there wasn't much of wait.  We have been to BJ's many times to have dinner, watch games, have dinner, have dessert always had a good experience. However today was not busy and we sat for about 20 minutes and no one came to ask if we're ready or offer water. After  We waiting for 30min we decided it was time to leave. I told the host what had happened and she didn't seem to care at all. Didn't apologized or offered to sit us anywhere different it seemed like they just didn't care. Which is fine but we will now tell our family and friends about our experienced."
L2 A.,"Elizabethtown, PA",0,44,39,2.0,7/11/2015,"Mixed feelings - inconsistant experiences. Awesome Santa Fe salad & mediocre pizza (at best.) The meat on our pizza was very good, however the crust was nothing special & there was no sauce. When I requested a side of sauce for dipping, I received ice cold marinara. VERY disappointing. Personally, I cannot recommend & would not return."
Monica K.,"Martinez, CA",42,205,268,2.0,9/7/2015,"The only thing good about this place is the amount of tv's they have in their restaurant, so it's good for watching sports games. Their food has been somewhat consistent,  but their service is always slow, whether they are really busy, or slow. What's even worse is when you have their app, and make reservations,  and the restaurant says it's still going to be a 30 minute wait, when you arrive, after the app says 10 minutes.  So when I asked them what the point of making reservations on the app was, their hostesses looked at me like I was crazy for asking. The only reason why I do come here is for their enlightened dishes, and the tv's."
Doug S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,19,,2.0,9/12/2015,"So I am a big fan of BJ's so when I saw the low rating I figured it was a fluke.  Oh how wrong I was.  The order took a bit longer than expected.  Two of the four meals we ordered were completely wrong and had to be sent back. Then, when we got the check I noticed we were charged twice for the meals that had to be sent back.  And if that wasn't enough, when I paid the check I was told, ""Thank you for coming."" As if the server did not intend on bringing back any change.  That would have been a 25% tip.  After we waited another 10 minutes we finally got the change.  Overall the food was decent. NOTE: After posting this review it appears that someone from the restaurant wanted to try to make up for the bad experience which was very nice.  Unfortunately for me I was only passing through the area to visit family and I have know plans on being in the area again.  The offer by the management is a nice touch and shows that they care."
Christopher E.,"Sandy, Salt Lake City, UT",3,309,63,5.0,1/14/2016,"Not sure why the low reviews by others but I have eaten here a dozen times and have always found the service prompt, the food excellent and the ambiance inviting. My server, Sam, was excellent and all the food perfect."
Axel R.,"Aurora, OH",1,17,8,4.0,7/18/2016,"Came late in a day after visiting SF. Good service, but the prize goes to the kids menu, really good portion of tasty food (ok, maybe not that healthy). Tried their Piranha Ale, was quite good. And finally, use the app and pay from the phone with Apple pay. I liked that!"
Rhi S.,"Seattle, WA",410,255,672,3.0,7/1/2014,"First of all, the photo used on this profile is of their location in the Westfield Southcenter Mall in Tukwila, Washington. The Northgate location doesn't look like that and it's kind of hard to find if you're inside the mall because the map is a little off. When I lived by their Tukwila location it was my favorite place! I was so surprised to find a BJ's when I was passing through the NorthGate mall in San Rafael so I really wanted to eat there. My husband and I went around 3pm on Sunday. It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. Our table had water on it and I sat on a small piece of what I think was a french fry (my fault for not looking but if it's slow, you have time to wipe down your booth).  It took what felt like 10 minutes to just get the waiter to come and introduce himself and then another minute to get water. For such a slow afternoon, for anytime actually, I expect slightly faster service. Even when it's packed at any other restaurant it only takes a few minutes before someone comes to your tables ""Hi, I'm XX, I'll be taking care of you this evening.."" Our appetizers took about another 10 minutes and then our food came.. But I noticed that the people who sat next to us, who came before us, didn't get their food yet. It was a couple and two small children. They got their food when we were half way done with ours. If I were them I'd be really annoyed. We shared calamari and corn fritters which were super delicious. My husband had the parmesan chicken with just mashed potatoes and I had the parmesan chicken sandwich with tick fries. The sandwich was alright.. His food was way better and the mashed potatoes were kinda cheesy. It was so good! This place has dim lighting and a sporty feel with the televisions around. The food was good but that's about it.. I would not return to this location. I'd rather wait and eat at their Seattle restaurant because at least I know it's clean and the service is much better."
Kharey R.,"Pinole, CA",42,40,5,2.0,7/9/2015,I remember why I don't come here. Cheap food that came out in 3 min. That I think was microwaved..............:. But wait ! She asked if my food was good I said no and she brought me a cheese burger to replace it lets hope it's better than the microwaved chicken
Veda F.,"Novato, CA",242,565,789,2.0,3/29/2015,"Nice salad, slow service.  The food is surprisingly good.  The wait staff ok, very young and inexperienced.  The service is poor and the waiters a bit snooty late at night.    The response from the waitress, when I said, I guess you didn't hear me say salt with my margarita, her reply was, "" yes I did, it happens"".  The salads came before the drinks.  Lol it wasn't busy!  Just"
Kevin L.,"San Francisco, CA",522,773,203,4.0,10/12/2015,"Nice atmosphere, definitely good to watch a sports game.  Food is what I expected from a large chain restaurant.  Impressed they didn't cooked the shit out of the sriracha dry rub wings, most American restaurants especially and surprisingly, wing places overcook them so much like they afraid of chicken.  I cook my chicken to 135 at home, yeah pink and little red at joints, nothing wrong with that, the meat is fully cooked and juicy.  I think most American menus offer chicken breast where you will not have a chance to see pink from bone joints, so with wings they need to cook the shit out of them.  But BJ's good job on wings."
Peggy B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/18/2016,"What a joke. I work in the mall and order from here all the time. And every single time I'm stuck asking myself ""why did I do this?!"" Today I ordered my food via mobile app, to be ready at 11 am. I walk in at 11:05 and no one even acknowledges me. At 11:10 someone finally asks if I need help. I told them I was there to pick up an order to be ready at 11. They went in the back, came back out and said it would be another 5 minutes. I said forget it. Enough is enough. Something is always wrong with my food, or it's never ready. Beyond ridiculous. And thanks for wasting my 15 minute break. So, to panera I go! I will NEVER eat here again. Period."
O K.,"Novato, CA",410,11,,2.0,6/16/2016,"Really nice service... If you don't mind getting food poisoning. I got so incredibly sick after eating here, and it turns out that I have friends who have as well. 2 stars is because my server was super nice and she took my salad (seared ahi salad) off the bill because I could barely eat it, too much dressing and it was making me sick- I thought maybe the dressing had gluten (I have an allergy), but then I was throwing up all night and I've been stuck in bed all day, incredibly sick, definitely not a gluten problem, I got food poisoning. I'm sure it's a great place to only drink (I don't drink- just water- no doubt it was the food that made me sick)"
Foodie M.,"Novato, CA",0,11,1,2.0,2/22/2015,"As my friends and myself have always enjoyed this spot...great ""comfort food""...the service is typically good...however, last night's service SUCKED. It was so apparent that our waiter had NEVER waited before...and he should go find other work. It was so bad, that when I gave him my CC...it came back without it being used...nothing to sign...we were tempted to walk, but didn't (and never would). I am sure we'll be back and if this same guy shows up, we WILL ask for a new one, who knows what they are doing.  It""s the only reason for the 2 stars...The food here is actually quite good, as in all their locations."
Thomas B.,"San Rafael, CA",111,449,1351,4.0,7/22/2014,I had the black and blue burger. It was ok. Fries tasted really good for some reason. Great flavor. Berry Cider was awesome. My waiter Dustin was perfect. Answered all my questions and even made me a spice ranch dip for my fries. Wtg. I saw all wait staff and bartenders being very attentive to customers.
Michael S.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,31,4,3.0,10/6/2015,"Could have been higher rating. Their gluten-free menu is printed in very small light ink. Hard to read without a magnifying glass and a spot light. Wanted to complain to management but would not meet with us. Have been in this establishment before and commented about this problem @ a month ago & was told that it would be addressed, but has not. They have an app, but no where to comment about service or problems for the individual locations. As others have said service is on the slow side."
W W.,"San Francisco, CA",1,41,,1.0,2/1/2016,"DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL!!!  I go a couple times a month for lunch with coworkers and we always get the discounted beers and lunch specials. Up until 6 months ago or so this was never a problem for the waiters/waitresses to ring up, but 4 out of the last 5 times we've been there they've charged us the wrong prices. Sometimes it's the beers that are charged at dinner prices and other times it's the food. Once or twice I could have written off as a mistake. Now we believe this to be a directive from management to incorrectly charge guests.  Note, I'm not talking about $3 or $4.... our bill went down $45 yesterday once it was corrected!"
Brenda D.,"Weston, MO",80,626,5,4.0,7/18/2015,"The local Nit Wit was just what I needed after a long day of travel.  Middle of the afternoon, this place was rather empty but the bartender was great and the Golden Beet and Arugula Salad made my afternoon."
Matt D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",56,75,58,4.0,6/1/2015,"I was surprised to see this location only had 2.5 stars. I'm a long time fan of the BJ's chain, but first time to the San Rafael location. We sat outside on the patio for a later dinner prior to a movie. Service was excellent, quick, and attentive. Which is good.. Sometimes at places you get forgotten when out on the patio.  I had the Fuzzy Nit Wit. While I enjoy most of their beers, this was just okay. Must have been the tequila mixed in. We got the Calamari appetizer. Delicious seasoning and great garlic aoili. Some calamari was a bit chewy but that didn't harm the overall plate. For dinner I had the cherry glazed salmon with asparagus. It was PHENOMENAL. Some of the best salmon I've had. Cooked just right and the cherry glaze tasted amazing along with the veggies. Wife got a deep dish pizza and brussel sprout salad and enjoyed both tremendously. I would give five stars but for the calamari just being okay and not amazing."
Debbie M.,"San Rafael, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/28/2016,"Went there last night.  I agree the calamari portion has lessened.  We have always ordered the ahi tuna salad yet this time many of the ingredients listed on the menu were missing, such as less avocado, less carrots, even tomatoes!!  Tuna was so-so.  Our waitress (Ra, who by the way is outstanding) stated that the restaurant was out of shredded carrots......really!!!  Prior visit they were out of potato skins on a weekday. Really!!!  Seems to me the food is going downhill, maybe a money saving issue or lack of experience by the manager, a restaurant like them should really never run out of popular foods.  I hate to add this but the woman's bathroom was filthy.  Don't need to explain, just please clean them ALL DAY LONG!!!!"
Amihan M.,"Napa, CA",204,393,715,3.0,11/20/2013,"Take your kids here when they're having a tantrum.  Go ahead, let them scream their heads off while you enjoy that alcoholic beverage.  Don't worry, it's loud enough that it won't disturb my dinner. You're welcome."
