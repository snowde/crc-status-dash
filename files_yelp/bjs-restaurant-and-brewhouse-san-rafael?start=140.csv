Scott S.,"San Rafael, CA",43,250,367,2.0,4/17/2015,"BJ's desperately wants to be the Cheesecake Factory but it just doesn't hit the mark. Now I'm not holding up the Cheesecake Factory as some pantheon to fine dining but I think it's only fair to judge an eatery by a reasonable competitior and in this area that would be the Cheesecake Factory (CF). They are both very large, casual dining places with an extensive made-to-please-everyone menu. They both have similar menu items, burgers, pizzas, salads, etc. with beer at BJ's and cheesecake at CF the primary differentiators. The food at BJ's doesn't have the same level of freshness and eye-appeal as CF. I'm really pulling for them to up their game as we live in Terra Linda and it is much more convenient. We've eaten here a least 6 times over the years since they opened and I haven't seen any change. Over 300 reviews and only 2.5 starts says it all."
Grennan K.,"San Francisco, CA",514,292,128,2.0,3/26/2016,"Great ambiance for family style eating. Small tvs all over the place for the ""sports bar"" feel. Menus are large mimicking Cheesecake Factory. Their supposed Chicago style deep dish pizza is not quite. Deep dish Chicago style isn't an inch of dough! I'll come here for drinks and a posh style ambience."
Sebastian S.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/10/2016,"From the hostess taking 15 minutes to seat us with maybe a handful of guests already seated at tables, to our waiter taking 20 minutes to come back with our check after clearing our plates the service was very sub-par! The food was good no disappointment there, but the service was 2 thumbs down."
Colin B.,"Bellevue, WA",136,398,1,3.0,6/16/2014,"Pizza is alittle on the doughy-side and not really thin crust. Kinda pizza hut thickness but not enough sauce. The fries are good, as is the chicken though."
Emy B.,"San Francisco, CA",34,489,197,4.0,2/5/2014,"Came in the afternoon during the 2nd quarter of the Superbowl game.  Surprisingly we were seated right away.  Other than a bit of commotion in the bar area (due to the game) the noise level wasn't as rowdy as I thought it would be --- but then again, the 49ers weren't playing.  The Quest for Six continues next season. Our server was friendly, attentive, and checked on us often.  You can't go wrong having BJ's deep dish pizza - hot, crispy, puffy dough...almost like eating a foccacia pizza.  We enjoyed one with chicken, bacon, veggies, and ranch dressing.  Really good.  I get giddy about the pizookie with ice cream.  We shared a kid's size, just enough cookie and ice cream to finish your carby meal."
Katie P.,"Fairfax, CA",1,14,,2.0,8/2/2015,"I would say BJs is right on with 2 and a half stars. Service is SLOWWWWW, but the staff is nice. Food is... eh... but what you expect in this kind of a restaurant. Mostly fried stuff. The real reason to come to BJs is for the TVs, which are ample, large, and always showing the big game of the day. My husband drags us here for any big game, as we're unfortunately without TV at the moment, and Marin is short on sports bar/tavern type places. As a sports bar that I can go to with our 15 month old daughter... 3 stars. As a restaurant/bar... 2 stars."
Garrett B.,"Sacramento, CA",1,41,6,2.0,10/23/2014,"Consistent disappointment. I've been here 10+ times because it's so close and convenient, so I really wanted it to work for last min food. But alas, it is yet another crappy restaurant in marin that overcharges people due to a lack of decent competition.  Eating in or ordering to go doesn't make a diff. Staff are hit or miss on service/friendly behavior. Everything just looks mass produced, and tastes like it came straight out of a can. I posted a pic of the $12 burger I ordered to go while sitting at the bar. I live less than 5 min from the restaurant, and it looked like it had been sitting there for hours; bun was soggy, the meat honestly looked like a dried out McDonald's patty with a giant finger sized hole in the middle...wtf? And while the bun was soggy, it was a complete mystery as to why, because it had no mayo or sauce of any kind on it. I'll never go back"
Hannah H.,"Blackhawk, CA",122,3,,1.0,10/6/2014,"The only way I can describe this restaurant is by calling it ""over priced bar food"" The Shirley Temples are 10/10, though!"
Stephanie S.,"Novato, CA",0,18,2,1.0,10/15/2015,"Been to tons of Bj's in Southern California and they never fail at the service, food, and customer service. Unfortunately this location doesn't offer this at all. Our server had a major attitude, was rude, and didn't check in on us for a solid 10 minutes when we arrived at our table on a slow Saturday morning. The avocado egg rolls at great but be prepared to wait a good extra hour for the check and the bill, and don't except friends services"
Charles K.,"Alameda, CA",370,226,1279,2.0,9/8/2013,"Since I work literally right around the corner, this is one of the many choices for lunch.  The food isn't bad, my only complaint is that 1 hour is usually not enough for lunch here. Service is usually pretty slow, even on a good day. If I have the time, this is a good option. However, if you'd like to get in, get service, and get out quickly, I suggest somewhere else.  For the time and money that you could spend especially on lunch, I'd suggest going somewhere else.  If you're eating alone or with 1 other person, this is okay. If you have a decent sized party, go somewhere else. I just came last week with someone from work who was celebrating a birthday (during our lunch hour). Took 10 minutes to take down our drink orders and another 10 minutes before our food orders were taken. Suffice it to say, half the table had to leave early to make sure we got back to work meetings in time (including the birthday girl).  And yes, we called ahead to set-up the reservation."
Juan G.,"San Rafael, CA",39,10,2,1.0,11/29/2015,"Was pretty excited when they first opened. But year after year the horrible service has remained consistent. Last time coming here, after a certain point enough is enough"
Julia D.,"San Rafael, CA",0,3,,2.0,1/26/2016,"it wasn't a very busy night. there was just the one basketball game on all of the TVs and it was a Monday night.  I ordered the rib eye with mashed potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts. the mashed potatoes were good, but there was an odd taste to the Brussels sprouts. I ordered the rib eye ""VERY rare"" and it arrived way too over cooked - medium for sure, not even medium rare. it wasn't red at all - in fact it was barely pink in the center.  other than that, the wine was good, the service was close to excellent, and my date's salmon was very nicely cooked and flavored, with a perfect sear. I would have sent my steak back, but a) I don't want to sit there watching somebody else eat while I wait for the kitchen to prepare a new meal for me and b) it's not something I would want to do when being taken out to dinner by a date, especially when we were both happy with how his meal turned out! it would have been awkward and uncomfortable, so I just didn't bother. plus - really - if somebody orders a ribeye ""very rare"", or even ""rare"", the chef should be watching it closely. It should certainly have been very obvious to both the chef AND the waiter that the plate should never have left the kitchen - there's a huge difference both in texture and visually between ""medium"" & ""very rare"". in one word - disappointing."
Angela K.,"Novato, CA",186,536,98,4.0,3/4/2015,"This place reminds me of the cheesecake factory with a beer twist. You might need extra time looking over the menu for there are quite a lot of selections. I am glad that they number the pages in the menu so I can keep track of what to choose from. I also like that they have a light menu embedded with in their large menu if you're looking to stay on a diet. Their pizzas are great, their burgers are juicy, and I love their desserts.  I recommend Pizookies.  They are basically large cookies in many different flavors that you can add ice cream to.  This is definitely a place where there is a lot of noise and often it's quite crowded. Despite this, they managed to get people seated quite quickly and serve food equally as fast. If ever I don't know what to eat and where to go, I go to BJ's brewery and know that I will get a satisfying meal."
Geoff G.,"Westminster, CA",101,2,,2.0,3/29/2016,"Called to order pickup at 9:30 pm. Phone rang for 2 minutes & I gave up. The second time I called, I didn't hang up until someone answered. That took 2 & a half minutes. Ordered food at 9:40. Was told it would be ""15 to 20 minutes, but more like 15."" Long story short... Food wasn't ready until 10:20. 15 minutes was actually 40 minutes. They are lucky they have a great ahi poke or I would have never even waited the first 2 minutes to place the order otherwise."
Ed C.,"Concord, CA",34,126,193,4.0,4/8/2015,Best happy hour with great apps 3-7pm. Avocado egg rolls really hit the spot. Two thumbs up from me
Kelsey S.,"San Anselmo, CA",166,2,,2.0,8/30/2014,"I enjoy the food, the atmosphere doesn't bother me- what did bother me was a trip in with one of my especially attractive friends. People hit on her all the time, and this waiter was no exception only it was taken it too a new, creepy and insulting level, by completely ignoring me. Normally I laugh it off (yes it happens so often it's generally funny) but if you aren't capable of looking at me while taking an order because you are staring at my friend (who very well could have been my date) I will not be tipping you well and will ask for a different waiter if seated in your section again. And no, you didn't introduce yourself to me.  Sincerely 'the friend'"
Greta R.,"San Rafael, CA",60,522,57,5.0,1/28/2014,"OK, maybe I'm just lucky based on the other reviews, but we've always had great service and food here.  We've been here about 8 times in the past year.  We had only one challenging experience where the food wasn't good and they immediately remade it and it was great.  Last time we were there, we sat at the bar.  A very friendly waitress made sure we got 2 rounds in before happy hour ended.  The beer is excellent as well."
Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2245,2841,1478,2.0,1/27/2013,"Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants. Probably becuase I grew up in a town where they were the best restuarants around. Sad but true. I remember as a teenager going to Red Lobster was a big deal, and the Olive Garden was the second-best option. So nowadays, having lived in and around San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now San Jose... I definitely have a preference for delicious, less processed, less chain-like places. So I only go to one of these joints when my friends are insistent. Which, today, they were. Don't get me wrong. The food as these joints is usually pretty decent. There are a few items at the Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory chains, in particular, which are guilty pleasures of mine. BJ's has a few of my guilty pleasures on the menu. So I can definitely make do. Two stars for this location, however, because the servers were really inattentive. Like, REALLY inattentive. It was a thirsty day, my friends and I were there a VERY long time (over three hours), and I think we got a total of four check-ins and then had to flag them down for the check. My drink was refilled twice in three hours, and was sitting there empty for half-hour periods of time. Which is definitely sub-par. The food was standard, not bad at all. The setting was fine, just like every other BJ's. But at the end of the day, we had to work way too hard to get anyone's attention, and that's not really relaxing on a mellow Saturday afternoon."
Munther H.,"Marysville, CA",31,61,170,1.0,8/25/2014,"I've been here a handful of times and have always had decent to better experiences. On this night I was left wanting more... I stopped in around 8pm on 8/25/14. The bartender was pleasant, i asked for a menu and promptly ordered something I had not had prior. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, with mashed potatoes and a side Caesar.  After 15 mins, I received a virtually undressed salad, with what appeared to be expiring lettuce. I was in a rush, so i just downed the salad. My entree appeared, and what i saw on the plate were two tiny strips of chicken and literally 1 ice cream sized dollop of mashed potatoes. I literally looked at the plate for a minute in some what of a shock....The menu said i was supposed to have some chardonnay sauce, but I could barely notice any on the plate. The meal was bland and uninspired to say the least. I paid the 20$ for the meal and left a 5$ for the bartender. For 25$ I felt completely robbed. Better luck next time I guess."
Michaela C.,"San Rafael, CA",2,8,3,1.0,7/9/2014,"The most enjoyable part about this experience was the revolving door walking into the place. I'm not kidding. The food is subpar as everyone already knows, but the service in this particular BJ's location is some of the worst I've ever experienced.  First off, we didn't receive the waiters attention for 15 minutes, and after receiving drinks it took her 25 more minutes to take our order. Chris Harris needs some serious help running this place. Once receiving our food, we realized we didn't have any silverware, which is fine- as i understand it may have been hectic, but the silverware we then received was still dirty- and I'm sorry - but i am not one whom enjoys eating from pre- used forks that have been in other peoples' mouths. Unacceptable in my book. The food was mediocre but our salad was missing a main ingredient. So, if you are going to come looking for a meal with enjoyable staff- keep walking past this place, please just keep walking and never turn back."
