Saoirse F.,"Vacaville, CA",8,15,,1.0,7/30/2015,"It's rare that I drop three stars for service alone, but the waitress here was just kind of snarky and meanspirited. She must be independently wealthy and working for the fun of it, because she seems to feel happy enough disrespecting customers. In any event, she'll never get a tip from me."
Jennifer J.,"San Francisco, CA",2,63,71,4.0,3/16/2015,Devin our waiter was very friendly and accurate. I often visit BJs and don't bother with a review but this past Saturday our service was exceptional.
Emilly Y.,"Sausalito, CA",0,6,2,1.0,8/10/2015,Worst customer service ever. Never coming back again. You're better off going to Applebees's right around the corner. There is a reason why this place only has 2 and 1/2 stars.
Arlene R.,"Novato, CA",0,25,6,1.0,9/25/2015,"Again, I should  have known better,  but I thought I would give it a try. WRONG! !! We got there early,  put our name in, they say  it would not be long, great....all of a sudden they were busy....and of course we sat a waited for out name to be called. Nope!!!! Almost everyone that came in after us, got seated!!!! Went up to the hostess asked when she was going to seat us? Oh, I didn't put your name in#&&€=!=#!!....and we left. ...never to go back again ! Wake up BJ'S , you SUCK!"
Robert L.,"San Carlos, CA",19,8,1,4.0,12/10/2015,"BJ's is fun place to go with friends or colleagues for a reasonably priced meal.  I go to the one at Bridgeport plaza, either in foster city or San Mateo.  Their lunch specials are a great deal for a lot of food, usually about $8-$9 for a combo sandwich and salad or soup.  The key to BJ's is the consistency of food and service.  The food is always done perfectly and the service is good.  It's also a pretty good sports venue with all the TV's.  Tuesday's are half-price wine, which is awesome for you wine drinkers!"
Christopher M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,,3.0,11/23/2014,"The food is ok but the service is so slow. Takes forever to get your order taken and then even longer for them to bring the drinks you order. This isn't just a one-off either, it happens every time."
Brie V.,"Rocklin, CA",52,7,1,5.0,3/5/2016,"We had the most amazing experience here tonight!!! From our waiter Andrew, to the manager Chris to the bartender's, we had such a great dinner!!! We were a large group with no reservations and we were so happy!! This restaurant deserves way better reviews! Food is great, service is great! High five!!!! Y'all rock!!!!  Try the monkey bread pizookie!! It was amazingggggg!!!"
Katie C.,"San Rafael, CA",65,4,,5.0,3/5/2016,Had an amazing experience at BJs in San Rafael! Our waiter Andrew was excellent server and had us try the new buffalo chicken grilled cheese made by Sigfredo the Chef on them after he spoke with his amazing Manager Chris!!! Thanks for an amazing experience!!! :-) We will be back!
Melissa B.,"San Rafael, CA",60,1,,5.0,3/5/2016,"Had an amazing experience at the B.J's in San Rafael! We had to wait a little for our table for 9, but the team here was so great! Our Server Andrew was so wonderful! He was so nice and connected with his Manager Chris to give us a free sample of a new menu item made by Sigfredo! It was a buffalo chicken grilled cheese and it was delicious! Best experience I have had here yet! Thank you for making our get together so enjoyable!! So awesome!"
Maria D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",42,124,14,4.0,1/30/2015,THE CALIFORNIA BURGER is the best..  always a family favorite for dinner.. I like the Tv's and beer selection
Remy B.,"San Rafael, CA",109,59,32,5.0,1/1/2015,I forgot BJ's does not serve breakfast on weekdays.  They do have a great breakfast menu.  I often meet my buddy Candi Chamberlin here on Sunday for brunch. She turned me on to the awesome corn fritters.
Nicole K.,"Mission Viejo, CA",11,10,,1.0,5/29/2015,Aweful service. The staff would rather watch the game than do their job. Tuna poke was frozen fish cubes and the managers did nothing about it. It's not the first time I had a bad experience at this location. Needless to say they will not be getting a third chance.
Mr R.,"San Rafael, CA",87,150,19,1.0,7/28/2014,"Was here today at 4 pm on 07/28. The place was empty for the exception of 2 tables.  There was at least 8 employees standing around. The 4 of us were never acknowledged as we sat in a booth in the bar section.   We sat for 10 minutes waiting for maybe a nod that someone would be right with us.. Nope too much to ask I guess. No hello, no water, nothing.  I used to like this place but I guess something has changed.   Won't step foot in here again. What a freaking joke! Maybe the next place that gets put in this spot will be better? Why not try actually hire a manager that can actually manage!"
Hannah C.,"Chico, CA",0,17,1,2.0,8/30/2015,"The food was super bland, but the drinks were reasonably priced and also a great selection. Service was weak."
Kerry S.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/12/2015,"The waiter was nice but fairly inept. Forgot multiple things, brought things not ordered and got orders wrong. The food was pricey and not good. Clearly sat under a heat lamp, lacking in flavor or fresh ingredients and physically made me ILL in the middle of the night after returning home. There are plenty of excellent mom and pop places in Marin that folks can enjoy with great food and service for around the same price. Skip this overpriced dump of a chain restaurant."
Olivia A.,"Novato, CA",0,13,12,4.0,9/24/2014,Why so many negative reviews? i love BJ's! the food is fantastic here and the waiters are very nice and really help with whatever you need. i recommend getting the best beginnings appetizer combo because it has nearly every appetizer in one huge platter with the best dipping sauces ever! i find my self craving this after i leave. i just love the food and atmosphere here and love to come with some friends. i would really recommend!
Breana T.,"Hercules, CA",2,99,31,1.0,6/1/2016,"Absolutely terrible service. Worse experience ever. I went in with my team a group of 16-18 year olds, we waited patiently as our waitress served everyone else but us. Eventually she became attentive but I, as the adult accompanying them I caught her eye rolls and utter disregard for our group because of the majority of their ages. One of the salads came out drenched in oil from the blooming onion atop and coated in this terrible dressing. Of course we didn't like it and didn't want it, requested something else and she said that she would have to talk to the manager. She came back to say that we can order something else but they won't take it off the bill. Let me start by saying, that manager has no class. If there's a problem YOU yourself come to the table. Secondly, don't send the waitress over to talk to the 16yr old. Talk to the adult that addressed the issue with you in the first place. Disgusting! Will not return! Clearly need more training for the staff and this manager should not be on the floor. Latino gentlemen as the manager it seemed. Unfortunate that this wasn't handled more professionally as it affected her tip."
Bryan T.,"San Rafael, CA",30,8,2,2.0,10/28/2015,"I've been here many times, but I feel the service gets worse every time I come back. The food is not bad for a chain but this last time I was in with my girlfriend and we had to wave down someone after sitting for 15 minutes so we could order. It was a weeknight that didn't seem very busy so I'm not too sure why it took so long to check in with us. Like I said the food is not bad, but the service is mediocre. Give yourself plenty of time if you plan on eating here and wave down someone if you need anything because they forget to check in with you."
Sarah H.,"San Anselmo, CA",177,24,53,5.0,11/17/2014,"This place is awesome! It's probably my top 3 favorite place in Marin to go for typical comfort food :). The menu is huge which I love so you can get pretty much anything you think of. I have tried a lot of things but my favorites are the corn fritters, crispy artichoke hearts, black and bleu house burger, California club flatbread, boneless wings, and potato skins. The servers are always friendly and my favorite bartender is Mel. She is amazing and always really fun and helpful. This is one of those neighborhood friendly places that's delicious and warms your belly:)"
Rick H.,"Mill Valley, CA",6,171,,2.0,4/26/2014,"This place is convenient if you're going to a movie at the mall, but that's really all it has going for it. That said, we've been here more times than I'd like to think. They have an enormous menu, which is a red flag itself. How can a kitchen give personal care to enough different items to fill about ten pages? It can't. But, be fair, this is a mall chain restaurant. Nobody's expecting anything special. But, how about something that doesn't taste goopy and sweet? Stick to the burger. They can't mess that up too badly. They seem quite proud of there own beer, which is mediocre at best, but they do offer a good selection of other independent beers. That's good. And while I'm at it, the TVs and attempt to be a sports bar is kind of a joke. There are a lot of TVs, but they are way high up, very far away and all have the sound off. So they work more as wallpaper than something you could pay attention to.  If you're going to a movie at the mall check out Roadhouse BBQ instead. It's still not great, but it's a nice alternative."
