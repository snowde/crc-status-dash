Tom P.,"Sonoma, CA",6,122,72,2.0,4/17/2014,"This is a below average BJ's location. The beer is the same but the food not so good. My Caesar salad was wilted yellow and brown With very little dressing or flavor. I asked for a new one. The waitress came back out and presented me with a new salad telling me she opened a new bag of salad and this should be a lot fresher! I guess you don't know for sure if you don't use fresh ingredients. A bag, huh?"
Clu C.,"Novato, CA",56,49,33,1.0,3/27/2014,"JUST CLOSE THE DOORS. We arrived around 6:30pm to a mob of folks waiting to be seated. But while looking around there were quite a number of tables/booths available. I asked one of the many hostesses if we could seat ourselves, because she gave us a wait time of 10-15 minutes. And then she graciously explained it is the policy to be taken to our table. Really? Because there were more people waiting to be seated than were actually eating! Moving on...we ordered and 34 minutes later our food arrived. We ordered: Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms (there were 5) $5.25. They were so shiny...greasy with cheese, nothing else. It arrived with our main course and were at room temperature.  Mini Pizza, Chicken Bacon Ranch $10.95. I do not suggest the deep dish for a mini pizza, as suggested by our server. Its all crust. This, too, was a room-temperature dish. Parmesan Chicken $14.95 The description and the actual plate of food in front me greatly differed. It described a parmesan chicken with a lemon, butter, chardonnay sauce. But there was no sauce. The broccoli had white ""dry"" spots on it as if it were cooked after having freezer burn. I asked the waitress if my dish came with this sauce, it did. The server said the sauce must have soaked into the chicken...Ya, that happens if it sits a while, I'm sure because SURPRISE it was not hot at all. All I've heard is that BJ's has great beer. So don't get your hopes set on a nice dinner.  My last comment, after the appetizers and dinner were presented on the table, our server quickly left us to eat. But we had to table settings. No napkin. No fork and knife. After a few minutes we flagged her at another table and asked for flatware. The table across from us flagged her and asked for their silverware. Hmmmm? Really. So not impressed. The servers are spread thinly in their sections so food will be delivered cold, there will be no silverware and good luck waiting to be seated. Never again."
Cait W.,"Milford, CT",0,8,,3.0,8/1/2016,"I've been here 4 times now and the food has always delivered. Their brussel sprouts, avocado rolls and burgers are all fantastic. The service leaves something to be desired. The first time we went the waiter was on top of his game, the second time the waiter took 30 mins to get our drink order. We saw every waiter in the place hustling around but ours kept disappearing. Our apps came out the same time as dinner, we never saw the waiter between ordering and paying so there were no drink refills or a check in to see if our food was to par. The third time same thing, and the fourth the service was good but the drinks from the bar took far too long. Overall, I give it three stars."
D C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,21,4,1.0,7/7/2015,"My boyfriend and I came here to grab something to eat after visiting San Francisco last night since we already knew it was one of the few restaurants that stays open late and it was on the way home. We could've gone to our usual BJ's but it was a bit out of the way. I really wish we went to that one instead - considering that we're basically regulars and we've never had a terrible experience.  This BJ's seriously sucked. When we walked in, the host kinda looked at us like we needed to leave. We got there an hour before they closed, so I'm not sure what that was about. When she took us to our table, she basically just plopped down the menus and weakly said, ""Have a nice day."" Okay. Fine. Our server came by later on and I thought he was decent but something about him seemed off. I ordered the spaghetti marinara and he asked me if I wanted to add meat. I politely told him no but it looked like he thought it was funny that I only wanted noodles and sauce. Sorry, I currently do not eat meat? Anyway, our food came out like half an hour later. The wait didn't bother me because there were interesting activities going on in the restaurant to look at, so yeah. The guy who dropped off our food basically did what the host did - plopped the plates down and left. I was disappointed when I didn't see garlic bread on both of our plates because we both ordered pasta and the menu said that all pasta dishes came with garlic bread. We ended up asking our main server for it. After that, we kinda stopped seeing him for a while. Like, where did you go, man. When we were done eating, he was about to drop off our check but I guess some old friends came in at the same time. They were seated right next to us and we heard him having a full-on conversation with them for a while. It took him about 5 minutes to walk like 3 steps to drop it off. I understand that you miss them and all but we had to go and it was already close to midnight. As soon as we got the check, we immediately paid and set it out so that he would know that we were ready to go. Nope, still had to have a great conversation with his friends. I guess he saw how irritated I was because I was facing him, so he finally took the check and gave it back immediately. Overall, the service sucked the most. It would've been nice if the employees acted like they were happy to be there. At least acted like it. It also would've been nice if our server excused himself from the conversation to let us go. The food was okay, but it was something I couldn't have too much of because it got annoying."
Elliott G.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,4,,3.0,7/30/2016,Food was decent. Servers were average. Chairs were really top-heavy. I almost flipped my chair. They really need to do something about the chairs.
T F.,"Vallejo, CA",3,126,326,3.0,8/24/2015,Just a quick update....the service has improved a lot here.  The last couple of times we had good waitresses.  I don't know their names but one of the waitresses had a flower in her hair.  She was very friendly and attentive even though we were in the very busy happy hour section.  The drinks are a little sucky but the bazookie (?) Totally makes up for it and so does the pizza.  Their pizza has a nice thick and greasy/buttery crust.  It's really good.  BJ'S is now my second favorite happy hour spot.
Mega P.,"Novato, CA",7,2,,1.0,5/4/2014,"Mind the reviews below mine, if you're someone whose restaurant experience depends on service, then trust me, you're probably not going to have a good time here. My group and I walked in on a Sunday night, the place was busy but not too busy with plenty of open tables and a short wait.  We were seated and then waited a full fifteen or more minutes to simply be approached by a waitress, and that was only after a very kind man sitting in the table next to us complained FOR US to the management. After complaining, it still took another 5 or 7 minutes before we were served water. Water. Something that's usually given to you within the first five minutes of walking in.  Our waitress's only response was that they were short staffed, which I understand and am sympathetic toward. Clearly it's also a management problem. As others have said before, if this place is short staffed on a Sunday night (not a super busy night but not quiet either), then they need to hire more waiters. I think I would hate being here on actual busy days. Usually BJs run like well oiled machines, this one ran like the rusty, spluttering car that's now sitting in your grandpas garage. Besides the subpar service, the food was also sub par compared to what I'm used to getting at a BJs. Our flatbread appetizer was disgustingly soggy. Had we not been so hungry by this time, we probably would have sent it back.  Our entrees were pretty bland, flavorless and doused with oil (clearly BJs is not the place to go if you're watching what you eat, but I've never had food this oily here either). Perhaps it's just those items we ordered. Be what it may, I'm not willing to go back and give it another chance anytime soon. If you like BJs Restaurant, and you want to keep liking it, just avoid this particular location."
Kazia H.,"San Rafael, CA",1,2,,3.0,12/20/2014,"The food was delicious and our server was nice  However, we almost left because the hostess was so rude. Host is easily the least stressful position in the restaurant and her attitude was absurd. That's the face of your restaurant and you do not want that kind of first impression."
Bobby D.,"Moscow, ID",1,8,,3.0,4/3/2014,"I've been there a total of three times but it's never really impressed me that much. The first thine I went there was on a first date and it was HORRIBLE!!! I GOT FOOD POISONING!!!  About two years later I decided to give them a second chance, no food poisoning this time but the food was sub par. Third time food was decent but service was shoddy.  Atmosphere is a bit wanna-be brewery/pub/mid scale dining experience, but it's nice that they have a separate bar for the adults who stop by after work do they aren't interrupted by the occasional 4 year old brat who screams when he has to eat his veggies... That's the only real thing that made me give it an extra star bringing it up to 3"
Smia S.,"Novato, CA",2,28,1,4.0,7/6/2015,"I've been to a lot of BJ restaurants in the bay and sac and can for sure say that no other BJs has better service or food. Every restaurant I go to either has really bad service but good food or really bad food but awesome service. Sometimes even both lol. They do well to accommodate big parties, takes a while to get your food at times but that's to be expected when you go to any restaurant. Love the pale ale nachos, always have to order it as an appetizer when I'm here with the fam."
Tracey A.,"Marin County, CA",280,1133,1354,3.0,1/30/2012,"First, there's that name.  Really?  That's the best they could come up with?  And just what are they serving up here?  (Okay, not what you're hoping for).       Second there's the location:  Suburban mall and not even a very upscale one.  Anchor stores at this mall are Macy's, Kohl's, and Sears so you get that no Cheesecake Factory or PF Chang's will ever be opening up here.     Third there's the ambience:  LOUD.  It's a great big sports bar with a full bar and a full service restaurant.   And finally, the menu.  These words actually came out of the mouth of our waitress:  ""The first 8 pages are drinks"".  What she didn't say is that the rest of the novel-sized menu looks an awful lot like that of the Cheesecake Factory.  it even has a section of ""enlightened entrees"" under 575 calories each, which makes me tremble imagining how many calories I must've consumed between my Greyhound and my Cobb Salad.   The food and drink went down easy:  A  few glasses of Sterling Chardonnay, a Ketel One, and the aforementioned Greyhound, a Rib Eye Steak (served with choice of 2 sides), Chicken a la Fresca (""enlightened""), a big Italian Salad, plus my Cobb.  4 people and a generous tip ran $30 apiece, so despite everything, this place requires a little investment. If I must do the chain thing I prefer Cheesecake Factory over this (it's quieter and prettier) and the price seems the same.  That said, there was nothing wrong here, it's just not my scene."
L T.,"San Pablo, CA",154,59,547,1.0,2/16/2014,"I came here for my boyfriends birthday because for one, we were headed to Graton's Casino, 2, my boyfriend chose BJ's to celebrate dinner with the homies. Lastly, it was the nearest location on the way to the casino from where we live. Based on the reviews of this place, I already knew it was going to be TERRIBLE. I mean come on, consistent complaints here and there from yelpers. I told my boyfriend and he said well what can we do. I said, ""if you wanna deal with it, then you  already know"". So he says, f' it lets just go. (Last minute sorta thing)  We made reservations and still had to wait another 15 mins, ok based on the reviews thats expected. Surprisingly our waiter TIM was very attentive, great, and enthusiastic but little we did we know, he hates his job and overall hates dealing with customers. He charges us for things he says he'll put on the house. Then says well, I dont feel like arguing about this so Ill take it off the tab , wtf do you mean?  I shared that special 2 for 20 with the two meals and salads and a dessert. We waited forever for our pizookie plus the free pizookie on the house. He comes and assures us our pizookies are coming right up,after waiting so long we said f'd the pizookies just give us a check because we gotta get to places im sorry. we asked for our check, after 20 mins nothing. All i see is this guy attending every one else when all we want is a check. Seriously dude. Get your head outta your ass. Then he comes and says, look all im trying to do is give good service and make everyone happy.  By doing that sir, make sure you accommodate the needs of those in a timely manner and actually give people what they've paid for. I dont mean to sound like an asshole . but whatever. I hate this location straight up."
Jerry M.,"San Rafael, CA",2,6,,2.0,3/30/2014,"The new BJ's restaurant in San Rafael has been open for less than 6 months, and is still showing some rough edges one would associate with any full-service restaurant starting from scratch.  And yet I'm puzzled how the local BJ's has been unable to solve some of their staffing issues even after 6 months. Economic times are tough, and there are surely dozens of applicants for every job opening.  When Kohl's department store advertised for job applicants at their new store at San Rafael's Northgate Mall -- the same location as BJ's -- they had long lines of eager people, looking for work. The menu at BJ's is a wonderful fusion of brew-pub food mixed with Asian and Italian specialties -- offering an amazingly broad range of exciting tastes.  The issue in San Rafael isn't the menu: it's certainly got to do with an inexperienced front-of-house staff that just can't seem to stay focused on the basics of getting the orders correct, serving them while still hot, and remembering small details. I don't know if the problem of inexperience is in the kitchen as well, but I'd have to assume so -- BJ's seems to go for younger staff members with little or no prior restaurant experience. We were invited to a pre-opening private ""dress rehearsal"" meal (at no charge, except for drinks) as a result of my active participation in the San Rafael Chamber of Commerce.  My wife, a close friend, and I had a really good brew-pub meal, enjoying a wide spectrum of items.  We met some of the executive staff.  Service was timely, carefully orchestrated, and surprisingly good for a brand-new operation. Subsequent visits to BJ's revealed deeper problems that the General Manager and his key people were having with the inexperienced staff.  We've been back to BJ's four times since the pre-opening festivities, and things don't seem to be improving. On our most recent visit, this past Saturday evening, we arrived early in evening service, and were shown to our table promptly, even though we had no reservation.  The first thing I noticed were the employees who were hosts for the evening -- four young women, with nothing productive to do -- so they do what anyone would expect -- chat among themselves.  It took the four some minutes to decide where they would seat us. Our server was attentive and courteous, if overly solicitous.  We ordered our drinks.  My wife's coffee came promptly, but my cocktail order seemed to take an inordinately long time.  The server brought it only after I reminded her that I was waiting for it, when she came to ask if we had any questions for her, and were we ready. I've had this exact same experience at this BJ's before.  The bar service seems out of sync with the ordinary idea that drinks are served promptly when ordered, not after a random delay, ending only when the server is prompted."
Dana G.,"Oak Park, CA",1,2,,1.0,10/14/2016,"Let me start off by saying that I use to LOVE going to this place down in So Cal.  It was the best place to have good food/service and was very efficient.  But his place is one of the worst I've ever been in the area.  They can't even get things right when it's not busy, I hate to see how shitty they are if they get busy!!  I went twice and both times the services was TERRIBLE.  They don't greet you at the front door, and then even if nobody else is in the restaurant - they make you wait?!  For what I'm not sure but I thought it was a one time even when I went with my husband, but I went back with my mother and it was the same thing.  The place was not busy and completely dead and yet it still took them time to seat us, then 10 minutes for a waitress, another 10-20 for the drinks and the food at least 45-1 hour.  The food was OK and that's about it.  I don't know how this place can stay in business aside from the alcohol.  That's it's only redeeming quality.  Otherwise, steer clear of this place.  Unless you have an extra two hours to eat and you aren't super hungry.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place anymore!  So Sad."
Jimmy W.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,42,,1.0,1/3/2016,"They should seriously consider replacing their bartenders with robots, I'm sure robots would have more personality! Ordered the bison burger with a side of Cole Slaw. Asked for the bison burger medium, it was well done, no flavor at all. They toasted the bun because the bread was stale. If I owned a pet rabbit, I wouldn't have fed it the cole slaw that would be cruel thing to do!"
Chad G.,"San Rafael, CA",1,1,,1.0,1/11/2014,"Has gone REALLY down hill since opening. Food is terrible, service even worse. I ordered a salad take out and got shards of broken ceramic dishes IN the salad! Avoid!"
Nicole S.,"Petaluma, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/24/2015,"Came here on a Saturday (busy) night. Service was pretty quick, food was excellent. The piranha pale ale was great!!"
Wes H.,"San Francisco, CA",58,77,1,2.0,10/26/2013,"If you care about good service, don't come here. If you don't mind waiting and being ignored, then come on in!! Pros: -food is ok for a chain restaurant.  -good sized portions.  -a lot of beer choices Cons: -waited at the to-go cashier/order counter for 5 minutes. No one there. Went to the main hostess station where she told me to go back and wait another 5 minutes and if no one shows up, then come back and see her. WTF? -everyone looks like they hate their job and it's the end of their shift. Why should I tip in these circumstances? We have this place 3-4 tries both eat in and to go, but finally we just wrote it off and decided never to come back.  Alternatives: go to roadhouse BBQ on the Kohls side of the mall for good BBQ. Go to Tomatina for some Italian food."
Tiffany M.,"San Francisco, CA",68,280,24,4.0,12/12/2013,"Honestly, after reading the previous reviews I didn't want to eat here. But, I am willing to give any food a second chance! We came in for lunch at 11am on a Thursday, and were seated immediately as there was barely anyone else there. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. The pomegranate margarita is one of the best I've had, not weak but not too strong. We ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke, Boneless Buffalo Wings, and Stuffed Mushrooms - and I would rate them in that order (1st, 2nd, 3rd). With a beer to add, the total came to around $40. Not bad for a delicious and satisfying lunch for two!"
Esmirna M.,"Glendale, CA",62,28,18,5.0,7/15/2015,"Let me say, Trevor is the best waiter around! We were a party of 8 with 6 children! He got all our orders in , in a timely manner and made sure our drinks were always full. He made sure we had all our utensils and kept coming by making sure we had everything we needed! I am really happy that our time at BJ'S was a great one!"
