Kevin C.,"Greenbrae, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/23/2015,"If you like fat, fat, fat then you will find something here. Greasy, lot's of ranch dressing disguised as special sauces; like we can't tell.... Salads smothered in dressing. But the worst part was getting food poisoning after eating the fish there. They make a very good drink if you stick to the basics but the appetizers are all fatty and unappealing."
Michael C.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/10/2015,"A comedy of errors best explains this experience; however, not so funny at the time.  One in our group of six did not receive his meal -- a simple order of wings.  After waiting 10 minutes and then tracking down our waitress to ask about the holdup, we were told there was a mix up in the kitchen and the wings would be brought out in a few minutes.   Some 20 plus minutes later, which was after everyone else had finished, the wings were finally brought out. As we were heading to a movie, no time to wait to eat the wings, so one in our group left without eating.  Never experienced such a situation before and definitely will never chance experiencing it again at this restaurant, which clearly is desperately in need of an intervention."
Jeff W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,,3.0,2/10/2016,"Had a bad experience, but was contacted by corporate and they made a wrong a right.   Really, first class way to resolve a problem Thank you!!"
Alonzo T.,"Pacifica, CA",207,131,11,5.0,12/3/2015,i don't know why they have such a low start count. but i am a harsh guy when it comes to service. this is one of the few bjs that has fast ticket times and good hot food. a lot of the times i go to this chain the food temps for my party would normally be a split with one cold plate one hot and one warm. i do like that they seat you right away and that this is a decent size location. they also offer outside seating with heaters and tvs. plenty of parking a friendly staff
Jamie S. R.,"San Francisco, CA",3,8,,3.0,10/25/2014,"It's ok nothing too special to write home about. I do like the coffee here. Maybe that's why I keep coming back. The menu isn't that great anymore. The upside is they server larger trucker size portions, so you can take home."
Tara B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,13,,1.0,1/1/2016,"If you have a few spare hours to wait for food and service then this is your place! Every time I have been here it takes forever to get food and the service is just plain slow. No matter what you order or if the place is half empty, you still wait and wait and the food is always just average. Yes convenient, but you would be better getting in your car and going somewhere else!!"
Rachel H.,"Simi Valley, CA",132,622,,3.0,2/15/2013,"I had lunch here with my 94 year old grandfather the other day, while we waited for some medical test results for him.  The food was very tasty for chain restaurant fare such as this, the service was good and the prices were great for the quantity provided.   But at lunchtime on a Wednesday, the music was so loud it was like we were out clubbing. My hard of hearing, hearing aid wearing Gramps is likely not their main demographic, so he suffered and we just didn't talk much during lunch.  I'd go back, tho."
Linda M.,"Westminster, CA",63,304,190,1.0,12/15/2012,Hate this place especially when other parties who show up 15-20 minutes after you get seated first.  My party and I watched as 6 other parties who showed up way after us were seated before we did.  The only reason why we were even seated was we complained twice.  The first time I was told that there was just one party ahead of us and then we would be seated afterwards.  One party became 6 other parties.  After seeing that we asked again and they said they could seat us now.  ReallY? now?  Awful customer service.  Awful hostesses.  Going to take my business elsewhere.  I would give this place zero stars if I could.
Sam M.,"Horseheads, NY",2,10,11,1.0,10/16/2012,"Maybe it doesn't help that we went during game one of the 2012 NLDS.  But the place was loud.  Crowded.  And full of drunk- and soon-to-be-drunk Giants fans.  So, no, not very ""hipster"", ""romantic"", ""classy"", or good for kids.  And the views of most of the TVs were blocked by people standing everywhere. I ordered a burger, which was decent in size, but not seasoned at all.  Relying on chipolte mayo and fried jalepenos to cover the fact that the burger lacks flavor is a sad thing. What's even more sad was the ""calzone"" my wife ordered.  The calzone for one person, priced at $9.75, was the size of a Hot Pocket.  No exaggeration.  With a little cup of marinara on the side.  My wife asked for more, never got it. To be fair, the beer was good.  Got the right one, but was never asked if I wanted another...Maybe because our server was too busy tending to all of the drinkers.  In fact, the only time she returned was to take our plates.  When I was still eating.  ""No, we're not finished.  Does it look like my plate is empty?""  Add poor customer service to poor food, portion size, and pricing. Not going back any time soon.  Maybe when hockey season rolls around and the place is empty."
Chelsea E.,"Rocklin, CA",156,74,38,2.0,2/11/2013,So I don't give out only 2 stars very often but for this place I have to based on the service we received.   We came in on a Saturday night after a normal dinner time but well before closing.  We were seated in about 10min.  Our table was very small for 6 adults ordering dinner so we asked our waiter if we could add the table next to ours since it was not busy and he just acted so annoyed.  The whole time we were there it was hard to get his attention and when we asked for something he just acted like it was a huge inconvenience.  Our food was good and came out in a timely manner.  If I stop here again when I am out and about I will update the review based on that.  Hopefully I won't get the same waiter.
Celina M.,"San Rafael, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/12/2014,"Surprisingly lovely and attentive service! Hostesses and wait staff were genuinely kind, food and cocktails lived up to expectation and then some. Place was PACKED but treated like we were one of the only tables."
Pam M.,"Tracy, CA",0,24,,1.0,8/14/2014,This service is HORRIBLE!  The waitress that sat us was VERY rude.  Never welcomed us to BJ's or anything.  When she sat us she was talking to another employee at the front while seating us.  The employees just sit around and do NOTHING!  I've been to the San Jose BJ's and got wonderful service.  This place SUCKS big time!!!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
Ali D.,"Novato, CA",0,14,,5.0,7/3/2015,We had a great experience here tonight! Our party of 9 had two servers. Jack R. and another guy were very attentive. The food was very good. The Asian Chopped Salad is fantastic. The hamburgers came exactly as ordered. We'll definitely be back.
A Y.,"Larkspur, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/8/2016,"A pretty bad experience! I will not set foot inside one of your restaurants again. It is very difficult for me to eat out because of my celiac disease. When I find a restaurant that already has a gluten free menu, I expect the wait staff and kitchen to understand what that means! My waiter was nice enough and did note the my order should be gluten free. HOWEVER, the kitchen plopped fried onion rings on top of my dish.(Balsamic chicken breast on field greens, no potatoes or onion rings. A different server brought the dish to my table. I pointed out the problem and he didn't know what I was a talking about. He took the plate away and said he'd find my wait person. We had already waited beyond a reasonable amount of time for our orders (3 of us). Now I had to wait about 10 minutes for the wait person to come back to the table so I could explain the problem. He said he'd get a new plate right away. It took another 15 minutes. My friends accompanying me were done with their meal by now and I wasn't served yet. Finally the meal comes. I started to cut the chicken breast and could not cut through. It was very tough and dry. It needed a steak knife. I tasted it anyway. It was horrible!!! Dry, tough, extremely salty and tasted very bad. Obviously NOT fresh chicken. Or they microwaved it to death. I couldn't eat it. I had the waiter remove the item from the check. Paid the bill for my friends meal. I left starving. Absolutely horrible and demeaning experience."
Thomas P.,"San Anselmo, CA",36,22,26,1.0,3/2/2014,"Walked in with my wife. Gave our name to the hostess for a table. It was very loud and boomy. We tried to order a drink while we waited for our table. It was not very crowded. The bartenders were at the other end of the bar and did not notice us so we walked to the other end of the bar. I ordered two Absolute Greyhounds. The bar tender did not know what that was. When I told him he held up two glasses and asked which one did I want our drinks in. Luckily the hostess said our table was ready. I told the bar tender that I would order from my table. I ordered a beer and my wife, a glass of wine. The food was kind of like a glorified Denny's. Except worse. My food was cold and the vegetable was corn. Cold, over cooked, dried up little kernels that should be in the popper. The service was ok. Lot's of young people working there. I believe that the management has really let BJ's corporate office down. Next time Denny's."
Alaina J.,"Novato, CA",9,36,1,2.0,4/26/2014,"We've eaten here a handful of times because it's easy and convenient with kids.  Tonight will be our last visit to this BJ's. While packing up our kids, my husband forgot his phone on the table.  We walked out to the car, loaded up the kids, and my husband went back in to retrieve his phone.  It was no where to be found.  And, in the 10 minutes it was left behind, someone thought enough to turn it off so we couldn't track it.  BJ's was no help whatsoever.  Most costly dinner ever."
Amber K.,"Carmichael, CA",75,20,,1.0,3/5/2014,"its amazing how many horrible reviews this place has and still nothing has changed, it looks like you need new management! I wish i read the reviews before going, heads up to people, do not eat their soup, they obviously keep it for a long time and serve the customers OLD soup, lets just say it was not fun having food poisoning when i came here for my birthday."
Nadia S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,22,1,4.0,12/21/2014,"Just had a beer, calamari, and spinach & artichoke dip--very good.  I especially love the spaciousness of BJs.  You never get the feeling you should leave, because people are impatiently waiting for a table;  there is plenty of space, and TV sets everywhere in case you want to check out the game.  Our server, Henry, was prompt and gracious.  Had a great time!"
Daniel W.,"Los Angeles, CA",287,209,50,4.0,5/8/2010,"First--what's all this hating about BJ's food and service? I've eaten here a number of different times with different people. The service has always been fine, the food has always been great. Got it?  IF YOU LIKE DEEP DISH PIZZA, YOU WILL LIKE BJs. And there are so many kinds of foods that it's like the Cheesecake Factory for Men! Get this in your head: I'm serious about pizza, OK? The best thin crust is at the Cheese Board Pizza Collective in Berkeley. The best thick-crust is at Buddy's pizza in the Detroit area (yes, Detroit, not Chicago--I love Chicago but Buddy's is better. Period. End of story). I keep trying new pizza and so far nothing has eclipsed these joints. So--BJ's pizza is not the best in the world--but it is VERY GOOD, light thick crust (not too hard, like some Chicago style pies can be), light sauce and toppings. ""She Who Must Not Be Named"" declared it ""good enough to eat again."" I'm lucky if this happens once a leap year, so it's always an auspicious sign. My take: this is MALE CHEESECAKE FACTORY. It has an endless menu so you can get just about any kind of food (good if you're in a group and people can't decide between Italian, Mexican or Asian), an art deco-ish decor, but instead of cheesecake, there's beer--lots and lots of it. I don't drink beer, I don't care about beer (beer looks and smells like pee to me--I'm sorry, it just does), I came for the PIZZA. A friend took me to a BJ's in La Mesa--it was late and most places were closed (BJ's is open till 11pm on weekdays, midnight on Friday's and Saturday's) and I wanted pizza. It totally hit the spot--I was surprised at how good this deep dish pizza is. The crust is light, the toppings are good. It's quite delicious and reminds me of Numero Uno Pizza from when I lived in LA (Numero Uno, not to be confused with Pizzeria Uno or the various other Unos, is still delicious but it's only in the LA area). Look, I know this is a chain, often found at malls, and some haters will act as if I've piled praise on Applebee's (which, for the record, is home to some of the worst food I ever attempted to but then could not eat).  BUT--they do a very good job here, and when you want good deep dish pizza, this is better than even some of the ""classy"" places in the city (which I won't mention, because other people think they're great, and I think they're cardboard).  The prices are also reasonable--$10 for a small pizza that was a meal for two. (I just went to another deep dish place that will also go unnamed that wanted $20 for a similar sized pizza).  I have one complaint--the music is just too freaking loud. On the positive side, I asked them nicely to turn it down and they did. But the music at this entire mall feels oppressive--there's even music blaring outside. What's wrong with the world now--can people not go a few moments without music blasting in their ears? If they want that, don't they already have an iPod permanently attached to their brainstem?  TURN DOWN THE MUSIC, PLEASE (this goes for the cheesecake factory, too)."
Nancy O.,"San Rafael, CA",0,6,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Terrible service and food.  Waiter forgot order, drinks, refills, ketchup. Brought one parties meal about 30 min. before the other parties food arrived. Forgot cheese on hamburger.  Forgot to bring ketchup and mustard to table.   Food was tasteless and I would highly recommend not going to eat at this establishment. It is WAY overrated.  Three different waiters around our table including our own all were apologizing for forgetting things, poor service, to other customers, etc.  No manager around to talk with or oversee all of these employees demonstrated poor customer service. Do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to spend your money.  We DEFINITELY will not be coming back again."
