Chris P.,"Cotati, CA",54,47,25,2.0,2/18/2014,Wow. Wish I had a chance to eat here today. We went in at about 12:15. The host was checking in a table of 2 & 3 and we stood there and were not even acknowledged. So we just left. They were not even busy. At least put someone at the front that smiles and has a positive vibe. Did not feel good about the vibe. So now were are here at Roadside BBQ. Will update on the results! Back to BJ's...great looking place inside and probably good. They did look understaffed so I wouldn't expect too much from the service side. Hopefully the food is good. I will be back at a later date and try it out. Thanks for reading my post. - Chris
Dave L.,"San Rafael, CA",6,106,,2.0,1/12/2010,"Took my family and a few friends to this place last night.  It took a couple tries to get in--calling their confused and unpleasant hosts was difficult, and they don't take reservations.   It looks beautiful inside, like Moylans and the Cheesecake Factory were squooshed together.  And it's noisy, but that's what we expected.  The waiters were nice guys, but they seem completely disorganized and they don't know the menu or beers very well.  It is a huge menu, and the selection of beers is incredible, but the downside seems to be that it's too big for the staff to manage.  It also took about forever to get our beers--we got them well after the entrees had been served, though it was nice of the waiter to apologize for the wait.   The food is just okay.  I had a burger that was decent, my wife had a good pulled pork sandwich, our friend had pasta alfredo that was vey average, and the kids had mac and cheese that is literally Kraft out of the box.   My bottom line is that Marin already has two of the best brewpubs in the Bay Area--Marin Brewing Company and Moylans.  There's no reason for us to go back to this place at all.  The food and beer and service are better at MBC and Moylans, so we'll keep going there."
Eric L.,"Novato, CA",418,428,455,4.0,11/5/2009,"This BJ's just opened up this week, and I got to give it a whirl.  The interior is really nice, something about the setup reminded me a lot of the Cheesecake Factory.  Maybe they use the same designers. Anyhow, this location seems to be a good spot to grab a small lunch, they have a lunch menu with a bunch of affordable options.  Though be warned, I felt the lunch portions looked a little underwhelming. I went with a Breaded Chicken Parmesan that ran about 12 bucks, but made me feel totally stuffed.  I'm going to have to head back and ""diligently"" sample their beers which I hear are very good.  I saw they have a stout that is 7 or 8 % alcohol which interests me greatly. For desert, we tried their Pizookie; (Pizza/Cookie?) basically a big freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top.   We had a sampler that had 3 different kinds of cookies, each with a scoop of ice cream on top, they were all fantastic.    When we visited, it was only their 2nd day of business.  So I think the servers still have a few rough edges to iron out.  But they were extremely attentive, and I felt we got really good service."
Mellie S.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,5,2.0,5/24/2015,"Terrible service! Bad, bad, bad. Sat for about 15 min before we were acknowledged. Our waitress looked unhappy. Order a small pizza and the shrimp scampi pasta and they charged us 5 dollars more then what it said on the menu."
Marcus K.,"San Francisco, CA",640,1076,1897,4.0,11/14/2009,"Waaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttttttttt­tttt!   That's what you gotta be prepared for on a Friday night if you don't call ahead.  Two of us arrived at 6:30 and they said it would be an hour wait.  Fortunately we werent starving or we woulda headed next door to chipotle.  Instead we hung out at the bar where we met crazy woman and tried some really good koelsch (ok..still not as good as Tiburon Blonde at Marin Brewing but really good nonetheless).   We finally got seated ordered our food and again had to Waaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttt about 45 minutes before it finally arrived.  Not sure what happened but they were super appologetic.  The chicken parmesan was very good.   For desert we had the brownie sunday which is amazing!!!!!!!   Excellent chocolate sauce and brownie!    So despite the Waaaaaaiiiiiiiiiittttttt and mix up in the order which I did not mention since they corrected it quickly and comped us, I give em four stars because the food was good, ambiance nice, we werent in a hurry any way, and crazy lady at the bar was entertaining."
Kathy J.,"San Rafael, CA",20,91,3,1.0,4/9/2014,Can't believe they are still in business and with horrible reviews nothing has changed. I see Tiffany's comments on the bad reviews but her time would be better spent figuring out why nothing changes.  Service is slow and food cold most of the time. Many other options in the area.
Rebecca E.,"Corte Madera, CA",48,10,2,2.0,6/23/2015,"The service is TERRIBLE, the only reason I'm giving more than 1 star is because the food is delicious; it's what keeps me coming back. Without fail, every time we go to BJ's, whether they are dead or packed, the servers take a long time to even address you and bring water. Then they food takes at least 45 minutes to come out after you place order with the server even if it's a salad. The worst part is they don't know how to treat their customers. The wait staff seems annoyed and uptight, again, every time we go, no matter who we see. One time my brother checked in about why his side cesar salad never made it out but mine had (they should have came together, not him having to check in 15 minutes after mine arrived), and the server had the audacity to tell him she's not responsible for bringing out the food, the runner is!!! OMG woman, you are our server! You are the one who is supposed to make sure we have what we need! Then another time, all the adult meals came out but the kids meals didn't show up until 8 minutes later. Anybody who has worked in a restaurant knows kids meals always come out first, feed the little monsters, their hungry! How hard is it to make a grilled cheese! Seriously, this place always messes up orders, has rude servers (not so much the hostess's), whines and gruffs when you remind them you need a drink refill, water refill or something was messed up on the order. BJ's needs to teach their servers etiquette 101. Only reason my family and I go back is for the food. The cooks do a great job! My tips (or lack their of) reflect how a server performs. I have left a penny here before. But I have also been known to leave to 30%-40% tip (at other places, of course)."
Anne H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/3/2014,"Good food & cocktails are great! Service is beyond pathetic. Very lame. They are challenged by cleaning tables, seats & bathroom. After waiting about 15 minutes the waiter attempts to clean table/booth seats but smears fries and food into seat and continues cleaning table with same dirty rag. When I mentioned the fries on the seat still he just did the same thing. I had to take a napkin to wipe up the crumbs. No one apologized for forgetting order etc. I could go on but why bother. CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING IS NEEDED BY AN EXPERT...NOT THE MANAGERS THERE.  Last week I was there with some clients and the fries were served cold. 2 Attempts at steak and both were disgusting. Overcooked like leather the first time, 2nd time Medium-Rare but tasted like some horrible disguise for beef. Corporate...what are you thinking??? Seriously, many of us have been faithful patrons but quite frankly are tired of poor service and sometimes bad food."
Margo L.,"Novato, CA",0,21,1,1.0,3/24/2014,"Tried this place for breakfast. And ordered the breakfast pizza.  Really  disgusting and unappetizing.  Place was decorated nicely and service was great, but the food. Meh."
Robert B.,"Boise, ID",109,151,20,4.0,6/6/2014,"Standard chain style restaurant, kinda like a TGI Fridays but a bit nicer inside. Totally forgot to order a pazuki which is what they are known for but they did have some killer appetizers! The ahi poke and the corn fritter balls with a chipotle aioli were amazing and the wings were very good too. Definitely a great place to come with friends and watch the games while eating some good apps"
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",336,1141,1134,3.0,7/12/2012,The service is slow and the food is of mediocre affair.  But it's a good meeting spot for drinks and appetizers.
Wes T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",188,1314,37,4.0,12/7/2009,"This type of place, and this joint in particular, would normally only get 3 stars from me. I don't go into the overdone, modern, grandiose drinking hall. Like a bar on steriods. However, this bar is getting a 4 star review because they upped the game a bit with their brews on tap. Anyone can get all the Budweiser and Miller products, but BJ's actually has some authentic Belgian beers out of the keg, which is very welcome. They earned their fourth star for this review specifically because they have a sour beer there, which is next-to-impossible to find on tap in America. Good for you, BJ's. Beyond the beer, there's not much special taking place here. Sports bar with big TVs on the wall, kind of a vacuous crowd that seems uncomfortable in such a large and loud room. Look for lots of local Marin wanna-be knuckleheads with their Ed Hardy shirts and hoodies to glare at you from time to time."
Lars S.,"Novato, CA",62,441,708,2.0,2/1/2014,"This place tries to copy Cheesecake Factory with some of its menu items, but doesn't even come close.  The service is usually mediocre and the food mediocre at best. Did have a good server this time though.  Spend your money elsewhere!"
Mika S.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,6,3,1.0,4/29/2015,"I have to be honest here. My boyfriend and i went here tonight on a whim. First off it took about 15 minutes before anyone acknowedged us to get us drinks. Then one we placed a drinks and apps order it took another 15 minutes to get the drinks and another 15 minutes to get the apps. So if we are counting we have been siting for approx 45 minutes with no dinner. Anyway. my boyfriend and i ordered mojitos. his was a regular and tasted mostly of lime juice and mine was a strawberry and tasted mostly of rum. it was SO strong. It began to taste better as the ice melted. As as the meal progressed, our dinner finally arrives and his wonderful bacon cheese burger has hardly any cheese and little bacon but plenty of pickles and is well over cooked. and I ordered the atlantic salmon. the veggies were cooked to mush and the salmon wasn't cooked in the middle, but at least it was warm. Only the ends were actually cooked, so at least i was able to east those. We have come to BJ's a couple of times, telling eachother, maybe last time was a fluke and this time will be better. we order different things, just to be sure. and those last couple of times, we have gotten sick. I sure hope it doesn't happen again. You would think I would learn!! right?"
Dan H.,"Novato, CA",2,4,,2.0,1/9/2014,"Been here quite a few times over the past years, good food , sometimes slow service , but they always seem to get the job done. Stopped by last monday during the 49ers game, bar area was packed, looked around and plenty of tables were available, asked the hostess how long the wait would be to get a meal. she looked as us and laughed, then she told us ""You are going to be here a while"" After hearing this my wife and i looked at each other and walked out, probably never to return."
Talicia S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,13,,2.0,5/13/2013,"Fun place, good service, but pretty bad food. Two people in my party had the steak and lobster and it was really bad. It's a good place to go for a beer or desert, but if you are looking for good food this is not the place to go to :("
Hector C.,"Novato, CA",1,18,1,5.0,6/30/2014,"So far, first time at bj's, the food is excellent and tasty, drinks are really great, staff is friendly and attentive :) definitely gonna start coming for happy hour more here than applebees next door which is alrightish...."
Richard T.,"San Francisco, CA",26,41,7,3.0,3/8/2014,"I like the food and beer here, but the management isn't great. For example, it takes forever for the teenage hostesses (yes, multiple) to get you seated. Also they're constantly blaring awful music at top volume from the bar, making for a disconcerting dining experience. I can say that the wait staff, while quite young, have all been quite good, even if they only check in every 20 minutes or so. This is a good place, it just needs to work on the front desk and the bad music."
Steve L.,"San Rafael, CA",2,7,,2.0,1/14/2014,"I keep giving this place another chance, because my kids love it. But the service is spotty, at best, and usually much worse than that. The food is mediocre, pretty standard chain ""too much stuff on the menu"" fare."
becky b.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,11,,2.0,7/13/2014,"Fun place for a teen birthday dinner. The hostess and server were great.  The food is very average but could easily be better. I had a New York steak which was covered in a rub that tasted like Lawry's salt. Ugh.  It would have been fine with just salt and pepper!! And sear a bit longer. (It was on the pale side but rare ) Too much dressing on the salad. There, two easy things to fix.  Bar drinks were good and wine by the glass decent."
