Gabrielle L.,"San Francisco, CA",27,101,97,4.0,3/22/2012,"BJ's would not be a place I'd expect to like, since I'm not a huge fan of chains or restaurants in shopping centers.  Or places whose name you are embarrassed to say.  But there are a few unique things about the place that made me like it enough for 4 stars: -pazookis (warm cookie with ice cream, need I say more?) -their mini appetizers ($2.99 for a tiny tomato mozzarella salad is like a dream come true! and lots of other little bites of delicious) -their beer tasters (I went here with co-workers and we each ordered a 4-beer taster sampler, our waiter brought out a tray full of tiny glasses of beer, and it felt like a whole different event.  Also a great selection of beers to taste from!) -the ample parking and closeness to the Northgate Mall -the large projection screen behind the bar for watching sports"
Billy C.,"San Francisco, CA",173,81,38,3.0,9/24/2012,A large menu and a decent array of brews. The issue I have is that the service fails to deliver on what should be a great place to go to.
Cindi W.,"Mendocino, CA",8,792,93,3.0,2/24/2012,Not a bad gluten free pizza. I had spiced tomatoes and cheese on it. Hubby had pot stickers. Very nice. But this place is very loud.
Ashley J.,"Sacramento, CA",147,433,258,3.0,3/25/2014,"The food is fine. The same as any BJs. I like to come for happy hour, but its always so crowded. I like that you can order take out, but its never been very good. Its better to eat there. Jambalaya is good, appetizers are legit. Drinks are good. Plenty of TVs. The last time I ate here and wasn't at the bar, the place was kind of empty but they sat us by the bathroom.... #womp."
Jessica T.,"Richmond Annex, CA",27,33,,1.0,8/16/2011,"I admit from my past review, that I've been to to BJ's a few times, mainly because there are only 3 restaurants between work and home when I get off at 7pm.     Now, I'm done.  BJ's is officially on my boycotting list (welcome to the ranks of KFC, buddy).   I ordered two platters of potato skins and when i got home to Novato (15 min drive), I found there were potatoes...with hardly any topping.  Two potatoes were literally just potatoes!  I called and drove back to exchange them.  They were not apologetic, the manager didn't come out and greet me until the very end, and then gave me a courtesy card becuase quote ""I had to drive back here"".  Not because the food was badly prepared!!! I checked for sufficient cheese and bacon. I got home.  The potatoes, now with cheese and bacon, were so greased-laden and deep fried that I am 90% sure they just put new toppings on my 1-hour old potatoes. And I'm done.  Free courtesy card anybody?  I won't even eat there for free."
bill j.,"Grass Valley, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/14/2013,"Disappointing small amount of food.  Lot's of fries, not much chicken in small sandwich.  Wife's chili bowl was very MINI. No crackers initially accompanied chili, no ketchup accompanied fries.  Ten minutes later server checked on whether we had received what we needed. Have eaten at a number of BJ's over the years and have never had such poor service and such small portions.   Will never eat at a BJs again."
Rup B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,38,10,5.0,10/23/2012,Great place to eat out. I tried the Mahi Mahi entree.... Ummmmm goood! Also tried a margarita top shelf... Kinda sour.. Great after effect though ... Best part is atmosphere and the service! Love going back there.
Alex S.,"San Francisco, CA",22,40,4,5.0,5/25/2013,"This good review IS for the service and only a tiny bit for the food. Came in for a last minute dinner with my boyfriend yesterday because we were starving before seeing a movie and we both really enjoyed our experience. I'm not a huge BJ's fan but we really enjoyed our food and the service last night. Gabriel B was our server and he was great! He recommended the black and blue burger for the bf and my boyfriend said it was one of the best things he's eaten at BJ's for sure. Gabriel had great timing (made sure we were taken care of but wasn't over-attentive), was funny and gave us probably the quickest service I've ever gotten at a BJ's without making us feel like he was slammed and needed to attend to his other tables. And it was a busy Friday night! I kid you not we got our appetizer like four minutes after we ordered it and it was piping hot. Entrees were also very speedy and drinks were brought to us promptly.  My boyfriend is a server in SF and I worked in fine dining in LA so we recognize quality service when we see it. I totally understand some of the poor reviews on here about bad service so I guess it depends on the server you get. Gabriel was fantastic and we also had another stand out server (blonde, skinny girl named Joanne?) a few months back so maybe BJ's is stepping up their level of customer service. Two thumbs up!"
Julie D.,"Oakland, ME",84,1,5,2.0,7/10/2015,Service and Tomato soup were great.   Skip the lemon thyme chicken.   Not so great.  It was like getting a chicken breast floating on rice soup.
Patricko O.,"Lagunitas, CA",163,19,4,2.0,8/26/2011,"I work in corporate with Cheesecake Factory, and it is just fun to go here to see how the restuarant works.  Without trying to cause problems, the food is usually timed wrong, comes out in the wrong order, wrong items, and wrong prep.  I'm actually very laid back, and if I weren't, this place would just be impossible to go to.  Entertainment through bad service and experience? Go to BJ's. Good food and fast clean experience: even Applebees next door is better."
Maria C.,"Novato, CA",8,23,10,4.0,12/20/2013,"This was my best experience here. Alora (sp?) was great! She didn't rush us, very friendly - unlike most of the other servers I've had. Next time I come I'll be asking for her! Also, try the peach sangria - yum!!"
Lisa B.,"San Rafael, CA",42,9,4,1.0,4/22/2011,Barely edible. A parents desperate choice. Slow to seat and serve. A Haiku Review by Lisa
Emile K.,"San Rafael, CA",11,24,3,4.0,4/2/2014,Good healthy food on menu if you want it and the best beer selection in San Rafael period. It is a large chain restaurant do keep that in mind.
John B.,"Manchester, NH",262,433,1705,3.0,3/31/2010,"So this is Bj's.  Last night was my first time at Bj's. I went with a rather large group so we had a buffet. Unlimited pizza and cesar salad. I had a slice of Bj's Favorite and a slice of BBQ Chicken. That was it. Why? Because those 2 slices were soo damn heavy. I was rather hungry that night too since I didn't eat lunch. Anyway, the Bj's favorite is pretty much a combo pizza. It was alright but I would be just as happy going to costco and spending half of what I paid here for a combo. However, that BBQ chicken was beyond awesome. Melted cheese, tangy BBQ sauce, a little bit of red onion, some cilantro and some juicy chicken on a thick and buttery crust OH MAN! It is something I believe everyone should experience. My favorite part was the crust because it was buttery and had bits of burnt cheese (aka little bits of goodness). The cesar salad was just ok. For dessert, I shared a small triple chocolate pizookie with Ghiradelli. A sinfully sweet and doughy chocolate cookie with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a piece of ghiradelli chocolate on top. What's not to love?  The atmosphere was rather pleasant. The restaurant was filled with warm tones (mahogany) and TVs on sports. It was a bit dim though. The service was pretty good. The servers were always at out table and refilling out drinks/the buffet table.  In short: My first impression of Bj's was 100% positive. The pizza is extremely heavy, order the BBQ chicken but skip on Bj's favorite, great atmosphere, TRIPLE CHOCOLATE PIZOOKIE! I'll be back for sure and I recommend you stop by too."
Jasmine A.,"San Francisco, CA",263,59,38,3.0,4/21/2011,"Hello Happy Hour!  Their drink specials and discounted appetizers make me want to leave work on time.  Wait they have a late night happy hour too? Even better. When I moved up here from South Bay this place was one of the only things that reminded me of home.  I'd like the Great White Mini Pizza and Jerry-Burst (Jeremiah Red + Berry Burst Cider) please.   BJ's is one of the few restaurants in San Rafael that is open past 8pm,  caters to the sports-minded crowd with TVs everywhere and happy hours that most restaurants can't compete with.  Thank you."
Sierra A.,"San Rafael, CA",13,18,5,1.0,1/24/2011,"It's easy to be dazzled by it's convenient location and pretty decor.   Ugh, but don't fall for it!  I hadn't been in about a year, and it was pretty dismal.  But I guess the memory faded, so we tried it again. As a former waitress, i have sympathy for servers, especially the ones in corporate restaurants.  But the service today was pretty inexcusable by any standards.  we waited for a table (though the restaurant was half-empty), and even though we were the only people there, we got one of those stupid buzzer things.  As for our waiter....after an awkward scripted greeting, he messed up my order, took his sweet-ass time bringing the one thing i asked for (a side of lime), then disappeared with our credit card for over 5 minutes after we expressly told him we were in a serious hurry (since everything else had taken so long). And the food - I've had better microwave dinner.  My partner got the teriyaki salmon lunch special.  Maybe they should just call it a side of rice, because that's essentially what it was.  A small handful of salmon ""morsels"" a few limp baby carrots, and a cloyingly sweet sauce that *sort of* resembled teriyaki.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, but ended up with the fried halibut tacos.  Two tacos, each with a double-fried super-tiny fish stick that tasted like it had been cooked in old grease, and a measley little handful of cabbage/onion.  I hadn't been expecting much, but wow I was sure underwhelmed. You can bet we will not be back.  And we hope no one we like has to suffer through a meal there again either."
Jo B.,"San Francisco, CA",75,24,2,5.0,1/9/2014,"We do not have many local family friendly affordable restaurants in San Rafael and BJ's is my go to spot with my large family. Kid menus for the little ones, great burgers for the big ones, enough vegetarian items for my teens, and the bonus ability to watch my favorite football team (49er's of course) topped off with great local brew and good customer service. A perfect family outing."
William F.,"San Rafael, CA",0,40,6,4.0,5/25/2014,Good pizza. And better desserts.  Pizookies are awesome. Drinks are decent and the prices are fair.
Yael S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",14,16,,3.0,9/11/2013,"My boyfriend and I stayed in San Rafael to spend the weekend visiting Napa Valley and SF. It was pretty late and the receptionist of our hotel recommended us BJ's cause it was one of the few places that were still open. I liked the vibes of the restaurant, the distribution of the tables, big TV screens everywhere and the tall ceilings. I wasn't crazy about the quality of the food though. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and the Vegetarian pizza. It tasted good but I felt very sick the next day. Overall we had a good experience there and the service was nice."
Sandro T.,"San Francisco, CA",83,19,10,4.0,7/26/2012,"Just had lunch at the Bar. Bar Tender was nice. Had really delicious chicken quesadillas and the pazooki was great I'm so stuffed maybe next time would be better as a shared item or perhaps skip lunch all together. Love this place although the service is a bit spotty in my prior seated experiences. I'm usually watching the Giants games so whats a few minutes here and there. It's corporate, it's a chain, pretty generic with that in mind it is what it is.  I read all these reviews and hate how yelpers take this so seriously. Take it up with the manager get a refund or a second chance comped meal."
