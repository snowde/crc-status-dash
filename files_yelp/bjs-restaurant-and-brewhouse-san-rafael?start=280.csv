Jade T.,"San Francisco, CA",156,325,1069,4.0,3/2/2010,"Awwww.... no love for BJs?! Been here a number of times since it's opened.. Only once was a so-so experience, all the other times were great! I had been hearing about BJs around the bay for a while, so I was really stoked to see on the Ngate website that open was opening here.. how exciting! New restaurants at the mall! First time we came, we actually sat outside because they were having some issues with the alarm, so the emergency flashing lights kept going off (LOL). So yes, party of six, chilling outside with the heaters in December, whatssssup!!  MENU: bigger than your average menu, but smaller than Cheesecake Factory. It also sticks to mostly brew-food minus a few exceptions. Choices were never a bad thing in my book, so I don't see why having more than 10 items on a menu could be a negative thing. FOOD: Yummy! Haven't had a bad experience yet. Portions are good and the pizza is on the deep side. Don't expect to get a thin-crust organic italian pizza and you won't be disappointed. They will also split it if you can't decide on the flavors. Bj's fave and Southwestern are the best. DRINKS: plenty of choices for the bois and the girls. If you're not sure on which brew to pick, get a sampler! Their own crafted sodas are pretty yummy too.. if you're in the mood for something sweet. ATMOSPHERE: treat it like a family friendly sports bar. It can get loud at times,  but it's spacious enough that you won't feel crammed in a small room with children kicking your back. Come with good company and you will have a good time. DESSERT: Pizookie. Need we say more? Yes, I know you can make it at home if you really tried, but it's not the same. It's a gooey half-baked oversized cookie with ice cream, to share with your peeps (or not). SERVICE: We had to ask once for a soda refill, but they have always been very attentive and efficient. Food has always come to the table still hot, and we have always had one or two people check up and see how everything is.  Chain or no chain, I'm a fan. For the price ($20 pizza, 1 appetizer and 1 pizookie  fed 4 - or you can just not overeat and stick to your well-portioned entree that comes with fries/potatoes or salad) and what you're getting it's worth coming. I prefer it to a lot of the nearby restaurants when I'm in the mood for some good ol american food. Minus one star for the wait.. which we can't seem to get around no matter what time or day of the week we come :P"
Cute Dine R.,"San Rafael, CA",5,71,285,5.0,2/26/2014,"My family never gets tired eating here. They serve scrumptious food. What's this restaurant you ask? Why, it's BJ's. BJ's is the kind of restaurant that has so many dishes you'll have to go back again and again and when you do go back, you'll find something new you love. For lunch, I admire their sandwiches, from California chicken to the  pulled pork. As for dinner, pizzas always good for family and friends to share. Don't think I forgot about dessert! BJ's pizookies are the absolute best. There are tons of flavors, including red velvet, chocolate chunk, and peanut butter. All that being said, BJ's is an incredible restaurant that you must visit. cute diner blog: "
Dina B.,"Richmond, CA",0,32,,2.0,3/24/2015,"This place needs to be featured on ""restaurant impossible.""  Waitstaff-get a clue!! Jesus! Two starts for the expansive bar area. Food sucks. Might as well be an Applebee's."
Ruben M.,"Novato, CA",88,11,24,3.0,5/4/2011,"Despite the anti-Yelp sentiments at the table, lunch was divine, not what I was eating, but your guys' stuff looked delicious. And the atmosphere couldn't be better...unless a group of hot chicks came in for a lunch break from being out in the pool all day. But otherwise the beer is as expected, and the games are always on. The staff is friendly and for a chain restaurant, I couldn't complain about my wedge salad. I could however complain about the service. I asked for dressing on the side, and they must have taken that as ""dump a s**t load onto the side of the wedge so that be@ner knows he gets what he gets. You cant just cross into this country and start demanding s**t..and did you see the torn shoes he was wearing...disgraceful!"" Other than that, it was a great experience and I highly recommend BJ's for any work gathering of friends, or just to hang out with new people.  Oh btw, they STOPPED SERVERING MY CHARDONNAY SHIMP PASTA!!! ....i was disheartened..."
Marie C.,"San Rafael, CA",0,11,,3.0,5/13/2014,"I have been here a few times with my family.  It is a decent place to bring your kids since it's pretty loud already.  Most of the dishes I have had are pretty good.  I have also had a couple dishes that weren't that good.  All in all, I like that it's convenient to the mall and the service is great."
Kai M.,"San Anselmo, CA",92,14,,1.0,9/10/2014,"This is the message that I sent to BJ's corporate offices as I could not find the local manager's email address. I was completely appalled at the lack of attention from my server, Joel.  Several times, he walked past my table and asked the one across from me if they needed anything and the one next to it.  However, he did not notice that the drink that I ordered was sitting barely touched and I did not have any water, nor was I ever offered water.  When my food came out, it was brought by a runner and I had to ask her if she would send my server over.  I then asked that he take my drink back and adjust it by adding orange juice (it was too strong for me).  He did that and when he came back I asked that he take my steak back as well because I didn't expect it to be as pink as it was.  I asked for medium well, which apparently looks different depending on the establishment.  He took the food back, albeit with a bit of an annoyed look.  He advised that it would take 10-12 minutes to make it well done and I was ok with that.  The only good thing that he did was actually update me on it twice.  I went to the bathroom and my food came out and was left on the table...not a problem. But, I never saw my server again.  After a while, a woman asked if I was ok and I said that I was ready for my check.  I had wanted to get dessert but, the experience had been so poor up to this point that I decided against it.  She brought my check, I put my credit card in the folder and she did not come back.  I had to get up to go to the host station and ask that they close out my check. It is absolutely ridiculous that a server would not offer water, come back and make sure my drink was ok, my food was ok, and upon having to leave, advise that he was going home and who would continue my table service.  And, there is no reason that I should have spent so much time waiting for someone's attention in a fairly empty restaurant. In addition, when my new steak was brought out, it was obvious that they served me the same mound of potatoes that they took away with the first plate.  I had taken two bites out of that mound and that is what was brought back to me 10-12 minutes later.  They tried to camouflage it by adding additional brussel sprouts.  But, I was served lukewarm food that had sat under the hot lamps rather than a fresh scoop of potatoes and brussel sprouts along with the new steak that was also a bit warm.   Overall, a terrible experience.  Absolutely terrible!  And, some server training should be in order for Joel and any others that think this was acceptable. For the first time in my life, I was reduced to leaving absolutely no tip.  Usually, even with less than par service, I leave 10% but, in this case, I couldn't see any reason to leave even a penny. I hope that this message gets to the local manager."
Adam U.,"Tracy, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/16/2014,"Decided to stop by here because I know their beers are pretty good and I love their avocado egg rolls. The hostess sat my party outside. And when I said that I didn't want to sit outside they told me that I had asked to sit outside. So they moved us inside, and after maybe 10 minutes our waitress took our drink order and maybe after another 10 minutes I received my drink. Ordered the fish and chips and asked the food runner for malt vinegar when my food arrived. He kind of gave a weird look and walked away and when another food runner walked by, I asked him for malt vinegar too. Again, no acknowledgment just walks away. Maybe another 10 minutes goes by before I see my waitress again and I order a pale ale and ask for malt vinegar. Maybe another five minutes goes by and my waitress comes back with a different beer and says that they're out of malt vinegar."
Ashley M.,"Monterey, CA",254,216,38,2.0,12/29/2011,"The only thing that saved this place in my mind was the sweet hostess and the delightful deep dish pizza... Otherwise, the service was terrible, our appetizer came after our pizza and they're a little over priced. If u must dine here... DO have pizza, a beer sampler and save room for their famous pazookie!!"
Derek N.,"San Leandro, CA",22,174,248,4.0,12/27/2011,"Came here while Christmas shopping and was able to walk right up to the bar for beer and food. I must say the bar area is probably one of the nicest when i comes to chain restaurants. Staff was great, we had both bartenders checking in repeatedly. Try: Gourmet Five Meat Pizza with BJ's Blonde Beer"
Cake M.,"Marin County, CA",72,177,152,3.0,10/11/2010,"I desperately want to like BJ's, since it's near my work and the other choices are slim. I like table service, even during lunch hour, and I like it's cool, dark interior, but every time I go there I am consistently disappointed in one thing - the service.  Is BJ's hiring for looks rather than experience or talent? The place is filled with fresh-faced, obviously very young servers who are serviceable eye candy but DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE RESTAURANT SERVICE. I place this blame squarely on the shoulders of management - where the hell is the GM and what the hell is he or she doing????  I often have to wait 10 minutes after I've been seated (and don't think I haven't noticed how one or two women together tend to get poor seats) to be given a menu and/or place a drink order. Every server speaks from a script and that script begins with a hard sell of their handcrafted beers. I'm on a work lunch, no beer, thanks. More often than not the food takes forever, and we're talking simple entrees here - a stir-fry, sandwich & soup, pizza & salad, etc. I had lunch there the other day with my work BFF and we barely made it out of there in an hour - and our $10 appetizer arrived AFTER our entrees and no we weren't comped for it and our server only asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks AFTER we were done eating. Ridiculous.  The service staff seems to MEAN well, but most of them (with a few exceptions) seem like this is their first restaurant job and that's okay, just TRAIN them. WELL. I'm consistently disappointed and although I like the food I will only go to lunch there if I don't have an afternoon meeting and a long lunch is ok."
Matthew C.,"El Verano, CA",30,45,8,4.0,1/4/2012,"What an AWESOME place! I went there with my wife on the recommendation of a good friend and we were in for a treat! The place was packed with people waiting so I thought it'd take a while, but they gave us the little buzzy thing, and then seated us within 2 minutes. Again, I thought that since it was packed, our food would take forever, but after we ordered it was brought out in less than 10 minutes! It was extremely delicious, and the atmosphere was great too! Huge TVs on all the walls, and the largest bigscreen I have EVER seen in the middle, must have been 12 feet. I didn't come there to watch TV but it was cool.  We don't drink, but there was tons of beer brewed there, and the staff was extremely friendly and very quick to refill my soda numerous times. Overall, I was VERY impressed. We will certainly go there again when we are in the area!"
Alana C.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,19,,3.0,3/21/2014,"My daughter wanted a pizookie, it was my birthday, since its just the two of us, my fiance was out of town and hes taking me to my favorite restaurant i let her decide. The food was okay, its a brewhouse so you can expect just okay food. It felt rushed it was a weeknight nothing special going on. But to be honest its not even worth going in for dinner, i would have rathered just go in for dessert! Its okay, the staff is friendly but sometimes the servers are just rushing around so much you don't get that same vibe you do at other places.  I've been here before so i know what not to get, like there deep dish pizzas just arent that good so i tried something new, but its just okay. One of those places that are fun for hang out and beer and just okay food :)"
Elaine Y.,"Fremont, CA",33,507,5,3.0,11/11/2013,they have big portion sizes and were accommodating to the child we had with us. they didn't give us place settings/utensils til we asked them and it was nearly at the end of the meal when we were able to catch them. had the tuna poki appetizer which was well seasoned and a good amount. sliders came with 4 silders and fries. big sliders and were juicy and moist. buns were buttery and soft. cobb salad had fresh ingredients. could have gone with a little less dressing and a little more salad. i'd go back and try more stuff if i was in the area but i wouldn't neccasrily go out of my way to go just for that.
Derek C.,"Novato, CA",0,11,,2.0,10/21/2010,"The food is really great!!!  I've had the pleasure of trying Derek's meatloaf (funny. my name is Derek!!!), A really great chicken salad their house beer and coffee. The coffee is some of the best in Marin, above and beyond Starbux, Pete;'s and anywhere.  The beer was not bad, I prefer the Moylans house brews, but DID enjoy them.  The trick is to order the sampler for 6.75...you end up getting MORE beer then ordering one pint (20 ozs. vs. 12).  Derek's Meatloaf was awesome, a little less salt but tasty nonetheless.  The salad (i wish I new the name) is my fav so far.  It had chicken finger type pieces, corn, almonds, lettuce and some other stuff...YUMMY!!!!   As far as the service...yea.  Um,  ok.  It has SOOO much room for growth.  The hostess was a little cold (not personally, but like she was thinking about something outside of work...leave it at the door girl!)  The servers have great attitudes, but the speed of getting our dishes is way too slow.   SO, if  you want a huge selection of menu items, Bj's is the place to go...if you are short on time, let them know or find someplace else...and the prices, they were fine..."
Joe H.,"San Francisco, CA",3,12,1,2.0,8/9/2011,"The best thing about BJs Brewhouse is the convenience.  There are plenty of decent menu items, and a full bar as well, plus it is open late.  Sadly, this is all overshadowed by its terrible service.  Many of the servers in this restaurant have terrible customer service skills.  They will forget about their tables, not returning for up to 20 minutes at a time.  As a former server, I know that the food service industry can be hectic... but there is a difference between being busy and overwhelmed, and just being sloppy, showing little interest in the profession.   In one experience, after ordering a pizza, my server argued with me when it came out with the wrong toppings.  She blamed the cooks, but then after looking at her notepad, realized she punched in the order incorrectly.  Rather than apologizing, she said that I would have to wait 20 minutes for a new pizza, and should just eat the incorrectly ordered pizza instead.  I told her that we were in a time constraint, and we just needed the bill.  After receiving the bill, I noticed she charged me for the incorrect pizza! I told her it was outrageous, especially since I didn't even eat it.  She argued with me again, saying that I was ""provided with food.""   The above was by far the worst restaurant incident I have ever experienced.  To be fair, I have been there before when the servers were friendly and attentive... unfortunately this is few and far between.  The food itself is decent, but not much better than Applebee's Restaurant.  I recommend the clam chowder and their various pizookies. This is a good place to go if you want to try a good cream soda and or want to have an after hours drink with friends... just as long as you don't mind shouting over the loud Top 40s music."
Nancy M.,"Petaluma, CA",22,3,,1.0,3/1/2015,"Worst French Dip ever!! A couple of pieces of tough, grey roast beef on a bun. Beautiful restaurant, mediocre food...."
Donna S.,"Roseville, CA",623,709,1055,3.0,9/27/2013,"This was my first time here or any bJ brewhouse. I am not a big beer drinker. The menu is ver extensive with game day type food. Salty fatty stuff mostly that would make one want to drink even more. It;s just not my favorite type of food. i know its typical American type gooey, cheesey eat em up fare.I wish they had more interesting options. It was a challenge to eat healthy here. Some items sound healthy and may even look that way in the pics, but look again.  I did find a good salad however.But thats about it. The layout is pretty cool. Comfortable booths. The flat panel tvs on the wall should be bigger however. More like the one behind the bar. It is difficult to watch sports from some of the seating . The servers here all seemed very nice and well trained. I think they need to update their menu. Bring in some California fresh cusine."
Lauren W.,"San Rafael, CA",69,92,65,4.0,9/23/2013,"After reading reviews of this place, I was skeptical about going here.  I am not sure what all the negative reviews were about.  This place was great!!! Our waiter, Jeff, was stellar.  Having food allergies, I can be a real pain to take an order from.  Not only did he do it with a smile, but he stayed cool and calm through all my questions and food modifications.  The service was fantastic!!! The food was even better!  The spinach artichoke dip was probably the best I have had since I moved to the west coast.  It wasn't too salty and it was creamy and cheesy, just the way I like it!  I might order that as my meal next time.  I ordered a loaded potato and the Mac n cheese small plate for my meal.  I can't say enough good things about the food. Everything was so good! I will definitely be back!"
Krista H.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,21,,2.0,6/17/2010,"First I'd like to address Raider J: The ""haters"" have a reason for hating on this place.  Service is slow slow slow slow.  I've eaten at this location at least 10 times and only *once* has my food come in a reasonable time.  The servers *never* deliver my appetizer pizza the way it's requested.  Something *always* goes wrong at this BJ's location.  I ate here twice during lunch hour and it took almost an hour to get our food.  My husband has spoken with the GM on at least 2 occasions on how slow the service is, yet it's not improved. So, hater, yes I am.  They really need to improve on food turn around time and greeting time.  Sitting at a table 10 minutes before you're greeted is unacceptable (trust me, I used to wait tables so I'm speaking from experience on my entire write-up).   Good things going for BJ's (which is why I gave them 2 stars) are their wings and tv selection."
Christine N.,"Terra Linda, CA",0,10,,4.0,2/4/2012,"Pizookie!!!  If you don't know what that is, you are not ordering the right thing off the menu here.  It is like heaven on my fork! Staff is friendly, though a bit overworked.  Decor and high ceilings are nice.  Good beer selection.  I recommend the porter!  Lots of TV screens tuned to sports for The Guys you know.  Food reminds me of a scaled down Cheesecake Factory, but still good.  Pizza's are tasty and you must try the deep dish."
