Gary F.,"San Rafael, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/7/2013,Poor customer training.  This place has gone downhill since the grand opening. Look at the Trend data.
Susan D.,"San Rafael, CA",9,23,,3.0,4/17/2013,"I think this is one of the only chain restaurants I've ever admitted liking. The fare is tasty and comes out fast. The waitstaff used to better, not sure whats up with that. If you hand people a six page menu they might need more then three seconds to decided what to eat. A good place for filling up and watching a game. Not a good place to converse and linger with friends."
Reena R.,"Corte Madera, CA",53,163,26,3.0,8/27/2011,"I've had better... I've had worse. Staff is always friendly. Plenty of room (never had a terribly long wait).  I've been here four times - all for lunches. It wasn't until the 4th trip I tried something I liked! Not that the other lunches were awful or anything, they just felt so unhealthy - like junk food. Sandwich bread tasted buttered and fried, noticed a bunch of stuff with bacon, you get the point.  Last visit, I had the fish tacos - and though they were fried (you guessed it), they tasted pretty good! If I end up here for a work luncheon again, these will be my go-to for sure. Probably not a place I'll go to outside of work meetings, though. Far better options in Marin."
Raider J.,"Marin County, CA",378,647,,5.0,5/29/2010,"I just don't understand the haters of BJ's. I just came back from another great meal.  WE had the avocado egg rolls, chicken parmigana, cuban burger and fish tacos. The egg rolls are super yummy, the cuban burger is still one of the best burgers that I have ever had, the chicken parmigana was a bit spicy but super tasty and the fish tacos were good but nothing special. We sat down at a bar atble around 6.......thank goodness, because after we sat, a huge crowd arrived and all the tables were taken. In and out in one hr......the service was fast and very friendly. The huge tv screens were showing the Giants game, A's game and the NBA playoffs.....super cool! I just love this place...... Great food, trendy, cool and clean restauarnt. For all you haters out there...........go figure?? BJ's rocks!"
M P.,"San Anselmo, CA",0,11,,1.0,7/28/2014,"Terrible terrible service.  Went for lunch with work friends.  Waitress was the most inattentive waitress I have ever experienced.  All the other tables that arrived after us got their food way before ours, I tried to get her attention several times and was ignored, the only thing she said to us was ""can i take your order.""  Never checked on us to see how our food was or if we needed anything else.  Had to ask for our check.  Was just a terrible experience.  I will spend my money somewhere else next time."
Pier Y.,"San Rafael, CA",4,13,,2.0,12/14/2014,Food is average at best service is even worse the only good thing about it the bar area .
HOLLY P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",9,138,61,1.0,7/5/2011,"What is wrong with me?  Have I not learned my lesson the first time, oh wait, two times?  Still bad and the service really just sucks!  You know, the menu and the ambience is so similar to the Cheesecake Factory, but the CF is sooooo much better in every respect."
Jessica P.,"San Francisco, CA",7,21,2,2.0,10/8/2010,"I work nearby, so I've been in quite frequently for lunch. I like the half sandwich and fries with choice of soup or salad lunch special. I usually get the California Chicken Sandwich, which is pretty good considering the price.  The bartender is always friendly and greets me immediately, but my order has had mistakes on more than one occasion (could be her ringing it in wrong or the food runner not checking the ticket properly). I always ask for the salad dressing on the side and it's always brought to me on top. I always ask for a side of dipping sauce for the fries and more often than not I have to ask for it again after my food arrives. I've also only received a refill on my ""free refill"" drink order once.  I keep going back, so it's obviously not awful...but I definitely have had better. They had a bartender...I believe his name was Thadeus...that worked there in the beginning and I really hope they bring him back. He was completely on top of everything and really made the service 110% better than it is now.  I do really like how there's numerous TVs spread all throughout the restaurant for easy sports viewing for all."
Liesl D.,"Atlanta, GA",31,52,6,3.0,12/3/2010,"I'm a fan of BJ's in general so I already have my favorites which are the open face chili cheeseburger (not on the menu anymore, but they'll make it) and the giant chicken potato with broccoli and alfredo sauce. The pazookie makes a great desert. Obviously this is great comfort food. I had a late lunch and the service was fine. Curiously, even though there were plenty of tables available, I was asked to wait about 5 minutes for a table to open up. Whatever, I'm not blind. A little more finesse would serve this place better."
Johnson N.,"Los Angeles, CA",219,377,258,2.0,3/31/2010,"Keeping this short and (not-so) sweet.  Here go the bullet points: -Beautiful atmosphere -Big TV's, great for game nights (playoffs, anyone?) -15 minutes to serve draft beer -Chicken Fettucini Alfredo was bland, chicken was rubber dry, sauce dried up fast I had a good time here purely because I was with friends.  The waitress was nice, but I see no justification in taking 15 mins to serve draft beers.  My Blondie took 15 mins, and my friend's Blondie took another 15 mins.  Seriously?  How long does it take to pull a tab and let liquid flow into a cup? Of all the BJ's I've ever been to, which by now is something 5, this was by far the worst one.   The service and structure are what give this establishment its 2nd Star.  If I were to ever come back, which is doubtful, I'd probably sit AT the bar for drinks only."
Emilia N.,"Sonoma, CA",32,91,4,4.0,6/17/2013,"I wrote a review about BJ's 2 yrs ago. I still feel the same way. I love the calamari. The servers are a hit or miss type of thing. I love the pazookie. They seemed to have stepped it up since I wrote my last review. The portions on my plate were enough for 2 extra meals for me, that's alright at least I had dinner and lunch already paid for...haha!!!! Still in lve with their coffee."
Donald Y.,"Norwalk, IA",12,255,13,4.0,5/16/2011,I don't understand where all the negativity is coming from.  I've been staying at a hotel near the restaurant and have visited it every night I was here.  The house brewed beers are decent and if you don't like them they have another 20 or so other micros and imports on tap.  I also didn't find anything wrong with the service either.  Maybe it's because we have been visiting after peak hours but I never had a problem with the service.  I thought the joint was really nice looking and you can't beat the multi-screen TV behind the bar for watching games.  We don't have any of these in Iowa but I would certainly visit one often if they brought one there.
TL V.,"San Rafael, CA",45,24,6,4.0,5/25/2010,"Service is still a bit slow as earlier reviews indicate, but the servers themselves were smiling, polite, friendly, attentive, and came by often. It was the kitchen that seemed to be holding them up.  Food is a huge menu of pub/American bistro fare, with Asian and Mexican choices. Their house brews are pretty good. We had poke with wonton chips (needed a bit more dressing/spice), tomato bisque with half the grilled ham-cheese sandwich (Sis said soup was warm, not hot); veggie baked potato and salad (Mom loved it); grilled chicken club with wedge salad (they put sugar in their blue cheese dressing, which is odd) and their ""thin crispy fries"" (which taste like they cook them in the same vat as chicken fingers). Having nitpicked all that, the food really was pretty good. Decor is beautiful and atmosphere good; a very comfortable and pleasing place to be. And the prices are really cheap for this area. We're all planning to go back."
Katy A.,"San Francisco, CA",346,228,41,1.0,3/8/2010,"I'll never come back for the following reasons.... 1 - We were a party of 6 and were crammed into a four person booth. THREE of the 6 people were men over six feet tall. I couldn't move my arms. Seriously. 2 - We waited a really long time for pretty much EVERYTHING except getting into our small table. 3 - When our food came - literally over a half hour later after ordering it was clear it had been sitting out for a very long time. My sisters pasta was so old that the sauce had sunk to the bottom of the dish. The ""sauce"" that was so nicely ""plated"" with my salad was ROCK hard...no joke...I couldn't use my elbow grease to get it off my plate because I had no elbow room. My mom's salad had seriously wilted lettuce. I was discussed and didn't want to eat it - but also didn't want to be rude and not eat...and then...I was starving because we had been stuck there for so long. 4 - The waiter NEVER came to check on us for extra drinks. 5 - the place was so noisy that my Grandpa had a hard time hearing all of us. Could have been the seriously high ceilings? 6 - Even trying to pay took FOREVER.  7 - We were served AFTER other tables that had gotten there sometime after we were squished into that booth. We tried to flag our waiter down...no joke...he looked RIGHT at me...and turned the other way. I had to unfold myself out of the booth when we were finished. I wished I could have gotten up and spoken to the manager myself. I would have really given him a piece of my mind.  The ONLY reason I gave this place a single star is because I couldn't give it a zero. Disgusting.  Could the beer be the only good thing about this place? I wouldn't know because i didn't have any...and will choose ANYWHERE else over this place in the future."
Desire R.,"Novato, CA",6,96,11,3.0,8/4/2013,"Good food poor service, server was having a bad day or something. Wasn't paying attention and would just walk away when I kept needing more stuff like sauce or more napkins or water."
Donald M.,"Novato, CA",14,173,1,2.0,4/1/2013,Gut bomb. Poor service. Lots of people standing around. Took an hour and fifteen to eat dinner
Dorian S.,"San Jose, CA",26,49,7,1.0,9/23/2012,"Went to BJ's on Saturday 9/22 5pm for dinner with my son. We experienced the worst service I've seen in years and walked out before our order was even taken.  - A 5 to 10 minute wait turned into 20 minutes because host put our party of 2 down as a party of 4. (I had to ask because staff was sitting parties of 2 who just walked in). - We sat outside, on the shady side, sat for another 10 minutes while staff after staff walked by without offering drinks, silverware or heaven forbid our order.  - Asked the waitress who just took the order at the next table, if she could take our order.  Her response ""I'll send someone out to your table"".  After more idle time and  the next BJ staff member walked by....we put down our menus and walked out.   - There were a lot of open seats so I suspect they might have been short staffed but  30+ minutes in total and not even a glass of water.   Not worth the wasted time."
Alexandria K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,56,5,2.0,4/30/2014,"I have been holding this in for some time now but something has to be said. I'll start with the service. Everyone from the hosts to the servers are just plain rude. waitresses in the bar area are especially rude whenever we come in. Everyone acts like they hate their jobs and have something better to do. Everyone is on their cell phones or chatting instead of checking back or refilling drinks. The food takes forever and so do the drinks- even if it's just water. Then we have the food. The soups and salads are the only consistent thing. Everything else is truly hit or miss. Sometimes it's awesome and sometimes it's really bad and again, takes almost an hour on a Saturday night?! Get it together. Then we have management. On the one occasion a manager had to come to our table because a friend of ours asked to speak with them after being brought the food prepared wrong twice, she was so unbelievably rude. Rolling her eyes, huffing and puffing, seeming like we were inconveniencing her. She then walked over to her staff and we were within earshot sitting close by and she just starts yelling at them. It was a big turnoff... The only good thing Is the bartenders who are usually very nice and give excellent service. Spacious restaurant and nice decor but our business at this location is done. It's weird because we have been to BJs all over the country and even in the Bay Area and they are much better in all areas than this one."
Andrey P.,"Bel Marin Keys, CA",186,188,32,4.0,5/10/2013,Just got spot with consistant brewery food and huge selection of beer. The menu is not a menu its a book!
Ellie And Stephen J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/14/2012,"This was the first time I've been to BJ's....it's also the last. The Cobb Salad was a plate of small pieces of shredded lettuce with a ""hide and seek"" game for the cheese, tomato and bacon...bits so small they were hard to find.Adding insult to injury the ranch dressing was so watered down it was tasteless. The ice tea was also watered down and had no discernible tea taste. I felt sorry for the waitress who did her best to serve us...the kitchen did not cooperate.   This restaurant  has great pictures in its menu but the kitchen hasn't seen them yet!!!!"
