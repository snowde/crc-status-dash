Sandra P.,"San Francisco, CA",440,744,2583,4.0,3/14/2011,I went back again for dinner last night and it was terrific!!  The Manager really made positive changes since my bad experience.  The salad I had was fantastic and the pizza my friend had was great as well.  The waitstaff was attentive to us and the hostesses at the door were schooled in being a hostess!  GREAT!!!!!
Tony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,,2.0,2/4/2010,"I love a beer with my burger. If only it had arrived. Second visit. Booth. Nice interior even if it does scream ""chain"". But the service is way off par. Each server talks as if they are reading from a cue card. OK, so BJ's is hiring new people and training. I can live with that if folks are getting jobs. But a 30 minute wait for a beer? Then when it came it was the wrong beer. Then another 15 minutes. By this time I had shared half my wife's beer and eaten my burger. The server told us the problem was only one bartender. The bartender must also have been training because there were very few people eating (late lunch) and about 10 at the bar. How long does it take to pull a beer? Lots of waitstaff standing around doing sod all. Perhaps they can train to pour some beers to help out. The burger was ok - not fabulous but would be alright with a beer. I guess."
M D.,"Novato, CA",3,22,,2.0,8/16/2013,"Typical bar food, nothing special but not bad.  The low rating is for service.  We went with a group of 8 and it took over an hour to get our food and then... another hour to get our desert.   Waitress was nice when se came to the table, but she was really busy and as a result scattered.  The kitchen was disorganized.  There is no reason to wait this long to get food or have you staff running around as if their heads were chopped off."
Jennifer T.,"Pleasanton, CA",16,41,25,4.0,1/24/2013,"I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner, but definitely great for lunch. The reason why I don't like it for dinner is because it's a little expensive. With the price being paid, I think cheesecake factory tastes a lot better. But for lunch... It's amazing! You get a good amount of food for the price and their lunch menu is absolutely delish! All the waiters and waitresses I had were all wonderful!"
Stefan N.,"Novato, CA",4,7,,1.0,12/20/2009,"I've never been to a BJ's before and, after today, can't really see myself ever going back. Our waitress served us our drinks, took our meal orders and then disappeared until it was time for our check.  No offers to refill drinks (isn't that the money maker?) and really never stopped by again.  All food and drinks brought out by other staff.  And there was a ton of people working there. Their ""award winning"" Jeremiah Amber was a pretty craptastic beer.  A decent nose, no body and a watery finish.  It was like drinking a Sam Adams that had been watered down.   The food was mediocre at best.  I had the pot roast sandwich which should have been good.  Open faced sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy with pot roast and veggies.  The veggies were raw, the meat was sparse and the gravy's prime ingredient appeared to be salt. My wife liked her burger but the fries tasted like they had been dug out of week old grease. If you're looking for a good brew pub, with good food and beer, go to Moylan's or Marin Brewing Company.  BJ's is just another Applebee's with crap service and bad beer."
J M.,"San Anselmo, CA",0,32,2,1.0,12/22/2009,"Worst...BJ...EVER  Called ahead at 8 pm to get a seat at 8:30. 3 people...  We were seated immediately and our drinks order taken. The place is so loud the waiter couldn't tell that we were discussing drinks orders and brought us 4 drinks. Luckily, our happy drinker liked both.  We ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer when we got our drinks.  15 minutes later we called the waitress over to order our main course. We thought we would add in the avocado rolls too.  15 minutes later we called the waitress over to cancel the spinach dip, reckoning that the rest of the meal was coming. She and the manager told us the chips were being cooked. We cancelled anyway and were promised a free dessert.  And then, we waited and waited and waited and waited. 20 minutes before we got our food.  My veggie burger came on wheat instead of sourdough, the waitress noticed immediately, I didn't care. They grabbed it and came back immediately with the sourdough version. Except...it was turkey. I've been a vegetarian for 20 years...And the fries were warmish. I told the waitress...  Twenty minutes later, after the rest of the party had wrapped up their food, I finally go my veggie burger. Over an hour since ordering.  We had a dessert. While I was eating my veggie (not turkey) burger.  The waitress was leaving and brought over her replacement. We got the check. Put our credit card on the bill. She walked by twice. Then she stopped coming by. Then she did and I waved. But, she must have studied hard in the school of ignoring people to attain expert level. She was a Jedi Master of ignoring customers. A PHD in ignoring the punter. The President and CEO of Ignoring Customers for Fun and Profit.  The place isn't even that busy at 10...  We scraped up cash and left. Hanging around almost 20 minutes to pay the bill....  Positives:  Avocado rolls are disgustingly good.  Cookie dessert is nice.  The first waitress was very nice. Probably the first day of her first job.  I didn't have to pay for the turkey.  The dessert was free.  I don't know what was happening in the kitchen, but I somehow don't think there's a brilliant yet temperamental chef there whose ""slow roasting"" special chip making recipe is world famous. I don't think it should take 30 minutes to slap together a veggie burger.  So BJs....the manager was nice, the first waitress was sweet. The food took hours to prepare. We got the wrong food. Both waitresses seemed new to the job, but the second one forgot that one tiny little task is to check in to see if the customer wants something or wants to pay.  One final tip. Don't offer a veggie burger if you can't get it right. It's not like I kinda don't like turkey and a mistake just means 20 minutes to wait while the rest of the party wraps up their meal...  One of our party has been to BJs in other locations and pointed out that they're not normally that terrible and it normally takes much much less than 2 1/2 hours to have a meal that includes a few of the items you ordered."
Bob G.,"San Rafael, CA",89,155,76,2.0,12/3/2009,"Northgate Mall needs help and BeeJaze does just that.   The food is average;  not close to high quality.  Read the other reviews on that one.  Beer selection is great but if you do not sit at the bar, you will wait 15 minutes or MORE for a beer!  I'm not a big beer drinker, but I do know this is just unacceptable for one who drinks beer.  It is even borderline... evil.  Huge place.  One large room.  TV screens all over.  My first visit was a Sunday night football game (Pats vs Colts - a painful ending)  so I made sure not to write a review that night.   But you cannot hear the game due to Bee Jays being one large room.   My second visit was to concentrate on the food knowing my surroundings.  The menu is so big it is confusing and you might need a nap after reading the 24 page document.  Instead of listing all that we had with corresponding grades,  I wish to be lazy and 'borrow"" the best descriptive line from Jackie M.'s review: ""This is totally a generic Cheesecake Factory"""
Chad O.,"Phoenix, AZ",77,52,7,2.0,4/19/2013,"Cold beer, good service, but snooty Marin beer options and average food for insane prices. Not quite an avoid, but I'm in no hurry to return."
Edward C.,"Glendale, AZ",0,7,,1.0,9/29/2011,"I like this type of restaurant. Reasonably good beer, nice atmosphere, cheap bar food. But this particular BJ's is not run well. I have been there 5 times in the past two months and every time, the service has been shoddy and the food was either cold, wrong or late.  I recommend going to one of the many other restaurants in the shopping center than this BJ's."
B H.,"Bend, OR",0,53,3,2.0,1/28/2010,"A few highlights:  1. Good in-house beer, and great selections on tap (eg, Drake's IPA, mmm . . .)  2. Convivial atmosphere: high ceilings, attractive bar and decor.  3. Kid-friendly, with ample background noise to drown out your screaming toddler.  With a few changes, BJ's could easily be four stars. Here's why it's not:  1. Mediocre service. I've been there a few times, and water glasses are typically forgotten and our beers run dry for way too long. Tsk, tsk,  2. Inconsistent food. My husband loved his burger, but my house salad was pathetic: iceberg with shredded carrots and a smattering of dry cucumber and tomato. OK, if you're in Kansas, but not acceptable in NorCal, where it's more difficult to make a crappy salad than a great one.  3. Happy hour in the BAR ONLY. What a dirty policy! Parents want (and need!) a beer more than any twentysomething single, and we have less $$ to buy it, because kids are 'spensive.  C'mon, BJ's, help a customer out . . . I want to like you."
Paul K.,"San Bruno, CA",0,19,,5.0,1/12/2011,"The food is really excellent.  That I guess is why it is always crowded. The service is, well, dependent upon who is serving. I sometimes get excellent servers and sometimes soso servers. The price is very fair. I recommend highly."
Lola K.,"San Rafael, CA",11,38,,4.0,6/4/2010,"OVERALL:  Great for groups (well, my group!!)  but we don't go at peak hours.  BJ's easily accommodates our 4-adult, 2-kid group (2 well-behaved children)   A bit noisier than I like, but they have a nice outdoor area.  Thumbs up for being a place we can come with someone in a wheelchair and still be treated well. FOOD:  My friends adore fried calamari & french fries, both of which they have in abundance.   Ribs excellent and the 4 year old complimented the mac-and-cheese--that was cool!    Fish tacos are just okay, not memorable. SERVICE:  The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive, even when we've been needing a little extra attention.     DRINK:  Beer novice here couldn't decide which beer to order.  So the nice waitress suggested their beer taster!   I tried 4 beer samplers (fair sized)  and learned I like 'em malty, not hoppy.  (Who knew?  Not me!)   Really interesting beers, nice experience."
Kristel R.,"Novato, CA",2,12,8,1.0,1/22/2014,"I came in with my fiancé at 9:45pm it was decently busy considering it was a tuesday night (I'm a server so I understand)... waited at the front...waited about 10-15 min just to be greeted... This group of 4 construction guys came in and they got seated before us... The minute they walked in. It looked like the manager that sat us while the ditsy girl that knew we were there before the guys sat them... So I let the manager know our experience. He apologized and I thought ok we'll eat and all will be fine... Nope. We waited another 15 min for our server to come over who I will say was really nice good personality and all but took a while to get waters then after about 15 min he came over to inform us that what we wanted was actually out and worked something else for us. Still waiting... It's now 10:30 we look back at the 4 guys who got sat and they were mowing down on their food... We left... went to in n out... BOMB, fast, happy/great service :)...won't b back to say the least...!"
Peter R.,"San Rafael, CA",0,17,,2.0,11/4/2014,I used to stop off to meet friends here for a beer after work on a quite regular basis. There used to a woman who was ALWAYS there drinking wine. Not really a problem right except she had her young daughter sitting at the bar with her. The girl was perhaps 8 or 9 and sitting at the bar because according to the management was allowed since they served food at the bar. The woman was a lush and after perhaps three hours of drinking would leave and get in her car and drive her and her daughter home. I complained strongly to both the management and even contacted the executive offices of BJ's about this unsavory situation. The bartenders at the time all felt awkward serving her but nothing apparently was done about it.
Monica B.,"Marin County, CA",19,192,,5.0,11/4/2009,"VICTORY IS MINE! WE FINALLY HAVE A BJs IN MARIN! Somehow, I feel like the ""awesome food business"" fairy has descended upon Marin.  Went for the pre-opening training session, and was delighted with the new restaurant.  I'm a huge fan of the chain, and think that this one has the nicest layout I've encountered yet! Even in ""training"" mode, the wait staff was 100% on it.  Super attentive (but not too much so) very clear, understood the menu, answered our questions, and served everything promptly with a smile.  And the food? Fantastic. As always.  Again, even in ""training"" mode, the kitchen staff nailed it. And really-who can turn down a pizookie. ESPECIALLY a free pizookie during their pre-opening.   All in all, the free meal was one of the best days ever.  And I'm already planning to have my birthday party here!"
Ben K.,"Richmond, CA",41,34,2,3.0,11/9/2009,"SECOND EDIT:  We only received a $20 certificate; less than half of what our meal cost.  Minus one star. EDIT:  We called the management and they're reimbursing us for this experience.  This review was going to be two stars, but because of excellent damage control by Eric the manager, it's bumped up to 4.  This updated review is still included, because it's a problem with new restaurants. -- Today is my girlfriend's birthday, and we went to our favorite restaurant in the area with her parents.  Now, we're not the easiest group to get along with, admittedly, but to start off I have to say we were behaving like model foodies when the floodgates of grump opened. From the beginning there was just a sense of us customers being in the way; since one of our party is disabled, we asked to sit at a table instead of a booth, and the hostess seemed as if we were inconveniencing her.  One loop around the section, however, and we sat in one of the many open tables. Our server was a trainee, so we cut her some slack, but 5 minutes later, we were taken over by another server, who was a little better... but 10 minutes after that, we were taken over by another server!  Granted, this last one was a pro, but it still was pretty weird.  Of course, because of this, our orders were messed up; two of our party members didn't get their sides, when we did get our food nearly an hour after we ordered.   Step up your game, BJ's."
Jim K.,"Novato, CA",7,45,,1.0,1/9/2014,"I'm not sure what's happened to this place. I've eaten here a couple dozen times since they opened and ordered take out at least a dozen times and always had good meals and good service (once we had a large party and the service was terrible). However, I've been out of town for 6 months and I have no idea what happened here in that time but the food is absolutely awful.  First off, the menu changed and all of my regular favorites were gone...pot roast, meat loaf, sweet potato fries. I was persuaded to try the chicken pasta with cream sauce and it was just nasty...I've had much better meals at Denny's. The Chicken was burnt and the sauce...yuk, yuk, yuk...definitely not home made...came straight out of a bag or can and into a microwave. The friend I was with had a NY steak (because her fav was gone too) and the steak was tough and had a lot of fat. I've seen the negative reviews for the service here but in the past I always seemed to get good service. Many times I've left $20 tips for a $50 or $60 meal because the service was great. But this time we had a kid helping us that had absolutely no clue what he was doing. The place wasn't very busy and I had to ask him twice for the wine. And I knew the menu better than he did. Anyway, I chalked this up to one bad day, and that can happen anywhere. Definitely giving the place another chance. Which happened today...and now I won't ever go back.  I ordered take out...got my favorite teriyaki chicken plate with rice and veggies and an appetizer of chicken pot stickers. The sauce for the pot stickers was different...way too salty. And the chicken plate had very few veggies and chicken...mostly rice. I'd rather have had the chicken bowl they serve at Jack in the Box. Honest to God. And for the $25, I could have had 3 or 4 of them. I don't know if the management at this place reads the reviews or even cares, but I can tell you first hand the place has gone downhill...and fast. It used to be my go to place and now I will never go here again. If I ever end up here by chance, the only thing I would order is the pizza.  Whoever runs this place needs to wake up...you've lost a good customer because your food went from good to lousy. I can go to Chipotle right next door and get much better food for less than half the price."
Crystal R.,"Berlin, Germany",102,217,15,3.0,12/12/2009,"BJs, you are still by far one of the weirdest places to be on a Saturday night and I still can't believe they opened you in San Rafael.  I guess we'll always get that crazy bunch of guys who don't want to go to a dive bar to yell and scream at each other while hitting on every waitress who walks by.  It's just a given.   Because of the expansive bar area/dining terrace those who are seeking a quiet dinner... do not eat there.  Quiet is not what you'll get.  Instead opt out for a booth on the main floor along the window areas.   BJs is known for their pizza and beer.  It had been a while since I ate at one so I was still expecting that great deep dish I had over 6 months ago.  Well... that wasn't the case.  On this particular night we ordered a BBQ chicken pizza.  You've gotta love that sweet BBQ taste with chicken and cilantro.  I was expecting that, but instead I got the lovely deep dish crust without the flavor.  Sadness (*tear*). On the other hand, BJs did live up to the brewery standards we have set since we moved to the Marin area.  How do you compete with 5-6 breweries within a 20 mile radius?  Just keep serving consistently awesome beer, that's how.  My suggestions:  The Porter, the Nutty Brunette and the Jeremiah Red.  Start with the Red and finish with the Porter.  Gotta love it. For the price of food and beer, I'd say just stick with beer and appz.  The beer is what really want, food is just sloppy seconds."
Robin G.,"Sausalito, CA",439,315,19,3.0,11/14/2009,"3 Stars because in the Mall area of Northgate this is the BEST place I seen thus far. For only being open and running for a couple of weeks in my mind they got the process down.  The menu weighs a ton. It can take you at least 15 minutes or more to review so I simply gave up and just looked at what everyone else around me was ordering and picked what looked the best to me.  I had one of the lunch specials. A small Cesar salad and 1/2 of baked potato filled with chili and cheese. It was unbelievable that the the potato was only 1/2 of an order.... it was huge. $6.95. My friend had the avocado spring rolls..... she said they were divine, but i was way to full to try to even take a bite.  The vibe is cool.... A lot of TVs to watch your favorite sports. My only complaint is the music... a little loud... but such a minor complaint that it would never stop me from eating there.  From what I understand they don't really take reservations, however if you call about 45 mins before you are going to arrive they will put your name on the list which could make your overall weight shorter.  Also they are open to 1:00 am on weekends. The Northgate Mall was smoking today. I guess they reopened on Thursday and from what I saw as I walked though the mall it looks good...  ....... and Santa is there!!! Yippie..."
Mike L.,"San Rafael, CA",0,26,,1.0,1/19/2010,"The way this restaurant is run is quite perplexing. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and continue to be amazed at how archaic the seating policy is. I do not understand having people place their name with the hostess and then be forced to wait for a table when there are PLENTY of available tables. Both times I have been here this has happened and everyone around me was also in awe of being forced to wait. On both visits I counted two people at the hostess stand who were standing around and not seating guests. Once you get seated, the service is nothing to write home about. The servers know nothing about the various  beers on their menu. On one visit they got my sandwich and beer order correct and on the other screwed up my sandwich order and gave me the wrong beer.  Food is typical chain restaurant fare. They have a large menu with enough offerings (pizza, sandwiches, pasta, salads, etc.) to please almost everyone. It's not terrible, but it tastes like it came straight from the Sysco truck. Only could see going to this place again if it were for a happy hour and they do a better job training their hosts.  Food deserves 2 stars, but lackluster service and poor training leave me no choice but to give it a one star review."
