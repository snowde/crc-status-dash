Larry Y.,"San Francisco, CA",6,111,,3.0,2/15/2010,"I have only been there 2 times and both times i have had a very good dinner.Food is Very Good, but the beer is very much too my taste. From lighter beers to stout and in between, i haven't had a beer i haven't liked. I'd definitely take my beer drinking friends there!"
Jackie M.,"San Francisco, CA",28,177,15,3.0,11/16/2009,"When in Rome.   This is totally a generic Cheesecake Factory, and the prices are somewhat less, as generic things of other things tend to be. Now.  Cheesecake is yummy.  BJ's probably bought the frozen version of yummy and threw it directly from the freezer to the fryer. Ordered a few things, the portions are huge!  The beer selection is copious. Pretty cool scene for northgate I guess, a total upgrade from Applebess, which is a few doors down, can't really complain too much.   Very good service, everyone is on the ball, the servers need to try more of the food though, I asked multiple servers what there top pics were and they had no idea."
LILLI W.,"American Canyon, CA",7,89,51,5.0,1/26/2013,"My favorite BJ's so far so I am surprised with all the bad reviews here. Love the place itself...super open, tvs are visible from every seat, staff is helpful and food is always consistent and great. Love BJ's in general though, but this location is just real nice and open so I will keep going back, specially to watch games  with my husband!"
Phuong H.,"Saratoga, CA",230,258,359,4.0,12/25/2009,"I'm so glad BJ opened up in San Rafael!  Finally, there's a place that's open past 9:30 in Marin!  Anyway, I loooove the pizookie here, I would just come here for drinks and the pizookie.   My bf and I went here a few weeks ago and got the BBQ chicken pizza and chicken wings w/the 7 sampler of their beers.  The service was good since we were 1/5 tables there.  The place is huge!  Anyway, everything came out delicious and we ended our meal with an oreo cookie pizookie.  We were quite satiated after our meal."
Wayne J.,"Woodacre, CA",0,100,,3.0,8/17/2012,"First time I ate there was lunch Aug. 16, 2012. No complaints - no raves. The service was attentive enough. Large variety of food to choose from on the menu. We both had the French dip sandwich - again, it met my needs. I would have no problem eating here again. My companion liked their beer."
Jen K.,"Greenbrae, CA",34,81,4,1.0,1/10/2010,"I've been to BJ's twice since it opened.  The first time was for lunch with my daughter and it was fine. The second time was last Saturday night and it was pretty bad.  We arrived at 4:45pm for dinner and were seated within 2-3 minutes.  It took the waiter 25 minutes to take our order, which is ridiculous.  Yes, the menu is large but it doesn't take THAT long to read it.  My husband and I shared BJ's Favorite Pizza and a cobb salad.  My son had a pineapple mini pizza and my daughter had the kids Mac N Cheese.   The pizza was ok - pretty blah.  The dough could've been cooked MUCH longer, there was hardly any cheese or sauce on the pizza and the toppings were skimpy.  My husband commented ""tastes like a frozen pizza, which it probably is!"" The cobb salad was pretty disgusting - it was litereally drowning in creamy dressing and they use a very tangy feta instead of bleu cheese.  The flavor of the feta totally clashed wtih the creamy dressing.  The salad was mostly iceberg lettuce, there was VERY little bacon or avocado.   My son's pizza looked decent - loaded with toppings, nice puffy crust and nice brown color of the crust.  My daughter had 4 bites of her Mac N Cheese - the portion size was huge though the cheese looked a little coagulated. I ordered the Cookies N Cream Pizookie and it was SUCH a disappointment.  The cookie barely covered the bottom of the pan, it was RIDICULOUSLY thin - NOTHING like the thick cookie pictured in the menu.  The cookie part also tasted like it wasn't even BAKED - honestly, it was barely warm and tasted like raw cookie dough.  The ice cream was fine, and the mousse on the top had a very greasy mouthfeel.   My kids ordered the kids' sundae, which was one small scoop of ice cream, a ton of whipped cream and NO cherry, despite the description in the menu. Overall, I think the quality of the food was TERRIBLE and would not go back anytime soon."
b f.,"Larkspur, CA",0,29,,1.0,5/24/2012,"Nasty food! I was wondering if they actually have a kitchen or just a bunch of microwaves. Salad had mushy lettuce. Maybe the salad had been hanging around in the back of the fridge for a few days?  The waitress told us the sodas are brewed on site, sounded great but tasted like syrup with a few cups of added sugar in each glass. Really horrible beyond belief. No the server didn't ask if everything was ok or notice that the sodas weren't consumed by even a quarter of glass.  When we arrived for a very late lunch (around 2:15) the place was quite empty but the hostess was no where around. We waited for at least 5 minutes ---- shoulda' left then. Finally seated. Server came to announce her name and take drink orders. We had to ask what the soup of the day was. Nothing welcoming or inviting about the service, really quite horrible service. Couldn't drink the ultra sweet soda so asked for a glass of water, server didn't ask if anyone else wanted water. Water arrived with food stuff floating in it. Now I'm really starting to feel nauseous, this place is at the bottom of the pile when it comes to food, service, presentation ......  While still eating salad, the server wanted to know if we wanted to order dessert. When we told her no, she brought the check before we had even finished our entree. Do they train these people? There wasn't anyone waiting for our table, there were lots of empty tables.  Manager? Do they have one? What a disgusting experience! Even though I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, nothing made me feel good about the food there. I've had better food at much lower prices in coffee shop chains. BJs Brewhouse should be ashamed. I predict they will close soon. Maybe they should stick to beer and not serve food!"
Joel S.,"Novato, CA",0,6,,2.0,5/7/2014,"It was my wife's birthday and with the rest of the family (6 of us) we went to BJ's.  We got there about 5:30 and the place was relatively empty.  The ordering process went smoothly and in a reasonable time the food came.  Now the problem started.  Two of us had french fries with our order but the kitchen ""ran out"" of french fries.  The waitress not to worry, fries would be ready in a minute.  The minute turned to fifteen and the waitress came and told us that she would be on break and introduced us to our new server.  By this time most of us were close to finishing our entrees.  The new server said she would be right back with the fries.  She disappeared - no fries.  No one bothered to refill the water glasses.  At this point I asked to see the manager and explained the problem.  He shook things up and finally the fries arrived, about 20-25 minutes too late.  He offered a 25% reduction in the bill and a free dessert.  Sounded good.  Water was also poured. Since it was my wife's birthday, she was told that she was entitled to a free Pizookie.  She order hers and someone else ordered dessert.  After 10-12 minutes no Pizookie and no other dessert.  Alas,  no waitress.  At this point I asked for the manager and complained about this lack of service.  He stated that it takes 10 minutes to make a Pizookie.  If this was the case, we should have been told.  Having been in the chefless restaurant business I was also aware that the desserts were premade and just needed to be reheated.  I asked for the check and was told we would be comped for the meal.  While I appreciated this courtesy, I would never return to BJ's in Northgate Mall.  It certainly cast a cloud over my wife's birthday dinner. I should have read the reviews first since service seems to be the issue."
Crystal V.,"San Rafael, CA",117,137,52,3.0,1/7/2010,"OK, so I have been twice since it opened up in Northgate. They have these giant potatoes filled with veggies, so delicious but lets get to the stuff that irritated me....  First visit:  I ordered the avocado egg rolls after a recommendation from one of my customers. They were actually yummy but we waited a while for them and when our server finally brought them out he informed us they had been forgotten and left in the back under the food window. He then said he would have some fresh ones made for us but that he would leave the old ones to try. WTF? When he brought out fresh ones he brought 2 pieces, the plate was suppose to have 6. I'm not sure about the logic here....  Second visit:  My husband orders a Blue Moon wheat beer and the server brings out a beer which is obviously not Blue Moon. When we asked him to bring us the right beer he said ""well I ordered Blue Moon."" They have so much on tap I can see it as a easy mistake on the bartenders part. The server then comes back and says that the bartender tasted the beer we sent back and confirmed it was Blue Moon. My husband and I drink this beer a couple times a week, we always get it if a restaurant carries it, we know our beer. The first beer brought out tasted like a IPA not a wheat beer, the second beer tasted correct. Note to that server just get the right drink out...................."
Bruce W.,"San Rafael, CA",4,73,,5.0,11/9/2009,"Great food.  We went there before they opened for their training.  And once more the first week.  Crowded (though it must seat over 200, talk about pent up demand!), we had to wait about 15 mins for a table. My wife's salmon was fresh, step-son's burger was great and my French dip sandwich was awesome. Lots of specialty beers, but I had the 'hand-crafted' root beer, which was magnificent! Service was very good both times, even when they were packed and the door person was very nice and helpful to the handicapped (me). A good place."
Lucia P.,"San Rafael, CA",1,32,1,4.0,6/23/2011,"I love local and love this place even though its totally corporate. Their pulled pork sandwich is awesome, as are their deep dish pizzas and brewed beer.. Oh and can't forget the pizookie!  Their lunch specials are pretty rockin too.. You can get a half sandwich, loads of fries, and a cup of soup for under $8 during the week. The only reason I won't give them 5-stars is because I made the mistake of trying their new weekend brunch menu a couple weeks ago and it was absolutely disgusting. The eggs were microwaved from a carton, the French toast was still runny with egg, the ""country potatoes"" were literally deep fried tater tots, and the breakfast sandwich made me gag. It was the only time I had a bad meal there and the waitress/staff was quick to adjust the bill upon mentioning the breakfast quality.  All in all, stick to their dinner/lunch/beer and you'll be one a happy camper."
Adryenn A.,"Reno, NV",1886,193,33,3.0,5/1/2010,"The food is pretty good, decent prices, but the service is soooo slow. And we didn't hit them during peak times either. Several things to note: 1. We were seated and nobody brought us water. EVER.  Other tables got it, just not us. 2. It took over 15 minutes for the server to appear. 3. She doesn't take notes when taking orders and she should. She got important stuff wrong. 4. Nobody who has ever been trained to work in  a restaurant where children are served would have ever delivered a kids meal (where Ketchup as ordered as the veggie) and not brought the Ketchup with the meal (and usually before, just so you know its there). Kids will often not touch their food without Ketchup, so what's the point of bringing their food out if you leave off the secret sauce?  It took another 9 minutes (yes I timed her) and another polite request to get the required condiment, and then the bottle was nearly empty.  5. Complete lack of eye contact. That was kinda creepy. I saw lots and lots of kids, so clearly they know that they serve them. And their kids menu is pretty slick and jam packed with yummie choices. My meal was good. A little moister, and a touch more sauce and I would have been tempted to actually lick the plate clean instead of just eating every morsel. So give them a try. I'll try them again, and I'll observe who the rockin' servers are. Cause I picked the short straw tonight and I think the place has potential."
Aaron L.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,29,,4.0,6/12/2010,"Been here twice now.  Not sure what's not to like.... the bar is cool, with a few huge LCD screens for sports.  Big dining area to host larger lunch/dinner groups.  Excellent micro-brews on tap - check out the Piranha Pale Ale.  The only entree I've tried here was the Parmesan Crusted Chicken... I enjoyed.  They also have a great line-up of finger foods... awesome complement to the beers.  Next time, I'm gonna try one of their angus burgers.   Go to NYC for pizza.  Go to BJs for a good brew or three, tasty tid-bits and a ball game on the big screen."
Pook M.,"Berkeley, CA",12,89,3,1.0,3/1/2010,"This is a zero star review. If you have food allergies, don't expect the cooks to care and let you see the ingredients.  I went here the other night and told the server that I needed to know what was in their food before I could order anything.  She was very nice and asked the cook about the two menu items that could possibly be made for me without much trouble.  She came back saying she found the box the pizza dough came in (ew, they don't even make their own dough???) but the cook wouldn't let me read it for myself! I was handed a brochure on food allergies, but it was too generic for my needs and didn't include A SINGLE INGREDIENT.   WTF? Since my family insisted on eating at this shit hole, I opted to have a beer instead of real food.  The server completely forgot to bring me my drink and then brought me the wrong one when asked.   This place just further proves how useless chains are for acquiring a decent meal."
Robert S.,"San Rafael, CA",10,45,8,5.0,7/17/2010,"Excellent service, atmosphere and prompt service too. I chose the lunch special, teriyaki chicken and clam chowder. Great meals. Recommend coming early especially on Saturdays since it's almost empty."
Joan S.,"San Anselmo, CA",1,3,,2.0,5/23/2013,"The best thing I can say is it was pretty conveneint for a quick burger.  That is until the very end of our dining experience my 12-year-old bit into a 3 inch piece of waxed paper.  Somehow it was left on the burger during the cooking process?  Not sure how that could even happen.    Wait staff was appologetic, quick and knocked off a few bucks for the paper, so for that they get a couple of stars. Don't bother with this place...there are too many other better places to go."
zia s.,"Oakland, CA",59,64,28,4.0,8/31/2010,"I've been to Bjs a number of times since they opened up last year. Most of my times there my experience has been pleasant, but there have been a few lass-than-stellar moments. A few things I do love about Bjs include:   - their beer - their happy hour(s) - half-off wine Tuesdays - bar manager Noa For the most part,  service has been decent,  but I've never felt that it has been anything outstanding.  A simple glass of water has taken over 10 minutes several times - mainly, i believe, due to lack of communication among staff members.   A lot of times the servers seemed pissed off - like they don't want to be working there (they probably don't!) Despite the few negatives, I continue to go to Bjs regularly... Thanks guys!!"
Zoe G.,"Shasta, CA",0,21,,2.0,3/15/2011,"Ug!! Wow, I can't really see much of a positive with this place. While the beer selection was large, it was altogether unpleasant. We got the sampler and only 1 of the 4 was even descent. I'm giving it two stars because the food was OK, which I guess is really the point of yelp in the first place.  The real problem was with our waiter. Overly assertive at first, and then he seemed to forget about us. It took 15 minutes for water to arrive (after the beer even) and our orders not taken after that. When the food arrived, one of the meals in our party was incorrect. The waiter said that it would take 15 minutes to fix and acted as though it was our fault that this happened. He even had the audacity to accuse us of ordering incorrectly even though he had repeated our orders back to us when we originally placed them. He never refilled our waters and did not ask us how the meal was until we were done. When we paid (in cash) he shortchanged us! It seemed as though he was almost pre tipping himself. All in all, just not a fun place to eat.  Again, the food was OK, but the rest was just not worth it."
Becky R.,"San Rafael, CA",0,11,,3.0,7/7/2012,"First experience: I went to the bar to see the score of the Laker and get my girlfriend and myself drinks, but the bartender lady would not allow me to bring back the second drink to my table. So I had to sit there and pound 2 beers so that I could go back to my table. Second experience: girlfriend and I went back and had a male waiter who took forever to bring us water and never returned to check back on us to see how we were doing. Worst BJ's I have ever been to. Service sucks but food good. Update: I just went here again and I sat outside with my girlfriend and our puppy. The waitress, Kori, was very nice and offered our puppy lots of rubs and even brought him a bowl of water. She made our visit enjoyable and the food was great as always."
Leslie S.,"San Rafael, CA",5,31,,1.0,10/6/2011,"Ugh. This place makes me want to go home and cook a meal myself which is not what I expect when I eat out. Service is ...awkward. All the food takes forever to get to the table and I find myself rubbernecking to see if the waitstaff has left for the night. After anticipating my meal for about 40 minutes I was ready to dive in. Sadly its like swimming at the arctic circle and once you are in , all you can think about is getting out. Bland, boring, mundane flavors. The shrimp tacos were offensive in every way. (I'm sure its not the shrimp's fault) Is everything supposed to taste the same? On a positive note there are lots of beer choices. Maybe I went about dining here all wrong. Maybe I should have been pounding beer after beer during the extended wait for the food and everything would have tasted better. Sadly, if I have a choice I won't be back to see if the new approach works."
