Chris B.,"Green Brae, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/12/2010,"Unfortunately, my experience was too similar to the negatives expressed in other reviews.  Long wait for a table.  Long wait for food.  Ordered the seafood tacos - they showed up cold.  The manager, Noah, came over and apologized took the item off the bill.  Nice gesture, but the damage was already done. I've had better experiences at the Roseville restaurant.  The Blonde beer tasted way too much like Bud.   Give a majority of similar review, these folks have a real problem that needs addressing."
Duncan H.,"Napa, CA",252,159,53,4.0,7/14/2010,"It's good food. Period, and if you in need to watching a game, but don't want to go to a traditional pub/bar like everyone else. This place will offer you the awesome selection of many alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. It was a great time, and the food is good. It's not going to be super gourmet food. It's good food though, a little greasy, but very very good bar food, and that's not because you are drunk that it taste good. It generally has food that really quite done quite well."
Melanie M.,"Sausalito, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/2/2010,"Service is really bad. Our first (also to be the last) trip there, they brought the wrong appetizer to our table: calamari. As my husband and I were looking at eachother asking, ""Did you order this?"" My 10-year-old who loves calamari grabbed a couple of pieces of the plate and started munching. So we let the waitress know that it wasn't ours. What she did astounded me--she took the plate back into the kitchen and not a minute later brough the same plate that my kid had eaten off of an served it to the table next to us! Isn't that against health code? Clearly there was a problem here, bcs they also tried to bring us that table's entres, too. I've heard from other friends that the service here was really bad, during their experience too."
Thierry H.,"San Francisco, CA",184,160,27,5.0,11/30/2009,"5 stars for bringing some modern fun place to eat or drink a beer. What a change from the old shopping Mall, now it is actually worth stopping by and grab a bite in San Rafael...  Went there on Sunday and it was pretty crowded...I had the pull pork sandwich not look at the last 3 pages on the menu as it shows the number of calories you eat...  After my pork sandwich I had the trio of fresh baked cookies with whipped cream, the 2000 calories special. Peanut butter, chocolate chunk and white chocolate cookies....to die for.  I will have to go back for the brownies...  Every single beer on the planet seemed to be on tap or in bottle. giant screens for the football fan, or dancing with the stars...  Well a good place in the middle of nowhere, finally. You even get to shop before or after a beer and make you feel really good.  Yes I am a metro-sexual after all..."
Alysha K.,"Honolulu, HI",1283,606,698,4.0,12/7/2009,"Compared to the one at Tanforan Mall, this location is smaller, but definitely worth the wait. Portions are huge so it is best to split apps/meals. The chicken wings are my favorite. It's better to come with more people so you can try more things. My boyfriend and I ordered 3 apps: chicken wings, flatbread pizza, & sliders and it was way too much food. Go hungry!"
William H.,"Sacramento, CA",12,127,1,4.0,7/2/2012,"They have an expansive menu, and everything I have had has been extremely good. The place has awesome decor, and the service is excellent.  The burger melt, with caramelized onions and cheese was amazing. And cooked just how I liked it. They also have some of the best fries. I love their menu of small bites. The mac and cheese, which was $3.95 was some of the best mac I have had. This place is impressive."
Megan W.,"Marin County, CA",11,146,,2.0,1/25/2010,"Went here for lunch today with two co-workers.  Underwhelmed is a slight understatement.   If you enjoy going to places where you have to ask for things constantly, you will love BJ's.  I only had tea, so I can't speak for the food, but our server was non-existent, and at one point blatantly ignored my co-worker when she asked for ice tea - like, made eye contact and walked away ignored.  I'm only giving this place two stars because it looks like they do have an amazing selection of beer.   But, if you want beer and sports, go to the Mayflower!!"
Amanda M.,"Allen, TX",19,118,13,5.0,11/9/2009,This review is based on their drinks only as I have not eaten there. As long as there is a Chipotle next door there will be no reason for me to.  So they have their own cider. It's a tart berry cider. They have a HUGE selection of Belgium beers which makes my husband SUPER happy. We will be going back for Happy Hours to catch a hockey game on one of the MANY big screens!
johnny p.,"Novato, CA",0,55,2,4.0,11/11/2009,"A large, high ceilinged barn feel, filled with numerous tables and booths, topped with a large bar and multiple HD big screen TVs start your encounter with BJ's.  Good selection of ""house-crafted"" beers are available from blonde to pale, red, brown bitter and stout. The pale ale is lighter than some without an over Cascade hopped flavor but just a touch too sweet to be able to consume multiple pints. The stout is hearty and heavy. Additionally, there areabot 15 other taps for beers rangig from Speakeasy ale to boddingtons  and bottle of beer including the dreaded Belgian Trappist Ales. The wine list is reasonable and there is a full bar for your other adult beverages needs.  Food - better than average pub grub and pizzas.  The lettuce cups are excellent and the parmesan chicken very tasty but a bit salty.  The food and the portions are both ""hearty"" and you are not going to leave this place hungry."
Ana f.,"Napa, CA",1,14,1,1.0,2/12/2012,"So I came here with my husband and baby.  And at first it was ok, we were seated and drinks were ordered just fine, then food started coming, but things didn't come out together, my husbands order was messed up and was never brought out, my sons drink never came out.  At the end my husband was just upset because no one got to eat we were just left waiting with half Orders of things.  Finally we just decide we don't want to wait any longer so we just ask for the bill, we were charged for everything and we never ate anything but our appetizer, so pretty much we payed for $60 calamari wtf!  Nothing was taken off our bill we were so upset we just payed and left, I really liked this place before, but after this incident it's ridiculous.  I won't be coming here anymore.  Oh yea and extremely rude hostess!"
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",6,26,,3.0,2/17/2013,Eat dinner here a few nights with friends. Food was pretty good. The service was mediocre.  Sat at the bar one night and it took 5 minutes to for the Bartender to acknowledge me. She was busy gabbing and laughing with a customer 4 chairs away from me.  I stopped in for brunch it (YEP!) 10 minutes before the waitress showed up at all to give me a menu. Then another 15 to comeback and take my order (My guess is a bathroom and/or cigarette break...) Brunch was so limited and mediocre. But the dinner food is pretty good. Applebee's is next door. Their food is pretty good too.  One last note: Lots of beer on tape. BUT NO BELGIUM BEER.  Bad Service is their down fall.
Albert S.,"Novato, CA",0,14,,2.0,12/21/2012,"As a sports bar this place might be OK if you are only ordering is a beer.  Three strikes and you are out for the food.  I have ordered the fish & chips, meatloaf, and a steak.  The fish & chips were greasy, the meatloaf had an off flavor that was not appetizing, and the steak was tough and dry.  I had a Ceasar salad for one side and it gets a C+ which would have been higher if enough dressing were used to flavor it.  The cheddar mashed potatoes were OK but the cheese was very sparsely applied. Other side dishes I've ordered had similar problems. On our last visit service was OK but the waitress never came back to see if we needed anything more until the bill arrived.  The place had many empty booths and seats so it was not a matter of being busy. The decor is inviting and like others in the franchise chain.  The TV screens placed around are high up so seating placement is crucial if you want to watch a game. Bottom line, I go to a restaurant for the food.  BJs needs to work on that aspect of the operation."
Town C.,"Oakland, CA",1,1,,1.0,5/20/2011,"Hey Folks, there is a reason why the numbers are so low.  Believe them, as people came online to share their miserable experience.  Save your money and try one of the many great places in San Rafael.  It must be a a case of weak staff, such as the gothic-depressed hostess, or the useless waitress or, unfortunately management . Part of my disappointment is I have eaten at the Vacaville location, and 2 locations in Sac, all of which I have gladly given a well-earned 5 stars to them........After this posting, I will never mention I have been to BJs, which truly sucks, just like the name."
David R.,"San Rafael, CA",22,73,396,4.0,8/1/2012,"This is my local watering hole and sports bar. I love the fact they have International soccer games on all the time. Their hand-crafted beers and sodas are awesome. I simply have not had one bad meal there since it opened. I must go there twice a month. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken and Jambalaya are my all-time favorites. The only thing I can't stand is that when a game is on, there's no sound. Come on guys, when people go to a sports bar, at least turn up the sound a bit."
Stephen L.,"Annapolis, MD",105,72,40,2.0,8/27/2011,"Food is middle of the road if they bring you the right food in the first place. Beer is good and they have a huge selection on tap. Service sucks, man it really does suck but if you want to watch a game in the Terra linda area and have a beer this is the spot with a 106' TV behind the bar and a bunch of TV's all around."
Cindy T.,"San Francisco, CA",1,28,2,4.0,3/22/2010,"Yup, I dunno what's up with all the people who review BJ as bad. I am a fan. The food are fresh. Went here with a friend. The total number of people are 5, me and my daughter, a girlfriend of mine and her 2 boys. We got seated as promised time, at the booth.  The waitress was nice and real. Don't you hate those flaky nice and artificial. Just be real, right ? The southwestern sauce on the appetizer was super and the sesame sauce was great !  They have selection of nice wine. I had Cab and it was satisfactory. The portion was nice. I ordered the tomato bisque,.. well, for this one I had better, but totally not disappointed at all. It was quite noisy and hard to chat, but it was also Sunday nite,.. so the place almost packed, the bar was quite full.  Anyway, I would recommend the place to anyone, because the variety of food, and the taste of them which is fresh and great. Don't be fool by the chain. It's better than spending our bucks with local resto, mom n pop's place and end up disappointed. BTW, I am Asian woman, so I know when food has spices in it or not. This place definitely put the right spices as it should."
Greg Y.,"San Francisco, CA",8,15,,1.0,1/27/2010,"To the managers at BJs San Rafael, I have a HMD 101 book if you want to borrow it??? On my visit to BJ's, it was poor.  Not for its atmosphere, ambience or food.  The service was horrible.  Maybe it started with the submissive greeting we were offered as we entered the restaurant.  Or the extreme tardiness of our server Clint (I call Clint out because he was simply a bad server) or the failure to check up on my party during the entire meal, or how two food runners simply didn't bother to avoid me as I left my table.  I know there hands were full, so I would imagine these would want to slow down and prevent any accident.  Well maybe I am wrong?  I especially like how the all FOUR of the hostesses were too busy to say bye as I left the restaurant."
Amy P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",637,264,1,3.0,1/26/2011,"So you have an idea to start a brewery and restaurant chain and you're pondering over names. You finally decide on the name ""B.J.'s"" ? I mean come on.  ( no pun intended) I have decided that the owner of this chain is either an ex-porn start looking to cash in after hanging up her .. uh ""talents"" or a gay men trying to slip one past the general pubic uh... public. In general, I am not a fan of chains, I have lived in metropolitan areas of L.A. and S.F. too long and am slightly spoiled. This place is really no exception, but my dad loves it and I have visited several times. Being that my girls and I love football, we decided to give this place a chance for the playoffs. It was fairly busy and the mix of people was comical. There is nothing to brighten a girl's day, like being hit on by an 80 year old Pittsburgh fan, yikes. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was very average, I could make better in my sleep. ( 2 stars) The hot wings however, were excellent. They were actually fried and not the gooey, soggy mess that most places serve up ( 4 stars). Our bartender was almost non-existent, we had to flag him down several times, even when he wasn't busy ( a pet peeve of mine for sure). The crowd was pretty mixed, but this is not exactly what I would call a cool spot, very suburban. To be fair, it is in a mall, so what do you expect? A very average experience, nothing to rave about, unless you count the several big screens and open atmosphere.. eh.  Don't be fooled people, the name of this establishment is sexually misleading. It is a family-friendly chain, not a cool gay club or hip sex shop. I mean ya, I made out with the a fore mentioned 80 y.o., but Viagra let us down. We couldn't comply with the restaurant's title, fail."
Stacey D.,"San Rafael, CA",2,6,,3.0,1/16/2010,"I have been to BJ's more times then I can count since it opened. I must say I love the atmosphere, it's San Rafael's first real sports bar type resturaunt and nice to have in the area. The food is pretty good, except I wasn't at all impressed with the parmesan chicken or black cherry soda. The place can be a bit overpriced, but they do have some good lunch time specials.  The thing that really brings this resturaunt down is it's service. I can't really blame the waiters (though none of them have been very helpful), I'd say its more the kitchen staff because food here is sllooowww! I have never had such slow food, they take forever no matter what you order. And I can't tell you how many times they have messed up our orders (not to mention dropping our pizza). Overall the resturaunt is pretty decent, good food and atmosphere. Hopefully as time progresses, their service will improve. p.s. if you go at dinner time, be prepared for a long wait, I definitely suggest calling ahead."
America F.,"San Francisco, CA",20,154,2,3.0,5/15/2012,I've been there two times and the food sucks really bad. The avocado egg rolls are good. Artichokes deep fried tasted like breaded artichokes you buy in the grocery store in jars.  Last time I went in I had a frozen veggie burger you can get at the grocery store and they messed that up.  Today I went in and ordered a shrimp taco. I was very disappoint not hat I expected at all I was shocked at what was given to me. I took a bite and left it alone that shit was nasty and cold. Don't even get me started on what they gave me with it.  I had a peach virgin margarita that was good but tiny and no refills so I probably wouldn't get it again.  When you walk in the door they are so nice one you get a waiter they can't be found it's like they are avoiding you.  The inside looks so nice like a place you want to go but the food keep me away.  How can you fuck up a taco and frozen food? I hate the food I feel I was ripped off I expect a chain restaurant to have good simple food and they don't.  I won't return it sucked that bad and I feel it was over priced considering how bad the food sucks. Update:  I tried something new and fell in love with the clam chowder in the bread bowl sometimes I go in a few times a week because it tastes so good.  before I gave this place a one star but since they have the best clam chowder I have ever had I will change my rating.
