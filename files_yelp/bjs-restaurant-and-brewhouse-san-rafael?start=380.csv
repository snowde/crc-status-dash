Jessica N.,"Novato, CA",147,8,7,2.0,11/12/2013,"The food is okay and the service is some of the worst I've ever had! I've given this staff the benefit of the doubt when they're slammed and really busy, and even then they are so extremely rude and inattentive but I've come here when it's dead and the service is just as bad. Not bringing out orders, then bringing out wrong orders. Every time I talked to our server it was like I was bothering him or something, when he took our order or when I asked for ketchup or a to-go box... I figured the servers play this game at work to kill boredom, called ""who can get the worst tip?"""
Susan D.,"San Rafael, CA",2,14,,3.0,7/20/2011,This place gets 3 stars merely because my kids love the pizookie and they do have some good beers - neither the food nor the service has been consistent
Susan T.,"Novato, CA",1,15,,5.0,6/8/2012,BJs.......now that's a name that can create a situation :). and because of that I'll always smile and never talk about the restaurant with a straight face :) The mini appetizers are great!!! The variety of beers is really good!!!! and the Pazookies......yummmmm !!!!!!!
Gabe S.,"San Antonio, TX",297,9,,1.0,12/25/2010,"I've been to a BJ's in Concord before, and it was pretty good. I like it. So I'm assuming the horrible experience i had here must have been due to the management and service i experienced. Let me give you a gist of what my family and i experienced. 7:20 - We arrived at BJ's, and had a party of about, 19. We got seated around 7:45. 8:00 - Our Server comes to ask us what we'd like to drink. We mostly all wanted just water. 8:30 - THE WATER COMES OUT. Apparently, they import it directly from the alps. Seriously? Half an hour for water? Whatever. We get our order taken at the time, which goes smoothly. 9:00 - We're all still waiting for the food, even the appetizers. The waiter comes by, for the first time since taking our order, and we ask him what's up and why the food is taking so long.. (It's 19 people, i understand that's a lot. But it was NOT BUSY. So many empty tables. Was he the only one working?) He told us he'd get us bread while we wait. (We never got the bread.) 9:20 - Food starts coming out! But only 3 plates. 2 of which are appetizers. By now my family is PISSED and rejects the appetizers, they brought out cold macaroni for my niece and her friends, by the time they got a bottle of ketchup for my nephew, his burgers were cold. 9:35 - The rest of the food starts coming out. (after being yelled at, and talking to the manager, the server didn't come back alone, this time about 3-4 more came along with trays of food as well.) My aunt's food wasn't with that bundle though, so she waited but told everyone else to start eating. Her appetizer never came as well. Two of my brothers got the pulled pork sandwich (which did not look like pulled pork) and one lacked the onion toppings. By the time the server came back to ask if we were all right, his food was cold, and he asked for the onions. They took the sandwich and just added onions to it and brought it back. By this time, my brother was very upset about getting back his cold sandwich and just totally rejected it. Later on my sister ordered him the ribs and he enjoyed it. By the time we were halfway through our food, my aunts food makes its way out. As for the food, it was O.K. but DEFINITELY not worth ALL THAT TROUBLE. On the bright side, the Manager had told us we needn't pay for a single thing. So it was a free dinner for us, and most likely a $300+ loss for them. Maybe that will be a wake up call to train their employees better."
Rebecca L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",13,35,9,4.0,11/9/2009,I have to start by saying the food is really good and would have received 5 out of 5 but... I have been there twice now and had an issue twice. The first visit we went for lunch the day it opened to the public. My husband and I both ate off the lunch menu but when the bill came we were charged for the dinner items. The second visit I called ahead for a party of 8 and was told that there might be a slight wait of 10-15 minutes. Well we got there and there was no table of 8 waiting for us and we had to wait over 25 minutes. So we went to the bar to get some drinks while we waited and the bar tender asked to see ID from everyone including my 66 yr old mom and her 70 yr old friend. They both were very offened. Again the food was great but the service is still scetchy being so new!
Wheeler T.,"San Rafael, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/8/2013,"Extremely poor service, no follow up from wait staff at the table and not much better at the bar either when I've sat there.  Been several times and the cooks are true shoe makers, meaning everything they touch turns to leather!  Had ordered their Black and Blue burger Medium Rare and at best it comes out medium well to well done and this is after asking kindly to emphasize to the kitchen there has been past issues with their temp control and their asking how I'd like it prepared plus the bacon was ICE cold. Gave them a couple tries one evening and it just came out more over cooked each attempt after which I got a lame song and dance from the MOD.  I could go on about their overall issues both in the FOH and BOH but it would be like beating a dead horse... I think this San Rafael unit is where the Cheesecake Factory rejects end up. Next time I believe I'll just grab a beer and a snack at a gas station than through my money away there."
Liz K.,"Traverse City, MI",105,294,79,3.0,12/29/2009,"This BJ's is just about the antithesis of the one I went to in Burbank. Decor is much more upscale than Burbank, and the food was better than I remembered. Or maybe that's because I had a salad and a giant baked potato this time. Not a lot you can really screw up there.  Our server was the strangest dude I've ever been waited on. It was like he was auditioning for Masterpiece Theater or something - so over the top, we were laughing at him whenever he walked away. Mean, I know, but you would too if you'd heard the inflection in his voice. At least he was attentive! I know the peeps of Marin are kinda enthralled with BJ's right now, but I'm still not. It's just a-ok and always will be for me."
Kamy M.,"Novato, CA",23,10,3,1.0,8/16/2011,"Good beer...  with disgusting, microwaved, pre-packaged, greasy, sub-standard, fast food type food. Need I say more?"
Tara E.,"Cotati, CA",6,7,,5.0,7/3/2010,"I really loved the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant!  The prices are super reasonable and there are so many different options. There is pretty much something for everyone here! I can't wait to go again! We had a delicious Mediterranean Deep Dish Pizza, Mozzarella and Tomato appetizer and a kids sunday for our son.  Everything was delicious, served quickly and with class!"
Jennie S.,"San Francisco, CA",62,92,77,3.0,3/3/2010,"Another chain restaurant. I was very impressed with this place when I first tried it 4-5 years ago in San Diego - the pazookie was (and I bet still is) AMAZING. The past few times I've eaten here (mainly in San Bruno, Vacaville, and Concord) have been consistently A-OK. What I remember having are the baked potatoes which are HUGE but nothing spectacular and appetizers are fine (nothing stands out to me).  But last night I had take out from here and am in love with the spaghetti with spicy sauce :) My boyfriend had the scampi pasta and described it as dry but good and he would order something else next time. I am definitely going back for the spicy spaghetti, mmmmmmmm :) PS. The take out pasta portions were HUGE! I'm having the spaghetti for lunch today *excited*"

Fiona F.,"San Francisco, CA",10,45,1,1.0,1/23/2011,"Wow! This is my third and final time to visit BJ's in San Rafael. At least until they get some decent management in this place. Let me state that my review is mostly about the service in the place and only a bit about the food. I have eaten here several times and the service is always atrocious! Two times it was incredibly busy and so I chalked it up to the wait staff being overloaded. No longer! The hub and I ate here again tonight - fairly late - and the place was only 1/4 full. The ""hostess"" directed us into the bar area even though there were tons of empty tables. No problem for us, we found a booth in the bar area and had a seat. There were no menus or cutlery on the table. After about 5 minutes, a waiter showed up and asked what we wanted to drink. After about another 5 minutes, we got our menus and water. Then we had to wait. About 15 minutes before he showed up again to take our order. The food itself showed up about 15 minutes later but we had to flag down the waiter to bring us some cutlery (meanwhile the food gets cold) and the salad (drowned in dressing). We both had pizzas which were good but the meal was already ruined by the drowned salad and crappy service. At the end of the meal, we had to flag the waiter down again for the bill and to-go box. Ugh! Very disappointing. I hope he enjoyed the change I left him (75 cents). Here's a tip: You are a waiter! Wait on tables and you will earn a decent tip. Ignore a table and make your clients work to get your attention and you will earn chump change. Finally, while I can't stand the bad service I received tonight or on the previous occasions I visited this restaurant, I blame the management. The service is consistently bad and it doesn't matter where you sit or who is your server or what you order - it's all bad all the time. This tells me that the management doesn't know how to manage or train or doesn't care. My response? I am sending a copy of this Yelp review to the corporate office. I urge all other unhappy customers to do the same. I have eaten at several restaurants in this chain and have always been satisfied. Until San Rafael.  Here is the corporate contact info: "
Maximillian M.,"San Francisco, CA",186,2203,1,2.0,1/12/2011,"It's got an overpriced Denny's vibe with fancy beer. Ten bucks for a ham and cheese sammy with a ""bowl"" (more like giant cup) of tomato bisque. Not bad, but not great either. Friendly service...when they show up from time to time. Hostess seemed like she hated her job though."
Melissa W.,"Novato, CA",75,16,7,3.0,3/7/2010,"The food is ok. It comes in big portions and is a little on the expensive side, but since I usually have leftovers, it's a pretty good deal. They give you free mozarella sticks when taking their surveys, and free food is always awesome. And their mozarella sticks are yummy. Their avocado egg rolls are delicious. They had a good sauce inside. Their fettuccine alfredo was yummy. Their deep dish pizzas are good, but I think they taste better with only one or two toppings. The crust is so big and tasty already that too many toppings doesn't taste as good. Fish and chips and chicken fried steak are also good. Their clam chowder is good. The chili has a strong beer flavor (in my opinion), but my friends would disagree. Their handcrafted sodas are also good, but I love my Shirley temples! My other favorite thing to eat here are the crispy thin fries. So yummy and crisp. Bad thing about this place is that when it's busy, the wait can be as long as an hour. Also, once you're seated, the service is usually good, but the food takes forever. I'd suggest only coming here when you're hungry, not starving. And it's a fun place to have a slow, casual lunch or dinner with friends or family. It's a cool hangout place. But if you don't like tv's and loud people watching sports, stay away. Otherwise, visit and try the fries! Oh I totally forgot. You have to try a pizookie (pizza cookie) if you've never had one. They have 4 or 5 different cookie flavors and they're all delicious. It's a fresh baked cookie that's been baked in a pizza dish. You won't regret it."
Chris O.,"Marin County, CA",10,37,,4.0,1/18/2010,"I had a completely different experience than most of the others. It's a restaurant in a mall, for chrissakes!   It's fun, the food is better than anything in the area, and it has a better game day TV than I have. Tasty food, lots of variety, generous portions, fresh veggies, ripe fruit, smiling wait staff, good beer...give them a break. The restaurant seems to be designed from the ground up with the customer in mind.  Booths are raised above the floor so you can see the game on the big screen TV over the heads of those passing by. And there's a dedicated counter and server to manage just To Go orders. I'm sheepishly impressed."
Tasaday L.,"Petaluma, CA",2,12,,1.0,7/4/2011,"On June 27th, right after finishing two challenging nursing finals and coming off a 5-week intensive summer program, several of my fellow nursing students and I went to BJ's to celebrate and relax.  We were there for three hours, not because we were enjoying ourselves, but because the service was so atrocious.  First, we had only one waitress for 15 of us, and she was new.  It took almost 20 minutes to get water, then even longer to get our mixed drinks, and to get food...what a joke!  Once we were served our food, they just ignored us again, and no one could get refills on water, or order any more drinks. We were all pretty patient, I thought, but when we finally complained, about two hours in, we got lip service from a waitress who wasn't even ours, then the runaround from our waitress.  Even after we said something, service and attention did not improve.  It took almost 45 minutes to bring out a dessert; one of those cookie things they make, so finally I asked for the manager.  It took her almost 20 minutes to arrive, meanwhile we're waiting for our bill, then to pay our bill.   And let me say this, this was not a busy restaurant!  I've worked in restaurants before.  There were...maybe...7 tables in the joint, and there were plenty of people wandering around doing nothing, including the day shift manager.   Once the night-shift manager, Pam, came over, she gave us lip service too!  Never introduced herself, or apologized for the service.  She just asked us if we had complained before this, and when we said yes, she said ""Well, you can't expect anyone to do anything if you don't let us know"".  It was pretty ridiculous.   I've been to BJ's before, with my husband, and it was ok.  The food is hit-or-miss, and the service has been bad, but never this bad.  I will not, on principle, ever go to ANY BJ's again, because I was so offended by my experience at the Northgate one.   I know they can make money by getting people in there and keeping them ripped, but in the long run they'll lose potential guests because of their lack of service and BS attitude.   I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Erin B.,"Sacramento, CA",49,13,68,1.0,2/21/2011,"Bad experience (wrong orders & poor service), until our waitress left & Wade came & made it all better. He fixed our order & made us feel welcome. Even the manager didn't even seem to care. He tried to fix the problem but still came back with the wrong order. Never going back to this place. BJ's should thank Wade... cuz if it wasn't for him u wouldn't get any stars."
David A.,"Novato, CA",4,30,1,4.0,3/8/2010,"I'm normally not a fan of chains, but maybe Marin could use something that's on a larger scale and better planned.   Deep dish pizza was okay.  Old Chicago in Petaluma is the true star here.  Bready, but tasty. The beers have a large selection and get pretty crafty, but not over the top crafty.  Good job on a large selection."
Bill K.,"Albany, NY",3,152,,2.0,1/29/2012,"The food is average.  The selection of beer is fine, but a little overpriced.  The atmosphere is cool with many TVs for sports viewing.  The service has been shaky to down right awful at times.  In fact, once we were seated, waited for 10 minutes, and ended up leaving due to never being waited on.  As much as I wanted to like this place, I just can't do it."
Brad L.,"San Rafael, CA",19,21,12,1.0,1/28/2011,"This restaurant has a lot potentially going for it. Nice family style atmosphere, good sports-bar type vibe, good food- except for the one fatal flaw - service. We have been here 5 times since opening and we have only had ""decent"" service once. The other 4 times have been a disaster. On our last visit it took us 45 min to get a table (was quoted 20), and from entering the restaurant took us 2 1/2 hours to sit eat and pay. The kids were climbing the walls by the credit card signing process. I even brought this to the attention to the manager mid-meal, and he informed me that it had been only 19 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we had received our food. I guess I don't know how to tell time? He made an attempt to make it right by giving us a free desert, however I just don't think I can go here anymore. Unless I have a lot of time to kill!"
