T C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",201,21,29,1.0,6/29/2016,"This is the first time in my life I didnt leave a tip. Im beyond disappinted. Every touch point failed. Drinks took 30 minutes, dinner came out cold and with an incorrect order. The manager was not only oblivious, but didnt even correct the situation the way we requested.  I have never seen lack of team work like this, its beyond comprehension. Not one person who walked by would pre-bus. The food runners were over worked and I didnt see one server deliver food. Zero zero team work- and it wasnt even busy!  The manager was the worst and blamed it on triaining.  I waited tables for 5 years and cannot understand how the doors are still open. Stay away- i will be going to Crapple-bee's next door instead.  You've lost my business forever and Im active in the business community and telling everyone I know!"
Ash N.,"San Bruno, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2017,"Here on a Monday night just trying to relax and the bartender, just happens to be a major D*%#  Worst bartender I have ever encountered in my life. I will never return on a Monday night to have dinner or come to the bar, just for the pure fact he might be here. You wanna have a bad time?!?! Come on a Monday night!!!"
Jackie L.,"Oceanside, CA",2,83,17,4.0,8/19/2017,"I have been here about 5 times recently and when it's slow service is great, servers have been really nice.  Lunch and weekend dinners are a little hectic but if you are there to eat leisurely it's great.  It's a chain but I love the fact they have Vegan vegetarian i options and are willing to modify food.  There is something for everyone and this location needed a good place like BJs.  The lentil and ancient grain soup is delicious, so is roasted cauliflower  appetizer is good."
Thomas D.,"San Rafael, CA",60,15,,1.0,12/29/2016,"I always consider BJ's a 2 1/2 star chain, reliably OK, never great and never terrible. That opinion has changed. It gets 1 star. Tonight, out of 5 orders they got 4 wrong. Ordered medium rare cheeseburger and got well done. Ordered 2 plates of mahi fish and shrimp, both plates the mahi was overcooked to the point of being dry rubber. Ordered brussel sprouts appetizer and asked to put spicy sriracha sauce on the side (so the kids could eat some) they came drenched in sriracha with an extra bowl of sriracha on the side. And the food took a long time to come out, and the last dish took even longer so I was sitting there waiting while everyone else was eating. Also, this place isn't cheap. The decor is nice."
Shavon W.,"Richmond, CA",0,19,60,1.0,2/25/2017,"I'm usually have great service when I goes to any other BJ's establishment that I go to except for this one. Me my father and daughter was seated in Simeon's section, the service wasn't that great at all he never came back to check up on us and he messed up on our order. Management needs to train the staff better"
Peter J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",83,873,83,5.0,5/27/2016,"I really like this place a whole heck of. A lot, the other day was my first time at bj's. They have a very exstensive menu here. I had a hard deciding what I wanted I knew that I pdidn't want pasta. So......I ordered.... A chicken bacon ranch panini. This was a total super yummy yums. I had a great meal and I was there with BJ AT BJS AND PJ WAS NOT WEARING HIS PJ's at BJ'S. How about that.... ,"
Liz Z.,"San Anselmo, CA",62,46,12,4.0,8/7/2016,"My boyfriend and I go here regularly.  I don't think we have ever been disappointed with the service or the quality of the food. Last night we tried their take out service for the first time - the service there was great and friendly.  I was pleasantly surprised, also, to see you can purchase their beer in 6-packs to bring home. We both enjoy the BJ's Brewhouse Burger and their Red Buffalo (Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout).  For dessert go for the Pizookie trio!  You'll get three different mini Pizookie and lots of yumm.  Other recommendations: boneless buffalo wings, chicken tenders, pizza! Also, if it's nice out ask to sit outside - it's always relatively quiet outside with a nice atmosphere.  Final note:  if you are just looking to grab a beer their bar is a nice spot to hang out and maybe watch a game - though it does seem to fill up quickly!"
Daniel R.,"San Rafael, CA",79,24,1,3.0,4/2/2017,Been here many times. Its american fare cuisine that is nothing to write home about but serviceable when there are limited options.  They make pretty good salads and their portions are generous. The highlight of this restaurant is the pizookie dessert.  The Northgate location also has a take out entrance which is I highly recommend along with ordering in advance.
Jim S.,"San Rafael, CA",3,41,,1.0,10/25/2017,"This is an update of a previous review.  Unfortunately, things are not better at the Northgate BJ's.  Service is slowwwww.  Despite having many people on its wait staff, there is no sense of urgency. The staff does more time yapping with each other than serving the customers.  Also, the timing is always off.  Despite repeated requests to bring the appetizer out first and then the entrees, they always seem to either (a) come out together, or (b) come out consecutively and quickly so that you are just starting to enjoy the appetizer and your entree arrives.  I don't I will be writing another review because we are not going there again."
Terrie G.,"San Rafael, CA",9,86,2,1.0,12/4/2016,Ordered the Caesar Salad with grilled salmon and was sorely disappointed.  Biggest complaint was the terrible dressing.  I think they buy it from Smart and Final in the close-out aisle.  Sure tasted that way. Salmon was super dry at one end and not cooked enough at the other.   They probably thought the single teaspoon of shaved parmesan was generous however I felt otherwise. No one at the take-out counter to take my order.  For several long minutes.  A precursor adn I wish I was paying more attention.  Had to flag down the busboy to find someone. And expensive too!  $35 for 2 salads to go.  Waste of money.  Won't go back.
M S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,8,1,1.0,10/27/2016,"Lizzy couldn't have been more bothered to take our order. I had to repeat everything I said, not once but twice (no the phone wasn't spotty) and when I said ""this is for pickup"" she quickly said ""obviously"".  She also told us to pick up at the bar instead of doing curbside (it was pouring down rain and we had a baby in the car.  Rude is an understatement when it comes to Lizzy's demeanor and how we were treated when we were simply trying to order dinner for our family. I hope the food doesn't leave as bad of a taste in our mouths as the service. Oh and the place was entirely empty, not surprising. And...the update. We went to the bar to get our food and the manager was at first attentive (looked through our bags to make sure all was correct) but I noticed some nice whiskeys (Elijah Craig, Four Roses etc) and complimented him on the selection and he walked off mid sentence - completely ignoring me.  I guess the fish rots from the head as they say. Left a $2 tip on a $55 order. Left a note ""rude service = crappy tip""..."
Corey C.,"Larkspur, CA",0,18,2,3.0,1/10/2017,"Been here twice with much better service. Last week Jory inspired me to update my post. She's very sweet and beautiful and conversational and on the ball. 5 stars for service, 2 stars for food. It tastes bad. The avocado egg rolls are so bad I didn't finish my first half. I didn't tell her because what can she do. I got ziti. It had weak flavor and was a tiny portion.  Jory offered to bring my son's food early when we ordered and did so. It looked nice but was also bland. Everything needed salt and the same goes for the other five times I ate here. Other BJ's are better so I don't know what's happening. I hope because we are in Marin that they aren't holding back on salt for some health reason because that is just foolish. Seriously, a little salt in the cooking process would make it taste literally twice as good."
Daivd P.,"American Canyon, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/19/2017,"Terrible!!!!!!!!! Over the years have been there many times and each time awful. Would go back after months to see if they got their act together. Last time there three years ago was sooooooo bad that it took three years just to experience another visit!  Mistake. Hot food cold. Cold food warm. Beer tasters warm and flat, very very flat. The service?  What service? The manager could care less, the hostess in a daze, the, of all the times over the years, WORSE restaurant my friends and family have experienced by unanimous vote!!!! Stay away, they really really really do not care if you ever come back or not"
Dre C.,"San Rafael, CA",0,125,,3.0,6/20/2017,"Was there Mon night 6/19. Server Michael was 5 stars! Too bad the pizza, BJs California, was bland and hardly any cheese. Not the usual BJs pizza!"
Anne P.,"Novato, CA",62,51,9,1.0,2/5/2016,"Can anyone tell me why a long, sexy scrap of plastic is lingering in my dish, threatening to choke me? Call me crazy but I believe this implies the ""chef"" takes a frozen sauce packet, dips it in boiling water, allowing Phthalates to leach into the sauce that was made years ago, and then they just drowned my entire entrée in it, topping it off with the remainder top piece of plastic sauce satchel. How charming... All in all, the service was fast and amazing as always (those kids work hard!) however the food was a little overpriced considering I ate something from a frozen bag."
Peggy B.,"Corte Madera, CA",0,4,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"Irritated and appalled don't even begin to explain how I feel about the ""service"" I received today. I placed an online order at 11:30 to be picked up at 12:15. I walked in at 12:08 realizing I was a few minutes early and would probably have to wait. However, I stood at the take out counter until 12:24 when I was finally acknowledged by someone. Mind you, a manager walked past me multiple times. When I was finally ""greeted"" I was told that they had not even started making half of my order because they didn't know what kind of pizza I wanted (when I clearly ordered a gluten free cheese pizza) but the other half was available. Excuse me? The mobile app makes you add a phone number, so why wasn't I contacted about my order? If that wasn't enough, it was gonna take an additional 15 minutes for the pizza to be made. It took a total of 10 minutes for me to even pay for my order. Once I FINALLY paid, I asked the ""waitress"" how long I would have to wait for the pizza and she laughed. Are you kidding me? The manager came over, never offered me anything, didn't apologize. Nothing. I work in this mall. It's ridiculous that this is the kind of service they provide. Needless to say I will not be coming back, ever. And I plan on telling all the family and friends that I have. Worst service I have ever received. This place is a JOKE. By the way, the photos attached are of my mobile order where it clearly states that I ordered a gluten free cheese pizza. Also, the take out counter, where I stood for WAY TOO LONG waiting for over priced food that wasn't even hot."
Hailey P.,"Novato, CA",0,30,1,1.0,6/8/2017,"BJ's food is great. I love the Brussel sprouts. The service at BJ's is absolutely terrible and I mean it, if you want to be seated and have to wait 30 minuets to have someone come over and introduce themselves as your server AFTER you had to ask someone who your server even is then this is the place for you. The service has got to improve here or I see BJ's going down hill very soon. Good luck."
Leslie C.,"Redwood City, CA",19,4,4,1.0,9/21/2017,Sat outside for over an hour before we had our order taken. We were a group of 18 and 4 of the 18 ordered clam chowder. After waiting for our food for over an hour we were told that they were out of clam chowder. Unacceptable.
John O.,"Novato, CA",17,45,18,2.0,5/14/2017,"Once again, appetizers did not show up.Took it off the bill. Tired of the inept service."
Alison J.,"Novato, CA",19,134,194,3.0,10/31/2016,"We stopped by for lunch, and after studying the lengthy menu, decided on the Black and Blue Burger for me and Spaghetti and Meatballs for my hubs. My burger was not bad. Not great, but certainly not bad. The report on the spaghetti was so-so. I like that they offer the smaller burgers as an option (5 oz instead of their standard 7 oz). The skinny fries were good, not greasy or too crispy. Our server was friendly and accommodating when I asked for some ranch dressing for my fries. Overall, not a bad place, but the food is pretty mediocre."
