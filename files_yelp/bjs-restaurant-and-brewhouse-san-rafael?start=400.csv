David D.,"San Francisco, CA",83,328,2,4.0,12/21/2009,"Like they say- there is nothing like getting some BJ's on a Friday night! : ) Their beer selection alone(35+ beers on tap) makes this place worthy of 5 stars, however, the food itself is only worth 3 stars. Hence me giving this place 4 stars. If you could think of a beer, the odds are this BJ's has it. The Buffalo wings here are also really really good. But I had the chicken pasta which was just fair. And I also had shrimp tacos that just didn't impress me. But thats alright, I'm still a fan."
J S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,26,11,1.0,1/1/2011,"Me: I would like to make a reservation. BJ: You have 10 or more? Me: Yes. BJ: Hold on.  (after 5 minutes) BJ: What day? Me: today. BJ: Sorry. we can't Me: It will be 9 PM. BJ: OK.  But we will charge 17% gratitude Me: Fine At 9 PM, the table wasn't ready.  Everybody came late so it didn't matter much, but the table was for only 10 people, not 12. It took about ONE hour to get the main dishes, and the server forgot one person's meal completely.  And he never even came to refill any of the soft drink.  The food was lukewarm and was NOT anything close to good. Money and time wasted.   Please train your staff....if you wanna be in biz."
Pedro D.,"San Anselmo, CA",0,29,,3.0,4/15/2012,"If you're at the end of the day, near Northgate, the weather is nice, and in the mood for a good beer and appetizers this is a very good option. They have two outdoor dining sections, and unless you enjoy aggravatingly noisy acoustics they are the only sections that are enjoyable.  Or if you want to watch the big screen sports, then the indoor seating is fine. Food quality is mixed.  Many of their appetizers are very tasty, but tried their sliders recently - and they taste like the $1.00 menu from McDonalds.  Or at least what I imagine those would taste like."
Justynne B.,"San Francisco, CA",96,56,48,1.0,7/30/2014,this place sucks my gf ordered a drink and they carded her. her license expired a week ago but we both have kids.i never get carded period especially with my son the waitress said she had to check with her manager if it was alright. of course they said no. idk why we decided to stay after that. so we ordered and they were out of chicken tenders for my son... like wtf restaurant runs out of chicken ?? anyways i asked the waitress if itd make a difference if i ordered the fucking drink bc my license is valid theyre so dumb. i get the regulations but so dumb we should have walked out our calamari was cold. oh and this is the part that trips me out sooo my friend paid with her credit card.. but she doesnt need her fucking ID for that right esp with the identity theft she knowingly could run her card with an expired id but refused to serve a drink. im such a bitch i told her to leave a quarter for tip but my friend was nice and left 2 dollars bitch was lucky
Jim A.,"CA, CA",7,84,38,1.0,1/28/2010,"So I tried BJ's in mid December. I thought I would give them time to work out the opening kinks. After visit 1 they still needed more time.  Overcooked burger, major service delays, etc.   I returned the other day and it was worse. Server was very good but food staggered. One plate, 2 plate, 3 plate, 4.   My wife didn't want to go back the 2nd time. Oh well good luck to you and you bible sized menu.  I won't be returning."
German A.,"Oakland, CA",3,59,,1.0,10/22/2010,"It's a good thing they have a good beer menu.   Avocado egg roll Appetizer- meh, not bad Cobb salad- the worst I've ever had! Super bland! I had to get a side of bleu cheese just to make it somewhat interesting. Apple crisp for dessert- Not that great either.  I asked  for the pepper mill for some fresh pepper on my salad and the response was that they've been looking for it all day. Really? One mill for three hundred people? Ever think of running out to the store and just getting a few to make it thru the night? Here was the kicker. The server brought out the check before we got our dessert! She said it was standard procedure. I tell you what, that procedure SUCKS!"
Kristin H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,2,5,2.0,10/28/2010,"The service is consistently terrible. And yet... we keep going back to this place that has just ok beer and terrible service, because we love the fun atmosphere. Unfortunately, more than once we've picked up and left 15 minutes after being seated but not greeted by our server... and went to Applebee's next door for cheaper, bigger beers and stellar, immediate service."
Steve M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,25,5,1.0,8/18/2013,Hope you don't get helped by Agnes. She is a terrible server!!!! As well as the manager he didn't give his name is terrible. Went here August 18 at seven pm. Thanks for ruining my friends birthday.
Roya s.,"San Francisco, CA",1,17,,1.0,12/10/2010,"I still don't get it... And I qoute... again...  ""Our Genuine commitment is to take pride in passionately connecting with every guest, on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail during every shift - to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ's concept and brand.""    - The BJ's gold standard of Operational Excellence      (On the back of the Managers business card) Hahahahahahaha. This is so funny. You know why? Because none of it's true. Yeah, the service is still horrible. But just like the others, I keep going back. LOL What is wrong with me? Usually it's the only place open and the only place a big group can agree on... it's in the area, it's big...it's THERE.  Ugh, BJ's... get over yourself and please start reading your yelp reviews! For anyone who would like to put in their word to the manager: Mario Schiano Di Cola General Manager and shareholder (Oh, really?) Yeah, there it is.. go for it. I have nothing personal against the fellow, but... maybe if we all get through to this guy. he will find the power within to train his employees on ""The gold standard of operational excellence"" ;)"
May G.,"San Francisco, CA",17,170,15,1.0,12/19/2010,"I've been rating a lot of restaurants 1 star. It's really horrible when you spend (hard earned) money to eat out & the food is the shits!!! I went shopping with my friend this morning & we decided to have lunch here and it is so far one of the worse eateries I've ever been to.  First of all, we walked in and there was nobody at the hostess station, one finally appears & said they had no server yet (this is 45 mins after they opened for business) wtf? anyway, the party in front of us was told to go to the bar & wait. They had 2 children in their party & were told to go to the bar. Hmmmm So I asked if we could just sit at a table & wait for someone to wait on us. Poor thing, she had to think about it. I wasn't trying to wear her brain cells out with this difficult question.  The waitress was trying really hard. She said ""it's my pleasure"" after every request. I thought she was gonna pass out from too much pleasure. We ordered 2 appetizers & 2 items to share & was hoping to have leftovers for snack/dinner tonight.  Crispy Fried Artichokes: These were the best thing though it lacked flavor, the dip was probably ranch dressing.  Mini-Bruschetta: The tomatoes were tart like they put vinegar in it. I didn't care for the pesto dip that came with it. Clash in flavor Angel Hair Toscana: The chicken was tender but the entire dish had no flavor at all. I love food but I can't eat just to be eating BJ's Classic Combo: I'm not really a fan of deep dish pizza but this was absolutely GROSS, that's all I'll say. How the heck do you screw up pizza. Oh, did I mention the waitress did not bother to bring the Chez & peppers. So after paying $40 for a lousy lunch, I felt guilty about throwing food away so I packed it and went to look for a homeless person to give it to. After doing so, I was engulfed with guilt because what happens if he got sick like I did after eating it. So if you read an article about a homeless person dying of unknown causes on Geary Street in SF, you know BJ's killed him."
Shannon W.,"San Rafael, CA",3,227,,3.0,12/9/2009,"Meh. Pros about BJ's- big screen TVs, lots of beer, convenient place to grab a bite after shopping, lots of beer, comfy booths, very friendly staff, and did I mention lots of beer?   Con's- their food kinda sucks (man, am I becoming one of those spoiled Marin kids or what?!?)  I had the salmon which was good, but the mashed potatoes tasted like hydrogenated oils.  However, I also tried my friend's flat-bread pizza which was suprisingly good.  So, the food is a toss-up, but I highly recommend their desserts- I forgot what it was called, but it was a big cookie (straight out of the oven) with loads of chocolate and goodness!   So, BJ's is like a mini ESPN zone but don't expect fantastic food."
Mandy M.,"Petaluma, CA",0,2,,4.0,12/13/2010,"Honestly I dont understand why all these people who feel so disgusted with Bj's bother to keep returning. It's a chain, not a 5 star restaurant, what do you expect? Your probably the needy, rude, bad tipping customers that the severs and management dislike anyways.  Ive been there many of times. Yes the place is filled with all young servers but it keeps the atmosphere vibrant and fun. Its a great place for big groups and casual family dinners. Its one of the only bigger restaurants in the area so of course there will be a wait on a friday or saturday night. (Never too long). Ive learned from experience there that the servers really perform off the attitude and respect  given by the customers. lets face it no one really wants to serve needy people all night for minimum wage and the hope that people tip adequately.  The food is great. The menu has something for everyones taste. The prices are good too. The food does take a while to arrive, best to get a side salad or soup. (they come out faster then drinks sometimes). Or better yet if your in a hurry drive thru Burger King. But heres an answer for all the impatient reviewers: I asked our server one time why the food takes so long and she said that cretin stations get much more orders so it takes a little longer to produce so many dishes. Clearly believable. Defiantly try the Pazookie desert. It is amazing. Warm and gooey cookie straight from the oven with vanilla ice cream on top.  The management seems to be great too. In regards to all the ""training issues"" people are talking about. There are constantly new faces in the restaurant. There are clearly stronger servers then others at any given point.  Any questions you have or dislikes all the management members are on top of making your experience at their restaurant better.  I was there last night with family and we had a great time. When you are in good company and atmosphere who cares if your food takes 20-25 mins. Try the margaritas or mojitos.   And how have I come to conclude all of this? Because I am a faithful returning customer. KEEP IT UP BJS- a great casual dining experience"
Bridget W.,"Laguna Beach, CA",55,129,26,1.0,5/25/2010,"Ewwww.  Sorry for the immature description, but I could not find an adjective better than Ewwww because that is exactly what I said out loud when I ate at BJs in San Rafael. The man and I wanted a simple lunch in the midst of a very busy day.  We ordered what we thought would be a simple, deep dish pizza.  From the looks of the deep dish photo inside the menu, it did not look ""deep-dish"" .. it looked like a cake of bread with some cheese melted on top.  Now, I normally would never even eat at a restaurant that has photos of their entrees (rule #1) but I caved.  I also asked our waiter if the photo was indeed accurate, in which he replied, ""No, this is a classic deep dish pizza and we are famous for it."" Apparently, they are famous for the pizza, famous for getting it WRONG.  The pizza came out exactly as I had feared.  A 3-inch cake of pizza dough with some melted cheese and pepperoni on top.  Ewww is right!  As my palette has grown since 3rd grade, I no longer find this form of food enticing, nor do I like being lied to by a waiter I am paying to service my table. Please, please skip this monster of chain restaurants.  Honestly, I am shocked that this place is even in business."
Douglas W.,"Austin, TX",0,12,,1.0,7/4/2010,"As it was 4th of July, we thought it would be nice to head over to Bj's for some good American Food but to quote another review ""WORST BJ EVER"" We called an hour in advance to be put on the waiting list.  The waitress said there was no wait but she'd put us on the list anyways. Well, when we arrived, despite telling the hostess we were on the list, we were told to sit.  After 15 minutes of waiting and observing the seemingly empty restaurant with at least 15 open tables, we were seated in the back corner of the restaurant.  Sadly, we had forgotten our Parkas as we were seated directly under a blasting air conditioner. As we sat shivering, our first waiter came by with anything but a bright smile.  He obviously seemed stressed out by all 3 of his tables.  As we were still waiting for my mother (who was changing clothes), we asked for three waters and for him to come back in a few minutes to take our order.  Too bad he never came back.  He obviously was too busy not taking other people's orders as well. My mom eventually came back after changing clothes and making a few phone calls (as my friend and I sat around for 20 minutes waterless).  Once she returned, we spent the next 15 minutes trying to catch the waiters eye.  But nothing seemed to catch his attention...everything from the stink eye to borderline flirting proved to be useless.  He obviously was working extremely hard at ignoring us freezing customers in the corner.  Eventually, my usually meek mother went up to waiter to ask for help.  Luckily, he told us the manager would be over immediately to help us out.  We thought a free dessert would be in our future.  Which probably would have happened if the manager ever came.   Finally, waiter number 2 came along and asked us for our drink orders in which we proceeded to order our drinks, appetizers and meals scared he would never return.  One appetizer came out which I ravenously scarfed down (mediocre bruschette)....more waiting......then another appetizer came out finally....Too bad it wasn't ours.  Luckily, a customer a few tables down yelled ""Did you just say Mac & Cheese? ""  Once the waiter dropped it off and left, they told us over their half-eaten entrees ""That was supposed to be an appetizer 25 minutes ago."" The rest of the appetizers and food came out together.  Too bad we had nothing but our hands to eat the food.  Our first and second waiters had simply forgotten we were civilized people and needed silverware and napkins to eat.  Luckily, a wandering cook stopped by (SERIOUSLY....A COOK....NOT A WAITER) and gave us some utensils.         The Mac and Cheese people next to us overheard and said ""We must have the same waiter because our service has been that bad all night."" My mother loved the Shrimp Skewers and her quesadilla (the kitchen made her appetizer vegetarian upon request....this is where the 1 star comes in). My Tomato Basil in a sourdough bread bowl came lukewarm.  Something I probably could have gotten out of a can from Safeway .  And my friends giant Chili Baked Potato had a tiny portion of flavorless chili.  She almost unscrewed the salt shaker to give her potato any flavor (Makes sense why the cook was wandering around now since the potato probably was just microwaved instead). My mother flagged down waiter number 1 for some boxes and the check.  He ran to the back and never returned.  Waiter number 2 came back with our check but no boxes.....Maybe they were out since the first waiter hadn't returned?  When we asked him for boxes again, he walked 3 steps to grab them from waiter stand behind our table.  We left without any apologies, visits from the manager or even a Happy 4th of July. I have never given a review under 4 stars but I would have given them 0 stars.  Apparently though you can't do that on Yelp.  Sadly, nothing is exaggerated as we are all servers in the restaurant industry.  Maybe a waiter from the restaurant will see this review and realize they actually have a job to do....serve food. Happy 4th of July."
MM H.,"San Rafael, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/28/2014,"Does this place want our business or not? Love their burgers. Have not eaten in the restaurant for awhile, using predominantly the take out service which has been great. However, today (a Saturday) I went w/ a friend to eat inside. It was 12:30pm - 12:45pm:  lunch time. Entered main door. No hostess to be found. One couple already there, waiting also. Wait & wait. Another couple arrives, followed by a family. We wait, wait. Eventually a young woman comes. No apology for our having to wait. Takes her TIME logging onto the computer. She is incapable of simply asking how many in each party; instead, she must poke around and make (Lord knows what) entries into the computer. T-h-e-n, she made all of us wait while she ""organizes"" the menus. Slowly. We are all still waiting. FINALLY she begins taking each group to their table. The place is essentially empty. There is no excuse for all these delays and disorganization. We are the last couple to be seated. My friend reports that this same thing has occurred the last several times she has come in, no matter what time of day. The hostess is taking her time returning to get us. I finally spot her meandering (and I mean just that) back to us. I am now officially angry. I ask my friend if she wants to leave. She says yes, so we do. I'm pretty sure the hostess was clueless. Not going back."
Erin O.,"Rohnert Park, CA",30,2,,1.0,9/2/2012,"Went here for my best friends going away party. Fist off, We have eaten here many times, being that we work close to this restaurant. It's kinda a joke, if you want good food go to BJs, if you want good service go to Applebees. The service of our waitress Seirra is the worst we have ever had. Their was nine of us. They all trickled in at different times but we all ordered at the same time. We noticed her starting to get ticked off right off the bat as she asked us if we wanted to order For the 4th time before our guest arrived. Our guest came we ordered. No big deal. One of our guest had the wrong thing ordered and sent it back to get the right thing. She also ordered a pazooki to go and had it thrown on the table to her. We ordered another pitcher of beer and after 10 min. of waiting for it we asked again and she said ""Ya, it's on the way"" In a mocky tone of voice. After we were done with our meal we got the check. We told her we needed separate checks. She gave one of our guest a pen and told her to ""figure it out and write it on the back"" She gave snide looks at us the whole time, complained loudly to other co-workers and was very unprofessional. We also got gratuity added to the bill though there was under 10 of us. We were not suprised by this at the least. This is what BJs is about. They have very good food and the worst service I have ever come across. I hope the chefs get part of the tip, they are the only ones who deserve it."
Joy A.,"San Rafael, CA",9,9,12,1.0,8/26/2010,"I went to be BJs with my best friend to try the ever famous BJs Pizookie. After walking in and asking for a table for two we were offered the bar tables which we then denied. We then asked for a two top booth and we were told by the hostess there is no server on in the section hold on and another hostess can figure it out. The same hostess then proceeded to sit us at a half circle booth. Do these hostesses have multiple personalities since other people have experienced the doubling of the same hostess? Our server came over about five minutes later to take our drink orders then brought us our water 5 minutes later and took our order. Then telling us our pizookies would take about 7 minutes. I then asked the hostess for a kids menu to keep us busy while waiting she handed me one without crayons am I supposed to stare at it? 20 minutes later our pizookie arrived. Our server never checked back with us and eleven minutes later we FINALLY saw her again as she dropped off the check we never asked for. We then asked another server to find our server so we could pay she came back and said I couldn't find your server in the back.  Just today we decided to try take out considering dining in seems to suck with BJs hence the name I'm guessing. We ordered a classic baked potato no green onions add blackened chicken cheese and bacon, fettuccine Alfredo with chicken a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie and a meatball sandwich and was told they didn't serve a meatball sandwich anymore but it was clearly described under sandwiches on our to go menu which we pointed out and was finally told they'd make it we were told it would be about 15 min. 30 min later our food came out. We checked to make sure everything was there and left. We got home and the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken had hard noodles and no sauce half the pasta was dry. My classic baked potato which is described in the menu as butter sour cream and green onions had NO butter and NO sour cream only the added cheese and bacon for 1.95 more and the added blackened chicken i paid extra for. The pizookie was completely raw all the way through. In the restaurant it is served with two scoops of ice cream but to go is served with one on the side for the same price. The wings which were the only thing good about the lunch were fine. Which I guess is what you can take the one star for since there is no zero or negative stars allowed. We wasted our time and gas to go back and complain about the dry potato not including what was ordered and the raw pizookie to the manager as well as our complaint about our server and hostess the first time we came in. I asked for the manager and after asking twice he finally walked out fifteen minutes later. He like the servers didn't have a name tag or title so I don't know if he was an assistant manager or general manager and not introducing himself I don't even know his name. I told the manager our to go hostess told me when I told her about my potato not including butter and sour cream that ""she didn't know people ate butter and sour cream on their potato when they added other stuff"" I then said well if it's what I ordered you don't take it upon yourself to take it off unless I request it off. They didn't have name tags and we were told the names are on the receipts and we told him none of us received receipts with our to go orders which he then proceeded to say those can be produced at any time and are only given by request. So you can't check your order unless your request a printout to be able to check your order and see the servers name. I told him about the pizookie and he said they're not charging you for the second one are they? I said no but I'm still being charged for the first one that was raw. He said he would talk to the to go hostess Kristen to let her know that it's not okay to take items off people's orders without asking. And that he would take these complaints into consideration for moving on in the future. So no comp on the items that were the restaurants fault or for the next time visit that probably won't be happening? The management sucks and if I have free time soon I'll most likely be calling the district manager. Hopefully they can get someone with experience to turn that place and there servers and hostess's around."
Mary Ellen S.,"Novato, CA",0,11,,1.0,3/9/2011,"Unfortunately, this place is not worth it.  Save your money and go next door to Chipotle instead. We had dinner at BJ's last night, and it was terrible-not relaxing, wrong order delivered to our table, 1/2 hour wait for drinks to be delivered. The dessert that was delivered was also wrong, but by that time we just wanted to get out of the place. We did complain to the manager and she was very nice, but I would still suggest that you go to Chipotle."
Justin F.,"Rohnert Park, CA",6,83,1,4.0,6/8/2011,Service can be crappy depending on the server and host because sometime it just takes forever to get anything. The parmesean crusted chicken is realllly good. Best meal ive had in a long time. Pretty sure the veggies were frozen at one point though. I work in the same shopping center so I get bjs a lot  and ive had a really good experience with my meals being delicious.  The Beer is brewed in house and is some of the best in sonoma county. Overall id say there needs to be more restaurants with good food like bjs in the northbay. One of the top ten in northbay by far. And the pizookies are devine and a percent of the pizookie money earned goes to some local foundation...good job bjs!
Olivia N.,"Dublin, CA",19,84,14,4.0,6/24/2011,"I went with 7 friends for Happy Hour. It was before the rush so we were able to find plenty of seats. The waitress (we had 2) were nice and attentive. Our orders came out relatively fast. We each ordered an appetizer, and I got the shrimp lettuce wraps. The wraps tasted good, but were impossible to keep together and fell apart quickly. Maybe bigger leaves would help? Anyway, the atmosphere was okay if you're into sports. My first time at this branch and was an overall good experience."
