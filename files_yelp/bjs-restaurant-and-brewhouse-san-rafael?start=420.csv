Dave N.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,10,1,2.0,1/22/2011,"I've been there a half dozen times in the past few months, all for dinner, sometimes early in the evening and other times later.  The service is spotty -- sometimes okay and sometimes just really bad, like they've forgotten you're there.  Orders have been pretty routinely messed up.  The food is likewise inconsistent -- sometimes okay, sometimes less so, but never really good or great. Marin Brewing Company and Moylan's are far better choices."
Gabrielle C.,"Rockwall, TX",272,145,16,2.0,1/19/2010,"This restaurant reminds me of The Cheesecake Factory with better beer and worse food. The menu is practically identical but the food tastes better at Cheesecake. The service needs to be stepped up a notch but since they are new and it was packed, I'll be nice and say it was OK, not great, but OK. I do like the fact that it's a huge space and kid friendly but again, the food was totally ""average."" I think it's better to do fewer items better than a thousand items so-so. I'd be willing to try again some other time when the hype has disappeared and you can get a table in under 30 minutes."
Osgood F.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,,1.0,5/3/2012,"I know going in that this is not going to be a gourmet experience, so I am not disappointed by the food--it is what is is and doesn't pretend to be grand. Sometimes it's horrible and sometimes it's perfectly okay--one just needs to know what to order (stay away from the avocado rolls they promote, they are repulsive; avocados should never feel mushy and hot to the palate). It's the service which is deplorable and I blame management for this.  The service was clearly not designed by anyone who knows anything about the fine art of service.  The person who takes your order should be the one who serves your appetizers, entrees, desserts and the follow through with the check.   There is a preface, a middle and a conclusion--these plot points should be delivered by one person; not a track team passing batons. This way the server feels responsible for his/her clients' well being.  But BJ's implements this idiotic practice of having someone take your order which leads to a mish mash of a cast of characters wandering around aimlessly looking for a home for the dishes they are carrying and by the time they find that home, the homeless food is cold.   Want a good laugh?  Watch poor lost Biff wander around with four plates of food looking for its destination.  It's a comedy of errors if you're in a good mood, but rage inducing if you're starving and grouchy because of it. Then, if the server is lucky enough to find the table, he or she does not know who ordered what and has to ask the patrons which is a big no no.  BJ's flunks basic service 101, and I blame higher management for this, not the servers.   The hostesses are young and indifferent, and don't seem to be candidates for Mensa.  The managers are played by Claude Rains, famous for playing The Invisible Man."
An G.,"Oceanside, CA",2,12,,1.0,9/1/2014,"Where to begin. First I will say we have dined at many BJs locations and this was by far the worst and not up to the standard I was expecting. It's normally really good. This location would be closed where I come from. We were seated right away, which is good because that has never happened at any BJs I've been to (normally they are crazy busy), but bad because the place was empty (not a good sign). Though our waitress was really nice, we waited 10 minutes before we even got an acknowledgment. Finally we ordered drinks and food, 25 minutes later we got it. I ordered the Lemon Thyme chicken. Though the chicken was not dry, overall the food was not good quality. Everyone else had the opinion of ""meh"" on their food as well. No flavor, extra salty and blah/burnt. Though they are known for the pizza, not entrees. Service was uber slow (even though the place was empty). Add to that my daughter got lemonade that had no ice and was so warm, with condensation on the lid, I questioned if it had been sitting on the patio in the sun all day. It was 90 today. When we tried to return it for a new one, the same one was brought back with ice. The bottom of the drink was still warm, (imagine, hot lemonade). All in all, I will probably never eat at this location again. Applebees around the corner was better than this."
Natalie T.,"Rohnert Park, CA",10,9,1,2.0,9/28/2014,"I have nothing against the restaurant in general, but the service we received tonight was horrendous. I would like to start with the preface that I work in the restaurant business as a server as well, so I understand that it's very, very hard work. A friend and I went to BJs at northgate tonight and not only were we rudely greeted at our table, told that kitchen closed at 10:30 (when it actually closed at 11), but when we received our meal, it was upsetting. We opted to receive our full meal altogether (dessert and all) which wasn't a problem, but there was no chicken on the grilled chicken pasta, we ordered the mini pazookies and received full size (which we weren't looking to pay for), and then there was the french fry fiasco. We ordered a side of fries with our meal and it didn't come out, so when our server came to check on us she said they'd be right out with them. 5 minutes later she came to check on us again and said that she's so sorry they hadn't come out and she'd take them off the bill for us (which I assumed meant that we'd still receive them and she take the charge off for our inconvenience). After 10 more minutes of waiting AND our server dropping the bill, my friend approached the server and asked if we were still getting our fries, to which she rudely replied, ""No, we don't have any."" Uhhh, excuse me?? You didn't bother to tell us that 20 minutes ago?? Sorry BJs, it's not you, it was your evening shift bar server on 9/28 that just ruined my experience."
Nicole B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/12/2013,"Terrible customer service.  Went on Friday night and gave our name to the hostess.  She explained it would be a 20 minute wait because we were a party of 8 (4 adults and 4 kids).  I said if it would be faster to split us up we would be happy to do that.  After 30 minutes i went to check how much longer it would be and received the following response.  ""Oh, I'm sorry, we forgot that there was a large party ahead of you so it will 30-40 minutes longer.""  Needless to say I was furious. When I brought up splitting up the group  they first said yes, and then said no unless we put and adult w/ the kids.  Really?  When we complained to a manager he did nothing. Will try not to ever go back."
Leslina S.,"Sonoma, CA",37,34,,5.0,8/7/2011,Went here and loved it! Great friendly staff. Diverse menu with delicious vegetarian comfort food. We will be back for sure. Oh and the triple chocolate pizookie was awesome. nice atmosphere and decor. Thanks for a great dinner :)
Armando L.,"North Beach/Telegraph Hill, San Francisco, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/27/2013,"The service at the bar is awful as soon I've got there they quickly got my drink and that's good after that I had to ask for the menu, I choose what I want and before even they take my order the take the menu away to give it to someone else. Never came back to ask if I was ready to order, she ( as she was a female bar tender) start chatting with a couple and ignore everybody else for 15 min. I had to get her attention and finally ordered.  When my food arrived ( not the best pulled pork ever but just k) she never followed up to check if it was fine. To pay my bill it took 20 min as she was still chatting with that couple. And she laugh so damn loud that is annoying, you ain't gonna see me again on Sundays for sure"
T D.,"Berkeley, CA",0,153,1,1.0,4/3/2010,Area Manager prohibited staff from airing Final 4 game with audio on their big screen because she didn't think it was a big enough game. Don't come here if you want to watch sports cause you have to deal with the Muzak.  This is more of a Applebee's than a real microbrew when it comes to big time sports. Nothing like watching a Michigan State Final 4 with Billy Joel blaring on the speakers.
Kathryn R.,"Manhattan, NY",16,104,,3.0,1/12/2011,"Had dinner late last night and was pretty satisfied. I'm usually wary of places with huge menus (if they make everything, then they probably can't make everything WELL), but I was happy with their extensive wine and beer selections. Service was very fast (but it may be because we came in around 8:30), and food was good: we ordered some soups and both the salmon meals. I'm sure I'll be back, if not just for the beer."
E. R.,"San Rafael, CA",5,165,2,2.0,4/16/2010,"BJ's is nothing more than a fancier and bigger Applebees/McDonalds. Some things on the menu are okay, others are inedible. The pizookie is great and by far the best thing about BJ's. The food tastes plastic-y, they use a lot of oil. NEVER get the thin-cut fries, they are drenched in grease, the wedge-cut are a better option. Overall, it's processed greasy food. And it sucks that that's what we're stuck with in Terra Linda.  I don't care for their own beer, it has a soapy taste to me. But it's nice that they have a full bar with all the selections. The environment is nice, the building looks good and is probably the best thing going for Northgate Mall, the ""new"" restaurants all are terrible, especially health-wise.    Overall BJ's isn't bad, but there are better options in Marin such as Marin Brewing Company. BJ's is a chain, and with chains come chain food and service. (I'd go to BrewCo anyday over BJ's)"
Dave M.,"BELVEDERE TIBURON, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/26/2013,BJ's is amazing they have the NFL ticket which is one reason I love BJ's I also think they have great service which is another reason I like it here and then there food is spectacular they have amazing food especially desert for desert I would suggest the pazzooki because that is amazing when you taste it in all this is a great restaurant and I would love to comeback here a lot of times in the future
Frankie T.,"San Diego, CA",2,30,33,2.0,12/24/2012,"Had to stay close to the hotel in San Rafael as it was dumping down rain when we wanted to go for dinner with our group of 7.  Usually BJ's works in a pinch with a larger group, but tonight it must have been a full moon above the rain clouds.  Service was good and our waitress was very friendly and efficient.  Most of our meal turned out just okay.  I ordered my regular, the BJ Special pizza, thinking how could I go wrong.  This is my ""go-to"" pizz awhen I travel and am not familiar with a local pizza place.  Uh oh, the cheese was not melted on top and when I took my first bite into a usually good tasting and well cooked crust, it felt like i was eating pizza dough half cooked and it was mildly warm at best.  I have eaten at enough BJ's to know this might have been a one off but I was in the mood and left totally disatisfied.  BJ's Northgate might get one more chance in my books, but after some research I had some strong recommendations on other pizza joints in the neighborhood."
Joyce L.,"Novato, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/15/2014,"this was our first try at bj's...i  wish i had checked yelp before we went...every bad review is true,if not more.   we waited over 30 minutes to get tacos and a warm bowl of soup,not in the bread bowl i ordered.  i asked for a slice of lemon twice, and gave up.i found the fact that runners  served the food very cold,,  by this point i felt,the runners were to get all the flack.  our server never came near us until she gave us the bill.we eat out every mondayat northgate,but never at bj's again"
Mark K.,"San Rafael, CA",0,18,,3.0,5/22/2011,"Terra Linda (north San Rafael) doesn't have much in the way of good restaurants.   When BJs moved into town, I was so happy because ""breweries"" tend to have good food.   I've been to BJs more than 10 times and I'd say it is (overall) slightly above average.   If we had more choices in Terra Linda, I would not have gone here as much.     Good things:   full bar, many draft beers, consistent quality of food (good and bad), too many TVs, very good, mild chili, nice salads, BJs house-made beer is tasty  Bad things:   Too many TVs,  noisy, slow service, pizza is poor"
Adrienne L.,"San Rafael, CA",4,17,,2.0,1/26/2010,"The interior and  facade look really upscale but the service is extremely s  l  o  w.  We waited 45 minutes for our appetizers and then finally took it to go as our kids were just going crazy with hunger and boredom. Although it has a kids menu and crayons, with the long wait (both to get seated AND order food) and young, inexperienced waitstaff, it's not at all kid friendly, unless your kids are asleep.  The food was really bland and overpriced. The portions are huge but tasteless. I ordered the huge potato & chili and it really was just a huge plain baked potato with a pile of cheese and a few beans. So disappointed b/c the restaurant has so much potential but the waitstaff and hostess team are just inept. Definitely not worth it for the money, and time!"
Rob G.,"Petaluma, CA",0,37,1,3.0,2/3/2011,"Love the brews and the flat bread pizza app for a chain restaurant. If not a drinker, their root beer is excellent too. But its a chain restaurant and you have to account for that. Otherwise, pretty good."
Lorena K.,"Novato, CA",0,64,,4.0,10/28/2012,"I'm always impressed with BJ's food even though its menu is massive. It's good for families, large groups & for catching up with a friend over an ale. It's also fun to go there to watch sports on their large TV screens."
Diane B.,"Petaluma, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/7/2010,"Food was fine - service was TERRIBLE.  We went twice both for workday lunches about 3 weeks apart.  It was just a comedy of errors, both lunches should have taken no more than 45 minutes but we were trapped for 90 mins waiting for our server, waiting for our food (that come out all at different times) and then a long wait for the bill.  It was ridiculous. We will never go back."
t b.,"Decatur, IL",2,33,20,3.0,9/6/2010,"The ""white bread "" of pizza, soft and thick with a fairly light coating of topping. I believe we had a BJ's Favorite, usually a safe bet to go with one of the specials. It was OK. The first comment at the table, ""I've had better"". We did bypass the 40 minute wait by finding a table in the bar area. Pizza arrived about half way through the second beer, soon enough that we did not have to order another round. The Pale ale and IPA were both good! This place was new, clean and busy on a Saturday Night. Noise level was acceptable."
