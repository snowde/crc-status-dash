S D.,"San Rafael, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/19/2009,"Don't go to B.J.'s if you want to eat.  The waitress was great at taking orders - but not so much relaying them to the kitchen.  Is 1 -1/2 hour to long to wait for your food?  If not, then B.J's is your place.  My co-workers and I had to go back to work so the General Manager brought us our food to go and comped us. But let's say you don't mind waiting and waiting and waiting.  And waiting.   The food is mediocre.   I got fish sticks plopped in the middle of my ""fish"" tacos.  ""Panko-encrusted"" my ass.  Fish sticks.   It takes a lot to make Applebee's look good, but consider this - at least at Applebee's I didn't leave much hungrier than when I came.  The waiters take your order....and it comes!  Within an hour!"
Patricia D.,"Woodacre, CA",135,29,,2.0,12/20/2010,"Really bad then good. I came in on a date with my boyfriend  an hour before a movie to have some appetizers for lunch. As I walked in we passed to the hostess wondering what was taking so long to even say ""hi""..I wanted to see if there was any bar seating because from past experiences here the bartenders are the only fast or timely waiters. There was no bar seating but there was a booth in the area... I had let the manager know that I had really slow service in this place  the recent past. Let me clarify folks this was not the first time. He assured me that he was going to make sure that didn't happen and that hoped I would change my mind about BJ's in general. He said he would send the server right out and let them know about my concerns. The server came right out. A blond server (I didn't get her name nor would I list it) she seemed fine ( but a bit put out like it was a chore to help us a little faster than what  she's used to ) but asked us if we were ready after we literally had sat down for like 1 & 1/2 minutes...we both ordered drinks right away & I ordered an avocado appetizer (pretty good). My boyfriend asked for a little more time. When the server came back we ordered the rest of our appetizers and I specifically asked her for the check when the food came out as we were seeing a movie soon...she agreed to this...said ""no problem, my pleasure. After that, she pretty much dropped the ball and fell way short of excellent customer service. I figured a table that comes in tells you specifically what they want, pretty much orders right away & asks for the check right away would be the easiest table ever. I have waited on tables myself ( at many different restaurant mostly fine dining but one or two chains in the past) and to me that, with  my customer service background is ideal. The way she preceded to treat us was either because she was lazy, overwhelmed (& it was not packed in there), clueless, or stupid. But it was obvious to me that she didn't care. When she stops back at our table while we're eating the first appetizer...to ask us how we're doing and I can tell that everything I said to her was forgotten...I started to get a little worried and uncomfortable at the thought of reminding to do her job especially since after she left the last time we realized I had no silverware or napkins...we stopped her and asked for a napkin ( the cloth roll up with the fork & knife inside)...she rushed back with bar napkins and rushed away. Then our 2nd and 3rd appetizer came out and I still had no fork or knife I asked the busser that brought our food out if he would kindly get me a napkin with silverware please and he came right away with a genuine smile and a joke which definitely lightened up the mood of such bad service...I also asked him to remind our server that I had asked for the check. He was so nice but when she came back with the check she also brought two roll ups with silverware. I couldn't believe it. I was like is going on here and why do I feel like a guinea pig for her messing up during my lunch on my date?!  My boyfriend said to laugh it off because it was so ridiculous and almost comical how bad the service was after I had already said something of my concerns beforehand. I partly agreed with him but I was starting to get just really disappointed and my appetite to finish our food was decreasing and after the server came with the check I was just wanted to leave. The whole experience had been completely ruined for me and since it was my turn to pay the bill I especially felt robbed for having been treated or neglected so bad. I usually tip really well. I left a $3 tip for the crappy server and I shouldn't have even left that.  In conclusion I was so displeased that after our meal I spoke briefly with the manager about the horrible performance and experience and  actually gave a $5 tip to the manager give to the wonderful busser/ or food expediter who was really the only person that ""took care of us"" that we could see.  I appreciated the manager being concerned but I had to leave to catch the movie and I was way to upset to address the situation that day. The next day I called and spoke with their senior manager who exemplified all the classic signs of excellent customer service. He promised to address the concerns of such inexcusable behavior and tried to rectify my dissatisfaction and offered me a way of compensating for my bad experience which made me feel better and not so taken advantage of. I just hope the service there improves because it's convenient to stop by when we're at the mall or seeing a movie and the food is not that bad. i just want to come in and relax and not worry about telling a server to do their job and not ruin my experience there. We'll see I give them another chance because it is in my neighborhood and I want to like their establishment. The fact that the manager addressed and dealt my complaints really does make me feel better and makes all the difference:)"
Kira M.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,27,2,1.0,4/5/2010,"Unfornately I will never go to another BJ's again.  I understand that it can get busy sometimes and service can slow because of that, but It wasn't busy when we went. The food was ok, but cold and we had 3 or 4 different servers, none were very friendly or attentavive.  So we came in about 8 pm for dinner. There were 4 of us and we ordered a three corse meal.  the first server took our dink order and our meal order, then we never saw him again. So our appatizer came out in about 10 min which was expected, but we still had no dirnks. The kid who brought the apps took our drink order again and went and got the drinks. We waited for the beverages to come before we ate the apps. about 30 seconds after the drinks arrived someon else had brought out our salads, which we were not ready for yet. This was about 8-10 minutes after the apps had come out. they also forgot one salad.  At this point the tabe was full with our salads drinks and appatizers and plates. They brought the missing salad once we had finished the appatizer. Not one minute later they brought our dinners. We hadn't even got to our salad yet. We had only been there maybe 25 minutes at this point. No one ever came buy the table again until they brought the check, without asking if we needed anything else.  We  wanted to eat our salads before they got soggy from the dressing, so in the meantime our dinner's had become cold, although the fries were cold when they arrived.   The service is some of the worst i have ever experienced, and even if the food is ok I can't get over how bad the service is. I have worked in the reaustrant industry for many years, and I know it really isn't that difficult to give good service. I understand that it nice to get off early sometimes, but don't be lazy and give bad service so you can go home. This  is part of the job people!!   Oh and there were people being seated still after we left. I would have told the manager but ther wasn't one to be found. Don't waist your money here. If you want a chain reaustrant go anywhere else!!"
Ronald N.,"Hercules, CA",201,399,94,3.0,9/2/2010,I only been there once. I only go there if I need a good place to eat at in the area. Not bad service. It can be hard to get help but I got use to be patience.
William B.,"Petaluma, CA",4,22,,4.0,12/3/2012,This place is good to go with friends. They have pretty good beer and service. The food isnt great but its good.
Goldfishka F.,"Larkspur, CA",5,29,,2.0,10/10/2011,"Service: very slow (how about 2.5 hour for dinner?), wrong, awkward. Food is OK, but heavy, unhealthy. I am in business trip with some men, and they are just glazing on TV's and enjoying huge tasteless dishes and beer, so I have to be here again and again. Probably I will protest next time."
Bre E.,"Hercules, CA",50,50,12,1.0,1/16/2010,Been here twice. Both on weeknights and boy are there still alot of people there. Food...not good..average at best. The service...BAD! Meet up with friends Thursday night. They got there promptly at 7:45..me and the BF showed up at 8:10. My friends say the waiter came by..got their drink and appetizer orders and never came back. WTH. We waited another 10 minutes before we flagged down a waitress. Told her what happened so she waited on us. What a joke. Completely unorganized and food is not worth the wait or hassle. Go to Marin Brew Co. or Cheesecake factory instead. Only reason to visit is for the Pazookie.
Tanya D.,"Benicia, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/17/2011,"i have to admit, I'm in general not a big fan of big chain restaurants. I did the to-go, and Charlie was awesome. Sweet, sweet guy."
Clair C.,"Novato, CA",8,67,10,5.0,6/7/2010,"My previous visits (and review) were not flukes. I have been about 5 times since and still have had amazing food and service. Try the avocado spring rolls! Yummmm! ...and as always, the beer is amazing!"
Dave C.,"San Francisco, CA",77,40,1,2.0,1/18/2010,"Good food, okay drinks (don't order a Mojito), but what I thought was totally crazy was what happened when me and a large group decided to go there to watch the BCS Championship (Texas-Alabama). This place has a 103inch screen at the bar, lots of 50inch screens everywhere and there is a great speaker system, so of course it seemed like the perfect place to go.. EXCEPT they have a policy they can not turn on the sound to the game... how crazy is that??? All these screens, all those speakers, and no audio?? They have a policy that so they are not percieved as a sports bar that they do not play game audio for any game other than the super bowl... My argument that the BCS Championship is the college equivalient of the superbowl was not good enough... ohh well.. otherwise, service was great ..."
Rick G.,"San Rafael, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/5/2012,"Not enough stars to describe this place. Even my kids like it and they hate everything.   The food is even better than the service. Try the jumbalaya, yum. I am going back today for some Mahi, Mahi and clam chowder in a bread bowl, (then go to the gym tomorrow). I talked three buddies into going to a Sierra Nevada pairing there a few weeks ago. 5 coursed and 7 beers. It was Much more than we expected for $30, tax included. It may be loud to some but I think it's a fun atmosphere. The location is convenient with plenty of parking. The best Brew pub in Marin by far."
Robert E.,"Marin, CA",19,11,,4.0,2/28/2010,"While it's true there is a long wait, even if you call first to get on the list, and the service can be slow, I like this place.  After they brought each of our dinners 30 minutes apart, which was very unorganized, the manager came over and apologized, reheated my pizza and comped one of our dinners and gave us 2 extra beers. That made me happy because their beer is the best. And we were in no hurry so we got a great dinner and a great price! Both times we have been there, our waitress has been rushed but very friendly and helpful."
Brian C.,"Sausalito, CA",0,53,2,3.0,7/31/2010,Something (probably management) has happened since my last review. We decided to try one more time...and there was quite an improvement in service and the time it took for our meal to arrive. I'm glad someone at BJ's is listening.....
Just B.,"Alameda, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/23/2012,"This is a bad restaurant and our experience with their customer service is the worst.  We were there last Saturday, 9/22 at 2pm.  Our waiter basically took our order and gave us our bill.   He never came by to ask us ""how is everything and is there anything I could get for you?""  We had to ask another waiter just to get condiments and drink refill.   The hostess was no better - as she finished seating a party, I asked her to locate our waiter.  Her response was ""when I have a moment"".  Are you kidding me!!  It was 2pm; the restaurant was not full and no one was waiting to be seated.  She walked back to her station to chat with her fellow hostess.   I asked another waiter to speak to the manager and he/she never came to our table.  After 15 minutes we paid our bill (of course, we gladly did not leave a tip) and left.   Usually a restaurant will have a bad hostess OR a bad waiter OR a bad manager - this restaurant manages to have all three!!!!"
Alex S.,"San Ramon, CA",9,168,1,3.0,3/4/2010,"I had lunch here to today with a lawyer buddy and the place was packed!  I've been to the one located in my old neck of the woods (Irvine, CA) and I must say it brought back a lot of good memories.  The food is pretty good and with all the flat screen TV's I can only imagine how is place will be on football Sunday's!  Come here to checkout the games and have some brews....."
Sandy S.,"Novato, CA",0,14,,4.0,5/17/2010,"This is a fun place!  I love being able to try a shot of their beers before selecting.  It makes experimenting much more likely!!  The food menu is extensive, so far in two visits, I haven't made it past the appetizers and salads.  They are awesome. I would give this 5 stars based on what I have tried except for the service....slow.  Very friendly service staff just incredibly slow."
Anonymous R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",33,12,2,1.0,2/3/2011,"I enjoy the atmosphere of this place, but honestly this is the place to go if you have more than 1 and a half hrs to spare! Great Food, but to be completely honest the service is really bad!"
Peter E.,"San Rafael, CA",11,77,10,3.0,1/29/2010,"Great sports bar. Probably one of the best in Marin County. Too big without personality though. Everything feels ""mechanical"" in here. Where is the warmth and the cosy atmosphere?"
Heather M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,2.0,6/16/2010,"Food and service speed were abysmal.  Our waitress was nice but all ther other serving staff were indifferent, borderline rude.  The decor is rather nice and it looked like the bar (primarily a sports bar dominated by a gargantuan flatscreen) was OK.  I will not be eating here again, nor will I be recommending this place to friends."
Stephanie B.,"San Rafael, CA",1,26,,3.0,3/28/2012,I have been back to Bj's and I think it looks as though they worked out some staffing issues and the restaurant appears to be running better than during our first visit.
