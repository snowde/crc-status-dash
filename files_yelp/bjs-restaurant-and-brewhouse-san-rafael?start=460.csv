Ahna P.,"Novato, CA",41,303,11,4.0,11/3/2009,"I LOVE their BBQ chicken chopped salad! I was really excited to hear their happy hour is 3-7, we'll be back to check that out. We went on their first day open, so the bar area was total chaos. Service was friendly and the food was good. Great alternative to the basic brew pub gub."
Dasisters D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,32,,3.0,12/5/2009,"Food is good but service is lame. We called 30 minutes before we arrived and they said we still have to wait for 20 minutes for our seat.  They offered us the outdoor seats (40 degree) and we agreed.  Luckily, we were able to move inside - after 30 minutes sitting outside - BUT our food came 45 minutes after we ordered. Yaiks. Not sure if I go back to this place next time."
Alexandra M.,"Tiburon, CA",1,43,65,1.0,12/2/2009,"I called ahead at 6 pm and they said it would be a 20 minute wait and they would put me on the list. I got there at 6:10 and there were plenty of empty tables.  We were seated right away. I can't imagine why they would say they had a wait with that many empty tables.  I tried the lightest beer and my friend had a darker beer. Both were very good. Although, the server pitched the pumpkin beer so we got excited and ordered it but oops.... they were out.  We started with the chicken lettuce wraps that were overly greasy. Then I had the balsamic chicken which was really charred and the pieces were thin and small.  I probably ate three bites.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich which he enjoyed and the skinny fries which the waitress recommended.  The fries came out luke-warm and had no flavor.   Servers could use additional training... when the server asked if I wanted a box to take my food home and my friend politely told him a box was unnecessary because I did not like my food the waiter said Ok and walked away."
Cindy R.,"Novato, CA",0,14,,4.0,4/2/2010,This is my second time at BJ's. Much better then the last time. Service and food was much better. Had the Chinese Chicken Salad. My favor place to have Chinese Chicken Salad is in Hawaii. I have tried many and no one has compare until now. I am happy to know where I can get my Chinese Chicken Salad fix. My husband had one of your flat breads and it also was great. We'll be back.
Mark R.,"San Rafael, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/31/2012,"I have to say I keep trying this place because they are open late have good beer. The main problem with this place is the service, It's terrible!! The wait staff are slow and not trained on how to really give great customer service. On one occasion it took over 20 mins to get a drink when we were one of maybe 3 tables. The bad service is not just on the waiters either. On another painfully slow occasion we had not been helped for 15 mins and when I looked over to one of the computer terminals, there must have been 3 wait staff and as many managers laughing and joking not paying any attention to the floor.  I actually had to get out of my seat and go ask for service! For as long as BJ's has been open they should have worked out how to properly run the place. It's a shame as it has the potential to be a great place. The food so far has been good (I haven't tried that many dishes) the beer selection is fantastic and the pizookie is amazing, but until they figure out how to sort out the service issues it will always be that maybe once a year place and not a regular hangout!"
Steve L.,"San Rafael, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/12/2012,"I love BJs. Really good food, especially their deep dish pizza. Amazing. Not sure why people are saying bjs has bad customer service. I have gone over 20 times to bjs and have never once had a bad waitress. PS Try the Pazookis ;P"
Rochelle L.,"Springfield, MO",0,26,1,2.0,4/7/2011,Let me start by saying the only reason I go to BJ's is because they have Pyrmid hef on tap.  The food  is generic chain food not great could be worse.  The service could really use some help.  Last night I had the wrong beer delivered to me and I had to plead my case.  Finally I got my beloved creamy Hef and was much happier after that.  If they didn't have Pyrmid I wouldn't go.  I personally am an avid beer taster and i really don't like any of the house beers.  Moylans has better beer and food.  I do how ever like the amount of tv's they have for catching a game on.  Marin lacks in good places to eat in general.
Steven D.,"San Rafael, CA",1,38,,1.0,10/19/2011,I am no longer going to the BJ's in San Rafael Terra Linda Mall. They too many mistakes.
Sarah M.,"San Rafael, CA",11,8,2,3.0,12/15/2009,"I went to BJ's with some friends at 9pm on a Sunday night a few weeks ago. We went for beers before a movie. The waiter was SO slow! I've never experienced a slower waiter. You would think that when 3 people are ordering beers, it wouldn't take 15 minutes to bring them. The restaurant was half full and had plenty of staff to handle the volume of customers. 2 more friends joined us 5 minutes before our beer came and it took 10 minutes before their order was taken and an additional 10 minutes to bring their beer. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is that the beer was really good and the price was reasonable. The service would be 1 star."
Thorby B.,"Novato, CA",1,102,4,4.0,6/18/2011,"After all the negativity, I was not expecting too much.  Was there during off-hours (mid-way between lunch/dinner).  Service was excellent and attentive.  And.....very surprised to say.....the pizza was EXCELLENT.  Best I've had....and I'm difficult to please when it comes to GOOD pizza.  Will return and I hope the experience is similar; with all the negative reviews for this place, not sure if I just lucked-out or if things have changed for the better.  But a definite ""thumbs up"" for the experience, the service, the cleanliness and the food."
Vanessa B.,"Petaluma, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/13/2011,"I must say that I have never had such horrible service. The restaurant is very nice, I liked the items on the menu, and I did kind of enjoy my food, but waiting for over an hour is a bit ridiculous. First of all, I expect to get my drink before my meal or at least when my meal is being served but I guess I should not have expected much when I ended up waiting almost 40 minutes for my meal. Finally, a meal but no drink. Thus, I had to re-ask for my drink when I was served my food. When I realized 15 minutes later that it was not coming I went up to the bar and asked for it there. They did not provide me with one, but told me that they will alert the waitress, so I instead asked for the manager. In a few minutes, he finally did bring me my drink, but it was the wrong one. 25 minutes after I received my meal, I finally got my soft drink. I ended up being even more disappointed because my food was very cold by the time I took my first bite. I just do not understand how difficult it is to bring a paying customer what they order. What was worse is the waitress became very rude after the manager was sent to our table. Overall, not matter how much I may like the menu, I will never be returning due to the service. I refuse to pay to wait that long and I feel as if I did more work than the waitress. She should have tipped me for trying to provide myself with my own drink."
Adam S.,"San Rafael, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/23/2010,"I love Pub/Brewery food, it is always the best. If you want that style food in this area, go to Moylans. Seriously, the food here was ok at best, and our server, Max was a nice guy and I had no quarrels with him. What really got me though was this; Friday night at about 8, we arrive and are told that there would be about a 30 minute wait for a table of 4. We agree and are handed our buzzer. We sit not more than 5 feet away from the girl who just put our names in the computer, and after 50 minutes of waiting, and watching several groups we were certain arrive after us get seated, we ask what the problem was and why our name had never been called or our buzzer activated (We had heard other party's called by name over the loudspeaker) The girl says our names aren't in the computer, and at this point the GM walks up and asks what the problem is. We tell him and he makes us out to look like the jerks by saying ""Oh well we will seat you right now,"" and turns to the other group and says ""You have to wait, these people need to be seated"". We got glares from that group...The GM then proceeded to try and offer us free appetizers or drinks. I didn't come to get looked over by a dumb hostess and be condescended by the GM and then offer us some pity appetizers. Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to this BJs. If Max does happen to see this, it's not your fault, your service was fine, just a shame you are working for such a poor company when it comes to customer service :\"
TXSebas T.,"Corte Madera, CA",212,39,1,2.0,9/5/2011,"Substandard bar food, offset partly by friendly staff, large screen TVs with Giants games, and some decent beer.  Even my kids don't like the food much.  Hoping for better in central Marin."
Barbara B.,"San Rafael, CA",0,1,,1.0,9/2/2010,"Not the first time, but once again service was TERRible!!!  Not crowded, got there a little after noon today, it took 1 1/2 hours for just soup and salad...TWIce the soup was barely warm.  In addition to forgetting stuff and taking forever, we asked one guy (there are TONs of people who work there) if we could speak to the manager...nothing.  No one comes, second time different person, manager comes and says the soup should have been hot, as it's on a high heat.  We said ""Exactly.""  There was no excuse when it's not busy during the week."
Maria M.,"Northern California, CA",61,181,129,1.0,1/25/2010,"Okay, maybe this is akin to reviewing a McDonald's and it is a no brainer.  I had no idea what this place would be - could have guessed by the crowd, beepers for table waits, huge bar and dispoportionate focus on alcohol, but I was hopeful there just might be something remotely edible....Nondairy creamer for creamer?! In Marin???? If I was at an airport this might get two stars. Food was processed, bland, except that the cheese in my airplane quality Cobb salad was really off - the waiter did not even ask why most of it was left but by the time he deigned to get to me with the check I was so ready to get the heck out of there I did not even broach the subject.  Busboy insisted that nondairy creamer was all they had until I pinned him down on the fact that they served milk as a beverage and suggested he could bring a bit of that for my terrible Maxwell House coffee... Acoustics horrible. A big cattle call. Don't waste your money.  As an aside I just have to wonder with all the poor reviews why a four star review shows up on the list.before a chronologically later written one star review...under yelp sort...fishy...."
Joe F.,"San Rafael, CA",0,19,,1.0,6/29/2010,"Gave them another try. Same thing. Slow service, food comes out at different times, wrong items brought to table. Food was actually quite good but IMO, it's not worth the hassle to wait and wonder if and when your food will get there and if it will be what you ordered. management REALLY needs to be changed or at least taken to task by corporate at this location. I'll not likely be back."
Mark E.,"Novato, CA",78,4,,2.0,2/24/2010,"Took the fan here on Sunday night for the third time. I looked and saw all the poor reviews about wait times, and I chalked it up to bad experiences for those people. Isolated issues.  However to my dismay, this seems to be a real problem here now.  We called ahead as the hostess told us to, but that didn't help. We had to wait aost a half hour. I am a patient person, but with two three year olds out after bedtime, it started to he a nit much.  Once we were sat, the waitress took our order (we had plenty of time at the hostess station to peruse the menu), and then made us wait 15 minutes for our drinks. Then almost another half hour fir the food.  Eating out should be pleasant and relaxing, this was just tiring.  The food: Wife and mother in law had the shrimp tacos. No raves. No complaints.  The kids had the Kraft mac and cheese, so...they liked it.  I had the chicken Alfredo pizza. I have had a few pizzas here in the past, and u enjoyed them. This was lacking in any flavor other than copious amounts of garlic. Which I guess was the pizza cooks idea on how to try and hide the overly cooked and dry chicken.  With little kids in Marin our options are limited, and we were glad to have some place new to go, but it seems that BJ's has decided to rise just to their neighbor Apple bees standards. I don't like eating there, and I don't think I will be eating at BJ's much either. I don't like to complain, and maybe waiting an hour for food predisposes one to have a bad experience, but this was a waste of money."
Gayle M.,"San Rafael, CA",2,20,,1.0,12/27/2010,We dropped in for lunch and we ordered everything at the same time because we were starving. Our food arrived but our cocktails did not arrive until after we ate. They train their staff very well but really a martini just doesn't work after lunch.
Carol M.,"Richmond, CA",2,27,1,4.0,12/19/2010,"Great service, very friendly and attentive.  Really enjoyed my southwest chicken sandwich -the dessert was yummy, a strawberry short cake thing.  will return for sure"
Mike M.,"Kentfield, CA",1,62,,5.0,11/4/2009,"My wife kept telling me about this new restaurant in Terra Linda called BJ's, so we went to go check it out last night. Strange name aside, I was surprised by the atmosphere and sheer size of the place. I literally felt like I was in the city (SF-Jillian's anyone) and was instantly happy a place like this had finally made it to Marin. Thank you! The owners did a great job decorating the place with super high ceilings, hand painted murals and a very cool custom bar! Large TV's are scattered throughout and this would make a great place for a sports fan. We were told the wait would be about 15 minutes but we were seated in five, this place was buzzing on a Wednesday night. As we followed the hostess to the table I quickly glanced at everyone's food and it all looked good. I ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls and BJ's combo pizza, and my wife had the Fish Tacos. Everything was great! The Egg Rolls had a perfect spicy zip to them and were accompanied with a great honey dipping sauce. The pizza was a puffy, deep dish pizza with great toppings.  And the tacos were good, although I prefer grilled or baked fish as to fried. We also tried the beer sampler and the Blonde, Hefeweizen, Pale Ale and Stout were our favorites. We felt the other beers were a little too sweet for our tastes. They also make their own soda drinks, which is pretty cool. They accommodated our one year old very well. Go check it out, and definitely make reservations!"
