Tony T.,"San Francisco, CA",0,88,4,2.0,11/7/2009,"just got back from a Saturday night at BJ's and they are not ready for prime time yet.  the service was extremely slow, and the wait staff was confused.  during the course of our meal, we had 3 different waitresses, and all acted like they were our primary server.  it took about 45 minutes to get our meal after ordering.  we were offered a comped item to make up for the delay, yet it still showed up on the bill.  we were told that the kitchen was ""chaos""....probably best to not mention that.  anyway, i hope to be able to follow up with a more positive review down the line, but at this point avoid during busy times."
Candace J.,"San Rafael, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/13/2009,"On entering the establishment tonight, I was shocked to see the amount of people piled into the small lobby.  The decor brought to mind a more popular chain in Marin, Cheesecake Factory.  I could definitely tell that the seating desk in the front was swamped with unhappy and grumpy folks waiting to be seated.  I tried to keep an open mind and not be to tough on the ladies and one gentlemen at the front.  They seemed to be doing their job as quick as possible.  I waited over 70 minutes before they called my husbands name and I was finally seated.  The host was a young Asian male who was extremely polite and made me a feel a little better by holding a genuine conversation with my party as he was seating us.  It was unfortunate that he couldn't serve us as well.  The food was mediocre but I had to say the pumpkin ale was delicious as well as the deep dish pizza.  The burgers were not that tasty and seemed like a menu item that could be served at a Denny's.     During my dining experience, I noted that a few of the servers did not look happy to be there and lacked the personality I've seen at the BJ's restaurant in the San Francisco area.  Also, please note that the takeout area is understaffed with only one to two persons there when I was inquiring about takeout procedures.  There were two males working there and the shorter of the two was rather rude to me and ignored me as he walked out instead of answering my question.   It seems like BJ's still needs to work on their customer service and training the staff to better fit the needs of the customer.  The food was decent enough and the friendliness of my seater and the front desk made my experience more bearable. If you don't have the patience to wait and dislike the loud sports bar type environment, do not come here EVER!"

Alex L.,"San Rafael, CA",4,50,,3.0,1/24/2010,"Been here a few times, only ate once.  Food was cool, not bad.  Food variety is great.  Service isn't bad, but I don't wait to be seated, I just head straight to the bar.  Overall, not a bad place to grab a few drinks, and finally there is a place open past 10pm in the TL area."
myles M.,"San Rafael, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/30/2010,"Bj's is a very nice looking restaurant and bar. They did a great job with the look and feel of the place. Unfortunately, that's where the good planning stopped. It takes forever to get seated. We called ahead and got on the list. At the time the Hostess said 20 minutes. When we got there she said 20 minutes and it took an hour. After waiting 30 minutes to order the food came 40 minutes later. I would say that the quality of the food was poor. The food had been reheated several times. You have to beg for refills of your drinks. I differ with other reviews that said BJ's is kid friendly. By the end of our 3 hour dinner our kids were spent and lying on the floor. To top it all off we asked for our bill several times and it never came. We ended up leaving our credit card number with the Hostess and coming back later to pay. We should have just walked out."
Urban Zen M.,"San Rafael, CA",1,9,,5.0,12/4/2009,"This place was amazing!  We had to wait a few minutes to get a table, but it was worth it!!  The restaurant had a hip vibe and lots of energy.  I loved that we were able to stay in and have a few drinks in the beautiful bar.   There really are not a lot of places to go in mid Marin for this kind of eating experience,  so it's super that the newly remodeled Northgate Mall now has this caliber of place to go.  I heard that BJ's is the fastest growing and most successful chain eatery at the moment.  Worth the wait.  Fun time. Great Food.   Will definitely be going back."
Colleen M.,"San Rafael, CA",0,8,,3.0,11/12/2009,"I would give it 4-5 stars on the food.  Lunch is very reasonable, especially the mini pizza and salad special for $5.95.  We got there right when it opened at 11 and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated and then about another 20 to be served.  But it was Veterans Day and the place seemed filled to capacity.  Great atmosphere, lots of tv's and a great selection of beer."
Emily V.,"San Rafael, CA",1,8,,1.0,9/18/2010,"I have to say that the food from BJs is amazing!  The service on the other hand, is some of the worst I have ever experienced, and it wasn't on one occasion.  The service is bad every time I go.  It is a shame because the food is so good.  My advice would be order to go.  My sister, my two nieces and I ate there three days ago.  We were seated in a section where no one else was.  The waitress seemed very attentive at first, but when the rest of the tables in her section were filled, she could not keep up.  All the dishes were brought at different times, and the drink my sister ordered came half way through the meal.  When ordering a hamburger and fries, I expect ketchup to be brought to my table.  So when it wasn't, I tried to find someone to bring us some.  Everyone in that restaurant walks around with their head in the air.  No one would even glance at our table.  It's like they purposely don't make eye contact so they won't have to address your needs.  I finally asked a bus boy for ketch up and he looked at me like I asked him for a hundred dollars.  He proceeded to say yes, and never returned with it.  My sister had to get up and go get some herself.  I did not want to stay for desert, and the pizookie is really why I eat at BJs.  When we finished our meal, we were waiting a good ten minutes for someone to clear our table and ask us if we'd like desert.  I had to line our dishes at the edge of the table for anyone to clear them.  Like I mentioned, I didn't want to stay for desert, but desert came with my nieces meals.  So we stayed for them to eat it, but as soon as their deserts arrived I asked for the bill.  God knows how long it would have taken if I hadn't asked for it.  Needless to say that waitress did not receive the tip she could have received.  I'm sorry, but tips are something that are earned, not just given.  From having worked in a restaurant I know tips are split among the staff that helps you.  So therefore it is not just the waiter/waitress who needs to be on their game, it's the bus boys and so on.  I suggest hiring more experienced servers instead of kids who don't know what they're doing.  I just read a past review that said the staff looks like they're pissed off to be there, and I have to agree.  They totally look like they hate their job.  At a time like this be thankful you have a job!"
Anton M.,"Novato, CA",242,6,,2.0,12/21/2009,"It was my first time eating at BJ's, and I was sadly disappointed. The large open dining hall and clean furniture gives it a good appeal, but everything else seemed lacking. We were seated relatively fast, considering how busy it was, and our server introduced herself to us. this would be the last time our server would say more than 5 words to us. The tv's were way to high up on the walls to even make out the scores of the games, so unless your at the bar don't expect to pay full attention to who's beating who. The waitress mixed up my drink with my fathers, a simple mistake, but when we asked for some sugar it took about 10 minutes to get to us. We then were given a clam chowder, which we never ordered. Turns out it was for the table next to us, and since we didn't touch it our neighbor took it willingly. The same table next to us was seated about 5-10 minutes after us, but they were nearly done with their meal before ours came. My california chicken sandwich was good, but the wedge fries that it came with were cold. Is it that hard to heat up frozen fries?? My father's burger looked mediocre at best, oozing with oils and grease. Overall, i was disappointed and still debating whether I would return again. Typical pub food."
Lisa L.,"Novato, CA",0,19,,2.0,11/19/2009,"Arrived A@ 11:45am, party of seven. Ordered food by noon, all of us ordered water. @ 12:30pm, I looked around the restaurant and peeps that were seated after us were eating. The waitress Sara walked up to the table after being called over by a person in our party and said our food would be right up, that was her only other contact with us. Water wasn't refilled and she never came to tell us where our food was. 12:45pm, still waiting. Finally called for the manager. Mario came to our table and we expressed our concern about not getting served and we had been there for over an hour. He went to check on our order.  He came back and said the order would be right out. 1:10pm still waiting...we asked to have all our meals put in to-go boxes. Of course the general manager paid for our meal. I feel that he should have given each of us a gift card for a return visit. Sara never came back to our table to appologize for her mistake that the order was never placed. This was my third visit to BJ's. 1st time was the free meal. I ordered the Jambalya which was good, needed more flavor. 2nd time was bar service only. Service was terrible. I was quoted several prices on beer. I was standing next to a table and the servers kept using it as a passage way, which it wasnt.  3rd visit I thought would be better, but it wasn't.  By the time I was able to eat my meal back @ the office, the fries were soggy and the fish & chips were cold.  No silverware or condiments were given to us. Not sure how the take out section of the restaurant is."
