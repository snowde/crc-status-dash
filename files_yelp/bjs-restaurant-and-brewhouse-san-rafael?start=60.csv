Sam T.,"Pelham, NY",71,11,,3.0,11/30/2016,"An above average food and beer kind of sports bar. My girlfriend and I come here several times a month and it's always consistent. The food is nothing to write home about, but it's definitely good and a few of the items are very good. I definitely recommend the boneless chicken wings (buffalo or sriracha dry rub), the Salmon Quinoa bowl and of course the Pizookie! As many people below mention, the service is sometimes a little lacking but it's more common than note that it's a good experience. Would give a 3.5 if I could."
Mark N.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,,1.0,9/17/2017,"Zero stars. Management needs to teach these rich, spoiled, entitled teens a thing or two about customer service. But, then again, management is a bunch of Millennials who know nothing about customer service. Worst service ever."
David F.,"Concord, CA",53,372,1592,4.0,5/4/2015,"In San Rafael for the weekend, we stopped by BJ's on a Saturday night, not knowing what to expect. Even though we were early, and there were no big games, it was pretty packed. Yelp says the noise level is ""average"" -- true, if average is a dull roar. It was definitely loud in there. BJ's seems to be a cross between a sports bar and a family restaurant, and judging by the quite varied demographics eating here, they are pulling it off. Big-screen TVs line both walls the length of the restaurant, not just above the bar. This actually is kinda cool: I liked checking out the A's game at points during dinner. So even though we are not typical sports bar people, other than the noise, it wasn't a bad experience. The true surprise was the food: it was both reasonable and quite good. They actually had one of my favorite meals, clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, and they pulled it off. The chowder was excellent and the bread was freshly delicious. My wife had Mediterranean tacos, and thought they were quite good aside from the cilantro. My clam chowder bowl was $9 and the Mediterranean tacos were $9.50. A super value at that price for the quality. Quiet, intimate dining, this isn't. But good food at a reasonable price, and being able to watch a few games as a bonus -- it works!"
chris c.,"San Rafael, CA",7,19,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Earlier tonight I had my second bad experience at this restaurant, and I'd like to write up why I'm not going back.  The short of it:  I just paid full price for food I didn't eat, and my gf and I ended up sharing her food. Pitiful. Date night, 9:30pm.  We arrived to a half empty restaurant and full waiting area.  The hostess eventually got to us and then seated us about 5 minutes later.  We'd requested a specific type of table (many of them available) and the hostess apologized for forgetting when we reminded her after she tried to seat us at the table we'd specifically requested she avoid.  No biggie, but not a good start. It took 15-20 minutes for our server to get to us, and we ordered drinks and entrees in one go.  The poor lady was doing her best to cover a huge number of people, and she apologized for the ""ridiculous wait."" Our food was dropped off about ten to fifteen minutes later.  My girlfriend got some burger thing that was pretty good.  I got a California Club, and it was  gloppy with cheese, soggy with something else, limp and yet also stale/overwarmed, and somehow still lacking in flavor.  I decided to send it back and have them refire it or send out something else, but alas, I wouldn't see my server again for 25-30 minutes, and every attempt at waving her or another incredibly overworked server down went unheeded.  I had some of my fries but hardly touched the club sandwich, and ended up eating some of my gf's burger.  Super rude of me, but I was hungry and had waited long enough. Eventually my server came back, about ten to fifteen minutes after we'd finished, and asks if we need a box in addition to the check.  I said we didn't need a box because it was bad, pointing to my nearly untouched sandwich.  She disappears for a good while before picking up my card and charging the full amount for the meal. After I've paid she finally asks what wasn't great, and we told her. She later offers to bring us a cookie dessert, but dinner was already well past over for my gf and I still hadn't had a real meal, so we declined.  We'd been there forever.  Meanwhile, the only other table in earshot, apparently also on a date, was letting the server know that they never did get one of their two entrees, and that they had to share, too. It was when we got up to leave that a server, moving super quickly, almost knocked over my girlfriend.  That sort of thing happens, but he didn't apologize or even slow down. I believe in providing feedback to businesses, so I quietly went to find a manager. When he came out to talk with me I told him a very brief account of what had happened, and also pointed out that their hostess station had been unmanned for the last five minutes and that there was a huge line.  He apologized but didn't really ask for specifics.  Nor did he offer to comp anything.  I would have refused the comp, I just wanted to get out of there, but when a customer tells you that he didn't actually eat dinner because his food was so bad and didn't have a chance to let anyone know because his server was AWOL, it's pretty crazy to think it's OK to charge full price for something not really delivered.   The guy admitted ""yeah, tonight has been kind of a disaster,"" and I do feel bad for everyone involved because they appeared to be trying hard and doing their best, but the whole thing was unacceptable.  Date night ruined and I'm out cash for food I didn't eat.  Customers waiting to check in started leaving after the hostess still hadn't shown up, and I sort of envy them.  At least they're not out way too much cash and time. AVOID."
Eloise G.,"Concord, CA",88,1,,1.0,5/31/2017,Without a doubt the worst service I've ever had. Not only did it take 15 minutes for me to receive a menu to look at after searching for one of the 8 waitstaff in a nearly empty restaurant but it turns out the bartender is incompetent. The kitchen was very fast but the food was delivered without utensils and I had to wait another 5 minutes to actually eat my food after flagging down another section's server.
Casey O.,"Petaluma, CA",76,9,,5.0,4/30/2017,"I've been to this Great establishment sereval times.  Food top notch. Drinks tip notch and service top notch. Always greated like family from Dustin, Nick and Touran. No matter how long I have not been there, once i walk in they give me a shout out and know what I like. Top notch place... These guys deserve a raise. My mood is always different but they treat me like family and I REALLY appreciate it!! Great job BJ's Bartenders and management."
Matthew F.,"Oakland, CA",98,22,2,3.0,4/18/2017,"There's not a ton to say here. Food is pretty good. Atmosphere is pretty good. It's essentially Cheescake Factory Light. Servers are pleasant, but at times they are overwhelmed, and that can impact the experience."
Shamal P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,2,,1.0,4/20/2017,I waited for 20 minutes no one came to take my order. Servers walked by but didn't care  to ask what I was here for.Very horrible service. Worst that I have ever got at any BJs. Maybe because I'm brown skinned that's why.
Brian E.,"Ukiah, CA",11,37,7,2.0,8/21/2016,"While I was warned about the service, I was told the pizza is decent. I ordered a deep dish for pick up. Being unfamiliar with the restaurant is was unaware that pickups were to be made in the back next to the restrooms. I was coldly informed of this by the hostess after waiting 10 minutes at an unattended welcome station. I came close to walking out by the employees clear irritation from my lack of knowledge. Staff at the take out station next to the restroom were much more pleasant  I was surprised at the 16 dollar price tag on a 9 inch pepperoni pizza, and smile the pizza was not bad, it would have been improved dramatic lyrics by more sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.."
Thadeus K.,"San Rafael, CA",4,61,19,2.0,2/12/2017,I've been here a few times to eat now and the food is just ok and sometimes even bad.  The service can be hit or miss too.  My server today was very friendly and got out order right etc.  they do have lots of tvs to watch sports and the bar is large with plenty of specials options.  All in all I would only recommend this place if everything else was closed or you just wanted a drink.
Valerie W.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",93,256,56,2.0,7/13/2016,"Been here 3 times. The last time we were there we were ignored and they kept taking the menu when we were not done ordering... I get it as I worked/still work in service too but at least say ""Hi I will be right there"", tough to get the check, tough to get drinks / food ordered, tough for refills... go elsewhere if you can."
Stacie R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,20,4,1.0,8/30/2017,"Absolutely horrible service sat for 10 minutes , no acknowledgement, no menus nothing. So we decided to leave on the way out I told the hostess and she rolled her eyes at me and said I'll tell someone. I responded I know you won't tell anybody because she didn't seem to really care. BJ's has been known for a very good food and service however this location absolutely the worst, full of a bunch of younger people who do not care about anything but visiting with each other and doing God knows what , when they should be waiting on the customer."
Nadia M.,"Novato, CA",7,43,317,4.0,9/9/2016,"We like this place because of the deals going on and the portion of food they serve. Their bar is as usual full and looks tempting. It's always crowded. Their half price large pizza is amazing, the way they serve it is beautiful. Overall service is very good and helpful. For a change in always try this place. Don't forget to eat their pizooki in the end."
Debb P.,"San Rafael, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/29/2016,"This BJ's is deplorable.  Service is bad, orders come out wrong, and you have to wait a LONG time for the food to arrive.  Last time we were there, we waited 45 minutes, and still no food.  Manager said the kitchen was ""struggling"".   We are done with this place."
Essence S.,"San Rafael, CA",129,16,8,1.0,7/31/2016,My order was wrong and there is hair in my mayonnaise. Trevor barely checked in on is.
Colleen K.,"San Rafael, CA",26,14,5,1.0,12/14/2016,If I could give negative stars I would. Came here for a school fundraiser. Really slow service - 1.5 hours to get dinner. Then as we were leaving we saw a cat size rat dancing across the floor. Never coming back.
Helen Y.,"San Rafael, CA",3,53,,2.0,7/5/2016,"Portions are getting skimp, skimpy, skimpy. Fried calamari appetizer, once plentiful, now barely serves three. Fish taco once had a good chunk of fish but that's shrunk too.  Service is ok except for a 'manager' (I think) who hovers too closely and asks every 10 minutes if things are ok. Bothersome. And it's freezing inside! Bring the temps down a bit, save some $, and put that back into bigger portions! I'm not asking for huge portions but they've really gone overboard the other way especially for the price.  I've had better experiences with BJ's before but this time was a surprisingly disappointment. Will think twice about going back."
Jen W.,"San Francisco, CA",695,1379,2318,3.0,11/16/2015,"We just finished a hike at Mt. Tam and really wanted pizza and beer.  We decided to go to BJ's as it has been quite awhile since we've been to any other location.  We got our usual deep dish...half great white/half BJ's combo, side caesar salad, and wings.   This is the first location that dunked their wings in buffalo sauce rather than serving it on the side.  The pizza was served on our table without the elevated pizza arm thing.  The person who brought it to us did a double take, didn't care, and left it there anyway.  Our server eventually saw this and brought one over.  Quality-wise...everything else was consistent with other locations.  The beer hit the spot and no one should leave without a pizookie.  Pumpkin was recommended so we went with it.  Nothing beats the white chocolate but it was still delicious.   The service was slow but I could tell that our guy was really working his butt off.  3 stars."
Cheryl M.,"Novato, CA",21,34,7,2.0,6/6/2016,"First off, no problem with the waitress. She was stellar. The food??? Sucked. We love the Sweet Pig. Over the years there has been less and less toppings. Tonight, I would say 75% of the pizza dough did not have toppings covering it. We should have sent it back. Going to think twice about going to BJs with better and cheaper pizza options in town."
Karlene R.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,34,69,3.0,8/27/2016,"Not consistent menu items. Ordered Salmon the other night and size was a small strip. Previous night returned, complained and received the ""appropriate"" portion as pictured.  Get the salted carmel pizookie. After you get by the consistently freezer burnt taste it's pretty darn good!"
