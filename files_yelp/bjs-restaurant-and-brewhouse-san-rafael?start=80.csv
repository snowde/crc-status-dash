J.J. T.,"Richmond, CA",0,11,7,3.0,3/7/2017,"When I'm craving to eat at an American chain restaurant, this is the place for me. I'm not one to frequent the Denny's, Applebee's, etc. establishments, but BJ's is an exception. They do have some healthier options( or should I say ""healthier"" to make me feel like I'm eating better). The have some nice appetizers too. I usually eat a little lighter than normal so I can splurge on the pizookies! And the extensive beer list is always a plus"
Orleana P.,"Petaluma, CA",250,397,972,3.0,11/2/2015,I know they are most known for the beer and pizza but don't shy away from the burgers. We got the bacon guacamole and the crispy jalapeno burgers and both had some good flavor with quite the bite of spice! We both got the thick fries. Those were about a 6 out of 10. I felt like they were a little stale but I am very french fry sensitive :-)  To be honest the very best thing on the menu is their Rootbeer. I love their rootbeer!! Just know that it WILL fill you up! But it is so very very yummy. The staff was fantastic. Very cordial and engaging. Is this restaurant my fav? No but it is not the worst. I actually prefer them for lunch actually. Two fingers of whiskey cost you about as much as your lunch. Overall an okay back up restaurant for if you cannot think of somewhere else to go and you are over by the Mall.
Christine P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",38,24,14,2.0,1/31/2016,"Came to celebrate my Father's birthday to some disappointing food  Now,I've been coming to BJ's a long time and this has never haappened."
allan l.,"San Francisco, CA",1,8,5,2.0,11/27/2016,"Used to go to BJ for late night snack, since they are open pretty late while other places tend to close early in Marin. And they carried pretty good wings and pizookie. However, they do not offered Santa Fe rolls, which are my favorite, what a pity. In addition, customer service is not so good, you can tell based on the empty tables each time we came."
Danielle R.,"San Rafael, CA",139,83,8,3.0,6/30/2016,"The Abercrombie of restaurants. Also, I'm pretty proud of myself for thinking of that."
Jennifer S.,"Redwood City, CA",54,47,126,5.0,8/14/2016,"A family friendly restaurant with an extensive menu.  For a chain place, they really do offer a decent selection with quality food.  The fried artichokes ate delicious, pizza is a safe option,  The tomato bisque wad awesome, and the salads are fresh!  A great place to stop.  This location has good service too!"
Melissa B.,"San Rafael, CA",59,118,129,3.0,6/10/2015,"I find myself at BJ's more often than I'd like to admit, simply because they have a lot of TVs, which always play the big games that are on, and they have beer. The fact that they have a ton of different types of food to choose from adds to the fact that it's just a win-win situation when you need a TV, food, and beer. Other than that, BJ's really disappointed me last night. I went with a friend and we had just a 15 minute wait for a table, which was totally find because it was a busy game night. We got a beer at the bar and the bartender was great, and closed our tab before we went to our table. No complaints there. Our server though, awful. He walked up to us about 5-10 minutes after sitting down and goes, ""are you ready?"" I literally said, ""ready for what?"" Food.... Drinks... The game? Are you our server? Do you have a name? I've never NOT been introduced or at least told the name of my server before I've ordered my food. We took a few more minutes to decide and then another girl comes up to us and asks if we are ready to order. Did we change servers? We order about 2 times each because she was having a hard time hearing us-- and yes, it was super loud because of the game. About 10 minutes later they bring out my meal and then probably 5 minutes later my friends comes. But I got a sandwich and she got soup so I'm not sure why there was such a big gap in between but oh well. That really wouldn't have mattered if it was a good experience other than that. I wasn't offered ketchup or mustard and my friend had to track down one of our servers to get some. I'm also a little confused why my first beer was $4 at the bar and then my second beer was $5.75 at the table when I ordered them about 20 minutes apart. Did happy hour end in those 20 minutes or did I just pay $1.75 for him to walk my beer to the table? We finished eating and had to track them down again to ask for our bill. After we had paid I even had to ask for a box, which they never offered me even though I had half of my meal left in front of me the whole time.  Anyways, there are some times I go to BJs and have service that I think is normal, and I totally get that sometimes it's busy and you won't be waited on the whole time by your waitress/waiter, but that was just pretty lame and sub-par in my opinion. And the fact that we realized we had two servers because the woman was getting trained made me feel awful for her because she should NOT be getting trained by that guy. He could have probably introduced her as well, to start off. Most employees here are really nice and have good customer service but maybe someone needs to make their rounds and check things out because some people there have 0 personality and 0 customer service and if that's the case, I'd rather go somewhere else because it's pretty distracting from a good meal and good beer."
Jude D.,"San Rafael, CA",0,9,,5.0,2/19/2017,"I love this place because i'm a big fan of the Pizzookie and they have a really good kids menu with lots of games to play. My mom gets the Margarita and my dad get's the root beer like me. When I go with my friends too this amazing place. I always order the root beer, and convenient for going to the movies. I would want you to go here and see for yourself!"
Glenda C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",27,44,55,3.0,5/19/2016,"Okay so I visit BJ's from time to time because I think the food is decent but I have to be honest I have stop coming a lot less for a while because the service it's not the greatest. I like the food but unlike the service I have always found that it always needs improvements. Maybe the waiters are just to young and don't have the experience at all and also are not quite trained on customer service. I seen some that work really hard and tried and others like the waiter I had tonight that was just hanging around in the back talking while I waited for my refill to show up at my table. I decided not to remind him because I want it to know how long it will take him to either bring it to me or not. I assume he forgotten about my refill but fifteen minutes after I had asked for the drink and while l was having my dinner he brought me my drink! Oh well at least I got my refill, ..... right? I'm going to assumed that maybe he was having a bad day. However I am given it a three stars review because of the food was actually good and the rib-eye steak was cooked to perfection. The food surprisingly came out faster than what I'm used to."
Steve L.,"Novato, CA",20,23,6,1.0,5/22/2015,"BJ's Su*ked The restaurant in Terra Linda that is. The food, not the service. The $10 pot stickers were burnt and chewy. They brought out the wrong size of pizza.  I ordered a medium but they served a personal size.  When they brought out the correct size, it had virtually the same amount of pepperoni! BTW... No sauce and very thin cheese with 90% doughy crust. My wife ordered Thai mango salad; it consisted of some lettuce, three small pieces of mango, four pieces of chicken that were the size of a coin (quarter) and no dressing. We returned it for a proper portion.  Uuuggghhh! The only thing that didn't su*k was the beer. A waste of $50."
Tajhara K.,"Richmond, CA",0,11,,4.0,2/23/2017,Our waitress Jazmin Z was excellent me and my colleague walked In at 1:03pm was seated placed our order and rec'v two steak lunches well prepared within 30 minutes of being seated.  Excellent customer service.
Shaun H.,"Petaluma, CA",26,26,14,4.0,2/20/2017,"I've stopped in for lunch a few times.  I like the food choices even though there are way to many on the menu.  I like simple menus.  Today I tried the Southern fried Chicken on mashed potatoes.   Excellent choice.   They are always busy so service is generally slow so I won't go for just  a quick meal.  You better have some time.  The atmosphere is great and the restaurant is very clean.  Burgers, pulled pork and chicken club are awesome as well."
Kat K.,"San Bruno, CA",7,27,14,3.0,4/17/2016,Awful.  1. I had scheduled an order pick up for 715 and didn't get my order until 730-740 2. My avocado rolls didn't come with the sauce WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I EVEN ORDERED THEM 3. I didn't get a spoon with my soup.  Overall quite irritated. **update.  I do appreciate the managers quick response and taking care of us.
Adam K.,"Dover, OH",0,7,2,5.0,8/1/2017,"Staff was friendly and Jonathan was on pointe! Got the hickory brisket burger, it was amazing! Also 3$ pizookies on Tuesday, gotta try the snores one!"
Shanty H.,"Lancaster, CA",0,7,15,1.0,1/19/2017,"Came here after a long day at work and expected to relax and enjoy some good food and a drink but the waitress didn't even acknowledge us. Waited forever to get serve, and didn't get good services. She looks like she didn't want to be here. Never even check to see if we wanted anything else."
Claudia T.,"Fairfax, CA",30,158,9,2.0,4/30/2015,"BJ's can't seem to figure it out. Sometimes we go and the service is so-so, the food is good, and the drinks are decent. Other times we go and everything is just awful. I would love to have one mind-blowing experience at BJ's.  The closest we got to having a great time is when my husband and I stopped in for lunch. Our server Jeffrey was amazing! He acted like he actually liked his job, cared about his customers, and had a great sense of humor. We told him that he needed to work nights because all of the servers at night are lacking everything that he rocked. With Jeffrey we didn't feel like he was only working there temporarily to pay his way through whatever his current situation is. It's funny how service can really make or break the experience for the customer.  Unfortunately we went back Saturday night and it was awful. Our cocktails were juice. Literally no alcohol. Charge me for juice then, not an alcoholic beverage if you are not going to put any alcohol in it!. It took us two hours to get our food, and drinks. No joke.  I think I have given BJ's plenty of chances and they are just not winning my bid.  P.S. Please put Jeffrey on the night shift, for the sake of the customers!"
Carlo C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/1/2017,Very disappointed. Took my steak to go. Ordered a medium cooked ribeye. Got a well well well done steak. I don't even know if this is a grilled chicken breast or a steak.
Ken B.,"San Rafael, CA",30,24,,4.0,5/3/2017,"Thank GOD someone in Marin County is open past 930 PM on a weeknight.  GREAT beer selection, just OK on wine. Fairly extensive menu. Service can be extremely good or fair, depending on the night."
David D.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/9/2017,"As some of the other reviewers mentioned this place is no different than Apple Bee""s or Chilli's . What I have noticed at this location is that the service is very slow . I understand slow service when it is crazy busy, but when there is less than 10 tables occupied and a full staff there shouldn't be a 45 min wait for your food . All I can say there is an Apple Bees right next door"
Tim B.,"Novato, CA",70,278,8,5.0,7/5/2015,"One can always start a circuitous argument about the following: What is a better restaurant - one that is family-run and has been around forever, or someplace that is quite obvious a chain? As with pretty much everything else, there is no simple answer. Fittingly enough, on consecutive nights we experienced both. And while our sample was in no way definitive, it did highlight why certain classic family-style joints might be in trouble, whereas a well-run if somewhat soulless corporate chain can do well.  The restaurant we went to the night before has been around since 1973, but in many ways seems to have not advanced past 1987 - no new items on the menu, no website or any acknowledgements that the Bush/Clinton/Bush/Obama era has ever taken place. On the other hand, you can tell that BJ's really keeps on top of everything - the menu reflects the range of tastes that its guests demand, one can bring in a coupon via smartphone, televisions are attuned to a healthy variety of sporting events. And, possibly most importantly, the staff is fresh and invigorating - I don't think we ever had to wait more than a couple of minutes. And our food - words can not describe how tasty my New Orleans Jambalaya was, but it went down easily and made my belly nice and content, accompanied by a nice, smooth Piranha Ale. And for dessert, the Salted Caramel Pizookie ensured that I wouldn't be needing any food for the next twenty hours.  Although we were there for nearly ninety minutes, the joint was efficient enough to make it feel like nine - yes, I know that not all chain restaurants are like this, I know that the food isn't necessarily the best for you, and probably somewhere there is a man being shortchanged on his bean profit. But damn it, BJ's makes for a very tasty and comfortable experience without being too expensive."
