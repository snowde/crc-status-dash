Catherine W.,"San Rafael, CA",39,122,28,3.0,12/1/2017,"You, know, after seeing the 2.5 star reviews here, I can make a case for ""categories"" of restaurants. BJ's is NOT the place you want to take someone you want to make a positive impression on (like, the first time you take your girl's parents out, or something, unless this already happens to be their favorite restaurant). However, if you are looking for a casual place for some beer, some conversation, a meeting place to watch the game or an all out, guilty pleasure place to imbibe in some drink and bar food - this is your place! We come here when we have the craving for some comfort food and a pizookie (dessert). Rarely does this place disappoint. Is the waitstaff super attentive and ready with suggestions and always there when you water needs filling? To be honest, not really. Does the bartender know every drink in the book and then some, when you need just that sumpin, sumpin special? No, don't think so. However, if you know what you want, a burger, a huge salad or basic, filling appy's, this is your place! We love the food here, for what it is - don't come here on watching your weight, come for some American fare, a little greasy in places, very filling and satisfyingly delicious, if nothing fancy American fare is what you want. At night, the place is a bit, dark, but the better to watch the game on the huge big screen TV's all scattered about the place.  As mentioned before, the waitstaff does a journeyman's job, but again, but if you ask them for water as they are whizzing by, they willingly accommodate. One night we came and found several single diners (one person only), so if that is something you do, you can dine in privacy. Our favorites - anything on the appetizer list, a huge salad (or a small beet salad), a big burger or pasta dish. I usually have an appetizer and the hubby usually goes for an entree. For lunch, I have had a big salad, shared it with a friend and a beer is just right! For dessert, pizookie is the thing! A play on words (combination of a cookie and a pizza) you get a soft serve cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream! We usually get the ice cream on the side - it is eaten with a spoon, and again - not a diet item, not even a little bit! For variety, you can order three mini pizookies at a time, each topped with a ""scooplet"" of ice cream. The cookie would seem to be made with a bit of flour to hold it together, a whole lotta sugar and a whole lotta butter! It is really good, but again, it has to be the kind of thing you want... In the end, you really won't leave in need of another meal easily until morning.  As a family, when you have one of those nights where cooking is not a possibility, but if you are hungry AF and you NEED to have some FOOD, come here. If you are with friends and it's kinda late and you have the munchies, come here! If your house is a mess, but you want to watch the game with friends, come here! We like BJ's just fine!"
Becky S.,"Sonoma, CA",55,8,1,1.0,1/6/2018,"Update: downgraded to 1 star after getting sick within an hour of eating my meal.  Bummer, BJs is generally a pretty solid chain restaurant.   We will start with the pros...friendly and accommodating staff. Cons...floors are very dirty (food stepped on and napkins on the floor under tables), menus sticky and my spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles was less than Stella.  The flavor of the noodles is great but the broccoli the accompanied it was an obvious afterthought as they had were barely cooked and had no flavor. There were about 4 little pieces of chicken in the dish. Thankfully my server was great and brought a side of grilled chicken to add to the meal."
Niki B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,17,15,1.0,12/6/2017,"I'm writing this from my bathroom where I'm currently vomiting my guts out. Had the ahi poke here. I knew it was fishy tasting and not very good tonight (it's normally my favorite thing here). I've eaten here plenty of times and been just fine but now I have food poisoning.  To top it off our waitress was terrible. She brought us a plastic spoon for my husband's soup because apparently they don't have a dishwasher or enough silverware. It was not even half full of people so I don't know how you run out of spoons. We ordered 3 appetizers but my husband's entree somehow came out first and it took at least 30 minutes for the other food to come out (even though you don't have to cook poke).  Once the waitress, dark short spikey hair, came out with the rest of our food she announces they don't have anymore wonton chips and then stares blankly at me, my dish in her hand, like I'm supposed to tell her what to do. I then ask ""how am I supposed to eat the ahi without the chips?"" And she continues to stare at me like she had forgotten completely who she even was and says ""I don't know."" She continues to stare at me. Hello? Is anyone home in there? I was hoping she'd offer an alternative but she didn't just stood there starting at me in silence. I gave up and just said it was fine I'll use a fork. She then left us and didn't return until our plates were nearly empty asking if we wanted dessert - at this point, yeah right.  She did offer to remove one of our appetizers off our bill so at least we know the lights aren't on with no one home.  Regardless, I expect that if I'm paying $10 per app and $20 per entree that the place has an adequate amount of silverware and waitresses that know how to do their job. Also I don't expect to get freaking food poisoning. Maybe management should look into the staff working this night because clearly they need some help."
Aaron B.,"Valley Ford, CA",4,73,35,3.0,8/12/2017,"We had lunch here today and after correcting my order of my supposed to be well done burger but came red in the middle and correcting our iced tea of which I said lots of ice no lemon and they came with lemon and hardly any ice. It finally came correct and the food was very good. All in all the food is tasty and the atmosphere is loud, busy and cozy if your in a booth. They also have brunch and seating outside and a bar area for those of you who are interested."
Shirley B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",61,98,480,1.0,7/28/2017,"What can I say that others haven't? I'm shocked that this establishment is a chain, and has managed to stay viable as a business, especially considering the name of the place. This particular BJ's is part of a mall in Santa Rosa.  Food: I wish I'd captured a photo of the chips and queso. The first plate they dropped off was appalling. Chips were slathered in grease, and there were many small broken pieces. We returned it, asking for chips that weren't dripping in oil. The second plate was half the size of the first for some reason, and it didn't look much better. There was a sad bowl of watered down queso with zero flavor. The chicken fried steak burger came with an over-cooked fried egg, burned chicken fried steak, and no gravy. Not a single drop. Fries were soggy with grease. The lemon thyme chicken was lacking lemon and thyme.  Service: Slightly redeeming, as their waitstaff were attentive, keeping glasses refilled.  Cost: Three entrees, two apps, and four iced teas ran us $65 and change.  Overall: The menu is like a book, and the variety means they don't do anything well. Just loads of less than mediocre food at some high prices. Zero ambience inside, and the ladies room was in dire need of cleaning. Note: We were there at the slow time of the day, around 3:30pm. There's loads of parking outside as it's part of a mall, and you can shop before or after eating. But really. This place is worse than disappointing. Hard to spend  money here when there are so many other great options in town."
Bell S.,"Windsor, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/26/2017,"SUCKS! Save your money. Have tried several times, several menu items. NO GOOD. 2 apps and dinner for 4. $154 with tip. So not worth it. $17 for a small 6 slice pizza that's not quite as good as Tombstone frozen pizza. Almost $7 for a local Ca craft brew when I can go to Russian River and have the real thing for $5 a pint, No thanks. Not to mention the awful service. Needless to say I won't be going back. If I could rate Minus stars I would."
Dave J.,"Monterey, CA",5,10,15,1.0,10/20/2017,"Horrible service didn't even bring silverware! Fries were never brought! No drink service,forgot Dr Pepper  Too busy for the staff of teens Not enough qualified servers When telling another employee that our drink order never arrived the Air Headed Girl said...oh this isn't my table... We tried to let things slide..... But the chicken fried steak burger came out bloody raw... Waters were non filled All in All I'd say I wish we would of gone to McDonalds!!"
MARINA G.,"Tacoma, WA",8,1,45,5.0,12/17/2017,We love to frequent Bj's and always check to see where our favorite server station is. Allison is not only bubbly and sweet and knows are beverages when we walk in. We only dine when she is there. It makes for a gathering of friends we she is there. I'm sure she is an asset to Bj's
Bob F.,"Belmont, CA",38,374,,4.0,10/1/2017,Came here for a light dinner one night recently.  Had appetizers and beer.    It was great that they could accommodate a large party on a Sunday evening without too much of a wait. The menu is huge.  Split a salad and appetizer with my wife.  They were not terribly memorable.  Also got the Tatonka Stout.  That was really tasty. i would have that again.  I think I need to try more things on their menu.  I expect to be back.
Julia S.,"Petaluma, CA",16,35,1,5.0,11/13/2017,"I love this place!!!  From the easy call in to reserve seats, to the great food and the warm service, this place is a five star eatery and brewery! It's full of life, people are happy to be here! You can't go wrong with comfortable vinyl seating, you're surrounded by HD big screen televisions. Whether your sitting at the full size bar or the cushy vinyl booths, this place rocks! They offer a variety of beer and spirits, from local IPA's to passion fruity mixers to brew samplers, you can't go wrong or fall short of thirst:) My fiancé' loved the shrimp jambalaya, my son had the hickory brisket and bacon sandwich, I really don't remember him eating it because it was there and gone it less than 5 minutes, if you know what I mean, it must have been yummy! I tried the rib eye steak medium well with their fluffy mashed potatoes and seasoned asparagus, sizzled to perfection.. Try the garlic bread twisty bread, their to die for, not too salty with a hint of garlic salt, delicioso'! And last but definitely not to say the least, there's dessert I gulped down the Ghirardelli (home grown in San Fran) chocolate chunk pizookie,, it literally melts in your mouth... Although it's located outside of Cottingtown mall in Santa Rosa, you would never know, that's how awesome this atmosphere is! -Please visit this great place, you'll not only be doing a service to the employees, but to the community and the many families who have lost their homes or displaced from the October fire! #Sonomastrong"
Lupita P.,"Napa, CA",128,21,6,1.0,12/19/2017,The food was super blend no flavor at all. The ribs were ok not the best. The service was ok but not the best when we got our appetizer we didn't even get plates to share so I hate to eat of the appetizer plate. I had to return my food because there was no flavor at all and the server didn't even ask is there something else you would like. I was pretty disappointed.
Evelyn M.,"Castro Valley, CA",197,110,1577,5.0,11/20/2017,Came in on a Friday midnight for some drinks n a bit to eat. Had my first beer flight n loved it. The prices were great they gav us happy hour prices even tho it wasn't a happy hour day or time. Server was sweet n friendly place was nice n clean. I felt it was bigger than most BJs I've gone to so I would think the wait time isn't that bad out here if I were to go during the day when it's busy. I always tell ppl to try the pizookie it's a must when ur at BJs
Victoria B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",6,11,5,1.0,12/20/2017,"Wow I really hate to ever give a 1 Star rating but I figured I had to comment. This has been the 3rd time in a row going to Bj's where the service isn't good and the food is even worse. I keep trying to give it a chance thinking maybe this time it will be better, but it never is. Went with a friend yesterday who got a prime rib dip that was all fat and completely greasy, and I got a bowl of COLD tomato soup. I just don't understand how this place is still in business honestly. We should have went to Denny's...or Jack in the box nearby. Anything is better than BJ's...someone is running this place into the ground. Please, get new staff and hire some chefs that actually know how to cook or else you're going to lose your business."
Kaylee H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Awful service, took forever get our food and I had a party of 4. I ordered the fish tacos and the server forgot my tacos and then brought me chicken tacos that had tomatoes on which I told her I was allergic to."
Stephanie T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,167,66,3.0,9/30/2017,Formula food at its best. That sounds kind of snobby but really the food is fine and the service is reliably good. This was an affordable dinner out for the family.
Dori E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/17/2017,"My husband and I went to BJ's last night after touring the Coffey Park Christmas decorations. It was super busy. So we sat in a booth in the bar area. Although the place was packed, we were greeted immediately and ordered our drinks. Justin, our server made it seem like we were the only table he had. He he was attentive and on top of everything; getting our food to us quickly, Refilling drinks etc. we were kind of sad when we got to BJs. After seeing all the fire devastation in Coffey Park, but Justin's uplifting attitude and contagious smile helped make our night and on a good note."
Gina H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",60,73,86,4.0,9/18/2017,"Came here because my pregnant niece was wanting chicken Alfredo. What she wants, she will get. Pretty good size portion but only came with one small croissant. Was going to ask for more but apparently this is the place to go late nights. We got there around 10:30pm and it was pretty busy. The waiter, who I didn't get his name, went in to details about the Pizookies since he said some customers think they're free. That cracked us up. It was a good night."
Sarah H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/17/2017,"Great place to come, have a beer and have a bite to eat. Kerry was our server and did an excellent job. I highly recommend her. The food tasted awesome. We got the sriracha queso dip to start and a pepperoni extreme pizza. I will definitely be back again and make recommendations to friends!"
Aracely R.,"Davis, CA",81,9,,1.0,12/10/2017,"Horrible service! Every time we've come here our waitresses have been horrible. Again today we didn't get our drink until we asked a bus boy for it. My son ordered mozzarella sticks and never got the ranch he asked for. The sticks were getting cold and hard so I had to walk to the bar to ask for ranch. He ended up not eating them because they were so hard and cold! Never did we get any refills on our drinks or were we asked how our food was. We've given them the benefit of the doubt each time, but we will not be back."
Nichole W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,25,4,1.0,11/26/2017,Extremely long waits ( consistently) I had the Mahi Mahi taco. We had a sausage for an app. It was burned. So were the Brussel sprouts. I am so sick right now. My Stomach is destroyed.
Brett S.,"Petaluma, CA",6,15,,1.0,11/19/2017,"While the ambiance looked promising, this place failed to deliver. On a Sunday evening, We waited for 25 minutes even though there were upwards of 15 empty tables.  When we were seated, we waited for too long to get menus.  Our server was clearly still learning the POS system, which would have been fine if she did not walk away when my wife was in mid sentence giving her order! My Cobb salad arrived without the avocado. After 10 minutes of trying to get our server 's attention, she finally came over. When I asked about the avocado, she argued with me.  She was sure that it was not on the menu. Our stack of menus were still on the table (she never bothered to pick them up) so I showed her. So, she said she would go ask the kitchen. After she left, I noticed that I did not have Any dressing in my salad. By this point, the experience was ruined. While BJ's has a reputation for large servings, this was not the case with  the Cobb salad.  There were a total of four bites worth of chicken, and about two tablespoons of bacon.  Skimpy for a $14 salad. Don't waste your time or money. There are many great restaurants in Santa Rosa."
Brett G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,13,,5.0,1/1/2018,I enjoy going here once or twice a week. All the staff is courteous especially Tina who remembers me every time. They have a great menu and happy hour.
Miss T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,41,12,1.0,9/27/2017,"Our team works very close and we frequent all of the local places but will NEVER eat at BJs again. We have had so many bad visits sprinkled with a few so-so visits but no more. So sick of the management being aware of the errors and just not coming through.  Ordered online for a curbside pickup and it wasn't ready at the time promised. Got back to the jobsite and TWO SIDES WERE MISSING so there were no fries and no fruit salad. My Ahi wasn't seared at all- just seasoned and sliced, no wasabi. And the brussels sprouts were missing the spicy sauce so it was just plain roasted, unseasoned veggies.  News today says the owners are looking to sell the chain...maybe new owners will improve on this place but for now, if you like well cooked food and attention to your orders, find another place to eat because this place is a HUGE FAIL."
Rosa T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",87,6,,1.0,12/5/2017,We waited over an hour with a reservation and they told me it would be half an hour and yet they still kept saying it would be only a few more minutes. We ended up leaving and going to Tipsy Taco.
Jennifer L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,89,4,1.0,2/25/2017,"I always come to Bj's having high hopes, but never again. What happened to this place!? Everything about this restaurant used to be outstanding. The service, food, and BASICALLY EVERYTHING has gone down hill. I came in a couple weeks ago and ordered Chicken Alfredo and they forgot to place broccoli in my dish. I asked our waitress for a side of broccoli because the chef forgot it and she said ""dang, you caught it."" Tonight, they left out the chicken in my CHICKEN Alfredo. They always serve their food slightly cold or not fresh at all. For instance, I came in and ordered a bacon and avocado grill cheese with my coworkers. The bread was stale and the avocados were bad!!"
Spike W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,44,171,4.0,8/30/2017,"Always a good eatery for Burgers and Salads. Well we're here again for just that on a Wednesday no less - $10 Loaded Burgers with unlimited fries. My hubby got his favorite Cheese Bacon Burger made as he requested - mmmm good - 7oz med-rare burger with grilled onions on a Parmesan bun with lettuce, tomato, cheese & bacon. Didn't have additional fries but they're good. Eat when all is hot - great! My seared Ahi Tuna salad was great as usual! This was a late lunch so we didn't indulge with a cocktail - we waited until later for that. Always satisfied. Thank you Kim, our server."
Laurie E.,"Cotati, CA",0,31,7,1.0,11/12/2017,Waited over an hour again for dinner.  The excuses are getting old.  Food was tasty but you'd think they could serve dinner less than an hour!  I keep giving them another try and every time the service is worse.  Ugh!
ellen r.,"Rohnert Park, CA",28,10,,2.0,12/30/2017,"My friend and I came in for lunch, they had a brunch menu, she ordered the egg breakfast and i ordered the pancake with eggs. We waited a long time for our order and looked around to see that it wasnt very crowded, but a group of 5 servers, including ours was engaged in a conversation. Finally, i guess someone from the kitchen brought our food. Her's was missing the potatoes and mine had no butter or syrup and was cold. We finally got the waiter over and acted like he  didnt know the potatoes came with her meal and offered to get her a side of potatoes, no, they come with the meal. I didnt send mine back,  nor did i ever get a refill on my coffee.. I like their lunches and dinners much better."
X Z.,"Windsor, CA",45,58,33,1.0,11/9/2017,"Last night was fun.  The food was awesome.  Tina, our waitress, was awesome.  What isn't awesome is that BJ's thinks it's still okay to hand out Styrofoam take home boxes.  NOT OKAY.  If BJ's is going to be that cheap...then are they being cheap with the food too?  Hmmm...what was it that I really ate?  It looked healthy...but were the ingredients really made of??  I'm so scared now!  :-P Is someone paying attention in management?  I am.  I'll stay away for now...until I can compost my take home box...Tina...I'm sorry.  You're really cool...but the Styrofoam boxes....I can't.  I just can't."
Ed M.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,10,,2.0,12/5/2017,"Stopped in for lunch.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup plus my wife ordered a salad and I ordered prime rib dip.  The first thing to appear was my prime rib dip. Next ONE of the soup orders to my wife, then her salad.  Then the other soup order some time later.  The jus cup for my dip had just a little in it, and I ran out with the first half; so I asked the waitress for more. A very long time later she brought a cup of something that looked like chicken soup; (probably jus with water added.) My wife talked me out of leaving a small tip because she felt that the problems were in the kitchen and not the waitress' fault. It will be a long time, if ever, when we will be in that noisy place again."
Jim A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,47,,1.0,12/18/2017,"If you were starving and hadn't eaten in a week, go somewhere else.  If you're an alcoholic looking for a cocktail with some booze, go somewhere else.  If every single restaurant in Santa Rosa was closed except BJ's, drive to San Francisco and go somewhere else.  We ordered two $5 margarita specials and got what we paid for.  There is more booze in an Iced Tea.  We waited 45 minutes for our entrée to arrive, then cut our loss and went over to Whole Foods to get take out.  DO NOT GO TO BJ'S."
Ada M.,"Sacramento, CA",40,2,1,4.0,11/9/2017,After reading the recent reviews I was hesitant to try this particular BJs. It was a great experience! The waitress was super attentive and we all had a great experience!
Cruz M.,"Eureka, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/30/2017,"I've always been a fan of BJ's but this visit was exceptional. The food was cooked to perfection and my server, Matt, was awesome! He was super fun, still while keeping his space. I never had an empty glass. I loved my time there and definitely would recommend."
Anisa A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",33,228,152,5.0,3/18/2017,This BJ's location is always a go-to. It's kinda nice that they change up their menu as often as they do. It's probably why we don't mind coming as often. Service seems to go by faster if you order drinks and an appetizer. It's always busy. I've ordered out a few times if the wait would be long. But the food is worth it. The food quality is pretty consistent.
Brandon P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",144,35,95,3.0,11/4/2017,"Service was ok, took a bit to get my bill processed. The Peruvian -Quinoa Bowl with Shrimp is filling, but lacks strong flavor, the shrimp saved the dish, it was seasoned with salt and pepper, best part of the dish. A little more flavor with the quinoa and vegetables would be nice."
Paul D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",54,233,128,1.0,12/10/2016,BJ has gone down hill. We are shocked. This is the fourth time in month of December 2016  that we have had lousy service. It took over 1 hour to receive our food .  The waiter ordered the wrong item and forgot our kids food after bringing out our food 1 hr late. Wow management needs to start doing their job and getting new cooks. Their is no excuses for waiting over an hour for food and waiters screwing up.
Ana R.,"Windsor, CA",18,2,,1.0,9/24/2017,Second time eating here and the service was as bad as the pizza we ate! The toppings were almost raw and the tomatoes looked canned! And they put way too much ice in the drinks. The raspberry ice tea had no taste! You won't find me or my family going back again.
H M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,27,1,2.0,7/20/2017,"I give it two stars instead of one, because their dessert is delicious. It's also pretty clean, and there are lots of tables. Otherwise, I promise you can get much better food for the same prices somewhere else in the area. I've been here three times total. I thought the first time was just a fluke with average service and being surrounded by really obnoxious other customers--rude, loud, and a toddler threw up on the table next to me. Obviously not BJ's fault. The second time, service was still sort of slow, and the food was mediocre. The third time, the service was better and more friendly, but the food was so bad (again, except for dessert). I just ate my dinner because I was hungry and would feel bad wasting food."
Paul P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",29,147,1070,1.0,5/21/2016,"Not happy with the food, to salty, and bad service. Will I come back, I don't think so."
Alysa C.,"Sebastopol, CA",83,2,,5.0,12/17/2017,I always love going to Bj's. Justin was my server last night and gave me excellent customer service! Food and beer were delicious and well worth it. I always have a great time with Justin!
