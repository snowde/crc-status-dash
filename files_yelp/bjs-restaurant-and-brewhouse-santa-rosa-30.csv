Jaii V.,"Fremont, CA",73,47,5,1.0,10/12/2015,"Emailed corporate:  Last night was suppose to be a night of fun, good food, basically a time to remember with family who were visiting from Los Angeles. Our party was of 10, ages ranged from 4 to 75 years old. I personally had never been to BJ's but someone suggested we try it and we went in. We were seated in a timely matter and our server was Melissa. She came around to get our drinks, took our order and then the problems began. We noticed food was taking a bit longer than what we have experienced before at other restaurants, we inquired about it and were told it should be coming shortly. After about an hour I received my burger and fries before my salad, not a deal breaker. My daughter received her rack of ribs, my son his kid's pizza, someone else a pasta. Another 15 minutes later my husband' uncle received his soup and appetizer. Due to waiting for the food so long we began eating. Half way through his soup he found an earring! I have added the picture. We asked for the manager, when he came around he explained that earrings weren't allowed in the kitchen area, however gave no explanation as to how it got there. We informed him that by this time we had been waiting too long for our food, I had finished my burger and 5 others had not received their orders. A few minutes later two more orders (Andy appetizers) were brought out. My husband's cousin was genuinely upset that her order, a salad, had yet to reach the table. We received appetizers (also after the burger and rack of ribs, one would imagine those come before the entrees), but no salad? At that point she and my husband cancelled their order, two more orders were never brought, then they said there was a confusion about who's order was cancelled. It could have been easily resolved if they would have asked. Through all this Melissa was refilling drinks, I honestly think she felt embarrassed about the whole ordeal. We do not blame our waitress, she was attentive. We did not pay for our bill as the manager waived it. However a wonderful night with family was ruined! We were easily there for almost 3 hours, at least 2 of those waiting for food! They resorted to eating at a drive thru instead. I am unsure if this is common practice at Santa Rosa's BJ's but after I looked up reviews (wish I truly hoped we would have looked at before going in) it seems that mediocrity is a problem. We were very upset, and highly doubt we will return to this restaurant. For your future guests I recommend you solve the issue, take this as a learning experience and hopefully you are able to provide a wonderful dinner to your future guests."
Mabel N.,"Windsor, CA",52,8,1,1.0,1/16/2017,"Our waitress was ""new"" this was our 3rd time coming here to give it another try but as usual true disappointment to get a seat there was a wait of 30 min the waitress was nice but she was all over the place messed up our order my father had to wait an additional 15-20 min for his food it was cold when they finally brought it too him she didn't care to ask me for water refill she was rushing me about taking my order for my son and insisted to order a cheese and tomato pizza total disappointment ,she forgot to bring me my apple sauce for my son , it was just a mess , quality of the food it was not good I rather pay the same price at a locally owned restaurant and not a chain where all the food is dry and dull my mom ordered and fettuccine pasta presentation was awful and there was not enough sauce on it and only one piece of broccoli all the way to the bottom, my burger was semi warm and potatoes wedges tasted old I will not be coming here again. Sorry gave this a try a few times"
J R.,"Pacific Grove, CA",231,842,964,4.0,12/27/2014,"Our waiter Ben rocked. Otherwise, this would be more like a 3 star review. The place has some nice local aesthetics for a chain, and in spite of it being somewhat crowded, it was easy for us to talk without dealing with excessive noise. Pretty good value for the $. The menu is huge, and so obviously not everything is going to be great. What we liked:  I had five oz pours of the following. I liked three out of the four a lot, and by the end of the meal, the fourth one tasted pretty good, too: HopStorm® IPA Piranha® Pale Ale BJ's Oasis® Amber Nutty Brewnette® The mozzarella-tomato salad that I got to accompany my lunch special was very tasty, though the tomatoes were not exactly at their peak of ripeness (or they were just out of season). Mixed feelings about the Avocado Egg Rolls (""a blend of avocados, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, chipotle peppers and spices, served with a sweet tamarind sauce""). A bit pricey. Gf didn't think they were worth the calories or the cost, and the texture of the filling was a bit odd. I didn't detect much besides avocados on the inside, but the rolls were nice & crisp, and I really liked the dipping sauce.  Gf's mahi mahi plate was good but not great. My deep dish pizza, one of the lunch specials, was not good at all. Lots of dough, a decent amount of anchovies, and not much else. If you're looking for real Chicago deep dish pizza, this ain't it. But like I said--the service was great, the food was filling, and the beer was pretty good."
Korinn H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",38,20,1,2.0,1/23/2016,"I've been three times...I always give a place three chances. Unfortunately, all three times were not good experiences. The first time, our entree came with my appetizer and my friend's appetizer didn't come at  all. It took at least 10 minutes to get her appetizer removed from the check. The second time, my friend was almost finished with her lunch when mine arrived. The third time, there was a mistake on the check and it took 20 minutes to get it resolved, (actually, 17 minutes...I know because I had to be somewhere else and kept checking the time). I don't understand why it takes so long for a server to find a manager to correct a check! The food and drinks are ok but not good enough to lure me back. Three strikes and I'm out... I've worked in several restaurants and believe these issues have no excuses."
Alexis R.,"Pacifica, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/21/2017,"We were visiting from out of town and decided to come here, Tiffani was our sever tonight in the bar area and she was AMAZING!!!! We were not use to this type of service! Fast and efficient! She was great! We will be returning when we come back to visit!"
D D.,"Surprise, AZ",0,30,2,1.0,1/7/2017,"Well with urging from husband we returned and again this location validated there is no need for us to ever return again.  After being seated 20 minutes passed before we were able to flag someone down.  Then after ordering and another 20 minutes later my husband got his Salmon, but my salad...yes salad was not ready for another 5 minutes.  BJ'S has decent food, but the overall service and management  is horrible.  No further visits for us at this location."
Tyler S.,"San Diego, CA",26,124,5,3.0,2/5/2016,"Five stars for service! But tonight I went about 4 pm for a beer and reported to a manager that last visit I was sick. His response was I likely got it elsewhere. A new study he says food illness is many more hours before when I got sick. Well I got sick 4 hours after BJ's with dizzy, cold sweats then tossed it. That seems clear to me. I just wanted them to be alerted to it. But after the managers response tonight I decided to post on yelp. Ive enjoyed BJ's for a long time up and down the state. If any of you get sick let them know.. So they can investigate it."
Michael j. R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",48,56,3,2.0,5/19/2016,"Just Spent $70.00 On Total Dissapointment...Food Came Out Wrong, Smaller Burger Than I Remember & Not Even A Beer Comp For My Trouble & Spending....Whole Foods Burger Is Cheaper & Better..."
Aiden P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,,2.0,10/9/2016,Didn't like the food great staff and a peer felt location I love the decor and the love put into making this fun place but the food brought me down it was big and low grade
martha g.,"Sonoma, CA",27,52,122,5.0,12/5/2015,Great service thanks the Antonio & Graham.. Excellent service.. The best yet here!! It's nice to know theirs people who enjoy their jobs.. It shows.
David F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,6,1.0,7/15/2016,"Went in, seated outside. Sat for 15 minutes without service. Another couple sat at table next to us. Automatically got served and ignored us completely. BJ should stand for BS! Walking out....""Have a great day guys!"" Wait! WTF!"
Nicholas B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,13,,5.0,9/8/2016,"The service here has always been fantastic, even on crowded nights. This place always has deals as well that I've always seen advertised at the entrance (if you download the app). The prices are very reasonable and the food is great. The restaurant is full of TVs and is very clean and well maintained."
Robyn C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,11,,2.0,1/9/2017,"I have eaten at BJ's before and really enjoyed it, and so was disappointed in the low quality of the food this time. The artichoke dip was delicious, as usual. Also, I specifically asked for NO bacon on one order and it arrived smothered in bacon. I will not be ordering take-out from BJ's again."
Becky K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",25,5,,3.0,10/5/2016,Used to have awesome poke! Ordered it today. It isn't even poke anymore. It was cabbage salsa with 5 pieces of ahi. Felt very ripped off. Everything else was good.
David F.,"Hidden Valley Lake, CA",0,11,9,1.0,8/22/2017,"I'll start with by saying kudos for the Tuscan tomato bisque and Mediterranean chicken pita tacos both were excellent. My son's 5 meat pizza was also a winner. Where things broke down was wait time for food and menu descriptions not matching the food served. My son's girlfriend ordered the salmon tacos - which I'm sure we're delicious - but unknown to her, contained cilantro, something she is allergic to. Our server was very helpful and refired the order mentioning to the kitchen staff no cilantro. They had to leave so the order was packed to go and guess what she found buried beneath everything else in the taco - cilantro. Fortunately she didn't eat it and need a trip to the emergency department. I returned to the store and spoke to the on duty manager, Ali, who left me with an unconcerned so what attitude. She had the opportunity to right a wrong but obviously lacks the training or experience to do so. I'll have to give it some serious thought before I ever walk in those doors again.  I need to append my review to indicate that the company's operations manager responded to my written complaint promptly and I appreciate that. I'm satisfied, by his response to me, that they have addressed the issues and it will not happen again. With that said; yes, I would eat there again and will soon do so."
Raelle C J.,"Windsor, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/29/2016,"Came in to catch up with a friend today and was served by Tina! A remarkable server that I am so happy with. She made some fabulous food recommendations. As a server I know what it's like with the hustle and busyness as a waitress and I just want to commend her attitude and energy. Food was amazing and came quickly, appetizers were bomb....no complaints! She made our experience nothing less than amazing! Thanks Tina! :)"
Lynnette D.,"Fairfield, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/29/2016,"I went to Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse on Coddington Avenue in Santa Rosa on Tuesday, December 27th with my husband and another couple.  I had the worst experience ever.  First the server took our order, brought our drinks and then disappeared. I ordered a salad and a small, thin crust margarita pizza. The others at my table ordered soup and sandwiches or a hamburger. Someone else brought out the soup and my salad.  I had no silverware to eat my salad.  We had to ask 3 different staff members to bring me a fork.  After 5 to 10 minutes I finally got a fork.  Then came the main course. Everyone at my table was served 10 minutes before I finally got my pizza.  A dish that should take only 5 minutes to prepare.  Everyone else had a dish that took longer to prepare.  This was the first time my husband had been to BJ's.  Needless to say he was less than impressed.  We would have overlooked this if the restaurant had been busy.  I will never go to this particular BJ's again, and I'm not too sure about any BJ's."
Zach C.,"Willits, CA",0,15,,4.0,2/18/2017,"I went in at midnight to grab a late dinner.The service was good, food was good with good portions. Great atmosphere. Not sure why they have so many negative post since they seemed to be a fair amount of people eating there this late night. It's a big of a distance from my house so will be the late night spot for dinner."
B. F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,6,,2.0,12/20/2016,I have been to a lot of BJs locations. This one has the worst service. Servers forget about you. They take a while to even come greet you when you sit down. I am sitting here now and I asked for a booster seat when we were seated and it never came. Drinks often come when the food is delivered. 30 minute wait when half the restaurant is empty. Management has staffing issues. Not sure why I keep coming back.
Dave G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/18/2016,"Waited almost an hour for our food which came out cold and had been sitting at the pass for so long it was completely dried out. We were a party of 4 and all 4 dishes had an issue. Two salads came out without their salad dressing,  asked for bbq wings and got spicy buffalo wings instead and the artichoke dip was solid from being completely dried out, and the asparagus that came out with the steak was shrank to the size of a string even the manager was embarrassed we were served it. She apologized and did her best to make things better but after waiting for an hour for our food and another 15-20 for them to fix all the problems it was a little too late. Our waiter had a good attutide but was not very attentive. 65 dollars was absurd for the food. Especially when one meal was already comped. We should have left but we were starving so we stayed. Never again."
