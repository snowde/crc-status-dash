Chuck C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,,2.0,10/27/2017,"The food was good and the beer was very good.  The service could have been better.  With one exception we were ignored by every employee in the restaurant.  The exception was the manager.  She showed us to our table when no one else would.  When she realized we hadn't been waited on after several minutes, she took our order.  She was even our busboy (the were too busy watching the ball game on the TV monitors).  The only other person who came to our table was somebody who presented us with our bill instead of our dessert."
Dana L.,"Sebastopol, CA",23,177,12,1.0,6/15/2017,"Run away! Awful experience here from beginning to end. Slow, unfriendly service. The place was mostly empty and the waiter could not keep up? When the food finally did come out, he got half of our groups orders wrong The food was not fresh, over-dressed, wilted salads & salad toppings that appeared and tasted like canned food. Not one of us, in a group of 6 people enjoyed the meal. When we got the bill we were actually charged for the wrong orders that we had returned to the kitchen! We had to spend an additional 10 minutes trying to flag down the waiter to get him to adjust the bill correctly. Ugh.... NEVER again."
Steve S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/1/2017,Jourdan our server was very good!  She is very friendly and the food was superb.
Christina M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",356,176,2003,3.0,10/15/2016,"Not so impressed with BJ""s as I used to be . The food can be a great value more bang for  your buck! Customer Service, long wait times and lack of visual management seem to be the top three areas of concern I observed on my last visit . Tables were unbussed for very long periods of time with customers waiting in the lobby yet 3 young people were hosting the from lobby ! I would've given more stars that after ordering nachos that just came with a sprinkling of cheese some chopped tomatoes something that seemed like leftover chili on the bottom and they were kind of dry and not that tasteful that definitely made them lose half a star, The other loss was the side of avocado they bought out to go on top of the nachos as we were told it came with it that was brown rotten and unappealing we left it on the side of our table nobody took it away finally I had to ask the waitress if she would remove it and asked why would you serve that, it's rotten she said one word - yes!   She proceeded to take away the dish but never bought us back any avocado how strange. We finished our appetizer mostly with her fingers after all it was a nachos but no napkins or silverware which we ended up asking the server for. The music was super loud the restaurant was packed we couldn't even hear them calling out the names and the front lobby and they never made an effort to walk out from behind the podium to make sure people heard them, even though three people were in the hosts area upfront. The visit we had before this one was equally as an impressive with food coming out at random times, the wrong items coming out, then forgetting that I was a BJ rewards member, and both visits neither one of the service thanked us for our visit asked us to come back and was absent of any customer service. So far far they are two for two strikes may give them my more opportunity to redeem themselves before I consider spending my money elsewhere. And some of my friends and coworkers and family like to go here for happy hour or occasional dinner so if I get invited I guess that would be the only reason I really want to go back to this particular location."
Theo P.,"San Mateo, CA",1,25,49,3.0,6/22/2017,The food was good. My order was screwed up but I did not send the meal back. The waiter was a little slow on filling my drink. I would recommend this BJ's.
Ricky D.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,20,3,5.0,1/20/2017,"I have always had an incredible experience at BJ's in Santa Rosa. Often my go to restaurant for a quick bite, the menu offers a huge array of items from salads, to burgers, to tasty seafood plates! There have been a few situations where I feel it takes a substantial amount of time for food to arrive or to get a drink topped off. The price of the food is perfect for a little date in the middle of the week. Definitely take advantage of the lunch specials, as my favorite is the all you can eat soup and salad for $8. Very tasty and you can refill with a different offering every time!"
Ellen P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/14/2017,"We have been to BJ's multiple times since they opened. We have always had an issue with at least one item. The last time I was there before last night, my lunch was so bad that it was not even edible. I lost my appetite, it was so bad. Manager comped my lunch. I swore I would never go back but my granddaughter wanted steak and it was too far of a drive to get to our steakhouse of choice. So off we went to BJ's. She ordered the top sirloin steak dinner. It came with a Caesar salad.....it was terrible. Soggy and wilted, maybe 6 croutons, and we had to ask for extra dressing. Then her steak arrived. It was blackened on the outside and raw inside. I am sure the mashed potatoes were instant....so gummy. We had our waiter get the manager, so he offered us another steak medium well, which is what I had originally ordered. It took 20 mins and arrived well done. She ate it because she was so hungry. Manager comped the meal. Then there were my Avocado egg rolls. I usually love these but not last nite, overly cooked and the pieces or avocado were brown and mushy. Terrible. But I let it go. About 10 mins later, a customer behind us had the manger come over because his pork chop was raw! Serious?  I am DONE...never ever going back. The manager named Jake was super nice but they desperately need to evaluate their food....and turn down the loudness. We could hardly hear each other. A let down for what could have been a great time."
Christine V.,"Pomona, CA",168,39,41,2.0,9/30/2017,"Took my family here to celebrate a birthday. The interior looks like a typical BJs and it looked clean. Didn't seem like a busy day, but the kitchen speed was very slow. After ordering food, it seemed to take years to get the food. There was a mistake by the waitress who took the order, but she was very good about switching and remedying the problem, so A+ for her. I also feel like they made her manage too many tables. She was really attentive to us, but then she was gone for a long long time taking care of other tables. So the food came out in several batches because we were a large table, but the quality was off. For example, the first plates of fries was really good, but the second batch didn't taste as good. They looked the same, but it seems it wasn't fried or seasoned as well. Avocado egg rolls was alright. Nothing special, I've had better elsewhere. Someone ordered the country fried steak and said it was very yummy and crispy. In terms of BJs as a chain, I've definitely had better consistency and quality of food at other places."
Micah R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",112,14,1,1.0,10/8/2016,"So frustrating. I ordered online (5:13pm) through Grubhub and it said it would be about 2 hours for delivery. I didn't see this as a problem as I've ordered through Grubhub before, it's a Saturday night, and I used to work in the restaurant industry so I knew they would be busy. About an hour and a half after I placed my order I get a call from the delivery person saying BJ's was busy but he would have my order to me around 7:15-7:30, also not a problem (and A+ for communication). Around 7:05pm, almost 2 hours after my order was placed, I get a call from FoodToYou about my Grubhub order. They said BJ's just called to let me know that one of the items I ordered was no longer on the menu. I pick a different item. Needless to say I am frustrated by this situation. It's now almost 8pm and my food isn't here. I'm assuming it's because BJ's waited 2 hours AFTER my order was placed to call and figure out if I wanted a replacement. Maybe don't offer extra services like delivery orders at your establishment when you can't even handle in-house business (which is clear from other reviews before me)? I would really appreciate a refund. *follow-up* food arrived at 8:15pm, 3 hours after I ordered it (clearly not Grubhub's fault). Shrimp tacos had 3 shrimp between 2 tacos. Also, it is clear my whole order was made before they called about the item I ordered that they no longer had."
Jessica S.,"Becker, MN",78,12,6,3.0,5/27/2017,"The food here was amazing! However, we were literally the only people in the restaurant and food took forever. The staff was nice when they actually came to the table. The place was very clean and nice though."
Michael C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,1,1,5.0,1/17/2017,What a great place. I had the Black and blue burger and it was a true taste bud tickler . WOW
Kevin W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",36,1,,5.0,10/21/2017,I was at the bar and Justin was really cool and easy to talk to! Definitely recommend for those that want to drink and chill :)
Rebecca F.,"Sebastopol, CA",21,7,,5.0,10/20/2017,"so we take our office staff out to lunch frequently for office meetings and have been to bj's a number of times.  The food is good; they have a huge selection and service is good too--yesterday we did have a problem in that two of the meals didn't come when everyone else was served lunch...we waited 15 minutes and I finally had to complain as we we didn't have all day....the waiter was flustered and apologized that they got slammed busy.  Big kudos to the manager who comped our meal, apologized, and asked if our homes had survived the fires.  We appreciated his taking our complaint seriously and making it better.  Because of that, we will be loyal customers over and over again"
Chris T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",29,46,4,5.0,5/23/2017,I really love the atmosphere here. The food is decent chain food. Nothing special but consistent. The service is hit and miss.  Justin the gay guy with the rainbow of pens in his apron is awesome as is Noah who brought our food out. I love all the sports and they have over 50 beers on tap. How could you go wrong? Beer and food make me happy.
Anonimo A.,"Sonoma, CA",0,8,9,1.0,9/29/2016,"SUPER SLOW SERVICE, FROM START TO FINISH. It took them 20 min to bring our drinks and 35 min for soup and salad to make it to our table. Server was not knowledgeable of the menu, we will be definitely NOT coming back here at all. I would give it 0 stars if I could"
Rae G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,1,2.0,3/31/2017,Been here multiple times. Service is usually fine. Food is OK. Today our server was so rude and I ordered the buffalo wings and this is how they came out...
Amanda M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,84,32,1.0,5/28/2017,"We come here for their beer dinners and always enjoy them. We use to love the food here and were always here eating, But it everything about it has gotten worse and worse over the years. Half the time the food has made me incredibly sick and I have complained numerous times about it and contacted Bj's about it, They just don't seem to care. Their food is never consistently made with the same ingredients and the service is hit or miss. We went in and sat in the bar area and waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged, It was not even busy and was mostly empty in that area. Our waitress was pleasant enough, But we ordered a pizza, a salad and my husband ordered a steak, the pizza never came out. Someone came out to talk to us about it (which we weren't in a hurry to have it any way) And apologized And said it didn't come out to his liking.  We were there for for about an hour and a half total and never did receive our pizza. We just asked the waitress to box it up for us, which she did. She saw that our daughter was fussing and still took her time to get us our check or anything else. When we received our check we were peeved to see the pizza on there for $23 and no discount or anything. We did not receive our food, I would have hoped that it would have been taken off or discounted without us asking. When we mentioned it she went to ask a manager and they took  $10 off. The only reason we went there is because we had a gift card, We use to love Bj's, but it is way over priced, the food is never consistent and half the time it makes you sick. The service is usually terrible as well, we really want to love this place And have given it tons of chances only to have it fall through."
Jennifer S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",62,2,,1.0,10/6/2017,Every time I come here there's always some kind of issue. Our food is slow or there's always a person singled out with no food. The drinks are so slow your food can come first before your first drink.  It's always so sorry and you can tell the waiter is use to this disoriented mess. They really never compensate for anything.
Jennifer S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,7,1.0,10/18/2016,"I just ordered a delivery from here and ordered a Cesar Salad for $11 right. I received a ice berg lettuce with crutons. No Romain lettuce or cheese, just lame. I've been to other really low quality restaurants that serve a Cesar salad right. Come on BJ'S you should be ashamed of yourself.  Plus the rest of my $45 order was just ok. All I can say is none of it was worth $45!"
Dan J.,"San Francisco, CA",10,34,1,2.0,3/24/2017,"The food was fair.  Not amazing but fine. The kitchen was exceptionally slow. Two meals for our table, yet they came out almost 15 minutes apart. The restaurant was not at all busy, as we visited late at night, but the experience seemed to drag on forever and every step took so, so long. Plan extra time if you'd like to try this place."
