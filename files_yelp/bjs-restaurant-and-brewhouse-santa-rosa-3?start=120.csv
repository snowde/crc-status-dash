Tony H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/22/2017,"Really going down hill Lunch on a Tuesday.  Not super crowded Ran out of lemonade. Food took 40 minutes. Waitress apparently was shy as we didn't see her that often... though she did come by to say she was sorry, didn't know what was happening, except that they didn't have enough people working....    and when food got there... the order was wrong.. close mind you; but wrong."
Liva P.,"San Diego, CA",6,3,,3.0,6/8/2017,"I was a bit disappointed this time around. Although the waitress (Rebecca) - had to ask for the name) was nice, she was very forgetful. The steak wasn't even average and not cooked how is asked. I ordered some prosecco... It was brought to me with a glass, the bottle not opened. I felt like that was saying "" here, open it"". The artichoke dip wasn't hot when it came to my tablet."
Dan W.,"Denver, CO",23,94,61,3.0,3/7/2016,"BJ's is a middle-of-the-road establishment. I wasn't so overwhelmed that I must come back, but I wasn't disappointed either. You know you will get a solid food selection for a decent price. I had the Ahi tuna salad and it didn't disappoint. The Sriracha brussels sprouts were great.  Our server was friendly and refilled the drinks before they hit the bottom, which is always a plus. The experience wasn't the same for everyone to my party. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, and noted that they weren't very good compared to previous visits. Maybe a fluke?  Lastly, their deep deep-fried skills need some work as my kids chicken tenders, mini corndogs, and french fries were a bit overcooked/burnt.  Luckily, they drowned them all and ketchup and were satisfied enough. Again, BJ's is the middle-of-the-road place. You know what you'll get, which is nice, but you won't be overly impressed on my opinion.  Solid choice for a family outing. I'd give 3 1/2 stars if I could."
Pattie H.,"Forestville, CA",9,1,,1.0,3/1/2017,"So many bad things to say, just going to list them: It took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order. Received the drinks we ordered; the Diet Dr Pepper was flat and flavorless and the water tasted like it was right out of the tap. The Brussels Sprouts appetizer arrived looking liked someone had tried unsuccessfully to drizzle the sauce on but maybe the device broke and spewed the sauce all over in messy disgusting blobs.  They were also served without the usual accompanying small plates which we had to ask for repeatedly from several servers.  They finally arrived 10 minutes later. We had asked for a replacement napkin when it fell on the floor and a new fork but after asking several servers in a row we finally received them after 20 minutes. The Jambalaya arrived looking like it had been under the heat lamp for an extraordinarily long amount of time and was flat and old looking; it also had very little meat. The Clam Chowder in a sourdough bowl was very foul (I nearly vomited it up at home!) and the bread bowl was so tough you couldn't tear it off or even cut it with a knife. The silverware was seemingly old and weird, everything kept sticking to it and wouldn't even wipe off with a napkin; the knives were a dull joke. The waitress brought the bill after waiting one whole hour and when she dropped off the bill she asked us for the first time if we were interested in having our drinks refilled!!!"
Michael B.,"Vacaville, CA",95,124,6,2.0,10/4/2016,"My wife and I are here tonight.  Our server was great, but the food - not so much.  We both ordered burgers - guacamole one for her and hickory BBQ for me.  We both asked that they be done medium. Both came VERY well done. So well done that both burgers were burned enough in one side that we could both taste the charcoal! We like the chain, but likely won't be back to this location again.   Had it not been for the service, this visit would have been a solid 1 star."
Mary S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,1,5.0,7/14/2017,Just ate lunch here and had the shrimp tacos that were delicious! Thanks to the manager and our server we had excellent service and the manager comped our calamari and put in a new order because the first ones were a little over done! Can't complain! Would definitely come back here with more friends!
Hilton A.,"Napa, CA",0,15,,3.0,4/10/2017,"Went there over the weekend. Hadn't been in for a while. Bit disappointing. Portions are smaller, and they don't serve their delicious wedge fries anymore. They went to regular fries. They try to call the new fries ""steak fries"", but they aren't. Too bad...."
Manuel M.,"San Leandro, CA",56,28,24,1.0,3/25/2017,"We ordered 3 drinks. 1 strawberry Virginia Margherita, 1 Reg strawberry Margherita, and 1 Top Shelf Margherita. The total was $30. Way too expensive and way to watered down. Not worth it! Very disappointed! Don't go for drinks at BJ'S!"
Varshana C.,"Occidental, CA",83,122,91,4.0,9/16/2016,I love this location! They have a great little patio with heat lamps above that keep you nice and toasty when having a evening dinner outside. The bar area is seat yourself and it is usually easy to find a high top during their rush on a Friday night.  They obviously have a large selection of beers on tap and there is always something to choose from their list of speciality drinks.   It is a chain restaurant though and with that comes a large menus and a hard choice.  There is too much to choose from and it can cause a problem. It takes a while for food to come out when they are slammed but their staff usually acknowledges it and keeps you updated.   I have had pretty good experiences here with servers.  They all seem happy and like treat their customers right.  I am a sucker for the twisted BLT salad.. I think that's what it's called.  It's delicious and goes fabulous when you are just getting a quick drink after dinner since it is not a large size.  I recently started to order on the mobile app and pick up lunch here and that works quite well too.
Kate B.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/4/2017,Had amazing costumer service thanks to our waiter Justin! Great smile and very on top of refills and checking back on us! Definitely would come back great food!
Avory G.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,6,,2.0,10/3/2017,"my friends and I were not satisfied from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. as soon as we walked in we waited at the front desk for almost 10 mins before a worker acknowledged us. (mind you, it's a tuesday night and the place is pretty empty) we were finally seated and my friends didn't know what they wanted so the waitress gave us a bit more time. she seemed pretty annoyed and we finally ordered our good. when my food came out, all of my chips for dip was all small and broken as if it was the very end of their chip bag. the pieces were so small and broken that i had to use a spoon to eat my chips and dip. i also ordered calamari and it was very stale and hard and all of the breading was on the plate instead of the calamari. i ended up sending it back. for how pricey the food is, the service and the quality of the food should be better. we probably won't come back."
Kirstie C.,"Petaluma, CA",45,39,,2.0,11/26/2016,The service was okay- no napkins no utensils and our food arrived warm and the prices and quality are not comparable .  The grilled cheese sandwich for kids had terrible rubbery cheese and my salad metric was a tad old and the I feel like calamari has gone down hill or more like something you heat up.  A nearby waitress waited on her patrons and I picked up a bit impatient attitude.  The hostesses that night 11/25 around 5pm were busy chatting to not greet us when we walked in until she turned around through direction of a waiter.  The alcoholic beverage I had (sangria ) was pretty good. My husband liked his pizza but said he would have rather bought WalMarts take and bake  We unfortunately do not plan to go back
Helen G.,"Petaluma, CA",36,188,219,5.0,5/11/2017,"We came in tonight and haven't been here since they opened so I was about excited to see the menu! Justin was our server ! By far, he is the best server we have ever had! Hands down! He was sweet, attentive and extremely helpful with the menu and seemed to truly love his job! Very accommodating ! Pedro the manager is also an amazing human being! Extremely professional and was on the floor making sure everyone was happy and the employees were doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing! What I loved the most about Pedro, he's ok with getting his hands dirty! No micro managing here! Come see Justin and I assure you,  you will have an amazing experience! Especially if you little ones!!!!"
Mada Z.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/25/2017,Waitress apologized 3 times for how long the food was taking. Food was room temperature and the steak was over cooked.
Margo C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/20/2016,"Everytime I go to BJs, the service and wait time becomes worse and worse. We were a party of two on a TUESDAY night, and told it would take us 15-20 min to seat us, which was fine. We waited over 25 min, and 2 parties who came after us were seated first. Then we waited an additional 10-15 min for our server. He took the order for the two tables that came after us first, and didn't acknowledge until we decided to leave. We're not intimidating, slum, or anything of the sort. I used to be a waitress myself, always carried a smile, worked my ass off, and gave guests my undivided attention. Everyone was special, and I'd always check back every 10-15 min. The standards of this place are HORRIBLE! Granted, your stay depends on the server-- I've only had one good experience here. Either get more servers, or take action on the employees who call out frequently, and chit chat with co-workers when it's busy!!"
Rena V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/7/2017,I think all the employees here should learn to have more humor or sense of empathy for their customer....my family walked in and i ask a question to a man and I'm aware he isn't a server maybe a host and felt like he was pretty mean...
Keylee P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,7,,2.0,3/25/2017,"Wish i could rate higher but they dont deserve it. I've gave this resturants multiple tries and the only food that seems to please me is the pozokie and avoacado eggrolls. I went here to celebrate my graduation. I order a deep dish pizza and there was barely any sauce and the dough wasnt cooked. The most recent time i went here i told myself i would only get a pozokie, i didnt. I got chicken strips and french fries and they were cold. I regret not sticking to my word. I recommend getting the oreo pozokie or regular chocolate chip."
Kris R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/20/2017,This place is just getting worse every time I come back.  The staff always seem like it's there first day working there.  Slow to be seated and finally got waiter to take my order.  I did order a glass of wine also and nothing.  I waited for a 1/2 hour and finally just left.  This is the last time I will go. I will not give them another chance.
Chris F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/10/2017,Don't order the ribs it took over an hour and they were dry as beef jerky .. we did not eat it and they still charged us.
Keila C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Not even worth a star. Thought maybe Bj's in Santa Rosa would be the same as the one in Terra Linda. Wrong. Terrible food. Its my third time coming here, thought maybe this time food would be better but got disappointed once again. Ordered an appetizer and the lady didn't even bring plates for each one of us in the table. Once the food comes, my boyfriend's brisket burger was cold and the cheese wasn't even well cooked, I ordered a side of original bone in wings and they were dry af and cold. Totally gross, the celery coming on the side was dried and seemed old didn't even seem washed. Just to top it all up, we waited for so long. Nothing wrong with the customer service but management over here sucks and people at the kitchen don't know how to serve food according to their freaking expensive prices. Plus bathrooms are gross. And the mustard bottle is disgusting."
