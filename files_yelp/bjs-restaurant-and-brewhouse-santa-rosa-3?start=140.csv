Josh M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/1/2017,"This place has good food but what a f@!king joke this place is.30+ min to get my cold/burnt calamari, 45 min to get half my dinner +8 min to bring the rest of my dinner. This place is rolling down hill with no f@!ks given by any employee or management if that have any at all. Don't wast you time or money here."
Jess K.,"Rohnert Park, CA",7,11,,1.0,12/28/2016,"We watched 5 tables who had been seated after us, receive their food, eat, pay and leave before us. When we received our appetizer (from a bus boy, not our waitress) we were not given silverware and despite our efforts to get someone's attention, we just ate with our hands. On top of that, the appetizer was clearly not fresh or what we ordered! There were two avocado egg rolls on the plate but all the others were filled with some sort of mystery meat like filling. It didn't taste right and looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. As we watched other people eating and leaving, we were unattended to for nearly 1 hour. When another bus boy finally brought our meals, we still had no silverware and had to ask. When we opened up the silverware, it was dirty and we had to flag down someone else for a clean set. Then we noticed that they had neglected to bring out my husbands baked potato. We had to flag the waitress again who went and retrieved it but by that time, he had already finished his meal. He decided to eat it anyway but with the first bite he found it was still hard in the middle! Not even cooked! We sat there, for nearly 30 MORE minutes waiting to be acknowledged but that never happened. Our waitress looked as if she was tending to 3-4 too many tables at once. She was running frantically around all over the restaurant and into the kitchen. There were dozens of empty tables and people were waiting 10+ minutes to be seated. Not sure if their staffing wasn't up to par or what. What a joke!! When she finally came back we expressed our concerns, mostly about the kitchen, and she told us that she was sorry and that it's been bad for about 2 months. So 1.5 hours later we are finally leaving and reluctantly paying for poor quality food and a terrible experience. Defiantly won't be coming back! You need some serious improvement when it comes to management! 2 days later and still no response from management about my experience. Spend your money elsewhere because this restaurant certainly doesn't care about its customers or their experiences."
Caelyn M.,"Petaluma, CA",0,7,,2.0,8/24/2017,"Decided to go to BJS, it's open super late and normally the food is between ok and really good. Food was undercooked. We asked for waters upon sitting down, didn't get them. Manager stopped by our table probably because I looked unhappy because I was starving. We asked the manager for two waters, got one. Service was super slow, which it normally is but we keep returning because the food is pretty good. We order a pazookie Togo and she gave us the wrong one. So now I'm home bitter and pazookie- less"
Claire P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,7,,4.0,9/5/2017,"This restaurant is great, yes. The food is similar to Applebee's. Some of the more simple items you can tell are the frozen/reheated type, some are more tasty and fresh. A huge pro to this restaurant is they have a large variety of foods on the menu. They also list the calories which is nice. The pricing is decent and the inside is beautiful. My only complaint is the waiting staff and their timing. It seems that every single time I come, no matter my waiter/waitress, they cannot have my appetizer/meal come at a time that is appropriate. Either they forget my appetizer entirely, or it comes AFTER I receive my main meal. This is a minor issue but when it happens again and again, it's a real bummer and makes me question what's going on in there that makes it so damn impossible for a single waiter to get it even semi correct. The last time I went was most likely my last."
ken b.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,12,,5.0,4/30/2017,Wow. Just had lunch at BJs. Somehow our order was delayed and the server first came out and apologized... we thought that was cool cuz we Hadn't really noticed but then the manager came to our table to personally apologize for the long wait.. and then comped our meal ...and yet we hadn't even complained! That is exemplary service and we'll be back! Our server was Matthew S. great job!
Nadia P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,8,8,1.0,12/19/2016,Waited over an hour for fish tacos . Not even many people In the place!! Will never be back. Terrible service and food. Don't mind waiting if it's busy but it was a joke! Only had fish tacos of the lunch menu. Awful !!
Jessica M.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,,1.0,8/16/2017,"I've given this restaurant multiple chances, and this was definitely the last one. The food took forty five minutes to come out, was cold, and- to be frank- pretty gross. They changed our waiter three times during our meal and each one was very obviously untrained and unfriendly. We ordered ice cream for dessert, which they decided to bring immediately after bringing the entree, and they were melted. My silverware and glass was not clean, and I had to remind them three times to bring me new ones. I will definitely NOT be coming back and I highly recommend that potential diners STAY AWAY"
Hanna B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",57,3,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Me and my bf were supposed to go here gor our 2 yr anniversary. He made a reservation 2 days prior, yet when we got there his name wasnt in the computer. The person on the phone wasnt professional and was rude. And the person seating people didnt even seem to care that a reservation was supposed to be made. Not the way to run a business. Definitely wont be going here again!"
Patricia M.,"Santa Clara, CA",2,8,8,5.0,3/20/2017,"Our server Gary Michael made this the best experience out of any Bj's I've been to! He was fabulous, funny, and went above and beyond anything I expected! THANK YOU!!!"
Cami S.,"Cazadero, CA",43,8,1,1.0,11/14/2016,"Ok So yesterday after a long week my husband took our family out for lunch over an hour drive, got to BJs waited about 10 minutes to be seated was 3:30 Ordered appetizers avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms, then for meal we ordered classic chicken Sandwich with sliced wedge fries and buffalo burger which she didn't ask my husband what he wanted for a side. Kids got applesauce and lemonade. We were just going to share the appetizers and fries with them. Ok, so we chat a bit, I see two tables get food before us that came after us. I glance at my phone it's 4:11. So 41 minutes had passed. Waitress walks up with avocado rolls. We grub down and then she doesn't come back. I see the table next to us get food. I start looking pist off and the waitress decides to finally come back, we ask where's our mushroom and our lunch? She responds oh I'll just take mushrooms off, your food has been ready it's sitting were just waiting for the wedge fries to be ready. I say ""my foods back there sitting and you didn't think to come tell me hey you want your food while we wait for the fries?"" She looks at me shocked like communication with your guests is something nobody has ever heard of.  I say ""bring me the food, and just bring the fries when they're done"" She says ok and goes to get our food.  Comes back with the food which you can tell was under a lamp because the plate was hot as sin and the bread was soggy from the sauces sitting. Was so pist off at this point but the kids were fussy and needling to eat ASAP or I would have moved our family next door to sea tai noodle which BTW has extraordinary service and food is on point every time.  Mushrooms never came she figures since she forgot to put in the order she'd just take it off our tab, but I ordered mushrooms because I WANTED mushrooms, what she should have done was brought the mushrooms and then apologized for the lack of communication and then taken them off my tab for her inability to serve guests correctly. Lesson learned. I'll never go there again. Whoever manages this place needs to do employee training and be clear on communication between servers and guests. Just because you forget to put in a order doesn't mean your guest shouldn't receive the order. That's your screw up, not the guests. Sea Tai Noodle it will be next time."
Daniel H.,"San Jose, CA",507,1495,8561,2.0,2/14/2015,"My coworkers and I came here for an early dinner.  It wasn't that busy and parking was plentiful in this big plaza that the restaurant was located in.  There were 6 of us so we all squeezed into a booth perfectly fine.  There was a ton of selection on the menu and I don't remember that much when I went to a BJ's Restaurant at another location; however, that was like five years ago so things could have changed.   The menu ranged from salads to steak to pasta to dessert and everything in between.  The rest of our table were still deciding what to order so a few of us ordered drinks.  I ordered the Jerry Burst ($5.95) for a drink which was a cider blend.  A little while later, our waitress came back to take our orders.  I chose the Cajun Pasta ($13.75) because it sounded good to me and I didn't want to eat something like a burger.  I don't remember what everybody else ordered so this will be one of those picture posts without labels. The Jerry Burst was not bad but I probably should have ordered something else if I was going for hard cider.  We waited a long time for our food to come out.  The Cajun Pasta was okay at best and it was a lot for one person.  I was working on it when our waitress came by to ask if we wanted dessert.  Just because everybody else at the table except me was close to being finished doesn't mean you should ask if we wanted dessert.  To me, that was like telling us to leave sooner so the table could be cleaned up for another potential group of people.  I wasn't too happy about that and I had a lot of food left so not sure why she still asked. The food was okay here and maybe I just had bad luck coming here.  I probably won't come back."
Cheryl R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",17,3,1,1.0,10/16/2016,Only giving one star because it was the absolute worst service I have ever had! The server was MIA most of the time. Took over an hour to get food and someone else actually brought it out. Took forever to get refills. Asked to speak to a manager and they couldn't even show up! Very disappointed. Will more than likely be my last trip there.
Lily A.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,8,1,1.0,1/13/2017,As if it could have gotten any worse... my whole table got food poisoning after dining here. Never ever ever again.
John M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,3,1.0,3/21/2017,Worst ever. I will not go back. I think our waitress ate my unlimited salad and soup.
Julie S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,4.0,2/19/2017,"I've come here with my family many times, the food is always good but most of the time the service is severely lacking. Tonight was the BEST service we've ever gotten. The kitchen was slammed and our food took a long time but it wasn't so bad because our server Gary Micheal was so attentive. He checked back made sure we knew the food was on the way, kept our drinks full and dazzled us with his humor and great attitude. Our server did all this while taking extra tables all over the restaurant, we were very pleased and will be coming back soon because of his outstanding service! Thank you so much, we will make sure to request you every time!  5 star service!!! Thanks Gary!"
Joana G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,36,24,3.0,2/3/2016,I'm giving it a three because  I didn't really appreciate how rude they acted when I wanted to sit far FROM A BIRTHDAY FKN CROWD... I wanted some peace..some alone time. I was surrounded by everyone and their mother. Anyways. I love bjs don't get me wrong. But I over heard the host speak rudely about me wanting to sit away from everyone. He whined about me sitting in his area. That right there can ruin the whole mood.  Anyways food was great. Staff put on a fake as smile and my host came with a fake ass smile and attitude.. he was sweet.  Too bad the only other bjs around here is in terra Linda
Mara B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",63,81,12,4.0,7/10/2016,"I was a bit dubious about coming here, due to negative Yelp reviews. However, my 30+ daughter had liked it, so we went there to complete our girly day after mani-pedi's.     We were quite happy with our meals - delicious! Our server was a bit new at the task, but acquitted herself just fine.     Introduced ourselves to the manager, and he seemed like an OK guy."
Jim C.,"Sausalito, CA",1,8,,5.0,2/7/2017,A favorite for years. Great menu selection that changes through the year. Food is always excellent and consistent. Their rewards program is one of the best in the business. Their staff and service is always first class. Highly recommend!
Lauren F.,"Wilsonville, OR",407,386,600,4.0,9/21/2014,"Excellent service, menu variety, delicious $ - $$ The atmosphere reminds me other places like Elephant Bar, but this place is way better than those other places. My experience last night was great! I celebrated my husband and my dad's birthday, so there was a total of 5 in our party last night.  Thanks to our awesome server, Michael L, for being an awesome waiter. He had a great attitude (very positive and upbeat), quick with everything, and made our night very pleasant.  Menu variety was overwhelmingly awesome. I love their beer selection! I had the Jeremiah Red and decided to pair that with my cherry salmon entree, which was hands down one of my favorite dishes, ever. Generous portions, too.  Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking to eat out with a group of people or if you're on a date :) Great food and portions for the prices."
