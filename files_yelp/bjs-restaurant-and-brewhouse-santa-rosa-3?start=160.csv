Mo M.,"Ukiah, CA",589,61,60,5.0,6/20/2016,"I had my first experience at this restaurant about a week ago. The service was good, the food was delicious and served quickly and they have a lot of good beer on tap."
Greg M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",52,9,3,1.0,10/2/2016,"How is this place still in business? Seriously, it gets worse every time I go back. It shouldn't take 45 mins to make a med burger, which makes sense that it came out black. Not well done, black. I said I wouldn't eat it and the server got me a new one. Grand totally of almost 2 hours in the place. It wouldn't be so bad I guess if our server didn't look like she hated her life and us for being a part of it. Don't go here, save your money."
Jeff T.,"Upland, CA",255,37,54,2.0,4/6/2016,I ordered the mini pizza and berry cider...i had an allergic reaction to one of the berries or apple in the cider so i stop drinking it after 4 drinks and ask for a box for my food...server asked what is wrong and i told her...however she did not ask the manager to take my drink off my bill it is still 3/4 full. ..shoulda asked this question but never did...very disappointed
Vincent F.,"Windsor, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/9/2017,"I love coming to BJ's and this visit was no different. Came  in the afternoon and had a great bartender name Molly. Super nice and knowledgeable about the food and especially the beer. It's not very often that someone knows more about beer than me, and she recommended Jeremiah Red Ale which was delicious and fulfilled my pallet. I also munched down on some Mediterranean Chicken Tacos, cooked perfectly and arrived promptly. I'm not pretentious or a stickler about food and understand that restaurants the size of BJ's deal with a ton of traffic. These guys do the best they can and always deliver with a smile on their face!"
Ryan M.,"San Francisco, CA",24,52,30,1.0,11/8/2016,"The food is horrible, the service is even worse, and they charge way too much. You might as well go to Applebee's or Olive Garden, cause the microwave is the most used appliance in the kitchen. Try to get a refill on your drink there, I dare you."
Em L.,"Sacramento, CA",216,724,40,5.0,7/29/2015,"Having never been to a BJ's, I figured it would be decent food in a chain restaurant atmosphere.  However, the service was fantastic. Folks were genuinely friendly. Being fairly late on a Tuesday, the atmosphere was pleasantly charged with summertime, beer and gathered friends. This location has a large front patio with comfy seating and a few tv's. A great space to sit and have a drink while you wait for your food.  When you're craving the ultimate suburban experience - positive energy, bustling staff, American style food and good beer on the restaurant patio - BJ's is it."
Glenn S.,"Sebastopol, CA",116,35,23,2.0,9/13/2016,"The restaurant was clean and there were lots of choices on the menu and wait staff is nice. But it took us 15 minutes to get seated , 20 minutes or so to get our menus, and then about another 45 minutes or so to get our food. The food was underwhelming and overpriced we won't be back again"
Amy E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,21,,1.0,4/28/2017,Came for drinks and we were going to stay for dinner.  Filthy glassware!   I cringe!  Not to mention the green thing stuck to the inside of my beer glass.  Disgusting.  Paid bill asked for mgr Pedro only to wait and wait!  Leaving and headed to a better situation.  Watch out for your health's sake!!!
Sharon B.,"Petaluma, CA",64,6,,5.0,12/18/2016,"Angela was a terrific waitress, food was quite well done. Ahi salad. Look for dots of Wasabi on the sides of the bowl."
Mike T.,"Rocklin, CA",3,10,,1.0,9/13/2016,Slow night Monday figured we'd eat at bar and it wouldn't take long.  30 minutes later still no food but three different times we were told food was coming.  Waited so long had to get it to go and when we finally checked order in car no fries with that burger.  At this point why wait another 15-20 minutes for fries.  Ridiculous service.  Never eat here again.
Kim G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",23,23,7,1.0,2/24/2016,"I wish there was a zero star rating. Multiple visits to this location and every single time we leave irritated abut something. Tonight was the final visit. After a very friendly smile and greeting we waited for a reasonable amount of time and then we were seated. A table for two. Easy enough. In the middle of the dining floor at a booth. After 15 minutes of multiple servers  walking by not making eye contact and not one acknowledgment that we were there we decided to leave and go elsewhere. When we passed the host stand in the front I said we were leaving so our table was open and was returned a simple, 'OK, thanks' I'm disappointed with this location. BJs as a chain is much better than this staff consistently represents."
R J.,"Windsor, CA",2,3,,1.0,9/23/2016,"Had the worst experience here last night. It should have been a sign of what was to come while waiting in the lobby and nobody was getting seated right away. Party of 9 and our dinner took two hours. 6 out of the 9 received there dinners after an hour. 10 minutes later two other receive their dinners then mine 20 minutes after that! By the time I got my meal everyone was done. The server was apologetic and said the manager was cooking and said he would come out to talk with us. Never came out. Seemed like most of the staff there quit and there were only a couple of people running that place. Very strange! Horrible service! It's disappointing because I really like there food, but the service is so bad I don't ever want to go back. Something seriously needs to change there, or they are going to lose lots of customers!"
Dianna M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4,24,4,4.0,3/20/2016,I like BJs brunch menu. I been there a few times and every time food was great. My kids love it.
Kristy P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",101,3,,5.0,1/20/2017,Mathew was awesome! We come quite often and he has been the best waiter yet! He was funny and kept us laughing the entire time! Very entertaining! Thanks Matthew!
Peter K.,"San Jose, CA",2,7,2,1.0,4/11/2017,Went for lunch on a Tuesday. Waited an hour for mediocre food with no check ins or explanations. Our server disappeared. We found out later that he was pulled into kitchen. The kind of meal you regret. Avoid this place.
Kelly S.,"Campbell, CA",174,2,,4.0,1/10/2017,Our server Isabella was very patient and friendly and we enjoyed our time while we were in town. It was a late night and she was incredibly kind for such late service
Judy H.,"Shingle Springs, CA",0,34,,2.0,4/17/2017,"The main thing this restaurant had going for it was our waitress/server, Athene.  She was fun, had a great personality, and was knowledgeable about the menu and the specials. Now to the food. The HOT wings were way too spicey, the food orders got lost somewhere in la la land; one order arrived well after the others. Two people ordered prime rib-one order had a small piece of meat and the other a huge piece-all for the same price! Might come back someday when I am in the area."
Anna M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/12/2017,"Worst experience ever. Came here for a quick bite to eat with my friend and her mom for lunch. It took about 45 minuets for them to get their food. They didn't bring my food out with the other food no big deal but I didn't get my food until everyone was almost done eating. When I did get it my soup was cold, didn't get the salad I ordered, and it was soggy. The server didn't even check to see if my food was ready until I asked. We asked three times for a refill and he just couldn't bother himself to help us. He questioned our tip amount and the payment method. He hovered while we were putting our money down. He wasn't around to help us until it was time to pay. I don't think I will be back. Very disappointed."
Bob L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",51,187,,2.0,3/12/2015,"it pains me to do this, but the quality of things has been slowly declining the last couple of times I've been here. Service is Ok, a tad slow but they are always busy so no biggie. The food however, I expect more at this price point, it just seems, not quite sure the right word, bland?  It's like there's a formula and they don't deviate from it, everything tastes the same I don't know, I'm just not not as big a fan as I was, better places in Sonoma County to spend my money"
Don M.,"Cotati, CA",8,22,2,2.0,5/26/2017,"First time my family went it was shortly after they'd opened, so I chalked the terrible service up to it being new. At the time food was sent out 20 minutes apart and the most recent order at that time was cold, the wait was long for a check etc. Since then I've heard better things, maybe it's just my luck, I don't know. Went last night, ordered drinks, my wife received a strawberry lemonade vs a Lynchberg Lemonade which we'd ordered. No big deal, so we ordered dinner, which was very good, and at the same time we ordered dinner we ordered my daughter the mini pazooki (sp?) off the kids menu. After we'd been done eating for some time and were left just sitting there we flagged the young lady and asked about the desert, no problem she said. We continued to wait, and wait, and wait. I ended up flagging her down again and politely said we'd hold off on the desert, asked for the check please. So we got the check and an apology, that she didn't know why it was taking so long. Review the check, we were charged for the appetizer that per their current promotion was supposed to be free, which the young lady apologized for and corrected. Then we found we were charged for the strawberry lemonade which wasn't ordered nor consumed. To top it off, we did see the credit for the desert item BUT we were being charged for, and I'm sure ordered, the full size one for almost $8 vs the one off the kids menu we ordered for our daughter for $2.50 I hoped for a better experience"
