Kent B.,"Modesto, CA",0,10,,1.0,1/7/2017,"Well this BJ location just continues in its horrible service.  In my four previous visits I had to either address failures in service or food quality.  With the last two brought to the attention of management I truly hoped to see improvement, but I was wrong.  22 minutes to even have someone come to the table with three return visits to clarify our order.  The place is always packed with youths so I can only assume this is the desired clientele.   And I support this statement with the observation of most alll the servers spending time ""BSing"" and not providing service.  Horrible service, cold food and other customers cussing and being obnoxious,  this will be our last visit to this location."
D O.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/6/2017,"Dustin did fantastic job taking care of us yesterday! He is fast, friendly and efficient! I love BJ's extensive menu. Their steak, ribs, Twisted BLT salad, roasted Brussel Sprouts are some of our favorites!"
T S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,29,1,2.0,1/3/2017,"Lunch was good.  Had the hawaiin pizza, unique.  Service was slow and disorderly despite the large number of wait staff.  It was busy but could have been more efficient."
Josue C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,4/7/2017,I would leave no stars if possible after being seated for 20 min on a slow Friday night many waiters walked by and didn't offer to get us drinks. Many other tables got seated after us and were helped after only a couple minutes of waiting; I won't be coming back to this specific BJ's and would recommend to stir clear of this establishment.
Drake M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",84,8,17,1.0,12/31/2016,"This place has failed to impress me on numerous occasions. When I first started going here, the food was great and the service was decent. The last 3-4 times, the food has been bland, undercooked, over cooked, and not worth what you pay for. Every time I go in now other parties are complaining and asking for managers because it is so slow and horrible. It took them 2 & 1/2 hours to bring us our food on several occasions and then we had to wait another 45 minutes just to get the check. Probably not coming back."
Danny Z.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,7,3,1.0,9/29/2016,"Horrible food and service, Don't waste your time and money.... I regretted my self for ever ! Poorrrrrr"
Joe L.,"Ross, CA",0,38,,2.0,6/28/2017,"Went in for Lunch. Slowest service ever. Could barely eat my food before I had to get back to work. Had been in previously for dinner. Beer is okay but sub par for sonoma county, so many better local places. Not in a ""rush"" to go back."
Adam B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",13,23,4,3.0,5/12/2016,"The long and the short of it is this: we came here with a party of 6 on a busy Saturday. Service was pretty good considering. When it came to our main dishes (3 pizzas), there was a slight delay which we barely noticed until the manager himself came by to apologize. But when they did bring us our pizzas, one of them was entirely wrong. The manager came by again to apologize again. Ultimately, he added a forgotten topping to the same pizza to sort of half-correct the issue, but also offered us a free pizza to go (the correct one). It means a lot to me that the manager would own up to a mistake and apologize in person. I've been to a few BJ's and I will probably continue to to go to them, even though it seems like every time we go there is always, like ALWAYS some minor screw up. Nothing so egregious to stop us from going, but seriously BJ's? How hard is it to find good wait staff in like EVERY city you operate in? You have a fun atmosphere, but 'professional service' would not be one of the terms I would use to describe my experiences. Now, my friends and I will go and almost take bets on what stupid thing they are going to screw up. Oh well, first world problems I guess."
Hermann M.,"Sebastopol, CA",1,237,,3.0,3/2/2017,"This is another one of those places I forgot to review because I haven't been here in years, so this is more like what it used to be, not what it is now. I'd give it 5 stars for beers, theirs & guest taps, 4 stars for food, & 2? stars for service. The 1st time I came here, a girl washing the front windows turned around, ran into me & tripped me as I was walking in. Another time I came for lunch, the order was wrong & took a long time, but the bartender refused to correct it. I've been to over a dozen BJ's in the past 20 years from here to samdiego, but this one had the worst service from the start. I loved their Tatonka Stout, PM Porter, Jeremiah Red, & their IPA too. They even made a 10% Grand Cru annually. For a chain, BJ's was a great place to stop when traveling to drink & eat, especially when there were no other local breweries around. Happy hour & dinner were both good, & most had a larger selection of guest beers than their own on draft. Never cared for the wall of sports tv's or the high noise level, however. Someday we'll have to return to update this, but it seems to have received so many bad reviews lately, I'm in no hurry now."
Ceecee M.,"San Jose, CA",136,195,170,2.0,6/18/2015,"Yuck!  Two stars are for the okay service, but the food was absolutely distasteful.  Stopped by for an early lunch with my sisters and mom.  We were quickly seated and given menus. Despite the almost empty restaurant, it took a while for our orders. I decided to try one of their fish dish with mahi mahi. It was horrible! I could not eat it. The description mentioned veggies. Well this dish was lacking them all.  The fish tasted like old canned tuna gone bad. I was unable to eat it. I had some of the rice that came with it, but that was hard to swallow too! Unfortunately, I will not be returning to a BJs anytime soon and especially this one."
Sandy F.,"Willits, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/12/2017,I gave it a second chance. Never again!  Waited forever for cold spaghetti with very little sauce and dry burnt meatballs. The roll was good. From the looks of other reviews it sounds like some changes need to be made before it's too late to keep customers coming in.
Chuck C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2016,"Have been here a couple times and have not had a very good experience. Ordered Calamari and received the a very small amount on a rectangular plate missing the marinara missing. The ""not very friendly"" waitress (If you can call her that) says that the marinara is on the way. Well, It never arrived and she had the audacity to ask how the meal was....Will not come back again. She did not even apologize."
maria v.,"Calistoga, CA",7,47,106,4.0,1/26/2016,I've been to this restaurant  a few times I like there food.The dishes we ordered  where a good portion  and tasted good. Atmosphere  was good we went kinda late so it was not to noisy.Our waiter was very attentive  and asking if we needed anything.Its a nice restaurant  to have drinks and just hang out with friends.There prices aren't to expensive.
Justin L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",304,16,1,1.0,10/26/2016,When you order a salad and you wait 20 minutes for it and it is still not there.  The damn pizza will be here before the salad
Em C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",29,154,155,4.0,2/25/2015,"I'm actually kind of surprised that I think this place is decent. The service has always been great, but maybe that's because I'm usually by myself when I come here for dinner. Services is usually pretty spot on and the staff has always been super nice despite being busy.  The food is alright. I've had an entree or two that I wasn't feeling (capellini), but I recently had the chicken parm which was pretty yummy (lemon on parm is actually really good).  They're open pretty late which is nice since there isn't much open late in Santa Rosa."
Monica C.,"Fremont, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/3/2016,"The food had no taste. Very bland. Needed to add some flavor to everything we go. Moscow mule did not come in a cooper cup, very disappointing. I know how petty it sounds but even dive bars have'em. Not to mention the servers were very unprofessional laughing very loud for such a small space. The service was very dull and a little rude."
Kristin B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",149,136,53,2.0,1/5/2016,"I've been here a couple times in the past and have always left feeling like I will never go back. Then something happens, like a friend is in town and wants to meet there. The last time was because we were looking for a place to watch the game and I had a coupon. We get there and sit at the bar and hand the bartender the coupon for a lunch entree. We get a beer and order a couple lunch entrees. A few minutes later I realize mine was supposed to come with a salad, but he didn't ask for that....so I try to ask him a few times, but breezes by in a  hurry. I'll cut the guy some slack because he's tending bar, but people were only ordering beer so not that much slack.  My friend's soup comes out very quickly....just without a spoon. He asks a couple times for one....a spoon finally arrives 30 minutes later. I ask the server if I get a salad with mine, he says ""not with this"". I think, well that menu is sure deceiving, but it's not like I really need it.  We eat and the food is decent. I had spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were good, but the sauce was overpowered by the spices. My friend had a sandwich which was good as well with his cold soup.  When the bill comes out, the coupon was applied (yay!), except he didn't charge us lunch prices, so it ended up costing just as much. (also $6 for the beers they have on tap is pretty ridiculous) I think this has finally been my last time at BJs."
Stevey W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,19,3,3.0,10/18/2016,"Came here on a Sunday night, not to busy. It took about 5 minutes to get seating for 2. We then were seated at the tables near the bar but also by the entrance to the kitchen. The manager on duty at the time was great. Our server seemed overwhelmed like she was tryna to make the service great but every encounter seemed rushed. Overall the food was great !"
Adrienne l.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,11,,2.0,5/9/2017,Ordered grilled chicken fettuccini it came without chicken. Service is great until your ready for the check and then no one comes around
Matt P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",103,10,2,5.0,2/1/2016,"Great that BJ's customer service responded so quickly!! was not expecting that. that just tells me that they are working nonstop to make there product better and that they want me to come back. My wife and I don't get the chance to go out that often, but we will go back to BJ's!!!"
