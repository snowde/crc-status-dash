Heather L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",173,183,672,3.0,12/7/2015,I am almost always underwhelmed when I visit BJs. I have to say their new menu is much improved from the behemoth that it used to be but generally speaking for the terrible service I almost always have and the quality of food I will almost always chose another place for lunch or dinner.
Steve C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",139,1,,1.0,12/13/2016,"Bad. no one brought silverware had to ask. Cold pizza soggy salad, ordered a appetizer it never came all they said was sorry , manager said they would of remade it, didn't want to wait any more"
Jay K.,"Contra Costa County, CA",2,70,,5.0,2/8/2017,"Overall great experience. Me and some buddys came here for the Super Bowl to watch the game and have some beers and grub. We were very well taken care of the entire time. Our waitress was very nice and attentive even though it seemed like every two seconds we were ordering more brews and food. She just made us feel really at home and we appreciated that. I really liked the level of involvement by the manager as well, he was serving tables, seating guests, running food out etc. BJ's may be a chain but i think that this branch does it right and next time i am in Santa Rosa i would definitley stop by again for a good meal. Also, the pizooki dessert is amazing!"
Sherry C.,"Uinta County, WY",32,60,57,5.0,6/23/2016,"Had an awesome dinner tonight!! Tried their Calamari as our starter then ordered Blackened Salmon Santa Fe Salad. Also want to thank our waiter ""Kamron"" for his excellent service and personable customer service--outstanding!!!!"
Rob G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,20,,3.0,3/4/2017,"BJ's can get fairly busy especially on weekends and during big sporting events.  The seating times can vary from 10 to 25 minutes.  In addition, the sound in this place gets pretty loud at times.  Not a place for a quiet meal.  As for the food itself, it's typical pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, salads and other popular appetizers and entrees (a good variety of food choices).  The freshness and taste is good, but nothing real special in terms of flavor.  Now as for the table service, the servers are nice when they take my order.  But to get their attention for assistance after ordering, that's another story.  Most of the time, I end up trying to get anyone's attention to get help.  The parking lot is big, but can get busy, too. Just have to be patient."
Mitzy B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",543,297,40,3.0,12/5/2014,"This review is purely for the bar area. I have been twice during happy hour and gotten a table quickly (although we may have just had good timing) and decent service. I enjoy BJ's on occasion, but seeing the lackluster reviews below, it seems like a spot that may just need to be visited during happy hour. I was a little disappointed when the happy hour spinach dip was enough for about 10 bites between two of us. I guess that's what happens when you're paying less for something though, just had hoped for more!"
John V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",39,57,2,2.0,11/27/2014,"Pretty much the only restaurant open late if you're not 21+. Service is good, great depending on who you get. I come here about once every few months and menu gets boring really quick, one thing that never gets old is the deep dish pepperoni, so thats what I recommend.   This restaurant is what I'd expect from any chain. Nothing particularly special but if you want to go on a date, have a family gathering, or a get together with friends and you're not extremely bent on trying the most delicious food ever this is the place. Food isn't really that good and it takes forever to come out and when it does come outs it's rarely cooked the way you asked for. Just come here for the Pizookie nothing else"
Amy H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/29/2016,"Twice my office has ordered curbside pickup and BOTH times they screwed up the order and we had to make a second trip to correct it. Food subpar and service was horrible as there is never an effort to make it right. We have to inconvenience ourselves again to correct the error. Not worth it. Get yourselves together, BJs."
Andrea R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,4,,1.0,7/28/2016,"GARBAGE. its like i went to a Denny's but paid more. AND don't ask for a ""Sierra Nevada"" because it will not be the ipa.. It will be a Sierra Nevada ""otra vez"" which is pretty much a corona. And don't order those mixed sodas... They were literally all syrup, we sent them back. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium rare, it was more like well done, no pink at all. Tasted a little burnt on the top. NEVER GOING BACK (well maybe just to sit outside and play Pokemon, but definitely not spending money there)."
Nathan G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",4,6,,4.0,7/11/2016,"Both working late hours, my girlfriend and I often stop by this location to get a late night bite to eat. The place is very clean and I have never once had a problem with the food or drinks. Service seems to be slow most of the time which can be upsetting, but the servers there are often very nice and interactive with their guests. Great food, great people, slowish service."
Andy S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/24/2016,"Really bad service!! After 20 mins of ordering my food and wait the waitress told me she was out of the drinks I've ordered, still no sign of the food I've ordered? Definitely ain't coming back to this place"
Ricci E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/21/2016,Make sure you're not starving when you get here. It takes forever till you get your food.
Sirena L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",96,144,166,4.0,11/1/2014,"Pretty good food, great handcrafted soda and wonderful service. Save room for a Pizookie (Warm cookie served with Ice Cream)."
Michelle H.,"Orangevale, CA",0,7,5,3.0,8/11/2016,"My husband and I frequented the BJ'S in Folsom, CA and just moved to Santa Rosa. Last night we tried the BJ'S in Codding Town and it was disappointing. Our appetizer was chips and guacamole, but it was served as a half, hard Avocado impossible to scoop. I sent it back but our server apologized saying the Avocados are not in season and there wasn't anything they could do beyond trying to mash it up better. She took 1/2 price off for us. For our entrees I ordered the fried Mahi Mahi tacos which were delicious and a go-to favorite of mine. My husband ordered a Flatbread Pizza that came out with raw, undercooked dough. Pretty gross. He let our server know, she apologized, and took 1/2 price off. I overhead apologies to surrounding tables as well. I'm not sure if it was just an off night for them but it looks like our go-to restaurant in Santa Rosa will not be BJ'S."
Jamie B.,"Healdsburg, CA",11,18,2,3.0,7/10/2016,Food is ok. It seems like a high end Denny's. You can tell the food isn't fresh. Service is ok most of the time. Drink options are awesome. A wide variety of beers. It's a place to go if you need food and don't want fast food but not if you want something to make your taste buds happy.
Gina H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,48,,1.0,5/5/2015,"This place needs to organize the front of the house too coordinate with the back of the house.  It is way too chaotic and disjointed out front, seems like enough staff, but does not function well. I have been here 4 times, why? I don't know.  But each time errors were made with my order and/or timing was way off with delivery of appropriate courses.   Won't be back.  Food not even worth it."
Kevin O.,"Santa Rosa, CA",132,4,1,1.0,11/21/2016,Been sitting here for an hour waiting for our food.  I might have to pillage food from people  that have already left.  Server complaining about the kitchen staff.  I'm going to eat the pictures on the wall soon.  Please help.  S.O.S.
Margo R.,"Cotati, CA",2,51,58,4.0,7/24/2014,"I like the mobile app. We ordered in advance for dine-in & got seated right away in the back room, & they brought out food quickly, then we didn't have to wait for our check we just used mobile pay. It saved us a lot of time tonight!  Watermelon mojito: summer is here.  Jeremiah Red beer: husband's favorite.  Deep dish pizza: guilty pleasure!"
Josh S.,"Occidental, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/17/2016,"Extremely slow service for mediocre chain food at an average price. Also ""gluten free"" items are not necessarily so as I found out the next morning after eating there. Two trips in one: first and last."
Marcos F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,5.0,8/2/2016,Me and my wife had excellent service from Rob on a busy weekend and the food was great.
