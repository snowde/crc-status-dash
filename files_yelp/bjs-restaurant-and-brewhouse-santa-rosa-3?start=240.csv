Steph P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",23,4,,1.0,9/3/2016,"I have had nothing, but terrible experiences at this location. The last time I went, after waiting 35 minutes for drinks alone, we were finally able to order our food. The appetizer took another 20 minutes to arrive, and it was cold. When I FINALLY got my meal, the bread was black because it was burned so bad. They tried to hide it by putting the burnt side on the bottom. I rarely complain about my food/send it back (like this was my first time ever), but I could not enjoy a black sandwich. When I asked the waitress to fix it, she replied ""well you're going to pay for it anyway, I can just bring you a new slice of bread."" Uhh... What? It won't even have the sauce on it. I waited over an hour for this sandwich that looked delicious on the menu, only to find it burnt to a crisp, then told I could get a new slice of bread. Woohoo! Exactly how I wanted to spend $15. I would have never gone back, but friends were getting together there so I decided to meet them. This time I thought would be better, as it has been almost 2 years since I was there last. Our waitress was nice, and checked on us regularly. I ordered a beer ($6.95), and it was warm by the time I got it. Who wants a warm beer after a long day? I sucked it up and drank it anyway because they were busy and I understand. The bill came. I left $12 for my $6.95 beer. Clearly tipping. We leave, and the waitress chased us out to the parking lot ""um excuse me! Did you not enjoy your service? I'll have fun explaining that to my kids!"" At first I felt bad. Like ""oh shoot did I do something wrong?"" But the fact that she chased us out to the parking lot to guilt trip us about not leaving her enough tip turned that around. I understand, I work for tips. You can have the greatest service and sometimes people don't tip you what you think you deserve, and you get this urge to tell them off. But you don't chase people to the parking lot to complain about the amount they tipped you. $5 on a $7 beer is plenty, especially when it's a warm beer! The only reason I gave them even one star is because 1. I had to, and 2. They had clean restrooms."
Kristina T.,"Windsor, CA",2,15,1,1.0,3/21/2016,I have been to this place 5 times. And all 5 times have been disappointing. Tonight was the icing on the cake. Was there with family. 2 kids 3 adults. Got there at 5:20pm and at 5:50pm the kids food finally arrived. The 3 adults never received our food. Our waitress came over and said our order was next up. 4 tables later and multiple plates coming out none of it was ours. My sister in law finally canceled our order. We were done. The kids were done. It took a while for the manager to come over. We explained and canceled our order again. Got the check paid for our drinks and left. After being there almost an hour an a half with no food is not ok. Thanks BJ's for your good beer and drinks but your service and food is meh!!
Tim R.,"Windsor, CA",0,5,1,1.0,9/26/2016,"Was in on Saturday night with my handicapped son we sat at the bar. Ordered a beer and a Shirley temple for my son, waited almost an hour for food while we noticed everyone that sat after us was being served. I asked the waitress to cancel our order. She came out with it but there were no fries or anything else. So we cancelled and left. The manager said he comped my drinks. Seth and Travis were rude as ever. After I left they charge my card. Not only the worst service but they are thieves and charged me anyway"
Ken H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",40,47,8,2.0,4/24/2015,"Damn, I wish I'd have read the reviews here before I suggested to my wife that we head here for a dinner date! Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted at the front desk and asked how many.  My wife responded ""Two..."" and continued to request a table, not a booth, but the girl at the desk turned her back on my wife and didn't listen to her.  She directed a seater to seat us in a booth.  We responded that we did not want a booth and had stated so but she chose to turn her back on us and ignore what my wife was saying.  Not starting off on a good note. Our waiter, Ryan, eventually showed up and asked if he could get us something to drink.  Why sure, diet cokes, please.  ""Is pepsi ok?""  Sure...  He produced the drinks and was off somewhere else. After a rather long wait to order, he returned.  I ordered two small appetizers for my wife and I and then we continued to order the rest of our meals.  After another 10 minutes or so, we were served our salads by someone else.  I figured our appetizers would be the first thing we'd get, but no.  I figured they would be next before our meal, but no.  We were served our meals by yet a third person who we told to cancel the appetizer orders since they were never served as appetizers -- before the meal.  ""Oh, sure."" About 4 or 5 minutes later yet another person comes out to our table with the appetizers we had canceled because we were already served our salads and meals.  No, we canceled those because they didn't get delivered before our meals.  ""Oh, well let me take care of that.""  Apparently this person found our waiter and told Ryan that we had canceled the appetizers since they weren't delivered before the salad and the meals we were already well into.  Ryan then comes over and announces ""I've taken care of the appetizers for you.""  Really, Ryan?  I think that if you'd taken care of the appetizers for us, they wouldn't have come out to us after we canceled them in the first place. The problem seems to be that there are too many people taking care of an individual table.  Our waiter didn't seem to serve any part of the meal, other people were.  Many other people.  There's too much of a disconnect between the customer and the waiter and what does or does not come out from the kitchen.  Very poor customer service in this respect.  The waiter should be doing that or at least overseeing that to make sure it goes smoothly. And finally, when it came time for us to pay the bill and leave, Ryan takes the payment and then doesn't come back for some time.  My wife is watching him BSing with another one of the waiters for quite some time.  Then Ryan comes back and lies to us saying ""I'm sorry I was late as I had a couple of other matters I was taking care of.""  Really, Ryan?  I guess ""a couple of other matters"" really translates into ""I didn't care enough about you to take care of you in a timely manner because I was BSing with my friends.""   The food that we received was pretty good and hot.  I had the Jambalaya and my wife had pasta and scampi.  I'd give the food 3 to 4 stars.  The service I'd give 1 star.  The prices are high enough that I expect service to match.  Between the greeter and the server, it's just a shame that the help didn't care enough about the customer to serve them correctly because we most likely will not be back again."
Melissa F.,"Rohnert Park, CA",155,21,38,1.0,3/29/2015,"AWFUL! Absolutely awful. This place is a joke and so is the manager who was beyond rude to me when I brought my concern of his terrible waitstaff to him. I wish I could give this place zero stars.  I went in today with my husband, 18 month old and I'll go ahead and mention that I'm 9 months pregnant. Today was Sunday 3/29/15 at 12 pm. We were seated within 5 minutes. The problem began once we were seated. We were NEVER helped. NEVER acknowledged. It was lunch time on Sunday but this place was not busy whatsoever. Our section had maybe 3 tables with people besides us. We also saw 3 servers working in this section (not training anyone - 3 individual servers). 10 minutes go by.. We're annoyed. 20 minutes go by and we're considering leaving. 30 minutes later and my daughter is getting tired of waiting, my husband is already half way through his lunch break and I'm STARVING and THIRSTY. No one even brought us water. 30 minutes is BEYOND ridiculous to be acknowledged.. Worst part.. We never were! We got up and left at the 30 minute mark. Since we did not have time at this point, I decided to call and speak to the manager from the car ride to fast food so my husband could eat something before going to work. This manager is a joke. He is the worst. He was extremely rude and obviously didn't give a crap about what I was saying. I was pleasant on the phone.. I'm NOT the person that calls yelling and being rude.  His response was basically uh huh.. Okay.. Well you can come back and I can make sure someone serves you. Really? That's it? First of all we don't have time to come back and wait for food. Especially food that I'm sure will be spit in at this point. Didn't offer some type of discount or a free meal. Basically told me there was no he was going to do and to deal with it and that it didn't bother him if we never ate there again..  Seriously?? Yes, I know.. Losing our business is not going to make a dent.. But you don't tell your customer that! How did this guy get hired. We always have chosen BJs (when we lived in San Rafael or we're out of town). But after today's experience I will NEVER return. He made a huge mistake talking to me like that. I fully plan on contacting his manager and corporate regarding his behavior. Completely inappropriate to talk to me or anyone like that.  If you have at least 2 hours to have lunch at a not busy restaurant and be treated like crap then this is the place for you.."
David T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,,4.0,7/17/2016,"Open late which is nice. Good selection of beer, and lots of seating for large groups. The stuffed mushroom appetizer is good but very small portions. The mushrooms are smaller in diameter than an adult size pinky for reference and with only six of them, it doesn't seem worth the $6.50. The avocado egg rolls and pizzookis are always great. Would recommend a try!"
Julia P.,"San Francisco, CA",105,517,370,3.0,5/9/2015,"Standard BJ's no different than the ones in San Diego, LA, Irvine, or other places in the Bay Area. Huge screens to watch sports. Geat beer selection. Somewhat loud but what do you expect? Good place to go for happy hour. Not a good place to take someone on a first date."
Scott S.,"Northern California, CA",0,7,1,4.0,1/1/2017,"Party of 4 came in on New Year's Day at 530 or so. We asked for a table to sit us and we're told 10-15 minute wait for a table. We decided to sit at a table near the bar instead. A waitress, Angela, serving that table was not only happy to have us but went out of her way to take care of us. Being new years day  and all, the restaurant was super busy and appeared that the restaurant was short staffed: empty tables, folks waiting in the front for a seat.. Anyway, without going into a long winded story about every minor detail, we ordered appetizers and eventually entrees..The entrees came but the entrees seriously lagged after the apps. In fact we saw adjacent tables come and go and what looked like our order be delivered to another table. I watched the recipients of that food and thought it odd that they seemed a bit surprised by the delivery of the food. Later I learned the Santa Rosa individuals without integrity ate our food with having the decency to admit the misdelivery. Minutes passed. Angela returned and apologized for the delay explaining the short staff issue and deviants that accepted unordered food.  The manager came out and talked to us about the issues this day. She was bound to make things right and she went out of her way to make it so. I have worked in the restaurant business myself and know the pressure of prime time. I fault BJ none for this experience . They did a great job handling the circumstances and I will come back just for the sake of their recognition of the situation and their culpability.. cheers BJ,S. JOB WELL DONE"
Maggie D.,"Oakland, CA",0,13,2,4.0,7/5/2016,"Ate at Bj's late last night. Our server was Jonathan C and he was very friendly and attentive. When he noticed our appetizer hadn't been brought to our table yet after quite a while, he came back and apologized that it hadn't been made yet. He gave us a nice discount on our bill because of the mistake made by the back of house. We really appreciated his accommodations and he made what could have been an annoying experience a great one instead."
Samantha F.,"Hayward, CA",15,3,1,4.0,7/4/2016,"Higher end Applebee's, totally worth the extra $ for the roomy environment & yummy food.  I would like to see one of two cheaper options."
Heidi D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",201,554,1076,2.0,9/7/2012,"I give it 2.5 stars, based on Yelp's review system.  It's definitely somewhere between ""i've experienced better"" and ""a-ok"" but not much.  It's a chain so right off the bat, I tend to not hold much expectation.  (Snobby of me, I know.)   What I like: lunch specials, peanut butter pizookie, going for a relaxed evening (translated to mean it's ok if everything takes forever), later evening desserts, watching the Giants game, space enough for a larger group. What I don't like: we sometimes get our appetizers or salads just moments before dinner arrives, and a couple times it came after.  Loud atmosphere so conversations can be a challenge, peanut butter pizookies being sold out at 6:30pm (?!?!?!), and service can be hit or miss.  (Smiling servers can only go so far when everything takes so long or it's obvious she wants to cash out before the shift change.) I like their southern fried chicken lunch special, mini bruschetta bites, spinach mushrooms, and parmesean crusted chicken dinner.    I've tried SEVERAL other items but nothing stands out as something I'd order again.     Anyhow, it's hoppin' and that's sometimes enough for me to keep going."
Becca C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,4.0,6/26/2016,"In the past, I would have given this location 2 stars...our food was usually wrong, not great, and took forever. But I have to say, the last 5 or 6 times have been good. Every now and then they get a change to the food wrong, but the wait has been much less, the food is coming faster, and tasting better. It's definitely gotten better in the last few months."
Ross G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,9,,1.0,3/30/2017,"I've never been a fan of BJ's; been there three times and all times the service was slow and the time to get the food was even slower.  Haven't been back for over a  year and decided to meet some friends for lunch, not by my choice mind you.  The first thing we walk into was hip-hop crappy music B-L-A-R-I-N-G in your face.  We were told the music system was getting worked on and that the volume would be adjusted soon.  We sit down and we literally couldn't hear ourselves talking and we complained to the waitress.  She was very apologetic and she deserves five stars, and said she would bring it to the manager's attention.  Shortly thereafter the volume goes down but only slightly.  It's still way too loud for a comfortable chat around the table.   A minute later the manager shows up, apologizes for the racket and informs us that the volume is as low as it can go.  WTF?!  I ask if they can at least put on some less abrasive music and he said that it was corporate policy to play the pre-programmed play list and he could not change it, nor turn the volume down any further.  If this is corporate policy, than SHAME on them.  How incredibly stupid.  To say the least, I will never go back to this horrific institution and will be sure my friends know about this experience.  Oh, and the food was good, not great, and certainly not worth having to subject my ears to their corporate-mandated play list.  Avoid this place."
K B.,"Calistoga, CA",0,29,,1.0,2/19/2017,"This was my fourth visit and last. We were seated 10 minutes after expected  time, which was odd considering the amount of open tables available. The place was pretty busy and it took our server about 15 minutes to get to us. Having plenty of time, we placed our entire order. Cocktails came in reasonable time, but the server forgot my child's drink. Artichoke dip appetizer came about 15 min later and not only looked like it was under the heat lamp for awhile but was burned so bad it smelled like charcoal smoke. We barely touched it. Our dinner came 30 min later, at this point it was over an hour after we sat down and all the tables around us had left and been reseated. I like their jambalia, it's spicy, but this time it was unediable. It's like the top of the paprika jar came off. Again the dish looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp. The server initially forgot my child's side of fruit too. My husband burger was good and cooked properly. I told the server my meal was disappointing and way over seasoned. We got a ""sorry"" but with all the problems I would have appreciated something taken off the bill. I used to be a restaurant manager and would have never allowed this experience to go without my attention."
Ron C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",7,235,143,3.0,5/7/2016,"One of the few SR spots open late. Needed some post workout late food on Cinco de mayo.  It was crazy in little Mexico so we rolled in here. First time. Nice place, busy but short wait. Massive freaking menu lime 20 pages of stuff.  Appetizers came quick, calamari which was a lot.  Instead of cocktail sauce we got marinari which was dumb, who wants that. The other dip tasted basically like ranch.  Ordered fried chicken, mashed potatoes and corn along with a deep dish ravioli thing. Came fast and hot. Not enough potatoes but otherwise fine.  I think this place is a chain but it alright. Open late, decent service, fair prices."
George B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,4,1.0,1/24/2015,"I wish we had read the reviews before we stopped to eat here.  We had a group of 8 and it took us 30 mins to order and 45 mins to get our food!  Growing up in the the Napa Valley, I am accustomed to great food being prepared when ordered but this was greasy, over priced and underwhelming. We had to constantly flag people down to get our drinks refilled, items we were missing. If it was lunch time rush I could of understood the wait but the place was half full on a Sunday afternoon.  It's a great looking place and the big screens and music give the place a great vibe. But the service and food are what kills this review. There are a ton of better places to eat in the area."
Mackenzie M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",176,67,6,2.0,7/6/2014,"The Mozzarella sticks were delicious, but they gave us barely enough marinara sauce. The burger I had was ok. Not great, not bad. They got my order wrong (Put Bacon on my burger, and no onions). Not a place I'm rushing back to.  I will say that they have many drink options."
Arlene R.,"Novato, CA",0,25,6,2.0,3/1/2016,"Just ok, could be better!  Should listen to  my cut feeling...but thought I'd give it a try...mistake!"
Steve Y.,"Sonoma, CA",38,7,2,1.0,8/4/2016,"A waste of time. Literally!  My wife and hired a babysitter and drove up to have dinner. Got there around 5:45pm.  The place was not busy. Maybe 30% full. Asked for a table for 2. There was plenty of empty tables but we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. After we sat down we ordered our beverages and appetizers which came pretty promptly.  Our waiter took our dinner order. A burger and a chicken salad. Pretty easy right?? Apparently not! We waited and waited. About 35 minutes after we ordered and after everyone who arrived later than we did were served and eating and or finishing their meals, the manager approached us and apologized for the delay and told us our meal would be out in about 4 minutes. That they were still waiting on the chicken to reach temperature.  About another 20 minutes later our waiter came to say our meal was on its way out. 15 minutes later my wife and I discussed leaving. We walked out at 7:15. Our meal never came. Date night ruined. Not only did it cost us our time, it cost us for the baby sitter. We drive over and grabbed a burger at 5 guys. We were in and out in 15 minutes tops!!  Never going back to BJ's again. This was our second time there in 6 months , and the first time the service was slow, but we didn't think it was possible to be any worse. We were dead wrong.  There is no good excuse for such a lousy experience . Not as much as an apology.  Outrageous!"
Rebecca C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,9,1,2.0,10/21/2016,"Waitress was great but our order took 45 to an hour to come out and the restaurant didn't really seem that busy (no big parties ahead of us or anything). I ordered the seared ahi salad which I've had before at a different BJ's and enjoyed. The salad came out in a warm bowl (clearly had been sitting under the food warmers) so the lettuce was a wilted. It was completely lacking dressing and missing half of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. No dressing. No pickled cucumbers. No avocado. No tomato. So I got warm dry lettuce, ahi, and some crispy wonton for $15.25. I emailed them and heard nothing back. Completely disappointing meal. I probably won't go back for a while."
