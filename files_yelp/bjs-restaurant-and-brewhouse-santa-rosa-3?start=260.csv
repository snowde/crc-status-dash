Tiffanie H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",266,142,491,1.0,2/4/2015,"I have been here twice and I knew better than going again.  I had wanted to get some breakfast on a Sunday with my son and everywhere else was crowded.  There was a server being trained who was lovely, I wish I would have gotten her name. However, the trainer let us sit at our table for over 8 minutes before we were even greeted.  They were not busy at all! I would have to say that if you want mediocre food and bad service then you should go.  The service is the worst part and has been each time I have been here!"
Janelle H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",29,12,1,3.0,4/2/2016,"I used to love BJ's, even though it is a chain. Their burgers and salads were always good, and they have a nice beer selection. The last two times I have gone have been very disappointing. The salad was soggy and the meat on the salad was just plain gross. The second time I had a burger so over cooked, it was similar to eating my shoe. So I think there are better options around. I might go there for a beer, but not to attempt to eat their food any longer."
Nelson T.,"Miami, FL",42,66,172,4.0,5/7/2015,Well it's easy to like this BJS brewery the place always has good beer... My favorite is the piranha beer and the wings are alway good fast service and friendly atmosphere the place is always clean and including the restrooms. At the bar the have large TVs and a place to plug up your phones
Amber A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,23,19,1.0,1/17/2015,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I would never pay a dime to that business! We had a group of 8 people had a total of 4 servers in the time we were there. They brought us water within 2  Minutes took them 20 minutes to make our drinks we had to get up ask for our bill and divide it ourselves after asking her to split it. We talked to the manager, that was a waste of time, he had nothing to say but tried justifying his employees. Don't waste ur money go downtown"
Alayna F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2016,If there was a 0 star option I would choose it! We waited longer than an hour for our food. And when we got our food it was so dry and terrible that I swallowed my tonsils. Oh also my butt went from Kim k to Taylor swift in the matter of an hour and a half. #wastemytime2016
Mike F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",8,24,37,1.0,8/10/2016,"Had a bad experience the first time.  Gave them 2 more opportunities. Same experience with slow service, order mistakes, and low quality food.  Lots of places to go in Santa Rosa, would not recommend eating here."
Elizabeth H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,3,1.0,10/13/2016,"Would give it 0 stars if that was possible! WORST service ever! Waited almost 2 hours for my food!No sauce on the salmon, not a complicated order...somehow the chef managed to mess it up 4 times & drop it 1 time. Will NEVER go back there again!"
Holland L.,"Hidden Valley Lake, CA",13,9,1,2.0,5/18/2015,"Food was alright, nothing particularly special. My brothers fish was greasy and overcooked, the sauce that came with it tastes like ""puréed urinal cakes"".  His gf's food was raw and not to order, well no pink, coleslaw salad had no dressing and the topping asked for on the side were absent. Asst. manager was cordial and polite but for the prices and ambience I would recommend going elsewhere."
Pamela S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,17,,1.0,7/22/2016,Keep on going back in hopes it was a fluke that it was a crappy meal and horrible slow incompetent service. But no the same experience every time. I'm done.
Jennifer G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,8,,1.0,4/20/2015,Curbside service SUCKS!!!! Here I am with all 3 kids waiting in my car 23 minutes-  And did I say that I ordered on a silly app to have my food ready & waiting..... NEVER AGAIN- JOKE Actually I tried calling in my order a few months ago & was on hold 12 minutes before I drove off-
Christine N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/19/2016,So my husband and I have been coming here for over a year. The service has been going downhill over time. Tonight we ordered an appetizer and drinks and that was messed up right away. We ordered a salad and a main dish and waited 45 minutes before our server came over to apologize. They told us three more minutes and we still waited. After another ten we decided to leave. Sadly this place is not what it should be. The service is awful. And the food isn't anything special. See us BJ'S. We will be spending our neighborhood money elsewhere.
Susan R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,15,2,3.0,4/13/2016,"BJ's has a huge and varied menu.  The food is decent, but not what I'd call exceptional.  The restaurant is very convenient for Coddington shopping mall customers.  Noise level inside can be quite loud at times.  Ample seating is available.  Prices are reasonable. I would have given a 4-star rating except for several instances in which the staff's performances were less than stellar.  During one visit around 11:00 AM, I came in and requested seating on the patio.  There were very few patrons, plenty of empty tables, yet 10 minutes later I was still waiting to be seated.  Another time, when I was waiting for my check, I caught the eye of my waiter and motioned him to come over, but he diverted to another table, then disappeared.  I finally had to go to the front greeting area and ask for my check."
Melissa R.,"Windsor, CA",260,101,262,4.0,9/28/2015,"Stopped here for their meal for 2 for $25. The food was good and the service was great. Our meal special included a soup or salad for each person, a medium pizza and a deep dish ice cream cookie thing. Lol. It was all very good. We order a deep dish combination pizza. Everything was very good on the pizza and the crust was light and soft. My little one ordered the kids spaghetti and meatballs. Her plate was enormous! It also came with a side in which she ordered skinny fries and was also served with a crunchy cheesy garlic bread/crostini. It was way too much for her but I'm not complaint because she got to take it home and have it for dinner. She was in love with her spaghetti. The skinny fries were very good too. The strawberry lemonade is so delicious. It tastes like its homemade and has crushed strawberries in it. It's very refreshing. The wild berry mojito was very tasty too. Our server Kim was very nice and attentive. She's always such an amazing server and makes you want to keep coming back. Thank you for the great service."
David W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",22,12,7,4.0,12/11/2015,"The food is always great quality and the service is fast and friendly.  I especially like the baked potatoes.  They're huge!  I also liked the deep dish pizza.  The place is noisy but not overwhelmingly so. The place is also pricy.  I ordered a side salad and It was very small for the price.  Not worth it.  I don't really enjoy it for dinner, however, I would come back just for the dessert.  Their Pazookie is fantastic and if you order the mini Pazookies you can get 3 different flavors to share."
Diane V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",19,111,201,5.0,11/15/2014,"I believe all the negative reviews written here are swimmers from the shallow end of the gene pool... This place is GREAT! Wonderful service (so what if you have to wait a few minutes, what else do you have to do? If your in that big of a hurry, go through a drive through). Food is excellent & if for ANY reason your dissatisfied they will be more than happy to ""fix it"" for you, but you can't sit on your computer & complain after the fact.  Super bar tending.  Have always gotten a GOOD drink. The people who work here are friendly! Hard working! Pleasant! Serve to please! And for those who think the music is to loud, go to the front desk & NICELY ask that it be turned down, don't forget to say ""please""... it has worked for me. I go here often & take as many people with me as I can."
Michelle H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,19,6,2.0,9/10/2014,"I was very disappointed in the management. When I brought to his attention that we  *waited 40 min after ordering to get our meal  *My food was under cooked *we were missing food we ordered  *food was cold by the time we got our condiments *I was charged for an entree I did not order or receive And I didn't even get an apology let alone an adjustment on my ticket, or a promise of a free drink or appetizer if I would give their established another opportunity."
Sonny P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",58,1,,1.0,8/24/2016,Waited over 45 minutes for take out order. Waitress messed up 1st time and brought out the food thinking i was gona eat here. Then it took another half hour.
David B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/7/2016,"Oh my God I've eaten here eight times total in 6 months after reading the reviews I am thoroughly confused are we talking about the same BJ's I've never had a problem with burnt food slow service or unfriendly Hostess, waiter/waitress ? Every time we have eaten here, me and my girlfriend  or family, the food has been exceptional , big portions , good portions , cooked to order and everybody's had a good attitude ! Maybe one drawback is the price , a tad bit higher then compared places but it's close, convenient, and good atmosphere... I guess the people that have given this bad reviews should stay home and continue to be Butlers and Maids who serve them at their house/home"
Cat R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,38,2,1.0,1/3/2016,"If you want to dine here make sure you have lots of time because the service is SLOW! Servers disappear when you need water refilled or ketchup (who doesn't automatically put down ketchup with fries?)   On my last visit I ordered kale and brussel sprouts salad. There was no kale. There were no brussels sprouts. It was an iceberg salad. I told my waiter he brought the wrong salad. He argued with me that it indeed it was kale. He literally picked up a piece of iceberg lettuce from my plate to show me. Let me tell you, I am vegetarian and I know what veggies are. I asked for a new salad. He brought me one 15 minutes later with a lump of brussel sprouts on top of some. . . iceberg! But since my children were long done with their meals I denied the new salad and asked for it to be taken off my bill. I guess that pissed him off because the manager presented me with the check, but no apology."
Gina S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Had some christmas money to spend on some good food with my boyfriend. We ordered the avocado eggrolls to start, they totally skimped us on the dipping sauce & we had to ask for more. They weren't impressive, Tex Wasabi has the best avocado eggrolls by far. Honey sriracha brussels sprouts were good. I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos, they were served to me cold. Barely even room temperature. My boyfriend ordered a small Great White pizza. When they served it to him, they gave him a medium & told us they were out of ""small"" pizzas. They charged us for the small but we were given the impression that these pizzas are frozen/pre-made. Out of ""small"" pizzas? Odd. Can't go wrong with the pizookie? You can, the salted caramel was pretty burnt. Out of the couple times I've been here, I've never really had a good experience. Probably wont be coming back."
