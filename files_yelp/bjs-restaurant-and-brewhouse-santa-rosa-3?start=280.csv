Kassi J.,"Windsor, CA",0,11,3,2.0,3/29/2017,Had one of the WORST experiences I have ever had here last night. So we go for my brothers birthday dinner and the minute we walk in we were greeted or anything it was like 4 girls sitting gossiping. At this point was frustrated. Well then we get seated and servers walk by and by and next thing I know 25 minutes go by without anyone stopping and asking us if we want something to drink or anything. At this point I get up and go to the hostess and asked to be seated somewhere else where there was a server (since the other girl sat us in this section). Once we get seated we had a great server for the rest of the night. Was disappointed that they took away the options of fries and also the ones my brother and I had were both semi cold. They kept forgetting about our drinks that they asked us if we wanted refilled and also took two different people to get boxes. It was slow so I was frustrated why there was so many issues. I won't be back for a while I think. Only reason for 2 stars is for the waiters personality.
Jessica P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,6,2,2.0,2/9/2016,"Having worked in the restaurant business,  I've made it a habit to only review restaurants that I've had positive experiences at. Tonight's experience however has really been an awful one. We go to BJ's expecting the service to be slow, always,  and that's fine. We arrived at 8pm and our food wasn't out until about 9:15, which is way slower than usual (and not many customers). I am always excited about their steak,  potatoes,  and veggies. I cannot eat raw meat, so I always order the steak well done (I know it's frowned upon in the steak eater world,  but it tastes amazing to me). My steak was bloody beyond what I could tolerate. I hate complaining and considered eating everything else and taking the steak to go and cooking it at home to eat later. My boyfriend somehow convinced me to take it back to the kitchen,  which I was prepared to do, but almost 10 minutes pass and our waitress is nowhere to be found. We decide to switch meats,  since he doesn't mind raw meat. I have work early in the morning,  I cannot wait another hour for meat. I wish the steak was my only complaint.  The ""steamed"" veggies still had a significant crunch (could not stab with a fork) and mashed potatoes were cold (I did not wait 10 minutes to eat these. They came to me cold). I give it  2 stars, because the Pizookies were tasty and our waitress was nice when she was around."
Lucius Q.,"Windsor, CA",0,23,5,5.0,2/9/2016,First off our server Andrea did fantastic. She's the real MVP. the food was tasteful and quite quick. I left wanting for nothing else. I was quite satisfied with the experience. Plus there are many options from drinks to appetizers.
Rew C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1159,546,746,3.0,3/7/2013,"Let me start with -  for a chain restaurant, I like this place. The staff is very friendly and I was hoping to mention their names but have now forgotten. They pour a good cocktails and if you can't find something on their vast menu - then you're in trouble.  Also - they have the calorie count on their dishes which is super appreciated. Problem is their ""Veggie Burger"" is ...........wait for it....................1200 CALORIES...........WTH - I mean What The Heck (family friendly). That is outrageous, of the the great female bartenders told me it's good - covered in butter is why it's good. Ugh - that's annoying.  Salads are very good - and if you don't mind the calories, burgers, fries, standard bar food is above average in my opinion. But Don't be on a Diet here. There aren't enough points on the Weight Watchers system to cover this food.  Oh yeah - that veggie burger is all you're allowed to eat today at  112 points. ;o)"
Joe M.,"Windsor, CA",2,13,4,5.0,3/8/2015,This place has a great atmosphere big TV's awesome food and a friendly staff. I'd like to give a special thanks to Jessica at the bar she might be the best at her job ever. I've eaten here a lot and every time she's behind the bar my service is impeccable.  Thanks Joey
Katharine B.,"Petaluma, CA",101,53,82,3.0,1/14/2015,"Pretty average bordering on the decline. My guy and I wanted to catch a drink and small app before heading home. He was upset because after waiting 10 minutes we are led to a nearly empty room to our seats to which he states ""we had to wait to be seated in an empty room?""  I shrugged and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. The food was alright, nothing exceptional and our waitress was nice but didn't seem too knowledgable about how to be a server as we kept trying to get her attention for the check. In addition a faux pas resulting in a marinara cup to fall and splatter on my boyfriends pants with no real notice of where it spilled from her didn't help. I wouldn't have any desire to go back here again. Not worth the $40 spent."
Andrea M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,38,,2.0,2/12/2016,"Went here for a late lunch. It wasn't busy at all, we were seated right away. Our server wasn't the best, I'm taking that he's new because he passed by our table many times but didn't care to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything. The appetizers came out fairly quick, however it tasted like it was fried in really old oil( we ordered caliemari). Our food took forver to come, we ordered two burgers. Few couples who had come in some time after us got their food way before us. When our server gave us our check he almost walked right passed us without picking it back up. The only good thing about my meal was the fries, they were amazing."
Sara V.,"Norwalk, CA",3,2,1,5.0,1/31/2014,I'm glad that I base my visit to BJs solely on the fact that I really like the food otherwise I think with our visit to Santa Rosa we could have picked something that was unique to the city.I'm extremely please with the service we received this visit. Being from southern California you really learn to respect what some servers have to go through with rude people..  I think I received the best service that I have ever received. The server was able to keep up with my  sarcasm. Wish I remembered his name but he had the most interesting beard.  Food was awesome as usual the service was great and the location reminded me of home.
Susanne A.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/4/2016,"My daughter was with a group of 7 students from Sonoma State last night at BJ's. Out of the 7 students; 4 of them got sick from the food.  The food that was ordered was Salmon, BBQ Burger; Steak & Chicken Alfredo.  4 of them got diarrhea, my daughter got the worst of it.  She's been up all night with diarrhea, vomiting, and bad cramps.  My daughter said when she received her steak, it was rare, she ordered Medium Well.  The waitress took my daughter's order back to the kitchen, and brought another order, but my daughter didn't know if it was a new steak or the same steak, but she said the steak wasn't any better, still looked rare. She didn't eat much of it. The waitress didn't charge her for the dinner, but the order should've been done correctly when they brought back the 2nd order.  Will they go back there, absolutely NOT!!"
Kevin J.,"San Francisco, CA",11,27,486,4.0,2/25/2015,"One of my favorites in Santa Rosa, yes its corporate, yes its cheese cake factoryish, but they have great happy hours (10pm-12am everyday, and any time there's an NFL game on). Great food, fun ambiance- you know that place that you sit there at the bar and you could imagine yourself anywhere? I like to pretend I'm in Vegas while I sit there eating my pot stickers with estancia cab."
Don S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,13,,5.0,6/13/2014,"Let me preface this by saying that we prefer to dine in at local small businesses, at least in part due to better customer service. But I felt compelled to write this review after eating at BJ's last night because they literally blew my expectations away.  We'd visited the Santa Rosa location a few times previously, and had mostly positive experiences. But last night started off poorly, as our server told us that my wife's pizza took a detour from the oven to the floor on the way to our table. Cooper apologized and offered us a cup of chowder on the house, which we reluctantly accepted. He then said he'd see about comping us the pizza, which we said was unnecessary - accidents happen, right? Well, shortly afterwards the manager came over to apologize about the pizza which she said would be free of charge, and to let us know if she could do anything else. And when a third person who brought over the newly created pizza got to our table, he apologized for the inconvenience. If you're counting at home, that's three apologies from three different people and a free pizza for an accident that we didn't think was a big deal. Wow.  Cooper then told us about how to save even more money by installing the BJ's app on our phones and paying for our meals on it, and enthusiastically helped us through the process. As we were about to leave I thanked him again and told him that they didn't have to do all that they did for us regarding the pizza, and he genuinely remarked that it was his pleasure to work for such a positive place that encourages their employees to think about their guests first.  Admittedly, this was a somewhat unusual experience, and your results may vary. But I don't think I've ever been treated better at a restaurant, so I just wanted to give out some kudos. Oh, and the food was pretty good, too!"
Lori C.,"Healdsburg, CA",2,13,,1.0,6/3/2015,"This is the third time we've tried this BJs, and this will be the last. The last two times proved the food was so-so but it's close to our place, so we gave it another shot. We were seated after a few minutes, then we waited another 20... and then left. No one acknowledged us, no drinks, not even a ""hello, I'll be with you."" We were not the only table ignored like this.  Badly run, mediocre food, poorly staffed.... I can only imagine they have business because they're riding on the coattails of other, better managed BJs."
Rick T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/26/2016,Great beer but service not so fast  Had to sit for over an hour to get served.  Actually sitting here waiting for food and getting more disappointed
Shauna f.,"San Francisco, CA",6,116,576,4.0,8/24/2013,Somewhat of an upscale chain restaurant .  My favoite are the burgers.  Meaty and big.  Servers are knowlegable on menu items.  Good value for the price.
Cheri B.,"Windsor, CA",51,14,5,3.0,1/20/2016,"The reviews made this place sound horrible. My friend and I went there Friday night. I had a side salad and calamari, Candi had the salmon. Both dishes were OK. Her wine was overpriced but the margarita, I had, was good and the price was no better or worse then any other sports bar. If you're looking for a quiet place, do NOT go to a sports bar! BJ's is no different, very loud with everyone trying to talk over the TV's AND each other. I think the worst part of the evening? Oh myyy, the waiter was, borderline, intrusive, he literally stopped by the table 15 times. (I counted).  LOL..  Anyway, I'm sure he meant well, or maybe he liked Candi, but, honestly, let people enjoy their meal. I would recommend and I will go again, so in the end, that's all that really matters."
Robin S.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,6,,4.0,2/18/2016,This place does great burgers and cheap beers on  a Thursday (3.50 a pint I think). Can't complain about the service.
Adriana R.,"Windsor, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/17/2016,I've always had amazing experiences at this BJ's but today had by far been the worse. We called ahead to make a reservation for 8:00 pm for a party of 10. We got there at 7:45 checked for a table and they said it would be ready by 8:15. An hour later we still weren't seated. There was also another party of about 9 who had NOT made a reservation and were seated before us. Not to mention the hostess (short blonde girl) was really rude and was the one who gave us misleading information. If I could I would rate you guys ZERO stars. Terrible experience never coming back.
Gary A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",110,234,46,4.0,11/19/2012,"Food is good but not great as are the beers.  It is clean and well light.  Service is consistent. My wife and I were there last weekend.  They made a few errors.  Really, nothing terrible -- just some human errors and it was really busy.  I was not even going to complain.  The manager came over to our table and comped our bill. Three stars for food. Four stars for beer and service. Five stars for making good on small errors."
Kandis N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,17,2,1.0,11/20/2014,"It was my first time going here.   The place was spacious and the pizookie or whatever it's called is good and those are the only good things I can say about this place.    As for everything else.... 1- our 1st waiter was a nice enough guy but never even asked me if I wanted a drink when we got to the table (we came a little while after others) 2- he seemed to stay away from our table more than a server should 3- he didn't seem to really know his menu 4- reached past our faces several times without saying a word 5- brought a horribly plated dish to the table with hardly any food when it was simply ordered with no pilaf rice. (Never asked/ offered a sub)  When he was called on the dish appearance he took it back, took 10 min to come back with an explanation that they were out of something (later to find they don't even offer that something anymore) 6- brought their nasty special brew beer for the mistake, didn't ask the youngsters at the table for ID, then asked if more of us wanted to try it (this was before we tasted it) , we said yes and he never brought it. 7- when asked for boxes he never came back to the table!  Second waiter 1- creeped by the table looked like a weirdo,  circled back on the other side of the aisle and then came leaned his belly over the edge of the table and asked if everything was ok 2- when asked what happened to the other waiter he states that he ""had to leave"". We thought he got fired or something! He says no he was just sent home due to labor because the management wants to watch labor costs so he will be our new server.  3- he also reaches in front of our faces without a word, then gets rude when asked why he keeps doing that without saying ""excuse me"". 4- when he brought the boxes ,finally, he waits until we all put our food in the containers and stands there grabbing plates until the table is mostly empty.   5- Offers desert by stating ""since you're boxing your food you guys probably don't want a desert...""  6- we order a pizookie after what seemed like we had to beg him to tell us what flavors they had.  I know this sounds like a long evening at this place and it was, trust me.  After all this we wanted to speak to the manager of course.  1- he listened, said they both were NOT new servers,  apologized half heartedly,  then offers to fix the bill taking the ruined dish off.  2- had an attitude about the whole thing 3- could be seen (not far away) speaking harshly to the 1st server,  then barely saying anything to the 2nd. The ""fixed"" bill still came to almost $100 even though we ordered no alcohol,  expensive plates, and mostly all drank water.  By far the WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant.   It wasn't all that clean either.   They moved tables to accommodate a large party and food was under all the tables they moved.  We will never be going back to say the least."
Leia R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",17,3,1,2.0,2/8/2016,I'm disappointed in the customer service. We call to make a reservation which we have more than 7 people and we are then told you don't make same day reservations. I'm making it 8 hours in advance then tell me to use the app which isn't really a reservation. So I can have a party of 8 waiting for an hour. No thanks. I will start taking my business elsewhere. Btw- we were choosing to celebrate my birthday at your restaurant. I will not be recommending your restaurant in the future
