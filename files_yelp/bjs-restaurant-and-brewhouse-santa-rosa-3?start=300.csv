J L.,"Modesto, CA",1,41,9,4.0,12/9/2014,"Little noisy but food was good, no wait at 630 at nite that was a good thing.  The waitress was great, took our order of 5 people and nailed it. It was exactly as ordered. Parking was a bugger but not a deal breaker"
elizabeth a.,"Palo Alto, CA",13,18,96,4.0,2/7/2016,Personal quick service. Sign up for the rewards program.Great selection of yummy and thirst quenching options.
Brittany M.,"San Diego, CA",2,20,,1.0,8/6/2016,"Came in today when the restaurant was slow figuring it wouldn't be a long process and ordered my meal. 30min later im wondering why I haven't gotten our meals and where our server went, instead the manager comes up and acknowledges the long wait time and just says it's coming soon. No discount or nothing offered to make up for the Long wait time and no reason was explained either. I was not impressed with my visit and my friend ended up late to work due to it. we ended up paying on the mobile app and leaving asap. Come here when you have all day to spend"
Richard M.,"Saint Helena, CA",37,15,30,2.0,12/1/2014,We we're disappointed to say the least. The service was good but the food was a real let down from the last time we came. I ordered the bread bowl broccoli chedder soup and it came with less then a spoonful deep of soup in it and my girlfriend ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and it was overcooked to the point the noodles were crunchy. The Jeremiah Red Irish Style Ale was good though!
Melissa H.,"Rohnert Park, CA",37,94,8,2.0,8/7/2012,"I have been to BJ's a few times now, the first time I went was when they had just opened. The service was terrible but I let it slide because I knew they were still getting into their rythym and they were so new.  After that first time I was so dissapointed with the service and the food as just average that I wanted to write a bad review but I opted to try a few more times. I've gone 3 times now. I'll start with what I don't like: The prices seem very overpriced for many things. I wasn't really wowed with anything that I can say was really worth the price.  Once I went with my coworkers to ""happy hour"" which is very expensive. It's only $1 off drinks (mind you, these drinks are like $10 or $11 dollars) and $2 off appetizers (anywhere from $9-$15) wow what a not so happy hour priced happy hour! We ended up paying $33 a person for 2 drinks each and a couple appetizers that we shared. We might as well have gotten dinner instead!!  I kept on hearing things about how awesome the avocado egg rolls are. We ordered them. All they tasted like was warm avocado in a deep fried egg roll crust with a sweet sauce to dip them in. In the picture these look like they aren't just pure avocado deep fried.  Things I did like: The lunch menu has very well priced lunches and they are pretty good. I had this chicken with mashed potatoes and a gravy served in corn. Only $6  The calamari was tasty and so was the dipping sauce it comes with. But then again, how do you go wrong with calamari?  The restaurant is large, spacious, and everything looks very nice (I'd hope so, since it's new) The Pizookies are tasty, but it's not an out of this world, best dessert I have ever tasted experience like it is made out to be. All in all, I won't avoid the place but if it's between BJ's and Russian River brewery or 3rd street ale works, I'll choose for either one of these in a heartbeat.  I truly feel like BJ's is simply Applebee's on steroids with a much much larger and diverse menu and way more expensive."
Happy H.,"Cotati, CA",0,14,3,2.0,1/3/2016,"Walked in in a rainy day, the hostess' had about 4 staff there, but not even one of them could be bothered to make eye contact or greet their customers.  Despite that, I waited and got a seat.  the waitress was actually super nice and friendly but yet it felt very corporate; nothing like a smaller restaurant, but I guess that is part of the ""appeal"". Regarding the meal, I ordered cherry glazed salmon - do not order this unless you like your salmon to taste like kids cough syrup. Hands down most disgusting salmon of my life. I ate one bite and left the rest on my plate. Waitress didn't even take it off the bill. My husband had bison burger and it was just eh- not good, not bad. Our child had the smiley fries, and these are horrible. Everything else was just mediocre. I won't be going back."
Marina T.,"Cotati, CA",285,244,701,4.0,8/1/2012,Service has gotten much better at this location!
Brad L.,"Vallejo, CA",58,118,4,1.0,4/14/2014,"I have eaten at BJ's in the past.  I never thought they were amazing but they were one of the better chains.  When I was eating with large groups of people or in a work setting BJ's could usually cater well enough to the group to work.  My last trip to BJ's was a terrible dining experience in every way and I will not be adding them to my list of places that I refuse to eat. I went for a work birthday lunch with a group of 6 people total.  We were seated promptly because the place was half empty.  It took 15 minutes for our waitress to arrive the first time and get our drink order.  20 minutes later she returned with our drinks and to take our lunch order.  At this point two people decided not to eat because that had appointments in the afternoon and could not wait any longer.  We watched as two other tables got up and walked out without having received any food. I ordered a burger (because how bad can a burger be?).  About 20 minutes after we ordered the first batch of food came.  So now half of the group watched as the other half of the group ate.  No one wanted to risk waiting because we had no idea how long everything would take.  10 minutes later the rest of the food came with my burger.   The burger was burnt, missing half of the toppings, and the toppings it did have were wilted lettuce and burnt bacon.  I told the waitress to take it back and not bother to bring another one because I did not want to wait and did not want to bother with what ever they sent next.  Three minutes later she returns with a new burger.  This burger was obviously meant for someone else but they just scrapped off the other topping and try to recreate my burger.  It still had bits of cheese and chili sticking too it.  The process of being mangled by the kitchen staff doing who knows what had left it looking like wet cat food.  Overall it was one of the most unappetizing looking things I have ever been served in a restaurant.  I flagged the waitress down and sent it back again. The manger came over and made some halfhearted attempt to apologize.  She would be better serviced in the kitchen monitoring the quality of the food that was coming out.  Nothing that was served was great and much of it was wrong and/or poorly prepared.  Based on our conversation with her we were not the first table to complain that day."
Al J.,"San Jose, CA",14,45,3,1.0,5/23/2015,"This place is a disaster. The front desk staff let 5 families that came after us, get seated before us. I finally spoke up and we were seated. Then it took 15-20 minutes for someone to come take our order, and 30 min for our food to come out. They only brought half the order and 10-15 minutes later the rest of the food came. My shrimp pasta was inedible. Nobody came to check on us or get us refills on our drinks, we had to flag someone down to get us the tab, and waited 20 minutes for them to charge my card. I wanted to just get up and leave since we didn't even eat our food. The staff and food are both equally terrible and the management is clueless. Half the people here had an upset and agitated look on their face but nobody seemed to care. Won't come back."
Jenn S.,"Sebastopol, CA",1,20,3,1.0,5/2/2015,"This place is horrible!! We've tried several times and each time is a bigger disappointment! I ordered pasta with shrimp that was supposed to have broccoli-  apparently they ran out but didn't tell me!  Basically I got noodles with a little olive oil and some sun dried tomatoes thrown in. The shrimp were so overlooked you couldn't chew them.  Never again will we eat here! I cannot believe this place stays in business. Also, our waitress never once asked me if I'd like a refill on my water that sat empty the entire time we were seated at our table!"
Caine H.,"Alameda, CA",86,61,130,4.0,9/10/2014,I'm a big fan of BJ's PM Porter dark ale.  The food is pretty good. Typical chain restaurant style.  Good portions. Tasty. Can't complain.
Karen L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",38,186,1236,2.0,6/14/2013,Let me begin by saying I am not a fan of chain restaurants.  So to be fair this place lived up to the expectations... it was OK for it's intended purpose. I think it is a great place to sit and enjoy a cold beer or cocktail as they have a full bar and craft their own beers.  It is also nice to have a place to grab a quick bit after 9pm as this is a rare commodity in Sonoma County.   The service is hit or miss; the food is as well.  I prefer the BJ's in San Rafael but in a pinch would visit this location.
Alexa M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,18,5,1.0,6/4/2015,I ate here for my sisters rehearsal dinner. The food was terrible. Burger Kings food tastes better than there food. Don't eat here you will regret it and it will cost you a lot of money. I would give them no stars if I could. I regret eating there food.
Sandra C.,"Burlingame, CA",0,17,,1.0,6/2/2015,"Just... Don't waste your time here. Food is okay (as up to par with any other bjs location) Service is absolutely terrible. If you're in coddingtown mall, I'd recommend trying out one of the other new restaurants next door :)"
Kevin J.,"San Francisco, CA",2508,873,340,2.0,5/21/2012,"BJ's isn't a bad spot for another Cheesecake factory chain.  Unfortunately this place just opened and even though hiccups are expected I would hope seasoned professionals would be hired... that wasn't the case.   Once our table of 7 was seated comfortably and orders placed we waited... and waited... and waited until eventually service kind of stopped for us.  The servers(yes multiple) had failed to check up on us knowing that they had failed at providing excellent customer service. The food eventually came - about 45 mins after orders were placed and we all ate happily.  That is, except me. I ordered a Thai mango chicken salad and the dressing was forgotten.  After waiting another 15 minutes or so I was able to reach someone to get me some dressing.  After about 20mins once the food was consumed my stomach didn't feel all that well.  I can't say it was food poisoning but let's just say my stomach was not happy with BJs. For the most part all servers had pleasant smiles but at the end of the day a smile can only go so far.  Nothing was comped, nor expected to be.  I was asked if I was finished with my plate and before I could mutter a yes the server throw a napkin in my dish and began to pick up my plate. Nerves much? I will probably go back to BJs again for some birthday gathering or late-night drinking but as for the food, I think once was enough."
Cassie H.,"Smith River, CA",52,23,6,5.0,9/30/2015,"Waitress was very nice and attentive. The outdoor patio was heated, which is nice for those who get cold easy. Niece had chicken fettuccine Alfredo and said the chicken was on the dry side, but she liked her meal anyways. Our pizza was loaded with toppings!  The manager did us right by giving us free appetizer due to a mistake with our order. I would go back!"
Danny W.,"Salt Lake City, UT",27,241,7,3.0,10/25/2015,typical brew house and typical food. Nothing great with this place but not bad. Its what you should expect for a normal brewhouse. Its ok thats all.
Fernando F.,"Redwood City, CA",2,32,2,2.0,11/27/2015,"Had lunch with my wife and children.  The kids macaroni and cheese was clearly reheated.  We had the lunch special and it was sad.  The salad that came with our meal was limp and wilting.  The service was ok, but the food was just sad.  Anyone can make a pizza, its easy and very difficult to screw up.  But when the other dishes are lacking quality (reheated mac and cheese...really) something is going wrong in that kitchen.  Stay away, go somewhere worth the tasting experience and value.  Just because there is a big screen tv in every nook and cranny of the place am I not supposed to observe what I'm eating or are those just distractors? hmmm."
Kaitlyn W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",7,10,7,5.0,5/10/2012,"I went to the Coddingtown BJ's last night for a pre opening dinner. Sat at the bar, since that's where my BF was working. Had the BJ's Blonde, and the BJ's Raspberry Cider. Very good and refreshing (and only $4.25 each!) For the meal I got the shrimp taco's (on the menu for $8.95) and my friend got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes ($13.50) Both meals were AMAZING! Cooked perfectly, definitely not frozen, all freshly cooked. Got the pizookie trio with 3 different cookies. Couldn't finish them since we were full, but they were warm, gooey amazingness. For you who don't know what a pizookie is, it is a made to order cookie baked in it's own little pan, topped with a scoop of ice cream.(I think it was $8.50 for all 3) At the bar, they have 1 big TV screen which is split into 4 different screens. As a big baseball fan, major plus. Music was a little loud for my liking, but it was good mixture of music (80's, 90's, now) Definitely will be going back to keep trying all the BJ's beers, watch baseball, and enjoy the food."
Teri R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",58,149,15,2.0,5/23/2012,"Went here last Sunday with the family. I ordered the deep dish pizza, my husband ordered the french dip, someone else ordered the turkey burger and my niece got a pasta dish. We ordered the pizookie as well.  The pizza was definitely NOT deep dish at all! It was pretty tasteless.Everyone else said their food was okay. Nothing was good, just edible.  Service was also slow. Cannot for the life of me understand the five stars some people gave this place.  It is very mediocre (at best.)"
