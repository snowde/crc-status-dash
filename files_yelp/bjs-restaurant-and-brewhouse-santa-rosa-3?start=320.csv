Christopher K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,33,6,4.0,5/30/2016,"Went here for grandson's birthday April 6, 2016. He ordered the rootbeer BBQ ribs and was in total ecstasy. Hamburgers were great. No complaints from anyone of party of 6."
Allen S.,"Vacaville, CA",1,10,2,3.0,1/10/2016,Too often I go with my wife and kids to only be disappointed with the service and food.  If it's not one its the other.  Tonight we went and the server came by after waiting 8 minutes..  He even said his priority was a party/group (in his words own words).  Asked for the rib eye steak medium well and got it more medium rare in a couple places.  I'm just done going here for a while with the constant missed opportunities they have.
Mindy S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",36,2,,1.0,3/26/2015,The refused to serve a gay teenage and his family cause he is gay.  I am protesting their restaurant.  Hope you close and go bankrupt.
Mike O.,"San Francisco, CA",267,219,13,5.0,9/18/2015,Wade and the staff. Thank you for giving back to the friends and loved ones of the Valley Fire. It's now our turn to give back.  Also. Great food. Friendly staff and a cool outdoor patio.
Mike H.,"Mountain View, CA",29,50,39,2.0,6/1/2015,Something wrong with this location. We normally enjoy the food especially gluten free options at BJs. This location seems to be clueless about gf and the menu items we did have ranged from okay to unedible.
Jasmine P.,"Windsor, CA",0,6,6,1.0,11/18/2016,service sucks everyday of the week! but the pazookis are bomb & some of their food is too.
Heidi L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,19,7,1.0,3/9/2015,"I seriously wish I had read the reviews before coming here!! My husband and I were shopping and decided to stop in to BJs for a late lunch on Saturday 03/07/15. It appears to be a pretty popular place and we have seen multiple friends ""check-in"" at this location on Facebook. When we arrived I asked the host if we could sit on the patio, he told me ""let me check if we have a clean table available"". He quickly returned to lead us outside. He brought us to a disgusting table! The table itself was wiped clean but the seats were covered in crumbs and the floor underneath was coated in mac n cheese! My husband and I looked at each other like ""seriously"" and couldn't help but to laugh a little. We were shocked! When I pointed out how dirty it was he said ""let me grab someone to clean that"" ...wasn't that what he had gone to check on before he lead us out there? We now were standing there awkwardly waiting for someone to come clean up the mess. Even the people already seated were shocked and a couple seated nearby even commented to us about gross it was. When someone came over to ""clean up"" he swept the seats with the same broom he used on the floor, GROSS! We asked to be seated at another table down the way a bit which was also dirty but at least the floor and seats were semi-decent. He quickly cleaned the table up and apologized to us and even he seemed surprised that the host brought us out there. I felt in my gut that we should have left at that moment, however we stayed. Mistake! We ordered drinks, mine was a Mocktail since I'm pregnant and it was fine. My husband ordered a BJs Mojito and it tasted like limeaid, it was EXTREMELY weak. My mocktail tasted stronger lol, I actually had to double check with the waitress that there was no alcohol in it. We let the waitress know that his drink was weak and she suggested an additional shot and he happily accepted ...but she charged us for it! Seriously? We then ordered a good amount of food and my reviews of it follows:  Calamari - it was ok, not very crispy and a little limp.  Carnitas Fries - soggy soggy soggy.  Bison burger - the patty tasted like anything but what a bison burger should taste like. It was more like a pre-frozen grocery store patty or something you could get at Burger King, YUCK!  We also ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms - this was the only plate that was good, they were very good and I wish everything else had been too.  Our waitress was pleasant, she seemed a little shy and reserved but very sweet. I honestly feel like our experience there was crap, and that's putting it lightly. I am not one to cause a scene in a public place so we left her a cash tip and went on our way peacefully. I have since written an email to BJs for review and I have requested a FULL REFUND!! I paid $60.19 for a crap meal and dirty tables. I do not want to be offered a gift card or free meal on BJs I simply want my money back!  We left feeling completely grossed out and we have zero plans to ever return!! BLAH! I wish I could give ZERO STARS!!"
John G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,17,13,3.0,5/23/2014,We're gluttons for punishment. Like the food and the beer. The service is usually terribly slow. Let's hope this time is better. Part 2. Waited over 40 minutes for food. After we got the food realized we had no silverware. Not even that busy tonight.
Stephanie V.,"Windsor, CA",143,262,394,3.0,9/13/2012,"Had a good experience here.  It's loud. It's packed. It's HUGE.  I didn't know this was a chain restaurant.  Husband recently went to a BJ's in Pleasanton and while he didn't RAVE about the food, he had a good time.  I was curious, and recently learned that they'd opened at Coddingtown, so we went. I ordered the grilled steak salad.  I asked for the steak to be cooked medium, and it was.  Otherwise, it would have been cooked medium-well.  ?!?!?  Blech.  The salad was dressed nicely, and there were grilled veggies and roasted potatoes in it.  I pigged out and ate the whole thing.  It could easily have been lunch the next day too. Husband got the chicken club and was quite happy with it. Daughter got the grilled cheese and loved it.  The kid's menu is ok, but instead of offering sticky rice (WTH?) they should just offer plain ol' steamed white rice, and brown rice too.  We didn't get appetizers and we just drank water so our bill was reasonable.  Our waiter was wonderful and offered us a card that has anywhere between a $5 - $500 value on it.  Won't know until we go back (and THAT, my dear, is how they get ya!). I can see us going back for some apps and a couple drinks.  And who knows... maybe we'll have $500 credit there..."
Joyce S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,5,1,5.0,6/27/2016,Just had the Santa Fe Salad with blackened salmon a few days ago. It was fantastic!
Andrea H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,15,2,1.0,12/11/2015,Very disappointed.  First time I went I had to wait for an hour to get seated.  Tonight I thought I would try it again via curb side and ended up with a very hard gluten free pizza and a hamburger that was good but they forgot the fries.  I don't think I will ever go back.  Just not worth the disappointment when there are so many other great restaurants in town.
Kessalia W.,"Hopland, CA",12,26,2,2.0,5/17/2015,"I love BJ's.  Just not THIS one.  The Santa Rosa BJs is consistently mediocre. We have been here quite a few times, had a negative experience, forgotten about it over time, and returned. This will be the last time. There are plenty of other BETTER places to eat nearby. Tonight was my husband, son and myself.  First off, they said it would be about a 5 minute wait.  Everyone who came in after us was seated right iff, I thought 'wow a lot of people must be using their app to call ahead'... but no, they apparently forgot about us, so it was closer to 10 minutes. They took us over to a table (not a booth, but I didn't voice my preference) and didn't ask if my 2 year old needed a high chair or booster, but luckily he was fine in a chair.  We ordered a pizza, since they usually are pretty good.  Not so much this time, but whatever.  We also ordered a BOWL of clam chowder for a ridiculous $6.50.  Usually just get the cup, but we were hungry and wanted to share.  It looked like they dumped the cup into a bowl; it was not a lot of soup for that price.  When the pizza finally came, they had to find some plates for us, and only brought 2.  So we had to ask for another for the kid.  We also asked for some ranch to dip the crusts in, and they brought ONE tiny cup for the 3 of us... smh So sorry about the rambling essay, but we've wasted enough money giving this BJ's multiple chances for redemption.  I'd suggest finding someplace else to go.  There's a Chipotle next door, and a Dim Sum place down the street we'll go to next time we're in town."
Holly G.,"Petaluma, CA",1,14,,2.0,5/19/2015,Okay food. Very expensive for quality and service. I only go for pizookie. I went there for lunch today. There wasn't a big crowd but it is always so loud in there. I can't even hear myself think. We order appetizers and had to ask to get plates. Not a big deal but a little silly. It took forever to get drinks filled. They took out appetizer order and disappeared for a while and finally came back to get our lunch order. Food came out fast. But then we needed to pay and go and our waiter took a long time to get out check. We had to track him down in order to pay.
Michael C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,30,,2.0,11/13/2015,"As far as the food and beer goes, it's no different than any other chain type place (Chili's, applebee's etc.) The atmosphere and interior is definitely a lot nicer which normally is enough to give it the edge compared to those other places. But this place has had pretty bad service every time I've been here which is 4 or 5 times at this point. To be clear though, most of the times it wasn't the waitresses fault. They were friendly and helpful they just seemed to be understaffed and asked to serve too many tables that were too far apart. So maybe it's a management issue here but definitely something they need to sort out."
David B.,"Rohnert Park, CA",60,3,,5.0,9/16/2015,Four stars to BJ's not just because it is a good place for a meal and a pint. but because of their compassion and support for victims of the nearby Valley Fire as proven on Facebook: 
Russ W.,"Petaluma, CA",70,15,3,5.0,8/7/2015,I love the Jambalaya at BJs. Beer is always clean and their variety covers the gambit. I'm not into the whole sports bar thing but the food makes up for the atmosphere. Dining at the bar is fast and unencumbered. Great place to prep for a show at the JC.
Keith X.,"Santa Rosa, CA",63,238,101,2.0,2/8/2014,"Our group had someone come in late and the staff took her order late, but her food came out with the rest of ours, so that was handled well by not serving everyone but her.   I ordered the Barbeque Bison Burger.  The patty was too small.  The bun was toasted, but it made it seem kind of stale.  The fries were good. My friend ordered the thin fries and they were cold within a few minutes and didn't taste very well, so she ordered an additional order of potato wedge fries.  Sucks when someone has to order an additional dish to fill up. My friend was in the bathroom when she saw a hostess leave a stall and exit the bathroom without washing her hands.  Ick."
Mike S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,3.0,6/3/2016,"If there is one thing that I do not like about restaurants it is inconsistency in food quality.One time it is great and then you have the same dish next time and it is awful.That is how BJ's Santa Rosa is.For example the clam chowder in a bread bowl.The first two times that I ordered it I claimed it was better than Boudin.The last two times I got very little chowder one time and watery chowder the last and final time I will ever order it.On 6/1/2016 my wife and I returned once more.I ordered the lemon thyme chicken and she got broccoli soup and salad.The chicken in my dish was tough and dry.Except for that it was good.Broccoli was non existent in her soup and her salad was wilted.If you want great atmosphere this is the place to come.If you are going for the food ,good luck !"
Isabella M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,5,,5.0,12/22/2013,"You ""1 star"" and ""2 star"" people need to relax.  I agree that there are some individuals I have heard/seen at this particular BJ's that honestly should not work there, but they do, and hopefully in time they will either become better/more professional at their jobs, or simply move on.  With that being said, I have never had a truly negative time at this BJ's. More than not, my family and I have had EXCELLENT experiences there, every time. Hostesses: There have been busier days where we have been quoted 30-45 minute wait times, and while unfortunate, those quote times have been pretty accurate. And I find it funny how people tend to chew-out those poor girls when it takes ""too long"" for their table to be ready. Do people expect them to ask the people eating at the tables to just stop eating, and leave? Managers are the ones who give the Hosts the quote times to give to us, so just try to relax. We have been seated by our hostesses who have always been friendly, some just quieter or more shy than others, but always kind. They do seem rushed at times, but remember when you were angry with them for taking too long to seat you? Well, they are rushing back to go seat all those other people who were angry too.  Servers: I've had not just one, but a few of THE best servers I've ever experienced in my life at this BJ's. Always quick, even on horrendously busy evenings. Always smiling, always friendly, always knowledgeable, always on top of whatever we have needed, always one step ahead of us on refills, extra sauce, more napkins, etc. And like I said, this has come from MORE than just one server I've experienced. Food: Huge portions and so many options along with very reasonable prices. Not too sure what so many people seem to have an issue with. My boyfriend's food came out a bit too cold for him, once, and our server had it re-heated right away, and all was well. So before people get turned-off from going to this BJ's, I highly suggest that you go in and give it a try. Especially if you, for whatever reason, did NOT have a good experience there before, just try again at least one more time. Sometimes it's a person's attitude that can make all the difference in a situation. 5 of 5 stars. Keep up the great work BJ's in Coddingtown :)"
Art B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",43,189,9,3.0,10/26/2012,"BJ's is what it is. It is a big chain very comparable to the Cheesecake Factory crossed with a sports bar. Only the beer isn't really any good. The food is ok. Just ok. The service is professional. I liked the jambalaya on my first visit. Not bad for a chain. The ""handcrafted"" sodas here are terrible. But hey, them cookies with ice cream sure are good."
