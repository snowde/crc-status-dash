Mitchell B.,"Petaluma, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/18/2015,"Waited over an hour for food during an admittedly pretty busy Saturday night. Our waitress didn't check on us between ordering and receiving food. Eventually a manager came by and apologized (still no waitress) and confirmed that their kitchen was busy and was making our food (2 burgers and a French dip, nothing special) The food we received was lukewarm and they actually brought out the wrong kind of burger for my dad, but he wasn't going to wait again, so we all ate because we were very hungry at that point.  When our waitress brought us the check, she acted like nothing bad had happened. No apology. The management did take off my dad's entire meal and reduced the price of the rest of the food/drink.  While service from the waitress was poor and the kitchen was primarily to blame, the manager or supervisor who came by was professional and understanding of our annoyance. I work in food service too and I definitely understand the position he was in. He's the reason why I gave BJ's 2 stars.  This was my first and probably last trip to BJ's. I've had better service and food at McDonald's."
Ashlyn J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",23,6,,1.0,12/14/2013,"This place is a JOKE. We went in on a Saturday evening with 4 other people. We called ahead and then waited (not long) for our table. That was the best part of our experience. The girl who waited on us was really nice and friendly but was as slow as can be. We decided to be understanding (I am a server myself) because it was so busy and sometimes people get overwhelmed. We were celebrating my sister in laws 21st birthday. our drinks took 25 minutes to come out and she set the tray on the table and admitted that she had no clue what drink was which. We had to tell her. She claimed since she wasn't 21 she didn't know.. I'm sorry, but who on earth hires a server that doesn't know their drink menu?! Our food came out probably 35 minutes after our drinks..However there was no silverware. Being nice we all ate our freaking food with our hands. She came by when the meal was done and finally refilled our waters (that had been empty almost the entire time). My fiancee picked up the check for everyone...nope the nightmare isn't over.  SHE SWITCHED OUR CARD WITH SOMEONE ELSE! We went Christmas shopping after and realized the card he had was NOT the card he gave our server. Tired and pissed off we went BACK to BJ's and spoke to the manager. She had no clue what to do. I don't blame her considering I have never seen this happen. We gave her our info and asked for her to comp the charges on OUR card and the other card considering they weren't our charges to begin with. She comp'd the food but insisted it was against the law to comp alcohol (it's not). We were really nice and tried not to be those rude people everyone hates in a restaurant.  We recommended that they put more servers on on busy nights since our poor server seemed so in over her head. She told us that each server only has three table sections! THREE! How do you not give perfect service?!  There is a pattern of horrible servers at this place. I don't even blame the servers. BJ's needs to do a way better job at training their employees.  This USED to be a place we would frequent. We will not be returning. I'd give zero stars but then I couldn't leave a review."
M E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",35,57,28,3.0,12/14/2013,"Ummm yeah if you like bacon, blue cheese, tomatoes and onions... this wedge salad will knock your socks off!!!  It's kinda small, so no sharesies, hands off my salad!! Don't forget to order the deep fried artichokes but make sure they arrive piping hot, they taste muuuch better hot. Seasonal pumpkin ale rocks and surprisingly the pizza crust is pretty bomb.  Yup noisy too.  Do I mind? Nah, I sit in the bar so I miss out on all the fun of being ignored by busy servers.  The food is pretty good but I agree with an earlier review the the avocado roll is pretty freaking awful. This coming from a gal who eats them whole. Smeh. If you happen to order the Mahi Tacos, ask them to either lightly toast the tortilla or not at all, if you leave it as is, it comes out pretty stiff and chewy.  Service tonight was spot on. First times a charm. Fortunately most nights I go out,  I'm not in a rush, so I don't mind much if service is slower. But I do have to admit that it hasn't always been great service or great food, but I do love love love the wedge salad so much I punish myself time and time again just to have it. But tonight paid off! Yippee!! The only thing that was missed was a spatula for they pizza. .. not too shabby!  Come here prepared for the worst that way you'll never be disappointed!   Mmmmm wedge. .. blue cheese. .. bacon. ..beer:)"
Renee j.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/30/2015,"So glad to see BJ's finally get their act together!  We tried them several times when they first opened.  Service was awful!  Food was always late and often cold.  Angry customers everywhere.  We vowed never to go back, but their menu is so varied we decided to try again after one year away.  We are so happy we did!  Our server was Angela.  She was the bomb!  She gave the right amount of attention and scheduled our courses as we like them, with a bit of space in between.  We will be sure to ask for her section every time we go!  Food was delicious and served warm!   Further, it appears that they are really getting their act together.  No disgruntled customers that we saw.  Lots of people waiting. That's a good sign.   We will be back!"
Alyssa M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,133,12,2.0,2/26/2015,"Not impressed. Nice decor, but that's it. All items we tried were unsuccessful attempts at taking a spin on a traditional dish. Avocado rolls were a great big mushy disaster, the lentil salad was a failure & the Mediterranean chicken pita was the taste of a tub of sour cream. Sorry not good enough to entertain again. Gave 2 stars only because of the nice decor, renovation & being clean otherwise too load to hold a conversation & you leave starving cause the food you order was disgusting."
Kate H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",112,9,2,5.0,7/31/2015,"Mark was the best server ever. Replaced a hamburger that had aioli on it when we asked for no mayonnaise, and gave us a pazookie on the house. Attentive. Thanks :)"
Erika Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,108,3,1.0,3/23/2015,I don't know how its even possible that every single time I come here they mess up our order! the only thing they do right is the dessert. Don't think ill be coming back again! Cheesecake Factory is a lot better. worth the extra $$$
Liz W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,14,1,2.0,6/23/2014,"My experience at this restaurant was horrible to say the least. The wait to get in was very long, the table was dirty when we got there, the waitress completely abandoned us, and the food was mediocre. I would not return.  I ordered stuffed mushrooms and a roast beef dip sandwich. My partner ordered buffalo wings and a dessert. Everything tasted great but it was not worth the wait. We spent two hours in the restaurant and only ordered these few things. The rest of the time was waiting for service.  Just to underscore my main point; do not bother with this restaurant."
Melissa B.,"Hopland, CA",0,8,,5.0,12/21/2015,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews for this place. I imagine they're from people who have either never worked in the service industry, or are just overly difficult to begin with. My husband and I tried this place for the first time last night and everything from food to service was tip top. We were promptly sat and greeted by our server Eli. He was super friendly and made several excellent recommendations for food and drinks. I had their royal soda and husband had a beer and cider mix, both super good. We ordered a deep dish pizza, which I was really impressed with. I don't usually like deep dish pizza because it's too saucy and soggy, but this one was perfect! In fact, it's still just as good the next day! We ordered a pizooki sampler, which was out of this world good. The total came to 53 dollars, which I feel is completely reasonable for how much food we got. Excellent atmosphere, service, and food. This place doesn't try to ""fancy"" everything up like most places in the area, and that's a really nice change of pace. Ignore the negative reviews and go try this place for yourself."
Paul M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",7,53,8,2.0,2/4/2014,"Beer selection?  Pretty good.  House-made beers?  Pretty tasty.  Service.  Oy vey.  The   service is excruciatingly slow-- either they are terribly understaffed, or the servers just aren't properly trained.  It took about 15 minutes of sitting and waiting before someone took our drink order, and another 15 minutes before someone took our food order.  The food came out quickly, but it was underwhelming, and was really ruined by the lackluster service."
Susan T.,"Fulton, CA",2,11,16,2.0,6/12/2015,I ordered from the curbside pickup and ended up waiting 20 mins past the time it said my food would be ready online. Also they got my order wrong. In my opinion a little overpriced for what I got. The best part of my experience was the girl who brought the food to my car. She was very nice and apologetic for the wait!
Alejandro M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,10,,2.0,3/22/2015,Service is usually horrible food is ok nothin special. Just go here to drink a beer or two not to eat.
Kena M.,"Fort Bragg, CA",38,3,,5.0,8/14/2015,I went here and we were greeted the waitress had a great attitude and it took us a while to figure out what we wanted and they gave us time. My aunt had the burger the bun was amazing except the bottom bun was a little soggy and she asked for grilled onions and she only got 4 tiny ones. My uncle got the sirloin and it was well done and PERFECT and for being the most hated vegetable the Brussels sprouts were amazing! I had the chicken Alfredo and the sauce was amazing and so creamy! And the bathrooms....... spelled looked and overall were really good!  Overall: I would recommend this place and its right next to the mall!
Sarah F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,,1.0,10/26/2016,"Frustrating is putting it mildly. I went in there last week with my boyfriend ordered drinks and appetizers they came with no problem. The waiter took our food order and before we knew it, it was 30 minutes later and still no food. The manager on shift that night came to our table and said that our dinner order was lost. Well the waiter never put our order in. They DID NOT COMP us anything. And we never got our food. We still had to pay for our drinks and appetizers!!! So We thought we would give it another try and we took my son with us tonight to dinner. We  ordered our drinks, appetizers, and our dinner all at the same time. We were seated at 8 pm at 8:45 the waiter came to our table with half of our order. My boyfriend got his dinner as well as my son. She said that my chicken wings were not ready yet and she would bring them right out. Well that took anther 10 minute's while I watched my son and boyfriend eat there meal and finish their meal here came my chicken wings. Well I told the waiter to keep them I didn't want them. She took them off our tab and apologized. They need to get their SH*T together in that kitchen and restaurant!!!! VERY Disappointed!!!!!"
Philip M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",395,752,957,3.0,6/12/2012,Hamburgers are huge portions and delicious. The homemade root beer is also delicious.  The steak wasn't very flavorful. kinda bland...could use more spices or flavoring. service is decent. waters and sodas were filled on consistent basis. Would I come here with friends for a celebration? yes. Would I come here for lunch/dinner just because I am hungry? most likely not.
Anthony Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,39,1,1.0,8/30/2013,"Waited a bit for our food. Food was messed up. Waited again for waitress. Told her it was messed up. Waited again for waitress. ""ah shit I forgot about your order..."" Waited again. Manager offered to take meal off my bill...the one I never got. Wish I could write a review about the meal. The iced tea had ice..."
Shiya D.,"San Jose, CA",0,8,4,1.0,5/7/2015,"Worst service ever! After being told there was only 10 min wait we ended up waiting 20 mins. After getting seated and waiting another 15 mins only after I glared at every waitress walk by our table the ""manager"" came up to our table and noticed we had no plates, no drinks and no napkins. She offered to take our entire order, once we gave it her (she didn't write it down) we waited another 10 mins for our drinks. Once we get our drinks we, again you guessed it wait another 15 mins as we see our appetizer walk by and the server looking baffled as I signal to her if is our plate she carries it back to the kitchen and which by that point my husband and I don't even finish our drinks and walk out. Now mind you there is a server/busser whatever cleaning the table next to us whom I know hears us say that we are leaving and the service is just deplorable as we are saying it loud enough for her to hear. Her only reaction was look at me and role her eyes.  Look I get things happen that are out of your control. Here is how I look at though, you have customer who DON'T CARE! And you know why cause they came with money to pay your wages and not care about anything else. All you have do at that point is apologize and try to be as gracious as possible about any and all complications. It really isn't that hard to do. Unfortunately BJ's could care less about the customer there a big company and we are a dime a dozen. BJ's you big enough to get it together and figure it out cause at this point your gross."
Kim D.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,34,1,4.0,5/5/2015,"I really like this place a lot. It's close to my work, and thy have a gluten free menu. I think their GF pizza is fantastic, and if I've ever had a problem with anything it has been rectified immediately. If you're going to sit down inside, sometimes the service can be poor, which would be my only complaint. I always get mine to go, and it's always delicious!"
Ariel G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",7,8,2,4.0,8/3/2015,"The pazookies here are amazing! Customer service here is pretty good, seems clean overall, just wish it wasn't so loud sometimes"
Dane R.,"Fairfield, CA",1,32,2,5.0,1/1/2015,I had a really nice lunch at BJ's with my wife and daughter. The portion sizes were very generous and delicious. Joaquin was our server and was fantastic. He was very attentive and checked back regularly to make sure everything was wonderful. Defiantly going back again.
