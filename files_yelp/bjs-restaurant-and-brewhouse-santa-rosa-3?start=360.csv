Kim L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,3,2.0,10/13/2016,"I hate writing bad reviews.....so usually I just don't but after tonight I am so over this place! I LOVED it when it first opened....now I can never seem to wait less than 45 min-1hr for food (MINIMUM). The food is OK, but not worth that kind of a wait....tonight the waitress forgot my drink like at least 4 times and in the end we had to say we needed to cancel our orders. The manager asked if he could check on it and then he could box it up to go and he would comp the whole bill...I am giving 2 stars because he DID comp the whole bill, but when he went back to check, he then pretty much disappeared, never came out to update us or anything. Then the runner came out with 1/2 the food not even boxed. When we told him we needed it boxed because we had to leave, they disappeared again...15 minutes later, we went up to ask and then suddenly they hand us our boxes....most insanely horrid service I think I've ever had! At this point, this was not the first time, not sure we will be going back again."
Joseph T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",51,37,,1.0,10/30/2014,"Food is good, always hot... once you actually get it. Here's how to survive a trip to BJ's.  Put your name on the list as soon as you can. Often we let one person out of the car and have them go put our name on the list while parking the car. Whatever you do, do NOT sit at the bar. The service at the bar is actually worse than on the main floor, which is pretty bad in its own right. When you put your name on the list tell them you do NOT wish to sit at the bar or in the bar area and insist on giving them your last initial too, or give them a funny name that won't be mistaken for someone else. I have in the past been skipped over, then given a table at the bar (which is first come first served)... so essentially I waited around for 30-45 minutes for nothing and was NOT comped any part of the meal nor felt like they properly apologized for their mistake. So give them a name they won't forget and can't be mistaken for someone else. They don't have little vibrating squares like most popular restaurants so unfortunately you will be forced to sit or stand while waiting for your table. I have a solution for that too. If you are not with your kids, go grab a drink at the bar and order an appetizer as well. If you order your appetizer at your table, more often than not it will delay your meal OR it will come out WITH your main course. If you do not intend to get an appetizer, at the very least you will be able to sit down in ear shot of the hostess and enjoy a beverage. HOWEVER, it gets VERY loud in there, so keep your wits about you as if they call your name and you do not hear it, they will seat someone else. The bar tender seems like the best service in that entire restaurant though. So it's easier to get a beer and an appetizer from him than your server, trust me there. When you do get seated, if you want water you will have to ask for it as they do not bring you water unless you ask for it. While you were waiting 20-45 minutes for your table, you should have been looking at the menu... that way the minute you see your waitress you can put in your order. It sometimes takes 5-10 minutes before you will see your server, and they will not come back as often as you'd like them to, so I would advise placing your drinks AND food order the very first time you see her. We've been there 4 times now, and each time figured some new way to minimize the time spent in the restaurant and/or waiting for service or food. Be prepared to spend 1-2 hours in that restaurant on average. These tips will help you survive BJ's of Santa Rosa. I've been to other BJ's down south, they are not all this bad. This particular one however has the worst service in any restaurant I've ever been in. The food is fantastic, the beer is pretty darn good too, but the service is terrible. 2/4 waitresses we've had did not look like they were happy to work there. I feel like this is due to the improper floor management or them being overworked. Often in a restaurant it is not your servers, but rather the management that should be looked at to solve all the issues I've listed above. Their disposition is most likely a representation of their frustration with poor management. Ways to improve BJ's. Online check in for waiting, little buzzer things, better management, and improved servers."
Dan T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,19,,1.0,7/21/2013,"Macaroni & cheese dish with...wait for it...wait...crumbled gold fish crackers! WTH!?!?! The service is poor, management is horrendous and this BJ's surely cannot be the same as in San Diego, yet they are!  I have been three times and with the feedback from friends and family who have also visited, none of us will visit this restaurant...at least not in Santa Rosa.  My recommendation is to go find another place to drink, munch and eat at. Its rather fitting they are located in Coddington mall. Too bad Yelp does not have NEGATIVE rankings! FYI, still have not been since my last review and I hear its the same old story and this poorly restaurant."
Francine M.,"Saint Helena, CA",11,7,2,1.0,3/20/2015,"If  I could give no stars I would. Dirty dishes, greasy dishes, just gross. Food that was overcooked, undercooked and burned. Calamari was cold and rubbery. The spaghetti was hard and cold and the""melted"" cheese was hard and cold. The stuffed mushrooms were raw. The soup had this film on it that was just gross. The rice under the salmon was hard, and dried out. Ended up walking out and the manager contemplated actually charging us for  the meal that was to gross to eat. It will be a loooong time before we return. Numerous people were returning food tonight. Food was going back left and right."
Christina N.,"San Jose, CA",9,71,15,1.0,10/9/2014,"This is the worst BJs I've been to. The food did not taste as it should, we ordered 3-4 dishes and we couldn't eat half because we were so repelled by the taste. And these are dishes that we've ordered before at other BJs as well. Not to mention our server had a busboy completely clear our table before we even received our pizookies, we did not have anything to drink while eating dessert because our cups had been taken away. Horrible service, horrible food."
Mitchell M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,2,1,4.0,6/28/2015,"I really love the food here and the service is top notch! I've had the burgers, pizza and chicken Alfredo pasta. All were amazing. My one and only gripe is the price. For my daughter, my wife and myself the bill always ends up being around 60 dollars. No appetizers or deserts and no one is ordering the steak and lobster. I highly recommend."
Mark R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/20/2015,"We eat here about once a month, just tried there take out for the first and last time. I looked at the burger and thought it was a joke, they must have run out of lettuce and tomatoes, as we got a shriveled up piece of lettuce and two very tiny tomato ends, the burger was ordered well done they achieved this by poking the center of the meat so many times it wouldn't hold together. I paid with cash but the kid who took my money couldn't find a drawer to make change and nobody wanted to help him out, so after ten minutes more of waiting for change I hunted him down and gave him a credit card....what a joke of an experience. Not sure if I'll ever be back, they lost a very good customer."
Eric Y.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",73,1,,1.0,2/17/2013,"I am disappointed not because of the food but the service. We specifically requested a table near the tv so that we can watch the nba All star game. We got seated very close to a tv and we were enjoying our dinner and the all star game. Obviously this weekend everyone is watching the all star events, but for some reason another customer wanted to watch hockey and the employees decided to change the channel to watch hockey... Hockey are u serious on a nba all star weekend the employees decide to change the damn channel to watch hockey! We tried talking to the manager but guess he/she didn't want to change it.  Whoever the shift manager was during the all star game this directed to you. When a customer asks to be seated to watch a certain sporting event do not change the channel on them. I also work in a customer service industry and what you guys did lost a customer."
Irene S.,"Monterey, CA",1164,565,,5.0,5/30/2013,"Just like all BJ Brewhouses, this one has great service, great food, and great atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I love the happy hour especially for their discounted $6 mini pizzas, discounted appetizers and discounted beers!   To make your experience at this BJs Brewhouse the best it can be as for any of these restaurants, I would suggest getting on their email newsletter for the latest specials and coupons.  Subscribing to their newsletter is so worth it, especially because when your birthday comes around, you can get a free pizookie dessert!   Another thing worth getting is the rewards card but it is best to request it once you are at the restaurant.  Do not fill out for the rewards program Online as you will most likely then not get a card and will have to remember you personal reward code otherwise. But you can always give the waiter/waitress your phone number and then they can look it up.  This rewards program can give you points that can count toward discounted or free meals. Every meal you purchase there can be worth points to future meals there. You just got to remember to request when you eat there to get the points transferred onto your card.  It can by the way get very confusing- this reward program.  My boyfriend and I have been part of the program for about a year and are still trying to figure it out.   My boyfriend and I travel often, and have been to just about every BJs Brewhouse in Northern California.  We have found the the restaurants are consistently pretty good overall.  My boyfriend loves their award winning beer.  I love their deep dish pizzas.  Their desserts are unique and amazingly tasty! I love those pizookies - (icecream on top of a large warm cookie-  yummy! Pros: -All BJ Restaurants are consistent in great service and food -Has the unique Pizookie desserts -has a reward card program and an e-newsletter with the occasional coupon -great happy hour deals including $6 pizzas! -award winning beer Cons: - no more auctions with reward card points - can get noisy and loud  -is very crowded during happy hour"
Claire P.,"Oakland, CA",8,27,2,2.0,2/25/2013,"For the amount of money B.J. charges on their regular menu, there should be flecks of gold in the appetizers and the wait staff should be singing songs to a grand piano by request. In all seriousness, the food is mediocre, the price of drinks is robbery, and the waitress tries to jam some avocado something-or-other down your throat by asking 3 times if you'd ""like to try the [insert unappealing and overpriced item here]"". No thank you, I would not. I'm giving it 2 stars because the beer selection is good and whatever bacon they use on their baked potato IS delicious. But maybe it's just because it's bacon. And beer. If you're looking to grab some good grub, down a drink or two, and enjoy time with people you like, there are so many better places to do those things. Unfortunately, B.J.'s is not worth the wait or the money."
Ash L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/9/2015,"I've been to several BJ's, and I don't have the highest of expectations. Food is decent with more than enough options to choose from, nice atmosphere to catch a game, but this Santa Rosa location is the worst example. Gave them one more chance a couple weeks ago after a bad experience the first time...service was Non existent. They weren't even busy. Brought out our food and didn't return to check on us until after we were sitting around with our empty plates for almost 10 minutes. Won't ever go back here. Waste of $"
Rashawd H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,12,3,4.0,4/11/2014,Great looking place. Nice environment for a group or a small date. Great beer selection too
Kirstyne L.,"El Segundo, CA",2,25,15,3.0,1/29/2014,"I'll give three stars.  I'm a fan of BJs, what they serve and love the seasonal drinks too. But this location is in much need of some SERIOUS TLC. Yes, there are tons of factors that impact the ability to provide great service, but I honestly cannot pinpoint what it is at this location that always results in a disappointing experience.  Maybe it's lack of training or enthusiasm, although I cannot say that for all the wait staff bc we've had occasions of REALLY GREAT servers and ridiculously slow kitchen times. Moving to such a small town from a really big SoCal city, this location does ok, but I think there is room to do much better especially when dinning in during the slower business hours.  We probably wont' be back for a few months, but the hope of improved quality is not completely lost."
Curtis A.,"Renton, WA",217,136,95,3.0,7/13/2013,"First time to a BJ's chain was back in 2006 in Southern California. My first impression was great. It's fast paced and the atmosphere feels like you are in Cheesecake Factory. It's not that it is fancy but its feels lively in there.  We sat down after a small wait being handed those pagers that beep and starts to flash The menu is huge. We started traditional classic buffalo wings and pint of beer. Yum! Those were seriously so good. A little bit of spice made for a delicious way to start off. Other than that, the food is OK. They also have a large selection of been on tap. I choose the darkest beer, which I thought I would hate, but was actually quite tasty. I've been popping into BJ's throughout California here and there over the years, but mostly for their Pazzooki deser. Warm soft cookie the size of a large pizza, topped off with your choice to ice-cream. Yummy!"
Lisa S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,2.0,12/23/2014,"Do not go on a Saturday night!!!  Seated quickly ,  but food took FOREVER!   No sorry for the wait or comped items.  Staff very nice.  Food very mediocre.   Asked not to fly paper airplanes after waiting over an hour for food.   Not going back anytime soon."
B S.,"Point Reyes Station, CA",1,48,,1.0,7/24/2013,"Stay away from this place if you expect fresh food. I didn't think I would get old food, especially with the price you pay. With what we were served with, you'll be better off eating at McDonalds. I love eating out at places like this, it's fun and the food is usually decent. Well my mother ordered the chips and salsa and baked potato skins. These were pretty tasty. For the main meal, my wife ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with a side of fries. The Sand which was ok, but it clearly not fresh.. it wasn't even warm. Her fries were OLD and DISGUSTING. You could tell they were soggy just by looking at the grease caked up on them. How hard is it took cook a fresh batch of fries up or at the very least, throw away the fries that have been sitting out for over an hour!? REALLY I ordered the chicken fried steak. I was served the chicken fried chicken! :P No big deal, I told the waitress, she apologized and about 5 minutes later my ""chicken fried steak"" came out. Ok this is where I am absolutely disgusted with this place. First of all, they looked like 2 little patties, not a  chicken fried steak. Second of all EACH PIECE was HALF BLACK from being burnt. Not just Burnt, I mean BURNT. The meat on the inside was BLACK. At the same time, it was COLD. I'm pretty sure they microwaved my chicken fried steak instead of cooking it right. The managers came over and apologized. I didn't really like the fact they told me I just happened to order the worst item on the menu, and that my steaks just happened to be tiny and that they were a little burnt. ( It looked like beef jerky, I almost puked just looking at it ) They should of took responsibility for the abomination they sent out instead of clearly trying to side step something completely unacceptable and disgusting. Look bottom line is this is the absolute worst experience I've had with food, and I've had quite a few fast food places. If your looking for fresh cooked food.. seriously save your money, learn from my mistake. I wouldn't serve my dog what they served us. I don't know if they have lazy stoner cooks in the back or what, but chances are they have not resolved the lazy cooks, which means this could very well happen to you. I hope I saved someone the trouble of going to this place, I really do."
Cindi B.,"Cloverdale, CA",36,58,19,5.0,1/23/2015,Stopped by here for lunch today and the service and food was amazing! The waiter was very friendly and attentive. I had their shrimp tacos for lunch. The shrimp tasted very fresh and the tacos were delicious! The fresh strawberry lemonade was yummy too! Their prices for lunch seemed fairly reasonable. I would highly recommend this place!
Justin O.,"Chico, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/10/2015,I'm gonna be concise and only use bullets so I don't get off track. -Disrespectful and unprofessional Manager. She talked horribly to her staff and about customers. Also doesn't know how to properly ring up a bill. -The booth that we were had food on the floor (excessive amount) and the side dishes that were brought out were wet and still had food on them from previous customers. -Waiter got orders wrong and walked away with our drinks. -Menu items that are normally delicious at other BJ'S restaurants were bland and over cooked at this location. Safe to say I will not be returing nore will most of my extended family.
Stacy R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4,9,,1.0,12/3/2012,"We went for dessert on Friday night.  It was a very stormy night and the already slippery floors were like an ice rink!!  We were seated in a section with approximately 4 other average size parties (far from busy).  My daughter commented to the hostess about the very slippery floors and the response was ""oh, I don't notice, we wear non-slip shoes"".  OK - how about the patrons that didn't get the memo about non-slip shoes?  We also told our waiter about the slippery floors and he said virtually the same thing....non-slip shoes!!  Remember, we were there for dessert ONLY.  It took 45+ minutes to get our food with no explanation from our waiter in the mean time.  THEY WERE NOT OVERWHELMINGLY BUSY!!  Dessert was good but no better than say, Baskin & Robbins right down the walk way (which would have been MUCH less expensive).  As we were leaving the waiter gave us a ridiculous and obviously rehearsed speech about how much he enjoyed spending part of the evening with us.  Which is BS since we barely saw him!   As a last effort to get someone to acknowledge the VERY slippery floors, I stopped to talk to the hostess at the front door.  After explaining that I almost fell, she looked at me with a Stepford-like expression/smile and said at least 4 times ""Oh, I'm sorry, thank you for coming in""  So, this was the last chance.  I won't go back.  It seems to have gotten worse with each visit.  What was excusable in the beginning has magnified to unacceptable."
Ashley A.,"Goleta, CA",7,13,,1.0,9/7/2014,"In the past we have visited this BJ's several times. We've always had good customer service experiences, but what keeps us returning is the food! When we recently went to dinner at this BJ's we left extremely disappointed. My boyfriend and I went out on this night because he had been gifted a BJ's gift card. We were seated right away, which for this busy restaurant scores a lot of extra points! Our server didn't greet us for 20 minutes. After that I made sure to note everything that followed.. She took our food order and our drink order. Brought us our drinks right away. 45 minutes later she finally acknowledged we hadn't received our food or even reassured us it was on it's way. About 5 minutes later she brings out a side Caesar salad, which we hadn't ordered. By this point she has offered us a free dessert for what ever mistake was made that prevented our food from being ready. We thought she brought the salad as a polite gesture and when we tried to mention it hadn't been ordered she brushed us off. Our food came after 20 minutes, we've now waited over an hour since ordering. I've been to BJs when they're swamped, and this was not one of those nights. They had a good crowd but plenty of employees standing around. We eat our dinner and it's takes her 35 minutes before she comes back for the dessert order. Which wasn't a big deal except that we were both disappointed and ready to go.. We got our complimentary desserts and ask for the check. 40 minutes late she drops the check off! At this point, we both feel like this is a joke. Our server would disappear (probably busy doing other things, but unavailable to take our check or answer questions) for 20 minutes at a time and it was getting frustrating. I saw another server who I personally knew and asked them if they could grab our server so we can wrap up and handed them the check. Our server comes back right away and tells us the gift card system is down. So after 3 hours of building frustration, this was the icing on the cake. When I'm looking over our check, I see that she had charged us for that salad. The salad WE DIDNT ORDER! I was too tired to even ask, I just wanted to leave. We paid and left immediately.  I have never been so disappointed leaving a restaurant, especially one that is as established as BJs. If the gift card system is down then the manager should take the card, verify the amount (call it in), and hold it until the system is working and ask us to pay the difference only. Maybe it was this girls first few days of work, but it left us with a really bad experience and I can't help but not want to return and to now share my feelings with others."
