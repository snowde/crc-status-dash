Sarah S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,1,1.0,4/15/2015,"I'm giving this restaurant a one star because of the food. The first time I tried BJ's was almost a year ago. I got chicken strips and fries and was sick immediately after so I gave it a break. After coming back a few months ago for a second chance with my boyfriend, we shared the chicken wings. A few hours after eating there we got horrible horrible food poisoning. We were throwing up for days. Just recently we went back for a third chance (the place is close to our apartment so why not give it another go?) we ordered pizza because you can't go wrong with pizza. Right when the waitress put the pizza down, I saw a giant piece of hair mixed in with the cheese. I'm so over BJ's.  Besides that, the servers were always nice and prices decent but I won't be giving any more chances."
Adrian G.,"Petaluma, CA",16,54,14,5.0,4/14/2014,"My wife and i finally got a night out, well a couple hours aways from our company and our 3 children were with their grandmother so we decided to go out to bjs. We were seated quickly, our waiter arived promptly took our drink order , we placed our appitizer it arived quickly, spinach and artichoke dip, it was ok chillis is much better though, we ordered our dinner everything was great.  We were in and out in 55 minutes.  Thats great fast service but we didnt feel rushed.  I would recomend."
Richard S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",32,35,,1.0,9/26/2012,"LOUSY! LOUSY! LOUSY!   TOO MUCH MONEY FOR  MEDIOCRE  TO CRAP FOOD. WATCHED A WAITRESS BYPASS A TABLE THAT HAD DIRTY DISHES ON IT. IT SAT THERE FOR 20 MINUTES.  DIRTY FLOOR  ON THE PATIO.    THE NAME SAYS IT ALL FOLKS. YELP TOOK DOWN,  MY FUNNY, BUT SCATHING REVIEW OF THIS RESTAURANT BASED ON IT'S GUIDELINES POLICY.   OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE FROM CORPORATE OR THE RESTAURANT COMPLAINED. it  went  something like this.... Hi Richard, We wanted to let you know that we've removed your review of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. Our Support team has determined that it falls outside our Content Guidelines ( ) because it lacks a substantive firsthand experience. When reviewing, please describe your actual experience with a business. We hope you will continue to participate on Yelp while keeping our Content Guidelines in mind. Removed Content:: They give you a gift card to come back, me thinks no! i was going to rant and rave about service, cleanliness, lazy ass waitresses that only want to cash out. but as you can see from the reviews alone, they've already covered that! i wish Coddingtown would have gotten a Maggiano's or Cheesecake factory. Instead we got Bj's, and what the f9#k kind of name is that for a restaurant? Is that like a psycho linguistical manipulation like HOOTERS? Appealing to male frat boyz and all that, tv screens and endless beer. Give me a break. is America that stupid? Yep, I guess they are. Young and dumb and full of....BJ'S! See how it all fits? the male urges and all. it's not about eating, it's about getting your pecker shined. LOL! I wonder if the manager has seen these reviews? or better yet has corporate seen these reviews?  Regards, Woodrow Yelp User Support San Francisco, California"
Kristen G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,20,2,1.0,6/4/2014,"I have eaten at various locations for this restaurant and by far the Santa Rosa location was the worst.  Sacramento and others have it together...good service...good food etc.  But this location has the worst service I have ever received and that has happened every time Ive gone in there to ""give them another shot"".   When my salad never came the food runner told me ""I need to talk to my waiter""...rather than ""sure let me look into that, or let me see what happened"".  They are just rude....Also food takes forever.  With the Coddingtown mall opening so many new doors they should really step it up if they want to compete with other restaurants. Worst service and even slower food...would not recommend and will not be back... Oh and the kicker...the waitress brought out dinner out and my sons order was wrong, the server left before I could say anything and when she returned I asked about it and she said ""oops wrong table""...and picked it up and gave it to the table next to us who just got their food.  Gross!  She left the plate on our table for over five minutes...what if we had taken a bite???"
Mike W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,,1.0,9/23/2015,We eat here fairly frequently and tonight was the worst service and food we have had yet. They got the order wrong twice and we waited far too long. We won't be coming back anytime soon. This place has always been hit or miss and tonight was a huge miss. Avoid this restaurant if you care to have a nice meal. I would have chosen a zero if I could have.
Yesenia C.,"San Diego, CA",671,235,106,3.0,9/25/2012,"BJ's is a BREWHOUSE its suppose to be loud and have lots of TV's its not suppose to be quiet and peaceful and not really made for kids. Bj's is a loud, fun exciting place to be!!! I went on a Monday night and the service was good, food was good. I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better review  but I think it's because people want it to be a quiet boring place!!! I  would definitely will be coming back!!! Try the avacado egg rolls they are so good!!"
Christina R.,"Sacramento, CA",14,14,6,1.0,4/1/2013,"I literally created my Yelp account today because I felt that I needed to say something about how horrible the service at this restaurant is.  I'm a fan of BJ's, and have never had a bad experience at their other locations, but this was HORRIBLE.  We walked in, weren't acknowledged by the hostess, and had to greet HER.  She shortly told us that the bar was open seating and handed us menus without another word.  We sat down and waited 10 minutes for the server to take our order.  The place was empty, maybe four or five tables in the entire restaurant, I can't fathom why it took so long.  After ordering our food, it came out 30 minutes later and was incorrect.  We asked specifically for bone-in wings, and were given boneless.  We told the server and she said that the kitchen mis-read her slip.  Whatever, it happens.  20 minutes later, our wings come out, but to the WRONG table.  My boyfriend then watches the other patrons poke, yes POKE our food and examine it.  He tells me this and I just tell him that they must have ordered wings also.  Nope.  The server brings those very same poked wings to our table.  My bf explains that he watched another table just poke those, and she says that they just took a celery stick off of the plate and moved on.  To defend other guests touching our food... I mean really?  We waited 50 minutes for these stupid wings.   When the check finally comes (again, after a long wait time) the wings are on there twice.  We notified the now different server of the error and she had to wait for the managers to stop chatting by the host's podium for 5 minutes before she could even tell him about the error.  At no point were we offered any comps for our frustration or for their shitty service and mistakes.  I reluctantly still tipped because I used to work as a server and know that it sucks, but really nothing excuses such a horrible experience."
Stephen S.,"Petaluma, CA",1,9,,1.0,1/8/2013,"The Service: No greeting from the hostess, just how many? Handed menus and told to seat ourselves. Our waitress (?) barely a greeting, started off nice enough, the FIRST time I asked for anything extra, she became completely offended and rude, all I wanted was extra lemon for my terrible ice tea. She maintained her cold attitude until the end. Also as an observation all the staff were pretty vacant, just kind of wandering from table to table, there were managers, I think, but they never left front of house, ever to check on ANYTHING. There was no spirit of service, no apparent want to even be there. The Food: We ordered half salads and the flat bread pizza type stuff. The flat breads were greasy and burnt to the point where i could not tell the difference between my steak pieces and the mushrooms, mine was ""The black and blue,"" Way heavy on the black, burnt and formless pieces of it, barely any blue cheese, not even enough to have some for every slice.  The topper was the salad, more then half the lettuce was slimy and starting to rot, on both salads. The waitress, with barely an apology offered to have them remade, i asked if it would be from the same lettuce, she said ""of course"" I don't think she understood the irony of the situation, we asked for fries as a replacement since they had no other healthy alternatives...the whole situation was a huge let down. Also as a side note, the music was terribly loud and grinding for a Tuesday lunch shift, the decor is dark and dirty.  It appears the main bulk of the budget for design went into the bar area. Which glows like a gem in the middle of the mud puddle...to bad i don't drink.  Another thing, our waitress only had four tables counting us, yet she couldnt be bothered to deliver our food herself, she had someone else do it so she could keep just standing where she was not doing anything. Guess thats also why we never got silverware even after our food that clearly needed it arrived, i had to get it from another table, thats one of the worst things that can happen."
Shane S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,8,,1.0,1/11/2015,"So I ordered take out and when I arrived to pick it up I stood at the Pick Up desk for about 3 minutes before one, of many, people behind the desk even acknowledged me. They saw me, made eye contact, and said nothing. Food was widely mediocre and it was almost 20 minutes late from the pick up time. After I got a half assed ""sorry for the wait"". I'm the most understanding person this was a very poor experience"
Johnny X.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,13,,2.0,7/17/2014,"I disregarded other reviews saying they messed up their orders and got my order messed up.  Everything is super greasy and takes forever to come out, and of you're not racking up a big bar tab the servers don't have time for your regular food order.  Total waste."
Jerome W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",38,28,6,2.0,9/21/2012,"I've been to BJ's 4 times.  None of which were very good. The food is absolute bottom of the barrel, mega-chain food. The service is,...alright. The beer is average.  The ""hand-crafted sodas"" are really good, but is that worthy of a visit here? Let's not forget the TV's! Good lord, they're everywhere.  So if you wanna sit in a huge mess hall, drink soda, and watch the game, BJ's....is still a crappy option.  There are much better restaurants in town for the money you'd spend here."
Aria D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",1,31,,1.0,3/31/2013,"Service sucked. Me and my brother walked in. We sat down. Bartender looked straight at us without a ""Be right there with you"", and looked at us like a deer in the head lights. We sat there for approximately 5-10 minutes without service or menu's. We walked right out. I have been to numerous BJ's throughout California. This one sucks the most."
Kira W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",90,104,28,3.0,11/11/2012,"We went at lunch, so it was quieter than for some of the reviewers. The server was nice and had the same demeanor as any other chain restaurant server. My burger was overcooked. Beer wasn't anything special."
Leslie K.,"Ukiah, CA",0,17,4,3.0,8/12/2015,This was my first you me eating here and it was ok. I've avoided it before because the line for dinner is very long and it's crowded: it reminds me of a nice Applebee's. The staff is very friendly. The wait to get in was maybe 5 min. for lunch. I got the chicken mango salad which tasted great except that it came without chicken; the waiter was polite and got it in the side fairly quickly after I brought it up. The wait time overall wasn't too bad if you compare it to other family friendly sit-down restaurants; don't expect to be in and out quick though. Our total time was 1hr.
Dre C.,"San Rafael, CA",0,125,,1.0,8/21/2012,Went for happy hour.  Hostess didn't know what exactly it covered nor the special drinks for the day. Wanted to save calories so ordered the light Mojito.  So horrible had to send it back.  Ordered calamari--dry and nothing special--and shrimp lettuce wraps--HORRIBLE again.   Too loud and the vibe is just so mall.  :-(
Alexandra S.,"Folsom, CA",494,126,123,2.0,7/18/2014,"We have had mixed luck here at this BJ's. The first time we went here, we had HORRIBLE service. So bad that I would have probably given them only one star. Waitress got confused when we ordered (and there were only 4 of us there...not a big group!), she couldn't figure out how to substitute things. She was VERY slow...took us almost 20 minutes to even get drinks after ordering them (and none of them were fancy...it was mostly just iced tea). And took almost 45 minutes(after ordering...which since our waitress was slow, wasn't until a while after we were seated) to get our food. And I should mention that it wasn't busy in there at all. We would look around and literally wouldn't see our waitress around anywhere...for long periods of time. We didn't get drink refills or water...we asked her once, and she said ""sure thing"" and then didn't come back. Our food was cold when we got it. They messed up one of our orders too. We didn't ask to get anything fixed, because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes to get our food...we were starving!! We also changed our mind about dessert...didn't want to have to try and find our waitress, and then wait. We almost asked to speak to the manager, but decided we just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible, since we'd all ready spent wayyyy too much time there. Months and months later, my boyfriend and I decided to give this BJ's another try, since we do like the food their chain serves. We had a much better experience. That is why I raised the review up to 2 stars. Our hostess and our waitress were both very friendly. They only messed up one small thing on our order...which wasn't bad because since they changed the menu, we both substituted a couple of things. They were quick. The drink I ordered was delicious! The side salads were fresh. And the price isn't too bad. I do wish they had some foods with not quite so high calorie counts...if you're on a diet, don't go here, they list the calories for each menu item....and they are all pretty high in calories in my opinion!  Don't get me wrong, I do like the food BJ's serves, and the atmosphere of their restaurants. This one though is my least favorite of any of the BJ's I have been to. Although since it is the closest one to us, we most likely will go back at some point."
Helen H.,"Sacramento, CA",386,1335,3155,2.0,7/9/2013,"My friends and I had time to kill, so we decided to go to BJ's. We chose to sit outside, big mistake. First off, they need screens to block the sun because I was burning. Another reason is because the seating area was dirty. We placed the napkins on our seats before sitting down. The biggest reason was because there was an unpleasant smell coming from the sewers or something. Food and service was ok, nothing spectacular."
Jodie J.,"Petaluma, CA",0,4,1,5.0,7/6/2014,"My husband and I went to BJ's last Friday night for the first time and had the best meal,  service was fast,  correct and we had a wonderful waitress named Lauren. She was new but you would have never known that,  she knelt down to explain stuff to us. She was very personable.  I would recommend this place and that waitress to anyone.  KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK LAUREN!!!! More places need waitresses like her. ."
Emmanuel G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,2,1.0,5/14/2014,"The service here is horrendous!! I don't know if they were discriminating us because we are gay, or what... But we literally waited 10 minutes after we were seated before someone came to check on us. Also note that 2 other hetero-couples were seated after us and they ordered their stuff before anyone came to our table. The food was edible but not anything to be proud of. Too bad you can't give zero stars. Oh and I forgot to mention that we had to ask for everything.... Silver wear, salt, pepper, straws for the drinks, etc... Aside from the cruddy food and service experience, I will say that its a good place to people watch."
Ray L.,"Sebastopol, CA",28,426,54,1.0,12/23/2012,Being a beer snob I can say their beer isn't the worst in Sonoma County. That goes to two places down town for sure. But okay is about the best I can give it. The noise level was intense for a place maybe half full. And the food was not good. I can steer you to many dive places with food ten times better. My pizza had okay topping but the crust was burnt. We had to ask for napkins after the food hit the table. I usually try to give a place at least two try's before I wipe it from my list. This place will not get a second chance. Now there is two places in Coddingtown that suck. Truely don't waste you time. Or money which they will take quite abit of for very little.
