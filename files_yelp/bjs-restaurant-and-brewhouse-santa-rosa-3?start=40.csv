Courtney K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,4.0,11/18/2017,Great drinks/beers. Healthy delicious food options. Very good service.  Alec in take out is awesome and would make a fantastic server.
M R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/26/2017,"I stayed away from BJ's for several years, hoping they'd improve.  They haven't, they've actually gotten worse.   Dirty silverware, cold and under-cooked food, lousy service.  I got my appetizer which was blazing hot, then 5 minutes later they bring the main course.  I'm still eating the appetizer while my main course gets cold.  What?!  You guys should have learned how to time your service so customers get their food at appropriate times years ago.   I'd expect this from a new restaurant, not a regional (national?) chain.   I'm never going back."
Jeff Y.,"Fremont, CA",141,1,,1.0,5/28/2017,"This place ia too slow, lazy bunch of cooker! How you overcook a ribeye? My dad had to suffer waiting half an hour and baked potato still not out come on and the second time they recooked it it tasted raw. What a shame! disappointment! Soup too overpowering!  This place get a Negative 5 star and a big F! The sad part is half the place is empty too and it dinner! You dare charging us double just because of a freaking overcooked ribeye? No one should come here PERIOD!!!"
Anthony G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/29/2017,The service was slow and the southern fried chicken sandwich was not very good. It was dry and looked like our food was under a lamp for awhile.
Lisa H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",20,6,3,5.0,10/29/2017,"I placed a take out order today for curbside pickup. I was greeted by a sweet young gentlemen named Alec. Alec was prompt, informative, proficient, and kind. My order came out faster than I expected. Piping hot and perfect. This was my second visit to this location and I highly recommend it. Great staff, fast service and great food."
Mara C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/3/2017,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with BJ's  Customer Service. This past week and a half I've had two awful experiences with BJ's at the Coddingtown Mall, hence the 1 star. Two Fridays ago, my boyfriend and I went into the bar around 6:00pm. We each got a beer and ordered two appetizers--the lettuce wraps and chicken wings. The bar/restaurant was not busy with plenty of open tables. We waited 45 minutes for two appetizers... The server did not apologize or offer any kind of comp. I have worked in the restaurant industry and decided not to complain. The food came out warm and was yummy. The following Wednesday my company ordered BJ's catering for a meeting of 20 people. We had never used BJ's catering and decided to give it a whirl. When I went to pick it up, they had no record of our order. I waited for 40 minutes, then raced back to the office in order to set up lunch. When I opened the catered dishes, the amount of food was ridiculous for the price. For instance take the Barbacoa Chicken--half pan which is $45 and supposed to serve 5-10 people. There were TWO chicken breasts! $45 for 2 chicken breasts?? WTF?! I called and spoke to the GM. I told him about our experience and he apologized--but that was it. Legitimately, you pay $45 for 2 chicken breasts. WOW.  We are a large company and have meals catered all the time. This could have been a great opportunity for BJ's to be one or our go to restaurants. Never again."
Gene I.,"Calistoga, CA",24,13,1,5.0,11/5/2017,Excellent again! I eat here occasionally and don't understand the 2.5 rating. I have never had a bad experience good food and good service!
Hector O.,"Roseville, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/3/2017,"So I went with a good size group and the service was great but the food was horrible. I ordered the rib eye rare with mash potatoes fully loaded and broccoli. When it finally arrived I had a baked potato, broccoli and my steak. In my thoughts no big deal it's a potato but as soon as I cut my rib eye I was very disappointed, WELL DONE!!!!!! So the only thing on my plate that was right was my broccoli. I did not eat my rib eye at all, very disappointed. Unfortunately we had big group the waitress did her best but not once did anyone ask me how my food was. It should raise a flag when a full rib eye steak does not get eaten. How does RARE turn to WELL DONE. Fortunately for me I will never go back to this location. ******Update, as soon as I posted this review, the General Manager for the restaurant reached and out and made the experience right, great way to show the customer focus, thank you Pedro for that and just for the thoughts 5 stars. Thank you."
Robin N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/15/2017,"Ordered a Black and Bleu burger online, under toppings I deselected tomato and added onion straws. I received a cheeseburger with grilled onions (which isn't even in the recipe), no bacon (a main component), a pound of onion strings and no side of fries. When my boyfriend called to let them know, the manager on shift argued with him and said he could have some fries if he was close. Uh, no. It took another 5 minutes before he said he'd offer a refund - but until we see it post, I suspect he doesn't plan on actually issuing it. I will never be back which is too bad. I used to enjoy dining on the patio. Update: spoke to the regional manager who apologized and offered reasonable compensation. Very professionally handled at the corporate level."
Christine W.,"Sacramento, CA",59,7,1,1.0,9/13/2017,"I tried this location twice and I will never go back. The food is just not good at all. I tried one of their burgers, they got my side wrong and by the time they brought the correct side out to me, I was done. The next time it was the ribs and they were dry and not tasty at all. Both times my companions were also not happy with their selection. And even though it was there screw up on the menu item I didn't receive a discount and it didn't seem to matter that they screwed up. My over all experience with service and staff and food was just the worst. I have eaten at other BJs before and I'm shocked and disappointed at what they have done here at this location. It's turned me off from going back to any location now."
Bernie D.,"Stockton, CA",34,1,1,5.0,10/15/2017,Thank You Bj's... for your hospitality. What more can I say.  Great food complimented by great service. The staff here is awesome. They made feel like a part of their family. We can't thank this restaurant enough... and how well ur staff accommodated all the first responders that helped with the Fire relief efforts... Thank u!!! Thank u!!! Thank u!!!
Never B.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,2,1,1.0,5/31/2017,Second time my burger was undercooked. Took a small bite and noticed. Why do they send out underdone food? They simply don't care. This place is 2 and a half stars for a reason. Avoid at all costs.
Cindy C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,15,,1.0,4/30/2017,"If you're going to use a delivery service, at least give a sh*t about your customers who use it. I waited for more than two hours for food that arrived cold. The one dish that wasn't supposed to be hot was ... awful. It was supposed to be tuna poke. There was no seasoning to it. Flavorless.  I totally get all the low ratings here. I can't even blame Food To You delivery for the delay; half these reviews talk about how long the food takes ... and that it comes out cold. I will absolutely tell anyone thinking of going here to skip it."
Angelique S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",13,2,,1.0,9/3/2017,"Our family has been here many times, the service just gets worse and worse. Tonight the appetizer was cold and our drink refills kept getting forgotten.  The waiter was walking around apologizing to other diners. After 45 minutes of not even ordering our entree I spoke with the management and left. Last time we were there we waited 40 minutes for our entrees and our salads came out just after the entrees. The food is usually good when it comes and the order is correct. We are greatly disappointed by this restaurant and we will not be coming back."
Spencer C.,"Petaluma, CA",3,27,4,2.0,12/13/2017,"We went here last night for a birthday dinner with party of nine. They were very put out by this. Took over an hour for first food to hit the table. By the time dinner and dessert was done we were there over 2 1/2 hours. With one server and the kitchen about a mile away, the first person in our group was done eating by the time the ninth received their food. They were very understaffed. The staff they did have seemed really stressed out. Food was okay, not great. Wife's salad had little to no dressing. Asking server for more of anything seemed like we were putting him out if we could find him. Overall corporate America at its best."
Daisy A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",39,3,3,1.0,10/1/2017,"My experience at this establishment was terrible. My friends ordered food at the same time I did and they were served and a half an hour later and still no food. They served their ""cooked"" vegetables raw and the wait staff is never anywhere to be seen. One manager was seen just sitting and eating at one of the bar tables and I'd have to say it's one of the worst places to eat. I will not be going back."
Armando C.,"Sebastopol, CA",104,1,2,1.0,9/1/2017,I don't really do this review crap but for this particular spot I had to make an exception this was about my third time coming to BJ's and let me tell you I will never be back you can mark my words I went in with my girlfriend after getting off work around 839-ish we got there and we're seated fairly quickly took our drink orders and appetizers we ordered the calamari which wasn't the best but it was decent. For dinner I ordered the sirloin steak with a side which was a big potato and some asparagus now let me tell you I had a lot of steaks in my life for May variety of places a lot and let me tell you people this by far that this was by far the most horrible looking horrible tasting steak I have ever had in my life it was not only smaller than the baked potato but it was also very burnt on top and I asked for medium well and got a very cooked and very very dry I'm so sad about this place because this place fucking sucks I will never be back thank you BJ's for showing me you really suck thank you for nothing but show me that you really suck awful place please don't bother coming it's horrible!!!!!
Derek C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",602,176,74,2.0,10/25/2016,We waited almost an hour for our food... which was delicious... they comped nothing after acknowledging they screwed up... pretty lame. I heard they had gluten free options. They had like 2.
Amanda E.,"Windsor, CA",150,24,5,1.0,5/14/2017,"I've really tried to like BJ's but today was the last straw. I've been charged for items that have never come to my table. Food has no flavor. Inattentive servers and hostesses. Have to ask for flatware and refills.  Today my son wanted to go here for Mother's Day lunch. Hostess was too busy flipping her hair and flirting with a server to acknowledge when we walked in. We were seated all the way back in the corner, which was fine other than the fact we were next to an order input station so the servers kept huddling around there. My son's burger wasn't cooked right, he didn't care. He's a teenager, he eats just about anything. I asked for no jalapenos and my burger to be ""well done""...that translated to let's put jalapenos under the patty, on top of the patty and in the guacamole. My burger was also pretty rare. May have been medium rare. Definitely not well done! I tried to eat it, I really did but I couldn't. So here I am, I've thrown up twice and my stomach still hurts. Happy Freaking Mother's Day. The one star is for the pazookies and the Mother's Day wine charm they gave me."
