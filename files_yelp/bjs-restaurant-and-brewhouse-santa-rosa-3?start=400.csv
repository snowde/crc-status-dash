Dennis F.,"Chicago, IL",274,55,10,4.0,10/12/2014,My family stopped here on our way to their place in Ukiah. Great Burgers!!
Karen M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/6/2015,"Came here AGAIN for my sisters graduation lunch ( her choice not mine ). They lost our reservation for 10, and even though the place was dead on a Saturday afternoon, they seemed really flustered with our party size. When we were seated our waitress told us that if we wanted to order brunch, we had to do it now or ""the kitchen will yell at her!"" Umm, I'm sorry, since when is it our jobs as paying customers to accommodate the kitchen??? Then everyone got their food except for one of my sisters friends. When we were all finished eating her pizza finally came, and it was COLD! when she asked our waitress to fix it, the waitress asked ""well what do you mean, how did you want it to be?"" I am a server myself, and my boyfriend is a cook so I do have an understanding of how mistakes can happen, but I had a REALLY hard time biting my tongue!! When the Deseret arrived, so did the pizza finally. This place is only good for an afternoon drink. And even then save your money! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
Jack B.,"Petaluma, CA",12,126,,4.0,10/9/2014,I had a lunch special with pasta and salad. It was delicious. My friend had the fish tacos which he said were really good. I also had a black cherry soda and a strawberry lemonade. So good. I will be back for sure.
Cece A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/18/2015,"This is one of my all time favorite places to eat! My boyfriend and I love to watch the Giants games here and I have yet to find somewhere that makes a better Bloody Mary. Great food, always great service and great atmosphere!"
Gerald W.,"Burbank, CA",21,157,23,4.0,10/5/2014,Typical Bj's with the thermostat set to 50 degrees...Brrrrrr
Jo N.,"Sonoma County, CA",37,424,69,4.0,7/25/2012,"We got there early (I recommend) for lunch and sat outside.  We had an assortment of  apps.  We really liked the watermelon and feta salad, and the chicken lettuce wraps the best.  The menu is enormous, truly, too large.  ANYONE can find something to eat here even if you have allergies or dietary restrictions."
Amelia E.,"Rohnert Park, CA",170,129,18,4.0,7/2/2014,"The service is a hit or miss. The food is really good. Santa Fe rolls are so good, I wish I could have them 24/7! Also, they have chocolate chip cookies with ice cream covered in Carmel or chocolate sauce which is mouth watering. Also, endless pickles.?! I'm in heaven!"
Dean T.,"Roseburg, OR",22,81,6,3.0,4/28/2013,"I was first exposed to BJ Brewhouse in Cupertino down the street from DeAnza College. When I lived out there I used to go to this place all the time. Their food is good, the service was fast, and the beers are awesome. So  naturally when I heard BJ was opening a location here in Santa Rosa I was thrilled. BJ Brew House in Coddingtown is a far cry from my normal positive experience. Food quality remains consistent, but if you were a wine grape, you would die on the vine waiting for you food cause it took forever. (Both times, over 60 minutes) Another observation I made pertained to the cooks who began walking through the dinning area. I couldn't help but notice all the gang tattoos which was more than discerning. You would think their hiring practices would be better than a place like KFC; so seeing that was a surprise."
Lindy B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",88,192,104,2.0,6/12/2012,"If you want Denny's on steroids, if you want mediocre food at premium prices...then this is the place for you!  If you want to try a bunch of different beers, then this also is the place for you.  If you don't want to have to wade through 5 pages of beers, then this is not the place for you.   My husband and I went here for lunch the other day.  So, the appetizer Thai Lettuce Wraps ($10.50) were tasty.  4 wraps, in butter leaf lettuce, that fell apart.  So not really wraps.  Hubby had Mini Vegetarian Pizza ($10.25) mini.  Peppers and mushrooms. I had the Thai Mango and Avo Salad $10.95); don't let the picture on the menu fool you...where's the chicken?  Where's the mango?  Where's the lettuce?  IDK.  Not on my plate.  I mean, it's suppose to be ""lighter"" fare, but, to be fair, lettuce doesn't add much by way of calories, and sure would have made the pathetic plate I was served look more ""filling"".   AND it was LOUD! LindySez: If I'm paying almost $11.00 for a salad...well, there's a lot more places I can do that, and get something in return.  Not thinking I'm going back to BJ's...nope, not at all..."
Brittany P.,"Petaluma, CA",52,2,,1.0,5/15/2014,My experience was horrible and I'll refuse to ever come back! The wait staff were rude and unprofessional kept my husband and I waiting 20 mins before the waiter came to order our drinks and meal. Waited an additional 35 mins for the food to arrive at the table. We ordered the calamari which was covered in rancid oil. At that point we asked to speak to the manager who can put and looked at our food an removed it off bill. We left hungry and unhappy!
Issy D.,"Sacramento, CA",771,562,70,3.0,7/16/2012,"I came here the other day with my boyfriend curious to see what Bj's was all about. My first impression was good. It's fast paced in there and the atmosphere feels like you are somewhere that isn't santa rosa. It's not that it is fancy but its feels lively in there.  We sat down after a small wait after being handed those annoying pagers that beep and turn bright red.....anyways.... The menu is HUGE. You can seriously can get any type of food you want here which always makes me it assume it can't be fresh. Theres no way a kitchen can prepare everything  from pizzas, burgers, salads, french, italian....haha I can continue.  We started off with the avocado cream cheese won tons. Yum! Those were seriously so good. A little bit of spice and a ton of cream cheese made for a delicous way to start off dinner. My boyfriend also loved the beer menu. It has pairings and a meter from light to dark. He choose the darkest beer, which I thought I would hate, but was actually quite tasty. For dinner he got a pasta dish and I got a cobb salad. I had always thought a cobb salad is something no one can ruin. I mean, hunks of chicken and avocado?? How can anyone do wrong?! Well I guess BJ's can. The lettuce was brown and wilted. The chicken was diced like it had been from a salad barr at Round Table or Something. The lettuce to toppings ratio was so off that I thought lettuce was possibly a topping and dressing was the main course. Pretty dissapointing. Our waiter was super funny and nice and everyone else around me seemed to be having a great time. I still left with a smile on my face, but will not come back unless its for desserts and drinks or maybe appetizers and drinks"
John w.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,19,,2.0,6/3/2012,"Heard a lot of good things about BJs and so when they came to town excited to try... disspointed now that I have tried. I guess they are still cutting their teeth as things are very disorganized there... I went with a friend who had a bad experience close to opening night but was promised if she tries again it will be better. They recognize her on the way in and apologize for poor service last time so this is a good start, we will surely gett good service to make up for it. Nope. Right off the bat we are told one girl will be our server (forget name now) and immediately a girl with a different name shows up saying she will be our server.  Takes our drink order and a few minutes later a different girl shows up with our drinks and says she will be our server...  I don't get how you screw this up... this is what sections are for... it's not horrible to be sure but really part of the dining experience is making a relationship with your server and if you are going to switch out servers mid service at all the customer should be alerted and explained to about why. Anyway first girl comes back and takes our food order.  We have two tomato mozarella salads (I love buffalo mozarella and at $4 a pop!) I get the chicken pesto flatbread pizza, another person gets the California Chicken and the last just has an order of calimari for an entre.  Server askss if we want the calimari with the starters so he doesn't have to sit there while we both have food and we say yes in fact fire it as fast as they can since we would like to be out done and out in less than an hour -  this should be a resaonable thing for a 2PM seating after the lunch rush. The girl comes by with 3 tomato salads and leaves us one... our server sees this and directs her back so the second shows up a minute later... continues the tone for how the service is here... disoriented. No calimari. We finish our salads - which are tasy however they are not heirloom tomatos (I don't think it says they are so this isn't a ding, just a note) and it's a bit salty... I like salt as much as the next guy but tihs is apparently a trend with their food. We wait for about 10 minutes and our server passes by notices the missing calimari and rushes to the kitchen, brings it out a few minutes later with an apology.  Worst calimari I have had a in a long time.  It's visibly oily and soggy - I taste a piece and it's barely warm, there is no taste of calimari just oil and it's like eating wet cardboard.  The one dish that needed salt and has none. This dish is a total failure in my book. Then the server comes to tell us there is a delay in our entres - could she offer us some soup to make up.  We are in a hurry so this is bad news but say fine, I like the sound of a tomato bisque and she has the chicken noodle. 1 minute later her sandwich comes out... odd... the runner drops it off and reads ""California chicken"" off his kitchen ticket looks at the sandwich and immediately says ""oh I mean chicken club!"".   It's got bacon on it.  She doesn't eat pork and specifically chose the Califronia because it does not have bacon. We explain this to the server and she apologizes and offers a refire of the correct order.  We op to just pick the bacon off and eat it as is.  It's very passable if a bit salty. Our soups come out and my tomato bisque is a frothy salt bucket of a soup.  I don't even finish it and it's not a big cup. The chicken noodle is similarly unremarkable and salty. Finally after the sandwich is almost finished my pizza comes out.  Looks quite tasty.   Is not. There are about 6 tiny cubes of ""chicken"" on it which have the texture and flavor of frozen grocery store pizza chicken.  The ""Pesto"" is visiually accurate but is just slaty.  No real taste basily goodness.  In fact the whole thing is basically a nicely cooked grocery store frozen pizza. Unimpressive. The server apologizes for the bad service again and offers us a pizookie for free, we say no and she pushes again and again to give us soething free so finally we take a few scoops of ice cream.   The ice cream is good.  Ambiance is nice, I am very impressed (as a nerdy guy) by the 100+inch LCD TV over the bar and it's got a nice upscale brewhouse look.   Nothing else impressed me about the experience and I won't be back."
Brook T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",122,11,13,1.0,10/12/2012,"I was unimpressed after my first BJ's experience in Santa Rosa, but went back when a friend asked, and this time was even less impressed. The service is terrible. We were 3 of 9 people sitting in the bar area. It took almost 10 minutes to order our drinks, then another 15 to get 3 beers. There were quite a few people working there, but no one seemed to be doing anything, with the exception of the very slow moving bartender.  This experience does not add to up any type of Happy Hour experience I want to have again. Too bad, when I used to go to the one up in Portland I had a great experience."
G L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,7,18,2.0,8/20/2013,Been here twice its Crowded all the time! Decent food for a chain. (A small step above Applebee's) good beers on tap Burger was.. Ok. Terrible service our waiter didn't even bring us silver or napkins.
Becky A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,6,,5.0,4/6/2015,"Went to BJ's for lunch today and had the BEST waiter in the world!! His name is Richard P. He was so friendly, and professional. We orderd our drinks and food, and he brought everything we needed right away, and always with a nice friendly smile. There was a problem with our pizza, not Richards fault, and the manager came over and paid for our food, for their mistake. That was the bonus, because our waiter  was fabulous!!"
Elizabeth Z.,"Santa Rosa, CA",118,11,,5.0,5/15/2012,"Okay, I could rant for days about how amazing my experience was, but I will give you the short of the long. This was my first time ever dining at a BJ's. The architecture inside and out is just fabulous. The whole vibe is very comfortable. The staff was courteous and most were actually knowledgeable of the food. Not bad having just opened. Although, I feel they could have been a little more laid back, it's not completely fine dining. We started with BJ's Beginnings appetizer plate. Mozzarella sticks, two rolls, and spinach artichoke dip, along with three different sauces. EVERYTHING on that plate blew my mind. Even something as simple as the dip. My caesar salad tasted the most fresh compared to any salad I've had recently. My entree was the lunch portion fettuccine alfredo. Considering the menu is gigantic, I decided on my favorite food, so I am very picky when it comes to this dish. That said, it wasn't the best I've ever had, but still tasted great, and left my stomach with a 'happy full' feeling. My buddies had a calzone and the angus pot roast sandwich. I'm assuming they were both delicious, because the majority of the meal was spent moaning and saying ""oh my god, this is so gooooood"". Finally, I just had to try a dessert on my first visit. I got the cookies and cream Pizookie. I swear this was crafted by gods. I'm a sucker for rich chocolate sweets, and oh my, this just topped off the five star rating. Aside from the restaurant just opening, I have nothing bad to say about this place. They made me an extremely happy gal. YOU MUST GO TRY FOR YOURSELF!"
Kiani m.,"Santa Rosa, CA",78,24,,5.0,4/7/2014,"Our waiter Scott was great but i felt bad, you could tell he was understaffed. Regardless he did a really good job of making sure we got everything we needed. My only suggestion would be to maybe add one more person to help lighten the work load a little so that things dont take as long."
Betsy A.,"Marin County, CA",12,35,11,5.0,10/20/2014,"We had a couple of positive experiences here -- first, a stack of pizzas for the Tour de Fuzz bike ride (to go order) -- and pizzas were very nice and really hit the spot. About 70 of us eating it, and it was terrific (not just me, but everyone said so)! I was a bit apprehensive about going to the restaurant after seeing some iffy reviews, but I went there with a couple of young kids and we had a great time -- good service, excellent pizza, and we all shared a 'pizookie' for dessert which was also excellent."
Marty P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",12,72,122,3.0,6/13/2012,"not a place to take your wife for birthday dinner with kids..although my youngest finished his food , ( chicken tenders) but he will eat ANYTHING. My 10 yr olds grilled cheese was warm to room temp.   We split the Mediterranean Pizza, (cold) all I could taste was the feta cheese and the peppers on a room temp focaccia style bread ( not a deep pan pizza as it is on the menu)  Good beer selection $5.50 to $7.50 ...Nothing even close to Russian River Brewery which is my favorite in Santa Rosa and much better priced  The place was packed and loud to be expected   The kids LOVED the house brewed root beer with free refills I'd go back for beer and apps for lunch if I was stuck in the area... overpriced dinner menu. It's just a glorified Lyons, Dennys and Ihop menu and add $40.00 to the check."
Jen B.,"Occidental, CA",0,41,13,1.0,6/4/2012,"The food alone deserves one star. They've been open about a month. But I think the food is not going to improve- it's just low quality. The food was literally just like Burger King or McDonalds, but with alcohol and a lot more expensive. I ordered ""fried chicken"". It was ONE ""chicken tender"" type piece that tasted just like gross fast food on top of mashed potatoes that had to be at least 50% dairy and may have been from a powder mix. I cannot believe they had the nerve to send out so little food as an entree, but I was glad after I tasted it. My husband ordered a jalapeno burger which came cold. He said we should have gone to In and Out because those taste much better- and he doesn't even like fast food. The beer had no flavor. The cocktails have no prices on the menu. I ordered a peach cocktail that was too sweet and I felt no alcohol effect. I just cannot tell you how bad the food was. We live in Sonoma County, there is no excuse for this. As a chain I'm sure they have a formula for the food that works Nebraska and Ohio.  As a new restaurant it is understandable that there were some other issues too. There was a lot of people there at 2 in the afternoon, but some empty tables (the place is huge), but they still had five parties waiting to be seated. There was no toilet paper in the women's restroom. As I stated, there were items on the menu with no prices. When serving and clearing the couple at the table next to ours, our waitress put their dirty plates and her tray down on OUR table, while we were sitting right there. Seriously, I couldn't make this up. Any good reviews here have got to be plants. I suppose you may like this place if you are from out of state and have always wanted to go somewhere you can eat fast/frozen food, drink bland alcohol and watch TV in public."
