Trisha L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",9,29,,1.0,11/12/2014,"Most of the time I've been there, I've gotten okay food. Not horrible but not omg- yum. But always a long wait. Last time I went I got sick from their food. I know it was here, because that's all I had eaten that day. Really really don't trust to eat here now."
Lynn M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",6,25,1,4.0,7/30/2014,"Changing my mind. The food is actually pretty good. If I don't order past the beer menu, it's not too expensive. This is now my go-to place for lunch when I don't want to have to think. Staff friendly, but not always competent. Clean. Previous comment about darkness was more my cataracts than the decor."
Tina K.,"Acampo, CA",47,5,,1.0,8/27/2013,Restaurant charged my account more than what the tab was with the tip. When I called them on it they said I made the mistake but would credit me back the difference. I knew he was wrong because I knew how much I had to spend. Anyway he did not credit me he recharged me. My account is overdrawn and my $30 meal has now cost me over $100. I called again and got the General manager who said corporate is taking care of it. Corporate has done nothing and the General Manager does not call me back. I have to call them. I think they were caught in some kind of tipping scam and dont want to make a customer happy. Will never go back to this BJ's again.
Vanessa L.,"McKinleyville, CA",21,39,8,4.0,5/5/2013,"I had such fun at this place!  Arrived after 10 pm, and was informed that it was happy hour!  we got a small anchovy and olive pizza, a shrimp lettucy taco appetizer and 3 beers for 32 bucks.  It was a fab way to spend a thursday night.  I'll definitely go back any time I head through santa rosa!!! Also, the mere sight of a rainbow array of brews is enough to bring a smile to this girl's face.    Also, they have a mondo tv, which i liked if only for the pretty colors. We  had great service too.  We sat at the bar and were super relaxed and happy."
Jake L.,"Petaluma, CA",3,46,33,1.0,9/4/2012,"I gave them a chance a I use to be a fan when living in so cal, but of course they disappoint after the grand opening. Our calamari came out cold as if it was a rejected order waiting for someone else. The servers took a while to come around to take our order, forgot our drinks, last but not least the entree took a while and was mediocre."
Eli L.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",3,10,4,1.0,6/26/2014,"My first experience at BJ's was during the initial month of opening and it was not pleasant. We ended up being a test table for staff training. He was really nervous with lackluster direction from the trainer and I did not base my rating on the trainee, everyone has to start somewhere. Here is the kicker, most of the food was not expedited properly with random plate arrivals and cold food, so management issues in the kitchen were the real issue. I chalked this up to first month bugs.  Unfortunately, even after waiting months and trying again, same results. Inattentive servers, long wait times, and someone at the table had cold fries, no drink, or stranded without food. Food always seemed like Applebee's microwaved food with a larger price tag. My roommate also had a horrible experience where the waiter botched their order and then argued that they never ordered items they were waiting for. Bottom line, The only thing I like at BJ's is the beer/bar. I would rather drive to Corte Madera for Cheesecake Factory."
Peter M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",8,14,,2.0,7/2/2012,"It's OK.  Kind of like a big Applebee's with many many TV's and a larger, but similar menu, with pizza added.  Negative - very, very loud.  Positive, nice to have signs of life in Coddingtown again. Food was OK, not spectacular, but not problematic either.  Service still a little spotty, with multiple appetizers delivered to my table before we even ordered. It is very loud, so be sure your server get's your order right, or you may be in for a surprise. Will I go again?  Sure.  But not blocking out any dates on my calendar to do it. I ordered the watermelon mojito, which looks spectacular on the table tent, but the fruit was not muddled, so what I got did not look anything like its picture, but still a decent drink. The kid liked the hamburger dinner he had, and liked the environment, probably more than I did. UPDATE Late October 2012. For some reason or other, we keep coming back. Our second experience was primarily entree's - a couple of jambalaya's and two orders of chicken Marsala. Neither entree looked anything like the picture.  The chicken was OK, but just OK.  The jambalaya was fair, and definitely not worth the menu price (both of my friends who ordered this said ""Well, that was a disappointment!"" Really, really loud.  I had a ""laugher"" in the booth next to ours who made it very difficult to talk without screaming.  This was, of course, on top of the already very loud noise levels already existent.    BTW, I have no problem with people going out and having a good time - that's one of the points of going out.  I think I'm just trying to suggest that the environment here is better suited for a couple a drinks, a few appetizers and a couple of laughs - then out the door.  If you're looking for a ""dining experience"", you may be disappointed. And yet - we still keep going!  Third and fourth visits were just sandwiches - which were just fine.  I like the hard ciders that are available and the kid LOVES the house-made Cream Soda.   The cocktails are the part where you'll notice your $$'s headed.  If you can avoid that, this is a much better alternative to Applebee's."
Michael S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,35,7,4.0,7/12/2014,"I really like this place.  A friend of mine insisted I try one of the BJ's in Southern California and I loved it so much.  Everything was perfect.  I came back to this restaurant here in Santa Rosa and it was pretty much identical in every aspect except for seasoning (on a burger called the Black and Blue).  The restaurant was very clean and fresh, even the bathrooms.  The kids meals serve fun little nuggets and they come with the standard coloring menu with crayons.  Drinks are on the expensive side.  All in all, I like to go whenever I can."
Jordan S.,"Kent, WA",8,118,3,4.0,2/7/2013,"The prices are right on the dishes we get. All you can eat soup and salad for $7. yes please. They lose a star for  seating time and organization. Almost every time we are in there somebody is yelling at them about how they have been waiting way longer than quoted. This happens to us as well but we are calm people so we just chill out, but it is not very professional. Beware of this if you go there!"
Dean H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",25,64,6,3.0,7/26/2015,Bjs have gotten better since they first opened when they were a complete disaster. but I still dont think there food is good enough to keep going back. especially with all the new restaurants that have opened up in coddingtown.
Alicia T.,"Lakeport, CA",5,12,15,1.0,3/10/2014,Food was cold waitress ignored us and spent whole time talking to freinds at other table. Won't go back again. Bad service bad food
Kelly M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",18,20,15,5.0,5/18/2012,"We ate at BJ's the first weekend it opened so we were prepared to wait a bit for food and seatings. The wait was about 45 mins but we called ahead so it wasnt so bad. It was a bit of a struggle to order drinks at the bar, but they were well worth it. My husband had the long island and I had the Strawberry patch. Both very good and strong! For dinner I had the balsalmic glazed chicken and my husband had the deluxe double burger. He said it was the best thing he has ate in a very long time. Mine was also delicious- chicken was cooked well and had good flavor. We also had the chips and salsa for an appetizer which was very good- salsa had a slight BBQ flavor to it which I enjoyed. Servers were very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere inside is over the top. Overall, I feel it is one of the best restaurants in Santa Rosa!"
Amanda P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,8,1,1.0,10/26/2012,"I have eaten at BJ's at a different location many times, and it was my favorite restaurant. The BJ's in Santa Rosa is AWFUL. I am not going there again.  I order a clam chowder in a bread bowl, and my boyfriend orders the Thai Salmon.  Let's start with the Salmon, his salmon had no sauce AT ALL and came with brown rice. On the menu it specifically says white rice in a Thai mango sauce. This would have been a fantastic healthy food choice if that's what he was going for, but he wasn't. When we tried to find it on the menu, it didn't even exist.......  My clam chowder came in a normal bowl, not a bread bowl. When I told the man who served our food to us, he showed me the receipt so I could see what the waitress wrote down. I don't CARE what the waitress wrote down, it's not my fault. He said it'll take a little bit because they need to put the bread in the oven, I said that's fine. When I finally get my food in a bread bowl, the bread was so charred that it was pointless to eat anyways. They messed up two meals three times. DISAPPOINTED.  We tipped, because we aren't rude, but our food sucked. Also, when we walked out of the revolving exit/entrance door, there was a bottle of windex placed on the handle and a sprayed (but not yet wiped down) window with nobody there. We had to push the Windex-y door to get out, and I thought that was unprofessional and gross. They really need to get their act together before I tell everybody to not even bother trying to eat there. Actually, but bother trying to eat there."
Erin C.,"Vallejo, CA",1,5,1,3.0,11/20/2014,"The food is what you'd expect from a chain restaurant like this - some things are pretty excellent, some are mediocre at best.  The service can be hit or miss.  My only complaint recently is regarding a new dish on their menu.  They ""deep dish lasagna"" is nothing more than three LARGE frozen raviolis stacked with sauce and cheese.  While I like ravioli, it's not the same...good place to go for a group as there is something for everyone."
Tina F.,"Sebastopol, CA",12,97,18,1.0,12/23/2012,"Went there for lunch. The place was very noisy and it was about half full. It was raining outside and when walking to our table, I noticed the floor were rather slick. I was wearing tennis shoes and still slid a bit. Our table did not have napkins or silverware and we were not asked if we wanted water. The beer was ok. I ordered the the brewhouse blond shrimp that was supposed to be ""lightly fried"" but was very over fried. My boyfriend's pizza was burnt on the bottom. We had to asked for napkins and silverware after getting our order. Our meal was $53, rather spendy for lunch. Don't see us going there again."
Samantha S.,"Rohnert Park, CA",8,1,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Went there tonight, sat at the table for over an hour to have no food arrive, barely got our drinks, waitress apologized, still no food, manager comes out and apologizes, still no food or refills, call them out and say we are leaving, nothing compared, not worth the $21 and never coming back. Shitty service, awful managers, sub par food."
Naomi H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,10,,2.0,11/5/2014,"Best thing is the Great Beer Selection.  Wait staff was very good.  HOWEVER, the food & wait time is very poor.  I had one good meal out of 3.  Good salmon, overcooked pork chop & the WORST hamburger with over a 30 minute wait at 2PM on a Sunday.  My friend & I kept waiting & the waiter kept apologizing & when our burgers came both were so over cooked & terrible.  Wedge fries were good. So we spoke to the manager & he did not charge us for the long waited on overcooked burgers.  Said he had enough cooks so no excuse. Better burger at Jack in the Box - seriously. I had the same experience at the one in Marin County. Ridiculous wait with other people leaving it took so long.  Food was average.  For a chain they do not have it together as Denny's has better food.  In Marin go to the Cheesecake Factory who knows how to do a big restaurant with good food & service."
Diana M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",104,45,43,3.0,5/16/2012,"We ended up eating there this evening. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was pretty great. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza, and it I'd give it a high six (out of 10), and my guy ordered the Maui glazed pork chop that he rated a four. He really enjoyed the environment though, as well as the homemade root-bear, so we would probably go again.  Also, our first Server was pretty spazzy. Really, REALLY pushy and seemed to be unaware that they just opened, have a ginormous menu and that it would probably take more than 2 minutes for us to know what we wanted to order. Super annoying. Literally asked us if we knew what we wanted SIX times in less than five minutes! Luckily, she was relieved by another Server, who was much more on the ball. Amendment: My guy thought he was rating 4 out of 5, not the 10 scale I was using for myself. Whoops!"
Jason H.,"San Jose, CA",27,281,105,2.0,11/17/2012,"It all starts with the hostess. One needs to be genuinely friendly and not methodical as patrons check-in. Can the food make up for it? The food was typical BJ's fare, but the preparation and quality control was lacking. How did everyone miss the bacon and cheese chunks on a Cobb salad? The preparer missed it. So did the server. Our Classic Burger with cheese was missing the cheese. The cook missed it. So did the server. The only positive here was our apologetic and otherwise attentive server. We did not go thirsty."
Rey R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",13,3,,3.0,10/27/2014,"Stopped by around 1:15PM on a Monday for a beer and some wings. NOT a full size meal. 30 minutes for them to arrive to my table, their food is good, service needs to get better."
