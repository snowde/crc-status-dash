Todd S.,"Windsor, CA",0,19,,3.0,10/22/2015,"Nothing to outstanding about this establishment. It is your average chain restaurant like an Applebees. However, I go here quit often with friends and I have never had a bad experience with their food. They have a good steak, good ribs, and in my opinion they best claim chowder in the local area (surprising right!?). Without driving out to the coast, its my favorite spot to get claim chowder. With that said the atmosphere is usually really loud and crowded (not necessarily a bad thing) and the service can take forever during meal times. A good place to go if you want to have a good time with family and friends."
Monsoon F.,"Vail, AZ",0,23,2,1.0,3/19/2013,"Pro: beer (according to everyone I'm with) Con: everything else! This location is by far the worst I've been to. Pricey, terrible service, poor quality food and dirty."
Rebecca W.,"San Rafael, CA",3,19,1,1.0,12/2/2012,"I have been here a few times since the Santa Rosa location opened and it just gets worse every visit.   The hostess was completely rude and didn't even look up from her computer while speaking with us.  We went around 2pm on Saturday and about half of the dining room was empty, yet it was still a 10-15 min wait...we asked why and the hostess coldly replied that there weren't enough servers.  BUT there was a group of two or three waitresses standing around chatting...I don't get it.  For the second time in a row, I have ordered a salad with dressing on the side and received my salad DRENCHED in dressing with a side of EXTRA dressing....really? The waitress was cool about me sending it back, but the food in general is so-so, especially for the price.  They have a good selection of beers on tap, but that's the only plus about this place."
Tammy M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",14,100,177,2.0,4/6/2014,We just left here an hour ago and to be honest tonight was not a good night here. The service wasn't bad but our waitress took forever checking on us. It just really sucks because the food is good but we get so tired if wAiting so long for any service here. She took forever filling up our drinks. She even forgot to take our menus away. It just wasn't a good experience for sure n I think we will past on ever going here on a weekend ever again.
Amanda L.,"Rohnert Park, CA",87,119,36,4.0,5/25/2014,"I love BJ's. I used to live in Fremont where we had a BJ's there way before we had one in Santa Rosa. Pizookies are ALWAYS a fave. SO good. Their menu is huge and they have a large variety of appetizers and small plates. Beer is excellent, same with their other cocktails. My favorite dinner entire is their fish n' chips. Best I've ever had anywhere. My fiance loves their burgers. Generally, our service is good. Sometimes we get waiters or waitresses that don't check on us too often but all in all it's fine. I love that you can call ahead and reserve seating too. Their BJ's rewards card is cool too. We definitely come back once in awhile for a date night."
R T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,32,1,1.0,11/1/2013,"Seriously, don't even bother.  The food sucks, the wait staff sucks, and you'll waste 2 hours of your life for the check. Terrible."
Mitch O.,"Petaluma, CA",0,5,,3.0,5/28/2012,"Took my wife to Bj's on Saturday night, our weekly date night. We have been looking forward to eating here for a while. We ate at a Bj's while visiting friends in southern California and loved it.   Santa Rosa BJ's Breakdown: HOSTS: hot or cold. By this I mean to say that some were very OVERLY sweet and bubbly to the point of being disingenuous or absurdly cold, flat, brass, and distracted.  All and all I give hosts a 2star rating.  SERVICE: Nice, friendly, but tried up-selling way to much. Made it awkward.  Knowledgeable ut a bit robotic. Didnt make a mistake. Would have liked to see a bit more of the PERSON inside the robot though. but who knows, some people may dig that.   All in all service gets a 3 star rating.  BUSSERS: Good job. Saw them twice. Filled waters. FOOD: Cooked well, good presentation. Generous portions but didnt over stuff me or heaven forbid waste food. I dont like to see all the wasted food restaurants throw away, shameful. But Bj's hit it on the head with the portions. Favorite thing we ate was dessert, ordered the Pazookie. Warm chocolate chip cookie, ice cream, chocolate syrup. It was lovely. very good. All in all 3-4 star rating (my wife and I disagreed on the rating so we agreed to disagree) all in all a pretty good time."
EarnIt P.,"Windsor, CA",133,45,6,5.0,10/30/2015,"Kevin as a server. He was excellent. We order Bloody Mary's, waters and the avocado rolls to start. He was back in less than a minute with our waters and to let us know our appetizer and drinks would be ready soon. Excellent service from beginning to end. I've had the worst service here but it is convenient and the food is good so I go back. We asked for the manager to give our kudos to Kevin as his professional attitude and attentiveness were priceless. The food is always good. A little pricey at $8.50 a bloody mary but they are yummy."
Jason P.,"Loomis, CA",183,88,109,3.0,1/11/2015,"My first lunch time stop at BJ's.  Started off entering this clean establishment through their revolving door.  They have a hostess stand right up front where one waitress was behind the counter helping a difficult guest and another employee dressed like a hostess was standing there wiping down menus.  As we stood there for several minutes waiting to be acknowledge another host came up to help with the difficult guest.  All the time the employee wiping down menus kept...well wiping down menus.  Not sure why she was unable to greet us, smile at us or help us in any matter.  So we decided to just skip on over to the bar where we were greeted by a very nice, attentive waitress.  My chicken parmesan sandwich and Jeremiah Red pint were awesome.  Price was right as well. Only $3.50 for a lunch pint was a cool surprise.  Minus the front of house greeting...this was a great visit and I'll be back!"
Melissa W.,"Cotati, CA",37,1,,1.0,1/22/2015,"Giving 1 star for the nice waiter & waitress in training.Otherwise The drinks & calamari appetizer took way too long, both fork & knife had to be sent back having dried green substance glued to them.I unfortunately ordered the chicken pita tacos w/feta cheese & a greek yogurt sauce(which looked really good on menu) but when I tasted them they had a very srong old musty goat smell/taste. To say the least they were just awful! When the waiters asked how everything was I was honest w/ them and let them know they where bad.They apologized sincerely and sent over the manager Gary F. Un-trained for a management position things went from bad to worse.This guy absolutely denied any possibility that it could taste like goat and rather then saying something appropriate like ""I'm sorry you were not satisfied w/ your order, can I offer you a dessert,remove it from the bill ect."" The manager continued to argue about it,when I suggestested he go back to the kitchen & taste it for him self he agreed, dissapeared & never came back leaving his restruant staff to cover & apologise for his imature behavior. Sorry don't go, really not worth the time or $ ."
Ralph D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,2,,1.0,9/28/2013,"Terrible. The service was horrible. Had to wait an hour. Finally was seated at a table and it was another 20 min until food came. When we were finally got served it was as if the food was pumped full of grease and sugar. In short, a frightening experience with cheaply made food."
Pala V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,24,18,3.0,6/7/2014,"Good customer service however house salad was not fresh the greens looked like it was about to die on me, slices of cheese were stiff could definitely tell it was prepackaged pre refrigerated"
Michele B.,"Millbrae, CA",5,88,,3.0,9/3/2012,"We sat outside they need to get some kind of  screens to block the sun when you are out there. The food was good had a bacon burger very yummy my friend had the personal pizza the sweet  pig it was small like the size of a bagel and it was a little pricey, our other friend had the cobb salad hmmm looked ok and he said it was good. The watermelon mojitos were ok had  2 of them so I guess they weren't to bad. The cost for 3 of us and 6 drinks under $80 not so bad  but could be a tad less expensive. Service was pretty good  the waiter was very nice."
Krissy K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",189,76,9,4.0,4/23/2014,"I've been to this BJs before and have had awful experiences every time prior to this time. They must under new management because the restaurant has improved in every area. John M was our waiter and was fantastic, the food was delicious, and the service was great."
Mark O.,"Santa Rosa, CA",30,303,377,3.0,7/4/2012,"Came for lunch - their Monday to Friday 11 am-3 pm lunch special menu was a really great deal for Santa Rosa.  Most options are $6.95-$8.95.  The $6.95 flatbread sausage, basil and tomato pizza and salad was excellent as was the $8.95 grilled mahi mahi tacos with tortilla chips (big flaky hunks of fish).  The beers were good - not great when you have Russian River Brewing and other fantastic beer places in town.  Server was friendly but overall service was a little slow - they have only been open for less than 2 months so hopefully they will get it together - they had plenty of people working!  Overall noise level is high so don't go for quiet conversation."
Jay G.,"San Francisco, CA",20,50,13,2.0,8/14/2013,Terrible service and lousy food. What's even worse is it attracts the douchebag population of Santa Rosa. It's not a family restaurant when you have drunk guys and girls shouting at the top of their lungs. Pizookie this!
Tammy G.,"Penngrove, CA",5,11,4,1.0,2/2/2014,"""Homemade"" gluten free pizza crust was anything but! We were told by our server that everything was made in house. The salad dressings tasted bottled, the crust frozen. Tried the gf pizookie for dessert it came out raw. It was awful! They don't have much on the menu that is gluten free and the allergen chart is mis-leading, they only identify items with wheat, they totally ignore the rye and barley aspect of gluten!!!"
Nikki S.,"Sebastopol, CA",84,98,1,3.0,4/7/2014,"Wasn't my favorite place, they had all the orders wrong, my friends mashed potatoes were cold & there was a sausage on my cheese pizza. Although I am giving three stars for delicious potato skins."
L C.,"Bend, OR",9,24,26,3.0,1/10/2015,The food and service here is fine.  It's like going to the cheesecake factory.  But don't let the ¨Brewhouse¨ name fool you.  The stainless steel tanks up front are just for show.  They don't brew anything here.    They just repackage a Budweiser IPA and brand it as their own.
Lynna M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",7,33,1,2.0,4/15/2014,"Had a bad night at BJ'S. Service was so slow, took 30 mins just to get water!! Don't think I will be going back anytime soon! TO BAD :("
