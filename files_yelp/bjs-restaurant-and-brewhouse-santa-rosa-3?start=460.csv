Warren C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",48,8,4,4.0,10/19/2013,"Some winning choices here are the tortilla soup, the Cajun chicken pasta, and the Ahi poke. For dessert, the pazooki is a must have. The menu here is extensive & I'm still working my way through it. Among their wines, I prefer the Elsa Malbec or the Murphy-Goode Cab. Great place to have a beer & appetizers while watching a game."
No N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",77,13,,2.0,7/16/2014,Ok so I took my wife and kids here for dinner and was very disappointed. First it took forever for the hostess to seat us. Next our server took forever just getting our drink orders . The food I don't have any complaints about. Service was very bad . Waitress never refilled our drinks and I Finally had to wave down another waitor just to ask him to do it. Asked for Tabasco sauce which never came . Kids seem to like their spaghetti though but got really restless because it took so long coming. I Think we will pass on going here again.
Justin P.,"Windsor, CA",1,16,11,4.0,9/27/2012,We asked for quick service and we got it.  The food was decent.  Like all of the TV's.  Fun atmosphere.  Clean look.
Bud R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,45,1,1.0,11/4/2014,"Slowest service, the servers frequently forget things, like my beverages, mediocre food nothing to spend money on, and their house beers? Terrible. I wish I could put negative stars, the whole experience was overall terrible."
Yulfo L.,"San Diego, CA",48,78,29,3.0,9/25/2013,"I like that I have a variety to choose from all different kinds of foods.  Sitting outside on a nice night is the best way to go or else you are going to be sitting in a restaurant that feels like a bar while your yelling across the table.  Even without a game on the tv, its just so incredibly loud!!!!!  Dont go if you have a headache or in a bad mood."
Danny T.,"Santa Rosa, CA",11,4,10,1.0,2/11/2014,Just had the worst service ever and been to multiple BJ's in California I will not be coming back anytime soon and it wasn't even busy so I won't take that as an excuse food was good but service was lousy had to ask multiple times for water no silverware and this waitress was awful.....
Audrey G.,"Oakland, CA",35,10,,1.0,9/21/2013,"Two words.... Absolutely disgusting! I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon, I literally got 4 bite sized pieces of bland salmon, 2 pieces of bland broccoli, a few baby carrots and some equally bland and small portion of  couscous for $12.95.  The picture on the menu looked nothing like what was on my plate. So dissappontind. I could have made this meal better at home. Don't waste your money at this lousy restaurant."
Kellen H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/10/2013,"Good prices, fantastic food, great service, fun atmosphere, full stomach. Everything I could want in a restaurant and more. Want a casual date with a hint if fancy? Right here. :) P.s. get the burgers!"
Michael C.,"Windsor, CA",18,32,11,1.0,2/4/2013,"Reluctant 1 star. (only option). Inedeble food , nonexistent service and very loud. Rather run a cheese grater across my tongue than eat there again."
Kristopher E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,14,,4.0,12/3/2013,"Went on a Monday night so the place was pretty much empty.  The food (fettuccine alfredo for me) was pretty good but not exceptional.  The waitress was nice, although new and a little unfamiliar with the menu.  The wait for food/service was a little long considering how empty the place was.  However, it was my first epxerience with a pizookie and it was amazing! I can't imagine having eaten an entire one by myself though."
Bill F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,4,,2.0,5/4/2013,"First time here tonight for a burger for my birthday... It started OK when the waitress said I'd get a free dessert because it's  my birthday... We were hungry so we ordered 2 appetizers... 5 minutes later we ordered our burgers... Apps never came until 5 minutes after our burgers... We said forget it.. we were never checked on about our cold fries or overly rare burger... She came to clear out plates and one again offered the free dessert but after waiting 15 minutes for it we said forget it, just give us the check... She weakly apologized and said she would tell the mgr but never heard any offer to make good or anything... Anyway, we won't go back and could not recommend it... Next time I want a good burger it'll be 5 Guys or In & Out!"
Laura D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,83,42,1.0,1/4/2014,This place sucks! This is the second time that I have gotten food that's cold. Last time my food was cold an the other people in my party's food was warm this time mine was warm an theirs was cold. We both got burgers and they put fries on my plate but barely any on the other plate. The cheese they use looks gross. It was just not tasty and extra greasy. If I wasn't hella hungry and other places were open (it was NYE eve) I wouldn't have eaten it. My friend didn't eat theirs. If I ever go back it's for beer. The food is just gross. This place is basically a Applebee's...puke
Elise G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",194,153,204,2.0,7/7/2013,"Had lunch here during the heat streak before the 4th of July and have to say I was not very impressed.  I should have checked the reviews first, but honestly wanted to get inside to a nice cool place and have a bite to eat and it was handy.   It was loud, and the calamari appetizer was soggy. Service was okay, nothing special. Pretty interior though, so someone drops some bucks on it.  What particularly threw me was when we left, there waiting room was completely backed up with people, also probably escaping the heat, but there were lots of open tables.  That tells me that they didn't anticipate a crowd on a blistering hot day and were completely understaffed.  I doubt we will be back."
Bliss F.,"Sacramento, CA",17,90,96,4.0,1/12/2014,"This was my second visite to this restaurant. The food is plentiful, the staff nice . The pulled pork sandwich was delish!!! Mom had the blue burger and raved about that also. It is nice when you are out of town to find some place that is dependable, nothing worse that not knowing your way around town and getting a bad meal. BJ's was a good choice for us hungry weary travelers."
Paul L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,5,3,1.0,11/10/2013,"Hostess took us to a table that was already full. Had to wait a few more mins around other people who were eating. Server took 15 mins to come back take our order. Server put someone else's table order on our table so food runner insisted it was ours. Our food went to another table. Not given any utensils or plates, had to hunt someone down to get that."
Gianni M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",659,51,11,2.0,12/19/2013,After reading all the poor reviews my wife and I had to see if it was that bad. Our previous visits to other BJ's were good. Well now I can say I understand the poor reviews. Service was bad. Had to ask for refills several times. Took forever just to take our order and even longer for it to finally come out. Note we came on a Thursday at 2:30 so they weren't busy. Then the old came out. We ordered sesame chicken salad and a small deep dish pizza. The salad was actually good. (That's why the yet 2 stars) The pizza was horrible. Didn't think it was possible to ruin a pizza that bad. When finished we ha to ask four times for our bill. I think this place has potential but they clearly need more training and more attentive managment.
Tyler L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/28/2013,"I just went there for dinner tonight and service was super whack, the hostess and the waitress gave an attitude, the pastas came out cold(looks like it been sitting out for awhile dry and crusted) and my sister was still nice enough to eat it due to we waited forever for the food and the pulled pork sandwich was super sweet. The only good items were the calamari , the burger and the pazookie Oreo cookie  ice cream. I went to other BJ restaurant location and I say this is the worst place ever even as a new establishment. Only towards the end that another waitress noticed us and ask how we were doing because I ask her for ketchup for the fries. If I'm ever coming back is for the pazookie and  the beer but there's way better beer brewery in Santa Rosa."
Alisha M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,22,,2.0,12/28/2013,"Service was worse than bad. Waitress was nice enough, but we waited 1hrfor a baked potato and a open faced pot roast sandwich only to find she wrote the order wrong and my meal was incorrect. Then we waited 15 min for the replacement then another 20 for the free dessert that we didn't want. lame."
Grace S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/11/2014,"A very nice atmosphere but....the food was either plain and very average or bad. The service was not great either. If your looking for a good lunch spot, go to sea noodle right next door."
Bethany B.,"Penngrove, CA",35,17,,2.0,1/3/2014,"Don't get me wrong, I love BJ's! This Santa Rosa one has made me not always want to go to BJ's. The folks that answer the phone and are at the front entrance are not friendly. The servers are always running around like crazy. Plates are dropping on the floor everywhere. We do call ahead every time and still have to wait 20+ minutes every time. The last time we went in our server gave us a bill before we even ordered dessert. He didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert. We said we did want dessert, one person at the table ordered and he left without taking the rest of the dessert orders. I have been to friendlier and less hectic BJ's than this one."
