Pedro M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",18,3,,1.0,12/21/2012,"WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER!!!...by far the worst costumer service I've EVER gotten. I have NEVER actually left feedback on ANY restaurant before, this place made me come here, create a profile and leave feedback, think about that and you'll wanna read my review....Ok so the amount of time to wait to be seated was somewhat reasonable but after being seated, we didn't get ANYONE come to serve us not even water for about 10-20 mins. When someone finally came to help.  I ordered coffee, took her another 10-20 mins to bring it, but with no sugar and no spoon so I asked the waitress to bring me some sugar and a spoon, she again took an unacceptable amount of time and came back with only sugar and not a spoon to stir my coffee...we then made our order since we noticed she was taking so long, we ordered appetizers so I asked to get a spoon before getting the appetizers since I wanted my coffee before anything.  After a long time, she came back with the appetizers and NO spoon, by this time I'm so frustrated that I don't even wanna say a thing. After about half an hour, they finally bring our entrees, so I ask the other employee for a spoon and new coffee since the one I got was already cold, she apologized and brought me new coffee and finally a spoon within five minutes, which I didn't mind as much but we never got water served to us, so I had to order water and orange juice so I could safely eat my food after drinking my coffee...after I finished my coffee, I STILL had to wait a long time for them to bring me the water and orange juice I had ordered, by then my food was almost completely cold but since I don't like to make a big scene and since my friends didn't want me to, I didn't complaint and I just ate as much as I could but left almost half of it because it was too cold to consume enjoyably. This was the second and LAST time I go to that particular place, the first time it was also bad but not as bad so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but now I'm sure I'm NEVER going back."
Olivia L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",439,28,3,2.0,8/3/2013,"The restaurant itself looks nice....  but what makes a restaurant is the food.  I'm a picky eater but when my whole family doesn't like it there's obviously a problem.  I went there a few months ago with my Mom and my son I can't remember what my Mother got but I know she wasn't impressed.  I got a salad and I had to send it back the lettuce was discolored and looked old... My son (5) got nuggets and smiley fries.  To say the least he was grossed out after he ate a bite of the smiley fry the waitress said ""they're so delicious!!!""   It was like a soggy bland sponge.  Yeah, so tasty."
Rose W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",29,23,33,5.0,2/1/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to go here since they opened. Finally having enough money, we went.  We were greeted, and seated. The Waiter was friendly. I will admit it took awhile to get our food, (it's expected with how crazy busy they were) and we got our dinner before the appetizer, but the waiter took the appetizer off our bill, because of it not coming before the dinner. so that was just good service. The Food was wonderful. My boyfriend had the steak and I had the pork chop with Maui waui glaze. Good prices, my taste-buds loved every bite. For our appetizer we had stuffed mushrooms with spinach and feta cheese with a lemon pesto sauce. For dessert, we had cookie with ice cream on top. The cookie was hot out of the oven, melted in the mouth.  We had a great time there, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try delicious food."
Scott A.,"Windsor, CA",50,291,252,4.0,7/1/2013,I'm impressed that my burger was a perfect medium-rare. The jalepeno part was lacking. Really cool place for a chain. They're doing it right.
Lay Lay G.,"Rohnert Park, CA",2,21,1,1.0,1/10/2013,This place is awful!! The first time we went waited overall over an hour. The front idiot so called hostess was more on her phone and putting on lip gloss more than paying attention to guest. The food I give a 3 nothing fresh about it. The waitress sucked and never smiled. Then tonite when we got their we got seated near the door so called the other tables were taken.  And in top of that I found a gross thick hair   when I went to move my chicken on the other side if the plate!!! Talk about being grossed out!!! I told our waitress about it and said its most likely not hair and could be melted plastic!' WTF!! Why would that even be better!! I left and went to whole foods  much better food!!! I would never go back even if they comped me a free meal or paid me!
Dani D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,15,,1.0,7/6/2013,"I grew up with BJ's in So Cal so I was very excited when they opened one here and I could introduce my hubby. We have ordered to go once and it was pretty decent, would have been great if we had actually gone in and eaten.  Went tonight to try again and ended up walking out before being seated. We walked in and there was a large party up at the hostess stand, one hostess was standing in the walk way so I had to turn to my left to get out of the doorway, my husband and son followed and we waited there for the hostesses (there were 3) to get done trying to figure out where they were placing this large party. It took them at least 5 minutes because everyone kept changing their minds. We were never acknowledged or spoken to however we know they knew we were there as they walked around us several times. In the mean time another couple walked in and once the sat the large party they immediately we straight on to the other couple leaving us standing there. Their hostess need to pay more attention to whats going on and if there are 3 there at the stand they need to be seating other people. It does not take 3 hostess to figure out where to seat a large party."
Angela C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,11,,1.0,3/9/2013,THE FOOD IS DISGUSTING!!!! bland and tasteless! the shrimps were raw! just all around DISGUSTING. no other words... NO STARS
Eric M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",54,65,2,4.0,10/14/2014,"Four stars means I'm a fan? Not sure about that, but BJ's has definitely improved since the opening months. Yes, if you read the initial reviews from when BJ's opened; the consensus was...they were horrible. I go to BJ's because my family likes it. I go to appease them. I also suffer from a lack of originality, so I tag along. Food isn't too bad. Yes, the menu is extensive and you should be able to find something to your liking. Odds are, it will be pretty good. Not great, pretty good. You're not going here for a 5-Star dining experience. This is a place to relax with family and friends, grab a beer or a quick bite to eat. Regarding that quick bite to eat, service has gotten a lot better. During a recent busy Saturday evening, we received our food quite quickly. I was very surprised how quick it arrived. To see if it was a aberration, we decided to go the following Saturday (I told you my family likes the place and I lack the ability to come up with a better option). Once again, great service and food arrived shortly after our order. Shock! This place gets a bad rap. Yes, it's a chain. Yes, we have numerous local places that may be 10x better. That doesn't mean it's bad. It has gotten better, actually a lot better over time."
Abra A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",91,144,21,2.0,6/4/2014,I don't understand why people wait inline for this place. Food is so boring and just not good. I come here for happy hour late night when nothing else is open late. The drinks are good but thats about it.
A W.,"Oakland, CA",1,22,,1.0,9/17/2012,"Here goes: SEVICE - 5 STARS.  All staff were polite. They fulfilled are requests in a timely manner and were always around to check on your table to make sure you had everything you needed.  AMBIANCE - 3 STARS.  It's a pretty generic looking place. Feels very corporate to me. They have outdoor seating, which is a lovely touch and is a much quieter alternative to the indoor hall. However, outdoor seating faces the Codding Town Mall parking lot :( bummer. It's not a lovely view. Also, if you're there around sunset, you or your friends who sit facing west will have to bring a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes. Because of the way the seating is arranged, east to west, someone will always be getting sun in their eyes.  BEER - 3 Stars.  The BJ's Hef was pretty watery.  FOOD - 1 Stars.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the regular (slim?) cut fries. I SO wish I could give the food more stars. However, the burger gave me food poisoning, and thats a huge no-no for any establishment.  Seven hours after leaving this place I experienced shivering, chills, nausea and severe diarrhea. Yep foodborne intoxication, folks. Overall, I would give them 1.5 stars on yelp, if I could, mostly for service and ambiance. But the fact that their food makes you sick drags the rating waaay down. I also read other Yelpers mention undercooked chicken and seafood. I wish I had read their reviews before I ventured out to BJ's. I would have saved myself massive amount of pain.  TL;DR - Contracted foodborne illness from burger. Will not go back."
Cat M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,22,2,3.0,9/8/2013,First impression by the girls at the front was no bueno! Not even a hello? Seriously? Thank goodness Richard our server was super attentive but the food was just ok. Otherwise I would give them 2 stars. Definitely not coming back unless I know for sure I get Richard!
Pat L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4,50,,3.0,11/16/2012,It isn't gourmet food but a great place for business lunches and family (with kids) dinners.  Easy to get a table and something on the menu for everyone.  I like 4 star restaurants for sure but I have to admit their little pizzas are tasty.
Korva G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,31,14,2.0,1/26/2013,"Given  BJ's a couple tries- looks cool, good ""vibe"" but the food is not worth the visit. I wanted to like the place but there have been so many negative experiences from: cold- doughy ""deep dish"" pizza , hot and brown celery to massive use of artificial smoke flavoring in ribs, sauce and wings.... Don't bother. Pros: Great beer selection- probably an awesome place for happy hour but don't bother for dinner - wont come back- :("
K H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/10/2012,"Apparently I am one of the few who has had a great time here... My boyfriend and I first went here with two of our friends for a late-lunch/early-dinner sort of meal, and in turn, we ordered a few appetizers and shared. We opted to sit in the bar for Happy Hour. My boyfriend and I had the calamari and the lettuce wraps. Our friends also got the calamari, and they got the spinach-artichoke dip. I am not a big seafood-eater, but this calamari was delicious! Not oily or flavorless, like some people seem to have encountered. The lettuce wraps were great, and the spinach-artichoke dip was wonderful! We also got a few pizookies to share afterwords, and my red velvet pizookie seemed to be the winner! We all had great service from every employee we came in contact with. Well- my boyfriend and I loved it so much that we went back one or two days later for a real dinner! We were seated in the regular dining area this time. He ordered a pasta dish (the kind escapes me) and I had the shrimp tacos. Our dinners were awesome! And again- we had great service.  I also happen to really enjoy the atmosphere and decor- it feels relaxing, yet refined. A place you can dress fancy and have fun. (The first time we went, we all came from a public swimming pool, and the next time, my guy and I decided to dress up a bit- either way, I feel as if we weren't treated differently because we were ""under-dressed"" the first time.) Also- not only did our food taste great, it looked wonderful as well! Anywho- you can count on my boyfriend and myself being life-long customers. And we are actively recruiting more friends!"
John F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,31,3,5.0,8/4/2014,"The staff is very friendly and even when they are extremely busy they try their best to take care of everyone. I used to be a server so i know how it is and honestly these servers take a lot of shit from people who expect undivided attention during busy hours and expect 5 star quality food when this is no fancy upscale restaurant, its a casual dining restaurant so you get what you get but they put in good work considering the large crowds and demanding customers they take care of every day. I have all the respect in the world for all the servers out there."
Andrew W.,"Cloverdale, CA",147,22,3,1.0,5/16/2012,"1st time at BJ's 2nd day its been opened.. Service was terrible.. Ordered 2 drinks and took our order also ""orange soda and peach lemonade.. Had to remind server that we didn't get our drinks after 10 mins.. Came back and dropped mine off and gf didn't get hers.. Had to tell another server and they came back 10 mins later with drink. Excuse was had technical difficulties?? After 40 mins we didn't get our lettuce chicken wrap yet.. Didn't say anything since there were very busy.. Finally came and the chicken meat was already cold.. Food arrives 20 mins later.. You can tell my pasta was sitting there because the sauce harden already and chicken was also cold.. No comment to server.. Friend asked to reheat shrimp.. Server never came back to check on us.. Another server helping customers had his butt in between the 2 tables and right infront of our faces.. layout was too tight..  Finally asked to speak to a supervisor which I never have done before.. Told her about how the server never came back to reheat shrimp.. How long it took for drinks and appetizer.. Asked for check.. A different server brought our check out as the other server tells us the shrimp is being recooked.. Had to get a supervisor approval beforehand. We said no thanks. Paid our bill which the supervisor did discount but was not the point.. Left 20% tip still and left.. Doubt I will ever go back.. We had like 5 different servers that night.. Just not a great experience for a 1st timer. It was packed giving them the benefit of doubt.. But service was the issue here.. 1st time I ever complained at a restaurant, so had to be pretty bad.. Left 20% tip just because I work in the tipping industry, but if i didn't I would have left only 10% or even less.."
T. W.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",0,426,202,3.0,12/26/2012,"Food is good, but the service always seems off.  This was almost perfect except they put the wrong ice cream flavor on my wifes pizookie."
James R.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,21,,2.0,1/15/2015,"A return visit to this location. Short wait for a table, but not bad for dinner time. Found the service lacking. Meals came out fairly quickly. We had to ask for a second beer about 6 times. Finally the waiter finally brought two 'tastes' before he actually brought the beer, as we were finishing our meals. Food was OK, nothing to write home about. Never asked about refilling the soda, or if we wanted dessert. Might try it again, just not any time soon."
KC J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,,1.0,5/7/2014,"Terrible.  My hubby's burger arrived stone cold so we sent it back-meanwhile, not wanting to eat without him, I wait and of course now MY food is cold.  Server was very sweet, but the short, squat female manager acted like she was doing us a BIG favor by taking off 25% of his burger.  So after jacking up our entire experience, less than $2 is the price of our satisfaction at BJ's Brewhouse.  On our last family visit, 4 out of 6 entrees were bad.  We won't be back."
Deena M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,1,2.0,9/15/2013,I have been to this restaurant 3 times. I thought maybe at first they were working out the details as any new business would. I really hate the service when you have to ask for something 2&3 times! Wait for drinks was really long. They lost our reservation for 13 people! I think they need a good management team to work out these issues. Food is average. Super loud.
