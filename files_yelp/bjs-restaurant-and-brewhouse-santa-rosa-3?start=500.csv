Brendan B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",73,46,1,2.0,12/3/2012,"The food, while a little on the expensive side, is pretty good.  The service is not.  I've been here 3 or 4 times since they opened, and each time it has taken forever to get our food.  I've had to remind waiters of things that they forgot, I've had appetizers show up halfway through the main course, I've been neglected for drinks, and I've had to walk my credit card up to my waiter to pay at the end of a meal.  I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid this place, but I certainly wouldn't seek it out either."
Michelle J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",31,6,,4.0,9/9/2013,"Service was great. Can take a while to get ur food if they're really busy. Food is mos tly really good. Sandwich es and burgers can have a little too much sauce, so ask for not a lot of mayo, or whatever else is on it. Sodas are really yummy if u don't drink. It's worth it all in all. Just get to know if u want them to do something sprcial for ur irder."
Rj W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",33,23,21,2.0,4/21/2013,"Honestly, I did not think I would be back after my first experience. My husband and I ordered steak and salads and it took over an hour for our salad to come out and another half hour for our steaks to arrive, and they were well done (ordered medium rare) But then I received a gift card for Christmas and we decided to got back on a week day. The service was improved but still over all lacking. I was very impressed with the food though. My husband loved his burger and we both love the calamari, it was delicious and cooked to perfection. We have been back a few times now and Its pretty consistent good food, bad service."
Nancy M.,"Petaluma, CA",70,89,5,2.0,4/17/2013,Party of 7 for lunch; arrived at 11AM when the place was mostly empty. Two hours later we got our check. Food good; service very bad. 'Nuff said.
Lillie K.,"Auburn, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/17/2014,"The service at this place is a joke! I came in with a group of 4 we all ordered sodas which came in 25 min of sitting down. Like it really takes that long to get 4 sodas! Even though we were clearly ready to order, which was only desserts, the waiter came 10 min later. Another 30 min go by no food at all and the waitress was very unprofessional and rude! We ended up being there for an hour And 15 min, just for dessert! So not worth it, this place needs to get their shit together"
Carl S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",84,12,4,3.0,6/23/2012,"Burgers sucked. Fries were good. Beer was good. Service was slow but good. Friend had the pork sandwich, which was realllllly good."
Abby R.,"Rohnert Park, CA",23,30,13,1.0,7/16/2014,Every time I come here I'm reminded why I haven't been in a while. Super slow service!!!!! Today will be my last time coming here. I will make the drive to San Rafael the next time I get the urge for BJ's. Today's server was exceptionally slow. Took her over 10 minutes to get our drinks out. My sons Caesar salad made it out before our drinks! It took 35 min for our food to come out. We asked for waters and that took another 10 minutes. By this time I was ready to just walk.
Niki B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,1,2.0,7/28/2013,"I've given BJ's 3 tries, I tried the fish tacos and was very salty, and I have tried the pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken, first of all the chicken was dry, and the pasta did not come with much sauce,  my friend tried the steak and he said it was not that great. Only thing I had good was my drink and dessert. I really think they need to step it up with food, I've had other friends say they have the same experience, too bad. Cheesecake Factory would have been a better option. There food is much better."
Micah T.,"Windsor, CA",0,14,7,2.0,10/17/2014,Sometimes all you want is a Juicy thick burger and a cold beer....this place has the beer.... and possibly the most tasteless dry burger I've ever eaten. Should've stuck with just the beer and enjoyed the deceivingly amazing scent of grilling meat.  A true disappointment.
j b.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,27,1,1.0,6/9/2012,"The pizza is The Best PIZZA in town. Whole wheat crust is divine, thick and not greasy. Baked to perfection. The barbeque chicken pizza is fab. However, I have visited BJ's twice and service is very slow. I know they are new and there will be a learning curve but it has to improve soon or they will lose customers. I objected another time to visit due to fear of slow service. Took longer to get the Pizookie than the Pizza. The waiters are green but very sweet and try hard. But whatever is going on in the kitchen I believe is not working.  My other complaint is the extreme NOISE. So loud that one must be prepared to shout to your table group. Feels a bit stressful and not a relaxing eating experience. I don't understand why there isn't some glass in the dividers to help with sound. It is just a large room filled with many tables. Who designed this? Great if you have screaming babies or toddlers as no one will hear them. Poor design when it comes to noise. I am sorry they chose this as I enjoy their food but the experience will give you a headache and sore throat."
Amber M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",14,36,6,4.0,5/19/2012,"The only things stopping me from giving a 5 star review was the wait to get seated & the sun roasting us diners on the patio. Despite being open just under a week & it being a Saturday night, the service was great! Attentive without being annoyingly hovering. I had the Black & Bleu Burger. It was excellent...so delicious! My daughter had the opened face pot roast sandwich...she loved her meal, too! They have quite the extensive menu & TONS of beer choices, plus mixed drinks & wine. We also each had the Pizookie Trio for dessert...too much for one person, but perfect for sharing! We had leftovers to munch on later! Can't wait to try other items on the menu."
Christopher J.,"San Carlos, CA",0,9,1,1.0,9/5/2015,"Unacceptable. Service was unbelievably slow and painful. What we thought was going to be a quick Saturday afternoon lunch turned into a 2.5 endeavor in which our sides came out before our meal and our drinks after our food. We never got our silverware until we had to ask for it twice. We honestly will never come back due the lack of service. I had to go find another server since I couldn't find a manager after being neglected for more than 35 min after our dry dead food came out. Mind you we had asked why our food took so long and our servers reply was ""that's a good question"" when we all know she obviously forgot to do her simple task of putting the order into the computer system. Must be hard to be that incompetent I'm assuming.. Anyways.. The foods average.. And the service was by far the worst thing ever.. I would have rather gone to a salad bar or cook a meal for myself at least then I'd know why my meal took 2.5 hours."
Scott A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",31,41,2,2.0,10/11/2012,"Typical over priced, under quality mass market chain restaurant food.  Nicer atmosphere than Applebees or similar theme multi-chain restaurants, but the food quality was mediocre at best."
Ross G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",16,31,10,5.0,10/11/2012,"Just appetizers, beer and the Giants. My friends and I had blast. The calamari was excellent, the combo platter appetizer with Spring Rolls, Avocado Egg rolls, chips with Artichoke dip were perfect. Ordered mini Bruschetta's, they were yummy. We had the harvest hefenwiser beer, it was my first with harvest style beer but it was ok. 5 stars for the service, food, and the ambiance."
Channy L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",46,34,43,3.0,4/13/2013,This place is a hit or miss on food and service. I have been here a hand full of times. At times the food is very good and others not so much; it is very inconsistent. I continue to return because of the great dessert selections.
Kimiko N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",19,82,,3.0,6/17/2012,"I feel like the people who work there are SUpEr nice but everything is so commercial I just really couldn't get in to it.  The food tasted ""Sysco-esque"" and I felt like I was in a busy airport. They sat us at a super small table with a toddler who kind of stuck out in the middle of the server and bathroom ""runway"".  Yea, I usually sit my extremely destructive child on the inside of the table lest he attack the server or any innocent passerby.  I must reiterate however, the staff was so wonderful.  Kudos on the hiring, I just think I will have to attend on a slower day."
Tech M.,"Petaluma, CA",4,125,75,4.0,7/18/2012,Glad we have a BJ's in Santa Rosa.  Kind of a cross between Applebee's and Cheesecake Factory.  HUGE menu which I have enjoyed many items on.  Appetizers are also very big and service is overall very good
Douglas L.,"Cotati, CA",19,49,12,3.0,3/24/2013,"Good food, excellent service but it is so loud you have to yell to talk to your guests around the table"
Jesus R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,9/16/2015,"I'm a fan of BJ's and I come here quite often and service is always great even when its busy. Today something was off I come here around 1ish and its got a good amount of people there but not crazy busy. I had to wait to be seated about 10min no big deal and when we got seated we were helped right away and got our drinks which came quickly and then we ordered which is when it all went downhill. me and my boyfriend ordered off the lunch special he got soup and salad and I got a pizza. His food came out right away while I was sitting with no food. We also had no silverware. The server made several trips past our table but did not comment on how I haven't received my meal. He was done eating by the time mine finally came. We ordered a refill on the soup which took 30min to get and then got a pizookie which took a long time too, overall we were there roughly around 2 hours. The server was nice but had no sense of urgency and was very slow moving.  I paid through the app and then booked it I've never had slow service like this in the past even on a busy friday night. our orders were very simple and it was only the two of us so and it wasn't busy so I'm not sure if maybe today was just an bad day for BJ's maybe they were short staffed, whatever the reason I hope My next visit will go more smoothly."
Kanani S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",69,232,85,3.0,7/2/2012,"I was actually impressed considering all the bad reviews and feedback I got from a few friends who have gone here. I understand the place is new and there's obvious bugs to be worked out, but honestly Sonoma County, you have to admit this is one of the better places that's opened up in a LONG LONG time, especially in Coddingtown. My girlfriends and I were seated promptly on a sunny sunday around 3:30. The place wasn't extremley busy but had a good crowd inside. We ordered the buffalo chicken mini pizza and the great white mini pizza, both were good, a little burnt on the crust but still had good flavor. We all leaned more towards the buffalo chicken pizza then the great white. The appetizer sampler was decent, a bit smaller than what I was expecting for $17 but it worked. We weren't a fan of the avacado egg rolls but the mini southwestern egg rolls were good and we swapped out the artichoke dip for the potato skins, loved the potato skins. Our favorite part was the watermelon mojitos! Probably one of the best ones I've had in Sonoma County. All in all the place wasn't bad and wasn't great, but a nice place to pop into grab a couple drinks w/ the friends or significant other. I wouldn't mind going back :)"
