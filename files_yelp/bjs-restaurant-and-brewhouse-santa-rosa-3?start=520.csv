Skip W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,10,,3.0,5/5/2013,"I've been to BJs several times over the past year and the quality of service is so inconsistent that overall it averages out to be a pretty mediocre experience.  When a member of the staff actually pays attention to you and gets you what you ordered then eating here is rather nice.  However, several times I have had to wait very long, or my appetizers come out after my meal does.  They have so many servers on the floor, yet I often see them chatting amongst themselves and trying to coordinate who is serving which table.  The other night when I went my beer was flat and it took more than 20 minutes to get my server's attention to ask for a different beer (which was also somewhat flat...) When everything does go smoothly, things are good.  The menu is typical pub food; pizza, sandwiches, burgers, salads, dinner entrees, but with diverse choices within those categories.  Their home-brewed beer is not bad either, and their taster glasses are larger (somewhere around 4-6oz).  The atmosphere is nice, large and open with plenty of sports on the many TVs.  If they can fix the service bugs I'd give em 4 stars."
Wulfstan C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",21,427,,3.0,10/5/2012,"This is a chain, not something I normally bother with, but I have ended up here when stuck in the Coddingtown area.   So far, I've been a couple times and enjoyed it enough to be satisfied but also enough to see that it has clear limitations.  I was always there at lunch when it was only moderately busy - enough to be lively but not too much to really test the place.  I have only eaten a couple of their salads, which were enjoyable and with good flavour, reasonable balance of veggies and meat, etc., but also with that clear, rather crude mass-produced-food quality.  I am skeptical of most of their dishes and thus avoid them.  Beer is ok - pleasant enough, but very simple, a bit crude.  Service I have always found to be very good and friendly.  The place, contrary to some comments, always seemed clean when I was there, and the decor is quite nice and attractive.  This is about 2-3 stars, but I will say that I am satisfied with their two different salads with chicken accompanied by a beer, so overall the experiences and food which I have actually had warrant a 3."
Jennifer H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,24,1,3.0,1/31/2014,"I have to agree with other posts regarding service time...waitress was very nice, but seemed forgetful and scattered.  Our appetizers came and then 5 minutes later she came by with plates;  some food brought to the table was cold and over cooked...kids meal came with what seemed like a double order of large fries...ordered two of the same dessert but only one was brought over (charged for two)...not sure we will be back anytime soon...for what we paid I'd rather try another restaurant in town"
Gene D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/22/2012,"This place sucks, the service is horrible, bunch of young inexperienced servers, with a less than sharp female manager, Applebee's type food, only more expensive, scratch this place off your list!"
joe s.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,28,,2.0,6/21/2012,"The food is okay if all restaurants in Santa Rosa are closed, slow service, there was hardly any liquor in my Mojito. No, I am not visiting this place again and so do you!"
Daryus C.,"Cotati, CA",0,49,1,5.0,3/31/2013,"I'm somewhat of a food snob and even more of a customer service snob. Needless to say, I came with my reservations about BJs. Actually, I flat out expected to dislike it. Then I had the hamburger. It was huge. The bun was toasty and probably the best bun in Santa Rosa. The meat was surprisingly fresh for a chain restaurant and very tasty. I had the burger that comes with those little deepfried jalapenos... wow. If you go to BJs, try this burger. To top it off, they treated me like royalty from the second I walked in the door. I don't look like royalty and I definitely don't act like it. So, here's to you, BJ!"
Sean S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,45,1,1.0,3/27/2014,"What a mess! I've been to a BJ's in the Bay Area that was great but this Santa Rosa one sucks!! Incompetent servers, hair in my salad, ice cold soup, manager said will remove items from my bill, then forgot to, maybe the only decent thing here is a beer...eat elsewhere!"
Sierra K.,"Forestville, CA",2,5,,1.0,3/21/2013,"My boyfriend and I went there for the first time yesterday. We got there at 7 and ordered the calamari to start. It was kind of soggy and the sauces on the side were spilling over the sides. We weren't very hungry so we split the dinner with lobster and salmon. I would eat the veggies and rice and he would eat the meat. After we got our food, the waiter didn't even bother to check in on us. We finished eating at 7:30 and the waiter finally came back at 7:58. That's half an hour of waiting, with empty drink glasses. We wanted BJ's to redeem itself with dessert, but by that time we just wanted to leave. At least the decor was nice."
Kelly H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",62,17,,1.0,8/10/2014,"Never again.  I have tried this place three times and it's three strikes you're out.  The service is HORRIBLE.  Orders were wrong, took forever to get our food and our drinks and although the waitress was nice she clearly was in over her head.  The prices are a bit steep for the quality of the food but not unreasonable.  However, the place is so loud that you can't hear people at the same table talking."
Jeff B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/6/2014,Much improved.  Will go back again.  When this place opened  it was a mess.  They have brought up the service the  food good to great. Try the gumbo. It's a little spicey from the sausage but o' so good.
Randy S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/23/2013,I have no idea what all the buzz about this place is. The food is mediocre to just plain bad. On top of that the price for the food is ridiculously high. The cocktails are terrible. Their new jack berry whatever is just plain bad. And I know my drinks. Normally a drink like this would taste like a Lynchburg lemonade except with a blackberry twist. Wrong! Not here just taste like warm jack with syrup.  The only thing this place has going for them is their beer and their service. The problem with that is the damn appetizer. I ordered came 2 minutes before my meal. Like that makes any sense to do for a customer.  Coddingtown must be charging them top dollar for rent if I'm paying a ton of money for poor food and bad drinks.  The only reason I'm even giving it 2 stars instead of one is because the waitress was fantastic.
Nathan J.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,29,,1.0,7/27/2014,"Tried three times, consistently bad service. Food items delivered were inconsistent with menu description and cold, checks incorrect, inattentive staff. I'm over it."
Susan C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,15,,2.0,7/16/2014,"We have been to BJ's several times since they came to Coddingtown and this time I can see they are taking short cuts and the food quality has gone down.  The service has gone down as well.   Tonight I order a new featured salad the beet salad.  When it came a picked through it and found only 7 tiny slivers of beet among drown arugala.  They had over dressed the arugala with their strawberry vinagerette.  I sent it back and said I expected beet in a beet salad.  When the waiter came back with an excuse it was "" we were running low on beets"".  I said that was a poor excuse, that if that was the case you take it off the menu.  He agreed with me, but after I ordered a different salad they came out with a hot version of the beet salad that was predominant with beets and a short while later the other salad that I ordered came.  Well, they credited the beet salad and I had them box up both and took them home. The last time we were there the waiter couldn't tell me what was in one of the sauces and when the manager was nearby later I inquired about the training of the wait staff and my disappointment with the knowlege of the menu and this particular waiter and he said he would help him learn it better. So, good luck to all of you who risk eating at Bjs."
Sherry P.,"Windsor, CA",1,29,21,4.0,9/27/2012,"Hostess, seater and server were all friendly.  We needed quick service, and they got us out on time.  Enjoyed my beer and my Thai shimp appetizer.  Fun atmostphere.  I will go back."
A P.,"Healdsburg, CA",7,21,,2.0,9/27/2012,"Went on a Saturday night, it was crowded.  We got in much quicker than expected, but once we sat it was at least 10 minutes before we got a drink, and had to ask for waters about 4 times.  Food took forever, and was not good.  I ordered most expensive steak on the menu, it had fatty bad spots and meager portion of potatoes to go with it.  Disappointing, but what can you expect from a chain..."
Stink C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,97,35,2.0,8/20/2012,The service is decent.  The pasta dish with the Alfredo sauce is bland. The   under-cooked on the pasta dish. The ahi salad is better.
Ezra B.,"San Francisco, CA",13,203,4,3.0,6/17/2012,"Like all the other reviews the service was no good. Seemed like no one knew what they were doing, yet got our food while it was still hot and didn't have any real problems. Just a general sense of bewilderment by the staff. Food, typical chain restaurant stuff, nothing special besides the PIZOOKI!! Holy ice cream and half baked cookie Batman!! That's the only reason I would come back. Respect it."
Leslie G.,"Benicia, CA",84,35,1,3.0,7/30/2012,"My mom lives in Santa Rosa so I visit the area often.  The town really needed a place like this and I have to say I enjoyed my tortilla soup and salad.  We ordered the avocado wontons hoping that they would be as good as the Cheesecake Factory's....  Not close but okay :o)  I think that this restaurant is trying to mimic the CF with lower prices.  Got to apppreciate this place for what it is which is definitely not the CF but a decent fun place to visit with good service, great selection, and okay food."
Adam K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,13,2,3.0,3/24/2013,"Food was great, sandwich was great! Fries were also great. Only downside was the waitress. Kind of a bitch."
Monica K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",69,74,4,3.0,8/15/2012,"The people there are usually nice, and the food is good, especially their dessert. Sometimes it takes a little while for them to bring you the food. I am a vegetarian so there aren't many options for us. The pizookie with the red velvet and vanilla ice cream is my favorite!! The prices aren't too bad, and it's nice that they're open late so you can still go out to eat if you're working late."
