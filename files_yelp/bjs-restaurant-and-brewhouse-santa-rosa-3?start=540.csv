chris b.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,3.0,5/21/2012,"The good: happy servers who are trying hard; full bar; wide beer selection; menu has something for everyone. The OK: food.  Nothing we ordered was bad, and nothing particularly memorable.  OK. The bad: Where are the bar TVs??!!  More seats in the Bar face the walls rather then the tvs behind the bar, yet there are none.  Sports bars need many more tvs in the bar.  Really odd to have a good set up behind the bar and nothing to the sides until you get 20 years over in the restaurant."
Live F.,"New York, NY",5,25,,5.0,11/6/2013,Great food !!!! And the host and server where very pleasant. No waiting and the place was busy
Nikki W.,"Pacific Grove, CA",61,295,119,3.0,6/7/2012,"We were excited to try this out since it is new and when we've gone to BJ's in Vacaville it was pretty good. Not this time. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because the service was good and we didn't have to wait very long for a table. BUT the food was not very good, dry hamburger, crusty celery with the buffalo wings, old tasting fries, chicken nugget-like buffalo wings and the best thing we had was the pizza, which was OK. So we'll probably try it again but for the first time around it was as bad as Applebee's."
April V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",32,58,,5.0,6/28/2012,"I really love the overall experience of this restaurant.  We needed some excitement in this town!  They make great cocktails.  I had a Hypnotic special drink that was recommended and it was perfect.  I really like the mac n chees, hamburgers, and ahi tuna salad.  Even the watermelon salad was delicious.  It sounds weird but it is yummy.  I have always had good service.  You can't be to harsh on judging a brand new restaurant on there first few days of opening.  Anyway, beers are really good too."
Earl H.,"Watsonville, CA",8,23,1,5.0,9/27/2012,"Great place!  We stumbled upon BJ's on Sept 1, 2012 and although there was a 10 minute wait for a table the salad, pizza, and beer were very good.  Service was very good as well, and price was good."
Julia R.,"Sonora, CA",0,4,,1.0,12/26/2012,Would NOT reccomend this restaurant at all! Poor service and the food was below standards. When we finally got the food - an hour after ordering- it was wrong. When we got there we were one of three tables. Still took 1 hour to get the food and another 20 to settle rhe bill - and we had a kid with us! Don't waste your time or money!
Thomas E.,"Windsor, CA",6,4,6,1.0,8/25/2012,"Let's be specific:  ice tea, mini pizza and house salad was only $10!  Far cheaper than other places, but geez it was bad. I've had surprisingly better at Denny's and great meals at the Cheesecake Factory. Here, the produce on the salad was underripe and dry served with the wrong dressing. The pizza was just dough, salty, and flavorless. Cheap meal...you get what you pay for?"
Mark F.,"San Francisco, CA",25,28,,1.0,12/7/2013,"Waited quite a while for a table. Then over 15 minutes to get waiter to take order. Another half hour to get food and yep, order was wrong. Waiter explained it was not his fault and then waited again for my meal while my dining companion finished theirs. Bill came and no apology. Not even a comped beverage.  Yikes.  Really bad service all around."
anthony f.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,12,,1.0,8/7/2012,"I should have known Deep Dish Pizza at a sportsbar, I ask for extra sauce and they actually put less on, the pizza was raw and doughy just like I feared it would be. The waitress got our chicken wing order wrong and brought out these frozen deep fried balls they call bonless chicken wings, which we did not order, they were awful. We ate one piece of pizza and threw the rest away. I mean the chesee was still not melted in certain places, really!!!! Don't waste your momey, on as I call it PRE-FAB food. We were tired from playing tourist all day with our out of town friends, or we would have sent it all back."
Katie R.,"Petaluma, CA",181,11,2,4.0,5/30/2012,"I always have loved BJs, and this new location in Santa Rosa is great too! It was super crowded when we went on a Thursday evening with a 2 hour wait, but I'm sure that's just cause it recently opened for business. We were incredibly lucky to snag a first come first serve booth in the bar shortly after we got there. Their pizza is always great, beers are good, we love the avocado spring rolls. Our server was great too, although you could tell he was incredibly busy he still stopped to chat and was funny and prompt. I'm sure the wait time will get shorter as they are open for longer. Awesome food, very consistent!"
Christine D.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/15/2014,"I have been to this location twice in the past week.  Both times the service was awful. When I went for lunch during the week it wasn't that busy yet my server messed up my drink order twice.  And i only ordered a Diet Coke.  Not really sure how you can mess that up but she did.  When i went yesterday it was more crowded which meant the service was a lot worse.  I ordered a burger with cheddar cheese.  I got a turkey burger with swiss instead.  I would have sent it back if my server ever came back.  It took my husband at least 10 minutes to get ketchup.  While we were there, another couple sent their food back as well.  I would avoid this place at all costs.  It is sad when a chain like this is just this awful."
Juliet R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/4/2012,"I have no idea how other locations compare but the Santa Rosa BJ's was not a good experience!!! It is AWFUL!!! We had eaten in the restaurant a few months ago being that it was local and new and we wanted to check it out. We split a burger and both felt icky later that day, but weren't sure it was the food from here or something else..... **Side Note- We were told by our waiter that it is the same people that run the Cheesecake Factory chain....** Just the other night, we had both worked late and were too tired to think about dinner. We decided to give BJ's Restaurant another try and ordered take-out.. OMG was it awful (again!) and way over priced! Do not waste your money or time!!!! Horrible horrible!!! BJ's stands for BAD JOKE! Not a good addition to Coddingtown!"
Kimberley P.,"Rohnert Park, CA",12,12,7,4.0,2/14/2014,"First time there after finding out Sweet River Saloon was closed.  Monica was our server and Katie was manager for the evening.  My husband and I brought our 13 year old daughter with us.  We had artichokes,  Avacado Egg Rolls, and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers.  Monica came back and said they had no stuffed mushrooms.  The Avacado Egg Rolls were fantastic and reminded me of the Cheese Cake Factory ones but almost better.  The Artichoke dip was very good and then for some reason the Stuffed mushrooms showed up.  There was obviously a lack of communication.  My husband ordered a burger and fries which was good but nothing to set it apart from any other ordinary burger.  He also had the Cesear Salad which was fantastic.  The presentation was lacking.  I had the Chicken Alfredo.  The presentation was not good.  The chicken was over cooked and dry and served on the side of the Alfredo Pasta.  The pasta was great but I would revommend watching the cook time on the chicken and serve it on top of the pasta with some sauce.  My daughter had Minestrone soup which she loved and the speghetti.  She ate all of it.  Over all I really liked the atmosphere, presentation should be looked at but the staff was great.  The manager even comped us for the mushrooms since we were told they did not have them.. Monica and Katie did a great job.  Lets jyst hope  Bj's looks at their reviews."
Johnny W.,"Seattle, WA",1,7,,3.0,2/27/2014,"Decent burgers, a bit overcooked. Overpriced, fries should not be ala carte, but the best in Willits if you wanna have a beer with your burger."
Kim R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,37,2,3.0,6/23/2012,Have been back three times since my original post and have to say that it must have been the new staff and the large crowd because this is not the same BJS. I have not had the same food that made me sick but the flat bread and appitizers are all great. It is pretty expensive but we came to watch the World Series and it was full of energetic people without any of the drunken slobs. The bar area is the best place to sit right next to the huge TV. The bar is self serve so no wait time most of the time. The servers have all been good the only thing is the floor is slick. It's not a bad thing just something worth noting.
Jayne C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,51,2,3.0,2/23/2014,"been twice now, once for drinks and appetizers and the other for dinner. waitress was really nice, food was ok. its loud so dont expect to be able to hear anyone at your table, typical bar food but more expensive"
John M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",3,34,,2.0,12/2/2013,"not the cleanest place to eat.  there was what appeared to some ones dirty t-shirt on the floor of the hall leading to the bathrooms, the floors had food on them in the main dinning area where we were seated, and our server had many food stains on her shirt.  That said, the food was OK, nothing special, the starters came at the same time as the main dishes."
Ashley E.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,9,,3.0,5/12/2014,"The drinks are great, especially the beers. My personal favorite is the Jamaican Red. Their service so far has been great, but the food is awful. Everything is way over spiced, soups come cold, and I feel I make better dishes at home."
Crissy S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,7,,3.0,8/25/2012,"I had the french dip which was pretty good. Fries were a Little soggy but I think that was from my sandwich. The kids had mac n cheese and my daughter who eats almost anything did NOT like it. I do like the seating (HUGE booths) and atmosphere. My 5year old can be ""grumpy"" at times so I like that it is loud enough where no one will hear him lol I heard they have great pizza so I think I will bring the family back again."
Mel M.,"Windsor, CA",0,23,,1.0,2/11/2013,"This place sucked!!!  I still wish yelp would allow zero stars, because 1 is too good for this place.  The service was HORRIBLE, as well as the crap they serve as food.  Barely saw the crappy waiter we had, & when we did, he took plates that still had food, without asking if we were done (which we weren't), & he seemed very put out. by having to DO HIS JOB & serve us...Tip: if you don't like serving people, get a different job...you'd be better off at McD's or JitB with that attitude.  The idiot food runner brought our ""food"" out, & I was supposed to have garlic bread with mine...she didn't say anything about it not being ready or anything...just dropped the sh*t food & ran...so when we finally get our waiters attention, & mention my BF had not gotten the vinegar with his fish & chips & I did not get my garlic bread, he sighed heavily, rolled his eyes, walked away & got the vinegar, then came back & said the bread wasn't ready & would take a couple of minutes.  Sad to say, the garlic bread was the best part of the meal (but they're small pieces). I did not really want to go there at all, but I had gotten a gift card, so I figured, eh might as well use it...huge mistake...I should have just thrown it away...or asked any idiot that likes it if they wanted it.  F**k it, I should have just handed it to a bum...trust me, I would have done that had I known how that whole experience was going to turn out. Needless to say I walked out of there freakin' pissed!! Please do not go to this place & support it...I really want to see it close down."
