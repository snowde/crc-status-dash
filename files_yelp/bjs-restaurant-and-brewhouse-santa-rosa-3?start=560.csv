Renie S.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/20/2012,"I came here for the 1st time ever about a month ago and had a great experience. I was so excited to come back again.  Today, I came in with a big group. We had reservations, and when we showed up on time, the male employee who was seating guests treated us with horrible customer service. He did not have the table ready for us and rudely had us sit on the chairs and wait. Take in mind that the restaurant was barely busy. I thought reservations were to be seated at the time you make them for? He then made it very difficult for us to ""check in."" He mispronounced the party name we had our reservations under and when we corrected him, he didn't think the party was actually us.  This one interaction set us up for not the best experience here. I believe the host should be a welcoming and friendly face for guests when they come in, and I did not feel welcomed at all today."
America F.,"San Francisco, CA",20,154,2,3.0,12/12/2013,I did have any major problems with the place everyone was nice.  The food was fine.  It took a few tries to get a to go container but everything ended well.  I didn't like that the place was so small.  It wasn't as clean as I would like it to be.
S. M.,"San Rafael, CA",0,10,,5.0,7/21/2012,"After reading so many poor reviews, we approached BJs with some trepidation, but were immensely pleased with our experience.  1:00 pm lunch on a Friday was very pleasant.   Service was attentive.  Manager apologetically informed us of a menu change - quite gracious.   Whenever we wanted our server, Kathleen, she was always easy to find, and polite and helpful.  The food & beer were delicious.  The decor and atmosphere are lovely - yes, a higher noise level, but in our cozy booth, conversation was easy.  I tend to be rather a grump, but found nothing to inspire that at BJs."
Ashley R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,68,,2.0,6/17/2013,"I think my time at BJ's has come to an end.  We came in yesterday and we had two beers and their boneless hot wings.  Ten very small chicken mcnuggets for ten dollars.  And $6.25 beers that would cost you 4 or 5 anywhere else.  I finally realized that at BJ's you won't get any deals.  And all their happy hour food items are discounted but also ""happy hour size""...so basically a smaller portion for less price.  That's not a deal, that's just paying less for less food.  I don't know, I think I'd rather spend my money somewhere else.  I will say that the wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive - 5 stars for that."
Susan W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,19,,1.0,4/7/2013,"I wish there was something less than one star because they don't deserve even one. I've been there at least 20 times, why? With hopes that it will get better... The beer sucks, food sucks, service sucks. Every time I've gone there they've messed up at least one persons order from my table. It's frustrating! I get the same burger every time too and it comes with avocado and a special sauce. About a dozen times they haven't brought it out with no avocado or sauce and when I tell the server that it wasn't on it they look at me like I'm out of my mind and making things up. The only good thing is the Pazookies, and even they have come out burnt a few times. I noticed that they are always posting for a kitchen manager on craigslist and it makes sense because they cant seem to get it right. My favorite sushi place was torn down to put this place in and its terrible!"
Samantha D.,"Petaluma, CA",25,3,,1.0,5/24/2013,"This is the worst BJ's ever. Been here 4 times, orders wrong each time.  This time we waited almost an hour for our food, and when it finally came it was wrong, Luke warm, and salad lettuce was super wilted and old. No refills offered on drinks. Waitress wasn't exactly rude, but certainly not friendly. My sis ordered a pizzookie to go, and the cookie wasnt cooked all the way. Disappointing since the other BJ's I've visited are the complete opposite!"
Stephanie C.,"Rohnert Park, CA",3,94,4,2.0,8/7/2013,"This is really attractive place with a convenient location attached to the Coddingtown Mall.  I've been here a total of three times now and the service has been good each time.  However I have to subtract one star because the food isn't consistent.  Each time I've gone, I've ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger (I know, I know, I'm the real adventurous type) with the request that it be cooked medium. One time it was perfect, another it was a undercooked (I'm talking cool and red in the center) and had to be sent back and this most recent time it was overcooked to the point of being super dry.  It's a relatively new place so I think they are still finding their groove.  The ambiance is great and the bar is beautiful.  This would be a cool place to come for a happy hour and maybe a couple appetizers and it certainly is the best dining option for anyone that wants to take a break from shopping and grab some grub.   There is a lot of potential here so I'll be back at a later date."
Jay W.,"Santa Rosa, CA",231,15,11,3.0,6/2/2012,"Good food but a little loud inside , also its a new place so expect to be waited on by a trainee. Other than that I really enjoyed the place will go back next month hopefully it will be quieter and better staffed by then."
Peggy K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,67,,4.0,11/14/2012,"So surprised to read negative reviews of this beautiful restaurant.  We live nearby and often go there for the reasonably priced and very tasty lunch specials (flatbread pizza is a favorite).  We have stopped in for mid-afternoon appetizers as well and love the potato skins.  When it first opened, there were some problems with inexperienced young servers, but we have had great friendly service since that time.  An upscale-feeling, beautifully decorated restaurant is long overdue in this part of town... we are happy to have BJs at Coddingtown!"
Harminder D.,"Rohnert Park, CA",28,60,13,2.0,6/22/2013,"Went here on Fathers Day for dinner.  We arrived early, around 4:30pm, to avoid waiting for a table and we were seated quickly.  We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip with chips.  The chips were crunchy and warm.  The dip was also warm but may have been a little more hotter.  It seems that it may have been microwaved and then torched on top to give it a ""fresh"" look.  I ordered a veggie baked potato, my mom ordered the veggie burger, and my dad ordered a deep dish pizza.  The food took a while to get.  We waited about 35-40 minutes! The baked potato could have had more toppings on it. The veggies and cheese on top were sparse and there was no butter in the potato giving it a dry taste.  My mom's veggie burger only included a bun with a little bit of butter, lettuce, and tomato - there was no cheese, mayo or mustard.  Disappointing.  My dad'd pizza was impressive.  The only good things: their root bear and pazooki.  Our waitress was nice."
J W.,"Rohnert Park, CA",18,62,2,4.0,3/3/2014,I like the food is really good and the beer's not bad  It's a large menu with lots of options.  It's super super loud though.
Seth G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2012,"This was our 2nd visit to BJs and this was a terrible experience. The first visit was average. We started with potato skins that were inedible. Some of them came plain with none of the toppings (cheese, bacon, etc.) and they had a soapy taste. I rarely send food back, but this was terrible. Next came the entrees. My wife's salad and my ahi salad were decent, but would not suggest them to others. My son had the mini burgers and he was satisfied. My daughter was served UNCOOKED chicken strips. We had to ask 2 times for the manager to complain. The chicken didn't even look cooked on the outside. Needless to say we will not be back!"
Tee R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,17,,1.0,3/10/2013,"Mediocre all around, took forever just to get a couple glasses of water, they screwed up our order then it took 20min and asking 2 different people 4 times for sugar for my coffee, this place is a joke"
Rachele G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",113,17,,5.0,6/30/2012,One word Amazing. Our waitress Erika took great care of us. She took our order and was fast at bring us our order. There was a mix up at another table and she gave us a free dessert to start then our potato skins came with our entrees and she felt bad and didn't charge us for them. She was very good at coming by and making sure we were doing okay throughout the whole meal. Even got us some more drinks really fast. Tonight they were busy but she acted like we were the only ones here. Totally coming back.
Ruby L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/9/2015,"Just got back from BJ's in Santa Rosa. What started out as a great family evening quickly went down hill fast. We had to wait about 15 minutes which wasn't that bad considering it was dinner time on a Friday night. We were a party of four adults and three kids. Placed our order with 2 appetizers and waited 45 minutes just to get the those. These were good. It took another 25 minutes for some of our meals to come after we had finished the appetizers. The kids got theirs first which was a good thing - However the spaghetti was  a only a table spoon full of sauce over a bowl of clumped dried out noodles, yuck! This is when it got really fun, the next four meals came out each about 10 minutes apart and each one regressing further. By the time the last of the four meals was brought out which was a hamburger no bun Paleo style. This thing was a joke, it was a golf ball sized patty half broken tossed all over the plate. As its being handed over, the waiter is mumbling saying "" I know we are missing some components to the burger but the chef is working on it"". We're already talking 1 1/2 hrs! This is when we had enough. The patty was cold enough to stop a nose bleed and small enough to be considered a booger:) My mom's meal that's a whole other story. 30 minute ordeal and the meal couldn't be eaten! At this point in the dinner we had already pasted the point of no return and were just trying not to laugh or make the wait staff, who was working and trying very hard not to get more flustered. All this being said I felt bad for the staff because clearly something was wrong from deep inside the room where they killed I mean cooked the food. Will we eat there again, no, would I recommend the place to anyone, yes, but only to a Sasquatch! Trust me it was that bad and I never like to complain. We had to ask 2 different time to see the manager and finally after a good 20 minutes he came and apologized and said he would make it right. Not! He comped us half the bill when 75% of the meals were not right. We paid the bill just so we could get out of there but we left angry,  dissapointed, and hungry!"
Maureen W.,"Windsor, CA",0,20,,1.0,6/18/2012,"Noisy, slow service & bad food. Who puts cold canned tomatoes on pizza?  Not going back."
Raul H.,"San Diego, CA",1,6,,3.0,11/25/2013,"The service was very slow today due to inexperience on part of the waiter.  Though we had a large party of 10 people we thought it might be slow for a Monday. After a conversation with the manager, she rectified the situation and gave us a nice credit on our bill due to the bad waiter service. The food was good and plentiful just wish it had been quicker- and by that I mean it took us approx 35 minutes to get our drinks, if that gives you an idea."
Kevin P.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,27,8,1.0,7/7/2012,"Another in a line of big chain restaurants that are portraying themselves as a neighborhood family restaurant. It was a Sunday night (7/1) and my in laws, sister in law, her kids and my wife ""ate stuff that is food"".  Ok, first strike, Full bar means you can serve most cocktails found in NY Bartenders Guide or Mixology Apps. So in our Italian family, our drink is the Negroni. A simple drink of Campari and Gin (we skip the sweet vermouth). After 20 minutes, several visits from the server and dictating the proportions, ""we are missing a key ingredient "" reports the waitress---that'd be Campari since they've got to have Gin. Second strike is my father in law isn't drinking since he's driving. We asked several times for water, even a pitcher of water ""we don't do pitchers of water"" said our waitress. A brew house doesn't have a pitcher to put water into.. 'Koko the Ape' would have understood and been able to complete this task. And now strike three- as there are several incidents, this is a collective strike. BJ's didn't serve my wife or her sister the right entree, which then took about 10 minutes to replace. It took over 10 minutes to get my wife a glass of wine and 15 for my beer for dinner. My nephew's fries tasted like fish, since they were most lkikely deep fried in the same oil as the fish...I can go on, but why. Summation. Thirsty for a beer and not too hungry yet not in the mood for food, well then this plasticized palace of bland food platitudes is your place. I'll not be returning, unless I am sent to food hell, where BJ's, AppleBees, Cheesecake Factory, Cracker Barrel and their ilk reside...Food Hell Hint: When your menu is laminated, bound and comes with pictures=Same as frozen food box at the grocery store!!!"
Sara Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,9,2,1.0,6/30/2013,"I keep giving BJ's the benefit of the doubt-they are busy, they are training new people, the restaurant just opened, etc., but in the past year I've been there 4 times and every time I've experienced terrible service and mediocre food.  Just today we sat down for lunch at 2:00 and our waitress forgot to bring our kids drinks for 45 minutes, never came to check on us once, ordered me the wrong meal and completely neglected our table.   We will never go back, I wish the Cheesecake Factory opened there instead."
Stuart K.,"San Jose, CA",100,46,,5.0,7/3/2012,"Omg the best service I have ever had at a restaurant!  Not to mention the food was amazing! They brought our appetizer at the same time as the entrees which wasn't a big deal but out waitress, Erica an excellent server automatically comped the appetizer and gave us a free desert!! I highly recommend this place and the potato skins!!"
