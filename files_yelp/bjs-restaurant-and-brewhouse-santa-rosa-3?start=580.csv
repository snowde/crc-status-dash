Ashlee Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",66,12,,1.0,12/1/2012,"We went for dessert for my mom's birthday. I had somehow avoided ever going to a BJs even after living in the east bay for awhile. However, it was mom's pick so we went. I may have had some preconceived notions about corporate chain places like this, but I was actually surprised in just how bad it was. First, it was an extremely stormy night so the waxed floor was so slippery I almost fell on the way to our table. I first mentioned this to the hostess, who replied, with a laugh, that because of her nonslip shoes, she wasn't affected by it. Then while waiting for our waiter I watched 3 other people catch themselves from slipping. I again said something to our waiter about how slippery the floor was, and instead of any kind of concern at all, got to again hear about their nonslip shoes! I was absolutely surprised at how little they seemed to care or realize that someone could hurt themselves. That annoyance aside, we ordered our desserts (a scoop of ice cream for me since it was one of only two options under 1000 calories). 45 minutes later, our waiter plopped our desserts on our table without even an acknowledgement of how long we had waited in the ""not busy enough to be excused"" setting. To be fair, our desserts were not bad but certainly not noteworthy in any way. We could've gotten the same thing at Applebee's for less money and probably received slightly better service. We finished in all of 10 minutes, and then were subjected to his horribly rehearsed end line of how much he enjoyed ""spending time"" with us this evening. There was not one minute of our drawn out experience there that was either genuine or remarkable in any way. In the parking lot my fiancé and I turned to each other and asked mercifully to please never make the other go back again."
Jason L.,"Windsor, CA",13,17,,1.0,9/25/2012,Service sucked. Food was average.  Beer is nothing to get worked up about.  Oh and the big one don't try to complain to management.  They don't care and would prefer you to just leave.  Well I vote with my dollars.  I hope this place gets their butts kicked straight out of Sonoma County in place of some Mom and Pop places that care.
Jennifer S.,"Soulsbyville, CA",0,4,,3.0,8/16/2013,"I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars on the food. It's not the best and its not the worst. I'm giving the service no stars. Both times I've been, the service was awful. So many different people bringing us our food. What is our server doing? I wouldn't know because both times they were MIA."
Jim M.,"Portland, OR",0,9,,2.0,7/20/2013,"We visited on a Saturday afternoon.  The place was busy , but not filled with customers.  The service was very slow, from receiving drinks it took 35 minutes to receive food orders of hamburgers and salads, and additional 10 minutes to receive an order of ribs.  The hamburger and fries arrived cold and tasted salty and greasy.  The salad was good, while other items just ok.  Basically mediocre food and very slow service.  Many other much better places to eat in Santa Rosa.   I could not recommend BJ,s Restaurant."
Ramon M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",169,38,,4.0,5/11/2012,"I think today was the first day this restaurant was open. It was really crowded and there was a line in the front of the door. We already had a reservation. The place is huge and there are huge TV monitors mounted in every direction, so you can catch news and sports from any table in the house. The staff is still under very heavy training so every table had 2 wait people instead of one. The Bussers were the best, refilling waters and lemonades before you had the chance to ask for refils. The service is very friendly and the the prices are not bad. Lemonade was 2.75 but you get unlimited refills. The beer selection looks great but I had to work so I did not even look at the drink menu. The food was fast and clean, but the waitres brought something different from what we ordered, since we had to go back to work we did not complained ( my friend ordered the cheeeseburger pizza and got a cheeseburguer $9.95)  I ordered the veggie burguer($9.50) . The veggie patty was really tasty but it was too thin for my taste.  The Bignette ($5.95)  at the end was really delicious, served hot and full of vanilla flavor, topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream surrounded by fresh berries. I would go back just for that and coffe after the movies. People on the table next to ours had some great looking dishes that were not on our menu, so maybe I missed them , but I am willing to go back ( any takers?) to check those out. This place is going to be THE hub for sports fans, With more TVs than anywhere else in the 50 mile radius."
Christina S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",48,5,,1.0,3/23/2013,"Unfortunately,not a fan of this restaurant.  The service was horrible, and the food wasn't anything to brag about.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table outside, which there were plenty of tables open.  Our waitress only came over once to take our order, never once asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. My husbands burger had about a gallon of salt on it, my daughters chicken tenders weren't fully cooked, and my salmon had a weird smell, like its been frozen for a while and was cooked quickly.  Would not recommend  this place to anyone."
Michelle T.,"Cloverdale, CA",0,48,,1.0,7/2/2013,"Yikes!  Hubby and I had to try this out one Saturday since we had heard it was a new place in town.  We went at an OFF hour (2pm), not lunch time and not yet dinner.  The place was barely busy.  LOTS of seating in this place.  Food was pretty basic and mediocre.  Service was horrible!  We received menus from our waitress in somewhat of a timely fashion after being seated but...she never came back to take our order after telling us that she would be our server.  We waited 20 minutes with menus CLOSED on the table meaning we were ready to order, right?  She was very cute and attentive to the table with 4 patrons NEXT to us (two couples) but clearly couldn't handle a few tables at a time.  Finally, we were ready to just walk out and I flagged down another waitress & complained about our waitress never taking our order.  We will never go back there.  Not worth it.  Blah, boring food and really poor service.  Wouldn't even give it a second try."
TJ M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2013,"Maybe if they had fewer items on the menu they might be able to get my order correct.  Second time here, second fouled order, last time back!"
Nicole M.,"Petaluma, CA",81,19,3,4.0,8/27/2012,"I am impressed! Stopped in for lunch this afternoon with my sister and 4 year old son. Inside was very loud, but extremely busy so it was to be expected. Luckily for us, we didn't have to wait very long for an outside table (8 minutes?). The weather was perfect and the outside tables were roomy and very comfortable. The patio was not over crowded and the tables were far enough apart that you didn't feel as if you were intruding on the table behind or in front of you. The hostess that seated us, Kelsey (sp?) was the sweetest and friendliest hostess I have ever met. Our server was great as well. I tried the white peach margarita and will definately go back to get another. The lunch specials were such a great deal and the servings were generous. Everything tasted nice and fresh. It was my first time dining at BJ's and I have to say, I'll definately be going back! Thank you for the awesome service!"
Lynn P.,"Hercules, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/28/2012,"This is the third time I've been here since it opened, and unfortunately it's gotten progressively worse.  We ordered appetizers for lunch which arrived about 45 minutes later only AFTER I complained to my waiter. Meanwhile my son's order was not yet ready (bread bowl) so we finished eating well before his order arrived.  We were not given any plates, nor drink refills until we asked.  We complained to the manager, and at the very least he comped our entire lunch.  We received a 2nd flatbread pizza on the house which came out HOT, the way it should've been the first time. Which leads me to believe the waiter had our food sitting.  BJs, please train your staff on basic customer service skills and a little more hustle!!!"
Robert m.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,3/30/2013,"This restaurant does not belong in California.  I went there with 6 people last night.  We all ordered different items.  One out of the five was ""tolerable"", the taco.  It is quite apparent that none of the food is actually prepared in house, it is apparently shipped in on a big truck and heated up to order. I had a pizza with mushrooms, garlic and Italian sausage.  What a disaster.  First of all it, the wait for the food was about a half an hour, I guess you are supposed to drink a lot during that time so the food tastes better.  The hard liquor bar is their bread and butter.  My pizza came out barely luke warm.  I sent it back along with the pasta the person next to me had and waited another 10 minutes for it to be ""warmed up"".  Both items came back a little warmer but still not hot.  But even warm, the pizza was terrible, the crust was like cardboard and the favors were indistinguishable.  Same goes for the shrimp pasta.  There was no taste to it.  The side salad I ordered was iceberg lettuce with a couple slivers of carrot served with what tasted like cheap bottled ""Italian"" dressing.  The wine list was expensive and the service was okay.  I will never go back there.  I really can't understand why the place was packed except for the fact that they have a lot of televisions and people were watching the college basketball games. P.S.  I forgot to mention.  After we got our food, we had to ask the waitress for silverware and napkins."
Chelsea D.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,23,33,2.0,8/29/2012,"Came here with two friends for lunch. The outside seating was what made this bearable for me. It's very dark inside. I knew I wasn't going to like this place, too corporate for my liking. The service was pretty good, I'll give them that. However, I feel like their staff is missing warmth and sincerity. I wasn't too hungry, and knew I didn't want to spend a lot on mediocre food, so I ordered a couple appetizers. We split the avocado rolls. Not bad. It came with three split in half, for a total of 6 (sort of...) and a dipping sauce. I also ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad aka caprese. This was nothing like the simple Italian dish. There were only a couple pieces of tomato which didn't have any flavor, and didn't seem fresh. It was basically mozzarella pieces with some spices and sauce. My friend got a salad which looked weak and not very fresh, especially for how steep the price is. $12 for shredded lettuce? There are sooo many better restaurants in Santa Rosa which have GOOD food. This place it all about presentation. It's baffling how people will pay for bad food and enjoy it!"
Mary E.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,2,,2.0,1/26/2013,I come here a lot and the food never fails to take forever to come out at this location. Service kinda sucks. I come for the desert
Stacy M.,"Healdsburg, CA",2,13,,2.0,6/6/2012,"Horrible to dine in...!! Ok @ bar area.. You wait a long time to get sat, put in your order and for your food to get to your table and when it gets to your table its cold and or something is wrong with your dish! They should have year experienced staff in the kitchen and serving from former BJ's restaurants!"
Heather D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5,27,2,3.0,4/6/2014,"I'm not sure what some of the people are expecting when they come here, but in my opinion, this place is one step above chilis. It's a chain restaurant, so you can go to any of them and expect the same style of food. The food here isn't awesome, but it's not as bad as some of these people make it out to be. Just assume you're not getting gourmet food, and order a beer! Or some of their delicious non-alcoholic selection (free refills, which you'll rarely find at any other places) like cream soda or root beer. (This was great when I was pregnant) Some of the food I've had here has been great! The fried artichokes are quite yummy! But if you're seeing something that sounds fancy, don't expect too much. (Though I've had the pork chop and it was great!) But definitely good for inexpensive bar style food and great if you have kids, cause no one even notices them making noise when the whole restaurant is loud and crazy too! I come here for fun with friends! 3 stars for pretty good food, good value, and family friendly."
John S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,11,,4.0,12/3/2012,"I enjoyed the food. It's not the cheapest, but the portions are large and satisfying. Our server was friendly and accommodating. No complaints from me, I will certainly be back. 4 stars, because while it was certainly not the best, it was still quite good."
James M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/13/2012,Waited 2 hours to be seated and was moved around a few times. Food took another hour and was undercooked. Some food came 20 minutes after the first group and the appetizers came last. 1 person got sick and others felt terrible.
Pete B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,36,,2.0,6/30/2012,Not impressed. Reminded me of a place in las Vegas. Big fancy decor with colorful lights on walls. Only tried the pizza and didn't think it was any better than pizza hut pan pizza. Save your money and go to old Chicago pizza in Petaluma. Only positive was the dessert.
Doc Y.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/14/2012,"Got charged twice! $65.00 A month later????? Call manager he questioned me! Oh let me double check, I'll call you back. Been a week never heard from him! Going to dispute it.   Advise check your statements to make sure they don't steal from you!!!!!!!!!"
Sophia L.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,49,,3.0,6/14/2012,"I have eaten at the Terra Linda restaurant, and yesterday at Coddingtown. My cheeseburger was delicious, and I was able to substitute fries for a caesar salad - at no extra charge. At lunch time, the music was way too loud and I asked the manager to turn it down. She said she turned it down a little but corporate told the stores how loud to play it. Really? I can understand loud music in Friday and Saturday night, but lunch?  On another note, the servers were very attentive."
