Rachael Z.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/24/2017,Tina was an awesome server! We came in late and she took super good care of us! I've had really bad service at BJs but not with Tina. Every time I come in I will be requesting her! Thank you for an awesome night! Also $3 pizookies are always awesome.
Robert K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",36,1,1,5.0,7/12/2017,The food is pretty good but always late. Tonight we got our appetizer after the dinner was served. Once again the evening was saved by one of the servers named Gary Micheal. He has such a great sense of humor and really attentive. He made us feel important and welcome. He was able to save the evening by being caring and sincere. We will come back but I think we will call and make sure he is working. BJs need more just like him.
Paul B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,25,,3.0,10/1/2017,"You never know what you are getting here. Sometimes decent , sometimes not so good. Seems like it always takes awhile to get food. Better options in town for standard bar food and beer."
Christine C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/23/2017,"I really wanted a burger.  We were both off on a Thursday afternoon. We decided to drive to Santa Rosa to pick something up for the house and have a late lunch. Someone had recommended Jack's Urban Eats for a burger. They don't have burgers.  So we went to BJ's. When we walked in there were a few people in there. The hostesses were busy with something between them but we were seated without issue.  Our server arrived and did her job offering a variety of beverages. She brought the ice tea and it was sad. It was water with a hint of tea. It was just standard tea, not one of the fruit ones. We did try one of the others and it was equally bland. Eh, not a big deal, just disappointing.  The salad came out and we made a mistake in not inspecting the cutlery when we unwrapped them. Imagine our surprise/disgust when you take a bite of your salad and find some glob of brown, stuck on goo on your fork. The fork that was in your food... and in your mouth. Set the fork aside and wait for our server. She walks up and we start to ask for a new fork. Without missing a step or stopping to acknowledge what was being said, she grabs the fork and continues to walk away. We never even finished ""could we please have...""  Ok.... in the mean time, someone else brings our food. She comes back and takes the salad bowl and asks if we need anything during her flyby.  We asked for no avocado because of an allergy. When we asked for it, we paused and waited for acknowledgement because it's important. Not to be difficult.  At this point, not really surprised to find avocado in the food.  We want to believe that maybe it's just an oversight as it's been communicated to several people that avocado is not wanted. So we put it on a napkin and set it aside.  ""Would you like more tea?"" Sure! I think I'm behind on my water consumption for the day. Surprisingly, the refill on the tea is dark. Completely changes the color of a glass that was still over half full. Dark, actual tea. No comment on the watery glass brought originally.  ""Did you get your salad?"" I guess she didn't remember bringing or removing it from our table.  We just want to leave. The avocado is removed with comment.  The Burger was good. The experience was awful.  ""Do you want dessert?""  No. Please.  This was 2 hours past lunch rush. Our section was pretty empty. We paid our bill plus 15%.  It was a beautiful day during the week. We left feeling dejected. Thankfully a side trip afterwards restored our appreciation of the day and our happiness."
Rachelle S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",35,139,1051,2.0,5/19/2017,"There aren't many places in Santa Rosa for late night food, but thankfully BJs serves their full menu until midnight....and they offer a full bar on top of the many beers on tap.  Their specialty is pizza- it's not fantastic but the menu is quite large and there should be something on it to accommodate anyone, even those of us who require gluten free items.  Huge restaurant, good for kids and large groups.  Happy hour pricing while games are on their huge televisions make it a pretty popular place to view sporting events."
Karley B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/10/2017,"Never refilled any drinks, even water, never cleared the table. Bad service. Everyone else was eating and once we were done my friend was still waiting for her food. Then it came and it was the wrong thing. Horrible."
Rich B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,6,,1.0,3/10/2017,Currently sitting waiting for my son's dessert which will finally end the terrible experience. First off our waitress was great. She was attentive and did her best when her staff was not pulling their weight.  We ordered an appetizer then about 5 minutes later put in our dinner order. About 20 minutes later our dinners came and no appetizer. We asked to just take it off the bill but she gave it to us for free anyway. My burger had obviously been sitting as it had lost its warmth by bite number 3. The shredded cheese wasnt even melted on top and made the whole thing just awful. On the  plus side the fries were good.  This is just an awful experience and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone even if they just want a quick because this place is anything but quick.
Shawn F.,"Santa Rosa, CA",21,5,3,1.0,8/23/2017,"I went to this restaurant with my parents and girlfriend for an early birthday dinner for my girlfriend. If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would in a heartbeat. This was probably my worst experience at any restaurant in my 23 years of life. We started off great with our waitress who seemed very sharp and on-top of everything; getting out drinks on time, and checking in on us. The issues began when we ordered and received our food. My girlfriend is allergic to cilantro and she looked at the selection of tacos on the menu and noticed the salmon tacos not listing cilantro as being one of the ingredients to them, whereas the other three taco items did list it. She received her tacos with tons of cilantro on it. So much that it was impossible to get all of it off. The waitress came back out five minutes later and we all told her that the salmon tacos doesn't have cilantro listed as an ingredient which she agreed and said that it shouldn't have been on the item in the first place. She took it back and said she'll make sure the item doesn't have any cilantro on the new batch. Sometime later she came back with the salmon tacos and it all looked fine, no cilantro in sight. I had to get to work, so my girlfriend and I left right after we got her item. Now, it is partially our fault for not checking every nook and cranny for cilantro, but just like the waitress said to begin with, cilantro should not be on these tacos in the first place. I got to work and saw a message from my girlfriend with some photos attached with what else but, you guessed it, cilantro. It's a good thing that she checked every section of the tacos or else she would have been in trouble. I'll attach the photos to the review, but what it looks like and from her description is that the cilantro was underneath everything else, sort of looking like they tried to hide it. The reason why I say ""hide it"" is because the last salmon tacos they had brought out had cilantro on top of everything else. I'm not saying they did this intentionally, but when someone tells you they have an allergic reaction to a certain ingredient; you best not put that item on their order. What if she had not checked and taken a bite of it? That is just sickening that a big chain like BJ's would do this and I highly suggest you change your ways in how you manage your establishment in Santa Rosa, CA because you would think they would know better. Oh, and I'm not done there. When I told my parents that cilantro was still on the tacos, they went back to talk to a manager. They spoke to the duty manager, Ali who honestly couldn't care less. I don't know if this was just an inexperienced manager or not, but something as serious as someone being allergic to an item and having the item still be on the food they ordered could be a serious lawsuit if that person ended up eating this food. I had hoped for a better response from a manager at a chain restaurant and I also hope the higher up manager and/or owner of the location in Santa Rosa, CA takes a look at this review because this could have been a VERY serious issue if someone consumed food they were allergic to without knowing. This isn't a ""not-so-serious"" issue like you guys getting my drink order wrong, instead it's something that could pose a threat to someone's life. Please get some quality control in your establishment BJ's because you can seriously injure someone if you continue your ways."
Chase H.,"Vallejo, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/8/2017,"We ordered 3 items. We mentioned how our Thur is item was ordered an hour prior and we were told it would be out soon and given an apology. 15 minutes later, we asked our waitress again. She sadly said the manager was supposed to come talk to us, but the manager never saw us. We also didn't get out water refilled in the hot and a half we were here waiting for an order that never came. Even when we asked for the bill to leave, no manager. Terrible."
Osvaldo P.,"Bodega Bay, CA",0,2,,3.0,10/9/2017,"I don't understand how you can turn a great cut of meat and make it taste like beef jerky. I ordered the prime rib special on a busy Saturday night.  Although I was expecting the cut of meat to come out overcooked (as this location has done in the past with burgers and steaks), I never imagined it would have the consistency of a rubber pork chop. I found myself rushing through the meal because I just wanted to get through it. I didn't want to bother the waiter as everyone was extremely busy. The only two things that kept me from giving one star were the pizookie which never disappoints at any BJ's locations and the server. I can't remember his name, but he had star pins on his collar."
Todd S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,27,2,2.0,12/27/2017,"We continue to give this place a chance but the service and food are never consistent. It's like gambling when you go here. Last night was a perfect example. Wasn't that busy and got seated right away. Wife ordered the calamari to start. As this is usually always cooked perfectly. Four minutes after ordering the waiter comes out with calamari. No way it was cooked that fast especially since it was warm, not hot and it was rubbery. Must of been sitting from a another persons order. The waiter was great and had it taken off. His overall service was very attentive and great until the end. The rest of the food comes for dinner except the the food servers forgot to bring for my wife's soup. One of the kids sides don't come as ""they were still cooking the fries"" but the other kids meal had the fries. ??? After we tell the waiter he said no problem he goes and gets both and then five minutes later one of the food servers shows up with the bowl soup. Poor communication and organization. Not a big deal at this point with the appetizer being taking off so we weren't  to much to be upset with everything. The rest of the food was hot and fresh.  He brings the  to go boxes and the bill. I expect to be out of here pretty quick at this point right. Wrong!!! I put my credit card in the bill fold and stand it up for the waiter grab it. We proceed to spend 15 more minutes watching him walk past us 8 times and touch base with all his other tables while ignoring us. I walk up to the hostess to asked to pay my bill upfront. She says oh you're waiter will takes care of that. I tell her I've been waiting for 15 minutes. She goes on to say I will let him know know go ahead and sit down he will be right there. I wait five more minutes he walks by two more times and I finally have to hand him the bill as he's walking away for me. Very rude and a poor way to end the night. Like I said you never know what you're going to get here."
Alissa T.,"Penngrove, CA",0,9,10,1.0,12/7/2017,"TERRRRRIBLE service. Went to dinner tonight with my family, and we got the most awful service possible. Didn't even have silverware, forgot multiple items and my dad didn't even get his food at all. It took 30 minutes to even get someone's attention to come help us. The waitress seemed to be intentionally ignoring us. I'm not sure if it was laziness or lack of customer service but regardless we will not be back. This place has gone down the drain and our family dinners will be taken elsewhere. I would never recommend coming here unless you want terrible service and to be completely disappointed."
Ashley S.,"Laguna Beach, CA",172,1,,5.0,10/6/2017,"I had an amazing experience here! Justin was an awesome server who made an effort to ensure that we got everything we wanted to get. He was excellent with giving advice on what to order, and was very prompt and professional! Thank you for the great service!"
Patrick I.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,5,,2.0,12/6/2017,"I should have read the reviews before thinking of coming here...... Really disappointed with my experience here.  My wife and I stopped by without a reservation last Friday night.  We realized they'd be busy and we'd probably have a bit of a wait.  As we approached the person at the front, she immediately picked up the phone and didn't acknowledge our presence.  Another employee came up beside her and 2 ladies standing BEHIND us were called over and she assisted them.  Wow!  When she was done with these 2 customers, the employee then called on another couple behind us and assisted them as well.  We were feeling pretty much ignored.  I went over to stand in front of her when she was done with the last couple and she turned her back on me and started talking to another employee!  The only thing I can think of is, my wife and I were the only non-whites in the line.  I guess our kind isn't welcome here.  I looked at my wife and we both pretty much had it so we left.  Reading some of the reviews, though, I guess we didn't miss much.   On a more positive note, we ended up going to a restaurant across the street from the mall, and the difference was amazing in terms of the service.  We were treated with kindness and respect and the food was awesome.  Thanks our terrible experience at BJ's, we found a new favorite across the street from BJ's! Additional note:  The manager commented and apologized almost immediately and I thought that was really nice of him.  I am adding a star for his response."
Dylan K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",37,1,,5.0,10/4/2017,"Came for pizookis, left with a wholesome experience. Our waiter Justin was very engaged and was prepared to serve us with is rainbow of pens at the ready."
Matt P.,"Penngrove, CA",102,1,,5.0,10/4/2017,"I came to BJs tonight to fill my stomach with a juicy burger and a perfectly cooked Pazooki, left with a warm feeling in my stomach, not only from my delicious food but from the impeccable service from my server Justin. Justin did an amazing job and more than elevated my experience here and solely because of him, I intend to return."
Samantha B.,"McKinleyville, CA",131,10,,5.0,10/4/2017,This is one of the best locations I have ever been to. Our server Justin was absolutely amazing and was very accommodating to out large party. Will definitely be returning back in the future!
Shayna O.,"Rohnert Park, CA",46,47,10,3.0,3/14/2017,"I've been here many times and the service has always been decent.  However, every time I've visited, it's been a busy  night.  The longest we've had to wait for a table was 20 min. Decent. I've never had a bad experience here. The food has always been pretty good, but a bit pricey for what you get. I must give props to a restaurant for being honest when they say they serve ""Kraft Macaroni and Cheese"" on the kid's menu.   I like their calamari and California flatbread pizza.  My husband has enjoyed the jambalaya once before.  Our most recent visit, about a week ago (I checked in with my tasty sangria) it was not bad, but also not as good as we've experienced.  Yes, the wait for food was a while, but it was a Saturday night.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, medium, but it was way over done. Definitely not medium, but I didn't complain.  Our order was served hot and ready to eat.  Husband says the jambalaya was VERY salty this time around.  Child enjoyed her mac & cheese.  Really can't complain, much.  We did notice that the floor was rather greasy throughout the restaurant. The bathroom was a tad messy, and there seemed to be a lot of staff roaming/standing around.  I'm sure we'll be back in the future, as we have yet to have a bad experience like most of the reviews here."
Jill D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",90,14,,1.0,12/2/2017,Went to have dinner and a drink or two at the bar last Thursday night. Bartenders are quick to get you a drink after ordering it but it took more than an hour and 20 minutes to receive food after ordering it. Bartender never apologized for the long wait or asked how our dinner was. Food was mediocre at best. I think their only concern is serving as many drinks as they can to you. There was a couple next to us that should not have been served any more drinks as they were extremely intoxicated. Perhaps ABC needs to get involved and bring decoys in to investigate. I will not be returning to BJ's Brewhouse as there are far too many responsible local restaurants with great food and exceptional service. So long BJ's.
Emily L.,"Alameda, CA",1,16,,1.0,12/28/2017,Both times I've been here it was a very subpar experience but when we went for lunch today it was really bad. The waitress was clearly very flustered but rather than making an effort to improve her service she just kept apologizing which slowly lost weight as things got worse and worse throughout the meal. We had young children with us and not only did our food take a very long time but the kids were served about 10 minutes after the adults and my sons food seemed like it sat for a while since his fries were cold by the time the plate got to us. We had to ask three different people for condiments because it took her about 20 minutes to bring vinegar for my dads fish and chips. I had to ask twice for boxes for our food to go. We probably spent well over an hour there and by the end we just wanted to get out of there but had to be direct about it since e writhing took forever. I have lots of compassion as I've worked in food service before but this was beyond horrible. It's too bad because we love BJs but this location is really lacking in many ways.
