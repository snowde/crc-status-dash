Connie H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",2,9,4,4.0,5/22/2012,"We were a party of 9 last night...on a Monday night which ended up being a long night due to the wait, but I give that up to being a newly opened (one week) restaurant.  They have a few kinks to work out but over all, the waitress (Linda) was great!  I ordered the chicken chopped salad, my husband ordered the steak salad and others ordered various pizzas, steak, etc...we had it all it seemed.  We ordered two of the appetizer combo,  which was out of this world.  LOVED it!  We loved all the food...no complaints.  My husband and his friends ordered the Hopstorm beer which they all loved!!!  We loved sampling several different beers.  Because of our wait being kind of chaotic the manager (Jeff) came over and apologized and went over and above what he needed to do to make it right with us.  I love the fact that even being a new restaurant, he took the time and acknowledged where they had failed and made it right with us.  Way to go, Jeff!!!  We will be back."
Stephanie T.,"Forestville, CA",0,16,,4.0,7/22/2012,"Overall I was happy. My party and I are pretty picky about the places we eat and we both enjoyed our food and especially the beer (The Piranha pale ale!) We shared the fried artichoke hearts and each had a salad. Unfortunately our flatbread appetizer came after the salads but by then we were full so we took it to go. (By the way, it was tasty!) The service was also very good. I'll definitely be back."
Dean S.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/14/2012,Food was okay - but the place was much too noisy.  Couldn't talk to friends across the table without yelling.
Ric N.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,6/23/2012,Went there for dinner with my wife. ordered 2 pizzas and they were both cold. Sent them back and the next 2 were cold also. They told us that we could have a cookie desert for the trouble they put us through then never brought it to us.(we were there probably close to  2 1/2 hours total.) The waitress said the manager would comp us for the first 2 cold pizzas(which we had sent back) but still charged us for the next 2 cold pizzas.(so we got comped for nothing!!)The place was in choas and disorganized. They charge alot for some pretty poor food. I have to say there are alot of better places to spend your time and money for lunch or dinner in sonoma county. If you make a mistake you make it right with the customer or they don't return. We will not be returning to BJ's
Nick S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,20,,1.0,8/14/2013,"Party of four ordered calamari, avocado wraps, ribs, angus pot roast sandwich, California flat bread pizza and chicken pasta and side salad calamari tasted very fishy and was like chewing on chunks of tires , the avocado wraps were mealy salty and oily , ribs were dry and salty, pot roast was half cold half warm way too salty, pizza was burnt and dry and last of all the pasta was completely over cooked mush. The waitress was more concerned about waiting on and talking to what seemed to be her bf then actual paying customers. Wish I would of checked yelp first and not after coming here. Everything was pretty pricey including the 10 dollar drinks that were watery other then all that it was a clean and nice looking restraint won't be back especially after. Checking the reviews of the bjs 25 miles away in Novato.  You will definitely feel more satisfied going to a local Denny's or jack in a box"
Jackie I.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/14/2012,"Everything from start to finish was a disaster with a smile.  Call ahead doesn't work, the clock started ticking when we walked in and we waited  almost a half hour which means with the call ahead  one hour for a table.  Drinks were late for the meal and not how we ordered them.  One entree came just as we began to eat our appetizers and was saved and reheated when it was time for all the entrees.  Another entree didn't come at all and they had to be reminded of it.  My steak was flavorless and tough.  Drinks for the entree portion of the meal came when we were almost done.  Water and ice tea were never refilled.  One appetizer was wrong and we were to exasperated to even tell anyone at this point.  If you don't care about this review, at least make sure you don't sit at the table next to outdoor seating because every time the door opens, which is a lot, the sun shine will blind you.  The beer is good and the food is Denny's quality.  To get any help at all we felt like we were on a phone tree of a corporate office, no one we talked to could really make a difference.  The manager came over and apologized for the two entrees and compt them for us.  Sorry, with everything else it felt like to little to late.  Going out to dinner just isn't supposed to be this frustrating."
Scott D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/19/2013,"Checked in with hostess, got the little light-up thingie, sat down. After 20 minutes or so, we noticed that they had seated everyone but us including everybody who had come in after us.  Went up and asked the hostess why, she seated another group and then explained that our 'ticket had been misplaced'. She told a woman to seat us and we went with her. We asked her if she knew what had happened, she explained that they had not forgotten about us but that there had been 'some missed communication' and that they ""would have gotten around to you eventually."" Comforting.  We then were introduced to our (female) server, then a guy came over and told us he would be our server instead because he ""didn't have any tables"" and ""was bored"". We finally got to order and our food was not bad. Our drinks were actually very good. But nobody there even uttered the word ""sorry"" for having forgotten about us, much less offered a reasonable explanation as to why. They just did *not* care.  The food and drinks were okay but the incompetence and complete indifference of the staff will prevent us from making a second visit."
Amber G.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,2,,1.0,6/8/2012,"I have waited on tables before, so I am VERY understanding of sometimes slow service, and not everything going perfect when being out to eat. That said, going to BJ's in Santa Rosa was the WORST dining experience of my life. We waited way over the the time we were told. When we were seated we were still in good spirits. It took a while but a server  made his way over and took our drink and appitizer order. At this point still good spirits.  It took a good 20 minutes to get our 3 fountain drinks, and 15 more to get our appitizers. I asked for a straw for my drink and never got one. Our sever seemed to be very occupied with all h is other tables or not around. At one point he left another table's credit card slip at our table. After 40 minutes of more waiting  for our meals, they finally arrived. Our sever skipped out on us and luckily left us with one who new what she was doing. Even then, the food was not great, and luke warm. During all our waiting we were unable to flag anyone to help us. At one point we asked an employee to check on our food, she said to ask our server......"
