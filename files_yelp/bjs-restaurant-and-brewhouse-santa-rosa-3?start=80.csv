Ryan D.,"Mill Valley, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/24/2017,"WORST SERVICE IN SONOMA COUNTY! Went last night to celebrate my birthday.  It took 30 mins for our app,  Delivered only half our drinks, We waited 1.5 hours for our dinner,  They both were prepared wrong,  and they never delivered my birthday pazokie which we ordered. However, the manager took off the app. Whooppe The management sucks at their job. As we waited, we watched many other workers stand around talking and joking around. Including the manager. While the kitchen, other staff were struggling to make it all happen. Having worked in the industry for many years, I see the lack of leadership and team work the staff needs. We were polite and made light of it, we were trying to celebrate. But when everything is screwed up, it doesn't help us enjoy the moment. Go have a KILLER burger or another dish at the Whole foods tap room instead. Its much better."
Aliya H.,"Sebastopol, CA",0,4,1,1.0,11/19/2017,"I have always loved BJs until the other night when we had the worst service in history. When we were seated it took 15mins for our waitress to come talk to us. When we ordered drinks we waited 10mins for drinks. After our order was placed it took 45mins for our food to come out. We had calamari as an appetizer and it was chewing, cold and majorly greasy. After complaining and being told it would come off our bill they never removed it. Finally we got their attention and got it removed. After handing them my credit card it took another 15mins to get my card back to me after it was charged. We spent less time eating then waiting for our food or bill. Absolutely horrible experience and service."
Samantha R.,"Santa Rosa, CA",53,139,35,3.0,2/8/2017,"It's a chain restaurant, nothing really special about it. Service tends to be slow, and it can get pretty packed. Foods ok, but nothing really stands out."
Bianca M.,"Rohnert Park, CA",48,131,,4.0,8/16/2017,"I have been to Bjs only 3x maybe 4. Its nice for a nice dinner with family. Its on the $$ side but probably not much more than places like Black Bear if you want to keep it down. The pazookies are great and easy to share. My son had a birthday dinner here and they put a candle in the pazookie for him. The food was good. Theres TVs around showing sports but theres enough room a person not wanting to watch would feel infringed upon. Seating is comfy. Wait staff was nice. Service was fairly quick. I ordered a cobb salad w/o meat and it was served wirth pieces of bacon (looking like itd been put on mistakenly then attempted to be removed unsuccessfully) When I mentioned it to the waitress she nicely asked if I wanted it redone. I felt bad but I really didnt want bacon flavored salad (being a vegetarian & all) and she didnt make me feel bad. The new salad was ready very quickly too (and bacon free, I checked)"
Ashton K.,"Petaluma, CA",55,6,4,5.0,4/21/2017,First off... we came here with 4 men who have been drinking lol so they were hungry !!!!!  Tiffani was the most amazing Sever we've had here EVER!!!!  We got everything fast and tasted amazing! Great customer service !!!! We will be coming back to see her !!!! Thank you!!!
Desi K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",1,12,,5.0,11/21/2017,Food and service much improved since 3 months ago when I swore I would never eat there again. I ate there last night and I actually was shocked to learn that it was Gina's first night serving. She was so friendly and professional. She stayed on top of our table. That was a first for me at BJ's. The food order came out right and the quality was perfect. So I want to say that BJ's has definitely improved in more ways than one. I will return.
Jason S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",17,270,2,1.0,12/24/2016,"Very slow service and way over priced. Ordered 10 mins ago still no food. Our party was only 2 people. It wasn't even that busy.  20 bucks for a 6"" pizza? No I'll go to round table.  Food was okay. Will not come back. After we got our food never saw the waiter again."
Danielle B.,"Rohnert Park, CA",206,1,,5.0,8/29/2017,Josh is the best server you guys have ever had. He went above and beyond to make sure I got marshmallows on my dessert. That's all! 11/10
Emily K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,9,,5.0,11/18/2017,"I honestly don't come here usually... Not my first choice of restaurants. But my loud, large, hungover family and I came in this morning, and our waitress Jordan did an awesome job taking care of us! Food was good, and she was super friendly and helpful."
Taylor G.,"Petaluma, CA",0,10,1,3.0,7/25/2017,"Used to go here all the time and loved it. However, my most recent experiences haven't been too swell. The first time my friends and I came in at 10:30 PM to get some appetizers and dessert and drinks before we went out (they closed at midnight). The server and chef literally only had three tables in the whole restaurant, and people at the bar. It took 35 minutes to get our food (which was all appetizers) and a lot of it was cold... And they forgot a whole dish we ordered (mine). I would have loved to tell the server when he came back but he never did! Within 20 minutes, my friends were done eating and he brought the check by, so I never even got a chance to tell him they forgot my food. I asked him wait a sec, I looked at the check, and said ""I never got my food so can you please take it off the check"" and he said ""yeah, no problem"" without apologizing. Normally I would be super understanding if they were busy but they weren't busy at all.  I still give it three stars because they have great salads and pizookies. But lately I've been getting cold food, and not so great service."
Alex C.,"Oakland, CA",0,7,,3.0,7/24/2017,"Very large menu and a full bar.  Staff is pretty friendly.  However 9 times out of 10 they mess up the order, like several problems.  Rare steak comes as well done, they forget our sides, they burn the toast, etc.  The management is super helpful in fixing everything but it's super annoying that we always know there is going to be a problem."
Kelly C.,"Forestville, CA",3,6,1,1.0,6/26/2017,"Just had my last meal at BJ's. my wife and I ordered a deep dish pizza that turned out to be a regular pizza in a deep dish pan. Our server was totally lost, he messed up every table around us. I cannot see myself going back and giving them any more of my money."
Cindy I.,"Hidden Valley Lake, CA",20,16,2,5.0,11/5/2017,I don't know where the people who rated this restaurant one star truly ate but it wasn't here.  I've always had great service.  Today Kristin took care of us.  She was very attentive and professional.  We even complimented her to the Manager on Duty.  Food was also wonderful.  Don't pay attention to the social media Trolls.
Adam S.,"Healdsburg, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/9/2017,This is a great restaurant for the whole family.  The pizza is awesome and they have lots of stuff for kids.  We asked them about their cookie desert and they comped us 3 minis for us to try. Their GM was amazing and even gave us one of our kids meals for free.  Plus they have a full bar and good beer.  Will definitely go again.  Go restaurant for casual dining.  Even in wine country.  Will definitely go again
Roger Y.,"Martinez, CA",157,12,23,1.0,11/10/2017,We got seated fairly fast and the staff is very friendly.  It seems the back of the House has issues.  It is a three day weekend but a corporate restaurant like this should be able to handle the volume.  Why one stars?  Two out of three orders were wrong but with the long wait for two prime rib sandwiches and a burger with no bun.  Everything on the side.  Only the patty came and it was the size of a fifty cent piece.  When the sides came my friend was already done with his tiny burger patty. No bun is not a crazy request.  The two prime dip sandwiches came with a teaspoon of au jus each.  We asked for more and while writing still has not arrived.  Come on BJ's!  Our poor server. Had to make excuses for the kitchen and management.  They never came over.  Never brought au jus. More au jus please!  I hate writing negative reviews but... my green beans never came.  The fries in the photo are supposed to be green beans.  We got over charged for a baked potato that never came.  They knocked off $10.  But we were over charged.
Ali W.,"Sebastopol, CA",57,4,1,1.0,11/10/2017,"I just used the online ordering feature and was disappointed that I couldn't pay online. When I called the restaurant to ask if I could pay over the phone so my friend didn't have to when they picked up the food, I was told I could pay for the order in person or online (but it never gave me the online option). When I told the person that on the phone, he was going to put me through to the manager. He then forgot to get the manager for me and i had to wait on hold even longer. When he picked back up, he told me they didn't know what to do and I had to pay on pickup still. I told him that was kind of crappy since he said I could pay online and I couldn't, and he replied ""well.. have a nice night, we'll see you soon"". I never got to speak to the manager when I asked to and I will not be ordering through the online portion or returning to BJ's again. That was incredibly rude customer service."
Jim S.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,7,,5.0,11/10/2017,"Better than the food is the service.  Allison is wonderful and accommodating.  Chrissy is a super libation engineer, and Sean tries.  Thanks for the great football seasons."
Sarah B.,"Rohnert Park, CA",0,3,,3.0,8/27/2017,"I loved coming to BJ's for the pulled pork sandwich. It was really delicious. And the shoe string fries where my favorite.  Well my girlfriend and I rolled in today after coming back from the coast, sat down knowing what we were all ready going to get. Well, they changed the gluten free menu and they changed the pulled pork sandwich.  When the food came out, my girlfriends salad was really good for her and it looked so much better then my whimpy sandwich.  I'm gonna get picky. Pulled pork should be pulled Pork not lumpy, chunky, and hard to chew pulled pork. I was disappointed that it wasn't the same sandwich or anything really at all. The regular French fries were better then the damn sandwich.  Anyways fair be warned. I hope they change the recipe back. For reals."
Courtney B.,"Petaluma, CA",79,1,,5.0,8/26/2017,For the first time since this BJ's opened our waiter Sean B. Was the best most attentive one we have had yet. We told his manager Jake and gave him the credit he deserved. We ordered a pizza and pazooki's and the service was fast for a friday night
m b.,"Rohnert Park, CA",41,9,1,2.0,12/18/2017,I went there tonight Monday...because my 11 year old Foster Son picked the resturant for his Birthday dinner.  The food was good.  I had told the waitress it was his birthday right when we were ordering..she seemed a little put out when i changed my french fries to the sweet potato fries.  She told me how it was a pain to go back into this tablet she had to change an order. Then when she came back I told her again it was his birthday and she wasnt really even acknowledging it.  Then when we were done eating we were waiting for her return which was quite a while..We played hangman..i was trying to keep an 11 year old busy. When she arrived back she gave me the bill and again i had to tell her it was his birthday..by then i was upset at her service...she said oh does he want this certin desert and im all yes thats fine..thinking dont you already have it ready and shouldnt you have it right now ? So then we waited like 20 more minutes.  I saw her an called her over to the table finally and said you know i am very disappointed in your service we are leaving ...he never got the happy birthday resturant experience. ....pretty sad....
