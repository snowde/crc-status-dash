Lisa K.,"The Woodlands, TX",231,965,2392,5.0,10/28/2017,"Awesome waiter services. We came in with a party of 8 to watch several of the games! Penn state & Astros!  There is no bad viewing seat! There are flat screens in every corner. Great spot to watch the games.  We had such a great time and no one rushed us out, even though there were people waiting to be seated. A whooping 5 hours at BJ Brew. We spent so long here, we had 2 waiters and more drinks and food! Great night! Thanks for showing excellent customer service and welcomed large parties!! Go Astros!"
Natasha L.,"Spring, TX",248,83,54,2.0,9/4/2017,"I haven't had BJs in a good couple of years and was craving their pizza and pizookie badly. So decided to satisfy my craving. Eh.  There was group of 4 of us. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, buffalo chicken pizza and pizookie. Our dip came with stale chips. That's one. Our pizza, was low on the toppings- no celery for sure and one of the slices was literally just bread with some sauce and cheese. Now the pizookie... this is where I really got upset... Chips being stale, fine. Pizza short on ingredients, fine. But then we're informed that they were out of chocolate chip cookies! That's the real sad bad. After much crying and cursing, we went with the macadamia nut pizzokie. It was aite.  Our waiter- he was MIA for most of everything. He asked how we liked our food and I told him it wasn't what I was expecting and not that happy. Instead of sending over the manager, he handed me the bill. Oh get this, they didn't even comp for the stale chips!  Next time I am craving a pizzookie, I'll stick to making it at home."
Tatiana S.,"Spring, TX",71,44,97,5.0,11/7/2017,"We went recently and sat at the bar on a Wednesday night. Not sure if floor service has improved but the bar service was great. The bartender that night(musclular, mature looking fella) was very nice. Always had our glasses full and even got us a pazookie on the house! Will being going back and only sit at the bar top."
Penny W.,"Spring, TX",49,13,2,1.0,12/18/2017,"Bad Food Experience at BJs last night.  We wanted deep dish pizza and were at Porto Fino so we went there. It was the worst food I've had in  a long time.  Avacado Rolls: mushy outer roll, avocado mushy and brown, no flavor. Didn't eat it.  Wedge Salad (didn't think you could make a bad one but they succeeded): hunk of iceberg  -not even sliced into a wedge - with outer layers wilted - not crispy with a few TBSP. of toppings.  Pizza: ordered a Deep dish Veg pizza w half chicken. It arrived with full chicken. Sent it back. Next one came as ordered. One bite and I was done. Yuck. Mushy crust. I suspected there was no sauce so I scraped the the toppings off my piece. No sauce AND No cheese. I scraped the toppings off the whole pizza - same thing!  We called the server over (who was very good) and showed the Pizza to her and she was embarrassed. She said there was a new Pizza chef who thinks he makes the best ever. I requested she take the pizza and show it to him and suggested he re-think his idea of ""best Pizza ever."" The Mgr. came, I explained our whole food experience and told him we were long time customers but will not be returning. He offered weak apology and walked away. No effort to rectify things whatsoever.! We had to ask the server to take the pizza off the bill. No other comps. Unbelievable. So sad. We went to Russos as we were still hungry and to satisfy our Pizza craving .  This BJs location lost 10+ year customers.. Russo's and  Crust  will keep us returning."
Matthew C.,"Southwest Houston, Houston, TX",124,1,,5.0,1/10/2018,"This is my favorite bjs to go to, every Time I dine here I get good service and fast food. You could even eat here on your lunch break, never have to ask for a refill, staff is always on top of it"
Jen D.,"Houston, TX",229,9,1,1.0,1/9/2018,"I do a lot of catering for my job and I used this restaurants online website to place a catering order for pickup 24+ hours in advance. I received a confirmation email saying my order was placed. When I arrived at 11am the next day (when my order was supposed to be ready) they didn't even have the order and gave some excuse that the 11am pick up time is the reason it wasn't received? Ok so why would the system even allow 11am as an option? I spoke to the manager and he never apologized or even offered to comp. anything from my order. Needless to say, I was 30 minutes late to bring my customers lunch. I spend at least $200/day on catering and my money will definitely be spent somewhere more reliable with better service."
Indira M.,"Kingwood, TX",18,45,31,3.0,12/14/2017,I had the broccoli cheese soup and I have to say it was way over salted. I added the beet and goat cheese salad from the appitizer menu and that was lovely.  My friend had the chicken lettuce wrap and the nibble I tasted was really good.  I also thought that the wine was overpriced and thus the OK rating.  Our server was good but a bit slow.
Brendi F.,"College Station, TX",188,1,,5.0,1/5/2018,"Great food, great service!! Ask for Corey!! He is my favorite server! He is very attentive and has a great attitude! Everyone is so helpful and the food tastes great! Make sure you don't leave without getting a pizookie! They're delicious!"
Kevin V.,"Spring, TX",45,134,257,1.0,4/3/2017,This is a review based on take out...  Service 1 out of 10 Food 6 out of 10 when the order is correct which is very rare.  I would say if you do dine here please don't do take out unless it's pizza. any other order you get even if it's not modified it's highly probable that it will be wrong. Another thing is don't pay online because they won't be able to find your check. I ordered a Chipotle Glazed salmon and it came dry as a bone with 0 sauce and it was highly disappointing. I give this place chances time and time again but it's definitely time to sell the stock and if I eat here it'll be out of late night dine in desperation.
Suzanne M.,"Conroe, TX",0,17,,1.0,12/26/2017,"My family eats at this restaurant a lot. However, the last 4 times to be exact have been bad. I order potato skins and their tortilla soup. Tonight they brought the potato skins out burnt they had little to no cheese they forgot to add bacon and no chives, so disappointing. My soup was luke warm. My husbands chicken wings did nothing for him. Needless to say we won't be back again. I can check another restaurant off my list. They have consistently gone down hill and tonight the potato skins were the deal breaker. See ya never BJs brewery."
S B.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2018,"Absolutely horrendous experience.  Terrible waiter, terrible manager,  terrible food. The worst customer service I have ever had at a restaurant."
R X.,"Conroe, TX",0,14,,2.0,12/22/2017,"We went on a Friday night and were seated pretty quickly.  The menu I got was sticking together as if the plastic had recently been wiped down but not allowed to dry.  The salt shaker was greasy.   The avacado egg rolls were rather flavorless and I didn't care for the sauce that came with it.  We weren't given plates for the appetizer and asked our rather scatterbrained waitress for some.  When they arrived, one of the plates was wet and another one had stuck on dried food. I got the baked ziti which was pretty good.  One person in our group got a chicken dish which she said was room temperature and not hot.  Overall, average food with horrible service that's twice what I would expect to pay."
Whitney H.,"Spring, TX",75,8,5,5.0,12/22/2017,The manager did contact me and send me a generous gift card. I appreciate the company rectifying the situation. My husband and I look forward to going again without kids. Thank you BJ's
Sneha B.,"Houston, TX",1,3,,1.0,1/5/2018,"Not sure if they changed their menu... food SUCKS, no flavor at all. The service was subpar, definitely not coming back."
Catherine S.,"Conroe, TX",0,4,,4.0,11/6/2017,"Good food, service, clean and friendly!  We met friends, we all had different hamburgers, I had the Black and Blue,my hubby had BJs, Brewsterburger fries are taste, and the beer is good!"
Vanessa R.,"West New York, NJ",130,18,14,5.0,12/8/2017,Service was fast and friendly. Our server Robert gave us some great recommendations. My fave was the Parmesan crusted chicken! Will definitely be back.
Karyn K.,"The Woodlands, TX",271,463,2372,3.0,10/2/2016,"I love late nite dining and bevvie options.  I haven't been to BJs in years .. on the plus side they're consistent and not much has changed...Standard fare, good beer, friendly staff. For this late nite adventure.. selected from the healthy options on the menu...  Brussels sprouts (while not healthy) were meh, chicken Mediterranean tacos good and  the side dish not so much and the seafood tacos (I was told) were ok but for me.. total turn off as they smelled like a can of cat food. Looking for a late night dining joint .. this may be your place!"
Joseph P.,"Houston, TX",2,14,1,5.0,10/9/2017,"We haven't been to BJ's in a long time. So we decided to go in for a late lunch. The menu has changed since we last saw it. There were a lot of new items. We ordered a couple of appetizers. My wife got the Sriracha brussels sprouts and I ordered the bar house meatballs. Both were very delicious! I highly recommend them :-) Our waitress was super nice, and the general manager came to our table and visited for a minute which was also really nice. I'm liking this BJ's. And I will definitely be back soon."
Audra H.,"San Diego, CA",66,234,361,4.0,3/27/2017,"Yummy bleu burger!! I've been here twice within the past year from out of town when I visit my best friend. The bleu burger has been AMAZING both times.  The bacon was crispy in all the right places and the bleu cheese was aged to perfection. Loved the roll (tad of butter and toasted to perfection), as well as the glob of mayo on top.  It came with fries which were actually kinda salty, but decent nonetheless.  I'd definitely stop by here and give it a try!!"
Nikki S.,"Houston, TX",5,438,975,1.0,8/26/2017,"I love BJ's restaurants but I will never go back here again. The worst part was when melted cheese and mushrooms were stuck to the skillet on my smores peanut butter pizookie. The best part? When we asked for a box and our waitress returned to throw dirty napkins from a different table onto our food and took it away. She said she would be right back with a box so she clearly heard us ask to take the leftover pizza home. I love their pizza but this was the worst I've had at any location, half of the pizza was drenched in cheese while the other half had barely any. The service was terrible (even though it was almost an empty restaurant), and the food was just as bad."
Renee Y.,"Spring, TX",46,106,1,3.0,10/21/2017,Good food and drinks. The pizookies are great. The prices are just really high for what you get. I'm not against paying extra for an amazing meal but I felt it was the quality of Friday's but twice the price. The staff is really nice.
Raul B.,"Houston, TX",83,112,176,2.0,5/21/2017,"This place is horrible. Service is slow and inaccurate, we had to wait over 5 minutes to be seated when no one was at the restaurant because the staff was having a conversation. After we finally got seated it took another 10 minutes for someone to even show up, after repeating my order 3 times (she was obviously playing with her device) we had to wait an eternity for drinks and food to arrive. The food was really great! So that's why 2 stars."
Matt H.,"Oak Ridge North, TX",345,26,6,1.0,5/13/2017,"Went and ate there lastnight, we ordered are food and everybody got their meal except for Me. They took my food to the wrong table. I waited for 15 mins for them to bring my food out which wasn't that good. Then they couldn't even cut me a break on my food. It was there mistake and I'm the one who ended up paying for there mistake. I'm tired of spending my hard earned money to get not So great food and shitty service.and usually when a mistake is made like that a manager is notified and comes to the table but not in my case."
Jose R.,"Conroe, TX",0,2,,5.0,12/15/2017,"Came here with friends on a Friday night and the service and food was excellent. It's a nice place to come watch sports, talk, and get good food. Our waitress Courtney was very nice, she said it was her birthday so Happy Birthday!"
Elisa M.,"Baytown, TX",91,5,4,5.0,7/2/2017,We had a touchy first experience but the general manager as well as the two managers that we interacted with did all they could to make it right. We will definitely visit again
Bradlee T.,"San Antonio, TX",4,10,,1.0,2/13/2017,"We have been going to BJs for years in San Antonio and College Station and have accumulated a ton of points on their Premiere Rewards program. When we moved to Conroe, we adopted the Shenandoah location. For a while, everything was great. The past couple visits have been atrocious. We visited this Saturday at about 3:00pm. There were empty seats everywhere but we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. When you see this at a restaurant, you know its in trouble and you probably are if you chose to eat there. We did anyway.... First, when we were finally sat, no one greeted us forever. It took staring down the manager across the room to get her to come an get our drink order while our server hurried over to not get in trouble. When our drinks arrived, there was dried food caked to the bottom of the glass and food caked to our silverware as well. Disgusting. There was also food all over the floor and paper napkins still stuck in the booth.  When my salad arrived, there were all sorts of little pieces of food in it that were clearly from another dish. There was a green gookie substance and several noodles that did not belong.  Against my better judgment, we ordered a Pizookie because I had promised my son and is too young to understand if I didn't order it. We ordered when they brought our entree out and ended up still sitting there forever waiting. Once we were finished, we still waited forever to get out check.  This restaurant has gone down hill. We really love the concept and other restaurants in the chain so we keep giving it another chance, only to be disappointed every time. The same managers are always running around fixing problems, discounting checks, delivering food, and doing their employees work for them. Perhaps if they hired better servers and actually managed the restaurant, their restaurant would get back on track."
Allannie B.,"Spring, TX",0,4,1,1.0,6/3/2017,"I came here tonight with my family and had great service at the door but as soon as we were taken to our table it was another story.  Hannah (our server) didn't approach our table until 20 min after we were sat. This was after I asked one of the hostess' for some assistance as my table hasn't been approached for drink orders. She went ahead and took our drink and food orders which was very considerate of her. We had seen the girl working in the section we were sitting in pass us by many times helping out the table right next to ours. Not sure if there was a shift or section change and our server was not informed that we were hers to take care of but we were clearly next to the table she was helping out for quite some time. There was no apology from her.  When the food came to the table, we weren't asked how our food was until we were almost done and asked for the check. She finally apologized and said the server that had our table prior to her was cut and she wasn't informed. If we had been told ahead of time, this review wouldn't have been put on the yelp page. She avoided us the majority of the time as if we weren't there. Food is usually pretty consistent so I never have any complaints on their food. Service, on the other hand, wasn't the best. We were all annoyed with the whole situation. Service has never been an issue with this place until today."
Sour Prunes P.,"Houston, TX",2,61,42,5.0,2/22/2017,"First time trying their GF pizza and it was delicious! The crust tasted like regular pizza crust...very crispy and light. It went well with the pepperoni and jalapeño I got on it. The pizza sauce is one of THE BEST--so flavorful! The spinach artichoke dip is ohhh sooo deeeee-lish!!! Warm, creamy, melt in your mouth goodness!! Also had their freshly baked to order GF pizzookie with vanilla ice cream and it was soooooooo goooooooooood! It's been sooooo long since I had a fresh baked cookie!!!!! Will be back to try other items on the menu. BJs is rock solid food!!!!"
Maria Aimen F.,"Spring, TX",15,88,266,5.0,1/24/2017,"I can't believe I have written a review yet. Every time we have been here, we have great service, great apps (we like the mozzarella sticks, chips with queso, and the spinach dip), great vegetarian pizza with a really nice crust and cheese. Their strawberry lemonade is fantastic, as is the peach drink. The pizookie is awesome, as are the strawberry beignets. The Mac and cheese is good, but I don't like the salads that much. The pizza is the main thing we come here for, it's one of the best in the area."
Phil M.,"The Woodlands, TX",28,92,228,4.0,12/29/2015,"Took the family out for lunch. We tried five different dishes plus an appetizer. The restaurant was well lit, organized and clean and the staff were very friendly.  Cost wise you ask. The average item we saw on the menu was 10-12 dollars and the portions were good size. So you can bring the whole family out and not break the bank.  To start off we had the calamari appetizer which came with two sauces. We all (5) thought it was pretty good.  I had the pepperoni flatbread. It was good ... But ... You better seriously  love pepperoni because it comes loaded with it. $11 My wife had a salad. It looked ok, but I can't comment because real men don't order salad as a main course. It should only come as a side dish in my opinion.  My son had a sandwich with large cut fries (see pic) he thought it was great.  My daughter in law had the chicken Parmesan.  She loved it, but, looking at it I would have given it a just ok.  Lastly, my daughter had a burger with fries. It was quite large and she loved it. This is a burger place so if your a burger person your in luck here.  So overall the place was a win win, especially as a family place to go to. Good food at a fair price.  Check out the pics."
Desiree S.,"Houston, TX",0,10,3,2.0,8/26/2017,"I will start this review off by giving credit to my waitress, Kierra. She was really awesome and made my experience so much better than it would've been just based on the food alone. The salad was mushy on side with brown (she didn't bring it out, someone else did), the garlic green beans were meh, and the ribeye was lacking even salt or pepper. Thankfully she was a gem and brought me a new salad. I didn't say anything about the green beans until the end, but something tells me she would've done something about that too if I had told her. Good job hiring someone who has high energy and is great to her customers. Kierra rocked!"
Jenn F.,"Denton, TX",15,194,45,5.0,12/9/2016,"Varied menu. Lots to choose from. Great kids options. Full bar with craft beers which will suit anyone. Consistency among chains with menu, quality, ambiance, and waitstaff. Always happy with my visits. I have been to more than 15 sites now. This location is right by the outlet mall so I am sure it can get busy but they do have a call ahead/app feature which helps! Must try if you have not already."
Ann B.,"Kingwood, TX",24,14,,5.0,8/4/2017,"Great beer, and great service! Me and my son ate every bit after a long morning shopping on an empty stomach BJ's was perfect. Hoping to come back more often, I really missed coming here now that I no longer live in the area. Come to kingwood, BJ's!!"
Andrew W.,"Spring, TX",375,21,48,4.0,12/6/2016,"BJs has been a family staple for a long time now. I'm not really sure why it doesn't have a higher rating. The menu is huge and the waiters are (usually) top notch.  This time I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I almost never order chicken at restaurants and probably would have never picked this for myself, but one time my mother let me try hers and it had me foaming at the mouth. This meal is amazing!! For best results, substitute the mixed vegetables with Asparagus.  If you end up taking my recommendation please send me some yelp-cash...it's totally a real thing.  The avacodo egg rolls are still good but they now put siracha in them. It really takes away from the taste of the dish IMHO. They went from a 10 to about a 7. Still worth trying."
Natasha W.,"Deer Park, TX",34,1,,5.0,9/7/2017,We found our favorite waitress at BJs!! Brendi is the sweetest little thing around. She was so responsive.   You can tell she really loves her job! Great food and amazing service.  My husband and I love the atmosphere at BJ's.  It's a great place to watch the game and enjoy some cocktails. The parmesan chicken is delicious but my absolute favorite are the avocado egg rolls.  You will regret leaving without having a pizookie!
Ryan B.,"Spring, TX",3,21,3,2.0,7/15/2017,"Service is great. Food was not good. Had to send one entree , pulled pork was 80% fat. Asian chopped salad was ok. Manager was nice and apologetic. Took entree off bill and offered another entree at no cost. We declined. Maybe it was just an off day?"
Lucy G.,"Spring, TX",25,1,,5.0,8/14/2017,The waiter was so funny and helpful. He really made us laugh! The food was delicious and came out extremely fast!!
Chris S.,"Round Rock, TX",0,29,,1.0,10/8/2017,"Not sure why this bugs the crap out of me but it did!  Went there yesterday for a late lunch (party of 3)due to a band contest at the stadium across the street.  There was a group  of band kids (8) quietly waiting when we got there - our party was told 20 min wait.  Those band kids had already been there 15 min when we arrived.  As I looked around, I noticed a few large groups of the same band kids only they were seated with a band parent - the group of kids waiting  did not have a parent with them.  Now we are coming up on 40 min wait which means this group of very polite quiet band kids have been waiting almost an hour.   During this time, small groups were coming in and getting seated.... Not sure what was going on but the band kids finally had to leave.. OMG. I DO NOT  BLAME THEM - we followed them out.  I have to wonder if the mentality was "" they are just kids and no parent to speak on their behalf"" I'm sure if you offered 2 tables for 4 they would have jumped one that's!  Shame on you BJ's ... BTW: Your hostess could take a lesson in telling time and one in customer service.  Will not be seeing you next year!"
Jess G.,"Grand Junction, TN",0,39,141,2.0,9/24/2017,"Poor service. Waited 17 minutes to get a drink, ordered a cucumber mint and the waiter brought me a pink drink. When I told him it didn't look like a cucumber mint he gave me a funny look like he was confused. Didn't get any silverware or napkins until we were almost done with our appetizer. Told the waiter 2 times no onions on the pizza, what do we get? Onions on the pizza. Never checked on us after our food was delivered. The place also smelled strange, like a musty restroom. We won't be back."
Kerrancy C.,"Houston, TX",84,4,,5.0,7/25/2017,We go to BJ's frequently and every time Derek is our server he gives us outstanding service no matter how busy or slow it is.
