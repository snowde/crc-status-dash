Jae S.,"Houston, TX",131,254,575,5.0,10/15/2013,My favorite pizza place. The margarita flat bread pizza is perfect every time. I also always ask to make them a white peach mojito. It always picks me up from a bad day. In the summer the cornbread and summer salad is delicious.
Patricia M.,"Spring, TX",0,7,1,4.0,10/17/2015,"Okay, so I have a friend in from Holland who is leaving tomorrow.   All she's heard about for 3 months is Watermelon Mojitos at BJ's!!!  Couldn't wait to bring her here for one.  Showed up and was just told ""Oh sorry, that's not on the menu anymore.  They just changed the menu and they don't have the ingredients for it.  I think it's seasonal or something.""  So yeah, pretty disappointed since Watermelons are still being sold in stores.  I actually buy watermelon year round so I know they can get it.  I went ahead and ordered a Strawberry Mojito but I'm reluctant to get attached now that I know they don't keep their menu consistent.  Boooo!   I generally love this place.   The truth is I should have already written a good review for them.   But just like people usually do, we are quick to review what's wrong but slow to review what's right.  So with that consideration I'm going to say that I have loved this place.   TVs to watch sports, great atmosphere, comfortable booths, food is great and it's a convenient location.  Get the rewards card, it's a nice bonus. Put Watermelon Mojitos back on the menu please.  =)"
Jessica C.,"Spring, TX",5,3,,1.0,12/6/2014,If I could help it I would give it a -5 stars.   Seating for this place is a mess and makes no sense.  You tell someone your name for them to write a receipt for someone else to call your name which could be another 10 minutes even when it's not busy.  Strange.   Then you order.  As we ordered a small pizza.  It comes out not cooked inside and only on the outside.  Logically. If we say it isn't cooked.  The pieces on out plates are not cooked either.  Why would you only tKe back the part in the pan and just have the cooks just throw it in the oven to cook more and not ask us for the uncooked pieces on our plates also or just make a new one.  Or even call the manager to see us.  And charge us for everything knowing we were not satisfied.   It's very disheartening to me to see so many uncaring restaurants now who do not care about the customer.  Just there money.
Jeff W.,"Spring, TX",0,4,1,2.0,3/16/2015,"Love BJs but tonight was crap!!!!! First off. Asian chopped salad.  You need to add dressing to greens before dressing.  Not after ten minutes of asking to be brought to the table.  Secondly.  That flat bread pizza you charge$14 for are you freaking kidding me!!!!????   It does it have 12 serving pieces.  It is cut into 12 pieces.  There's a difference.   Thirdly, learn the difference between medium well to nuclear terd.  There's a difference.   That is all for now."
Sabeena C.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,2.0,7/29/2015,"Service was terrible from the start. I am not usually a critical customer, I know being a waiter is not an easy job, but we were completely neglected as if our business was a burden to our waiter.  My mom and I came in for lunch and were seated and given menus. No one came by to get our drink or food order, so we eventually asked a waiter from another table if they could get our waiter for us. The gentleman was nice enough to take our drink and food order and pass that along to our waiter, Robert (although we still had no idea who he was). Later, a female waitress brought out our appetizers without bringing us plates. She walked away so quickly, before we even had a chance to ask for some. Our waiter, Robert, still had not come to our table, so we ended up asking another waiter to bring us plates. After we finished our appetizers, we stacked all of the plates on top of each other, as they usually give you a fresh plate for your entrée. However, when Robert finally came to the table with our pizza, he said, ""Oh did you want a new plate?"". Yes, of course I do, mine is now dirty and stacked between other dirty plates. I also ordered ranch with my pizza, but had to ask for it a second time before they brought it out. That's not a big deal, I was not upset by that. What did upset me is that they did not refill our drinks once during the entire meal. Our glasses were nearly empty before the food came out, and they never once came to check on us unless we called them first. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant, and although we don't believe Robert deserved a tip, we gave him 15% anyway. We were really disappointed in this service, and we'll be taking our business elsewhere next time."
Ashlee H.,"Spring, TX",37,3,,5.0,7/28/2016,Omg good food and great service! This is also a hot spot for Pokemon go! We stopped in here out of curiosity and man I must say they have some foods that are a little different but seriously it tastes amazing. The Brussel sprouts they had weren't really as good as I thought they would be but the Mediterranean tacos that o had were spot on in taste and texture!
Paul K.,"Spring, TX",0,4,,4.0,11/17/2014,"This is a good place to meet up and hang with friends.  The food is pretty good...  It not the cheapest place to go, but everything on the menu is pretty reasonable.   Service is normally good, considering how busy this place gets.  I like to go every now and then, and I will definitely be back!"
Maria E.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/14/2016,"I have been to this location several times and always had a good experience. The last time I was there on May 12th for my graduation my family and I had a bad time. One of the guests at my table paid for the bill and another was going to leave cash $$ for tip. We still hadn't gotten our deserts, well, I gives the waitress though we weren't giving her a tip because we put no tip on the credit card charge and she basically threw the desert plates and silverware at us. She was annoyed had a nasty attitude, we asked for extra plates and she rolled her eyes and chunked them at the table and walked off. I asked to speak to a manager and no one came, she came over and asked ""do you need something"" with a bad attitude. I couldn't believe this, I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. I told her you know we were going to leave a cash tip you didn't have to treat us so nasty because you thought we weren't going to tip you. She just kept saying ""sorry about that"", too freaking late you ruined my graduation lunch!! Never going here again!!"
Marian D.,"Conroe, TX",0,12,,3.0,9/12/2015,"My boyfriend and I stopped by as a recommendation from a friend. Overall, I like the environment and the decor is right up my alley but... I hated the service. We stopped by at around 10:30-11pm for a late dinner, the place was not packed but it wasn't empty either - if it had been packed then I would understand why our waiter only stopped by the table twice and took both of our orders wrong and why the food took a ridiculous amount of time to come. Not only were both of our orders wrong but the food was cold. I don't want to give them a bad review, maybe I just got the wrong server, who knows? I'm not opposed to coming again and giving it a second shot but I highly doubt we would return."
Melissa J.,"Spring, TX",0,3,2,4.0,1/1/2016,"I received the e-mail special for B1G1 entree for lunch for being a Premier Rewards member. Ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli (Good!).  Also ordered the holiday pairing of Blackened Mahi and Parmesan Shrimp (Both good.)  My sides of Clam Chowder and Salad Wedge made the meal very filling.  Only critique is the salad was dripping in blue cheese dressing and the last pieces of salad were inedible.  I would order dressing on the side next time. Our appetizers of Fried Artichoke and Sriracha Dip w/chips were also good.  However, there was not enough chips for the amount of dip."
Allison S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,4,,5.0,10/9/2015,"Delicious food, great beers, fantastic service. Stephanie was a great server, recommending perfect choices and always attentive. A highlight of my vacation here."
Maritza M.,"Houston, TX",10,232,33,5.0,6/14/2014,"Great lunch spot. We stopped in here while running errands in Houston and tried the Lunch Specials. My companion had the barbecue special: a pulled pork slider with a bbq chicken breast,  slaw and crispy skinny fries. My choice was the soup/salad/baked potato combo, with clam chowder, Caesar salad,  and a chicken- broccoli-cheese potato. Delicious, and so much food we needed to-go boxes. Everything was hot,  fresh and scrumptious. Service was great.  Try the home-brewed beers and the desserts,  too!"
GV L.,"Spring, TX",1,18,4,1.0,5/1/2016,"My wife and I decided to give this restaraunt a second chance since our bad experience in 2013.  Unfortunately, we should have followed our first minds.  First, the greeter and server were very nice and pleasant.  They deserve a job well done!!  However, management and the ability of the kitchen to follow the specific order request was a nightmare.  The food is below standards. The turkey patties are processed and pre-formed.  The beer is not made in the establishment making the window that shows the distillery as decieving.  The stringy fries were so greasy I could have just asked for an order of lukewarm grease that gave the flavor and aroma of fries.  The avocado dip is extremely spicy, and please note they don't warn you.  According to my wife the ground beef patties were tasteless and very dry.  Additionaly, they are not careful to pay particular attention to food allergies.  For example, no cheese on a burger and gluten free bun.  I had to send my order back 3 times and waited almost 35 minutes for the meal I ordered in the first place.  Truthfully, this establishment gives the ambiance of gourmet food and specialty beer but it's all marketing.  Moreover, the manager had the audacity to charge me regular price while confidenty stating we did give you what you ordered.  I would strongly advise against spending your hard earned money at this establishment.  Find a place with good quality food and management that loves their job, and it shows!"
Andrea F.,"Spring, TX",72,55,1,2.0,3/18/2016,"Terrible service !  I think our waitress must have been new, but it was bad !   Was brought the wrong appetizer, the wrong drink, the wrong refill was dumped in my drink.  When the food finally arrived, I needed ketchup for my fries but there was none on the table and our waitress wasn't seen again.  I ended up throwing away the fries since I only like them with ketchup and wasn't able to get any.  We also asked questions about the menu and she wasn't able to answer any of them.  She had to run off and ask someone else every question we had.  She also had no personality.  In fact, no one in there was smiling.  It appeared that the staff was just very unhappy with their jobs.  One last thing, not trying to be horribly mean, but hygiene in a restaurant is HUGE, I mean you're working around food.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the hostesses horrible dandruff or psoriasis - she had huge flakes in her hair and on her shirt. I'm not normally mean about that but it was so bad, it's the first thing I noticed when I walked in.  My advice, please address the importance of hygiene to staff since they work around food,  and most importantly - properly train your staff.  They should know the menu enough to answer a few simple questions.  They should also check on their tables enough to know they'd like ketchup and should know what drinks their tables are drinking so they don't dump unsweetened tea in their sweet tea or water in their Sprite.  Pretty disappointed in this place considering lunch for 2 was 50$"
Ryan B.,"Austin, TX",28,63,428,2.0,12/4/2013,"BJ's has a decent selection of food, so it wasn't a hard choice to decide to eat at this particular restaurant, despite the fact that I'd never been to this location before. The chicken I ordered was burnt, so the taste was off; it was also bland. The sides were decent but nothing spectacular. The biggest issue I had with this visit was that I had to wait nearly 10 minutes before my drink order was taken (the restaurant was not busy) and then, within 2 minutes of my drink order being taken, my server brought me a ticket to pay -- but I did not have a drink and hadn't even placed my meal order. Then, it was another 5-10 minutes before my server brought me my drink, at which point I asked about the ticket that had been quickly set on my table and she said it was meant for another table. I'd not dine at this particular location again."
John K.,"Arden, NC",11,95,,3.0,3/18/2016,I dig this place. They send lots of coupons. Parm chix is my jam.  Their beers are tasty. The lady and I go once every two months maybe
Robert L.,"Houston, TX",0,21,,2.0,6/13/2015,"What a disappointment. This place is to a brewhouse what Disney's Wilderness Lodge is to the Old Faithful Inn at Yellowstone. It is not ""really"" a brewhouse but it sort of looks like one (or a least like a contrived suburban version of one). It does not ""really"" have local craft beers. It is TGI Fridays with a craft brew veneer. In a city with more than a dozen outstanding craft breweries, the local beer selection at BJs is ridiculously weak. Order a Rodeo Clown ""what?"" asks the waiter, ""Anything from Southern Star Brewery?"" (located a few miles north) ""where"" asks the waiter? Bayou City Brewing? ""I do not know."" Do you have any houston beers? ""We have a St. Arnolds."" (one selection). There are many, many places to get great local craft beers in Houston. This is not one of them.  As for the food, it is ordinary fast casual, chain restaurant fare with little thought put into creating unique or interesting flavors. Crisp, down the street, offers a much better beer selection, better food, and does not try to pretend it is a brewpub."
Jenny F.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,29,,4.0,6/4/2015,"Back to BJ's after a 6-7 week hiatus. First person we saw was our favorite waiter Matt, THE best, he even remembered our favorite drinks after all that time. OK, now to new menu, no they have NOT brought back the Chicken Limone or the Chicken Marsala. What the DO have is lots of Quinoa and couscous! One of the starters is a sautéed Brussel Sprouts with Siracha/honey Crème! Brussels are the new Kale and they were very good, although a bit too sautéed maybe! I like a restaurant that keeps up with trends in food, but I hate that they get rid of winners. It would be good if they gave you a choice with the protein of either pasta, quinoa, rice or couscous, or the cheddar mash even!!  The Happy Hour wine is still only $1 off, the BJ's in Shenandoah is/was a test area for this! Obviously not a lot of people care about paying $10 for a glass of Estancia!!  All in all I'll still frequent BJ's but it won't be my ""go to once a week"" place like it used to be!!"
Susan W.,"Magnolia, TX",2,1,,1.0,12/13/2014,Just finished a very interesting meal and even better conversation with the manager. Apparently it is normal to find bristles of the brush they use to butter the crust of the pizza. Did not think it was an issue to find it in ones food. When we ordered the pizza this was not included in the list of toppings. Will not be back.
John Roger C.,"Spring, TX",10,30,2,2.0,7/8/2013,"This is a shorter version of the comments I sent directly to the establishment.  Went at 730 on a Sunday.  Met with a surly pair of hostesses.   Waited 10 minutes at the table.  Another 7 minutes before two beers and two soft drinks.   Didn't receive setups.   Ordered four items, two pizzas, a baked potato and a salad.  Salad was never delivered until prompting.   Had to ask twice for pepper and parm for pizza.   Tables took 40 minutes to be bussed next to us.   Never saw a manager.   $80.  Third straight crappy visit. It bums me to write this.  I grew up in SoCal, and went to the second or third BJ's, and the original brewery.   Frankly, this is overpriced, poor service with echoes of what made this a great establishment.   Unless they get it together, they will survive on one or two time visits until they crater.   Heck, the in-house brews taste metallic (maybe poor dishwashing?).  When it's on, the salads, apps, deep dish are all recommended.  But right now, I'd stay away."
