Airrion F.,"Galveston, TX",199,7,22,2.0,7/24/2015,"Food was delicious!!! We tried to choose a table, but was turned away to a different one. Service was good, but the $5.50 for chips & salsa was ridiculous. Always loved this place but this time was a wake up call. Table was sticky and dirty, oh and again the chips were not bottomless. Also there not on the menu. My suggestion just drink beer."
Jared P.,"Chicago, IL",146,314,23,2.0,1/14/2012,"We went to this place because it had a pretty decent review. When we got there, the place was packed and I was thinking ""oh boy, with this many people, it can't be bad!"" Then, they told us we had to wait 20 minutes, which was reasonable for a place this packed. Twenty minutes later, they sat us down and I ordered a beer. They have a bunch of signature beers and I tried an ale. It was good, but I'm not sure if the beer is actually brewed on sight. Many of the brewhouses that I visited back in PA actually have the equipment showing to make it evident that they were brewing on site. If they aren't brewing on site, what makes this beer so special? If they are, let's see the brewing atmosphere! Anyways, all the hype was on this deep dish pizza they serve. I had been craving pizza for weeks and almost resorted to Cici's pizza the weekend before. We got the 5 Meat Large Deep Dish. Now, I'm from the north, so pizza is heavily critiqued, especially in Pittsburgh. First of all, the pizza was kind of cold. No, it wasn't freezing cold, but I expect my pizza to be scald-the-roof-of-your-mouth when it first comes out. This was far from that. Secondly, they used so much oil that it was making my girlfriend sick. She was literally wringing the oil out of the crust after she picked the toppings off. I've eaten pizza with pools of grease on the top, but this was was a little absurd. Was it horrible? Nah. But, it's definitely not worth the price nor the wait when you can get the same thing at the Pizza Hut down the street for a lot cheaper and probably delivered to your door hot."
Tammy M.,"Spring, TX",4,2,2,1.0,5/4/2015,Food sucks. Dry pizza with little sauce for the husband. I ordered tacos. The tortilla had a nasty grill smell. Waiter was slow and MIA alot. Will not return!!
Jen S.,"Houston, TX",53,54,421,4.0,12/16/2013,"The new corn fritters are amazing - crispy on the outside, moist inside with a good jalapeño kick. Only $3! Great appetizer."
David S.,"Montgomery, TX",1,17,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Well to began before we could get in our seats the waiter is all over us to order some drinks. I politely said mind if we look at the drink menu a bit and decide? He promptly replied, what are you looking for as that menu is like a book? So once again I reiterated my desire that we want to look at the menu so give us a few minutes ok? I ordered the top shelf margarita and it came out so sour it was tasting like those sour candies my kids used to get. Once again enter the waiter who offered to fix the problem. I told him I make these at home and if it had any Grand Marnier as advertised it would have a darker color. He brought it back and just as bad so I said take that away. Now we asked for chips and salsa. The chips were soft and greasey and many broken pieces and the salsa was like eating tomatoe sauce with water added. I think you could get a better flavor if you went to Walmart or the dollar store and bought the cheapest carp you can find. Ok fast forward ordered a pizza and once again full of tomatoes. So between the salsa and the pizza I'm tomatoed out.  We won't return. I guess if you're a beer freak as in caraft beers and like spending 6-8 bucks a beer than this is your place."
S A A.,"Houston, TX",82,35,20,3.0,12/24/2014,"It's the usual franchise model, staffed with the minimal skill level to keep the place open and earning money.  The service is ""ok"": it's not wonderful, and it's not terrible. Leave a 15% tip to be tasteful (as I did).  If you get better service than I did (ex: it would be nice if the bartender/host/server smiled at me instead of waiting for me to beautify their environment first) then leave a better tip.  Woodlands franchises are staffed with millennials.  Expect exactly that and you won't be unhappy: mediocre teenagers of upper class families have to earn pocket money somewhere."
David D.,"Magnolia, TX",0,1,,1.0,3/25/2016,"Two stars because my food and my kids food was good. My wife's food, that's another story; and so is the service.  I got the Sriracha Mac 'N Cheese. I must have read the menu wrong because it came with penne? I love penne and it was good, but it's not mac 'n cheese without macaroni right? Kids got the spaghetti, loved it.  My wife got the appetizer sampler. Mozzarella sticks were good, spin dip was okay, avocado egg rolls were terrible, and that's the reason my wife wanted to go. We told the server they were not good and she said ""I don't eat them so I wouldn't know."" Did not even bother to get the manager.  We were going to walk out before ordering because we waited 15 minutes to order after getting our drinks.  I flagged down a server and asked for her to get our server for us, otherwise it could have been another 15 minutes. Our server had been to the table next to us multiple times but never came to ours and never made eye contact.  We should have left before ordering, but instead we won't be back."
Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18,3.0,6/29/2011,"If i could give it 3.5 stars I would...  The bartenders were great.. the company (nice lady I met at the bar) was great.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, and it was just ok.  Nothing to write home about, thus the 3 stars.  The beer was pretty good, as I hear it was brewed for them by a good local brewery.  The service at the bar was stellar.  The lady I met was a regular and they took good care of her, knowing her wine before she even sat down.  In turn, they took care of me.  The food was average, I'm sure there were better options than the pulled pork, and I'll explore them next time I visit.."
Steph L.,"Spring, TX",2,19,7,2.0,12/19/2014,"Normally, my boyfriend and I really enjoy BJs. We dine there every couple of weeks and have amazing service. Tonight was another story. The hostess was absolutely miserable, barely even acknowledging us. She then said another girl would seat us, but the second girl was walking away already without knowing she was the one to do the job. Grumpy hostess sat us, not without a huff and puff about it though. Once sat, we met our server; She was so nice! I was thrilled the first impression was off. We ordered almost immediately. After a short time our food came out. My order was wrong; at this point I didn't really mind because I wasn't starving. My boyfriend was pretty upset because he hates eating without me, but I reassured him it was fine and not to worry because I wasn't angry. Then when it came out, boyfriend was finished with his food, and the meal was still wrong (thankfully just in the portioning; I asked for the single portion not double of the pork chops). The waitress blamed it on the kitchen ""hardly being able to understand english"". We then ordered a pizookie (whoever created this dessert is a god), and got the bill. Not only were we not offered the meal on them, or a discounted dessert; but they charged me for the larger sized pork dish!!! Once I brought it up to the waitress her entire attitude changed. She acted like we were an inconvenience to her. And when she finally dropped the corrected check she said in a very irritated tone (as she's walking away, not even looking at us) ""merry christmas"". This ones on you kiddo, if you had had and ounce of empathy you may have gotten a tip. For the first time in over 10 years I walked out of a place without leaving a server anything. What does that tell you about my experience?"
Kathy L.,"Spring, TX",54,8,,5.0,3/13/2015,"Have been three times.  Menu is several pages.  They serve a little of everything. Each dish Ive tried from appetizers to desserts, were all good.  Nice place to meet friends."
Kathleen P.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,4.0,3/4/2016,I have always had good service from the staff. The food is fresh and plentiful. I order the roast beef dip a lot and it is great.  The one thing I do not like is how bread is toasted.  I had a California Chicken Sandwich with toasted bread and the bread was so greasy with the butter they put on the grill when toasting.  I have to remember to ask for No Butter.  You can swap your fries for a salad which I prefer.
Greg T.,"The Woodlands, TX",16,159,,2.0,1/1/2013,"Sadly the past few visits to BJ's have continued to show a decline in food quality. It's hard enough to find a decent pizza in Houston and BJ's was a restaurant we could count on. That was until they made changes to the way they served the pizzas. Now you get a rather bland and barely warm pizza.  When we complained to our waitress she explained how ""corporate"" has made them change and a lot of customers have been complaining about it.  We then chatted with the manager. He wasn't really concerned about our opinion and stated something similar to what the waitress had said.  Hmm, if they have a lot of complaints and continue down the same path, doesn't that bespeak of just plain stupidity? Or perhaps they are trying to disprove the definition of insanity.  Oh well...the beer is decent and they do have other items.  But we'd still like a HOT PIZZA! Our 2 cents. Greg"
Linda T.,"Houston, TX",445,537,423,3.0,5/10/2013,"BJ's is a mix between Chilli's and Cheesecake Factory well in my opinion. I don't typically eat at chains like this, but BJ's is pretty good when I'm in the mood for this type of restaurant, would much rather dine here then Chilli's Bar and Grill any day. They have pizza, pasta, burgers, salads, soups, speciality entrees, great desserts, small bites.  I tried their watermelon salad, (listed under the small plate selection) really delish, it had arugula, greens, chunks of watermelon, pecans, red onions, feta cheese, yum and only $2.95! Perfect starter followed by my veggie/goat cheese flat bread, really delish too.  The portions here are pretty large, you can split a dish or not,. :) They have great beer selection and their special brew of handcrafted beers they make in house. Good place to bring large group or dine with your family. They're open pretty late too on the weekends, there's not very many choices in The Woodlands area for a late night bite besides fast food, so this is a plus."
Donna G.,"Boise, ID",0,42,1,4.0,7/16/2014,"My star rating is mostly in regards to the food.  Looks like a nice restaurant when you walk in. The host was confusing and there was an awkward pause/silence when we stated the number in our party and she said she'll (as in herself) will seat us but the girl behind her was gathering menus and looking at us. Not necessarily negative, but weird start. I think our server was ready to head out the door as we were her last table so not exactly bubbly happy service. Being asked about dessert and having the check dropped when I have more than half of my entree left is not exactly the most ""please stay and enjoy your meal"" notion.  Outside of that, the food was great! I had the Cherry Glazed Salmon (possible correction on exact entree name) and it was perfect. Perfectly flakey salmon, the glaze was sweet but not too much, the couscous had a spice that I loved, the whole thing just worked. My boyfriend enjoyed the Chicken Pita Tacos as well.  Whatever you do, don't get the iced/sweet tea. It tasted like somebody brewed it with a handful of cigarette butts. Yuck."
April C.,"Conroe, TX",1,6,2,1.0,11/26/2014,"Attempted to go for lunch today, but left within minutes of being seated.  The place seemed filthy, the benches of the booth had food all over them.  Our menus were sticky and the pages were wet with what looked like tea or soda.  So disappointed, we won't be back."
Joshua Y.,"Huntsville, TX",9,4,,5.0,12/30/2014,"We stopped in for a quick drink and enjoyed very pleasant service. Katie and Kylie (I might be spelling those wrong) were very friendly and hospitable. Kylie recommended a few craft beers to start off with and they were delicious. A manger stopped by to say hi and chatted with us as well, which is nice to see as a bar guest. I highly recommend coming here, you won't be disappointed. Clean, friendly and well kept all around."
Cindy N.,"Spring, TX",2,13,2,2.0,3/6/2015,"I don't know if it's me but everything I have ordered thus far has not been the best besides the drink. The last time I went the waitress was neglectful and forgetful and the shrimp tacos was not good. The time before that, the waiter was very good but the food wasn't. The atmosphere and the beer is good though."
Lasairiona M.,"Missouri City, TX",110,707,393,4.0,3/3/2013,"I had a salad (with a number of amendments, grilled not fried, no corn or tomatoes but onions and peppers etc) with no hassle, no fuss.  The server was excellent for our party of 6, attentive, quick, and happy to banter with the group.   Food was tasty, though slow to come out for a Sunday afternoon. Had the trio of pizzookies - they were big enough to share between 3 of us and they were delicious!!  We'd definitely stop back here on our way up or down from the Woodlands!"
Micki R.,"Shenandoah, TX",9,11,,4.0,12/8/2014,"Great food and nice atmosphere.  Kid friendly - get the kids pizza, they get to make it before they bake it!  Good variety of beer and huge menu, haven't had anything I didn't like here.  Favorite app is the avocado egg rolls....yummy"
Dennis L.,"Sterling Heights, MI",91,488,206,4.0,1/3/2011,"I really wasn't sure what to expect at BJ's, but I figured I figured a brewhouse has to be good.   For me, the beer was good at BJ's, but the pizza was great!  The pizza at BJ's is best described as a pan pizza constructed traditionally with the thickness approaching Chicago style deep dish.  The dough is delicious and the toppings we high quality.  BJ's has a great atmosphere, but watch your step on the slipper wood floors.  Service was very friendly and timely. Overall, an impressive experience!"
