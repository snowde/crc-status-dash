Amanda E.,"Lakeside, CA",208,40,3,3.0,4/26/2012,"eh... what can i say? coming from California, we have this type of food and beer all over. Nothing that spectacular. We called ahead for the call ahead seating and still had to wait over 45 min. We said we needed a highchair when we got there, then again when the hostess called us to be seated and then she walked us to our HUGE corner booth table (we had a party of 3 with an infant) I had to remind her for a third time we needed a high chair.  The booth was roomy and comfy but the high chair was so short i could barely see my son over the table, which made it awkward to eat my food and feed him since he was a good 4-6 inches too low to even put his hands on the table.  The place was packed and they had good music playing. Our server was new and I had to ask him twice for A-1 sauce. But overall he provided good service.  Only thing that I can always count on is the PIZOOKIE! That will def keep me coming back!"
Chad C.,"Conroe, TX",18,49,32,5.0,5/11/2013,"Great service at the bar area, good place for date nights and dinner with friends.  I've been here for work related lunches and the service was just as great with large groups."
Jonathan D.,"Spring, TX",1,59,15,2.0,11/13/2014,"I've have eaten here with my family probably four or five times and the food is great, the problem is that their staff is terrible every time we go. Between not bringing us drinks, to not refilling drinks, to never taking our order there is always a problem at this location. One time all seven of us ordered water and the server actually refused our table and another server had to take care of us because he thought his tip would be small. One time I ordered off their light menu and when it came out it looked nothing like the picture it was obviously missing some ingredients. When I spoke to the manager he assumed because I'm a larger guy that my problem was the portion size I was greatly offended. I think it's a management issue the old saying ""a fish rots from the head down"" is very apparent here."
Pam W.,"Nashville, TN",0,6,,4.0,11/6/2014,Visiting Houston wanted a good fresh lunch. We found it here. I had the ahi salad. Large portion with perfectly seared ahi along with fresh greens and tomatoes.  Server was efficient and knowledgeable about menu options.  Enjoyed the lively atmosphere . Definitely will return.
Craig B.,"Spring, TX",0,2,,2.0,2/12/2015,"So first time there and probably wont be back. Arrived at  6 ish to a nearly empty restaurant. Was taken to a table near the back by the in and out to the BOH. Being in the industry I understand rotation for seating but still asked for a different table since I knew that it would be getting busy. The hostess rolled her eyes and offered the two of us a giant 8 top booth. I politely passed and said"" There is only 2 of us we can take the smaller table."" Looked through the beer list and it isnt that bad. Ordered the fried artichoke and a beer. The artichoke arrived and looked like they were burnt blobs. I looked to say something but our waitress was a ghost. Kinda nibbled since i hadnt eaten all day but left 90 percent there. Food came out Parm Chicken kinda tasted off, a little to much lemon, acid or something. Fish and chip, was frozen fish nuggets. not a nice fish filet. Had to find another server since once again ours was gone. Finally dinner was over, our server said she would be right back with our bill....then gone....at 5 mins she walked past....8 mins she walked past again...11 mins I asked her again where our bill was and she said ""I gave it to you."" Told her she was mistaken as she then pulled our bill out of her book. Oh and during our dinner not only did our waters stay empty but the Manager walked past us 3 times and even refilled other tables around us. I guess we were welcomed nor wanted."
Afton S.,"Houston, TX",815,248,37,1.0,11/12/2013,"Just a bad experience in general.. And that saddens me, because for chain restaurants I generally like this place. We went on a Monday afternoon with my family. It really wasn't that busy, tons of empty tables. I excepted mediocre to good service, and it was below even that. We ordered two appetizers, and they took a very very long time. Once our food started coming out, and it was brought by a different server, we were missing one entree. Given there had been some special requests for the sandwich (no bacon, no cheese.. but is this seriously that confusing?!), but after about 5 mins of waiting, the server finally came by. We asked about the sandwich.. she said she was going to go get it. Well, about 10 mins later, after most of the table had been eating for some time, she comes and says they put cheese on it and had to remake it. About another 10 minutes goes by, and the entire table was done eating minus the one person waiting for the sandwich. When it comes out, its 3 measly pieces of chicken.. not even a single chicken breast. There is NO WAY it took 20 mins to cook 3 small thin pieces of chicken. The server clearly saw how long it took and how bad the timing was. No manager came by, no offer to take it off the bill.  I have been in the service industry for about 10 years now. That should have been removed from the bill without question. It was a seriously poor dining expereicne."
Mark W.,"San Antonio, TX",1261,133,97,5.0,11/28/2013,Brew it up right my friends! Drink it smooth or heavy they will delight them buds if taste in a wicked mad rush of good lawd good beer! Oh snap the food is on point as well? Yessir! Or ma'am! Do it right with a night if delight!
Corey B.,"Spring, TX",0,6,,2.0,7/20/2014,After waiting for 35 minutes to get a table when it wasn't buisy was annoying. Taking an hour and a half to get simple food that was not very good to the table will keep me from going back. The scallops were obviously frozen and the fish and chips was greasy.
Tony F.,"Washington, UT",0,12,,1.0,5/17/2014,"After eating at the one in Las Vegas, and liked it, we tried this BJ's.  NOT all are created equal.  We were seated immediately, there were only a few people in the restaurant;  it was 4:00.  We waited 10 min,  could not get anyone's attention, and as we were about to leave the hostess came by and apologized.  Finally our waitress came, no apology, stating she was new.  We'll she needed more training.  I had cold burger with cold fries, and my wife's food was cold also.  After our meal, it took so long to get our bill, we went to the manager, gave him out table and what we had to eat.  He had to look up the waitress and retrieve the bill.  We got a half hearted apology.  We left and will NEVER go back.  Stay away unless you go to bar and just drink."
Patrick J.,"Conroe, TX",22,2,,2.0,7/2/2014,"A few years back I was overjoyed to discover BJ's, having moved down from a part of the country where deep dish pizza is commonplace. The selection of specialty craft beer on draft was also a pleasant surprise, and I really enjoyed their deep dish pizza . This quickly became one of my favorite places to eat. Lately however service has become inattentive and the quality of the food has changed. The last two times I went there was no sauce on the pizza, even  the second time when I asked for extra sauce. Don't be confused, its not a personal preference of mine for my pizza to be absolutely bathed in sauce, this pizza just simply did not have any sauce either time. I had to ask for extra sauce and dip my pizza like it was a breadstick. Both times the wait staff was inattentive, and the hostesses were not welcoming at all. I may try back in a couple years....."
Lindsey B.,"The Woodlands, TX",11,21,,4.0,5/14/2012,"This is a great addition to the Portofino area. It's always busy, but happy hour in the bar is excellent. 1/2 price small pizzas and drink specials, yes please!  We've been several times for lunch and dinner, usually with our 2 year old and it's loud enough where we don't have worry about her disturbing anyone. With a toddler, we're always on the lookout for enjoyable places like BJ's where we can enjoy some adult beverages while not imposing on others trying to enjoy their meals. That said, this is not an intimate setting, but it's perfect for us."
Fred W.,"Spring, TX",0,6,,1.0,11/22/2015,"I'll never go back to this place- ever. I've been there many times and have finally learned my lesson. I was there with a friend of mine who wanted to go there. I had already sworn off this place but agreed to go since he was from out of town. I ordered the 'new"" Mahi and shrimp entree with BJ's special seasoning, olives, onions in tomato sauce. It was actually pretty good. When my son invited me there I agreed only because the previous experience was good. I ordered the same entree but they decided to leave out a few things - like the seasoning, the onions and the olives. So what they gave me was a piece of overcooked, dried out salmon with some boiled shrimp with some canned tomatoes. I sent it back and a few minutes later the manager came over and offered to make it over. Why did they serve me the returned entree to begin with? He didn't know. What will be different this time-if you can't make it right t second time, why not the first time? Asked if I wanted something else - I declined. He said he was sorry and to let him know if I wanted to order something else  and left. Not the first time they just decide to send whatever out of the kitchen and hope you just accept it. Service is spotty when the waiter brings you something other than what was ordered and claims the customer made a mistake. What a joke the Manager and this restaurant is. Too much competition to have to be abused by these people."
Stan D.,"Arvada, CO",584,283,12,5.0,2/16/2012,"We were very pleased when we traveled to Texas, and our friends wanted to meet us here.  We thought this was a Colorado-based restaurant, but we had been there, and knew we liked it.  This Texas version was every bit as good as our favorite in Westminster, CO. I love the beer varieties, and that they happily serve them up in flights.  I prefer the lighter beers, and probably would never try some of the darker varieties if I couldn't get them in the four ounce size.  I discovered I really like the Tatonka stout as a  nice variation of my trusted favorite.    We know we love the pizza here, but this time we tried the pasta.  I had the spaghetti with marinara, and loved it!  Sprinkled with a few red pepper flakes, I found it completely satisfying, especially served with those fine beers, and in that warm, comfortable atmosphere.   BJ's is a winner, and I have never been disappointed with a meal there no matter which state I was in."
Christy M.,"Spring, TX",26,10,,2.0,4/26/2014,"I used to go to the Bj's in Willowbrook constantly. We stopped going when they discontinued the Chardonnay shrimp pasta but we started going again after we moved the TW. I have been there several times and I HATE dealing with the hostesses. All of them are pissy brats with sour attitudes. One stared me down while SLOWLY getting the silverware until I asked her if she had a problem. I usually like the waiter/waitresses and the GM I believe has chatted with us several times. I could drown myself in their tortilla soup. Seriously so good!  I only like going for lunch though, their prices are insane unless it's lunch. I LOVE their berry burst cider but again the price is insane. $5 for a glass but it is seriously good!"
Shawna B.,"Spring, TX",3,69,17,4.0,6/6/2011,"Here is a secret bomb shell for all you beer lovers out there...the beer for BJ's is contract brewed by... St. Arnold's....KKKAAABBOOOOMMMM. Ok so I read that in an article by the Chronicle. But never the less it makes me feel better about drinking the beer here. So now that is out of the way lets talk about the place. Their menu is very extensive and I usually stear away from meals like glazed chicken or pork chops because I can make that stuff better at home. I pretty much only eat pizza at this place...the Mediterranean to be specific. The crust is chicago style, soft and crunchy. One of the better pies I have had in the Houston area. I have had a turkey sandwich and a side salad or two, they are fairly run of the mill. I think what I really like about this place is that it reminds me of my favorite restaurant from my home town. New, clean, friendly people relaxing and drinking beer. Get here early on a Tuesday and sit in the bar...have a happy hour pizza and a beer and just relax!"
Lindsay S.,"Chicago, IL",73,545,21,2.0,3/7/2011,"It's a Friday's atmosphere that acts like they brew beer on property.  It's a chain folks. But my country parents love this place and couldn't wait to bring me here.  So in we stopped on the way home from the airport.  It's huge and is trying to be a sports bar.  I think.  I think BJ's is confused.  (sidenote: why anyone wants to call any business BJ is beyond me) The menu was huge but typical fare.  Nothing original.  Trying to keep it healthier than the norm I opted for the 1/2 turkey sandwich with a salad.  The waitress then asked me what kind of fries I wanted with that.  Seriously?  More food than that?  Gross.  I should have asked for the dressing on the side because my vinaigrette was poured on top of the iceberg lettuce concoction.  The wait staff was nothing special.  The beer was okay (I had the Red Jeremiah (?) one they were toting for St Patrick's Day).   All-in-all, if it were my choice, no thank you.  This is typical Woodlands crap.  A chain restaurant, made to be huge and look fancy.  Thrown into the abysmal Porto Fino shopping center.  Makes me remember why I left."
Sarah Q.,"Spring, TX",0,25,,3.0,5/18/2011,"This place is good if you want to sit at a pretty bar and have some pints and a bite.  I wouldn't go here for dinner.  The food costs more than it's worth (it's nothing special) and you can't get Happy Hour prices unless you're at the bar. Note that - you can't get happy hour prices unless you're at the bar!  Which is frustrating and bad business, especially considering they don't tell you that unless you ask or they happen to mention it. But, if you do get a seat at the bar (it can get crowded in the evenings) during happy hour you can get a good deal on a 'mini pizza' (half price) and choose a brew from their tap wall; they have a pretty good selection.  I'd estimate 20 or so and not just macros.  Sadly, I wasn't impressed with their 'house' beers (they don't brew on site anyhow) but their cider (although expensive) is pretty good."
Eric O.,"The Woodlands, TX",1,38,9,4.0,12/14/2013,called and ordered a pizza and after the reviews of the service I am glad. I ordered a large bjs favorite had a special request on one side of the pizza it was met. My pizza was warm when I arrived home and tasted great really impressed. It was way above expectations and hope it was not a fluke. Will be going back again to dine soon and will follow up on this review. Loved the ingredients take out may be the way to go?
Jaime T.,"Montgomery, TX",0,9,,4.0,6/2/2014,"Mini bruschetta is YUMMY!  balsamic glazed chicken very good too, get it every time. Oreo pizookie is good but quite rich so we always share it.  Homemade root beer is extra tasty!"
Stephen C.,"Conroe, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/17/2011,"This place. For some reason, i've been here 3 times and all 3 times were crap. After today, i've now learned my lesson. I'd love to sit in on a training class to understand why the service sucks so bad. Where do they hire these people from? I guess you don't need experience to work at BJs. I used to be a server, i know how it works. The first time i ate here was when it first opened so i can let the 2 hour lunch slide. I work on the other side of the freeway so a 2 hour lunch is ridiculous The second time, i was with 3 other people and for some reason, my order never came out. So instead of fessing up to forgetting it, the server (i think his name was Gary) cracked jokes the whole time and offered me breadsticks. I'm sure BJ's breadsticks are a popular item. I never once saw a manager, i just sat there watching my coworkers eat until my crappy sandwich arrived.. It was no big deal to the server and i was offered no discount.  Then today i decided foolishly to return to BJs. Me and my coworker ordered avocado eggrolls and a California cheeseburger to split. The eggrolls come out with a chicken sandwich. He told me the burger would be medium-well, how did he ring up a chicken sandwich instead? And once again, it was no big deal to him. All i got was a bare apology and a promise that my burger would be ""out soon"". Yeah, i've heard that one before. Once again, not a manager to be seen. When i forgot an order, which was rare, i would tell the customer and then tell the manager. That would at least salvage a tip. That's one good thing about BJs, you won't have to tip much. And do they not hire female servers? All i see are balding dudes with no personalities.  The food tastes half-microwaved most of the time, even their overrated pizzas. It's your typical American chain restaurant  but they're trying to market themselves as something more. It's not, revolving door and all. And the beer? I know my beers, i've been to Dark Lord Day (look it up). I've probably been to 25 different breweries in the last year. I have yet to enjoy one of BJ's beers. They're too sweet and the flavor is always off. I'd rather brew my own. I normally keep my complaints to myself and i don't write reviews but i've had enough of this place. Fool me once, blah blah blah."
