Dan I.,"Spring, TX",0,5,,3.0,5/26/2013,"Decided to try out BJ's as it had been repeatedly recommended by friends as a decent place for late-night dining.  Since our kids were on their ""holiday: sleeping schedule, we were all ready to go and hungry upon arrival @9pm.  The Scene: Carrying a 2 yr-old, asked for child seat.  We have waitstaff already asking for our drink order while we've literally not finished getting seated and I've still got the toddler in my arms. Oh well, maybe I'm overreacting. Nope, the waiter returns in 60 seconds to take our food orders and asks (sarcastically) if we had any questions about their 130+ items on the menu. I asked for 2-3 minutes to look over the menu. Evidently I've now offended them as he doesn't return for more than 10 minutes.  I order chips & salsa (appetizer) as well as our meals.  The chips take around 15 minutes to come out. I'm wondering if they had to gring the corn in back when I see the issue. Their idea of chips & salsa is that is must appear fru-fru.  Three different colors of chips, and beneath the patina of full-size chips on the top are what I'll simply call ""chip crumbles"". As the wife, the kids & I were all starving at this point (I've already downed two excellent root beers), we stuff what we can into our mouths before our meals come out. The salsa is very mild, yet spicy.  While I was shocked at $6 for Chips & Salsa, it was somewhat redeemed by the quality. The meals arrive and wife loves her Jambalaya. I start eating my open-faced chili burger (sans the cheese) and notice the Northern affectation of beans in the chili. The full 8 oz. patty along with the chili is very filling.  The kids enjoy an excellent Grilled Cheese and generic chicken fingers. The fries: They come in two options.  Thin and wedge-cut.  Hoping little fingers would be better off with the thin variety, I got those for the kids and reserver teh wedge-cut for myself. I shold have stuck with the thin, though none were very inspiring. ""Seasoned"" fries?  Not really.  Ore Ida frozen seasoned fries were a step above my wedge-cut ones. The Good: Some of the food was excellent - The Salsa, Wife's Jamabalaya, my chili burger, daughter's Grilled Cheese, the root beer was great. Quick seating, initially attentive waitstaff. Place is beautiful inside. Accessible at times ""normal"" restaurants won't be open.  HUGE menu.  Good-sized portions. Teh dessert we had no room for looked wonderful. The Bad: Fries were worse than Red Robins, and now hold 1st place in my bland hall-of-fame. Aggressive waitstaff combined with ""team delivery"" combined for some crossed messages. Too long to get food, beter bring a snack for very young kids before the food arrives. Bring three plates with fries, but no ketchup? Trying to get said ketchup took 10 minutes with me doing everything but sending up a flare. Got kids?  Hope you don't like the TV, you won't be anywhere near one. You have been segregated to the kid zone at the front. I love having the check early, but mid-meal might be off-putting to some."
Fred J.,"Magnolia, TX",0,46,,4.0,10/4/2013,BJ's is a great restaurant for lunch Monday through Friday service is always good the food is always great Portions are really the Other than that I really enjoyed the only problem is the evening and weekend prices are little high
Aimee P.,"Houston, TX",116,65,103,4.0,4/27/2013,This place is pretty decent for a chain. I am a big fan of their Irish Root Beer.
Michael M.,"Conroe, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2010,"This is a recently opened location.  I've been to the one in Willowbrook before but my wife had never been.  While we found the food decent our night was ruined by the managers of the place.  We went to meet a group of friends and not everyone could make it at the same time.  I understand this was a busy night for the place but there was no reason for the managers of the restaurant to continuously hound us for the rest of our seats after we had already explained the rest of our party was on their way. Also, while not our waiters fault, the appetizer and the food ordered for our kids never arrived.  We had to ask and the order was placed again.  Needless to say my wife never wants to go back to this place."
Ryan H.,"Noblesville, IN",47,117,14,3.0,11/7/2012,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse has locations in fifteen different states with the majority being in California and Texas, and I visited one in The Woodlands/Shenandoah just north of Houston, Texas.  They have some televisions and a bar but still offer a pretty nice sit-down restaurant atmosphere.  They serve a very large menu that starts out with a good selection of their house beers.  Since I visited BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse during lunch time, I tried their handcrafted root beer which was good, although I do wish that I sampled one of their alcoholic beers.    BJ's is known for their deep dish pizzas and just recently started serving hand-tossed pizzas. I think my favorite thing about both pizzas is their crust.  The deep dish had a nice soft crust that was similar to a very thick pan pizza's as opposed to traditional deep dish pizzas where the outer edges of the crust are pretty hard.  Additionally, the hand-tossed pizza's crust was thin but still slightly airy making the edges more soft than crispy.  Furthermore, the toppings were pretty good on both pizzas, but I would recommend their deep dish slightly above their hand-tossed pizza.  The nice thing is that they serve their deep dish in many different sizes, and you can go with as small as the mini that I had to ensure you don't get too stuffed.  Even if you aren't looking for pizza, BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse's menu likely has something for you, and I would encourage you to visit the Shenandoah location as their staff was very friendly."
Kevan N.,"Houston, TX",8,19,77,3.0,7/25/2014,I come here now and then with coworkers.  Every time the wait after ordering is at least 30 minutes even when we are the only seated table in the restaurant.  Food is good though.
Larry D.,"League City, TX",0,7,,2.0,11/3/2014,BJs normally has good service and food.  It is one of the few chain places that I visit regularly.  We arrived at approx 9PM on Sat evening for a late dinner.  An appetizer and pizza were ordered.  After 15 to 20 minutes we were notified that the appetizer was not available and if we would like to order something else.  Before a menu could be delivered the pizza arrived.  A smaller pizza had been selected assuming that one course would have already been completed.  This was a major communication and procedure failure between the kitchen and front of the house.  It should not have taken this long to communicate the issue to us.  The service seemed to fail at this point.  The pizza was finished and we left without ordering anything else.
Amna F.,"Encinitas, San Diego, CA",1,24,4,5.0,8/15/2013,You can never ever go wrong with bjs! They have the best deep dish pizzas..I absolutely love their pizooki trio.. The ambiance the service the food everything is great!
Karin N.,"Spring, TX",3,14,2,4.0,3/31/2013,"Delicious!!! Great beer, nutty brunette was very good!! The appetizers were large in portion and very good. I suggest the spinach and artichoke dip! The service was great, restaurant seemed clean. The only issue was the price seemed a little high, but I will definitely be back!"
Melissa B.,"Spring, TX",106,96,203,5.0,7/21/2012,"The flatbread and salad lunch portion was perfect! And for less than 600 calories, even better! Such a great lunch menu."
Brendan U.,"Blue Bell, PA",0,47,6,3.0,12/3/2012,"Nice sports bar. Big beer selection, plenty of TVs, fun snacks, Seared Ahi salad needed more Ahi, but was very tasty and I was pleasantly surprised. I would visit again."
Judy J.,"The Woodlands, TX",47,4,2,2.0,7/17/2011,"Great food but this place is a time investment.. If you have a ton of time, AKA you are retired, and you love great food, this is the place for you.  The food IS kind of tasty but you can not have a client lunch within an hour.  If you are looking to have a working lunch, pass on BJ's in Shenandoah."
Mike W.,"Spring, TX",0,22,,4.0,8/3/2014,Veddy Veddy good. Had a great meal. Had several of their home brewed beers. Service good. Can't complain. I will come back when in this area.
Jenn B.,"Conroe, TX",3,57,8,4.0,12/11/2011,"I was really suprised by all of the bad reviews. We stopped in on a cold Saturday afternoon for a few beers and really enjoyed it. It is a gorgeous restaurant, a chain yes, but I loved the design. We sat at the bar, self seating. I had a Snake bite (Guiness stout and Woodchuck Amber cider mix) and a Red Apple, (the house Irish Red brew and Woodchuck Amber cider mix,) both delicious! The boy had the house Hefeweizen (a little too fruity for our taste,) and then ordered a Pauliner. We decided to have a snack as well. They have an appetizer menu, and then a snack menu. The appetizers are all around $10 and HUGE. We rarely ever agree on what to order and weren't that hungry so we went for the snack menu. He ordered the ahi sear, and I the caprese salad. Both were pretty good! Service was excellent, Jennifer waited on us. We thought the food was good and the beer great. A little pricey, yes, but just stopping for a couple of beers. not bad! Go check it out and see for yourself!  Oh yeah, they're known for their pizza? Saw a few come out and they looked good! Maybe next time!"
Rob H.,"Austin, TX",248,317,230,4.0,12/31/2011,"As far as local pizza / brewing COs go this has a more corporate feel to it than small brewing Co but it is good. The deep dish pizza is awesome! I don't usually care for deep dish either. The service is great. Our recent trip was handled by a waiter named ""Austin"" and he did a great job. If you have never been; BJs is a must."
Rick R.,"Spring, TX",8,2,,5.0,1/19/2013,"Chain restaurant, but the staff at this one is particularly competent."
Ashleigh P.,"Spring, TX",12,9,,1.0,3/16/2011,"Crappy service...took forever to get food or drinks. I also ordered happy hour items that where advertised ON my table for one price when I got my check. I pointed it out to the server and she laughed and said ""oh that's only at the bar"". I asked her if maybe she thought it might be a good idea to have that mentioned in writing or at least tell a patron verbally when u see thats what their ordering and she laughed again and said ""i know right"" and rung my card up. When I talked to the manager he was a complete ass about it and told me it should not have been on the table and then he just stared at me. Never once apologize or offered to fix it. Pizza was cold. Ahi Poke was warm. My beer and salad where OK soi give them one star for that. Never will I return again."
Tom G.,"Houston, TX",27,68,15,3.0,10/30/2011,"Parmesian crusted chicken was wonderful, side of mashed taters and rice was good.  Loved the menu, will be back to try some of the other dishes.  Only drawback was the service.  Friendly staff, but pretty slow. Otherwise would have given a 4 star."
Christy H.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,2.0,1/29/2011,"The food is OK, but be prepared for a long wait to be seated and forget about calling ahead.  The staff who answer the phones have no idea what they're doing and the manager was useless.  Had issues both times we went."
Max C.,"Montgomery, TX",0,33,3,2.0,9/29/2013,"I gave it plenty of tries before posting my review, but last night was finally my last visit to this place. I've been in different Bjs in south Cali and this one has nothing to do with those. Service is just plain awful. Server spilled my soup which at $6 it's already precious (he didn't even apologize); I had to ask several times for one thing, cause he kept forgetting, even though it was 10 PM and we were probably the 3rd table in the whole place. The wings were horrible, cold and not cooked all the way. The flatbread, I'm still waiting for the cheese. I'm surprise how this place has lasted so long. We'll they sure won't see me again."
