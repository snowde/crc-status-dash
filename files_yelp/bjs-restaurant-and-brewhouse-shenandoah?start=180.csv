Tim P.,"Montgomery, TX",0,4,,1.0,12/31/2012,"Typically I can find something good to say but...not so following my latest trip to BJ's. I have tried the restaurant several times, trying to give them an honest chance.  I have never been overly impressed.  This last outing was my last try. When our order came the calzone was cold and not made according to my request.  Our pizza was burnt.  When I asked to have my calzone fixed and reheated they brought it back cold a second time.  To top it off the waitress seemed very apathetic to our concerns.  To me this place is not worth my money."
Brad T.,"College Station, TX",1,20,,4.0,12/14/2011,"One word review - ""Go."" We loved this place. Great for a Sunday after church or any time really. Yeah, they contract brew - but its with St. Arnolds, so its quality (though they should use Southern Star instead...)  They also  have a great beer selection of commercial beers.  Compared to something as awful as the Yardhouse, this place rules for a chain.  Our food and service has always been better than any other place we went in the Woodlands (finding mediocre service is a pleasant surprise anywhere in the Woodlands...sigh...)  Their Pizza rocks - get ""The Works"" - its about as good as it gets as a deep dish and took me back home to my youth outside of Chicago.  Oh - and they are kid friendly!  Just go - good beer - good food - good service - what else do you want?"
Dustin C.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,2,12,4.0,4/26/2011,I love the sh*t out of this place! Nice food! I only went one time and on that occasion I didnt get what I should have gotten...I ordered the balsamic glazed chicken. It was delicious along with a ale beer to drink! Next time I go i will get the chicken marsala....(or something like that)...I hear its a knock out!! I'm definatly a fan!!!
David C.,"Spring, TX",4,13,6,4.0,8/9/2011,One of my favorite restaurants.  The pizza is the best I have had in Texas.  The desserts are incredible.  The beer is good.  My only complaint is the long wait.
C. Paul C.,"Spring, TX",36,31,39,2.0,12/30/2010,"BJ's is a place of contradictions. While the decor is contemporary, it isn't far removed from a large sports bar. The waitstaff was very courteous but they were understaffed. The menu selection was exceptional but the food tasted like water. If I were to go back it would only be for the appetizers and beers."
Ambrose T.,"Houston, TX",1,65,1,4.0,8/8/2011,"I'm such a sucker for this place.   Yes, it's a big chain.  But it's a good chain.  The pizza is good, they have a great selection of Belgian beers (where else do you even find Maredsous in The Woodlands?) for reasonable prices and the entire place is bound not to offend anyone.  My only complaint, is who has a ton of TV's in a dining room? Above the bar, fine.  And you"
Ron B.,"Spring, TX",0,38,,4.0,2/14/2014,"We went to BJs Restaurant and Brewhouse in Shenandoah tonight to get the free birthday pizookie desert. Had to wait for a table because they are always crowded. Always loved the food here and the service has always been great. Were seated in a timely manner and ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie along with two Irish Cream Coffee's. Irish Coffee's came out pretty quick..but..they did not look right. We previously had Irish Coffee's in a number of restaurants in Galveston where we spent four days enjoying the sites. This did not look anything like what we have been drinking. Tasted it, was okay but no Baily's Irish Cream. Drink looked black like dark coffee, but you could smell the whiskey. Inquired with the waiter about the drinks. He stated that the original Irish Coffee was served with Jameson Whiskey in coffee and no Bailey's. (when we arrived home, I checked on the internet under 'the origin of Irish Coffee' and found at:   that back in 1952 a couple of guys perfected the Irish Coffee that was served in Ireland at the Airport and they nailed it. It does have a Cream poured on top of the coffee that would float.) ...and the majority of the Irish Cream Coffee's served always use Bailey's Irish Cream in the Coffee, and this is what we are used too. They charge $7.75 for their Irish Coffee, which is kind of high for what you get. So, BJ's would be wrong. The employees there are only following the orders passed down from management on what is in their Irish Cream Coffee...which is what we ordered.  The Triple Chocolate Pizookie was EXCELLENT as it always is. Thank you BJ's for the free desert but C'mon-Man, get with it on the Irish Cream Coffee. The waitress and waiter were terrific and understood what we really wanted. By the way...BJ's has an Artichoke/Spinach Pizza that is the best ANYWHERE. If you have not tried this, do so. You Will Luv It."
Janet M.,"Spring, TX",0,2,,1.0,5/6/2012,"We come here a lot and generally it is good, however we find it very inconsistent as of late . The one bartender is great, and the other horrible. I ordered their new chicken wontons and the plate came out looking like it had been recycled, the mint was brown, not a little bit but one complete leaf. The garnish for for plate was brown, yikes ! When I pointed it put to the manager he tried to pass it off as the plate being too hot. Ya right. Anyway if you want to feel completely irrelevant  you won' t be disappointed here."
