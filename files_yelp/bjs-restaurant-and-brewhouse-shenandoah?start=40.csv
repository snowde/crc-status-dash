Kendrick A.,"Spring, TX",103,19,6,5.0,7/23/2017,"The ONLY complaint my family has was the portion/price size, burgers, steaks, salad, chicken. The waitress was awesome, atmosphere chill and the beer selection was immense. We would absolutely return."
Thuy T.,"Shenandoah, TX",0,4,,1.0,5/27/2017,I ordered prime rib medium rare with a side of asparagus and green beans. The prime rib came out with asparagus and mashed potatoes instead. They took the plate back to replace it with the corrected sides and when it came back out the prime rib was well done instead of medium rare. I was told by Rebecca their hospitality manager that that is how their prime rib was made when clearly the first time the prime rib came out it was medium rare.  Rebecca was lecturing me how prime rib is cooked that way and if I want medium rare I can get a steak instead.
David M.,"Pasadena, TX",12,2,1,4.0,5/7/2017,"Good food, good selection of craft brews. Good service from friendly staff. Only thing is the draft and bottle list states pints for a majority of the beers, but the pours are 12oz. The glasses are not pints. All in all still a good place to eat & drink"
Jody G.,"Austin, TX",1,40,,3.0,5/2/2017,"The burgers took a very long time, once received, mine was burnt when asked for medium.  The roll on another of our plates was so hard, it would cause damage if you threw it at someone. Reported burnt burger, server took it back, offered to recook, I declined.  If she had sent a manager over or didnt act like it happened all the time as a course of business, wouldn't have been a big deal. Ribs pretty good, son's burger was fine..looked good even. **manager did reach out, will try again and get the pizza which is always great."
Nicolette E.,"Fairwood, Cypress, TX",45,2,,5.0,6/24/2017,I was waiting on my friend and stopped in to watch the Astro's late game and my favorite beer(piranha). The bartender was very friendly and made me feel at home! Definitely going to be back!!!
B R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",0,1,1,5.0,6/23/2017,Our waitress Kierra was wonderful and her recommendation of the tomatoe and mozerella salad was spot on!
Katrina T.,"Spring, TX",10,87,19,4.0,8/28/2016,Our server was the best!  He gets 5 stars if I could just rate him! My silverware had food on it and he promptly gave me some more. My husband food was waaaaay to salty and they fixed it quickly. The manager came over and apologized and they took half off my husband dish which we didn't expect
Colisa V.,"Humble, TX",0,13,4,1.0,4/19/2017,This place is horrible service the service was very slow we sat down at 715 and still have not gotten our food it's now 807 poor management would never recommend this place..
Jared N.,"Conroe, TX",0,8,,1.0,5/22/2017,"The person for takeout I talk to multiple times was Taylor. The curbside pick up is ridiculous. Whoever runs this part of the restaurant needs to be fired. This is the second time I've tried to use this service, and it is terrible. They don't bring your food out and let it sit in the heating oven. Today I tried to use it to get my pregnant wife some food while I brought my other daughter with me. She fell asleep at her normal bedtime, and I called three times but yet no one came out to deliver my food. I had to wake my daughter up and go inside. Don't offer a service if you're not going to follow your own rules"
Michelle Z.,"Conroe, TX",0,2,2,3.0,1/11/2017,"This was my first time with my boyfriend at Bj's and we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get our food, we didn't order anything big so didn't know why it took so long for our food to come out. But the mozzarella sticks were probably the best."
Peter R.,"The Woodlands, TX",28,2,,1.0,5/12/2017,"Normally a good experience but this time... totally forgot our table. 1-1/2 hours later after complaints they only offer up half a ticket, even after 3 meals not touched and 2 pizzas were left behind."
Jan C.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,1.0,7/7/2017,"My family and I just walked out after receiving THE WORST customer service I've seen in a while!!!! First, as we drove up, it was slightly raining and there was a young man walking a lady to her car with an umbrella. I figured since he saw us pull up, he would offer to allow us to use the umbrella but not. That was ok because we had two in the car. Once we got in, we were seated and I purposely looked at my phone to check the time to see how long it was going to take them to help us. After sitting there for a minute or two watching all these servers walking back and forth and another lady setting up a table, as she walked by I asked if someone could help us. She said let me get your server. She walked off and went and got someone but instead of helping us she helped her put more forks on the table. I didn't say anything. I just continued to watch. She then went back to the front and stood there, looked around and stood there. We waited and no one ever came so we got up to leave. Oh yea, another couple came in after us and were helped before us! As we got up, another lady said she was right behind us because they brought her food and didn't bring her drinks. As we were walking out, the hostess said have a good night. I told her I would with no thanks to them and told her what happened. By the time I was done the manager was following me out the door to hear what I had to say! My husband is a 21year RETIRED US VETERAN and I don't take it lightly when people mistreat him. After I get done typing this and drinking my drink and eating my burger from Red Robin, I will be writing their corporate office!"
Brad D.,"Houston, TX",0,34,2,2.0,9/4/2016,"Food here is always below expectations. How can you expect A fry cook to sear a steak or properly char brussel sprouts. You get a burnt mess. Fifty bucks for lunch for 2. Appetizer was decent. My Bison burger was burnt. Hair stuck to my dirty fork wrapped in a dirty black napkin.Had to replace it. My wife Orders a salad with no tomatoes, guess what it was covered With? Her Shrimp/asparagus pasta is gross. Shrimp don't taste Fresh at all. Why did we ever come back here? This is High Rent Chili's. It sucks. Do yourself a favor, go to Black Walnut, Or Buffalo Wild Wings for crap sake. At least you're not going to pay for "" the craft brewery"". Screw BJ. You Suck. All you hipster Craft brew, neck beard friggin' phonies will love the ""ambiance"". Just stick to the appetizer menu, losers."
Crystal D.,"Prescott, AZ",174,6,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Super bummed with our visit here today. I typically love this place as the menu is so large that with large groups of people, everyone can get what they want. But today, our waiter was terrible. Everyone has bad days but geez. We sat there for 20 minutes with nothing but waters. He hadn't even stopped by or looked at us to see if we were ready to order. The manager was handling complaints from a table next to us he was waiting at as well. Yikes. Might not come back for a while."
Alyson H.,"Houston, TX",4,114,65,2.0,12/10/2016,"Food was the worst it's ever been! Pizza was soggy on the inside and stale on the outside. Cheese sticks were obviously frozen and not fresh. Service was not that great, we had to ask for water refills 3 times each so 9 total. Best part about tonight, you can't screw up beer!!!! Brew house blonde is my favorite!!! Made the experience bearable."
Heather D.,"Oakland, CA",57,300,147,4.0,7/5/2016,"I love this stupid place!  Walk in and get a $4. pint of Jeremiah Red.  This time, I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad, which had super fresh fish and greens and wonderful crispy won tons.  The best part, is the menu is so diverse any time you go you will find just the thing that hits the spot.  From burgers to flat breads they just do it right."
Fred F.,"Conroe, TX",0,6,,5.0,8/17/2017,"We have been eating at BJ's for the last 8 years.  The staff is friendly and if I ever had a problem they exceeded my expectations!  What more can you ask for?  I see people complain after they leave an establishment without giving the staff a chance to resolve the issue.  If you have a problem just ask. We are going again today and expect the usual, great food, great service and great value.  P.S.  they have great coupons and will let you use them for take out!!"
Elle G.,"The Woodlands, TX",132,97,193,3.0,7/3/2015,"We tried the Carnita Fries with Chile Verde for the first time today. The green chile was great and we gobbled them up.  However, the pulled pork was not pulled, there were a couple of chunks that we had to cut our selves. Also most of the cheese was under all the fries, not sure how or why that happened.   My daughter has the Santa Fe salad with Shrimp and she loved it.  Plenty of grilled shrimp.   Husband had the Tavern Pizza and he said it was best pizza he's has in a long time.  I had the Lemon thyme chicken and substituted quinoa for the brown rice.  I'm not sure what happened with this dish, because it's what I always order.  For some reason there was a bitter taste and not the usual lemony flavor I love so much.  I posted picks of the dishes while there so I wouldn't forget, but the overall experience for me was so-so. And for that I rated them 3 stars."
Willie And Melissa E.,"Conroe, TX",160,26,5,3.0,1/28/2017,"Our family visited this restaurant for my son's birthday recently. We had a party of 10. We attempted to call ahead and get on the list just in case, but they wouldn't take call aheads over 6 people. When we arrived, we were greeted by the same hostess that took my call earlier. She was welcoming and friendly. We arrived quite early in the evening, so fortunately there wasn't a wait. We only had to wait about 5-7 minutes for them to get our table set up. Once seated, our waiter was very attentive while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. We ordered the fried cheese and calamari to start. Both dishes were delivered lukewarm. We've visited this restaurant many times before and had much better. They tasted as though they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a little too long. I ordered the American bacon cheeseburger and it was good. My wife had the chicken tortilla soup with a salad. The kids had chicken and burgers. The rest of our family got various dishes from fish and chips to the steak. I didn't hear any complaints from anyone. The thin cut fries are yummy and crispy and they always offer a heaping portion with the meal. The only negative seemed to be the temperature of the food. We like food brought hot and very fresh, but all the dishes seamed to have been sitting under a heat lamp a little too long waiting for someone to run it to our table. Another negative was that our dishes were brought out maybe two at a time. Some of us had our food in front of us but had to wait for the other dishes to be delivered before we could start eating. Throughout the meal, they began seating more large parties around us in our same waiter's section, slowing down our service immensely. For some odd reason they sit all large parties in the same area in this restaurant with the same server. Because of this, we were done with our meals and waiting for what seemed like forever just to order our desserts. Being that it was my son's birthday, we couldn't leave without a pazookie. It is a must if you visit this place. The cookies are baked fresh and served with a generous scoop of ice cream. Delicious! Get the mini for yourself. The regular size is more than enough to share with one or two more people. Once we finally ordered our desserts, we waited for probably 10-15 minutes (to be expected for this dessert) but when they brought them out, somehow everyone but my son got their dishes. His came out about 5 minutes later. The server was in the weeds with no backup, so we sat without drink refills for way too long. In conclusion, the food is mediocre, the desserts are amazing, the service is okay (but they need to spread out the big parties to other servers) and the restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will be back with my family for dinner in the future, but I doubt I will return with a large party."
NewMrs P.,"Spring, TX",0,33,7,3.0,8/7/2017,"Haven't been here for a long time because parking had become impossible!  We were here on Sunday afternoon, able to park (!!) and have been pleasantly surprised with the change in menu and better quality of good.  Always good cold beer and we enjoy sitting in the bar and watching the game.  I had the BJ flatbread pizza, very very good (ask for extra sauce otherwise you can't find it!) and husband had a burger. We both enjoyed the food!  Decent service too!"
