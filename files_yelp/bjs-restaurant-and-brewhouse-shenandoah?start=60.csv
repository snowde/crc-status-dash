Natalie A.,"Spring, TX",57,7,,5.0,6/28/2017,"Hands down best place to grab a late night meal in the woodlands area. Menu is huge with a little bit of everything for everyone. Staff is super friendly and quick to accommodate your needs. Our server Derek knew the menu front and back and made some great recommendations. Food came out at a timely manner and tasted great. Medi pita tacos are the bomb as well as the beer Jeremiah Red and of course their infamous pizookie. As if I wasn't impressed enough, Tuesday is half priced wine night. Would definitely recommend to all my friends in the area."
Brett S.,"Houston, TX",12,49,2,3.0,10/13/2016,"This is my first time at bjs. I had the jalapeño burger, it was pretty good. Good atmosphere and waiter was friendly. Definitely won't be my last bj."
Bob H.,"Spring, TX",0,24,,4.0,6/23/2016,"I had the flatbread pizza and my wife had the Cobb salad , both very good. Service was excellent.  Returned once again. I had the North Beach Mali and Shrimp. Excellent. My wife had the Parmesan crusted chicken and it was excellent as well"
FoodMakes M.,"Houston, TX",1,88,28,3.0,7/18/2016,"Drink - watermelon basil margarita.  Too much syrup though the alcohol content was on par.  It would have been more refreshing if it weren't so thick.  I attempted to let the ice melt, but it didn't help the texture much. Appetizer - sampler of mozzarella sticks, avocado egg rolls, garlic parmesan boneless chicken wings, and spinach artichoke dip with chips.  Cheese sticks and marinara met expectations.  Nothing bad to say.  Avocado rolls had too much avocado and not much else.  The tamarind sauce on the side is what made it worthwhile.  Very great flavor that I used to dip the garlic parmesan bites into.  The chicken was tender and lightly breaded, but could have used more sauce drizzle.  Some what dry but rectified with the tamarind sauce intended for the avocado rolls.  And the dip would have been okay had it not been dried out.  I prefer creamy and less clump so I can actually get it on the chip without breakage.  $17.95 for the platter was a bit pricy. Side salad - romaine, iceberg, and spinach.  Strawberry vinaigrette was light enough.  Normal enough salad. Main entrée - Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos.  Decent size and good amount of protein.  Just seemed like something was missing and it was very dry.  I asked for cucumbers and red onions to be removed....but think they also left out the cilantro.  Reasonably priced at $9.95 since I substituted the side grains for the side salad. The desserts were limited.  I didn't bother to try the pizookie they seem to be known for.  They had options but it just didn't seem like what I wanted to complement the meal.  Overall, I enjoyed that our server knew the menu well.  She never hesitated in answering our questions.  She was however not very attentive and we could have used refills on waters.  At the end of the meal, we waited too long for her to return and take payment that we decided to pay at the take out register. I probably would only come back for a happy hour special but there was nothing to draw me back.  I have enjoyed other trips to BJ's in other states (Cali/Washington) but didn't feel the same about the dining experience here."
Misty K.,"New Caney, TX",19,8,24,3.0,6/6/2016,"Great food, love the Deco and atmosphere, however, don't go here hungry, we've been twice and they are VERY slow and our waitress was rubbing her/and other waiters back (yea, gross!) And she had no clue how to work their app and she called a manager over and she didn't know how it worked either.. all else aside they are very SLOW to bring your food out. Inexcusable with such a huge staff, unless only like one cook. JS"
Levi G.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Finally decided to give this place another chance after 2 years of staying as far away as possible. They still have average food but the service is what has kept us away in the first place. The waiter was very nice and apologized to us multiple times for waiting an hour for our food. The actual food order was taken 20 minutes after we ordered our drinks and the drinks themselves took 20 minutes to arrive. All of this could be overlooked but when the hostess rolls her eyes when you ask for a highchair, well you kind of get upset. We won't be giving this place another chance and hope that you won't either."
Jeremiah K.,"Houston, TX",4,15,10,5.0,3/21/2016,The app and ease of payment were great for the lunch rush. Great unlimited salad and soup combo deal.
Niabi R.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2017,"This used to be one of our fav spots for both food and drink. This time we waited 20 minutes for the waiter to even approach our table and the restaurant was far from busy. Eventually I complained to the hostess and she went to find our waiter. When the waiter finally came, he didn't apologize or introduce himself; he just asked what we wanted to drink..... literally ""what do you want to drink"". Took another 15 minutes before bringing the water... still didn't bring the wine so we informed the hostess we were going to the bar. We hoped for better service. Service was faster but the bartender's personality was 0. She was nearly scowling and did not speak unless spoken to. At least the food was ok although overpriced (it really wasn't THAT good) and the bazookies were amazing."
Todd L.,"Spring, TX",24,1,,5.0,7/22/2017,Derek was a fantastic waiter! Our food was incredible and they had great service. Fish and chips are delicious and the beer is awesome. Would highly recommend for a date night!
Alex D.,"Spring, TX",1,20,18,1.0,1/25/2016,"Went out the eat here on a Friday night.  We got there around 9:45.  The place was not busy. We got seated. Waited 30 minutes for our waiter just to ask for our drinks. While she came by to take our drink order we ordered food, because who knew when she would be back around. We waited another 45 minutes for our pizza to come out. While the pizza came out, we had no silverware to eat with. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to come by and ask us if we needed anything. We had no silverware to eat with. Our food had gotten cold by this point. While we were eating the waiter did not come by to ask us if we needed a refill which we were out on drink. She came by asked us if we wanted dessert and we said yes, and she just bought the check out thinking we were done eating and having drinks. Had our dessert and left. Did not want to be had this place with the waiter not offering good service.  Mostly would not go back to this location again."
Julia K G.,"Montgomery, TX",1,18,9,1.0,5/25/2017,"The following is a copy of a letter that I composed and sent to corporate offices that I never received the consideration in a response in ---------- Forwarded message --------- Date: Tue, Feb 3, 2015 at 11:38 PM Subject: Inappropriate attention to detail To:  02-03-2015 Location of complaint: The Woodlands TX, 19075 I-45 South, 600, Shenandoah, TX 77385 I am stating a formal complaint regarding the disregard in professional accommodation to a client's needs in diplomacy to mutually resolve unsatisfactory food and beverage requests. My grievances include several circumstances that occurred the evening of 02-03-2015, and are described as follows: All soda beverages were not carbonated and service was unacceptable in having the drinks replaced. My son and I were never able to have this issue resolved and much to my dismay I was furthered charged per drink, so I was inconvenienced into dispute resolution with a manager to elevate the problem. My primary complaint and concerns are the result of an order of ""Garlic Chicken Wings"" and when we realized that the inside meat was frozen and there was visual evidence of blood. I brought this to the waiter's attention and he offered to have them ""cooked up more"". I declined his offer and advised him to remove the order from my bill. Unwilling to do so, It was necessary to request a manager. Unfortunately our waiter was not attentive in compelling this particular individual to join us at our table or the manager refused to do so. The disconcerting  attention of the manager proved to be apathetic and noncompliant in professionally offering concessions for the unacceptable circumstances in a regrettably disrespectful and argumentative approach. The manager denied the problem and informed me that he would agree to recook the item or replace it with the same item, but refused to replace the order with another selection associated with the uncooked meat. I declined this offer and proceeded to inform him that I would insure that my credit card company decline the charge to BJ's if the fountain drinks and raw meat appetizer wasn't removed from my charges. The manager begrudgingly then removed the charges from my bill. I was not offered qualifying options to rectify or compensate me for the problem. This circumstance was my first and last encounter with the ""BJ's"" brand."
Lari R.,"Conroe, TX",0,1,,5.0,6/18/2017,"Great food and service!!  Kierra is the best, she's attentive, positive and has a great personality.  She went out of her way to accommodate my son while we dined!!"
Jay R.,"Houston, TX",0,21,42,5.0,10/22/2016,"5 stars for the awesome customer service received by our waiter, Mitchell!  He was great from beginning to end...I ended up having  an issue with my food but he quickly resolved the problem and with a smile ! I will return again for that level of customer service alone"
Rocheryl T.,"Secaucus, NJ",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2017,"I only gave 1 star because of the final waitress we had which I will get to later. This was by far the worst experience I have had at a BJ's. This was the Woodlands location. Let me start by saying I made reservations a week in advance so they were aware of the large party. However, the size of the party had nothing to do with it. We arrived at the restaurant and still had to wait 15-20 min to be seated. When we reached our seats we waited another 15-20 minutes before we were informed that they were backed up and our waitress would be with us. After another 15-20 min still no visit from our assigned waitress, Kierra. After approaching the hostess stand to ask who our waiter/waitress was I was told she was wrapping up with another large party and would be with ya shortly. After about 5-10 min the HOSTESS comes over and says she will have to take our drink order. We requested to put in orders for appetizers and were told that she couldn't take appetizer order, I understand you are a hostess. We are 45 min in and  still no visit from Kierra. I only know her name because we were told that's who our waitress was when we requested to speak with a manager.  We are now an hour in and the hostess brings waters to the table behind us but don't serve us. She just sits them on the table behind us. 1:10 we decide to flag down Alexis who has been diligently waiting on her tables and ask for a manager and explained we still have not received drinks and were told we could not order appetizers. This is the same waitress that came to apologize for Kierra early. She confirmed our drink orders that we gave the hostess got them to our table and put in our appetizers. She also got the manager who did NOTHING except say we will get 2 waiters to make up which did not happen. I failed to get his name but it doesn't matter because we will not be back. Alexis my message to you is to go to a restaurant where they will appreciate your hard work. Try Grotto they were excellent. Alexis you did excellent and because of you we will possibly visit a different BJ's. Keep up the good work."
Casey F.,"Richmond, TX",1,2,,5.0,4/30/2017,We decided to stop at bjs last night and had a great experience!! Food was delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful! Had a small issue with our drinks not being correct but the general manager stopped by the table and quickly corrected the issue and made sure we left happy!! We will definitely be back!!
Alex N.,"Spring, TX",18,101,42,5.0,4/24/2015,"BEEEEEEEEER Das Gut!. I like good beer. This place has a lot of it.  FOOOOOOOOD noms. Wife approved=me getting to go back and drink more beer. #holla  We got some goofy appetizers (I randomly picked).... calamari and some ahi tuna. both were great. Wife got a burger, and liked the hell outta it.  I got some random pizza the server said to get.... It aint no pizza zone, but it was still good. SERRRRRVIIIICCCCEEE really bueno. Server knew his beers- Although we argued on what beer was better (I like stouts, he likes IPA's) it all in a fun joking manner.  Waiter said they used to have a 8 beer sampler, but patrons were getting too drunk. Pansies. I drank 12. No, I didn't drive afterwards. Overall, this is a nice place, nicely set up, beer is gud, food is gud, service is gud.  What's there to complain about?"
Micki T.,"Houston, TX",0,3,1,5.0,2/2/2016,"I just went here for the first time and all I can say is wow! I had the Bacon Avocado burger with a lemonade and the chocolate chip pizookie for dessert. The burger was fully loaded, messy, and cooked to perfection. The pizookie is something that is a must! It was warm with the cookie but cold with the ice cream on top.  The atmosphere was very friendly and casual. Everyone there working also seemed very professional and polite. I would recommend this for anyone going on a date, dinner with the family, or just to have a drink by yourself."
Carter D.,"Conroe, TX",0,4,,3.0,5/26/2017,"Ok. So I really have a love/hate relationship with this place. They get a 5 for their food. However, every time I have been, the service has been atrocious! We barley ever see our servers and everything takes so long to get delivered to our table. The soft drinks are never carbonated and are always flat and sweaty. On several occasions, the food has taken an hour plus to make. Managers all always at people's tables cleaning up employees mistakes and apologizing. It takes about 20-30 minutes for appetizers to come out, followed shortly with the main course. I will say the pizookie is the reason I keep coming back, it is wonderful. But it takes about half an hour to get to our table too. It is really sad because I love the food, but the service is always awful. It doesn't matter if it's a week night or weekend, busy or not, it is awful every time. Also, there is always a wait when there are several open tables, and when I went on a date one night, we were seated in a circular booth for 6. Really hope they can get their act together with the service, because the food really is amazing."
Tim V.,"Cedar Park, TX",19,257,133,3.0,3/2/2015,"Was here for my daughters soccer tournament and brought the girls in.  The staff did a fair job trying to accommodate such a large drop in party BUT could have done a better job. The food was on par with all the other BJ's i have been too and i love the beer selection.  Our server was a bit slow on service and drink re-fills.   Seems like every BJ's I go to there is alwas something they miss, if its wait time, food order wrong, slow staff, bill mix ups (like this one).   I'd just like some consistency."
Annie A.,"Conroe, TX",66,73,16,5.0,8/17/2016,"We loved the vast menu and the Nitwit shandy was delicious.  We were celebrating, so we had the party pizookie and it was amazing."
