Jamie A.,"Spring, TX",127,304,760,4.0,10/7/2014,"BJ's is a fantastic place to hang out with your friends, have some great drinks, and good food.  It's always pretty busy, but they do offer a call ahead service.  Just call before you leave your house, get your name on the list, and you will be seated shortly after you arrive.  They also have a great rewards program.  You get special offers via email and you earn points for free stuff every time you dine. They have over 50 handcrafted beers to choose from as well as a full bar.  I'm a vodka kind of gal and they serve up a nice strong Cosmo!  I keep wanting to try new things, but my favorite starter is the fried artichoke hearts with lemon aioli.  So addictive!  This time I added a mozzarella and tomato salad.  It was fresh tasting and beautifully presented, but the cherry tomatoes lacked flavor.  Some nice heirloom tomatoes would have really completed the dish. Their pizzas look fantastic, but again being the creature of habit that I am, I have a heard time straying away from my favorite dish. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my jam. Marinated chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs and fried golden brown. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce. Yum!  It is a healthy sized portion and can be shared with two people, unless of course I'm one of those two people. If you have room for dessert, definitely try a Pizookie.  It's a cookie in a deep dish pizza pan served hot with a big scoop of ice cream on top.  It comes in a wide variety of sinfully delicious combinations.  You will Leave BJ's full and happy."
James D.,"Spring, TX",0,13,,3.0,4/24/2017,Worst service I have experienced in a BJ's restaurant. Long delays in service with omissions and miscues. Not very busy so a frustrating lunch
Sara B.,"Ferndale, MI",99,402,28,3.0,12/31/2014,"Upon first inspection this place looks pretty nice and seems to have a good menu with lots of options. It reminds me a lot of Granite City Brewery, actually. I was pleased that our party of 7 was almost immediately accommodated, and our waiter was attentive.  Everyone seemed fairly pleased with their food, but no one was really blown away. I had the Asian chicken salad and a bit of my man's pizza. The pizza crust was a bit tougher than I expected and there wasn't anything special about it. My salad was alright, but I'm always looking for some kind of greens or lettuce other than iceberg or romaine. I felt like the chicken portion was scarce, and the dressing was overly sweet.  Our party also had a few beers that were fine, but nothing new. Two standard IPAs, and a hefeweizen that was more like Oberon with an orange slice. Not necessarily true to character, but enjoyable enough.  All in all, I think it wasn't a bad experience, but it probably won't be terribly high on my list of places to go in the future."
Heidi M.,"Conroe, TX",0,2,,2.0,4/13/2017,Have eaten here several times but tonight was horrible!  Service was terribly slow.  When we did get it wasn't what we had ordered.  And what we did order (Brussels sprouts) were terrible.  Very disappointing.
Brittany N.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,18,6,1.0,9/27/2015,"Have been to this BJs multiple times and had a less than stellar experience. The service is awful. Took upwards of 10 minutes to get service and even then we had to ask. The drinks haven't stayed filled and the tea was warm melting the ice with no ice provided until we requested it.  Food was sub par compared to other BJs. Salads were not fresh and hastily thrown together. The fries were old and cold. Burger orders did not come out right. And when we spoke to the manager about the service issues, he apologized but said it was due to being busier than expected and he knows about the issues. Would not waste the calories or the money on this place."
Angela B.,"Dallas, TX",2,18,1,5.0,2/6/2016,"I must dote on the service of this on particular BJs. Last Sunday I was going from Houston to Dallas and decided to stop at Bjs, which are really growing on me! The hostess/servers at the front were so friendly and welcoming.  I sat at the bar and they made sure I had a menu moments after I sat.  The bartender was friendly and she checked on me regularly.  They were so on their game it was like double service! This time I had the baked ziti (if you haven't done the salmon quinoa bowl, you must) and it was just what I needed for the long drive."
Dan F.,"Spring, TX",147,385,417,4.0,11/23/2014,"This place is always packed. I will say I love the atmosphere and the Nutty Brunette is super good!!  The Pazookie is crazy good. For such a huge menu, I think they execute the good very well. I will go back."
Damian G.,"Humble, TX",5,92,17,2.0,11/30/2014,"Underwhelmed.   They do not brew any of their own beer here. When I asked for a specific beer the waiter starts telling me what HE likes and what I ordered is crap.  How insulting.  Let's get to the food. The calamari over cooked and all tentacles. Weird.  Should be allot of rings for each set of tentacles.  We Sent it back.  Removed from the bill so that was ok.   Burgers.  So so. Nothing special.  Mine was under cooked.  But after the other issues, I ate around the raw parts.  I won't be back.  Plenty of better places in the area"
Ave Maria H.,"Houston, TX",182,60,4,1.0,4/20/2016,"I have personally never met a person as rude as the bartender we had today. I decided to sit at the bar because I was waiting for a friend and 75% of the time the bartender is so friendly and welcoming; not Patrick. He was quite the opposite. He was standoffish and honestly rude. I personally saw him huff and make a face while my friend was in conversation with someone we saw who we use to work with. I guess our conversations annoyed him? Food was great thoigh, service was highly disappointing as we left feeling offended."
Jeff N.,"Hockley, TX",30,69,24,5.0,10/3/2015,"We went to BJs on a Saturday night for a friends birthday dinner. BJs is a big restaurant and has plenty of seating. Tables, booths etc. they have a huge menu (in my opinion that is too big with to many choices.) BJs menu is priced well and they are between a Red Robin and a TGIF. Not really low end and not high end. My rule of thumb is if you want a steak you go to a steak house, you want fish go to a fish house. BBQ well you get my point. They have everything on their menu, sorta like a jack of all trades but master of none. With that said I was pleasantly surprised that what my wife and I ordered was very good. She ordered the Ahi seared tuna salad and I ordered Jambalaya. She said her salad was very good and the tuna was also very good. I was not expecting anything but mediocre but my Jambalaya was as good as any New Orleans type restaurant I've been to. Others at the table ordered Fish and chips, Fried chicken and a steak. Everyone at the table said their food was very good. Our waiter was good and helpful with suggestions and we never ran out of drinks. Overall, anyone wanting a good mid priced meal at a restaurant with TVs and an up beat atmosphere you can't go wrong with BJs."
Ryan V.,"Spring, TX",11,234,3,2.0,4/14/2016,"After recent terrible experience with family, can't recommend due to service.  Corporate did try to make things right, so will update if they can impress in future."
DJ S.,"Keller, TX",38,63,31,1.0,4/27/2016,This used to be my go to business lunch place with clients. After a year I accumulated a lot of points. Well decided to go for a personal dinner and logged into my account. Went to look at my point balance and it stopped by over 1000 points. Interesting because I hadn't ever claimed any. Looks like someone had overheard me giving my number during a visit because they took it upon themselves to treat themselves multiple times. Hope you enjoyed your free meals clown. BJs will never get another $ from me.
Adam S.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,3,,5.0,1/21/2017,"We recently went to BJs and started off our meal with cocktails. They came quickly and were delicious. We found ourselves waiting a while for our food and even joked about getting a dessert for free. We were so impressed when the manager, a Rebecca, came to our table apologizing and offering to put our whole food ticket on the house, including dessert. The staff at this restaurant and our waiter, Matt, were so kind, apologetic, and accommodating. When the food came it was delicious as well. We will definitely be going again!!"
Kristin V.,"Tomball, TX",0,22,43,1.0,5/29/2016,"My friends and I chose to come to BJ's for a nice dinner together for Memorial Day weekend. However it was a complete nightmare! First off our server missed up our drinks and even eventually took a drink right out of my friends hand while she was drinking it! I used to be a server myself and have NEVER seen that before, completely unacceptable! Food was not good and cold. My fries were so crunchy I would not even eat them. I am so disappointed in how our meal went I will not be coming back to this BJ's."
Kim H.,"Conroe, TX",0,14,,3.0,12/14/2016,"I tried their curbside (to-go) service for the first time. The service was efficient and pleasant, but when I got home I noticed my Santa Fe salad was missing avocados (which their menu lists for it). Kind of a bummer considering it's a $12.95 salad. I'm sure they would've fixed it if I was dining in, but I was already home. Would go back though."
Steven G.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,92,21,1.0,6/9/2015,"Service was horrible, place was empty waited over an hour for food which most came out cold Saw roach on wall, busser took plate off closest table smashed it and put plate back Complained to manager....his response ""I don't know what you want me to do about that""  We did not pay, we will not return to ANY bj's"
Megan P.,"Conroe, TX",39,11,,5.0,6/8/2016,"Great place to go with family or friends, if you want amazing food and great service this is the place to go. Ask for Robert to serve you, he waited on us last time and I couldn't of asked for a better sever to wait on me and my family.. definitely will be going back soon"
Geri K.,"Houston, TX",277,74,18,5.0,4/2/2016,My husband and I came here for dinner because a friend of ours gave us a gift card. What a great experience!! Service and the food was fantastic!! We will definitely come back again.
Tiffiany W.,"Spring, TX",94,6,3,5.0,5/1/2015,Love love love Bj's but have to say tonight was not the usual. The bar tender hated his job and it showed in his horrible lack of service. But Guess everyone deserves a bad day from time to time! But thank you manager Dave for going over and beyond to ensure loyal customers continue to be loyal customers!!
Amelida O.,"Spring, TX",31,21,38,4.0,1/16/2015,"My husband and I really do like it here. The service could sometimes be better, but it's never been bad enough to make us never want to come back. I always get the Thai Chicken Mango salad which is so delicious every time. Drinks are pretty good as well."
