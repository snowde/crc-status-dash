Nate H.,"Mandeville, LA",235,208,394,4.0,11/8/2017,"Had dinner tonight at BJ's. Good food! Nice place. Very clean and well kept. Long bar with tons of different beers on tap. Lots of TVs. I had a 6"" mini deep dish pizza. It was an all meat pizza. $11.95!! Yes, $11.95 for a little personal pan pizza. I could have eaten two of them. My sister ordered the pulled pork sandwich that came with fries and slaw. She gave me half of her sandwich since I had little food compared to what she was served. The BBQ sandwiches are BIG and really good, although a bit messy. Our waitress was super friendly and checked on us often. I'll be back."
Zoe D.,"New Orleans, LA",192,15,21,5.0,10/8/2017,"This is a great pub! Stopped here to grab a good quick bite. I have to admit, it was a perfect stop. I ordered the tortilla soup as an appetizer and the lettuce wraps as a meal. The soup was perfect and the lettuce wraps were on point! Lettuce was crisp and the soup was just the right temperature to eat. Had a packed house, but I didn't have to wait. The waitress was phenomenal with suggestions! I can't wait to come back.  Came back a couple of times and this time we tried a pizza! Monday's are the best to get the pizza half priced. I even ordered one to go for the family at home. The pizza was scrumptious and hot."
Barry E.,"Brandon, MS",52,95,35,3.0,8/26/2017,The food is good but nothing special and really lacking for the price. The service both visits I have been has been lacking. It was not because they were busy either time  because we got here around 11:15 once and 4:30 the time before. Drink refills were hard to come by both times.  The beer selection is good and they carry a large selection.
Cherie B.,"New Orleans, LA",51,45,55,3.0,12/17/2017,The service was great.  We started with the avocado egg rolls which were fantastic.  After waiting a little while longer than expected our waitress said the kitchen only fired half of our ticket. She brought out the one entree which you could tell it was sitting under the heat lamp. Then the second came out within 10 min. For being a chain restaurant it's full of great things on the menu and reasonably priced. They did give us 2 desserts on the house the Hot Brownie topped with Ice cream. And that was delicious
DJ R.,"Bogalusa, LA",0,5,6,2.0,12/31/2017,The food was decent... after they had to redo it for my wife after I had already finished my meal. Then they thought I was going to pay for full service..... not will not come back
Joyce B.,"Palm City, FL",0,32,,5.0,12/31/2017,Great atmosphere to watch the game. Friendly service and good food. Clam chowder was tasty and appetizers of chips and dip were fresh and not super spicy. Love the heroes program that they run to thank someone in the military!
Angelle P.,"New Orleans, LA",5,6,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Food good ! Service Horrible .Tourean, C was our waitress! I never seen a waitress so slow, and have an attitude like she didn't want to be there. She needs to be written up or fired. Sooo uncalled for. The next table from us felt the same way. It's like she had others bring out our food, but didn't refill our drinks, when we got another waitress attention, that waitress waited on us immediately. When it came down to the check, Tourean,C was no where to be found. Unprofessional. Things like that is when you lose customers."
Jade M.,"Baton Rouge, LA",14,71,7,1.0,11/15/2017,"I really liked the baton rouge location, so I decided to go here. The staff ignores you and I ended up getting a bug infested pizza."
DeMarius J.,"Havelock, NC",100,1,1,2.0,11/10/2017,"I've tried to give this restaurant another fair chance...but unfortunately i won't be returning. The service has been more than questionable on both occasions. Their electronic system of placing orders has not EVER worked which results in the waiters/waitresses either trying to memorize my order (and get it wrong) or right on a napkin (and still get it wrong somehow). Not all of the food is bad...however as you can tell from the photo my asparagus came out dry and wilted. Additionally, we never got the appetizer we order. The staff was nice enough to recook our order...but let's be honest...ain't nobody got time for that!!!"
Hawsepiper ..,"New Orleans, LA",0,1,2,5.0,12/15/2017,"Great food, a wide variety,  superb service. That's what keep me coming back. Keep up the good work folks."
Suzanne M.,"Picayune, MS",0,10,5,4.0,12/5/2017,"Nice place to go for good food and beer. They have a great beer and drink selection. The service was good and we had a great waiter and waitress. There's lots of food choices from appetizers to desserts. The ribs were delicious. The meat on the ribs were tender, juicy and fall off the bone good!  The cookie desserts with ice cream are great! You should go try one"
Scott L.,"Slidell, LA",39,194,625,4.0,3/29/2017,"Had a late night dinner here - went for the deep dish personal pizza -  I think it was the Mediterranean - and it was very nicely done and presented well. Michelle behind the bar was terrific.  Nice ""sports bar"" atmosphere....worth checking out."
Robin C.,"Central Business District, New Orleans, LA",0,9,3,5.0,8/19/2017,"First visit to this location but I LOVE the one in Texas. Great menu, great atmosphere, and this is a good location in Slidell. Great food and service - we'll be back! We had steak, prime rib sandwich and mediterranean tacos all delicious."
Belinda R.,"Waveland, MS",120,1,,2.0,11/12/2017,"The only reason I'm leaving 2 stars is because management was very polite and kind about the whole thing. If it was just one mistake it would have been fine. But first I asked for extra green beans, she told them I wanted no green beans. I asked twice. They charged us double for our drinks. The burgers were burnt when we asked for medium. And the vegetables and burgers tasted like the grill caught on fire and smoke covered the food. It was really disappointing because I wanted to take my mother and husband out to their favorite place for veterans day. The restaurant wasn't even packed."
Erin M.,"New Orleans, LA",349,176,,1.0,6/19/2017,"I came here yesterday with my family of 10 for Father's day.  We live in New Orleans and called when we left the house and that was what we were instructed to do.  I called at 11:40pm I recieved a  text at 12:10pm that our table was ready in 5 minutes.  Well, that certainly wasn't the case at all.  We didn't get seated until 1:30pm.  The waiter was awful.  He brings drinks which was fine.  We ordered 2 apps.  The spinach and artichoke it was not to my liking.  We also had the artichoke hearts they were pretty good.  took forever for our food to come out.  My Dad and I spit the BJ classic flatbread.  It came out cold and soggy.  Pitiful for $15.00 flatbread!  The waiter brought refills with root beer and no ice.  So strange!  We finally left at 3:30pm.  Ridiculous and expensive!  Will not be returning!"
Marlo M.,"Palmdale, CA",17,517,1495,3.0,7/19/2017,"Great food but service lagged, I hate to see this place packed because it was a slow Wednesday night and it took forever, I can't complain about food the food was great but I really do wish service was better."
Erika J.,"Slidell, LA",8,50,40,2.0,10/15/2017,"I ate at this location two times but never going to again. This just proves for me that I just cant stand most chain restaurants anymore. At this particular location, the soup is never hot. Their clam chowder soup is just canned soup. Their bbq sauce they use for their pulled pork sandwich is so simple and bland, the bottom bun was soggy, they overstuffed it, and they wanna charge you almost $15 for that. It IS a chain restaurant so I shouldn't be surprised but there are so many other complaints (lol). Especially with their basic salads like with their chicken tender salad (whatever they wanna call that) the lettuce is majorly chopped up in bits and they only put 3 or 4 chicken tenders on it and wanna charge you $15 for it.... why??? I would rather spend $15 at Taco Hell. Never going to this chain restaurant again. The staff is nice and everything but the food is nothing special. Glad I'm not the sucker that wants to waste almost $30 on a piece of meat that isn't even fresh either."
Cherees R.,"Slidell, LA",25,5,3,4.0,10/11/2017,Great atmosphere and have never had a bad meal. Wish that they wouldn't advertise something and then not carry it ever.
Lindsey R.,"League City, TX",0,28,3,4.0,8/31/2017,"Food was good overall. I tried the kale and Brussels sprouts (sounds weird. It tastes great) it was very fresh and it had cranberries, grapes, and blueberries that were all in good shape and not old/withered. Too much dressing on it for me - my fault for forgetting to ask for it separately. Husbands fries were a bit too greasy but sandwich was good. Waitress was very efficient. I think her smile must hurt to use because I never saw it, she was friendly though. Order they brought out at first was wrong and I couldn't consume due to allergies, she noticed right away when she came to check on us and quickly got it fixed and no complaining from either end so that went well. Would recommend this place. I'll just have to remember to order dressing on the side next time :)."
Oscar G.,"Slidell, LA",81,6,1,5.0,10/14/2017,Love the food and atmosphere here. The burger and fries are amazing! The pizza is awesome. All around great place. Beer selection is sweet also.
Russell P.,"Watson, LA",0,3,2,1.0,9/21/2017,"Normally love BJ's but walked out of this one. I seated at the bar area and had no one approach me till I asked the server if anyone was working the area. The one she identified had passed by me no less than 3 times. She appeared to be more interested in her co-worker. At one point she was just chatting to him 2 tables away. Only after I stood up to ask bartender did she walk over to offer to help. I told her if she's the waitress I want nothing in the place. She then lied about just coming in. Well, I admit it's a white lie since her and her friend and just walked back in. Disappointed to the bartender could of flagged her a number of times to raise her awareness. My problem is resolved. Came into longhorn with twice the amount of people and the bartender got my drink order within 1-2 minutes. Nikita rocks. What a worker."
Lynn R.,"Slidell, LA",1,19,34,4.0,12/30/2016,The server was a sweet girl and very knowledgeable about the menu and beer but in general it just took a while. We won't come back unless we are not in a rush.  My husband got the Parmesan crusted chicken and loved it. Said he will definitely be back for it. I got Ceasars salad and broccoli and cheese soup both were just what I expected. It is a neat atmosphere and a huge variety of beers. We will likely be back again. We signed up for the loyalty program and got a free pizookie dessert.
Chelsea M.,"Lacombe, LA",37,146,186,5.0,7/18/2016,"My family and I love BJ's Brewhouse. Great selection of beer and the pizza is some of the best around (deep dish style). I also like the avocado rolls, ahi poke tuna, and calamari appetizers. If you want pizza but not deep dish, the grilled flatbread pizzas are delicious. As far as service, I've never been disappointed - our servers are always kind and attentive."
Kevin F.,"Biloxi, MS",63,3,3,3.0,8/5/2017,"Great service with a decent ambiance, but food is average at best for the price. We appreciated the reserved parking for wounded vets as well. Would probably give it one more shot and try different menu items."
Krystine S.,"Slidell, LA",133,227,238,2.0,4/12/2015,"This is my first try of the place ever. I've never ate at a BJs before. But I heard all the raves and was really hyped to try it.   They take reservations, and being new we called ahead! Got seated at the table and waited (no exaggeration here) 12 minutes for a server to even come get our drink order. When asking what alcoholic drink she suggests she is very short and leaves after suggesting two and goes to another table. Disappointing.  Ordered bar drinks & appetizers. (The pizza dip) worst appetizer I ever had. Tasted like the cheese was old. So we switched to cheese sticks, but mind you after ordering appetizers we waited 25 minutes and ordered our food. We did not, I repeat, DID NOT even get our appetizer until after we were done with our food.  So not only did it take forever to get drinks, and our server was super short with us, and our appetizer didn't come out until after our main courses, my pizza was cold because when bringing our meal the lady didn't have a pizza stand to put it on so she stood by the table with the pizza for literally 5 minutes until she could find our waitress and wave her down to signal her for a pizza stand.  It was not a very good experience. I won't be back until they work out the kinks with their kitchen and staff. I'll try it again in 6 months and re-review."
David R.,"Baton Rouge, LA",5,12,3,1.0,4/14/2017,"Seriously the service is awful! Went with my parents and my daughter. My pops ordered a burger, it came 15 minutes after the rest of the tables food. Ugh"
Nicholas G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",59,2,,5.0,6/27/2017,"So, I eat out at lot at nice restaurants in New Orleans pretty regularly. I rarely feel compelled to write yelp reviews, but this was by far the best club sandwich I have had in my life. It was superb. I go here every other week or so after I go rock climbing. It has a big menu, and can be overwhelming. We have never really had anything bad, most dishes are above average, especially the burgers. Then one night, I ordered the club sandwich and everything changed and now I'm writing a yelp review. So my advice? Don't get distracted. Get the club sandwich. Then, if you are not satisfied, go ahead and get the brisket bacon burger. Its got brisket AND bacon. It's great, but it's not ""get in your car and write a yelp review"" great."
Debbie F.,"Houston, TX",1,25,,4.0,4/8/2017,"It's the same as all the others, but service was good and quick and there was half price wine on Tuesday night."
Holli T.,"New Orleans, LA",106,62,26,1.0,12/13/2016,"If you get here after 11:00pm, all of the servers run for the hills! We felt so uncomfortable that we just decided to order to go. We had maybe 2.3 seconds to order, it was so rushed I decided I didn't want to give this restaurant any of my money but of course men will be men so my partner ordered! When they realized the coast was clear and we weren't going to sit in they magically came back out like poof and socialized and goofed around! Cute right?! If my fiancé didn't want to try their pizza I totally would have walked out. Do NOT go here for the food especially if you are a foodie and definitely not for the service, gosh!"
Rana F.,"New Orleans, LA",107,85,315,3.0,11/23/2015,"I stopped here on my way home. The SantaFe egg rolls were ok. The burger was tasty but the bun was stodgy. I had some wine during my late lunch. All in all I'm just not swayed with this place. It's the stereotypical, chain restaurant fair. Honestly, if you stop here than you might as well stop at all the numerous fast food places that abound in this area. Nothing substantial sticks out at the place."
Jessica G.,"Baytown, TX",12,27,8,5.0,1/1/2017,"Great place to eat in Slidell! Im currently in town for work and have found myself eating at this location often. I Highly recommend the Root beer wings, stuffed mushrooms, fried artichokes, they are all amazing. I Haven't tried anything I don't like, and the beers are great as well."
Pam W.,"McNeill, MS",0,1,,1.0,8/28/2017,"This was 1st time going, went for lunch, front doors were locked clearly people were in restaurant..finally got unlocked, escorted to booth where we waited for 30 min for a waitress, place was NOT busy..we left..shame we looked forward to eating there..never again!"
Senedra N.,"New Orleans, LA",35,41,26,1.0,7/17/2016,"The worst restaurant experience I've had in years. We ordered two appetizers: calamari and spinach dip, both were equally disgusting, however, they completely over cooked the calamari(fried in old grease) they attempt to remake this dish twice until we finally said forget it.  We ordered four entrees: the pasta sauce taste like it was straight out of the can. The burger was far too greasy and tacos were pasty. The Buffalo wings were the only dish we werent upset with. The waitress was very nice- at this point I just wanted to leave, I would've paid for everything, just let me go so I can go find  something to eat!! She noticed no one touch their food so she's took it all off the bill. She said the manager wanted to come speak with us but they never showed up. Stay away from this place!"
Christine L.,"Picayune, MS",22,44,1,1.0,11/3/2016,Served lasagna without meat. When I asked where the meat was they said they were out. They brought me out pepperoni to put in it. When I asked why they didn't tell me when I ordered it they said they didn't know. Didn't offer me a discount and a manager never came by to apologize.
Scott S.,"Dana Point, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/15/2017,Average food isn't enough to make up for horrific service.  Dirty and Expensive too.  Bad experience.  Could be really great.
Christine C.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",20,7,25,2.0,3/21/2016,"The servers here were very polite, I'll give them that. Even so, I can't retract the fact that two of our orders were mixed up and then forgotten about. We seemed to be nice about it though, didn't ask for anything extra to compensate for it. Waiting for our food took quite a bit, mainly because the restaurant seemed busy at this time-so I guess that's reasonable. It was, although, a bit strange to see our entrees come out before our appetizers.  Overall, the main reason I'm giving this restaurant only two stars is because of one thing-satisfaction when it comes to food. With almost everyone on our table not being able to finish our food... it was just too bland-literally everything we had ordered there. Even the ahi poke dish was a disappointment with it's portion size. The pizzas, both that we ordered-tasted like it had no tomato/marinara sauce underneath the cheesy texture. The pasta was downright bland and had no flavor, possibly needed more seasoning. The clam chowder in the bread bowl? Nope. When it came out the bread seemed cold and every part of it was soggy. If it had just came out of the oven to be set out to eat, it's reasonable to say at least some parts of the bread would not come out soggy... it literally tasted like the entire bread bowl was soaked in water for an hour.  As much as my family from Texas enjoy BJ's, living in New Orlean's-this restaurant did not give us the satisfactory justice our city is known for... Seasoning and flavor."
Jimmy T.,"New Orleans, LA",566,92,163,4.0,3/22/2015,"BJ's isn't too bad, coming here, my first impression was that I'd receive a menu filled with steaks and rib-eyes, but that's definitely not the case. I went for the Mediterranean wrap, which wasn't too bad. It wasn't really a large portion of food, but it was something that could fill you up for a few hours at the most. The server was really attentive in making sure that our drinks were constantly filled, and the highlight of the evening had to be the famous pizookie. If you're coming here with a large number of people, your best bet is to get the pizookie trio that way there's more choices in what flavors you get to try. Being on break from college for a bit, a majority of our friends decided to catch up, and this is the place we went.  The trio came out to around $9.95, and sharing it wasn't too big of a problem. Overall, BJ's was a good experience, and is a nice place if you just want to treat yourself every once in a while with some friends."
Johnnie G.,"Pearl River, LA",1,5,1,3.0,1/1/2017,"Have been there several times.  I enjoy the food, when it is correct, which isn't as often as it should be.  Appetizers are supposed to quick so that you can start eating right away, but on most occasions the appetitizers took 20 minutes or more and on more than once the appetitizer came after the meal.  If it takes that long to prepare an appetitizer they should reduce the available selection and get it right. The last couple of times at lest one in our party didn't get what they ordered.  They are apologetic and make restitution, but it has happened too frequently. We will likely go again, but I were giving recommendations to a visitor to town, I  would likely recommend somewhere else."
Erin R.,"Camarillo, CA",0,6,,2.0,6/21/2017,"This was our first visit to BJ's.  The food was good, however...the service was TERRIBLE.  The waitress was extremely rude, bordering on hostile.  We received a few eye rolls when we asked for anything.  Never got a drink refill or offer for one.  When we asked her about dessert, she seemed irritated, picked up our plates and slammed them on the table next to us while I was in MID-SENTENCE.  The restaurant was not busy, and we didn't show up anywhere near closing time.  I will not let this deter me from trying BJ's again.  I will, however, be sure to skip the Slidell location."
Scott L.,"Arvada, CO",0,2,,1.0,3/23/2017,Decent chain food. Horrible service. If you aren't drinking don't bother coming in - it's almost as though you don't exist. Saw my server for the first time 15 minutes after being seated. Received one glass of water (no return visit during entire meal). Then runner brought my meal and after finishing waited another 10 minutes for the check.
