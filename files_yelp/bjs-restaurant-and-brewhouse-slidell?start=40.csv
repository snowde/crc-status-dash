Chris D.,"Atlanta, GA",64,29,,5.0,10/2/2016,"Had never heard of this place, but on a quick trip to LA came across this. I usually read the Yelp reviews, and they were pretty spot on. We ordered the avocado egg rolls, those were amazing! They weren't too greasy or soft, but just right. I had the ahi Tuna salad, the salad overall was good, though I would have preferred to have more tuna than the few thin slices I got. My friends enjoyed their meals as well. Good quality and good servíce have earned my business for sure!"
Danny T.,"Slidell, LA",7,62,108,4.0,2/15/2015,"Have been here a few times and each visit has been a pretty positive one. The atmosphere is laid back and very very open. It can be a bit loud but that's expected. And I like their music selection.  The menu is huge. Something like 16 pages. On one side, it can be a bit overwhelming but on the other, it just means you have more options. The service is great. The servers are obviously trained to say ""my pleasure"" as opposed to ""you're welcome"" or ""no problem"" & it can come off as forced but that's only a small thing. They're knowledgeable & attentive; BJs seems to do a very good job training their employees.  The food has been good every time. Good not great. The burgers are pretty big, the pizza is always tasty, the pastas are okay, and the Pizookies are delicious! Overall, good place to meet up with friends or bring your family. Would recommend."
Ashley R.,"Slidell, LA",18,10,5,4.0,2/22/2015,"New restaurant. Only been open for almost a month and it's pretty good. It's been busy since it's opened. So why not try it out. I've heard nothing but good things.  We got here around 1pm and there was about a 25 mins wait. Neat how they have it set up to text you when your tables ready. We got seated and our waitress made it known that she was running behind so we kind of expected things to be a little slow. The menu is huge! Tons of variety... It was about a 10 min wait before we got our drinks and another 40 mins or so before we got an appetizer. The crispy fried artichokes are really good. I could eat them all day. My boyfriend ordered the chicken wings and he said they were just ok but agreed the artichokes were really good.  15 mins later we got our entrees. I ordered the extreme pepperoni deep dish pizza. He ordered the ribeye and we also got a chicken tender kids meal for our daughter. Everything was good. Really no complaints at all as far as the taste of the food goes.  I think Bc it's such a new restaurant for the area, the fact that it's so busy probably affects the speed of everything leaving the kitchen, but then it could have just been our waitress.  All in all, I'd definitely eat here again."
Robin F.,"Slidell, LA",31,10,,5.0,8/10/2016,"THERE IS A POKESTOP INSIDE!  They also have free wi-fi.  Go there for lunch, set up a lure, and enjoy.  For the pokestop, it's best to sit on the left side of the building. My only complaint is that we have to order bottled water because their ice water tastes a little weird. That's not a big deal, though.  Great service.  Our servers have been super amused by how often we've stopped there since Pokemon GO came out.  Great for groups, too!  Not a lot of huge tables, but lots of space if you don't mind being a little split-up.  Please try the pizzas at least once!"
Kentrell J.,"Slidell, LA",0,4,,3.0,4/21/2017,Great atmosphere and Great food! Received only three stars because I get overwhelmed my the choices on the menu.
Teedy H.,"Slidell, LA",0,14,,4.0,4/17/2017,Have not had a bad experience the few times I've been in--the food is great and beer night is super cool--I always have a great coupon to use which is always a plus!
Marc A.,"East Alton, IL",0,1,,4.0,3/10/2017,My first time here I was with a group of 15 people. The server did everything she could to keep up with us and get our food to us. It took a little long to get our food but that is to be expected with the size of the group. Our drinks were always full and the food was awesome. Lastly you have to try the cookie. It was AWESOME!!
Dean R.,"Slidell, LA",0,39,10,2.0,7/11/2016,"Typical crowded fast food restaurant with kid's waiting on tables. Can't ask any questions, they have go ask a manager to give you an answer. Never any problems with food. The menu is extensive and very confusing."
John R.,"Black Pearl, New Orleans, LA",3,24,6,4.0,11/25/2015,"BJ's looks so slick! I'm assuming that this restaurant has recently been opened because everything looks so new and clean. It is also home to the coolest looking bar I've ever seen. The TVs are all great for watching sports games (for me it was watching LSU get crushed by Ole Miss).  The beer selection is extensive. It also appears that the selection will rotate which means you'll never get tired of the same old same old. I had a standard bacon cheeseburger. It was about as good as any sports bar cheeseburger I've had--not great, not bad. It would've been better with a little less char, some bites tasted very burned.  If you're in the mood for dessert, for the love of god get a pizookie. They're magical.  Overall: Experience - 5/5 Burger - 3/5 Pizookie - heaven/5"
Gigi H.,"New Orleans, LA",29,18,5,3.0,8/7/2016,"We love BJ's!! Just hasn't been consistent last few visits, may be a new chef. Ordered the chicken club with the grilled Brussel sprouts and they were extremely overlooked and dried out. My wife had the chargrilled mahi mahi tacos and they were soaked in the chipotle mayo and the cabbage was unlikeable, turned her off severely. Service was great as usual, as well as my watermelon, feta salad but the food inconsistencies will deter me from going back for sure."
Carlotta D.,"Metairie, LA",47,19,2,4.0,9/7/2015,"It's really interesting to read the mixed reviews. Our dining experience was great.  The wait staff was super friendly, the restaurant was very clean, and the food was very good.   There was definitely a manager on staff. He was conspicuous, prominent, and engaged.  We were very pleased with the service. Our waitress was fun, interactive, and well-informed about our expansive menu choices.  The food had a lot of flavor, even the mozzarella cheese sticks were very tasty.    The only drawback was that the hostess attempted to place us (two adults) next to a table filled with children.   When will restaurant hostesses ever figure this out?  Adults with no children do not want to sit next to other adults with children.  We opted for the bar, but in Louisiana, there's no guarantee you won't find children in a bar.   Although there are mixed reviews, 50-50 favorable and unfavorable, I think our experience goes to show that when there is a manager engaged in the daily activity, you will see substantially better service and a better quality of the final food product.  I would recommend this place and suggest that you go and check it out  before letting a few bad experiences stop you from enjoying what might be a nice treat. Ask for Nicole.   And,unless you already know what you want, don't go rushed.  The menu is quite large; it took us ten minutes to comb through everything.  P.S.  Lots of vegetarian choices too!  Enjoy!"
Dee L.,"Slidell, LA",0,20,16,1.0,5/14/2016,Waste of time. Food was too salty and overpriced for quality. One meal here was enough for me not to return. Nice staff though.
Judy L.,"Slidell, LA",9,17,22,4.0,11/1/2015,One of the few places in Slidell that consistently stays open late. The food is average but the environment is very nice. The space is open and a variety of seating that can accommodate very large parties.  The servers are trained to say 'my pleasure' instead of 'no problem' or 'you're welcome' which is charming but sometimes too force and lacking meaning. The service does make mistakes at times but apologize and redeem themselves. (ex undercooked/ overlooked meats and incorrect sides) There are many drink options if you're interested and a happy hour 3-6 pm.
Buz B.,"Slidell, LA",17,128,22,2.0,8/3/2015,"This is a ""brewhouse"" that serves mediocre food. That's about it, really. I was excited when this place opened up, but was quite disappointed to discover that they do not brew their beer in the store, it is shipped from California or wherever. There's just something cool about a REAL brewhouse. This isn't really a brewhouse. It's a brewhouse's restaurant 1300 miles from the actual brewery. The house beers are alright, though. I like their heffewiezen. They also have a pretty good selection of the usual. I can get regular domestic or imported tap elsewhere though, so when I come here I get their house beers. I don't like the actual restaurant itself. It is entirely OPEN. No little nooks or crannies for you to lean back against and chill out in private. The store is all open and lots of completely empty space. It lacks ambiance. It lacks style and comfort. Maybe people out west like that. A bunch of non-offensive nothingness. The openness of the building is very uninviting to people who like to sit down to a nice cozy meal and a brew. Their menu LOOKS very appealing, but I've only ever had the fish and chips here because it is rather expensive. Out of the 3 times I've had their fish and chips, I was rather disappointed every time. The first time, the fish was just right, good portions and all that, but I was very turned off about those thin boring fries. Man.... screw those fries. You'd have to grab half a dozen of those dumb fries just to get a taste of potato. I was so turned off that I even left a complaint on their website. They called back and I spoke to a manager who said he was sorry that I didn't like their skinny fries, but they ""tested well"" across the country and he hoped I can get used to them. No. I won't get used to your skinny crap fries. They suck. Serve REAL fries. The other two times I got the fish and chips, the fish came out overcooked and barely any flavor. I probably won't go back there again for that. I might try something else like their cajun lasagna, though. That looked good. Their peperonni flatbread, however, is very on point, and leads me to believe that their pizza might be rockin. Speaking of rockin, you'll be rockin and rolling and slipping and sliding on those floors when you try to walk anywhere. They keep those floors so slick, it's almost as though they don't want anyone walking anywhere but to their table when they arrive and back out the door when they leave. WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THOSE FLOORS?!? I wear two types of footwear, sandals and boots, and I SHIT YOU NOT, I COULD SLIDE ALL THE WAY TO THE BATHROOM. I swear to you, that I have done that, just to prove a point. You could have your friend literally PULL you without lifting your feet if you wanted. I don't think I'll go here very much in the future. Like I said, there is NO ambiance to this place. It's all very open and impersonal. The food I and others have had was mediocre at best. This place gets 2 stars instead of 1 ONLY because they serve their house beers that I can't get anywhere else and they're pretty good and to be honest, the service here is above average; at the bar and on the floor."
Paul W.,"Memphis, TN",52,292,21,4.0,10/20/2015,"Good food and good service.  Tasted my friend's fried artichokes -- they were simply OK.  My fish and chips entree was excellent, although the fries were lukewarm.  Nice atmosphere.  Will be back."
Kim V.,"Slidell, LA",0,10,,1.0,8/7/2016,"Was in the start of Lunch , when we wanted to take my in-laws , ordered lunch and was the worse , Pizza app was very gross and service was very slow !! It was not busy .Now me and my husband did go when they 1st opened , was very good when trainers were there to watch management , but seems after the trainers left , the operations went south along with the service Quality !!( the deep dish pizza was good  when we went the 1st time will order that again , maybe to go )"
A. J.,"Houston, TX",0,16,6,5.0,1/26/2017,"Good food, good atmosphere. Ask for Donald L. for your waiter and you will get outstanding service!"
James C.,"Halifax, Canada",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2016,"Worst Service Ever - So tonight my wife and I stopped in for dinner. The host promptly greeted us and sat us stating ""our server Nicole will be taken care of us"". We sat waiting for over 10 minutes with no end in site. After waving down the host, she expressed our server will be right over. Then to our surprise, our server walked passed us without even a node and served co-workers sitting to eat. Then proceeded to our table and asked how was our night. Needless to say, we promptly left and shall never return."
Dena M.,"Metairie, LA",26,13,43,3.0,10/10/2015,"Ordered the mahi mahi taco, grilled.  Fish was dry n at certain places, hard to chew. The service however was great..Bri, was wonderful.. attentive, pleasant and patient."
Jessica M.,"Slidell, LA",123,97,61,2.0,3/13/2015,The only reason they're getting two stars is the good memories I have of the San Diego locations. This one was deplorable. We were seated and then had a 45 minute wait at the table with only water.. drinks and apps were not brought out -until we reminded them multiple times- though we ordered within 5 minutes of being seated. The managers did not even care to comp us a pizookie. I think the establishment is only going to survive on the reputation of the other locations cause one visit to this place and walking out seems logical. I'd say give them a year to work out the kinks and get rid of the weak links from management to the cooks who don't understand how to get a hot soup out of the kitchen.
