Dan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",187,10,7,5.0,5/10/2015,"On Friday May 8th we were passing through on our way to the Pearl River Eco Tour and were a little early and wanted to get something to eat. We walked up around 10:30 am and a guy outside asked if he could help us. We said we wanted to get something to eat when he informed us they did not open until 11 AM.  We told him we only had an hour before our swamp tour began. He said he was the manager and we could come in early and he would have the kitchen make us something.  Al  the staff went out if their way to get us something to eat and back on the road on time.  I grew up living in Covington, LA my first eight years and have not been back for over twenty years. I had forgotten how nice and helpful the people are down south. The food was great and the service over the top. Thanks"
Kristen G.,"Pearl River, LA",102,3,3,3.0,2/8/2016,"My husband and I ordered take out from the BJ's Brewhouse app. When we arrived to pick it up, we stood there for close to 15 minutes without being acknowledged on a slow night. One waitress literally stood there and chewed her nails right near us while we stared her down waiting to see if she would help us. She didn't. Turned around and went and hung out in the kitchen. Finally, a staff member walked by and asked if we were being helped yet. I replied no. Then she went to the kitchen to apparently tell the host that we were there to pick up food. She came out the kitchen looking stoned and talking a bit of jibberish I couldn't make out! The service just from ordering take out was horrible. Food was pretty good though."
Coty G.,"New Orleans, LA",25,25,52,5.0,2/14/2015,Came in after a quick shopping trip. Had the pleasure of being waited on by Juliette. She was amazing and very attentive. Ordered the wings for an appetizer and they were cooked to perfection. Had the mini pepperoni extreme pizza and a strawberry splash. Everything was prepared fresh and the wait wasn't long at all. This place just opened up Monday (2/9) and I will definitely be back. Be prepared for dozens of choices when you are looking at the 16 page menu. Also had the white chocolate macadamia pizookie for dessert - heavenly!!!
Brittany F.,"Mandeville, LA",3,25,32,5.0,2/7/2016,"BJs is one of my favorite restaurants, my husband and I were so excited when they built this location, we come here almost every weekend and are apart of their rewards program. Service is always awesome, food is ALWAYS delicious. Love their best beginnings appetizer!"
Rob T.,"Kiln, MS",0,79,36,3.0,3/31/2015,Good food.  Great home made cream soda and root-beer.  The pizza was great. The burger a little dry.  SERVICE WAS SLOW SERVICE WAS REALLY SLOW.  the prices were a little high.
Stephanie S.,"Mandeville, LA",0,7,,5.0,6/12/2015,"Avocado egg rolls are AMAZING. I will order them every time I come. I also forgot my leftovers, when I called 5min later, they had already thrown them out, however they made me a fresh order at NO CHARGE. Great management team"
Whitney B.,"Mandeville, LA",1,19,57,4.0,2/28/2015,"Good food, good service. Very busy. I'll wait to go back when the hype dies down so I don't have to wait 40 min for a table. Beer was good, Sangria was amazing!"
Lakeisha W.,"New Orleans, LA",54,21,30,4.0,9/4/2015,"Great food,  menu,  and atmosphere. Despite our party being very large,  the food was prompt and delicious. This was my first time at BJ's. I had the salmon over couscous and it has become a craving! I will be returning very soon!"
Jason And Joy C.,"Carriere, MS",1,19,12,4.0,2/14/2015,"Good food, good atmosphere they just opened so they are still in need of getting all the bugs out. I hope the food gets slightly better and so does the beer."
Ashley M.,"New Orleans, LA",19,31,3,3.0,12/15/2015,Food is great! Service is piss poor. Don't even bother going at any regular busy time. The managers don't staff it well enough to handle busy nights. Emily is particularly awful and ill experienced.
Steven F.,"Slidell, LA",42,62,203,4.0,11/11/2015,"There's a few not so good post for this restaurant. The only thing I can say is, you need to try this restaurant and formulate your own experience. There's way too many good choices on the food menu and beer menu to not give them a try. This was my 2nd visit and 1st official visit. The first time I came here was an introduction night to get the waiters and waitresses some hands on training. The initial visit was great, I wrote about it but it was before the business was on yelp, so I'm not sure what happened to my review. This visit was equally great except I had access to their full menu which made me excited. This visit we came to the establishment on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The location was hopping but not too busy. I came with my wife and 3 yr old. We ordered 2 appetizers, the calamari was delicious and the spring rolls was equally delicious. I apologize for this being the end of this review. I forgot to finish this review and was reminded of it on my next visit. Unfortunately the time difference between these visit had caused me to forget the details of my visit but I do know the visit was flawless."
JJ M.,"Newport News, VA",8,10,12,5.0,12/5/2015,All the food was yummy. All 5 of us got something different and we all enjoyed our lunch. The french fries are shoe string and are very tasty. I got a side of them with my Santa fe salad. Yum yum yum
Robert V.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",37,65,28,1.0,6/13/2015,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! I'm guessing this place is new and haven't yet had their grand opening, because they have some major problems. I travel quite a bit and have been to many BJs locations across the country, never has my service been this bad. When we arrived we were told we would be seated right-away, they just had to clean a table meanwhile 15 min later we realize that there was a hostess shift change and they failed to communicate the table was for us gave it to another party that arrived after us. So 30 min. later we got a table. Then it continues with the deaf waitress (I'm only assuming because we had to repeat our order twice) seemed very unfamiliar with the menu and confused by our requests (no substitutions requested BTW). Then the kitchen is running behind and it took them another 40 min to get our food. When the food came my ""well-done"" burger came it"" medium"". Finally as we are preparing to leave they can't run my credit card because the idiot manager decided to update the computers in the middle of dinner shift. I had to sit and wait an additional 20 min. they didn't offer me anything for my inconvenience, the manager never came by to check on me, nor was he available when I asked to speak with him. Fortunately I do not live in Slidell, so I never have to endure this experience again, but I feel bad for their residents. #worstmealever #epicfail #bjsrestaurant"
Brandi S.,"New Orleans, LA",193,24,31,4.0,7/10/2015,Great pizza. The dough is light and fluffy.  Love it!  Also the double berry cider was delicious
Jesse V.,"Gulfport, MS",0,91,13,4.0,12/17/2015,Cool hangout. Good food. Good beer selection. Decent service. Had a Zita pasta with cheese and Italian sausage. It was good. The best part of our dinner was the Stone IPA though.
Stan L.,"Slidell, LA",0,13,2,4.0,2/16/2015,"Good micro-brewery. Lots of choices for brews. The sampler gave 4 choices and was only $8. Several IPA choices (that seems to be the trendy beer choice now) My wife had the berry burst cider, she raved about it but too sweet for my tastes.  Good variety of foods. I will definitely be returning back."
Skeeter B.,"Lafayette, LA",0,6,,4.0,1/24/2016,Had a great time dinner with my family celebrating my Dad's birthday. Server Nicole was fantastic made sure the evening was perfect for my Dad.
Alex A.,"New Lenox, IL",8,7,1,1.0,7/5/2015,"They don't even brew beer on site and you call yourself a brewhouse?  Their house beers have to be some of the worst beers I've ever had.  The IPA tasted like minerals and sulfur and I drink IPAs all the time.  The Porter has hella crystal malt and tasted horrible.  The stout, undrinkable.  The Kolsch was actually decent.  The bar tender knew nothing about beer and claimed to be a ""Bud Light"" girl.  No one in this establishment knew anything about beer, it's a joke."
Erica B.,"Slidell, LA",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2016,"Worst service possible. Went a few months ago around 9pm (while they close at midnight most nights), waited at the door about 10 minutes to be sat. No one came and helped. Four employees looked my direction, but did not acknowledge us, so we left. Decided to give it a try tonight for take out. Placed my order, went to the counter to pick up and no one helped. Again, employees looked my direction without asking if I needed to be helped and got to the point of not even being hungry anymore so said f it and left. Called to let the manager know what happened and his response was ""ok I'm sorry about that, that's all I can say"" and hung up. If I could give them -5 stars I would."
Mary Catherine S.,"Slidell, LA",0,3,,1.0,6/20/2016,"This place is AWFUL. Didn't have silverware for a while after appetizers were served as server was MIA. We had to get up and go ask for refills multiple times, my ""boneless wings"" were room temperature McDonald's nuggets covered in sauce, broccoli and cheese soup was cold and waiter told us ""she'd go in the back and nuke it for us."" Such an awful experience- never coming back."
