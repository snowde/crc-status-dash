Ashton B.,"Round Rock, TX",29,41,20,5.0,6/23/2015,One of the best places to eat in Slidell! Love this place and the staff is great. The cocktails are great and they have a huge beer selection.
Elizabeth B.,"Logan, WV",1,8,16,2.0,7/15/2015,"The boys were excited to go here (as they are with any place that makes their own root beer); they have this place in Clearwater and Pinellas Park, Florida, so I was familiar with it. Saw three open booths and hoped we would get one, but was told they were reserved and for parties larger than our three and a child. I call BS to that because there was a couple with a small child in one of the booths, but I bit my tongue. So no booth. At least we were seated at a larger table I suppose. Our server..I'm not sure if she had never served before or if she was just on the flaky side..but I had to just laugh to myself or I was just going to get upset. We had to ask her to bring us silverware and then she only brought one set. We had to ask for drink refills...also (which I know is not the server's fault) they were out of frosted mugs for the root beer, and the cups that were used were hot which put a damper on the boys excitement. The timing of the food wasn't very good either..we got some sort of large sampler platter and we had barely started eating it and our entrees arrived. So my burger and fries were cold by the time I got to them. I had the watermelon and feta salad and it was fantastic. Nice and light and the mint was a lovely balance. I would definitely get that again. Maybe the black and blue burger would have been better if I had eaten it when it was fresh? When I got to it, the thing was a grease ball and not so good. My 4 year old enjoyed the cheese sticks from the sampler..I was told the pizza was good. I was less than impressed with the whole experience, and I know the meal wasn't cheap. I'm sure they will want to go back, but I'm hesitant to give it another try. I must say the one in Florida was better."
Jose P.,"Long Beach, MS",4,24,6,5.0,9/6/2015,Loved the Ahi salad and the beers are the bomb.  Had a couple of ales and they were really good.
Yolanda M.,"Slidell, LA",0,7,2,3.0,4/13/2016,Went to dinner as a party of 10. Ordered the mini vegetarian pizza and added a side salad. The salad was very fresh and tasty. All of our dinners came out except one. And that person had to wait several minutes to be served. The pizza was really good. Vegetables were fresh and plentiful.  The atmosphere is very casual. The one major issue came at the end when two guest received their receipts to sign and realized their credit cards were switched.  Overall we had a nice evening.
Hank E.,"Okaloosa Island, FL",0,3,,3.0,2/5/2016,"The food is very good been here twice now. That said, the service is very haphazard. I was in the bar and different servers would work my table. Not very organized service."
Kelsey B.,"New Orleans, LA",2,2,1,4.0,2/22/2015,"Great food, great service, and the menu is so broad. As for the other reviews, you're being too harsh..the place just opened up. Give it some time and I'm sure it will get even better."
Janna H.,"New Orleans, LA",3,12,1,5.0,3/15/2015,I have eaten twice there and once as take out. Every time the food was awesome and the service is excellent!
Jennifer S.,"Covington, LA",1,8,7,5.0,3/12/2015,"Color me impressed, delicious food, great service, and tasty beer! Try the baked beignets, they were the perfect ending to a fantastic meal!"
Don H.,"Slidell, LA",0,8,,1.0,2/22/2015,My son-in-law and I both ordered deep dish lasagna.  It was supposed to have Italian sausage and pepperoni.  It did not.  When I pointed this out to the waitress she said she could bring out a side of the meats.  She returned with a meatball and some pepperoni.  She explained the kitchen was out of Italian sausage.  The kitchen sent out our meals knowing they were wrong.  I did not ask to speak to the manager.  I explained our disappointment with the kitchen knowingly sending out wrong food to our server.  I guess I wanted her to do the right thing and get the manager without my asking.  She did not.  The restaurant failed on all levels to do the right thing.  There are too many options in Slidell to go to a restaurant that has this attitude.
Kirk K.,"Covington, LA",0,15,2,5.0,2/13/2015,"Excellent service and food. We had the chipotle salmon and fish and chips, killer. Get the French fries, cheese and carnitas appetizer, great as well. First time here, house Beers are great and only $3.50 at lunch. We'll be back real soon. To bad Covington doesn't have one.  Keep it up."
Drew L.,"Covington, LA",73,17,6,1.0,2/15/2016,"Terrible service. Terrible food. Terrible valentines day dinner. Attention potential customers of BJS beware.. Tried to take my girlfriend somewhere nice for valentines day dinner got crap service from a kid who hated their life an their job. wasnt greeted at table until 20 minutes after seating and the restaurant WAS NOT even busy at all ,i ordered a jalapeño  burger and got our food finally after about an hour an i asked for pink in the middle of my burger they bring me a burger fully blackened an burnt to a crisp. I sent it back and 25 min later after my girlfriend has finished eating i get another burger, cold, and still burnt and not the slghtest bit of pink in the middle. At this point im so hungry i decide to just eat the horrible food i was served. I talked to a manager and she only gave me %10 off the burger an didnt even offer to fix it! So i still basically had to pay for a shitty cold burnt burger that i didnt even want! Never going back to BJs! Obviously they dont teach their employees to care about the customers or the corporation doesnt pay them enough cuz every single in employee in BJS couldnt give less of a shit."
Kristy P.,"San Diego, CA",118,6,2,4.0,3/9/2015,"Brand new restaurant. There were tons of items on the menu. I ordered a Kale & Brussel Sprouts Salad. This salad includes blueberries, grapes, pepitas, cranberries, goat cheese crumbles, onions, cucumber and candied pecans. I ordered the salad with grilled shrimp on top, no pecans or cucumber, with balsamic vinaigrette. When the salad came out, it was missing pepitas, cranberries, goat cheese, onions AND the grilled shrimp. Plus, a different dressing was poured on top. Not to mention, my son's potatoes weren't sent out and our silverware was dirty. This was all very frustrating and I could tell I was about to get bitchy. HOWEVER, our server (Aaron C.), was a complete professional. He was personable and kind and actually took time to squat down next to the table to be eye to eye. He explained that the person making salads was brand new and didn't have the information needed to include the exact ingredients.  He ran around and retrieved everything that was missing. Once I had all the ingredients to my salad, it was BY FAR the BEST salad I've ever had. I will most definitely be back. Hopefully, the new restaurant kinks will be worked out soon. I'm just very very pleased with how the server diffused the situation. It's very rare."
Cb M.,"Abbotsford, Canada",0,6,,2.0,12/30/2015,Ok food is good. Place is loud. Service is really good if you are with someone who looks like a businessman and really poor otherwise.
David L.,"Astoria, OR",87,39,2,2.0,5/15/2015,"Giving it two stars because it's normally great. Our most recent visit was atrocious. We got in fine, sat down at our table and ordered our drinks. I asked the waitress if I could sample a couple of beers and she said that would be fine, and we ordered our pizza and salad. About ten minutes later she arrived with two half size glasses of the beer I wanted to SAMPLE, along with a water for my wife and I. After a few minutes of talking with my wife about the size of the samples (which I did not consume), I flagged down the waitress and asked her how much they were. She informed me that they were  $4.25 per sample! I've had free samples of the beer at this facility before, and they came in large shot glass size glasses. I then flagged her down again to tell her that I didn't want to pay for those because I just wanted to SAMPLE the beer. A good waitress would have recognized her error and offered them for free, but this waitress simply took them back and poured them out. Approximately 45 minutes after we ordered our food (we noticed the time due to the text that we received before to be seated), we received our salad, and 15 minutes after that, we finally received our pizza. After we finished our pizza, she came by and offered us our first refill of water. An hour later the waitress offered us our first refill... This may have been the most frustrating thing. We noticed other waiters and waitresses servicing their tables much better and faster. It was a very frustrating experience as we were both very hungry when we arrived, and it took them an hour to get our food and first refill of water. Hopefully things will be better next time we go."
David I.,"Slidell, LA",0,1,,5.0,10/16/2015,"When i sat at the bar was greeted by a very pleasant bar tender (donald). Donald was very knowledgeable on both beer and food. He suggested a salad that i would to say was probably the best salad i have had in a long time, as well as a very good entree. Donald like he really likes job, which is rare with customer service based jobs. He great attitude and knowledge really made this a great experience."
Rachel C.,"Slidell, LA",0,4,,5.0,6/13/2015,"Consistently great meals. Have tried several items on the menu and liked each one. Handcrafted root beer soda is really good - must try if you like root beer. The pizookies, an over-the-top cookie dessert with ice cream, are delicious."
Karen G.,"Picayune, MS",0,1,,1.0,2/20/2015,"Do not eat here. The food came out cold, the dessert order came out wrong, and there was a long wait. After letting the manager know, we still had to pay full price. No cut on the bill at all. We had a long wait, a cold meal and it is the last money they will get from me"
