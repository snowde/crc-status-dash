Jan F.,"Colleyville, TX",53,303,123,4.0,11/11/2017,"A large group squeezed into a very large corner booth, and I do mean squeeze.  While we able to get in, most of us, it was hard, and even harder to get out! Everyone seemed to enjoy their orders.  I liked my asian inspired peanut sauced chicken and noodle dish and would order it again without hesitation.  Some dishes were huge and could easily have served two. Wait staff was pleasant and hard working. One quibble is with the cost of a simple bourbon - $12.50....way over-priced.  We will go back but won't be ordering any bourbon!!"
Tracie P.,"San Rafael, CA",31,85,33,2.0,7/24/2017,"Oi, just like every other BJs I've been to.  The wait was long for our big party.  Then they couldn't get the food order right.  Someone in our party sent their pizza back twice and it was wrong the 3rd time...he didn't get to eat.   The wait staff is nice.  It wasn't her fault and she handled it the best she could.  I think we should have seen the manager at that point, but only the waitress handled it.   I was visiting family or I wouldn't have gone...based on my experience at other BJs.  I don't know why they can't get orders right?  Ticketing system?  I'm not sure, but that prevents me from going to BJs again (unless I'm with a group of people and they make me go there again) ;)"
Anj L.,"Irving, TX",321,392,472,4.0,7/4/2017,"We just visited this BJs for a second time. It is located in a fun and busy area of Southlake and is brand new. The restaurant is open, with high ceilings and the bar has many tv screens. We have dined only in the bar area, which is open seating. Both times, our waitresses have been patient and attentive. They know the menu well and helped us pick out a variety of their own beers that they make. Our friends have opted for the beer flights, to help them decide which kind of brewsky they would want to order for dinner. I also saw on the wall that they have flights for bourbon (can you say dangerous?!) We always start with the Ahi Poke- so delicious and healthy, with raw tuna, cabbage, onions and herbs. During our first visit, I ordered the Peruvian Quinoa bowl with salmon. If you are a quinoa lover, this dish will be right up your alley. It includes spinach, mushrooms, garlic and then the salmon was cooked perfectly. My husband always gets the same thing- the ahi salad. Huge portion with tasty toppings. During our last visit, I had the quinoa bowl with shrimp-just as good. Our friend ordered the xxx hot spicy wings. Now, this man is used to eating super spicy foods, so the spice wasn't much for him-the waitress brought out some sriracha sauce for him to use as a dipper! Nice restaurant, fun atmosphere and ample parking, right in the middle of tons of shopping. Hooray!"
Maggie T.,"Southlake, TX",0,19,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Large menu but i have never had anything here that really made me say ""that was great"". Good beer selection and lots of apps so may be a great place for happy hour. Not the best for dinner or lunch."
Kellie M.,"Dallas, TX",176,153,26,4.0,10/11/2017,"I've always been a fan of BJ's in general due to their wide variety of food, delicious deep dish pizzas, and of course the pizookies! But I really enjoyed trying them for lunch. They have some options to build your own lunch combo that are quite tasty, including the California chicken club. The Southlake location is large with plenty of seating, including some big booths for family style dining. They also weren't very busy during lunch during the week, so it's a great option to stop in on your break alone or for team lunches."
Suann G.,"The Woodlands, TX",75,235,558,5.0,1/11/2017,"No idea why it has taken me so long try out this place. They have an extensive beer selection on tap!  We sat in the bar area in a Thursday. Our waitress was the sweetest gal! Turns out wines are half price. Wahoo! They have a few good ones too! Their menu is pretty extensive - burgers, pastas, pizzas, salads, and much more! My husband and I split a burger and a flatbread. These were both great!  I most certainly will be back!"
Titus V.,"Bedford, TX",0,38,47,4.0,12/2/2017,"The restaurant was not busy at 4pm on Saturday.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  Charles was our waiter and he was excellent.  The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious.  My wife ordered the chicken Parmesan and I ordered the double bone in pork chop.  The pork chop had good dry rub on it but on the sweet side.... but still delicious.  I also met the manager who was professional and took care of the glitch in their system without any delay.  Will definitely be visiting this location again."
Suzanne P.,"Grapevine, TX",208,242,154,3.0,6/17/2017,"HH on Friday at 6. Not busy when we walked in, busy at about 7. HH 4-7. We tried the HH ribs - 4 for $6 - blah, spinach dip - $6 small bowl - meh, and the siriacha dip - large bowl $3 - good! Best bet is the siriacha cheese dip for $3. Easily shareable and you can't beat $3. Nice decor. Super chill and relaxed. Service was painfully SLOOOOOOW. Even mentioned how long it took to take our initial drink order and it didn't get better.  3 apps & 5 wines = aprox $45 incl tax & tip."
Vincent A.,"Grapevine, TX",22,11,2,3.0,11/13/2017,Came here for the deep dish pizza.  Almost entirely bread with a very thin layer of toppings.  I could see the bread through the toppings to give you an idea of how sparse the sauce and toppings were.  Also ordered Nashville hot chicken sandwich. So so.
Dustin U.,"Grapevine, TX",0,27,16,5.0,11/10/2017,"Cherry glazed salmon, poke ahi, Peruvian shrimp bowl and a couple of beers.  12.95 off my father and my meals each for Veterans Day John took care of us.  The food was absolutely delicious and the service was prompt, and attentive while allowing us the privacy to enjoy our meal.  Great discount for Veterans and amazing food."
Adam G.,"Dallas, TX",140,76,154,4.0,8/3/2016,"I hadn't visited a BJs in several years until I had a business lunch there recently, and was surprised at how good it was! Excellent, large selection of both healthy and less healthy options, with plenty of choices for kids too. I had the half California club flatbread with an upgrade to the watermelon salad to accompany it.  Salad was excellent while the flatbread, while good, didn't have enough toppings and left a little to be desired.  I returned a week later and got the unlimited soup and salad with chili - it was okay so will probably try something else next time. Looking forward to returning soon!"
iron J.,"Irving, TX",3,59,23,5.0,10/28/2017,Chris did a great job as our server. I was a waiter at chilies and I freaking hated that job but he made it look easy very accommodating as I have a vegan wife . Thanks again.
Krista S.,"San Diego, CA",2,92,3,5.0,12/5/2017,Love root beer on tap. Love pizza. Love the pizzokie. Service is great. Lots of parking. Not much more to ask for.
David V.,"Keller, TX",113,347,861,2.0,4/21/2016,"The service here varies everytime for us, I guess it depends on the time of day you go. When we've gone later in the night 10ish, service seems to be slow and non-attentive. When we've gone during normal hours, everything was perfect. This time we came later and waited awhile to be greeted.  We like the food here, we've liked everything we have ever ordered. However, like I said it depends on the day. On one occasion, we sent everything back to the kitchen because the food was cold. The ribs, baked ziti, Great white pizza, and the 5 meat are some of our favorites.  Their desserts are really good too. This time we ordered the Cookies and cream pazookie, delicious. Next time we'll ask for an extra scoop of ice cream to make it better:-)"
Courtney D.,"Grapevine, TX",0,6,,5.0,10/13/2017,Great wait staff and good food!  Thanks John for such great service!  Had to end the meal with the the awesome pizookie!
Aaron N.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",802,91,237,3.0,10/12/2016,"BJ's boasts a very large and diverse menu that rivals the Cheese Cake Factory. Everything from steak, BBQ, sandwiches, and burgers to wings, salads, sea food and pizza. They even have a few Asian entrees.  Set the expectation low as it relates to service and don't get your hopes up too high for the food.  BJ's is not a bad place to eat but not something I would strongly recommend to someone."
Lauren M.,"Euless, TX",0,28,39,4.0,7/14/2017,"A must try!  My hubby and I go here occasionally on date nights.  We both like beer- we always enjoy trying one of BJ's own brews! They are all really good in their style. Craft beer/drink choices: 5 Food: 5! Delicious. My hubby got a burger(his favorite food). Bj's had it Cooked perfectly. Tender. Juicy. Flavorful. The BBQ burg won't disappoint! I tried it and like it a lot!  I had the Peruvian quinoa bowl with shrimp. SO FLAVORFUL! I wasn't sure about it, by it blew me away. The spices weren't too much by enough that it was enjoyable and never got old. I found a new favorite.  Service: 3. Our host and waiters were a bit awkward. Nice... but awkward. This time and last. However our needs were tended to in a timely manner! So maybe I'm putting too low.  Overall, you MUST go. For girls' night, family night, or date night. Great place for all occasions."
Ryan N.,"Grapevine, TX",46,2,1,1.0,9/23/2017,"This had become mine & my wife's favorite casual restaurant and was becoming at least a bi-weekly visit if not more frequent.   Unfortunately the last 2 out of 3 visits have been disasters - despite our complaints we have yet to hear an ""I'm sorry"", only excuses as to why things went wrong.  Very disappointing.  When there's an attitude problem at the manager level, how can you expect anything different from the kitchen and servers? Love the beer variety but we'll be looking for another place to call home...Lazy Dog, maybe?"
Billie S.,"Fort Worth, TX",58,72,342,5.0,2/14/2016,"Favorite BJs! Better than the one in Hurst IMO. Our wait time was supposed to be approximately 20 minutes so my group headed to the bar. The bar tender was very helpful in helping us select our beers.  As soon as we got our beers, the hostess informed us our table was ready. The server was awesome! Unfortunately I cannot remember her name but she had dreadlocks and was 2 steps ahead of us at all times. As soon as we sat down she gave us all waters.  Husband and I ordered fried artichokes and pepperoni flatbread. The experience and service was great!  We will be going to this BJs from now on."
Shelley D.,"Southlake, TX",18,98,130,2.0,1/17/2017,"Had lunch with a girlfriend and was enticed by the free $10 gift card with the purchase of a $50 gift card. I never got the $10 but I was able to use the Buy One Entree and the second entree is free with a purchase of two drinks.  I arrived shortly after it opened at 11AM and since my friend hadn't arrived yet, I chose a booth at the bar. Not long after, my friend arrived and we looked over the extensive menu. It's dark in the bar area so it was hard to see. Neither my friend nor I come here often so we needed more time to peruse the menu. The server seemed annoyed by this. He was also not knowledgeable of the menu when I asked of the clam chowder was New England or Manhattan style. I settled for the unlimited soup and salad and started off with the Ahi Poke shareable which I had no intention of sharing since my companion didn't like seafood. The chowder was whitish but very salty and the salad was drenched in dressing. The starter was filling thankfully. Even with the promotion that BJ's offers, I doubt we will return with the poor service and mediocre food."
Holly W.,"Waxahachie, TX",26,138,159,4.0,7/11/2016,"We come to BJs a lot. Great menu and stellar beer selection! There are always seasonal beers as well as a full bar available. TVs dot the walls and the ambiance is upbeat and casual.  If you are dieting, get one of the lower calorie ""enlightened"" options. I like the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. The tzatziki sauce is rockin! Join the frequent diner club to earn points toward free desserts (pazookie--pizza +cookie=yum!) and other deals."
Holly W.,"Roanoke, TX",154,44,231,4.0,7/23/2016,"Food was great, service was extremely SLOW. I read several reviews and concluded we should be okay since it wasn't really late. Unfortunately, I was wrong! We still waited a long time for our drink refills and even longer to get our dessert. I would definitely suggest avoiding this place at night and coming in before dinner time. UPDATE:  I returned again (per the manager's invite) and had a pleasant experience. I came in around dinner time and had zero wait time. The food was wonderful and the service was even better. I must say that their commitment to customer service is impeccable!"
Michael B.,"Lexington, MA",2,131,3,2.0,6/3/2016,"Tried BJ's Brewhouse after a day of business meetings on a recent trip to Dallas/Westlake. Mixed reviews resulted in the 2 star rating.  First the beers; while a Brewhouse with a laundry list to sample, it seemed we picked all the wrong ones. Each tap seemed to lack the right level of carbonation. It's my opinion that you need to trim down the beer list so that you can serve the freshest product to your customers.  Second the food menu: it was similarly huge and almost overwhelming. The avocado appetizer was crunchy and full of flavor. The Sriracha Queso Dip with warm, salty chips were another hit. The burgers were big, juicy, and came with A plentiful portion of shoestring fries equally crispy and salty.  The New Orleans jambalaya was less than stellar lacking much flavor or uniqueness.  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was plentiful, but just too much sauce for my liking. The shoestring fries were the hit of the plate and maybe the best item on the entire menu that we ordered.  Lastly, the Pizookie dessert (cookie with ice cream) was good, but not much room left after sizable meals.  My suggestion is to keep it simple and order a burger with fries and wash it down with a popular beer which should be from a fresher keg."
Tina B.,"Southlake, TX",354,8,32,5.0,6/14/2017,"Great family restaurant and good customer service!  Order the Deep Dish Pizza, it's the best."
Peter M.,"Alexandria, VA",80,402,146,4.0,11/20/2016,"Good brews and fast food. Servers were polite and helpful, and the atmosphere was good for a light lunch."
David F.,"Lubbock, TX",256,397,365,5.0,6/7/2016,Bj's is really good! A great date place also good to grab food with friends.they have great burgers
Roylene B.,"Keller, TX",38,9,32,5.0,5/14/2017,"Great service for a holiday. Food was spot on, hot and delishous. Beers ice cold. Desert outstanding"
Ken E.,"Keller, TX",0,22,,5.0,2/8/2017,"This is one of my family's go to places for a family dinner because of the breath of the menu. If i am trying to act right the salmon is consistent and the sides good. If not, the burgers are also consistently good (my fav is the brisket burger). I also love the assortment of drinks. I am a soda dude so the creme is what i particularly enjoy. We have never had an issue with a server here either. My ladies love the bazoki... chocolate chip."
Sunyoung K.,"Southlake, TX",1,24,36,4.0,10/10/2016,Great local restaurant!! I like most of their food and especially I like their chicken wings!! That is sooo good!!
Kelly E.,"Grapevine, TX",0,13,1,5.0,4/23/2017,"Alec gives the best customer service! He always offers me an ice water while I wait for my takeout order to be ready. He's very polite and pleasant! It is so rare to get even decent customer service anywhere these days and it is such a pleasure to visit this BJs location. Thank you, Alec!"
Angela M.,"Keller, TX",157,90,133,3.0,7/7/2016,"I've been to this location a couple times and each time I go the service just gets worse and worse.  My first visit here was great! We came with a group of about 10 people and our waitress was awesome! I don't remember her name..she had dreads I think but she was attentive, fast and witty!  Came here a couple of weeks ago and we mustve gotten stuck with the worst waitress there. I'm not going to be mean and put her name on my review (even though I took a photo of her name on my receipt). Husband and I had a double date with another couple. There wasn't a line to wait for a seat and the place wasn't super busy. Our waitress was working a couple of other tables and a party table of about 15 people that were finishing up their meals. It took her about 15 minutes to even get our WATER orders..I understand she had a larger party to attend to but I was observant and 95% of the time she was no where to be found. She wasn't even giving the proper amount of attention to the group of 15 people! After another 20 minutes of waiting around for her, she finally came back to take our food orders. She disappeared again and other staff members brought us out our food, however my friend didn't get her food yet. 10 minutes later...she still doesn't have her food. We see our waitress walk by TWICE (even looking at our table) without saying a word. Finally she came back with my friends food. Dropped the plate off without a word. No apology. No asking how our food came out. No refills on our waters. nothing... At this point we are all pretty annoyed. I couldn't help but notice that during the time where she was MIA her hairstyle magically changed. She had enough time to take out her long braid and pull her hair up in to some fancy ponytail...but no time to check on us. Less than 5 minutes into my friend finally getting her food she then asks if we want dessert...we say no..then 2 minutes later brings us the checks.. Keep in mind..my friend isn't even half done with her food. After bringing our check she finally refills our waters. Still no questions about how our food was etc etc. We requested to speak with the manager and my friend gave him an earfull on the waitresses lack of service. He was kind enough to take care of her meal.  Food is good, but I will make sure if I do come back to this location and I see this girl working I will request to not be seated in her zone. I don't pay my hard earned money to tip people who could care less"
Emily A.,"San Marcos, TX",0,1,,2.0,5/27/2017,"I am annoyed leaving here. Wasn't even in my car before I realized I forgot my to go box with my pizza that I didn't eat two slices from. Hadn't even been out the door for 30 seconds considering we parked directly in front. Run back in and it wasn't there. My table was still dirty with our plates but box was gone. Asked my waiter if they had it and said it was already thrown away. I get they can't hold on to leftover boxes for people who walk out without them for long but damn, I hadn't even sat in my car yet. What a waste of money. Disappointed that is what happened and they were so quick to throw it away. Didn't even give me a chance to come back."
Jennifer A.,"Grand Prairie, TX",0,10,2,3.0,4/3/2016,I ordered the wedge salad.  Brown lettuce - not good.   I ordered the vegetable pizza - good. Rootbeer - Excellent!
Jessica E.,"Keller, TX",13,84,20,2.0,8/30/2015,"Truly awful dining experience. The service was slow, the meals for our party of five all came to the table minutes apart so most of our party's food was cold by the time we started. I had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup that was pretty good, though the waiter poured the soup into my bowl on top of the lime wedge so I had to put my fingers in my soup to fish it out in order to use it.  The honey sriracha brussels sprouts that I ordered were completely inedible. I'm a brussels sprouts nut and cook them all the time at home, they're not a difficult vegetable! But the ones that they gave me were actually tough to chew and kind of burnt rather than caramelized. I asked the waitress to take them back because they were really bad and she asked me if I'd ever eaten them before and said they didn't look bad. I reassured her that they were awful and wanted a salad as a replacement. She obliged and took them back, but the rest of my party was done eating by the time I got my salad. Some of my party was happy with their food and they did take my bad brussels sprouts off the check so I'm giving it two stars but don't think I'll be coming back."
John W.,"Southlake, TX",26,38,1,4.0,6/11/2016,"Service is normally decent but occasionally lacks the extra umph to really make a place special. Food is great. Love the avocado egg rolls!! Grewt french fries and parm crusted chicken.  Has become our ""applebees"" in a sense. Just a good place with variety of food, tho a touch on the higher price side, but nothing too bad."
Sarah L.,"Grapevine, TX",141,42,61,4.0,8/29/2015,"The food is delicious and craft beers are usually  great. Our server was very friendly and had a smile the entire time.  I knocked off a star because service was slooowwww. They weren't busy and the kitchen took forever to get food out.  Also, I ordered a beer that never came out so I ended up canceling the order."
Richard S.,"Irving, TX",2,9,7,5.0,11/24/2015,"Great food, asked my server Justin for his recommendation on draft. He suggested the Grand Cru and I was very pleased with the smooth crisp flavor.  I came in for a steak, wanting a tenderloin, I opted for the sirloin. Other option was a 14oz ribeye for much more. I ordered med-rare and received med-well, but planning to go back and retry a med-rare. Great flavor for a sirloin and prompt service."
Mike V.,"Allen, TX",54,294,129,2.0,8/14/2015,"Last time i came here i had the french dip, they barely gave me any au jus with it (not enough to dip) and i had to ask the bartender for more. This time they didnt even have au jus, they just had a big bowl of seasoned oil ! gross !!! Im sorry, but there are tons of places to eat in SouthLake. Im not trying here again."
Haley K.,"North Richland Hills, TX",67,530,71,5.0,2/16/2016,"We had a very outstanding experience at this location yesterday afternoon. Ran an errand after school & my daughter had gotten a voucher from her teacher for BJ's so we decided to give this location a shot while in the area ... Because The north east mall location had lost our business years ago due to a situation that caused a type one diabetic friend to nearly pass out  we were excited to find out this location had opened. We had good service at the ones we had been to in Nevada visiting family so it was great to see that here at this location. Our waitress was on top of everything, refills, timing of everything was great. Everyone was friendly/great with my 8 year old & 9 month old. Food was outstanding & came out hot so we knew it was fresh from the back.  While I have my kids I personally don't drink but I've been told by my inlaws & sister in law that the drink selection is great so when given the chance  I will check that part out. Though I did see a house brewed root beer I can try with the kids next time."
Sandra R.,"Grapevine, TX",0,9,,4.0,6/16/2016,"Ambiance: This location is smaller than others, making it less cavernous and more fun. TVs well placed, and WIFI free without cumbersome signup. The Beer: Our waiter was very helpful, asking my taste and suggested a few. I wanted to taste two beers from the BJ's craft menu and our waiter brought them right away. One stood out- the BJ's Red. Will order it again. Happy Hour runs until 7pm $4 Handcrafted beers=happy customer.  The Food: Nice variety to choose from. My Brewhouse Burger with everything was tasty. I liked the bun. Fries are thin and crispy. My husband liked the ribs he got. Dessert was fab. I could have eaten The Salted Caramel Pizookie for an entrée. Loved.   * Thursday evening BabyBack Special is a good deal. * Half off some pizzas on Mondays in June The Service: We lucked out with Johnny, our waiter. Very friendly, helpful and attentive. Sit in his section. Plan ahead: they take reservations for one to six people We will be back to try the pizza and more beers. Tip: Try the Jeremiah Red at Happy Hour"
