Trice M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",35,82,90,4.0,9/18/2016,"I'm not sure why this place has less than 4 stars because my experience was great! I brought my friend from Maryland here for pre-concert drinks!!! The place was crowded and it was only 6pm on a Saturday so we decided to sit at the bar (choice well played).  Shane, our bartender, greeted us ever so kindly.  The cosmo (my Kryptonite) was so good.  Some bartenders put way too much cranberry but this was perfect . In the words of LMFAO and Lil Jon ""Shots, Shots, Shots everybody""  The pour...oh the pour on the Patron shots. Manager, Thomas, hooked that up!!!! Gracias por favor, Tomas!!!!  I wish I would have taken pictures of the pour but we were having so much fun and way too tipsy!  The pasta was good too (we customized the Italiano vegetable penne and added Salmon and shrimp!!!  Magnifico!!!  My friend loved this place!!! Her first impression of Texas was definitely a good one!   Great drinks, fabulous bartenders and manger, good food and service.  What a start to a great night!!!"
Cheyanne W.,"Irving, TX",6,17,9,5.0,7/26/2015,"If you haven't heard of a Pizookie, you need to rush to the nearest BJ'S and try it. The concept is a gooey cookie with ice cream on top served in a personal pan. The Salted Carmel Pizookie is an unhealthy blend of salty, sweet and everything in between. You can oder them large or in minis. There a other great flavors for those who enjoy a solid sugar rush, the triple chocolate, cookies and creme and peanut butter smores.  ALSO: the Asian Crunch salad and Mediterranean Pita tacos are delish!"
Tracy G.,"Colleyville, TX",1,4,,5.0,11/29/2015,Party of 20-9 of them kids!  Got a table ready right away for us and our Waiter GUS was awesome! He handled us and the kids as if he does it daily.  Thank you Gus for a fun night after Tolberts in Grapevine turned us down for service due to having 9 kids.  The manager at BJs was very sweet to us and accommodating and should go teach Tolberts how to manage a business! The Food was great!
Kevin E.,"Southlake, TX",0,3,,2.0,11/5/2016,"When it originally opened the food quality was very good particularly given the expansive menu. However for the past 4 months food quality has been very poor.  Burgers, presumably were fresh when originally opened, but are obviously frozen now.  Taste is poor.  Tuna salad with sushi grade tuna has been served twice now with stale lettuce and the size of the tuna cut is 50% of what it used to be.  Overall very disappointing and not a surprise that the restaurant is half empty when it was once packed."
Alana M.,"Southlake, TX",1,9,19,4.0,7/21/2015,"Started with a few appetizers for the table to share. Got potato skins, honey chipotle brussel sprouts, and the ahi poke. All appetizers were super delicious! The tables favorite was the potato skins.  Entrees included ribs, sirloin steak, roast beef dip, tomato basil soup, clam chowder soup, and a loaded burger. All were pretty decent tasting entrees. There's no way to end the night without having a pizookie and our table ordered a trio containing salted caramel, chocolate chunk, and triple chocolate. Seriously this pizookie is the bomb and worth the calories! Our waitress Lori was very attentive and kind throughout our entire meal. I'd highly recommend BJ's to anyone."
Jesse B.,"Grapevine, TX",69,4,11,4.0,8/14/2015,"We arrived around 830pm on a Friday night and there was no wait. Hardly a good sign. We were greeted quickly by our server, and had drinks not long after. We decided to start off with some Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. Take my advice and think twice before ordering these! Our server was very understanding and immediately switched it out for a safe bet, the avocado egg rolls. After another round of drinks we ordered our meals. My girlfriend was boring and got Fettuccini Alfredo. I ordered the brisket bacon burger. The burger was juicy and cooked medium rare, just how I like em!  Overall, this place is solid. It has some minor kinks to work out, but nobody is perfect, especially in the restaurant industry."
Ash K.,"Roanoke, TX",0,8,3,2.0,2/21/2016,"Straight to the negatives: Only have two bourbons! No wedge or sweet potato fries! There are many things they don't offer that other locations do since they have a ""small kitchen"". At least they had sriracha!"
Summer B.,"Roanoke, TX",0,9,,5.0,3/23/2017,"They have a great low calorie menu. My fiancée and I both ordered off it and he even had trouble finishing his plate. Very impressed with the restaurant in all. Every time I come, my experience gets better. Had a server named Michael H., I highly recommend him. Very social and great at handling tables!"
Carlos R.,"Southlake, TX",0,3,,3.0,11/12/2015,Food great.  Pazookie great. Waiter not so much. Service slow. Drinks only refilled when empty and waiting for several minutes. 10 minutes to bring me my bill. Had to ask for silverware twice.
Ken W.,"Roanoke, TX",54,137,1,1.0,8/5/2015,"The reason it's called BJ's is because it blows...Had to wait for a waitress to finally come over after 5 minutes...and the place was practically empty. Ordered fried chicken and potatoes..which was ok...my girlfriend ordered the french dip and it was horrible..they burnt..no charred the roll, the cheese was awful and the meat was very fatty...never again...."
Jolyn P.,"Southlake, TX",0,12,,1.0,9/11/2016,"We had horrible/slow/inaccurate/rude service when it first opened about a year ago, but we overlooked it because the business was new, growing pains, etc.  We revisited BJ's last night & once again, it was terrible. We sat at the table for 5-10 minutes before a waiter came over (& that was after we flagged one down), then another 15 or so to take an order. Then the order was wrong & waiter (who said he was the MANAGER) copped an attitude. The food was good, but the experience trumped it & we will not return."
Claudia S.,"Dallas, TX",0,8,,1.0,10/16/2015,"This was our second time coming here, and our second bad experience. We ordered soup and salad, and one order of tacos. It took about an hour total, with a few lies in between that our food was on its way out. If it's another 10 minutes, it wasn't on its way out.  After it was so late that we needed to leave, I asked to cancel our order, after hunting down our waiter who was ignoring us. He said no and promised our food was on its way, and a few minutes later, SOME of it was. No apologies, no discounts, no rush to get us the check, no attempt to pick it back up! My husband finally got up to find someone to hand our check to. Just astoundingly bad service, and so unapologetically slow, especially considering the items we ordered. Really bad."
Lauren C.,"Waco, TX",2,7,5,3.0,3/5/2016,"The root beer float is the move & the pizookies are str8 fire. Service is extremely friendly, but definitely a night long endeavor. Great place for squad meet ups; my squad hangs here all the time. Hit us up for a good time!!"
Bob T.,"Keller, TX",14,20,8,4.0,8/6/2015,"The food, drinks and beer are always great.  It's a little pricey and service leaves a lot to be desired. I'll be back and maybe some day they'll earn that coveted 5th star."
Tonya M.,"Southlake, TX",0,31,30,5.0,9/4/2015,"Great food, great service (Lori was the best!), great atmosphere, tasty drinks made right there. We WILL be back!  This was our second visit and we were awed both times! First visit was during happy hour and the pizzas for $5 were incredible. Get there before 6:00 for the happy hour.  Plus, Join their ""club"" and pay by phone and get 20% off entire food bill EVERYTIME you go"
pete s.,"Colleyville, TX",19,21,,2.0,7/18/2015,"I visited this locale on Saturday circa 615pm.  No wait which is nice. However, the service was horrible. Our waiter was not very attentive so we have to ask several times for items. The food came AFTER the manager delivered it to us and apologized for the 29 minute wait. My wife and I both ordered fish which was cold and overcooked.  When it came to the bill. Our waiter stopped by our table with another table's dirty dish on his hands.  When we rejected the desert idea - he began to search his pockets for our bill AND PLACED ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S DIRTY DISH on our table in order to free his hands.  The waiter (Herbert) NEVER apologized for the lengthy wait time for food.  I know new locales have to workout their service kinks but this restaurant does not meet baseline expectations - tasteful food, lack of timely food delivery, and ownership for bad service. Net.. net... I will NOT be returning to this locale.  The only good thing about this place - no wait (I know why now) and their air conditioning works well."
Afton F.,"Dallas, TX",79,23,14,1.0,6/17/2015,"Love BJ's but why do you hire a bunch of inexperienced people to work for a restaurant opening? This place is a circus.  The Togo lady had no idea what she was doing, took forever just to acknowledge that I was there then finally asked what I had. Been waiting 15 minutes now for a call ahead order. I asked the manager if I could at least go ahead and pay for it and he walked up to the computer and then walked away! I guess not...."
Nicole C.,"Grapevine, TX",0,16,,2.0,6/25/2016,"The food and service here are great. Johnny was our waiter and he was helpful with the menu and very personable. BUT the music was ridiculously loud and head banging. We couldn't hear our friends across the booth from us. We asked the manager to please turn it down, which she did for one song.   We will not be back, way too many places to eat that doesn't give me a headache."
Shiela M.,"Frisco, TX",68,124,280,1.0,7/7/2015,The service at this location lacks. We came in at 11:50. It's 12:40 and we still haven't received our lunch. The waiter hasn't even checked up on us. Not coming back.
Terry W.,"Grapevine, TX",15,112,4,5.0,6/19/2015,"The wait staff at the Southlake location were great.  I thought it was a slow time, but they were busy.  Even with it being off hours, they had a pretty good crowd and plenty of wait staff.  Ashley was our server and she did a great job.  We are not the easiest people to wait on (I am difficult and my friends who drink sometimes mess up the process!). I ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer, and wow!  Ok, I love sushi anyway, but that being said I am very picky about my fish.  The Ahi has a fantastic flavor and is very simple.  Honestly, next time I will probably just order 2 of those and make it a meal.  The only complaint I would have, is that it would be easier to work with if I had been given chopsticks.  Trying to put the tuna on a wonton cracker is difficult with a fork...  Just saying. All my friends were happy about the beers they tried and loved the food.  It was a great time for all."
