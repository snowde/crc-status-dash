Kevin H.,"Northlake, TX",4,79,5,2.0,9/7/2015,"What a mess. The service in this place sucks to no end. Of course if ur a regular, and I don't c y u would be, u would get waited on fast an get ur food fast too. Just like the couple that came in just after I did. It wasn't 5mins after I got to finally place my order, they had their food. And the waitress kept goin back an talking to them and some loud drunk at the bar. The only thing I can say nice is that the food (once I got it) was good, not great, but good. Disappointed to the max. I won't be back here, ever."
Michael P.,"Southlake, TX",2,5,2,1.0,7/24/2016,Service was good.  Nice waitress    Horrible Food..   Don't order the Ribeye steak... $21 down the drain.  3/4 of the streak was fat  the rest tuff as cardboard. My daughter had brisket sandwich fries were dry cold and hard.   Guess if you come in a little drunk and have a few beers and a pizza you ll be okay    Otherwise   Keep going.!! Lots of restaurants in the area.  My first and last time here...
K H.,"Grapevine, TX",0,9,1,2.0,5/2/2016,"No Coke products, so we almost left right then. What's with restaurants no longer trying to please their customers?  Salad didn't have enough dressing and too much arugula. Deep-fried artichokes came with a sauce but were mushy and not very good.  Pizza was so-so, burger with bacon, guacamole,  jalapeños and fries was great. Service was also great, but $12 hamburgers when Kincaids is across the street isn't going to happen."
Kathy K.,"Euless, TX",183,6,,2.0,9/28/2015,"The service was terrible!!  My friend and I ordered lemon drop martinis & we were brought raspberry lemon martinis, then it took forever to get the correct drinks.  Waiter was slow, no personality.  Problems persisted, will not go back to this location! But the manager gave us free appetizers because of the problems, nice!"
James D.,"Southlake, TX",32,10,,2.0,8/3/2016,"I used to love BJ's brewhouse, but this Southlake location has left something to be desired for me.  Seems like the food always takes a while to come out and when it gets there seems like it was ready awhile ago and has been sitting under a lamp.  Great beer selection and my son likes the house made root beer, but the food has been pretty drab.  We only go now when someone else suggests it, but not a big fan anymore."
D O.,"New York, NY",2,43,2,5.0,5/4/2016,"Good food choices on the menu, but I would like to see a few more healthy choices. However the food is excellent and they have EXCELLENT  friendly service!   This is a favorite one of my places to go."
Cammie S.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,5,,1.0,1/8/2016,We were excited when they opened.  Won't be back.  We've eaten in the restaurant several times and the service was awful.  We thought we would try take out.  The food tasted amazing but one would think that quinoa was worth it's weight in gold as little as they give you in the quinoa bowl.  The chicken my coworker got appeared to be hard to saw through with the plastic knife.  I was starving after eating.  The office as a whole had a bad experience and decided that was the last trip to BJs.
Nat S.,"Keller, TX",0,29,,2.0,1/16/2016,"Since opening this restaurant neither the customer service or food has improved. Example: When dining in recently we ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was burnt as it had been cooked too long because the kitchen did not have the oil hot enough (foodie here). The past three times eating here the order was either wrong or incomplete. We thought by ordering takeout of simple sandwiches last night would be error-free, wrong again. The order was wrong and when asked if they could check the order before leaving with it the server was rude about it. Officially finished with the place. I hope they improve, otherwise this is just another subpar chain, no better than an Applebee's."
Zach B.,"Roanoke, TX",135,3,,1.0,3/19/2016,"The food was not what we asked for. We had a pizza and two drinks, never got refills, and had to ask for napkins which took 15 minutes to receive. We were there waiting for the check for 30 minutes. I will not be returning."
Sabrina M.,"Grapevine, TX",39,70,83,4.0,11/24/2015,"During lunch on a Saturday, we were seated right away.  Love the open feeling of the restaurant!  We both had the clam chowder in a bread bowl and it's the best I've had in the area!  The bread was toasted just right and the top comes as garlic toast.  Perfect for a cold day!"
Linus L.,"Fremont, CA",2,21,,1.0,11/30/2015,"I've eaten at several of the BJ's restaurants in California and have never been disappointed.  But this new one in Southlake, never going to go back again! Went out for a family dinner with the wife and child.  The avocado rolls were not fully fried and so were a little doughy.  1) I got the shrimp pasta. The pasta that was in my plate looked like a bunch of ropes twined together. They didn't even bother to cook it properly!!! 2) My wife got the fish and chips. The fish was rubbery and bitter!!!! 3) My 2 y.o got a cheese sandwich with vegetables. The veggies looked like they were frozen and merely thawed.  I waitress was slow and didn't care much about service. I requested to speak to the manager and he took a look at my noodles (before I even complained) and said ""Oh boy!"". I told him the fish was chewy and he goes ""did it taste bitter?!!!"" (like he already knew!!!). The manager then goes on to apologize and said "" we are 3/3, so I will have a chat with my kitchen manager to fix this problem"".  They charged my only for the beer. Paid and walked out.  So much for a family dinner!"
Kye K.,"Seguin, TX",0,13,9,3.0,7/2/2015,"It's 12 pm, lunch hour. The place is pretty crowded, but we  (my family and I) managed to get a nice seat  thanks to fast service and good timing. With got our great waiter, we had gotten our drinks in less than 15 minutes at rush hour. The food came in about 45 minutes later, but it was rush hour and my mom and I had ordered pizza while my father ordered a huge plate. We had some Caesar salad complications, there was only supposed to be two for the side,  but we somehow ended up with three. The salads lettuce tasted old.  Our food came out very late, but it was very busy so that's okay. When our food arrived, we discovered that my supposed to be cheese pizza, was pepperoni. Both of my moms pizza and mine was burnt. My dads meal, was good. Overall, I give this place three stars. I'm excusing the slow service, busy day. Along with the Caesar salad mixup, the guy looked new. If you're going here, don't go on a busy day."
Jeana B.,"Lexington, KY",8,15,11,3.0,11/30/2015,"The reason I gave this restaurant three stars is because the service is lousy. Our waiter forgot our drinks and needed several reminders. Had a sour attitude towards our table, my moms food took about thirty minutes to come out after they messed it up the first time. (Yes I realize it takes long to cook food but my next point) The waiter should have written the orders down instead of trying to go by memory. For some reason we keep returning to this establishment only because of the food. The service has been crappy every time that we have ended up with a free meal on each of our trips here. Hopefully you all don't experience this. P.s Tortilla soup is the bomb."
Morgan W.,"Irving, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/27/2016,"BJ's has awesome food but the service was absolutely awful (the hostess who greeted us was wonderful and very nice). We went at 2:00 pm and the restaurant was maybe half full at most. We sat down and were passed by 4+ servers who just looked at us and continued walking. 15 minutes later our server came by and asked us for our order. Since we had quite some time to look at the menu, we wanted to go ahead and order our food too so we could minimize our wait time. When we told our waitress, she wouldn't let us and said she was going to get our drinks first. After taking our drink order, she proceeded to greet and take orders for a table of 4 that had JUST sat down mere seconds ago (keep in mind that this was 15 minutes after we had been seated).  After taking their order, she disappeared for another 10 minutes and she served the other table before us even though we had waited much longer. She placed our drinks on the table and once again, didn't take our food order. She left again making us wait even longer.  She then went to another table and took their drink orders! She couldn't take our food order but went directly to another table to take their drink order. They also got to order their appetizer with their drinks unlike when she told us we couldn't. We then watched the table of 4 receive their food before us even though we were a party of 2 that ordered before them. When we got our food, one of the orders was incorrect. We had ordered a burger without tomatoes and mayo. When we got the burger it only had meat and the bun. It was completely bare. The kitchen hadn't put anything on it. The waitress had to go to the back and get the missing lettuce and onion to bring to our table. Once we were done, we got our pizookie (the manager had told us if we download the BJs app, we would get it for free. And if we had problems downloading it, just let our server know and they would take care of it).  When trying to download the app, we had issues because the service was very weak inside the building. We told the server this and she said okay no problem. She then comes back to the table and tells us that the manager needs us to download the app so she can see it when she had told us otherwise on our initial entrance (the app was taking so long to download due to the service). This was so frustrating as the manager was contradicting her initial statement. We then tried downloading it again and spent 15 minutes waiting for it to download just to have the server come by and tell us the manager took care of it. It was yet another wasted 15 minutes. This was unbelievable customer service and just downright bad. I will not be returning to this location as it's clear that their focus isn't on customer service.  Completely turned off by this and that we were shoved in a back corner and ignored for 20+ minutes.  Our servers name was Sophia."
Rosemarie A.,"Gainesville, TX",0,3,,1.0,11/17/2015,This was the worst BJ's I have ever been to.  The service was so slow and the restaurant was empty there is no excuse for service this slow.  I had the mahi mahi tacos.  They were cold and terrible.  My husband had the jambalya it was also dry (no sauce) and terrible.  We have eaten at other BJ's and the food was great.  Plus the service was just bad.  I don't know how Southlake can mess up a great chain like this.  I have eaten in Hurst many times and everything was great.
Darlen W.,"Atlanta, GA",65,253,,3.0,6/3/2015,"BJ's is definitely corporately good.  Compared, however, to the other restaurants and beer places in the area, it kind of falls short.  Their beer is good and they offer other selections other than their own.  Their food is palatable, nothing outstanding, but you are getting something good.  Our visit was great, there are just better options in the area."
Susan L.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",0,8,3,5.0,7/14/2015,My husband and I sat at the bar and they had great happy hour deals. Erik was our bartender and he was very attentive. The gluten free pizzas are great!
Jane C.,"Keller, TX",41,1,,5.0,8/23/2015,"I've seen a lot of reviews on here about the service being terrible, and I think I'm going to credit that to being a fairly new restaurant. They opened this spring, or early summer, I think, and I don't doubt the service was terrible then. But it has improved so much! My husband and I are practically regulars, and we've never had sub-par service. One of the bartenders, Ashley, is my absolute favorite! She makes the best drinks, and is a total sweetheart! If you went to this location when it was still really new, give it another shot! The service has really improved."
Elizabeth N.,"Grapevine, TX",0,2,,1.0,6/15/2015,It's a Monday night and it took FOREVER to get our food. Wedge salads were not the same size (one was much smaller than the other) and there were BUGS on the table. The manager did NOTHING. She didn't comp the salad or anything else. There are many pizza options in Southlake. Do not eat here. Thanks!
Shane M.,"Euless, TX",2,2,,1.0,6/15/2015,Love BJs but the new on Southlake needs help. Sat at bar and waited 10 minutes for a bottled bud light
