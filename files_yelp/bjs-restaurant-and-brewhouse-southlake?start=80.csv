S B.,"Dallas, TX",0,18,2,1.0,2/1/2016,"SLOW and thoughtless. After calling to get details on the toppings not listed on a menu item, I placed an order for Curbside pick up. Since I had to be put on hold twice to find out the answer to basic menu questions, I shouldn't have ignored the signs of SLOW service. I pull up to curbside 5 mins after I was told it would be ready. I call, and was told ""it's still cooking, and 2 more minutes"". I ordered a baked potato and cup of soup. I doubt the baked potato is made to order, but ok. I wait 10 more minutes... No sign of anyone... Then I walk inside and Im greeted by a smirky almost laughing wait staff person saying that ""the chef"" burned my potato. So, they're starting over. Really?? No one could walk outside and tell me?  And so I said forget it it's now been almost 30  minutes since I was told it would be ready.  The Chef burned a POTATO?!? ridiculous... So I walked out lunchless.  Unfortunately, this is quite common service/experience for most Southlake restaurants at lunch. My first curbside service at BJs is now my last."
Kathleen B.,"Keller, TX",6,15,2,5.0,11/15/2015,Erik the bartender is so friendly and has a great attitude.  Food is always good. Atmosphere is cool. Very friendly staff. Love this location
Ashley T.,"Southlake, TX",498,1,,2.0,7/17/2015,Great food but awful service. We came in with a party of 9 and multiple tables that could have fit our group opened up. The wait staff decided to break the tables up and give them to smaller parties that came in after we had arrived. 7 different groups walked up after us that were seated in tables that could have fit our group. The women at the front told us our table was being cleaned off but 20 minutes later it was still not ready. She then said she could split us up but the tables were across the restaurant from each other. We decided to split up so we could finally grab food. The waitress took about 15 minutes to just grab waters. It wasn't completely packed this evening either. There were open tables and the wait staff did not look overly concerned with moving quickly. Again great food but horrible service. I'll never come back to this location.
Katie b.,"Berkley, MI",2,10,,1.0,12/27/2015,Horrible service. Was there almost 30 minutes and didn't have a single waiter stop by. Ended up walking out.
Mark T.,"Keller, TX",45,81,,4.0,8/27/2015,"Been here twice...both times with the wife and kids.  Both times a Wednesday and Friday were packed.  Food is solid, it's not spectacular and beer is cold.  Prices are affordable and they even have their own app to order and save $$$ on.  Service was good too.  No complaints"
Janet H.,"Colleyville, TX",127,4,,1.0,11/20/2015,"I have eaten at this location 4 times.  Each time I thought there was no way the service could be worse...I was wrong!  Food was pretty good but our party of 6 were served our entrees at different times.  My meal was pretty good but we had to ask for drink refills several times.  Waiter offered dessert about 5 minutes after the last entree arrived.  Um...no thanks and we had to track him down to ask for drinks once again.  Each time, I swear I won't go back but I have friends that like the food..."
Mel C.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,6,5,1.0,9/6/2015,our appetizers came after we ordered our dinner. and by dinner we ordered soup...which took 30mins to get. the service is the worst ever. we will go to any BJ's except this one.
Maggie B.,"Hoboken, NJ",258,41,14,4.0,7/3/2015,So glad they have this in Southlake! The service was great from our waiter although it was a little slow for the kitchen but it was pretty busy and it's a new restaurant. Been there twice now. I loved the healthy menu options - the Barbacoa chicken was amazing! Also the Santa Fe salad was really yummy. Potato skins were delish and sooo much beer to try! Have had three different kinds and have yet to be disappointed. Cheers to BJs
Jane S.,"Southlake, TX",0,6,2,5.0,7/22/2015,"We had a great experience at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse Tuesday night. We weren't sure if our party would be 4 or 5 but the ladies who greeted us (without a reservation) were very polite and accommodating and we were given a table with 5 chairs and plenty of room within 5-6 minutes. Lori our server was extremely attentive and got us drinks right away even though our entire party wasn't there yet. She also made sure menus, appetizers were all added as the rest of our party joined us. Our drink glasses were never empty. The appetizers were delicious potato skins by far the best. Brussels sprouts, which we all normally love were sadly over cooked and left a pretty strong burnt taste in our mouths. Poke tuna also delicious. Clam chowder bowl rivaled that of our favorite place in Monterey,California-needless to say, delicious! Ribs were fall off the bone tender. The double bacon cheeseburger was the envy of the table topped only by the pizookie  cookie sundaes. Chocolate chunk and salted caramel won out of all three ordered. Terrific experience. Wait staff cleared dishes so promptly we never had to ask. The food was timed perfectly. All in all...a new favorite destination for a quick lunch or casual evening out. A really nice addition to the Southlake lineup of new restaurants along the boulevard!"
Patrick S.,"Southlake, TX",0,12,,1.0,4/24/2016,"I've now been to this location of BJ's in Southlake about 5 or 6 times since thy opened.  Each time I say I'll never go back but I keep giving it a chance. Well after today's experience I definitely will not return.  The service is always slow and the wait staff has one excuse after the next.  For the second time I've gotten the excuse that that food fell on the ground when they were bringing it out after they obviously forgot our appetizer, I guess that must be a standard trained response.  Training is obviously lacking.  The wait staff saunters around the restaurant either because they are unhappy or just don't care.  The food is mediocre and it's just not worth it when there are so many other options available.  Will never go back there.  By the way, when the food takes for ever to come out, they say the kitchen is in the red, the restaurant was not even full.  I think management needs to take a good look at who's running the show here."
Geana W.,"Culpeper, VA",0,33,11,3.0,6/25/2015,"The food was ok. I got the ahi salad, my husband and daughter got burgers. The service was unbelievably slow. The manager came over and apologized and offered free desserts. That's great and all but even the dessert was painfully slow. This meal took us over two hours!!!!  Crazy. Hopefully this isn't normal for this place."
Shelly M.,"Lewisville, TX",0,1,,2.0,10/3/2015,"Tried BJ's Friday night 10/2/15- We seated fast, but we were there for an hour and 45 mins.  The service was horribly slow and our food (especially the pizza) was cold. The pizza was the driest pizza ever, there was no sauce (LITERALLY) and it was cold!!!  We asked for more sauce and it took 10 mins. to get it back to us, then the pizza was extremely cold.  Flavor was good but otherwise one of the worst pizzas EVER!!! We've dined at other BJ's and the pizza was good.  We were excited to see BJ's in the neighborhood.   It was basically an Awful Experience!  The waiter and personnel in general were very nice, but no where to be found for refills or other items needed.  The staff seemed good when asked to help, so I'm confused why this was the case.  We felt like we were there forever and the place was not even close to being full.  We were there 8pm and left almost 2 hrs later and said, ""that was awful, we should have sent our food back and complained to the manager.""  But we were with guests for the evening, there were 4 of us total and my husband said. ""if they were not with us we DEFINITELY would have COMPLAINED.""  We didn't want to ruin the evening more by making a scene. I give this 2 stars because the staff was friendly, but nothing for the food or service. I hope they improve and it becomes a nice place to eat in the future. :)"
Jenna T.,"Roanoke, TX",0,1,,5.0,7/4/2015,"Carl was our waiter and he enhanced our dining experience. The pazookies were amazing. Request Carl, he is a great waiter."
Lauren M.,"Southlake, TX",0,1,,3.0,6/26/2015,"My mom, sister, and I went here for lunch one day and the food was pretty good. We liked our dessert the most, but the service was really,really,really slow. I probably would not go back to this location again."
Lisette A.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/29/2015,"Well we got food. That is about the best I can say. Our waiter Gus was nice and prompt to say hi at first, even got us an extra glass of ice. However after waiting over 40 minutes for three burgers and a California club he was avoiding us. I had to track another waiter down who told us there was a backup on burgers. Yet she had just given her table a burger that was seated after us. We watched as three tables sat after us got food and ate and left. The manager came out to apologize and bring my five year old her burgers without cheese and brown lettuce with the tops of old tomatoes on the side. The veggies and dip where supposed to be broccoli and carrots with ranch. My daughter got ranch and the ends of old brown celery( the parts you cut off and discard). The manager and waiter apologized and comped half our meals but after that long of a wait and such poor quality of food it really just wasn't worth it. Not going back!!!"
Elke E.,"Keller, TX",0,3,,2.0,6/17/2015,"I've tried this place twice since it opened. We were so excited, we've been so happy with every other location we've tried. First visit: kids pizza undercooked, they ran out of my pizookie flavor (salted caramel) do they brought peanut butter instead - yuck! Then the waiter decided I needed to know what he does in real life, since he's not really a waiter, he's an ultimate fighting championship enthusiast - ok wow, who cares. Second visit tonight - waiter worse than first one, left empty drinks tray on our table for 15 minutes until we asked him to remove it. The Ahi tuna salad tasted dirty and the avocado was brown and mushy. Otherwise food was ok, but once again I got waiters life story without prompting, this one owns his own landscaping business and lives in a huge fancy house his father in law bought him and his girlfriend when he was 18. He only waits tables for beer money apparently, again who cares? If you don't want to do this job than leave it to people who need / want to work there! Was the hiring manager so bad this is the caliber of people they were able to get? I don't know if we will return, I don't want to hear about how my server is too good to be doing his job. I would recommend corporate send in managers quickly to salvage. It's not good."
