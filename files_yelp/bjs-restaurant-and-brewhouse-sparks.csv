Donna M.,"Reno, NV",142,17,8,5.0,12/19/2017,One of my favorite places to eat. Chipotle Blackened salmon salad is one of my favorite things on the menu. & a blk velvet beer. There's so many free options on the menu.
Matthew L.,"Reno, NV",384,23,123,4.0,11/21/2017,"The Thursday rib special is mostly why I come here!  $18.95 for a full rack of ribs, two sides, a salad, and a mini pizookie is incredible!  If that doesn't convince you how good this deal and ribs are then this next part might. My girlfriend who came with me was a vegetarian before she had these ribs. She had ordered salmon tacos while I had the rib special. She took one whiff of the ribs and was instantly craving them!  Get em! They're amazing. Make sure you call to see if they still have them available for that Thursday or you will be most disappointed upon arrival"
Donna B.,"Reno, NV",432,955,5357,2.0,9/29/2017,"This is where the group wanted to grab a bite. And the visit reminds me why I don't care for large chain restaurants.  Three of us walked in around 5:30 pm on a Friday for happy hour after an escape room visit. The restaurant was at least a third empty and we were asked to wait 5 minutes or do to be seated. HH is only served at the bar, I discovered after being seated in the main restaurant. I ordered sliders from the small plate appetizer pages because I wasn't in the mood to look thru the entire menu. BJ has a book of a menu that I don't care for- how can all that food be fresh?  The sliders had an up-charge for cheese and another for fries.  The sliders were tasteless and were missing the grilled onions.  I did ask for the fries to be extra crispy and came swimming in a small pool of grease, but were crispy.  Our server was fabulous, checking on us often and separating the checks."
Nancy H.,"Reno, NV",45,60,96,4.0,11/30/2017,"On our way to coconut bowl for the kids activities, we stoped at bj's to have a quick and nutritious meal. It was lunch time and not fully packed..but the service is kind of slow..boys started to get frustrated and bored.  Luckily the food tasted good and they loved it..."
Krystle G.,"Sparks, NV",45,7,3,5.0,1/2/2018,We cant get enough of this place. They have sensation beer and fun drink specials. The food is always good no matter what you get and the service is great. Love sitting outside in the summer and enjoying a huge salad and a cold beer. They always have some kind of special and that makes it fun and makes you feel good about going out!  Take your family or have a girls night! Either way this place is great! I love the peanut butter pazookie with chocolate ice cream!
Kathie A.,"Carson City, NV",41,2,3,5.0,1/7/2018,"BJ's has always been a great go-to restaurant for my family to go to (everyone can find something on the menu). However, this time was exceptionally different. On that day of my graduation from the University of Nevada, Reno (go Wolf Pack!), I was incredibly happy to have family from Las Vegas, NV and Lancaster, CA be part of my special day. We were very thankful to BJ's for allowing us to walk in during this busy time without a reservation, considering we had a party of 14. We were seated at about 6:00 pm and from then on, our experience was beyond what we had expected. We have always had great experiences at BJ's, but this visit was exceptionally different. It exceeded our expectations, mostly due to our incredible waitress, Julie E. She was incredibly friendly, accommodating, attentive, and an overall AMAZING individual. She had patience with everyone as we ordered, asked for additional condiments during the meal, and she frequently checked-in on us - all during a very busy night. The most impressive thing was this: I asked her for a group picture and I have never seen anyone go above and beyond to make this happen. She was a fairly small girl and needed a boost to fit everyone in the frame. A co-worker of hers brought her a small stool and she made it happen! It is such a small gesture, but to customers who are sharing a meal with their loved ones, it means the world. This type of customer service and hospitality is what every restaurant needs. This employee is very special and people like her are what give customers an incredibly positive experience. Thank you, BJ's, for not only serving delicious food but also hiring exceptional employees like Julie!"
May C.,"Sparks, NV",4,26,33,5.0,12/14/2017,Got an email from the directing Manager..he was super nice and apologetic. And offered me a $15 E-card credit towards my future dining! Will definatly go back not just cuz the credit..hopefully for better service!!!
Kathereene C.,"Reno, NV",39,172,69,4.0,11/24/2017,"Awesome experience :) My team of 12 was accomodated on a timely manner, and none of the orders were missed!!! The food was delicious and the customer service was superb!"
Stephanie G.,"Reno, NV",269,204,1498,3.0,3/21/2017,"What sucks so much about this three stars, is I actually really love the food here. Most the time, and the service is usually great, most the time. Last night, the hubby and I decided to stop at BJ's for some late night dinner after our enchanted Beauty and the Beast movie. After scouring the huge menu, I decided on the shrimp and asparagus penne and my hubby ordered a mini pizza. Our server mentioned that large pizzas were half off on Monday, so we went with a large. Mike's rewards card was acting up and so the waitress said a manager was coming to talk to us about it. The food came. The pizza was huge, cheesy and delicious! However, my pasta was VERY Al Dente. Too Al Dente. I know the perfect bite for a pasta, and this wasn't it. BJ's, your Penne Pasta needs to be cooked a tiny bit longer. If it's par boiled and then held, the par boil, does need to be longer.  Either way I ended up ordering the mediterranean tacos, to go.  So why the three stars? Well tonight the waitress was great and did her job perfectly, yet I feel as if the manager on duty failed. He never came to our table to discuss the loyalty card, and never came to apologize about the food mishap either, which we all know a plate sent back warrants a visit from an apologetic manager, ready with solutions to make the customer happy.  Pizookie anyone? I'm not above a bribe! Lol ok so all joking aside, it felt like he didn't care enough to come out of wherever he was, to address any situations. Finally as we were leaving, the manager appeared out of no where, still never approaching us, to say ""Have a goodnight!""  ...Well honestly manager man, it would have been better if you'd made an appearance. Said anything to us at all. You're lucky to have a wait staff whose as good and friendly as they are! Because otherwise I would have been more upset about the whole situation. I'd say BJ's is more of a, not too late, late night, ...nothing else is open and fast food doesn't sound great, option."
Kristina K.,"Sparks, NV",73,135,154,4.0,9/19/2017,"We don't come here very often as usually the times that we are out it is really busy.  But on the few occasions we have been here the food was good, the beer was cold and the service was great. They have an app for your phone which if you plan ahead you can check the wait times, reserve a table so when you get there you don't have a crazy long wait to get seated. We will be back, just not sure when."
Ryan W.,"Las Vegas, NV",78,50,214,4.0,8/24/2017,"BJs is my go to restaurant for Sparks when you can't decide where to eat or need a diverse menu to satisfy everyone. Every time I've been to this location the service has been prompt and friendly and this last time was no difference. No matter what day of the week I go, there always seems to be a short wait if you go between 6-7pm.  We started with the spinach artichoke dip. The chips were thin and seemed like they were made in house. The dip was ok but thankfully the chips were delicious. For dinner I got the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. I have no tolerance for spice but took the risk because I really wanted salmon. If you got this dish hoping it had some kick to it you'd be thoroughly disappointed, but thankfully the lack of spice was good news for me. It was sweet but not overpowering. Overall I was happy with the dish. And of course if you go to BJs you have to end with a pizookie. Or two. ;)"
Kalliope B.,"Reno, NV",130,65,200,4.0,8/10/2017,We ate here last night and the special was $4 craft beer pints and $10 loaded burgers!!  Plus we had a $10 off $35 coupon so why not !   We got great service and the server allowed my husband to try a few beers before ordering.  Everything was cooked to order and they got my order right even my well done burger!   You also get rewards if you download the app to your phone !
Debra K.,"Sparks, NV",62,195,661,4.0,1/27/2017,"I love BJ's. There menu is extensive, maybe to big, but they have everything from pizza, burgers, steaks, soups, salads, and much more. Tonight I ordered quinoo chicken. It was delicious. It was served on a bed of spinach,surrounded by tomato's and mushrooms. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. The chicken was cooked in a pan and seated. I passed on having dessert because my meal was so big. Definitely will order this again."
LaRena F.,"Sparks, NV",343,390,3161,5.0,1/19/2017,Sometimes we just need to splurge and indulge. I decided to use the delivery service Eat 24 Yelp. It was the first time doing so. SO VERY GLAD I DID. What an incredible service. I was surprised of the number of choices in restaurants I could choose from. I ordered from BJ's. I placed my order and was informed it would take 60-90 minuets. It took approximately an hour and 15 minuets. That is from the time I ordered it to all the way out in Spanish Springs. RIGHT ON!! Michelle the delivery driver was unbelievably friendly and kind. She was so kind I gave her a hug. I was surprised at how quickly my order arrived. So very pleased with the delivery service and would definitely order through them again. My son had the salmon and said it was off the hook. His rice and veggies were on point too. My parmesan chicken was good not great. The mashed potatoes were creamy and heavenly. The monkey bread was ok. I think it tastes better at the restaurant.
Amanda F.,"Reno, NV",115,89,162,2.0,7/20/2017,"I would be giving this a 1 star, had I not been MANY, MANY times before and had a positive experience.  This is just the first time I am reviewing this restaurant as a Yelper. Last night a large group of us met for drinks after work.  We brought an out of town visitor, knowing that BJ's has such an extensive menu, and having been pleased in previous visits, we felt like this was a good choice.  The one thing I can say is consistent is the wait.  Every time we come here we have to wait longer than we should (for the food).  Whether I've gone with 2 people, or 10, they are slow.  I have always blamed it on the fact that they are busy, but last night that was not the case.  My first thought as I walked in was about how quiet it seemed in comparison to every other time I have gone.   Drinks at the bar were fine.  I was served right away, the bar tender was of average friendliness.   They were out of many beers, so my companions didn't get their first or 2nd choice, but they found something wet and alcohol flavored, so they were good to go.  After 30 minutes at the bar we moved to a table.  It took about another 30 minutes to get water-after we had ordered appetizers 20 minutes after being seated.  I wasn't super annoyed at that point because the drinks had kicked in, we were enjoying ourselves, so whatevs.  Oh, and they were always around to take drink orders.   When we got the appetizers, they were quickly gone-we ordered brussel sprouts-which are always good and my personal fave.  We also got the avocado egg rolls, calamari, pot stickers, artichokes (fried) and ahi.  Avocado rolls were consistent and good, ahi I only received a small bite but it seemed fine.  Then another 20 minutes or so after the appetizers were gone, they took our dinner orders.  We didn't receive our food until about 7:30, and we had arrived at BJ's at 5.   3 of us ordered the ahi salad.  3 of us did not enjoy it.  Having ordered it several times before, I knew something was wrong.  Since we were with a visitor, it had taken so long to get our food, and at this point, I just wanted to go home, I didn't say anything.  I ate around it.  After completing the meal and our guest had left, I was told that others felt the same.  It just wasn't good.  Our bad for not telling anyone, but at this point, we were all tired. I don't understand why BJ's is always so slow, but I was surprised that the food was bad.  They also served us at different times.  My friends waited at least 10 minutes AFTER me to receive their jambalaya, Alfredo, and Peruvian quinoa and shrimp.  They liked it though, so at least they got full!   We were going to come here for another business lunch today, but have decided to take our business lunch somewhere else.  We can't afford to wait like we did last night, and we can't afford to serve our guest sub par food.  I am sure I will be back again due to the close proximity to my job, but I don't know that I will order the ahi again."
Jeff G.,"Klamath Falls, OR",4,24,2,2.0,10/22/2017,"Good music. Quiet atmosphere. Food was decent, however, when we ordered the first time they did not have the stuff for our order, so we had to order again. Great start! Then when requesting garlic in my steak and mashed potatoes I was surprised to find that the cooks smothered my steak in garlic powder and completely left it out of my potatoes. Upon reminding our server, I was presented with MORE garlic powder. I told her I was more thinking fresh if they had it? (I would have taken raw or even sautéed). Finally she brings out the ""fresh, sautéed"" garlic and it was refrigerator cold. Mmm. Talk about unappetizing. Meal done. Not the best. As a matter of fact, I gave them 3 stars but now I'm gonna give them 2."
Katie M.,"Larkspur, CA",184,9,,1.0,12/17/2017,"Seriously? Thank you BJ's for ROBBING me of 50 something dollars. I've loved going to BJ's for years and the food was always good, but will never go back after this experience. I ordered delivery, paid 15 extra dollars for the delivery service they use, and the food that arrived was complete garbage. The $13 dollar salad I ordered was 97% romaine lettuce and had barely any of the toppings that it was supposed to come with, you know..the ones I was looking forward to eating. It was also supposed to have avocado in it and they forgot the avocado. The spaghetti entree had barely any sauce and was completely tasteless. The fried artichokes were so gross I threw them out, along with the rest of the food. They clearly just don't give a shit about their delivery orders. Save your money."
Joanna V.,"Las Vegas, NV",485,469,6111,4.0,11/26/2016,"We intended to hit up Grimaldi's, except that restaurant has still yet to be constructed. Alright BJ's you're getting our business... Seated within 5 minutes and greeted by Alejandra.  I like the interior of BJ's.  I like their beer selections.  Their menu has a good variety of choices.  It's a casual atmosphere.  TV's are even placed in the regular dining areas.   Let's start with their limited edition Grand Cru beer and a draft root beer.  Hmmm that looks good - avocado egg rolls!!!  Lured by appetizing pictures, decided pretty quick on what to eat: Salmon quinoa bowl - The winning dish in our lunch choices.  Enjoyed this very much; really tasty!  I can never get quinoa flavor to stick at home.  This bowl was really delish with the asparagus and red bell peppers.  Topped with a nice flaky flavorful salmon.  Nom-awesome! Seared Ahi salad - Liked it not loved it.  Made sure we ate the ahi first cuz the rest of the salad was typical like any other.  The presentation was really pretty.  But our salad had to be redone due to a hair mixed into the salad.   So how many of you say ""can't dine at BJ's without having a Pizookie""?  Mmmhmmm... nobody's judging.  I think the same way hahaha!  Look I even ordered it to take out cuz Ness had to go to work.  It was still sweetly yummified and the vanilla bean ice cream scoop didn't melt on the way back. Besides the salad hair mishap, our service during this visit was really good.  I hope the tips people leave for Alex all goes to her.  Dunno how it works there.  Thanks for taking care of our table Alex although we sorta rushed the end of our meal. Beer lovers gotta try the Grand Cru before they run out!!!"
Precious C.,"Belmont, CA",210,6,7,3.0,9/21/2017,"I drove into Reno this morning to spend my birthday with family. We decided last minute to go here for a late dinner & celebration because it's one of the few restaurants that is open late. The service was good in the beginning but towards the end the server never asked us if we wanted any dessert or anything else before giving us the check. He just put the check on our table and walked away. Then he came back to ask for the pizookie flavors for the ones who had it included in their special meal and then I told him that it was my birthday and he said sure, what flavor? After all of that we got the desserts but mine had no candle on it :/ I wanted my night to be special but it's whatever until my dad asked for a candle for my half eaten pizookie. The service could've been better..."
James E.,"Grass Valley, CA",179,51,62,4.0,10/10/2017,"Fresh food, fairly quiet, great service and huge food selection. Prices are up a bit but pretty much worth it. Great selection of beers if you are into that."
Sharon C.,"Sparks, NV",1,1,,1.0,12/19/2017,I went to bj's today for my granddaughters 23rd birthday and was greatly disappointed!  There were 6 of us there. It took at least 20 minutes to get our drinks delivered after we ordered them.  The first dinner arrived. The next four dinners at least 10 minutes later. I was the last be be served another 10 minutes later. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken. The chicken was hot and delicious but the mashed potatoes and broccoli were ice cold!! Not planning on ever coming back! What a disappointment!!!
M P.,"Discovery Bay, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/3/2018,"I remember why I don't eat here every time I forget and go back. I took my daughters and their friends yesterday for appetizers and dessert as a celebration of my middle daughter's birthday. We waited for close to 10 minutes before the server came over to at all. We ordered waters and out food - mozzarella sticks and pazookies. The food came out and then half way through, we finally got our water. No one ever came back to check on us. My water glass sat empty for I don't know how long. It was finally refilled as we were trying to get our check to leave. We sat there for another 10 or 15 minutes and when I decided it may be faster to go to the hostess stand to try to pay our bill, the server came by, complained about how busy he was, and finally printed the check. The food was better than just ok and my army of pre-teen girls were having a good time, so I guess it wasn't all bad, but the service was so bad, it will probably be a long time before I go back."
Earnest G.,"Reno, NV",30,112,263,4.0,10/8/2016,"Very popular place, Fridays are packed after 5 pm. Reservations are recommended, With a reservation it took another 20 minutes before we were seated.  our server came right over took our drink order then our food order, He was very friendly.  Food is good and priced ok.  Again with the packed house it took a long time for the food to come out. The 7 of us enjoyed our dinner. My friends who  frequent BJs  often  commented on the smaller plates Especially the salad plates."
Wesley M.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,28,4,1.0,9/10/2017,"The food is great and the beer is better! The reason for the 2 stars is we went watch the first Sunday night NFL between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants. Awesome NFL season opener on Sunday! Got the seats at the bar in front of the big screen. Incredibly......NO SOUND!!! Didn't stay long enough to ask the Manger ""What the hell?"" BJ's in Vegas cranks all the games on all the house speakers! That's how you watch a marqee game! Instead they were pumping the same shitty music I've never heard of! Now, granted it's not labeled a sports bar, but it is a bar and if you want the men and women coming in to watch the games, give em some NFL! Well, it won't be us this year! We'll frequent another establishment that knows how to treat NFL customers!"
Rylie M.,"Reno, NV",111,45,2,4.0,8/15/2017,"Definitely one of my favorite chain restaurants! Service is always great and fast. I'm not a huge fan of chains so to love one is a biggy for me!  There was a definite Reno vibe here, with Reno decor everywhere. Made it feel more local.  Food is always good-- I tend to get a burger as I'm a huge burger fanatic! They have a variety of non-alcoholic drinks that are perfect for a young underage gal like me. The fries here are SO GOOD.  Can we talk about Pizookies??? A masterpiece, really. My favorite is the peanut butter s'more, as me and my partner always share!  I would definitely recommend BJ's to anyone. They have a wide variety of options and can fit any craving."
Miguel L.,"San Jose, CA",24,5,4,5.0,11/11/2017,"Super good place , service was excellent we couldn't ask for more I was visiting Reno and we decided to stop by BJ's restaurant and that was a great choice they were super busy when we got there but I don't know how they did it but we got sitting in less than 20 minutes patty our server was our super hero super server and the manager EDD come over to our table to check and make sure everything was ok .."
Griffin D.,"Santa Cruz, CA",71,27,15,3.0,12/4/2017,"Over priced? The thing is nothing here is great, some of the food is good, and mostly average. I'd rather find a local place if I were to go again. Service is quality though, and I got my first legal drink here."
Lindsay R.,"Reno, NV",108,84,89,3.0,1/26/2017,"I always come her for the pizookie! Tonight I also had the fish n chips and the sliders as an appetizer. BJ's is always a fun time. The atmosphere is always buzzing. Tonight I had an extra sassy waiter named Adrian. He was very attentive to my table's needs.  Bj's is overall average in terms of food. Everything I've ever ordered has been just good, but I feel a little reluctant to pay $15 for an entree there."
Dave B.,"Tahoe Vista, CA",135,85,73,1.0,3/4/2017,"One Star only because the service was great.  Wings were better than Buffalo Wild Wings.  My steak was burnt and over cooked. Not charred, burnt.  My Brussels sprouts were burnt. Not charred burnt My asparagus looked like a joke. Like they were dehydrated then cooked.  My son ordered boneless wings. They came traditional style with only 1/4 serving of ranch.  Will not be returning which is sad because I like their menu.  Whoever was working the grill needs to be fired. My 13 yr old son can cook just as good."
Amy P.,"Reno, NV",182,130,197,5.0,6/19/2017,"I'm a very patient person. Myself and two other friends just came here for pazookies (warm, freshly baked cookies served with ice cream). My friends and I were having a good time and didn't even notice that our pazookies were taking awhile, then the manager came and apologized that they were and said they were on the house. Great, caring service. Thank you for the complimentary pazzokie, BJs! All I had to pay for was my vanilla ice coffee, which was very seeet, so if you like sweet light coffee, I recommend."
Jacqui T.,"Sparks, NV",0,29,9,5.0,7/20/2017,I go to BJ's more than any restaurants.  Maybe once or twice a week.  It's kinda my fave since they have almost everything and everything is good.
Lindsey F.,"Reno, NV",159,113,88,4.0,7/15/2017,The Ahi Tuna salad is always a great choice. The salads are huge and definitely fill you up with a decent portion of whatever protein comes with it. The menu can be a bit overwhelming but you of course will find something that sounds good. Their brews are decently priced. We had an appetizer that was priced a bit high for what it was- the spinach and artichoke dip but it was good. No real complaints but it's a chain and not that memorable.
Devon T.,"Reno, NV",89,95,165,3.0,11/10/2016,"As far as chain restaurants go I am a big fan of this place. I have had the pleasure of eating at both Reno and Sparks location as well as the one at the Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento. So far I have found nothing on the menu that was anything less than perfect and that consistency (as well as the great customer service) is what keeps me coming back.  Why not 5-stars then? Because the menu keeps changing. It is an entirely different menu then the one I loved when they first opened their doors in Northern Nevada back in 2008 (Summit Sierra location). Some of the greatest items on that menu were cut (like the turkey club, which was perfection on a plate) and every time I go back there are a myriad of new things for their customers to try. While I am intrigued by their continual offer of new noshes, I am sad to see my favorite items leave the menu and never return. This should not keep folks from falling in love with this place though as it is one of my favorite haunts.  I'm not much of a drinker so I cannot speak to their bar's consistency. However, their hefeweizen is damn good. Give it a try!"
Evan G.,"Reno, NV",67,70,40,5.0,6/17/2017,"I'm not sure why it took me a long time to write a review for this BJ's as I come here pretty often, but I like the service every time I come and the food is consistently great. On busy days, you can expect to wait quite a while for a table, but most days it's not so bad. The menu is large and has something for everyone. Choosing what to get is pretty hard because the amount of options presented can be overwhelming (which is a good thing). I usually get a salad during lunch or something a bit heavier for dinner but no matter what you are craving it's a delight to enjoy the food here. Servers are always checking up on you and are very helpful. As for the quality of the food, I've never had any complaints because it tastes fresh and cooked just right. Definitely one of my go-to places for any occasion."
John P.,"Reno, NV",10,60,19,3.0,4/29/2017,"First off, you will not find friendlier, more professional servers than here. Kudos to management here for training this young staff, many who seemed right out of high school to be so focused on customer satisfaction, from hosts to bar to restaurant, all were excellent. Problems: I got on the app's preferred waitlist Friday night. It was still a long wait at the bar, and they text you when your table's ready. Mine were delayed for some reason (signal?) and 45 minutes later found I lost my place in line. The hostess said they recently got rid of the vibrating disks ""and we all hate the new system."" At the bar I paid $5.95 for a draft beer in a slim, smallish glass...plus the bartender shortchanged me more than an inch from the top (dark beer no head). The Mahi Salad ($15.95) entrees we ordered came with 5 small squares of mahi with no bread, one without dressing. Sad to say we left hungry. But with the servers' attitudes I still had a good time."
Geri G.,"Reno, NV",74,64,106,4.0,4/23/2017,Came here tonight with my parents. It's always good. The server was very friendly and accommodating. We got the guac and chips to start with. They definitely don't skimp on the avocados. Good flavor super fresh. We then shared a bacon cheeseburger and fish and chips. The fish was super flaky and had good flavor and the burger was huge.  Overall it was a good meal with lots of food. Easily enough for three adults and with some leftover to take home.
Josh K.,"Fernley, NV",1,36,15,3.0,10/21/2017,"Nothing to write home about... average food, good service. The bbq meat is not super impressive if you own a bbq. I bet a caveman would have been stoked to get some tho"
Tina D.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",28,32,78,4.0,8/19/2017,"Had a late night dinner with the hubby.  We orders chips and salsa as an appetizer. The salsa was very good wasn't real mild yet it was not real spicy, the guacamole was very good it was chunky which I really liked, very tasty. My husband order the prime rib was supposed to be medium rare, when he received his prime rib it was very very rare. He was not happy with it. I ordered a full rack of baby back BBQ ribs,  they were delicious, fell right off the bone. Also had the steamed broccoli and  very good. All in all the dinner was very tasty except for the prime rib, we did bring it home because of course you're not going to spend that kind of money and leave it behind.  Our waitress was very good, she was right on spot with seeing how everything was.  She told the manager about the prime rib and they offered to cook it some more.  We did not take them up on it we just took it home and cooked it more ourselve the next day.  Im sure we will return."
Les G.,"Sparks, NV",175,20,11,5.0,3/22/2017,"We had a great lunch...the Cauliflower tacos are fabulous!!! Our waitress Rachel was great, so helpful and friendly....Thanks Rachel!!!"
kari b.,"San Jose, CA",74,11,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Horrible service to even get seated.    We had a large party and they told us 2 hours even though they really weren't busy--maybe 3 couples in front of us.    We came back and decreased our party size and not only did we get the same 2 hours, but snarky eye rolls from the hostess and obvious whispers about us amongst the 4 people standing there.    Probably would have been better if at least two of the other people were actually looking to see where other customers were in their dining process to better give estimates on time."
