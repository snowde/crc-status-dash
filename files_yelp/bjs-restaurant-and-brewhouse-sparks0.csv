Maurice E.,"Sparks, NV",0,31,7,4.0,1/16/2016,A favorite spot for a beer or cocktail while you are enjoying half price tapas during happy hour. Good food.great prices
Beth H.,"Sparks, NV",6,16,25,5.0,8/1/2015,"Great experience at BJ's. Tracy and Zack (bartenders) are definitely on their game.  Despite being busy, Tracy is friendly, professional and willing to accommodate special needs.  Tracy always makes dining at BJs a very pleasurable experience. Food is top notch.  Thank you to Tracy for suggesting the perfect starter...I never would have ordered Brussels sprouts, but her suggestion was right on!"
Elizabeth R.,"Reno, NV",179,23,8,1.0,6/9/2016,"As I've been to this BJ's brewery many times, we decided to have our 4 year anniversary dinner here. We sat down by the bar and door to the kitchen. We ordered drinks and began looking at the menu. Moments later after receiving our drinks a blonde haired sever started antagonizing another server. We couldn't really believe what we where hearing while turning towards each other in aw. The yelling and mocking continued for the rest of our dinner. I've never felt so uncomfortable for myself or the workers around this blonde spiked haired server who ruined my 4 year anniversary dinner. I was very surprised a manager or anyone didn't stop this person from how rude he was being especially in front of customers."
Casey D.,"Sparks, NV",0,21,2,2.0,12/27/2015,Amazing food and excellent craft brew... But the service is some of the worst I've seen. So bad that I don't plan on going back anytime there's more than a few cars in the lot.
Freddy K.,"San Antonio, TX",0,114,13,3.0,7/4/2015,"Their menu is a 20 page book and all I wanted was a cobb salad....no luck!   The waiter dropped my order while delivering food to our party,  therefore,  I waited.   Management was nice and was proactive in comping my meal as I watched everyone eat theirs.   Its on the spendy side nothing wowed our party.  Meh."
Kate R.,"Reno, NV",14,7,1,5.0,12/15/2015,I am VERY picky when it comes to eating a meal out.... We WILL return to this place even though its aways from home....
Kimberly R.,"Fernley, NV",0,12,,5.0,7/5/2015,"From beginning to end it was an excellent experience. We arrived about 5pm, did not have to wait and the hostess was very polite and accommodating. Our waitress was one of the best we have ever had. We had a party of 4, myself, my husband, his father, and it 1 1/2 year old. Our appetizers and the baby's food was brought out very quickly, and there was enough time between the appetizer and the main meal. The food was good, nothing excellent, but everything was cooked food and was hot and fresh. The waitress brought us refills as soon as we needed them. Overall I was impressed and enjoyed the evening."
Jayme W.,"Chehalis, WA",29,42,16,5.0,8/3/2015,"Wonderful, original takes on pub food. Prices were reasonable prices and plenty of food! The desserts are amazing and unlike anything we have had. Our waitress was spread pretty thin but that may have been a one time thing. YUM"
April L.,"Sparks, NV",2,25,101,5.0,8/3/2014,"BJ's is my favorite hang out spot. I always sit at the bar and get excellent five star service from Josh, Tracy, and Jazi. I've very seldom been disappointed in my meal selections and have tried most of the menu, which is pages long with a wide variety of options that are reasonably priced. Definitely recommend ordering a Pizookie or Cobbler of any flavor for dessert. They offer great happy hour and lunch specials, as well as Half Off Wine on Tuesdays. The Beer Tasting Dinner is a must try!  It's scheduled every few months and the samplings are well worth the $30 per person price. BJ's Jeremiah Red is a great beer to try. Be sure to join the Premier Rewards Club to get rewarded. It's worth it."
Tom K.,Australia,0,4,,3.0,9/12/2015,"Ordinary service, decent flatbreads. Nothing special, but certainly not bad."
Andy M.,"Hayward, CA",371,187,115,4.0,4/19/2014,It is nice that they have a gluten free menu and a trifold pamphlet with allergy information so I could find something that was dairy free as well.  Get the gluten free pazookie! Yum.
James P.,"Reno, NV",0,19,,5.0,7/28/2015,"Gotta go with 4 stars! We (the wife & me) have discussed it many times, we've never had a bad experience there in 9 years of going to one or another stores. The staff is always up beat & courteous. Good food, beer & times!"
Kris H.,"Placerville, CA",10,17,1,2.0,3/26/2016,"We enjoy BJ's for their lunch specials and normally good service.  This time was a little different for several reasons.  My wife ordered an Iced Tea and it never came.  I received my food first, 3-4 minutes later my wife received hers.  5-6 minutes later my kids received theirs.  My wife had the all you can eat soup and salad, and they did not bring out both at the same time.  The soup looked like it had been sitting for several minutes in the bowl and did not taste good.  Her second salad had just a drizzle of dressing.  My son got carrots with his flatbread pizza but they were cut into circles (like what would be put in a salad).   Different people kept bringing the food out.  Both times my wife got soup they did not bring out a spoon.  One time it took 4-5 minutes for someone to bring her a spoon.  Maybe it was an off day for them, but we actually thought it was comical.   I would continue to eat at BJ's but not this particular one."
Tina M.,"Tremonton, UT",1,2,,2.0,11/21/2015,"We love BJs until we went to the one in Verdi, Food tasted ok, they brought out the wrong food for our friend, forgot the cheese for her sons burger then someone picked up my husbands $200 sun glasses then said they didn't have them. Someone is a thief and I won't ever give them our $ again."
Mary M.,"Encampment, WY",38,22,14,5.0,9/4/2015,This was my uncle's favorite restaurant and the night before his memorial service we brought a very large group of family to dine. The wait staff was overly gracious arranging tables to accommodate us. The food was large portions and the momsa was a nice chrisp drink to accompany my turkey salad. I completely understood why my uncle loved this place so much as the staff have hugs to my aunt as if she was their family.
Mitchell H.,"Sun Valley, NV",75,6,,3.0,9/12/2015,Very good food. One person in our party waited much longer than the rest for food and it came out wrong. Screw him though mine was good.
Virginia M.,"Reno, NV",193,146,18,2.0,12/20/2014,"Salads are already kinda disappointing. Even the good ones are basically lawn trimmings slathered in lard-sauce and salt. So a bad salad is like gas station coffee.  -That's also cold.  -That also has chunks of the grind floatin' around in there.  -That's also had a throat lozenge dissolve in the carafe.  So yeah, my salad was like that.  And it wasn't so much that the Cobb salad I ordered came with soggy ham. It's not so much that I care to think about how ham becomes soggy (not moist, mind you. Soggy. Picture Wonderbread in a puddle).  It's not even the fact that the tomatoes may as well have been red-colored tasteless jello bits. Or that they must've ran down to the just-closing Port of Subs for their bottom-of-the-pan lettuce trimmings/emptied shredder tray. Or that on top of all this tasteless wonderment, they drizzled a nice little wisp of still-tasteless dressing; enough to cover the one bite that I should've just stuck with. Or that this entire bowl of ""meh"" was hacked with a weed wacker til it resembled a rice pilaf. No, none of this is what really set me over the edge, my friends. It's the fact that I was already so hungry, and we were already running late for a movie, that I just ate the damn thing. Which is why I can now review this salad, albeit to my chagrin, with such accuracy.  if you're feeling the need to eat at the woefully named BJs, then please just trust me on this.... and skip the Cobb.  You're welcome."
Jennifer S.,"Sparks, NV",70,198,15,2.0,3/23/2015,"I used to eat at the Sparks BJ's all the time because I live so close.  I've only ate at the Reno location once.  When I ate at the Reno location I remember thinking the ambiance was nicer, the wait staff better and the food tastier but I never had huge issues with the Sparks location so I continued to go in. Of late however, my tune is changing. The wait staff is hit and miss.  Sometimes you get a great server and sometimes it is the opposite - spacey and forgetful.  It really depends on the day.   I teetered between 2 and 3 stars before finalizing my thoughts on this review and settled on 2 because ""Meh.  I've experienced better"" really reflects my feelings more than ""A-OK"".  This is due to a few recent experiences with wait staff and, suprisingly enough, the condition of the bathrooms. The first was when we went to BJ's for a sit down meal.  Afterwards we ordered a to-go for my son on a seperate tab.  They waited 48 hours to put my charge through. When I contact the store I received a call from the corporate office - I called them back and havent heard anything since then. Saturday night was the kicker.  We have never gone in for late night but we decided we'd like some real food as opposed to fast food.  We called ahead and sat at the bar.  Mind you - they are open until 1 a.m. I believe and we got in at 9:15 p.m.  It took the 2 bartenders quite some time to ask us if we would like anything.  We both ordered a beer.  I went to the restroom and it was a disaster area and out of toilet paper (see pics).  Once seated back at the bar I looked down and noticed a dirty knife on the floor (see pic). After while I decided I wanted another beer but the waiters were ignoring us.  They had already put our bill in a random shot glass in front of us assuming that's all we wanted.  I asked for another beer and the male server got really annoyed with me, got my beer, ripped away the old receipt and tossed the new one in the glass and walked away.  Wow....just wow.  We got our to-go order and left. Will I go back?  Of course I will.  It's the only sit down place of it's kind in a 15 mile radius of my house.  Will I enjoy the food?  I hope so.  Will I be excited?  No.  Will I ever go back for late night?  No way."
Mike S.,"Sparks, NV",604,179,15,4.0,11/14/2011,"BJ's is my go to place when someone else is driving.  NV police have no sense of humor about DUI and BJ's is damn serious about their beers and cocktails! I'm not a micro-brew guy, but they do pour the Guinness very nicely here.  When I want something different I have the Irish rootbeer...if you want something different, try it...home made rootbeer with jamesons, buttershots, etc....nice! Their food is good, too.  Seared ahi, fresh salads, grilled sandwiches, etc. I've never had a bad meal or a drink here, but it does tend to get crowded on weekends."
Sarra K.,"Sparks, NV",150,115,123,5.0,4/21/2015,I'm changing my review! The past 2 times I have come back since my bad review have been amazing! I think they have the best Asian chopped salad. I will definitely come back and I'm so glad that things have changed here.
