Laura P.,"Minden, NV",39,118,147,3.0,10/24/2015,First...my husband and I enjoyed the original BJs when they were only in So. Cal and the pizza was exceptional. Sadly...as with many restaurants that go to chain level...it is no.longer exceptional...but it is good. My kids love the Pazooki-awarm cookie with icecream and my husband and Iike the beer. Recently they added a salmon dish with veggies on quinoa that is amazing...but I worry it won't remain on the menu. The happy hour is good and they pour a hefty glass of wine.
MB B.,"Sparks, NV",9,26,2,1.0,3/18/2016,Thank you for your response. We placed a to go order. A medium pizza half sweet pig/half pepperoni. It was February 16th in the afternoon.  What we got was absolutely unacceptable.  We are truly surprised not only that a poor quality pizza came from your restaurant but the response after I posted a  friendly comment that should be used to improve the restaurants food quality.  Let's remember that we paid for that food we ended up throwing in the garbage.  Let me know if you have more questions.
Elizabeth M.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,1.0,12/4/2016,"If I could give NO STARS I would!! My husband took me for my 30th Birthday. It was awful.  The service was VERY slow. We waited at least 40 mins for flat bread nachos that were nearly burnt and mostly covered with lettuce.   I had Clam Chowder or should I say a salt lick as one of my sides. I also ordered the a slab of ribs. They weren't tender and didn't have much sauce. In the past, at other locations they've  been really good.  That's the whole reason we went. I was craving their ribs.  My husband ordered a pizza. Half of it had no sauce or cheese. No idea how that happened. We brought it to our waitress attention. She said ""it's cool, I'll get the manager."" And took the pizza. She had a I dont care attitude and acted like we were a inconvenience.   We waited 15 mins before she came back and told us they were working on another pizza.  I ended up sharing my food with my husband. I couldn't eat in front of him when he had nothing.  The 2nd pizza took a half hr. We told the waitress to have them box it for us. At that point my husband and I were full from my food. The manager FINALLY showed up with the 2nd pizza, apologized, said he felt bad and told us that he will speak with the kitchen staff so when we come back next time we shouldn't have any issues.  Seeing that it was my birthday lunch they offered me a free dessert. At that point I was extremely irritated and ready to get the heck out of there.  My hub told them not to bother and to bring the check.  Btw, We were there almost 3 hours, on a Sunday when it was slow.  NEVER AGAIN WILL WE BE DINING THERE! NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY."
Brian C.,"Reno, NV",291,182,262,5.0,11/13/2015,Love BJs! Love saying that because this restaurant has amazing food. Going for happy hour good after watching the new James Bond movie.
Nicholas L.,"Reno, NV",28,70,5,5.0,1/7/2017,"This is our go to place for a work lunch because it's close by, plus I've been here at least a half dozen other times over the last few years. And I've never had a meal that I wouldn't describe as, at a minimum, pretty darn good.   I'll just go through a few things I've had in lieu of doing a more general review: 1. Southern fried chicken.  It's awesome.  Crispy & juicy (boneless) chicken breast on top of mashed potatoes with some gravy and succotash.  They have a smaller portion for lunches vs dinner and I got the lunch portion and after eating half of it became extremely angry that I hadn't ordered the dinner portion.  It was damn good. 2. Late night burger.  Had this last week and it's listed as new on their menu and it was awesome.  Open face burger with chili verde and bacon and a fried egg?  Come on.  Chili verde is my jam and what I gauge every mexican restaurant on, and theirs was better than many.   3. Avocado egg rolls.  Super good. 4. Calamari.  Better than most.  I wouldn't say it's exceptional, but it's above average. 5. Spinach and artichoke dip.  Again, very good.   6. Ahi poke.  It's a bunch of good quality fish and nice ripe avocado.  I.e. it is lovely.   7. Clam chowder.  Very well done.  I've had worse at dedicated seafood restaurants. 8. Pizza.  Only had it once and it was the lunch sized (for one) ""gourmet five meat"" pan pizza.  Very good.  Good enough that I want to order one or two of their big pizzas even though they're not a pizza place. I honestly can't think of a single thing I'd fault them on.  Food is good.  Service is good.  Place is nice.  Things arrive quick when you're there for lunch and trying to get in and out.  In terms of ""American"" food, this is the place in Reno.  If anyone doesn't really like it they're probably being a picky assholomio. In terms of American food I guess Hash House would be the other big competitor in Reno.  Hash House to me is really more of a breakfast/lunch place though, whereas BJs isn't (since they're not open for breakfast).  Hash House has some great dinners too (I remember a duck dish that was killer) but in general BJs wins on variety and Hash House wins on quantity.  BJs probably wins on quality too, but I think it's pretty close.  Both have quality food."
Dave H.,"Truckee, CA",555,276,1327,4.0,11/22/2015,"I know it's a chain but the food is always good.  Great beer selection.  Only place that has westepha Lan Hef from Germany.  Had the ahi salad.  Texture of the fish was idd, hopefully fresh."
Kyle C.,"Reno, NV",51,54,,1.0,10/30/2016,Got the Carside to go. Food was cold and for a pretty penny I would expect much better. We were craving a good burger but didn't want to sit in the restaurant. Waitress that brought food out was not overly friendly just blah. We usually like BJ's but will never order to-go again.
Nicole F.,"Sparks, NV",0,16,,5.0,2/8/2017,"Great prices, great menu and the service I have had the last few times I was there- AMAZING- very courteous, very prompt- and the place is very clean. I highly suggest going to this place before catching a movie at the IMAX- makes for a great date night"
Kimberly D.,"Reno, NV",3,22,4,2.0,4/27/2016,"While 1 1/2 stars would be more appropriate, that is not an option, so rounding it up to 2 stars.  Came here recently with my mom and my niece  Service was pretty good, even though the waitress tried to get us to sign up for the diner program, despite us not showing interesting. The kid got chicken tenders, my mom got some breakfast meal (I cannot remember what it was), and I got caesar salad.  The kid loves her chicken, however, she barely touched this, as she claimed it was too dry and hard.  I took a sample bite of it, and the meat itself was tender, but there was way too much breading on it, to where it was very hard to bite through.  My mom complained that her potatoes were cold, and that the rest of the meal was very bland.  With me, the dressing was delish, however, there was way too much on it to where the lettuce was drowning in it. My mom and I did not bring the issues up to the waitress, as we didn't feel it warranted it, but all three of us were not satisfied with our meals.  It'll be a long time, if ever, that we come back.  IF we come back, it will mostly likely be just for the pizookie dessert, as that is always a win."
Brian A.,"Homewood, CA",0,16,7,5.0,11/28/2015,"We went in for the heck of it, super hungry and ready to chill out for lunch. I had a $4 bloody which was pretty good to start, then got a Caesar salad and the blackened blue cheese burger and fries with their ipa. All the food came out perfect and hit the spot as well as the bitter and hoppy ipa, loved it. My girlfriend also got a Caesar salad and the guacamole deluxe burger which looked ridiculously giant and delicious. She crushed every last bite of it and groaned at the sight of her last bite! Our bill was under fifty bucks and I had to undo the button on my pants when I got in the car. Super friendly staff that checked on us often and brought everything in a timely manner. Stoked on this particular one and will go back and try the guac deluxe burger for myself....yum"
Mary G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,23,19,4.0,6/20/2016,"Solid 4 review. Typical chain type restaurant. Never been to bjs before so I would say that bjs is a chain but ""higher"" than like say an Applebee's or chilis type ones. Clean bathrooms ( so important seriously !)  Food is chain typical.  Sat outside. Fairly quiet even tho it's high traffic and a nice peek of the distant mountains"
Brianna D.,"Reno, NV",115,42,23,5.0,2/15/2016,"Again, I try to avoid the reviews on chain restaurants but BJ's has a special place in my heart. I have a really bad habit of going to restaurants and ordering the same thing every single time but when it comes to BJ's, the entire menu looks delicious so it's one of the only places I venture out of my comfort zone and I'm never disappointed.  My parents and I go here every time they're in town, we always pick BJ's to have dinner. We typically start out with the calamari or the avocado egg rolls. (My mom does their rewards program and we got our appetizer for free on our last visit!!) My parents normally go for steak or fish and I normally try something different every other visit. Especially now that they expanded their menu! After going multiple times my top pick for the appetizer is the avocado egg rolls hands down. The dipping sauce they provide is amazing and its a good portion to share between the three of us. My top three choices for entrees is the California Club Flatbread Pizza, Seared Ahi Salad and the Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl.   Lastly, one of the best parts about going to Bj's...their famous pizookie. A delicious warm cookie topped with ice cream. I believe they have a mini size (free on birthdays), a regular size, or the option to do a pizookie ""pizza"" with a couple different flavors. I'm almost positive I've tried all the flavors over the years and once again, never disappointed. The triple chocolate is amazing as well as the red velvet and the pumpkin flavor (might be seasonal).    When it comes to the staff, I've always had very polite waiters/waitresses, the employees up front lack professionalism but regardless, I come for the food and with more choices on the menu than ever, I'm excited to continue going back!"
Jessica R.,"Sparks, NV",254,381,401,5.0,1/22/2015,"I must say the couple of times I went I really enjoyed my food.  I like ordering from the ""healthy conscious"" part of the menu because I'm TRYING to watch what I eat. So, I got chicken soft tacos.  I must say whatever cheese sauce they put on was  absolutely delicious. So savory. I enjoyed everything about my meal.  The restaurant itself is huge and when dinner time rolls around it's always poppin'. Poppin' like lines out the door poppin'. I suggest coming in at around 5. We were sat almost immediately. We ate around 6 and surpassed the crowd. It was nice!  I think BJs would be a nice dinner date spot before you head over to catch a flick at the theatre on the other side. It's ""fancy"" enough to say a nice dinner or might be a good place for a brunch/lunch work meeting, but causal enough to come as you are."
Susan A.,"Reno, NV",55,131,275,3.0,5/19/2015,"The reason why I gave BJ's a three star is because I had a very bad experience about four years ago with them. This time I decided to give them a second chance. The pulled pork sandwich was very good. It had been onion strings on top of the sandwich. It came with a side of barbecue sauce to pour on top of your pulled pork sandwich. I wanted to eat the whole thing but I was trying to save some room for dessert.  The dessert was phenomenal. It was like baked cookies with ice cream on top. We were able to choose our own flavor. I highly recommend getting the Pizookie.  As for the children's food, my son ordered mac & cheese. It wasn't that great; of course, it's stated it was from the kraft mac & cheese box. When trying it it tasted like it's been sitting for a while and has been warmed up. He did receive :-) potatoes to go with his meal. They were not like a usual potato (wedge).  As for the service, our waiter was very nice and respectful. Waiting on the food did take a little bit longer than a normal wait. But I do have to put in the consideration that they just build about 10+ tables at the same time they seated us.  Overall this was a very good experience considering my first experience with them. I may have to go back again!"
Taylor R.,"Sparks, NV",189,73,37,4.0,4/7/2016,"Their new derby cob salad is amazing. HUGE portions and the flavor of all the ingredients was fantastic. It was all fresh too. One of the people I went with had ordered boneless wings and I had tasted one of them, it was delicious! My other friend seemed to enjoy her Reuben sandwich as well. The service that night was (mostly) wonderful. The server answered our questions and was quick refill drinks and check on us. The women who were working up front looked annoyed and bored. They weren't very pleasant. I've noticed on most occasions I've gone there the people working up front are never very friendly.  I decided to update my review because I have been back there since and the food was better (though I still always tell anyone I go with not to order the pizza) and the service was better. I'll be going back again."
Bob S.,"Carson City, NV",48,36,4,1.0,2/3/2016,"I'm confused, at what point are there supposed to be 5 people working the front door and all of them looking at each other to decide who has to help out the customer?!? I went there with family from out of town, and we didn't get past the people at the front. Really, between the seven of us, we can come up with the money for the food! I promise! All we want to do is eat!!! I assume that the food is the same as every other location, which is great. We, however, cannot confirm, because we never got a seat!!!"
Miguel M.,"Auburn, CA",111,48,41,5.0,12/25/2016,"Visiting my sons for Christmas eve dinner on a cold as f@#k snowy night and needing a hot meal and a brew. BJs definitely came through with some delicious spicy Cajun jambalaya & a couple tall Jeremiah reds! Excellent service in the bar by a cute server watching the football game, and a great time had by all!! well played BJs. We'll be back!"
Drew R.,"Reno, NV",153,140,266,4.0,1/20/2015,"Four stars you may question and yes I know it's just a chain but hey, they've revamped and they are doing much much better!  I can say a few years ago BJ's, it seemed, had given up and were definitely in a full on downhill coast to monotony. More recently they have made drastic improvements and it is a welcome change.  The beer has always been very good so if you are into the microbrews, enjoy; now you can also return for the food. On this occasion, for my first time, I had one of the deep dish pizzas. Ermergersh! It was really really good. The Mediterranean Pizza had most of what you'd expect: chicken, basil pesto, feta cheese, and obviously a crust. What wasn't so obvious was the sliced pepperoncinis, the kalamata olives, and the roasted garlic. I must admit the garlic had the more subtle note but likely because I've fried my taste buds years ago with garlic: I mean to say I never met a garlic anything I didn't like, and moreover have literally spent days being told how badly I stink because of the garlic [fill in the blank] that I ate somewhere. The nice twist for me was that, as is the norm in pizza, they didn't make a point of leaving a huge crusty edge, but instead monopolized on every inch of real estate available and topped all of it with ingredients. Don't get me wrong the crust was really good and I do like my pizza crusts but it's also about the toppings and this was a delicious blend of ingredients.  I nearly forgot to mention this but even some of the appetizers are fun and a nice tweak. Who doesn't love a Frito boat? Well they've revamped the Frito boat with Frito nachos and it is appealing and yummy on that sophomoric (I'd like the captain crunch, please) level. I could only gripe slightly about consistency, as location seems to play a significant role in how the appetizer turns out; they're still pretty derned good.  In any event I sometimes yelpolaine that this or that restaurant is due for a menu revamp and gratefully BJ's beat me to the bitchosphere completing the process before I asked them to do so. I look forward to their continued progress."
Lori M.,"Milwaukee, WI",257,285,229,3.0,12/28/2014,"The word that always comes to mind is consistent.  We like to visit this restaurant when we are shopping at the outlets or taking our son to basketball practice.  The key here is to do call ahead seating because if there isn't a table open the wait can be long.  They have a very expansive menu with something for everyone (burgers, nachos, steaks ect.). The service is usually pretty good although we get better service at the south location.  Sometimes you can get an inattentive server BUT it has been getting better over the last six months. The food usually comes out quickly and is prepared well.  Good place to watch any sporting event with all of the televisions in the bar!"
Rachel B.,"Reno, NV",1,60,3,2.0,8/10/2016,"Here's the thing... BJ's is a chain restaurant, it's similar to going to Chili's or another similar place to eat. I think the mistake people make is going here expecting mind blowing brewery food, if you want that head to one of the local brewery's. That being said, if you are a fan of chain restaurant style food, they have pretty good food. Sometimes they are a bit of a hit or miss and if you go here in the evenings or weekend you should expect a hefty wait. I have easily spent 45 minutes waiting for a table. I personally do not find BJ's to be anything special. They are a pricy chain restaurant with decent food. They used to have a really delicious salmon Thai Salmon, it was around $18 (pricy) but the sauce was pretty delicious. They have since taken that off of the menu and I have not found any of their other salmon dishes to be anywhere near as good... especially with the accompanied price tags. I also find their customer service to be a little off point. I've had a mug of ginger-ale spilled all over my clothes by a waitress and received no compensation even though I was completely dripping in ginger-ale and I also had another waitress argue that my ID was not real and once another waitress confirmed my ID was in fact real, she brought back drinks that were clearly non-alcoholic cocktails.  Just not a fan..."
