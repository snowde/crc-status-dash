Rachel W.,"Sparks, NV",296,12,30,4.0,5/22/2015,"I kind of wish they could do 3 1/2 stars but I'll bump it up to 4 because I think their attentiveness was very nice. The waitress was a bit forgetful at times but I didn't think it made my experience worse. The atmosphere was great and it could be good for causal or a first date type of place.  Personally, I really only wanted calamari and wings, which are both appetizers. They were both average in taste, with the calamari being a bit too crispy, but good for ""bar food."" My friend had a brewhouse burger and it was very good according to him.  Lastly, we saved room for dessert with the Pizookie Trio which was fantastic. I love the concept and the taste solidified that love. Neither of us are intense sweet lovers so the trio was a bit overwhelming but I loved the crunchiness and the moist middle. We had the salted caramel (my favorite), cookies and cream (his favorite) and the chocolate chip."
DeeAnn R.,"Sparks, NV",53,21,30,4.0,8/1/2016,"Two moms and four preteens enjoyed a very nice lunch.  Before the meal was ready a server brought out garlic knots and fruit cups for the starving kids.  We got just what we ordered, and received excellent service."
Jeff N.,"Reno, NV",0,18,5,1.0,8/5/2016,I get emails every few days for $10 off using my rewards card. Took my family to dinner on 7/28 about 3:30PM.  Told them I wanted to use $10 off.  Got receipt for $54.00 left $68.00. On the way home I realized after adding up everything the receipt did not have the $10 taken off even though my rewards account shows the points being used for it. I am not sure if the waitress was scamming and got a $28 tip or what. I sent an email to BJ's and received no response. I called to speak with the manager and got left on hold for 10 minutes so I had to hang up and call back. I spoke with a manager 4 days ago who was supposedly going to look into it and take care of it. I have heard from nobody. It's too bad the food at this place is fairly decent but the service sucks!!
Shavondra H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,10,,5.0,11/3/2016,"Greeter was great and made us laugh when seating us! Waitress was on point with taking order, friendly, and checked on us in good increments. Food was awesome! Highly recommend the calamari and the Bazooka"
Kasey C.,"Reno, NV",0,2,,5.0,4/9/2017,"Recently, I went here for my friend's birthday dinner. There were 3 of us and we each ordered a burger and asked for something to not be on it, ex pickles, jalapeños. When our burgers arrived, we all had the item we asked not have on it. It wasn't a big deal as we all just pulled it off the burger. When our server asked how everything was doing, we informed him just to make sure the cooks don't mess up anyone else's orders. He said he would let the manager know, who then talked to us shortly after and apologized for the mistakes. When we received our bill, the manager had comped all of our burgers! We were all so surprised because the mistakes really didn't bother us, but we definitely appreciated the kind gesture given from the manager to make our experience better."
Tracy C.,"Sparks, NV",132,99,132,3.0,6/29/2016,"The  service here always sucks! I've waited tables and my expectations are reasonable considering I'm aware of every mistake made and that the service here is slower than Molasses in January!  Every time,  for years,  either location, horrible service!  I've come to expect it! As for the food, they have a pretty big menu which is nice when you don't know what you want or you have a group that can't decide where to go. Me and Mom shared the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, mediocre at best, PF Changs are way better. Deep Fried Portobello Strips, I liked these alot. I love mushrooms, and these were nice and crispy, not too much batter, not overcooked, and the aoli dipping sauce was decent. Then we shared the California Chicken Club, nice grilled flavor on the chicken, bacon was nice and crispy, but man, the top piece of sourdough was completely soggy! I still tipped our server 20%, cause I'm a sucker like that. At least he was nice and kept up the tradition of slow, crappy service at BJ's."
Julie B.,"Fallon, NV",0,2,,5.0,4/23/2017,"Friendly staff, great ambiance, tasty beer, I will definitely return! We had the fried calamari, brisket burger and a late night burger; the burgers were amazing!"
Megan A.,"Sacramento, CA",18,30,16,4.0,9/13/2015,"I've been to this location a few times and the one in Reno a few times - this one is better. It's a chain, you know what to expect. They have a huge menu and there's something for everyone. The food is good. Not spectacular, but solidly and reliably decent.  My most recent visit was for my friend's birthday. We told our server (I believe her name was Tessa, she was awesome) about that and my friend was brought a birthday Pizooki at the end of our meal, that was cool. The service has been pretty hit or miss. Thursday was great, the hostess was nice, Tessa was great, and the other staff who helped bring out our food were all pleasant.  The restaurant is comfortable, the food is good and the portions are huge - good place overall, especially for large groups. They do a good job accommodating huge groups of people and the menu is big enough that everyone will find something they like.  Nothing too special but never a bad choice."
Jasmine O.,"Sparks, NV",30,67,53,3.0,1/13/2016,I have mixed reviews about this place the first few times I have been there the food was delicious an the service was good but the last time I went not so good I ordered some burger an I never in my life had a burger that was so dry. Idk if it was a one time thing but I have yet to go back after that.
Peter K.,"Spanish Springs, NV",167,545,1769,4.0,12/23/2014,"I had the bison burger. I thought it might be dry,the flavor was amazing. I also had the chicken tortilla soup, love the way they serve it,and the flavor is fantastic"
Chris M.,"Reno, NV",0,13,,1.0,2/5/2017,"OMG, THE FOOD WAS SO BAD! This is why I don't go to chains, nobody cares about putting out a good product. Got the Mediterranean pizza pretty sure there was a cup of salt used to make it. Next we had the pepperoni extreme pizza. Asked for light sauce, apparently that means no sauce as well as no cheese. This was a great pizza place lived by the original and loved it. Once they go to huge chains, the food goes to shit. Never again will I eat here. Unless it is for a pazooki, that was good."
Salma A.,"Sparks, NV",227,38,277,3.0,8/12/2015,"BJ's and I have a love/hate relation. I've always liked this place because of the great variety of food they have. They also have a great variety of drinks. I always like it here, but my last 5 experiences haven't been good.  I notice the place is a little desorganized. The servers don't know who they are serving, they get confused all the time. They forget to bring what you order. There is always someone binging something to your table and asking if that's what you order. It's just crazy!!  The quality of the food went down but know is going up again. When I go there I normally get clam chowder, one time they served it cold and it totally ruined it. I love their burgers and their french fries. I also like their fried chicken and mashed potatoes. The deep dish lasagna wasn't very good last time I had it. It was cold in the middle and had a weird taste.  The last time I had ribs... I think those were the meatless ribs I've ever had.  The only reason I come here is because it's close home, their drinks are great! My favorite is the famous watermelon mojito. That drink is a bomb!! I love it!! I also come here a lot because of their pizzokie. Oreo pizzokie yum!!   I will continue  to come here and get annoyed with the bad service until they stop making good watermelon mojitos and pizzokies.  Hopefully they will get better so that I can update my review."
Joe R.,"Reno, NV",25,102,287,4.0,9/20/2013,"If your looking for a chain restaurant with a wide variety in menu items, tasty food, great beer and good service, check out BJ's! I had the chicken a la fresca which was portioned very well and filled me up without feeling I ate too much! Our server 'Season' was attentive and very professional. Check it out when you are in Sparks or S. Reno."
Izzy D.,"Sparks, NV",8,19,58,4.0,7/21/2014,"Great Atmosphere whether at the bar, a booth, or a table. Gets packed but not too crazy. My FAVORITE is the Cajon Pasta. Haven't really tried anything else lol but every time I'm here that dish is on point! Calamari was meh, not very crispy and you don't get too much. Beer selection is great. They have plenty on tap as well as some in house beers. It's a bit pricey, but an overall good place to come have dinner or a few drinks with people."
Bunny R.,"Carson City, NV",0,23,5,3.0,2/1/2016,"Josh is a great bartender. We ordered entrees and I guess because my husband's lunch took longer to prepare, my chicken tacos were cold when they arrived."
Teresa F.,"Reno, NV",0,15,4,5.0,2/17/2017,"It was Valentine's day and my daughter had volleyball practice near this location.  We live in Reno, but were caught with driving to volleyball practice at 5:30 pm and again at 7:30 pm for pick up. We decided to eat at BJ's near the gym since we would be on limited time. I called in the morning to ask about calling ahead or putting our name in as we had a very short window to eat and get back to the gym for pick up. The staff member who answered at 8:30 am was very pleasant and explained we could call an hour early or download the BJ'S AP to put our name on the list in the early evening.  When I went to hang up he said, ""You know what, it's Valentine's day- I'll take your name now.""  He made my day!!  We showed up at 5:40 (late)  and were seated withing 10 minutes! Our dinner was great! We love the gluten free pizza and the Twisted BLT salad. A glass of wine and we were out of there just in time to pick up my daughter from practice, yet we had a pleasant and un-rushed meal. Thank you BJ's and to the employee who took our name early as a favor! Plus our waiter was top notch, we commented to each other several times about how great he was."
John H.,"Sparks, NV",98,113,46,4.0,9/29/2015,I like this place. I love the Enlightened menu!  Everything I have tried yummy in my tummy:). The staff is always really nice. The host can sometimes act a little put out they have to seat you. Worth it once you get the food. Servers are always really friendly and helpful. A little slow at times but good place to have lunch. They offer a large assortment of craft beer as well !
Adrianna G.,"Reno, NV",32,23,7,2.0,3/24/2016,"So... They took the Scampi Pasta off the menu, I thought about leaving, but my husband was much too excited for a avocado egg roll. We stayed; I ordered the Deep Dish Ziti. I now wish I would have stayed home and ate frozen lasagna, I'm certain it would have tasted better. Dessert? No thank you, I've had enough disappointment for one night."
Krissy T.,"Carson City, NV",0,9,,5.0,8/15/2016,"This was our first time visiting a BJ's anywhere, so we weren't sure what to expect... It was around 3 in the afternoon and on a Monday, so there was immediate seating. Jared was our server and he was PHENOMENAL! Better than you could possibly imagine what you would want in a food server. Attentive, our drinks were never empty, super informative and helpful... JARED ROCKS!   Then there's the food, which was a whole other level of AWESOME! We ordered a lot and everything came out perfect.  While we were there, we signed up for their free rewards program, and we will absolutely be back! Sooner rather than later if I can help it! GREAT JOB GUYS!"
Mimi G.,"Reno, NV",4,37,28,5.0,12/9/2015,"Great visit! Server was great, food was delicious. Wasn't crazy that my soup and salad came before appetizer....which came at same time as Mom's food. But all in all yummo!"
