Rachel S.,"Reno, NV",79,124,68,5.0,7/25/2014,"I know this is ""just a chain"" and it's totally uncool to love chains but up yours, I LOVE BJ's. Every time we've been, our meals have been fantastic, the service quick and friendly, and the beer delicious (the hef, oh my. I'm in love.) My kids shovel the fried calamari appetizer into their faces at top speed- it is really some of the best I've had. I enjoy the ahi poke appetizer along with a side salad as a meal, it's perfection. The fish tacos are also superb, as is the bison burger, the fried artichoke appetizer, and the stuffed mushrooms. I will continue to go back and work my way through the menu."
Greg T.,"Reno, NV",9,19,1,4.0,11/22/2015,Food is consistently good!  Service is back and forth---sometimes excellent.  Sometimes sub par.
Amy Q.,"Reno, NV",710,205,116,4.0,6/8/2015,"The hostess are always so friendly at this location and accommodating. There is usually always a line to get into this restaurant and most places, they are usually stressed when it gets busy, but the hostess here are calm and even have small talk when they seat you. Whoever is hiring is doing a great job in hiring people with nice customer service skills. This includes their waiters/waitresses.  With such a busy restaurant, they always check up on the table, offer refills, and sometimes the kitchen will get backed-up, but the food comes out piping hot. I didn't give it a 5 stars because there wasn't anything that went above & beyond my expectations while dining out. I highly suggest being part of the BJs Premier Rewards program that is free. I tend to always get $10 off coupon in the email at least once a month, which is nice and score a free pizookie on my birthday. My favorite things to order here are the Avocado Egg Rolls, California Burger, the BJs favorite deep dish pizza - the crust is a soft/breadstick buttery type of dough, and the Fish Tacos with Fried Mahi Mahi."
Rob H.,"Sparks, NV",1,23,,1.0,7/3/2016,Very poor service.  Waiter forgot drinks the brought to managers attention he acted as though he could careless. Finally after complaining we got our drink order.   Usually great service with lunch group. This was horrible.
Abbieh N.,"Sparks, NV",2,40,2,3.0,5/25/2016,"Been here many times and also many other 30+ BJ brewery restaurant in the greater Phoenix area. In this one seems more packed than the others but I guess that's what happens when you open in a small town such as ours. Standard bar, Cheesecake Factory, diner food, the only thing that stands out to me is there beer and the pazzokie which is a cookie cooked in a pizza pan. Either of which I can't get enough of."
Troy R.,"Sparks, NV",58,4,3,5.0,7/14/2016,"After leaving another restaurant on our 24th anniversary because of poor service, BJ's redeemed our night.  Shawn was an excellent waitress.  Gave a wonderful drink recommendation, a free pazookie and was very pleasant.  The potatoes and ribeye were delicious."
Rachel F.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",119,75,56,4.0,4/26/2015,BJs is always put go to spot for good beer and food. The bartenders are really friendly and they are always showing sports on TV. Good atmosphere and people!
Brontee G.,"Reno, NV",87,33,18,4.0,2/28/2016,"I went with a friend to grab a quick bite to eat and I was surprised at the many healthier alternatives they offer on the menu. The service was excellent and the waiter was attentive throughout the meal. I had the roasted Brussel sprouts dish and I did not expect it to be so tasty. Honestly, it was so delicious and full of flavor that every time I go I make sure to order it!! You are also able to order the Sriracha sauce on the side of you choose."
Dennis N.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Waitress decided to serve 2 raspberry vodka tonics instead of what was ordered. Who asked me?Ordered potato skins and ended up w/cross contamination! Uh, don't think so! Uh, not into food poisoning!  What else goes on behind kitchen doors?  Will not be back!!"
Ted R.,"Lodi, CA",58,527,182,4.0,8/30/2015,We have been coming to this BJ's the last several years during hot August night. I always get the beef dip sandwich with one of their many fine beers. My wife always enjoys the individual pizza. We will be back next year again.
Deric N.,"Sparks, NV",7,2,,1.0,1/19/2017,"my family,friends and I (party of 6) went there Saturday night,had done ""call ahead seating"" too and waited over an hour and a half and still didn't get seated. The staff and Manager have NOT A CLUE how to run a restaurant, by far THE worst experience I've ever had! Waitresses in the bar were rude and pushy and the hostess is clueless beyond belief (I guess everything takes 20 minutes,20 minutes) I couldn't tell you about the food since we couldn't get any. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone! Perhaps a reservation system may help the problem after they FIRE the entire staff. Good Luck"
Sarah S.,"Reno, NV",369,434,674,4.0,1/23/2016,"After catching a movie at IMAX, we were starving and decided on BJs since it's so close by. I've been to other BJs locations, but never this one. Honestly, I'm usually not a fan of chains like this, but I've never had a bad experience at any location I've been to and I've never had a bad meal. It's not my first choice, but in situations like this, I don't have any problem eating there. One thing I didn't know that they did was offer guest brews on their taps. So, there happened to be a beer brewed by Great Basin on tap, in addition to some California brewers, along with BJs beers. I thought that was pretty cool.  On this most recent visit, I decided to stay a little healthy and not order a gigantic hamburger. The Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos called my name, and even the side of grain salad sounded great too. Of course we ruined any health benefits of that by ordering the southwest egg rolls (seriously, I love these things and I love the chipotle dip that comes with them - such a guilty pleasure). The tacos were nicely stuffed, they didn't really skimp on anything and there was plenty of sauce to add to both of them. I loved all of the flavors and would definitely get it again. The disappointing part was the side salad. Kind of lacking in flavor and majorly lacking in portion. I think they gave me *maybe* a ¼ cup. I could see the bottom of the dish, like it was kind of just smeared around to appear like I had more? I don't know. I made up for lack of grain salad by stealing the addicting shoe string fries off my boyfriend's plate. Service was quick and were didn't feel rushed out of there. We sat and enjoyed a second beer after our meal without feeling like we were taking up precious table realestate. I know we'll back in the future, not necessarily this location, but I know we'll find generally the same food, service, and beer in all of the locations."
Jay E.,"Reno, NV",84,50,1,4.0,3/29/2015,"Consistently good food, with just the right portion sizes, and a great location. When I'm in the Reno area, this place is always of the list of must-visits.  There house-crafted sodas are amazing. Root Beer, Vanilla Creme, Orange Creme, and Black Cherry. All of them are amazing, with unlimited refills, and the ability to switch between them. I can never resist. The best part is they come to the table in a great mug, and there is usually a small layer of little icy particles on top. It is the perfect soda experience to compliment all of their food. The deep-dish pizza is a regular go-to, if you haven't had it before. It has great crust, and even better sauce. I would always recommend a pizza for first timers.  My main difficulty here is that they are always so busy. Plan to wait a minimum of 30 minutes, pretty much any dinnertime that you go. More on weekends."
David C.,"Reno, NV",79,15,23,4.0,5/7/2016,"I used to frequent this joint for work however i really never could enjoy a beer, However the last time I went I had the most amazing Mediterranean Chicken Tacos and more IPA. Always busy and never disappointing. I will be back to this place as well. If only it was sunny outside the day I went because that's the only thing that would have made it better was to sit outside. Service was impeccable. I wanted for nothing, but more conversation with the friends."
Jay S.,"Reno, NV",86,87,23,4.0,7/2/2014,"Came here a night before my birthday (seems to be tradition).  I called in ahead knowing it was going to be busy. Lady said it doesn't guarantee a table but will reduce wait time... So now I'm thinking alright, probably a 10 minute wait.  Got there, no wait and was sat down immediately? Not busy on a Tuesday night I suppose.  By the way, I'm starting to slowly go dark beers so this time I ordered Jeremiah Red, and wow, so good!!! I ordered a small Chicken Bacon ranch pizza and my buddy ordered Classic Combo. Food took longer than usual on a slow night... Maybe took so long because I was a bit buzzed from the brew. Service was good, not great though."
Lauryn P.,"Reno, NV",124,16,4,5.0,5/18/2016,Love this place! It is my boyfriend's and my go to place! Must have their honey crisp chicken salad!
Jen B.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,2.0,6/11/2016,"Food was bland and uninspired, but edible.. Worst part was our server was clearly ill. Great service but it was hard to enjoy watching our faint looking servers hands shaking holding our plates, and sweat beading up on his face, so.gross. We asked him if he was okay and told him to take his time and that he looked sick and he sheepishly said he would be okay. My husband told him maybe you should have another person take the orders and go home before he fell over and he said he was sorry and he had attempted to stay home and was denied. What kind of resteraunt forces admittedly sick people to work... The last thing you want are ill people handling your food. Now we as customers have to fear contracting illness because we were unlucky enough to have chosen bjs for our dinner. Sorry to rant but it was really bad. If thats how they run the staff I would hate to see the kitchen."
Tj E.,"Sun Valley, NV",1,4,,5.0,6/6/2016,"I have been here twice.  The first time, I had a pizza - delicious.  The second time, rib-eye steak - absolute perfection!  My sister had the salmon and it was divine.  The menu may be huge, but that just means there's enough variety that you can visit more often and still have new things to try.  Next time, I'm getting the salmon.  On our visits, the wait staff were attentive and pleasant and we had a very enjoyable time.  And their beer?  I live!  It's everything."
Emilie Z.,"Sparks, NV",119,43,13,4.0,6/8/2014,"Always good food and friendly staff.  We always grab seating in the bar area, just my hubby and me.  The bar tenders are always quick and friendly to talk to.   We like the Great White pizza, any of their salads or pastas, and the pizzokies are amazing! We have been there over 50 times I'm sure and the only time we had bad/slow service was this weekend.  The manager was quick to comp us an appetizer, that was a very nice gesture.   The menu can feel like overload when you first visit but you really can't go wrong.  Definitely a good place to stop by when near the new IMAX, Target, or the outlet mall/Scheels."
Lauren t.,"Sparks, NV",48,22,10,2.0,7/16/2015,"I love the food here, but the service is beyond horrible every time I come here. I always end up waiting. Even when I try to plan ahead and order online to pick up by a certain time they are still beyond slow."
