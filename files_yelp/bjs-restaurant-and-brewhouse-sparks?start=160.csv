Paul S.,"Reno, NV",1125,965,5321,4.0,4/2/2012,"March 31, 2012 Saturday - dinner 5:30 PM 1 adult and a child Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Service - 4 stars Background - Been to several BJ's locations before and they all have the same cookie cutter feel.  I have never been to this location Atmosphere - Just the reverse layout of the Reno location, walk into this place and the bar is to the left while Reno's is to the right.  Biggest problem was the doors, it was very windy day, and they only have you walk through on set of them which does not control the exterior temperature entering the place.  So every time that door opened we got a cold breeze.  Finally about 6 the waiting area was packed enough to block that breeze.  Food   Appetizer - none order.   Main Course - I went with something new, outside my box for BJ's.  I had the fish tacos, breaded as that is how I had fish tacos the very first time.  These were not the fisherman on the box fish sticks.  Each piece was unique in size and shape, the two tacos each had to two bread Mahi tuna chunks in them.  The tuna was topped with a zesty slaw.  The plate had some so so colored tortilla chips.  They gave you two square cups, one salsa which was pretty mild and the other was a very thinned out guacamole.  Both were very bland.  A spoon to serve to apply to the tacos would be nice, but I guess I could have just picked them up and poured them where I want it.   Dessert - My daughter had the Pizookie, I did not have any has she was fitting off a cold.  But it was less than 2 bucks on the kids menu and it makes her really happy getting it. Service - We were greeted before we were all they in the door.  She asked if we wanted a kids menu, I said yes.  We were seated immediately, but without the kids menu.  I asked for a kids menu after realizing he did not bring one.  The nonverbal queue was it was such a trauma.  I hate to see if we sat in the back of the restaurant, but we were the closest to the hostess stand.  I was waitress was good.  My office gave us mystery gift cards, you do not know how much is on them until you bring them in.  I brought in two use, figure I would only use the bigger one but the waitress used both, excellent! Future - Sure if I am in that part of town"
Elizabeth P.,"Sparks, NV",1,45,10,1.0,3/4/2016,"So here I sit thinking how can a company that has such great food keep allowing such low quality service ??  Last night a group of 4 of my family sit down to dinner .  It's about 10 till 7 . Happy hour is over at 7 .  When the waitress comes to our table I ask her what's the specials for the happy hour ? .  She responses by looking at her watch and telling me I have 8 minutes to order .  Wow !  Was this Like a huge red flagging saying Warning , Warning , Will Robinson ?? ( yes I'm old and those who remember Lost In Space will get it ) .  I explain that is not what I asked I wanted to know the menu specials .  She tells me and  leaves . Comes back for our order and when my soup is delivered a bit later I ask for Tabasco .  She leaves the table with everyone at the table confused ... Did she hear me ? There was no response of sure no problem or just a minute . But she did come back with some .  We ordered the avocado eggrolls.  If you have never had these they are super awesome !  Along with our other menu items .  When she comes back we have not only our appetizers but our main dishes too .  All at the same time .  I asked her why is the appetizer with our meal ? She tells me well you didn't say anything different . I said well I just figured it was implied the appetizer would come before the meal .  Guess I was wrong on Assuming that .   But the 30 plus times before when I have visited must have been a mistake ?   Yes , I'm still not happy because it only gets worst .  At this point , I leave the table go outside and call for a manger on the phone .   I am on hold for 9 mins . I have the cell phone records to prove it . 9 mins for a manger ? So after 9 mins I walk back inside and tell the lady answering the phone I'm still on hold and would like to talk to a manger .  One arrives , then second one . Explain what has happened from the moment I sat down .  Oh by the way my two kids ordered kids meals and did finally get their drinks after they had both eaten their meals .  So manger says he will take care of things . Takes off the $7 avocado eggrolls And a $5 kids meal . I am  appalled that with this lack of Professional service , both from the waitress and the manger staff with the handling of things . My own food was cold , since I had to wait over 10 mins to talk to a manger .  My kids had no drinks with their meals , my waitress was rude , unprofessional and lacking in her skills as a server .  I missed out on eating with my family .  So thank you BJs for taking that whole  $12 off my meal .  I guess my time lost , cold meal , no drinks and a rude waitress  is worth $12 . As I waited outside for a manger to answer the phone I could see both Olive Garden and the outback .  Both restaurants that seem to know what service is .  Maybe someone higher up the manger chain will care ."
Roberta C.,"Sparks, NV",17,6,17,3.0,5/3/2016,"What is it with this place? Been coming here for a year and have been disappointed almost every time. The only reason we come is because the food is good. The guest service is not acceptable . Can't the servers even comb their hair before coming to work? That's just nasty when your server is not well groomed. And there's a lot if standing big around . Been going to BJ's many years and this is the only one where we have been disappointed in the service. We actually waited 39 minutes to get our food . Oh well , I keep hoping they will improve."
Alyssa S.,"Reno, NV",64,102,255,3.0,2/7/2015,"My husband and I have been frequently dining at this location for a few years now pretty regularly. The food is always good, not great but consistently good and the service is usually hit or miss UNLESS you get Nick. Nick is such an attentive server who remembers your preferences, has a great personality and makes fantastic recommendations. I can't quite put my finger on why the Reno location has better tasting food and consistent service. It seems like we wait awhile for our dishes every time as well. Either way, Bjs is great due to the fact that they have a large selection on their menu so everyone can enjoy something."
Jeff K.,"Reno, NV",8,12,1,3.0,1/7/2015,"More like a 21/2. I had heard the grilled Kale & Brussels sprout salad was outstanding and the description sure sounded good but the result was something completely different. The service was quick on a busy Saturday night but the salad had no grilled kale or Brussels sprouts! It was a regular salad with the walnuts & grapes only, WTF?I sent it back and it came back with cold sprouts and no kale. I complained to the manager told him he had problems in the food prep and he took it off my bill. He offered to have it redone correctly but no way was I going to do that plus we were running out of time. had popcorn at the movies for dinner! I was pretty disappointed, we have always had good service at the BJ's at the Summit Mall. maybe I will order the grilled Brussels sprout and kale salad next time we are there."
Stephanie B.,"Saratoga, CA",35,37,36,3.0,4/6/2016,"I love bjs. Typically. The food is always pretty good. I've had their calamari, stuffed mushrooms, Mediterranean deep dish pizza, and some pastas. They're always good. Of course the pizzookies are where it's at. Actually I usually only come here to get their black cherry handcrafted soda. That stuff is worth the trip alone. Especially when they bring it out in the freezing cold mug. Yummm. Anyways. This particular location has slow service. I get you wanna give us time to enjoy our food, but with my toddler I kinda just want it a bit quicker. But it's usually a good experience"
Suzie L.,"San Jose, CA",169,21,19,3.0,6/24/2014,"Went here today with boyfriend for lunch. We were surprised that it was crowded for a Monday lunch, there was about a 10 minute wait to be seated. When we actually got seated though, service was incredibly slow! Waited another 10 minutes before our server greeted us and took our drink order. We decided to order our whole meal, including the Pazookie dessert judging from how long the service was taking.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a Cesar Salad and boyfriend ordered The Brewhouse Burger. Food was delicious, but we there was a 25 minute wait for our food. They even forgot my to bring out my salad first, so I had to ask for it when the entree came out.  Pita Tacos were great! The pita bread went extremely well with the mixed Greek tastes inside, which was chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes and it came with a side of quinoa mixed with corn and other deliciousness. My boyfriend's burger came out perfectly medium rare with the bun just utterly so crisp and them shoestring fries, mmm.  After our meal, there was another 20 minute wait for the Pazookie. If you've never had a Pazookie in your life, I recommend trying it before you die. A freshly baked warm cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla that melts right in our mouth! We got ours half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia nut.  Our server also forgot to refill our drinks a few times, we had to ask her twice.  Service could have been better, food was great, restaurant is in an awesome location as well. Right next to the outlets, so you can walk off your meal afterwards by shopping or fill up your stomachs after a long day of shopping!"
Ralph W.,"Panama City Beach, FL",1,5,2,1.0,10/22/2016,Had dinner there tonight was very disappointed. Was told when we arrived it would be 15 min asked if I was a reward  costumer and we waited 30 min or more. When seated they put us in a booth I am not a small guy you should never put some one my size in a booth. We order drinks and appetizer and dinner at one time that was a mistake it all came out at the same time. I guess our waitress was not smart enough to spread them out was trying to make things easer on her ordering at one time seeing that it took her 15 min after our drinks were order to get them to us. Dimmer came and my wife said that her hamburger was good she asked how mine was and I told her it was cold not ice cold but not piping hot either. She said that her fries were not hot either. All the time our waitress is standing at the server station she never comes over and ask how our dinner was she must have know how long it had set up there the appetizer was hot and ok the boneless wings I had the jambalaya. All in all a very lousy meal. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
C P.,"Reno, NV",0,9,,2.0,11/13/2016,"Party of 6 was told a 40 minute wait for dinner.  50 minutes later, was told that there was at least one other party of 6 before us.  At 65 minutes, staff brought out a platter of pizza for the 30+ people waiting out front, and still one party of 6 before us.  Too little, too late.  Should be more communicative with customers about waiting.  So we said screw this, and went to Cantina instead...Cantina was no wait, bar seating, immediate service, and great food."
Tabitha E.,"Reno, NV",228,282,1107,4.0,11/6/2015,"I actually received a response the same day, about 3 hours after my email from the Sparks manager. He handled himself extremely well and I appreciate his response tremendously. He offered to train the servers on helping customers make a more cost conscious choice, as well as offering me a gift card (which I wasn't expecting anything like that when emailing my comments in). And while it has definitely changed my abrupt opinion from yesterday, about basically never returning. And I know the specific locations do not set the prices, the higher prices are, unfortunately, something I will remember in the future. Good to know the customer service is there, and something I wanted to notify readers. They are very responsive as a chain, which is impressive."
Teresa B.,"Sparks, NV",1,4,,4.0,4/29/2016,"We had dinner with my husband's coworkers, their families and the service was great. Our server was great and she kept coming by to check on us. The food was great (I had the brisket and bacon burger) and unfortunately we were all too full for dessert."
Nicole K.,"Santa Monica, CA",34,40,13,1.0,11/13/2015,"I like BJs, as far as chain restaurants go it tends to be one of the better options and I generally get adequate service there. Not sure what was going on tonight, though. We arrived about 5:30pm, my enormous party of 2, and were greeted by a very visibly ill hostess. (I will quote her, cough, cough ""I think I'm dying"") Coughing and hacking, she wants my phone to scan my preferred member card or whatever. I'm no germophobe, but I'm not exactly cool with getting coughed on and my personal items handled by a sick hostess in a restaurant. Service was slow and awful, the server forgot my salad, which was the reason I went in the first place. I was going to order dessert, but we had to be somewhere by 7 (Target, in the same parking lot) and I was afraid we wouldn't make it in time.  I'm glad I didnt, because we had to find a manager to get our check, gave the waitress our credit card, and it took at least 10 minutes to get it back. I mean, I'm no restaurant manager, but I dont think you should have a sick hostess greeting your customers. Anyways, I still want my salad, so I'll probably hit up the other location and see if the service is better, if I haven't caught whooping cough."
Jim L.,"Reno, NV",0,22,,5.0,10/2/2016,Food was great! Service great! Parking great! Family friendly. What i Love is once in awhile Bj's does feed the children drive where you donate a $1 and the next purchase $10 off! Over all just a really great place to hang out with family and friends.
Susan P.,"Anderson, CA",19,29,1,4.0,5/4/2015,I had the Black and Bleu Burger and I've got to say it's one of the best burgers I've ever had. Same with the shoestring fries. Delicious!  My husband had the Mediterranean Taco - a mixed salad with chicken in fresh pita bread. He said he would definately order it again.  I'm so sad that we didn't realize that they had house brewed sodas. Next time we'll definately have to try them!  Service was great. Love the look of the restaurant. Enjoyable meal with good friends.  We're fans and will eat here again when we're traveling through Reno/Sparks.
Laura H.,"Reno, NV",0,7,,2.0,9/26/2016,This place has not changed. The food was good but 1 hour to get a lunch special sandwich is stupid. This is why we do not come to this one. The one in south Reno has such better customer service. They could of comp us 5 bucks or a soda. We will not be coming to this one again.  That is why south Reno always has a lone out the door.
Michelle L.,"Phoenix, AZ",65,74,70,5.0,2/8/2016,I Love eating at BJ's. BJ's favorite is the best deep dish pizza around here. This and their chocolate chip cookie pizookie are my kryptonite. My husband comes here for the beer selection and pizza as well
Daniel E.,"Reno, NV",603,291,236,3.0,10/8/2015,"BJ's is a national chain of brew house restaurants.  It is a publicly traded corporation (traded on NASDAQ) and the feel you get is your typical dining / drinking experience that is created by management that must please a board of directors and ultimately their investors.  I'm sure the sexual innuendo in their name isn't missed by their marketing department.  BJ's is the Denny's of craft brew pub restaurants.  This doesn't have to be a bad thing, but you can forget about the homely small craft brewery feel that you'll get when visiting Great Basin Brewery, Silver Peak, or Brasserie Saint James in Reno, NV.  They are going for a very wide appeal and have to do whatever they can to keep operations costs down.  You'll find something to satisfy everyone in your party, but the charm that was captured by the original BJ's location is most likely long lost.  If you do go, do a couple flights of tasters - they do have some good beers and there is enough there to keep you tasting for a while.  In addition, try their roasted sriracha brussel spouts and grilled mahi mahi tacos - delish!"
Marissa H.,"Modesto, CA",209,3,1,1.0,4/5/2016,Already the service was terrible. BJs get your shit together!  The food is mediocre and the service is shit as well for the wait. I don't know why we came here. Never again. Plus our waitress was weird and rude and didn't want to do anything for us! plus the manager is a jerk.
Staci F.,"Medford, OR",90,16,1,4.0,4/23/2016,I love the berry cider here. Today when I went I got the bison burger with fries. It's a very safe place to eat...meaning what you see is what you get.
KBelle B.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",1,15,17,5.0,4/2/2014,"Happy Tummy... Just ate in this location and we ordered the avocado egg roll, shrimp scampi pasta, and a small combination deep dish pizza... Happy to say all turned out greattttt! Service was pretty awesome too... Considering they were pretty busy tonight.  5 Star overall! ("",)"
