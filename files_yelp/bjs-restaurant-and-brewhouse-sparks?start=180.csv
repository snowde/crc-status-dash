Bonnie D.,"Reno, NV",1,14,4,3.0,8/29/2016,Service was good.  I had the ahi salad. There was very little ahi.  My friend had the chicken tacos with a quinoa salad which he said was delicious.
Bob B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,4.0,9/14/2016,Great lunch menu.  I had the wings with root beer sauce and stuffed mushrooms.  Excellent lunch and craft beers too.  We stop in whenever we're in Reno/Sparks.
Kim S.,"Reno, NV",41,63,52,3.0,5/3/2016,"Went to dinner with the family the other day.  As much as I want to like BJ's, it's really not all that great.   The boys had this gigantic, beefy burger with more meat on top.  I had chest pain just looking at it.  I ordered the soup, broccoli cheese, and the wedge salad, chopped.  The waiter was nice and friendly - only mistake is that I received my salad not chopped.  No big deal - I cut my salad and noticed it was very watery so the blue cheese dressing kind of fell off.  Iceberg soupy lettuce salad. My soup, well it reminded me of melted Velveeta cheese with some frozen broccoli in it. I've tried over the years several different items since their menu is quite large, but just haven't felt there is something that was so yummy I needed to go to BJ's for it.  Also The family and I also tried some of their brews.  All 3 of us didn't care for the beers and they seemed kind of flat.  If not for the nice server, I would give the food itself 2 stars."
D L.,"Reno, NV",0,4,2,1.0,3/11/2016,"Used online ordering.  Our order was incorrect when we went to pick it up, as well as the other 3 customers orders waiting in front of us. Manager tried to blame us for ordering wrong, when in fact my email confirmation receipt was exactly what we ordered.  Somehow what they printed out and what they tried to charge us for had several extra items added to it.  After everything was sorted out and we got home, the food was cold, one order was still incorrect and the Mahi Mahi tacos had one very, very small piece of fish in each taco.  I basically paid $10 for cold tortillas and chips. There were no apologies and it seemed to be an ongoing problem."
M.D. G.,"Minden, NV",9,36,3,4.0,10/23/2014,"I had been avoiding BJs since it appeared to be an applebees sort of place with faux happy staff and a butload of kids, wanting some free crap.   I was wrong and will gladly be back. Sat at the bar, bartender was very nice, when she saw I was reading left me alone.   the deep dish pizza was exactly what I wanted couldn't finish the 9"" and the porter they have  is outstanding.  This may be  chain or a franchise, I don't know  but I willbbe back,     Thank you BJs"
Gabrielle T.,"Sparks, NV",141,113,423,4.0,6/26/2013,"Food is always good.  Restaurant & restrooms (ladies) are very clean.  Staff is generally friendly & knowledgeable.   If you want  a pizzookie, order it when your main course arrives.  Otherwise you'll be waiting a good long while.  We've been given more than a few free pizzookies as a result of excessively long waits for both food and our bill."
Kobe O.,"Honolulu, HI",248,162,77,5.0,12/26/2014,"Place is packed, employees are awesome, good vibe, good lunch specials,......great experience!"
Daniel A.,"Fallon, NV",4,39,6,4.0,2/8/2016,"Great place! Love their beer selection and the food is great. Their wings are amazing and way better than that other place that ""specialises"" in Buffalo wings."
Jason R.,"Galt, CA",28,10,,5.0,8/7/2016,"This is a great BJ's. Fast service, well organized, great French dips! Our waiter was well prepared, my water was always full, kids sodas always topped off."
Joel s.,"Reno, NV",3,26,,2.0,7/21/2016,"We went here a few weeks ago with some friends... on their menu they were touting this great new hamburger, so I gave it a try. One of the worst and smallest flatest burgers. I really thought they would have done something special, but it sucked. Aside from the fact it was more expensive than most hamburgers at other places because BJ's is more expensive than most restaurants. Do not order it."
Denver D.,"Reno, NV",2,55,8,1.0,7/20/2016,"Went here for my sisters Bday dinner in July 2nd. 7 of us got seated and were handed menus. Took nearly 10 minutes to get our drink orders in. Then, another 15 minutes to flag down someone to order appetizers. When the food came my mothers cheese burger didn't have cheese in it, they literally took the burger back to the kitchen and placed a slice of Cheese on it. Didn't even attempt to melt it. When my mother cut the burger in half, it was raw... Then, her fries were cold. For as many people as this establishment has working, they are extremely slow to get drinks, refills, or even the check! The one in Reno has much better service. Never going here again!"
Sharon J.,"Roseburg, OR",151,382,519,3.0,9/24/2013,"So far.... Calamria sucks at this BJ. South BJs so much better. Onto the main dishes, ok. I will be going to the BJs in south Reno not sparks again. Still for two drinks (happy hr) and appetizer and two meals only came to 46.00. Great prize for the meal we got.  The service was nice and the customers at the bar where very friendly and wanting to chat."
Carla C.,"New Braunfels, TX",28,64,43,1.0,8/16/2014,"3 adults and 3 children.. Horrible Service.. Waited 10 minutes for waiter to come to the table. Getting our drinks took 10 minutes.. Forgot appetizer salad. Served 2 dinner entrees after an hour. 15 minutes later served a soup bowl.. And 20 minutes later the 2 other burgers came out. Water went dry 3 times. Horrible service, spoke with management.. Horrible kitchen, had to send over cooked (burnt) food back... Not happy. We come here a few times a month, not so sure that will continue.. Management needs to get their restaurant straightened out..."
Chad S.,"Sparks, NV",0,10,20,5.0,10/11/2015,"BJ's always has the best food, great servers, and excellent atmosphere. The prices are a bit high but worth it."
Anthony D.,"San Francisco, CA",457,623,218,1.0,8/31/2012,"Mediocre food.  Think Olive Garden, Bennigan's or Applebee's. Mediocre service.  Think Olive Garden, Bennigan's or Applebee's. Ineffective management made up of corporate subordinates. Doesn't appear to be a biker friendly establishment.  Just another high volume, frozen food, corporate box run by robots with flair.  Lots of flair, like the movie ""Office Space"". Our group of 40 tried it last year, during Street Vibes and debated long and hard whether to return this year.  We've decided to take our business elswhere, since we prefer to eat better food in a more accomodating location."
Mrs. J.,"Truckee, CA",1,49,4,5.0,8/10/2016,"Went there for my friends birthday, sat at the bar ordered our excellent food and drinks right away! I cannot remember the bartenders name but it was august 3rd 2016 about 6pm and he was awesome! Very attentive to us and excellent service and attitude! He definitly helped us start off our night great!"
Stacey A.,"Truckee, CA",223,6,48,4.0,1/9/2014,"I came here with a couple friends for a quick lunch after shopping at Legend's, and I was surprised with the atmosphere and affordability.  Being both a vegetarian and a beer enthusiast, I had more than enough options. The menu is huge! We started off with some fried artichoke hearts. I don't even really like artichokes all that much, and these were delicious and came with a super-tasty (possibly lemon aioli) dipping sauce.  It took us a while to decide on beer because there was just such an abundance of options. It was tempting not to go for one of BJ's beer samplers, but the bottled selection of various Belgian beers was just too good to pass up. I ended up trying a saison from Dupont which turned out to be my favorite saison of all time. No, I'm not exaggerating. I'd go back just for that beer. I tried to order another, but they were all out, so I got a Green Flash Triple IPA. This beer is super hoppy yet surprisingly well-balanced and flavorful for its style. It's also around 10%, so you know...it's well worth the $7.95.  If you're on a budget, you really can't go wrong with the lunch specials which are all in the $6-10 range. I got a margarita flatbread with a house salad for $6.95, and it was more than enough food. I was also considering the soup and half sandwich, the small portion of pasta, or the unlimited soup and salad, all under $10. All in all, the beer selection really shined, and the food was cheap and tasty. I'll definitely eat here again if I'm in the area."
Mark S.,"Reno, NV",9,106,,4.0,7/3/2015,"Good food,good service, nice ambiance. Chicken tortilla soup is fabulous. Our go to restaurant when in Sparks."
Tom B.,"Reno, NV",0,12,,4.0,2/10/2015,"First time visiting here. Server was Leonardo. Got seated quickly. 6 of us celebrating my daughters graduating college.  Service was good. Drinks were kept full. Food came out quickly.  I had the fish and chips. Way too much on the plate, but tasted very good. Everyone else had burgers or pulled pork or pizza. No complaints from any of us. The place was full and busy for a Monday night but we were never rushed to get going.  Lots of choices on the menu. Will be back to taste some of the other offerings."
Staci R.,"Sparks, NV",111,3,,1.0,7/22/2016,"If I could give no stars I certainly would! This is by far the worst bj's I have ever been to! Pretty much a waste of time and money, the food is always wrong the service is horrible and the manager? Ha what manager didn't even come make sure we were okay. Ya waited 45+ mins for my food that was basically frozen! I will not be returning."
