Al. E. S.,"Reno, NV",16,12,21,2.0,6/17/2015,"BJs food is always pretty consistent, which is why we usually head there, but last night sucked. We arrived at 5:30 and sat ourselves in the bar. Our order was a burger, a side salad and a flatbread pizza. It took OVER AN HOUR. By that point it was crazy busy and we were going to complain, but the people behind us had just flipped out so we just waited for our bill. We actually never got that so we just flagged down the waitress to give her our card. All told we are there for an hour and 45 minutes for what we were wanting to be a quick meal. Not a single apology for the long wait and our server was less than friendly from the start. Will be finding a new go to place."
Danny P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",24,25,11,3.0,7/4/2014,"This BJ's location is a bit confusing. Our waiter approached us and told us he was only taking our drinks and appetizers. Then we were told that happy hour doesn't apply to the entire Resturaunt only to the bar area and not the tables 15 feet away from the bar. Then our waiter came back and told us that he will take our full orders and that he only said drinks and appetizers because he assumed we didn't look ready.  I ended up ordering from the happy hour menu for food and drinks, but had to leave my party of 8 because I had to sit in the bar area in order to get the happy hour deals.  The bartenders were nice and courteous though.  Not sure of the logic here, but the drink and food were good.  Barely recommended."
Mr. Nice G.,"Fresno, CA",16,222,186,3.0,7/3/2015,"Same as any other BJ'S that you've visited, large selection of brews and as always overpriced frozen food reheated by some ordinary chef. They need to start coming up with signature dishes so that people can get a great taste of food with their beer."
Elena B.,"Sparks, NV",202,215,44,1.0,9/22/2013,"If I could give zero stars I would. Where to even begin? We went here on a Thursday, and were told for a group of 6 it would be a 20 minute wait. What they meant was a 50 minute wait. Seeing as we didn't realize this at the time we went to the bar to catch the tail end of happy hour. The 2 girls working the bar were terrible. They combined tabs somehow and forgot (twice!) to put in an appetizer order. We were told our table was ready without getting our appetizer, but our waitress assured us she would bring it to our table. After asking twice about it 15 minutes later she finally brought it to us - cold. The service at our table was appalling. I sincerely hope it was our waitresses first night, because she gave terrible service. For a group of 6 I think she refilled our waters once, then forgot about us. I literally had to go to the hostess station to ask for our check after we'd been sitting at our table finished eating for nearly half an hour. The host asked if I wanted to talk to a manager, because we were all pretty irritated, but I felt bad for the waitress and suggested maybe they just cut back on the number of tables she had, since she clearly couldn't handle the burden. The food was only Mhhhhh and in NO way compensated for the atrocious service of the bar tenders or our waitress. I am never coming here again, for mediocre food, why deal with these idiots?"
Heidi R.,"Reno, NV",19,4,,1.0,4/11/2015,I ate lunch here today with my family and accidentally left my jacket in the booth. I called no later then 10 minutes after we left and it was gone. The only explanation is someone stole it. The manger had no luck of locating my jacket but where else could it have gone in 10 minutes. Very disappointed that it could have been staff who took my jacket!
Krysti S.,"Reno, NV",0,14,5,5.0,7/5/2014,"BJs is one of my favorite restaurants in Sparks. The berry cider is always amazing, and the food is delicious. Jeremy, the bartender, is super friendly and always takes care of us quickly.  I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar!  I've had many drinks here including the classic margarita which is spot on. The pizzas are always perfect, the roast beef dip is one of my favorite menu items, as well as the burgers.  The mozzarella and tomato salad is the best caprese I have ever had.  I highly recommend this restaurant (especially for a chain) and will continue to go to it often!"
Kelli E.,"Reno, NV",1,5,,2.0,5/15/2016,"We have been coming here for quite a while and have always enjoyed the personalities and service of the staff, however we have never had Ahlani as a server.  My husband has ordered chips and salsa and we had to ask her for them.  Her response was ""Oh yeah they should be ready by now"", this was after I had already eaten my salad. She brought the chips and salsa and asked if he wanted another beer... we had to ask her for that too and her response was""Oh yeah it should be ready"".  Mind you we had eaten all of our food."
Stacy W.,"Sparks, NV",197,25,41,4.0,11/12/2014,"If I had to pick a chain restaurant in Reno to eat at, this would be my choice. The food is consistent, if you order it once you can rest assured that you'll receive the same food when you return. If you go on a Friday or Saturday after about 6:00, you'll be waiting a bit - seems the wait is about 30 minutes. Overall the service is average, exactly what you'd excepct from a busy chain. However, if there are open seats at the bar, or the tables directly behind the bar you do not have to wait and there is table service to all the tables near the bar!"
Brenda P.,"Reno, NV",0,10,1,4.0,7/8/2015,Love their martini's! Always there every Friday for happy hour and can never get enough! I will continue to come here for drinks as a tradition on Friday's because of their bartenders and their service
Angie F.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,39,2,1.0,7/3/2014,"First time eating at BJ Brew House. Decided to order appetizers in the bar and watch the SF Giants game. Ordered calamari, avocado spring rolls and potato skins.  The calamari was so dry, it was like it had been sitting out on a plate for 3 days. The avocado spring rolls had just come out of the oven. I've never been served warm avocado. Avocados should be served room temperature or cold. The potato skin topping of cheese and bacon was good. The potato skins were tough and overcooked.  Expected better food from a brew house. Not returning there for a meal."
Ron D.,"Sparks, NV",38,21,23,3.0,12/8/2014,"Okay, I do like BJ's Brewhouse and the quality of their food, the only real problems I've ever had was slow service whilst sitting in a booth, in the bar area never an issue. My other problem(s) is, now correct me if I am wrong here, but when you think happy hour you think select appetizers at a reasonable discount, right? The thing that bothers me most is their so called ""Happy Hour prices"", they are completely deceptive as it's not any cheaper because they make their Happy Hour appetizers half the size(not in their menu anywhere does it say half the normal order) of what they would normally be, hence your still paying full price, see for yourself the next time you are there. Chicken wings for example; you get ten wings off happy hour and five (which in itself is slightly insulting) during their so called ""Happy Hour"", Pot Stickers aren't quite half the order but still slightly insulting when you see the quantity (4), and lastly, their craft beers are a dollar off putting them at four dollars each, not that great of a ""Happy Hour"" price either in my opinion. I'm not looking to get anything for free and as I said their food is good, but when you order five wings for five dollars, four pot stickers for five dollars, two beers at four dollars each, and my wife had some fancy drink that was $9.75 (Strawberry Splash I believe it was) granted it tasted good, but come on! $10 for a drink is a bit expensive/out of line! Our bill came to $28 and change for everything not including the tip, that didn't feel like Happy Hour at all to me, or my wallet. So if you're looking for ""Happy Hour"" prices at BJ's Brewhouse, you'll have to look elsewhere because you won't find it there. Again, the food is good, but 5 wings, 4 pot stickers, and 3 drinks for $28 (tip not included) is really hard to swallow. I would only give them 2 1/2 stars if possible and only completely because of their pricing, look, wings and pot stickers are/is some of the cheapest bar foods you can buy, and honestly, the don't differ very much from place to place. You can argue you get what you pay for, but like I said, ""wings and pot stickers"" folks, ""wings and pot stickers"". $18 dollars for three drinks during happy hour! Really!?"
Morgan M.,"Reno, NV",0,8,,2.0,7/19/2015,"The food is good, but at this location I never seem to be able to get good service. I came here a couple weeks ago and instead of getting quality service, I got the waiter sitting down in our booth and hitting on my fiance. I might return when they have a staff that can carry themselves in a professional manner but until then I will give my business to the south Reno location or to another restaurant all together."
Jodie S.,"Reno, NV",112,120,239,4.0,2/22/2014,"We ordered 2 of the 2 for $20 pizza specials (5 people eating.) Which I think is such an incredible deal. You get to choose a soup or salad to start, a medium pizza and a pizookie to share!    I started out with the Chicken Tortilla soup which I love. The flavors of the tortilla strips, huge slices of avocado, cheeses, chicken, and a slice of lime all blend so well together. I just wish that tonight the soup had a little more chicken then what it came with tonight. However, still very yummy. The deep dish pizzas we had were outstanding as always. My two favorite are the Mediterranean and the Buffalo Chicken! BJ's never fails to stuff so many flavorful toppings on their pizzas! The Mediterranean was so fresh tasted so incredible with the grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. Oh my goodness so good! The Buffalo Chicken had diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in a spicy buffalo sauce drizzled with ranch dressing and buffalo sauce. I normally have a difficult time with buffalo sauce as it is normally too spicy for me to eat much of it. I think this pizza has just enough spice that I can feel it on my lips and in my mouth but not enough that would cause me to be a fire breathing dragon!!! It is a perfect combination with the toppings and the sauces. You may all be thinking why so much food?  Well... because they are even better the next morning/afternoon cold or hot! LEFT OVERS! We finished with the pizookie for dessert. I was very sad as they did not have my favorite pizookie, red velvet. They are changing their menu and are not continuing with the red velvet. SO disappointing because that is one of my favorites. My other favorite is the white chocolate macadamia nut which never ever disappoints. Perfectly baked so that it still is soft in the middle but crunchy on top. The vanilla bean ice cream is the next piece that completes the dessert. So good. Since we had to order two for the meal deal we also got the chocolate chip, which is good, but for me I would have rather of had the red velvet. Overall, the service was quick and the food was delivered promptly. The food was awesome!"
Sara S.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,3.0,7/3/2015,"This place is always a hit or miss for me. Sometimes when I go there the staff is really nice, but then I'll go and I'll be completely ignored. The food is the same way. Sometimes it's good and sometimes I feel like I could've made it better myself."
Michelle S.,"San Lorenzo, CA",29,28,1,5.0,1/6/2015,"My experience here yesterday was amazing. I've never had such great service. Even though the food took long to come out, the waiter came by and made sure we knew that he was on top of it. In the end the food was amazing, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great!!!"
Steven R.,"Sparks, NV",4,10,,4.0,6/22/2015,"For a chain, they are amazing. Great food. Consistent quality. Great service. Very diverse menu (gluten free option)."
Sean S.,"Reno, NV",5,82,1,1.0,7/24/2014,"Overpriced to the point of absurdity... I'd like to say I'm sorry to the waitress for the small tip I left, it wasn't your fault. I just can't bring myself to pay more than $20 for such a small lunch and since I paid about $18.50 for a tiny pizza and a microscopic salad (which would have been about $8 anywhere else) ... Well, u were left with the remaining buck fifty... I will not eat here again and evidently all the employees at my work are also avoiding this place due to the insane prices.  Perhaps YOU should do the same. And to that random nosey gal who took it upon herself to berate me about the tip... All i can say is what I said here, im not paying more than $20 for a lunch size pizza/salad, period. And how is this your business anyway????   If you like this place so much, why dont you marry it?   Meanwhile im gonna eat, and tip, whatever I want, whether you ""approve"" or not.... But i wont be doing it at BJ's in sparks... and especially knowing that someone like you is fan ... or even, gasp, an employee????    Likely."
A U.,"Truckee, CA",0,60,4,2.0,7/6/2013,"Less than a pleasant experience, in general. Drinks order and appetizer order went fine. Then as we waited and waited for our pizzas, waiter stopped by. Said that he made an error and admitted to forgetting to place our food order. No problem to me. Very professional. Admitted error. That would be enough to satisfy me.  Said that the manager was coming over to talk to us. Manager delivered dinner about 10+ minutes later and gave us a different story. Said that they made one of the pizzas wrong and had to redo, hence the time delay. Well, I believe the waiter, but it doesn't matter. They did comp us the appetizer and 1/2 of each pizza, but it would have been okay without doing that. I didn't ask for that, but they offered. Took them up on it. That will keep me from holding a lifelong grudge. We did wait over 30 minutes after our appetizer was done for dinner.  Other minor things wrong, but when there's enough of them, they start to add up. Forgot one of the table settings, so missing a napkin for a while after appetizer arrived. One pizza was clearly not cooked enough. Cheese wasn't melted fully. Coffee with no cream. Got the cream, realized that the coffee was cold. Waiter was focused more on table of young ladies next to us which I think contributed to the issues. Desserts were incorrectly delivered to the table of young ladies next to us. Person who brought it out changed course, threw them down on our table and walked away. We looked at each other. Really? I'll be back. Wife is a BJ's regular (at Summit Sierra) and I have completed one favorable review from there. This location is run differently."
Candace B.,"Sun Valley, NV",1,8,1,5.0,10/28/2014,Every time my family goes to BJ's we will be requesting that Stetson be our server.  Super cool dude.  He remembered our family after one trip.  The food is also amazing.
Robin H.,"Sparks, NV",44,14,3,2.0,4/7/2015,"Went to the one in Sparks and our waitress was rude, half of my salad was the stem. You are supposed to cut that part off then serve it. My crispy artichokes were soggy. Also my soup in a bread bowl was more bread than soup. There was barely any soup. My pear cider was good. Just not sure I will go back to this location. Funny thing is they weren't even busy!!"
