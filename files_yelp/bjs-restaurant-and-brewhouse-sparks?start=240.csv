Michael G.,"Sparks, NV",7,9,9,4.0,2/10/2014,This is my first review of BJ's I ordered a pizza and salad online. I placed the order at about 4:45 and the order was delivered just before 6:00. The pizza was great as well as the salad. I will order from them again and I will make my first stop at BJ's in the near future.
Thomas E M.,"Gardnerville, NV",214,430,2302,4.0,7/27/2011,"BJ's has quickly emerged as a favorite. Why? 1)  Good fresh food. 2)  Good attentive service. 3)  Ability to add to and take away from menu items.  They are very able to customize their dishes to meet your needs.  I asked for two significant changes to my Grilled Chicken sandwich, and they achieved both.  My wife asked for one significant change, and it was also taken care of. 4)  Good variety of beer. 5)  Good sports viewing opportunities. The only drawback is that some might find them a bit pricey... Enjoy"
Matthew H.,"Sparks, NV",9,7,6,1.0,9/26/2012,"I had to take a few days to cool off before writing this review. Let be begin by saying that I overall I love BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. I have eaten at BJ's all over the west coast and I normally leave very happy after drinking good beer, eating good food, and receiving excellent customer service. The review that I am writing today is in no way is reflective of BJ's as a whole; this review is only for its location in Sparks Nevada. On Saturday September 22, 2012 I decided to meet family for dinner. We chose to go to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse at the Legends in Sparks Nevada. We arrived shortly before 4pm and sat down at a dirty table in the bar area. It took several minutes for a waitress to notice us and come to collect the check and dirty glasses from the previous patrons. At 4:04pm we ordered an appetizer, nachos and beer, we asked our waitress ""Dee"" about happy hour. She replied that ""we don't have happy hour on Saturday."" I pointed to the sign on the table that stated happy hour during all college and professional football games and motioned to the two games that were currently displayed on the huge TV above the bar. Our waitress replied with ""I have no idea what's going on"" and left to put our order in. At 4:07pm I could see our beers had been poured by the bartender and were sitting on the bar waiting for our waitress to come run them. There we sat until 4:21pm when our waitress brought water out to our table told us that is was in fact happy hour and asked if we were ready to order, we asked about the beer we ordered that we could see sitting on the counter getting flat for the last 14 minutes and our appetizer. She replied ""I can't run them right now; I was hoping someone else would have."" She walked around for a minute and then went to get our beer. At 4:24pm our beer was finally delivered to the table and she took our order for dinner. Someone from the kitchen came out with our nachos at 4:27pm, there was not silverware on the table and we were hungry so we just went and got them ourselves to avoid any further problems. At 4:30pm our waitress came to check on us, I ordered a second beer. I could see my beer get poured and was sitting on the bar at 4:33pm once again it just sat there until another server decided to bring it to the table at 4:46pm. The food finally arrived at 4:51pm, the food was good however my sandwich was served with far fewer fries than are normally served with meals and the plates were lacking the normal presentation I have come to expect from BJ's. It took over 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get a beer, at a Brewhouse I find highly unacceptable. The restaurant and bar had a typical Saturday crowd, it was by no means busy, and the restaurant looked adequately staffed. I would have voiced my complaints to a manager but there was no manager in sight most of the time we were there. As a frequent BJ's customer I have become accustomed to having a manager come by at least once during the meal to check on me. This did not occur, the only time I saw a manager during our visit was when two people who appeared to be managers came out from the back to stand behind the registers chatting with employees and divvying out tips in with the other staff in front of customers (See attached photos). I find 5 people standing behind a register while my beer is sitting on the bar getting warm and flat appalling. I would not write a review after one bad experience but a situation similar to this occurred about a month before when I had lunch at this location. I feel this location is lacking sound management and the restaurant as a whole is suffering. Poor employee education, training and the lack of management support and oversight lead to poor customer service and upset customers as a result. Luckily for BJ's I have had the pleasure of eating at other locations where I have become accustomed to enjoying great beer food and customer service at other locations. After two bad experiences in a row I will not be returning to the location in Sparks Nevada."
Jessyca T.,"Fall River Mills, CA",0,3,,3.0,3/7/2015,Waited way tooo long for the waiter to actually take our order. Told them it was my birthday and they said they would bring out a desert and never did. Food was good but got my order wrong. Lots of Walt staff just standing around. Probably try it again some day with hopefully better results.
Cheryl L.,"Reno, NV",10,2,,4.0,4/2/2014,"#reno Wednesday night about 5:30.  It was fairly crowded but our party of four was seated right away.  Our server was super friendly and did his best to get our order within a reasonable amount of time.  It was obvious he was a little stressed and was struggling to keep up with his tables.   Our order was delivered about 45-55 minutes later, our kids were literally withering away to nothing.  We ordered four entrees - deep dish pizza, flatbread pizza, parmesan crusted chicken and a kid's mac & cheese.  Each item was lukewarm at best.  The tomatoes my daughter asked to be omitted were covering her chicken.  The fries she requested instead of mashed potatoes had also been forgotten. When our server finally had a chance to return to our table, we had gone ahead and started eating.  It was bordering on cold but still good. We mentioned the temperature of the entrees as well as the special requests.  He apologized profusely and insisted on a visit from the manager.  Before the manager visited our table, our server had brought a hot plate of fries for my daughter. The manager joined for us for quite a few minutes at our table as we talked about all our other great experiences with BJ's.  We love the food here and even when it arrived a little chilly, the manager and server both redeemed themselves and made it a great night for us.  WooHoo!"
Danny M.,"El Cajon, CA",78,14,18,5.0,11/11/2014,"Great experience here. I stop in every time I'm in Sparks, NV.  Our waitress, Shawn, pretty cool. The Bison Burger was ok but usually they're really good here."
Mary R.,"Westminster, CA",7,4,2,1.0,7/23/2014,"Made reservations at 7:30 for our softball team. Orders were wrong, food took forever to come. Some food was dry and overhwated.  We've been done eating over an hour and they are still trying to figure out bill. It's 10 pm and we're still waiting. You would think manager would at least throw in something for our girls. Not too happy!"
James C.,"Reno, NV",8,69,148,4.0,6/7/2013,Good food and great atmosphere. I think there are two different restaurants on yelp at this same address. The building has been renovated and is very nice inside. A perfect representation of Nevada.
Jennifer S.,"Sparks, NV",2,15,4,2.0,7/21/2014,"So, worst customer service ever, hands down! Came dor lunch with the famuly, waited an hour for burgers and a salad in a half empty restaurant.  Kids got their food 10 minutes before the adults which made it hard to finish ours when the kids are ready to go. Glad my son still had a drink while I qas eating, because our drinks never got filled. Nobody checked on us the wntire time. I saw tge manager have to sit down with 2 other tables while we were here... obviously we were not the only ones that had a bad time. Now I have all the time in the world to write this review since the waiter took my card 15 minutes ago and still has not brought it back. Will not be back...."
Rich B.,"Redding, CA",66,49,4,1.0,8/6/2013,"Stopped for mid-afternoon lunch. Ordered fish n chips. Very mediocre. Fish was mostly batter and far overcooked. Tarter sauce was some of the worst I've had too. How do you mess up tarter sauce?  Steak-cut Fries were good. Service good. But at 12.95 I expected much better food. In fact, I don't think I've ever paid that much for fish n chips, and all were a lot better than this.  Weak effort for BJ's. won't be stopping again, at least not at this location in Sparks, NV. Edited: Moved it down to 1 star. That fish was really terrible. No cook should ever serve something like that, and no manager should allow it. I didn't even take the leftovers with me, and we were traveling with an ice chest."
Amanda M.,"Reno, NV",15,28,1,5.0,8/7/2014,"Yum as always! Had great service, food was excellent, loved the salted Carmel pizookie- definitely recommend this if you have room for dessert :-) Enjoyed the home brew root beer too, although the orange cream soda not as much. Seated quickly, used the online app to pay which was really convenient and took $5 off (first time use with bjs card) We love coming here!"
Stephanie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,69,7,1.0,7/29/2015,"Been to this location a few times. We order from the lunch menu everytime and for some reason they decide to charge us for the full menu price. It's happened TWICE. They take forever to get your order. Almost never come for refills, you have to hunt them down for it. Today they sent out half burned avocado rolls. We didn't bother sending it back. They never gave us plates and we were a party of 4. I got my soup about 20 minutes before my salad. Just awful. Sadly, there isn't another BJ's around so we have to continue to come to this location. Food took especially long today and we weren't happy. At this point I'm not spending any more money at this location. We won't be back. Let me add that our order was wrong! My kids ordered chicken tenders and we had to wait and hunt down someone for ketchup. This has probably been their worse service ever to date. Never again!"
Bevan R.,"Sparks, NV",0,16,,1.0,7/3/2014,"I was willing to overlook the fact that my server got my order wrong (salmon caesar salad instead of the side caesar with salmon entre). I was willing to overlook the fact that they took my husband's fork with his salad and we couldn't get him a replacement for 10 minutes. But when I woke up at 2am with diarrhea, that's where I drew the line.  It would be one thing if this were an isolated incident, but frankly, this Sparks location has always given us trouble. I can honestly say that 1 out of every five orders I place there are correct. The service is always hurried, the servers are sweaty and look panicked (we were just there last night on a Wednesday, so it's not like we only go during the weekend rush).  The South Reno location gives us better service and I've never gotten sick there. I'm not sure if these are franchises, but the gap between the two leave me scratching my head."
Erik C.,"Sparks, NV",0,6,,1.0,7/30/2015,We showed up for a birthday party with 20 people and they gave us two tables and would not allow us to merge the two to create a big one to engage with each other. We also still HAVE NOT ORDERED A FOOD YET AND ITS BEEN 45 minutes. Follow us on Twitter. @xSam666 @trentklingler @ErikCochrane @_liizzzaaarrrdd @w_wrenn2
Chelsie Y.,"Reno, NV",34,13,,1.0,3/30/2014,"Before I begin let me emphasize what a huge fan I am of the Bjs brand..as you will find in my previous ""check ins"" I avid the South Reno location, and am a HUGE fan. I am so sad to have to leave this review as I have prided myself in only praising incredible acts of service.. But..Here it goes.. We have tried this location for date nights before and were not impressed due to like warm or overly salty food.. But as a fan we decided to try it a fourth time.. Today our  party called at 4:00 to reserve a table of 16 people (4 of which were toddlers) for 5:30. My 25 month old and I arrived at 5:20 to which I was told ""we are preparing your table, as soon as 8 of your party members Arrive we will seat you."" The rest of our party arrived at 5:30-5:35. Our party host went to check us in and they said they would seat us shortly. By 6:00 we check in and are told it would be roughly 20 minutes...which would mean an hour after our reservation. At this point all of our toddlers had run laps outside of their facility several times, and were an hour past their meal times. We decided to call a near by restaurant and they were able to get us in right away. Right when we handed in our pager around 6:10 we were told ""half of our table is ready if you'd like to sit down"".Which needless to say made us feel incredibly under valued. This was our first time ever leaving a Bjs, and as a result we spent over 400 dollars at a neighboring restaurant. Half of our party lives in sparks which caused us give this location a try, unfortunately/or fortunately our weekly gatherings will have to be held back at the south reno location. Bottom line: There is a near by Bjs that prides themselves with impeccable customer service 20 minutes away. They often offer samples to those waiting, etc.. Look up ""Reno Bjs"". Your expectations will be exceeded.  We will not be returning. Sadly the worst customer service experience."
Bret S.,"Reno, NV",619,312,182,3.0,6/10/2012,"Nothing spectacular about either the food or service here. Our server was very friendly and relatively attentive, but one of our food orders was delivered 5 minutes later than the rest of the table. I've had better experiences at other BJ's."
Kristina M.,"Tahoe City, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/8/2015,"Food is good, service good, but kitchen as major issues!40 mins for app's total of 55 mins for pizza. I love this place but this has now been three times in a row. Same story:("
S L.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,173,,3.0,10/9/2012,"Chain restaurant. Dinner with a couple of doctors. Apparently, the favorite for the local medical group for entertaining guests because of the GIANT SELECTION. Honestly, this menu was twice as large as any other BJ's I've been to. Setting: Situated in the Sparks shopping mall, this restaurant is ideally located for the hungry shopper. There is bountiful parking with multiple entrances and exits. The general feel of the restaurant is similar to that of other BJ breweries. The main difference is the abundance of televisions plastered along every wall. The only drawback is that every single one was showing the same game. What if you didn't like football? Stinks for you cause that's what you're watching. Tables are appropriately spaced such that traffic is never impeded, even at full capacity. We went on a Monday night, very low traffic. Waiter: Energetic and friendly with a generally happy disposition. I'm not sure all waiters do this but he was very systematic regarding taking orders. A refreshing change from the several occasions where I've had to repeat my order several times. He was quick with our refills. Given that we had a relatively large party, I appreciated the fact that he updated us with the status on our food several times. Definitely one of the pluses of this particular outing. Food: Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. As always, cooked to perfection. The crust was slightly buttered and crispy, the perfect combination for pizza. The deep dish pizza was indeed, thick, possibly measuring about 1 inch in depth. BBQ roasted to the point where it was slightly spicy. They may have skimped on the tomatoes a little bit. Lucky for me, they compensated with chicken. PROTEIN!!! Didn't get the desert but the pizooky is highly recommended. Drinks: Diet coke. 3 refills in 1 hour. Not sure if I got my money's worth. Recommendation: EAT!!!"
Burt M.,"Reno, NV",1,25,23,4.0,6/12/2012,"7-1-12 It had been a while since we visited this Restaurant, so my wife and I went there on Sunday about 6:30. Seated promptly, ordered Mojitos and their Red Beer- both excellent. Wife ordered New York steak- me the fish and chips. The orders arrived promptly and hot. Waitress and manager and hostess all were determined to make our visit enjoayable, and they did. Looking forward to having Lunch there next week!"
Courtney W.,"Ventura, CA",50,76,15,4.0,6/21/2014,The better of the 2 bj's in reno - better service all around. So glad to have bj's here
