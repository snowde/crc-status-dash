Cory B.,"Reno, NV",31,13,,5.0,8/2/2012,"I love this place. The food is great and they have a good selection of items. The chicken parmesan is pretty damn good, just make sure you get it with spicy spaghetti.  One of my favorite things here are there pizookies! The red velvet is delicous, the ice cream they top it with is really good as well.  They have a wide selection of beers and the ambience lends itself well to date nights. I highly recommend it."
Kathy C.,"Sparks, NV",2,16,1,3.0,5/27/2012,"I was thrilled when this location first opened but in the recent months the service here has went downhill. We went with some friends on Saturday night and had to wait forever for our food and then they brought us out the wrong pizza and then asked us if it would be ok if we just ate the pizza anyways. We would have because we were starving by then but we had ordered a simple pepperoni and mushroom and they made a pizza that was smothered in onions and balsamic sauce, not our cup of tea so we declined. My daughters Mac and cheese was so over cooked and dry it was all stuck together in big clumps. I hope they can get it together and get back on track because we use to enjoy going to BJ's and I would hate to never have a pizookie again."
Kim M.,"Reno, NV",0,6,,4.0,10/21/2014,"My boyfriend and I stopped in to make a To-Go order, and Nick was the one who helped us! He was friendly and efficient!"
Denise S.,"Sun Valley, NV",0,2,,5.0,3/11/2015,My friend and I had lunch here Monday.   As soon as we walked in we were seated.  Very Clean restaurant and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.   My friend had chicken tortilla soup and a salad.  She said it was the best soup she had ever had.  I had salad and the Margarita pizza.  My salad was fresh and delicious.  The pizza was perfect.  I will definitely go back.
sheri d.,"Sacramento, CA",31,91,452,5.0,6/7/2014,"Great lunch specials! In town as part of b-day shopping and this location is right near Legends Outlets. I got Cobb salad, husband ordered chicken fingers and fries, and sin got the chicken and shredded pork slider. Everyone was happy with meal. Our waitress was sweet but I can't remember her name! 1:30 on Thursday, place was busy but we were seat in a few minutes of arriving."
Katie S.,"Reno, NV",0,21,,5.0,10/14/2015,"Moved here at the beginning of the year and this was one of the first places we tried since we lived down the street.  We have been back a countless amount of times.  Everything on their menu has been delicious!  They have a large enough variety everyone should be happy.  They have really good dessert - try their pizooki (spelling?), it's amazing!!"
Andrea B.,"Reno, NV",35,46,62,4.0,5/29/2014,"This is one of our go-to places to eat dinner when we're near the marina or Legends. The food is predictably tasty every time I go. Whenever I do have an issue with anything, it is usually the insanely long line at the door ( we have since wised-up and started reserving a table before we get in the car to leave) or a service issue. The wait staff is usually about 50/50 on the excellent/blows scale."
Joe J.,"Reno, NV",17,51,,5.0,5/26/2014,"I've eaten at countless places ranging from Seattle to Reno, from San Francisco to Las Vegas...HOWEVER, one server that I have come across recently deserves the tile of: BEST SERVER I'VE EVER HAD. First of all, lets start with your hours....YOU'RE OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT OR 1AM. WINNING. As a fellow server in the casino industry, we hardly get out until 10pm, so I'm super happy that you're open late, and your servers are cool with this. THAT'S AWESOME. No matter what I get here, the food is amazing.  Pazookie, DON'T FORGET THEM.  Gourmet mac and cheese, YOU MAKE LIVING EVEN POSSIBLE.  Don't forget the pizza, pasta, and steaks....OH GOD. I'M HUNGRY AGAIN, HELP! So yeah, the cherry on top of it all was my server, Alina.  If ya'll ever need life coach as a server or something, watch her do her job.  She's amazing. 5 stars, BJ's in Sparks.  I'll see you soon. P.S. BJ's in Reno, you're too out of the way for me, but you aight.  Check out Scott at that location, he's awesome too."
Bob C.,"Spanish Springs, NV",0,7,1,2.0,12/27/2013,"Given electronic device on arrival, advised it would be 15-20 mins. After 45 mins went to hostess station, told ""we tried to call you"", ok we r in no hurry 15 min later still no call, talked with Mgr Eric seated immediately. 7 dishes ordered, 3 out quickly no problem, then 3 more within a couple of minutes - one ok, my chicken parm warm but veggies and spuds cool; my wife's turkey burger and fries cold. Sent burger back, I was ok with warm chicken but didn't eat sides. My sons pizza finally came out but it was the wrong pizza, we ended up with someone else's pizza, so they corrected the order and his pizza was soon brought to the table. When 6 of us were finished they finally brought out my wife's burger, which they then comped. We won't be back!"
Maurice D.,"Sparks, NV",0,4,,4.0,10/14/2014,"What a beautifull night in here maybe I go to 4 starts now cuz its my firts time in here. My dinner its perfect no complains about notthing,  just I recognized waiters and staff its very impressed. thank you so much ... I be back soom..."
Corina B.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,5.0,8/24/2014,"AMAZING service here. There have been times we've just come in for drinks. The drinks are strong and delicious, even when we have a custom ordered drink. They always do the best they can! The food has always been phenomenal. The waiters were right there when they were needed, and very personable. LOVE THIS PLACE!"
John F.,"Reno, NV",9,4,,4.0,7/28/2014,Really good deep dish pizza.  Only complaint is it is a bit pricey.  Service has always been solid and the pizza is freaking good.  Drinks are very good as well.
Cyndi J.,"Reno, NV",370,817,11,4.0,3/15/2012,"I wasn't expecting much from a chain, but I have to say, I loved the pizza.  It had a nice deep dish with a buttery, crisp, yet tender crust.  I had the salad and pizza lunch special, and it hit the spot.  Fun atmosphere, very friendly and attentive wait staff.  We'll be back to this place."
The B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,1.0,1/1/2014,"Well, we had to try the corporate Brewhouse to see what was cookin.  We were not surprised.  The pompous little character at the front door who was supposed greet us, needed a slap to his quaffed hair-do. Why would you put a guy like him, so arrogant at the front door is beyond me!  Most of the staff seemed like they were uncomfortable and unhappy... made us feel the same. The appetizer, Santa Fe spring rolls were tasty, probably is where we should have stopped.   Caesar salad was at best average. Nothing going on here. Brewhouse ""handcrafted"" bacon cheese burger was not inventive, just a corporate basic lackluster burger with almost average frozen fries.  Someone else brings our food to the table and auctions it off, I guess like a brewhouse does.  He doesn't see the table and our needs.  We had to ask the server for condiments, catsup and mustard.  What does handcrafted mean to these guys?  They use their hands to put an almost average burger together?  That's the best they can do.   In and Out does a better job, with a better personal experience for a third the cost and better taste.  Have you ever had a bad experience there?  Probably not.  Never in 40 years have I had an attitude or poor service in that place. And they just sell burgers. Maybe not the best, but cleaner and better attention than Joe Quaffs brewhouse. Opened up my napkin and silverware...I discreetly handed the server my knife with a gob of something smeared and dried on it,  he looks at it as if...what???  After I showed it to him in direct detail, he said, ""do you want another one?""  Come on...where do you get these rejects????  Are these the ones fired from the casinos? Expensive looking corporate atmosphere, cold, uninviting, and lack of ""handcrafted"" genuine food and service.  These guys have a lot to learn about food and service. No surprise here"
Darcy A.,"Sparks, NV",1,14,,1.0,7/10/2015,I go here often but tonight was a nightmare. We had Kaitlyn V as a server and she was the worse server I have ever had in all my life. We waited about 30 minutes to find out she ordered the wrong food so we had to wait even longer. She kept sitting at the table next to us rolling her eyes like she was irritated to have to work. She never refilled our drinks or came by to see if we needed anything. She we awful and I do not recommend this restaurant
Dave D.,"Reno, NV",0,4,,5.0,11/30/2013,"Love going to this place, awesome selection of beers and food, doesn't matter what kind of mood you you are in they have you covered."
Zsera D.,"Reno, NV",50,19,,5.0,10/30/2013,Bjs is one of our go to spots. My husband would probably eat here every week if he could. The service is good and the food is always good too. The menu is huge so tons of choices. My husband loves the maui sweet boneless wings. I always try something new but really like the buffalo chicken pizza and they have some good salads. They are usually very busy but I have never had service that reflected that.
SCOTT G.,"Garden Grove, CA",0,24,3,1.0,11/13/2013,"We had a horrible experience at this BJ's.. Not so much the service , but we ran into a problem with our bill and the Mgr. was not very professional.. Service 4 stars but Mgt. 1 star. Would not go here again.. Ever!!!"
Suzanne H.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,3.0,6/25/2014,Great food love the fish taco's on grilled one fried.  They have taken my favorite flatbread off the menu so that is not good.  We have always had very good meals and for the most part very good service except when we are with a large party.  I have gathered that the system they provide the orders to the kitchen may be the problem so we limit our time there to only small parties four at most with one ticket. Love the sports available to watch and great choices with beer.
Lin C.,"Romeoville, IL",186,247,881,3.0,12/20/2011,"High ceilings, open area, and what appears to be 3 garage doors in the middle of the dining area. The brews are decent. and the food was okay."
