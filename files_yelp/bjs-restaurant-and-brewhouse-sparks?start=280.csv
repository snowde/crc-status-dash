Jeremy L.,"Reno, NV",143,246,83,4.0,12/27/2011,"I generally patronize the BJ's in Reno since it is closer to my house and workplace but when I'm out in Sparks I'll hit this place up.    Even though it is smaller than the one in Reno I have to say I enjoy the atmosphere here much more. Bartenders are a little bit more personable here, the bar is cozier and frankly the restaurant feels 'warmer' both with temperature and temperament.   Beers are great (Jeremiah Red for me) and the food is always spot on.   Because it's a franchise you know what to expect but they don't screw it up and it tastes good. Customer service here has also treated me well and keeps me coming back for more."
Kim C.,"Wellington, NV",1,28,,4.0,2/6/2014,We had an excellent dinner with  a very good server. Our beers did seem to take a bit long to arrive with how slow it was. Pork Chop and New York very good. We'd go back.
Braden M.,"FALLON, NV",14,30,2,4.0,2/28/2012,"Great brews! Even the guest ones are good beers.  The food is pretty good too. The deep dish pizzas are tasty and have some interesting combos. Plus happy hour has half off the mini pizzas...good deal!  They do have a long list of other good foods on the menu like pastas, fish n chips , and burgers.  The setup is nice especially the bar area. Plenty of seating near the bar. There are plenty of tvs around too and behind the bar is a giant tv good for watching whichever featured game going on.  Classy bar atmosphere."
Jason S.,"Reno, NV",28,174,3,4.0,11/19/2011,"Come for the brews. If you can't drink for whatever reason, then there are better places with better food. That's not saying the food here is bad-- it's just that a craft brew with the chow makes it all a lot better. Can't go wrong with pizza, burgers, pulled pork sando, and extremely bad for you appetizers. Salads are over-priced and not a good value.  Porter brew very very good.  Reliable--- You know what you're going to get: Good service, pretty good food, and good beer."
Rose F.,"South San Francisco, CA",42,422,504,4.0,10/11/2011,We love going to BJ's when we can.  This is a new location for us here in Sparks.  Not as crowded as the one located at The Summit.   We ordered our usually BJ's Cobb Salad and Favorite Pizza with the Boneless Buffalo Wings.   Everything was wonderful and the staff were very friendly.
Jessica P.,"Reno, NV",5,50,7,1.0,10/29/2012,"I visited BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse on a Sunday evening for dinner. I have mixed feelings about my visit there so I will write this blog and let you be the judge.   The décor in BJ's is a mix of American Pub décor and modern styles. The atmosphere is really nice and the light fixtures are very modern. The restaurant is full of red upholstered booth seats with a few pub style tables in the bar area. When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted very promptly by the hostess and I was seated right away. I was given water right away and the waitress (whose name was Lindsey and you will understand why I'm naming names this time as you read on) came by to get our drink orders. It didn't take me long to make up my mind because I have had the pizza at the location in Reno before and knew it to be some of the best pizza in town. The waitress took quite a while to get back to our table but it was REALLY busy so I expected that my dinner might take a bit. When she came back with our drinks I placed my order. I ordered the chicken wontons appetizer served Thai style for $2.95, a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette for $2.95, and a medium Spicy Meatball deep dish pizza that I requested no onions on and I wanted bacon added; the pizza was $22.75 (Sorry there is no pizza pic... got a little distracted due to the events that unfolded).   The salad arrived within minutes and was delivered to us by another waitress; it was amazing how fast the salad came out! The pizza on the other hand took forever and we also never received our appetizers; I told Lindsey when she delivered the pizza. She wasn't very friendly or apologetic about forgetting the appetizers, in fact she acted like we were an annoyance to her so I told her to just forget the appetizers. I also asked the waitress for some ranch to go with the pizza and we each wanted a new drink (we had empty glasses for quite awhile now). It only took us each a bite to realize that our pizza was wrong and when we finally were able to waive the waitress down and tell her so she literally made a disgusted gasping noise and started walking away; as she walked away she said that she would have the manager over and before she had her back turned to us I literally saw her roll her eyes at us and shake her head.... now the experience had made a turn for the worse and I was fuming; I have never been treated so horribly by a server in my entire life! (And she still hadn't brought me the ranch I requested). The manager whose name was Eric came over to find out what was going on with our order. Eric was very courteous and explained that he would have our appetizers out and our pizza remade. He also expressed that he wanted to make things right and asked up what he could do for the inconvenience. I suggested maybe comping a drink or two and he said his manager didn't like him to comp alcohol so he would come up with something else. The waitress came by a few minutes after the manager left and asked us what had happened and we told her he was remaking our pizza so she took the pizza we had in front of us away (still no ranch). Our appetizers were delivered to us by another waitress again and it was a good thing they came because I was starving... I think at this point we had been there an hour or a little over that.   The pizza still took another 20 minutes to get to us and this time it was done right. I still had not received the ranch I requested and after trying to get the waitresses attention when she passed us by two times (she was most definitely ignoring us on purpose at this point) I almost had to shout to get her to come over to our table at which point I asked her for the ranch again. She came back with the ranch about 5 minutes later. The manager came back over to our table towards the end of our meal and told us he had comped the pizza and asked if there was anything else he could do... I told him no and that he was really excellent and that I appreciated his efforts. I didn't say one word to him about how rude and atrocious our waitress was and how bad she was at being a server. I literally considered giving her no tip which I have NEVER done in my life. Even thought her service was the worst I have ever received I still gave her an $8.00 tip which is far more than she deserved.   I can honestly say that I will probably never go back to BJ's in Sparks which is too bad because they have great food and a great manager. But, if BJ's is hiring this kind of low caliber server I can't say I want to visit them again; I don't go out to eat and spend my hard earned money so I can get treated like shit by a server.. excuse my french.   It's really too bad that horror stories like this happen; do you have a restaurant horror story, because I'd love to hear it... tell me where I don't want to go eat this time!

Stacy L.,"Sparks, NV",0,9,,5.0,3/25/2015,"My husband and I go here almost every time we eat out! Which is once to twice a week! The staff is incredible! They are almost all always so happy and friendly and helpful. Only one time out of 150+ visits did I have a hostess (I don't remember her name) that wasn't having a good day. And after the countless times I have had amazing experiences here, I can completely chalk it up to: that poor girl must have had a hard day. Erica is a server in the top bar area and seriously one of the most adorable friendly faces that I just love to see serving when we go there. She is incredible and just exuberant! So helpful, always amazing suggestions and so smiley all the time! I wish I could remember all the servers names because I would love to mention them all by name, they are wonderful! They recently removed the mini bruschetta which was a big hit with my daughters, in-laws, husband and anyone else I ever brought; however the menu changes that replaced it are more than sufficient! Also, when I'm craving clam chowder I love to go here! Their clam chowder has no hints of grainy grinding dirt and is absolutely delectable! The beer selection is incredible here as well. On occasion we will stop here on an adults only evening out for a tasty beer before a movie!  I simply love the atmosphere, food, servers and drinks! Perfect place for most occasions!!"
Rose G.,"Folsom, CA",2297,167,106,3.0,8/22/2013,"I don't mind this place as much as everyone else and I feel that I have good judgement in good restaurants. The wait is horrendous so never come here during dinner hours if you actually are hungry, come after 8pm or before 6pm. BUT once you are finally seated, the drinks are good and so is the food. It's nice to have TVs to watch the game or whatever and the booths are comfy. We have often had problems with their soda machine being off but I like their cocktails or lemonades better anyways. All of their appetizers are so good and huge portions like the artichoke dip or calamari. They have good burgers and pasta dishes and their ""enlightenment"" dinners are great tasting with lower calories. I just prefer the south reno one and hate waiting to be sat."
Stephen B.,"Reno, NV",42,13,5,5.0,9/25/2013,Another stunning performance at BJ's! Our waitress Nicole delivered amazing customer service. The Moroccan salmon was awesome. The BJ's brewhouse blond was delicious. Love this place.
R M.,"Reno, NV",0,12,,1.0,8/3/2014,"A friend recommended this chain restaurant based on his experience at another one in Dallas. We arrived at the Sparks BJ'S for lunch on Sunday 08/03. We were greeted by the hostess who told us to ""wait here'. There were only 3 or 4 other parties seated in the place so why she needed to analyze her computer screen and consult with the actual seater is a mystery. After waiting a couple of minutes she seated us at a table right next to another couple....but the place was empty so we asked if we could sit at the next table over. She rolled her eyes. handed us our menus and left. We waited for 10 minutes bur nobody ever came to wait on us or take a drink order or even bring water. Guess we were being punished. We saw Chipotle across the parking lot, saved the day. We walked out, needless to say never to return again. Serious management issues in this place."
R F.,"Reno, NV",7,124,8,2.0,1/5/2013,"i ordered the asian sesame chicken salad cause ive been craving for salads.  sucks for me that my salad had about 10% green on it & im not exagerating.  it was mostly the crispy looking onion rings.  i was sad but again it was my fault for not saying anything.  food took so long too. they were busy, but still... they should be prepared to be busy because it was dinner time on new years day.  i was there for 2 hours.  so long.   2 days later, i went to the reno bjs.. the one i always go to.  i asked the server about the amount of greens that should be on the asian sesame chicken salad to make sure... and yep there shouldve been more than what i got.  i really am annoyed at myself for not saying something at the time."
Steve T.,"Sparks, NV",262,708,4401,3.0,12/19/2010,"The service was good here, but the food was okay and considering it was discounted when I came during happy hour it would be too expensive during regular hours, I think. I took advantage of the happy hour special to order a mini pizza, which was half off. I also got a glass of red beer and a side salad. The waiter brought me samples of two beers and I appreciated that because I liked the second one, the red beer, much better. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I found one here I liked. I ordered the salad without croutons and it came with croutons, the only service problem I had all night. It was a pretty standard salad. When the pizza arrived the first thing I thought of was that it seemed more like a $5.12 pizza than a $10.25 pizza. Kind of expenisve. The pizza was just okay. Lots of dough and the dough didn't seem fully cooked.  I'd like to explore the menu and see if they've got anything that's killer. Update: I went back and got a pepperoni, sausage and tomato mini pizza and had them make it crispy and it was better. Also, they use really good tomato. I was impressed.  I found another beer I like. So I think they do a pretty good job with their beer selection."
Mary T.,"Indianapolis, IN",4,86,29,4.0,12/5/2010,"I have been to BJs in Sparks twice now.  My husband and I always try to sit at the bar because, well...we like to drink DAS BIER!  The house-designed micro brews here are all right, but the selections on tap are always killer.  They always have some tap behind the bar that makes me look twice and ask questions.  They usually have Arrogant Bastard (the hubby's fave) and every now and then I'll find a Dead Guy tap (my fave)! In addition to beer, we also like pizza.  The pizza here is pretty good.  I love good deep dish pizza loaded with sauce and veggies and cheese with a nice tasty crust.  Well, I got it.  We usually get the Mediterranean Pizza and besides being slightly salty (which you'll hardly notice if you're chasing the pizza with beer) was very good.  It's probably salty because of the massive amount of kalamata olives.  The service is typical, nothing absolutely amazing but nothing absolutely horrible. I'd recommend BJs if you like trendy, chain restaurants with good beer and decent food."
Tyler B.,"Reno, NV",76,71,8,3.0,4/4/2013,Good food. Ok service. They didn't have my first entrée choice. That really upset me. They were kinda busy so I'll excuse that the beer took forever. They Did a military discount which was cool. But overall the dessert(white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie) was the best part!!
Tessa D.,"Sparks, NV",102,13,15,5.0,7/22/2011,Always have a good time eating at BJ's whether it's in Reno or Sparks. Good food!! Had their Chicken Teriyaki for lunch earlier. Dessert? Of course! Had their Cookies N' Cream Pizookie. Yummy!!!!!
Katy K.,"Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",56,25,1,3.0,7/20/2012,"The food here is always good. However, it took forever to get our dinner and dessert. And the rib eye had a ton of grissle. Very disappointing."
Daniel Y.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1160,112,36,5.0,3/9/2013,The Corn Mash is so yummy! Barbecue chicken - juicy and tender! I like
Kristin K.,"Sacramento, CA",49,55,84,4.0,12/19/2010,"My husband and I love the Sparks BJs.  The good: The food! Everything I've had is delicious. The pizookies are amazing (especially the Oreo). The turkey burger was delicious. The pasta suburb. The pizza outstanding. The chicken is great too. Really, it's all fabulous. The happy hour specials. The mini pizzas are half off. Can't beat the $5 delicious little pizza. The atmosphere. We love the casual and cool ambiance. The bad: Parking. If you go during prime time, you'll end up parking in the Target parking lot. The cost. The salads and pizzas are our favs, but quite pricey, unless you go during happy hour. The wait for a bar seat to take advantage of happy hour specials."
S. B.,"Reno, NV",0,9,,1.0,11/13/2013,"This place is not as good as the other BJ's in south Reno. I and several friends have been her more than a couple of times and today, I met some business associates who came into town for lunch. The place was not at all full. Our drinks and appetizer was the only thing that was ok. Everything there after went downhill. We had been there 45 min or longer and realized our food hadn't arrived and then 5 min later another waiter brought out our entrees. What happened to our soups and salads that should have came before our meal. The server looked puzzled when we asked about it. He left what he brought and said he would check on it. Our server who initially acknowledged us when we first sat down said he would bring them out. Well, the soup came and it was COLD. (clam chowder) not so good cold.  He also brought me the last one to get served my chicken pasta, that to was COLD. I was so disappointed. He brought it back, then a male manager came and apologized and said he would bring it out. I also asked how come there was no crackers, which by the way, normally comes with the clam chowder (at least at other BJ's locations I've been to), he said it should have been there. When the server heard me tell the mngr that, after the mngr left, the server said a customer needs to request it. When the entree came out from the chef who delivered it. Guess what, the pasta was COLD as well. The server came around and asked how everything was and I told him that my food is COLD again. He apologized and here comes another mngr named Tina who apologized, etc. In speaking with her my business partners also spoke up and said this wasn't the first, nor the second time there's been problems at their restaurant. Once, there was nobody in the place and was told they needed to be wait (in the lobby area) to be seated, since there was no servers, yet to have arrived at work. WOW! Anyways, me and my associates let the mngr know, we will no longer come again. After more than 3 visits, all under-par, food, service, etc. We will no longer go to that location. I wonder if that's why the place wasn't hardly occupied because of the inconsistency of how its ran.  I've been numerous times (can't even count) to the BJ's in south Reno, where there were lines out the door each and everytime, but the service, and food were good and consistent. Maybe, it's just this location. You would think that the kinks would have worked it self out, since they aren't really new anymore as far as being opened at that location."
Christine R.,"Sun Valley, NV",4,20,,2.0,7/29/2014,"I gave two stars simply because the food was decently good, although I could have better options for the prices charged. The service was one of the worst I've ever had. Our server ignored us the entire length of our meal. Other servers served us the majority of the meal. We had a one year old with us, so maybe that's why they didn't tend to us as much as everyone else. We felt like we were burdening or annoying them the whole time. What a shame, because the food was actually pretty good!"
