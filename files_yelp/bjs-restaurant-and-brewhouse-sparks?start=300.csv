Katey H.,"Austin, TX",24,9,,4.0,5/27/2013,"I love BJs because I have to eat gluten-free and their gluten-free thin crust pizza is better than most others I have tried. They also make a cider that is gluten-free and delicious! Before I figured out that I had to eat GF, I tried all of their beers and some other menu items like salads and pizzas. I've never been disappointed with their food or their service. 4/5 because it's great for a chain restaurant, but not 5 because they still only serve basic pub food. If they had a bit more creative of a menu that would be great (or maybe some GF buns!)"
Rob P.,"Reno, NV",0,83,2,5.0,1/26/2013,"I don't think it gets much better for a chain. They've got a great menu (bring everyone to one place) and they have their own beers that are just great. Every time I'm here they're pros. If we wait, it's comfortable. We call ahead to get on the list, handle that well. The wait stay are friendly and professional. The chicken keeps the food quality consistently good. They do seem to run out of wheat as the pizza option. Two times in a row. It's no biggy, just makes me feel 'better' about eating a face full of pizza and beer."
Diandra K.,"Västra Götalands län, Sweden",22,106,11,3.0,12/31/2010,"The best part about going to a BJs anywhere is that everyone will find something to like on the menu. It's a nice compromise when everyone wants something different. Food: good, not great, but better than most chain restaurants. Atmosphere: what you'd expect, loud, noisy, ""family friendly"". Service: attentive, friendly, but management needs to work on scheduling because our food took quite a while and our own server complained abou being understaffed. BOTTOM LINE: Good chain option, decent food, portions that aren't overwhelming, overall good value. Yes, there is better food to be eaten in the area, but this is one place everyone will like that will fit into a budget/modest price point."
Alexis E.,"Reno, NV",0,18,3,4.0,8/23/2014,"This location has exceptional service compared to the Reno South location. Great food, clean restaurant, fantastic servers. We'll always come back to this location, and we'll never go back to Reno South!"
Scott B.,"Boise, ID",0,26,54,2.0,11/29/2011,"Overall they get stars for the beer; service was crummy, accommodations were crowded and the food was so-so."
Michael P.,"Yerington, NV",0,2,,3.0,6/2/2013,Food was great as always... service left something to be desired.I ordered a salad and never received it. Drinks took too long and so did order placing. Great food though
Fin T.,"Reno, NV",0,16,,3.0,8/18/2013,"I think the overall reviews are a fair representative of this restaurant.    Been here a few times and when they are busy, we have waited over 45 minutes for our food, only to come out incorrect.  Most memorable was when they had a kung pao chicken special and it was missing a few items listed in their product descriptions, including peanuts!  We were satisfied with how management took care of the problem but it does stick in our memory.  Parmesan Crusted Chicken is pretty darn good."
NewToReno B.,"Reno, NV",3,55,47,2.0,2/15/2014,"The food is always delicious. However, the service at the Sparks location has been TERRIBLE the last two times we've come here. On the most recent visit, if I hadn't caught it because the bill seemed so high, we would have been charged an extra $7. I also asked for extra spaghetti sauce, which they forgot to include in our take-out bag, as well as the garlic bread that came with our order! wow! Go to South Meadows instead of Sparks- they are always attentive and accurate!"
Stephanie C.,"Sparks, NV",352,353,555,4.0,7/10/2012,"What's not to love about BJ's?  It is in such a convenient location, the food is great, the menu is huge, the drink specials are good.  The wait staff is always friendly.  I love going there on Tuesdays for 1/2 price wine night."
Paul R.,"Sparks, NV",21,3,,2.0,7/14/2011,"I have had issues with service and order times.  The two sundays that I have been in (not back to back sundays) the time it took for us to order until we received our food was more than 45 minutes.  The last time we were here, we had multiple issues regarding our order, miscommunication with what was available and what wasn't.  Two of our party members were sick after having ordered the same item.  I love the South Virginia restaurant but I will not be returning to this location."
Kevin N.,"Reno, NV",56,343,35,4.0,3/3/2012,"This place has one of the widest menus of any chain I've ever seen.  The options range from pizza to burgers, Italian to Mexican, sandwiches to salads.  I think we usually end up at BJ's when we can't get everyone to agree on a particular type of food and everyone goes away happy.  The food is all okay.  Nothing I've had really stands out and nothing has left me disappointed.  The real highlight here are the beers.  The Harvest Hefeweizen is one of the better wheat beers I've had and the Pumpkin Ale that's available in Fall is like pumpkin pie in a glass."
Cody C.,"Sparks, NV",0,3,,3.0,6/20/2014,"I have mixed feelings about this place because the food is usually excellent but the service is terrible unfortunately. I'm not sure what their problem is because the staff is very nice but the food always takes way too long from the time you order to getting the food in front of you. If the food wasn't so great than I wouldn't go back but I continuously expect to wait 30 to 45 minutes to receive my meal. I give the food 5 stars and the service 1 star, which evens it out overall at 3 stars."
Yvette H.,"Sparks, NV",302,11,,2.0,5/9/2011,"The food is excellent, as expected. Unfortunately the service at this location has been repeatedly awful. Disappointing since they have a decent gluten free menu."
Richard R.,"Oxnard, CA",102,196,62,2.0,3/19/2011,Service ess not that great.  A couple of times the food runners came by after wer got our food and tried to give us some one elses food.  Not to mention that it took forever to get or order.  The soup in the bread bowl was really lacking soup.  On a positive note the place was clean.  I was overall disappointed.
Stevanne A.,"San Francisco, CA",160,86,2,4.0,12/9/2011,"Great place for good food plus huge range of beer. Lunch specials are of value especially soup and salad. Service was excellent each time we have been there. Ample portions and everyone can find something good to eat from appetizers to the dessert.  Berry Dessert was warm out of the oven and excellent. Places always vary a bit but this location strives for quality and teamwork. We were asked several times if everything was ok and each time it was plus its well situated, with a modern, clean and comfortable ambiance."
Elizabeth E.,"Encinitas, CA",96,58,83,4.0,3/11/2011,"I really like this place for lunch or dinner. Their teriyaki dishes are awesome and their fish tacos are great too. My only downside is that in their chicken pasta dish, they only added 2 broccoli florets and I love vegetables in my pasta so I would've been happier with more. Also ask for salad dressing on the side as they can drown the salad in dressing. Service is always great too. Overall a good restaurant with a huge selection of food and beers."
Carla M.,"Sparks, NV",2,33,7,5.0,12/14/2010,"When I saw that this restaurant only had a couple of stars, I decided it was time to fix that. I'd give this restaurant 10 stars if I could! They have excellent food at very reasonable prices, with A+ service. Some MUST TRY menu items are: Avacado Egg Rolls, Balsamic Chicken, Glazed Salmon, Berry Delicious (an alcoholic beverage), and of course their famous warm Pizookie (personally, I like Oreo the best). You really can't beat their prices for the quality of food. Everything is fresh, hot, and comes in large portions. I've visited their Sparks Legend's location 5 times, and their original Summit Location in Reno more than 15 times. Both locations have equally great food and service. One thing I refuse to deal with at restaurants is rude or snobby staff members - and I've never met one at either BJs. They go above and beyond, making sure you're satisfied with your order & that your drinks are full. Their full bar is quite impressive! It reaches the ceiling and is stocked to the max with just about every alcohol imaginable.  I saw that one person complained about their billing system - and yes, if there was one tiny thing I'd complain about, it is that. A couple of times, we've been given the bill before our meal was even finished. We would then need to add dessert ... and the waiter would re-tally the bill. Then we ordered some drinks.. the bill had to be done again. It seems kind of strange to go to all this work before a table is even done ordering! In another instance, we were given the bill ($60). The waiter took my card and came back saying it was denied. I looked at the new receipt, with a total of ($80). I told him that our bill stated $60, and the card had $70 available.  He had forgotten to add on our last round of drinks, which changed the total. But yet he neglected to inform us before running the card. That was a little irritating, but not a big deal. He apologized, and everything was fine.  I think they've made some positive changes to the billing issues.  When we were there 2 weeks ago, the waiter asked if we needed anything else before bringing the final bill, and even when we decided to add on 1 drink afterwards, he brought a new bill with the new total before charging the card.  All in all, BJs has provided a pleasant & fun atmosphere, stellar food, and friendly service. Would highly recommend BJs Brewery to anyone looking for great casual dining in the Reno & Sparks area."
Scott T.,"Reno, NV",2,5,,5.0,3/30/2012,"This is my and my girlfriend's favorite place to eat.  Its also the site of our first date. The bartenders are so personable and fun and the food...well, its simply amazing. The beers are cold and very tasty.  Jeremiah Red is my go-to. We've NEVER had a bad experience here and will DEFINITELY return, again and again."
Dale M.,"Candler, NC",4,26,,5.0,3/25/2012,"I ate here the evening of December 8th 2011. Out of all the restaurants I have been too across the USA, this restaurant was awesome! Very delicious food! The waiter did a fantastic job & refused to let me run out of my drink. We did wait about 15 minutes for our table, but as good as this restaurant is, I'm surprised we didn't have to wait longer to get in. The only disappointment is that this restaurant chain does not have is a location back in my hometown of Asheville, NC."
Wayne C.,"Sparks, NV",26,6,1,4.0,5/5/2011,"The only complaint I have is the lack of individual plates for the appetizers. Other than that everything was yummy. Had the roast beef dip, and a great time with the better half and a good friend. The nutty brunette was awesome."
