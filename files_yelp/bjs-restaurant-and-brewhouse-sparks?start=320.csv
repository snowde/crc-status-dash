Heather L.,"San Jose, CA",0,10,,2.0,5/25/2014,"It was a Saturday of a Holiday weekend and the seating was quick. I ordered a lunch portion of Shrimp Scampi with a side salad. The shrimp came encrusted in a panko type covering but I knew immediately it was still gray an withered. I have cooked shrimp several times at home and it becomes pink and rubbery. I was so fearful of sending it back but every single shrimp was undercooked. I received my ""re-fire"" less than ten minutes later to the same result. It wasn't just one again, so I know there must be an inexperienced chef in the kitchen. The Manager came out and advised that they have procedures to cook any type of seafood a particular amount of time and temp but there was something off. They didn't charge me the 19.95 and we ordered an appetizer and dessert of which neither was comped. I have had three bad experiences in a row at the BJ's in South Reno and was hoping it was an employee issue. I honestly think that it's the Reno management. I moved from SJ is the late Summer and we loved our BJ's. I will not go back again."
Alexandra W.,"Reno, NV",2,28,1,4.0,7/30/2011,"The food is exceptional and they have a great selection of food and drinks. I love the different beers and pairings with food. However, the service is not that great. It can be struggle to get drinks quickly from the bar. The last time I was there I had to talk to the manager because the kitchen screwed up my mom's order 3 times. Everyone else had almost finished and she still hadn't received her meal. The manager was apologetic and she comped the meal. Most of the time everything is fine."
Lyn H.,"Reno, NV",0,68,5,1.0,7/6/2012,"The service used to be just okay, now it's horrible. We arrived before 5P and waited more than ten minutes before our waitress came to our table. I could understand if it was busy, but the place was empty and we could see eight other staff members sitting on benches, standing behind counters...not helping customers...just openly chatting amongst themselves. Our waitress was very slow to bring our drinks and two of the six hot appetizers at our table were cold upon arrival at our table. When we received the bill, out waitress had ""upsold"" our drinks to top shelf liquor without telling us and drinks were outrageously expensive. I will never go back. there are plenty of places with great service that I will gladly pay $10 for a rum and coke. BJ's is not one of them."
Ian C.,"Reno, NV",0,5,,4.0,11/28/2013,Energetic atmosphere and good food. Great choice when you want some American food with some friends.  Occasional issues with service speed and order accuracy knock off a star but don't keep me from coming back.
Carlos M.,"Fresno, CA",36,23,18,4.0,4/7/2011,"i love the beer selection here. the brunette is probably my favorite brew. all appetizers are good. everyone loves the pizza here, but I'm not really a fan. They don't add enough cheese and all the toppings fall off as you lift a slice."
Paul P.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",0,7,,4.0,11/2/2011,"The food ,service  and atmosphere were all exceptional.  Had the grilled pork chops, the kids had a pizza and the wife had some pasta and we were all stuffed and very satisfied with everything.  This was the the first we had been to BJ's and will be definitely returning."
Michael L.,"Reno, NV",589,731,47,4.0,7/15/2011,Went for lunch the other day and I believe we were there around 2 pm. Not a lot of other folks but I am assuming we all arrived at about the same time since everyone was waiting quite a while for the food to arrive. But once it did all was good. Decent flavour and amount for lunch. so will be back.
Lula S.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,84,1,5.0,5/24/2011,Food and service have always been excellent here. Especially the flatbread pizzas. YUM.
Joelle K.,"Reno, NV",7,21,,4.0,10/11/2011,"Went for lunch with my  hubby. We had the Ahi Poke and Fried Artichokes. Both awesome. I had a blackened chicken sandwich and he had the chili cheeseburger. Both really good. The Stout was so yummy, the Peachberry tea could use a little more ""tea"". Service was awesome. As always I will be back."
Alex M.,"Berkeley, CA",2,30,3,4.0,1/14/2013,"BJs has been disappointing lately, I think a product of their rapid expansion leading to sloppy service and confused menus. Until now. My first good BJ since college, in Westwood. The menu seems reformed, simpler, solid choices. Pizza is as good as its ever been. Stuffed mushrooms were small...and delicious.  A really good appetizer for flavor and size. The service at this BJs was really stellar. Food and drinks came quick. In fact when our party's steaks came, they demanded to know if the temperatures were correct before they left. I was impressed. Would for sure come back."
Lisa D.,"Reno, NV",122,3,,4.0,3/5/2011,"I went to BJ's on a Friday and experienced a 45 minute wait, but it is quite a busy place for a Friday evening. Our service was good.  My guests enjoyed their tasty root beers and my friend recommended the Chicken Teriyaki dish, and that was a really good entree and recommendation."
Dre B.,"Oakland, CA",12,8,4,4.0,11/4/2012,I had the chance to try this place out while in Reno this pass weekend. I enjoy my meal and the staff was good. I found myself having a hard time making a decision from the menu cause I wanted to try so many different things can't wait to go back.
Joseph P.,"Sun Valley, NV",22,1,,1.0,6/10/2014,"My girlfriend and I stopped in at bj's after viewing a movie at the imax theater. We have never been there before so we stopped in for dinner . we were seated promptly. We put in a drink order right away bit it took 10 min. To get them. Order an appetizer (avacado rolls) and our main course. The rolls were all avacodo so very dissapointed in them for$10.50. Waitress said they were mad wrong but never offers to remake them or comp the rolls. Waited an hour and never got our maincourse. I orderd the mahi mahi girlfriend ordered tacos. Waitress came by said just a few more min. 10 min later came by again and said they had to cook my fish more cause it was still frozen. At this point I told her I have watched three table seated after us get there food and would like the check. Not saying the food is bad, I never ate there lol but frozen fish no thanks and the service was horrible. I will never go to bj,s again."
Sean W.,"San Jose, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/24/2010,"I've been to BJ's several times in the past few years, ever since they came to the Reno/ Sparks, NV area, and have had pretty good luck.  However, tonight, was by far the worst experience I've had at a BJ's, or any local place- as far as a waitress was concerned.  First off, the waitress was just aloof and seemed to avoid our table all together. Secondly, the meal took 45 minutes to get to our table.  With that said, I am used to that. It was a busy Saturday night, and I cant expect all waitresses at all pubs to be on top of their game all the time.  However, the thing that really pissed me off was that she actually dropped our tab at our table BEFORE we got our food. We did not choose to dine at Denny's tonight. We chose to dine at a Brewery. Our waitress (who was marked as ""Amy 289 A"" on our receipt) had to redo our ticket FIVE times because we kept ordering things. We weren't demanding unusual things- we are eating at a brewery, and most folks like to drink more than one beer and maybe enjoy a desert. Our waitress never asked us if we needed more drinks (including water) or even checked on the food.  At one point, after our 4th revised tab, I asked if she was getting off shift, because she was so determined to get us out of there. She said no, and then I ordered another beer, and Amy ACTUALLY ROLLED HER EYES.  Keep in mind that we were there for one and a half hours- not an unreasonable amount of time to spend at dinner.  I am not one to complain. At all. My wife and I were both servers in college, so we know what it's like to deal with difficult people. However, I could not help but complain this time. Amy was completely rude, and the service was abysmal. For God's sake, she works at a BAR, you would think she would want to sell more beer, desert, food...anything. This woman was completely opposite. I've never seen anything like it."
Michael W.,"Fernley, NV",0,5,2,4.0,7/7/2012,"I have eaten here two times before and swore that I would not come back again because of slow service; however, my other half asked me to give it a go one more time.  When I was seated, the seat had some liquid all over it that I had to ask for someone to clean up.  We ordered Seared Ahi salad, Thai Chicken salad, and watermelon with feta salad.  All the salads were very good and we left more than satisfied.  This go around the service was fantastic and the manager even made it around to make sure we were doing all right.  Defenite deference from my two prior visits.  We ate around 1:30 which could of made the difference."
Susan B.,"Reno, NV",9,8,1,5.0,6/28/2012,"Went to BJs on 6/27 for dinner with a friend.  It was his birthday.  We had the meatballs for an appetizer and then pork chops and the sirloin steak for the main meal.  All of it was excellent.  The meatballs were so yummie.  We had the best server who attended to our every need.  Good food, good service and reasonable prices.  I'll definitely go back again."
Dawn W.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2010,So excited to have BJ's open in sparks.   I took my daughter to dinner for girls night out.  Front person was not very friendly. He actually was complaining about another employee to another coworker when we walked up.  We were seated at 6:34pm.   Waiter Kevin came up we ordered Ahi poke a beer and softdrink.    He brought our drinks at 6:40.  When he brought them he said our appetizer will be right out and wanted to know if we wanted to order our dinner which we did.   Not two minutes later they brought out our salads. We had not recieved the Ahi yet.   Two minutes after that they brought out the Ahi.   We were at a table for two so not much room.  Time now 6:45.  6:47 they brought out our dinner.  Servers response was. Let's make room for all these plates.  We had our salads appetizer and dinner in less than 13 minutes. I am all for quick service but this was ridiculous.   We tried to find our waiter and had to ask for another server to get him for us.   The manager don came over and told us that they were on timers and just brought food out when ready.  They did not take into account that we were out to have a relaxing evening not have our food shoved down our throats in 15 minutes so they can flip the table.      Don gave us a business card for a free dessert on our next visit.   Walked out with our food in to go containers at 6:51.  Can't imagine having one more plate on the table if we did come back and have this happen again.    Very disapointed.
Laurel M.,"Roseville, CA",0,30,,4.0,10/21/2012,"Love the Rib Eye Steak!   Hate the servers wearing perfume!  WTF?  We're here to eat, and she walks up to our table stinking of some perfume she obviously LOVES...but hey, it's all I can smell and I don't agree with your choice.  So that glass of Greg Norman Cabernet...smells like her nasty perfume!  Ruined!   As I'm eating, I see her coming to the table...and I make her visit as brief as possible.  When she walks away, I fan the air with a menu...trying to chase away the smell of her perfume once again! I took half my steak home, to eat it without the small of perfume.  I asked management, and I was told the servers ARE allowed to wear perfume, and management doesn't feel they can tell them how much to wear.  REALLY?  You leave it up to them?  No matter what your customers experience?  I will not be bashful next time.  Next time, I won't hesitate to dismiss any server who's perfume over powers the air!  Next time, I will think of myself and not her feelings...and tell her that she STINKS TOO MUCH TO BE SERVING FOOD!  Alina was the server's name.  Never again Alina, never again!"
Brittany R.,"Boulder, CO",7,8,,5.0,2/18/2011,"I am very fond of BJ's Brewhouse and Restraunt, I'm still underage, but as far as gluten intolerance goes, they prepare your meal right. They have the gluten free pizza there and it is wonderful, I'll have the classic pepperoni or I'll ask for just the cheese and grilled chicken and some bbq sauce  to dip in, so good! I'm not yet 21, but will be in a few months, on which day I will be going back for another great pizza and their gluten-free beer, exciting. My family, boyfriend and I enjoy eating there, they are quick to serve drinks and take as little time possible to bring out one's food. My boyfriend and dad like and enjoy practically all the menu (haven't tried everything yet) and my mother and I share the gluten intolerance, but we enjoy the pizza. The cookies for dessert are delicious (had one before the Celiac thing hit me) and the calzones as well. They make their very own sodas as well, and they are so good, not too much carbon for those who appreciate less and still they are not overpowering sweet as most canned, bottled and tap sodas can be. I completely recommend this to any family and great things for gluten-intolerants, we can enjoy it too."
Miss B.,"Reno, NV",0,2,,1.0,11/30/2010,"We arrived, sat down quickly, and waited for our waiter. To start, he didn't understand really anything on the menu. We ordered 2 grilled chicken sandwiches, some soup, and some chicken tenders. He looked almost dumbfounded when my girlfriend was asking him about what comes on the sandwich.  Fast forward about 40-45 mins later (we went on a Monday at around noon with maybe 15 others in the restaurant) and our food arrives.  The bill arrives and it comes to almost 40 dollars. My mom pays some in cash, and I put the rest on my debit card. We wait for him to pick it up, and he goes to take care of it. Another probably almost 35 minutes go by, and he comes back, sets the bill on the table and just stands at the end of the table. I pick up the tab, and he ask's 3 times if everything is ok, did he do something wrong, etc. I say no(because at that point, everything on the bill looked to be fine), and he walks away. As he's walking away (my back is facing the front door so I can see him walk away), he turns twice and looks to make SURE we leave him a tip. Fast forward to the next morning, and I check my account. I WAS CHARGED FOR THE ENTIRE BILL. I call and speak to the manager (who seems like he doesn't know much about managing) and he said the waiter ""does not like to make mistakes, and when he does, he gets really awkward."" I tell him I was charged for the almost 40 dollars, plus what my mom paid in cash (which meant the server picked up a 20 dollar tip!!). He gives me the run around for 15 minutes about the bank this, the bank that, and how when the waiter realized what he did, the manager came over, canceled it, and re-debited my card for the 20 dollars. It's no big deal, it was an honest mistake I say, but why wouldn't the manager come over to our table and let me know? He kept saying things about the bank and I told him he wasn't answering my question. Why wouldn't the manager come over and tell me my CARD WAS CHARGED FOR 40 DOLLARS? They knew about the cancellation correct? He says yes and with a response of ""We don't normally go and talk to the customer because of how fast it goes through"" So you take 40 dollars from someone and you don't let them know? I told him I'd never go there again because it's too much of a risk, and the waiter was an idiot, along with the service I was getting from the management.  Food was mediocre, but the service was HORRIBLE."
