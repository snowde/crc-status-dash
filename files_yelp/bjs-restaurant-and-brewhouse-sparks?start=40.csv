Brianah M.,"Loma Linda, CA",30,8,,1.0,6/15/2017,"Omgsh sooo disgusted!  Last night my sister ordered a pizookie to go and while at home eating it, she found a piece of sausage in it! Okay, last time I checked, they weren't putting sausage in pizookies. Also- she's vegetarian, so that could have been really ugly. I'm so disappointed. I don't know if I will ever return to a BJs now that I have to eat my dessert real carefully in case the cooks decide to throw a part of someone's dinner in it."
Kelly W.,"Reno, NV",311,74,22,4.0,9/23/2016,"You can count on good food and good service the majority (95%) of the time. This time I got the Sriracha bacon chicken pasta and was slightly disappointed. Usually I never have problems though, just wouldn't suggest this guy. BJ's offers a variety of pizza, pasta, appetizers, burgers, and more. They offer some interesting combinations as well.  Service is great from the hostesses to the servers to the managers coming around and asking us how we are. Though it can be a little pricey they do offer a $10 off of $35 coupon which adds to be about a free appetizer!  Let's not forget the pizookies which should be a review on their own. Holy moly these are worth every calorie. I love the peanut butter one but I think it's seasonal. The monkey bread one is pretty good but let's be honest the cookie is the best part! Overall a 4/5 experience and I'm usually beyond satisfied with BJ's."
Melissa C.,"San Jose, CA",203,46,105,5.0,4/18/2017,Came here to satisfy my sweet tooth and I had no idea they have 3 dollar pizookie on Tuesdays. Soooo I ordered two.
Christine R.,"Reno, NV",34,8,,5.0,9/16/2017,So my hubby and I decided to go out for dinner last night with bjs being one of our favorite places that's where we went we called ahead made reservations waited 5 mins and had our table. Didn't have to wait long for our server to come over she took our drink order and put our appetizer in. Put our dinner order in the wait time didn't seem that long at all one of the managers came over and apologized for the wait and said he made some adjustments to our bill and brought us extra veggies that we both love! I do have to say even though the waited they took great care of us and they always do! Definitely a place I will recommend and keep coming back to!
chris k.,"Dublin, CA",0,17,1,1.0,10/8/2017,Not a great experience whatsoever.  The biggest let down is that they would not accept several online coupons nor did the discount for downloading the mobile ap.  I can stand places that bait and switch. Besides that the service was bad.  Dishes stacked up and rarely taken away.  Dishes came out ridiculously late... all for a party of 7. Would absolutely recommend skipping this place.
Gene C.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,2,4.0,7/7/2017,"I ordered from the BJ's app and it was all submitted and the order was pending but when we got there to pickup the food they said we didn't order and we have evidence that we did.I did not nothing wrong on my part because I ordered it like how I always do and every time I order it says the same thing about my order being sent in successfully and I would always get my food at the time I scheduled the order. They are like not taking credibility for this mistake and I assure you the order was sent in successfully but they are saying we didn't order and this puts me in a position where I am questioning myself and when I question myself it leads me to be stressed over the situation. This is the first time this has ever happened to me. Note:This review is based on the customer service and not the food.The food here is good and I will never hate the food but the fact that the order was placed and they say it wasn't makes me mad and having to reorder something that was already ordered online makes this even more difficult especially because you take 5 minutes of your time to order but instead you go and that time you took goes to waste just to order it again. I also believe that they could've possibly given my food to a different person making it seem like we are stupid and making the workers think we can't order. This is my first time leaving such review on BJ's customer service that I never thought I had to do but today was that day I had to. Good Day! (I sent this review to the wrong location and so I decided to post it to the correct location.I also wrote this comment because the person said we didn't order when they could've said something between the lines of ""The computers haven't been working so this is probably why we didn't get your order."") But this situation has now been resolved and now I would like to talk about how good the food is because I have ordered from here a lot and every time it has been wonderful and I would recommend you eat at this place if you have not done so already."
Riki H.,"Reno, NV",97,57,350,5.0,8/10/2016,"Always good food. There are so many thing to choose from. Leave room for one of their amazing desserts, my favorite is the Peanut Butter Pizooki with vanilla ice cream on top."
Kevin C.,"Sparks, NV",17,30,6,2.0,8/8/2017,"I always give my honest opinion on yelp cause I use yelp when I need a good dinner or whatever I need. So here is my honest opinion of my meal tonight at BJ's  service was horrible waitress talked to table across from us for at least 15 minutes could have been longer but we left. My wife loved her blackened salmon and I hated my Brewhouse burger the patty was in pieces at one point it had cheese but they scrapped it off, and meat had no flavor and the bread was so greasy. I've had better meals there before, so I will go back but this meal sucked giving 2 stars cause my wife's meal was good."
Jonathan H.,"Chico, CA",195,13,,1.0,9/24/2017,"Went here yesterday for my girlfriends birthday and unfortunately the service was very poor.  The wait wasn't too long to get seated but the appetizer took about 45 minutes to come out and our main course came out about a minute after that.  When my girlfriend ordered a drink the waiter said ""oh you must've had a birthday recently"" and when she said that it was today he didn't say one word and just rudely walked off.  At the end of our meals we wanted to get a pizookie and were charged for it when the couple next to us got one for free because apparently it was the guys birthday...interesting.  Won't be coming back to this establishment, which is a shame because most BJ's we have been to have excellent service and low wait times."
Sandy W.,"Reno, NV",0,33,,4.0,2/13/2017,"I like BJ's. It is a fun atmosphere. Staff is always friendly, and the place is always pretty busy. I usually order a pizza or one of their burgers. They are always good. I can't complain. Their beer is good as well. Sometimes there is a wait, but all good places have a wait, so I can deal with that. My husband loves sports. So we will often go in for a game. Location is also very convenient if you have been shopping for the day at the Legends."
Barbara J.,"Reno, NV",16,1,,2.0,9/17/2017,"My daughter & I had lunch here yesterday. My food was to die for but the waitress's lack of customer service left much to be desired. When she took our orders, she was very nice but never once came to check on us to ask how the food was, even when she brought us more water. My daughter's sweet potato fries were burnt so we couldn't even ask for more. When she brought our check, it was the wrong one and when she came back to collect our payment, I told her, all she said was 'you're right'. not even I'm sorry. I will eat here again because the food is so good. I wish we would've had a different server."
Klanci M.,"Minden, NV",1,11,12,4.0,1/10/2017,"We brought in a group of 5 adults, two children, and a baby. The baby was very tired and unhappy. Our waitress was great when helping the parents pack up their food to leave in the middle of dinner.  The food was great and very filling. To my surprise they had Gluten Free buns on their menu and when I ordered mine it was really soft and looked like a regular bun.  We have had two great experiences at the BJ's in Sparks. Thank you"
Bryan M.,"Reno, NV",0,8,,3.0,9/11/2017,"Even though we always love the food here, they just can't get the service right. It is always slow, and they often bring the appetizer out after the main course."
Buh L.,"San Diego, CA",73,4,7,1.0,4/14/2017,"We came in for happy hour, had to wait for 2 minutes until happy hour started and then waitress finally came back 15 min later and encouraged us to sign up for the BJs rewards and download the app. We ordered drinks and food. Stayed for about an hour. We were about to leave and the waitress reminded us that we got a free pizzookie  for signing up. Upon getting the bill we say we did not get the coupon for our free pizzookie. We gave the code and then got our bill sayin we had to pay for it. Then she checked with her manager and he said no we couldn't use it because it said we already used it even though we had never been there before and had just signed up for the app!!! Never going back. Happy hour discount is a joke. And the service was terrible even though no one was there."
Samantha W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,9,,5.0,9/9/2017,"Our server, Jonathan, was very helpful, professional and nice! It was my 1st time, but my friend is a frequent diner. Jonathan was so helpful. He even was kind enough to recommend to me his top 5 dishes. I will definitely return to BJ's again.. Great experience!"
Adam J.,"Reno, NV",102,97,1,4.0,1/9/2017,"4 of us did lunch after a movie, place was semi-busy however we were seated within a couple min of waiting.  Drinks were delivered quick and waiter was great to point out some lunch specials.  Our party has some peculiar tastes and sensitivities (low cal, and GF people with us) so its always refreshing to see a menu that address that. Ordered the bison burger, added fresh jalapeno (what came out was pickled) and another ordered the bison burger with some specific requests (no bun, tomato and avocado only) waiter confirmed her order and suggested a lettuce bun, and she agreed nice catch.  Other 2 meals were the chicken tacos, and I believe a western burger.  Some had fries some did salads, and again kudos to the waiter asking if we want salads prior to main or with main.   Service is on point another round of beers is ordered, not a fan of light beers but was in the mood for a lager and the standard lager there pouring here drinks easy.  Meals come everything looks great except the lettuce wrap burger comes with everything on it, which is a bbq sauce and pepper relish, had to address this, waiter said no problem would get an immediate re-fire.  Manager came over apologized and let us know the ETA on the new burger is 3 min out and he would in turn be delivering it.  True to their word 3 min go by and burger comes out perfect. On other visits I've had better food or worse service but the place gets a consistent 4 stars from me, I've done drinks and bar food at the bar, bigger events here, and just normal evenings out and I just appreciate a place with consistency.  Check them out on a Tuesday great wine specials and discounts."
John T.,"Escondido, CA",59,220,470,4.0,8/12/2016,"Good food and drink here. The service was fast and efficient. We had a large party and BJ's was very accommodating. We ordered three pizzas and chips and salsa. Get the deep dish, it is fantastic!  Atmosphere is great too, lots of televisions showing a variety of sports. Prices are a little high, but it's pizza served to you so quit yer wining!!"
J D.,"Reno, NV",38,98,2,3.0,8/3/2017,"I'd give them a 4/5 for the food, except that the quality of it tends to be inconsistent. I love the jambalaya, but sometimes I come and it is excellent; other times it is dry and the shrimp is overcooked. This seems to be the case among both the Sparks and the South Reno locations."
Tamera T.,"Redding, CA",12,5,1,2.0,8/24/2017,Disappointing calamari-- tepid. Ordered it with honey mustard sauce and it wasn't delivered with that. Had to ask twice.
John S.,"Reno, NV",0,4,,5.0,8/22/2017,"Always consistent, always good food. I've never had  an issue with quality or timeliness of service. Admittedly, we always sit at the bar to catch up on some baseball, eat and have a couple of quality BJ beers so service issues are never an issue, particularly when Jeremy is on shift. Great bartender, knowledgeable quality conversation and always... always more than courteous."
