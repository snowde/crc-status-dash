Michael R E.,"Reno, NV",564,39,20,5.0,8/6/2017,One of my all-time favorite eateries for sure!  Love their selection of robust dark full-bodies brews and a great menu to pick from!  Always polite and courteous servers.
Heather S.,"Gilbert, AZ",12,39,6,1.0,6/12/2017,"We did call ahead seating and were told we'd be seated right away. Instead they gave tables to 5 parties that walked in after we called, even though it only took us 15 minutes to get here. So now we're having to wait at least 20 minutes, on the night of my nephew's graduation. Totally ridiculous."
Pakou X.,"Fresno, CA",0,15,,3.0,8/6/2017,Good food. Server was ok. Not as attentive. Had to take a drink from my husbands cup because my cup was empty and i didnt get a refill. The food took a while to come out even though it was lunch.
Kevin C.,"Reno, NV",7,13,,4.0,5/7/2017,"Fantastic food, unbelievably friendly service, and the location and building is excellent. Only knock is that it is a little on the expensive side. Two appetizers and two drinks ran us about $60 with tip. Great atmosphere and menu though and I would definitely recommend!"
Aanchal T.,"Reno, NV",28,7,,5.0,2/25/2017,This place has always bought a smile on my face. Awesome cuisine. great innovation with veggies and meat. i appreciate their service a lot. loved their Mediterranean pizza and stuffed mushrooms. Recently also tried their artichoke starters that were superb!!!  My server Lonnie is so welcoming and makes my dinner a fab memorable treat for me!
Robert B.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",19,8,1,5.0,8/3/2017,Great food great service. Wonderful atmosphere. Food is out of this world. Staff are awesome and always willing to serve....
Bill S.,"Reno, NV",53,105,248,4.0,4/29/2016,"So what do you get with an 18 page menu? A headache trying to figure out what to order.  So we started with appetizers; fried artichokes and calamari. Dinner was awesome, the hickory brisket burger is worth every penny you pay. I was a wimp and used a fork and knife, it was to messy. I now have leftovers for tomorrow as they give you a big portion. The appetizers were awesome and the service was good. The best part for you sports fans, the NFL draft was playing. Yelp offered a discount which was a nice surprise."
Sophia R.,"Sparks, NV",152,101,47,4.0,3/25/2017,"I haven't read anyone else's reviews, but I have had two good experiences here. They said the wait was going to be 30-40 minutes on a Friday night, and while we were waiting a server gave us mini slices of pizza to munch on. It was only about a 15 to 20 minute wait and we were seated. Our server was Amanda, she was very efficient and had a great personality. Drink orders and appetizer order were taken when she greeted us. Appetizers came out pretty quickly, but the food took quite a while, however it was very busy on a Friday night so I'm not going to dock it a star. I only ordered the monkey bread pazooki and the mozzarella sticks. Both were really good however I feel as if the prices here are super high for what you get. Almost  $11 for an appetizer of mozzarella sticks, and at Applebee's you get the same thing for $3 or  $4 less. Overall the atmosphere was nice, our server and the wait staff were attentive, and the food was good but pricey which is why I rated 4 stars."
Dorine S.,"Sun Valley, NV",7,8,,3.0,1/29/2017,"Sat in the bar thinking it would be quicker. We ordered food avocado egg rolls, arugula yellow beet salad, Brussel sprouts & cheddar broccoli bread bowl, regular 12oz beer, Dr Pepper & water. Pretty quick meals.  Avocado rolls came first, then we waited a good 25 minutes for the food.  Our waiter never acknowledged or said sorry for the long wait.   He didn't get a great tip."
Chase F.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,26,4,5.0,6/22/2017,"My SO and I go here at least once every 2 weeks. We love the value you get for your money, the salads are great, and their pizookies are amazing. I know they are a chain restaurant, but this one in particular has always given us good, prompt service"
Cheri P.,"Vancouver, WA",207,60,37,5.0,9/23/2016,WOW- we enjoyed a wonderful evening at BJ's. We were greeted warmly and the food was great. The highlight- however- was definitely Brook. He took care of our table and was engaging and thorough. Such a great attitude and amazing smile to boot. Brook had no idea that we had just lost our Father and were taking a break from going through the process of cleaning out his business and taking care of his estate. You never know when your elevated level of service provides MORE than just a dining experience. Thank you Brook- we appreciated you!
Dan W.,"Sparks, NV",14,39,10,4.0,2/24/2017,Haven't had a bad meal or a bad beer here yet.  Always great service and a huge selection of food.  Not only do they have a good selection of house brews on tap but they always have an excellent selection of local micro brews.  Pizza and burgers are the best but the ribs aren't bad either.  Everything comes in big portions and the prices are good.  We probably hit them for lunch or dinner...or maybe just stop by for a beer...at least once month
Vanessa M.,"Sparks, NV",138,110,521,4.0,8/26/2016,"I thoroughly enjoy this place.  I've always been seated rather quickly no matter how long the line or list is when I get my name on it.  They are quick to take our drinks orders and check pretty regularly to see if we are ready to order appetizers or entrees.  Serving staff is always attentive and friendly.  Out of the many times I have been here I don't think there has every been a time that I was not pleased with my order.  Usually I always order the Avocado Eggrolls no matter what because they are the absolute best ever!!!  Last night, though, was not an Avocado Eggroll night.  I was still very very pleased with my dinner.  I am trying to behave so I ordered from the Enlightened Menu and sometimes worry about the lack of excitement or flavor in those meals.  Though I have had some pretty tasty ones in the past they weren't usually exploding with deliciousness flavor as you hope for.  Well this time was the exception for me.  I ordered the Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken and it was AMAZING!!! SOOOO much flavor and such a fantastic variety of flavor in one dish.  IT was so delicious that I am actually excited about going back and ordering it again.  My friends ordered the Jambalaya and the Parmesan Chicken Wings.  They seemed to both gobble those up pretty quickly too so I am taking that to mean a big thumbs up on their dinners as well. So for an evening with no Avocado Eggrolls I still say it ws a Major Success!!!!!!"
Debbie M.,"Reno, NV",0,6,,1.0,10/13/2017,"We decided to try BJs once again after being disappointed before. However, they didn't put their best foot forward once again tonight! The waiter forgot our appetizer, then our dinners weren't right. The Asst Manager had our dinners remade, but we had to wait yet again! This place is inconsistent to say the least! They should really try to train their waiters the same way as well as train their cooks how to make the dinners correctly. Very disappointed once again!"
Tracy N.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,1.0,9/23/2017,"Terrible service - and we didn't even sit down.  First off, phone tree on the number listed didn't go any where and no one answered the phone with a number of tries.  When we came to the restaurant, with a ""large"" party of 15 - we were told that there was a 2hour wait.  Walking around the restaurant, there were many open tables that would have easily accommodated the party.  ""Sunshine"" at the hostess desk was not helpful and was obviously not going to make it happen."
Eric M.,"Reno, NV",0,9,1,2.0,7/10/2017,"First time here, with a group from work. Service is good. Food Is underwhelming. Too many choices of the same fried and pre-prepped stuff wrapped many different different ways. Type of place that reminds me that we Americans don't know how to eat well and deserve our overweight and un-healthy population."
Maxine T.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",9,41,20,4.0,5/21/2016,"Update: The manager did contact us to personally apologize and make amends for our previous disappointing experience . +2 stars for good customer service! I will visit this branch again to give it another try, and hopefully have a more pleasant visit. Two thumbs up for the manager, Darrin!"
Lucy C.,"Ashland, OR",0,19,5,3.0,6/13/2017,I ordered takeout from Bjs the pizza was delicious.. the artichoke spinach dip was amazing!! I had the fried asparagus omg!!! But the lettuce wraps weren't so hot.. the children was chopped and the sauce was not carmalized like usual it was watery.. gross.. but everything else was amazing! A little expensive for some appetizers but hey..
Occupy A.,"Phoenix, OR",45,27,9,3.0,11/27/2016,"OVERALL FOR OCCUPYADVENTURE COUPLE: 3  Genuine +1 Correct order +1 Cleanliness +1 Value -1 Overall taste +1 OVERALL FOR OCCUPYADVENTURE: Ridiculously over priced. We had four drinks a salad, a soup and buffalo wings. It was 80$ we won't be returning. -1  The server was helpful in choosing beers. Good selection! +1  Restrooms and restraunt were clean +1 OVERALL FOR MISSOCCUPYADVENTURE: The server never got us menus. I had to go to the front of the restaurant and get them myself. While I was at the host stand, i asked for menus and was ignored. So I grabbed them myself.  Had to wait for server to get us silverware while our food sat on the table. -1  The Buffalo wings were yummy and so was the salad. +1"
Deanna L.,"Sparks, NV",320,131,813,4.0,2/26/2016,"The food and service in both locations is always solid, but we frequent Sparks.  The beer selection is great and their beer is pretty damn good.  We really love the Mahi tacos and they have a happy hour.  Lately, we have been sitting at the bar.  Tonight we are with Josh and he is awesome!  Funny and prompt are excellent qualities in an employee!"
