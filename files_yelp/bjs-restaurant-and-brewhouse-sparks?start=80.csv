Lauren R.,"Reno, NV",72,20,37,3.0,8/9/2016,"I showed up at BJs on a Friday night at 7:30 to a packed parking lot and expected to be there forever. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated in about 15 min.  In the past my experiences at BJs have been hit or miss. My last trip a month or so ago was a hit. My Ahi Salad was delicious, perfect even. It looked just like the picture and was crisp and refreshing on a hot summer day.  Friday night I decided that I would give the Ahi Salad another go since it was so delicious the time before. I was sadly disappointed. This time it looked nothing like the picture, had no wanton crisps, no wasabi and was drenched in the dressing. The last few bites were completely inedible because they had so much dressing.  The one redeeming thing about the night was our server Nicole. She was attentive and hilarious."
Patricia G.,"Sparks, NV",81,158,1533,5.0,2/20/2015,Had a wonderful lunch this afternoon. Had the very best fried artichoke hearts with a yummy dipping sauce. Well surely have that again. Had the all you can eat soup and salads for 8 bucks. Awesome blue cheese wedge salad and broccoli cheddar soup. My friend had Ceasar salad  and 2 soups tomato bisque and clam chowder. Very relaxing lunch good service also.
Beth H.,"Patterson, CA",0,7,1,1.0,8/8/2017,"Ordered 3 appetizers! Stuffed mushrooms, calimari, and spinach artichoke dip needless to say they all came out COLD! I will never eat there again!! Food was GROSS!"
Jilyn D.,"Reno, NV",26,6,1,4.0,6/3/2017,"This place has a wide variety of food choices.  I usually go for the soup and salad combo with a bread bowl, so good! The service has always been great.  Prices are a little higher, but there are still affordable options."
Melissa B.,"Sparks, NV",39,70,104,4.0,8/1/2016,"Stopped into BJ's on Saturday afternoon about 1pm.  Parking lot packed, but there was no wait for a party of two.  Yay.  Took waiter a few minutes to get to us, but that was fine, they were very busy and it gave us a chance to look over the menu.  I ordered an Alabama Sunset to drink and the half sandwich and small salad (California Chicken Club and Twisted BLT salad) for lunch.   Let me say, my drink was scrumptious.  I should have ordered two right away...maybe it was that delicious.  Maybe it was because it was like 98 degrees outside and I really needed a frosty beverage...not sure, don't care.  It was delicious.  Yumm.   Salad came first.  I guess I didn't read the menu, not sure, but it came with dressing already on it.  I do not like that unless it is a Cesar and I expect it.  I always want my dressing on the side.  This was some sort of heavy vinaigrette.  I gave it a chance and tried it.  Did not like it at all.  I usually like my bacon, egg, tomato type salads with a creamy dressing.  I told the waiter that I just did not want the salad as the dressing was no bueno.  He immediately offered a new one with a dressing of my choice.  So, I said Blue Cheese or Ranch, either.  He said, I will bring both and a new salad.  Came back in a few with my new salad, and I ordered another drink.  Salad with Blue Cheese was delicious. Spinach salads, I like, especially with bacon.  Sandwich was up a few minutes later.  It was on toasted sourdough, lots of avocado...very good.  Perfect size salad and half sandwich for lunch.  Service was great, food was good.  I was a fan.  My only complaint...not even really a complaint was that the drink was very pricy.  $8.25 for a cocktail at lunch.  Glass was filled to top with ice, so not really a lot of drink in it.    It wasn't like the huge old school ""Trader Dicks"" cocktails that we were all spoiled with in the 90's and 2000's.  Just a regular cocktail.  I mean it was good, don't get me wrong, but $8.25 a tad bit pricy for this type of place. I expect high prices in some places for drinks, just not here.   Oh well, it was good.  Like I said, not really a complaint.  It was delicious...and I will order one again.   So all in all...I give it a yay and we will go back."
Cindy N.,"Sparks, NV",0,20,3,2.0,5/29/2017,"As our first and probably last visit, we were not impressed.  Upon arrival we were told to wait for ten minutes and so we did---for a table that was already open.  We had been seated and given some napkins and silverware . Thirty minutes later after trying to flag down ANY server, we were asked about drinks and given more napkins. But that wasn't until the server served two tables that arrived way after us.  Our food was pretty looking but pretty taste-less .  The table was NEVER bussed until the very end of our stay.  I understand it was a holiday and a server was ""no-call-no-show,"" but it could've certainly been handled better.  We definitely are disappointed in our experience because we had heard such great things about the place and it was a total bust."
Alyssa Y.,"Sparks, NV",461,225,151,4.0,3/1/2015,"BJ's is always a great go-to place when you don't know exactly what you want to eat. They have an excellent variety of menu options and they will satisfy everyone's hunger. The staff are all very friendly and their meals are always delicious. I personally love the California Chicken Club sandwich.  No matter how full you are, be sure to order their Pizookie for dessert. These half baked cookies with ice cream are delicious. If you can't choose one flavor, choose two and they will bake the Pizookie half/half."
James B.,"Sparks, NV",232,143,189,4.0,1/14/2016,"Went there this afternoon for lunch to enjoy the BOGO lunch deal.  I called ahead and ordered two black and blu burgers with fries and extra aioli sauce.  I was told fifteen minutes.  I arrived in about 13 minutes.  Emily greeted me and worked on getting my order ready. About fifteen minutes later, had to wait on fries, I was on my way.  The burger was one of the better burgers in the area."
Sierra B.,"Sparks, NV",0,6,4,2.0,5/3/2017,"My boyfriend and I went here the other day and the food was ok the fish I ordered did not taste fresh for lightly seared fish it was really dry. My boyfriend liked his meal for the most part except for the fact that he drank his lemonade before are meal arrived and was never give a refill until he had to flag the waiters down and ask for one which was hard enough to do since I seemed like are waiter had more important things to do like flirt with other staff, On that note the food was decent I probably won't go back for a while or a least not to that location."
Shawna G.,"Reno, NV",80,63,6,1.0,6/20/2016,"This place is disgusting. Every time I've eaten there I've found something in my food that shouldn't be there. In August, I had pizza there and there was plastic in it. It looked like the zip closure on a giant plastic bag. I complained and they simply took the pizza away. Yesterday, I'd gotten over the last incident enough to try it and had spaghetti with a caesar salad. The meatball had an unrecognizable, hard, LARGE chunk of something in it. I tried to eat a few bites of salad and every piece was dark, wilted and looked like they were trying to offload it before it went bad.  I'll never eat there again. I'm done with almost throwing up every time I come here."
Chris L.,"Reno, NV",2,59,23,2.0,3/17/2017,"This place is way overrated. I have met many business associates here for some reason they like this place. The food has no flavor, the service sucks unless you are a cute little blond. I only wish I could convince my associates into meeting any place else. If I know I got to meet them here I will eat first and just go and order a beverage. They do get those right so why they get a two star not a one."
Chris W.,"Reno, NV",1,6,1,4.0,4/22/2017,"Good service. I always love coming here for a good beer, good pizza, and nice TV display for the games"
Lisa R.,"Reno, NV",5,97,4,4.0,7/20/2016,I would have given five stars but they took my favorite item (the Thai chicken mango salad) off the menu.  They have a rewards program which adds up fast for $10 or $25 off a meal.  Plus they send out emails with special offers all the time.  I've enjoyed meals at four different BJ's and they are all good and consistent.
Dean M.,"Harrisburg, SD",54,10,3,5.0,4/16/2016,Beer 9/10 Food 8.5/10 Ambiance 8/10 I had the IPA I believe the name was hop storm it is very hoppy but had a great balance. The black cherry float was full of flavor but wasn't sweet like I anticipated. I had the triple Decker and BLT salad the wife had grilled cheese. And everything was great Our server was a very personable guy by the name of Juan and was truly the highlight of the already awesome experience.  Not only do I recommend but look forward to going back next time I'm in the Vegas area.
N D.,"Reno, NV",68,28,6,4.0,1/20/2017,"Service was good and attentive without being there every second.  Food was very good.  I had Salmon and my  husband had a burger.  His burger was a bit dry, so they lost a star. We always eat desert first, which should be the norm!  We had a trio of cakes with ice cream. Very good, except the monkey bread was dry.  We will go back"
Addison G.,"Tempe, AZ",22,91,4,2.0,12/20/2016,"I was extremely disappointed with tonight's service.  Firstly, I have Celiacs and have always appreciated their gf menu. The balsamic chicken was my favorite. WAS. Apparently they removed it from the menu. You removed the best gluten free dish you had. The only other options now left are either a rib eye (yeah, you're trying real hard to be gluten free), and a few other dishes that really only people with specific tastes will like, which I didn't have. Having Celiacs, I'm already limited in what I can eat, and now you've removed really the ONE gf dish I did like? I doubt we'll ever be returning to BJ's because of this decision.  Not only that, but the staff really didn't understand what gluten free meant. That is always the most important thing to me, that the staff be properly trained in understanding gluten. It was obvious they did not here. The service was also subpar tonight. While our waitress was friendly, the service and receiving our food was extremely slow (it's a Tuesday night! Hardly anyone was there!). Our food took way longer than average to arrive.  All other servers/hosts were curt and not very friendly. Disappointed, and will not return."
Marie C.,"Stockton, CA",0,8,1,5.0,8/14/2017,"Came in for lunch, not too busy, we were seated right away. Two of us ordered lunch specials and my other friend ordered superfood salad. They forgot some ingredients but our server Bryson, who was training Leanne quickly fixed the situation by replacing her salad with another one. The manager, Ed, brought the salad out and offered his apologies. The customer service was extraordinary here, very impressive. The food was good, would definitely return when in this area."
Erica W.,"Sparks, NV",47,9,3,1.0,12/1/2016,"I have a small group of friends that get together regularly for lunch and dinner.  We have tried BJ's twice and both times we were beyond disappointed.  The first time the service was slow despite not being busy at 2:00 on a weekday. The food was OK. The second time we were greeted and seated quickly, but the table was sticky and small for our group.  We asked that we be moved to a larger table or booth if one came available.  We were quickly moved and then forgotten.  It took the better part of 45 minutes to get someone to come take our drink order and bring us menus.  Then after many attempts to get help from various servers we had someone come take our order but we never received drinks.  After another 45 minutes, we still had no food and no drinks. Finally, one person in our group went to the hostess station to talk to a manager.  The manager came to the table and appologised and said he would look into it.  Eventually, the orders came. Many were wrong and they were all cold. My chicken was undercooked, one sandwich order was soggy, and one fish plate came that we didn't even order. Everything that could go wrong did.  When we were finally done we couldn't get anyone to bring us our check.  The manager was very unconcerned with the whole situation.  He offered to comp us for the fish (Which we didn't order anyway) and bring us a dessert of our choice.  We declined. At this point, our meal had taken the better part of 3 hours.  I have visited this same location other times with family and had similar experiences.  Do yourself a favor and chose a different restaurant. There are plenty to choose from in the same shopping center. If I could give this NO stars I would."
Linda B.,"Reno, NV",0,9,,5.0,8/22/2017,"This time 5 stars.  We were invited back by the manager.  The service was exceptional.   Sam was our waiter, great attention to the service he gives.   Great sense of humor and all around total change from our previous experience.  Food was tasty and wonderful.  Would definitely come back."
Taylor S.,"Sparks, NV",145,6,32,4.0,4/29/2016,"Meh. Thats the thought in my head after today's dinner at BJs Brewery in Sparks. I feel this place is extremely overrated, I mean if you walk in an establishment with a revolving door, you expect to eat the food of Gods. It was just regular ol' if you ask me.  They brew their own beer, so I thought I'd try the Hopstorm IPA. It wasn't too great, it just tasted like a regular Bud light with some IPA flavored mio drizzled on top.  I had some fried calamari for an appetizer and it was pretty good. Nothing special however as it was just fried calamari with marinara and lemon pepper aioli, but alas, I like both of those things. The Hickory Brisket Burger was my entree of choice tonite, it comes with a lean burger cooked to order smothered with sweet and tangy barbecue sauce, hickory smoked bacon, red onion, amd chedder-jack cheese. It was too big to handle in one session so I took the rest home to devour later. All of that came on a nice hearty portion of crispy fries. Delicious.  I give it four stars because it was good, but not great."
