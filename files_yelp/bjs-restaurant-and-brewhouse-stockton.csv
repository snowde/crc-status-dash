Garrett H.,"Orem, UT",10,8,,4.0,1/5/2018,"If you're coming here expecting a BJ, turn around! This place has some great food and serve about anything the heart desires. Their menus are about the same size as Webster's dictionaries and they have them in braille as well so blind people can eat there too.  For dessert, I would recommend a pazookie. It is a delicious fresh baked cookie cake that comes out on a hot platter.  The waitress was nothing to write home about; which is great because I could solely focus on my food and nothing else- No distractions!  Anyways, there was no oral sex, but great food !"
Shannon A.,"Hayward, CA",11,102,24,2.0,12/16/2017,"We came here for a work ""holiday "" lunch, it wasn't busy and the server was polite. We all ordered and the food was served within a decent time.  Upon getting our food my co worker noted that her portabella burger was literally cold.. then I took a bite of my black and blue burger, literally raw inside, and to top it off my other co workers burger was raw as well.  The mgr came over and offered soup or salad, which was of course nice, but I honestly think the meals should have been comped. Because upon getting my burger back it was 1 :much smaller  and 2: I'm pretty sure it was like kinda cut up- basically it was real sloppy- but I wasn't going to complain because that's not my style.  With that, they definitely have areas to improve on because it definitely wasn't busy enough to be so ""sloppy "" but like I said the waiter and manager were very polite."
Paul-James R.,"Stockton, CA",59,1,,4.0,10/19/2017,"Me and my girlfriend come here for dinner many times, mostly for the drinks and the pizookies.   To start off, sometimes the hostess(es) can be a bit hit or miss in terms of being greeted and feeling welcome as we've came in before with them talking to each other with their attention turned away from the entrance; it's not too much of an issue though as we haven't just been completely ignored.  However tonight the hostess was awesome (wish I caught the name on the way out) in both greeting us and also helping us with a server issue we had so just depends on who's working that particular day. Speaking of which, the service can also be a huge hit or a big miss as well depending on who you get.  Just to get straight to the point, I believe that their waiter Miguel should be reevaluated in his customer service as he is the first waiter I've had to both: not tip at all due to poor service and request a new server which I had just done tonight.  Our first time (and really only time) we had him as our server, he was slow and barely visited our table even though he seemed very attentive to other tables around ours.  I've had to bother our runners who brought our food instead for any needs such as just a simple refill of waters, which I hate doing since the runners aren't getting the tip of my check at all under my assumption so why should I bother them and not my actual server.  I wish I could list all the other negatives in his service but it was awhile ago and was lucky enough to not have him for the next few visits afterwards, but his name stuck with me and always comes to mind as to what I should avoid when I visit.   If you want an awesome server though, Kayla and Cara (spellings for both??) are names I try to keep in mind to know when I have a waitress I can count on.  If you get them, leave a generous tip.  James as well was very attentive tonight and I wouldn't mind having him again.  And when the food does get to you, I've no complaints at all.  So yeah, I'll keep coming when I need a beer and have a big appetite; their burgers (like all of them but I wish they still had wedges) and pizzas (California Supreme is the only one I've tried but also kinda hard for me to stray away from) are usually my go-to's with their steaks as well when I feel like paying a bit more."
Tiffany R.,"Stockton, CA",96,131,344,5.0,9/17/2017,"This is based on my most recent visit to BJ's. I came in on a Friday night and considering how busy it usually is, we called in ahead of time to get our name on the list. We waited less than 5 minutes before we were brought to our table.  Our server was very hospitable, and made us aware of the deals they had going on. For instance, if you sign up and download the BJ's Brewhouse app, you get a free pizookie! It was my sister's birthday dinner the night we went, so we got 2 free pizookies that night! All our food was great. I ordered a 14 oz ribeye steak (cooked medium) and it was perfection! My sister ordered the same thing, but medium well, and unfortunately it was as dry as a well-done steak. One of our entrees took an extra 10 minutes to get to our table, so to apologize for the inconvenience, the manager gave us that entree on the house. Our server was really sweet, as she honored my sister's request to get her free pizookie without the whole birthday singing commotion. But she participated in silently singing happy birthday to my sister, haha! Good food, great service, and definitely coming back for that juicy 14 oz ribeye."
Abbey R.,"Lodi, CA",2,19,6,1.0,1/7/2018,"Every time I have come in the service has been literally terrible!! It takes a good 10-15 minutes for your server to get to my table. Last time I came in it was not an enjoyable experience and Natalie our server was rude and inattentive. I get it's late and you don't want to be there but it's your job and if you don't want to serve then get a new job. On top of that when we asked for a side that we order she got so mad and slammed a glass on the table cracking it, what really set my table off was that she took her sweet time getting us silverware once our food had already arrived. I watched her talk to the host stand, walking back and forth as if she was taking her time on purpose to get our utensils. On top of that I ordered the spaghetti and meat balls and the meatballs were so mushy and inedible. Over all terrible experience and will not be returning."
Antonio A.,"Ceres, CA",61,5,1,4.0,1/9/2018,Good food good service and reasonably priced. Really enjoyed the deep dish pizza and the pazookie. They offer a wide variety of meals and lunch combos are really filling and tasty. Can't wait to return.
Didi O.,"Stockton, CA",63,106,604,4.0,7/6/2017,"So it's Thursday night nothing to do and I'm hungry so to brighten up my sons mood . Why not . Here I don't have to think what I want to eat . Everything is pretty much here. It's not pack coz it's a regular day . We were seated right away and gave our orders  pretty fast . Very cool . I mean we come here and always with a big group and our meal takes forever . So tonight is a good night and I deserve to have a good meal . And I did .     Bottom line :   Cleanliness : 9 out of 10    Service  : helpful ,  fast when not busy    Price : reasonable    Taste : very good    Will I recommend : I don't think I have to    Will I come back :  well yeah I always come here unplanned ."
Bre M.,"San Ramon, CA",5,16,7,5.0,11/18/2017,Went here last night by default of BWW giving poor service. And I think to myself WHY THE HECK DIDN'T WE COME HERE FIRST!! UGH.  BJs service was AWESOME!!! Hostess sat us down right away.  Waiter came by to greet us and tell us he would be right with us (had to drop food at another table) as soon as he was done with his other table he came right over to us.  Took our drink order and shortly after came back for our food order.  Now we only went to BJs after having terrible service at BWW down the street. But the service was totally APPLES TO ORANGES. I rarely eat in Stockton as it is but I know now BJs is on my list of places TO go to.
Patricia G.,"Kelseyville, CA",6,16,2,5.0,12/12/2017,"We had a wonderful dinner after an afternoon of Christmas shopping. Our waitress, Kara was the absolute best!  Her recommendations for wine and dessert  were spot on Kara is a fabulous waitress and a real asset to the BJ staff in Stockton . Hoping she is our server the next time we stop by."
Dianna O.,"Berkeley, CA",5,92,99,4.0,9/5/2017,"I thought they were closing down, but glad they're still open and doing business. I love coming here for their happy hour from 4pm-6pm, which I believe is only from M-F. Their 4 tasters for $6-7 is not a bad deal especially with the wide selection of beers they offer.  During our last visit, we ordered a bunch of appetizers to share with the group and just rounds of pitchers. I've recently tried their churro pizookie. It was basically a churro cut into smaller pieces with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream to top it off.  Servers were a bit slow on Fridays and weekends and that's pretty much expected."
S. Jeff S.,"Stockton, CA",39,43,17,1.0,11/20/2017,"Always a hit or miss here... this was an absolute miss. Slow service and a burger and cole slaw that make a day old Big Mac and a KFC side look good. Usually when I leave the majority of the meal on the plate a waiter will ask what was wrong. BJ's is usually a pretty safe bet to get decent food, not so much at this place. Chilli's on a bad day is way better. Only good point was that the server was nice."
Evai D.,"Stockton, CA",225,12,1,1.0,6/6/2017,"Last night with my Sisters from Hawaii and Missouri, now granted we have lots of eatery but I wanted something where we could all pick different foods. SMH Greeted with a hostess who led us to this small as table for a party of 6 when there were tons of open booths. I don't remember our waitress's name, dont' even remember If she told us smh. Heres what went wrong- from beginning of the dinner to the end. Waitress asked for our drink orders and we gave her our orders but she had this hurry up and order look on her face, strike one I will let that go.  As my sisters and I talked and laughed about our lives and where we are etc... She can back rushing as to hurry up and order SMH strike 2, we ordered our main entrees, but I forgot that I did want some appetizers this bishh has the nerve to have an attitude, so I politely told her if your busy send someone else to take our orders, don't do it... I am not the one. At that point I should have just told my sisters ok this is not the place for us. I hate being rushed with RUDENESS that is unacceptable. There are way too many good eateries with better food, LETS JUST BE REAL. REFILLS - OMG took forever and we had to keep asking for refills, we asked the waitresses for 2 pepsi and 4 sierra mist,  somehow we get 1 pepsi and 2 sierra mist (umm, I guess we'll just share with each other ughhh annyoying) Waitress someone comes back, tells us shes going on her lunch break and that Tim is gonna help us Ok, we thought cool she gone and he was gonna be nicer NOPE he was just as annoying with our damn drinks.  I didn't understand what the damn problem was being that we were really friendly but I noticed all the other tables got his damn attention.   When our food arrived it was cold and bland after waiting so long then we had to keep asking for BBQ sause, extra alfredo sauce the pasta was dry as well, the  fries were as if they were sitting forever smh  AWFUL don't ask for ranch. Actually the bus boys were much more friendy then than the waitress and brought out our request with a smile.  We didn't want dessert but then decided since we hadn't tried the Poozokie lets try it, so we had to  call our waiter back now for his defense he was covering for our wack waitress, but he seemed as if OMG really...  He made a smart remark that almost got me unglued but OMG what a joke they are finally brings it after 15 mints. At this point, we're all pretty tired since it was a late dinner  We decide, okay lets not make a big deal. lets just pay but here it is again she rushing us to pay while we eating our dessert OH HELL NO..she so damn lucky really lucky that I didn't go 51/50 on her because of my sisters here from out of town. THERE WILL BE NO NEXT TIME MY BILL WAS $199 WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY  I don't have a problem paying for good food and good service but that was pathetic for the service we had oh hell no,  NEVER EVER WILL I GO TO THIS PLACE... That just spoiled it for me the waitress is lucky I even bothered to leave her damn tip, that is only because my nephews and daughters all work service jobs and I know its not easy for good folks to leave a decent tip. SO BISSHH you best thank my daughter or else your ass would have gotten the ""HERE is a TIP, GET A BETTER  ATTITUDE TO GET MY DAMN MONEY"" What a waste of money, I should have gone to Red Robin LESSON LEARNED"
Marianne E.,"San Diego, CA",553,126,911,4.0,5/25/2016,"We made a reservation for 14 at 6pm on a Wednesday night for a birthday celebration. It took us a while to get our orders together but our servers were very patient and friendly :) I'm usually overwhelmed by the menu at BJ's because it looks more like an adventure novel than a menu. There's too many options! My go to is usually the deep dish pizza :) 2 for $25 is a great deal! You get soup or salad for each person, 1 medium size pizza (we only ate half before we got too full), and a pizookie to share. We got Caesar salads, a medium deep dish Great White pizza (my fave!), and the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. Portions are very generous! It was almost too hard to finish the pizookie after all that food! They let you split the checks individually even in a big group so it makes it easy to pay :) It was my first time at this BJ's location. They have great service, and I think it's perfect for big groups and celebrations. Hope I'll be back again soon for another pizookie! Yummm! :)"
Colleen W.,"Sacramento, CA",521,324,425,5.0,11/14/2016,"This rating is based on my most recent experience at BJ's Stockton. I have been here in the past many times but its been about 6 or 7 years since then. In the past I had nothing but positive experiences and luckily the service is still the same.  We were greeted right away and sat quickly on a beautiful busy Saturday afternoon. Our server was at our table within a minute or two of sitting down and taking our drink order. Drinks were delivered in a reasonable amount of time. And so was our food. Our server was very attentive, there was one time when she went a little longer than normal between checking on us but it was nothing to be upset about. She did however apologize that it took her a few extra minutes to check on us.  Food and beer were both delicious as usual, I've never had any complaints about the food or beer at any location.  Other locations (see my BJ's Elk Grove Reviews) could learn a thing or two from this location about service  =)"
Malachi T.,"Stockton, CA",73,14,28,1.0,9/7/2017,"30 mins after ordering our food, still waiting. I love the good food and atmosphere. At this point the lack of timeliness is becoming an issue. It's been too many times that we have just but the bullet and waited. But currently 3 couples have received their food and my wife and I are still waiting..... I hope that this changes soon.   I'm pretty hungry and irritated at this point."
Charles H.,"Stockton, CA",3,96,17,3.0,10/17/2017,"So came here because my 8 year old niece wanted to go for her birthday and the experience was quite underwhelming.  The food was pretty subpar.  We ordered combo pizza and the artichoke dip as appetizers and they were okay.  I personally had the bacon cheeseburger with a baked potato, which was a little too greasy and the baked potato was meh as well.  Other entrees we had included salmon, which was pretty well received, shrimp pita tacos which wasn't anything special, some more pizza, an avocado wrap and some kid's food.  The best part of the meal wasn't the food, but the berry beer my wife ordered that I drank most of, it was very good.  Service was pretty slow and the Asian hostess came to our table at the end of the night asking how we were gonna pay for our meal, which it turned out she had the wrong table, and didn't even bother apologizing and just walked away.  No skin off my back, I probably won't be coming back.  All 3 stars for the beer though, it was really that good."
Chelli I.,"Stockton, CA",62,45,53,3.0,7/13/2017,"BJs is a hit or miss. There's times when they take 30 mins to come out to even ask for a drink after you're seated (which is 80% of the time) and sometimes the service is okay, never exceptional, just okay. The steak as well is a hit or miss... it can be very over cooked and with great amounts of fat that you can't even cut into it (which is most of the times I go) though, last week it was really good which makes me want to go back before the.  BOGO is over. Let's hope I get good food again(:"
Shirly R.,"Stockton, CA",91,6,,3.0,5/29/2017,"We went to BJ's for a late lunch yesterday afternoon.. we had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table of 7 adults and 1 baby. When we finally got seated, it was next to a fire exit door. It had large, bold letters on the door, it read, ""Do not exit. Alarm will sound"" on it. The little kids seated near us didn't care, they were in and out of those doors. It was very disruptive to our dining experience. You would think the servers would attempt to remind these kids not to go out that door, but no. A female server did the same thing, except she didn't care to slowly close the door, it just slammed closed. It was so interruptive I could barely browse the menu with all the slamming and opening next to our table. Our server was very nice and attentive. At least she brightened my mood a bit. I ordered the Parmesan chicken with mash potatoes and a watermelon mojito. Loved it! Every one appeared pleased with their orders. Even my dad was full and satisfied and he's not the type of person who will order off a menu, he's more of a buffet man. Was the food worth how much we paid for? Not really. I would say it's a little over priced but it was delicious.. Drinks, expected to be pricey. I gave it 3 stars because the Food was good, server was good, but where we sat in location and drinks in price were both a ""no""."
Richard R.,"Stockton, CA",66,7,,5.0,10/23/2017,Good food good access good parking has a nice bar big TVs somewhere you could just get away have a beer and relax and meet people very nice place reservations it's quick and fast thank you
Patty L.,"San Francisco, CA",128,16,2,1.0,3/30/2017,"Decided to go to BJ's with a party of 6- 4 adults and 2 kids (birthday dinner) Greeted with a nice friendly host who led us to our table. I don't remember our waitress's name. She had dark brown curly hair. I thought it was great that she asked us if we wanted separate bills, of course we said, ""Yes!"" That way we can avoid the confusion later. But heres what went wrong- from beginning of the dinner to the end. -Asked for 4 waters- somehow only received 3 waters. (umm, I guess I'll share with my boyfriend.) -Ordered patron shots for all the adults. First round- received some crazy ass tequila shots that was NOT PATRON. (that's okay, we won't make a big deal about it. we'll drink it anyways because maybe this cheap liq. will fuggg us up faster??? lets hope!) let's try this again, lets order another round but this time emphasize on the PATRON. Somehow our female waitress disappears and a waiter comes instead and brings us 2 shots. (how does that equate to 2 shots when there's 4 adults?) food comes, that's fine. no complaints there. Since, it was one of our friends birthday. We figured we celebrate with a Poozkie! that's pretty standard, isn't it? Waitress someone comes back, ordered a poozkie with her. I check the time. Okay, 30 mins passed, I know it doesn't take that long for our poozkie to bake. Let me ask another waiter. He finally brings it after 15 mins. At this point, we're all pretty tired since it was a late dinner and the kids are getting fussy. We decide, okay lets not make a big deal. We waved her down for a check. We each get our split bills and WHAT THE HELL DO WE HAVE HERE? Checks are not split, My boyfriend and I (2 adults) somehow have our friend's meals and drinks on our tab. Our friends have (couple with 2 kids) ended up having half of what they ordered on their tab. We ended up paying for what they ordered. Since it was Miri's Birthday we figured it wasn't a big deal.  Okay, long story short. Biggest grip! WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU ASK US IF WE WANT SPLIT CHECKS IF YOU'RE GOING TO JUST CHARGE US WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE AND DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO COUNT 2 DRINKS FROM 4 DRINKS?!  I know it's Stockton and the literacy/education rate are low but REALLY? you don't know how to count drinks and follow simple orders? I'M NOT ASKING FOR A SHOT WITH ROCKS ON THE SIDE AND LIMES AND SALT SEPARATELY. IM JUST ASKING FOR 4 FREAKING SHOTS. What a waste of money, I should have bought a bottle from the corner store. I would have been super happy with my drunk self. BUT IM NOT DRUNK BECAUSE I'VE ONLY HAD 2 SHOTS, 1 with terrible cheap house tequila and 1 patron. FML."
Cara H.,"San Ramon, CA",234,8,,2.0,10/14/2017,"We went in on a Friday evening before it started to get busy but we still were waiting 20 minutes to be seated at a table- but then after we were seated we waited another 20 minutes to even meet our waitress. At this point we were already ready to order but the waitress only wanted to take our drink order to start. We insisted we order and she eventually and reluctantly took our order. The drinks arrived, followed by my dinner' side- strange. Then our appetizer arrived. Then we got our dinners. We scarcely saw the waitress. Our waters weren't refilled- only when she brought our bill. We wanted a box for left overs but our waitress never reappeared and had to corner a busboy to help who was also very reluctant to help. We left cash as we had no hope that we would see our waitress again.  This is unfortunate a very typical and not even the worst of service that we have experienced at BJ's. Wrong orders are normalcy, waitresses are often scarce, long waits to be seated receive drinks and food.  The only redeeming quality is that the food is when you finally get it. Unless they get order wrong. In that case don't expect a prompt fix."
Deniece M.,"Stockton, CA",2,4,,5.0,10/14/2017,"No wait, fast service. I went to lunch with my 3 daughter all under 12. My kids did not have a chance to complain that they were hungry cause the food came so fast. And the servicer was so patient, when my 6 year old wanted to order her own food."
Gretchen T.,"Sacramento, CA",17,254,356,3.0,11/29/2016,"Got the sirloin steak with steamed vegetables and thin cut fries. The steak wasn't very flavorful and the texture could have been better. I also got a snake bite drink, which was great. There was a rather large group of us, so they put several tables together and had two waiters taking our orders, one for each side of the table."
Melanie E.,"Stockton, CA",1,23,5,1.0,10/13/2017,"Happened TWICE now.  Waiter ""lost"" our order.  Who does that?  This time, we waited for 45min before the manager came out to apologize.  Said she isn't even sure what happened, but that the meal was on them.  Assured it would be out in ""less than 8 minutes."". When we received our food, it was clearly heated in the microwave because the meat was chewy and hard.  Sucks because we live down the street and eat ate.  This was a good go to alternative to fast food.  I'd rather eat Taco Bell."
Thomas H.,"Reseda, CA",12,5,5,4.0,2/26/2017,"I really do like BJs and wish I could go full 5 stars. On our last visit things were not perfect. Our pizza was not fully cooked and our appetizers came out after the pizza. That said, they took back the pizza and made a new one for us. AND the manager realized things had gone wrong and actually comped us our pizza. Was also very apologetic. So while there were issues, the staff was aware and worked to make it all right. And the staff was very pleasant. For me that is great. It says their aim is to make things good. I've been to restaurants where things go wrong and nobody seems to care.  I have only one unfixable complaint that seems to be common to all BJ outlets. We were seated at a booth. BJ booths all seem designed with less space between the seats and the tables than other chain restaurants. If you're thin it's annoying but okay. If you have any body fat though you will end up squeezing in. Then you can either embarrass yourself by having to ask to be moved or you can sit squished for your whole meal feeling bad about yourself. I'm guessing the design is intended to allow more booths and more seating. I say lose a booth or two and let people sit comfortably."
Dale N.,"Stockton, CA",2193,720,6555,4.0,1/13/2016,"Four stars for a chain restaurant. Great servers Fun atmosphere Full Bar  (great house-made root beer) Good food Huge menu choices Great parking Yummy desserts Great hours. Fri/Sat till 1a.m., Sun-Thurs till Midnight I like BJ's better than Applebee's, Chili's, and TGI Friday's for the above reasons. Had the fish and chips tonight ($14).  Ordered the skinny fries. Yummy! Tell 'em you want your food and fries HOT!"
Allan T.,"Stockton, CA",3,30,68,2.0,9/7/2017,"The food here is great, but every time I've come to eat here it takes over 30 mins to get my food. There are always different people coming around your table asking if you need something and end up forgetting about it. We had ordered a salad and asked for extra vinaigrette and it didn't come till after we had already finished the salad because we were already starving waiting for the food. You'd think that being one of the first customers here upon opening the service would be different than coming during the later hours, but it's actually the same. They have lunch menu items that have bottomless fries, and man... those fries are good! If you want to dine here, be prepared to wait."
Fred O.,"Stockton, CA",1,34,4,4.0,8/6/2017,"Great food and service, great beer selection. I know their busy, but a little more attention to cleaning under the tables. The seared ahi salad is a long time winner. Our server was very attentive and kept refills coming. Highly recommend."
Katie C.,"Milpitas, CA",198,108,32,3.0,10/4/2016,"I ordered the chicken philly pizza because it sounded amazing. However, i didn't taste the siracha cheese nor the roasted garlic! The pizza had no oomph, flavorwise.  The pizookie, as always, is amazing. I highly recommend the peanut butter smores cookie. Share it because it's super sweet!  Service was pretty good, but I waited a long time for a to go container and a water refill. The waitress was very helpful when I was asking about the rewards app!"
Clint R.,"Sacramento, CA",4,13,,4.0,9/7/2017,"Amazing/reliable place. All of the food is amazing, service is great, the pazookies are out of this world! They have a variety of all different things and you can really just count on this restaurant to give you what you want"
Stephanie M.,"Stockton, CA",191,8,,5.0,9/14/2017,"My fiancé and I come to BWW on a daily basis and we usually ask for Dave because he's so great but he wasn't working until later today. Our server's name was Brittany Y. and she was amazing! Our food came out quickly and it was probably one of the best visits we've had. She was on top of our refills, she brought extra napkins and silverware without us even asking and she asked if we wanted something to drink to go (which I usually ask for anyway). Hopefully she gets recognition for her great service because she deserves it. The only complaint I have is that it was a little too cold and loud in the restaurant. I'm used to it here but if there's a way to maybe lower the volume and temperature, that would be even better. We'll keep visiting this restaurant though. One of our favorites!"
Crystal P.,"Stockton, CA",97,17,11,3.0,10/12/2017,We took my oldest niece to BJ's last night for her 21st birthday. We didn't have to wait long since it was a Wednesday night. I repeatedly told the front person we have 12 people but they still put 2 tables together with 10 chairs. Our waitress was Jessica and she was friendly and attentive. She bought my niece her first birthday shot then we got our drinks and appetizers. I always like their appetizers. My fav were the wrapped avocado and artichoke dip. There were no small plates for the appetizers even though I asked for them. I ordered grilled chicken with veggies over rice pilaf. The rice was super salty so I couldn't eat my food. Everyone else had pasta and ribs so they ate theirs. The alcohol mixed drinks barely had any alcohols in them so it was disappointing. They were supposed to bring out the pizookie after we paid but they never did. Jessica said to go back next time and remind them. I don't know if we'll ever go back though. If I'm going to spend over $250 I'll rather go buy grocery and cook for the family and chill at home. Last night experience reminded me why I haven't gone to this place for years...
Jessica M.,"Sacramento, CA",61,19,18,1.0,12/22/2016,"When we arrived to this place, they were not super busy. We got there around 9:15pm. The server greeted us and took our drinks orders. She brought them over within 5 minutes. Then asked if we were ready to order, we told her we needed a bit more time to look through the menu. She said ""ok, I'll be back to check on you guys"" .. SHE NEVER CAME BACK! After a 20 minute wait, I couldn't wait any longer, I was HANGRY. So I politely asked other server if we could please get someone to take our order hence we were waiting for about 20 minutes. She was nice. She apologized and said she would get our server right away. Our server was NOWHERE TO BE FOUND! Finally after another 10minutes, I saw her dealing with another tables order. The manager approached her and whispered something to her ear. She then turned around and looked at us. She continued to take the other tables order and after she was done she approached us with a HUGE ATTITUDE and said ""Are you guys ready now!?"" ..... I was so hungry that I had no time to think about going anywhere else and wait other 30min to have some food. At this point I was so annoyed by the service given to us for not reason. It was a very dissatisfied and disappointing experience. The rest is history, the food was mediocre and cold. I ordered spaghetti and meat balls and when they arrived, the meatballs were dry and cold..  Pathetic service and low standard food... OH, AND MY FOOD HAD A HAIR ON MY PLATE!!!!!!!!!!!! Never coming here again. Thanks for your unpleasant service Natalie F (server). If you do come, make sure you time your server and holla at them so they don't forget about your table...."
Rd C.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,134,131,4.0,7/9/2017,"On a road trip, needed a late dinner.  Good food and prompt friendly service (despite the place being busy at 9:30 PM on a Friday night).  TV's on a couple different stations so I could ""catch-up"" on the news of the day.  I would stop in here again.  Thanks, BJ's!"
Carlos C.,"Stockton, CA",14,5,,2.0,5/10/2017,"This used to be our go to place in Stockton, but unfortunately the service has severely declined. Miguel and Cynthia both need to be retrained in customer service. Hopefully this location can return to is former glory. Food is still up to par."
Jade V.,"Stockton, CA",7,25,14,1.0,12/27/2016,"I wanted a pizookie, so I came here. Unfortunately, I did not get my pizookie. We waited over 20 minutes for someone to serve us. We flagged the staff down several times and they kept telling us that they would send someone over. No one ever came. No water. No food. No service. We asked to talk to the manager. He never came either. It wasn't even busy. It's a Tuesday! I can't imagine the service on an actually busy weekend.  BJ's can keep their overpriced big cookie and ice cream!!! I definitely will not be coming here ever again. Please save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.  I will also be contacting corporate about my horrible experience."
Angela O.,"San Jose, CA",174,6,,4.0,8/14/2017,Pazookies are very tasty! Love their Appetizers and I always get some really friendly servers!!
Ronnesha L.,"Stockton, CA",7,122,201,5.0,1/15/2017,"Love BJs can't believe I never left a review. So this Saturday it was super packed. The way was like 30 minutes and could have been longer if we didn't ask. They had us seating for two but it was actually three so they were waiting for a two seat table. Anyway we were seated order drinks. The drinks came very quick and they were delicious. Our server was very fast and attentive. We ordered cheese dip and chips which was almost cold but we were starving so ate it up anyway. Now about those new wings, the root beer ones. Omg to die for. My hubby ordered them and I was all in his plate. My crusted Parmesan chicken was bomb as usual. I had to order more lemon butter because they only give you a splash. She brought it back really fast. She never forgot anything. I get to full for the cookie but I had it before some years ago so I know it's bomb. I see root beer wings in my future. Lol"
S. G.,"Nassau County, NY",0,9,,1.0,6/12/2017,"If zero stars were possible... but, alas, the poor service; cold, gross food; the fight (with f-Bombs that broke out between the two parties near us); and the extra slow everything (laying off wait staff and replacing them with tech that doesn't work = awesome move, corporate.) has earned you ONE STAR. Our wait person was so overwhelmed and slow that we had to give her a big tip because it might well have been her last night of work. In related news: this reinforces why we always try to avoid chain restaurants. Mediocre and over-priced. Or, in our case, dreadful and over-priced."
Tynessa L.,"Auburn, CA",5,253,8,2.0,7/2/2017,Blah and boring. Ordered a salad and artichoke dip. The salad was brining and very expensive. I picked at it and ended up barely eating half. The artichoke dip lacked flavor as well. Try something else nearby!
