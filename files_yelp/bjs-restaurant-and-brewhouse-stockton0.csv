andrew r.,"Lodi, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/31/2015,"I've visited this location a couple of times in the past and have had ok service but lately the service here has gone way down hill last time I was here there service was so bad the new manager Chris offered to pay for bill as long as we gave him another chance  Well today we went in and they could not even get my rewards to come up I thought oh well next we got seated and ordered drinks the girl came out with straws in my wife's and mine drinks but not one for my son she stated ""there's only like 20 straws in the restaurant and I thought he could go with out"" so I gave him mine  Next we ordered my son who is a very picky eater orders mini burgers with thin fries  The waitress the returns and says we have no fries  That's when I lost it and walked out after voicing my opinion to the manager  In closing we will never visit again"
Cindy S.,"Federal Way, WA",5,4,,4.0,5/28/2015,"I found the food very good. Had Chicken Alfrado Was great.  My son took us there. Service was very  Good. The Restaurant was very clean, friendly. Tiffany I hope you guys get one up in Sesttle, Wa. We were here to see our Grandaughter graduate High school. Recommend yes and highly."
Nick O.,"Modesto, CA",0,26,15,1.0,2/1/2016,"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I asked for an ala cart baked potato as I just had my wisdom teeth removed and there was not much I could eat. I was admittedly wrongly charged $10 for the potato, but okay, accidents happen. Then they refused to correct it. What? The service is undependable, rude, and the potato was nothing special. You're better off going to McDonald's or Taco Bell."
Rebecca H.,"Stockton, CA",6,6,3,1.0,2/24/2016,Extremely disappointed. Wait is ridiculous. Food is cold. Service sucks. We will never come here again. Should of went to Chilies!
Kimmie H.,"Stockton, CA",13,9,24,1.0,8/9/2015,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I got dirty utensils twice, also btw we had to ask for utensils to eat our food in the first place. Our waitress although friendly we hardly saw after taking our order. Bathroom was dirty. Never coming back. This place just plain sucks."
Emillio C.,"Stockton, CA",46,2,13,1.0,11/21/2015,I would tell you how my food was but I never got it. After waiting for 45 min after the rest of my party got their food which I did order the same thing as someone else never got my order and my son only got half of what he was supposed to get . Waiter never checked on us and someone brought the check to us. Real rating 0 stars. Get it together BJ's

Susan G.,"Tracy, CA",456,18,12,5.0,1/30/2016,"our server was friendly, prompt but not overly hovering!   Best service and timing I've had here in a while.   I'll be back!"
Gustavo A.,"Fresno, CA",23,22,40,5.0,9/15/2014,I always enjoy BJs great food and service! Always busy gets a little loud but lots of tvs to watch the game
Jerline H.,"Washington, DC",118,300,696,4.0,10/3/2012,"Chat conversation. ""We cannot make up our minds on where to go! I just want BJs!""  ""Haha bjs... but you probably meant pizza, burgers, and beer""  ""I set you up so well but you blew it."" ""I literally make that joke all the time. Let's be real, YOU blew it."" Anyway, I always have fun here; come by for birthdays, causal dates (the kind where you're trying to impress somebody but trying not to look like you're trying), celebrations, happy hour, and sports games!  To eat and drink and be merry: + Avocado egg rolls  + Ahi poke  + Gourmet Mac & Cheese + Shrimp scampi pasta + Jeremiah Red beer  + Piranha Pale ale  I got a sampler of all their ales, was too full to finish them all, had girlfriends who were already drunk on their margaritas, and had to call some guy friends to come join us for happy hour. :T  Anyway, sometimes you need to strongly hint that it's a person's birthday, especially when they are busy, but the waiters and waitresses are sweet - they'll flirt with you (my grandlittle) big time! I'm a fan of this BJ's!"
Isabelle C.,"Stockton, CA",23,47,32,1.0,7/21/2015,"This place sucks. Yet I still came here too often -_- the only time I do come here is when my friends do their bday dinners here or friends wants to meet there for lunch, whatever. The only thing I ever get here is skinny-cut fries and appetizers. Everything else tastes like microwaved foods. The last time I was here, about a week ago, my friend was visiting on military leave. So a bunch of us girls got together...here. At first, everything was good, our server was nice and we liked her. She took our orders, and that was the last time we saw her. Without notice, we apparently got another waitress. The second waitress brought out our food, she was nice too until she barely even checked up on us. We had to flag her down for refills, and refills took long. When we paid, this server literally took 30 MINUTES to process our payments. Apparently she had charged the wrong card to the wrong items, when we specifically wrote on the check which belong to who. It wasn't even busy. It was a friggin' Tuesday night at 8. What we were more annoyed about was the fact that our server didn't tell us there was a problem as soon as it happened, she just took our payments and disappeared for thirty minutes. A couple years ago, my friend and I came here on New Year's Eve at about 11:15pm and were sat quickly. It was busy but seemed like most of the tables had their food already. A couple of big parties. Regardless, my friend and I sat at our table for 40 minutes without having a server serve us. We flagged two different workers after 10 min and the second after 25 mins to let them know we're ready and they said ""I'm sorry for the wait, let me go get your server"" and no one ever came. This totally killed my NYE. SO STUPID. We just got up and left at 11:55pm. I should have complained to management but I didn't want to deal w/ it anymore."
Lolita B.,"Oakland, CA",65,10,5,1.0,10/26/2015,"Definitely something new going on. New management or a new chef but the food has absolutely changed. My daughters pizza tasted like it was baked on greasy focaccia but my Alfredo tasted really fresh as to where you could actually see the butter and cheese separating on the noodles which were rather dry though I asked for extra sauce with the initial order. However, the chicken was grilled really nicely. Oh and my chedder broccoli soup was less than what I'm used to. It's sourdough bowl was viciously burned and had barely been hollowed out. As to where as soon as I removed its lid for inspection the waitor instantly offered to bring additional soup. The best part was the wait staff. Their service was superior. Everyone who walked our way checked on us which made the experience not so bad."
Elsa H.,"San Jose, CA",9,3,42,5.0,5/19/2014,"Our home away from home BJ's never fails. We come here at least twice a week, the customer service is the best"
Titus F.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/20/2016,Best pizza I've had in a while. Monique and Courtney are the best bartenders I've seen so far. I plan to come back in the future
Vira P.,"San Francisco, CA",336,1141,1134,4.0,11/25/2012,"I like this place.. it's not bad.  For me, it's not the beer that is paired with the food, it's the other way around.  I love the beer selection, and I think you should make your food choice based on what beer you plan to drink. I ordered a custom deep dish pizza with artichokes, garlic and tomatoes.  A random waiter came up to our table and gave us a the wrong pizza.  When our assigned waitress came to check on us, she realized right away that it wasn't the right pizza.  The manager went to our table and apologized for the error.  We got our pizza eventually, which still lacked tomatoes, but it really didn't matter to me at this point.  It was the kitchen that messed up anyway and not the waitress.  She was super friendly. What I really love is the avocado egg rolls and the pizookies!  I'll always order those two things when I go to BJ's.  Otherwise, the rest of the entree selection isn't appetizing to me.. And I'll only order a pizza if I'm really hungry.  Otherwise, I'm pretty much a happy camper when I get my egg rolls and pizookie."
Chris M.,"Stockton, CA",16,55,5,1.0,8/27/2015,"Thought I would give Curbside a second chance..Second time...Curbside...What's that?  Especially in 100 degree weather :( I called in my order ahead of time - they told me 10 minutes.  I arrived in 15+ minutes, called the number posted on the sign.  The girl was pleasant enough and said she would be right out...10 minutes later I called again.  Pleasant girl again...said she would be right out...not happening...their salads are not worth waiting for...Bye! Bye!"
Johnson Y.,"Turlock, CA",165,99,24,2.0,4/26/2015,We came to BJs and we got seated down pretty quick and that was pretty much the best part of the service we gotten all night other than that the food took long to come out and when we needed a refill on our drinks our server didn't seem to care at all she walked by look at our drinks and just walked off
Cory N.,"Stockton, CA",624,33,46,4.0,4/26/2014,"I'm definitely a huge fan of their pizza. From the bacon cheeseburger (discontinued?) to the buffalo chicken, I've made a silent promise to myself to only order their deep-dish whenever I go there with friends. As for service, some of the staff are more incompetent than others, and as the saying goes, ""You're only as strong as your weakest link"". In no way does a night of inconsistent service depict the strength of the BJs staff as a whole. However, there is still a chance that you will feel unwelcome if you decide to enjoy a meal on the BJs off Pacific Avenue. In conclusion, great pizza; inconsistent service. Would come again."
Jasleen B.,"Stockton, CA",2,8,2,1.0,6/22/2014,"Bad bad manager tisk tisk!!! What a disappointing night at BJS. WE HAD TO WAIT FOR OVER AN HOUR FOR THEM TO GET OUR TAB FIGURED OUT. The heavy set manager still charged us after this long wait.  We had to request ordered drinks twice & never got them (of course they charged us). Someone ordered an extra pizooki to go after we ate ours & it never came (of course she was charged). They charged our card for the wrong amount & had to credit our card back & recharge it. He blamed it on us because we had separate tabs & it's the new waitresses fault (so unprofessional). His solution was a free pizooki. I told him we didn't want another pizooki. Then he brought a $20 gift card. Gift card? So we can come back here & spend more money? We are not stupid! I told him I didn't want a gift card because we will not be coming back. He sat it on the table & walked away. I would've tossed it to the floor but it was an employees 21st birthday & the night was already dampened enough. So we waited another 15 minutes for them to figure out someone else's tab.  My fiancé & I are both managers so we know there's a point you do what you can to keep the customer, especially when it's your fault! The correct solution would've been to APOLOGIZE & credit us back for the night, as we requested. Honestly we would've went back to BJs if he would've done all he could for waisting so much of our night. So...gift card is shredded. THANKS TO THE HEAVY SET MANAGER WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO BJS."
