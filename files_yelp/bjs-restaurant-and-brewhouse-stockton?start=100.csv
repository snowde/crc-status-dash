Ebonie J.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/30/2017,"I want to give two stars because they're food is good but I dined here with my mom. We ordered our food and had drinks, we decided to take two pizookies to-go. Server was nice, not the fastest but she brought out our to-go order in about 20 mins. We get home and BOTH pizookies were BURNT  seriously had to laugh because i still ate mines and my moms since she didn't want hers being it was too crisp. I would love them better if they watched the food more closely"
Kristina D.,"Tracy, CA",0,20,1,5.0,5/20/2017,Lunch was amazing. Waitress attentive and friendly   Beers are good.   Had the peanut chicken noodle dish. Hubby had the shrimp and quinoa. Both were very flavorful
Andrea O.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/21/2017,We went to BJs for our grandsons birthday. The wait was 25 minutes but no wait in the bar area so we went to the bar knowing that in the past the service sucked in the bar area. We sat down and sat there for 25 minutes before we placed our order and another 45 minutes before we we got our food and it was cold.  The waitress asked how everything was and there was an awkward silence. No words needed to be spoken. She came back and asked again and my husband complained that it took 1 hour and a half to get the food she walked away and said she would talk to her manager. She never came back and I had to ask to even get the bill. The service in this restaurant has really went down hill and so has the food. Very disappointed customer.
Adam A.,"Stockton, CA",4,3,,2.0,6/25/2017,"What happened to this place. It was half full on a Sunday afternoon about 1:30 p.m. Anyways, my family of five came in for a linner. The waitress came by pretty quick and took our drink order and we were all ready to order our food. A few minutes had gone by, well about half an hour. We received our food, everything seemed okay. My wife say's, ""I didn't order this plate."" They screwed up her order but like a kind woman she is, she started to eat it even to my objection, so that was that. I went ahead and had a few fries with my bacon burger but the burger was so cold, I could not eat it. The server came back and asked how everything was and I replied that the burger was cold and my wife received the wrong order. They replaced my burger but my wife got stuck with hers.  Maybe they should just serve beer. Too expensive, wrong food, cold food, I don't think so.They won't see us any time soon, well let's say a long while."
Sarah B.,"Seattle, WA",0,15,,1.0,12/30/2015,Worst service ever.  Our waitress was disinterested and not attentive. The establishment itself was extremely dirty. I've been to other chains of BJ's which we much nicer. This one definitely belonged in Stockton. They gave us extremely weak drinks. Worst part of it all? My credit card information was stolen and hundreds of dollars in charges were put on my account immediately after I left this facility. I can't be 100% sure it was my server but I had no issues with my card and less than an hour after I left this facility my card was compromised. You do the math. Criminals. This was a horrible experience and I will NEVER return to a BJ's.
Omar R.,"San Lorenzo, CA",64,344,1387,4.0,6/23/2015,"In town to celebrate a new addition to my buddies family, he chose this place since he's a regular. They have a great assortment of beers on tap, and the usual suspects on the liquor rack. Buddy knew the bartender well so service was great. Great vibe, casual ambience. Didn't order anything to eat came in late, but enjoyed the atmosphere and great conversation. Can't wait to try the food, hopefully the service is as comparable as the bar service."
Kathy A.,"Escalon, CA",14,28,8,1.0,5/17/2017,"Had a small dinner party here with Cynthia as our waitress.  She was not concerned with our needs or any display of cordialness.  She put the appitaiser on the table with no napkins, plates, or request for anything we might need.  Rudeness is not a good attribute for a waitress.  Because of her unwarranted disdain & Rudeness, we will not be going back; nor will we recommend this restaurant to anyone else."
Mel A.,"Stockton, CA",47,14,30,5.0,3/3/2016,"Giving this a good rate to the max of 5 stars since this place made our Valentine's date last month so incredibly awesome! The food were all great, taste good, pizookie and avocado egg rolls are to die for! Service is average! Sometimes, they tend to forget your favors with your orders, but overall- very good!"
Rachel K.,"Stockton, CA",341,258,1953,3.0,5/31/2014,"We end up going to BJs a lot with our coworkers, I may just be BJed out but I feel like, while it's a great late night location and you're sure to find something for everyone on the menu, you just don't get the bang for your buck.  I've always had good service from the waiters, waitresses, bartenders and hostesses but the food and drinks just have never wowed me. I think the best thing on the menu is the pizza and even then there's been a few times that I've gotten soggy greasy crust (while it was still really flavorful and tasty just SUPER greasy).   I've had burgers, salads, soups and of course pizza but none of it stands out as a ""we have to go to BJ's and get ???"" dish. Maybe the pizookies are their calling card but even then it's just a fresh cookie with ice cream.  I've also tried many of their beers, while I appreciate that they brew their own special blends I'm still waiting for the beer that I have to tag on untappd as a 5 star brew.  This place is convenient, has great service, is open late and has something for everyone in your group. The food is ok and you'll end up spending a good amount by the end of the night, but hey, all my friends love it!"
Alana H.,"Stockton, CA",60,86,5,3.0,9/12/2016,Both times I have ordered delivery through Yelp they have messed up my order. The food is usually good (for BJ's quality) but it's pretty annoying to pay like $10 to get food delivered and it's wrong.
Atari S.,"Stockton, CA",158,34,33,5.0,7/15/2016,O M G!!!!!!!! The best service ever tonight. This should be the model for all BJ's everywhere. William is the best server ever. Just want to put him in my purse and never let him go!!! Love Joanne she is the best manager ever. We ordered an appetizer and it was perfect. The calamari was wonderful. Everything was excellent. We will be back. Thanks for being wonderful!!!!
Lauren N.,"Lodi, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/16/2016,"You should totally come here.... If cold food, and slow and rude service are your thing!  Manager was extremely polite, apologized on behalf of the employee however my experience was already ruined. Will not return."
Charles C.,"Galt, CA",0,22,5,1.0,4/11/2016,Went here for dinner date with my daughter. Ordered a burger that took 30 minutes. It was raw in the middle. So nasty can't believe I paid for it. Manager was supposed to come talk to us but never showed up took waiter 25 minutes to come back and tell us.
Krysta C.,"Tracy, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2017,"I will never come to this BJ's again! Terrible service! We waited for at least 20 minutes after we were seated for our drinks then over an hour for our food (which was cold once we got it!) Our waitress disappeared after she took our order and we had to try to find someone to ask for refills, silverware and everything else several times before getting them. The manager came out and said let me check on that then never came back. Horrible. He never even came to address us after we voiced our opinions, just sent the waitress to tell us our meal would be free. I'm in management myself and I would NEVER let my customers leave that upset! Horrible way to celebrate my fiancé's birthday."
Adjoa H.,"Oakland, CA",3,10,1,2.0,3/20/2016,"I think the quality of service here has sharply declined. The people who clean the tables do not do a good job at all. There was still food in the booths and on the ground when I got to my table. That's ridiculous. Also, it shouldn't take 10 minutes to get coffee. I feel like either you get a really good and attentive waiter or you get a waiter who doesn't have good customer service skills.  BJ's seriously needs to work on their improving their customer service and cleanliness."
Kenya P.,"Stockton, CA",23,8,,3.0,11/3/2016,"The is okay, with a nice atmosphere. It can be a bit crowded, which is why not such a high rating. The staff is pretty friendly as well."
Charlotte W.,"Modesto, CA",0,8,1,3.0,5/4/2017,"I like this place a lot, but within the last few years I have noticed that the food is far from stellar. The waitresses/waiters are a hit and miss, and the last time I went my food had to be sent back. Over all this is an okay place to eat, and hang out with the friends for a drink."
Diana V.,"Stockton, CA",0,8,9,5.0,4/10/2016,BJs is one of my favorite restaurants here in Stockton! I always come here with my family! The burgers and pizookie sate tasty! Reaaaally recommend to try a pizookie if you have not! :)
Roxie A.,"Stockton, CA",1,22,1,2.0,7/31/2016,"As so many other reviewers are saying, the food is really good but the service is more then ridiculously slow. Slow to take our order, slow to bring the food and slow to bring the bill. My other complaint is the the music was so loud it was nearly impossible to have a conversation. Even though the food we ordered was delicious, the other two issues ruined it for us."
Vanessa G.,"Stockton, CA",105,9,2,3.0,1/30/2016,The food was decent. The service was good. I just wish the hostesses were more organized. It took forever to get our food and people were trying to steal our seat. Waiter promising seats that are first come first serve. Luckily we got our seat but do not enjoy being bothered by customers who supposedly had dips on the table next.
