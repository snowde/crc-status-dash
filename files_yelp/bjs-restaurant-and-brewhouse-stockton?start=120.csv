Adena R.,"Lathrop, CA",474,13,5,2.0,9/1/2015,"First strike against the restaurant was when we asked our waitress what ""baja sauce"" was she had no idea nor did she go check.  Second strike was the stuffed mushroom appetizer.  The actual mushrooms were the smallest mushrooms I have seen in a long time, good flavor but tiny mushrooms.  Third strike was the very long wait for our dinners.  I ordered the steak, cooked medium - it was barely pink, dry, tough, and had WAY too much pepper.  The asparagus was paper thin and oversalted.  My husband ordered the bison burger which came with a side salad.  The burger patty was a thin hockey puck that was gone in literally 3 buys wá..The salad was pretty much all chopped onions.   My oldest son got the jalapeno burger, which he liked, and my youngest just ordered a house salad with grilled chicken on top.   The waitress was nice and did offer to give my youngest son another salad for free just so he could eat with us once our food finally got there.   We did voice our disappointment with the flavor and portion size to our waitress.  She said sorry and said she has had the same thing happen at other restaurants!!! WTH? Needless to say, we won't be back to this particular location anytime soon!!!!!"
Sergio G.,"San Leandro, CA",11,3,21,5.0,3/25/2016,"I've come here many times and in many cities. The food and service is top notch. Not once have I felt neglected nor treated like just another customer. Today it's my birthday and I specifically wanted to be here to celebrate. Five stars for all around great service, clean dinning area and wonderful staff. P.S. if you like beers please try their BJ's HopStorm IPA"
Melanie M.,"Sydney, Australia",45,25,397,4.0,9/24/2014,"Came here last night like around 9:30pm because its like one of very few restaurants that are open later than the usual. Food: I ordered their chicken wings and avocado rolls. Wait time was 15-20min which wasn't bad at all to me, but when you wait that long, you expect freshly made food. When i did receive my food, the avocado in the rolls were already grayish/black (which means they have been sitting out for a while).  Thankfully the waiter apologized and replaced it right away for us with no hesitation. The chicken wings were delicious! No complaints about it! Service: The gentlemen that served us wasn't very talkative but he did get the job done and he did it right. He was friendly enough to make us happy. He made this review a 4 star one. As long as they promise to always bring me fresh food, i will continue to be a customer!"
Uriia A.,"Lodi, CA",4,18,17,1.0,8/16/2016,Horrible customer service. I'm currently still waiting for my food and I've been here since 7:30pm. It's 9:24pm right now. We have two pregnant women in our party and I'm surprised we haven't passed out. I would rate this place with a negative if possible. It's a Tuesday night. What the heck!?!?!?! ******UPDATE**** I just got my food at 9:32pm. I guess they can get one star. NOT. (I only ordered a bowl of soup. Lol!)
Vita S.,"Corona, CA",3,13,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Warning: horrible service here. Can't even get a waiter to get water. We tried to wave different waiters who were all huddled at one corner, some ignored us while one claim to go look for our missing waiter. We waited and waited but still no one came to take our order. After a long wait we gave up and left disappointed. I WILL NEVER EVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!!!!! HATE HATE HATE THIS PLACE. Very crappy service."
Kato I.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,27,21,5.0,8/26/2016,Love this place! Went there with my friends... great service...I don't mind going there often.
Leslie M.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,3,1.0,7/25/2015,This place usually has good food but 2 nights ago I got the steak and it was delicious but it was served with moldy broccoli and the service was awful.  I kept  having to stop random servers because mine was nowhere to be found...
Chris H.,"Turlock, CA",0,21,28,1.0,8/19/2016,Penne and asparagus pasta. It tasted and look like simple ingredients from Walmart. Prego sauce and box on penne. Pretty much all it was expect lot more money.
Julieanne R.,"Stockton, CA",11,121,59,4.0,8/15/2014,My sister and I came here for lunch.  This place is always clean and located in a nice plaza with other nice stores.  It does get busy during weekends so get here early or later. We were the first ones in with the place opening at 11 am.  But our order still took longer than expected.  We got the chicken tacos and fried chicken and they were pretty good.  We wanted to treat ourselves so we got the peanut butter smore pizookie and it was to die for!  Every one needs to try it!
Daniel R.,"Stockton, CA",29,35,18,1.0,8/29/2015,"My first visit was this past week. A little noisy, but that's not what disappointed me, it was the high price per portion. Dinner for two without appetizer =$51.00?! And, I've seen these similar menu selections elsewhere. Furthermore, $10.00 each for a Featured margarita? I chose the blended version (as it made any difference.) it tasted like a margarita smoothie.  Lesser note:The interior is confusing. I like eclectic, but what is this some sort of interior-fusion. The serving staff were busy, but somewhat attentive. My friend and I finally decided on BJ's because they were open later that night, but we won't be returning."
Jon S.,"Salem, OR",7,32,33,4.0,3/27/2016,I'll need to come back and try more but the mushrooms were excellent and the service was good. Beer is kinda boring since I'm from a city that rules beer. Lots of options on the menu
Bryan H.,"Tracy, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/23/2017,"Usually great things to say about BJ's but last night was a disaster. If something could go wrong it did, food sent back because of mistakes multiple times and they still wanted to charge us full price for everything despite having to eat dinner while the rest of the family is eating desserts. Asked to speak to a manager which is very rare for us, and he/she was too busy to come to our table so we could let he/she know some of the issues we had that night before we left. Last time we'll be visiting this Stockton location, we could have received better service at Mcdonalds"
Jovie D.,"Tracy, CA",36,7,,2.0,7/31/2016,"After being seated, it took about 15-20 to get our order in, while taking about another hour to get our food after we ordered it. The service is awful, and the food is very mediocre. I'll give them 2 stars for never hesitating to take something off the bill when we don't enjoy it and their pizookies."
Shelby R.,"Stockton, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/11/2016,"I've always had a great time here, I've watched while people complain about the slow service, but what do you expect when this place is packed?! Always good food, and good company. Never had a reason to complain about this place."
Donald A.,"Stockton, CA",16,25,108,4.0,9/24/2014,"Always good for if your group can't decide where to eat.  Beer: their stout and red are always on point. If your looking for something lighter,  they have few selections as well.  Food: it's not actuality fine dining, although sone items are pricey, you just need to be pay extra attention on your orders. Part of our huge HEFFA status order was fried avocado rolls. The lighting of the place could trick you so check if they are fresh and color of avocados didn't change yet, avocados tends to turn grayish/black when they been sitting. To make this short, that's what happened to our order,  so after i tried a whole piece, we asked our server to give us a fresher one which he did right away. That bumped their 3 stars to 4.  Service: they are good,  haven't experienced bad service from this place yet. Just don't be shy to say something or ask them if you need anything,  if they had allot of strikes, don't hold back and tell them, you might get a free Pozoki (that warn cookie with ice cream that smart good looking people can't spell).  Place: very cozy and clean.  My tip: Food and drinks at BJ's are pricier than other place cos they pay a lot of people. So if your service, food and experience is not good, ask for a manager to get it right for you. And if that won't change or improve anything, tell them is your bday, automatic free Pozoki without checking your ID! Lol"
D'Adrea D.,"Stockton, CA",178,25,17,5.0,6/30/2014,"Once again my father treated myself and Breanna to BJs for our birthday! Once again...it was DELISH and the service was very good. The waitress checked on us frequently to make sure our glasses were full and delivered our food in a timely fashion.  Friday evening is a very busy night out at BJs. The ambiance is always lively with Sports on the TVs and music playing. Again we ordered the Crispy Calamari (the lemon garlic aioli is the best). We also enjoyed the Pepperoni Extreme Flatbread Pizza as an appetizer...which was really good and crispy.  For my main dish...I went with the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, which is a meal in itself. The serving was so huge that I had to get a ToGo Box. For Dessert (since it was my birthday), I devoured the infamous Cookies N Cream Pizookie! Ice Cream with cookie and cream whipped on top of a very rich chocolate cookie. I don't think Breanna came up for air when she was killing hers.  BJs Restaurant and Brewery is always a good time...whether it's dinner with the family or Happy Hour with girls!"
Fouka M.,"Stockton, CA",74,23,124,1.0,12/17/2016,"If i could no stars I definitely would! This used to be a really nice quick place to come to for casual meets and drinks. The only reason why I would give it a star is because the food is always consistent here. The drinks are good as well.  My main concern is the customer service. It sure went from a 10 to none. Ive never had a problem sittint at the bar side, usually less wait.  We found sittiny easily upon arrival.  Sat there, waited and waited.  We looked around and it was pretty slow (around 130pm) so we figured service will be on our way soon. A family of 4 sat at the booth right in front of us and right away I service rendered to them first.  The waited did not make any initiation to even ask if weve been helped or not. I waited for her to be done attending the family who came after us yet waited on before us. I had to ask if we too can get service.  She took our orders and informed us that food will be right out. Im a desert  first kind of person so I asked to see if i can have my pizooky in advanced.  20 minutes later....we asked another waitress about our orders.  We ended up getting my desert with our appetizers and food with no utensils and water. (Way to go BJ's) got up and took utensils from another table When we almost finished our food, our waiters finally came back to us and informed us that she did not realize that the other waited who was supposed to cover for her never waited on us. Most of the time im well aware when waiters switch shifts or breaks, they usually inform the customer in advance.  In this case, WE NEVER DID and puts the blame on someone else...thats shitty service. Did she deserve a tip? Definitely NOT!! As much as i like the food, if service is crappy its not worth going back!"
Javi M.,"Stockton, CA",1,3,,5.0,2/12/2016,"Best waitress in Stockton ,  Mckayla friendly outgoing great personality made our experience at bjs one of the best"
Christine P.,"Stockton, CA",0,21,2,4.0,7/22/2016,"I don't normally like to eat at places like this, but the pizookie is just too good to miss. Their pizookie is probably the only reason why I would continue to eat at this place lol  Their food is alright. I wouldn't say the food is anything superb, because their food, to me, personally is overpriced. Their food isn't as bad as say, Denny's, but their food isn't worth the amount that you're paying for. I always usually get the chicken alfredo and it's good, but not great.  Their pizookie, however, is a saving grace. I always get the salted caramel and it is SO good. The cookie is always warm and the vanilla ice cream is so good with it. I will sometimes just get the little mini trios, because I want to try different flavors, but honestly, the salted caramel is my go to. It's delicious and veryyyyy fattening.  Service is pleasant but honestly, trying to catch their attention is hard. You just have to be prepared the server comes to your table so you don't have to keep calling them over. Would come back if there was a special occassion, but not on my own accord."
Andie M.,"Stockton, CA",0,29,8,2.0,12/11/2016,Two stars so my review can be seen wow by far disgusting place went in for a night out with co workers some ordered dinner plates but we all pitched in for appetizers two chicken orders came out raw the first co worker that had gotten there before everyone never got his order who is running this place we work in a top store and know what customer service is and let me tell u that slacked and even made the visit more unpleasant will never return hope they get it together and they better hope they don't get a surprised visit from a undercover visit to see how it's being ran if they do hope they serve cooked chicken
