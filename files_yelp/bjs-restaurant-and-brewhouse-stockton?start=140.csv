Jeanette T.,"Stockton, CA",16,153,891,1.0,11/9/2016,"If I could give a lower Yelp review I would! Sunday November 6,2016 we go to have dinner and arrive at 6:27pm. There is a crowd and we are told it would be a 35 minute wait, gave us a buzzer and we sat down. Well 35 minutes pass, 45 minutes pass and now we are going on a 70 minute wait. We should have left after 50 minutes or sooner actually. My husband goes to counter says we've been waiting for an hour now! She says we are just waiting for to clear a table. NOW mind you several people have been called while we're waiting. 2 people here, 3 people there. Why couldn't they put 2 tables together to accommodate our group. If they are taking 2,3,4 people in a party at a time? They aren't all sitting in booths! So at this point we decide to take our farewell party else where. (Our 6th grader chose Bj's as her farewell dinner before she left for science camp this week.) I was NOT happy at all!! The gal out front was not accommodating or was not very apologetic it was as if we had only been airing 15 minutes not 70 minutes!! She said the kitchen was backed up. So even if we were seated we would still have a wait for the food. This is so ridiculous, and happens often here, the kitchen is always backed up is their excuse as to why the food arrives 30-40 minutes after u order. I was so bothered. I will not go back!! Do yourself a favor GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"
Andrew V.,"Lodi, CA",0,101,60,4.0,6/30/2016,This is a great place for any occasion. Food is ok. I tried their pizza for the first time today and I think that's my new favorite thing. Service is pretty good but it wasn't busy.
Megan W.,"Elk Grove, CA",18,17,,5.0,6/16/2016,"The bartender took my drink and lunch order immediately, and my (delicious and perfectly prepared) food was out almost immediately. She was more than happy to offer a piping hot pizookie, and refilled my tea before I even noticed it was low."
A A.,"Fremont, CA",29,152,269,2.0,5/12/2014,"I honestly don't have much to say. I am very disappointed. I've been to BJs before and I've had their pizza and other dishes. This was by far the worst experience. We kept it simple tonight. Just a veggie pizza, avocado egg rolls, and pizookie. Pizza was terrible. God knows what was wrong... 1/5 Avocado egg rolls: my first time trying. Idk how they are supposed to taste but they were ok 3/5 Pizookie: dessert is always a satisfier 4/5 Food was terrible but the service was ok. The waiter was nice."
Consuelo R.,"Stockton, CA",113,19,76,4.0,6/17/2014,"We came to BJ's to celebrate Father's Day. We like coming to BJ's because of the good food and good service. We have celebrated Mother's Day here before and were happy with the food and service.  Food was good. I enjoyed especially the appetizers we selected. I love their Chicken Pot Stickers and Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I order Classic Breakfast Sandwich. Since I love Bacon, I choose instead of ham or sausage. The sourdough bread was perfect. It is served with yummy seasoned country potatoes.  The service was great. Our server was so helpful! One of the best experience. He went out of his way to assist us.  Great environment!! My family and I are huge sports fan! Love the fact that we can watch the World Cup here while eating."
Racquel Q.,"San Ramon, CA",60,23,1,5.0,6/12/2016,"I have a long history with this place. This is where my fiancé & I had our first dates before we got engaged, back when we were just friends, meeting for dinner & drinks. We moved away, but recently came back to visit & have dinner where it all started. Tonight, just had amazing customer service from Kali. She recommended the portobello strips, which we had with drinks. They came out promptly and she checked up on us frequently to ensure everything was tasting great. I highly recommend you try these portobello strips with the amazing garlic aioli. I ordered the Balsamic Chicken and my fiancé had the Roast Beef Dip sandwich. It was amazing. What made it great was the service. Seriously, sit at any of Kali tables & you'll be well taken care of. She's an amazing server. We've eaten at other BJ's establishments, but her service is worth this 5 star review. I thanked her personally, because even though she was busy, she took the time to make sure our dinner was going well, but she definitely deserves this praise. If we lived in the area, we'd come back more often, just for her."
Julie A.,"San Jose, CA",201,244,335,5.0,7/19/2015,"Came in on a Sunday. Immediate seating available, food was good. The clam chowder in the bread bowls were excellent. The waitress Mayra was on top of everything. Excellent service. Nice location, and a cute area."
Steve D.,"Stockton, CA",113,3,,2.0,12/29/2016,The food was fine but the service is terrible! Took forever to get drinks and our order taken. Then our appetizer food and drinks all came out at the same time and surprise we didn't even have silverware for another 5 minutes. 3rd time in a row we've had bad service.
Monica S.,"Stockton, CA",2,14,65,1.0,9/26/2016,"Again, I decided to give BJs, yet ANOTHER chance to maybe redeem themselves from my last few visits. I am not a tough customer and I am usually very patient. I worked in food places, so I know what it is like from the other end. But I have no idea what is going on here at BJs. One of the worst restaurants in Stockton. All of their dishes taste like its from a microwave. This is definitely not the place to splurge. Everything takes forever to come out. Including drinks! Always! How hard is to get water.... I had to remind the waitress several times, and not once was I offered a refill. I know a guy that used to work here, and asked how it was. He said he stopped eating BJs food because of how disgusting they are in the back. They don't use soap of any kind to wash dishes? Gross. I'm sick of this place and will not be going back. Do NOT recommend."
lou a.,"Stockton, CA",4,99,24,1.0,3/26/2015,"Dam, the wife and I went out on our weds date to BJ's and things didn't go just right... We ordered a 5 meat pizza ( 1st time) they gave us the wrong pizza! We thought they were being extra frugal on the meat...well low and behold our 5 meat pizza arrived over a 1/2 hr later and they took it back! Took me some 15 min to get my diet coke and when the check came they didn't correct the order...  Won't be back that's for sure!"
Jasmine M.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/25/2016,"I am extremely upset with the way the situation was handled. My best friend and I had dinner here last night, we come here all the time and never had such an issue before. We ordered our appetizer, it came out relatively quick, which was great, what wasn't great was the fact that there was a live ladybug on our food. It was still moving and very much alive. It was incredibly disgusting. We attempted to get the attention of several employees, with no luck until finally someone came to our table. She apologized, as well as a young man did too. They claimed the manager would come by and speak to us. Did he ever make his way to our table? Of course not. We waited the whole time and never once did he/she come by. All they did for us, was comp JUST the appetizer. Are you kidding me? Just the appetizer? Not even a talk from the manager? I was so upset, and disappointed with how they handled this. They have lost a customer after this"
Gina G.,"Stockton, CA",89,58,1194,5.0,5/12/2015,"The service and food tonight were spot on! April & I both had the 20 oz Ribeye steaks. My sides were roasted asparagus and horseradish mashed potatoes and she had broccoli and roasted Brussels sprouts. The food was so delicious!  Tonight's cook Nicholas seasoned everything perfectly, and I didn't even need my A-1 sauce! (And I always use A1 on my steaks!). The vegetables were a perfect compliment to a perfect steak!  Our server Erika was very attentive even though she had a busy section. She was pleasant and accommodating. I also want to say that the manager Stephanie made us feel right at home by checking in on us, introducing herself and ensuring that we had a quality experience at BJ'S.   I just want to add that our server tonight and the last time we were here, James, is such a great guy!  I had the endless soup and salad and April had chicken wings. We really enjoyed the food and service again!  James kept bringing more clam chowder and different salads that I kept ordering. We also noticed the stars he was wearing on his collar. One was for him being a trainer and the other was for never being late and never a no show!!!  That's awesome!  He wears them with pride and it shows!  His customer service skills are great!"
Alisha H.,"Manteca, CA",35,9,4,5.0,5/17/2016,"Adriana our server was friendly, professional, knowledgeable & happy to make our visit as she would want to be waited on. The manager that we requested to share her service was great also."
Alysha L.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,4.0,1/2/2017,They were busy but the cherry chipotle salmon and pizzookie was amazing.. also the drink was good as well.
Pam C.,"Evergreen, CO",50,263,10,3.0,8/20/2015,"Hard to review because most of it is based on one bad server.  We arrived and had an awesome server.  She went on break and introduced us to a different server.  He was awful!  He kept forgetting when we ordered something and we would sit there watching him go all over the place without our items.  He was sweating profusely.  The food was just okay.  I've been to BJ's in Huntington Beach and it was a completely different experience.  I would go again, but order something different and hope for a better server."
Donna A.,"Stockton, CA",2,21,,3.0,11/28/2016,"I keep coming back because the food is good, and the selection is amazing.  There really is something for everyone here.  My issue lately is with the service.  In my last 4 visits I have had decent service once.  I have actually walked out once after 20 minutes of not being acknowledge once seated.  My last visit pushed those boundaries too.  After we were seated several employees walked by in the first few minutes.  It was 20 minutes after being seated that someone came to check on us, and I believe that was only because I stood up and looked around.  I was actually reaching for my jacket to leave, when someone came by to see how we were doing.  We placed our order and the food was great.  We ordered the dinner for two with salads, medium pizza, and pizooki.  We had to remind them the pizooki came with the meal and remind them of which one we ordered.  When it was time to leave, we once again had to stand up and look around to get someone's attention in order to get our check.  I am giving them the benefit of the doubt on this one since it was Monday night football.  But if the service does not improve, even great food will not get me back.  Date of visit was 11/21/2016."
Ignacio C.,"Stockton, CA",1,15,1,1.0,12/11/2016,"i went over on 12/10/16. i spent over 70, on dinner. for me and my wife. the service was bad, the food lousy. i should have asked for a refund. they even screwed up my drink. i've been there before, it was great?"
Marlene T.,"Florence, KY",213,227,2241,2.0,2/6/2014,"Ehem, let me state first I am not usually a purveyor of chain restaurants. My friends decided to pick me up so we could all get to the restaurant together and I was staying nearby visiting and the closest. Bad mistake. I should have got there first (1) because the wait for tables is often long (as I observed through our whole visit). And (2) you can't get the happy hour prices unless you sit at the bar area. Which is apparently, always full. When we showed up we were actually seated fairly quickly, which appeared to be a fluke from when we showed up. There were waves of people I saw going in before us, and waves after us. Regardless, I was happy at least about that. We each ordered a beer and decided on a few appetizers as we all just wanted some munchies to share while we chatted. They did bring me a happy hour menu at my request and I could see that we were literally paying double for everything we ordered since we were not in the bar area. I inquired if it was possible to get happy hour prices and was politely informed ""We use different registers on the floor. They aren't programmed to allow us to change the prices even if we wanted to"". I somehow have a hard time believing that they were inept at asking management to comp meals or give discounts. They just weren't probably allowed with this case. Hmm, so this translates to a larger tip for the server and more money for the restaurant and more out of our pockets. Had I not been visiting with friends I would have walked out across the parking lot and headed to Boudin's. The beer was pretty standard issue. The food was decent pub like food. We ordered the margarita flat bread pizza, the boneless wings in spicy sauce, and the calamari. This was enough to feed three people adequately. I read on the menu that the flat bread pizza was 90 calories for each slice and came with 8 slices. Had I been by myself and only ordered that I could have eaten the whole thing. It wasn't filling, the toppings were slopped on without care (the end pieces had no toppings - we used the sauce from the calamari), and it was more like a cracker than a flat bread. I still like crackers so it worked but I was worried I was shoveling calories down my throat and wondered what the heck I was getting out of it. Still, I'll be the first to admit - if you go out to eat, you generally toss the calorie concern out the window. The boneless wings, or glorified chicken chunks were good. The buffalo style sauce was really, really, really salty. I think I would ask for that sauce on the side if we order it again. The blue cheese sauce had a mild hint of blue cheese but as one in my party said ""It might as well be ranch"". The chicken was juicy and well, was chicken. The calamari we ordered with tomato marinara as one in our party we consider allergic to garlic since he is so hypersensitive to it. They were fine with subbing sauce, though he said it wouldn't bother him if we wanted the garlic aioli. I'm not much into mayo so we were all happy to get marinara.  I found a piece of carrot in the boneless wings, which was nummy. And another in our party found a french fry in the calamari. He liked it, but neither was supposed to be in each of those dishes. All in all the food was just so-so, the average for chain restaurants. The beer okay, nothing special. The service was good and prompt and polite. I'm just still horribly offended about the happy hour policy since I've never run into this anywhere else I've eaten. I'm sure it exists at other places, and apologies to be harsh as this is the first place to pop my happy hour expecting bubble. I can't say I'd go out of my way to eat here. I'd probably head over to Applebee's in all honesty for the same quality food, brand name beer I love, and cheaper prices. Oh and the reason it gets knocked down to two stars from an average meh three ... no wifi! Everyone has guest or at the least hot spot wifi in highly commercial restaurant areas. Get with the program! How are we supposed to check into Yelp? Oh right, they're so cheap they want us to use our own bandwidth. Or maybe they don't want us to rate them on Yelp ..."
John F.,"Stockton, CA",0,68,,3.0,12/8/2016,"I went there with my family on a busy night.  The kitchen served our main dish before our appetizers arrived.  Normally I would have asked to cancel the appetizers but our waiter and then the manager came by to apologize for the error and insisted that we receive the appetizers complimentary.  It is refreshing to actually go some place where people are accountable.  Kudos to our waiter and the manager.  Food was good, game was on,  and the Grand Cru hit the spot.  My kids loved this place for the dessert, atmosphere, and comfort food.  Will be back and definitely appreciate staff that are accountable."
Geoffrey G.,"Manteca, CA",1,4,,4.0,5/26/2016,"Management contacted me the next day and apologized for the poor service. It was very prompt after the matter and I'm very glad there is some accountability. Besides an apology they offered to make it up to me. In all honesty, the apology was enough but I'm happy either way. I usually visit the modesto spot but because management was sincere and did something about the situation, I'll give this location another chance. Thanks Joanne, Angel, and the management team for contacting me and I hope this updated review will brighten your spirits."
