Jason M.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",93,7,7,5.0,5/11/2016,"When I am in Stockton for business this this is my go to restaurant. The management and staff does a great job and they always remember to take care of the military. Good food and a solid selection of beers, my personal favorite is the Jeremiah Red."
D. C.,"Lodi, CA",2,35,199,2.0,6/2/2016,"I'm not sure what it is about this place but the first time I left a review we had Lynda who was super unfriendly til we went to pay the bill and give a tip then she pretended to be friendly. Then I had a great server with a group of friends and never got her name, she was very pretty though and was friendly from the beginning. Then just the other day I had Laura who was great the whole time UNTIL I paid my bill. Then I asked for water and she never brought it. Super bizarre. I mean, cuz if I have her again she won't be getting 20% again lol so, not smart to treat your customers like nothing just cuz you got your money. But the nice younger gentleman with the beard, I don't know if he's a servers assistant and a breaker as well but he was insanely friendly also and I hope Bj's treats him well. Because, he treated us great and brought us water in 2 seconds as well as picked up our table and he wasn't even getting a direct tip from us. You the real MVP!"
Ma P.,"Hughson, CA",0,37,7,4.0,11/13/2016,We LOVE BJS! From our experience they always have great food and customer service! They also have a good variety of food. Their pizza is the best pizza around and a pizookie for dessert always makes my day. My husband loves their craft beers while watching sports. It's very clean including restrooms. The only negative thing I have to say is sometimes the wait is a little long especially on weekends but it's like that at most restaurants.
Esteban I.,"Columbia, SC",56,56,168,2.0,3/12/2016,Deep dish took forever it was good tho but to long of a wait waitress took forever on our drinks was rude when I asked her for more rounds place was not even packed! Would not go there again I repeat would not!
Aima D.,"Modesto, CA",1,14,6,3.0,4/6/2016,"2 visits. Same scenario.  I ordered and they brought me the wrong food. 2nd visit they gave us a burn pizza outside and doughy inside. Great manager tho. Employees just need to lose their attitudes. Great food, that's why I come by but y'all needa start serving what we order in the first place & lose the attitude!"
Amanda C.,"Stockton, CA",111,10,7,3.0,2/11/2016,Visited Bjs a few days ago with my friend for some deserts. She ordered a Pizookie and I ordered the Beignet. The beignet was delicious however I was not satisfied with the size. Our waitress was extremely friendly. What really annoyed us was that THREE separate times we were brought different entrees because the waiters and waitresses kept mistaking us for another table. At one point we thought we should just except the food but we never did.
David T.,"Stockton, CA",183,13,,3.0,6/13/2016,"Love the pizzas and the pazooki's! But the rest of the menu is not as high of quality in my opinion. Definitely don't go here for a quiet night, as it's almost always buzzing with customers and multiple tv's with all the games on. Solid restaurant."
Iesha S.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,,5.0,5/23/2016,The service was great...Felicia was so sweet and kept us updated with our food and drinks. We did order too much so remember the portion sizes are substantial and trust me I love to eat so keep that in mind.
Anthony I.,"Stockton, CA",1,4,,2.0,5/28/2015,"We USED to frequent this place fairly often...however the last 4-5 times we have had servers who did not acknowledge us, got orders wrong, did not refill our drinks and all sorts of other normal stuff you would expect a waiter to take care of to your satisfaction.  This time will be the last time we return. After sitting at a table without being acknowledged again for over 10 MINUTES and plenty of staff, and my wife's meal STILL wrong, I can not fault the waiters, but I DO hold management fully responsible for the decline of what was once a great place to go and enjoy a meal. I hope they decide to take their customers seriously and get it back on track. Had the food been burnt or otherwise unsatisfactory, this place would get a solid 1 star.  As a side note, the only time we have had a good experience was when Aaron would help us out because we knew him personally."
Andrea A.,"Stockton, CA",16,51,24,5.0,1/9/2015,Jasma was my takeout host and she was super sweet!  I received my free pazookie for my birthday. I always recommend the Tuscan Chicken Limone. Super delicious !
John M.,"Stockton, CA",24,40,12,2.0,6/13/2015,Quick to up sale you Nice staff cuisine is ok overpriced Especially happy hour Avocado egg rolls 10 $ 4 little pieces  Calamari 10 $ on a dish over 14 inches It seems Food is outrageous to eat out
Maryanne C.,"Cerritos, CA",409,12,38,3.0,5/12/2016,"BJ's is one of those places, you know you'll get decent food. The service I think depends on whose serving, since this is a chain restaurant there is a lot of staff turnover. So you'll never know if you'll get great service or not. When I went, it was one of those days where the service wasn't that great. Water wasn't served immediately and when we needed something it took forever. However, the food was pretty good. I got the Bacon Guacamole Deluxe burger with the thin fries. The burgers and fries did the job. The burger was juicy and the fries were crispy. However, don't come here expecting amazing food, since it is a chain family restaurant. You'll always get continuity in the quality of food and taste."
Stephanie H.,"Stockton, CA",69,11,31,5.0,5/29/2016,"Awesome place for good food. I don't think I've ever ordered something I regretted. Atmosphere is nice if noisey, but hey its a brewhouse."
leslie e.,"Woodland, CA",40,6,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Terrible experience, not returning. Order came out wrong, waitress offered comped dessert, manager then took offer to comp us back. Then we got charged for items not ordered. Garbage  management."
Sabrina C.,"Ceres, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/13/2016,"First time: was good. Had a big group. Family dinner. Good was good, I had clam chowder in a bread bowl. Family got pasta. Salad. Ribs. Only complain is the bread knots that came with the pasta were either frozen or raw. 2nd time: today.... I order a deep dish pasta and it was cold in the middle,meat,cheese, pasta. Manger talked to us. Was very nice offered to take care of us for desserts and I got a new deep dish pasta. I finally got it when everyone in my group was finished eating and I was also full with the food my family shared with me... Bill comes in. I get my food. And I still have to pay for my plate.... And at the end we never got the Dessert that was promised.  Great service even after a simple mistake. But I feel like it was all talk and no action. My family and friends will not coming back."
Kenny T.,"Stockton, CA",94,20,,1.0,11/8/2016,"Been coming here for years, the food was great at first. The quality of the food here now is mediocre and can be better prepared at home. Not only is the quality lacking, they began reducing the quantity in some of their appetizers. Cutting corners to save money? I dont know, but this place needs to reevaluate their standards here."
Dawn O.,"Tracy, CA",58,21,4,2.0,1/29/2016,"Came here for lunch with my roommate and her cousin. All around everything was meh and blah. We sat in the bar around 1pm. Ordered a Skinny margarita and Watermelon Basil margarita while we waited for our third person to show up. The first Skinny was great but the Watermelon Basil was PURE syrup. Made my stomach ache after one swig (ended up ordering a second Skinny one halfway through the meal and that one was on par with the Watermelon Basil). Received a little attitude from the server when we asked to replace the the Watermelon Basil with a Jameson and Ginger Ale, but felt justified when we over heard the waiter tell the manager that we wanted to send it back and the manager said ""Yeah, that looks really dark"".  Ordered the Ahi Poke for our appetizer and it was good. Ended up getting 2 Ahi Salad entrées and we were disappointed that the Ahi on the Poke appetizer was MUCH better than the Ahi on the salads. The Salad Ahi was slivered, stringy, pieces with goopy breading. The other entrée we ordered was the Lunch Special half flatbread/half salad. The Chicken Club flatbread was ""just okay"" and the salad was an optionless, plain, mediocre (""at best"") side. Yelp has a coupon that gives you buy one, get one entrée free from 11-3 which is restricted to one per table even if requesting separate checks. No biggie, but the roommate and I each have a manly man that were requesting grub so it was a slight disappointment. Probably won't return unless we're just coming for drinks.  TL;DR: Meh, you're better off going elsewhere."
Gabrielle Andrea Mullen C.,"Stockton, CA",221,9,3,1.0,8/11/2016,"I only come to the BJ's in Stockton when I feel like having a pizookie. Their pizookies are so delicious, and so worth my $7! Unfortunately, I'd still have to rate this location 1 star since their customer service is so poor. I love going out to eat with my fiance on Friday nights, and I wish that this BJs location was as good as other locations that I've been to. After a long week, I enjoy going out to dinner on Friday nights, but I don't intend to spend 35-40+ minutes for waiting on my food. I think I have been to this location about 3-4 times since we moved here about a year ago. I think the first time we went here, we waited about 20 minutes just for a server to greet us at our table, and that was after I stared people down, lol. I just didn't know who to ask. The other servers didn't want to make eye contact, or they were too busy with the tables they were serving. I don't blame them, but we sat there wondering what we should do. I even asked myself if they forgot about us! If I am desperate and craving a pizookie, I'll come here. Their prices here would be worth it if their service matched it. But spending like $60 on a dinner for two (for entrees, drinks, and a pizookie) isn't worth it to me if we gotta wait 20 minutes to be greeted after sitting down + another 35-40 minutes to get our dinner before our appetizers, plus another 25 minutes to get dessert, and another 20 after that to get the check. Not to mention last time, they brought us our appetizers halfway through our food. I also like to have my pasta with tobasco. It's simple, I know. But my point is that I didn't see my server until maybe 20 minutes after my food was served by someone else. When I needed something, my server wasn't around to ask. I gave up, and asked someone else. Honestly, I'm a pretty patient person. And it was just a shame that neither of our encounters there did we have servers that told us what was going on. I know they're busy, but each time, we probably only saw our server when we ordered, and after the food came because someone else served it to us. It would have just been nice to at least have someone just tell us one time out of our 3-4 long encounters, ""Your food will be out shortly."" Unfortunately, I'll probably still be back because I love their pizookies. 5 stars for their food & the greeters at the front! But just one star given all because of the repetitive poor service when it comes to the dining portion."
James J.,"Stockton, CA",19,109,35,3.0,1/11/2015,"Pros:  open late, Pizzookies are awesome, they have a craft cider on tap.  Cons:  Drives me crazy that they make people wait for a table, just because they are trying to keep half the restaurant closed. Server was friendly enough, but we didn't get checked on during the meal.  Neutral: burger was very bland."
Ray A.,"Tracy, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/30/2016,Appetizer plates were dirty and ordered a medium on my burger came out dryer there can be won't be coming back
