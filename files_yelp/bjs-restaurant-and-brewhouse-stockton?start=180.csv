Manice T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,1,3.0,3/31/2015,"We'd argue that the selection and food execution at most BJ's is strong.  Some clear strengths for this and all BJs would be in food variety, savory items, and courteous servers.  The challenges would be in this BJs' handling of long wait lines and managing customer time at tables.  Overall, it's solid. The following categorical scores are all out of 5; when combining them (weighing taste more heavily), they explain our overall Yelp rating. TASTE: 3.5 Like a good set of tires, their food is reliably good but nothing you should dream about, unless you're a weirdo.  The pizza, burgers, and calamari are items we've tried and have found to be solid.  The pizza is Chicago-style, but not overly heavy.  The burgers are thick and well-sauced; you have multiple bun options. SERVICE: 3 The servers are always pleasant if not energetic.  They don't take reservations and leave something to be desired in time management.  Expect long ques that, during peak times, can be unmitigated disasters. EXPERIENCE/AMBIANCE: 4 The general vibe is fun and relaxed.  The game is on, minus the overly zealous (drunk) fans. VALUE:  3 The prices are basically fair; no steals and only a few rip-offs. TOTAL SCORE: 3.4 RECOMMENDATION Avoid BJ's at peak times on Friday or Saturday.  Instead, come during the week or on Sunday for lunch. We hope this helps!"
Rene R.,"Stockton, CA",3,25,,1.0,10/25/2015,"This was the crappiest service we have had in a long long time.  Food was ok. We ordered three appetizers: the calamari, chicken wings, and stuffed mushrooms. We also ordered the burger for my son. We would have ordered more but the appetizers took so long to get to the table that we figured we were spending enough. Mushrooms were ok; they were stuffed with spinach with pesto cream sauce drizzle.  I liked the pesto flavor.  Calamari was a little overdone--the marinara sauce was flavorless, but the white dipping sauce was good and garlicky.  Chicken wings were done as expected. My son had the brewhouse burger.  He said it was good. The problem was mostly with the service. We ordered drinks and appetizers at the same time. We got nothing for the longest time. My mom was coughing and we had to ask another wait person for just some water. And still we waited!!! Rude!!!!!!!!  Then our waitress approached the table and said she was sorry but she was really busy with a large party at another table.  My mother said we would like a different waitress then.  We still had no drinks or appetizers.   The second waitress came soon after and took our entire order again.  That is when I added the burger to the order because my son was hungry.  Then we waited some more for our beverages. Finally the iced tea came but my son's cream soda had not come. The cream soda finally came. Then his burger came right afterward--before the appetizers!!!!  They were busy. It was a Sunday afternoon.  But you would think they would prepared for it. I am sure this was not a unique Sunday afternoon."
Alice C.,"Tracy, CA",4,82,4,2.0,1/8/2015,"We hadn't been here in awhile.  Other than the Pazookie (which is always good), you get a 50/50 chance of getting decent food.   On our last visit, I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad.   Usually, it's very good for such a simple salad.  This time, it was barely defrosted.  I also ordered the spaghetti marinara.  It tasted like one of my frozen diet lunches.  I've heard that BJ's doesn't technically have a kitchen, they only heat up frozen meals but this was ridiculous.  I've been here before and have received a half cooked baked potato.   Bottom line:  Only go here for the Pazookie or maybe drinks."
Chris S.,"Manteca, CA",40,3,1,5.0,2/14/2015,"If you're looking for a fine dining experience, but casual dressed, this is the place for you! Bj's obviously takes pride in their customer service, presentation, and needless to say their food is outstanding! You can get anything from deep dish pizza, burgers, salads, seafood, to steak! They have a full service bar with a fantastic selection. They are quick with serving, and expect you to leave with a satisfied stomach. We came here on Valentine's day and received the best service we have ever experienced in a restaurant. We highly recommend their deep dish pizzas, and this restaurant!"
Dee B.,"Shasta Lake, CA",71,121,196,4.0,4/5/2015,"I hadn't been here in awhile. I don't mosey into Stockton that much. However, I was surprised that it wasn't packed since it was Easter! It took a little while for a server to start us out but once he did, it was all good. I enjoyed my Calirornia burger. It was like a patty melt with green chiles, cheese and onions on toasted bread.  We started out with Fritos Nachos. Meh. The beans were good in it but I wished I had ordered my fave, the avocado rolls. The beer hit the spot! I'm happy I didn't have to cook today! Love the chandeliers and vibe of the place! I'll be back."
Denise N.,"Sacramento, CA",1,20,1,1.0,9/15/2015,So I only write reviews when I get terrible service and it takes a lot to get me to write a review but here we go. I am currently here during lunch and most of mutable ordered simple things like salad and soups that took over 1 hour to make. That's fine do their busy I'm very understanding however the waitress never once came by to say our food would be coming out soon  and on top of that would roll her eyes whenever we would order more food. We only ordered when she came to our table and with 5 people sharing one pazookie she rolled her eyes once again because we asked for 5 spoons. Shoot me right? And lastly never filled my water once and got the wrong order. I will say her name started with an A so watch out for waitresses that start with an A
Sherri S.,"Stockton, CA",4,10,2,5.0,3/30/2016,"I brought my family (husband and grown sons + girlfriend) here for my birthday 3/25 for a few reasons - I love the twisted BLT salad(without feta), the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and the beignet with strawberries.  They were all fantastic, just as I'd hoped they'd be! My husband likes the pizza, recently changing to the Tavern Cut thin crust Market Tavern Pizza. He's ordered this twice now, this time without the peppers(pretty spicy); I love the crispness of the crust.   One of my sons had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which was delicious, his gf had a burger (she let me steal a couple of fries), but the burger was cooked perfectly and looked juice and really good!  Another son had the jambalaya. I didn't try the jambalaya, but it looked wonderful and my son ate the whole thing so it must've been good!(he's my picky son.)  My last son had the clam chowder bread bowl which was very filling. The top of the clam chowder bowl was buttered and grilled like crispy garlic bread - it was very tasty!  Of course we received the free pazooki - which my husband ate all of and enjoyed every bite! I ordered the monkey bread pazooki to taste and so I wouldn't be eating my beignet alone! The monkey bread pazooki was fabulous! A cinnamon roll flavored pull apart bread with vanilla bean ice cream, of course everyone had a bite and wanted more! But my favorite is the beignet! I wanted to eat every bite, but thought I'd better share. We couldn't decide which we liked better, the monkey bread pazooki or the beignet!  The waiter was fun & patient, he put up with us keeping him waiting when trying to take our order! He kept my iced tea refilled as well as refilling sodas & root beers without being asked! It was a great birthday dinner with my family!"
Jacqueline R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2491,927,2572,3.0,4/4/2011,"Pretty good, it's a nice casual place to go with friends. Lunchtime is relatively mellow, but it gets ridiculously crowded at dinnertime and you're better off making a reservation beforehand, otherwise be prepared to wait for a very long time. It's definitely a great place to have a birthday celebration or anything similar to that because they've got a wide variety of dishes on their menu. Most of the time the service is pretty good. I've only been disappointed with the service once and that was when I was in a party of 10. The waitress got some of the orders wrong, and when she came out with the right orders, she handed them out to the wrong people -.-  Also, if you're a student at UOP, you can use your Pacific Cash here! Definitely a plus. Except for one time when I wanted to use my Pacific Cash and their machine was broken..."
Akaisha D.,"Whittier, CA",0,21,5,5.0,8/10/2016,"Came here on Sunday for our date and I ordered a Mediterranean chicken Pita wraps which were really good and comes with a fresh rice which has corn, Pomergrante or cranberry seeds, tomatoes and Cucumber in it aswell as a orange cream float that I had changed to a milkshake 10/10. My boyfriend ordered a French bowl soup which he enjoyed aswell with sparkling raspberry Lemonade 10/10. Neither of us had any complaints and we both left with Togo boxes. Our server was fast and attentive aswell."
Casey A.,"Lodi, CA",3,54,17,3.0,9/20/2015,"My family and I enjoy the 2 for $25.00 meal (pizza, salad & pizookie). We come here quite often when that deal is being offered. This is the closest to our house so we typically go to this location. We had a pretty bad experience that last time we were here. So bad that the Manager sent us a $10.00 gift card to use at another time. Since the deal is being offered again, we thought we would give it another shot.  We went for dinner last Saturday. We arrived early (around 4:30pm). We were seated fairly quickly since they weren't that busy but then everything went downhill from there. Since we knew what we were having, we ordered right away. We actually upgraded our pizza to a large (for $3.00 more) and added a side salad for our son. About 45 minutes went by and then our pizza finally arrived. The only issue, we never received our salads. Our waitress never came back to check on us. The person that delivered our pizza said they would check on our salads. A few minutes went by and out came our salads and then our waitress came by to say that she was sorry that no one ever brought them out. A few minutes after that the Manager came over to apologize for the delay.  I was shocked to say the least at what the Manager had to say. He apologized for the delay and then proceeded to tell us that he could not remove the price of the salads from our bill since it was part of the $25.00 deal. First of all, we never asked to speak to a Manager. Secondly, we never asked for anything to be removed from our bill. That is not in our nature. And lastly, we did order an extra side salad and I had a soda so if he really wanted to remove something from our bill, he could have removed either one of those items. For the three of us to eat a pizza and salad, we were there for almost 2 hours. I am sorry but they did not have any large parties when we arrived so I could not understand why it took so long. I did overhear another waiter telling the table next to us that they were short-staffed and that several of the waiters were picking up extra tables to help out.  Since we were disappointed once again, I do not know that we will go back to this location."
Joy R.,"Stockton, CA",107,53,,4.0,3/26/2016,"I've been to BJ's several times.  The food is usually quite good.  The prices are a bit high, but not so much that I won't go.  The only  negative thing I can say is that all of their desserts could serve 4 people.  It would be nice if a smaller sized dessert were available."
Adrionna P.,"Stockton, CA",3,14,2,3.0,8/29/2014,"Let me start off by saying that I HATE the hostesses. They are all so incredibly rude and b*tchy (with the exception of one shorter girl who I want to say is Latina. She's always a doll). Every time I go in they remind me why I never go as often as I used to. And they are the reason BJs gets only three stars from me. It seriously ruins my experience every time.  As far as wait staff goes, my servers are always incredibly friendly, and I always try to tip the good ones well. The food is pretty good, and if you stick to the basics it's even really good! I always get half California chicken club sandwich and half Caesar salad and its super satisfying."
Julia W.,"Stockton, CA",44,171,,3.0,1/13/2016,"My husband and I used to eat here a lot years ago but we stopped when their service started going downhill. Don't get me wrong, the food is great but the service not so much. Takes a good amount of time for orders to arrive. Then when it's time to pay the bill, getting the bill itself is a task. God forbid you have to get change or have them take your debit card then returning with change or the receipt takes way too long."
Celeste M.,"Fresno, CA",5,5,1,5.0,3/20/2016,Had dinner here the other night. For the first time. Our waitress was the best. Her name is Amanda. The food was excellent the service was excellent and the drinks were awesome. The manager even came up to our table to introduce herself. The ambiance was nice and not too loud. TVs all over the place with sports on them. It was a great experience. Going there again this time trying breakfast.
Nikki P.,"San Ramon, CA",110,100,57,3.0,4/27/2013,"BJ's is my go to place if I can't decide where else to eat or if I'm craving a pizookie. Honestly, the best things on the menu are the pizookies because let's face it: you can't get it as good as BJ's has it. Any other pizookie imitation is just not the same! As for their other food items, they have their share of pretty good dishes, but it's not like their stuff is anything special. It's just alright food.  The atmosphere is definitely great if you want to go out for a special night. The ambiance is cool and hip, if you know what I mean.  Be warned: it gets pretty crowded during dinner time on the weekends, so expect a long wait. Also, service is so-and-so. Some nights, it's good. Some nights, it's eh.  If you have never been to BJ's, try the pizookie. It will be all you dream about the next days after that because it's THAT good."
Patricia A.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/10/2016,"Usually have good service and brought my mother in law for the 1st time, they did not give a good impression. Service started off bad didn't come and get our drink orders after over 10 min of waiting had to get hostess to find our waitress, didn't bring plates for our appetizers had to ask, messed up on my order, didn't check on us after we got the food. Very disappointed. But she was good with refills I could tell she was trying because she knew I wasn't happy."
Rachel T.,"Stockton, CA",17,6,,4.0,3/10/2016,"I like that the food is consistent, whether you like it or not, the late happy hour, good selection of IPAs and more often than not ... The awesome service!"
Guy H.,"Stockton, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/22/2016,"Terrible service, try to call & make reservations & hostess says they dont do reservations , but when we showed up other people were getting seated for reservations. They sat about 8 parties of 5 -6 people before us. Manager was a real pleasure  (NOT any help whatsoever) just made excuses. Manager Said 2 tables were ready but we still waited 15 more minutes."
Bianka S.,"Stockton, CA",0,6,,4.0,3/22/2016,"My husband and I were waited on by DANIELLA H., and we were so impressed by her attitude. She was pleasant, patient, and professional. She had a warm smile and great people skills! I can be a picky eater and not once did she make me feel like I was a bother or inconvenience- most waiters reveal their agitation making it uncomfortable to ask for anything. We left not only with full stomachs but with a great experience. She has earned BJ's future business from us."
Laura C.,"Salida, CA",6,9,20,5.0,4/24/2015,Came here after watching a play and the pizza awesome... Corn bacon fritters the best!!! Pizzokis!!
