Breanne R.,"Stockton, CA",102,41,5,4.0,6/25/2015,"It's what you would expect for a normal chain brew co. .the food is consistent, the service can be a little slow on busy days but normally it is good. The bar has great selection. The bartenders will make almost anything for you, even if you have to explain it to them. They also know when to cut people off when they have had too much, weather it is you or someone else."
Grace W.,"Sacramento, CA",27,68,4,5.0,5/31/2014,"I, come here with my bf, once in a while. We love their pizzas and we order the pizzas more than anything else on the menu.  Usually , we never asked for extra things and we like to make everyone's life easy. A few weeks back, we added artichokes onto our pizza ,which there was none. the pizza had a great amount of toppings and it looked great so we told our waiter, to just minus off the artichokes.  *our server is awesome, btw!  Yesterday,  my bf asked for extra slices of tomatoes on his pizza , which there was none . The pizza looks like a digiorno pizza . My bf was pretty upset and told the waiter that they forgot his tomatoes and basically he had better pizza's from there.  *the amount of topping was thrown in one spot . For a $20 pizza  in that size , i would expect more than the usual amount of toppings spread out, EVENLY.  now, things get more interesting !  I find that they tend to like to find at least ""one"" piece of your add on. With our ""artichoke's""  incident . Our waiter tried to point out a small piece of onion and  then he took a closer look and said ""oh its an onion."" our waiter from yesterday , told my bf that the extra tomatoes he asked for was not the sliced roma tomatoes. however , what is on the pizza is still the ""extra"" tomatoes  . he offered to have them remake the pizza with the slice tomatoes . which my bf said "" ok"" before the waiter left he stated  ""let me go talk to my manager."" The manager came by , stated that the waiter told him that my bf  wanted to talk to him. which my bf never did request for .  The manager  told my bf that those tomatoes are on every pizza.  And I am sitting here thinking, your worker just told us that , those are extra tomatoes ?!!!! just not sliced.  So all and all , The manager gave us the pizzas for free .  Am i satisfied' on how the manager handle the situation?  OF COURSE!  HAPPY  BJING!"
Jasmine S.,"Irvine, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/25/2015,"This is the most horrible Bjs I have been too don't deserve even one star!   Worst service ever,  chowder bowl burnt and hardly any chowder, took 30 minutes to get a new one, took 40 minutes to get our food.  By the time I got mine it was luke warm.   Sloppy presentation, way too much salt made my mouth burn.  Waitress said  even they use herbs only and no salt.  Waitress spilled drinks and don't apologize.  She acted nice but not once came to refill drinks.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!  Long ticket times and no apologies for the delay is bad customer service!"
Richard P.,"Stockton, CA",0,28,4,3.0,2/2/2016,"This place gets it wrong more often than right. The service is fairly consistent and friendly, but once the order is taken something strange happens. There is some type of communication breakdown between the front of the house staff and the kitchen staff. Anytime I slightly modify an order, it comes out wrong. We're talking salad dressing on the side people nothing fancy. Sometimes the food comes up quickly, sometimes it takes forever. It's frustrating, because we never know if we're going to have a good experience or not. The only reason we return is because of our son who loves the desserts.  They have an excellent drink selection, and many items on the menu to choose from. I just wish they would fix their glitches. Perhaps place an expediter in the kitchen to ensure all the orders are going out correctly and in a timely manner. If that's not the problem, then perhaps some additional training for the front of the house. They have a great concept, they just need to fine tune it."
Domingo V.,"Stockton, CA",3,2,49,3.0,7/18/2013,We went there one day when I got my daughter after work. I thought we'd catch the end of the 9ers vs. NYG game.  They cant cook a Berger Well Done to save their lives!  (I sent back 2x) I ended up w/ free dinner X2.  The Parmesan chicken was good!. Desert was also very good!
Jessica T.,"Galt, CA",445,7,1,1.0,8/27/2015,"So I ask the host is it lunch special hours and she looks at me and says ""I'm just the host I'm not sure"" ummmm okay I used to work at the Elk Grove BJs and I had to know that information. Server with short curly hair was slow never refilled our drinks and served our soup with our meals. Never checked on us. Btw it was lunch special hours"
Gary R.,"Lodi, CA",6,4,7,2.0,8/26/2015,"I enjoy the food and friendly staff. Tonight however I found a calamari in the ranch dressing bowl for my potato skins. I advised the staff and they apologized for it, even the manager apologized, but they still charged us for the skins. I thought for sure they would have comp'd it due to the incident."
Denice E.,"Stockton, CA",4,34,19,2.0,4/13/2015,"My parents and I go to BJ's quite often because we LOVE the Santa Fe salad.  We had dinner there yesterday and we all ordered Santa Fe salads. We were disappointed because we usually get strips of chicken and avocado on top of the salad, but this time the chicken and avocado was not even visible. We had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken inside the salad.  I would've given only 1 star, but the waitress was very nice and attentive. 1 extra star for that. Get it together BJ's or else we'll just have to find another place to eat on weekends!"
Kacey T.,"Stockton, CA",35,13,4,4.0,5/29/2015,"Updating my review because of a recent experience .. I'm usually pretty iffy about coming here because their service is usually bad but sometimes I just can't say no to a great white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. We came here one night for a birthday and it was extremely packed so the 15 minute wait for a table was expected and bearable . Our server, Michael greeted us within minutes for drinks and then back again for our food . The wait for the food was also extremely long but then again, it was pretty busy. Overall, service was great, food was delicious and this was by far the most satisfying visit at Bj's for me (:"
Tia P.,"Stockton, CA",1,8,1,2.0,12/23/2014,"The one thing I can't stand is when a waiter does not write down the orders. I asked the waiter if I could substitute mashed potatoes for another side because it upsets my stomach and he said that I could, so I did. About 15-20 minutes later when the food comes out, I see a big glob of mashed potatoes on my plate. I was disappointed but didn't say anything because it already took a while for the food to come out. The waiter also didn't seem to care for his job.  The food was good and there was no wait for us to be seated."
Aron E.,"Tracy, CA",25,9,1,3.0,5/20/2014,"BJ's has been a stalwart favorite of mine for the past two years. Mozzarella sticks are ridiculously cheesy goodness and my personal favorite item on the menu - crispy, seasoned well, and come with a delicious marinara sauce that disappears all too quickly. The mocktails (a play on 'cocktails', which are sweet mixes of fruit juices and tea or soda) have forced me to completely ignore their other soft drinks. Tonight was date night and my wife wanted a burger and fries. BJ's was the obvious choice. Our waitress was nothing special, but the manager was on top of it; just as I'd finished gabbing, I'd noticed my salmon was taking a bit too long to arrive. This is when he came in and told us what was going on with my meal and offered free soup to tie me over, then dessert on the house. Holy smokes, didn't see that coming! But when the salmon came, it was devoid of anything resembling flavor. And I ordered it blackened. Oh my. We finished the evening with a delectable cinnamon bun with ice cream and strawberries on it. Once we got the tab, something I was not expecting appeared on the receipt: a recommended tip. This is the first time I had ever seen this at BJ's and I was none too pleased about it. Whether this is new policy or obvious begging from our overeager manager, I felt pressured to spend more than I'd planned, a notion alone that soured a bit of my experience. Not sure if I want to return to a place where gratuity is taken for granted. I may update this review on my next visit to observe whether or not these new receipts have become a constant. If they have, this is the last time I'm emptying my wallet for BJ's."
Alex L.,"San Jose, CA",1490,454,9470,4.0,3/28/2011,"Coming here on any weekend night is probably not a good idea.  The wait can be excruciating long.  Luckily for us, we walked right up to a booth in the bar area when someone was leaving!   I ordered the full rack of ribs with baked potato, the house salad, and calarmari as the appetizer.  Sunshine (our Waitress' name) brought it out lickety split and it was a nice portion to share.  For our entree, it took FIVEVER (longer than FOREVER).  Our lovely ray of Sunshine kept telling us ""it'll be right out"", ""it's on its way"", ""thank you for being patient, it'll be right out"".  Shoot, even the manager came by and told us ""thank you for waiting"".  He offered us some complimentary appetizer or dessert, but we already finished off the tentacles an hour ago so I counteroffered (because I'm Chinese and that's what Chinese people do) by asking him to take off a glass of wine off the bill.  He mentioned that he's unable to comp alcohol, but he'd go ahead and take 1/2 off our entrees.  Do I have ""stupid"" on my forehead?  Hale yeah!  That's like $20 off vs. $9 off.   Thanks Mister Manager.  You da bomb.   Then the ribs came out.  Argh.  Not good.  Not only was it not good, but it was dry, tough, and nasty.  I guess it's my fault for ordering ribs at a brewery huh?  The baked potato was like ginormous.  It was about the same size as a brick and about as dry as it too.  Ok, this spud's staying here and not riding along the ""take out"" box with the ribs.   Although the food wasn't all that great, I would still give BJs a solid 4 stars for the accomodation, service, and ""for trying"".  They didn't have to do any comping and it was probably my fault for ordering anything but a burger and fries and getting sloshed on their beer.  This is still a great place to eat with a decent ambiance.  Thanks for the great service.  I love me some BJ :)"
Isa R.,"Stockton, CA",0,11,2,3.0,1/9/2016,"It's what anyone can expect from a chain restaurant. Mediocre food and less than spectacular service. I've dined here several times thinking that maybe it will be better than the last experience. Nope. My plate was messy and the food unappetizing. Pizookies are good though. I mean, how bad can you mess up a giant cookie?"
Gary L.,"Palo Alto, CA",0,8,2,3.0,11/30/2015,Did ray charles cut my pizza..And who made it taste like cinammon terrible lemonade was bomb though
Geremie R.,"Stockton, CA",97,3,,1.0,7/19/2015,"This place used to be good. And it no longer is. The salmon was dry. Some of the other times my food came cold. And the most recent time the service was terribly slow. 40 minutes between placing the order and receiving the food; and it wasn't a busy night. The veteran waiters and waitresses are great, but the learning curve for the newbies is not looking all too good. And it's so dark in the restaurant and at one point the lights dimmed almost all the way done."
Chris S.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2017,"We used to like BJ's but the last two times we have gone there, the food and service has been terrible. They obviously don't care because they aren't fixing the problem. Recently we ordered a spinach dip appetizer, it came out cold. We complained so they took it back and reheated it. The Mgr came over and said he'd comp the app. My wife's sandwich came out with burnt bread. Sent it back and the next came out with in toasted bread...this was a dip sandwich so toasting the bread helps it not turn to mush when you dip it. She was hoping to eat half and save half...we chucked the second half. The chef/lead cook came to the table to discuss our complaint, he was nice and understood. They comped the sandwich but when we got the bill the app was back on there....such a disappointment. I didn't say anything else, tipped my server based on what the total bill would have been including the cost of the comped sandwich (wasn't her fault) and left. We won't be back anytime soon for sure. Not even sure why I'm giving one star....my sandwich was good so I guess that's why.."
Frank N.,"San Francisco, CA",4,33,2,1.0,7/31/2014,"I've been to BJs many many times since they been open and I feel as though their service has been lacking as of late. Partly due to waiters and waitress but I think a good part having to management not properly scheduling or cutting cost.  The food is not bad, its what you can expect from a chain restaurant. Drinks are decent and prices okay. The one star is strictly due to their inattentive staff. The last 4-5 times I've been here there's usually one server for the WHOLE bar area. This is unacceptable especially when it was a busier night. I didn't see too many other servers throughout the restaurant either. The server would come by every once in 30-40 minutes but wouldn't really check or ask if everything was okay."
Tiffany N.,"Santa Clara, CA",160,147,609,5.0,8/18/2012,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!  I always, always, ALWAYS come here for birthday dinners because of the free pizookies!!!! So mouth-wateringly satisfying for dessert lovers like me!!!  I love the variety of their menu!!!!!! I also love the fact that the calories are displayed beside the menu items so it's easy to make health-conscious meal decisions!!!! Plus, you can get your pizza with WHEAT CRUST!  AVOCADO EGGROLLS ARE A MUST! Fried calamari is very crispy and delicious as well! The New Orleans Jambalaya is also one of my faves!  Price is just right and it's definitely always crowded!  The only thing I have to complain about is the wait time!!!!! Just another excuse to enjoy a few appetizers and catch up with the fam &/or friends while waiting, I guess!!!!"
Deeba E.,"Tracy, CA",5,13,15,1.0,3/26/2015,Food was okay ..but our server MIKE was not attentive at all. It took 3 walk bys before he refilled our water. Then he brings the bill before our water was filled and dessert! Felt completely rushed
Courtney P.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,4.0,12/11/2015,Had the sweetest little waitress. I believe her name was Stephanie.  She was very attentive and seemed to really love her job !
