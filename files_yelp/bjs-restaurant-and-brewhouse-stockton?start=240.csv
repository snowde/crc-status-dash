Robert M.,"Stockton, CA",275,143,55,5.0,4/20/2015,"One of our standby restaurants. Always great food. Service is great. The pazookies are amazing. If you haven't had one you have to try one. Very good low CAL menu. But don't worry, there's plenty for those who want to pound on the calories."
Jondell T.,"Stockton, CA",1,20,,5.0,6/5/2016,This was a great restaurant. I loved the food and drinks that they had put on the menus. There were a lot of TVs that played the same channel. The waiters were very nice. This is a great place to go with your family.
Kris S.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,32,10,5.0,2/16/2014,We are frequent BJ diners...  Always great. On a rewards program.. You should join it if you go here often.  Ahi salad and chicken lettuce wraps are my staples. Kris likes the jambalaya.
Janet D.,"San Jose, CA",104,1216,1381,3.0,7/1/2014,"Just ok. The best part of my meal was my pizookie. Otherwise, I'd say the food was just ok. Friendly staff that seemed to be on top of their game which i appreciate."
Steve W.,"Stockton, CA",0,10,,4.0,11/27/2015,"How did they get corporate to aprove that name?  High priced corporate designed restaurant and menu. Along the lines of Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Elephant Bar type restaurants"
Dennis R.,"Herald, CA",27,21,2,2.0,8/27/2015,Kitchen must be upside down partial orders coming out. Could not put out a full order my food for sure sat under heat lamp for a while.
RJ H.,"Stockton, CA",1,4,2,5.0,6/18/2016,"Greeted by our favorite server Sunshine who recommended a new appetizer of deep fried asparagus which were a great start. My jambalaya was tasty, tangy and everything I expected. Another great evening at BJs, thank you"
Mary F.,"Lodi, CA",732,98,268,5.0,3/29/2014,We always go to this BJ's when we all want something different.  There menu is so large and someone can find anything they want.   Bathroom is always clean Restaurant is always clean (especially during rushes) Staff is always knowledgeable  Very kid friendly with menu choices.
Ashley G.,"Manteca, CA",203,10,,3.0,9/8/2015,"Came here the other night for a friends 21st birthday. After being sat we waited about 40 minutes for our server to finally come up and greet us!! The only reason im giving a 3 star rating is because we were switched to a different server (Chris) who was amazing!! After that the evening was great! All the food, drinks, sides etc. arrived promptly, and everyone was given free dessert (and we had 12 ppl) Whoop whoop!"
Moua L.,"Concord, CA",179,356,434,4.0,1/8/2012,"So glad I decided to come here instead of a Pho house.  The recommendations from the waiter was outstanding. He was so truthful and I love that. It's all about the Seared Ahi Tuna salad. This plate was enough to feed 3 of us. The salad dressing was one of the best dressings I've had in a long time as well. Hope it's not filled with high fructose corn syrup. That would be just wrong.  In addition to getting the salad, we had ourselves each a cocktail (which were on the sweeter side) and calamari appetizers. We asked the waiter if they were fresh and we got ""fresh"" calamari.    This place is now on the top of my list of places to go to when visiting Stockton."
Lee N.,"Hilmar, CA",195,16,,1.0,11/8/2013,"Warning! Warning! HORRENDOUS service! 15 minutes to get noticed, 45 minutes to get the pazookie and pint that was ordered....45 minutes!! Does it really take that long to pour a pint and put some ice cream on a cookie?!  And to top it off...the manager came out and started to argue over the time frame!  If there's one way to lose customers, that'll do it! Won't find me at this place in a long, long LONG time!"
Jerry L.,"Lodi, CA",151,1,,5.0,9/17/2015,"After a number of horrible visits here,  I was forced to go to bjs today because of not being the driver with friends.   Today,  however,  was exceptional.  Joey was efficient, funny,  and overall accommodating.   Dude was running around but still got it done.  I'll  only come in again if he's  working."
Bruce B.,"Walnut Grove, CA",43,775,1001,4.0,1/12/2012,Great menu here with just about Anything one could want. Great home brews and a great big tv for the games. Quick and attentive service with all the amenities makes this a great place for the big day February 5th.
Nathan H.,"Stockton, CA",3,43,81,3.0,7/24/2015,My wife loves this place.  I think they have good food but not really stand out.  They are like a little bite less than a Cheesecake Factory.  I hear they have good beer.  My wife loves their deep dish pizza!
Karla Marie D.,"East Bay, CA",442,226,1067,4.0,6/25/2012,"I went here during Father's Day with my family. The wait wasn't long since we just sat in the bar area. But knowing it was Father's Day, it was definitely a wait for others. They have great and delicious deep dish pizzas here! Great White and Sweet Pizza is scrumptious and mouthwatering! I also love pasta!! I've had their Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, also delicious.  When I went, my family and I ordered: Great White Pizza, Mini- Bruschetta, Margherita Pizza All were very satisfying. The service was great, but the only downside is their alcohol beverages. I ordered a Strawberry Mojito. It tasted great! But I hardly tasted the alcohol. Overall experience was awesome!"
Anatasia B.,"Stockton, CA",1,33,12,3.0,8/9/2015,"When I come here, I never know what to order. I tried their jalapeno burger and a white chocolate chip macadamia pizzookie. The burger was alright, but overpriced for the quality. The pizzookie is too sweet for my tastes, but I think if you're someone who can eat a lot of candy without issue, it would be delicious.  There is usually a line, so I suggest you go before dinner service hours if you don't want to wait long."
Lilly S.,"Stockton, CA",0,83,,5.0,5/31/2015,"3/25/15: manager came to our table to introduce self and to assure everything was to our liking, which it was. Waitress was very attentive and professional. Couldn't be happier with my dinner choice. A+!! Keep it up :)"
Leana L.,"San Francisco, CA",322,889,281,4.0,10/24/2012,"This BJ's location might just have redeemed all my frustrations with the BJ's we frequent in San Bruno when I'm out to lunch with coworkers! We were seated nearly right away, pausing only so they could clean and set up a table for us. Our waiter was attentive, charismatic, knowledgeable, and prompt! He kept our waters filled, switched out empty Coke glasses for full ones, gave us a run down of all their drink specials and seasonal dishes. He encouraged dessert, but in a non-pressuring sort of way. The food was also pretty good. I had the enLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango salad (dressing on the side). It was tasty with a good ratio of chicken to salad, which is often something lacking in low-calorie dishes. The dressing was also quite tasty. It seemed that everyone else loved their dishes also. My mom ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi, my sister ordered the Chicken Fettucini Alfredo, my dad ordered the Turkey Club, and my uncle ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza deep dish.  When my sister inquired about the garlic bread that was supposed to come with her dish according to the picture on the menu, the waitress who delivered it said it didn't come with it. However, moments later, our main waiter came by and delivered a couple slices of garlic bread saying, ""I always think the dish should look like the picture"". So nice! We were in a bit of a rush to head out towards the end of our meal, so we asked for the check and our waiter was quick to hand it over and also got a box for the other half of my uncle's pizza. Overall a great experience here! If I lived in Stockton, I'm sure this would be a great place to hang out with friends or watch the game at the bar."
Robert G.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",1,19,13,3.0,4/8/2015,"Went in on 04/07/15 at approximately 8:40 PM and was seated quickly. The young waitress was nice enough and took my order, even suggesting an up sale of appetizers. I ordered #166 Crispy Jalapeño Hamburger substituted with bison in stead of cow. I requested a medium rare with a Cesar salad and thin fries. I ordered a cider which was pretty good and refreshing. But $6.75 for a small thin glass. Are you kidding me? Wow! What a rip off.  Anyways, I digress, the salad shows up weak looking with lack of any real flavor or dressing. Pretty basic stuff here folks! When the bison burger arrives, it was not medium rare but instead served rare. What a sloppy ass burger, there is absolutely no love in making their food by BJ's. Bring in McDonalds or Burger King cooks because you must be using the dishwasher. Literally, must be using the dishwasher to cook the burger. Yuck! So, I ordered a new burger, all the same request as prior. Chipotle mayonnaise and Baja sauce. Paid the $23 dollar bill and even tipped the waitress 20%. Went home with the new burger and placed it on the table. I placed it on a table and took an hour nap. Waking up feeling like the time to eat is now. When I open the to go box the bison jalapeño burger is without any of the previously mentioned condiments. Just warm lettuce. Suck fest! I'm so disappointed in BJ's. What the heck has happened to your establishment? Hope it is just a bad day. I'll be visiting the restaurant to give their burger back later on 04-08-15."
Jenny L.,"Placentia, CA",350,226,226,4.0,10/4/2011,"Finally lost my pizookie virginity at Stockton's BJ on the first Friday of the school year! My review? Three words: RED. VELVET. PIZOOKIE.  Like sweet heaven havin a partay in ma mouthhh. I tried a bite of the white chocolate macadamia pizookie too...sadly PALED in comparison. I don't even think I'm going to try the original chocolate chip pizookie, I didn't enjoy the chocolate overload from the white chocolate one and I ate around all the white chocolate chips in the red velvet pizookie :D And come here to SHARE. The best deal is the 2 for $20 deal, hands down. 2 appetizers, a huuuge pizza (that'll feed 3, maybe 2.5 people), and of course, a pizookie!  We got the white pizza, I think it's called? (the one with alfredo sauce instead of pizza sauce) but I think I liked the BBQ Chicken a little more. But it definitely won't ever be as good as CPK's bbq chicken. I'll probably search yelp for a better pizza next time! And don't even think about the word ""diet"" when you come to BJ's. Just enjoy the moment, then spend the day at the gym tomorrow."
