Vanessa G.,"Oakland, CA",30,105,153,4.0,3/27/2016,"We were seated right away when we arrived as there was nobody in front of us. The hostess remembered to ask if we had a rewards card to make sure our points were added. Our waiter was really attentive and just straight to the point - not really talkative and monotone. We ordered the avocado rolls that were super delicious! We also ordered the California club flat bread pizza, boneless wings, a side of fries, and ribs. I didn't think anything special of our order. The boneless wings tasted like something you could just pop in the oven at home with sauce drizzled over it. The flat bread pizza was also mediocre. We told them it was my brother's birthday & they brought out a complimentary brownie ice cream cake with a candle. I think the waiter asked if we wanted them to sing to us but we politely refused and they were okay with it. Once the bill came, we showed them our deal coupon from Yelp & got $10 off $35 from our bill. Good deal overall. I think I would come back for a drink and to watch a game (they had tons of TV's and large selection of drinks)."
Krissy A.,"Oakland, CA",4,117,7,2.0,11/2/2013,"2.5  Came for a Sat. afternoon lunch, the restaurant wasn't that crowded yet in took a while to be seated. When seated we were ignored for at least five minutes and then our drink orders were taken. Order taken, food followed shortly. I could overhear other patrons complaining about the long wait. Typical big chain menu. Wasn't impressed and the workers look tired and overworked."
Vince S.,"Stockton, CA",35,13,11,1.0,3/7/2015,"Always come out to BJ's on either a Friday or Saturday night with family or my girlfriend, well on this particular night, let's just say it will be my last. I ordered the jambalaya which is served with shrimp, sausage, and chicken. As I was half way done with my plate I noticed that one of my pieces of chicken tastes funny, so I spit it out. I took another piece of chicken and put it on my appetizer plate cut it open and noticed it was ""RAW"" very disappointed, disgusting, and any other word you can think of. I immediately got up and walked over to the hostess and asked for a manager, 5 mins later a manger came over I told him what happened and that I would not pay for that. He apologized and took it off the bill. Furthermore I let the waiter know it wasn't her fault and still left a tip, I felt it was only right because it was not her fault and she was very nice. I could have blew up and stormed out knowing that in the morning I'll possibly be sick from SALMONELLA, but instead I kept my cool and walked out knowing I'll never come back again."
Audrey L.,"Bukit Timah, Singapore, Singapore",436,798,1122,3.0,6/18/2012,One of the few places in Stockton you can count on to be: 1) Open late on weekdays and weekends 2) Have a decent crowd 3) Have decent (albeit large portioned) food
Mayra A.,"Stockton, CA",88,8,,3.0,1/27/2015,"Went to Bjs for brunch on Sunday, was greeted by our server and immediately asked if we were ready to order, we weren't quite ready so she got our drinks, but the time she came back we were ready to order. There's one thing that never impressed me, when servers think they can memorize someone's order!!!!! Don't try to memorize it, because I will send it back if it's wrong! She repeated my order back, WRONG, she forgot my salad, and after I was done with my burger asked if I still wanted my salad, UM No!! Write down the order and you won't forget! Duh!"
Nestor T.,"Stockton, CA",4,2,,1.0,5/30/2015,"Went to BJs Restaurant (Stockton) at Pacific Avenue on 5/30/15 at approximately 3:40pm.  The hostess sat us on a booth.  This was a terrible experience as we waited and waited for a server. No waitress or waiter ever stopped by our booth to even acknowledge our presence let alone take our order.  We did see several servers walk by our table without even saying anything to us.  Never in our lives have we experience this type of service at a restaurant!  This is the second time thats happened at this restaurant. At approximately 4pm, we decided to just leave. We did let the hostess know that there wasn't a server that came to take our order. We decided to go to Outback instead and we were provided service pretty quickly..."
Tati R.,"Los Angeles, CA",398,333,,1.0,5/25/2013,"The place was almost empty when we entered.  It started filling up as we ordered.  25 minutes later when we asked the waitress to check on our food the place was packed.   By the way, we never got our food.  After 40 minutes of waiting, and several promises that our food would be right out we got the kid a burger from a drive thru. I don't know how long it takes to get a meal at this location, but make sure you have your afternoon free to find out.  The waitress should have been checking on our food instead of us having to ask her to.  A manger should have come by before anyone has to cancel a meal.  Overall, poor customer service."
Kay L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/13/2016,Hands down this place lacks a lot of things.especially customer service. One in particular. She a latino girl.she seem bothered annoyed for some reason.she would dispear. This place is not a solid place to eat. Really ghetto!
Todd S.,"Stockton, CA",0,13,,3.0,8/12/2015,"The food here is typically good.  The service here though, for me anyway, has been pretty hit and miss.  I have had slow service, a waiter who got the order actually wrong, and one who never once checked or offered to refill our drinks or water glasses.  Now I admit, because of some of these issues and the fact that Stockton has other good places to eat, I have not been back there for a while so it may have improved by now, I don't know."
Julie T.,"Ione, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/25/2016,"If I could leave negative stars I would. The only good thing was the girl waiting on us was very nice and it's a shame she had to deal with all the bull crap that the so called ""chefs"" put her threw cause of how poor they made everything. So we went out to eat it was five people. Person number one ordered a pizza with sausage and bacon. They brought a pepperoni pizza. Person number two ordered the ribeye with baked potato a $22 meal. And there was no meat on the steak it was a flimsy piece of fat burnt to shit. It looked like the left overs you'd give to a dog. I ordered the bbq chicken chopped salad. And waited 20 min after everyone got there food and when I got my salad it was like soup. And the chicken was hard and looked like charcoal. My one year old got spaghetti and it was nothing but noodles with a table spoon of sauce she loves spaghetti and she spit it out. My boyfriend got a really nice ribeye just kinda burnt. But the baked potato was pink and black on the inside. And he ordered grilled asparagus and it was chopped up into little half inch pieces. Nothing like the picture showed. After all that they went to remake the pizza and they brought out another pizza with pepperoni and sausage and tomatoes on it. Lol I don't know how hard it is to just put bacon and sausage on a pizza and cook it. The cooks are horrible at that place and the managers there are a joke. They were rude and all we did was nicely tell them what was wrong they rolled there eyes and walked off and didn't fix anything. For now on if I want Bj's I will be traveling to Folsom every time. Looks like they hired a chef off the streets and asked them to cook for a night. Cause they sucked."
Matt T.,"Berkeley, CA",3,11,3,4.0,5/6/2015,"Alyssa was totally professional, and cool under preasure. Even with the Cinco de Mayo rush and some pretty rude customers. Everything tasted great! My girlfriend and I had an awesome night. Thanks again, BJ's."
Dana C.,"Lodi, CA",708,491,855,3.0,10/21/2011,"We always sit in the bar area and we've had the same server the last few times we've been there.  She's great and her service is great. The lunch menu is good but not great.   I say 'good' because there aren't enough sandwich choices that don't come slathered in butter or oil.  When I order a 1/2 sandwich and soup I don't want to leave feeling like I just slathered my fingers and insides with butter/oil.  Most every sandwich comes that way unless I request otherwise. My other complaint... I wish there could be a lunch size of the Asian Chicken Salad.  I feel like they force you to purchase the full size just so that they can charge you more. Not my favorite lunch place, but sometimes it'll do."
Chyanne L.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/1/2016,"There food was terrible , not much  good out of this food experience, there vegetables where the worst ,wilted all around gross and they know that there food isnt as good as advertised."
Tony A.,"Sacramento, CA",1195,606,2198,3.0,5/26/2010,"My Mom LOVES this place.  She's been trying to get me here for about four months now.  Since I had to work on Mother's Day, I asked Moms if she could wait a few days.  I told her I would take her here for a belated Mother's Day dinner and she agreed to going on May 13th. Being a Stockton Ports season ticket holder, I was able to try pizza from BJ's early in the year when I was invited to attend a Ports event.  I thought the pizza was great, so I thought eating at the restaurant would be even better. We arrived and I thought, WTF?  Who brain-stormed and thought it would be a good idea to put this place in the center of every shopping center in Stockton.  Absolutely NO parking anywhere close to BJ's.  I ended up in the back 40 lot.   Stepping inside BJ's made me feel a bit better.  The place is laid out great.  Nice and easy southwestern paint schemes.  Very easy on the eyes.  Hardwood floors, Italian tiles and marble on the floor too.  Very plush. The menu was very well rounded and diverse.  Pizza's, Pasta, Steaks, Chicken, Vegan and Vegetarian meals to choose from. I had the calamari and shrimp lettuce wraps as appetizers and selected Cajun Pasta with Shrimp as my entrée and my Mom had their New Orleans Jambalaya ( ).   My Cajun Pasta was okay.  It was plentiful, but just okay.  The seasonings were good and hot, but I really couldn't taste the true flavors because of the overwhelming hotness of the spices if that makes any sense to you.  Now I did try my Moms Jambalaya and I told her I would have better off ordering it instead of the Cajun Pasta. Overall the food was decent, but like any other chain, very predictable and not home-made or personal. I would rate BJ's on the same level I would a Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden or Apple bee's - a solid 3 stars."
Kayla S.,"Stockton, CA",42,95,124,1.0,6/28/2013,"So sad. This Bj's used to have pretty good service but as of lately, it's just plain ridiculous. First, you're lucky if you are greeted when you walk in. Some of the hostesses just stare at you as if you should be the first to say something. Uhm, yes! Party of 3 please as you stare into my soul without uttering a word.  After being seated, can you tell us about the new items on your menu or maybe the new beer you are displaying? Oh, no? Ok I didn't realize that me not knowing what I want the second I sat down meant please don't come back for another 15 mins. How ridiculous! Then you take my order and it doesn't come out for another 45 mins? Hello! It wasn't even packed. It's quite sad, really. The service wasn't always this bad. But there are many people there that don't know what they're doing or just don't have the customer service skills. It really shouldn't take that long for 3 simple lunch meals.  Get it together Stockton Bj's!"
Charmaine P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2,6,,5.0,9/23/2014,"5 stars for that goooddddd yummy delicious Steak!!! my daughter,my bestfriends husband, & my bestfriend ate dinner here.. and it was my first time having steak at bjs.. and it was sooo good.. heavenly good.. I got it medium and it was tender and juicy.. I never had a good steak from othe restaurants but here... we never waited to be seated.. and the waitress was kept on checking on us... the price was not overpriced.. I just love it!"
Lisa L.,"Tracy, CA",2,51,,1.0,11/7/2013,"Went here a few weeks ago on a Sunday mid-afternoon with the family. The service was horrible, had to ask the waiter for EVERYTHING; plates for our appetizer, more drinks, silverware, ice for our iced tea.  Considering it was so empty, I'm not sure what the problem was.  It was actually my daughter's birthday, but we didn't say anything because we'd been there so long that it wasn't worth the free dessert. The topper, our waiter wanted to be our best friend when leaving the check and asked us to take a survey....REALLY?  Oh, and there were some additional items on our check that we hadn't ordered...Won't be going to this BJ's again."
Manny V.,"Stockton, CA",28,4,2,4.0,12/11/2014,Was looking for quick grab to eat ... came here and had the greatest experience here food is amazing the drinks are good and fast ....
Stephanie S.,"Stockton, CA",533,242,1353,4.0,2/28/2011,"Another super larger group dinner at BJ's we give it to em because they're one of the few places for late night huge group dinners like ours. This time 25-30 I'm sure there were 30+ since those who didn't eat were back and forth from the table and the bar. Service was better for us than other nights we've had. So that's a +  Only thing that probably sucks would be...with large groups we can only have one check instead of separate checks. Our conclusion after planning this dinner out is, BJ's is the main place in town that can accomidate really large groups, decent prices for food, & one of the best places for dinner & drinks late at night vs going to have dinner and driving out to a bar.  I'm sure that BJ's loves us for the amount of $ we dropped on both food and alcohol to celebrate a good friends birthday.  LARGE GROUP TIPS: -gratuity is already added to the bill. Make sure everyone throws that in or you'll end up being super short to pay the bill. -If many people of the party are getting drinks, shots, and/or pitchers order them at the bar to make a separate tab, it makes it mains the dinner check let's hectic and easy to see what people are paying for -If it's a really busy night, even if you have reservations, they won't seat you unless half of the party is already there"
Danielle J.,"Stockton, CA",24,111,28,3.0,2/7/2014,"2/7/14-We came to BJ's to celebrate my nephews 21st b-day.  The appetizers were awesome, especially the avocado rolls.  We all ordered different burgers.  However, my nieces burger was burned and they could not bring it with the rest of our food.  By the time the burger came we were through eating.  They gave us the bill, and to our surprise they didn't try to give her a percentage of the burnt burger off,  or offer her a dessert, we had to call them on it.  Service was mediocre and the place was busy for a Thursday night. The thick fries that they offer with the burgers were terrible--no taste.  They even bought an empty bottle of ketchup to our table.  What were we suppose to do with that?"
