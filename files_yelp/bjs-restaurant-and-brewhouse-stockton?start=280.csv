Tiffany A.,"Anthem, Las Vegas, NV",27,2,,5.0,4/23/2015,Loved the Parmesan cheese chicken and the corn balls.  Joseph was our waiter and really outdid himself.  The new wheat beer is amazing.
Jeffrey S.,"San Leandro, CA",329,444,250,3.0,5/22/2011,"If you like watching sports and drinking beer, BJ's is a place for you.  If you like American food at a good value, BJ's is also a place for you.  But if you like freshly baked cookies with ice cream on top, then BJ's is REALLY the place for you. I went to the Stockton BJ's with my wife and in-laws last week for lunch.  It was busy, but not full, so we were seated right away.  Since BJ's is a big-box restaurant (like Cheesecake Factory or Applebees), this location looked identical to any other BJ's I've dined in before.  We ordered the Best Beginnings appetizer sampler, and I chose the Blonde Shrimp entrée .   The appetizers plate came with 2 types of egg rolls, the spinach and artichoke dip, and some mozzarella sticks.  They were good, but not exceptional.  My entrée consisted of breaded & deep-fried shrimp served with French fries and coleslaw.  The slaw and fries were OK, but the shrimp were good, especially with their tarter and cocktail sauces.   The rest of my party enjoyed their food, though my wife and mother-in-law needed to go boxes for their dishes.  Since I knew we weren't staying for dessert, I ate all my food. But if you come to BJ's, I recommend having one of their famous Pizookies for dessert.  It's a freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream.  They come in several flavors, or you can get the Sampler of 3 different flavors.  You can get one to share with a friend, or be a big like me and eat one by yourself!"
Holla F.,"Oakland, CA",45,366,1170,2.0,8/25/2013,"First time here. Nothing spectacular. One step down from Elephant Bar and one step up from Applebee's. service is ok. I would not normally drive from Oakland to Stockton, but it was for a friend's birthday and limited choices there."
Dixie x.,"Fresno, CA",5,32,11,2.0,9/17/2014,"my husband and I came to this location tonight for dinner. we were seated right away. no wait time is awesome.  our waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order as we were not ready for our main course yet. it was a very long wait just to get the spinach and artichoke dip, and it was disgusting. the dip was way too fluffy, I like mines thick and cheesey. this one looks like it was just whipped. the chips were also so thick. there were even a whole stack of them fried together in one piece. I did not enjoy it at all and asked for a salsa dip.  After that, our order was finally taken and the wait time for that was probably another 30 mins. We've ordered the shrimp scampi pasta, the pork chops plate, and stuffed mushrooms. along with one of their berry maple brew and the white peach margarita.  the margarita was so strong, I didnt even finish it. not that its a bad thing, lol. my husband's brew was good in his opinion. the stuffed mushrooms were amazing. taste and flavors were perfection! my husband had the pork chops and was so disappointed. it came with a side of green beans and mashed potatoes. everything was great expect for the pork chops. it was so damn dry, it tasted like paper. we were so disappointed.  the shrimp scampi was amazeball!!! Perfect portion, sauce, etc. but there was one thing, there was something that looked like the skin of an avocado in the pasta. because of that, I no longer ate. and with the long wait on everything and as irritated as we were, we dropped it and left. we wont be coming back."
Jenifer L.,"South Bay, CA",29,117,113,2.0,9/28/2014,"I am a big fan of the chicken alfredo pasta at BJ's, but the BJ's I am referring to is the one located in San Diego. I was expecting the same great taste of the chicken alfredo pasta as SD but I was wrong. I was given very very little chicken that was over cooked. The Alfredo sauce was also too liquidy. It was not creamy like it should have been. The only plus about this pasta dish was the pasta. It was cooked perfectly, chewy and delicious. If only the alfredo sauce and chicken was better. I will not be coming back even though I love chicken Alfredo linguini."
Jen B.,"Lodi, CA",0,39,,1.0,3/27/2013,"Alright.. I give up. I've been faithful to this place since it opened and continue to take people there and frequent the place despite hit and miss food and service that ranges from being rushed, being ignored and having a great time.  Tonight, my food was not good. The server who I really like, up sold my boyfriend on the pizza, salads and pizookie deal, although it wasn't that great of a deal for us and I had already ordered my own food. Our drinks took forever, salad came about 5 minutes before the food did. Salad contained brown pieces of lettuce but was good otherwise, pizza and pasta were skimpy on sauces and toppings and about 30% of my pasta had no sauce, with large, still uncooked broccoli mixed in.  Bad food nights happen, I understand.. however when we were done eating, it was another 40 minutes before our pizookie arrived. A male manager showed up with it and said ""here it is, sorry."" and left. Our server indicated that the pizookie was supposed to be comp'd due to the awful wait times, but then didn't do anything to have the price of the meal adjusted. We had to ask for our check three times, it took another 20 minutes for the check to arrive, and another 15 or so for someone else to take my money.  In this time, I asked the hostess to speak with a manager. I kindly explained how we had been there for nearly 2 hours and how bad our experience was, and all she did was stare at me blankly, ask where we were seated, and brought me free pizookie coupons. You know, for the amount of money I spend here, and the nearly 2 hour time we'd been there that should've only been 40-45mins, I would've liked to have been offered a reduction in my bill (no alcohol) if not even a free meal.  I couldn't take my leftovers home, as they'd been sitting on the table for over an hour and I didn't want to chance getting sick from food being out too long at the wrong temperature. Again, no offer from BJs staff to fix the situation. Thanks for the pizookie coupons.. I'm sure someone at work will love them. I won't be back to this location again as this is my last straw with this place. Too many times has my service been bad, my food cold or undercooked, or my $8 cocktails taste like they forgot the alcohol. I'm tired of paying $45 to have my time wasted and being disappointed when I was expecting a decent meal out.  It's a shame.. I used to love this place. You've been warned."
Darian S.,"Stockton, CA",30,7,3,1.0,6/13/2015,Went there Friday June 12..bartender was the worst ever..ordered dark side over the moon beer and it looked nothing like the picture..Manager said they didn't have the right spoon to make it bi-level.ordered a drink like that  in the pic was blue ours came to our table brown.then I order an Dust bowl and watch the bartender pour a blue moon and try to say she   bout using you tube lady..Manager said corporate can't figure out how to make it
Joshua S.,"Lodi, CA",0,18,,2.0,3/27/2016,the waiters are decent. the food is meh. i like the ribs. I have had better
Terri S.,"San Diego, CA",0,29,33,3.0,3/5/2016,"The restaurant chain is one of our favorites, especially in a college town/atmosphere. At University of the Pacific, this is a treat to take our son out when visiting. Floor was filthy. Bathrooms had paper thrown everywhere. Our waiter did not know the menu or ingredients. It was 5 pm, not a rush time and service was minimal. Our food was terrific, so yah to the cooks! I hope corporate does some follow up training soon for waiters, hosts and general managers."
Negrolo S.,"Mid-City, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/30/2015,Worst takeout experience ever. Took nearly 1 while hour. Dinning in is also a horrific experience. They seem to have a talent for making the customer wait. I will never go back
William S.,"West Chester, PA",0,3,,2.0,2/23/2016,The food was well below average...it took way to long to come out...we came in about 1245 for lunch and Resturant was half empty ...needed to ask twice for the dressing that was not in my salad ... Finished it before it came...the half of flare bread had all the toppings on two piece not across the whole thing...had to ask a different waitress a second time to refill our drinks...and took over 10 minutes after I handed the waitress my CC to come back with the bill...service was slow and poor
Sergio R.,"Stockton, CA",0,9,8,2.0,4/4/2014,"I've been coming here since the day they opened and let me tell you, it has changed. The food is really good, mind the price, but what grinds my gears is that the staff take really long to bring the drinks out or even take down an order. The male waiters are the BEST, the females... not so much. I prefer having a male waiter than a female one here because they know how to serve, they're quick, and very friendly. All in all, I keep coming back for their wedge cut fries and their clam chowder."
M H.,"Stockton, CA",71,5,,1.0,10/15/2015,"My wife and I showed up at 7:20 and were told there would be a 15 minute wait for a table. Understandable as it was busy and it was dinner time for most people. We were seated by 7:30, however we waited 15 minutes for someone (who I would assume was a manager) to even take at least a drink /appetizer order. Another 15 minutes go by with no drinks. I then observed other tables who were seated after us, in the same section receive their drinks / appetizers before us. We waited another 5 minutes and then decided to leave due to poor service. I took our menus and silverware back up to the front desk and walked out of the door. I am a manager in customer service and have years of experience dealing with people which is why I didn't cause a scene, it's just tacky to do so. I could have probably asked to speak with a manager but I was pretty upset. It's understandable that these things just happen, but I won't be returning to my local BJs.  I've had better service at chow halls in Afghanistan."
Laura C.,"Honolulu, HI",7,18,13,4.0,4/1/2015,Came here with my core team member Katie!! Service good food good but I think prices are a bit high... I think my pizza could have had more sausage I only had 7 pieces! Katie's Pitas were awesome ! Erica are server was great !
Daniel B.,"Stockton, CA",1,8,1,4.0,4/1/2015,"So, I've been here many many times. I've been here and had good and bad service but the food is always good and the place has always been clean. No complaints that have kept me away. A solid place to eat on Pacific in Stockton. The place isn't quiet, but not overly loud unless it's packed. Get the BJ's rewards card if you plan on eating here often because the food you eat will earn you points pretty quickly towards free desserts and discounts off your bill."
Katrina A.,"Stockton, CA",8,10,1,4.0,10/8/2015,"I love BJ's. There food is good, and the service is great. Sometimes the wait is a little long, but that's normal."
Katie B.,"Stockton, CA",65,54,52,4.0,7/27/2014,"I love going to BJ's at night, in a ""let's not go to a real bar let's go to BJs instead because it's way better than Applebee's or Chili's"" type of mood. My friend and I used to go just about every other night during football season (seriously) because of the happy hour specials, and we made friends with a lot of the workers in the bar. Elaine is hands down my favorite bartender ever, and Kayla, Scott (who I don't think works there anymore), and Stephanie are my favorite servers of all time. Shoutout to Sunshine, too, who I've only had serve us a few times but she's always nice! The service in the bar gets a 10 out of 10 whenever those lovely people are working! I'd give service in the bar without them a 7.5, and service in the actual dining room a 6.5. It's not that the others aren't nice and accommodating whenever they see you, it's just that the orders usually take awhile and the drinks sometimes go unfilled.  I feel like the food is always hit or miss, with the exception of the Pizookie which is always fabulous. The beer and drinks are great, and usually I like to get pizza or fries to accompany them. My pizzas are either perfect or overcooked, which is frustrating. I love their pizza when it's perfect, and it's usually when I'm craving it the most that it's not. It's not even that it's a matter of too much sauce or picky stuff like that, it's just simply overcooked or undercooked. And I'm not one of those people who sends their food back when it's overcooked, because I worked at a pizza parlor and know how that can mess up the line, but it never hurts to just mention it. The crispy fries are my second favorite, with ranch of course, but even those sometimes come out a little lukewarm. Haven't had a bad experience with the spinach and artichoke dip yet, love the chips and that they'll bring you more if you ask.  Overall, I recommend sitting in the bar because the service is quicker and more attentive over there. The food isn't bad, the beer is refreshing, and the ambiance is nice. I'd choose here over Applebee's, Elephant Bar or Chili's any day."
Kelsea M.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/24/2015,"Waited for 15 minutes for someone to come to our table, finally sat at the bar just to get water and for someone to realize we were sitting there. Mentioned we were waiting a while and got dismissed by the bar tender. Their '5 principles of professional service' are not being executed by the staff we encountered tonight. Will not be going there again."
Ronin D.,"Lodi, CA",34,23,12,2.0,2/21/2015,Loud. Mediocre food and beer. Nothing special.
Victoria R.,"Mountain View, CA",270,296,661,4.0,4/14/2013,"Great food, service, location and prices."
