Monica T.,"Seattle, WA",161,189,36,4.0,12/20/2014,"Love this place.  A great selection of food.  Wait staff is really friendly.  They have a awesome bar with lots of TV's so if you want to watch a game, this is the place to be."
Be A.,"Portland, OR",101,253,654,3.0,12/26/2010,"I'm not going to lie... I use to come here a lot because they had good looking waitresses here. Sorry, I sound like a douche, but it's true. Also, on Sunday, Monday, and Thursday nights you can leave the wife/girlfriend and kids at home and watch football on the big screen at the bar area with the friends! Hmmm, now I sound like an *sshole. Sorry. Damn, have you tried those avocado eggrolls? They are pretty good! Things that are that damn good: California Burger California Chicken Sandwich Deep Dish Pizzas Best Beginnings Appetizers Combo Flatbread Pizzas Alcohol"
James B.,"Stockton, CA",8,26,9,1.0,2/8/2015,"Once again went to BJs not by choice of course. Our waitress was friendly enough but that's where it all stopped. I don't understand when everyone orders at the same time why does it take 50 mins between everyone getting their meals? The easy stuff for the kids was LAST 50mins after everyone else. Instead of refilling sodas over and over BRING THE FUCKING FOOD! The so called manager came to the table with cold Mac and cheese  to kiss the BooBoo and make it better. Then just glared at us when asked what the problem was? Most of didn't eat because it's rude to eat while others don't have food. Trying to feed hungry kids off our meals crap that we didn't want to eat 'now cold"". We All agreed to never go there again. As we were getting up to leave they brought the kids food! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME."
Dre P.,"Lakeview, CA",1,8,20,3.0,3/8/2014,"Great beer! Not the best service..but what can you except from a chain restaurant. Some of the servers looked over worked! Still a great place to kick back, eat pizza, grab a beer and watch a game!!"
Keith T.,"Stockton, CA",92,2,,3.0,2/3/2014,"I've been here quite a few times hoping each time that the service will have improved but Im consistently disappointed. The food is good, if they get it out to you in time. 3 of the first 4 times here, someone in my group has received a free meal because they managed to mess it up somehow. If your planning on eating here make sure you have plenty of time as it seems it's typical for food to take anywhere from 20-30 min, and the servers, while I understand they are busy, don't give that great of service. In fact there is only one time I can recall where I received acceptable service and I wish I could remember her name.  My rating is based off of the food cause I would rate the service a 1."
Eric C.,"Stockton, CA",0,82,6,3.0,3/3/2015,"Went to BJ's for the first time in a while. For a chain place they have some decent food and a good place to go when a group of people don't know what they really want as they have a wide variety of food. They always have games or sports on the TVs. I do love the Nutty Brewnette brown ale and they have a full bar too. Had a California burger tonight which was quite tasty. Other family favorites there are the Parmesan crusted chicken, meatloaf, and fish & chips. Had the pizza once and didn't think it was that great. The service can be hit or miss."
Trang H.,"Milpitas, CA",104,19,,1.0,10/5/2015,"Slow service. Appetizers took forever to come out. I'm sure the server forgot to punch it in because it shouldn't take 30 minutes to bring out chips and cheese and a couple other simple appetizers, on a slow night. Our lemonade was never refilled and we eventually got tired of waiting almost an hour for our shrimp scampi so we were trying to find our server to cancel it but she was no where in sight for a good 10 minutes so we had to ask the host to look for her. That took another 5 minutes. We were never asked how we were doing and the server did not apologize for any thing. I work in the food and hospitality industry so I'm usually lenient but tonight was just bad. I don't even want to talk about the food because it is straight up microwable food. I definitely don't recommend if you like quality food."
Marneilli B.,"Stockton, CA",1,2,,1.0,4/1/2015,"2nd time at a BJ's restaurant this week and both times food took super long - should have ordered an appetizer as it seemed like all the parties arriving after us received their order of appetizers first. Although both waitresses were friendly, my order of Mahi Mahi Tacos were cold. The first waitress ordered my husbands pizza wrong, however they did give us the incorrect pizza order while we wait for the correct one. By that time, we were both over it and just wanted to go home. Needless to say we left not tip."
Cris G.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/12/2015,"Decided to go to dinner at BJ's off Pacific Ave on a Sunday night with 3 other guests. The restaurant was about 50% filled with patrons. We were seated as soon as we walked in.  The server took our order, and we received our appetizer fairly quickly (15 min?). Then we waited for our entrée, then waited, then waited. Finally 3 of the 4 of us received our meal. The server told us that the cook forgot to make our fourth friends' meal, which were fish tacos. When she received her fish tacos, it looked more like a lettuce salad and 2 slices of hardened finger-shaped fish. Our other friend ordered the Salmon with asparagus and quinoa which looked nothing like the photo (there were probably 2 tablespoons of quinoa on the whole plate).  We asked for the manager, and the manager  said that the food is prepared in the same proportion all the time - which is not true because we've been there times before for the same meals and we had no issues with proportions before. The manager asked if we wanted another meal in replacement for the fish tacos - but we would still be charged for the fish tacos. My friend, who lost her appetite by this time, declined. The server returned and told us she was taking the tacos off the bill, but when we received our bill it was still on there, so we called for the manager again. The manager said she did not approve the tacos being taken off the bill, but we told her the server told us she would. She reluctantly said ok, rolled her eyes, and took the bill from the table to remove the taco meal.  Oh, and by the way...we were there for a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes - from the time they opened the bill to the time we stepped out. So unfortunate - the other BJ's Restaurants had wonderful service and great food, but they are not closeby."
Micheal S.,"Stockton, CA",21,24,9,1.0,11/24/2014,"Vomit. Constant menu changes, servers that want to get you to buy beer more than they want to keep my coffee full or my order correct. Gave them 3 chances and I quit. Never again. Just another chain with crappy food and service."
Danny D.,"Stockton, CA",2,25,13,2.0,1/5/2016,"I am writing this review to express my disappointment on the recent change in their corporate decision on the lighting in the restaurant. If you visit this restaurant during the day or when there is daylight outside you won't know any difference. I went there last night with my girlfriend and her coworkers for dinner at 6:30pm. We sat in the middle of the main dining area. At around a quarter to seven that evening the lights started to dim. It wasn't even a subtle change, the lights went from 80% to 25%. A couple people from our party had to use the flashlight app on their smart phones to see the menu. There were other people at other tables doing the same thing. ITS TOO DARK IN THERE! I want to see my average food. Its is also a safety hazard for the people working there. God forbid if a drink were to spill on the floor. You wouldn't be able to see it. Complaints were made to the manager who insisted there wasn't anything he could do at the time and that it is a decision made by corporate. Well, once accidents start to increase because people can't see and fall because of the lighting situation then a change will be made."
Garrett B.,"Modesto, CA",221,15,,1.0,1/3/2016,"I went in here tonight to get some dinner being it was one of the only decent places open at the time. Walked in and placed my order for take out with a friendly kid. I ordered the parmesan chicken and wedge fries. Then I sat down and waited for what must've been over half an hour. Don't know why it took so long, the place was a ghost town. Finally got my food and headed home. Open up the bag to find out after all that time they even forgot my fries, lol... Not a huge deal but it's the principle... The place is dead and I still get jipped outta my fries which I paid for... So I called back and talked to Andrew, he told me he was the manager working. Told him what happened and he was very apologetic and offered to make it up to me the next time I came in. I've been in there countless times over the years, my friends and I. Spent lots of money. Have to say I'll think twice about makin a trip back..."
Suze W.,"Lodi, CA",0,23,2,1.0,8/7/2015,No Bueno BJ's....called ahead @ 6:45 arrived @ 7 and was told it was a 10-15 min wait......try 35min!  Not cool!!!  Be honest and call it to the best of your ability BJ's!!
Humanios ..,"San Jose, CA",8,3,8,1.0,9/14/2014,"So I've been to BJ's in various other cities prior to coming to this BJ's in Stockton. It's amazing how waiters/waitresses, hostess, and presumably management can change the experience. I came here with my girlfriend on a September weekend and was amazingly disappointed and frustrated with the experience. Things started pretty well, we were greeted and shown to our table with much respect, we even had a waitress who was nice enough. We received water and our food orders were taken. I ordered and Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, and she ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. The chicken pita tacos comes with a side of grains which she asked to substitute with a salad. Wasn't a problem and shortly after she received her salad. This is when things took a turn in the opposite direction. No one likes to wait for their food but that experience is made worse when suddenly your server is no where to be found. Our server (Erika) never came by for another 30-40 minutes to give us any indication of whether our food would ever be coming out. At this point we assumed she forgot to place the order in. Just as we were about to get another server's attention, a different waitress (didn't get her name) came back with our food and apologized that it took long, and that my girlfriend's plate didn't have all the ingredients they were supposed to have. I assume she had other tables to wait on so she left after apologizing (on Erika's behalf I guess) that the greek yogurt was missing. A few minutes later Erika returned and apologized the food took so long. It turned out they were out Greek yogurt (topping for the pita), and rather than communicate this with us from the start had made a decision to replace it with sour cream, only after presumably waiting for the food to get cold. She also added the side of grains despite specifically asking to omit them, waste of food. Both our dishes were cold (and not very good) and she quickly exited the scene after a quick ""sorry"". We were both pretty astounded to say the least. I don't think we would've minded if they were out of yogurt if we knew at an earlier stage, but you can't just take a healthy meal, with feta cheese and light ingredients, then just pour sour cream on top instead. Those kind of decisions should be up to the customer and always communicated.  Anyways, we never received that yogurt, and neither of us finished our meals. We didn't take anything to go but were still asked for desert. No, I couldn't risk waiting another 30 minutes for our ice cream pizooki only to find that they ran out of ice cream and rather than let us know decided to let the warm cookie get cold and just put sour cream on top instead.  I hope these servers (who I'm certain are nice people) learn to communicate better with their customers. Would've made the world of difference (although the food was still crap). Save yourselves some headaches and find a better restaurant elsewhere."
La Nora W.,"Stockton, CA",1,19,7,2.0,1/1/2016,"Not a good experience... We waited over .45 minutes for our food... We asked our waiter to check on it and he came back and said ""they messed up on your order their fixing it, it will be a few more minutes..."" Not acceptable!!! We left hungry..."
Alicia H.,"Lodi, CA",0,27,,2.0,9/9/2015,We've eaten here several times and tried several things and it's just not very good. The only thing we like is the atmosphere and the pizookies. Have tried several things in the menu and nothing you would go back for.
Melissa M.,"Stockton, CA",47,91,73,1.0,9/26/2014,"There's a lot to be said about serving alcohol to a person who didn't order an alcoholic beverage! Also a lot to be said about forgetting multiple requests if you are a server. Very poor attempt at customer service. Due to this visit, we will not be going back to BJ's in the future; went here to have a rare dinner but was sorely disappointed overall."
Dale R.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,2,2.0,1/7/2015,"This BJ's has gone downhill. It has been over a year since our last visit. In the past we enjoyed the food and service. Tonight was different. The service was very slow, it looks like they no longer have food runners, the servers do it all. We had burgers tonight. The meat tasted like something you would get precooked off of a catering truck.  In the past they were very good. A server from another table dropped a bowl of ranch dressing and sprayed my wife her purse and coat. With the crash sound and the commotion of the cleanup you think the manager would have stopped by to see what was going on, but no he didn't. After this adventure it would have been nice had they offered my wife dessert, but no they offered her a wet rag."
Trouble L.,"Stockton, CA",22,27,16,1.0,6/24/2014,Came for happy hour. At first at server was good . Asking if we need anything . Then later he just stop coming . Anyways my pizza had hair in it and he still made us paid for it wtf. I read on yelp people get there meal free when they have a problem. guess I had a-ho manager . We waited 20 min before he came to talk to us and he never said sorry. F u for your shitty hair pizza.  will never come here again.
Justin Y.,"San Francisco, CA",552,440,486,4.0,1/17/2011,"I really like this place.  It is probably the restaurant that i go to the most in Stockton.  Unlimited refills, I have glasses of strawberry lemonade lined up for me.  Their pizzas are delicious and very filling.  The pizookis are crazy good.  If you haven't had a pizooki before you need to.   I usually go here for happy hour with the guys.  Half off mini pizza's and dollar off beers.  This place is known for their beers.  Have some of the best that I have ever had.  The Jereamiah Red is my favorite and also the Blonde.  During different seasons they will have beer specials.  During Halloween they had an Octoberfest beer and a Pumpkin Ale.  When sports games are on, its' crackin.  I remember we went there during the MLB playoffs for Giant's games and everyone was going crazy.   It is a fun environment for everyone.  If it's your birthday go get your free pizooki.  Sometimes thats the only reason we go there."
