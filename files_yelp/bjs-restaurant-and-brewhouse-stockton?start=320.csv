CDicob D.,"Stockton, CA",0,16,,4.0,7/4/2014,"My husband and I enjoy going to BJ. They have the best avocado rolls. Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff, and a great location!"
Christian J.,"Stockton, CA",17,28,15,3.0,6/2/2014,"i come here a lot and i really like the food. my only problem are the waiters. they rarely come to check up on you and sometimes seem tired or disinterested. other than that, i cant really complain. it can get busy at times during the weekends at night so be prepared to wait. they also removed two of my favorite items off the menu so im not too happy about that."
David E.,"Stockton, CA",29,20,2,1.0,7/9/2014,"Poor service, menu change for the worse. Eat somewhere else"
Chelsea A.,"Memphis, TN",17,18,1,1.0,6/23/2014,"If I could give 0 stars for service I would. I used to love bjs! After being stationed out of state for a while I've always loved coming home and going to BJS but the service has become horrible!!! We came in at about 1:30 and it wasn't busy, we were told it was going to be a 10 minute wait due to shift change, which is totally ok I understand that. The host was completely rude and passive!! The thing that gets me is that the host then went back to the host stand pointed at our table and started talking crap about all of us!! Hopefully management gets this place back to what it used to be because now I doubt I'll come back with service like that!"
Paul C.,"Chico, CA",1,19,,1.0,7/8/2014,"I'm so tired of the incompetence of people and I understand that being new can contribute to that. Bjs!!,  what ever you do don't eat here .... I ordered take out and everyone who eat, had to go shit there brains out and 2 girls that ordered salads had hot and cold sweats and were puking all night long.  All the food looked terrible like it was just slapped together and I paid 36 bucks for a burger and salads. I am a professional chef and I understand when I go out it won't be the same standards I'm used to but you can tell the GM and managers are just not doing what they should be because all your staff from Front of house to the back of house don't know shit and suck at there jobs. Not employees fault its the GM and managers there suck. Just wanted to thank you for the shitty food and stealing my money!!!"
Rem B.,"Stockton, CA",51,5,,1.0,12/23/2015,"Since the opening of this restaurant i've went here a lot as i worked in the same shopping center of it for a good 6 years. From all my experiences here Bjs in stockton is known for one thing. The lack of speed of service. I have come to just accept the fact that this restaurant is NEVER going to improve on that. Tonight i came here with my fiancé and two young sons meeting family for a night of drinks and appetizers, we showed up around 8 and ordered by 8:30 and boy did their slow service today really shine, by 8:55 my sons mini corndogs and fried plate came out with the flatbread pizza i ordered and holy cow were they cold. The flatbread was luke warm and very very hard and worst off they forgot my mother in laws flatbread pizza which finally came out around 9:40 and to top it off they didn't even comp it for the lack of care they put in their order. I guess they were too busy having devoted most of their servers to tending the large banquet group and forgot about the rest of the restaurant because their waitstaff was stretched thin but I've also become accustomed to that. Emily our server or Erika (not sure what her name was now) wasn't  clear and my mother in law ordered a alcoholic beverage that was far too strong and not close to what she asked for, forgot to bring my post pregnancy fiancé water she asked for to take her pain medication. Honestly im not sure if it is just this Stockton location but the food here is just awful. I only really used to come here when i worked in the area was for the wings and a handful of other items they dont even have on their menu anymore. I have had a handful of experiences here that were worse than this but i think this finally after all the years made me just not want to come here ever again. Their waitstaff has no clue what they're doing and the food varies what time of day you go. Seriously go to any other restaurant chain in stockton before coming here."
Marlys C.,"Outer Richmond, San Francisco, CA",0,5,2,5.0,11/14/2015,"I've lived in Stockton 9 months and been to BJs half a dozen times. I have never been disappointed with the food or service in any way. We always sit in the bar. We generally get appetizers (great variety) or flatbread, sometimes a burger or other sandwich. Also really appreciate half price wine on Tuesdays. Yes!!"
Robert D.,"Stockton, CA",47,17,,2.0,1/12/2014,Mediocre at best. Staff is trained and usually prompt but food is over rated and pricy. Dishes arrive at different times and mine was cold. Ordered a top shelf margarita and got a drink that tasted like sweet and sour. Beers are weak copies of prominent labels.
Gigi L.,"Palo Alto, CA",234,292,1322,3.0,10/3/2012,"Yes, it's a chain. And, yes, the menu is mainly 'bar food'.  So, that's why I'm giving it three stars only.   I would return here just to enjoy a beer at one of their nice high-top tables in an open bar area.  It makes for a great spot to meet a small group of friends and chat a few hours away ... in Stockton. I ordered a Sierra Nevada and lettuce wraps. And, I was quite content... :) Cheers!"
Luke Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,76,9,1.0,10/29/2012,"This place is horrible; I've been to many BJ's and this one just sucks. We got there around 8:30pm; had a party of 13; the place was pretty empty, we waited 20-25 mins before getting seated because I had to go complain first. Their excuse was that they had to set the table; when we got to our table, we had no spoons or forks so I guess that 25 mins setting up our table was a lie.  Then all ended up not finishing our food, it was pretty nasty, not well made like other BJ's! Will never come here again! I'm going to call management tomorrow and find out what is up with this restaurant; this place is not like a typical BJ's!"
Alicia W.,"Tracy, CA",12,16,18,2.0,9/8/2014,The food was good but then we noticed the dirty bear glass...after it was said and done.  Didn't notice the nasty spot in side the glass where the beer was housed. Did we get compensated? Nope. They just said we're sorry....I'm just saying...
Anna B.,"Sacramento, CA",179,161,365,4.0,9/18/2010,"I've only recently become acquainted with the BJ Restaurant chain. I've been to the one in Vacaville, Sacramento, and today, I went to the one in Stockton. They all provide a similar atmosphere: decorations, spacious seating areas, high ceilings, and dim lighting. My review will focus on the bar, because we just went there for afternoon drinks :D The bar has a nice feel to it. The arrangement of the liquor and glasses had a touch of sophistication. BJ's provides the standard selection of wines, beers, and mixed drinks. My only complaint is how the menu failed to provide the price on certain drinks. I didn't know how much my mojito was until I got the bill :/  Our bartender was great as she helped us decide which wine we wanted. I'm always skeptical when it comes to the wine descriptions, but the Barefoot Chardonnay light taste did not disappoint. Green apple wine! :] yumyum~ Other drinks? Strawberry Mojito: delicious. not too sweet. definitely a light and refreshing taste with some strawberries mashed into the mint.  Mango Mojito: tasted like a regular mojito. I only tasted the lemon and mint.. could not detect the mango flavor. it was still good :] Although there's nothing to define this place as unique, BJ's provides a wonderful dining experience for its patrons. ...thumbs up to the bar :D"
William D.,"San Francisco, CA",33,71,1,2.0,4/22/2014,"I really like BJ's usually. Staff here is nice and polite, however, I feel that our server was on something. She seemed a little out of it, greeted us, tried to compliment my friend and I, which was fine, but uncomfortable since we were trying to have a low key conversation. When she left and came back with drinks later, she was sweaty and even more out of it. Came back a third time and asked us to sign up for some club card type deal. I did it just to get her to leave. She was nice and friendly but I just didnt want her to come by anymore. Please review this."
Aaron R.,"Stockton, CA",1,97,,2.0,3/14/2014,Been here a few times. For beer it a great place. The food is mediocre. About what u expect from dennys. Service is indifferent. Special requests are forgotten and asking if ypur food is ok before we have tried it.
Nicole C.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,2.0,11/23/2014,"I love eating at BJ restaurant in Stockton, the food is always great but the workers never seem to care to welcome their customers. Every time I come in for a pick up order, the employees always walk back & forth with no urgency of saying "" hello we will be right with you"" or even a single saying of ""let me grab someone to help"". I waited for an hour & talked to a manager & there was no type of simpathy. Its really irritating asking people for help over and over and still no help. Its called communication in your customer service. Even if you are busy just acknowledge the customer so they know you'll be right with us!"
Anita S.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/23/2014,I am highly disgusted in the lack of staff ability to accommodate handicap. There is a wheel chair ramp in the very back of the restaurant. We have to find a way to get to it first. When we asked they said oh its in the back. In no way did they offer to help escort us to the rest of our party. We had to take it upon ourselves to ask patrons to move their chairs because there is absolutely no room to get through with a wheelchair. This ruined our whole experience. Even worse the one who was handicap was celebrating her birthday. Pretty sad.
Tim A.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/21/2015,Had the worst service and meal tonight at BJ's on Pacific Ave. Food was heavily spiced with way too much hot seasoning for pasta dish. My wife's burger overcooked and both meals arrived late. Never eating here again. One star is too much.
Ken S.,"Turlock, CA",24,113,25,4.0,3/23/2014,"Even though they were extremely busy, we were seated and waited on immediately. The burger and chicken sandwich were not inexpensive, but were very tasty. Their ""blonde"" beer was great."
Stacey P.,"Ventura, CA",109,382,641,4.0,1/20/2012,"Happy Hour Review! The hours are Monday-Friday 3-7PM and and Sunday-Thursday 10PM-12AM. The specials are $2 off appetizers, $1 off well drinks and pints and 1/2 price off mini pizzas!   It's a good spot to go with friends to catch up or watch a game.  They have a huge big screen tv but it's split into 6 screens so it might not even be bigger than the TV at your own home. I ordered the Mediterranean Deep Dish Mini Pizza and with the happy hour special it was only $5!  It comes with 4 slices and it's pretty filling.  I loved the sliced peperoncinis - spicy and sour!  The crust is just amaaaaazing and a must order for happy hour.  The staff is quick and super friendly.  My birthday was last week and my friend's birthday was last month but our waiter still gave us two free mini pizookies!  Great service! Great time!"
Jessica C.,"Hayward, CA",68,174,30,2.0,3/3/2012,"I treated my Mom's family here for my brother's farewell dinner. Our server was very pushy and when we did not order the items he mentioned, he completely neglected our table. Many times we tried to ask for a drink, or dessert  and he walked past us.  The food was great! The service was not."
