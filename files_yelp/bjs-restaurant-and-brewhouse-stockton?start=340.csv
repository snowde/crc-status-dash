Somnang H.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/4/2014,"Bj has the worst customer service ! Horrible... at first I thought it might just have been a long day for the waitress but there were a couple times after experiencing that, that they've neglected us or forgot something or dropped our food (had to reorder), and just plain rude attitude from the bartender so I just stop going there. It's been years since I've gone back and I'm not planing on ever returning. I've also had a lot better food. The only thing that is good about them are their beers. That's why I give them one star."
A C.,"Lodi, CA",0,24,,2.0,3/17/2012,"Great decor. I love the dark motif. Definitely an improvement over other chain restaurants which sometimes seem deliberatly loud (design as such). Thats all good I can say.  The food was atrocious. I had chicken wings which were certainly frozen and fried, not fresh. and they were cold in the middle. Sent them back. Had a salad that was drenched in dressing. very heavy handed.  lastly, had tortilla soup and tomato bisque. They were of a quality on a par with the soups you get from Safeway (Signature soups). Sure those are alright from the grocery store, full of salt, but still....they aren't bad at all. But at a restaraunt ?  I felt that they literally just opened up one of those, poured it in a bowl and served it up for a price. The soup was not fresh, thick and disgusting.  Service, atmosphere, timing of service, dealing with sent back food was all good. I will not be going back because I can get better food at the grocery store.  Also, had 2 of their beers (red, pale ale). Not exceptional, nothing to write home about and they had ample selections from the tap. kudos for that. if I wanted to go somewhere to have a drink and an appetizer, I would go back. I love the design. dark and refined."
Janet K.,"Pine Grove, CA",2,8,,2.0,5/16/2016,"Although I have been to the BJ's in Folsom several times, this was the first (and last) time to the BJ's in Stockton.  We were there on a Thursday night, May 12, 2016, and we were a party of 9.  It took a very, very long time before giving our orders, and then each item came out one at a time to different members of our party which made having dinner together very difficult.  The food, IMO, maxxed out at average, As a vegetarian, I ordered the broccoli cheese soup and salad combo.  The broccoli cheese soup was full of lots of flour to thicken, rather tasteless, and the caesar salad was pretty unremarkable and not particularly fresh.  Other members of our party received some really unexciting/unremarkable bar type food.  My recommendation to this place would be to reduce the number of menu offerings, and make them much higher quality.  The food quality at this restaurant as well as the very semi-attentive service will keep me away from there in the future.  There were many staff members in the front house, maybe not in the kitchen, but the end result is below mediocre food and mediocre service."
Gail F.,"Stockton, CA",16,5,2,2.0,4/23/2014,"I only got one thing to say: service here is unpleasant. I don't know if the servers are over-worked or just fed up with customers...either way, they shouldn't be treating their customers with impatience and misdirection."
Alexandra A.,"Stockton, CA",4,76,5,2.0,1/20/2014,"I called in to order a PIZOOKIE PLATTER to-go for my birthday. I had the choice of getting 2 flavors or 4 flavors. same price for either choice. about $22. I've gotten a pizookie platter before when I've dined in and for some reason, this one looked A LOT smaller than I remember. I should've just made my own. I get to the To-go counter, and there was  2 employees just standing behind the counter with their arms crossed. NOT ONE of them asked me if I had been helped already. maybe the to-go area isn't where they're supposed to be working, but seriously, they could've at least asked if i had been helped, and grabbed someone who could actually help me. FINALLY someone helped me, and I had to wait about 10 min. they said because the pizookie was still baking, although I had called in 4 hrs prior and told them I would be there at a specified time to pick it up. When it came time to eat the pizookie, the top was cooked, but when we bit into it, it was still doughy. I felt so embarrassed that my guests got pieces of a raw cookie. There was some leftover pizookie, and when I went to look under the pizookie...it was all raw. next time I'm just going to make my own pizookie and purchase my own tub of vanilla ice cream. i'm sure all that would be cheaper than $22."
Robert S.,"Lodi, CA",63,195,179,3.0,2/8/2014,Always a long wait for the food wich is never great IMNSHO. Server (young gentleman) was spot on and awesome though

E M.,"Fremont, CA",0,104,3,3.0,5/16/2015,"5 stars for the friendly greeting and smile from the hostess.  Waiter was friendly but never came to check if we need plate for appetizers, fill empty drinks, or how did we like our food.  We had to look for him and ask for whatever we needed.  Food is just good, Nothing spectacular here.  Maybe just a place for salads and burgers here."
Tiger L.,"Stockton, CA",1,8,1,2.0,9/30/2014,"Sub par service today. Extra long waiting time for food, burned food and warmed over. One of the worse  visits I've had."
Tom M.,"Stockton, CA",13,109,14,4.0,2/16/2014,"Didn't have dinner this time, we simply stopped for a few drinks. Great selection of brews on tap from dark stouts to light blondes. Like the atmosphere as it is active but not overly loud as to where you can't carry on a conversation. Bartenders polite and friendly. My only complaint is the drinks are pricey, 2 beers, 2 margaritas = $30."
Cynthia M.,"Stockton, CA",11,13,3,1.0,12/14/2013,Horrible overpriced food! We went with our kids out to a birthday lunch for my birthday and I got a Caesar salad with chicken and a soup chicken was DRY! Salad was limp and over dressed my husband's salad had no dressing and they charged $5 for a half of cup of soup! My kids said there food was not good and my sons pizza was burned. I ate one piece of the chicken and told the waitress she says I like the chicken here.  Never again!
Mike T.,"Stockton, CA",2,11,,2.0,6/20/2012,"I normally really like this place, but I took my dad there for the first time on Father's Day.  It was really busy and they weren't ready for it.  They lost one of the orders for our table, so we had to share food with that person until their's came.  We also didn't get silverware until our food sat in front of us for several minutes. I love the Jerimiah Red beer and I will come back again, but NOT during rush times or Holidays!!!"
Alexandra M.,"Stockton, CA",154,90,73,3.0,8/21/2013,"This is just another BJ's restaurant is not Great but is not Bad either. Like some similar restaurants is a hit or miss, sometimes the food has no flavor whatsoever, sometimes is just boring and sometimes you just get the dam wrong order haha :) just like the food the servers are a hit or miss. There are some great waitress here but like every where also there are the ones that have the "" I hate my dam job look in their face""  due to this attitude they provide a horrible costumer service blah ;p. I still think that BJ's is a good place to have some drinks with friends even though drinks are kind of expensive :) conclusion is; don't expect anything more than what you will get at your average neighborhood BJ's the food is not the great and they don't have many choices, but other than that is worth giving a try."
Lauren N.,"Walnut, CA",112,87,16,3.0,3/23/2012,"The place can get loud and annoying, but I like their pizookies and fried artichoke hearts. I always get the fried artichoke hearts whenever I go. The drinks are alright. Not the best. I don't recommend their buffalo chicken pizza (way too salty).  If you like big crowds and loud restaurants, I recommend it. If not, beware!"
Phi N.,"Stockton, CA",79,9,2,1.0,2/28/2014,An assistant manager name Sam called me and the purpose of his call was to apologize for my awful experience.  But he didn't sound apologetic or sincere.  It seemed as though his call was just protocol.  He told me he will send me a gift card.  I didn't care to get one because I do not want to come back to BJ's.  But I accepted the offer because I can donate it.  It's for 20.00.  It's probably enough for 1 person but why would I come back to a place I don't like alone?  The call was bad.  He didn't sound like he wanted to make things better.
Julie E.,"Stockton, CA",10,5,2,1.0,7/16/2013,"Every time I've come here I have not liked my food. As a pregnant chef I understand I have high standards but my food shouldn't be bland, burned or soggy at the prices the food is at. And my server shouldn't act like a total b*^*h when I tell her I don't like it. That's exactly how you lose out on a tip."
Chong V.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/22/2015,"Me and my group of friends come here quite frequently, but with the crap experience we received last time, I'm sad to say we will never be coming to this location again. Kristine was just an absolute terrible waitress. Her customer service skills were beyond incompetent and she was just downright lazy.  We came on August 22, around 3pm. Kristine, our waitress, greeted us and after taking our orders 15 mintues after seating us; she walked passed our table literally 27 times blindly not seeing that a majority of us had nothing in our cups before asking us if we would like a refill. 27 times, we actually counted how many laps she did around our table. Yes you can say ""well, you can simply grab her attention and ask for a refill,"" but everytime we said it, she would ignore us and keep on doing her laps around our section giving no customers any attention. The tables around us had leftover food from the time we got there (so she was obviously not cleaning her area either). For coming with a group of 12, we figured they at would've at least been more attentive, but sadly that is not the case with Kristine. We actually never saw her do anything but take our orders, give us one refill, and eagerly gave us our bill so she could claim her tips (which none of us gave). The worst part about it was she stood there over our shoulder waiting to see how much the tip would be.  I am actually quite curious if this is who they hire, can I get a job here so I can exercise and walk laps around tables and get paid while doing so?"
Linda L.,"Stockton, CA",17,32,42,4.0,3/20/2014,I'm not too crazy abt this place..let alone their food but their house brew beers are pretty good..I honestly have to say I only come here for he drinks..lol..services here is always great..staff are really friendly and always make sure that ur needs are taken care of..
Neil R.,"San Diego, CA",70,7,1,1.0,9/28/2013,"Do not attend to watch a good football game. 2 waiters have refused to put on Ohio State vs Wisconsin, however Missouri vs Arkansas State, Air Force vs Nevada are on as well as ESPNNEWS. Didn't seem like too difficult of a request. Disappointing."
Heather S.,"Sacramento, CA",232,85,14,4.0,11/6/2013,Pazookie. It is all about the pazookie... And maybe some beer. Need I say more? Cookies and beer win the day!
