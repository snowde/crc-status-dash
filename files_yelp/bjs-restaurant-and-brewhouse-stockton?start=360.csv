Ed W.,"San Francisco, CA",4,13,,1.0,3/16/2014,"We love bj as a chain, but for this location beware.  If you do not know your wine do not order here.  We love la crema Pinot noir and we know how it tastes.  When we ordered a glass(glass not cleaned properly, wet and not dry, and lipstick marks) no matter where we sit, we do not get a genuine glass of la crema.  For some reason we always end up getting a glass of everything but Pinot noir.  Not only with the red the white wines also.  Besides la crema we know our kendall jackson too.  Do my wife and I get our Kendall Jackson? No we get a white that is obviously not Kendall Jackson.  Not to harp but the bartenders literally pull our glasses out of he dishwasher.  I hate to be negative but this place really sucks!!!!"
Bob S.,"Stockton, CA",26,24,,1.0,5/6/2015,"I don't know if they suddenly didn't freaking care of customer service but for the most part it's reasonable. Unfortunately, in my last visit and with ONLY three customers in the bar area. We waited several minutes until we received our main course. I understand with a high volume of customers but this.  Unacceptable!!! In fact, I emailed my concerns to the Assistant General Manager but has expected no feedback. I wish I can give this stupid place -25 stars. Horrible!!"
Alex V.,"Tracy, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/15/2014,Terrible service. Waiting to be seated and the workers are just looking at us.  Pathetic!!!!
Sothary C.,"Stockton, CA",250,475,605,4.0,11/11/2011,"My thoughts about this place has changed. I love the bar. Drinks were good, appetizers were good and it was overall pretty darn good. Let's just say one drink did the job lol"
Carlos A.,"Stockton, CA",6,24,98,5.0,9/24/2013,"A group of friends and I enjoyed adult beverages with several appetizers and to say the least service was great, thank you Marriette and not to forget about Joy the manager being generous with promotional cards."
Chris M.,"Stockton, CA",10,97,32,1.0,12/26/2013,"Icky icky icky.  More chain crap for Stockton to drown in.  Again why the f is this place busy when there are so many very good local restaurants.  Abbey= better beer and food.  Mile wine bar, market tavern, French 25.........   Come on people.  Stop this chain insanity and send them packing just like they send their profits packing out of our community."
Darrell G.,"Manteca, CA",2,11,,1.0,5/2/2014,Went here May 1 for dinner while my car was being fixed. Arrived at 5pm and had a friend waiting at a table for us. It took about 15 minutes to get my beer. During which we ordered.  I ordered just a house salad which I've ordered before. At 5:30 I was feeling really full from half a pint of beer. Something that generally happens when a tap doesn't have the co2 set right.  At 5:45 my salad finally arrived. My daughters pizza and sliders had not arrived yet. My car was ready and I needed to pick it up. I had a bite of a strange house salad. It had spinach leaves instead of lettuce. No cucumbers. Diced tomatoes instead of sliced and some kind of cheese. The taste was off. I had a second bite and something was definitely wrong. I left to get air and pick up my car hoping the fresh air would help.  I got my car and went back across the street and by now I was feeling horribly sick. I left some money with my friend and went home.  I was horribly sick and managed to make it to bed where I slept until my alarm the next morning went off(about 11 hours) Today I'm still sick and can't eat or keep anything down. Hopefully they throw away the rest of that spinach stuff and go back to a simple garden salad
Rexelle S.,"Stockton, CA",49,29,,4.0,4/23/2011,"Been here a couple of times. Looks just like any other BJs. If you go to UOP, you can use your Pacific Cash. It's a great casual place for family and friends. It has a sports bar and flat screen TVs placed around the restaurant for those who aren't sitting at the bar. They even give you the option to take out in which you can order online, on the phone, or at the restaurant which is usually located on the side of the entrance. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's too dark. I enjoy their deep pizza dishes as well as the infamous pazookies. Believe it or not, a lot of people have no idea what a pazookie is...REALLY?! I don't want to sound like a fatty but by this time, I thought the word would spread like fire lol. Also, kids can design their own pizzas! They have this whole sha-bam of what they want on it, how they want it, and then I think it comes with sides, a drink, and a dessert!  Their signature non-virgin drinks are pretty good. I'm a mixed drink type of person so I enjoy their ""smoothies"" and ""sodas"" lol..(Strawberry Splash, Berri Delicious, and Frosty Peach are the signature drinks I've tasted) I've also tried their traditional mojito and a couple of their signature brewed beers...Mind you, I don't go here to drink even during happy hour lol or any place for that matter...but those are just some drinks I've had while accompanied by friends and family. Anyway, the main reason I would go to BJs is for their garden fresh specialty salads! O-M-G. So far, I've tried the Sante Fe, BBQ Chicken, and BJ's Cobb salads and let me tell you, the flavors NEVER fail! They also give you a buttload of it so you'll have plenty to take home...unless you're just a big eater then eat away..but for me, it's rare I finish my food at restaurants.  Another plus about BJ's is they have an approximate calorie count for each item on the menu. Cool right? Very helpful especially with all the diets and weight watchers out there! Most of the servers in stockton's BJ are usually REALLY friendly and I think it's because 1) they may be a working student 2) they really want a high tip lol Nonetheless, I crave for their salads. TRY. THEM.....THE END. :)"
Vicky Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",292,489,167,2.0,11/9/2011,"Guaranteed long wait and inconsistent service. The spicy spaghetti is my favorite menu item, although still mediocre in the grand scheme of chain restaurants. There are better places to get pizza. And FYI, the Pizookie is close to 900 calories."
Bob R.,"San Ramon, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/16/2013,"- Appalling customer service. - Unbelievable wait times (especially for non-peak periods during the day/night). - Comically unrefined (rude) staff. Plenty of T.V.s, though."
Desiree P.,"Stockton, CA",0,6,,3.0,1/10/2015,"It depends on certain days. Some days, I'll get a waiter who provides great customer service and other days, I'll get waitresses who take a long time to get our orders. I mean BJs got great food, but the waitresses could be more courteous. SO on average, I'll give three stars..great food and drinks and more than average customer service."
Sally H.,"Stockton, CA",55,65,10,2.0,1/31/2011,"My boyfriend and I came in on a Friday night. The place was packed, but we were seated quickly and the waiter came and took our order within five minutes of sitting. We placed an order on the avocado egg rolls for appetizer and we planned on sharing the scampi pasta as the main course. We drank water. Within twenty minutes of ordering, our scampi pasta arrived... but where was our egg rolls? The waiter came and apologized. Additionally, another lady, perhaps the supervisor for that night, came and apologized and said the egg rolls would be on the house because it came AFTER the main course. We were delighted and ordered dessert after consuming the appetizer & main dish.  However, when the check came, the egg rolls were on the bill. =( And my boyfriend is such a push-over that he just paid the entire bill, and left a dollar tip. Minus one star for the appetizer coming AFTER the main course. Minus one star for the miscommunication between the supervisor and waiter. Minus another star because TWO people came to apologize, and the waiter apologized twice - and we were starting to feel bad because they were apologizing so much."
Jenny M.,"Atwater, CA",4,12,,1.0,6/13/2013,"Service SUCKS! We were there for a little over 2 hours. I didn't even know a waitress could move that slow. If you love waiting for food and the check, this is the place for you!"
Ry T.,"San Francisco, CA",582,1509,1898,3.0,1/9/2011,"BJ's and Elephant Bar are in the same class of chain restaurants for me.  The design at this BJ's about the same as the one we tried in Vacaville.  We got here right before 3 PM when they stop serving their lunch menu. We shared the fried calamari appetizer, $9.  It was pretty good, not oily and the flour batter was crispy. Jr. Yelper doesn't like tenacles, so more for the parents!  Woot.  Jr. Yelper had the chic/broccoli pasta  & said it was good.  Hubby had the chic parmesan over spaghetti.  The chic parmesan was pretty good but the pasta was over peppered and too spicy.  Both pasta dishes came with 2 bread wedges which were bland. The portions for lunch were large such that only Hubby could finish his.  I tried the all you can eat soup & salad for about $9.  The salad was a non-anchovy Caesar and soup of your choice.  The Caesar was pretty good with crunchy, fresh croutons.  The clam chowder was salty but tasty.  For my refill, I tried the broccoli cheddar soup which disappointed me.  It was way saltier than the clam chowder and I have a recipe for this soup which tastes much better.   Our server was really nice and she was very attentive, promptly bringing refills of soda, water and my soup/salad refills.  Might consider coming back but would have to look for lower sodium items on the menu."
Christine H.,"San Jose, CA",511,148,138,2.0,12/28/2010,"NOTHING SPECTACULAR. Its only great for large groups and have late hours--and that's basically it. I have tried nearly half of their appetizers, pizzas, soups, sandwiches, entrees, and cocktails. And its nothing crazy-amazing. Its just O.K. I would only come here if I have to-- for birthday gatherings. Other than that, I have no reasons to. Its a waste of money to spend on ""just O.K."" food, you know? BJ's is most popular for their pizzas and their beers. I have tried their pizzas and I personally think they are skimpy on their toppings and its mostly dough you are eating!! I believe Michael's Pizzas (in Stockton) is 10x better (great quality pizzas with big fresh (and generous amount of) toppings and a bigger pizza for the same price of BJ's)! And as for the beers, I am in no position to comment. I'm not a beer drinker/lover and have not tried their beers. 4 STARS: ATMOSPHERE -flat screen TVs all over the place, big booths, and dimmed lightings def sets the mood. Laid back and fun atmosphere. 2 STARS: FOOD -unfortunately, everything that I have tired, i have tasted it better elsewhere."
Ross M.,"Elgin, IL",9,6,7,1.0,11/27/2013,"Well, against my better judgement, I've been back a few times. The soup & salad lunch has been good. I really have no complaints about their food. However, their service is almost always below acceptable. Tonight the food and beer was good. My server/bartender disappeared after serving a beer and taking my appetizer order. Order was brought by a ""runner"". The manager, after two fails found it impossible to tune in the proper hockey game. This is a ""sports bar"". You would think someone their would know how to tune a TV!"
Anna T.,"Sacramento, CA",0,22,4,1.0,7/7/2014,"I used to love this bj location, but the last few visits I've had was extremely terrible. The food never seems fresh anymore. Even though it takes forever to get your food, food comes out cold and nasty. It taste old and have been laying around. Some waitresses are nice, while others just plain suck. For the price you pay for the food here, I rather go somewhere else and have better service and fresh, good tasting food."
Shirley M.,"Concord, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/7/2015,"If you want wine with your meal check the menu first ...$10.95 for a glass of 'house cab', yet a glass of chardonnay from the same mediocre winery is just $5.95. Sneaky trick they are pulling, one would expect the 'house wine' rates to be same or near same. I was a fan of their Fish and chips with skinny fries but this time it was over cooked on the outside and the batter still raw on the inside.  Maybe they're under new management or just cutting cost (labor) and trying to hide raising prices?"
Kim D.,"Stockton, CA",56,17,4,3.0,12/3/2012,"Our server was a real sweetheart, but we both had same steak med rare and one came Out perfect and other came more than well done and burnt side down.(hmmm) I let the server know and he got manager ( just wanted them to know cause obviously the cooks knew they burnt it and sent anyway) who came out and seemed totally irritated with us!! We did not ask  for money back or anything just figured he might want to know! Flavor wise everything was delicious - just nothing worse than expecting a medium rare steak and getting a tough overcooked one instead :( I'm not one to send food back or be nasty about it so I just ate it. The manager could have at least pretended he cared a little more instead of acting like we were inconveniencing him though!! (and anyone that's seen hell's kitchen knows its pretty amateur to send 2 of same plates to same table cooked totally different like that! Hello!!!)"
Mrs H.,"Fresno, CA",5,8,1,1.0,9/1/2013,"I love BJs. I try 1 in every city I visit. Unfortunately, this particular BJs provided me with a poor quality experience. To make it brief, I had undercooked chicken in my jambalaya. I had a long wait in line at customer service for my refund (TakeOut customer). Bad experience!!!"
