Nikita K.,"San Francisco, CA",105,550,460,3.0,1/16/2013,"I do not think I will be going back to BJ's for anything but the PAZOOKIE. We got the biggest one they had, and it was delicious. All the other food was rather simple and overpriced."
Drew W.,"Lathrop, CA",0,19,9,2.0,3/16/2015,"Called ahead and was told by front desk I was not able to call in unless my party was 10 or more. My wife and I walked in and noticed our pager had a note stating, ""call ahead party of 6 or less"". I was a little frustrated when I was told differently. The hostess should know policy or simple don't answer the phones.  Our 20 min wait was more like a 1hr"
Renata P.,"Antioch, CA",79,3,1,4.0,6/5/2013,Totally love the consistency with good food and beverage. Service can be slow during lunch time but awesome otherwise.
Roxy L.,"Stockton, CA",51,258,232,2.0,9/2/2012,"Only giving the 2stars for the food only...service horrible, cleanliness terrible, attentiveness non-existant, friendliness totally missing. Late lunch so it was not at all busy. Seated in a dirty booth. I had to use my hand and the menus to brush off the seat. After sitting down one of the Other waiters came over to ask if he could wipe down the seat. I told him no I think I just did that myself. Our waitress was totally oblivious to this conversation or just didnt care that she tried to sit me in a bed of crumbs, salt and chunks of beef. We could not decide right away what to order but that didnt matter because our M.I.A waitress, Jessica, was nowhere to be found. While in the restroom I heard 2 of the workers talking and 1 was telling the other one that some guest was requesting a new waitress, I'm guessing it was our waitress. She was just awful. Spit while she spoke to us, took forever to take our drink orders or even to give water. Honey, its like 96 degrees outside and we are roasting and we cannot even get a cold drink! Little Miss Jessica finally took our order. Then she fiiiinally brought our drinks. The food came and tasted ok, better every other time we have been there. Thanks for that experience. My daughter was home for the long holiday visiting from college. We could have went many other places but we came here. Maybe next time we won't."

Emily S.,"Stockton, CA",286,904,829,2.0,8/21/2008,"We've eaten at this location 5 times.... maybe 6.  Some yelpers have accused me of being unfair in my reviews.  But when a bad experience is etched in my memory... you bet your ass that I'm going to tell the world about it. Trying to be fair... it is a chain.  I can now say that BJ's is not all that it is cracked up to be.... in MY opinion.   The other evening, my friend ordered her salad dressing on the side.  Let me tell you, it was a a big salad.  And she got a tiny ramekin of dressing.     I had to pretty much tackle someone to give her more dressing.  I'm not sure if that person worked there.  Some of  employees seem a bit flighty.   My husband loves all of the beer choices.  I've given up on the specialty drinks.  The bartenders are terrible.  The service is hit or miss... mostly miss.  MISS-taken for service and good food."
Tammy S.,"Sacramento, CA",68,8,7,1.0,3/27/2015,"we go to bj's all the time.  there is really no other place to go that has that many food choices.  but within the past year they have changed over employees and management.  the past 2 times we have gone there we have had to wait and wait for our food.  the manager would comp us something on the bill but thats not the point.  its getting your food in a timely manner.  we went when it was not busy and my soup took the longest to get to us.  I had a talk with the manager and explained all this to him.  we shall see if it helps, if not we shall just have to find another place to all meet up at."
Tisha Y.,"San Francisco, CA",15,97,413,2.0,9/7/2008,"I honestly do not know what to say.  Everything was pretty mediocre.  The portions are too large, which I find is a complete waste.  The vodka cranberry I bought had too much ice and was very weak.   On the bright side, our waitress was very nice and the birthday desert (large warm cookie & ice cream) we got was delicious. Other than that, eh.... it was okay."
Tina W.,"Stockton, CA",92,5,1,2.0,12/29/2013,The calamari and boneless chicken is NOT worth $10 and the service is absolutely horrible.
Brayden Scott Peng V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,38,,3.0,12/10/2014,"An upgrade version of AppleBees and Chili's. Friendly workers, and good service. Nothing much about the place since the food are kind of pricey for the portion you get, but their beverages are good, can't complain there."
Casey H.,"Thornton, CA",3,9,5,3.0,2/4/2012,"We went on a Saturday afternoon, about 1:30, we where seated right away. Atmosphere is really nice, alittle noisy, Staff was friendly. I ordered the Double Brewhouse Burger (1lb.) $10.95. Good taste, but I asked for it medium, got it welldone, had to ask for my fries, One in our party ordered the Calzone, $9.95. Thought it was boring, not enough filling. Over all, we would go back, but not in a rush."
Melissa E.,"San Jose, CA",207,55,60,4.0,3/30/2011,"Okay okay.. I really don't like writing reviews for big name restaurants. It's a standard BJ's. Okay service, good food. What draws me to write this particular review is their bar area. There's nothing better than walking straight into the bar area, grabbing a table, ordering some appetizers & drinking with good company. The location is great.. Convenient. The wait staff is okay. I personally think the customer service was better when they had first opened. Other than that.. This is a favorite place to grab a drink, or two."
Nicole L.,"Stockton, CA",19,52,1,2.0,11/2/2010,"BJ's is good for 2 things: Beer, and the mini appetizers. I've never been very impressed with the menu - it's rather average. Last time I was there I had a few of their  beers - reasonable prices, ice cold, great flavor.  I also shared a few of the mini appetizers with a friend. The plates are priced between 2.99 - 4.99 and we ordered 3 different ones. The potato chips were pretty good, had a great crispy texture.  Our server was average, not bad but nothing special. I like the avocado egg rolls but they don't seem to be as good as they used to be. The pizza here is good too, but not in comparison to some of our local pizza restaurants. It just seems like the only time i ever come here is because I have a gift card."
James L.,"Stockton, CA",4,49,,2.0,5/14/2010,"You asshats left our group of 8 hanging last week. We had two buzzers, yet you failed to buzz either on of them. We waited for an hour, till we decided to ask the hostess, and all she could say was ""uh-ohs....""  The manager apologized and hooked us up with a free order of appetizers....  Yea.. waste my damn time...."
Fire Mom W.,"Lodi, CA",0,42,,2.0,2/1/2015,Our server was awesome but the wait time for the food was HORRIBLE. Then one of the orders was messed up. While the service was great from our server- the time to wait for food was not worth coming back for. The pazookies were good and the manager gave them to us for free which was a plus. But I would not recommend this place unless waiting for an hour for ALL of your food to arrive and then waiting an extra 10 minutes for silverware is worth it to you! And the pizza was yucky!!!!
Tom I.,"Richmond, VA",562,331,534,2.0,8/3/2010,"I really don't like writing reviews to chain restaurants since they're typically the same thing across the nation. However, the service here is so bad. i don't understand why it takes so long to take an order and so much longer to get your food.  i'll only go for the blonde ale and a pizookie."
Stephen I.,"Stockton, CA",1,2,,4.0,1/25/2015,"The food was great but the best thing about the visit was our server, Mayra, who made us feel welcome and made sure we were pampered.  She is very conscientious and focuses on doing a great job!  I wish all servers were like her."
Dexter A.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,,5.0,1/14/2016,"very good service, fresh food loved it , definitely go there againb"
d p.,"Linden, CA",3,45,13,2.0,6/25/2012,This Restaurant looks nice staff is also nice although very forgetful when it comes to putting orders into the kitchen.  Our server got the wrong appetizer and the wrong dinner order.  That being said lets move on to the food i have been there two times and unless you like salty soup and pasty breading on southern fried chicken then this may not be the place for you.  We also got the sweet balsamic chicken and had good flavor but it also had a pastiness to it.. Cheers to the small thin fries and onion strings those we actually tasty.  Parmesan crusted chicken sand. also soggy and pasty.  Well i tried it and most likely wont be going back again.  I may have a more sophisticated pallet in comparison to most of their clientele.
Jose G.,"Aromas, CA",6,100,6,3.0,10/6/2010,"I had to give it 3 as opposed to two due to the fact that the food was good and better than I expected. we came here to eat and have a relaxed time. I've worked in the Restaurant industry before as a waiter and floor manager and was not impressed by how they were conducting business. Granted this is located int he Ghetto of California ( Stockton) so maybe the waiters and floor managers were having a bad time with the local populace.. who knows... who cares.. not  my problem. there was some debacle over the seating arrangement and no one could understand how to fix it. so I took it upon myself to ask a waitress who was clueless and had to go an get some manager. i explained to him how to fix it without violating fire codes or disturbing other guests.  he went back to ask the floor manager...   our waitress Anne comes by to take our orders while all this is happening except we weren't aware she was taking orders. she didn't make an effort or attempt to get our attentions and it was only by chance that I saw her with her pen and pad. I then got everyone's attention told the manager to come back after the orders were placed. drinks and some orders were taken and we were left alone with our seating arrangement fiasco I got inpatient and decided to re arrange it.. allowing even more room for the waitresses to walk and expanding seating availability for our group. so by this time our waitress claimed that she was ending her shift and passed us over to  Shaniqua ( I kid you not)    ** OK I kid! I don't remember her name but  ""Shaniqua""helps the story . **    **had to add this disclaimer as some people have been getting their panties up in a wad**.  Shaniqua seemed like a good gal and proceeded to take our remaining orders.   by the time the orders come in we see our old waitress still working just not our table.. I guess we somehow scared her off..  after about 45 minutes we begin to get our food. and another 30 pass before the whole table is plated. there were incorrect orders and after we politely stated that some of the things on our plates were wrong, shaniqua decided to give us the attitude. the floor manager came up to us apologizing for the confusion and letting us know that our plate would be right up. the guy kept returning to our table always apologizing.. I guess there might have been another table there causing a ruckus and we were somehow mistaken for them. I have toned this down severely. in order not to scare any reader about this place. I think it's an alright establishment for all we knew.. this may have been the starting night for many of these servers.. it was a Saturday night after all and the place was packed. I had the Thai Salmon dish and will have to admit that it was quite tasty..  asides from the confusions , seating and waitress fiasco,  I can say the wait was worth it. their beer was alright.. nothing special but better than your typical commercial can. I've experienced better beers and selections at a Yardhouse or local brewery. but hey this beer selection might just fancy your pallet.. I say give it a try.  taste is subjective to one's preferences after all."
