Hui L.,"Allentown, PA",0,9,1,4.0,10/24/2017,"I like BJ, they make good food for a franchises. The pork chop (seasonal item) is amazing if they cook it right and usually they do. Was here twice last week and the first time it came out nice and moist but second time it came out dry."
Honest A.,"Manteca, CA",70,67,9,3.0,12/12/2016,"So.... somehow we had a change I  servers though our first server never left... oh well his lost.  Late last night, dec 11th was awesome with or server (thin African American with a possible fohawk).  Haven't been to bjs for some time because of the crappy service.   First off, i called before heading out to a different town... seen they brought back the pizza special for $25... called ahead of time to make sure it was still going on... the assured me they did listening i was driving dive distance to get there.   On the way in a seen a name of a bet that caught my eye, especially when i read underneath out that out was a ginger beer.  Our second server informed us it hadn't been around for months?  He went out of his way a few times to see what he could do, which was extremely appreciative.   Love bjs pizza, beers, and pazookies (and other good when i can get away from my faves) but it's been about a year since we've been because of horrible costumer service.   This guy was amazing.... if I'm every in town I'll be sure to stop by and ask for him.  .....Please make sure anyone who answers the phone doesn't answer any questions they aren't a hundred percent about....."
Donald Y.,"Stockton, CA",10,3,1,1.0,7/5/2017,Bad service with an attitude ruined our family night... Could not read menu in the dimly lit dinning area.
Devlen Lane Z.,"CA, CA",64,1,,2.0,7/22/2017,To be honest the service was slow and really inattentive. Waited a very long time for the food and drinks. The pizza was extremely soggy and absolutely cover in sauce we had to eat it with a knife and fork. The only thing nice about the night was the drinks. Very flavorful.
Jerry L.,"Stockton, CA",2,76,3,4.0,9/26/2017,Food ok but avoid southern foods on the menu. It tastes plain. The menu is easy to read for dyslx!c people like myself. Big bold words and huge pictures that will make your jaw drop cause it looks to real. I remember stepping out to the restroom to wash my face. When i was there were no mirrors at the urinals. Cause us men like mirror while doing our buisness.
Wendell C.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,3.0,12/11/2017,"On 12/10/17, I called BJs when they opened on 10 am to be put on the the waiting list for 10 people at 6:30 pm.  I spoke to a supervisor by the name of Lisa who said typically people would call 30 min before their requested reservation time.  I thought this odd as this seems late to reserve or put on a waiting list.  Nevertheless, she stated she put me down on the waiting list.  I arrived with my party 15 before reservation time to a crowded BJs.  I thought to myself that I was glad I made reservations. I checked in with the hostess and apparently my name was not in the system.  They stated they were trying to seat groups who reserved 24 hours ago.  24 hours ago?  Lisa never mentioned 24 hours, she stated 30 minutes.  I requested for the manager, whose name is Marissa and relayed my dissatisfaction. To her credit, she rectified the situation and we were seated within 20 minutes as opposed to the 1 hour wait.  When seated, our server was cordial and helpful throughout the service.  The only issue is we waited 30 min for our food. That might be due to us having 10 people and they were busy.  Other than the reservation snafu and waiting on the food our experience and the food was decent.  Marissa claimed she would talk to Lisa about communicating the reservation protocol.  I hope that happens."
Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,4.0,3/21/2016,"Seems like my reviews are shifting back and forth for this place on a month to month basis. I decided to come in and give the Parmesan Crusted Chicken another chance. It was cooked to perfection today. Had no fatty/chewy parts I couldn't cut through this visit. They also gave me a little bit more broccoli this time around. They are either accepting feedback from customers on the food and making a shift toward the better, or they got rid of the cook messing this dish up.  If you're one of the small amount of people who walks into a brewhouse and doesn't drink, I recommend the green tea. It's great and will quench your thirst. Solid turn around based on the last time I came here and didn't feel confident going with the same dish. I'm hoping for consistency next time I come in."
Holly W.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/20/2017,"Food is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Fantastic service, even today on a busy day. Very kind staff and waiters"
G J.,"Stockton, CA",3,25,19,5.0,12/15/2016,Been coming here for years. They never disappoint and the service is fast. We ordered the fried chicken with mash potatoes and the Mediterranean Pita tacos. For the appetizer we tried the guacamole with chips. Not bad at all. Will continue to eat here
Salyna B.,"Stockton, CA",45,5,,1.0,6/27/2017,Service Was Bad They Messed Up My Order And I Had To Wait Until They Fix The problem!! But they took forever to get my order out!! By that time everyone I was with already finished there food!! So I Told him I want to cancel it instead!! Then they came back and packed it anyways and said they took it off the bill.. Over all beside them taking long to even bring the correct order out I got a free meal afterwards..
Bernadette F.,"Elk Grove, CA",71,26,,1.0,10/17/2016,"Nope. Nope. Nope. Go somewhere else. Seriously.  Horrible people work here. Honestly half the staff here should be written up or fired. The only people who should keep their jobs is the host with the bangs and then also the bus boy who gave us our waters after 20 minutes of waiting.  First off hosts the one with curly hair and the one with a tight pony tail-awful. You'll see them faces pinched. With no smile. My friend and I walked up to the counter, without a hello or a welcome they just looked up at us once maybe-and went back to whatever they were doing. My friend had to get their attention to get seats. And then bangs swooped in and took us to our seats-you know actually doing her job. Then our waitress comes and she is anything but pleasant. Completely sarcastic(no she didn't get tip and neither did her braided teammate who just ruined dessert.) Okay we ordered are meal and the whole time I never got a water refill was never asked-my bad, but finally I asked for water and a pazooki...20 min pass. My friend looks around, the waiters and waitresses are not taking any hints-until boom bus boy swoops in and gets us the water himself! (You know DOING OTHER PEOPLES JOBS)  15 minutes later, some other waitress-I don't know who she is-has our pazookis in bags to go. No girl-we didn't say to go. Sent her all the way back to the kitchen. and then waited another 10 min...15...20...? And our original waitress comes back with our receipt telling us there has been a mistake and that we were put up the list in priority so our pazooki's would be out soon...15 min later...we're done. Outta here. How dare you make us wait practically an hour for dessert and make us pay for it. Never eating here again. Unless they change up the staff. I'd rather drive out to some other BJs."
Thomas R.,"Stockton, CA",0,8,,5.0,12/16/2016,"I come here sometimes with coworkers during lunch. We'll place our orders on the phone then swing by and pick them up. Last time I came with my buddies, we got two pizzas and they were amazing. Sweet Pig and some thin crusted pesto chicken thing. The two were enough to feed four people and the price came out pretty reasonable.  I brought my mother last night, and we had a great time. Our server, Derek, was fantastic. He was very attentive and came by to check on us regularly. He was very patient when we couldn't decide what we wanted and asked him to come back in 5 minutes.  There were some young looking servers at an empty table slamming menus down on the table. I was literally jumping in my seat from the loud noise because it kept scaring me. This is probably the only unsavory experience I've had here. This is a BJ's though, so I know better than to expect all the young employees to be professional."
Jacque G.,"Orange, CA",55,45,13,5.0,4/5/2017,I been to many BJ restaurants before and this location is pretty good. I usually just come in a sit at the bar. The bartender always tend to me right away and makes my drinks good. I know if I'm coming here imma get what I want and get good service here. Even on busy nights here the staff is fast and I don't have to wait a long time for my food to come out. Favorite dish is the Mediterranean tacos (sooo good and it's on their light dishes)There margarita are really good here too!
Anthony -.,"Stockton, CA",0,10,,5.0,6/13/2017,"Loved Bjs at the bar area. Its always fun, and they are right on time with everything me and my friend order. Bar tender there was awesome. I definitely left her a nice tip because she did a nice job serving us excellent!!! When you guys go to bjs try out the the Strawberry Splash drink, loved it."
Robert R.,"Grand Terrace, CA",11,7,,1.0,6/12/2017,Crappy service dry pizza and waitress sittin on the job while are drinks are empty ...will never stop there
Jessica R.,"Lincoln Village West, Lincoln Village West, CA",44,3,,1.0,11/29/2017,"This is only because of the horrible service at the bar...usually come in for a quick lunch and have exceptional service but unfortunately with our waitress Kelly, we did not. First of all sat for a while until we even got our menus and then when we were ordering my hubby changed his order during the ordering process, Kelley got really huffy and puffy...mind you she was still taking my order. Never brought our silverware, cleared our dishes, checked in to see how we were. We had to flag her down for our check and ask another waitress to run our card because she was busy flirting with the group of men behind us laughing and flipping her hair. Never received our to go dish because we had to leave and couldn't wait for her to finally acknowledge us. With us we got sour looks and an inconvenienced attitude. If your a group of men hey look for kelly I'm sure she will be a barrel of laughs, but if your a couple, family or woman steer clear from Kelly at the bar"
Gregory S.,"Lodi, CA",34,127,16,1.0,3/13/2017,"I normally do not write reviews of chain restaurants but BJs is such a hit and miss chain, I feel obligated to name the good, bad, and ugly. Stockton falls in the bad category. Restaurant was half full. Service was slow at best. Our waitperson simply vanished. The flat bread was crisp around the edges and soggy in the middle. We ordered a nice triple chocolate dessert. However the person who brought it tossed it on our table as he walked by. I caught it before it ended up on the floor. We will not be back."
Misty B.,"Stockton, CA",0,14,90,4.0,4/30/2017,"About those wings and pasta yesterday ummm, although thr waiter forgot about my stuff mushrooms, I respect hrr because when she remembered,  they were on the houseeeee"
Garrett R.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",115,4,,5.0,5/25/2017,"One of the best places in town! Even though it's a chain, it always feels so ""homey"". I've had the pleasure of having both Erica (who is an amazing employee by the way) and Olivia (who has been highly attentive. I've watched it be a packed house and Erica always seems to still make it to me and refill my glass, even with a million other customers to attend to. Olivia has strived to be friendly even when it's clearly a stressful environment. All in all it's an amazing place, and the bar staff is awesome. Check the restaurant out!"
Brandon L.,"Stockton, CA",125,71,103,4.0,2/15/2016,"I think BJ's is always very consistent with the food and service. My personal favorites are the calamari and their thin cut fries!  Sandwiches, pizza, pasta, etc are all tasty no complaints on anything I've ever tried. But I must say the bartenders here are pretty great! The drinks here never disappoint. One of the few places I can depend on for consistent bartending. I can't remember the name but it seemed like some sort of alcoholic root beer concoction and that became a new favorite of mine. And you can't go wrong with a Long Island! Oh and everyone loves the pizookies. Pretty much a staple.  BJ's is always a good place to go when you can't make up your mind. There's a little bit of everything."
