Marlo V.,"Stockton, CA",28,95,,4.0,7/13/2010,"I just love this place and the food cooked, and the waitresses. And pizookie!!!! (don't go for the triple chocolate thats like instant diabetes or just too damn sweet). It is a nice atmosphere, and there is a bar with about... ehhh four to six flat panel screens conjoined to be one full screen. Often people go at that area for the basketball and football games. The design is nice and good parking on the side and in the back. It can get crowded at nights and they have the high tech devices that will vibrate telling you a table is ready. The longest wait so far as I have encountered during the evening would be a half hour. I'm not sure when this place opened up, but it is still fairly new. BJ's is a nice restaurant and its also a hotspot where people go every or every other night, mainly at the bar. Price, its affordable and the quality of the food is great. The waiters/waitresses (some FINE!) always asks if everythings fine, always keep your glasses filled, etc. Last time I went for my birthday, I had something involving chicken. Forgot what I had but it was really good. But what you should never leave out, is dessert. Pizookie! Basically a warm/hot cookie (often chocolate chip) baked in this baking... pan or whatever straight outta the oven, with cold ice cream on top."
Karla B.,"San Francisco, CA",88,95,63,3.0,6/19/2010,"Took my mom to BJ's for lunch one day during the week. It was freezing cold in there. Anyhow, she had a huge stuffed potato. It had chicken, cheese, and broccoli in it. It was good. I had a chicken and pesto pizza. Most of the pesto was concentrated in one place. I had to spread it around myself. I have had pesto before, but the flavor was a little too overwhelming on this pizza."
Bunny H.,"San Jose, CA",135,279,,4.0,5/19/2010,"Been here once on a Friday for happy hour!!!  Yummy in the tummy!!!! Came about 1 hour before happy hour ended, and damn I was a pig.  I ordered everything on the happy hour menu to eat.  EVERYTHING!!!  No joke!!!   The service was great!!!  My table was full of food!!  And everyone who was around me just stared!  I ate and drank, and ate and drank!!! Then it was half past happy hour and ordered more food. Come time to pay, I was surprised!  The bill was not as I expected; it was much less expensive!  At that time I found out that if you came for happy hour and stayed after and ordered more stuff, it would just carry over.  Meaning that whatever you ordered would still be happy hour price.  That was then, but I don't know now. All I remember is great service, great food, great prices, and a great place!  Yeay!!! happy Hour!!"
Donna T.,"Stockton, CA",6,30,7,4.0,8/24/2010,"I was pretty excited about a BJ's opening in Stockton. I heard about all the hype and went to go see what it was all about for myself. It's a real beautiful restaurant; the walls are covered with rich colored paintings of people harvesting wheat for the brewery. The restaurant is a bit on the romantic side with their sleek black furniture and dim lighting. It just has a great atmosphere overall. Good for date night or dinner with a table full of friends. This is the only place I like to get my thin cut fries, perfectly crispy and nicely salted. I love their specialty pizzas and clam chowder the best. Pizooki is good too, if you can stomach it after a full dinner plate.  I always leave this place full and half the time with leftovers. After many visits I haven't had a complaint about them yet so I guess I'm a fan."
kevin b.,"Tracy, CA",80,113,9,2.0,12/10/2010,I love this chain of restaurants. I don't love this location.  Service and food quality was not good.  I was disappointed and felt like I wasted my time and my money.   Beer is always good!
Darla J.,"Stockton, CA",1,12,,3.0,10/4/2011,"First off, the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful!  My friends and I frequent BJ's for their bar area. A good atmosphere, especially if you are looking to catch a sports game!  Chocolate Chip Pizookie = a good time.  The BJ's in Stockton is a popular spot. Although I must say there has been a few times where my order had been mixed up and others orders had been sent my way. This has happened on three occasions while eating outside of the bar area. I've heard similar complaints from others as well. Overall a good place!"
Paul C.,"Lodi, CA",3,33,3,2.0,5/28/2011,"Second attempt at BJs and no improvement on the first.  If you want to watch the ball game, have a beer or three then this is a great place. We went there for dinner though.  They have lots and lots of servers so the service should be good - right?  While some are trying hard, some servers are very indifferent, and the service just does not happen.  Example - our drinks order (2 sodas, one beer and one glass of wine) took three deliveries! (""We had to open a new bottle of wine"" - seriously??). Food was definitely below average: Rack of ribs - burnt; Roast beef sandwich with wedge fries - fries burnt(!); Angel hair pasta with chicken - pasta overcooked, tiny portion of chicken.  Sliders - they were OK. Definitely over-rated, over priced for what it is.  I would go back - but to try the beer then go somewhere else for dinner!"
David C.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/14/2015,"I generally like BJ's in various locations.  However tonight at this BJ's in Stockton it was consistently poor. After waiting 10 mins after being seated I finally went and asked the hostess if anyone was assigned to my area (even though several employees walked by without even glancing my direction). Finally a server arrived, so I placed my order immediately. A few minutes later she started to put a check on my table before realizing I just ordered from her.  After another 15 mins, the chili and wedge salad arrived. The chili tasted good, but was only lukewarm.  The wedge salad was mediocre at best. I never saw my server again throughout dinner and after waiting another 10-15 mins since finishing eating I finally decided I would just leave $10 to cover the dinner ($9.60 ). While I was at the hostess station getting change for a $20, the server came running with the check. I told her it was the worst service I've ever had there and gave her the $10.  I am a BJ's Rewards member because I usually like their food and service. Not at this location!  I won't be back!"
Josh V.,"Stockton, CA",253,70,11,3.0,1/24/2011,"I make it very clear that I don't like chain restaurants but I have a special bond with BJ's as it used to be my temple of underage drinking. In life they say it's ""all about who you know"" and I knew the people who had access to beer. I feel like I'm snitching but those people don't even work there anymore and that was almost five years ago. If you enjoy alcohol, a fun atmosphere and edible food I'm pretty sure you would like BJ's. I've had many great memories here from what I can remember. I've tried almost everything on the menu and my favorite by far would be the New Orlean's Jambalaya which combines blackened chicken, shrimp and chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce served over rice pilaf. I'd suggest sharing it since it comes in a gigantic portion and because its' a bit pricey, about $15 US dollars.  Besides that I wouldn't come here for dinner as it's more of an appetizer and drinks destination. The staff is usually on top of everything and friendly, accept that one. You know, the one that works at every restaurant. If you come here with a big party be weary that splitting the bill between people here is like trying to split a freaking atom. Not sure if they've fixed that yet but every party I've been to it's always been a major issue. But I will remain a fan of BJ's...isn't every man?"
Danny S.,"Stockton, CA",2,10,,4.0,9/16/2010,"This place has a great atmosphere, this is one of those places where you can have a few drinks and have a great time. I wouldnt expect to come here and have a nice quiet dinner, this is a place for when you need to let lose a little. Everyone here seems to be enjoying themselves so much, that no one pays any attention to what you are doing. However, if you are uptight without a drink and don't want to drink, you might get annoyed by the noise level.  From what I have tried, they have good drinks too. I dont consider myself a lightweight, but after one or two iced teas I was feeling pretty good.  Also, it is not like Chillis in that from when I have been there, there hasnt been some punk kid going up and down the restaraunt on his skate shoes. Man I hate those skate shoes. However, they were very accommodating to my two year old daughter. giving her snacks the entire time. If your baby cries in restaraunts but you want to go out, take them here at 9pm on the weekend, no one will hear a thing. Make it a family event. lol"
Sylvester N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",90,222,42,4.0,8/15/2010,"I like this spot a lot. The plates are usually really filling and flavor packed. Pizzas are a must. Drinks are good. Pizookis are good. Definitely a good hang out spot if you're looking to chill with some buds over some food and sports. They always have every sport on at the bar and around the restaurant. On top of all that, they're the only nice restaurant open late around here! Nothing to complain about here.  Oh and the service is mediocre. I've had good service and pretty slow service."
Chris Y.,"Stockton, CA",3,10,,4.0,8/31/2010,"It's nothing special.  It's just another great chain restaurant.  IMO all of these chain restaurant is pretty much all the same.  The only thing that's significantly different is the atmosphere, but not really.   Their home brew beer is weird tasting, but I acquire a taste for it.  Not to shabby at all.  The best way to start before I enjoy my steak or ribs.  Their portion is a lot larger than most places.   It's comparable/similar to many of the chain restaurants out there, but I keep on coming back to BJ's.  It must have a secret aura...  I'm questioning myself ATM."
Kawaii H.,"Stockton, CA",0,23,,5.0,8/30/2011,"Staff here is excellent.  I first came here with a group of friends, and halfway through my shrimp scampi I found a hair in my dish.  :/  I complained to the manager who took my plate away, gave me a new scampi to-go and didn't charge me at all for it.   The next time I went, I ordered porkchops with some asparagus on the side.  I had no problem with my asparagus, but my waitress said they looked ""sad.""  So she had them prepare another plate of asparagus for me.  Granted, I'm not a fan of asparagus, but I really like how my waitress genuinely cared enough to have a new dish brought. Best service amongst all the other Bj's I've been too.  And their red velvet pizookie is AMAZING."
Aaron B.,"Stockton, CA",206,102,2,4.0,6/24/2012,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is a great place to go whether you want to watch the sports game (go Raiders) or to entertain friends. Their selection of beer is great, they have all different types on tap and bottle, friendly and beautiful waitresses, and great food. You can get anything from a steak, to jumbalaya (my personal favorite) although they are known for their pizza and beer. And they have a healthy part to their menu (which I usually skip right past) This place is a little noisy, usually busy, and a little pricy though but what do you expect from a brewhouse?"
Can C.,"Roseville, CA",17,109,17,4.0,3/7/2011,"Standard BJ's.  Good food, decent service, reasonable prices, nice ambiance.  Our go-to restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday because the free pizookie is a wonderfully delicious perk. My favorites are the Cajun pasta, balsamic chicken, or the French dip sandwich.  All classic American food.  Greasy goodness! Paying for the bill is usually an adventure because it usually comes as one check, and it takes forever to make sure everyone has paid their fair share."
C K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,60,9,4.0,3/16/2013,"The seared ahi tuna salad is great. I highly recommend it if you are looking for something healthy but also filling and flavorful. Their Jeremiah Red ale is one of my favorites. Service was very attentive and the food came out fast and correct, no complaints."
Taylor M.,"Stockton, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/19/2013,"When i first came here right when they opened My family and I had a great experience. Went there recently and I was disappointed. The staff was not that friendly at all like i remember it, and to get my ice tea glass refilled took along time, and to get the food took FOREVER. Literally it was a good hour to get my groups food, and it was not worth the wait. The food here is actually good I will say, but its the service that I find unacceptable."
Michael A.,"Stockton, CA",52,20,10,3.0,11/14/2010,"I'm not really a big fan of the place. I go from time to time to celebrate birthdays or something of that nature. Don't get me wrong food is decent and service is good but its not for me (that's why only three stars) I personally think that the best thing is the chicken wings (appetizer) I haven't found an entee that I just simply love to keep me coming back without celebrating something. The rest of the food is okay to me; pizza, sandwiches, steak, ribs, etc. Not saying don't try the place if you've never been because it might be good to you. Like I said it's not for me. But if you do go you have to try a pizookie! All are good."
Monica L.,"Stockton, CA",27,93,2,3.0,7/15/2010,"I come here usually during happy hour because the prices make me a little happier! I only enjoy the 5 dollar mini pizzas because it's cheap and easy. Other than that, I usually do not come here because A). the service is never consistence( meaning one day I can get a server who does not acknowledge my present, and another day I can get a server who cares)  and  B). the food takes a long time to get out.. I've tried other items besides the pizza such like the chicken and ribs and I would recommend just getting the ribs. The chicken seemed dried when I got it. The clam chowder is a must if you're willing to have some good chowder. I love their bleu cheese dressing & usually have it with the wedge salad :)  This place is more of a place for friends to gather around to watch the game and have some beers, so if you're looking for a place you and your buddies to hang out at... this would be a great place!"
Lisa T.,"San Jose, CA",110,84,674,3.0,3/23/2010,"I prefer going here bc of the space, convenience, and Pizookies.  Just be careful...the floor is very slippery!  I fell at the dining area and bruised my hip and arm real bad!  One of the waitress saw me fall and didn't say or do anything.  Just bc I'm asian?  WTF?   My bf and I usually skip the hostess and go straight to the bar.  I still come back for the Berry Burst Cider and 7 taster set.  Strawberry Confusion and Strawberry Splash are nice drinks for girls.  My bf once ordered A Drink Like That.  Oh man, it was good!        The avocado eggrolls with its heavenly sauce are sooo good.  I recommend the Great Beginnings; it has a little of every appetizer.  The pizzas are good.  I like sweet pig.  Stuffed potatoes of any variety are not too tasty.  Don't EVER order the country fried steak.  GROSS and BURNT!  All the other entrees are mediocre."
