Sean K.,"Lodi, CA",49,76,5,3.0,12/31/2010,"I eat at several different BJ's for lunch. I always enjoy it. Better than a Chili's/Applebee's. It's a chain with good food. Service is always hit or miss.  I will admit that I always have the same meal whenever I go, and that's probably why I like it as much as I do.  Avocado egg rolls.  Santa Fe Salad with the blackened Salmon.  Love that meal."
Susan H.,"Harrisburg, PA",21,70,42,4.0,10/9/2012,"We love it here.  The beer is great (as is the hard cider) and I haven't ordered anything that I didn't like yet.  The service is always really good, particularly the waitress I've had the last 2 times, Casey.  I only wish there were one closer to me!"
Miguel A.,"Stockton, CA",0,1,,3.0,11/10/2012,"""BJ's Restaurant and Brew house"" I really love the pizza from BJ's, but my only complaint is that the waiters sometimes are really slow. For example, they come to get you started with drinks but they do not usually bring them until the food arrives which is ridiculous because the drinks are ready. Let me tell you about the pizza, their menu includes a different variety of pizzas. You can choose between meat and vegetables and you can put as many ingredients as you want. One of my favorites is the BJ's Favorite, but I hate olives so I always replace them with jalapenos because I love spicy food. Another one of my favorites is the chicken BBQ pizza, so delicious which I also add jalapenos. If you love them both, you can also get two of your favorite pizzas in one, awesome right? When I cannot decide which one I want the most, I just get half of the BJ's favorite & half of the chicken BBQ. They also have a different variety of beers, which include their own beers and international beers, so you have plenty of options. I love dark beer, one of my favorites is the nutty brunette; and if you want to explore their beers you can ask to try it. Which is awesome because you try different beers and based on that you can choose which one is the best choice for you. I can say I have had good service at times but it is not consistent. Depending on the waiter that is how your experience is going to go. On my last visit I had such a great waiter, she was checking on us often which I appreciate. Obviously by the end, when my check was ready I gave her a fair tip. I must say depending on the service that is how I based the tip they will receive."
Madeline D.,"Poway, CA",108,156,66,4.0,2/21/2012,"Came here with all the other love birds last night & geez was that a bad idea. Called ahead to tell them we would be there in 30 mins, & they said they would write our name down & to just check in when we got there. Arrived & we were told the wait was 50 mins, but since we called ahead we would wait 30 mins. Ok that's fine I guess. 50 minutes later we had not been seated & so my man went to check on things. They acted shocked we didn't have the pager vibrator thing even though we had asked twice for one since arriving & both times they were out but assured us we would be called  over the speakers. We were then seated promptly since they had clearly forgotten about us. So the start to the evening was a little rough.. BUT we were seated & our server was really friendly & everything we ate was delicious, & I would order it again. Eating healthy here is difficult with many entrees being 1,000+ calories. Here is what I ate & enjoyed: - Seared ahi tuna salad- delicious dressing & lots of tuna!  - Minnestrone soup (sun- tues only) - Stuffed spinach mushrooms"
D.wight L.,"East Bay, CA",497,899,1578,3.0,12/6/2007,"We were passing through town and found out an old buddy was bartending here so we stopped by.  Driving on March Ln. to get to Pacific Ave. was chain restaurant hell or heaven, depends on how you see it.  Probably 30 familiar names ranging from Wendy's to Outback and Carrow's to Spaghetti Factory all within a 2 mile stretch.  Stockton: corporate food capital, USA.  And walking into this fairly new BJ's Brewhouse contributed nothing new to that reputation.  Shiny, cookie cutter of a restaurant, but stylish, like one reviewer already noted, in a Cheesecake factory kind of way. Beers are pretty good, tried the sampler and out of 8, only 2 were below avg.  Food was definitely not bad, a Pot Roast Sandwich looked okay, kinda Carrow's looking, and my Shrimp Pasta was tasty with chunks of bacon, red peppers and burst of parmesan in a creamy sauce.  My only knock on the dish was that the sauce was poured over the pasta not cooked into the sauce, and with the shit load of pasta you got, it just looked really ""cafeteria"". Came on a Sat. night and this place was busy.  An hour wait for a table in the restaurant at 9 pm.  We sat at the bar and even though it was busy there were places to sit.  So, not bad of a place, and it still seems like Stockton's ""hot spot""for now I just wouldn't wait an hour to eat here, that's all."
Crystal O.,"Hayward, CA",12,17,6,4.0,12/13/2010,"3.5 stars I came here with my boyfriend and some friends for his early Birthday get-together on a Sunday night. We came here around 10 ish at night so it wasn't packed at all. There was still enough people there though. I've been here a few times and the food isn't terrible yet not over the top either. Our hostess (which ironically was a friend of mine in highschool) seated us quickly and our server came out within a couple of minutes. I was kinda dumbfounded because she asked us already if we were ready to order just seconds after we opened the menu. We asked for a few minutes, but before she left, she did take our drink orders and came back super quick. When it was time to order, I had the Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich. When I got my food, it looked great. It was super hot too, so I know it wasn't just sitting there for a while. I was super hungry and probably made the food taste better. Haha. After dinner, the server came by and asked him if he was ready for his birthday dessert. He looked surprised and within a few minutes, got his Birthday Pizookie. It didn't feel special as she just came up to our table, lit the candle, said ""Happy Birthday"", and walked away. He was expecting a little song like other chain restaurants. That was a bummer. The Pizookie was awesome though! The atmosphere of the place is nice. Dim lights, flat screen TV's everywhere with one jumbo one at the bar. However, the floor is quite smooth and glossy... So high heeled wearers beware... Where the place is located isn't in a bad spot either. This place is good for the appetizers and I heard the beer too. Maybe not so much for the main course..."
Mindy H.,"Stockton, CA",13,127,40,1.0,9/6/2009,"I don't know if it was an accident that I had a bitch of  waitress bc all the other reviews seem to rave how good and attentive their waiter/tresses were but my god, this girl was a straight up bitch. It was just my boyfriend and I and all we ordered were 2 entrees and 1 drink and a dessert. My boyfriend ordered a chicken fried steak to substitute the mash potatoes with french fries and low and behold, when the food came out, we got mashed potatoes. Food just took forever to come out and the only thing satisfying was my pazookie. She never came by to ask how we were until we had to flag the bitch down to give us a refill. I am usually a very generous tipper, but this bitch didn't get shit.  Even if it's just once incidence, I really don't plan on coming back to this place."
Terry K.,"Stockton, CA",0,310,8,3.0,3/6/2015,"The food and beer is always good here but I feel the prices are a little high, but not bad. Now service here at this BJs can be hit and miss. Any time I have come in when it is slow, the service has always been great...at least in all my experiences. However, when I have visited during the busy part of the day or during special televised sporting events, I've experienced some pretty slow...and I mean sloooooow service...not always, but more often than not. I think one of the best thing about this (and all other BJs that I have been into) is that you can usually order items that have been removed from the menu over the last few years. For example, you can order a full order of brushetta instead of the tiny order that's on the menu...so you get 3-4 times the size for about twice the cost. As a local, I overall like the food and beer here and will return to this restaurant. I just wish management would figure out how to better staff the restaurant during peak hours."
Vaishali J.,"Irvine, CA",79,98,80,4.0,11/30/2012,"One of my staples in Stockton. Love this branch of BJ's. THey are fast and don't usually mess up but they do sometimes and they will fix it for you for free. Customer service is great though if you ever have issues. Happy hour is the best! Mini pizzas and drinks are cheaper! I just love BJ's drinks. It's strong, delicious and yeah it does cost a lot though but worth it!"
Jennifer O.,"Stockton, CA",135,30,,2.0,6/1/2010,"I hate to give a 2/5 stars based on one bad experience..but I'll change once they've improved and I feel that the improvement is sufficient..  I went in yesterday for dinner and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich..I cut it in half and I had one, and my husband decided to take the other..he was literally almost done with his portion when he bit in and felt something hard on his mouth..when he took a closer look, it was a foil top to a container..what type of container..I don't know..we assumed it may be BBQ sauce, but when a manager was called over - she basically told us that she had NO idea how that possibly could have gotten in our foor because the sauce is made from scratch..so..what I gathered from that discussion was that we put the foil in our own food...Yes..it was that sad. So, while I know things happen..it was more of the attitude that we received from the manager, and one of the food runners that turned us off.."
Ryan B.,"Lathrop, CA",6,13,2,3.0,4/27/2012,"First off, great beer!!! But tonight we got 3 cold meals delivered. The manager was very accommodating and fixed the problem. Also took half off each meal. This was the first problem I've had here. Usually great food. Service is always slow but friendly. Very loud in there!"
Anthonye P.,"Richmond, CA",10,11,,3.0,11/18/2012,I went to this BJ's tonight 10/6/12 and the service was really good. Our waiter took great care of us. My girlfriends pasta was a little bland but overall a decent experience .
Marisela P.,"Stockton, CA",5,21,3,4.0,9/12/2014,i absolutely love their pizza here :))))) yum!! The servers are great and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed
Bunny R.,"San Francisco, CA",113,168,50,4.0,12/12/2007,"BJ's is a typical chain with the typical too-much-to-choose-from menu, but it was still yummy.  I've been here three times, twice for dinner, once for a pizookie, and never really had to wait much longer than 15 minutes which makes me very lucky from what I hear (45-90 minute waits on average, are people insane?!). If BJ's only served pizookies, they would still be packed every night of the week.  Their food is good, but the pizookies are their claim to fame IMO (in my opinion).  The chopped salad is good and so is the cheese and tomato pizza.  Good, not fantastic. However, if you're seeking a mind altering experience, come here for the crazily delicious pizookies.  They have several different types of cookie to choose from, I've had the oreo (yummy) and the regular chocolate chip, and OMG, can we say food coma?  Seriously, they're the best thing ever.  Awesome hint: say it's your birthday and you get one for FREE! Minus a star for being a chain and being noisy/chainy, minus a star for so-so food, plus a star for PIZOOKIES!!"
Louis R.,"Stockton, CA",2,1,,1.0,11/24/2011,Half rack of ribs were more like a third rack. 6 inches long x 2 inches is not a half rack. Serve my salad after they brought my entre. Slow. Ribs were tasteless. This is the Stockton BJ's
Maureen G.,"Stockton, CA",896,763,349,3.0,8/28/2011,"Service was great.  My friend Sally and I had a lot of catching up to do and never once did the waitress try to give us the bums rush.  You all know me though, I am not a fan of chain restaurants.  This is where my friend wanted to go and I can't get my way all the time you know. We were greeted warmly the minute we walked in and then shown to a booth which we requested.  I requested the Asian chicken wraps, sounded good at the time.  I'd have to say I did enjoy the wrapsl the assembling of them and dipping them in either a soy based sauce or a hot mustard sauce.  The only thing I had a problem with was the saltiness of the dish.  It's 4 hours later and I'm still  a bit dry in the mouth.   Sally had the chopped chicken salad and really seemed to enjoy it.   My only complaint about the lunch, pricey.  A salad and ice tea $13 bucks and that's not including tip! In my opinion BJ's is a fun place to go and a fine place to eat if you're going to please a friend and it's not your turn to choose.  A-OK."
Jason F.,"Holladay, UT",46,235,119,4.0,12/4/2009,This location is in a crowded shopping area just north of the two shopping malls so parking can be a bit tough sometimes. They have a large open space with lots of TV especially at the bar. The menu has lots of options for just about anyone. The pizzas are the most popular. The food is tastes freshly made and has a good flavor to it and the service is great. On weekends you will probably have to wait. They will give you the standard pager to carry around with you while you wait.  For the geeks who must wait there is a Best Buy right across the street. The desert has the famous Pizookie sure to annihilate and diet in its path of unhealthy destruction. BJs has done a good job of maintaining quality while expanding. We had a good experience and would certainly go back again.
Kaytie C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",43,79,199,4.0,8/24/2010,I remember the first time I came to this restaurant even though they were opened for a while and it has a great atmosphere. There's a bar with stools and a big plasma screen TV for those of you big sports fan out there then this area is just a great fit for you.  I had their Hawaiian pizza it was delicious but I couldn't finish it even though I ordered the smallest size pizza. The menu was pretty pricey based on what you order and the pizza was one of them. The service was great since the waitress and waiter were friendly to customers. It was a great evening with friends.  Inside was nicely decorated and they had several plasma TVs around so that all of the customers would enjoy a great game. I've been coming back a couple of other times and each and every time the service was excellent. One of their famous Pizookie dessert was awesome! It's really to die for if you're the type of person who loves sweets! I like the Pizookie but I'm not used to eat something that sweet but it wouldn't hurt to have it once in a while especially if you have a rough day.  One thing that I dislike is the parking. Every parking space feels like it's compacted. What happens if there's big SUVs and trucks parked next to a small car and who hits who? The small car is most likely gonna get crammed. I just wish parking was better formatted when they did the floor plans.
Amanda O.,"Stockton, CA",4,4,5,1.0,4/1/2010,"BJ's is the worst restaurant in town!!! I've only been there 2 times & both times, the service was lousy & food was uneventful. I prefer Taco Bell. I would get better service  & my food in less than two hours. The wait staff is lousy. When you see people with children less than 5 yrs. old, Hello! They don't have three hours to sit around for their meal. Last time I was there was for a friend's party and I didn't see the waiter once to take our drink order. My husband had to go to the bar to get our drinks. This place should have been the one to close instead of California Pizza Kitchen!!!! I think the only reason why it's still open is because of the bar."
Julia V.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,95,7,4.0,6/22/2010,"There's a pretty long wait to get a table for dinner here because the place gets alot of business. Food is a little pricey, but not outrageous.  And the portions and quality make up for the price.  The food is good without the Macaroni Grill-portioned grease (hey, I love me some Mac Grill but I'd be lying if I said the cup of grease that seaped out of every dish didn't bother me).  So all in all, a good place to go if you don't mind the wait.  I hear there is much more efficient service during lunch."
