Cheeks L.,"Modesto, CA",105,158,16,4.0,10/13/2009,"I can't complain about this place at all. The location in Modesto is a little hairy to get into sometimes, which is a total drag, so it's nice to waltz right in here and hop up at the bar.  I shoot in here about once a week for lunch. Usually a liquid one! *wink and the bartenders are always friendly and accommodating. My beers are refilled in a timely manner, their lunch specials are dirt cheap, and you can't beat the sports.  Definitely a great place to kick back and relax with some good beers and grub."
L M.,"Stockton, CA",0,36,15,3.0,2/26/2014,:( let me just say they don't serve the huge grilled chicken baked potato for dinner only a half baked potato with a soup or salad for lunch!!! Other than that foods ok except my jaw hurts from that rubbery steak but my pomegranate martini mmm best part of dinner and my husband had salmon and rice which I ate most of :) yummy!
Peggy N.,"Antioch, CA",240,324,3,2.0,3/19/2009,"I've been tossing this review around in my mind for two weeks now and just cannot give it anymore than two stars no matter how much I want to. Not even the fact that my son came home on leave from iraq and picked this place as the spot for us all to get together for the evening am I upping the stars. It was underwhelming at best.   After we ate my twins asked me if I was going to Yelp about the place and how many stars I thought I would give.  I told them if I wrote the review right then and there it would be two stars.  They told me that is what they were thinking as well.  My little future yelpers! The service was OK, the drinks were not OK and the food was over priced for ""roadhouse"" style food. No one at the table raved about how great their food was - I mean, my salmon was good, my husbands ribs were good, my twins shared a burger it was good, my son had jambalaya it was good.  You get the idea. Oh, and get this:  we made reservations for 7p, half of our party was on time the other half was running about a half hour late - they went ahead and seated the first five people but told them ""you only get the table until 9pm""   I'm like ""what?""  Is there another party coming in right after us for the remaining hour you are open?  I absolutely understand if you have another group coming in then too bad for us.  But they did not.   How did we know, you ask?  Because we did not leave until 930.  HA! I just found them to be un-accomodating (i.e. they would not substitute wheat bread for the multi grain and when asked if they could split the bill in half we were told no, is that common?)  In today's economy when a party of eleven comes in and drops 400.00 on dinner it's a nice gesture to try to work with the patrons.  From the multitude of empty tables it was quite obvious that business was not booming if you know what I mean!"
Brian R.,"Stockton, CA",17,279,36,3.0,3/25/2012,"Nice place to go, the food is okay but they are so close to being good I give them 3 stars. Good selections but they need a little more flavor across the board."
Caron H.,"Manteca, CA",0,76,,2.0,8/1/2011,"Thought we'd try it out, ordered the meatloaf, waitress said it was good, everyone that orders it, loves it.  Hated it!  I make better meat loaf with the Lipton's onion soup package!  The service was good, though, I just didn't like what I ordered.  Maybe the other items are good, just haven't been back, since there are so many other places to try.  Sorry!"
Robert H.,"Ceres, CA",33,20,18,4.0,6/30/2012,Nice place to stop in and watch the game have a drink. I had the calzone. Great.  I would recommend. It wasn't quite dinner time yet but very friendly staff.
Sheri P.,"Stockton, CA",63,14,11,4.0,1/3/2012,I love BJ's!! They now have a gluten free menu and are always MSG free!!!! They will also serve you the lunch menu even if it's not lunchtime.  I didn't give a 5 because sometimes there is a long wait and sometimes the service is not that great.
Courtney J.,"Lodi, CA",11,10,,4.0,8/2/2010,Friday night happy hour... good drinks and the closest to a good sports bar atmosphere in the area.  A little pricey depending on what you order. 5 stars for the gluten-free friendly rating: Very educated staff!  They have just introduced new menu options and will provide customers with an allergen menu if you mention that you have a food allergy.    The best option is the new gluten free pizza and a couple gluten free beers.
Meghan O.,"Bay Area, CA",0,13,,4.0,9/29/2013,"Went to BJs for a football game and loved the happy hour specials! The food was perfectly portioned and the drinks were delicious. Our server, Stephanie, was super sweet and helpful when we ordered. I'll definitely go back for another happy hour."
Angel G.,"Stockton, CA",43,66,75,3.0,1/24/2012,"I really like this place but at time I would get some poor costumer service.. This one time one of the host rolled her eyes at me when I asked for something and another time one of the waitress told my friend to take his straw out his glass or he mite get cooties... WTF?? She was being serious to.. Who says that kind of stuff? Were adults, so we dont need to be saying that.. Especially while your serving someone."
Jinra I.,"Anaheim, CA",217,281,1,3.0,1/26/2009,"My whole life as an Orange County native, I've been accustomed to occasionally visiting the original BJ's restaurant locations. BJs to me is a decent (but not decadent) pizza place to have a casual time with friends or family in a casual, home-like setting. Not quite fine dining, but almost there. I was surprised to find that the Stockton location is rather refined in comparison. The interior of this new-er BJs is rather fancy and posh (again in comparison to the shabbiness I am accustomed to) and people are dressed accordingly. The bar is actually a bar and not someplace to briefly sit while you're waiting for your table. The only thing about this location I could identify with was the food. (Thank goodness.)  Other than that, this place is okay and one of few options for night life in Stockton."
Nicole C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",502,523,674,5.0,7/21/2009,"Absolutely Love BJ's and yes...I know it is a chain but it is a chain that has helped me through all my pregnancy cravings so we can look past that!  First of all, this location is new and very clean. We usually tend to be around this area on the weekends before the dinner rush starts so we have never actually waited for a table.  We always have terrific service here, so no complaints there. My husband loves the Beer Menu, he tries a new kind of Beer pretty much every time we go.  My favorite things: the buffalo wings- (Major Craving #1) They are crispy and not fatty with thick skin and they drizzle a little blue cheese and hot sauce on them and give you the sides to dip as you like. LOVE THAT, because usually they are just doused with sauce!  I love the Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich with the Seasoned Steak Fries!! Totally tasty!  I have also tried a number of their salads and they are all terrific! Another great comfort food, their huge baked potatoes!! Totally yum!  Last but not least, you must try their deep dish mediterranean pizza! Absolutely fantastic! Our new favorite dish!"
Honey B.,"Oakland, CA",261,240,184,3.0,1/11/2012,"BJ's, you may thank your bisque for the bump up in the ratings. The tuscan tomato bisque is freakin' delicious!!! I only go there for their soup, so you must try it! Everything else is still the same. I gave their new black bean veggie burger a try, but it failed me. I even see that it was short lived and yanked from the menu. Oh well, another one bites the dust at this brewhouse. At least the soup is good....."
Vada K.,"San Francisco, CA",3,35,4,4.0,6/19/2010,This place is great for American food and they have a sampler assortment of beer that my friends seem to enjoy ordering a lot when they go there. (I'm not a beer drinker) They have good mixed drinks as well :D The baked potatoes here are huge!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the tamarind avocado rolls. They are so addictive!   The food is always great! The servers are always friendly and nice. They have flat screens playing sports around the restaurant as well.  You have the option of booth or table or even bar area so yay for groups :)
Pat M.,"Valley Springs, CA",7,10,2,2.0,9/7/2013,"As a former very positive patron of BJ's I'm sorry to say I probably won't revisit this location of BJ's.  yesterday a friend and I arrived at 4:30pm (as noted on our ticket when we checked in w/our member card). We were immediately seated where it only went downhill.  We waited more than 10 minutes before we saw our waitress. She apologized by blaming the hostess for seating us in her section before she was on her shift.  My friend was sitting on the side of the table with a view of the front desk.  Our waitress was seen standing at the front desk chatting for most of the 10 minutes we waited. Well she finally brought our iced teas then took our order.  After more than 30 more minute wait we were brought our food - cold.  The hamburger was cool, bun had begun getting hard and the fries were cold.  After sending it back they prepared fresh plates and delivered them to our table - wrong!  It's now more than 60 minutes since we sat down.  Customers who came in long after we sat down were finished eating, paying their check and leaving.  We still haven't eaten.  They finally brought the condiments to our table so we could fix our hamburgers.  Now, the service went from none to way over the top.  We couldn't finish two bites without being interrupted w/either the manager or waitress stopping by to ask if everything was ok.  We found it hard to have a conversation without bring excessively interrupted.  Yes, the manager did comp our meal but I would have preferred to pay for a decent meal and a nice visit with my friend.  Didn't happen.  Not going back anytime soon. Oh, and we were finally able to leave by 6:30."
Barbara G.,"Lodi, CA",259,310,22,4.0,3/30/2012,Great white pizza is the bomb!!
Jonah S.,"Stockton, CA",70,294,20,3.0,12/19/2010,"The food was pretty ok. I had a burger and enjoyed it. Great flavor but fell apart toward the end. What is great here is the desserts though. My pizookie was really good and my friend enjoyed theirs too. Two other got a different dessert that was also great, but I don't remember what it was. The potatoe bite appetizer thing was eh as my friends didn't finish it. The service also wasn't the greatest. It didn't come around too much towards the end,but once we got the checks it was constantly ""is that ready? Oh no rush."" It was barely eleven and your open for another hour. Plus the place wasn't that busy so it wasn't like they needed the table. I think she asked us that like 5-6 times, some while we were still eating."
Brian N.,"Vista, CA",2,52,,1.0,4/5/2013,"If there was any other place open past 9pm in stockton I would go there.  BJ's is overpriced, and just not that good.  I would probably give the food two stars (the calzone I had there was really bad, and the appetizers that I tried all were bland), but when you end up paying as much as you do it drops it another star.  The pizookie is good, but it takes forever, even when you order it ahead of time, and by that point I just sort of wanted to get out of there."
April M.,"San Francisco, CA",90,511,897,4.0,4/10/2011,Service was outstanding and the size of appetizers is plenty for a meal.  Love all the choices of beers.  Loud energized environment.  Love the mac and cheese with bacon.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were great too.  Salads are generous as are all portions.
Joan T.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,146,10,4.0,10/12/2008,"I've updated BJ's with reviews way too many times for my own good.  But hey, one more couldn't hurt, right?  Right! So what's new?  Oktoberfest Lager and Pumpkin Ale are both on tap from now until the end of November.  While Oktoberfest's finish was too malty for my liking, the rich caramel and fruity berry notes were somewhat enjoyable.  As for the Pumpkin, it was more aroma than taste with strong cinnamon, nutmeg and clove spices.  But with some pumpkin flavor, this ale is exactly what you would expect it to be, which is nice but then sort of disappointing at the same time.   Service is still up to par.  Our waitress was super friendly and really nice every time we asked her for something.  However, all the bartenders were new and female.  What, where the boys at?  Haha, I'm not trying to be sexist, but this was the only time that our pitcher had an unacceptable 2-inch foamy head.  So minus 1 Star for bartender lady with the terrible pour.  Though we made up for it with just one more pitcher [each :) ], she owes me at least 8oz. next time.  Add a plate of chips & salsa to the mix, and that my friend, is how you have a good time in Stockton on a Friday night!"
