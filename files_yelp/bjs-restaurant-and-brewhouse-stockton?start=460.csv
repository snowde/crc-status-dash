Dena C.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/27/2014,On another note from my last review of Arroyos and its terrible service.  I have a great one for BJ's.  The atmosphere was friendly and fun.  We sat in a booth in the bar.  Our waitress was wonderful and attended to our every need.  Needless to say we left a nice tip for her.  The food was fantastic and the Beer was spot on.  I want to thank you for a NICE dinner.  :D
Grace M.,"Boston, MA",695,810,204,2.0,11/8/2010,blah food.  good Porter (beer) that had hints of chocolate and coffee.  that's about it. =8)
Matthew R.,"San Francisco, CA",73,23,5,4.0,11/6/2011,"After a few visit and consistently pleasant experience I was compelled to write this review.  I had the pizza and a cosmo.  Both were good.  It is the atmosphere that gives you a different experience for being in a town like Stockton, that makes it worth coming back to.  The waiters are trained to be attentive.  The decor is similar to what you would get a McCormick and Kuleto at Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco.  The noise level is adequate to make it hip but not noisy.  One of the favs in Stockton."
Alvin R.,"Stockton, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/18/2013,"This is the second time I have had to wait 30 mins for a table. Today was the last straw as it was a Tuesday for my son's birthday. The place was only 1/2 full. The hostesses were clueless.  They were making us wait for one specific table that could seat us, and showed no initiative in putting us in another table. Really disappointed in that there was no manager onsite to help them out as well.  Pathetic!!"
Ashley D.,"Lodi, CA",46,1,,5.0,6/13/2011,"BJ's is the busiest restaurant in stockton. Everyone wants to talk about how the service sucks... You have no idea what WE go through. A lot is expected of us and we give it all we got. The food is great. There is so much to choose from. Large portions... Reasonable prices. And servers that bust their ass to get you what u need. Btw... We're a chain restaurant... Of course it looks like any other bjs! Come to bjs for good food, great service, and a cool down to earth environment. Big screens all over the restaurant. Whatever game u want to watch, just ask! DONE. we work hard and don't deserve some of these reviews."
Janice V.,"San Francisco, CA",369,600,798,3.0,11/13/2010,"Had a double date here last night which I haven't done in a while. My friend told me she wanted to eat here instead of Five Guys but my boyfriend and I already ate at Five Guys earlier. My boyfriend and I just ended up getting dessert. We got seated pretty fast. Our waitress was really nice but she kept saying sorry all the time probably because it was loud since there were a lot of birthday parties going on and she couldn't hear us. Lol. My boyfriend and I got the Pizzokie, the white chocolate macadamia one because that is my favorite! I rarely come to BJ's but I usually go when there is a major game on such as basketball or baseball. I think I should go more often especially at the one in San Bruno because my cousin saw Andres Torres there ;)"
Stephanie T.,"East Bay, CA",279,204,59,3.0,11/16/2010,"When is this place not incredibly packed?  Be prepared to wait a decent amount of time before getting seated.  Service is decent.  The food tastes the same as any other one of their franchises.  Overall, it's meh."
Dasha O.,"San Francisco, CA",1,16,,2.0,12/31/2010,"Got sick after eating here. I had: Calamari, Broccoli cheese soup and steak. Everything tasted kinda ok. But throwing up was not fun. For that kind of money, I will find a better place next time."
Julie Z.,"San Jose, CA",173,306,34,1.0,12/12/2012,overly salty pizza. the great white was such a dissapointment.
Mary S.,"Fremont, CA",23,173,10,4.0,9/20/2011,"I was in town visiting family and friends, and ended up here for dinner. I'm not usually a huge fan of the BJ's chain of restaurants, but I was pleasantly surprised at the attentiveness and service of the entire staff. Noelle was our awesome server, and was patient as can be as we looked over our menus. The food was pretty good, and the wait wasn't too long. She didn't even mind that we stayed for a pretty long time in order to catch up. In all, it was a nice experience."
Sammy M.,"Stockton, CA",9,2,6,4.0,12/18/2011,"Sat at the bar, Had very friendly and attentive Bartender's. Great selection of beer's."
Cat P.,"Honolulu, HI",335,427,323,4.0,12/6/2010,"great food, beers, and service! =D  i don't come here often but usually i'll come with my classmates to celebrate finals, a birthday, or to watch a big game.  the workers are very accommodating, especially with our large groups and drunkenness.  they're really good with splitting the bill and allow you to pay separately, which is a big plus for me since i never have cash and like to pay with my card."
Melissa A.,"Stockton, CA",27,15,,3.0,7/22/2011,"Used to be a regular here, but have not came for awhile. Love the beer and avocado egg rolls. Prices aren't bad and overall experiences aren't bad. Love how this company supports Autism Speaks."
Sheri N.,"San Francisco, CA",180,790,52,5.0,7/11/2011,"friendly and attentive staff.  i was very impressed that the general manager, robert wilson, was on the floor and very interactive with the patrons.  he even served us our dinner, and checked up on us throughout our visit. if i'm ever back in stockton i'd definitely return here."
Karlee D.,"Hercules, CA",962,164,7,2.0,5/27/2008,"O.K. Bj's was O.K. for Stockton. It's a nice alternative to Chili's as far as service, food ...and big T.V.s go. I don't live in Stockton anymore, so Its not a regular option for me.. thank god. I'll stick to San Felipe Grill and Xochi's for my 209 grub."

Ripcurl A.,"Lodi, CA",62,294,46,4.0,4/14/2009,"I've been here several times and every time it's awesome.  Not only is the food great but the atmoshpere is really nice too. The menu selection is huge and the prices are very affordable.  Some of my favorite items are the burger melt, clam chowder bowl, roast beef sandwich, pizza's...and actually just about everything on the menu! The beer is good too, they brew their own here."
Matt L.,"Stockton, CA",7,9,,4.0,8/9/2009,"I've never had a bad experience here. The beers are all good, and every food item I've ordered was good too. Sure, you have to tweak your orders to get exactly what you want, but they've always done it for me with NO problem.  I'm a picky eater, but they always get it right. I want a Cuban burger with turkey burger instead of beef, no cheese. Can I get steamed vegetables instead of french fries? No problem. Can I get a mini buffalo chicken pizza with no ranch dressing, easy cheese and extra buffalo sauce? No problem. Maybe I'm just very polite and they like that,  because they've always accommodated my requests with a smile. And the buffalo chicken pizza? So f'ing good. It's like crack. And the beers are awesome. The Nitwit (which is, unfortunately no longer available) is one of the best beers you'll find within an hour's radius. Perfect.  The only reason they are lacking a fifth star is this: the happy hour rules. In the menu it says happy hour is from 3-7, then from 10-closing. 1/2 price mini pizzas, $2 off apps, and $1 off drinks. Awesome! However, you apparently have to sit in the bar. Nowhere on the menu is this little rule included. So, we sit all 6 of us at a table in the main dining area, order our mini pizzas and drinks, and the tab is full price. If you're going to make the rule that happy hour only applies if you sit in the bar PRINT THAT RULE ON THE MENU. I'm not a mind reader. And I'm not a cheapskate, but that is an awesome happy hour and I don't like feeling duped.  Otherwise, it's a great place to eat, have a drink, watch some sports and just relax."
Ana L.,"Stockton, CA",10,4,1,1.0,6/11/2010,"My first visit here started off bad, I ordered a Pepsi, and 20 minutes later the waitress comes back to say that ran out! How does a popular restaurant run out?! Okay, waited a few months tried the place again, ordered the roasted chicken, to find out they ran out of chicken, come on, sounds like they have an issue with ordering enough food for the place. Beware!  When  you order ask the waitress if they have the item you want!!"
