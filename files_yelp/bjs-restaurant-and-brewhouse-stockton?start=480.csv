Zachary G.,"San Jose, CA",60,43,10,5.0,9/24/2008,"Ok.....This is 5 Stars....as long as you know what you are looking. I mean come on.....we aren't talking about Gary Danko here.  I don't normally rate Chain restaurants on YELP, but it  was a good enough experience I wanted to share it with people.  Earlier in the day I was down near their minor league ballpark and the area was a Little scary.....but up north the area seemed a lot safer.  I was in Stockton to watch a High School Football game and we were looking for a good, fun, clean place to have some appetizers, a drink and watch some sports on t.v. before the game.  BJ'S had all of that!  And during their Happy Hour a lot of their dishes are discounted.  If I'm ever in Stockton again, and I'm looking for a mini pizza, beer and want to watch a game.......this is the place I would go."
Timini H.,"Valley Springs, CA",216,14,1,2.0,12/31/2010,Normally I love this place....but this time when I went the service was awful! We had three different servers who didn't get or orders right...and it took forever to get our drinks...we ended up ordering two drinks at a time so we didn't have to wait..the only good thing about the experience was the food.  The avocado rolls are amazing!
Lucy T.,"Stockton, CA",0,46,2,4.0,6/11/2013,"I don't care much for their food but I love their desserts! Their beignets are so good! Perfect texture, a scoop of ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries. I like them more than the pizookies (which are good too). The avocado eggrolls tasted like eggs and the size poki tuna was small and didn't justify its price. I'll stick to just getting dessert here."
Amanda L.,"Tracy, CA",1,13,,4.0,12/3/2011,UHM YUM! soooo good. I went in a group of 25....yeah god bless that server. the food cam out a fairly decent time and was hot. i was happy with the experience
Byron C.,"Walnut, CA",11,287,,4.0,2/13/2010,"I've been to 4 or 5 bj's and while I like all of them, this one is probably the most underwhelming. It looks cool from the outside and it's got that cool revolving door, but once you get inside the decor is rather mundane. It also needs some updating because the other bj's have a higher proliferation of TV's throughout the restaurant. This is the only Bj's I've been to where over half the seats did not have easy viewing angles to a TV.  As for the food it's just like all the other Bj's. Great selection of food with varying quality. Appetizers are great, but overpriced. Pizza is overrated. Burgers and sandwiches are good, not great.  Pizookie is one of the best desserts you can find in any chain restaurant. What really sets this place apart is the drinks. The root beer here is the best I've ever had, and I don't even like root beer. Best of all it's served in a chilled mug. Last time I came here I think I had at least 4 of them. They have a great selection of their own beers and you can order several small sampler glasses rather than having to choose just one. I haven't tried them all yet but I intend to and the ones I have had so far have been good."
Bk b.,"Brentwood, CA",0,10,,3.0,11/11/2011,"Not bad. We went a couple weeks ago. I had been hesitant. I had heard horror stories about the wait, but we got in pretty fast.  Food was good. I had Salad hubby had Pork chops and the tomato bisque soup. That soup was the bomb! He gave me a taste and had to fight me off. Wanted more, lol. Over all good."
Michele C.,"Tracy, CA",8,65,,3.0,4/13/2009,"The food is quite good, and I like the atmosphere, but for some reason today we ate the food and felt incredibly bloated, shitty, and exhausted after eating there this time.  I have no idea why this randomly happened after my 3rd visit, maybe it was the chefs or food or drinks that were off that day? But boo now it makes me sketchy of coming back. Maybe only for pizookies from now on!"
Mary S.,"Fremont, CA",66,88,,4.0,11/29/2007,"My Grammy turned 90 yesterday. We all jumped in the car to go see her. My Grammy is a funny old broad. We all laughed so hard. It seems like she never ages. Afterwards my sister says let's go to BJ's (insert joke here) it's a new restaurant and brewhouse. We go and it kind of reminds me of The Cheesecake Factory. A little over done but they had some incredible flat screen tvs. (huge) Well, we got seated and it took the waiter some time to even greet us. Minus one star. After that though, everything went smoothly. I order a cosmo (very nicely executed) everyone else orders beers. My brother orders the sampler. They bring you 6 or 7 different beers. And they're not in those tiny shot glasses either, but half the size of a regular glass. I tasted a couple and they were nice. My niece suggests we order a couple of pizzas. A white and a red. Well, I haven't eaten pizza in a long time but I go along with it because she's says they're fantastic. I have a piece of the white.....it has chicken, white sauce and a ton of ooey gooey cheese. I have to say it was pretty damn good. We were a party of 7 and managed to have dinner and a couple drinks each and still got out of there for about $125. (me and the bf usually do that much damage on our own) Like I said above.. minus one star because the server took so long to greet us. Four stars for good grub and good spirits. Yeah it's another chain but it's Stockton. What were you expecting, culture?"
Eric H.,"San Jose, CA",320,516,149,3.0,2/17/2009,"This place is really nice looking. It has some good beers and watching sports at the bar is nice. The beer is at a decent price for the variety and the atmosphere. The service at the bar is very good. This is a nice place to hang out with friends and have a beer. However, the food is mediocre especially at the prices they charge. And the service is definitely sub-par when sitting at a table instead of the bar. The one thing that brought this place down was their reservation system. We called ahead to make reservations for a party of 9 and were told they only do reservations for a party of 10 or more. We asked if it would help if we called back and said there were 10 of us to make the reservation. We finally had to talk to a manager to get the reservation put through.  Besides that the place is OK. Again a nice atmosphere for friends to gather in and have a lite snack and a cold drink.  Not so much for a family party of 9 trying to make sure they have a seat when they get there."
Nicole N.,"San Jose, CA",47,55,6,4.0,3/4/2011,"This BJ's is like any other BJ's. However, I came here on the first day it was opened! Funny thing was that I got to know the manager here really well. He recognized me because I'd order food to-go and pick it up right before the restaurant closes. Then, when I went home for one weekend, back in San Jose, I went to the BJ's in Cupertino. I saw the same manager there! He recognized me, too! And I could have sworn he was stalking me! Little did I know, he was transferred from the Cupertino store to the one in Stockton! What a small world. People are nice. Parking is easy. I definitely prefer BJ's over the Elephant Bar. Great place to eat at!"
Lisa S.,"Stockton, CA",34,8,,4.0,4/22/2009,"Their food is almost always great. Everything I've tried so far has been wonderful. The only downside is sometimes I've had to send something back, but they always fix it and make it what I want. I love their burgers, and you can order them rare. (It comes out med-rare, but most places won't cook it rare.) Make sure you get the wedge-cut fries, they're delicious with some ranch! I wouldn't suggest some of the outlandish over the top pizzas. There's just too much stuff on them and it gets soggy and weird.  Their beer selection is awesome and the servers will help you pick out something that will go with your food. They also have a taster set of their beers so you can see what you like. They have some pretty cool cocktails as well. My favorite is the espresso-tini. (sp?)  It's a fun place to go with friends and watch some games or just hang."
Katie L.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",85,376,20,5.0,2/9/2011,"I didnt eat real food, just the pazooki! it was AMAZING. I make them at home now, not quite the same but close enough!"
Nesto J.,"Stockton, CA",125,91,79,2.0,9/2/2008,"The food here is not that good. I have come back for the pizza which I don't have often. I get the BJs Favorite cuz I love the roma tomatoes on it but thats about it except maybe a burger and the santa fe spring rolls. Trust me, we've gone here multiple times and all ordered different things and love to eat off eachother's plates. Unfortunately here, I don't have the urge to steal anyone's plate. Its a hip place for the young early 20s crowd, bar area is semi-large and always packed. If you're looking at a place to hang out and drink alcohol and eat mediocre food, go for it. Its one more chain for us that I don't really care for along with the new Elephant Bar. Its torture I tell you."
Minnie M.,"Stockton, CA",114,20,1,4.0,7/21/2011,"Love this place. My man and I go here all the time for dinner or just dessert; either way, they don't give you snotty looks for just ordering a small meal. Servers are really nice. Pizookie is heaven on earth for dessert and for a filling appetizer, order Best Beginnings. Gooooood stuff. Great place to be in, great place to eat."
Dustin B.,"Bellflower, CA",82,213,23,4.0,2/4/2011,"Finally this experience was how it should be. Had a great meal a very sweet waitress who was super nice even though she was being run ragged. (her awesomeness was only matched by her cuteness which doesn't hurt). Wifey and I had some great food delivered to us. Crispy potato skins were super yummy, California chicken sandwich was major yum, wife loved her hand breaded chicken  parmigiana and to drink we loved our Irish RootBeer Tipsy Yum. To end it all we split the awesome pazookie. How can you go wrong with a big cookie nice and warm with ice cream on top? The perfect dinner."
Gina N.,"Castro Valley, CA",104,418,3431,2.0,3/25/2008,"Stockton's version of Gordon Biersch. Although the restaurant itself was nice & clean, I was not at all impressed with the food, as expected from any chain restaurant. The BFF took me here for lunch. She had the sesame chicken salad, which she enjoyed, I had a bite, and thought it was pretty good, but not the best i've had. I had the turkey cobb. The waitress asked if I wanted the lunch-sized version (which was half a sandwich), and i'm glad i did, bc i couldn't even finish the half i got. It definitely sounded a lot better on the menu. It was supposed to be on garlic-toasted french bread, but instead the bread was slightly soggy with no hint of garlic. It actually tasted like a plain turkey sandwich with avocado (that I could have easily made at home, but mine would taste a lot better). The turkey meat was salty and tasted like the oscar meyers ones you get at the grocery store.  I specifically asked for light sauce, but of course it was drenched in bleu cheese dressing. The side of fries were good though and the service wasn't so bad. I probably would only come here for drinks, not the food."
Luke B.,"Oakland, CA",213,211,10,4.0,2/20/2011,Great place to grab a beer & burger with a group of friends. Not overly loud but still has a feistive vibe.
Julie T.,"Ripon, CA",3,17,12,4.0,5/29/2010,"So, I had lunch here with my little sister. I've been wanting to take her since the last time I saw it from the inside of SF Boudin. She hasn't been to BJ's before, but I have (twice at Modesto's BJs and once in Torrance, CA). It was a Saturday and only 12:30pm. Parking was close and easy on this day. We walked in and were quickly seated. She ordered the Grilled Chicken Club ($9.50) and I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken ($12.50). The Service: One thing I found weird once we were seated by the person who takes us to our seat, she offered us both the drinks menu and was explaining it to the BOTH of us. Keep in mind that my little sister is only 15 yrs old, though I am the drinking age. The waitress service was great at first. Quick and friendly. While we were talking and waiting for our order, our waitress SARAH, checked in on us to make sure things were okay. Once we got our food, the service went downhill and rushed. She refilled our diet coke a bit prematurely (it was only half way; and on the second cup, it was only drunken 10%. We didn't get charged for it, but wasting food and drinks is a peeve of mine.) Second, the waitress was asking a little too many times if everything was doing okay. I know its nice to be checked in, but not sooo many times while you're eating and have food in your mouth. While we were about 40% into our meals, the waitress asked if we wanted dessert. 5 mins. later, gave me the check. Then came back a few mins. later to offer a box for our foods and pick up the payment. When she came back after swiping my card, she quickly collected the dishes. Sure, some people may like this type of service, but I felt really rushed when I wanted to just enjoy my meal in peace and take all the time I wanted. The place was not packed, probably only 40%-50% filled. Food: I knew what i was going to expect with the food, as I've ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken before. It was delicious! I had left overs and ate it when I was home.... i want more! Trust me... not a lot of food has made me weak and crave for it like this. Yum! The chicken, the mashed potatoes, the steamed broccoli. Mmm! My sister enjoyed her Grilled Chicken Club really well too. and she liked the thin fries a lot. The food is great, if you can get past the prices. The service could DEFINITELY be improved. For reference: went on 05/29/2010"
Linda C.,"Lodi, CA",9,45,2,1.0,6/17/2012,"Not only did we have to wait over 30 minutes for our food but when it came two if the dishes were prepared wrong and one was cold.  We asked to see a manager, he made excuses, ended up comping some if the dishes...we would rather have paid in full, served good food and received good service!  Instead we got neither!!!"
Michele M.,"Los Angeles, CA",236,158,134,4.0,12/29/2008,"I debated whether to give 3 or 4 stars because my Tomato Bisque soup and BJ's amber beer was INCREDIBLY good but the service suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked! I decided 4 stars. Appropriate for the food, beer, ambiance, comfy booths, big screen tv's, and my friends said the last one they hit up in a different town had EXCELLENT service. And my friend Tara, she is a food service extraordinaire! She knows her sh!t! I know I know, I only had the tomato soup and a beer! But my friends' salad and her boyfriends' turkey burger looked amazing as well so until I visit another BJ's, my stars stand. Oh, and another thing I thought was interesting/different/enlightening/cool was they had a page in their menu that paired beers they served with different dishes... I like pairings. I like anything that let's me think less. I love lamp :)"
