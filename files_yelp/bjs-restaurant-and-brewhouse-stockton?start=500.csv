B W.,"San Antonio, TX",1,23,,5.0,6/6/2009,"We go to this place more often than anywhere. I highly recommend the Cilantro Pesto Pizza and Santa Fe Spring rolls for appetizers. Recommended Entree's: Any pizza/calzone and the the cobb salad's are great. The ribs were ok, the baked potatos are just ok too. One of the best beer selections at any stockton location, I prefer this beer over Valley Brewery. To top it all off the wait staff is batting damn near 1000.00%. I cant think of anytime my order was messed up. All of the servers/bartenders that I have encountered have been good at their jobs and friendly except for one or two which I dont see very often. For casual but nice dining this is the best place to eat in Stockton."
Clarisse C.,"Hayward, CA",196,338,68,3.0,1/10/2009,"We surprised my dad his weekend for his 64th birthday. We decided to celebrate early since we couldn't make it out to Stockton during the week. He typically doesn't like to eat out or chooses a Chinese buffet or Sizzler's. It would've been good to try something new and I only wish it was a bit better so that he'd be more inclined to eat out at new restaurants. They DO have a handicap ramp which is always a plus, but you have to go through a bunch of tables to get to it. We waited quite awhile for our food...even just to order it and by that point everyone was starving.  Service was super slow. Food was good as usual, but you know the whole ambiance counts too. We were lucky enough to have them store a cake in the back and bring it out with a candle (no service charge thank goodness). So that was nice. =)"
jamie b.,"San Francisco, CA",24,115,2,4.0,12/19/2008,"I have dined here once... and ironically my parents dined right before me. and on their receipt there was an offer that if you go their website and rate the experience they could get a code for a free appetizer on their return visit. lucky for me, i was the return visit. the free appetizer was supposed to be bruschetta, but the server said we could use it on anything. so we got the potstickers. the potstickers were pretty standard, i'm sure they weren't made fresh, but they were hot and they tasted yummy. for my main entree i got the french dip or whatever is the equivalent of it, it could be some sort of steak sandwich with au jus. when i lived in monterey, i used to order a french dip from one restaurant regularly and oh how i have missed that sandwich. this is the first time in years that i have had something that came close. so i was happy with my sandwich. my friend ordered a salad and it appeared to be a large portion. i'm not sure i would have been satisfied with it, but that's because i was craving a sandwich and fries. BJs is a chain restaurant, so i take it for what it is... it's an establishment that needs to crank out the same level of food as it's brother and sister restaurants. if you can walk in there with that understanding, then the food there is yummy. I would return and this time i need to save room for the pizzuki."
Tee w.,"Oakland, CA",58,168,4,3.0,1/28/2009,"My first time at this location was on a Friday night, which I hope I will remember to do call ahead seating next time, because the wait was super long!  I got a Mediterranean chicken pizza and it was good! Don't know if the strawberry lemonade was a bad batch overall but it was sour! The service was not all that great~ It doesn't matter if it is Friday or not, the waitress should do a good job!  CAUTION: The Jambalaya is extremely HOT and SPICY!"
Alicia H.,"Tracy, CA",558,11,,5.0,3/10/2011,"Rootbeer is off the hook!! Food is great, service is great! My fav restaurant in Stockton, for steaks & drinks!"
Monica M.,"Eatontown, NJ",144,12,5,4.0,5/9/2010,"I was looking for a place to celebrate my birthday that was comparable for a party of 20 and we chose BJs restaurant in Stockton. Before arriving at BJs I read some of the criticisms on yelp and again i have to say that in my opinion some people are just unhappy eaters.Bjs was very enjoyable, reasonably priced and the service was great."
Cindi M.,"Stockton, CA",21,27,6,4.0,5/1/2012,"Above average chain restaurant / sports bar.  Great for bringing noisy kids because they place is so loud, nobody can hear them screaming.  Some stuff I love, others not so much.  Portions vary from huge to tiny, like put in a wide, yet very shallow bowl to appear large, such as their soups - as to create the perception that they're huge.  Typical college-aged servers, which is what you expect in a place like this.  Of the 20+ times I've eaten here, twice at dinner we've had apps comped because they either came out with or even after entrées arrived.  Good place to grab a beer and hang with the fam.  My fav is the BBQ chicken salad.  I needed a good replacement after CPK closed down the road, and this does the job just fine."
Christopher P.,"Woodland, CA",531,7,7,1.0,9/13/2009,"This place IS played out. The waitress was a bitch. Ugly tone and negative body language. Always with a pissed off face. I mean, if you're having a bad day you better fake it if you're a waitress. The Fettucine Chicken Alfredo was disgusting. The chicken was burnt and dry. Couldn't even taste the herbs that were on it. Just dry blandness. The last time I went there I had the chardonnay pasta with shrimp. That was flavorless too. The avocado egg rolls are way over powering.  I'm really not a picky eater, but damn. Gross food. Also the pizookies are diabetically sweet. My friend asks for a refill on water then no water comes back. Hella flagging her down and what not. God! It's water! It's all bad. Go if you truly are a dumpster for food cuz that's how bad their food is."
Andrew F.,"Stockton, CA",113,92,10,3.0,11/16/2010,Food is always good but not great. The piranha pale ale is outstanding! Service is spotty at best. Even when not busy the service can be lacking. Great place for s group because it can get very loud! Kids enjoy themselves and there is a menu large enough that anyone can find something to enjoy.
Tom G.,"Stockton, CA",52,109,8,1.0,11/5/2011,"BJ's, I've given you far too many chances, and last night may very well have been your last. Last night after I had already eaten, I was invited to join some friends here. I decided to get a drink and some small munchies and join in the festivities. By the time I arrived, my friends had been there for over 20 minutes with barely a drink order being taken. Not that I am squeamish about such things, but a fork in my allegedly clean silverware service had a large piece of greenery that had been been a part of another guests meal, not cool BJ's. The kicker came at the end, they were unwilling to split the check so we could pay with individual cards. After about forty minutes of back and forth we firmly insisted that they either split things up or not get paid. Why couldn't that have been done from the start? The waitstaff here seems exceptionally demoralized, which leads me to believe that BJ's sent their worst manager here so as not to contaminate other locations. Only an a-hole manager would run a place like this."
Ndub C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,68,16,3.0,8/8/2010,"Comfort food, definitely full of greasy flavor."
Jon T.,"Sacramento, CA",47,27,,4.0,10/27/2010,My favorite casual dine- in restaurant.  Generous portions for a resonable price!  Good quality food also!
Ruth C.,"Washington, DC",3104,2261,7499,3.0,10/15/2007,"Ample parking, average service.  Gets fairly busy around weekends, probably since it's fairly new still.  Don't get their burgers unless you're looking for a bastardized version of In-n-Out, and unfortunately for their array of Pepsi products, their homebrewed root beer is the nonalcoholic drink of choice.  Their pastas and personal pizzas come recommended by word of mouth, but the next time I come back I'll be getting the pot roast sandwich even if it tastes so heavy and unhealthy.  Their pizookies, little cookies in pizza pans topped with scoops of ice cream, are two-hour sugar rushes waiting to happen."
Ana D.,"Lathrop, CA",6,68,,3.0,11/10/2010,"Bj's restaurant is definitely the spot to hang out with your friends and try new and different beers. Their food was pretty good. I had their chicken sandwich on one occasion and their salad on another.  I would recommend to go during the middle of the day since it is not as packed as happy hour is. It is definitely not a spot for children, really considering they don't have a kids menu. Their service was okay, but not extraordinary."
Elle L.,"Stockton, CA",3,21,,5.0,9/16/2007,"This restaurant is so new... I can't find the physical address anywhere.  Located at the crossroads of streets listed above -- it is the first of several new restaurants slated to open.  This was my first visit to any of this chain's locations, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  First, this was a sort of ""soft"" opening, by invitation only; with brand new staff in training alongside more seasoned staff from other locations.  This did not present any issues, everyone was very friendly and seemingly excited to be of service.  Always a big plus in my book. Secondly, this opening was presented as a benefit for a local charity - Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  All meals were comped by BJ's, and diner's were requested to make a donation to the Charity.  Tips were collected separately AND also donated to CFF.  We paid only for gratuities and drinks.  What a pleasant, win-win way to enter a new marketplace. Speaking of drinks!  We sampled a full flight of their handcrafted brews and I found my newest favorite -- Nutty Brewnette.  Totally delish and never bitter - even at it's warmest end.   I ordered the Scampi Pasta, and sampled the friend's selections; Meat Loaf, Chicken Salad, and giant Stuffed Potato.  All tasted very good, and all were presented very nicely.   We were also served their choice of appetizer, Mozzarella Sticks; and dessert, BJ'S Famous Pizookie.  Will I be back - definitely..."
Elizabeth R.,"Stockton, CA",3,8,,4.0,11/12/2009,"I love going out there during Happy Hour, we get to choose booth & catch up with friends before going to our monthly meeting for our non profit organization serving deaf & hard of hearing. The foods & prices are just right for our budget!"
Fanny Z.,"Pismo Beach, CA",85,112,256,3.0,7/5/2009,"Came here today at around 7pm and there wasn't very many people. I guess people BBQ on their own on the 4th of July. Anyway, we got seated and ordered our food. The menu didn't really have my kind of food on it. I don't want to eat pizza or stuffed potatoes at a restaurant. So, I got a California Burger and it was quite good actually. The meat patty was delicious along with the roasted chili peppers. My potato wedges were hot too. I enjoyed my meal, but I'm not sure about my friends. The waiter service wasn't very good in my opinion. Our waitress seemed a bit annoyed, and I saw a couple that waited forever for their food. So, if you like burgers, pizza, pasta and stuffed potatoes here's the place the go. Haha..."
Josephine N.,"San Francisco, CA",9,57,,3.0,7/23/2008,"I have gone to BJ's several times. For Stockton, it's pretty good. However, the food is often times very bland and the portions are small. The service is very slow and it is very difficult to track them down for anything!  Sadly one of my friend's boyfriends does work there so I must give them some credit. However, I have even told him this before that the place needs to hire more workers and better chefs. He told me that most food is assembled by the servers and not by the chefs. The drinks are good which is a plus. The bar is a very popular place."
Jorge D.,"San Jose, CA",320,108,18,5.0,5/4/2008,"Mmmmm Mmmmm Good! Is all I can say about BJ's! That's why it's always Packed! With at least an 45 minute wait everytime I go. Arrive a bit early head to the huge bar area have a drink, wait for our table. Sit, Order the thin sliced pizza as a appetizer! Yummy! I've had some pasta and the stuffed Alfredo potato! It's a super huge potato with loads of broccoli, cheese, chicken, and Alfredo sauce! Great place with friends, family, and maybe even a casual date. All my service there has been great not stumples yet :)"
Aaron I.,"Stockton, CA",2,39,,4.0,10/5/2009,I've always had good luck with all the sandwiches and burgers I've had here.  I'm not a big fan of their pizzas since they tend to be mostly dough.  I like their house pale ale beer.  The big downside here is that there is almost always a big line to get in.
