Dave R.,"Stockton, CA",14,44,,2.0,6/8/2009,"When BJ's opened, and for the next four or five months, I'd see dozens of people waiting outside braving sweltering Stockton summer heat for a chance to get inside and experience BJ's.  ""What do they have inside?"" I wondered.  ""What could possibly be so magnetic that all these people can't resist it, no matter what the weather?"" I've been inside twice now. And I've yet to discover the attraction. The food isn't bad, but it's basic and common to any TGIFriday, Chiles, Outback, etc. I've had the beer sampler -- liked some, didn't like others.  Certainly didn't like any of them enough to forego a quick cold beer fix from a supermarket or liquor store to come wait here for a drink. The service is certainly nothing about which to write rave reviews -- not that it's bad, it's just ... serviceable. In short, I don't get it. It's okay -- maybe 2.5 stars. But I doubt that I'll be beating a path to BJ's door anytime soon."
Kevin A.,"Junction City, KS",28,14,8,2.0,12/28/2011,"Alright... Going to be a little harsh here folks, so bare with me. We were a party of 4 and we're seated quickly, Waiter's service ties with the rating.. (Yes, Two stars). She presented the ""Recommended Beverage"" and my cousin order an ale, she asked for ID and he presented his New Jersey ID being a New jersey Resident, she had to ask her managers about it, which was weird cause it hasn't happened to him before, We ordered our meals, She took it very complicated, All we ordered was a Burger,Appetizer, Jambalaya, and Fries with Melted Cheese on top, no seriously that was all. I understand the rush of many orders.. but C'mon... Its pretty simple. Food was good, Expect for the fries. The cheese was melted... but it hardened and when the waiter came back, We asked her, ""Can we have melted cheese on the side?"" She then replied, ""Oh, We don't serve that."" Would've been nice if we knew that before... Almost finished with my meal, Waiter asked,"" May i take your plate?"" I said yes, and hungry for one more single fry... i said ""Wait, hold on."" grabbed one and then let the waiter continue, My cousin noticed that she rolled her eyes... Seriously.. if you try their thin cut fries, there isn't such thing as grabbing one. Expected much more from BJ's to be honest."
JM O.,"Stockton, CA",5,17,,3.0,8/1/2008,"I like to go here and eat their deep dish pizza's, well that, and I really like the crust on those things, so delicious ! Anyways I ate there yesterday with my cousin, it was okay. I mean, I remember more about the conversation I had with my cousin then what I ate. I mean I think it tasted good. & I can't even remember the waitress's face.  So I say this place was okay nothing too special, except for the pizza crust ;D"
Dodi E.,"Manteca, CA",49,24,10,4.0,11/12/2009,I absolutely love their beer!  And their sesame cabbage salad.  Yum!  During happy hour you can get a mini pizza for half price.  Can't beat that!  Their triple chocolate pizookie is out of this world!  Addicting!
Cristina D.,"Hayward, CA",34,124,12,4.0,11/28/2009,"I usually come here just for beer. Food is a little expensive for what it is. Get a mini deep dish pizza, a beer, and an oreo pizookie and it's already about $25. It sure tastes good though! Love the tatonka stout and the oreo pizookie, they're a great combination!!"
Rafael L.,"Sacramento, CA",15,90,1,3.0,2/3/2008,"I first saw BJ's Brewhouse in Elk Grove and the ""BrewHouse"" caught my eye.  So when I saw them in Stockton we went and checked it out.   The best part of the evening was the hour we spent talking to a couple we met while waiting to be seated.    They have a pizza take out counter off to the side so I thought I'd give the deep dish pizza a try.  Take my word for it, stay away from the pizza. The chicken pot stickers for starters were great, definitely give them a try. The atmosphere is nice and they have a nice bar area, although it was pretty crowded with everyone packed in there like sardines.   Everyone was very nice and service was good, our waitress left halfway through because her shift was over, but we didn't mind.    I just went to Uno Chicago Grill last week and now that I think about it this place is similar.  Both places are very nice, less than a year old, both have deep dish pizza, and a lot of other selections on the menu, and both have big screen TV's through out the place.  Not a bad place to hang out and have lunch or dinner at. I gave this place a  3 instead of a 4 like UNO because I didn't like the pizza at all, UNO's was actually a little better even though I've decided deep dish pizza is not for me.  At least until I find one that really stands out anyway."
Lauren w.,"Galt, CA",0,23,12,1.0,3/16/2012,"I just ate here tonight, had the worst service ever, they took our order, served everyone else's food at the table except mine and my boyfriends and then came back 5 minutes later to finally tell us they were out of what we ordered and that if we hurried we could order something else but it had to be fast. We ordered something else and it took forever! We had to pay for that by the way!! We asked if we could have a free pitcher for the mess up, our waiter comes back with exact words FROM THE MANAGER ""that ain't happin"" and laughs in our waiters face.  Nice to know Bj's of Stockton is being managed by trailer trash... Just to be clear of the message that I'm trying to get across here, the server should have known when putting our order in that they were out of what we wanted, not serve the whole table their food and make us wait. Also if the pitcher couldn't be complimentary fine whatever, as a freaking manager of a business you do not talk that way in front of the actual guests you're talking about! I'm sure anyone in the food industry would agree that's not the way to treat paying customers. Right?"
Mercedes G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",156,59,,3.0,4/18/2009,"Let me just say - I do not like BJ's (I group them in with crappy chain restaurants; Chili's, Applebee's, Red Lobster, etc. All of which I hate with a fiery passion.)...and unless they get better food, better service, and lower prices, I probably never will. And yet I continue to go back. Probably because I go with friends who have been brainwashed into thinking they have good food since pretty much everything else in Stockton sucks, too. (I realize BJ's isn't only in Stockton, but that's the only one I go to, hence the review for the Stockton store.) No lie, every time I go in here, I get the crappiest of service. The servers are jerks and take forever doing the tiniest of things. (I really don't think I should even HAVE to ask for a refill, but whatever.) Anyway, I went in the other night, ordered a LEMON DROP, got some raspberry crap. Then I ordered the ""buffalo wings"" and they were barely drizzled with buffalo sauce...gross. Went a couple days later, got the most dry turkey sandwich in existence with some cheap sliced meat. So my explanation of 3 stars instead of 1 or 2? They have amazing minestrone soup and a BOMB ASS pazookie (which I can still complain about; I hate that they put it aluminum because when you hit the bottom with the spoon, it gets that metallic taste - yuck!). Bottom line - if another friend wants to meet here for lunch, I'll fight tooth & nail for something else (*ahem* Señor Frog's), and if I want a pazookie, I'll get it to go."
Justin F.,"Houston, TX",19,119,15,4.0,2/28/2009,"A very cool atmosphere, nicely designed.  Brewery food done with a nice twist.  Great burgers, and the loaded potatoes are pretty good!  Had the Brew House Sampler last time there with my Fiance, pretty good beers and affordable.  Definitely give it a try if you go!  The white chocolate macadamia nut pizzookie is BOMB!!"
Fay O.,"Manteca, CA",8,18,,1.0,6/20/2008,"We went there 3 times, the beer is the best, the chocolate raspberry is #!. As far as service I think they are still working out the kinks.  When we called ahead reservations, they said no wait at 530 but it took quite a while to get seated and served, we didn't get out until 830!   The food is not worth that long of a wait.  There were 3 of us on a Friday night, 2 ordered the ribs, after 30 minutes our waiter came back to tell us they had run out of ribs, our 3rd persons food came a few minutes after that and we hadn't even ordered yet!  Oh yeah if you order an entree salad, tell them hold the hair!  We were offered a dessert on the house for that one."
Just In Time S.,"Stockton, CA",39,109,42,2.0,8/22/2010,"went here this morning for brunch. the bloody mary was the star of the table. my :) Had a breakfast pizza that was soggy and sucky. I had grilld chicken fet. fet was dry. not creamy and not enuf pepper, wouldn b a problem xcept I hada openthe peppr shaker to get enuf pepper. chicken wasnt 2 dry but needed more moisture. I wont be doing this again sun morn."
David R.,"Omaha, NE",2,58,,4.0,11/14/2011,"I've been to B.J.'s 4 times in the past 2 weeks here and in West Covina and have become a big fan.  There's enough on the menu to satisfy anyone's taste in either food or drink and it was all good stuff.  The roast beef sandwich satisfied our pickiest eater and the fancier fair was solid.  The small appetizer portions (especially the spinich stuffed mushrooms) were excellent.  They have a very strange rotation on their servers, which did create confusion and the servers were apologetic about it (hey managers, when servers don't like the way you have it set up and it's costing them $$$, change it!!)."
Xelyn x.,"Northern, CA",36,126,3,3.0,4/17/2008,"I'm really bored right now which is why I'm even attempting to write a review on this place. C'mon, haven't you been to BJ's already? There's really no need to review. The one here in Stockton is clean, noisy, has decent food, and good service. I mean, really, how can you go wrong with vanilla? Everyone like vanilla. Vanilla is the universally accepted flavour. Don't give me sh*t about my vanilla Weston Ranch home in foreclosure central, in my vanilla neighborhood. OH WAIT *looks around*....actually it's not really that vanilla. When temperatures reach triple digits in the valley, go to BJ's and take advantage of their air conditioning and refreshing beer selection."
Melissa P.,"Manteca, CA",146,18,3,2.0,7/9/2008,"This one is sure lacking. Smaller than other locations but should that really be a big deal? I guess not but the service, boo. I don't recommend going in big parties. Food comes out at different times and sometimes, not at all. The experience is better in the bar area. Food, aside from appetizers and pizzas, are mediocre but the beers ROCK!!"
rafael m.,"Burbank, CA",0,10,,4.0,12/8/2011,There food is good I never wait along time for a table. The service is good. I recommend the pizza or the fish and chips. Also there weekend brunch is great especially the French toast.
Pickle R.,"San Francisco, CA",329,741,69,4.0,3/7/2010,"once again sat and ordered at the bar, i got the sourdough burger with wedge fries, service was excellent by the female bartender during friday lunch hour."
. ..,"Livermore, CA",9,156,5,2.0,9/5/2008,"This place just screams ""Please college kids, come to get plastered! We're here for you!"" Given that I've left that scene years ago, the atmosphere here can get pretty freakin' annoying. The one good thing I will say about it is that they've got some kick-arse rootbeer that they brew themselves. Their beer selection's decent, but the service generally isn't so great. Prepare to wait at every step of the game. Think of this as a more upscale TGI Friday's. And it's ALWAYS crowded. I recommend the jambalaya and the pizzookie desserts are pretty good too. Just ignore the college fracas and you'll be okay. Definitely come here before you're starving to death or you will be a rampaging hunger hunter by the time you're seated. I'm good to come here once or twice a year."
Pat B.,"Tracy, CA",10,2,,1.0,7/1/2013,"First and last time at the Stockton BJ's.  Horrible food and service.  When we arrived it was empty, our ""waitress"" took our drinks order and took a good 15 minutes for them to arrive.  Then we order food, I had the baby back pork ribs and my husband and son ordered pizza.  This is when It became ridiculous; it took 50 minutes for the food to arrive.  At this time the place became packed. I girl didn't check if we needed more drinks or anything.  I was about to cancel our food but my husband stopped me from doing it.  When food arrived it was plain disappointment, my ribs were so dry that they were hard to chew and swallow, the crispy fries where ok but no ketchup hahahahaha.  I ask her for barbecue sauce, ketchup and crushed pepper, and after a long time she came back with barbecue only. This is a given right? you order fries and pizza then that means ketchup and pepper will be needed.  We had been to the one is Modesto, San Mateo, Salinas and one in LA and they always meet our expectations but this one, omg, total disappointment! We will not go back and will not recommend this location to anyone."
Jay S.,Bay Area,107,247,10,3.0,3/10/2008,"My friend and I went here for an early lunch, hoping to beat the crowds. We got there right after 11am and the restaurant was already about 1/4 full. We still had to wait about 15 - 20 minutes to be seated which was extremely irritating. The service was good and the waitress was really patient when we couldn't decided what we wanted (they have a huge menu!). The food was decent but not something that I would wait 1 - 2 hours for."
Sarah K.,"Garden Grove, CA",10,150,,1.0,12/7/2007,"They seated us in a place where there was no server and when I asked for somebody to get our waiter they responded with ""we're still working on it"".  I could see the waiters pointing and talking about us! The manager was extremely defensive.  Food is fine but it's a franchise so why wouldn't it be.  Quite frankly unless you don't feel like cooking your own giant cookie, don't bother coming here."
