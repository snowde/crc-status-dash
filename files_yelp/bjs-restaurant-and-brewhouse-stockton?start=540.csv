J T.,"Stockton, CA",35,63,,5.0,1/14/2009,"I was sooooo Happy when this place finally opened. I have been to allot of Bj""s Brewery around the country and they are great.. The only bad thing I have to say is when using their call ahead seating. It is a joke. We call there and ask, How long is the wait? They say 30 minutes. We get everyone in the car and by the time we get there it has been about 20 minutes. We go in and they tell us it is 30 more minutes . WTF. Just go there have some beer and wait...."
Nicole G.,"Stockton, CA",3,51,27,3.0,10/12/2009,"I'm all about hanging out, watching the game, having some drinks, but...and maybe I'm just old...the noise in this place is just on a whole other level.  Maybe it's the high ceiling that allows all the noise to resonate.  I never quite enjoy my dinner here, and usually leave with a headache.  I haven't been disappointed with the food.  It's good."
Jose R.,"Modesto, CA",1,28,3,4.0,10/4/2008,A great place for a beer and dinner. Love this place. The food was great and the service was excellent. The beer refreshing!!! I went with a buddy of mine who had suggeted it; Glad I agreed. It was good

Todd B.,"Lodi, CA",47,4,,4.0,9/20/2010,"ive been to BJs a handfull of times and have always enjoyed the experience. they have salads that will actually fill you up!! also, the baked potatos are great. they are the biggest potatos i have ever seen and have many different options for toppings. the pazookies are also great. good service everytime. parking does suck though!!"
Ryan W.,"Stockton, CA",23,31,,4.0,7/8/2008,"Overall, I think the food here is a nice addition to Stockton.  I've had the pizza, the fish & chips, the blackened chicken pasta, and a cheseburger over two trips here.  Until the newness of this location wears off, I would not suggest going their on a Fri/Sat night and waiting for an hour for a table.   All of the food I've tried was good to very good.  The fish and chips might be the best in stockton, but I found another restaurant in Fremont several years ago (Jack's brewery) that can't be beat in my eyes.  The pizza was excellent deep dish style (reminded me of when Uno's was still around)   The chicken and cheeseburger were both very good.   This restaurant can be kinda on the pricey side, but at least they save you money on drinks.  I tried several different beers, and they all sucked.  I think they were just all too far on the sweet side.  If I could have Valley Brewery's beer (Thier food is horrendous) with BJ's food I would be one happy camper.  The mixed drinks bring me to a pet pieve of mine - drinks without prices.  I ordered a Patron Anjeo specialty martini.  It was strong, which is fine for me, but I'm sure it didn't contain any more than 1-1.5 oz of alcohol given it's size.  When the bill came I realized that it was a $9.50 drink.  I understand paying $6-7 for premium liquor, and may have even decided to try the drink at $9.50(doubtful).  But with no prices on the menu for the variety of coctails, there is no way to make an informed decision on if you want to order any coctails...and nearly $10/drink is the price you should pay at a ballpark, not a restaurant."
anu r.,"Lodi, CA",3,9,,1.0,3/3/2008,We went to BJs on a sunday night. The service was ok but the food was terrible. I ordered pasta with shrimp. The shrimp was salty and the pasta was overcooked by the heat lamp. It was cold and hard. I will most likely never dine there again. The only plus was the bartender made a mean margarita.
John T.,"Westwood, CA",2,31,,1.0,2/18/2008,"I don't understand the hype about this place (at this location). I went here for lunch during my periodic trips to Stockton. I had the Pot Roast and I must say, it tasted awful. The gravy pretty much consisted of gravy mix, a ton of cornstarch, and water. It left a bitter aftertaste and I found it to be inedible. My friend had the Chicken Fried Steak; I had a bite since it was relatively big. It had the same formula: some kind of packaged gravy mix, a ton of cornstarch, and water. The beef was tender, but bland. The chicken was hard, but had a stale taste which could have come from the cooking oil. How did I know that it was full of cornstarch? The ""gravy"" pretty much solidifed in the middle of the meal. It tasted very starchy as well. The mashed potatoes were probably the best part of the entree that was edible. The steamed vegetables were pretty much soggy oversteamed vegetables sprinkled with way too much Lawry's seasoning salt. Disgusting. It is sad when the best part of the meal was the appetizer (the onion strings). How can you screw that up. It was bland, but the sauce was good enough. Overall, I would not come back. I did not have a drink though... it was 11am in the morning, haha."
pigsy k.,"Stockton, CA",2,45,,1.0,8/18/2009,"such an overhyped place. the only good thing about it is the fact that it opens LATE. other than that, I can't believe this restaurant can't make good CHICKEN ALFREDO!  Even microwave boxes taste better than what they served HERE. AND EVEN I could probably cook this better. Plus their chicken wings were so average. Never again!!"
Tara W.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",7,4,,4.0,12/29/2008,"I waited tables for about six years and during my experience I served wonderfully one day or one table and horrible another day or another table for whatever reason. Also, my boyfriend and I eat out very often. The truth is people - It's not BJ's who is horrible at good service- It's any restaurant whether it be a chain or independent restaurant. Trust me I know. I worked for a lousy independent restaurant and needless to say, it did not last; Nor did the second time they opened.  BJ's food is pretty good. My boyfriend and I eat healthy due to heath reasons and we modify the crap out of our dishes. It doesn't surprise us when they mess up even though it's annoying. But if anything is wrong with the food or they didn't bring it out correctly or to our satisfaction, they would fix the problem. Sometimes even comp a dish or appetizer. I used to live in Folsom and went to the BJ's their many many times and received both great and ridiculous service. Granted it's up to BJ's to hire a staff that would give excellent service, but they can't monitor everyone. It's unfortunate and it sucks when you get shitty service, but that is normal in most restaurants. BJ's does brew their own beer but at a location in L.A.. (I read a person's review that they didn't brew their own beer and wanted to correct that statement) (unless of course I was given the wrong info by a BJ's manager) So I give four stars because I am a fan and I really liked everything I had there. Although BJ's management needs to hire genuine waiters, the ambiance is cool and open. The booths are roomy, the TVs are huge, they are open late, it's casual or dressy, and the mood their is usually pretty happy and once again, the food tastes great! Oh, and for those of you don't know, ""all"" drinks are served with an equal amount of alcohol by law. If you want to taste the alcohol in your drink, then I suggest you order either a short, or a double. Perhaps just order a vodka martini, but then chances are, you'll just bitch and moan about how strong it is. Cheers!"
Jenn Y.,"San Francisco, CA",48,45,71,1.0,2/10/2008,well this was my first visit to BJ's.  food was okay.  but the service was horrible.  yes they got the order down right and seated fast but when it came time to bring out the food it was the worst.  my friend and i ordered the lunch special (half sandwich and soup).  first you will think that the soup would come out at the same time but no... we just got 1 even though there should have been 2.  we actually had to ask for it... i'm sorry but for a restaurant they should know that everything should come out at once esp. if its the same thing. our sandwiches at least came out at the same time so i'll give them that but it was slow.
