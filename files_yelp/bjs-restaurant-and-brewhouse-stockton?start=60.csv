Josh E.,"Stockton, CA",64,13,,3.0,8/20/2016,"The food and drinks here is okay, not bad but not terribly memorable either. The service, however, is really hit or miss. The bar service is usually on par with what you'd expect, but recently has gone down hill quickly. Yesterday the bar area service was disappointing, to say the least. The waiter literally threw some menus on the table in front of us, then spun around and left so quickly that I'm pretty sure the earth's rotation was slightly slowed by the momentum he generated. There was no greeting, no offer of water or drinks, and we didn't see him  (or her, I'm not sure which since they left our table so quick I didn't even get a look) for the rest of our time there. We waited 15 minutes but never saw a waiter again, so we left. The time before this, the waiter called me ""chief"" and I'm just not about that life. I wouldn't suggest coming here if it's busy, because the customer service goes downhill quickly under pressure. Other than that, it's an okay place."
Yoz Y.,"Miami, FL",0,34,3,3.0,4/29/2017,"Generic tasting food.  There can not possibly be a chef in the kitchen at any BJ's.  The food looks good, yet the flavors and quality fall short."
Ms. P.,"Stockton, CA",0,42,26,4.0,4/8/2017,"Came here out of curiosity. Always seeing the place busy and in the mood to try something new, brought us in. Busy indeed, but we got a table relatively quick. Our server, Tim, made the evening for us, and since being back we have had him be our server several times, which always makes the time here enjoyable, compared to when we have been here and had a waitress who did not give us the service we were used to and we were even ignored, until we got another waitress to help us out.  The food here is very good. Flat bread or deep dish pizza, is a go to for us and I like that you can customize the flat bread pizza, Spicy pig is one of my favorites. Usually get it with mushrooms (instead of jalapeños) and BBQ for the sauce. Found out recently, it's not so easy to do with the deep dish, if it's made with a certain sauce then it HAS to be that sauce. The BBQ Root Beer ribs are delicious! Sometimes they come a little too spicy for my liking, but at the same time, the taste is worth it. Steak...yea the steaks are good. Hamburgers are very good too. Mini piezookies are a nice little treat, chocolate chip and oreo are our favorites. Also, the calamari is very good too. Overall, we keep coming back for the food and try to try something different. The menu is big, but worth it. We plan on coming back to BJ's overall, and even look for it when we are in other cities."
Robert M.,"Stockton, CA",56,188,,2.0,6/23/2016,"I am at a loss with this review. The good: Food. We ordered salmon, ahi tuna salad and a pizza. Tasted great. Our waiter was also really attentive. Four stars The bad: The pizza and salmon was delivered (longer than normal wait). At least six minutes later the seared ahi salad shows up. Is delivering all the the orders at the same time a new concept? Zero stars. I have had similar experiences with this location. Food quality is good. Table service is good. Getting the food to the table in a timely and organized manner is poor."
Starr S.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,4,1.0,10/10/2015,"Generally good most nights but tonight? Nah. 12am, sitting in the bar area. Tall dark haired waitress named Mercedes would rather flirt with customers for over 10 minutes rather than take our orders, and then walked right past us  She was hot, but a 15 min wait for one water when we ordered two is ridiculous"
Daniel G.,"Stockton, CA",46,107,76,1.0,12/22/2016,"I wish hey we're as good as the Modesto location, here they slap things together decently and hope it's comparable to what's described on the menu. Severely Over cooked meat, 38 minutes waiting and counting on a Thursday. We waited 26 minutes for our waitress to ask us if we were ready to order as she laughed and spoke with co-workers. Drinks are great, hence the second star. Although I'll be coming back for the bar this is my last time coming in for food. I've waited too long, I've had two bad past experiences and I came here reluctantly with family and now they feel the same due to these outrages wait times. We arrived at 9:15pm today as I'm typing this review it's 10:04pm and have yet to receive food. It's about 20% full and fully staffed. I could grown the ingredients from scratch and made the food myself by now lol Update: I hade to reduce another star, I gave them two stars because at least the drinks are great. Now that's the only star they have left 10:51pm now: we have just left food arrive at table at 10:19 we finished at 10:34 and have been waiting to pay since. Natalie our waitress kept forgetting we existed, first we had to wait another waitress to call our waitress to order our food after sitting for half an hour, our food came out cold (keep in mind we sat 1:04 hr before being served), luckily a really nice guy, possibly the buss boy asked us if everything was fine. Not our waitress, the buss boy, I asked him to touch my sisters food and he said ""oh no, this is colder than ice, not cool, I'll be right back"" and sure enough he came back to our table with fresh food and even brought silverware because after asking our waitress she never brought any. When it came time to pay I asked Natalie for the bill twice before leaving. It was evident I didn't like my food I left the ENTIRE meal on the plate, did not ask for a to go box, and of course she didn't pick up on the context clues. My sister did get a box to go for her almost complete meal. When she asked if everything was great I responded ""it wasn't really good, I'm sorry"" which she apologized for but that's it. I'm never going to be a snob so I reluctantly paid for a meal which I didn't eat, or like or take with me. I picked up drive thru on the way home for all of us. The bus boy (I think that's what he was) was phenomenal and i wish I could have found him on the way out I had 40.00 for him !! As for my experience, this was the final nail in the coffin, I wouldn't go back even if I was offered free food for life. Complete dog$hit experience and food. I used to love this place many years ago. I am hand to god feeding my sisters left overs to our dog Cali this very moment. Silver lining = Great dog food !!!"
Jabin F.,"Stockton, CA",53,9,3,5.0,5/6/2017,Just had a great brunch thanks to a wonderful server Daniella.  She took good care of us and even gave me a fresh cup with hot coffee for me. Will definitely return for Brunch again.
Akilah B.,"San Pedro, CA",23,60,177,1.0,3/4/2017,"This place is one of the worst BJ'S I've been to. The service is slow, which makes the food cold. The drinks were poorly made, even after the remake. And it's freezing inside."
Laura R.,"Stockton, CA",0,33,1,2.0,8/5/2016,"Ahi tuna salad  Not enough ahi and the dressing tasted of oil... Pickled cucumbers were very good but I only got 2 pieces , disappointment"
Wenny L.,"Stockton, CA",262,17,22,3.0,3/11/2017,"I went at 12pm on a Saturday and it was almost empty. We got seated pretty quickly, and the service was great! Really quick, really nice. I ordered the deep dish gourmet five meat pizza. It did not look like the picture at all. There wasn't much meat on the pizza, but my biggest issue was that it was not an actual deep dish pizza. It was literally just a normal pizza with a lot more dough. The service was great, and the waitresses are really nice. But don't get the deep dish pizza. Just get the regular. The extra $10 is not worth the dough"
Garreth G.,"Stockton, CA",452,382,51,2.0,7/29/2016,"The only thing I recommend are the Pazooki's because it tastes delicious, if your willing to wait a long time for it. I've probably been here maybe 6 or 7 times but each time the service was slower than a Slowpoke. Seriously every time, no matter what time of day, whether its really slow or busy the service is crap. I thought I wrote a review before about this place but I'm sure it was deleted. Pizza - If your going to order pizza it will take a while but be patient it will come. But when it does the pizza here is lackluster from other deep dish pizza places you can get or if you can even find it somewhere else in Stockton. Their beer on tap are sub par but it's good to know at least they try.  Their appetizer wings are pretty good but the celery that it came with were not fresh but who eats those anyway. The Ahi Poke my wife ordered was good but it only came with one slice of avocado.  When we paid the bill they got 2/3 right for the specials. So to fix the problem it takes an additional 15 minutes to get the check again. I'm probably going to come here again just because I like to prove myself wrong that this place is a dump and they should open something else that has nothing to do with food."
Vanessa D.,"Stockton, CA",0,24,2,5.0,2/20/2017,"I went on a Monday night and it was not full so I really enjoyed that, the waiter was delightful and the food was to die for! Their pizza is great and what is even better is that Monday it is half off their pizzas which i came to find out later, i also ordered a white peach margarita that I still can't get out of my mind and their penne shrimp asparagus was soo good i cannot wait to go back and get a plate for myself! It was a good experience and they took a reasonable amount of time to get us our food after ordering it. Good atmosphere, great service and good food!"
Noel R.,"Lodi, CA",0,4,1,1.0,8/22/2017,There comes a time when you are done giving a place chances based on how good they used to be... today was that day. 6:30pm. We walked in with our children and put our name on the waitlist. We get it. We had children. The servers and host had a side conversation.  Servers didn't want a party with children. They proceeded to seat the next three parties of adults without reservations who came in after us and told us it would be half an hour wait in a restaurant with several empty booths and tables. I was a server once upon a time. What they did was wrong. We walked across the street to Chili's and had an amazing meal and amazing service. Time for change.  :)
Kristin S.,"San Jose, CA",93,59,8,1.0,7/17/2016,"I hadn't been here in over a year and I will likely never return. Last Thursday night I took my 11 year old son out and the waiter named Brandon was overly helpful in the sleaziest most disrespectful and tasteless manner. I felt violated by his constant touching my hand, arm, shoulder and his lame comments about what I should order and how much I should tip him?? Just an awful experience. My son saw everything he did and asked me if he could punch him in the face. I told him no. Violence doesn't solve anything! Pizookie 10 pts, Brandon -10. No woman should ever experience what I did. Simply disgusting!!"
Alycia D.,"Tracy, CA",93,22,17,1.0,5/19/2017,"The food is mediocre and over priced. The service is pretty awful because it's a bunch of college aged kids half of the time. The place is beautiful and looks fancy but honestly I'd rather eat at a local diner. There are much better places to eat in stockton than in this place. My first time attending BJs my friends and I were celebrating my boyfriends promotion. While in the restaurant my server was an ignorant college aged woman who decided it was appropriate to ask me rudely why I was in a wheelchair. When I stated I was battling cancer she then decided to further question my illness AND ASK ME IF MY HAIR WAS REAL OR A WIG. I was absolutely shocked and extremely upset. When she realized that I was upset she then proceeded to tell me that her grandmother had cancer and tell me I was pretty for having cancer. After this experience I absolutely refuse to ever go to BJs again. I understand that this is one server, but most of the servers there seem rude and ignorant. Fast food workers are more friendlier than these people! On top of that the food is about the same quality as an Applebee's and you're paying twice as much. The food service is slow and it takes so long to get your order. The only benefit of this place is that it's moderately open late, but I'd honestly rather get taco bell or mcdonalds than this place."
Del S.,"Lodi, CA",308,253,2068,5.0,7/25/2015,"Today I went in to pick up food for catering a business lunch, and as always I ordered their Friends and Family Deal in Take Out (And Tenia and Leticia were so helpful!) Friends And Family deal comes with the following -2 Large Specialty Pizzas -2 Large Specialty Salads -Either 2 full Rack of Ribs or 10 Balsamic Chicken -Either Chicken Wings or Chicken Strips -4 sides  All for $99.00 It is supposed to feed 8-10, but is honestly more like feeding 12 people in my opinion..  Love this deal!"
Dax M.,"Stockton, CA",117,70,86,4.0,5/25/2016,"Micro brew in Stockton is a little rare. I know that BJ's is a chain, but their beer is really good. They have a good selection from blonde to stout, even seasonal. I particularly enjoyed the Root of Evil, a smooth IPA mixed with ginger. The ginger pairs surprisingly well with hops and adds a touch of spice to an already wonderful beverage. Perfect for a hot afternoon.  The food is consistently good and they present a wide variety to choose from.  Seasonal appetizers, salads, soups, hamburgers and wraps just to name a few. Ahi salad with fried artichoke hearts was my selection today and it didn't disappoint.  You might try their sparkling wine cocktail for dessert. It comes with a fresh strawberry and a glass rimmed with sugary goodness. Genius!"
Puka M.,"Galt, CA",27,37,22,3.0,7/19/2017,"Definitely nothing to write home about! BJ;s seem to have lost a step in service and food quality. After a long drive from a few days of wine tasting in Paso Robles, we stopped in at BJ's since they were one of only a handful of places open after 9:00 p.m. Our server was a very nice young man who actually did a nice job taking care of us. It was his assistant that brought the food to the table and both times, when bringing my beer and then my food, I was resting my wrist on the table reading my emails and she nearly slammed each item down right on my hands, thank goodness i was quick to retract them. A subliminal message maybe? Rude at best. The thin crust pizzas we ordered were just ok. Not bad, just not giving you the desire to order them again. It seems that ealier when BJ's first came to town, almost everything they served was delicious! Now it seems like it's just ok. I hope it's just me or the not so nice service of the servers assistant that dampened my taste buds a bit."
wyman o.,"Stockton, CA",1,6,4,1.0,6/21/2017,Worst service I've ever seen tonight. 1 hour 15 min to get our food. Waitress didn't give a crap about nothing. Mgr wouldn't come to the table or she didn't ask. Grandson birthday dinner didn't work tonight.
Jem S.,"Stockton, CA",0,6,3,5.0,3/12/2017,"Great service, great food, great and enthusiastic servers as well! everything was an amazing experience. i've been here twice already and i know imma keep visiting til infinity, so if yall haven't been here yet, yall are missin out, get on it quick! and enjoy!"
