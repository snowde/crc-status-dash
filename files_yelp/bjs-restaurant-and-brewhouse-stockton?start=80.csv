Irene B.,"Stockton, CA",149,14,1,1.0,2/19/2017,"Terrible service from the point we sat down. No plates no utensils no napkins. Had 4 different people bring things to the table , drinks, appetizers, refills.  After an hour i finally ask to see the manger who had brought out a sbrwad bowl about 35 minutes earlier, he responded that it had been a while since he had brought out the bread bowl, that he would check on it. Never saw him again. All of the sudden our food is delivered to the table COLD!!  I had asked what had taken so long. Oh the cooks are taking a long time. So i replied what no sorry its taking so long. Nothing.. so the food was cold... then the waitress says that the manager is comping the entire meal and ask the guest with us who was having birthday today if he wanted a pazookie but not the rest of us.. but the manager couldnt come tell us and apoligize for the terrible service"
Annette L.,"Santa Clara, CA",199,51,19,1.0,6/5/2016,"I went here with a party of about 16 for a friend's birthday. When sitting down, the waiters decided to split the table in half to make it easier (I guess). But when the time came to order, a waiter only took half of our orders while the other waiter lagged & didn't come until 10minutes later.  Obviously this was a lack of communication. Normally it wouldn't be a big deal, but it was so awkward when half the table would get their food and the other half would just stare at each other (hangrily btw!). And dessert for the birthday girl came first, when not everyone had their pizookies. awkkward."
Tito G.,"Belmont, CA",41,108,42,3.0,7/4/2016,"I came to this BJs on my way back from a Yosemite camping trip. Me and a group of friends were pretty hungry and wanted to see the final game of Copa America which this place is pretty convenient for both of those. We came in and we were accommodated with a table that can fit 8. We ordered our food and watched the game.  As we were watching the game, A lady passed by our table and fell pretty badly. She couldn't get up and was really in pain. We came by to help her up and to sit her down. What was really surprising though was the lack of attention of the workers around the area. There was 3 waiters by one of the register within eye view of what just happened and not a single one noticed it. The table next to the register had to yell at them in order to get their attention. By then, the manager came by and attended her and asked if she needed anything. He then asked around to see what happened and I guess by then things got sorted out. Hopefully that fall wasn't too bad. I think she just tripped on herself since the floor wasn't wet or anything, plus she was wearing these high wedges shoes.  Food finally came in and I had the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne to which was pretty good. Felt light and didn't came off a strong either. The one thing I really do like about BJs is their Pizookies. I'm not a desert kind of guy but this is my exemption. Sooo goood! Overall experience here, its ok. I feel like the people working here should be more aware of whats going on around them so that when incidents like this comes along, they would be faster in responding. I like BJs and probably would come back if Im in the area"
D B.,"Stockton, CA",14,209,357,3.0,8/20/2015,"The food here is decent. The pizza is one of the better items to go with. It's a good hang out place with a nice list of beers including their own brews. Service is what ruins this place. For the most part it's always bad when I go.  The most recent visit our server asked if we knew what we wanted after just handing us a 20 page menu thirty seconds ago. A simple salad order was messed up, a pitcher of beer took 20+ min to get (she informed us at one point they're ""working"" on your pitcher o.O), and we barely got service from her after the food came. A guy and another nice girl did a better job taking care of us. I'm sure I'll go here again but it's not a first choice even as a place to just hang out. Pizza, pizookie, and beer selection are what I look forward to when going. I also noticed they have brunch, which I'm a big fan of so maybe I'll give that a shot at some point."
Rebecca B.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/24/2017,"Been here about 10 times in last year and it's been really hit and miss. Perhaps once the food and service were good. Not great but passable. This is my last time though as it was horrible. We ordered three burgers. Two medium well , one medium. We waited 35 min. 1st plate was done correctly medium well. 2nd was burnt and dry supposed to be medium well with fried jalapeños. They were raw. 3rd was supposed to be medium it was also well done. We did not see our server so we flagged someone else who when we explained the issue he actually asked ""So, do you want to send it back?"" Well, duh. We watched our daughter eat her food, and waited and waited. Finally our server checked on us and we explained the issue and she said she would check. It's now been another 35 mins and still no food. Daughter is done and we have not had our beverages refilled. 40 mins and our corrected orders arrive, well kinda. My burger cooked but still no fried jalapeño. That was an easy fix tho. My husbands burger was I swear mooing. Looked like they grabbed a handful of meat, tossed it on the grill for 30 seconds and flip and serve. He ate it...much to my chagrin but after well over an hour we were both hungry. By the way anyone who doesn't know B.J.s no longer serves shoestring cut fries although they are pictured on the menu. So, we asked and got a discount, never saw or heard from the manager. Server hunted him down. We will not be back."
Roger A.,"Stockton, CA",7,17,5,2.0,7/18/2016,"The chicken wings are very good. The pizza was good. The cream soda and the blackberry lemonade was very good. Our server AMBER was very good! Shout out to AMBER! Thank you :) Now for the bad...we were told the wait for a table was 30 min, however, it took over an hour to get a table for 8 on a Sunday afternoon even though there was a entire section of tables available, they refused to open it.  After we finally sat down We ordered food right away because we had SO MUCH TIME to look at the menu. But unfortunately we still didn't eat for almost ANOTHER HOUR! I finally asked the manager how much longer it would be because we had already been at the restaurant for 2 hours without even eating anything. She seemed apologetic, and went back to check.  The food was good and the server tried her best, but This is definitely not a place to go for big parties of people. It just takes too long. It might be better to go with just 2 people."
Trina W.,"Stockton, CA",18,27,11,1.0,11/13/2016,"My cousin and I were seated at 8:15 pm, we received our drinks and ordered appetizers.  We waited and waited and waited...everyone around us was served ...by 9:25 pm no one checked on us we didn't receive our appetizers and the sad thing is this wasn't the first time.  Never again!  We left 10.00 for the drinks and walked out."
Itzy N J.,"Lodi, CA",0,1,3,1.0,5/13/2017,"I am writing this review because I expected a lot from BJ's and I am disappointed with my experience. I took my family out to eat expecially for my mom for Mother's Day. At first our server Miranda took our order and then later she said her time was up and she had to leave and left us with Victoria and then with Kristen. They kept switching servers that at the end I didn't even know who was our server. So we get our food by Kristen and then she leaves and we start eating and then we all need sauces for our steaks and fries, and we call Victoria over and ask for all the sauces we need and she says okay I'll get that for you . Then 10 minutes of eating we ask Victoria again about the sauces, we are already half done with our food and it's getting cold, and she says oh the other server is getting that for you ! And I said okay. Still staying a bit calm because I notice they are a bit busy. But then I realized there was no other server who we told about the sauces, she was the only one unless she told someone else and they didn't bring it. So I'm getting really upset because now we all can't even eat our food because we are waiting for sauces and it's getting cold and we are running out of drinks. So we are trying to at least eat while it's still warm without sauces but also mad that Victoria said the other server was getting them and she couldn't get them for us, and all she was doing was talking and on her tablet walking around doing nothing! Like getting sauces should not take that long! So then Kristen comes to our table and asks if we need anything and we say yes! We need sauces and refills , we already asked two times and we can't even eat until we get sauces and refills, our food is getting cold. So she says I'm sorry about that I will personally bring that for you. So then she quickly got that for us and asked if we needed anything else. We at least enjoyed about a quarter of our food with sauce at the end but it was already cold and we were already full! So I think Victoria needs more training on serving than socializing for too long. I was not going to leave a tip at all , until Kristen helped us although it was a little too late we still did because of her willingness to help and make it right with her excellent customer service. I am very disappointed with my experience at BJ's expecially because it's a nice restaurant and a bit expensive , it was our first time here too."
Luis J.,"Stockton, CA",23,52,28,1.0,12/8/2016,"I keep trying to give this place a shot, but yesterday I was sadly disappointing once again. I've already had an instance where I had to complain about the service, however it never seems to improve. The waitress hardly came to see how we were doing and it took about 15 mins just to get my drink. This place is terrible, not the worst in Stockton but a close runner-up."
CeeCee T.,"Stockton, CA",40,41,938,3.0,4/5/2015,The food is mediocre. I love the avocado spring rolls! I usually order the Parmesan crusted chicken dinner and the best beginnings sampler. I used to order that pot roast sandwich but they discontinued it. Pizookies are always a nice treat after dinner! We always resort to coming here cuz it has large areas for big groups and they're open late. Thing is the service is kinda slow and the waitors and waitresses seem unwelcoming and rude. Like they get annoyed if we ask for a refill of water or a fork or something. Yall need to smile a bit!!!
Laureen A.,"Stockton, CA",48,12,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Ordered my meal for curbside service. I arrived at the time they said it would be ready and called to let them know. Twenty minutes later, I'm still waiting. The delivery person comes out with food but it's not for me. ANOTHER 20 minutes passes and my food finally comes out. I'm so glad I checked the bag before driving off. The delivery person was really nice and was very apologetic when I told her my salad was missing. She brought me my salad and a whole hour later after placing my order, I finally got all my food and left  -_- Curbside is supposed to be a convenience and cut the wait time. C'mon BJs, get it together!"
Sharleen M.,"Stockton, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/22/2017,"BJ'S is a great place to have a good time. My sons, and I arrived a little after 4:00, and even though it was pretty crowded, we were seated immediately. Our waitress was personable, and efficient. She took our orders, our appetizers were delicious. Recommend the stuffed mushrooms! The chef is amazing, this is the only place that understands 'kiss the grill '! Prime Rib delicious, and cooked to perfection. All of our meals were great, we will be back!  Highly recommend BJ'S BREWHOUSE to anyone who wants a great meal for a reasonable price."
Rootee A.,"Sacramento, CA",189,54,474,1.0,2/28/2016,"So I'm going to go straight to the point. I SPECIFICALLY ordered a chicken Sandwich with NO BACON. I get my sandwich, take a bite and decide to take the tomatoes out when I notice Little ITS and pieces of bacon on my avocado. Vividly you could tell they placed the Bacon and then decided to remove it.  I truly was upset because it's forbidden for me to eat bacon and for me to have to experience something that could have been prevented made me feel disrespected. Mistakes are made and can be fixed....appropriately! They could have easily just made me a new sandwich but for them to just brush it off like it's not a big deal was rude. To top it off they were not even busy, in which I don't even want to imagine what happens back there when they are busy.  So then here comes Andrew "" the manager"". He asked us "" oh is everything ok"" .. Hmm no that's why you are here? I'm thinking!!By the way he's not even standing straight or being professional he's leaning on the booth next to us, like he knows us! From what recall even a waiter takes your order standing straight up.Andrew does apologize and asks if we would like anything (later on it was a free dessert they were offering) hmm NO! No one wants a dessert, we came here for food and drinks!  In conclusion, at least I ask for my 2 mojitos to be on the house, since I longer wanted to eat! They stated I couldn't get that for free, but at least they were not charging me for my sandwich and they offered a free dessert! .. Hmm excuse me? I better not pay for a sandwich that was made incorrectly! .. At this point I was so upset I just took care of my tab and decided to never come here again; including my cousins. Should I give them credit for not charging me for the cheese sticks? ...."
Dave F.,"Stockton, CA",216,333,94,4.0,6/8/2015,"In an earlier review, I compared experiences at several local places for watching the 2015 NBA Playoffs. B J's is another of those places where we took an entire game in.  Seated in the bar at a High table, we opened with Sliders and artchoke dish, excellent start, 4 nice sliders, perfect to split. B J'd in house brews are better than the tap pours at the other ""A"" chain restaurant. Spltting an entrees, worked perfectly, and was just the right amount.  Our server was on top of drink orders, friendly, and not trying to rush us out for the next tip.  All in all, not a bad deal."
Juan G.,"Stockton, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/23/2017,"I highly recommend this place!! Great food,good service good drinks. One of my favorite dishes is the full rack of ribs!"
Jessa V.,"Stockton, CA",3,8,1,5.0,6/19/2017,"Giving this place  5 stars because our server MICHAEL was awesome! Food was super good. I ordered the ""cherry salmon"" I forgot the right name for it lol but yea it was a must try! I would dine in everyday if Michael help us every time we come. Haha Thank You Michael!!!"
Mandy J.,"Linden, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/14/2017,I've had to wait a while before being seated they told us 15-20 minutes but it took nearly 40 minutes  To just be seated for a party of 2. We order an appetizer and drinks the drinks came and the appetizer came 5 mins after our food they stated they could take it back and admitted it was their mistake yet still charged us I think simply offering to take it back isn't a proper solution since it was their fault it was late. I've had experiences similar to this at other restaurants and they didn't charge us for a late appetizer.
Zombie O.,"Manteca, CA",0,13,,1.0,12/9/2016,"So where to start.....this is about my 4th time coming to this place in the past year and every time it gets more and more disappointing, from bad service to bad food not to mention my grandma slipping and falling in there from wet floors. Now you expect these kind of things from a Denny's or ihop but even they have stepped up their performance from what they use to be. Sadly I can't say the same about this place. In a city with so many many many box chain restaurants you think something would be done to keep ppl coming back. Apparently they operate under the guise of who cares about service, and food as long as ppl pay for crap that's what they're gonna keep shoveling. I'm going to Denny's"
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,8/23/2015,"Dined here last night. Service was good, food was good. Timing a little slow for getting our meals but, the manger did come over to check on us and explained / apologized about the wait & offered to refill our drinks.That was a plus on good customer service! Great menu with many options!"
Malinda C.,"Stockton, CA",0,20,4,2.0,5/21/2016,"Went in on a Saturday so we expected it to be busy. That was fine. I ordered the southern fried chicken with mashed potatoes, that was delicious. My sister ordered her fav dish which is the balsamic chicken with mashed potatoes and a side salad. While she was eating her side salad, she found a cold nasty looking piece of roast beef underneath. We were definitely thrown off by that. Manager offered to have her plate remade but we had waited so long for it to come out we just said no thank you due to the fact it was already late (10pm) and we were tired. So instead they offered a free dessert which we accepted. Overall our server was slow, food took long, and one of the orders was messed up /:"
