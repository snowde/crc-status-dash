Gianna O.,"Sugar Land, TX",55,464,642,4.0,1/5/2018,"We have been here a few times now and each time the service has been very friendly and the food consistently good. It looks clean and the wait, with the exception of weekend nights, has never been very long.  The menu is pretty big and covers most food categories. On our latest visit, we began with fried cheese curds and spinach stuffed mushrooms. Both were quite good. I especially liked that the mushrooms contained artichokes as well as spinach. The cheese curds were soft and squeaky and very tasty. The drink I ordered was the Blood Orange Pom Sangria. The orange slice served on it was not a blood orange but it was still very good. The neat thing about this drink was it contained Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey which I had never had before. It was sweet with a bit of cinnamony heat and cooling citrus. I recommend this as a drink to try.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It's light but flavorful and is served with cheesy mashed potatoes, broccoli and a Chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Also ordered was the Spicy Pig Tavern Cut Pizza. It's like a thin flatbread and very crisp. This one has ham, applewood smoked bacon, pineapple and jalapeño. The other dish ordered was the Southern Comfort chicken sandwich which has crisp fried chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, sliced ham, alfredo sauce and a Dijon mayonnaise.  My extreme sweet tooth kind of demands dessert so I got the chocolate chunk cookie Pizookie, a sizable chocolate chunk cookie served in a round pan like a deep dish pizza and topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Very enjoyable! The meal was good and we never felt rushed. We left quite full and satisfied.  If you don't want much of a wait make sure to get there from 5-5:30 PM or at least before 6PM on weekends."
Victoria M.,"Houston, TX",887,556,4025,3.0,12/12/2017,"Setup: family dinner The better: large portions, lots of options, good chain restaurant food, family friendly The lesser: as with many chain restaurants, the food is really heavy. Boxing half is like standard procedure."
Kristen U.,"Los Fresnos, TX",284,33,1,4.0,11/24/2017,"Was very satisfied with the food and the customer service was amazing. I ordered the California chicken club with sweet potato fries and a bowl of tomato bisque soup. My fiancé ordered a BBQ burger with fries. Both were extremely delicious. We also ordered a Cookies & Cream Pazookie, and it was HEAVENLY.  We left our server a large tip because he was excellent. The staff at the front were excellent as well.  Highly recommend this facility for all! It was a tad bit pricey, which is why I did 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall-- a wonderful experience."
Diana A.,"Houston, TX",71,328,346,3.0,11/11/2017,Better experience today than previously. Ordered tomatoes with mozzarella & clam chowder soup. Both were good. It was not packed when we arrived at 11:30 am. There is plenty of parking near the front and also some spots get shade. Two person booths are comfortable. You can bring a light sweater if you get cold easily.
Ema E.,"Houston, TX",177,81,4,4.0,10/28/2017,Best turkey burgers I have ever tasted.  Pizookies are SINFUL.  OMG. Best salad bar ever.  Great pizzas!!!! Large portions.  Pasta dishes are incredibly tasty.  Chicken tenders and fries are yummy too.
Steph C.,"Sugar Land, TX",264,227,970,5.0,9/29/2017,"BJ's is one of my favs! Great food and great service. I love getting the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos, the roasted portobello & asparagus salad, the chicken tortilla soup, clam chowder in a bread bowl, fried Calamari, stuffed mushrooms, and so much more! They have lots of delicious food on the menu. You will not be disappointed."
Nathan W.,"Austin, TX",325,64,143,4.0,6/25/2017,"If you've never had the pazookie, you haven't lived  Food: 3.5/5 There's a wide selection here. 75% of the time I go for the pizzas because they're great for sharing at a good price point. My dad always gets a chicken salad. Their chips and dip are a little disappointing, mainly because the chips are sometimes stale. But the deep dish pizzas are pretty solid. Crunch crust with a chewy, bready middle with plenty of toppings and Parmesan/chili flakes on the side. Can't go wrong with that.  If I was just eating their pazookies, it'd be 5/5. Those things are fresh and melt in your mouth. Chocolate chunk is your classic, but I really really love their monkey bread as well. It's AMAZING!!! Service: 4/5 Today we had a really awesome waiter, who I'm sorry I can't for the life of me remember his name. He was an older gentleman who calls himself the biggest clown in the restaurant, but he cracked jokes, made us feel welcome, and we loved him. Had a great experience! I don't think I've ever been disappointed with service. They're timely and attentive. Atmosphere: 4/5 It's clean, it feels a little classier than your typical dining experience with your darker ambience and wood furniture. There's a bar with sports on the tvs scattered around. A little something for everyone. Bathrooms: 3.5/5 Gendered communal bathrooms. Not dirty! Pretty standard, and they match the aesthetic of the restaurant. Price: 3/5 It depends what you get. I'll admit, a lot of their main dishes cost upwards of $12, which is a bit much for me. But like I said before, I always get the pizzas for sharing so I end up paying around $8-10 per meal. What's great is they always have a lot of deals going around (check their social media). Today we used a BOGO entree coupon from their Facebook as well as the Father's Day VIP card that gives 20% off every visit from when you pick it up on Father's Day to July 9. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I've been coming here more and more in the recent years, just because of their amazing deals. Makes it all worth it."
Ray S.,"Houston, TX",294,297,1985,4.0,4/26/2017,"Walked in and the people here were very friendly. The place for lunch was not packed as expected it to be. I walked in and was seated. As I waited for my mother to arrive I ran into old friend so this visit is starting off good.  My mom and ordered the Tortillia soup; which was ok.. it needed more flavor/seasoning and it needed to be hot. I was disappointed. For lunch my mother ordered the Grilled Cheeses and I the Santa Fe Salad.  My mom's grilled cheeses was gooood and cheesy. The bread was toasted just right. All over!!! I know my mom ordered it but she's my mom so she gave me a bite. I wanted to take two but it was not my food.  My Asante Fe salad looked like a national treasure but I had to take it down. The blackened chicken was moist and plenteous in my salad. The avocado was cut in nice size chunks. The salad hosted plenty of all its ingredients. However, maybe too much corn. My mom was satisfied so I'm happy. Now my mom is a Yelper. She just befriended me."
Allen T.,"Sugar Land, TX",2072,292,2541,2.0,1/2/2017,Saw a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to visit it after many years!  Now I know why I haven't been back. I guess a lot of people must have had the same coupon as there was a bit of a wait. By the time we were seated we were placed right in front of the kitchen doors. Not the best view but whatever.  What I found kind of annoying was how long it took before anyone came up to wait on us. Hmmmm not starting off well. I ordered my favorite drink an Arnold Palmer but once served found the drink way too tart!  Yuck!  Finally ordered!  Bummer was it took forever before the food arrived. Assessment?  Food was meh..certainly not worth what we paid. Glad I had a coupon.  Even with that it was meh at best.  Better choices in mom and pop joints. Food much better and so is the service. Guess it will be another 10 years before we go back.  Probably with another coupon!  Lol!
Natalie T.,"Missouri City, TX",40,127,180,4.0,9/21/2017,"Came here on a Wednesday night for mid week date night but I was actually craving a burger. Long and behold the food gods must've heard my prayer because Wednesday night's is $10 loaded burger night with unlimited fries at BJs. It is a pretty good deal, considering the portions are pretty big....I was only able to finish half of my burger! Now I have visited this restuarant many many times in the past but this visit was very different. I was  truly impressed by both the quality of food AND enjoyed the great service.  (S/O to Raven for being so efficient yet friendly and nice). I'll definitely return again."
Walter A.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Stupidity to the fullest, got there at 11 pm and walked out at 12:05 without food. The sever ordered the food (supposedly) and came back after 50 minutes asking my friend and I what we ordered again because the order didn't go  through, after that the manager talked to us and said that the food will be ready in 10 minutes max , and guess what they food was not still ready. We decided to walk out and we waited for more than an hour for them and they still didn't make right. This is not the way you treat people, customers service will keep your business rolling. I was very embarrassed because I took my friend there. Now I won't recommend anyone and i won't go back to that place.  PEOPLE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME THERE."
Alexa B.,"Missouri City, TX",322,7,,3.0,12/10/2017,So I haven't been to BJ in a while but I usually like the food. I think it's over priced for the quality though. Their pizzas are the best thing here. When I arrived I was given a dirty plate. Lol wat.
Natalie R.,"Pearland, TX",3,17,12,1.0,6/22/2017,"My experience last night at this location was terrible. My server was Alexsandra B (that's the name on the receipt, she never actually introduced herself).  Let me start by saying my friends and I attend this restaurant often. The location is convenient for all of us and the pizookie is usually what gets us in, and the food is usually good too.  We went to the restaurant to catch up with each other. Our server was friendly but every time we wanted another drink or an appetizer we had to flag her down. She would constantly go to the tables on both sides of our booth and we would try to catch her when she dashed by. We finally caught her again when we were ready to order our meal.  We must have waited close to 40 minutes for our food. Please keep in mind that it was after 10 on a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't packed at all but somehow we continued to wait. Not once did the server come over to check on us, ask if anyone wanted another drink, or to give us an update on our food.  Finally one of the guys from the kitchen brings out our food. It was cold. Not cool, but actually cold. My friend ordered a pizza, she had to wait another 5 minutes for Alexsandra to bring her a plate. When my friend got the plate and grabbed a slice there was no gooey cheese coming up, her pizza was also cold. When the guy brought the pizza he brought it out with the pan carrier (that's used when the pizza is sizzling hot so they don't get burned) he could have just used his hands. This pan wasn't even warm. It seemed like the food was just sitting there in the back. If it's late night, and I assume you want to go home, wouldn't you get this food to the table asap? That's clearly not there logic.  Once again the server never came to check on how we were. We were annoyed by that point and my friend flagged her down for boxes and a pizookie. She paced around for a while, I believe at one point sitting at a booth on her phone. We got the check and soon left.  Fast forward to this morning, I woke up with diarrhea and vomiting everywhere. Haha! Guess who got food poisoning!  I'm beyond disappointed with my experience last night. Next time we good out I'll be sure to suggest a different restaurant. There are way to many awesome restaurants in this area, to settle for poor customer service and food that will get you sick. Please do better."
John L.,"Houston, TX",620,68,122,4.0,3/7/2017,"Visited here on a Thursday which has a full rack of ribs, 2 sides, a salad, and dessert for $18!  Be prepared for a wait, this place is always busy that you should probably order your food with your drinks to make sure you're not extremely hungry by the time your food is out.  Overall, the dish was good for the value. The meat on the ribs had a definite nice seasoning with the BBQ sauce.  If you're extremely hungry, get the full rack, if not, I'd suggest the half rack which was $12 or $13, it'll be a better value and you will be stuffed at the end of the course."
Lori L.,"Houston, TX",0,9,2,4.0,9/14/2017,"It took a couple of minutes for us to be acknowledged at the host stand walking in and sometimes the service is a hit or a miss past a certain time. HOWEVER, our server Brandon V. definitely made our visit an enjoyable experience! He was super friendly, attentive, and even made some really good suggestions so that should be commended.  Food/pizookies are always great too!"
Leslie C.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,1.0,1/4/2018,"The single reason I'm giving a one-star review is because of a server named Taylor who treated us with a shocking lack of professionalism. We love BJ's and know that the Pearland, Willowbrook, and League City locations are great. The food and the other staff at this location during this visit were also outstanding. But this young woman shouldn't be in a service position. She ignored us for as long as possible, glared and avoided speaking beyond what was absolutely necessary, and after we'd been waiting for quite a long time at the table, another server came and explained that he would be taking over for her. We had not been anything but friendly and polite, so we were baffled by this treatment, which was, trust me, nothing but rudeness. We'll certainly return, as we enjoy BJ's and have never had any other problem. But if we return to this location, I'm definitely going to request anyone BUT Taylor. You might want to do likewise."
Caroline K.,"Sugar Land Town Square, Sugar Land, TX",151,1,,1.0,12/28/2017,If you're looking for a place with even close to OK service DO NOT COME HERE. Multiple times have had to get up and leave because it took longer than 15 minutes for anyone to even come to the table. This location SUCKS with service
Ocie C.,"Westside, Houston, TX",132,45,137,4.0,8/10/2017,"Ok, my 13 year old niece recommended this place and she suggested the hickory brisket and bacon burger. Now, we were skeptical, but oh my my...what a good tasting burger! My twin sister and I loved it. Two of my nieces ordered chicken strips and another ordered the grilled chicken alfredo. Everyone enjoyed their entrees. The atmosphere is very nice and clean, sort of has that upscale brewery feel. Prices are reasonable. Service was friendly and professional."
Paul M.,"Austin, TX",3,77,86,4.0,2/8/2017,Solid choice for lunch HH or dinner. My wife and I love their salads as well as their pizza. If you love beer you will love their house made brews.  HH 3pm - 7pm
Bunny V.,"Houston, TX",6,26,11,2.0,12/18/2017,"We go to this restaurant a lot, knowing how bad the service is but I just love their thin pizzas. We came in after the lunch rush and more than half of the tables were empty. We order our drinks and they come without napkins, as coasters. Our pizza comes out from the deliver staff with no utensils or napkins. Our server walks by us just eating and dropped crumbs everywhere but never stops when we try to get her attention. I end up giving up and walking to the station where they keep napkins and plates and get my own items. I sit down and she must realize it and drops off 2 utensils. We never get drink refills. We have to ask for a check as we are sitting with empty drinks and an empty pizza tray. If you want decent service, this isn't the place."
Tammy H.,"Houston, TX",593,156,327,2.0,1/13/2017,Ehh lunch special spaghetti and grilled chicken Alfredo was okay nothing special for $10.81 but the pazooki which is melty chocolate chip and ice cream was not so bad it was actually tasty. Fun fact get a free one on your bday!
Jessica A.,"Houston, TX",1,13,11,5.0,5/26/2017,"Food: pizza, Root Beer glazed wings, clam chowder in the bread bowl, Root Beer glazed ribs, prime rib special and monkey bread pizookie are a must. Staff: Brandon is the best server! Cherry is the best bartender ever! Manager Erick is always checking on all the tables to make sure everyone is satisfied. I have no complaints but that the staff should be more like them. At least a fake smile to make this place more welcoming.  Great atmosphere and great music. You will have a great time. Drinks are awesome!!! Try the Strawberry pina colada drink( can't recall the name)"
Stephanie C.,"Houston, TX",225,8,3,3.0,10/29/2017,"BJs is a favorite chain restaurant of mine but I was pretty disappointed with the service my party had in this location. Numerous mistakes/mishaps. One who just ran an appetizer for our server spilled some chips and was just like ""oops"". I hope they improve because the food here is awesome, it was just a bad night."
Grace R.,"Austin, TX",38,8,2,2.0,7/8/2017,"I come here every now and then and usually stay within my comfort of the menu. Today I tried something new, the new chicken fried steak burger. The servers were speaking highly of it, so I ordered. Once I got my food, I noticed my burger was not fried at all, my egg was fully cooked and it overall tasted like a plain ass burger. So I express my non satisfaction with my server who was so kind about it. She calls the manager over and here's when I have an issue. I explained to the manager about my meal, he sits in my booth and begins to try and justify this shitty burger. ""Oh the batter must have fallen off"" ""oh this burger is just not my favorite"" ????? I tell him I'm not looking to send it back because I have to leave soon and he offers no compensation for it and it's not that I've eaten the thing. I've had maybe two bites of it until I was just completely turned off. Anyways if it wasn't for my server BRANDY who sincerely apologized and offered a discount I would've left unhappy and more disgusted with the restaurant."
DeWayne R.,"Houston, TX",161,567,283,4.0,12/4/2016,"BJ's has a great menu with a variety of things to choose. I had the Chicken Fried Chicken lunch special, with mashed potatoes and broccoli (in place of the corn succotash) and it was perfect. Our server was pretrty good. She was attentive and as warm as she could be, considering the liunch rush."
Vanessa H.,"Houston, TX",205,34,261,3.0,10/14/2016,"Here for a family member's birthday dinner on a Friday night. Although reservations aren't allowed, they let us call 30 minutes prior to arrival to be added to the wait list. When we got here we waited barely 10 minutes! The place is packed with the weekend dinner rush so waiting 10 minutes is a win in my opinion. Our table was extremely sticky. Not a pleasant feeling.  It is good for large groups, lots of choices for everyone. Since the menu is endless, our waiter was helpful with recs. He was also attentive to refills for our drinks. I got the Chicken Parmesan per his recommendation. Substituted the broccoli for mixed vegetables. I was hoping it would at least be decent. I didn't finish the dish. It's extremely salty. I sampled other dishes (New Orleans Jambalaya and Clam Chowder). Both were also very salty. The fried calamari tasted old and over fried. With such an extensive menu from a chain restaurant, I expected quality would be subpar. Prices are pretty steep for the quality that you'll get. I mean it does tell you something when they give out promotions like ""$10 off $35"" deal.  They give free birthday pizookie. Best part of the meal! I've tried to replicate this at home cookie, but it's just not the same :(  There were a couple of pros (pizookie!) scattered throughout the experience so 3 stars from me. I wouldn't recommend to others though. I'll be back if someone else wants to come here."
Hardik S.,"Sugar Land, TX",101,1,,1.0,10/14/2017,Waited for a full hour for takeout that should have been ready. Ordered at 7:30 for pickup at 8... Waited whole hour and 9pm and order still not ready. Terrible ordering system fix it please or you will lose long time customers very quickly who won't be as patient
Sami A.,"Richmond, TX",229,56,25,1.0,6/18/2017,"The pazookie everyone dies over can be made at home a lot better and a lot cheaper. The food is over priced. It's a high school homecoming night kind of place so try to avoid it when these high school students are prone to be there.  Went again a second time and the servers just stood around and stared at people walking in to be seated. The servers stood around and conversed with no worries about their patrons. Please have mercy on the adults at least, the high school students take that bs thinking it's on par with a steak house or something but we ain't them so please step up the management and learn how to run a real restaurant. It's okay though y'all are just on par with that chillis down 59 near Lexington."
Rob C.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",0,10,5,5.0,8/26/2017,This was a great dinner experience.  And Branden V attended us with great and fast service.  Had the Mahi Mahi tuna salad.
Anonymous M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,9,,1.0,7/12/2017,"I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. Worst service ever. The server was so rude for no reason, she was flat out mean. (After being seated for about 15 minutes, she finally came to us and was rushing us to order because she wanted to leave to go home from her shift- the restaurant doesn't close for another two hours!!) We asked very politely to speak to the manager, only to find out that the manager is rude and doesn't care either. We left without eating.  Bottom line: don't come here to eat."
Sergio M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2017,So I got fed plastic tonight which came in inside my grill cheese and ham sandwich. And when I talked to the manager which toke him like 15-20 minutes after the incident he just tried to make a joke out of it which just made me more upset about the whole thing. So at all cost avoid the sandwiches bc you'll just might find plastic inside it. The only good thing about the night was that the bartender Eric was very apologetic more than his manager.
Jeremiah M.,"Rosenberg, TX",100,270,703,3.0,9/12/2017,"The food is really good but the service is lackluster. Do not take a large party there, larger than 6 people. They can't seem to handle larger orders on multiple tickets. My best experience has been with six people or less. They are open late, which is good."
Lara P.,"Richmond, TX",0,11,,1.0,10/1/2017,"With all the great restaurant choices in Sugar Land, chose somewhere else. It is obvious the problem is lack of management. The service is painfully slow and you have to pull teeth to get anything. The food is below average / gross. Bottled dressing, cheese that looks like it is from a can, not enough dressing on the salad, food comes cold. The bathrooms are falling apart and I drank a lot of water and had to go a lot. Asked someone three times if they could refill the toilet paper in the restroom. I haven't seen a response to these comments either so no one gives a hoot."
Eryn C.,"Sugar Land, TX",6,17,5,2.0,1/22/2017,"I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from a big chain restaurant, but this was a very disappointing lunch. We were seated immediately and asked our drink order. That was good! Ordered apps and they came out fast as well, but didn't taste amazing. We ordered: mac n cheese for my daughter, soup and salad combo for my husband and seared ahi salad for me (trying to order ""lite""). My daughters macaroni was $6 for microwaved kraft dinner. My husband's entree cane out before the rest of our food. My $16 lunch salad came out with my ""seared ahi tuna"" completely frozen. Like tuna ice cubes! Definitely not worth the price.  We waited 15 minutes after we'd finished our food before we finally saw our waiter again and got the check, then waited another 10 before I left the money on the table and walked out. I heard another waitress proclaim as she walked by my table that she ""just did not give a shit"". Saw a different table get up and find a manager to ask about taking heir drink order.  Not the best lunch place by far."
Asad H.,"Miami Beach, FL",1,1,,5.0,9/14/2017,I came into Bj's Today and I had the best experience in the world. My server Annalisa was the best server ever. Great service and super funny! She brought everyone out super fast and neat! I always come to BJ's and I love their service here!!
Wendy T.,"Stafford, TX",269,293,844,4.0,8/28/2016,"I'm not a huge fan of BJ's, but the food is not bad. We had cheese pizza with jalepeno and nachos (but it seems more like a flatbread). The best part was the pizookie! There was a pizookie trio option for $9.95 which is a smaller portion of pizookie with ice cream, and we can select which pizookie flavors we like. My friend and I ended up ordering 2 pizookie trios and tried all 6 pizookie flavors! It was so good to taste all the different types! We tried the Monkey Bread (which tasted like an older cinnamon bun), the chocolate chunk (which was really chocolatey!), the white chocolate macadamia nut (yummy sweetness), peanut butter (which was ok), salted caramel (which was ok to me, but my friend's favorite), and the Cookies n' Cream (my favorite- the best out of the bunch). I would come back anytime just for the pizookie!"
Cary F.,"Spring, TX",9,112,50,5.0,8/28/2016,"I've celebrated 5+ birthdays at this location.  service has never failed me.  to-go service has never failed me. employees have never failed me. i've never had one bad service out of all of the times ive gone. i always recommend dinner times because their meals are substantial.  i wish i knew the name of the lady who has kids and has been working there everyday to buy christmas gifts for them and others. she's amazing. ugh... if only i knew her name. anyways, if you're visiting sugar land please visit this location."
Angie C.,"Government Hill, San Antonio, TX",0,6,9,5.0,8/26/2017,"Awesome service, Brandon V. was very attentive to our large party. I ordered the Ahi tuna salad and it did not disappoint."
Kevin Z.,"Houston, TX",0,19,12,4.0,5/25/2017,I have Celiac disease and never got sick from there food. Good food dessert good service. They have a Decent amount of gluten-free options not a lot but some and it's Good.
Haley R.,"Richmond, TX",0,4,,5.0,9/5/2017,"Decided to come here for lunch with my mom, aunt, cousin and grandparents, and our server was Stefan. He was very patient, kind, and was on top of things! Soup and salads came out quick, and we always had full drinks. All the food came out hot and correct despite all the modifications."
