Naomi H.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,1,,5.0,5/20/2016,I love coming to this BJs. I have some food issues and the first few times we came here I wasn't able to eat my food and when I told my waitress Nikki that I couldn't eat it she was like no problem let's find something you can eat! The chef Shirley came out and we figured out something I could eat and then personally made my food! It was awesome! I'm a very picky person when I eat and eating here is always awesome! Best service always!
Meowston T.,"Houston, TX",4,29,23,3.0,5/28/2014,"Food is incredible, especially their gluten free pizza (for my health concern), but the service is very slow. It took 15 mins to bring us the bill... And we were in a hurry!"
Santhosh V.,"Chicago, IL",3,18,4,4.0,5/22/2015,"Jalapeño burger is a great standout.  To be fair, I always get it, because it's that good and haven't tried anything else"
Morgan K.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/29/2016,Went yesterday with my mother and we had a super sweet black girl as our waitress (I can't remember her name but she was awesome). Everything came out perfect. Still one of my favorite places to eat in sugar land.
Angi B.,"Houston, TX",8,38,,4.0,6/16/2015,"First time ever eating here.  My husband got jambalaya, great flavor with just enough kick. My daughter and i split the shrimp scampi pasta and it was amazing.  Didnt like the bread that came with it but the pasta was amazing. My daughter also had the broccoli cheddar soup. Appetizers we split calamari and honey sriracha brussel sprouts both were fabulous. Service was average but the food was good enuf to come back and deal with the average service. Just ordered a pizookie so waiting on that. If I could id give it 4.5 stars but yelp doesnt let you give half stars. Will definitely be coming back"
Pearl D.,"Westchase, Houston, TX",9,77,99,2.0,12/17/2013,"I like the food and overall menu selection. Service is horrible. Right off the bat, the hostess tells us that they are short staffed when we walked in and that the wait would be awhile so the staff could get ""caught up"" -- whatever that means. This is at 9pm Tuesday night. Did not even bother to properly greet us to begin with. Where is the manager???  I ordered the Turkey burger (good) bc I really wanted the wedge fries but it came out with regular fries instead. (Deeply disappointed). They said they would bring out the wedge fries for me no big deal-- but it NEVER came out. Bf ordered BBQ Bison burger. It didnt even have bbq sauce in it. Cole slaw is better at Church's. He would give his burger half a star. Our waitress (Megan) was rude and always in a rush and never attentive. She gave us menus and right away asked if we wanted to order appetizers. We looked at each other bc we didnt even get to open the menu yet and she said she would be back before we could even respond to her question.  It's been a while since we have been here, but now we remember why. We will be taking our business elsewhere. Plenty of options in Town Center."
Virginia M.,"Austin, TX",223,4,,5.0,9/30/2016,"So I have most definitely been back to this BJ's because it's a go-to place for my family but haven't written a review in 3 years. May I say that this experience was 150 times better than it has Ever been. I'm sorry for ever doubting you. I tried the Piranha Pale Ale at first which has an awesome name and the beer itself had great color but way too much sweet flavor which isn't necessarily wrong but not what I was looking for. No worries. I next tried the Hopstorm IPA. Much much more of what I was thinking and looking for. I ordered the Avocado rolls, the Root beer ribs, and some peppered boneless wings. All were incredibly delicious. The beer and the food never bothered me about this place before. It was the service. This time I saw 2 managers and both of them were extremely polite and made themselves present which I feel sets a great example. My server John F. was also awesome in more ways that one. Even though I could tell he was busy, he made great suggestions and never seemed stressed or frustrated. I understand too well how things can go from hero to zero in a stressful work environment. I just wanted to let this place know that I officially changed my mind about you. Thank you for being awesome."
Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",358,583,613,2.0,12/16/2013,"Only been to BJ's twice and my verdict is that's it over-hyped--Yep you heard right!!!! What's my complaint?  Just sit tight while I summarize my not-so-dynamite-bite: Although seating before 7 on a Friday was no hassle, the wait staff was getting hammered!!!! Everywhere I looked, the staff was briskly going from table to table trying to compliment guests and get orders out. However, going to the wrong table with an order defeats that gesture! Could it be that they got the order wrong because he or she doesn't use a notepad?!  At least in my instance it was because I receive an incorrect order not once, but TWICE!   The first order omitted my  request to add Blackened Shrimp to my Angel Hair Toscana, which looked like baby food. Poorly presented on plate with globs of angel hair and a few pieces of tomato sprawled onto the plate with dashes of olive oil. Not appetizing at all. Although the server apologized for the omission, I learned from one of my friend's mamas that you don't eat ugly food--and that Toscana was U-G-L-Y it had no alibi to be eaten for the price, so I sent it back and downgraded my purchase to a simple BJ Burger  with Bacon that my friend had ordered. Her burger looked decent and the steak fries she allowed my eat to keep my stomach from growling had a nice crispy golden crust that I appreciated, but  once my plate arrived, I was not impressed. Once again, the presentation was off for me: the meat patty was sliding to one side with a pillow rather than a bed of lettuce peeking out from the side. Other veggies looked smooshed under the bun. At this point, I wished I had convinced my friend to go to Smashburger across the street versus this massacre of fine ingredients that were being ill presented on this particular evening. Despite the sub par impression of my plate, my stomach had other desires--and that was to eat, so I decided to keep the burger and taste it. Nonetheless, my server had neglected to write down my request for mustard and burger sauce on the side. I received the ""burger sauce"" which was simply a BJ version of Big Mac sauce that was an epic failure. Secondly, I received mayonnaise instead of mustard, which further delayed me from eating my burger. By the time we flagged down our server, my burger was not hot, but at this point, I didn't care to send another entree back. I dealt with it and decided that my tip would demonstrate my dissatisfaction.   Really was town on giving my server a tip with so many errors. I parted with one dollar for a near $12 purchase since the change from my transaction was not given back to me. Although I am finicky, I do tip when I dine out because I sympathize with server wages, BUT crappy and inconsistent wait service should not automatically receive a tip. When you're almost tempted to ask to adjacent table for condiments because you cannot get a waiter's attention, I think the waiter staff needs help pronto!  Until then, BJ's gets the thumbs down and a  better luck next time if I decide to give them another chance in the future. Maybe their special spirits is tops, but their service as restaurant is not!  FYI; Google mobile deal until 4/30/2013: $5 off 20 purchase"
Sherrye R.,"Stafford, TX",1,27,,5.0,10/31/2014,Food and service today was great as usual! BJ'S does not disappoint!  The egg roll and stuffed mushrooms were yummy. The Turkey burger without the bun delicious. Megan our server was great!
Billy E.,"Missouri City, TX",0,60,1,4.0,3/10/2016,Good food. Broad selection of food. Great avocado roles and pizza. Good home brew. Lots of seating. Crowd can be an issue at certain time. Big bar area.
Veda E.,"Katy, TX",0,17,3,2.0,3/29/2016,The food was ok half cold half warm not even hot and there was 5 other tables with maximum of 3 in each so hmmm. The waitress just took out order and not once did she come back to see if we needed anything else ! She kept coming to the table next to us ... Literally like 5 times in 20 minutes and not once more than after the order!!! Personally I hate service like that !! I am paying also and a great tipper ... Anyway my last time here and no I don't recommend it if you look Latin or Middle Eastern even if your not !!!
Tenia O.,"Houston, TX",376,231,322,4.0,11/25/2013,"I really liked this location. Came here w/ a couple of my chicas. We sat in the bar area which is nicely set up in this location.  It was a very busy Sat. night, but the bartender was great! He quicky greated us & asked we give him a quick sec to finish up a large order. Once he was done, he took our orders w/ a smile & made great beer suggestion. I tried the Piranha, which is kind of a hoppy IPA. Pretty dang on good. The fact BJ's let's you have a sample of their specialty crafts is a bonus...in fact I think it's safe to say they encourage a trial run. Why let a customer order an entire pint, only to find they dislike it, then have to pour an entire serving down the drain??? Good marketing strategy IMO.  We also tried the Black & Blue Brewhouse Burger & also some of the corn & bacon fritters. The fritters were killer!!! The aioli sauce they come with has the perfect amount of spice. The burger was ok...but then again I'd just not too long ago had that burger from Stanton's so I may be giving an unfair comparison  :-) All in all I had a good experience at this location. For it to have been a very busy Sat. night, the service was top knotch! Will def visit again when I'm on this side of town."
Claudia A.,"Houston, TX",83,10,,1.0,1/16/2016,"Cannot begin to describe how annoyed I was at the horrible service when it came to any waitress or host. The only reason I keep coming back is because of their amazing pizookie's. Wish these people weren't so rude, if this place does not replace their staff immediately they will eventually close down because the service is just awful. What's a restaurant with great food but horrible atmosphere? Last Tuesday I was with my gal and we waited about 25 minutes to get served, and 10 minutes to get drinks, although it was simply water. Food came out after 30 minutes even though it was super slow, as you can see from previous reviews, I'm definitely not over exaggerating, their wait staff is trash."
Roxanne B.,"Houston, TX",2,8,1,5.0,3/13/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to go eat!  Everything I have ever eaten there was delicious; appetizers, entrees, desserts, everything!!  Also, if you like to try different beers and/or cocktails like I do, the bar menu is awesome!   Lastly, yeah you may have to wait a little while to be seated, but the service is always good.  I'd rather go to a busy restaurant than an empty one because that is a sign that the food is good!"
Erin D.,"Houston, TX",14,904,882,4.0,3/24/2011,"I really like this restaurant. I've been here twice in the last week for lunch due to its cheap prices. For $6, where else can you get a salad and a deep dish pizza (about 5-6in in diameter and 2in deep) at lunchtime? Both are decently tasting, and you can't complain too much for the price, especially since you'd pay about the same amount for a McDonald's ""extra value"" meal. I've also ordered the gourmet mac and cheese for curbside pickup. This location doesn't have dedicated parking spots for curbside pickup (like Chili's), but they will still come out to your car once you call. The mac and cheese alone didn't fill me up for lunch though, but it was cheap ($4.32 including tax). The mac and cheese are okay with bacon on top. It could use more salt and more cheese, like velveeta. Also, note macaroni isn't used; spiral pasta is used instead. Many moons ago I came here for dinner. Someone ordered an appetizers of nachos, which were ennormous. I ordered the baby back ribs, which comes with a BOWL of soup and baked potato. By the time I finished the nachos and huge bowl of clam chowder, I was full. I ended up taking the ribs and potato to-go; the poor waiter thought I didn't like the food, since I asked for the box before I started eating! So, even though the ribs were $18, it included a lot of food with huge portions, and I managed to make 5 meals out of it. I don't know if this is still the case with the ribs, but that's what happened a few years ago. I wouldn't mind coming here again!"
Allyson A.,"Cypress, TX",214,699,26,3.0,9/21/2013,"I love the food here and the large beer selection. The nutty brunette is always a favorite of mine and I get it every time! I just wish the customer service would be better. We went around 10:00 at night and sat in the bar area (party of 6). We sat for at least five minutes before I finally started waving my hands and then a waitress rolled her eyes at the hostess then came over. Great, this should be fun. She didn't greet us, made us feel like we were an inconvenience to her. Go for the food but don't expect great service. I've been several times over the years and that is one thing they haven't improved on."
Kwan U.,"Houston, TX",7,3,,3.0,3/1/2015,Everything was great except for the unprofessional hostess. She didn't greet us properly and she was rude to the host that sat us.
Ashleigh M.,"Houston, TX",176,75,85,4.0,10/13/2013,"This is my third time at Bj's ....first time at this location.  The hostess at this location was very rude and acted as if she couldn't accommodate a large party. The wait for 12 people was an hour... which was understandable since we didn't have reservations. However, after an hour of waiting on a busy Thursday we were seated and the waiter was right on time. I started with the a stuff spinach mushrooms.... yummy and the deep dish BJ'classic pizza (small)...not the best... majority of the pizza was bread. For $14 I won't get the pizza again. They have a number of burgers, pastas, salads, and different entrees to choose from. Overall, the BJ experience is great... beer and food you can never go wrong.  I just know my next visit will be a different entree at a differnt location.."
Heather S.,"Houston, TX",6,111,48,3.0,10/23/2013,"This used to be a nice place to come get good food, but recently not so much.  The past few times my husband and I have been there our tables were not clean (crusted on food, wet drink rings, etc). I know they are trying to get everyone seated quickly, but I've noticed that when one couple leaves, a guy takes a wet rag does a quick wipe and then we are seated. Then there is still food and the table is sticky/wet.  I can't complain too much about the food because it is usually pretty good. The waiters and waitresses not so great.. Not attentive to getting drinks or refills or even getting to the table in a timely manner after you are seated. Last time we were there, two groups of people sitting next to us got up and left because no one ever came to the table.  They need to get it together."
Ginny M.,"Sugar Land, TX",31,21,,3.0,12/19/2012,"Ok update, I had a few hours to kill, so I went for a couple glasses of wine and the lettuce wraps.  They were tasty, the shrimp, however, there was some confusion in prep, either leave the tails ON or off, they were somewhere in between and begged to be expelled. The service was attentive without being intrusive, there was a good vibe, another table had the brew sampler, and discussion was to be had.  Let me quantify, FOR Sugar Land, I'll take BJ's over Cheesecake Factory or Olive Garden for a non-drive through dining experience. Everything fresh, ""Chef Mic"" microwave is not ""cooking"" my meal.   If you want your socks knocked off you're going to have to drive in to town, Montrose or the Heights. For good food that honestly is not more expensive than say that abomination known as Red Lobster or any other chain out here that if you have friends, family to take out, or just didn't want to cook, it's a good option. as for the name, Lauren get your mind out of the gutter or stick just to the dark bars *LOL* some of us do not want ""rock and roll"" all the time!! Sorry I couldn't resist. To each his own and I could see that BJ's is not what the younger partying crowd would be drawn to nor do I think that's the type of business BJ's is vying for and that's what it's all about, attracting people with the disposable income to keep them in business. 'nuff said."
