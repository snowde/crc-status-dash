David W.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,11,,4.0,1/9/2017,Waiter was very welcoming and food was delivered in an appropriate time. Don't get the chocalate chunk or gluten free pazooki but the cookie and cream one is to die for. Only came for desert and it was exactly what I need to end the night.
Susan W.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,7,,3.0,3/11/2016,"I had the Parmesan chicken, hubby had Deep dish ziti, son chose the honey crisp salad with chicken. My dish was good, hubby's pasta was very tasty.  Son's salad was a fail. The lettuce had a pronounced taste of chemical wash, with cold and unappealing fried chicken. Couldn't eat it.  Our waiter was excellent, with a couple of funny jokes for us.   We'll be back, but won't order salad again."
Carmen D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/30/2017,"Our first visit tonight ..with many choices I gave my son for his 26th Birthday celebration  he picked BJ's. I had never thought to visit thinking that it was a sandwich shop!!! The menu offers a wide variety, from pizzas to burgers, steaks and beyond...we were 4 and everyone raved about their plates...shrimp tacos, quinoa spinach and shrimp bowl, and for my husband the most delicious and moist, packed with flavor pork chop...the food was delicious, flavorful and served fresh from the kitchen. Our server made our night much more memorable..friendly,energetic and on top of the game! no need to remind him of any of the multiple requests we had that he immediately provided....this doesn't happen often, especially on a Friday night. My husband enjoys his pork chop at pricey restaurants (Perry's) and was very impressed with his dish I knew it when he was hesitant to share a taste of it. We savoured  every bite. Thanks to Brandon for his impeccable service and drive. This is the place for us from now on, also very reasonable, considering the quality of the food...I spoke to the Manager because is usually the person I look for when the experience falls short...they deserved the 5 stars...I would choose ten if available considering we were there on a Friday at 7:00 when the restaurants can't manage to deliver this kind of service......Kuddos!!!"
Marianne A.,"Sugar Land, TX",33,79,411,4.0,10/7/2016,"This BJ's was the first one I'd ever tried and is the closest to me. The food is always pretty good, minus when they run out of pizookies. Parking is fine. There are a few spots in front of the building and plenty of spots next to the side. The only issue I have here sometimes is the service isn't always up to par. Sometimes we get a great waiter and then other times the waiters we get are very lazy and forgetful."
Curtis B.,"La Mesa, CA",13,10,5,5.0,10/26/2016,"Always a great experience at BJs no matter what town I'm in. Great service, great food and great beer selections."
Mereen J.,"Missouri City, TX",467,54,64,3.0,3/8/2015,"I'm not a chain restaurant type of gal but this BJ's has always been a great place! The first time I came here was probably in high school so back then the food seemed awesome! Nowadays, it's good for big groups and when everybody has different moods on what they want to eat.  Their burgers and pizzas are good and the beers selection is good! I also really like their fish tacos and calamari!  But honestly who comes here for anything besides the Pizookie?! The best invention yet! If you're a large party of eaters then et the Party Platter or for smaller appetites try the sampler version with 3 mini ones.  As far as flavors of course you should definitely get The Original b.k.a. Chocolate Chunk! The Triple Chocolate is pretty good and so is the White Macademia and The Peanut Butter! The other flavors can be a hit or miss at times but hey live a little and try them all!  Btw the wait here can be long so don't hope to come in last minute without having a wait!"
Vicente R.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,1,,5.0,9/28/2017,i highly recommend Brandon V as your server. he was very helpful and overall super friendly. great guy
D L.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,4,,1.0,5/26/2017,"First time visit this place. Very bad experience. Service was slow and unfriendly. Arrived before 12pm. It is not busy yet. I could see 70% of tables were empty. We waited 10 minutes before being seated. They forgot to serve the sauce that come with my dish. I had to ask for twice. It was served when our group almost finished the meal. The waitress was rude. She made face when we ask separate checks but did remind us: tip is not included in your check. Food is ok, meet chain restaurant standard."
Michelle L.,"Sugar Land, TX",3,14,4,4.0,6/16/2016,"Download their to get a free pizookie!!!  But... I ordered their chicken ceaser salad and in the middle of eating i noticed that it was so tangy! I could barely eat it! 3/5 stars for that. Their draft beer is okay, they have a wide selection for that."
Ada L.,"Sugar Land, TX",422,484,3164,3.0,9/23/2013,"Three-and-a-Half Stars, to be precise.  The $19.99 ""Party for Two"" deal including 2 soup/ salads, a medium deep dish/ hand toss pizza, plus a pizookie is such a steal!   Clam chowder is delicious; lots of clam meat; good flavor & consistency.  The chili is not bad; the bean makes it hearty.  Then, the boyfriend and I have shared a deep-dish ""Great White"" in Alfredo sauce with mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes and grilled chicken breast.  The medium-sized pizza is too huge for the 2 of us, and so we have a few slices taken home while saving room in the stomachs for the dessert!   The best comes last, the pizookie is here!!  Our red velvet pizookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream is soooooooo yummy!  Portion size is perfect for 2 to share!  The entire cookie has gone into our tummies and not even an itsy bitsy piece, or the crumbles, left in the pan!  Sweet tooth totally satisfied.  Happy Me! The only thing that I have found not good is the watermelon mojito.  Honestly, it just sux!  The flavoring is extremely artificial and gross, and the mojito is way too sweet and lacks alcohol *tsk tsk tsk*   Service is alright; the hostess is welcoming and friendly but our server is kinda slow, on a Sunday night while the restaurant is not busy at all."
Gary L.,"Houston, TX",3,106,12,2.0,9/17/2016,I usually like this place but their queso needs a lot of work. Was not impressed with quality and flavor was not good lacking in so many ways. Just because you melt cheese does not make it a queso.
D. A.,"Richmond, TX",0,5,,5.0,11/12/2016,I love this place! Can you say ZOOKIE COOKIE! Mmmmm...i suggest this restaurant...good food nice atmosphere
Chanel A.,"Houston, TX",151,77,34,3.0,12/19/2015,"I'm going to try to grade this review not based on the fact that my burger was not done properly initially and instead of remaking it they just haphazardly threw the correct toppings on what was then a cold beef patty and brought it back out with cold fries. Terribly disappointed. I tried the guacamole bacon cheeseburger which is one of the new specialty items. The guacamole was great and the only good thing about the burger. The bacon was not cooked all the way (raw pork- smh), nor were the toppings that comes on it fresh (pepper jack cheese, tomato, jalapenos, chipotle mayo).  Moral of the story stick to the pizza and hops! You can't go wrong!"
Jacquar F.,"Houston, TX",130,206,296,5.0,2/19/2015,"I'm not even sure where to start this place was outstanding from start to finish. Tonight was my first time here and I was impressed, first walking in the restaurant we were immediately greeted by the hostess and she was able to find seats for us very quickly. The waitress we had I think her name was Rebecca, she was amazing and she went above and beyond my expectations. She was very knowledge able of the menu and she helped me make my selection.  I had beer and pizza since that was two of the things they were known for, and I made the right chose the beer was very good and the pizza was outstanding! I can't wait to return"
Kurllenne M.,"Fresno, TX",67,58,16,5.0,9/24/2016,"Great time! Wonderful customer service, the libations were delicious and the pizza and queso was wonderful. Watched the Texans game and happy hour was still going on! Will be back!"
Liz L.,"Brownsville, TX",0,4,,4.0,5/6/2017,"I've been here several times & I really like the atmosphere, the food & the service.  I've brought my husband & friends & we haven't had bad experience. Keep the smiles waiters & keep the area clean & most of all keep the great food recipes."
D T.,"Houston, TX",3,35,11,5.0,3/22/2017,"Been at this location several times previously and always had mediocre service but not tonight!  Chace took great care of us!  Attentive, friendly, and pleasant. Will definitely be back!"
Lan N.,"Houston, TX",146,174,688,1.0,11/3/2014,"The food here is atrocious, everything was pretty nasty down to the drinks. Service is ok but our waiter was overbearing, he kept coming back every couple minutes to see if we were done... Couldn't even have a decent conversation because he seemed annoyed we were taking up table space."
Lynda T.,"Richmond, TX",7,40,14,5.0,8/15/2016,Had lunch here today and our server Brittni was awesome. She was very friendly. The hostess lady that took us to our table was nice as well. All of our dishes came out at the same time and the wait was minimal from the time we placed our orders. I have only visited this location and the Katy location on i10. The Sugar Land location is so much better than Katy! Had a horrible experience with Katy location and will not return there.
Sam K.,"Rosenberg, TX",7,66,58,4.0,9/15/2016,I like BJ's.  It's my go to place for good beers and fat pizzas. It's a chain place so call me a sellout. I don't care. I like the pizza. I like the salads. Maybe not the salads. But I like the wings. Good food at decent prices and a beer to go with it. What more can you ask for?  Hasta!
