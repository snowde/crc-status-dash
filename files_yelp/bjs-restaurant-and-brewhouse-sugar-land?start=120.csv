Lucas H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,2.0,9/14/2016,"SLOOOOOOOW Seriously slow service, wasn't even busy. Food was BJ'S food, nothing crazy but you won't die"
Susan H.,"Richmond, TX",0,22,3,3.0,10/31/2015,Nothing that stands out an average restaurant that people go to for the name but the food was plain even by cocktail was plain.  The waiter couldn't recommend anything whether it be the food or the drinks
Saba E.,"Houston, TX",590,578,143,3.0,8/28/2014,"So, a friend was dying for something called a Pizooki...? Apparently, it's a Sugar Land gem, and since I don't live in Sugar Land, I agreed to go with her. We, ambitiously, each ordered a Pizooki. I ordered a S'more pizooki and my Friend ordered a regular cookie with ice cream. And, this evening was clearly a case of our eyes being bigger than our stomachs...we did not finish our pizookis.   We supplemented this with some spring rolls to feel less like children. Those were good...just ask for tamarind sauce with them instead of the weird avocado sauce.  So, I've had a pizooki now, but unless I'm stuck in Sugar Land and need a loud place to eat, I probably won't be back."
Christopher B.,"Stafford, TX",36,97,5,4.0,1/13/2016,Pro: One of the best burgers I've ever had. Friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Clean Cons: The place was not to crowded but took a good 5-10 mins before a waiter even stopped and acknowldeged us.
Bob O.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,63,,5.0,9/29/2016,"Thursday September 29, 2016 1:45PM: Just left. Hostess was friendly and knew where my daughter was sitting. Great service, ask for Stefan because he's on the ball. Fish and Chips was good plus the large portions came to the table hot. Appetizers were good. The manager contacted me after the previous review and said that he would fix it. Looks like he did.  ZERO stars. Food is 50/50 crap shoot. Service is always slow. The last time that we ate here the service was CATASTROPHICALLY POOR. We were IGNORED for 30 minutes before we got a glass of water, while other customers came in got their food, ate and left before we got our cold food . We finally got the manager to the table and she didn't appear to be too concerned that we were not happy. it took us 1.5 hours to eat. Complained to the manager again when we left and received the second dose of 'I don't give a shit' ATTITUDE. I left her with my crystal clear message that we WOULD NOT BE BACK!!! Wrote BJ's corporate when we got home, tagged it with a delivery receipt (it delivered) and NEVER received a reply. I would eat a bologna sandwich before I would step foot in this hole again."
Almond B.,"Houston, TX",0,14,17,1.0,7/30/2016,"Terrible experience tonight. Brussels sprouts were horribly overcooked, deep dish pizza was soggy (and that's ignoring the fact that we got BBQ instead of buffalo chicken), and apparently ""medium"" means ""well done"" now."
Jon R.,"Bay City, TX",32,52,13,1.0,1/3/2016,"Usually the service is fantastic. Usually the food is fantastic. Most of the time the beer is great.  Today was not one of those days. It was a busy Sunday, but we waited at our table for 30 minutes and hadn't got a drink yet. The waitress had our drinks on a tray, and stopped at other tables, chatted, took orders, everything other than giving us out drinks. She stood at the table next to ours and talked, left, cane back with a menu, talked more. All while holding our drinks, and not turning around and giving them to us. 30 minutes, and no drinks.  I won't be returning. Which sucks, because this is usually one of my favorite places."
Karry B.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,17,,2.0,5/15/2016,"Went into BJ's tonight for dinner and after 13 minutes without anyone coming to ask for our drink orders, we walked out...so sad that waiters/waitresses cause restaurants to lose so much money with their lack of customer service!"
Emmanuel M.,"Meadows Place, TX",147,116,141,3.0,6/20/2015,"Whenever I ate here, the service was always good and their food wasn't bad either. I haven't been here in some time, but their seasonal beers were always awesome! Being seasonal and made in-house, their beer selection is always changing; which is good. Their October beers were always my favorite!  Being vegan, they don't really serve anything I can eat anymore, hence my reason for not frequenting there as much. As often as I say I'll go in for a beer one day, the loud crowds always steer me away.  Good for groups and families, but if you're looking for a less populated place to just get a beer, I'd suggest going elsewhere."
Cathy E.,"Sugar Land, TX",33,22,3,5.0,7/4/2016,"BEST service yet!! EJ was amazing! The next time I come, if I can't sit in his section, I'll get it to go!"
TaShane H.,"Rosenberg, TX",190,114,116,3.0,10/4/2015,"This is a great hang out spot! Great drinks and a great social and kick back setting. The food, however, is very subpar. It sounds great in the menu and then you get it and it's like ""eh."" One example is the gourmet Mac and cheese, sounds delicious right? Negative. It's dry as all get out. Is there really cheese in there? One can only wonder.  On the drink side you can't go wrong. Not only do they have standard drinks but they have their drinks to choose from. But beware of bar seating, the service isn't too wonderful in the and you feel almost ignored. Just wait for a table, it'll be worth the wait."
Yoshi F.,"Missouri City, TX",0,13,7,2.0,1/9/2016,"I placed an order online for Baked Potato with add on cheese and bacon.. Plus sour cream and onions and all that goody stuff. I was really craving a perfect baked potato night. I came home with only the cheese and bacon.. No sour cream, no onions...  What's a baked potato without that??? NOTHING.  I called the manager and told him about my situation.. He said I could bring it back and he'll switch it for another one. He wasn't so sincere about it though, as if it was my fault, and not theirs.  Im already home.. Why should I have to make a double trip because they can't read an order online?  Guess I've learned my lesson and will always check my food before leaving."
Jenna K.,"Crowley, TX",73,10,,1.0,7/30/2016,Worst service I've ever experienced in my life. Been here 3 hours with a party of 10. Seen our server 3 times. Took over an hour to get our food and constant mess ups with orders and forgetting things. Never again.
Sheniqua W.,"Stafford, TX",337,74,260,3.0,4/7/2016,"I've been sick all week and had my mind set on BJ'S Tasty Chicken Tortilla Soup. My son was able to go and pick up a cup for me. Oh the Joy!!!! I felt like it was skimpy though. The way the tortilla chips were distributed in plastic container among the cheese already melting and missing my lime. Eventhough the presentation was off, it was still great. Kudos ""Yelp 100 Challenge"""
Christina Ann H.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",0,16,1,5.0,6/12/2016,They were extremely accommodating about my food allergies + in general. I already loved the food at BJ's but the salmon and couscous dish that I got was even more delicious than expected. Excellent food and service today.
Will W.,"Houston, TX",253,8,22,5.0,11/10/2015,"Great service John Mark was our server , he was very courteous and respectful. He kept our drinks full and was quick with our order. Excellent service and we will definitely drive back to this location."
Athenapex C.,"Houston, TX",41,671,574,4.0,7/18/2014,Great place for pizza and beer.  Unlimited fresh squeezed lemonade rocks.  They send you coupons too if you sign up for their BJ Rewards card.  Love it!  They also do a great fish and chips if you are craving fried fish.
Dea E.,"Sugar Land, TX",39,1,,1.0,7/11/2016,"This used to be one of our favorite restaurants, great food and waitstaff. Unfortunately, our last visit involved a gigantic roach crawling on the wall...like, wow. They adjusted our check for 25% off to appease us I guess but roaches? It's completely gross and unsanitary. We won't be returning."
Jesna T.,"Missouri City, TX",232,7,,5.0,7/11/2016,The food is really good here! The prices could be better but the food came out fast and hot. The servers are also really nice and pizookies were amazing!
C C.,"Chinatown, Houston, TX",14,80,218,4.0,4/23/2015,"American fare, the menu is huge. We were supposed to have a reservation but they did not have one at the hostess stand. They were still able to accommodate us. Our waiter was very friendly.  We had the appetizer platter. I was not able to eat most of it because I am avoiding creams and cheese.  I had the blt salad without cheese (it was good) and the 5 meat deep dish without cheese (the lots of meat and the crust was just right).  We finished with the large Pizookie (we got to choose 4 flavors).  Everyone needs a Pizookie."
