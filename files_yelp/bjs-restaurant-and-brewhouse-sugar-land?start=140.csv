Nikkia P.,"Stafford, TX",98,108,123,4.0,1/23/2016,"While trying to decide on a restaurant where I could find a dish that would meet the dietary requirements I needed that day, I thought about BJ's. I hadn't been there in a while and remembered that they had a nice variety so we gave it a go.  I selected from the Enlightened Entrees menu of low cal options. My choice was the North Beach Mahi Mahi & Shrimp with couscous, and since I don't eat shrimp I had to sub it and there wasn't much that I could have since I'm not much of a veggie eater but I was fasting from certain foods at the time. I chose to sub the shrimp for....wait for it....brussel sprouts lol! A fast can really open your mind up to some different ways of eating! The waiter says "" uh ok, yes ma'am"", and looks like I'm the dumbest person he's come in contact with all night. Yeah I know, I'm short changing myself on the price of the meal but I don't like shrimp. Go put the order in! After all was said and done, the food was really good. The fish was well cooked as well as the couscous & veggies were so flavorful with red peppers, olives, and spicy garlic. Might even be good with the shrimp, if you like that ;)"
Meghan V.,"Stafford, TX",5,1,,4.0,12/28/2015,"My boyfriend and I come here often to get the pazookis (spl?) but decided to grab a full meal one day. I got the clam chowder which was awesome, along with a baked potato which uniquely had Alfredo sauce in it. Everything in my meal was fantastic. My boyfriend really enjoyed the chicken wings he ordered which had the root beer sauce that they have been advertising. It was surprisingly really good. Our waitress Kemi was very helpful and attentive to our needs. My drink was never empty through the whole meal and she was extremely friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend asking for her on your next visit.  Don't forget to get a caramel pazooki for dessert!"
Ann J.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,19,9,3.0,5/22/2015,"Food is alright I felt, just your typical American meal BUT the highlight would be the pizokie DON'T go without trying pizokie!!"
Sharlene J.,"Richmond, TX",33,4,2,5.0,6/20/2016,Our waiter was great! And the avocado egg rolls were delicious and the pizza was the best!
Linda J.,"Cody, WY",22,24,11,1.0,3/29/2016,"Took my family to dinner tonight. The crispy artichokes came out a very...very dark brown....OK burnt! Sent them back second batch a hair better. Two had chicken fried steak. The potatoes were cold, the gravy was so thick that by the time the plate came to them,the gravy was like glue! Had to ask twice for more gravy. My Grandson had Chicken Alfredo that was very dry! Sauce was sparse and barely warm. I had fish and chips. The fish was so over cooked, as well as the fries. The tarter sauce was glazed over, probably under the warmer too long.I left mine behind! Service was poor at best and the Manager came through spoke to the people in front of us .They complained that they had waited over an hour for their food as well as we had. He stopped at our table asked how our meal was and whisked off before I could say anything.  I stopped at the reception area on our way out ,where 3 employees were chatting  and told them how bad our meal and service was .I was told to @have a nice evening "" I rarely complain but this was the worst experience I have had dining out! I will not be returning....ever!!!!!!"
Verna R.,"Houston, TX",7,9,4,2.0,3/7/2015,"Food is good, decently sized and priced.  Only reason this place gets 2 stars is the service. Walked in at 11 pm on a Friday night, and the host was literally on his phone for a good couple of minutes & didn't even acknowledge us. Took a waiter to tell him we were standing there to get menus and seat us. Half apologetic, he walked us there. Took FOREVER to place our entree order... Almost finished a round of beverages and our appetizer before he came to take our order. & this gentleman did not look busy. Anytime I've been to this location, host stand was just terrible. Get a new staff or retrain. Because they really are important to how the rest of the night will go for a guest."
Tea P.,"Houston, TX",274,58,21,1.0,6/1/2015,"8 adults, 4 little kids.  We were separated into two different tables, we asked for our group to be seated together and they said they couldn't accommodate.  But five minutes after we were seated a table of 12 teenagers came in there were able to fit the whole big group into one table.  Are we suppose to separate ourselves from our 1 year old babies? Are babies able to feed themselves at the other table?  Why they were unable to accommodate our party? I don't know. We ordered appetizers.  Brought out our appetizers, asked for small plates.  Took them at least 15 minutes it not more to bring out the plates. By the time they brought out our small plates we were already done with our appetizers.  Asked for ice tea refill, took over 10 minutes.  I'm not gonna continue this review because I believe I wrote enough.  I tip well for good service, most likely we are gonna be gratuity will be already charged. If it was a smaller group I probably would leave a bad tip because they did not deserve it... AT ALL.  The restaurant was not busy.  Food is always tasty and on point. No complaints there."
Daniyal K.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,17,16,2.0,9/21/2015,"The only reason I would ever come here is to eat a pizookie. The food isn't that bad either but the waiters are usually rude and uptight about everything. One time I went with my friends and only ordered pizookies. It took our waiter, Jason W, AN HOUR to bring our pizookies. I was really disappointed."
Linh N.,"Plano, TX",442,678,650,3.0,1/30/2014,"Most of the food I've had from the pizzas, sandwiches, to pzookies have all been good. I never had a bad experience with any of the food. My favorites are the buffalo chicken pizza, grilled chicken pasta, and the angus beef sliders with wedge fries.  Though I like the food I feel like it's pretty expensive for what it is. I believe most of the things on the menu can be just a few dollars cheaper.  I usually only come here when others suggest or want to go. Since the menu's pretty versatile, it's a great place for groups.  I would avoid coming here during peak hours especially weekend nights."
David C.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,5.0,2/18/2016,"With three of my favorite ex students: Sangay, Yamaleth and Paul.  Had such a great time reminiscing.  I'm so proud of their success!"
Tiffany C.,"Houston, TX",301,286,601,3.0,1/10/2014,"Eureka! I've discovered the recipe for the perfect deep dish here at BJ's. The mini results in a tiny fluff of dough with toppings just drizzled on. The large will give you a not-so-deep deep pizza since everything is so widely spread out. In short, if you're gonna order a deep dish here, go with the personal or small size."
Wilfred S.,"Missouri City, TX",99,83,,2.0,11/25/2014,"I feel almost hypocritical giving this only a 2 star as I've come here at least 20 times, but only because it's opened till really late, my friends like the place, and they have TVs for sports game. I honestly don't think anyone really comes here because they think the food is fantastic. Don't take me wrong, the food quality isn't bad. But if I wanted to pay $20+ to get kind of full, there's lots of other places I can go to with much higher quality. Everything is supremely overcharged, and the service is just meh.  The only redeeming thing to this place is the pizookie (you get a free one on your birthday) which is absolutely delicious.  Other than that, BJ's is simply an overrated big name that people will still go because of name recognition."
Leslie T.,"Houston, TX",170,588,263,4.0,9/1/2013,"This place was packed on a Sunday after church. So the 5 of us elected to sit at the bar for a couple drinks and some clam chowder. It was a wise choice as we had a wonderful bartender who gave us tastes of all their home brews. A couple of us consider ourselves beer snobs and we enjoyed all the free tastes we got from her. Had I not already been drinking vodka gimlets I certainly would have had a couple of those selections. And I do plan on going back for a few another time. If you like locally brewed beers and want to try some tastes, please stop by and sit at the bar for some here. They had large screen TVs and full menu service at the bar. The menu looked terrific. But because we were on our great clam chowder hunt that day we stuck to our plan and each ordered clam chowder. You can get it in a bread bowl or a regular bowl. It was fantastic! I really wasn't expecting it to be as it's kinda like a fancy Chili's or step sister of Houston's. Ya know? But it was rich cream and loaded with clams. Of all our clam chowders that day THIS was the best.  The service was top notch, the noise level was not unbearable -even as packed as it was. Parking can be trouble when they are busy."
Vivianna A.,"Houston, TX",75,80,36,3.0,1/2/2016,"Called at 2 pm on a Monday to ask for a reservation for 7 pm for 6 people, was told they don't take reservations for less than 8 and since it was a Monday we wouldn't need one. That was a lie. Got there right at 7 and wasn't seated till 7:43 cause it was so busy. Apparently there was a pizza special and a football game so that's why it was packed. They ran out of all the pizzas that were on sale so that was a little annoying. Service was fine, food took too long to come out. Overall it was a mediocre trip."
Jonetta C.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,7,,1.0,11/8/2016,"The food here is good but the service and the hostesses are maddening. 95% of the time they bring tea but no sweetener so they have to go get that and show up 10 minutes later . The hostess/ host staff always finish their conversations before acknowledging the customer. Tonight we had to wait for acknowledgement again with two at hostess station. They had no idea which tables were available and had to walk the floor and then go back two more times for a look to see if there was a table available. Told us it would be five minute wait to clear tables. Said we could be seated in booth in bar - so we were going to , to only to find it was not cleared . It is disgusting to see so many dirty tables."
Kiera B.,"Houston, TX",668,77,87,5.0,12/12/2014,"Where to begin? Where to begin? How about AMAZING!!!! We arrived and was greeted and seated immediately. NO WAIT ( and yet the parking lot was packed) The resturant was filled with people who seemed to be enjoying themselves so I was more than happy to enter this atmosphere. We were sat and given menus and waited, and waited, and waited for a server to come to the table. Typically I'm a stinker about that but the service after this point was very well. It was my first time there so I gave the waiter the fifth degree about everything. What to drink, what to eat, etc. She was more than helpful. Suggested the strawberry mojito to get ""more bang for your buck"" (looking out for my pockets!) It was DE-lish-ISSSS. (say it like it's spelled).  We bonded over my love for pizza and she demanded I try theirs and I must say YAAAASSSSSS. It was like I took a bite of handmade pizza from angels. I think I had an outter body experience. Bottom line the pizza was the bomb(dot)com. It came within a reasonable time frame and was beautifiully presented. (which isn't that hard, pizza is already sexy) To finish it off I got the infamous pizzooki and I must say it was cool but simply it was diabetes in a skillet. My soul just couldn't take it.  Over All I love this place, and you should too. Don't sleep on BJ's, we all got time for that ""que sweet brown voice over"""
Brandi B.,"San Leon, TX",20,6,3,5.0,5/6/2016,"First time here and was very impressed! Our server was really on top of it! Her timing was great with us, she seemed to be in the zone and observing around it seems to be that way with the whole staff!! Great job. I ordered the turkey burger(minus the cranberries and Dijon) and it was so good! I couldn't believe how juicy the turkey patty was. Husband got a personal supreme deep dish pizza, YES the dough was cooked evenly! We will be back!"
Ramona N.,"Missouri City, TX",0,9,,5.0,5/4/2016,"Our favorite restaurant for so many reasons. To begin, the friendly hostess Gabby always welcoming patrons and accommodating seating preferences and servers. One server in particular is Nikki. For as long as my husband and I have been coming here it is hard to not notice Nikki's big smiles and passion for her work. Regarding, the menu there are great choices for all palates. As all the dishes come out appearing appetizing and the taste is even better. And last but not least, I always notice one man in particular asking patrons table to table how their dining experience has been. With a great smile that always makes you feel welcome back. His name is John and he is the manager.  We can choose anywhere to eat in Sugar Land, but we continually find ourselves coming back to BJ's Sugar Land."
Dayo S.,"Houston, TX",0,6,1,5.0,5/1/2016,My in laws took me and my wife for our birthdays here .. I had the jalapeño burger and wedges .. It was good plus the atmosphere was nice .. I would eat here again ..kinda pricey but what do you expect in sugar land
Linda K.,"Longboat Key, FL",0,20,3,5.0,4/3/2016,"Excellent food. Had the Bison burger. Very good service. When we come to Houston, this is a must stop place. It's always been good. Thx."
