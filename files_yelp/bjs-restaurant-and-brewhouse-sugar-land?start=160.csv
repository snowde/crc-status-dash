Tarannum K.,"Dallas, TX",4,30,3,1.0,8/18/2016,"Ok.. So we were a group of 17 people and I asked my sister to make the reservation ahead. When my sister called they said its late for a reservation but they will consider it as a call ahead. My sister showed up at 8:10 and they said it will take 20 minutes to set the table up. By 8:30 16 people were at the bjs waiting for the table. I asked The receptionist and she told us to wait another 10 minutes. We were in a very happy mood and were waiting for our table. We checked with them after 10 minutes of wait. Finally at 9:00 pm they were ready to seat us in two groups and not at a one big table. That is not what we asked for! Also they did not tell that thing to us when we were waiting for that long. If we would have known about the arrangement, we would have gone to some other dinner place with a better customer service. I spoke to the manager Davis and the lady supervisor about joining the tables. Without even looking to see how many tables were available, the manager denied to seat us together. He had no reasoning to his answer as it was a weeknight and the place was pretty empty . We had people in our group coming from San Antonio and outside of the country. We told this to him and he was very much non accommodating! I went back to the staff and requested her to come with me to the area and see how many tables were empty! She did come with me and seat us together on one big table joining couple of them! May be the manager and supervisor needs to change positions with the serving staff. Our server was great too! Food was good but the management attitude was very bad! The supervisor only said sorry once in the whole conversation. Davis dint stand for it nor did he apologize. The staff was good. The food took forever to come out. I had made my sister come down from Katy location but looks like none of us , nor our group gonna  go to BJs anymore!!!!"
Ashley P.,"Sugar Land, TX",18,72,42,3.0,2/26/2015,"Really girls? Bj's..... AGAIN? Oh well, it's on the way to their gymnastics and we get there during happy hour so I get my wine fix and order from the happy hour menu. Service this last time was just ok. Dude didn't seem very happy to be serving us. Next time will request Henry."
Jennifer M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,7,,4.0,12/5/2014,"Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews. The menu is extensive, the pizzas are delicious and the pizzookies are to die for! I have come here several times at different times during the week and the kitchen has never messed up our food. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the food takes a while. I think this is because our servers always have way too many tables, I usually count between six and ten. Hopefully management sees this and fixes it. I know its not the server's fault as I am one myself. But besides that I love this place."
Denise P.,"Missouri City, TX",139,24,27,1.0,3/11/2016,"Waited over an hour for our buffalo burger. Dry and the ""salad"" it came with was very dry. Not sure I would come back. Sad, cause the beer was good."
Matthew L.,"Sugar Land, TX",121,252,79,3.0,6/11/2013,"I've had wildly differing experiences here - some awesome, some not so much.  All mostly due to the service.  While I've had some great wait staff before, like I did last night, my bad experiences do stick out in my mind.  I'll just leave it at that for a warning. Otherwise, this place is a good choice for casual dining.  Great pizza, beer, and pizookies.  If you stick to those, you'll always have a great meal!  For pizza, I'd recommend the chicken bacon ranch - it's excellent!  Stray away, though, and it can be hit or miss."
Gregg S.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,15,1,5.0,3/7/2016,Went during lunch on a Sunday. Got seated right away. Didn't have to wait for long for food. Alexis was very friendly and helpful. Great member service!
Mia R.,"Hockley, TX",0,14,15,1.0,7/31/2016,"Let's just say the restaurant was nice. However, the service that was given to us was extremely poor. It was 8 of us that attended for the dinner. Our waiter name was Lawrence (Caucasian guy covered in tattoos). I'm not sure if he was having a hectic day, but he did not care for our table at all. When we ordered our food and drinks he acted as if we were all talking to him at one time. He will continue to say ""hold on , let me take everything down"".  This man never checked on our table to see if how our food was or to see if we needed anything else. Lawrence paid more attention to the table across from us. He would literally refill all their drinks quickly, constantly check on them. Maybe Lawrence wasn't in a good mood, because he would continuously walk past our table and give us a quick glimpse and did not say a word to us. My friend had to get the manager twice because we were not getting any assistance. Once the manger came to our table apologizing for her employee behavior. The manager was extremely nice she got all our tickets ready so that we can leave. Crazy thing is, Lawrence added extra drinks and food to our table bill. Once the manager was getting the ticket I have not received my food, at this point  it's been a whole hour. The manager was able to take my food off my ticket for the wait. This was probably the worst experience I have ever had at this restaurant. We will never come here again due to one employee treating his customers poorly. Mind you it was 8 of us , he defiantly missed out on a big tip!"
Hayden M.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,13,,4.0,3/25/2016,"Been here twice in the past few days.  Best experience I've had in awhile. They've really gotten their act together. Foods really good and the service, which was really bad is great. I had Alexis serve me and it was awesome kudos big time  Was here again last night.  Kimmy our server was great.  Food is always good"
My V.,"Houston, TX",173,17,28,2.0,7/17/2015,"""Maybe this time won't be as bad as last time..."" Nope. I've come here about five times over the past few months and each time has been SO disappointing. Horrible service and long waits for EVERYTHING. I understand that they're one of the more popular places in the Sugar Land area (especially since it's so close to Town Center and the mall), but goodness...if you're gonna make your guests wait so long for a table, at least give them good service. Servers always take around 10 minutes to come greet you and take your drink order. After that, it takes another 10-15 minutes just to get your drink (I ordered a water each time). The last time I went, I ordered a strawberry mojito and it took 20 minutes to come. I get that the bar can be a bit hectic but keep in mind that this was a Tuesday night and the place wasn't that packed. Then, as soon as our server drops our drinks off, they're gone. GONE. I always have to flag down my server just so I can put in my food order. So beware - it will take you approximately 20-30 minutes before you can actually order your food. Then after we were done eating and ready to go, the server was nowhere to be found. After about 10 minutes, she showed up and we asked her to split it since we were all paying separately. All we ordered were 3 waters, 3 drinks from the bar, and 2 desserts...yet it took forever for her to bring the checks to us, forever to pick up our checks after we put our cards/money in there, and forever for her to bring it back for us to sign. I don't suggest coming here if you're looking for a quick meal AT ALL. Now the food...their pizookies are absolutely DELICIOUS. I've tried almost every one and have loved them all! Their appetizers and main dishes are all pretty tasty too! Don't get the fried beignet though, it's not that great. I was expecting it to be similar to fried ice cream, but it just tasted like a cinnamon bun. Overall, the service is horrible but the food is worth it."
Vincent N.,"Sugar Land, TX",174,32,25,2.0,7/18/2015,Bj's is much better than before. But still not what I expect from these types of restaurants. First our server is still slow. Got here at 10:00pm and he only has 4 tables to serve. Restaurant has a good amount of people here though. And it's been hard to find him. Other thing is the need to pay more attention to the restroom. The trash is over flowing with paper on the floor in the restroom. Lastly there is still a 15 min wait at 10 pm. With at least 15 tables open. Never had to wait at any other restaurants open this late. Food is still good though. Love the new menu. Now let me add one more thing. Only a table of 2! I am waiting for 10 min since I asked for the check! I have my rewards so I am waiting for him just to apply it so I can pay on my phone!! It has been 10 min!! Now 13 min got check but no to go boxes
Kristine N.,"Denver, CO",506,1041,58,3.0,10/6/2014,"Service was iffy. Appetizer came out after the meal did and our server just didn't seem very attentive. The pulled pork green chili fries were delicious, had a bit of a kick. I ordered the kale and brussels sprouts salad which was really good but it was missing brussels sports. Had to ask three different servers where the heck the brussels sprouts were to finally get some. Had grapes and craisins which were a nice touch. My co-worker ordered a club sandwich and said it was decent."
Jeanae K.,"Sugar Land, TX",32,57,22,3.0,10/13/2013,"This place is okay. My girlfriend and I went at an odd time during the day when they weren't very busy so the service was good and we received plenty of attention from the waiter.  We ordered Thai Wontons, Buffalo Wontons, flat bread pizza and Thai lettuce wraps. The buffalo wontons with the dipping sauce taste exactly like buffalo wings from Buffalo Wild Wings or any place else that has the traditional buffalo sauce. Thai wontons and Thai lettuce wraps were the business. A nice sweet sauce with just the right amount of spice. The wraps had shrimp that was cooked quite nicely. The flatbread wasn't anything to brag about and I wouldn't get it again. I think it needed more sauce. So next time maybe I'll try a deep dish or traditional pizza.  This place remains me of Chili's but with an even larger menu. It's hard to select just one item."
Amanda R.,"Pearland, TX",0,7,4,5.0,2/3/2016,"We had the best waitress! She's been in pearland two weeks from Waco and pearland is lucky to have her! She was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. Awesome experience!! The jambalaya is great- a bit spicy but full of flavor. This review was for the location in pearland at 11200 Broadway St, Suite 1700, Pearland, TX 77584"
Julianne Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",280,301,401,4.0,7/6/2013,"I have come here on multiple occasions with my family and it is a great place to eat. It is a huge restaurant with a bar that has tons of tv screens to watch games, as well as a huge dining area for large groups to sit.  The service is a bit on or off here. Sometimes I get a great server and other times, I get an extremely lousy one. This is the only part of this place that I wish they would change.  In terms of the food, it is huge portions, very similarly to the CHeese Cake Factory. They have great hamburgers and the choice between thin and wedge fries (go wedge!). The pizza is really good too although the deep dish isn't real deep dish pizza (I went to school in Chicago haha) And of course, they are known for their pizookie desserts which are cookies baked in pans and topped with ice cream and whipped cream. Usually they are too sweet for me but if you get the Oreo one, it is actually quite well balanced. Specifically, the jalapeño burger is amazing and the spicy meatball deep dish pizza has crust that I will actually at. Perfection! Prices at this place are pretty decent and usually there is so much food, I can bring back another meal for the next day."
Emily P.,"Sugar Land, TX",3,15,1,3.0,8/8/2014,"I had the chicken club with crispy fries. It was great! But not worth the super long wait we had to have. Service is poor, and takes a very long time. The food was good, but if I had a choice to go back, I wouldn't jump on it right away.  However. The pizookie was AMAZING. And I don't know how I ever lived life without one."
Jennie N.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,16,55,2.0,7/21/2014,Went here with family and was disappointed. I ordered a deep dish and it was covered in burnt garlic. We had to send two of our orders back because of error and the rest were just average. The staff was very nice and attentive with our orders but I'm sad to say that we won't be returning.
Corinne F.,"Sugar Land, TX",26,296,217,5.0,9/13/2014,"Went for lunch. Prices and food were really outstanding. Our waitress was helpful, friendly and attentive. She made the visit complete. I love being treated well when I'm spending my hard earned cash.  I love a good deal.  This will be on my go to list for lunch.  Her name was Elizabth R.  She knows the menu and is honest with her suggestions. High recs for this place."

Melissa R.,"Reno, NV",0,8,10,3.0,12/15/2015,Food was horrible BJs usually has great food but it tasted terrible. I got soup and salad and the soup was bad. Made me sick.
Taylor B.,"Houston, TX",74,78,66,3.0,1/19/2013,"We all come her for the Pizzookies. I came here recently with a group of friends. The restaurant offers a wide variety of foods, but the real winner is their pizza's. Sugar Land has a lot of great places to get a New York style pizza, but for deep dish lovers there just isn't as many options.  The staff is always friendly but they do take a long time to get the food out to you even when they're not busy. The real selling point is the pizzokies which is under cooked cookie dough with ice cream on top. It's something anyone can make at home, but who doesn't love being waited on. Over all it's great place with awesome deep dish pizza if you're in Sugar Land try em out."
