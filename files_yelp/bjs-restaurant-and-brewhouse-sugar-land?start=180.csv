Sarah M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,8,7,2.0,7/30/2016,"This is the first time we have had a bad experience at BJs. We had a reservation for 15 at 9PM. We weren't seated until 930PM. We were the only large party there at the time. We got our drinks in a timely manner and three other large parties showed up. It took nearly an hour for us to able able to order our meals. The other three large parties got their meals before us. One of the people in our group didn't even get their food and eventually the manager gave it to her to-go. It took 45 minutes for our cards to be processed. During this time the other three parties got their desserts and checks and left. Once we got the checks back we were STILL waiting on our dessert. We asked for it to be taken off of our checks. We wanted to go home. It took ANOTHER 30 MINUTES to get our checks back. They tried to appease us with small coupons for a free pazookie AFTER you but a $10 entree. Pathetic. The waiter was working hard, but towards the end I get like he just gave up trying for us. Especially after every other large party had left and the restaurant was nearly empty. I didn't even want to ask for a to go box in fear of how long that would take. Overall, it was a terrible, FOUR HOUR experience just trying to get dinner tonight, which is the first ever at BJs for me."
Neva G.,"Houston, TX",36,21,1,3.0,6/19/2014,"Came here a couple of weeks ago and was disappointed in the wait staff. Just slow and pokey.  The food was very salty to me.  I'll say that the food may have tasted that way to me because I've been eating so clean lately so just a tad too much of salt is too much for me.  Now, if you are wanting to eat something sweet and not so healthy they have this desert called the pozookie - this thing is delicious!!! It's worth coming here just for the pozookie if your wanting a great desert!"
Kulvinder B.,"Sugar Land, TX",100,56,52,4.0,5/24/2015,"A chain restaurant but a good selection of food, like Ted vegetarian choices. The beer selection is good. The service was good even on a busy night. I downloaded the App and it seemed to work well. Paid via the app and tipped cash. The food was hot, fresh, flavorful, and finished at the end. The beer sampler is always a good way to taste more than one on the menu for $5.95. The fried artichoke hearts were delicious. The string fries were good also. The place was not noisy. We were seated earlier than stated. Overall, a good spot and would come back"
Toni L.,"Sugar Land, TX",10,7,11,4.0,8/20/2013,"We come to BJ's a lot and the food is consistently good. It is a great place to bring your kids. They have a great menu, with many healthy options for kids to choose from as well. Grilled chicken, vegetables, rice, veggies with dip, just to name a few.  Their signature pizzas and handcrafted beers top the list at BJ'S for sure. My favorite beer is the Lightswitch Lager.  The atmosphere is fun, with many flat screens to watch every sporting event you can imagine. The service is always good and friendly and  the food never fails!"
Mike M.,"Houston, TX",385,1272,2248,3.0,3/26/2014,I had lunch there ordering the chili and a salad. I thought both were good. The restaurant is nicely decorated. Our table service was a little slow.
Bob P.,"Missouri City, TX",0,26,1,3.0,4/20/2015,Service was not an issue.  Food served cold.  Replacement food was Luke warm.  Very disappointed !
Steph D.,"Houston, TX",26,106,6,3.0,8/19/2014,"Three stars because this place was so .... middle of the road. Mediocre. Not bad per se but not especially interesting either. The food was fine. Guys sitting next to us got theirs before us even tho we ordered first. Whatever. They brew their own beer. I was excited! Their beer was... well... um. Unassuming I guess. Not horrible but not great either. I asked for tastes the bartender was like you can have two. Really? I can't taste your beer? I can order a sampler and get to taste them that way was her attitude. (the 5 oz glasses in the sampler are way more than a taste)  But you know, I can go to Growler's Beer and Wine To Go. They have 32 beers on tap. They will happily offer me a sample of all 32 if I so wish. Been curious to try BJ's for some time. Curiosity sated and not impressed but whatever."
Priyanka P.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,14,,3.0,5/29/2016,"This is A place my family and I  go to for dinner VERY often, service isn't the best and I've been going here for 12 years now because of the food. But, TODAY, our waiter NICK did nothing but IMPRESS my family of 23 and I.  We were all drinking, hungry from a long day, and he attended everyone very well, professionally, and made sure we were all happy!  I would hands down say he is the best waiter I've had in my LIFE.  The food has always been good but he NAILED it with his exceptional service."
eric m.,"Sugar Land, TX",213,22,68,4.0,8/11/2015,"Food is decent bar food.  Don't really consider this a brewpub, since they don't brew the beer"
Salimah C.,"Frisco, TX",0,26,,2.0,10/12/2015,"I have been going to this place for years and yesterday was the FIRST TIME my food came out in good timing. But the waiter ruined the experience. My brother was literally sick from the ahi tuna in the salad, and the waiter was explaining it to him like he was brainless. He offered to bring out a new serving but why now. Then in explaining the pumpkin spice pazooki, he told us it tastes like pumpkin pie. Um, no. Then when the bill came out we asked if he could take off the ahi tuna from the salad, so he halfed the price of the salad, but blamed the fact that he wasnt happy with the ahi tuna on him and not wanting another serving of it. You should never blame the guest and you should be way more knowledgeable of seasonal menu items."
Annie H.,"Sugar Land, TX",200,19,7,4.0,3/7/2014,"I have never ever had a bad experience at any BJ's. They have great food, good drinks and great service.  I wanted to write about a specific server that waited on me and my boyfriend the last time we went.. except I forgot his name :( all i remember is that he was every helpful and attentive, but not to the point where it was annoying (I know servers are supposed to check up on you a lot but there's a point where it becomes a little much, am I right?) He was easy to talk to and helped my boyfriend order since it was his first time. Great guy! Appetizers: you have to try the mini bruschetta or the avocado egg rolls. Or both, do whatcha want. TO DIE FOR.  I'm also slightly obsessed with soup in bread bowls... and BJ's tomato bisque in a sourdough bread bowl is absolutely drool worthy.  Lastly, I love love love places that will substitute meat. For you vegetarians out there, get the California burger and ask for a veggie patty instead. You won't regret it! (I mean, who doesn't love avocado??) All in all, BJ's never disappoints. It's a shame there isn't more of them around Houston, but you take what you can get!"
John D.,"Missouri City, TX",164,644,107,1.0,1/9/2012,This place is consistent all right... consistently bad.  I can't understand why the line is out the door most nights. I've never had good service (on our last trip I told a manager to get our server some help - while he was a nice guy he was clearly in over his head.) Trying to get a refill on a drink or getting the right order out of the kitchen is more than their waitstaff can apparently handle. Food is mediocre. The beer is decent (although this is NOT a microbrewery; it's contracted private label stuff) but it's not worth the wait or aggravation.
Monica M.,"Houston, TX",0,14,12,3.0,9/26/2015,"My hubby wanted to try this place because the pictures of the food looked good.  The visit was decent but not the greatest.  We had the calamari as an appetizer and it was super super greasy. I mean, dripping in oil.  We got BJ's pizza in deep dish and it was okay. Nothing to really rave about (we could have gone to Double Dave's for the same thing). They're pitcher of beer was good. The service was okay too but it took forever for our waiter to come around after our food arrived. All in all, we probably won't go back."
Miranda T.,"Houston, TX",261,70,271,2.0,5/29/2014,"I have been to other BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse locations, and though my experience wasn't ever spectacular, it was at least decent. What was really lacking here was the food. Honestly, I do not expect much from chain restaurants, but this BJ's set a new standard of low for me.  We decided to dine here for my friend's birthday dinner. The birthday girl ordered a vegetarian angel hair pasta, I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, and another friend ordered the crispy jalapeño burger. -The angel hair came out bland, mushy, and way over cooked. Sadly, there was also a piece of CHICKEN that my VEGETARIAN friend found in her pasta.  -The mahi-mahi tasted like old, microwaved fish, and the bed of rice it came over was excessively greasy. My friend initially thought the slab of fish was a piece of bread. That is how dry and over cooked the mahi-mahi was. Honestly, it was disgusting. I have never had a problem with this dish before at other locations. I even thought I was being safe by ordering it tonight, but I guess not.  -The burger was HUGE. Our friend said he enjoyed it. I sampled some of his crispy fries and thought they were pretty good! Thankfully, the waitress was nice enough to allow the birthday girl to replace her entree. Since burgers seemed like the only thing they could get right, she got a vegetarian burger instead. She said it was much better than her pasta. If you have to come here, I would suggest sticking to their pizzas or burgers, but in regards to any of their other dishes, just do yourself a favor and stay away. Their only real redeeming quality is their pizookie."
Grace R.,"Austin, TX",50,6,,1.0,6/6/2016,"We used our BJ's phone app and made a simple to-go order. They charged for a free dessert that was promised on the BJ's phone app, forgot to include drinks, and in one entree only included about half the serving we'd gotten when actually dining in. Very disappointed. We were out over $10 and didn't get all the food we paid for. The BJ's phone app was great and user-friendly, however, the staff at this location didn't fulfill our order well. Thankfully, we were visitors in town and won't need to order from this location again."
Jenny L.,"Houston, TX",30,27,9,1.0,10/4/2013,"Me and my friends decided to come here to relax after the end of another work week. We really like the food especially the pizookies, too bad the service was subpar this evening.  We like getting our dessert first so me and my friend ordered a mini pizookie. We got them in a timely manner but when it came to our entree...not so much. We aren't the type to complain so we patiently wait. Thirty minutes go by, still no food and absolutely no attention from the waiter or management. Forty-five minutes go by, still no food and still no one came by to give an update on our order. We finally have to flag down the waiter, Emory, and he says he just spoke to the manager and our food should be on our way.  Finally after an hour, we get our food by the manager Stephen and I ask what happened to our order. He says he had no idea and barely found out of the situation. Really? I thought the waiter had informed him of the situation. So we flag down yet another manager, Rene, and ask him what happened to our order. He has no clue as well but said he would come back to let us know.  So we have our food but empty waters and no condiments. So I literally have to walk up to Rene who was standing at the hostess stand to make the request because everyone just stopped coming by our table.  So at this point we had our food an hour delayed, no attention from managers or the waiter, no explanation, no water, & no condiments. We were very agitated so I flagged Rene down to get an explanation. Remind you, he was supposed to come back with an explanation but he was too busy playing hostess instead of being a manager. He rather chose to ignore us like everyone else until we confronted him. He finally admits the the ticket was lost in the kitchen and that's why our food was so late coming out. I get it, mistakes happen but it's the way that they are handled that rectifies the situation. The fact that we were practically ignored is where the dissatisfaction in service came from. If they had come to our table 20 minutes after us not receiving our food and explained the situation, I would not be writing such a negative review right now. Unfortunately, they decided to ignore us and that was not acceptable.  BJ's as a company needs to learn how to train their employees on customer service. After all they are in the restaurant industry which is based on customer satisfaction."
Maithili B.,"Houston, TX",175,73,93,3.0,5/4/2015,"Went here with my fam bam on a whim. The starters were perfect! We got the spinach artichoke dip and the mediterranean flat bread pizza. Both tasted deliciously unhealthy, I particularly liked the addition of goat cheese to the pizza.  For main course, I got the angel hair pasta with broccoli, sundried tomatoes and garlic. The pasta was completely lacking in taste. I felt like I was basically eating boiled pasta with some veggies thrown in. I used up half a jar of chili flakes to add flavor to the pasta if that's any indication of how bad it was. My aunt asked for two chicken tacos without any lettuce and she literally got two soft tortillas with just the chicken. There were no red onions, cilantro, tomatoes or any additional filling like the menu had promised. When we asked the waiter if he misunderstood, he said that the filling is prepared with lettuce beforehand, so that's why the tacos only contained chicken. We would have appreciated knowing  beforehand. For desserts, we got the chocolate chunk pizzokie and ohmygoodness, all of us were clamoring for it. It was a battleground with four spoons clashing for the chocolate chips.  Service-6/10. Initially our server was pretty fast but as the evening progressed, he took 15-20 minutes to come to our table. I wouldn't have been too frustrated if it wasn't for the fact that we called out to 4 or 5 servers, all of whom promised to get our server but never did anything.  Ambience-8/10. There were ants everywhere on the first table we were offered, which made me question the hygiene levels. However, we were given another table without any fuss pretty quickly. The rest of the restaurant is pretty cool. I liked that there were TVs everywhere showing different sports. God knows, my family can't eat without watching basketball/baseball/hockey/football/soccer/cricket/tennis and even golf (I know, how does anyone watch golf patiently?)"
Amber S.,"Sugar Land, TX",244,311,44,4.0,7/16/2012,"There is almost always a wait. My sister and I went on a Thursday night and had to wait for 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The servers are great but not stellar. They're good about topping up drinks, updating you on the status of your meal and making sure the food is okay once you receive it. For an appetizer, the santa fe spring rolls are a great choice for sharing with another person. They come with 2 sauces, both are delicious.  As far as entrees goes, I love the pizza there so I usually stick to it. The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is absolutely amazing and never disappointing. A small can feed 2 people so keep that in mind. I've also tried the flatbread version of this pizza and it's just as good.  For dessert, a pazookie is a MUST. They have a couple of different options to choose from so definitely consider getting one. I promise you won't regret it!!"
Jenn H.,"Houston, TX",41,22,11,3.0,7/14/2014,"I am a pizza and beer fanatic. I would marry both of them if I could. BJ's has some great house beers (go with the Oasis!) and some delicious pizza. But... This particular location can't seem to keep up with the customer volume. I've sadly watched this location go downhill with food quality and customer service. The last two times we came, pizza was super dry and cold and the hostesses/waiters were super rude and made us feel like a burden for just being there to eat. Seriously, the last time I came I got an eye roll as soon as we walked in the door to get a table (before I even said a word). Anyway, the great beers will keep me coming back for drinks, but I've definitely moved on from making this one of my regular dinner spots because of the food quality in general and pricing for it."
Melanie L.,"Houston, TX",183,116,1378,5.0,10/9/2011,"Haha. BJs. Sorry just had to throw that in there. You definitely get your money's worth here. The dishes are just about as pricey as any other restaurant, yet you get some pretty generous portions. I don't see what's not to love about this place. It's a great place to have lunch with coworkers, catch up with friends, dinner with the family, etc. (yes family, even though it's a brewhouse too).  It's open til midnight so you have a place to go when most other restaurants close at like 9-10pm. The staff is very attentive, especially one of our waitresses, I think her name was Vicky? She was so sweet and funny; she really made us feel welcome there. Even the manager (I presume) consistently came up to tables and asked how everyone's visit/food is. I really appreciate that.  The variety of things they have on their menu, from drinks to food to desserts, is great. The first few pages of their menu is nothing but beer, and I think BJ's has their own beer for their restaurant. They have lighter options, gluten free items and vegetarian items too! It's like there's a little something for everyone here. There's so many things I wanna try out here, but must do with future visits. As of right now, I've had the ahi poke (tuna, green onions, and avocado w/ wonton chips), spinach stuffed mushrooms, and angus beef sliders as appetizers, and the california burger (has avocado, green chilies, and pepper jack cheese on it) and parmesan crusted chicken (comes w/ mashed potatoes and broccoli) as entrees. I haven't found anything I haven't liked yet! Must try the flatbread pizzas, gourmet mac&cheese, and avocado egg rolls. And for dessert, it's soooo good it has to have its own section in my review. As I'm sure others have already mentioned: GET THE PIZOOKIE! The cookie itself comes in different flavors such as chocolate chunk, oatmeal raisin, white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies&creme, and red velvet. Yes I said it. A red velvet cookie with ice cream on top. During my last visit, I decided I had to try one of those, but my friends all wanted a different flavor. So we agreed on ordering the pizookie trio, which is a sampler of your choice of 3 pizookies. We chose red velvet, white macadamia nut, and chocolate chunk. Each one was so good, my mind was blown. So good that pizookies have now become one of my favorite desserts. Overall: great ambiance, great service, great food. Great everything. Highly recommend this place!"
