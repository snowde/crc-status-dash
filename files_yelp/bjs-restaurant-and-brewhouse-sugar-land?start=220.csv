Richard C.,"Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,3/5/2015,Very poor service...we were in a hurry and told them so.  45 min later the food start to arrive...5 of of the 6 meals were wrong.  Drink refills must not been included :(
Divya G.,"Sydney, Australia",22,91,21,4.0,7/9/2013,Our starters of wings and chicken wontons were good. They do not have a big selection of Ciders:( Boohooo. Since they carry so many beers! which they brew...i was really hoping for a good choice on the Cider scene too..Liked the ambiance and my hubby liked their beer alright ;) Anyways will be back:) to try their chocolate dessert! which I heard is awesome.:D
Sarah S.,"Sugar Land, TX",101,66,3,4.0,3/31/2013,"My boyfriend and I came here around 11, and we had a really nice waiter. His name is J. Thanks J for being very nice and accommodating to my boyfriend and I.  We had the shrimp napa cabbage wraps that were really nice, it's tangy and sweet with the sauce that's not soy sauce. A very good first choice for an appetizer.  We got the spinach and asparagus deep dish, medium, and it's was a good size to share between the two of us. Unfortunately it had blue cheese, so I didn't enjoy it, but my boyfriend love that blue, so I let him have it. Take it, take it all!  I liked the creation that my boyfriend made: it was a pizza with pesto sauce (hand tossed and sharable), with cilantro, mushrooms, seasoned tomatoes,... I really forgot but we just put the toppings from the ""build your own part of the menu"" (more veggies no meats), and we built it that way. I liked it. J made sure that our pesto substitution was possible, and he was really patient. Not bad for a late night out when everything else is SL is closed."
Trevor B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,3,4.0,1/23/2016,"Popular place. It was packed at 6:15pm on a Saturday. The wait time was 20-25 minutes. It looked like tables were ready for customers but they were slow to seat them. We spotted tables/booths open for 10 minutes. Food was as good as expected, above average. Wait service was good. Would return there again."
Veronyka G.,"Sugar Land, TX",49,24,1,1.0,7/28/2013,"A warm, fresh baked cookie with ice cream would normally cheer me up after a bad day. So the family took me to BJ's for their famous pizookie. I got the white chocolate macadamia nut, my daughter got the chocolate chunk, and my husband took the beignet.  The waiter greeted us after we waited for ten minutes after sitting down. I suppose I can overlook the wait since it was busy for a Wednesday night, but it is summer so we just seated ourselves at the bar area. We ordered our pizookies and beignet and specified that we didn't want caramel on the beignet that we ordered. It took us a while to get our dessert. And when we got it, the order was right, except for the caramel.  That just sucked. We told the waiter and the manager and all we got was cursory ""I'm sorry that happened"" in return. I guess they were that busy so no one really offered a way to rectify the situation. It wasn't taken off the bill, offered to be replaced, nothing. How disappointing.  I won't be returning anytime soon."
Veronica S.,"Richmond, TX",3,52,,2.0,12/19/2012,"Overpriced for not so great food. Appetizer portions are tiny and not enough to share yet cost $8..seriously? Service is kind of slow but our server was nice and attentive. Makes me think the problem is the kitchen.  I had a sandwich and it was ok. Nothing special by no means. I've had better at IHOP. The person I was with got 'deep dish pizza'. They must not know what a deep dish pizza is because it was ALL DOUGH...very fluffy and light (and ok, fairly yummy) dough...with like 4 tiny pieces of topping and maybe a table spoon total of cheese (you could SEE the dough on top of the pizza due to lack of sauce/cheese). That is NOT a deep dish pizza. Putting it in a deep pan doesnt automatically make it a 'deep dish pizza'. That's like making mac n cheese and calling it Italian because its pasta.  Very disappointing."
Sarah H.,"Houston, TX",8,192,16,3.0,7/9/2013,"Just as Yelp put it, this place is A-OK.  Meaning, they meet expectations.   The waiters & service are pretty good, as we got our food fairly quickly for a Friday night for a group of 6 ladies.  I love the location, not on the Sugarland Town Center side, so the traffic/parking situation is easy to handle, but right across the street from it so you can easily access the highway & hop on over to STC if your heart desires!"
Marco C.,"Austin, TX",135,258,38,2.0,6/22/2012,"I've always liked this place back in high school (4 years ago). I hadn't been here recently, so I didn't understand the low ratings.....until now.  After being seated, we told the waitress we needed a few more minutes to think through what we wanted to order. It took her 10 minutes to come back. BJ's was NOT busy at 10pm.  My friend and I ordered two beers, and it took 20-25 minutes for us to get them. Too long. BJs, were you guys busy brewing the beer? After paying, our table should've received $5 in change in total. We felt cheated, but we thought the money went to the tip. (None of us told her to keep the change.) Afterwards, the waitress took the receipt booklets cause we had finished with them, but then she brought the booklets back so we could tip. What? Where did all the money that you took from us go?  Later, the waitress told us that they don't get paid a lot and would appreciate tip. Now, I completely understand that, and I'm actually pretty generous when I tip, but when a) the service is ridiculously slow and b) you don't return our table's change, do you honestly expect us to tip more? Based on what we ordered, the $5 was already more than what was expected of us to tip. I wanted to be nice, but I couldn't sympathize.  Should be one star; keeping at two because I've had positive experiences in the past. The beer wasn't bad, and I enjoy the atmosphere. My friends and I still had a good time. However, based on the other reviews, it sounds like everything about this place has gone down hill over time. Tip: Pay with credit card so you don't face our problem."
David B.,"Sugar Land, TX",3,11,3,4.0,8/15/2013,"Come here often. Usually good . Pot Roast Sandwich is really good. Daniel L was our waiter, and did a good job of keeping things moving during a busy period while appearing they may have been understaffed. Service is typically inconsistent . Food usually is consistent ."
Sarfaraz M.,"Euless, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/17/2015,This place has the best pizza but the worst staff I have ever seen and I have seen some really shyty service the staff here trumps it all. I was given a wrong order with pepperoni and bacon on my pizza when I clearly ordered veg (I am Muslim so can't eat pork) . The waiter ( big black dude with a gut and a girly name) tried to take the pork out and give me the slice back . He he he he he dumb mother trucker. Anyway on short go to other B Js this one is pretty shyty.
J G.,"Spring, TX",0,3,,1.0,6/24/2014,Walked in here and the place stinks? I am wondering if nobody else notices this but me! This is the second time I've been here and the smell is still the same. The servers don't seem to care much for service either.
Mae C.,"Denver, CO",123,37,8,4.0,4/24/2013,"This place is always packed either with families or high-school teenagers. If you're here on a weekend, be sure to wait for awhile. BJ's has the BEST pizza! It's so soft and succulent, and I am such a fan of their deep dish. Their pazookie is also very delicious! Definitely try their specialty beers when you are here. Some of their beers are seasonal only, so make sure to ask the waiters. BJ's has been recently promoting their 2 for $20 special, which is made for 2 people. It includes 2 appetizers, 1 medium pizza and a pazookie. The dessert is regular size, so expect to get your belly filled up fast! I'm not sure if they still have this, so ask your waiters if it's currently going on."
K K.,"TX, TX",49,640,63,4.0,9/17/2012,"Celebrate the day just because at this place.  Consisent on all their dishes, yes each one of these places has the same layout, same menu, management makes it a delight.   Don't fight your way in, wiggle and wiggle and wiggle right to the pizza and their portion size is perfect.  Something for everyone, beer is not bad either! EZ parking."
Lauren T.,"Houston, TX",41,124,7,2.0,10/20/2012,"This place is weird. For one, it's called ""BJ's."" It is an extremely bright bar (to the point that it hurts your eyes) and it is extremely quiet. It's like a library in there! We had a late dinner/snacks on a Friday night. While crowded, the decibel level must have been the lowest I have ever heard in a room full of drunk people. BJ's brews their own beer and makes their own sodas, so maybe it's something in the beverages that keep people calm and sedate. The decor is equally weird--industrial corrugated metal accents and booths upholstered with fabric from tapestry vests circa 1990. Hurts my brain! The night of our visit we waited over ten minutes to be given menus or a greeting, even though we were seated right by the hostess stand. The waitress kept mixing up who ordered what and all of the food was obviously frozen and reheated as it came out at all different intervals. I was near the kitchen and could hear the chorus of microwave beepers going off. It's like the food you get at TGI Friday's or Chili's--corporate, processed ""product"" that was likely driven there in an 18 wheeler. Like, you could buy it boxed up at the store and make it yourself at home.  The prices for everything are pretty outrageous for mediocre-at-best food. $11 for avocado egg rolls (bland--needed salt), $5 for four tiny squares of bruschetta that equaled one breadstick, bland but well-fried mozzarella sticks for $8, and stuffed mushrooms for $8 that were really small button mushroom caps. Kind of disappointing. Equally disappointing was the beer itself. One of my dining companions ordered a beer that tasted like it had sat in a metal tank for days. It was disgusting and had a foul smell. My hubby got the berry cider, which tasted pretty good. My beer was nothing to write home about--average at best.  Not worth a special trip unless you would like to take in its weirdness. :)"
Ryan W.,"Houston, TX",274,63,16,2.0,10/19/2014,The food here is actually pretty okay. It's the terrible service that leaves you wanting something more. It starts with the hostesses. They ALWAYS look like they're waiting for someone to put them out of their misery. After they reluctantly see you to your table you're forced to wait 10 minutes to see your server for the first time. You're lucky if you ever get a refill on your drink. It's painfully clear that nobody here is even remotely concerned with customer service. I'm only giving two stars because the food is okay.
Rachel J.,"Victoria, TX",20,56,2,4.0,7/30/2012,"Totally a fan of BJ's Brewhouse. We love the food - it's not necessarily inventive, but it's well done. Comfort food, if you will. I know I certainly will. I love their loaded baked potatoes and their southern fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and onion straws. Oh, and the pizzas. And the wontons. And the pizookies, naturally. There's something for everyone - and there's a wide variety of brews to enjoy, if that's your jam.  We come here for dinner, which almost always means a wait for a table, but we recently came around 2:30 and had almost the whole place to ourselves. The service is okay to good during the day - our drinks were never empty (although they got close!) and our food was well-paced, from appetizers to the meal. We did have a lengthy wait for our pizookies, but maybe that was meant to be a sign we shouldn't be ordering cookies. ;)  At night, you'll wait a little longer for service, but I've not had an actual bad experience. I do, however, think that BJ's could step it up a bit with the service times, hence the missing star. Service times = less wait time for tables, too, so it's kind of a win-win plan. ;)"
Tim J.,"Houston, TX",40,535,1053,4.0,7/18/2012,"Awesome happy hour spot right off the freeway in Sugarland. The guys that came up with the idea of BJ's made it as inviting as any warm lodge on a snowy day. Nice interior with plenty of seating, great food/snacks, huge TV's with sports and even make their own beer!  Foods: Pizza- Great small pieces perfect for the HH, and just small enough to not easily get knocked out of your hands or make a mess. A Avacado egg rolls- While this is the same stuff served at multiple bars/grills in town, I'm sure I have shamed my Asian heritage for being too weak to resist this. A Beers- I had all of it, they have samplers and full sizes. Great stuff, you can really dial in on what you like. And it's the middle ones in-case anyone wants to buy me a few pints. A And maybe this is why I dont have a man cave at the house, cause there's BJ's. And just like home, sometime you gotta do the service yourself(A bit spotty at times depending on where you sit), but you get over it quickly once the pitchers starts moving."
Sara I.,"Sugar Land, TX",220,240,475,3.0,5/28/2010,"Deep Dish Pizza isn't so great here.  It just didn't live up to the taste of it`s well known style. The pizza was not hearty, thick, or overloaded with toppings. It was skimpy, as well as frail. If you want some good old Chicago style deep dish, check out Star Pizza. I can`t say much about the other foods here, but I doubt I would like it.  The ambiance reminds me of an over sized Chili`s or Apple Bees."
Joseph C.,"Houston, TX",0,40,3,2.0,8/31/2014,"So apparently, BJ's is known for their pizzas but I really am not sure why. The pizza's are very mediocre. Decided to give this place a visit since they seem to have a great following but ended up being rather dissapointed. Honestly, big name pizza chains are way better. I ordered their deep dish pizza. To start off, their deep dish is not a Chitown deep dish pizza where you get a relatively thin, buttery/flaky crust and loaded with toppings. BJ's deep dish is like a thick fluffy, white bread crust with some toppings layered over it. The crust lacked the bite and chew you'd expect pizza crusts from pretty much every other pizza place in the world to have. The toppings were pretty generic and lukewarm; edible but nothing special. To put it plainly, eating a BJ's deep dish pizza is like eating a Subway sandwich that's pretending to be a pizza and that's far from a compliment. Zero stars for their ""pizza"". Service was slow and unattentive.  The restaurant has a cool vibe. Spacious, with beer and lots of screens to watch sports on. One star for the cool vibes. Ended the meal with the pizookie trio sampler. The pizookies was pretty good. One more star. Two stars overall. Would only come back for pizookies and beer. Otherwise pass on this b."
Diego V.,"Missouri City, TX",13,31,2,4.0,9/22/2014,"The ambient is casual-dressy, the bar is nice and conferrable if you want to stop and catch a game. The food is good, steak is pretty good as well as their deep dish pizza. The only downside of the place is the waiting time, if you happen to go at peak hour you might wait 30-45 minutes if not more to find a seat. Their desserts are one of the best I've tried."
