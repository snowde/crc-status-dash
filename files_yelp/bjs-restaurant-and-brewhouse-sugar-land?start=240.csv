Esra K.,"Houston, TX",61,15,5,2.0,8/3/2014,"Its just hard to get their attention when you want extra ranch or more fries.. Waiters are tend to pretend they don't see you while you are waving at them.. Ok food, not ok service."
Taylor M.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,4,,4.0,12/3/2014,"I've always loved BJ's but lately that place has been smelling funky. No idea what it could be, can't really explain the smell. The waiter we had explained that it may be the old carpet. Hopefully it gets replaced ASAP if that's the case!! I must add that our waiter also forgot about us, we were left without any service for a good 10-15. The good is always great, though."
Tim J.,"Houston, TX",0,53,,4.0,12/2/2014,"I enjoyed the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon that consisted of a oven roasted Atlantic salmon topped with a slightly sweet and savory cherry chipotle glaze, roasted asparagus, fire‑roasted red bell peppers, tomato and spinach couscous.  It tasted so good that I will have to order it again the next time. My wife enjoyed the Atlantic Salmon that was a blackened salmon fillet served with lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, rice pilaf and seasonal vegetables.  She informed me that she liked her entree very much but she liked the taste of my entree a little bit better. The service was very slow and we started to wonder if our waitress might have forgotten about us and she was very slow in refilling our soft drinks.  This type of service has happened to us the last three times that we have dined there."
Jenn L.,"Houston, TX",74,238,236,4.0,6/2/2014,"We sat at the bar and our bartender was quick with our drinks! Absolutely love their Pizookies! Although, it took forever to come out it was delicious! This location was similar to the location near willowbrook but slightly better. Why? This Sugarland location wasn't ridiculously packed like the Willowbrook location.  And the parking lot is a lot more spacious. The front parking lot is limited, but there's plenty of parking behind and the side of the building. Service was pretty good!"
Sandy K.,"Houston, TX",11,137,110,4.0,7/5/2014,Ordered a Cajun pasta (replaced the meat with veggie option)....it was really good with nice flavor. Never had such pasta before. Garlic bread was also very good. It was a little pricey...but its that kind of place.
Felyn B.,"Houston, TX",27,78,12,2.0,5/17/2012,"I visited the restaurant yesterday as part of an employee outing.   The reasons for the 2 stars are as follows: the host was pretty courteous in suggesting a booth even though he understood that we wanted a table for our party, the service was kind of slow when we were ready to order, my order (Salmon Teriyaki) was good, but a bit over-seasoned.  I didn't partake of the beer, but maybe the next time I visit.  I'll update my review, if I do."
Noble K.,"Sugar Land, TX",230,142,128,3.0,5/18/2014,"I would say in overall, the food here is just a bit above average.  However there are 2 things that I love to get here.  First is the deep dish pizzas.  Very good pizza and if you like deep dish you have to come check it out over here.  Also a huge fan of their pizooki.  Think warm cookie cake right out of the oven with ice cream on top.  I've had a bunch of other things but these 2 things are what keep me coming back."
Heidi M.,"Richmond, TX",0,5,1,1.0,11/11/2014,"The service is absolutely horrible. I've come here three times in the last 6 months and it keeps getting worse and worse. Twenty minutes without drinks, AN HOUR for food and the server was rude. New management or new help is the only way this place has a chance..."
Tammie T.,"Houston, TX",133,101,426,3.0,1/3/2012,"I'll admit, I only go here to sit at the bar and have the desserts. Occasionally, I order a beer or two. Usually, the bar is packed but I only come with one friend so we manage to squeeze and extra chair near the end.  I've had better visits but the last time I went was a little bit disappointing. We ordered our beers and the pizookie trios and they took forever. We were sipping on our beer for around 30 minutes before the pizookies came out. We soon realized why it was in there for so long. First off, the presentation of these desserts always impressed me. They always looked so appetizing. We got the red velvet, cookies n' cream, and triple chocolate. What I remember about pizookies is that they come out the perfect amount of soft and gooey and this combination with the cold scoop of ice cream on top made a delicious rendezvous in your mouth. This was not the case on this visit, as almost all three of them were over-baked and hard. My friend and I literally had to shove our spoons into them at a 90 degree angle just to be able to dig a little big of cookie each attempt. This was a sad meal, but fortunately, I know that pizookies have seen better days and will probably return again in the future. On a side note, beer does not really go good with these desserts. It just seemed like the only appropriate thing to order while we sat at the bar and waited."
Ashley B.,"Houston, TX",14,83,31,4.0,3/27/2014,"If you are going to drink beer, drink something that has some taste, not the mass produced swill that comes from the giant breweries in America.  That's always been my attitude towards beer, and that's why I am always ready to try out a different brewhouse. BJ's turned out to be an excellent choice for both beer and food.  I stopped by here a few afternoons ago on the way home from work for a bite to eat and a drink.  Once I settled in at the bar with a menu and a clear view of the happy hour list on the wall I decided I wanted a burger and a hefeweizen.  The pizza menu is extensive here but I've had so much pizza recently that I just wasn't in the mood for more.  Some of the fish also sounded good, but again I've had my fill of fish recently.  I settled on a brewhouse burger with bacon and cheese, because frankly this little girl doesn't need a 1/2 pound of burger on top of fries and a pint of beer.  The hefeweizen was the harvest blend brewed by the restaurant served in a chilled pilsner glass.  I opted for the thin and crispy fries as a side to my burger. My food and drink were quite good without being great.  Highlights included fresh cooked bacon that wasn't overdone (something all to common in my experience), gooey cheddar cheese with bite, a fresh Parmesan crusted bun, fries that weren't under or over salted and meat that tasted excellent.  I do wish that the patty had held together a little better, it tended to break apart as I handled and ate it, and I think I'm going to skip the rabbit food if I get it again.  There was just too much lettuce and tomato on this burger.  I should have asked them to bring me some mustard along with the ketchup as well.  Thank God they don't try to put mayo on a burger though.  The beer had a nice flavor and went well with the burger.  It wasn't OMG nectar of the Gods good but I would definitely order it a second time.  My service was prompt, friendly and helpful.  The bartender was attentive and knowledgeable about her product, and had a kind word for a girl just out of a hard day at work.  The decor of the restaurant was pleasant, well maintained and attractive.  It was a tad noisy inside but it seems like most restaurants are these days. The best thing about BJs came at the end of my meal.  I'm talking about the check, and I'm talking about it because it was so small.  A satisfying burger and fries, with a quality microbrewed pint for less then $15 including tip, where else can I find that?  This place has value written all over it, and it is definitely on my list of restaurants worthy of a return visit.  Good food and beer at a great price in a classy looking environment is a winning combination in my book."
Derek K.,"Bellaire, TX",4,58,,2.0,8/5/2014,"Was a really great place with great service....once. Sadly now, like a lot of restaurants in Sugarland, the management has let it go downhill. Waitstaff unattentive, food late, and manager seemed unconcerned. Got the wrong order and it took them almost 20 more minutes to make a rice and salmon dish to replace the order. My family was finished eating theirs so when mine came I simply sent it back. The manager never came over to check on things even after I complained to the waitress. Won't go back but sadly this too-young waitstaff problem is now epidemic in Sugarland. Thank God there's always Pappasito's. ....isn't there?"
Nancy K.,"Richmond, TX",63,127,,2.0,3/10/2012,"We waited 30 minutes to be seated. The service was pretty nonexistent. He didn't do much. He wasn't rude though. It's overpriced. I had a California flatbread pizza. It was sort of burnt on the edges. It had a bad burnt taste too. The ingredients weren't fresh, but it is a chain restaurant. We had artichoke dip which wasn't anything special. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were stale a little. The mozzarella sticks tasted like it was frozen. It was stringy when you pull it apart like what I expect mozzarella sticks to be like. My friends had sliders and a burger. They were both disappointed and just took only one bite Very disappointing meal. It was super overpriced. I'd rather go to a nice place in midtown, downtown or the heights."
Ash K.,"Gorge Road, New Zealand",0,13,1,1.0,8/2/2015,Ok food.  Terrible service.  Not staffed appropriately with wait staff.   Waitstaff lacks basics of customer service.
Paul R.,"Houston, TX",0,21,,4.0,9/3/2014,"4 stars based mostly on the food and atmosphere,  service leaves a lot to be desired. Once seated, our waitress took long enough for us to look around the restaurant and wonder if she knew we were there. Although she was very pleasant, she wasn't very attentive, I had to make eye contact with the hostess in order to get the attention of the waitress. Our food came out halfway through our appetizer, good or bad depending on how you feel. My gf really enjoyed her Mediterranean chicken tacos, but my blackened chicken was more Tony Chacheries than blackened.  So we would probably go back, if anything to try the pizza."
Jim H.,"Sugar Land, TX",19,76,32,3.0,9/3/2012,"OK-ish food was not helped by glacially slow service and multiple order messups. Food: 3.2 Service: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Overall: 2.9 Appetizers: 3/5 Thai Lettuce wraps - Not bad, but the random choice of seasonings made me confused as to what I was eating. 4/5 Pizza (BJ Classic Combo) - Definitely respectable pizza with the proper crunch, but I'm spoiled because I had the real thing on Chicago. While good, this isn't the real thing. Entrees: 3/5 Shrimp scampi pasta - Plenty of shrimp, but too oily for what is apparently a ""light"" dish. The pasta itself was ordinary. 4/5 Parmesan romano chicken - Very decently fried chicken, though not helped by mostly mediocre pasta. (Pasta was a side though, and not part of the dish) 2/5 Chardonnary shrimp pasta - again another pasta dish, but too heavy (again). Service: Over the multiple visits here, we've had: - Duplicated orders - Completely forgotten orders - No water service - No silverware - etc. Ambiance: 3/5 Live and friendly, but far too crowded and uncomfortable during the weekends.

Places without apps or dessert have the entree score instead counted multiple times. ? denotes estimated score, not included. * denotes noteworthy items, 90th percentile. ** denotes exceptional cuisine, 98th percentile."
Miguel S.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,1,2.0,10/11/2014,"Food is great. Pizookies are a must. However, the restaurant just has a terrible smell which makes the food and other great things not very appealing. Perhaps a carpet change is needed."
Johnathon B.,"Katy, TX",183,11,2,4.0,7/9/2014,Went there with a friend and we had a pretty good time. Our server whose name escapes me but she was a nice & attentive. The food was pretty good though not exactly what I ordered but the overall feel was pretty good. Worthy of an additional star
Sarah H.,"Houston, TX",8,25,14,1.0,2/23/2014,Walked in here. It smelled like a bowling alley. Walked right back out. My sister said it smelled like feet. I looked around and it was packed but didn't know how anyone could stand the smell.
bec s.,"Galveston, TX",0,69,16,2.0,7/6/2015,"Ordered a California chicken sandwich during lunch with skinny fries and no bacon. received a sandwich with bacon and a black avocado slice. After complaining to the manager, Rick, he just responded OK I'll tell the cook so next time he'll do it right. I also him they delivered someone else's order to me twice even though I had a menu still in hand. Thought after all that we would get a free pazookie at least! Even the waiter talked to him and still no free nothing!  Waiter was great though. He didn't write it down wrong"
Gina I.,"Missouri City, TX",284,104,4,4.0,12/31/2013,The first couple of times I came here I ordered dishes I didn't particularly like. Now that I have been multiple times I feel as though I have perfected what I love from this place! Get the lunch special BBQ plate. It's so cheap and good! It comes with so much. BJ's is known for their pazooki's. Get the white chocolate macadamia nut one!
