Sophia V.,"Houston, TX",227,140,652,3.0,7/30/2010,"I go here quite often, and I've ordered a variety of things from the menu so far. As appetizers, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Chicken Tenders are delicious! For the main entree, I would highly recommend their Parmesan-Crusted Chicken, Roasted Turkey Cobb sandwich, Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo and you can't go wrong with deep dish pizzas there! One thing I didn't enjoy there is the Chicken Teriyaki; the taste isn't all that pleasing. For dessert, MAKE SURE you order the PIZOOKIE TRIO! it's deliciousss! :) also, try their Rootbear; it's great!"
Alex F.,"Houston, TX",295,81,153,4.0,10/28/2013,"Location is located right across the street from Sugar Land Town Center on hwy 6 so it's easily visible. Just about any pizza you get there is great but I'm partial to the hawaiian. They have their own beers on tap. So far, I've had the blonde and I love it. Kind of reminds me of Birraporetti's (if anyone can remember those in Houston). Really nice woodwork, staff were pretty attentive, and a lot of woodwork make for a great place for lunch, Friday pow-wows, or dinner."
Bryan B.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,5,,1.0,6/29/2015,What a customer service poor place. I ordered a soup and salad. Waitress brought it to me after 15 minutes. Ok. I was hungry so no problem. I notice a small hair in my salad. Soup was good. I showed the waitress the hair. She took the plate and apologized. She then was stopped by the next table to order. Instead of getting rid of the hairy salad she holds the plate in one hand and continued to take their order for about 5-7 minutes because if all their questions. She then goes to the back with the plate in one hand and the other folks menus in the other. Still don't have a new salad. Manager comes over and apologizes after I told him what happened. He said he would take care of my lunch and apologized again. Next I get a check from the waitress with a uniformed military discount. What a joke. My whole lunch was $7.75! originally. Now I have a uniformed military discount which is not only disrespectful to active military persons but also retired ones. I am not a military person but have the utmost respect for the folks that defend our country. What a disrespectful and tasteless restaurant.
Jay D.,"Sugar Land, TX",274,11,10,4.0,5/9/2014,"I always have a great time when I come to this location, Whether I am sitting at the bar or at a table. The customer service is awesome! Robert waited on us, he was very patient with us! And can't forget to mention on how delicious the pizza is! NOM NOM NOMMMM"
Trish D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,1,,1.0,2/19/2012,"I've been to this location twice. The first time I went, service was slow and somewhat rude, but nothing to join Yelp and type up a review about. Our second visit, however... wow. Terrible dining experience. We walked in and immediately noticed an open table right up front. We checked in with the 4 people working up front (we had to wait for them to stop chatting to help us) and then waited for 15 minutes only to be seated at the table that had been empty since we walked in. The gentleman that seated us didn't offer to get our drink order, but rather abruptly turned and jogged back to the front to continue his conversation. 15 minutes later no one had taken our drink order and we were getting ready to just leave when our waitress walked by and informed us that she would be with us in ""2 minutes.""  Evidently I glared hard enough at her to get her moving, because less than 2 minutes later a different gentleman rushed over and took our drink and food order. Our drinks showed up 5 minutes later (although I wasn't able to get any sweetener from anyone until after our food finally came). The rest of the visit was just mediocre. I had the Ahi Tuna and the Santa Fe Spring Rolls, both of which were decent. My husband had the Post Roast. The meat and potatoes were good, but none of the vegetables were cooked all the way. In fact, we were pretty sure they tossed a raw onion in the mix for some reason. We stared at it for a bit and laughed it off.  So... yeah. We won't be returning. There are plenty of other restaurants in the Sugar Land area that actually work hard at keeping their customers at least marginally satisfied."
Noanya S.,"Houston, TX",23,149,688,3.0,3/28/2014,Love the ahi poke and beer variety when dining in but take-out sucks...well not the take-out food but when I order take-out it shouldn't take an hour for pick up and the curb side service phone should not constantly be busy...what's the point
M P.,"Houston, TX",0,29,1,4.0,5/27/2014,"Been here for dinner and a beer a few times, never had a problem. Fun atmosphere, but not so loud that you can't hold a normal conversation. Good food, some items are reasonably priced (like $7.50 for a burger and fries) and others were a bit pricey ($15 for a small single person deep dish pizza) but it all depends on what you want to order."
Maria C.,"Houston, TX",8,14,16,4.0,4/26/2015,good food and great for groups that just want to have fun. :)
Mary M.,"Missouri City, TX",0,9,,3.0,8/18/2015,The food here is alright. I ordered a spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer and it was pretty good. I ordered a medium steak and it was dry and not what I was expecting.
Nicole S.,"Houston, TX",145,893,254,3.0,12/31/2011,"Since the last time I went I noticed they had added some smaller portion appetizers.  I tried the tomato and mozzarella one, and it was really tasty.  A few of the other ones looked really yummy as well.  The also make really great avocado egg rolls.  While they are always a bit pricey and sometimes the service is a bit slow, food here is usually good."
Alfonso G.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,,1.0,10/18/2014,"Dead roach in parmesan cheese, disgusted not coming back. ""Supervisor"" tried to cover it up as a red pepper flake ridiculous"
Melissa M.,"Houston, TX",175,1388,4254,2.0,8/4/2009,"Oh where to start?  We got there around 2pm today for a late lunch.  Seated promptly.  Drinks served.  Had to ask for silverware.  Ordered... everything seemed fine... Then my salad came with nuts on it (that I specifically asked to not be included as I can't stand any nuts).  The server took it away and brought it back after a while without nuts. My dad ordered chives on his baked potato, but they were missing.  He doesn't like to make a fuss about anything so he decided to eat it chiveless. Ok, so no big deal, right?  I agree.  Kitchens mess up.   Ok, so I'm eating my salad and then when I'm almost done I find a long (6 inches) piece of plastic in my salad.  It's thin like cellophane (maybe the wrapping on the lettuce?).  I finally track down my waitress (who has gotten harder and harder to find even though the restaurant is only about 10% full).  It's in my salad bowl and she puts her hand into the salad and takes it off the bowl.  She doesn't ask, she just reaches in.  Well, I was eating the salad, but not anymore (I figured, I'd eaten most of the salad, I might as well finish it, plastic or not).  She walks away without a 'sorry about that' or anything.  She is gone a long time and finally comes back and said the manager (who I didn't ask for) has been in an interview and she'll talk to him as soon as she can.  Ok, fine by me.  I do think it's appropriate when people find foreign objects in their food that a manager visits their table.  I was fine with waiting as a third person joined us a little later and was still eating.  Well, the manager never comes by.  I see him leave his interview and he proceeds to just stand around at the hostess desk chatting with the employees (he definitely didn't look busy).  The waitress comps our meal (which I also didn't request but would expect).  Ok, fine, but shouldn't the manager come over?  Shouldn't the waitress apologize for the plastic?   while all this is going on, my friend and I decided we wanted to share a dessert.  Our waitress had been M.I.A. for a while now, so we asked another server for a menu but never got it. We asked a second server and she brought us a menu but didn't take the order.  Finally after about 10 minutes, we were able to order dessert.  If a restaurant is busy, I can understand it.  But seriously, by this time it's almost 3pm on a Tuesday.  The place is almost empty.  It appears to be about a 1 server per table ratio.  Why is the service so slow and unresponsive? This place was already not my favorite in Sugar Land because they serve Pepsi *barf* product, but I can survive on Iced Tea.  But with service like this (server and manager) I don't know that I'll be back soon. I think the food is good.  Not 'wow' unbelievable, but definitely solid good food.  I think they need to step up the service.  If a manager reads this, please always visit a table if plastic or other items are found in the patron's food, especially during non-peak times."
John A.,"Des Plaines, IL",24,67,6,5.0,6/10/2014,Great food for the value and the best service. Waiter was Matt and very attentive to needs.
Justin P.,"Houston, TX",67,11,8,3.0,5/19/2013,"An establishment that is fairly representative of American pub fare and culture. While there are certain items that fall off the mark, there are certainly others that exceed expectations. Overall, an enjoyable option for dining if one were to decide on a restaurant that serves all manners of American bar food. I have recently just started frequenting the BJ's chain so I cannot vouch for all the food options that they offer. They do, however, have some outstanding items on the menu. They also offer locally-made in-house soda (root beer and cream soda) along with varieties of craft beer. A word of caution though - the menu is quite large and expansive. You will feel a little overwhelmed if you are not craving anything in particular. Of the items I have tried, I was thoroughly impressed with the gourmet mac and cheese. The subtle adjustments that they have made with the cheese composition along with the addition of the right amount of bacon and bread crumbs is sublime. The Chicken Fried Steak is also noteworthy. It is properly executed with the right amount of breading and seasoning and the sawmill gravy that is paired with the steak has just the right amount of salt and pepper. The deep dish pizzas are also worthy of a try. They have the right balance of airiness and crunch and the quality of the toppings is excellent. The dough also has a distinct sweetness to it that generally lends well to the flavors and saltiness in the toppings. The burgers do leave something to  be desired. They are good but nothing exceptional. I wish they were better. I do appreciate the option of choosing either wedge-cut and frenched fries as I prefer my fries a little thicker. The in-house root beer and cream sodas are also worth a try. If you are a fan of either and can afford the extra calories, be sure to give it a go. Refills are also included. One thing that I do have an issue with is the pricing of some menu items. More often than not, I find myself questioning the value of the food that I have ordered. While the restaurant certainly isn't exorbitantly priced, I feel that some items are a lot more expensive than they should be. I also find the service in this specific location a little lacking. While bar service is impeccable, the table service does leave something to be desired. All in all, this restaurant chain is definitely worth a try. I will certainly be back if my buddies decide to come here for happy hour but otherwise, I would probably go elsewhere."
Cassandra M.,"Missouri City, TX",0,6,,3.0,7/22/2014,"The Pizooki is delicious!  The drinks and food are good but the services is slow 90% of the time.  You will get the occasional quick meal, but I've spent 25 minutes just waiting to order before.  If the service was faster, this would be 5 stars."
Grace C.,"Houston, TX",41,928,178,4.0,11/30/2009,"Great place to hang out with friends/family.  There are a bunch of huge TVs, so from most of the restaurant there's usually at least one that you can watch. They have great happy hour specials - I think the pizzas are half price, among other things. Some favorites are:  * chicken pesto thin-crust pizza (an appetizer that's big enough for a one-person meal) * great white pizza (chicken, alfredo sauce, mushroom, garlic, tomatoes) * meatloaf Beware, the wooden floors (near the entrance, restroom, and bar) are ridiculously slippery!  If you're wearing any kind of shoe with little traction, tread carefully."
Jessica W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1131,187,410,1.0,10/9/2011,"Won't be going here EVER again. One guy complained about a roach in his food and he still had to PAY for it!  WTF??? Also, the management stood there eyeballing me from the bar the whole time.  Haven't you ever seen a white girl with tattoos before. buddy? NOT impressed.  And my salad was wilted. Gross."
Nicola S.,"Missouri City, TX",596,104,37,2.0,1/19/2014,Spinach and artichoke dip was pretty decent. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi cause how can that be messed up. But it was a big failure.  Very plain.  No flavor whatsoever.  It actually tasted way better thr next day after I added some of my own seasonings.  We also got the breaded chicken breast with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The broccoli was under cooked and the chicken was pretty plain too. This place needs a lesson in original flavor or seasoning food. The customer service was nice. I would I go here again.... maybe but I would only get the pizza.
Jessica B.,"Sugar Land, TX",124,20,14,2.0,1/31/2014,"I have experienced several BJ's and I have to say that this has been my least favorite experience. The one positive thing is that the food was very hot. Other than that, our waiter was slow(we had to ask for him AND his coworkers knew who it was without us even saying his name), my country fried chicken was the smallest I have ever had (smaller than a kids portion) and had a brown article in it (which the waiter could not easily identify but later confirmed from the manager that it was a severely burnt fry), and last and most disappointing my pazookie was so overly cooked with little batter that it was burnt all the way through. For my first time here, the impression left was a lasting one. I'm not willing to give this BJs another chance."
Max B.,"Washington, DC",9,49,11,4.0,7/2/2013,"Wow. I didn't know what to expect. The menu is super extensive and the restaurant stays open pretty late. Usually that's a tell tail sign of mediocrity. Boy was I wrong. The food was phenomenal and made to order. With all the possible options, no one can leave hungry. Along with the fantastic food, our waiter, Robert, was very, very nice. He was friendly and extremely accommodating. Great place!"
