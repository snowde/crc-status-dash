Jim R.,"Georgetown, TX",23,44,15,5.0,3/21/2015,"We enjoy coming here. The food was good my wife had lettuce chicken wrap and I had a club, both of which were good. Our waitress was very attentive. Had a sampler of beer so my wife could taste different types. She like the apple cider."
Lisa T.,"Houston, TX",122,17,33,5.0,1/1/2012,This review is for their Chocolate Chunk Pizookie. BEST DESSERT EVERRRRRRRRRRRR. 'Nough said. Everybody go try!
T P.,"Houston, TX",0,12,,1.0,7/24/2011,Consistently horrible.  Pizza is never cooked properly.   Go to Grimaldi's if you want good pizza or Carabba's.
Maria A.,"Houston, TX",0,18,,2.0,4/26/2015,"Tonight for dinner we chose Bjs and I usually love the place but I had the worst time, the food was great as always but I wouldn't bother to eat In at this location ever again due to the service. Our waiter hasn't checked out table once other then bringing the food and leaving without a word. Other waiters passed without caring so unless you want to sit at an unattended table don't eat in here, other locations are good but this one isn't worth the time"
David C.,"Houston, TX",148,33,,1.0,2/16/2014,"Last year, while my family dined at this restaurant someone broke into my car. The staff at the restaurant was not only unhelpful, they were positively indifferent.  As a result, my family and I decided that we could no longer patronize this restaurant. It's a shame, because my kids enjoy the food but they have communicated to us what they really think of their customers."
Shazia C.,"Houston, TX",62,192,110,1.0,1/12/2009,"Well Hello Sugarland !  Bjs is another reason why I don't like chains. Chains always have huge menus with everything thrown in.  I went there for Sunday Brunch. It was my 8 years old cousins b'day and she loves this place for some reason.The place was packed. We waited for good 25 min to find a table.  It took another 10 min for the server to get us just the menus and another 15 min to get the orders.  For appitizers we ordered artichoke dip,mozzarella sticks , calamari (but they were out) , chicken pot sticks . The dip tasted real bad , it smelt like processed cheese with no signs of artichoke. The mozzarella sticks were alright , the chicken pot stickers were way salty and came with soya sauce (which already has a lot of salt).  I also ordered their salad with salmon. The salmon was flaky and the taste wasn't fresh at all. The artichokes in my salad tasted old as well. The ingreidents were not fresh , from the lettuce to the artichoke to even fries and dips. Everything tasted so processed and out of a can or box.  The serivce was extremely slow , we had to tell the waiter 3 times for the refills.  Kids for some reason like this place because they have an ok. kids menu (minni burgers, pizza, spaghetti, grilled cheese sandwich, chicken tenders) They also get treated special , like they get their crayons etc to color away. Watch out though , the kids portions are as huge as adults especially spaghetti , so have two kids share them.  The only thing good here was their PIZOOKIE !  Huge , gigantic cookie , with two scoops of  vanilla bean ice cream on top. The cookie was real soft and chewy with melted chocolate chips , not bad at all !  Bottom Line: If you are looking for a place where you can go with your  kids (picky eaters) for sunday brunch and have highly processed meal, and extremely slow service then yes , why not?"
Patrick D.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,3,,2.0,7/9/2013,"When my friend and I walked into the store, we were not greeted nor asked the size of our party. In fact, the hostess blatantly ignored us and served other guests. My friend had to go up and tell her that we were a party of four, and that the other two would be coming later. She then pointed to a booth in the back and told us that it was open as soon as they cleaned it up. Other guests had a hostess bring them to their table with menus, but my friend and I were sent to the back by ourselves like second class citizens. Strike one. When our waiter came by, he was not particularly engaging, and seemed a bit frustrated. That could be because of the lunch rush, but it still lacked a bit of professionalism. Strike two. Our food came, and I thoroughly enjoyed my grilled patty melt. However, my friend ordered a deep dish pizza, and I have to say it was entirely underwhelming. The pizza looked nothing like the ones described online or in the menu. Strike three. This was my first visit to BJ's, and, while I will give them the benefit of the doubt, I am in no rush to come back for a second visit."
Lasairiona M.,"Missouri City, TX",110,707,393,4.0,6/30/2011,"I'd say 3.5 stars... We eat here every so often and it's not bad, it's just not GREAT, y'know? ...the service tends to be slow cause it's always packed - lunch and dinner times though the hubby loves the Root Beer. It's overpriced for dinner, so we tend to eat here for lunch - I started out ordering the the baked potato and salad every time we went, but have since moved in to the grilled ham and cheese...it's pretty good!"
Christina B.,"Houston, TX",163,109,5,4.0,1/6/2011,"Look: I like soup.  I also like bread. So when I heard that BJ's served clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, I was all like, ""ZOMG! MUST EAT!"" And then I did, And it was magical--magical I tell you! All sarcasm aside, there were many clams in a thick soup that absorbed well into the bread, easily creating crouton-ball things that were terribly delicious. I was like a fat kid in clam chowder and sourdough heaven. So let me just give you this advice: if you like clam chowder and sourdough, go to BJ's. It's relatively inexpensive and your friends who aren't into soup (the cads!) can eat pizza or whatever. Also, I've heard something about there being beer. IDK about all that. I know there's soup."
Patricia E.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,36,3,3.0,11/19/2013,"This is usually our goto place when we can't decide on where to dine. Decent food, decent prices, usually great service except for 2 out of our countless visits. We went last month on my birthday and sat in the bar area.  I asked the waitress if I could sample one of two IPAs on their draft list. No. Policy is they can only sample BJ drafts.  How Rediculous.  How much draft spills down the drain, yet they won't spare an ounce of non-BJ draft to sample.  We didnt make a fuss, but  cancelled our appetizers and went to Pappasito's."
Jeremy A.,"Durango, CO",2,25,,1.0,11/14/2010,"I am embarrassed for this restaurant chain. We've been to BJ's in Webster with terrible results but thought the credit card not being returned (twice) and the incident with the employees mocking my complaint about no soap in the bathroom (they actually were making fun of me in front of my husband who was waiting at the podium for their attention to tell them why we were leaving without paying for our drinks or salad) were strictly isolated cases and part of a result of poor management.  But BJ's in Sugar Land also has problems. We ordered a Cobb salad, which was good, and fish tacos. We weren't particularly hungry so we were just splitting. Like I said, the salad was fairly good, but our tacos came and were just plain gross. My husband thought they had Indian seasonings in them but my main complaint was the fish was in the form of a fish stick!! $10 for two fish sticks!! Whhaaat?  We asked to change our order to something simple (we thought) and got a cheeseburger. Well done. Coming 15 minutes later, we cut it to split and it was pink inside. Sigh.  My husband is far more gracious than I am. He wanted to pay for the terrible meal and apologize to me for taking me there again when we knew bad things happen every time we try. I didn't want to pay for any of the disaster. I didn't think we should need to when it was almost inedible and took hours of our time. Ended up not paying for the entrées.  It is a cool restaurant with neat decor and I'm sad that I will never get to have another Berry Burst Cider, but we've had more bad experiences at BJ's than any other restaurant we've ever tried to like."
Alexander C.,"Houston, TX",25,104,14,4.0,9/19/2011,"BJ's is a pretty cool place and our trips usually begin with someone saying, ""Raise your hand if you want BJ's!"". I've never been over/under impressed with this place. Some like to compare it to 'Cheesecake Factory' but I think their menu gives me less anxiety.  I always order the avocado egg rolls and they are great, the sauce is this dish's main attraction. The deep dish pizzas are good, the sandwiches too but the pasta dishes are HUGE. There are no lunch portions on Sunday so you'll probably go home with leftovers. The desserts are equally as good with oversized portions. This is not a place that gives you mediocre food with huge portions.  I'm not of a drinker but they many options of brew including their own.  The food is good and they have options for everyone."
San E.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,40,1,2.0,3/9/2014,"I've been here so many times, And the service is the WORST! I called to place a Togo order, and my mom left the house to go pick it up, so when she gets there the order would be ready. Well, when I called they put me on hold. For ELEVEN MINUTES. So I finally hung up, and called back. While I was on the line with them, my mom called, saying she's there and they don't have my order. MAYBE BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET TO ORDER BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON HOLD. I was SO mad. And the worst part? They didn't even say sorry. Or give a discount. I mean NOTHING. So my mom had to sit there and wait for my food. Now for another horrible experience. I went there yesterday with a small group and ordered chicken wings, and two pizza with no chicken (it came with chicken) After 30 mins of waiting, the pizza came, with chicken on it. So then he took it back, and then 20 mins later brought one of the pizza back, but said he dropped the other pizza so they're making it. So we began to eat the first pizza. My wings were no where to be found, as the waiter was also no where to be found. We had no silverware so we had to get up and get some from the other table. Not once the whole time did we get a refill. We were complaining how thirsty we were. Then 20 mins later he brought my wings, but I told him (its been so long, and I ate the pizza that's here, so I'm not hungry anymore. We're all full now so cancel the other pizza that's still cooking, and take the wings back."" There's been so many other horrible experiences too but those are just a few. As for food, the pizza is really good. The avocado rolls are okay. The French fries are really thin but good.  The jalapeño burger is good but the meat is fatty and over burnt and thick. The potato skins are okay, nothing special. Those buffalo chicken wonton things are REALLY good. The pasta is whatever. And of course the pazookie, it's really good! Warm and soft! The strawberry lemonade is the best!"
Jessica G.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,20,5,4.0,4/15/2015,"Depending when you go depends on the service you get.  Everyone is usually very nice, but can be very slow at times.  The food is always excellent though!"
Christina T.,"Pearland, TX",15,17,,2.0,8/5/2014,"Went in last night around 11:15. The greeter was on the phone, not pleasant or inviting. We were seated at a booth. We waited about 10 mins for someone to come to us. My friend was ready to get up and leave. Our server was very monotone and kept asking us if we wanted any food because ""last call is in 20 minutes "" whatever. It was a little rude but not a big deal. We didn't complain abt having to wait either. I ordered a peach sangria. Tastes nasty and not peachy at all. All I could taste was liquor. The same server who was waiting on a family of 4 seemed to want to please them more. Even the manager kept going to their table to make sure they were okay. Fine no problem. Meanwhile other servers are behind us on their phone taking pictures. Manager doesn't care about this apparently . Overall horrible service horrible servers. Only thing good are the pizookies. Never coming here again ."
Alan S.,"Houston, TX",657,1413,293,4.0,10/27/2008,"Been back to BJ's a few times since my first review.  I tend to go for lunch which is nice since there usually is not a wait at 1230 or 1 as compared to trying to go for dinner.  I am a big fan of their Soup and Salad combo.  It's about $6-7 and its as much as you want.  The Caesar salad is delicious!  The chili is pretty good, and is defiantly unique.  My dad is a huge fan of their clam chowder.  I recommend trying this or one of their other lunch specials... their lunch menu prices are much better than their normal ones!"
Steve M.,"Missouri City, TX",0,50,86,1.0,2/16/2014,"Food was okay, service was worth 10% tip at best.  We accidently left our to-go box and we were literally two steps out the door and they threw it away.  Yes, it was our fault, but the staff acted like they did not care, they could have at least held it for two minutes to see if we were going to return.  Needless to say we will not be back, now I remember why we have not been back in seven years."
Grace C.,"Energy Corridor, Houston, TX",14,46,75,5.0,9/9/2013,"Tonight is our one month wedding anniversary, of course Jason forgot, but I told him we have to celebrate it. We drove around for a while looking for a place and he said, how about BJ's? Why not? We ordered the fried artichoke for appetizer, and it was great in my opinion but Jason said my homemade lemon garlic butter sauce is better than the lemon garlic sauce it came with :) he may be just making up for forgetting the anniversary. I love artichokes but wasn't crazy about the thick crispy breading, so I won't order this appetizer again. For the main entree, our server recommended Tuscan Chicken Limone and Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Jason's salmon was full of wonderful spices. My chicken Limone was very creamy and rich but not overwhelming. The artichoke mixed well with angel hair pasta in the lemony sauce, once you add sun dried tomatoes on top, it just doesn't get any better than that! Or does it? Yes, the chicken is actually the best part. Tender, juicy, thinly pounded and breaded, soaked in lemon goodness, each little bit is a little taste of heaven. During our meal, our funny and resourceful waiter Jacob brought a sample of his favorite beer Jeremiah Red for Jason. His report on this Irish style ale is tasty, rich and smooth. We were going to skip dessert tonight but Jacob said BJ's is famous for its pizookie and how can we past that up? We ordered white chocolate macadamian nut, raspberry white chocolate, and triple chocolate. The trio did not disappoint. Needless to say, we will be back."
Michael L.,"Wharton, TX",156,44,16,3.0,9/29/2013,"Very good food, service was below average, and the price was perfect."
Lourdes C.,"La Porte, TX",0,3,,1.0,4/19/2014,"I come to BJ's all the time and the food is always great and the service is just as good, however that was not the case at this location. We were properly greeted and sat by the hosts, but once we were sat, it was ten minutes at least until we were greeted and then another fifteen minutes just to get our beverages and the service never got any better. The food was great as always, but it did not make up for the quality of service. We were about 10 minutes into waiting for our desserts when my daughter, who used to work at a different location and is familiar with their protocol, went to speak to a manager about our experience. She just made excuses for the server and said they'd been busy. It was 10:30 and the restaurant was filled but not overwhelmingly full. Though they offered to comp our desserts she never really apologized and didn't seem to care, so we left feeling like service and standards mean nothing here. Definitely the worst BJ's location I have been to date."
