Ashley A.,"Wimberley, TX",91,37,129,4.0,7/31/2013,"The food here is absolutely delicious! I can't rave enough about the watermelon/ feta cheese salad. My boyfriend tried a flight of their craft beers and he was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. We went on a busy Saturday night and had to wait for a seat, but they got us seated by the time quoted. It wasn't long at all. I got the appetizer sampler as my meal because I couldn't decide on what I wanted since everything on the menu sounded so good. I couldn't have been happier. I anticipated getting dessert, but couldn't because I was so full. I can't wait to go again."
Dan H.,"Houston, TX",45,197,4,3.0,6/3/2011,"Having been to the location in Dallas years ago I wanted to give this one a try too..  This place isnt bad, but the food is just average.. I did however enjoy the beer they had on tap, but I'm no expert in beer so it might be just a preference.. The wait was a bit long, but it was a weekend and every family in Sugarland seemed to be eating here at the time..I will say that our service was very good when we managed to get a table..  While the prices are low and the beer is solid, I just don't see us hurrying back for the food.."
Jason P.,"Houston, TX",117,217,55,3.0,8/24/2010,"Returned last night after half of Sugar Land lost power from a thunderstorm. They told us at the door that all they were serving was fried appetizers and pizza. Good enough for us! We were just happy to find a restaurant that was open considering the electrical drama going on up and down Hwy 6. We opted for the flatbread pizzas: The Margherita Fresca and the Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage. Pretty good! And both came out quickly, as did our appetizer (calamari). Nothing spectacular, but good enough that I felt obligated to give these guys another star."
Tammy B.,"Houston, TX",8,42,,3.0,8/10/2011,"Food was good.  I am thankful for their gluten-free items, although they are a little hard to find in the ""war and peace"" sized menu.  I ordered the pork chops and substituted broccoli for the mashed potatoes (b/c i'm sensitive to dairy also).. I appreciated the flexibility to make substitutions.  I also enjoyed the Redbridge gluten free beer, which tasted light and refreshing.  I haven't had a beer for 8 months since being diagnosed with gluten intolerance, so it was a treat.  Unfortunately, the server was quite slow, and minimally attentive.  Also, one of our menus contained ""extra"" contents of somebody's slimy jelly.  Gross.  Hence the 3 star rating, but I would probably go back again.."
Kate W.,"Ithaca, NY",28,300,38,4.0,8/28/2010,"I guess I've never really read the full name of this place because I was surprised when we went there for dinner last weekend.  There was a 25 minute wait to get a table, so we headed in to the bar to get a beer and then take it out to the waiting area outside.  I was pleasantly surprised by all the taps (this is when I realized that they call themselves a brewhouse and therefore probably have a larger beer selection).  They are, indeed, a ""brewhouse"" (though I got the impression that they claim smaller breweries's beers as ""house brews""... who knows.). I found the way they did their samplers a little obnoxious, but the beer itself was varied and good.  That berry brew was an insult to beers the world over, but I didn't really expect it to be anything but horrifyingly gross when I ordered it.  They only allow 4 samples at a time, don't give them to you in flights (this is a pain if you're trying to carry them and drinks for others out to where you're waiting outside), only do samples of some of the beers on draught, and refer to all of their brews by the type and not the full name.  When there's more than one lager on tap and I'm trying to taste every beer in the place, having the bartender/server tell me that ""This is the lager"" as though there's only one lager on earth is a little annoying.  And when I ordered them by name, they didn't always know which beer it was unless I said ""the stout"" or what have you. Anyways, the food is pretty good.  We ordered everything to share (except for my niece's mac and cheese, though I decided she could share anyways) and it was quite good.  The caprese salad in particular is a good sharing dish--they do the little grape tomatoes and mozzarella balls with perfect dressing, so it's easier to share than you would think a salad would be.  Even the lettuce garnish was tasty (I'd had about 6 tasters by then, sue me)! Their approach to seating when it's busy is pretty idiotic, though.  I can't imagine that we would have had to wait half an hour if they'd seated couples at tables for 2 instead of the 6-top booths.  Then they tried to put our party of 5 at a square table clearly designed for no more than 4 that was right in the most heavily trafficked area of the restaurant.  Really?  Not a good idea for us or for their servers, who would have had to dodge and weave around us like it was an obstacle course.  We asked for a different table, so they moved us to another 4-top that was 1 table in from the heavily trafficked area.... better, but not great.  I'm very surprised that there were so many couples at those huge booths--they need hosts who know how to say no on a busy night.  It was just silly."
Lyndsey S.,"Dripping Springs, TX",25,132,159,1.0,11/15/2012,"I'm not really sure why people pile into this place.  I've never had a good experience and my mom went a couple of times hoping for something better each time.  As for my experience, I went in with my husband and ordered a side salad and lasagna.  My salad came first.  The lettuce wasn't even cut right.  I had to use a knife just to fit it into my mouth.  I hate iceberg lettuce because of this.  My lasagna came and I instantly recognized the tomato sauce as the same flavor that's on frozen pizzas.  It's not homemade.  It was a total turn off.  I passed it onto my husband and because he eats anything, he thought it was okay.  If I have to pass on food, it must be bad because I can eat!  At least make your own sauce or make it taste better than frozen sauce or every other restaurant.  I wonder if they just went to HEB and bought a frozen lasagna.  Wouldn't surprise me. As far as my mom's experience goes, she has met a few friends at BJs and they can't seem to get things together.  Anything from handing her the wrong food, the waiters leaving for long periods of time without giving out silverware, pouring the wrong drinks, forgetting to bring the check, giving her food to the wrong table and so on.  I just don't get why this place is good."
Kate A.,"Sugar Land, TX",124,430,16,5.0,6/2/2013,"I came here on a Saturday with my fiance to check out the restaurant as a possible place to hold a corporate recognition dinner. The place is big and OPEN. The bar is to the right, the seating area is in the middle, and there's a section to the left that can be reserved for private parties. The one minor note I'd like to add is that some of the chandeliers' cords block the televisions, so be sure to sit in the bar area if you want to watch a sports game. We sat in the middle section and our server was busy but visited our table frequently. We ordered the fried artichokes as an appetizer and yowza! They're delicious! It comes with an aoli dipping sauce that I recommend you use sparingly, but it's still yum. For our meal, I ordered the roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread. I had to use a fork to help eat up the veggies that fell onto the plate. It was great! The bread wasn't too soggy nor was it too crispy. The vegetables were not dried out and the pairing with the goat cheese- awesome. My fiance ordered the small deep dish pepperoni pizza. Hmm... not sure what to say here because I felt torn. My family is from Chicago so when I hear ""deep dish pizza"" I think of lots of meats, sauce, and cheeses. Sorry to say but BJ's Restaurant's deep dish pizza is mostly just extra bread. It was still delicious, but just not what I imagine when I hear ""deep dish pizza."" The staff is incredibly patient, friendly, and prompt. I will be coming back here again as I booked a corporate dinner to be held here. You can't go wrong with great food, great beers, and amazing service!"
Salim G.,"Richmond, TX",324,211,8,3.0,5/9/2013,"We are usually big fans of this place, but this trip around wasn't so pleasing.  Over the top I will tell you that there was nothing wrong with the pizza.  The pizza was right on point, but it was the service and"
John S.,"Tempe, AZ",7,47,1,4.0,8/12/2013,Great beer selection and the food is pretty good.  I love the seared ahi salad!
Dwight P.,"Sugar Land, TX",30,23,4,5.0,10/24/2012,"Great meal last night - great place to watch the game and also to enjoy a full bar and happy hours! If you are a pizza guy/ or gal, this is your place to go!"
Kevin L.,"Stafford, TX",29,2,1,5.0,11/16/2011,The Mini Bruschetta was amazing and cheap.  It was just enough food to get your taste bubs warmed up for your main course.  Try the New Crispy Jalapeno Burger!!  Top 5 burger I've ever eaten.
John P.,"Katy, TX",27,38,2,4.0,10/28/2013,"Always love the sweet pig pizza, and avacado egg rolls. Atmosphere is sports oriented a bar sits open to restaurant dining which during games can be noisy for dining. I don't get a warm feeling from any of the staff but I keep coming back so I give it a 4"
Krissy L.,"Missouri City, TX",0,7,,4.0,1/18/2014,I would call the burgers and fries average to slightly above average. Four stars though for the extremely friendly staff and the avocado eggroll appetizer that was delicious. A burger and fries plate was about $11.
Jake F.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,13,4,2.0,6/7/2014,"If you are in a hurry do not come here. The service is very slow and the food is average at best. I had the California Flatbread, not much on it and vey little flavor (Chili's is way better). Wife had Chicken Fried Steak, not very good and not very tasty (Go to Texas Roadhouse instead). The others in our party did like what they ordered. Daughter ordered the Pazookie which every one enjoyed but it took a long time for it to come out. Next time order it to go."
Emily C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",16,175,1,4.0,3/29/2012,"MMM....I really really like this place because of their happy hour menu and their pizza.  Their pizza is so tasty and it is the deep dish style.  They have sliders on their happy hour menu too.  Some of their appetizers, however, do not taste too great...but I just stick with the pizza and sliders and potato skins."
Avi T.,"Houston, TX",6,30,,2.0,10/20/2012,"Feels like am in a Bennigans from the 2000s. Everything is ok. Beer is good. Drinks not so good. Service, cleanliness and organization all: OK"
G J.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,6,,2.0,11/27/2013,"Have been there a few times and the service keeps getting worse and worse.  Food that shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes to arrive, takes at least an hour and the follow up is pitiful. Have had to ask for condiments repeatedly from more than one person to get them.  The food is great, but hopefully this place will train their staff better. Should the customer service continue to decline, I will no longer go there and will also let others know of the lack of customer service."
April M.,"Panama City, FL",16,81,3,3.0,2/5/2011,Atmosphere and decor make this truly a fun place to go. Especially if you like to try different beers.  With my deep love for nachos I can't help but indulge in the giant mound of Piranha Pale Ale Nachos!  Can be a bit pricey to eat there often but if you are looking for someplace to break up monotony or take some friends it is fantastic.
Maggie M.,"Katy, TX",0,36,5,5.0,8/5/2013,"Have always enjoyed coming to BJ's, the quality of the food has always been great, and service has been better than average for the area.  The only thing that was a bit disappointing on our last visit was that the deep dish pizzas aren't served in the Pan anymore, instead they come out on a regular plate.  There was something special about the pan being served on the stand  on the table.  Pizzokies are still amazing!"
Kelly S.,"Stafford, TX",0,8,,2.0,8/1/2013,I went in to BJ's for a late lunch and ordered an ultimate burger medium..  However it arrived well done. I brought it to the servers attention and they immediately took it back and began to cook another burger..  Alas it arrived well done again .. At this point I did not want to wait for another attempt.  The saving grace during my visit was the service which was on point and friendly. The bartender and another server did their best however they could not control the problems with the kitchen.  I give the service an A+. But since there were two attempts to fix what should be an easy menu item to prepare. The food and kitchen get an F
