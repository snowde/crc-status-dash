Julie S.,"Houston, TX",0,17,1,2.0,4/30/2013,"Okay, SO the food was amazing.. My server was Raven. She sucked. Didn't refill my my mothers drink until after dinner WHEN WE ASKED HER TO. Forgot to put in our order for dessert. She never checked on us and brought us our check before we could order coffee (which we planned on ordering). We finished our pizookies with empty glasses. If you come here, specifically ask to NOT sit in Raven' section unless you want bad service."
Brandon F.,"Sugar Land, TX",9,10,,1.0,3/11/2012,I walked in was not greeted by anyone. The hostess seemed confused and could not find us a table although there was an empty one right in the front. We ended up sitting at that exact table. Service was slow. We waited for a while no waiter ever came. Menus were very dirty and had plenty of dry food on it. We ended up walking right out
Ellen C.,"Houston, TX",506,824,1186,2.0,3/24/2010,"BJ's is one of those chain restaurants that just really feels like a chain restaurant and is especially not vegan friendly - hence the two stars.  I've accompanied friends here and have just slowly sipped on my drink and dabbled a little in the chips and salsa while they ate (they're pretty run of the mill here, surprised?). The menu seems to offer the same kind of appetizers, soups, salads, etc. as Chili's or other super successful chain restaurants.  Basically it's all fail safe stuff - nothing adventurous or daring for the more sophisticated palate, but I suppose you would expect that from a chain restaurant!  Granted it's a huuuge menu, so I guess if you don't have strict dietary restrictions, like me - you'll find something that will tickle your fancy.  There are vegetarian entrees, but none that would seem really easily veganized.  This particular location is quite spacious, so it'd be a prime location for a family gathering or a graduation dinner! I've shockingly never tried their beer . . . so I would possibly consider coming here again for that, but as far as the food goes and the really large happy friendly family atmosphere - meh, doesn't tickle MY fancy."
Ski Bunny H.,"Sugar Land, TX",5,92,63,5.0,10/2/2013,"Bj is good their veggie pizza has some onions on it that I'm addicted to I don't know why, their root beer is good too"
Chelsea S.,"Sugar Land, TX",46,78,154,5.0,4/12/2012,"I've pretty much loved this place ever since it opened in the area. Seeing it pop up in other areas around Houston is awesome too. BJ's opened when I wasn't of drinking age yet so I never got to experience their special beers till a few years later, but I pretty much fell in love with their crispy chicken sandwich and their pizookies. So much so that it became a favorite place of mine to eat around Sugar Land. When I would come home from college on the weekends, I'd always suggest to eat here with the family.  When I saw that one had opened in San Antonio just by randomly driving by, to say I was excited is an understatement. Friends at the time had never heard of the place or ever eaten there, so my enthusiasm for the restaurant was unfounded to them. But they found my loud vocal declaration, ""I love BJ's,"" in the middle of parking lot of a small Mexican restaurant amusing, while I realized a few seconds too late what else that implied. Yes, there were on-lookers, but you know what? I'm not ashamed!  Anyways, like I said I love the food here. Finally when I was of age I got to try one of their hand-crafted beers. The name of it escapes me, since I normally don't go there to drink but it was fruity, kind of like a berry taste and I do remember that it was good. Back to the food, my favorite thing to order here and which is always default is the crispy chicken sandwich. The combination of their fried chicken strips or tenderloins, honey mustard and the cheese garlic bread roll is pretty much what perfection tastes like. So good! Their potato wedges are also some of my favorite potato wedges I've ever had in life and that's not a sarcastic exaggeration at all, I genuinely really love those fries! I also love their deep dish pizza. One of my good friends and I come here often whenever we meet up since ironically there is also a BJ's in The Woodlands where she lives and our go-to order is always a medium pepperoni and sausage deep dish pizza. It's so good and never mind the fact that we are ALWAYS starving before we go here, but it's even better that the pizza is one of the most delicious things ever. Other items I've had here are exceptional also, I don't recall ever ordering something that I didn't like or was disappointed over except maybe their special or hand-crafted sodas. Their ""cream"" soda doesn't even really taste like a dreamsicle, but more like orange fanta with a slight ""cream"" after taste. Pretty nasty in my opinion, I'll just stick to the strawberry lemonade. Certainly doesn't negate all the positives about BJ's for me however. Definitely still a favorite of mine."
Kevin H.,"Houston, TX",9,27,1,5.0,2/15/2011,"I live in the Heights, so BJ's Pizza is a long haul, but I make it happily whenever I can. Get a half Sweet Pig, half BBQ Chicken pizza, a home-brewed beer and a Pizooki ... All fantastic. I've been to the original BJ's in Santa Ana, CA, and it's clear that the franchising of the restaurant hasn't taken away any of the quality. Best: Pizza crust and Pizooki."
Susan K.,"Houston, TX",199,62,18,5.0,2/17/2010,"Love, Love, Love it !!! Great food and Great prices !! It's clean, great service and the atmosphere is fantastic !!  It's a Great place to take your family or to have an intimate dinner for two! They have a Great wine list and of course great choices of beer and they have a wonderful bar with big screen TVs, which BTW are all over the restaurant !  I recommend BJ's 5 out of 5 for food, atmosphere and over all great service !! You have to check them out!!"
Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",579,1012,914,4.0,8/10/2008,"BJ's functions as the Two Rows of Sugar Land. It's a great location to go if you're looking to leave Kona or Baker Street. There's a full bar and custom beer (I'm partial to the Blonde, Red and Porter, and tend to stay away from the Hefe), so if you're looking to hang out and converse during late night, this is the Sugar Land place to be. Food-wise, it's slightly better than your average ""bar food"" restaurant (but also pricier). The pizzas are the biggest draw here, and I'm partial to the buffalo or BBQ chicken ones. They're gigantic, so make sure that you ration out generously! There's also ample TV viewing for the sports fan."
Bruce H.,"Matthews, NC",9,10,,3.0,3/21/2013,"They have some tasty beers, but the atmosphere is a bit cold for a ""brewhouse"". The Hop Storm IPA is worth a stop if you like hoppy beers."
Hyejoon M.,"Houston, TX",43,25,,5.0,3/28/2012,"Portions are great, and the atmosphere is wonderful. Get the jambalaya definitely, it has a spicy cajun flavor to it with a kick."
Salma A.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,7,,1.0,9/30/2014,"I loved this place for years and been a regular customer so writing a horrible review  is really heartbreaking. I went in for lunch the other day and ordered a deep dish pizza. By the time I got to my second slice and started chewing I tasted something weird and chewy. I spat the bite out to see what it was and saw there was a sticker in my pizza, yes a STICKER! It was off of a food package from the kitchen and it had an expiration date written with ink pen along with some more code numbers. We were sooo disappointed and we had to complain to the manager. The reply we got was an apology and they took the pizza off our bill, but still it didn't do justice for such a hugeeee mistake! I'll now have to think twice before going into this restaurant and eating anything from there."
Clarisse C.,"Houston, TX",63,66,28,3.0,7/17/2012,"Amazing appetizers, and good drinks! The circular booths for groups are comfortable and beautiful, as well as the ornate mirrors strewn across the walls. The service is friendly, though they do take a while. Have everyone's orders ready (drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert) in one or two go's to avoid waiting too long. This is a good restaurant to take friends or loved ones who want a variety of quality American food."
April C.,"Houston, TX",130,411,70,4.0,8/26/2009,"I've been to this location several times. My sister had them cater her son's 4th bday party. The service was great - they went above and beyond in making sure we had everything we needed (plates, ketchup, plastic ware, etc.).  Everyone loved the pizza.  Most kids' bday parties consist of Domino's or the like, so I'm sure it was appreciated to have this. I love BJ's Favorite Deep Dish pizza. It's one of the best pizzas I've had. It doesn't seem too doughy because it has the perfect amount of crunch to the crust. They do not skimp you on the toppings either.  I took away one star because the service is not always the best, but I love the variety of beers and the pizza is super tasty!  The appetizer sampler is good too.  The dessert... it's basically an over-sized warm cookie with icecream.  Can't go wrong there!"
Dasha H.,"Houston, TX",223,12,,1.0,1/3/2014,"Let me begin by saying that I use to LOVE BJ's I would drag all of my friends here all the time because there food was so awesome. This last time could have been the worse service I have ever received. The waitstaff huddled near a computer in the corner gossiping while tables went un greeted and drinks around the dining room were empty. My waiter Kimberly even took my empty drink glass gossiped in the corner for a few minutes than walked past me again and finally brought my glass back. This is after my drink sat empty for my entire meal. Now on to the food I had the avocado egg rolls which were really good but I would have enjoyed them more had they not came out at the same time as my entree. Kimberly walked up right behind the food runner and said 'oops sorry guys' and was never to be seen for the rest of our meal. The chicken spaghetti is one of my favs but this time it was very bland and not spicy at all. Overall pretty disappointing. I always give a restaurant another shot if they blow it. however, I had contacted BJ's about my experience and never heard anything back. I now see why they have such poor waitstaff because it seems company wide they don't give a damn about there customer."
Maria L.,"Atlanta, GA",28,200,,3.0,4/14/2010,"I've been here a few times and loved their deep dish pizza (can't remember which toppings I actually got...), so on my most recent visit I ordered a medium pizza ($20.00) to split with my mom. We got 1/2 barbecue chicken pizza and 1/2 spinach with artichokes. My dad ordered (or rather I ordered for him...) parmesan crusted chicken (with sides of broccoli and rice). The food took a while to come out - 20 min more or less (?) which was expected for the pizza to bake. The pizza this time was fairly good, not as good as I remembered it. I love how on the crust there's an edge of crispiness to it, but maybe because I've been eating so many thin crust pizzas lately, their thick crust tasted a little too heavy/oily for my taste. BBQ chicken needed more BBQ flavor. Spinach with artichokes was a bit heavy on the cheese.  I tried a couple bites of my dad's entree and it was very good, although it could have benefited from less of the sauce (lemon chardonnary butter sauce) on top. He was happy with his meal and called it ""delicious!"" Anyway, I wish my schedule were such that I could go back to BJs for lunch because I really want to get their chicken tenders + fries lunch special again... it was a while ago but I still remember the succulent, tender meat, lightly breaded just the way I like it. And it was only $5.99! Talk about a deal.  Oh, and as for service, our waiter was very nice. Only thing was it took a long time to get our check and then to get our card swiped, so there were some moments where we strained our necks looking around for our waiter... the restaurant was very busy... *shrug* Anyway back to the pizza. My mom and I ate about 60% of the pizza. I left the restaurant STuFFed, with plenty of leftovers for lunch. And major food coma! Will be back, but probably to try the entrees next time."
Jourdan V.,"Sugar Land, TX",14,143,2,3.0,11/10/2011,This is just classy comfort food. Service is good for the most part. I enjoy the bar area lots of tv's and a great liquor selection.
Gary C.,"Fripp Island, SC",197,408,644,2.0,5/20/2012,"Bad Timing?  Late Night when most of the restaurants are closed,  we decided to stop in BJ's.  We were Greeted warmly and immediate seated.  That's where the fun stopped.  We sat for at least five Min's.  Being passed by several servers,  before I stopped one and asked if they were closing.  ""No, We're not closing"" said the server,  I'll get you a Server.  Another Five minutes passed when I stopped another server to ask ""Do I need to order at the bar?"".  Finally, a conscientious server who was finished for the night,  put her apron on to help us.  She explained that the power failed and the computers were frozen.  Hmm?  Well,  we finally got our order from an apologetic Bar tender and our appetizers were on the house.  The Appetizers were Typical of a Chain Bar / Restaurant.  The Jury is still out.  We'll have to try again before we pass judgment."
Prince V.,"Danbury, CT",20,250,,2.0,6/10/2012,Service was slow on saturday evening. it took us to leave 3 hours to leave the restaurant. burger was not juicy. Just slow. Wont go back here again...
Mariam K.,"Chicago, IL",196,134,61,5.0,9/5/2013,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I live in Chicago but come to Houston often and always make sure I make a trip to BJ's every time! The food is consistently good, the menu caters to everyone, there's all sorts of stuff to choose from and I have yet to get something that I hate. I came here the other day and had a flight to catch and had exactly one hour and our waitress got us our drinks, appetizers, food, and dessert all in that time and even gave us plastic cups we could take for our drive to the airport. My usual items that I always order are sante fe egg rolls, buffalo chicken pizza, potato skin, their baked potato, their bruschetta, and their pizookies. All those items are AMAZING and will not disappoint you! Their pizookies are really just big cookies baked and served with ice cream, but they are to die for - simple, yet so good... not sure what they put in their cookies that make them so addicting. Even if I don't have time to eat here whenever I come, I make sure to stop by for just dessert. Great food, amazing service, fun atmosphere.. as good as it gets!"
Alexander M.,"Houston, TX",0,13,,1.0,2/19/2013,"If you're the type that enjoys bland frozen meals from Walmart, then this is the place for you!  Note to BJ: it's a dead give away when your menu is big enough to accommodate the writing of a space opera and varied enough to otherwise require an army of well trained chefs."
