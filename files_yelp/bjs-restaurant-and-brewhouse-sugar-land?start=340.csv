Neeraj J.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,4/26/2014,Bad service.  Took us 1 hour to get the starters and another 2 for main course.  The servers were completely lost and were not able to manage.  There was food but no plates on the table.  Overall very bad experience.
Christopher B.,"Missouri City, TX",1,27,,5.0,7/24/2010,"Always consistent.  We love BJ's.  Never disappointed in the quality of the food or the service. Not sure what is happening with the other reviews, but these guys do it right."
Breana R.,"Houston, TX",1,12,,3.0,5/23/2012,"The food here is pretty pricey but consistently good every time I have been there. The only problem I have is the service because it SUCKS! The waiter greeted us with what sounded like a rehearsed greeting, and she brought me the wrong beer. The food took forever despite us being just about the only people there, and she kept avoiding us when it was time for the check. Once my fiance and I went for dinner and the waiter forgot our appetizers and another instance, my mother asked for more dressing for her salad and they brought her the wrong dressing and argued with her when she said it was wrong.  For the price that you pay, you would think the service would be better."
Heather S.,"Rosenberg, TX",18,2,1,1.0,4/2/2014,"I usually think BJs is a pretty cool place, however, this experience probably changed my mind forever.  First of all it wasn't very crowded, but the hostess thought everyone in the restaurant should sit together.  Our waiter came off a little impatient as I was on a date tonight. When I finally decided on what to get I was ordering a black and bleu burger and requested the Parmesan crusted bun they listed on their house burger.  Well he says I'll see if I can do that. They brought out out appetizer which was pretty good, it was interrupted about 2 minutes after with our entrees. A waitress asked if she could take the appetizer we just got out of our way... I had to remind her that she literally just set it on the table. She replied with an ""oh yeah"".  Well she set my ""burger"" down and it was cut up, charred and on a French roll.  I told our waiter it wasn't a Parmesan crusted roll, it was clearly a French roll. So he said something like wait let me see the menu, proceeded to look at it and said ""we don't have that"". So I say okay... He asked if I wanted a regular bun. About ten minutes later he comes back and sets this burger in front of me. This burger was un carefully pieced back together from the French roll mess they had previously brought me. I told him it was unacceptable and I didn't want it... Then, and only then did he offer to get it recooked.  I have never worked in a restaurant but I don't think I could ever serve that to someone.. Especially a place like BJs. Let's just say I'm pretty disappointed and hungry."
Kris S.,"Stafford, TX",1,2,,1.0,8/10/2011,Horrible!!!! Service sucked.  Wrong food brought to the table - twice!  Food quality was very poor.  2 pasta dishes were under cooked and lacked flavor! Don't waste your time or money!
Jennifer L.,"Lubbock, TX",60,25,,5.0,12/1/2011,"The food and the beer are great (way above average for a brewery/sports bar type place), there are four TVs together at the bar so this place will be perfect for March Madness, and I always get good service. Earlier this week I attended their beer tasting, and haven't been that impressed since I ate at Brennan's (totally different experience, different reasons for being impressed). The Director of Brewery Operations really knows his stuff - the food he paired with each beer was perfect, the beers were very good as well, the portions were so generous that I left some on the table (yes, I walked away from good beer), and he made it a lot of fun."
Cameron H.,"Houston, TX",160,348,,2.0,2/11/2012,"Just wanted to post an update. After seeing the absolutely ABYSMAL rating this place had from all here on Yelp(myself included), I took the liberty of e-mailing BJ's. I basically told them it's obvious that they don't care about anything. If they did, they'd be on here looking at these reviews. Any good restaurant manager will do that. It's a necessity nowadays. I told him that the ratings, along with the stories, are absolutely RIDICULOUS. He has apparently contacted the Sugar Land locations GM and assures me of further e-mails to let me know what will happen."
Jason K.,"Houston, TX",17,16,,3.0,1/5/2009,"The BJ's chain caught my interest as I thought it was an actual brewpub, but it turns out while most of their restaurants have their own beer it wasn't brewed on premises.  According to their website, it would have to be a BJ's Restaurant and Brewery to have the beer brewed on site.  As far as I can tell, the beers at these locations in Houston are contract brewed at Saint Arnold brewery, but that hasn't been confirmed. There is good parking and great seating available at this location and I've never had to wait  too long for a table, but that might have been a happy coincidence. The food here is pretty good and I love the wide variety of options they have available.  None are the best meal I've ever had, but they are all good for a tasty evening.  I do highly recommend the pazookie (sp) which is a huge warmed cookie on a plate with ice cream on top.  It's excellent.  I have yet to try the pizza, which is supposed to be one of their signature items as there are too many other things that catch my eye (open faced sandwiches, oh yes), but they do look pretty good from seeing one at another table. The beer is what I came for and it didn't disappoint, even though it wasn't brewed on site.  I really like their nitro porter and imperial stout, both are wonderful with the previously mentioned pazookie.  Their Red Ale is a happy hoppy brew to have with almost any meal."
Halleh F.,"Toronto, Canada",0,28,,3.0,5/20/2014,"Beers are great, food is ok, service is super slow! Server did not take our order until long after our appetizers were done. We ordered appetizers asked her to give us a few minutes to order our entrees and we never saw her again and the restaurant wasn't even busy. I'm in the service industry and I am super understanding when a restaurant is busy and I just got annoyed at the slow service. Food is average nothing to write home about. The craft beers are amazing so I recommend this place for beers."
Justin H.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,10,,5.0,9/20/2012,We've been back several times since my initial review.  We had one small issue with an order one time that was dealt with quickly and kindly.  We've tried a number of different entrees and have been overall very happy with the food and the service.  We love the pizzookie and get some every time!
Miguel G.,"Houston, TX",3,42,2,4.0,4/7/2009,"BJ's is the place in Sugar Land for great beer and good tasting, comfort food. I've always been partial to the great white and buffalo chicken deep-dish pizzas. The Avocado Egg Roll appetizer is pretty tasty as well. This place always seems to be crowded but I'm usually able to find a table in the bar area. Great atmosphere also."
Eren M.,"Austin, TX",252,89,317,4.0,10/16/2008,"Oh how I hate to love the deep dish pizza served here.Their pizza is simply scrumptious! Not to mention all the different kinds they have:  Mediterranean, vegetarian, barbeque, spinach & artichoke, cheese & tomato, specialty or traditional calzones, they even have one for burger lovers ...they're all great.   I come here often with co-workers for lunch. Their menu has other options including salads, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, baby back ribs and more, but their pizza is at the top of everyone's list including mine of course.  I know they also carry their own handcrafted beer, but I have never dined here besides my lunch break, so I have yet to try it. It seems like a decent place for a happy hour...who knows I may check it out one of these days. Overall, their service is pretty consistent, I just wish they had more locations. The only other location I know of is in the Willobrook area which is far from where I live, maybe its better that way,or I would be ordering their pizza for take out every other day!"
David C.,"Campbell, CA",86,412,14,3.0,9/19/2008,"If you like your server discreetly hovering up to your table every 5 minutes, BJ's isn't for you. The service does often suck, however, but expect it. This is a very casual, fun place. Weekends get a little crazy and it is nice to marvel at a successful business while waiting for the waiter to bring your drinks. Definitely remember to ""call ahead"" on weekends. It is their version of taking reservations, I believe... Pricey for the food it serves: sandwiches, pizza, burgers, salads. Look to pay $15-20 for a pizza dinner with a drink and a tip. Sadly, I might just have to say it is worth it when it comes to the pizza. Their deep dish pizza is the best pizza I've had. I know all about the popular pizza places-- Star, Candelari's, etc. I am a pizza expert, no joke. While those restaurants are awesome, BJ's deep dish pizza is my personal favorite.  I like this place for what it is. If the service was fussier and the tables were draped in white linen, I'd probably drop it a star."
Nicole c.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,39,,1.0,1/26/2014,Went today for lunch and waited almost 10 min for the hostess to decide where to seat us because we needed a highchair and they are only allowed to be in certain places in the restaurant. When we finally got seated we sat there for 15 min while the waitress continued to walk past our table and never acknowledged us then we got up and left. Worst place ever!!!!
Jeff C.,"Rosenberg, TX",0,15,,5.0,2/23/2014,"This spot has the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, wait can be a little long at times but wait staff is always helpful and friendly.  My daughter loves the root beer which is made in house, we go as often as we can.  Would recommend it to all our friends."
Dan C.,"Washington, DC",62,218,367,2.0,4/29/2010,"I seem to be on a 2 -2.5 star rampage, but recent circumstances seem to be putting me into this land of mediocrity! Let me start off by saying that I like BJ's (no, get your mind out of the gutter!) and have had ample experience eating in other locations. When I lived in Las Vegas, I would frequent the BJ's on W. Charleston Blvd more than several times a year. For me, It was a post climbing ritual where you could relax in the a/c while carb loading on their tasty barley pops and delicious deep dish pizzas. I was always impressed with the food quality and service I received there. In fact, I would easily give that particular chain location a solid 3.5 - 4 stars. Not so, here. On a recent visit to Houston, we agreed to meet some old friends at this particular location for a late Sunday lunch. We ordered the avocado app, a side salad and the mini spinach artichoke pizza. Again, I had much experience with these items before - they were usually the staple of my post-outdoors excursions out west. My friends ordered a couple of sandwiches with steak fries. We also had a few brews to go along with the meal - I've tried all of their brews and they're pretty decent. For some reason today, I just wanted their Piranha Pale Ale. The beer didn't disappoint. What got to me?? First off, the app came and it looked like a disaster had happened on the plate. Presentation shouldn't be a big deal, I know...but it literally looked like they just slapped the cut up pieces of avocado egg rolls on the plate. First impressions sometimes count. While the app didn't taste bad, it wasn't as crispy or well fried as I'd had at the other BJ's. Personally, I think it was under-fried (the prepared eggroll skins just looked pale and white).  I've ordered this dish many times in LV and never had it look so...well, unappetizing. Next the salad. Sure it's just a salad...but it came all chopped up in little cubes (I mean the letuce!) which was weird. To top it off, it looked old - there were bits of red tinges on the little lettuce cubes. Not good. Finally, the pizza. I usually order this knowing that I'll get something decent. Granted, for this meal, it was by far the best dish we tasted. However, I've had better at the other location. It just came out kind of cold and the cheese wasn't near as gooey as I've had in the past. Okay, granted...this is a chain. But as far as food quality control is concerned, this has got to be one of the worst BJ's I've been to. So 2 stars for the food which is weighted heavily for me. Considering it being a sports bar-type chain, I think service and ambiance were fine - easily, 3 - 3.5 stars. Beers deserve a decent 3- 3.5 star rating as well. About the same quality as or slightly less than Gordon-Biersch if you like that stuff. However, for the price of the some of the menu items (avocado eggrolls at $10, the mini pizza at $10, etc...), this was a HUGELY lackluster meal and was the most expensive meal we had that weekend as well as the worst quality (food) meal we experienced. The final bill was ~$80 (no tip) for 2 sandwiches + fries, our pizza, side salad, avocado eggroll app, and 3 beers. I think, for now, I'll pass on this place when I visit home again - there are so many better Houston restos out there for the price. This experience definitely showed me that all chain locations are not created equal. If you do crave this kind of food, I'd rather spend it on chains like Cheesecake factory which seem to offer up better QC on their food (across the nation). Else, if you ever go to LV, *THAT* BJ's on W. Charleston Blvd is pretty darn good."
Ronnie K.,"Alvin, TX",11,43,16,3.0,10/9/2011,I took my son here this past friday to chill and talk a little we orderd a deep dish pizza bacon and italion suasge and i had a cesar salad. the service was nice and brew thier own beers. the place is laid back and a good place to bring family or friends. ill be back...
Tasha A.,"Long Beach, CA",66,18,3,3.0,4/28/2011,"So, I knew exactly what I wanted before I got there. I've been craving the Meatloaf sandwich for about a year now. (I'm from Cali)  so we found this one and drove -the 17 miles. We arrived to them being out of meatloaf!!!!! ( pissed)) when they saw how upset I was they told me that the manager would come talk to me put he never did. They gave me a good deal but I haven't been back."
Audrey W.,"Chicago, IL",62,161,28,3.0,11/13/2010,"I'm not a huge fan of this place, but my BF loves the Mediterranean pizza and loves that during Happy Hour it is 5 dollars. So we usually go between 4-7 or during football games. It definitely is a good deal, but the food is just okay."
RanGirl A.,"Houston, TX",6,75,13,3.0,12/20/2010,Love the sliders! My nephew like the chil cheeseburger! Have tried other things on the menu and always satisfied. Nice atmosphere for watching sports & having drinks.
