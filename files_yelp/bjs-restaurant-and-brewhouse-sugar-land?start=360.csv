Larry A.,"Houston, TX",8,19,,4.0,1/22/2011,"I've only been to this location once and it was great.  Now, I'm not a fan of things Californian.  I'm one of those people that thinks its pathetic to add avocado to everything and call it California style.  But this place has an awesome meat loaf and mash potatoes.  The waitor did a really good job helping me narrow down my options.  Plus giving me the 411 on their so called  ""Texas chicken fried steak"".  That thing is flaky and is very NOT TEXAS LIKE at all.  The service was excellent and the price is ok but the food was really good and I plan on going back for sure.  If you like Americana check this place out, very good."
James A.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,181,2,2.0,12/14/2010,Te Pazookie is the only thing that makes me enjoy going here.
Susan B.,"Richmond, TX",0,8,3,1.0,8/7/2014,"At the restaurant still, trying to get out after horrible service and horrible food for my my parents that came in from out of state for my mom's birthday. Had to wave someone down to serve us, the greeters look and act miserable and like they hate customers, bacon burger was bland, chicken Parmesan was bland, food was cold, turkey/ham club wasn't prepared as requested (& then had to wait 15 minutes more when everyone else had finished eating), didn't bring the coffee/sweetener/box/or water refills, etc. that were repeatedly requested. When I explained to the manager, Steve, my upset at our horrible experience he produced a litany of excuses - short staff, cooks with car trouble, etc. and no apology or offer of any recompense to make up for their poor performance and myriad mistakes. I told him I didn't care, we chose there due to our wonderful experiences with the chain in FL and our experience tonight for a birthday was horrible and unacceptable. He then, finally, apologized. We then asked why the club sandwich was rang up on our ticket three times. He had not planned to take off even a discount at all until I told him this place was horrible in comparison and we were all disappointed. I certainly hope they get themselves together and actually hold themselves accountable for poor performance (& and not simply try to say ""too bad"" to the customer) - there are far too many other places for anyone to settle for what we experienced."
Ron H.,"Sugar Land, TX",3,20,1,2.0,12/16/2012,"Too expensive for lunch on a weekend.  During the week they have a lunch menu; however, not on the weekend.  The food is average and the service slow.  To management:  If you charge a premium price, then you have to do something above average."
Travis C.,"Richmond, TX",0,1,,4.0,6/17/2013,One of our favorite places in town! We have come here oh soo many times already. The buffalo chicken pizza and the great white pizza... mmmm! Just thought I would show this establishment some love after they have been showing me love for so long!
Kellie Y.,"Houston, TX",231,119,351,3.0,4/9/2012,"This place really deserved a 3.5 for food but I bumped it to 3 because of the slow service. We came around 8:45 Easter night. The place wasn't empty but not packed either. We got seated immediately and order our drink and appetizer. The avocado eggrolls were pretty tasty and had generous heaps of avocado in them but I'm not a huge fan of avocado myself. I ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop from the Enlightened Menu (woohoo less calories but I look like a twig so I never watch what I eat). The pork chop was super delicious! It was moist, tender and the glaze really complimented it. It came with some yummy crunchy green beans and roasted potatoes. The potatoes were extremely dry and didn't have much flavor. Only one of my potatoes had rosemary on it. The portion size was just right for me. I also tried my boyfriend's ribeye steak and it was pretty charred. It was a little disappointing. I was very satisfied with my entree but our waiter was one grumpy man that seemed like he didn't want to be there and our food took extremely long to come out :("
Ali G.,"Missouri City, TX",175,115,88,4.0,7/17/2010,Great white shark pizza is crazy good!!!! Service could u a little help... They don't split checks.. Overall very happy!
Katie P.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,8,,5.0,4/1/2013,"Clean, Fast service and open till 2 am. Great place to eat and hangout. I always bring my out of town friends here."
Marilyn L.,"Missouri City, TX",153,95,2,4.0,8/8/2009,"great lunch specials for a good deal!  i had a yummy personal deep dish pizza with juicy chunks of italian sausage + a tasty wedge salad for under $7 (btw the pizza crust was nice, soft, bready, with the perfect outside crispiness).  and the sister had a delicious chicken sandwich with lots of avocado on buttery garlic bread (a little on the small side, though) + tons of fat wedge fries + a house salad also for under $7..  and even though they didn't have iced coffee, they were nice about bringing out (unlimited) regular coffee with a cup of ice - and it was that yummy hotel coffee that i always love during wedding banquets :)  mm..  $2 for 2 huge, delicious cups of iced coffee = awesome :) our waitress started off a little unfriendly and sparse but she eventually warmed up and was nice and accommodating with all of  our requests :)  and i liked the ambiance of the restaurant.  even though it was big and spacious, the decorations somehow made it seem really cozy and home-y..   yay :)"
Henry B.,"Lynnwood, WA",2,52,3,3.0,7/25/2009,I came into Missouri City to visit a friend and we had no idea where to eat so she took me here. I can honestly say the food was good for the most part and the pizookie was great! We started with a artichoke dip which I must say was not great at all. Not worth the high price. The chips were stale and tasted worse than any chips I could find at Randalls or Kroger. The BBQ chicken pizza was delicious but $20.00 for a medium seemed like a bit too much. The pizookie was the saving grace for this place. Totally worth it to eat here just for that. Service was ok not great but not bad either. All in all I would not come back first cause I don't live here and second cause of the price. But I do recommend making the trip to a BJ's at least once in your life if not for nothing else but a pizookie.
T L.,"Houston, TX",2,41,,1.0,9/17/2012,"The portion size is pathetic for the price, the service stinks and parking is impossible. The only bright spot is the beer selection. There are many other places better than this for the money. Avoid Bj's."
Alex R.,"Bellevue, WA",161,220,36,4.0,2/19/2009,"Ok what to do when eating at BJ's.  Order a deep dish and for dessert, get the delightful and always amazing Pizookie.  Wow those two things are so good and they are the only two things I get when I go.  So my 4 stars are based on the good service, neat place and those two great items on the menu.  Great place for groups and a great place for that awesome dessert.  Please go there and try it, it will make you happy, like it makes me happy."
Phuong N.,"Houston, TX",113,65,,4.0,1/25/2009,"Given my wk schedule, I can't stop by BJ's for lunch on a regular basis.  They do have great lunch specials, and the serving size is generous.  The Jeremiah Red Ale is my favorite beer, and they have delicious pizzas.     If you're in the Stafford/Sugar Land area, stop by and give it a try!"
David N.,"Houston, TX",4193,3753,2208,3.0,2/16/2009,This place was pretty good.  They offer a wide variety of foods.  I tried a couple of things but nothing special.  Their deep dish pizza was probably the best item I ate besides the dessert.  The cookie with ice cream is to die for! I tried once of their micro brews and once again I was really disappointed by another microbrew.  I would only come back for the dessert.
Jay B.,"Pearland, TX",0,17,7,4.0,6/23/2008,"Came here for my moms birthday with a total party of 6. Our waiter was nice and friendly, but it was Saturday, it got a little crowded. So service was a little slow. The food was good. I had fish tacos. Fresh halibut wrapped in a flour tortilla, and smothered in chipolte-mayo. The cookie and ice cream desert is to die for. It is a freshly baked cookie of your choice topped with vanilla ice cream. I recommend chocolate chip. BJ's is opening up a restaurant in Pearland. Yay!"
David P.,"TX, TX",1,2,,5.0,1/19/2007,"Just found this place! This place has excellent food (deep dish pizza is one of their specialty) and has its own beer like a brewery . (very good tasting beer)  They don't make it there. But get places like St. Arnold or Shiner  to make their beer. (because Texas make it very hard and expensive to make it on site). Anyway, They have a nice bar with a big TV behind it and TVs all around the place. Pretty much anywhere you sit you can see a TV. If you a beer and food Connoisseur THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!!!  I think there are more locations by clear lake and willow brook."
Marissa B.,"Katy, TX",2,14,,1.0,12/27/2011,"We walked into BJ's Brewhouse in Sugar land around 6 pm and we happily greeted by the young man who showed us to our table after a short wait. That was where the pleasant dining experience ended. As a party of six, we expected that service would be slow, but what we experienced was ridiculous. After ordering our drinks, it took a long time for the server to bring out our two non-alcoholic drinks, and an even longer time for the alcoholic ones. He then took our order for our appetizer of mozzarella sticks, but left without asking whether we were ready to place our food order as well. He returned again, terse as before, barely muttering a word. While initially we assumed he was simply not talkative, we later noticed him animatedly chatting and explaining the menu to the table neighboring us. We grew increasingly impatient as our mozzarella still had not made an appearance and our waiter was no where in sight. One of our party members accidently knocked over a drink during animated conversation, and despite apologizing profusely and us helping clean up with our available napkins, it elicited no response from our waiter. He finally asked her what she was drinking, and said he would bring another. Furthermore, during this hour-long wait, I had nearly finished my root beer with no refill being offered either. Finally, they showed up with our main courses, sans napkins and silverware, but our appetizers had been apparently forgotten. Our waiter made a brief appearance during this time, and at least gave us silverware, but only stayed around long to here us request that our appetizer be taken off our bill since it never arrived before dashing off again before I could request a refill. He then showed up with that previously ordered replacement drink, which we then later saw on the tab that he had charged for it. We then finished our meal, and decided to at least get dessert and also take advantage of the free dessert we had been promised for our birthday girl. We ordered two pizookies, one being free, thinking that would be sufficient. However, our server failed to mention that the free dessert is apparently a personal size. Needless to say we did not leave a generous tip. I thought the deceptively fun atmosphere promoted on their website would be a perfect 21 birthday experience. Clearly I was wrong and will not be visiting there again. Terrible experience and I have never been so ignored at a restaurant."
Ramona N.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,5,,4.0,7/1/2009,Great Beer (Blonde) and like the Pizza (Mediterranean)...Hubby and I like to go there usually without the kids and watch our favorite game (Baseball/Football) on the many tv screens!  You can sit at the bar tables or in the dining areas...there is a tv screen everywhere you look so you will not miss any action.
Jay L.,"Naperville, IL",2,59,,4.0,1/26/2011,Ate here for lunch on 1-12-11 while on a business trip.  Had their pizza and it was excellent.  It is a sports bar with lots of TV screens for viewing. My colleague had salmon and said it was delicious.  Hope to return again on my next business trip here.
