Tracy H.,"Houston, TX",58,10,9,5.0,2/28/2017,"I love this place! Food, drinks, and desserts Great! The most wonderful monkey bread I have had next to mines lol. Great for lunch. I celebrated my birthday lunch here the past two years with my coworkers!"
Jen L.,"New York, NY",111,442,420,4.0,1/1/2017,"Pretty solid place with good service. Came for dinner during the weekday and it was pretty packed but only had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table since it was the holidays.  I ordered the bacon burger medium rare which came out pretty well. The party had a nice char to it and was juicy and flavorful. It was nice that they also had a buttery bun to compliment it. The thin ft fries were also great as well!  They also have such food weekly deals. It was Thursday so they had the 13.95 half rack of baby back ribs along with two sides deal, which was plenty of food!  Our waiter was also super super prompt about refilling our drinks and before we were even halfway through our soda, he came by to refill it."
Barbie H.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,1,1.0,8/22/2017,"Visiting from out of town and there were so many restaurants to choose from in Sugarland.  I reviewed the menu before choosing BJ's.  The restaurant was clean, well lit with a fun atmosphere.  We were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly.  The major problem with this restaurant was the most important thing - THE FOOD.  I had the bison burger and my guest had the chicken sandwich.  Our server recommend the chicken sandwich tossed in buffalo sauce so my guest took that option.  When the food came to the table our server asked him if the sandwich hand been tossed in buffalo sauce and she lifted up the bun herself!  So after putting her hands on his food and showing that it had been tossed in buffalo sauce, she said ""I don't think that's buffalo sauce"" even though it obviously was, and she took the sandwich away, returning moments later saying it was buffalo sauce.  Weird.  My burger was burned.  I was so hungry by that point I just ate the I burned parts.  The fries were also burned and drowned in a sea of salt, I guess to mask the burn taste.  Our server didn't even ask how our food was, which most servers do.  The food was horrible and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I will never ever go back.  It makes the list for one of the worst places I've ever eaten."
Tyler C.,"Houston, TX",0,2,1,5.0,8/5/2017,"A ground of friends and I frequent BJs quite often after theater performances (Sorry for the extra-ness we often provide). We generally have a positive experience, but last night was better than ever! Brandon V was out waiter and he was perfectly accommodating. He was very professional and gave off a very kind hearted energy. Ask for Brandon V when you dine here."
Misbah V.,"Spring, TX",0,5,,5.0,11/1/2017,"This is a great place to eat out especially on a game day. The staff is very friendly and service is quick. They also have a great bar. Their pizza is great and very fresh. The best part is the dessert which is the main reason for me going there. If you go there, getting a pazooki is a must!"
Matthew S.,"Bedford, TX",96,199,50,4.0,5/29/2016,"This was one of my favorite places a few years ago when I was living up north, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it here in this area when I moved into town. Now as I sit here, I have to acknowledge that I did enjoy my meal each time I came here. The server I had, when I came with my family, was knowledgable and helpful in aiding both my cousin and myself in deciding what to have. She was friendly, and appeared eager to wait on us. I've already become friendly with some of the servers since I've become more of a regular here. The only reason I don't rate it a five star is because of one of the bartenders letting their stress of being busy show everywhere. However, that same bartender was still friendly and helpful. I've never had an issue with the food or its taste, and I do enjoy the service, so I recommend giving this place a try. I honestly believe you will have a good time here."
Nicole G.,"Houston, TX",113,296,153,4.0,10/14/2015,"After being put off by what I thought was mediocrity from another BJ's chain, I decided to give BJ's another try. There are a few things I really enjoy about this restaurant: 1) the deep dish pizza, 2) the Pizookies (OMG salted caramel), and 3) the fairly interesting selection of house beers. All three of those things happen to be their signature items. As an added bonus, 4) the menu is about 500 pages long, so it's group friendly as far as selection goes. They offer a selection of perhaps 10 different beer types, so you can generally find something that pairs well with your meal. Get a flight to sample your favs. My husband loves to start with the avocado egg rolls, which are basically avocado bites fried in egg roll wrapping and served up with a dipping sauce. (Personally, I prefer the potato skins.) The deep dish pizzas are unlike others I've tried - they're less pie-like and more pillowy, which I adore. My favorite is the Pepperoni Extreme, which has sliced, diced, & julienned pepperonis. A small (6 slice) can definitely feed two people; order a medium (8 slice) and you'll be taking home leftovers. And fiiiiinally...the Pizookies. Usually I don't order dessert, much less a cookie, but this....this is different. The warm, gooey, caramelized-on-the-outside Pizookie is to die for. The salted caramel flavor is my absolute favorite, but the triple chocolate and white chocolate Macadamia come in close behind. You can get a free mini on your birthday, too! I've had other items, like the burger and the deep dish ravioli (which is more like a lasagna baked in a pie-like pan), and they're solid. But they'll not why I keep returning. Besides that, I've gotten great service and I've had unbelievably slow service, and I've always been seated quickly. The next time I would like to spend all my calories in one sitting, I will definitely be back."
Earl A.,"Katy, TX",336,357,689,3.0,5/15/2015,"This wasn't my regular BJ's but I was on this side of town so I decided to drop in.  I was seated immediately and the waitress took my drink order and I ordered a salad and appetizer. My salad came out and I finished it before my appetizer? They were both prepared well and were delicious.  Now this is where the problem came in. I am a BJ's Reward customer and introduced a coupon for free Pizookie and I showed it to my waitress and she took my info and said every thing was fine. When I checked out she added my total to my reward points, which she did but in the process of giving me my free dessert they deducted 100 points from my reward account without acknowledging be of it. The coupon state that the dessert was free if I had a purchase of $9.95 or greater. My bill was over $20?   I had to call customer service to get my points reinstated. I don't know if it was an honest mistake but I did say it was after coupon.  In the future I will definitely have to watch my transactions and ask more questions."
Alessandra S.,"Houston, TX",16,10,,3.0,7/8/2017,"We were seated within 10-15 minutes on a busy Friday night. Since it was my first time at BJ's I decided to go with something on their pizza list and ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Pizza. After waiting for about 30 minutes, we were told the kitchen was backed up, but fortunately we were not ""hangry"" or in a rush. When my pizza finally arrived I noticed that the cheese was just barely melted on the top as I could still see shreds of it in certain spots. The crust also could have used a longer bake time since it looked pretty white and doughy. I guess they were rushing it, at least it still tasted good. Overall, the food was good and we had a great server.  Highly recommend their chips and salsa as an appetizer."
Laura O.,"Houston, TX",7,47,82,2.0,4/30/2017,"We had a 9pm reservation and we were seated at 1045pm.  The food was unremarkable.  I ordered a salad with salmon.  The salmon was well prepared but lacked flavoring.  Some of the ingredients listed on the description of the salad were missing.  The servers were kind.  These desert was the highlight of my evening.  The two stars were for the servers and the monkey bread desert.  Do I see myself returning to have dinner here, nope!"
Rahamat S.,"Houston, TX",52,3,1,5.0,7/15/2017,"This was my first time eating at BJ's and I really enjoyed it. There was a lot of variety. A friend recommended the BJ's Brewhouse Burger, so I ordered without cheese. It was definitely worth it! The price was reasonable, too, only $7.95 (plus tax) I've always heard about the infamous pizookies and had to get one. I ordered the mini Cookies 'N' Cream Pizookie and it was so good! For only 3.95 plus tax, that was a deal. Overall I spent about $15 and I would do it again. Love this place!"
Daniel F.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,15,1,1.0,6/17/2017,This place is a disgrace. I'm disgusted. It sucks butt. Don't come here. Highly advise against it.. people are so rude. From the management all the way down to the waiter. Turn around and go somewhere else man. Good luck.
Donna A.,"Manvel, TX",43,93,262,3.0,11/2/2016,"I like BJ's because it has a plethora of menu items that works out for everyone. For this lunch visit, I ordered the Chicken and Spinach Quinoa (those rare moments I actually order something ""healthy"") and wow it was amazing. And I don't even like quinoa! The texture and appearance just looks like little flour bugs, but because I wanted to be healthy, I shrugged it off and went ahead and ordered it. Whatever they cooked the quinoa in, chicken broth or whatever, made me forget about my thoughts of eating tiny little bugs! It was so flavorful! I loved the flavor of the chicken and the mushroom, tomatoes and spinach as well. I think they should add more of the veggies though especially if it's considered an ""enLIGHTened"" favorite, but perhaps it's because I ordered the lunch portion. Seating was quick, even exactly at 12pm. Waitress was nice, checked up on us a few times - average service. I originally placed an order for the new Soba Noodle Bowl with Shrimp and the waitress mentioned it was a cold dish. I appreciated she told me that before it was actually placed in front of me. Anyway, I'll be back again."
Aisha M.,"Richmond, TX",105,124,129,2.0,11/1/2016,My first experience at BJs was not a good one. It wasn't very busy but it took forever for us to get our food. When I received my food the shrimp was drowning in a very strong vinegar/lemon sauce. The manager was very apologetic and did not charge me for the salad I ordered to replace the shrimp.
Lourdes P.,"Houston, TX",45,5,1,3.0,2/5/2017,Their customer service isn't the greatest!  The deep dish pizza is fabulous and not to mention the pizokies cookies Delish!
Bisi O.,"Houston, TX",62,8,3,4.0,6/15/2017,"Awesome place.  I have had multiple dinners here and it truly is one of the best places to have a dinner party or a small celebration.  The waiters take their time sometimes they do make mistakes with drink orders but they have no issue in fixing that up for you.  The food is always freshly cooked so it is always delicious and filling.  I went in also to redeem my mini pizooki which might I add is TO DIE FOR (so mouth watering good) , but instead got a meal.  Their food is fairly priced for what they actually provide and the service is really kind and intuitive and mature."
John I.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,3.0,7/18/2017,"Happy hour on a Tuesday night, and only 1 bartender, serving the entire restaurant. Not acceptable for the Sugar Land area."
Ria D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,1,,5.0,8/20/2017,"I love the pizookies here. Especially the chocolate chunk one. I recommend that to anyone new to BJs.  If u get the server Brandon V, your all set."
Meow M.,"Fulshear, TX",0,1,,2.0,6/23/2017,"So slow to get the food. One cup of hot tea took them 15 mins. Baby back ribs, taste like rubber, need more baking hours for the ribs. Disappointed."
Karishma D.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,18,3,3.0,3/29/2017,"This has always been one of my favorite restaurants but recently it's been going downhill. First off, I went there last night, a Tuesday night, for dessert with my family to celebrate my birthday and when we called we were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait. We were literally 5 minutes away so we put our name down and decided to go wait there. When we arrived we were told it would be 20-30 minutes. We decided to leave and go somewhere else because it would be too long. As soon as we pulled out of the parking lot, we got a text message saying our table was ready. From calling the restaurant to arriving and then deciding to leave, it was a total of 15 minutes max. Basically, the ""wait time"" was very off and they lost customers. Also, the last time we went, my cousin found a hair in her pizookie. It was actually baked into the cookie!! Pretty disappointed in their service lately."
