Sarah M.,"Houston, TX",293,148,258,4.0,2/23/2016,"Went for lunch. We had  tomato soup with half a California  club. My son had grilled chicken with fruit.  My club had fresh avocado which I love. It was missing the  bacon,but once I showed the waitress she quickly  went and got some.  My son's grilled chicken was a whole breast! The fruit was fresh and plentiful. We are full and satisfied.  The staff was friendly."
Arcadian B.,"Alhambra, CA",96,632,1227,3.0,2/22/2016,"Nice restaurant with a lot of variety in alcoholic beverages like beer, got the bacon guacamole burger which was good, fries were cold tho, good service"
Kat W.,"Sugar Land, TX",490,18,21,5.0,11/2/2016,Ordered some food online and I got there 5 minutes before and it was already ready. Super satisfied with my to go order.  Also you have to get the clam chowder no matter what!
Michael H.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,31,2,5.0,3/23/2017,"Great food, great service, impossibly great beer. No complaints at all. They keep the place very clean and has a very comfortable atmosphere. Rule 1. Always get a beer. Rule 2. Always get a dessert!"
Anthony M.,"Houston, TX",384,193,1048,5.0,7/9/2016,"Yes'n deed y'all it's Friday!!!  What's there not to love about that!  My family and I haven't been here in a long time, but I don't know why not!!!!   This is a great place to dine with.......anybody!!!  Now the Long Island wasn't worth squat but the ""Hickory Bacon Brisket Burger"" cooked medium is DA TRUTH!!!!!!!  WHAT.....that burger is yes yes y'all!!!  Ohhhh it is so good. Did you read that?  ""Hickory Bacon Brisket""....all that sounds so good and we all know bacon makes everything better. This burger is a work of art and tastes so good and one of the most overlooked ingredients is also perfect. The bread is so soft yet firm enough to handle the tender moist meat patty and all that luscious stuff that comes with it. Sweet and tangy BJ's Peppered BBQ sauce, smoked brisket, Applewood smoked bacon, jack and cheddar cheese, red onions, and mayonnaise.  Yes..... I'm in love with this burger! I'm going to have to go back just to make sure my love is true......consistent is what I mean. My son had the ""Bacon Cheeseburger"".......With Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, mayonnaise and BJ's signature burger sauce.  He had the same google eyed look I had with every bite of his burger. We'd take a bite and while chewing we'd stare at the burger in our hand in disbelief that we were actually eating this scrumptious morsel!  Dude I'm tryna told ya sum'n but ya ain't tryna heard me!!!!  Sorry..... I resort to my New Orleans roots when overly excited. Oh..... And my wife said her Asian chopped salad was really good as well! We will definitely be back!!!!"
Nicole H.,"Dallas, TX",325,534,237,4.0,1/30/2016,"I like BJ;s Brewhouse.  My experience with them in California and Texas is that they are consistently good, with a good variety of options, and Hubby loves the brews.  This one was no exception.  We decided to come here when having dinner with another couple since we knew everyone could find something they like, and we all did.  I had the salmon and it was cooked well, and I easily substituted mashed potatoes for the side.  The waitress was efficient and friendly, but not pushy.  The boys had some beers and the girls some wine, and all was good.  We ended up sitting at the end of our meal and talking for a LONG time.  After checking on us a couple times, the waitress just left us alone and let us chat, which I appreciated.   It was yet another good experience, which I have come to expect at this chain."
Mishal H.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,,5.0,9/14/2017,As I walked into bjs this beautiful waitress named Annalisa sat us down and and took our orders. As she took our orders her eyes were glued onto the screen as she watched the football game. She then brought out the best food ever and gave us the best service anyone could ask for. Bjs has always been my all time favorite and the waiters and waitresses are amazing. By far the best food and service ever! Come to bjs if you want an amazing experience!!
Ahsan H.,"Sugar Land, TX",1,1,,5.0,9/14/2017,"By far best service in Sugar Land. The servers come to you right away and you get your food extremely fast. Our server Annalisa C. was super polite and nice. I couldn't have asked for a better server. If you haven't been here, I would definitely recommend this place."
Ebonie M.,"Galleria/Uptown, Houston, TX",223,203,1407,5.0,7/9/2016,"Tonight was extra special as my youngest was meeting his ""Friend Girl"" at the movies. I was feeling a little emotional as I realize my son will be a freshman in high school this year. We picked up his friend and stopped for dinner at BJ's. It was pretty crowded. However, the wait wasn't long and we were seated in approximately 10 minutes or less. The atmosphere was very casual and family friendly. I ordered the Asian Chopped Salad. The salad had grilled chicken breast, baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine, red bell peppers, snow peas, green onions, shredded carrots, sesame seeds, crisp wonton strips, cilantro and mandarin oranges tossed in honey ginger dressing. The salad was excellent and was only 590 calories.  Everyone else ordered hamburgers. The talk of the table was the hickory brisket and bacon burger. They all raved about how good it was. This burger had  BJ's  sweet and tangy peppered BBQ sauce, smoked brisket, applewood smoked bacon, jack and cheddar cheese, red onions, and mayonnaise. Thanks to our waiter Lenard for taking good care of us. Needless to say, after dinner we dropped the kids off at the movie theater. On to the next phase of parenthood."
Tommy N.,"New York, NY",154,98,237,2.0,1/6/2016,"I came in later after a few friends had grabbed the table for us. However, the waiter did not acknowledge my presence or even bother to ask for my drink order or offer a set of silverware. We ordered the pizookie platter (it came to be about $22 total) to share between the five of us, and we still could not finish it - although it was a delicious dessert to a previously-filling meal.  I was excited to try out this location after a few disappointing experiences at the Katy location. I certainly won't be going out of my way to come back to BJ's, especially for the service. Come not for the service but, if you must, instead for the food."
Alonso R.,"Houston, TX",11,56,19,4.0,3/25/2017,"If you're looking for a place that's open late, then look no further, BJ'S is the place to go. Don't let your dirty mind and title of the restaurant keep you away, it's pretty bomb! Although it has a wide variety of alcoholic drinks and beers, it's a family place. I'm a bit of a weirdo, so my favorite thing to order is their soup in a bread bowl. It's around nine bucks, fills you up and way better than those crappy bread bowls at Panera. Aside from that they have amazing appetizers such as Avocado egg rolls. Like I said, if it's late and your tired of crappy IHOP and Dennys, come on and bring all your sexual innuendo jokes to BJ'S! :)"
Kim W.,"Houston, TX",34,3,2,5.0,11/2/2016,"I Love BJ'S. Thanks always for being the same . Great food and beers, and bring friends to make it better"
Darlene L.,"Carrollton, TX",42,286,112,5.0,3/28/2017,"Excellent meal!  Had the Black and Blue House burger that tastes divine!   Best burger I have had in a while. Glad we can here for it. The French fries are the best!  Nice and crispy. Nothing limp about them. Will definitely put this down as a burger joint, too!! Service was excellent too. Great experience all around."
Sour Prunes P.,"Houston, TX",2,61,42,5.0,3/23/2017,This is my second time here dining in and it was a great experience! The queso dip was oh so yummie and the gf pizookie was fresh and melt in your mouth goodness! Chace was our waiter and he was so attentive and delivered awesome customer service!!!! Will be back fo sure!
Heather B.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,69,1,4.0,7/11/2016,"Ok, after writing the last review the manager responded to me and we decided to give BJ's a second try. I'm sure glad we did! Great experience and we will definitely be back. Our waitress (Rebecca, I think was her name) was extremely nice and helpful! There was about a 15 minute wait to get a table (we went on a Friday night), but once we sat down the drinks and food didn't take long to come out.  Overall, we had a great time! Beers were great! Burgers were juicy and delicious! Thank you to BJ's manager for personally inviting us back! The customer service I thought was lacking the first time was more than made up for this time around :)"
Maria B.,"Westside, Houston, TX",0,2,,5.0,9/9/2017,"Brandon V. Is probably the best server ever!  He's attentive, friendly and fast!  He can't say no!!!!  The food was good too!"
Ray H.,"Pearland, TX",0,20,6,1.0,1/22/2017,"Usually have a good experience here, but dang!  Burger was raw/mushy & almost $2 for a slice of cheddar cheese.  If Whataburger starts selling beer, y'all are done!"
Hien N.,"Sugar Land, TX",86,31,83,2.0,8/25/2016,"This place seems like it's gone downhill over the past years. Service-wise and food-wise. Recently ordered the honey brussel sprouts or something and they came out overly cooked, so burnt that it had that bitter burnt taste. Who thought it was ok to serve that?! We took it back and ordered something else. The only things that seem to be good here are the pizookies. And maybe the pizza at times."
Victoria E.,"Dallas, TX",103,185,292,1.0,6/20/2016,"I came in town from Dallas for the weekend some friends and I choose this location to watch game 7 of the NBA finals. We figured this would be a great place to grab some drinks at the bar and utilize one of their many screens within the restaurant. I started off by ordering a drink, one thing I did not like off the bat is that they do not list the prices for cocktails on the menu, which I'm definitely not a fan of. I prefer to know how much my item is going to cost and not be blind sided when my check comes. I ordered the Tickled Pink because of how tasty it looked on the menu. When I received my drink it looked nothing like the picture! There was no garnish and the fruit that was supposed to be in the drink was left out. When I tasted the drink it was disgusting as well so I sent it back and ordered the Strawberry Splash. The description described it to be a frozen Pina colada like drink with strawberry purée. Again disappointment, while the appearance this time was much better the texture was a let down. There were chunks of huge pieces of ice throughout my drink as if it was not mixed well in the machine to have that smooth frozen drink consistency. Plus I could not taste any alcohol, definite waste of $9. Definitely not worth the money I payed. Onto the food, I ordered the BJ's brewhouse burger with thin cut fries. It was honestly nothing to write home about, I have made better burgers at home. I did not like how greasy my burger patty was it tasted like grease when I bit into it.  I have eaten at several BJ's locations and this by far was the worst experience I have encountered."
Christine C.,"Sugar Land, TX",23,4,,4.0,3/17/2017,"Nice place, great food, and service was outstanding even if there were lots of people. Will definitely come back."
