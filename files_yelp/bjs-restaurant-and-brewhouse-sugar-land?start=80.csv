Rebecca F.,"Richmond, TX",22,15,3,3.0,4/29/2017,"Great beer and drinks. The Avacado Rolls are excellent. However, our waiter was bogged in the bar area, drink service was slow, he could've cared less about our dried out ribs and rare prime rib. I would suggest you order those 2 items early in the day because by dinner, neither was impressive."
M Q.,"River Run, River Run, TX",10,29,13,4.0,4/20/2017,"Food was good, ordered guacamole and chips, grilled cheese and tortilla soup. All good. Service was mediocre, which is usually the case.  The soup could have had some chicken in it but I didn't have any."
Dhesseny B.,"Richmond, TX",4,8,12,4.0,2/21/2017,"This place is pretty great. Although the food had came in pretty slow, the staff was very courteous and nice. We didn't mind because it was Valentine's Day so it was understandable. The food was great! There were plenty of choices, and the dessert was bomb. It was so good. I had a big food baby afterwards. Their bathrooms need a bit of maintenance and cleaning though. However the place was really nice and the service was great."
Allyson S.,"Houston, TX",8,69,53,4.0,7/14/2017,"Yummy! Good food and good environment. Lots of nice TVs to watch sports. My main complaint is their sangria. They added cinnamon whiskey? Wtf to sangria lol ugh no. Also no baked potato option for the steak. I usually get the appetizer flat bread as my meal and it is plenty of food. My husband was annoyed with the steak, and he hasnt found anything he really likes on the menu. I really liked their kiddo appetizer. Our waitress on our most recent visit offered it to us. One for each kid. It was free and the kids liked it! She said just ask your server in the future for it."
Katherine S.,"Houston, TX",267,125,218,2.0,8/22/2015,order take out-Lett wrap chk for $12...no chicken??? So sad. Only 5 lettuce leaflets. good thing i hv reserve stash of ramen noodle.  At least the manager is very apologetic and willing to reimburst my money...not my day today. So sad.
Jasmin I.,"Richmond, TX",126,9,1,2.0,2/15/2017,"2 stars because their service is HORRIBLE. I always order food to go and it's the same horrible service every time. One time I went up to the register to pick up food and this guy laughs and says, ""oh I'm off the clock"" ??? You don't do that, ever. I basically waited for someone to acknowledge that I just needed to pick up my to go order. Also, I have to check the bag because they've forgotten items to my order. So I suggest dining in only because ordering to go is always a bad experience."
Galen R.,"Westside, Houston, TX",44,3,1,5.0,6/3/2017,"Never eaten here but stop to poop here once a week. Very nice place, great restrooms, quilted quality tp. Five stars"
Htownfan C.,"Houston, TX",131,50,28,2.0,12/29/2016,"I came back again to give them another shot since I love the chicken tortilla soup! Same experience as last time. Come on BJ'S, get it together! You'd think a person eating alone might get more attention since they are ""alone"" and generally eat faster than a table of 4.....sigh......"
Myra M.,"Houston, TX",69,36,23,2.0,4/10/2016,I usually enjoy Bjs. Pizza and apps are good. Today unfortunately my husband ordered the top sirloin and they brought him a poor serving of well... Everything. It looked like a kids serving. Small portion of mash potatoes.. Potatoes!!! I felt bad for him :( I asked the server if there was a bigger portion but instead she stared at me and left with no response. Extremely disappointed. Bad service and not so good servings for the price.
Tish P.,"Houston, TX",907,408,1021,3.0,6/29/2014,"From the jump, I'm going to tell ya my 3 star rating is not based upon the food! They'd fail and they'd fail horribly for what I had that night. Heard good things about BJ's pizza so the bestie and I decided it was time to try it out.  Waiter was very friendly, made suggestions...we chose the meat pizza.  It came out slightly gummy with hardly any sauce to be found.  I really couldn't believe this was a true depiction of what people rave about.  Honesty is the best policy so when asked how we liked it, I was truthful.  I said everything but this sh-- sucked bro.  The waiter immediately removed the remaining pizza and brought over the manager who explained it depended on who made the pizza how it was going to turn out even though they have strict instructions on the prep.  Which he recognized is no excuse and comped the pizza and offered us another.  We declined which led to an offer for free dessert.  We don't turn down free dessert boo boo! And it was actually pretty good! I'd return based solely upon the customer service.  I won't order the pizza but I'll be back!"
Annie P.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,7,7,1.0,3/15/2017,I am still sitting here have been here for an hour and half since I placed my order Finally got the drinks that they just set on the table across from us. The pizza came without any toppings that I ordered.  I will never come back here again please don't ever go to this BJs in Sugarland or the one in Katy because the Katy one never has anything that you order from the Menu
Marie J.,"Missouri City, TX",0,4,1,5.0,8/6/2017,"My family and I went to BJ's for a birthday celebration. The food was great and served in a timely manner. They gave us complimentary pazookies for our birthdays, and, of course, those were absolutely delicious! Our server Brandon V. was very high energy and attentive. Great vibes! I highly recommend the restaurant."
Marcel E.,"Elkton, MD",0,2,,1.0,2/28/2017,I was seated for 15 minutes and not one server acknowledged me. No drink order. At least 4 servers walked past me and said nothing to me.  Than 3 servers sat 4 tables away from me I guess on a break and no one acknowledged me.  As I was leaving a person at was near the host station and he didn't say goodbye or acknowledge me either.
Michaela J.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,5/10/2016,"The dinning experience was horrible!!! When we first walked in, the hostess looks up a us and continues to text, then says ""How many......?"" Okay, that was nothing. We sit there for about 15 mins before anyone ever comes to us! By this time we are ready to order. This waiter is pacing up and down the aisle in frustration chanting, ""I hate the host, I hate the host.""  This same waiter comes to us and in my head I'm thinking, oh boy! My cousin orders the deep dish pizza and I'm contemplating what I want, and so I ask him ""which is better?"" he says, ""that's up to you"" --ok guy, you're in a bad mood, whatever! i end up ordering the spaghetti and meatballs. In the meantime -she ordered a margarita and myself a glass of wine. This took FOREVER! and came after our food, which took forever also! The cheese on her deep dish was not melted and my spaghetti was SALTY SALTY! The bill came and we were both looking puzzled... definitely not worth anything over 30$ total!  I will never return here again! I now remember why I have not been since 2007!"
Angelynn Á.,"Hartford, CT",216,89,305,4.0,5/18/2016,"I am happy with my few experiences at BJ's so far. The ambience of the restaurant is great since it gives off a casual and comfortable, yet classy feel. There is a huge variety in the menu---ranging from various flat breads pizza, deep-dish pizzas, burgers, tacos, seafood, and salads. Last time I was at BJ's, I ordered their bison burger, fries and cheese sauce, and a chocolate chip Pizookie for dessert. Their bison burger was good (though I must say i've had better bison burgers at actual burger restaurants, but that is to be expected). Their fries and cheese sauce was also a nice side to share. The cheese on the fries also had some spice added to it, which was a plus. My favorite part of my visits to BJ's is the dessert! I absolutely enjoy their Pizookie--which is a ""hot, out of the oven, rich and delicious, gluten-free cookie topped with  vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish."" It sounds simple, but it's truly an amazing way to end the meal. I like how there are several cookies you can choose from. So far I've tried the chocolate chip cookie, and the cookies 'n' cream cookie and they were both great! The Pizookies vary in size---meaning you can get a small-sized Pizookie (good for 1 person) with 1 ice cream scoop, or you can get the larger-sized Pizookie (good for 2+) where the cookie is larger in radius and comes with 2 scoops of ice cream. If a group/party wants to go out to eat but some members of the group crave different types of food, I would suggest BJ's to them since the menu covers a wide-variety of food. I would also recommend BJ's since their Pizookies are delicious!"
Melissa G.,"Katy, TX",104,646,82,4.0,7/25/2015,"Yelp says I keep coming back and wants to know why.   Coming to BJ's is typically a group decision when I'm in Sugar Land.  So that is positive #1 - good for groups.  This last visit was a group of 10 and we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  They also didn't charge the typical group standard tip.  I don't know if that was a mistake or not. While it is good for groups in size, I would have to say our server was a bit slow. We were here rather late so maybe they let some of their staff go for the night by the time we got there. Why else would I choose BJ's?  They have a large menu with a nice variety of foods. So one person can get a burger, another person can get a salad and someone else could get pizzas.  They have alcoholic beverages and make their own cream soda and root beers. Location, location, location!  This spot has a couple of pluses location-wise.  There is a portal in reach and it is right by 59 and 6.  Our group usually consists of people from various parts of the greater Houston area and everyone can easily reach a freeway to get home from this location.   We got here at around 10 p.m. and the parking lot was still pretty packed.  There was still a short wait at this time, most likely because we were a large group.   This is the only BJ's I have visited.  Will I visit the one closer to home based on this location?  Sorry, but most likely not.  This is definitely a place for groups, families, or people who can't decide on a ""cuisine""."
Chuck S.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,5,4,4.0,1/19/2017,"Everything here is AMAZING! Friendly servers and bartenders. Delicious pizza. Great beer selection. Affordable prices. Not one single complaint. I used to eat here on a weekly basis when i worked next door at Lupe Tortilla.  Good for dinner, drinks, & desserts!"
Melissa Y.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,14,2,5.0,12/24/2016,"Great service, great atmosphere and I ordered the Parmesan chicken which was absolutely delicious!"
Don C.,"Jersey Village, TX",124,547,278,4.0,7/14/2015,I really like BJs-  I love the Hefeweizen and all the cool apps- pizza is good if you are in the mood and the lighter fare.....the greek chicken pita is really good
Mark K.,"Houston, TX",26,124,13,4.0,7/9/2015,Always good food.  I love the new tavern cut pizzas. For dessert I can never pass up the baked beignet. The tables are always clean as is the restaurant in general. Wait staff is attentive and professional. We had a problem with one order which was a kitchen mistake. The waitress was extremely apologetic and the manager comped the item. Could not ask for more.
