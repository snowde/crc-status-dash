Rosa H.,"Round Rock, TX",63,50,184,5.0,9/27/2017,We love it here! Ck out happy hour! Mon-Fri 3-7pm!!! Root Beer ribs only $6! Wines is $5!
Chris M.,"Austin, TX",1,64,4,1.0,9/23/2017,Tried bjs carry out again after a while of swearing it off.  Ordered two of the southern fried chicken lunch specials.  When I got it home I wondered what happened to the chicken part of it.  I removed the tiny chicken piece from each container to weigh them.  One was 2.3 oz and the other was 2.8 oz.  Now I wasn't expecting a pound of chicken but 2 oz is embarrassing and quite frankly a rip off.  I have pictures of the digital scale with each piece of chicken on it to show I am not making up numbers.  Come on bjs chicken is a cheap ingredient and you gave me 25 cents worth. On the plus side the mobile checkout and curbside delivery was excellent and my order was correct.  I should say that bjs did seem to address that issue and I was satisfied with the service as opposed to in the past.
Stephanie A.,"Austin, TX",44,161,1262,4.0,8/23/2017,"Came here for a quick bite to eat with my daughter as we had one of their lovely coupons.  The place was a bit empty but that was because we came during non peak hours.  We were seated in a booth and a nice man came to ask us about drinks which he was quick to return with.  We then ordered some food, we enjoyed the following: Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos:  These are usually my ""Go To"" when I visit BJs and I absolutely love them. The pita bread is fresh and the yogurt cream they use is tangy and delicious. The tomatoes and cucumbers lightly seasoned compliments well with this taco. The only complaint I have ever had is the cubed chicken mean, I would prefer perhaps shredded chicken or some other way way to cut it up.  We both opted for different sides, although the bistro grains are scrumptious as well.  We both chose to enjoy some of their delicious broccoli cheese soup.  Unfortunately this came out pretty cold as if the bowls were sitting on a counter too long but when we brought this up to our waiter - he took them back and had them warmed up.  To be honest, I would have preferred a fresher bowl, but we didn't want to wait any longer. My daughter also enjoyed the Mac & Cheese which was extremely yummy, very creamy with good seasonings and a bit different then we are use to but definitely something we would both order again. All in all our visit was rather good as well as the food and customer service. Thank you!"
Diron K.,"Dripping Springs, TX",34,293,405,4.0,8/19/2017,"We ate here for a friend's birthday and had a good experience. We all got the loaded burgers and unlimited fries. The burgers were unbelievably good. We also had their craft beer (hefeweizen), which was awesome. The only low point was the service, which started out great, but then was non existent. After some discussion with the waiter, the service was amazing again and ended amazing. We would definitely visit again."
Cj A.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,1/1/2018,I'm a big BJs fan. But this place has really gone downhill lately. The service is terrible. The wait staff is rude. Management is uncaring and unresponsive. The food is average at best. I'm never going back. There are way too many other better dining options in the area. I wouldn't be surprised to see this location shut down in the not so distant future if upper management doesn't address the problems at this restaurant.
Ashley V.,"Austin, TX",295,155,374,2.0,3/19/2017,"At first it reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory but with a brewery or bar vibe. We ordered the pork green verde queso to start. It came out, no pork just green sauce on queso. I told the waiter it didn't have pork he told me that I must've ordered the wrong one. He then brings out the queso with beef chili in it and says ""now there, that looks like it has pork in it"" I said ""I disagree, that's the other option that has beef chili in it. The verde one you brought didn't have any pork in it."" He said he would let the manager know and left the chili queso on the table.  My Cobb salad was decent at best. Tomatoes were mealy and chicken was obviously previously frozen. My boyfriends brisket burger was good.  Our queso should've been comped or he could've at least comped my boyfriends tea but nope.  Thanks Julio.    Bad food, bad service. Won't be coming back. Totally annoyed after our experience."
James H.,"Austin, TX",58,83,73,4.0,6/19/2017,"For me it will always start with the in house brewing selections and the free pint beer glass for Father's Day was a nice touch as it was Saturday I was eating there. Menu selection is broad and my maple salmon pita tacos hit the spot. The place kind of reminds me of  Bennigan's Restaurant from the 80's in the heyday, but with stronger & tasty food selections & wider beer selections. One minor concern was the table we were seated at lacked proper wipe down for clean appearance that you expect. More importantly, I can only bring my wife here as the peanut exposure to my son Jake is too great here."
Sara C.,"Austin, TX",237,112,222,4.0,12/12/2016,"BJ's can come off a little intimidating with its prices but I think its worth!  I came with a decent size group for a friend's birthday party. The place was pretty busy but the waiters did a great job at serving and being patient with us.  It did take a while for us to get our checks but it was understandable.  All the dishes that was ordered at our table seemed really delicious. I got a salad (forgot its name) and it got me full believe or not!  If its your friend or your birthday then you can request a free dessert for them! Its a smaller version than the original but hey, its free!  I would recommend this place for first timers but I don't know if BJ's would be my top 3 choices to go to next time."
Phoi L.,"Austin, TX",270,62,50,3.0,10/5/2016,"I came here with two other friends on October 4th for FREE PIZOOKIE DAY! Yumm!  BJ's is known for their deep dish pizzas, so I gave it a shot and ordered the mini (6 inches) BJ's Favorite: housemade meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. To my surprise, the dough was extremely soft and the toppings went very well together. The only thing I have to say is the meatballs tasted a little undercooked.  My friends and I ordered the classic Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream Pizookie and devoured that in less than 5 minutes. The combination of the two melted in my mouth and it was heaven. (Probably faster if we weren't trying to be courteous to each other.) Definitely recommend! Service was OK. I enjoyed dining at BJ's for it's decor and multiple-occasions type of restaurant."
Rhonda K.,"Greensboro, NC",73,24,21,5.0,5/1/2017,"I never do this (5 * rating) but honestly, 2nd only to Nello's Pizza, this was the beat deep dish pizza I have had ever. Sweet Pig Deep Dish pizza cooked 1-1/2 times for crispiness...YUM!  I am hard to please with pizza but I highly recommend. Nick was my server/bartender. He was personable, knowledgeable about the entire menu and made several suggestions. They have pretty good HH menu choices and i took advantage of the 1/2 off deep dish pizza. Not sorry at all."
Zuara L.,"Austin, TX",59,2,,1.0,9/30/2017,"If I could give ZERO stars, then I would. At my recent visit to BJ's on Sunset Valley, the service was horrible. The restaurant was not busy and the staff just stared at me. Eventually they came to help and the hostess was pretty rude to get my party a table. Then we sat down after 10 min, and the server took 20-30min to take our drink orders. Then, she took an hour to bring our drink. We ordered our food with our drinks and our friend had to leave so she asked to make the food to go and pay. The server said ""Well I don't know how long it will take. It's a pretty big table."" My friend had to cancel her order and the server rolled her eyes. Every time I've come to this BJ's service is horrible and it's never during a busy time of the day."
Jennifer M.,"Austin, TX",82,86,87,4.0,7/27/2017,Hit this place up for a light lunch. Love that they have a lunch portion menu that is very reasonably priced and more than enough food. I walked out feeling completely satisfied. The food was good but not great.... It had a little too much sauce for my taste. The waiter was great and very attentive. He was very quick and nice. The atmosphere was very inviting and comfortable. Would most likely come back to try an adult beverage at some point.
Cankat A.,"Austin, TX",22,22,3,2.0,8/6/2017,"Bj's is good for some things, but their pulled pork sandwich tasted bad. The meat was NOT fresh, had an off taste and was dry.  The jambalaya was over salted."
Olga L.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,11/11/2017,"Worst experience!  We were sitting in the bar eating pizza when we smelled something that smelled like dirty diapers.  Asked waitress what it was and she said the table next to us ordered Brussel sprouts.  Asked to speak to the manager.  By this time, my stomach is churning and I'm about to throw up.  The manager said it was one of their best sellers and there was nothing she could do and to complain to corporate.  Really????  You could have asked if we would like another table away from the stench.  Never, ever, ever going back!"
Lelo B.,"Columbia, MO",28,153,87,1.0,10/9/2017,"My friend made us eat here on Saturday and I'm still upset with her. Terrible Bj's Classic Chicken Sandwich (honey mustard). Just terrible. I took one bite and was ready to send it back, but didn't want to cause an issue with my friends. Anyway, BJ's is a place where people who don't know how to dine out go for dinner. In a city like Austin, you'd be nuts to spend your hard earned money on such crappy food."
LEIGH ANN B.,"Austin, TX",0,6,6,3.0,10/22/2017,Ribs not very tender bread for bread bowl was burned and the service was very very slow.  The broccoli with the ribs was supposed to be steamed but it was not. Ribs were not worth 23.00. The restaurant was not very busy at all wont be back
John F.,"Montgomery, AL",0,4,,1.0,4/30/2017,"Food was descent nothing to write home about.. server didnt seem to no the menu very well, then again its 15 pages long.. ordered the boneless wings, it looked like they took a squirt bottle with sauce and missed the wings completely..  Update as Im still sitting here.. There are two people at this table.. both or desert.. They bring one and put in middle of table and walk away.. no explanation or questions.. I was giving this place a 3 out of 5 now I wish I could give them the middle finger!!! I salute you  idiots of the food service industry.. You give people in the business a bad name. Update again.. it would be nice to asked how the check would be done instead of just dropping it off.. PS.. its not even  busy so zero excuses."
Derek P.,"San Antonio, TX",0,28,,3.0,7/12/2017,"Maybe I just have bad luck with servers at BJ's but I found myself stuck with an inattentive waiter who had a knowledge deficit when it came to the menu (although it is a long menu) and did not apply a coupon I had despite informing him three times that I had a coupon.  I liked the food but I found a lot of the options on the menu the same but in a different variety. It's mostly burgers and pizza of which we ordered the latter and it was very good but not worth the price. I don't even think the lunch options are worth the price either. You can find equal tasting food and better service at a local, non-chain restaurant nearby."
Allyssa S.,"Austin, TX",395,215,209,4.0,2/15/2017,"I had a quick lunch date here, ordered a house salad and clam chowder in a bread bowl. Which was freaking awesome! I loved the Garlic butter they put on the bread! I highly recommend trying it if you like clam chowder. Also, the pizookies (not sure how it's spelled) are very good and satisfies that sweet tooth! I liked the smores one! Plus there is a lot of variety on the menu and the root beer is a must try!"
Joel R.,"Austin, TX",0,15,,5.0,9/20/2017,I always sit at the bar and receive great service. Even when the place is busy you get great service. Tracy is one of the bar tenders and he's a really funny guy. I've also had Mike and Mika and they're great too. No complaints I always enjoy myself.
Cami J.,"Austin, TX",1,3,1,5.0,5/12/2017,"Now that my local Logan's Roadhouse is closed I was wondering where I would get my Friday night prime rib. Found it tonight at BJ's Brewhouse! And it came with two sides, salad and desert! Ordered it medium-rare and it was perfectly cooked. Rob and Carrie took great care of us."
Ekatarina V.,"Austin, TX",186,142,114,2.0,5/28/2016,Haven't been here in years. But the mini Ekat was famished & it was late.  The pizza looked really good. Don't be deceived by looks. I've had better frozen pizza at home.  The bad pizza went well with the disinterested server to make for a really uninspired dinner.  Yuck.
James B.,"Austin, TX",41,73,13,3.0,12/15/2016,"Food is always good, plenty of good options. But service was poor, prices aren't great. Custom beer just isn't competitive with other beers out there.  Should have sat at the bar I guess. Also, they said I had to announce I wanted the happy hour price to get the happy hour price, and that is ridiculous.  Not a good waitress."
dj s.,"San Jose, CA",4,13,9,4.0,12/8/2016,"Gluten-free options make this place a favorite for our family. Even tho the place is usually pretty dark inside, noisy & we'd prefer it otherwise, the food is usually good. I like that they actually know the difference between rare & medium rare.  The wait staff are always awesome, no matter which location we end up at. Now that's nothing short of a miracle these days."
Jamie D.,"Austin, TX",0,6,18,1.0,8/27/2017,"You have a million things on the menu and can't get a regular cheeseburger right. You have waitresses with serious attitude issues. This place is awful, go to In N' Out instead."
Julie P.,"Austin, TX",444,80,119,3.0,10/24/2016,"BJ's menu is extensive, but I always felt that the prices didn't meet the quality/quantity of the food. If their prices were a little more on the lower end I would definitely be more drawn to trying out more items on their menu. We've tried their pizza, pasta, salad, appetizers, and every time it's been a disappointment in one way or another. However, their service is always consistent at every visit - reason for 3 stars. Recently, we had our Paint Nite event here in the party seating area, separate from the rest of the restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and checked in with us whenever he could without being too bothersome in our painting activities."
Amy S.,"Austin, TX",40,104,78,4.0,4/16/2016,"Huge fan.  So many selections.  Sure it's not a mom and pop restaurant or catered to a specific cuisine, but if you don't know what you want or are with a party with a lot of different needs/wants - this is an excellent choice! We ordered the potato skins for an appetizer - deep fried?!  I've wondered if you could make potato skins better.  Turns out you can.  The plating was very nice as well. I ordered the Sriracha honey brussels sprouts.  So. Good. Crispy on the outside and full of flavor.  I also ordered the clam chowder - pretty good and there was a lot of clam!  Usually, that is my one complaint. The rest of the family enjoyed their meal.   4 stars - only down side was the service.  It wasn't extremely busy, but it took quite a bit of time for our server to get our drinks, check back, and finally bring us our check.  My neck is still sore from constantly looking over my shoulder hoping he'd pop over... Final note: right now, via Yelp, you can get $10 off $35."
LaPeshaa C.,"Austin, TX",113,284,458,1.0,3/11/2016,"Came in for drinks. Scotty the bartender comes up, introduces himself, and ask what we'd like. I asked for a couple of minutes. He said ok just don't snap or whistle at me when you're ready.... Weird, why the hell would I?! 10 minutes later, literally 10 minutes, he comes back. We order 2 drinks. 10 mins pass, no drinks. He doesn't come by or look our way so hubbie gets up and ask him about our drinks. He comes by and ask ""what did y'all want again?"" We tell him again. He takes off and another 10 mins go by and you guessed it, STILL NO DRINKS! He ask the folks next to us if they'd like another round. I intrude and say ""can we have our round 1st?"" He replies ""its coming"" and takes off. At this point I'm pissed so I get the mgr, as soon as he sees that he makes our drinks. Shannon, the manager, was no help at all. Her words were ""every since he came back something hasn't been right, I'll keep an eye on him"" Really?! I won't come here again.  The drinks were crap and the service was terrible!"
Kat M.,"Kyle, TX",8,37,,2.0,7/11/2017,I ordered a salad from this place for a meeting at work today and I had to say it was not a very pleasant lunch! My avocados were discolored with black dots all over them and the lettuce was wilted and a little sour tasting. I will not be ordering from this place any time soon. My coworker ordered the same thing and hers was in the exact same condition!! Just Pitiful!
Elizabeth F.,"Austin, TX",5,12,,1.0,6/15/2017,"I used to like the Enlightened Entrees until recently when quality started to go down and my orders were prepared incorrectly. And then tonight I had the Mahi mahi and have been suffering for the last several hours with histamine toxicity.  That comes from fish that is not properly refrigerated or not handled correctly, which results in bacterial growth that causes the food poisoning.  I still feel horrible 5 hours later. I am never going to eat at BJ's again."
Ann N.,"Killeen, TX",34,159,395,5.0,2/13/2016,"Visited this location for lunch and received great service. My husband enjoyed his meal but my avocado eggrolls weren't that appealing to me. The idea for them was excellent but my avocado was a little oxidized resulting in flavor confusion. Other than that, we had a really great visit. We remembered how delicious the pizzas were at the Vegas location and decided to order some for take-out. We loved these pizzas. If you really like that really bready but pan-crisp texture, this is up your alley. They pile that golden crust with abundant toppings and each slice portion is very filling. The chicken bacon ranch pizza was excellent and I would recommend it. Great pizza, good service, and nice location."
Debbie T.,"Austin, TX",39,5,,3.0,7/16/2016,"I have never disliked this restaurant, but... I tried to order tacos on corn tortillas, because I cannot have wheat without risking getting sick, and they only had flour/corn mix.  In Austin, where there are high numbers of gluten free people? In Texas, where we have amazing homemade tortillas (flour and corn!)?  I ended up quickly picking a salad from the menu because I was clearly holding things up. I did not like it and did not eat.  By, the time the waiter came back, my companion was done with two bowls of soup, and I did not want to make him wait for a new order, so I ended up not eating dinner. Poorly played, BJs. You have to pay better attention. I do not tend to like chains, so we may call it done. And, we got our check from our waiter before all the food was out. WTH? Who does that?  I eat out a lot... high end, dives, and everything in between. I have literally never seen that. A clear unspoken message...""get out."". Of more importance than the minor disappointment over fish tacos that I really wanted, that was the message we got from the time we ordered drinks until we left. Are we holding you up?   The hosts were great. The waiter needs to smile, be helpful, and generally act like the customers are not an inconvenience. It was not crowded, they did not need to turn tables...and he still ushered us in and out like it was McDonald's."
KEDREP C.,"Austin, TX",86,37,19,1.0,2/17/2017,"This location Sucks! Walked in @ 9:00sh, the hostess said hello, then said something to another hostess, then right on top of the hostess station the first hostess laid out employees W2forms in full view. Definitely a violation of her other employees privacy! So I sit down in waiting area, & then they look at me like OMG there's no wait. Next we are seated, &the wait for service begins. 10 minutes goes by & finally a mid 30-50s waiter stops by & says "" after I refill this other tables soda, I will come back to take your drink order. NOT, he goes to another table, then checks out his tip from another table, &&&&& once again passes us by. so I then interrupted his tip glory to ask.when he was gonna wait on us? he exclaims I'm gonna be right there. Beyond rude !!! Never had such indifference by total staff for guest services! SHAME"
Allen U.,"Odessa, TX",10,175,580,5.0,6/22/2016,"Visited this BJ's after a day out on Austin and figured we give it a try. The menu is very impressive we visited around 6pm on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately. We begun with a Pepperoni Flatbread for our appetizer was very crispy and rich in flavor simply a must! Then onto the entree which I ordered the Chicken Tortilla bowl (not pictured) which was very succulent, the cheesy mashed potatoes were delicious and so were the Dr.Pepper Ribs very sweet and tangy BBQ! Overall great food and a way to spend the evening. The service was fast and outstanding! Will highly recommend for an evening dinner."
Erin H.,"Austin, TX",152,119,78,3.0,2/26/2016,"Service is great and they have G Free options for pizza! However, it's loud and that's the downside for me. Great for large groups though.  They have space to accommodate you."
Kristi H.,"North Salt Lake, UT",0,18,3,5.0,12/21/2016,"The most professional waiter and host I've had in a long time at any restaurant!  I'm not sure If I can name them here, but it was at 1pm on December 1st.  Make server M.E. and male host C.  As far as food goes, there are tons of beers and I love that there are options for smaller portions and healthier foods.  Also, I had to order my Triple Decker sandwich dairy-free and they got it right; so many places usually mess that up.  Thanks for the great experience!"
Nikki R.,"Austin, TX",62,26,3,5.0,2/19/2017,"Not sure why this place only has 3 stars. My husband and I have been here several times and will continue to go. Great food, great service, great beers, great atmosphere. All the servers are great but Michael is especially great."
Adrianna E.,"Austin, TX",279,153,151,1.0,5/21/2016,"Man, I really dislike giving bad reviews but this experience was just bad all the way around .... I met up with a few friends on Friday night close to 9pm.  With graduation weekend commencing, I figured it would be busy but it really wasn't too bad.  We grabbed a table in the bar area that hadn't been bussed but as soon as the server came by she grabbed everything, so no big deal.  After grabbing the drink orders, it seemed to all go down hill and stay there for the rest of the night .  We never received sufficient menus for all 5 people , then my salad came out before the apps , still no silverware.  Upon asking the buzzer who brought my salad, he informed me that because it was so busy they had no clean silver ware .... Ummm, how the F am I going to eat my salad bruh? He then returns with a fork, no setting with napkin, just a fork, which wasn't exactly clean.   We finally order a few things to share , stuffed mushrooms , Brussels sprouts and lettuce wraps.  My friends husband order the deep dish ziti as well.  The food came out quickly enough only to find a very long blonde hair baked into the cheese on the ziti.  Needless to say, my appetite along with the person who ordered it , was completely gone.  Eventually, the manager came over And generically apologized to the wrong person in our party either way she offered a free dessert .   I've never been a huge fan of BJ's anyway, other than the pizookie, the food is salty and overpriced , but this experience has cured me from chains for good ."
Katie W.,"Austin, TX",4,27,10,1.0,5/23/2016,"Damn it!!! I used to love BJs so much! When I lived up north, the one on Mopac was my go-to for datenight, and for afterparty deliciousness. The avocado egg rolls were so addicting, it wasn't fair. Flash-forward to last night, I might as well have lit $40 on fire and flushed it down the toilet. I ordered avocado eggrolls, calamari, and a pulled pork sandwich for pick up. The calamari was chewy, bland, and soggy. The avocado in the avocado eggrolls was black and the wrapper was soggy.  Don't even get me started on the pulled pork sandwich. The meat tasted like it was cooked a week ago. In good faith, I tried smothering it in bbq sauce, but the rancidity was overpowering. It was just too far gone. Everything I ordered went in the trash.  In all honesty, I can overlook the sogginess of the calamari and eggrolls, because when you put hot food in an air-tight plastic container, it's going to steam. But the blackness of the avocado and the taste of that pulled pork will haunt me in my sleep forever.  I hate it when something that used to bring you so much joy goes so far south. I used to love BJs! DAMMIT!!!! (I can't say that without giggling just a little bit, but I'm still angry!) PS: I must say though that the young gentleman at the takeout counter was extremely pleasant and professional. He deserves a raise."
Kyle K.,"Austin, TX",99,3,,4.0,9/15/2016,Been enjoying coming here to try out different brews that they make. The food is pretty good too! Last time I visited the waiters were quite rude to us since we didn't order food.  All we ordered was appetizers and drinks. Besides that excellent place!
