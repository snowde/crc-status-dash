Josh R.,"Austin, TX",31,17,3,3.0,6/29/2010,"I don't usually like coWHOREporate restuarants but I really love a good beer, which they had: their PM Porter was as good a beer as one could hope for from a place such as this and was my favorite--great dark beer with chocolate goodness and a surprisingly wonderful aftertaste.  YUM!  Also, enjoyed the Tatonka Stout, which had similar properties to the first but with more alcoholic punch but lacking a tiny bit of the taste that I preferred. The food is good, not great but they do their thing better than most of the corporate eateries.  The environment is the now typical smooth, smart look that every other ""upscale"" chain-theme-place has adopted with the pseudo-unfinished ceilings, exposed pipes/ducts and the slick paint that WAS independent, 20 years ago. I went here with some out-of-town company but it wasn't a place that I'd have selected.  Thanks to the beer, it was enjoyable."
Marcello L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,91,,3.0,10/28/2013,"The food was quite good, as has been my experience before at other locations, and the decor was the standard BJ's upscale-esque (though noisy--bad acoustics), but of the five people we interacted with (as well as other workers, from what we could tell), everyone who works there seems to have been miserable. The service was fine--our server was quite attentive, as a matter of fact--but not one person on staff ever smiled. That has a lot to do with my low score. I also can't stand televisions in restaurants, especially when there's not one seat that doesn't face one (at least they weren't loud). Ambiance is important to me, and I'd rate the overall feel and mood a one star (and a four for the food)."
David R.,"Austin, TX",3,62,,3.0,5/26/2011,"This place has a great selection of beers on tap, including some pretty decent brews of their own.  It's sort of like the Elephant Room, but with a full menu.  The food is OK.  Not great; not bad.  If you like good beer, this is a great place to down a few pints.  If you're not into beer, no real reason to stop in here."
Jayson H.,"Austin, TX",84,21,6,4.0,9/13/2013,"I go to BJ's about once a month.  The food is always fantastic and they have some very good house beers.  My personal favorites are; Great White Pizza and Parmesan Crusted Chicken with a Harvest Hefeweizen to wash it down.  My girlfriend gets salads and house mixed drinks which she always enjoys.  I have never had any problems with the food.... when It was brought out correctly. Which brings me to my only complaint... Service.  Either they don't train enough or they don't care enough to make sure their servers are attentive enough to get orders right and follow up with their tables.  I've had issues on many occasions where service was slow or just unprofessional.  It doesn't keep me from coming back because the food and beers are that good.  It also helps to have a wall of TV's in the bar for me to watch my sports.   If you are going on a Friday or Saturday make sure you call ahead to get your name on the list.  They have up to an hour wait most Fri and Sat nights.  The bar is always first come first serve so even if you are on the list, you can often get a table in the large bar area before you are called up."
Adonis G.,"Austin, TX",252,1,,1.0,11/14/2014,"Where do I begin. I've been to BJ's about 20 times mostly sitting at the bar which Scotty provides excellent service. The problem is when sit anywhere besides the bar. The service is terrible, the managers are very disrespectful, and the experience was horrific. We sat down 15 minutes before Happy Hour was ending. Attempted to order From the Happy Hour menu only to be told that we couldn't from seating areas other than the bar. I requested to talk to a manager in which he came out 10 minutes or so later to tell us that we can order from the happy hour menu from where we are seated, but after 7 the happy hour ends. At this point it's 7:03 and if it hadn't been for them taking their time getting to us, I'll orders would have been placed well before 7. The manager that came out to talk to us had an attitude like no other. I find that very disrespectful as a paying customer who visits frequently. I will not stand for that no longer and that's why I'm giving this place one star. They need to get it together!"
Alyssa D.,"Austin, TX",142,14,2,5.0,9/10/2011,BJ's never fails me.. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. Spinach stuffed mushrooms and Oreo pazookie are a MUST!!
Marcy B.,"Austin, TX",9,17,2,4.0,11/24/2010,Fantastic place for Lunch. They have an extensive lunch menu for under $10 and it's a lot of food. I from New England and I'm picky when it comes to clam chowder but theirs passed the test especially in a bread bowl with oyster crackers.  They also have great a great selection of  handcrafted beers.
Shannon S.,"Austin, TX",237,19,,4.0,1/11/2011,"Drove down from NE Austin with my wife & two young kids. We had to wait about 30 minutes on a Saturday night (call ahead to get on the list!), so we snacked on some free pizza.  The waitstaff are Austin-style cool and there were lots of young couple w/ well-behaved kids in the dining room mixed w/ older folks watching football on all the TVs. Note: well-behaved. They had cold craft beers, tasty (& a bit pricey) food and good desserts.  We brought our old BJ's growler to take home some beer and were suprised to learn this location isn't allowed to serve alcohol in growlers. WTH TABC?! We filled up w/ Root Beer instead. Great evening, we'll be back."
Heather L.,"Austin, TX",49,32,,5.0,6/12/2013,"We miss you!!!!  Now that we live in North Austin, we haven't been to this location in quite a while.  BUT this is the best BJ's location in town.  The bartenders and staff know what they are doing.  Order two appetizers and drink beer for a few hours and the price and atmosphere is perfect for a date night.  Love it!"
Jennifer O.,"Austin, TX",189,121,24,2.0,4/19/2010,"Yeeeecccch.  I'll give them 1 star for decent atmosphere and service, and another star for decent beer.  I tried the Jeremiah Red which was tasty, and my dining companions had the Blonde which everyone seemed to enjoy. But as a restaurant, this place just doesn't deliver.  I ordered a pasta dish thinking that an extensive pasta selection on their menu meant they knew what they were doing.  My mistake!  The ""chardonnay shrimp"" pasta now holds the distinction of being the single worst pasta dish I've ever ordered in a restaurant.  ""Bland"" is far too generous a word for the sauce that this pasta was swimming in.  Not creamy, not cheesy, not tomatoe-y, and certainly not as flavorful as the word ""chardonnay"" in the title would imply.  I've had better pasta sauce from a JAR, but I paid $14.95 for this ""creation"" -- talk about an expensive mistake. My boyfriend ordered a meatloaf sandwich that ranked somewhere between Lean Cuisine and Stouffer's on the meatloaf spectrum of deliciousness.  What a disappointment. One beer, one appetizer, 2 entrees, and some tax + plus tip later, I was out $61 and wishing that I had gone to Carraba's, or even Cheesecake Factory.  Don't reward lazy, uninspired, California chain cuisine."
Leslie H.,"Pflugerville, TX",123,425,98,3.0,2/3/2011,"I've only ever been to BJ's twice (once at this location and once in Houston).  They are pretty decent with most items, so say my co-diners, and my food has been tasty, as well.  The desserts are where it's at, though, and I look forward to the opening of the BJ's in Arbor Walk, which is closer to my home, to satisfy sudden hot cookie and cold ice cream cravings.  BIG down side: $5.75 for a glass of Sam Adams.  Seems kind of steep for one glass of draft beer."
Danny T.,"Austin, TX",10,25,3,3.0,4/3/2010,"They did a great job accommodating our table of 20 people. We called in to pre-order and they allowed us to fax over everyone's orders before we came so the food would be ready by the time we arrived. FAX! I'd say a restaurant's quite savvy when folks can flipping FAX orders in.  The food (with the testimonies of others around me) was decent. Their menu includes a ""Lighter Options"" list with food options under 690 calories so people like me can feel better about myself after eating out. (Restaurant calories aren't REAL calories right? Ha ha). I was apprehensive of the avocado eggrolls but many people on here seem to enjoy it. But it is good. Really good. Makes for an amazing appetizer. Or meal. Dessert too. Or all three - it's not overindulging if I'm in self-denial."
Mark H.,"Austin, TX",329,431,595,2.0,1/12/2008,"Wish I could give a bit more love to BJ's. However, it is mediocre verging on 'boycott-able'.  BJ's menu is huge, they offer a selection of special beers (note: they imply that it is made in-house but this is not a 'true' brewpub from what I can tell), and the atmosphere is ""huge sports bar"" with TVs blaring various games from around the restaurant. Kind of schizophrenic in a way: plush wood panelling with romantic lighting overwrought by NFL bleats and bleeps from the huge plasmas. I have to admit that I like the side Ceasar salad and the Turkey Cobb sandwich lunch special (half sandwich and salad for $6.95). However, the baked potato entree is huge and mealy - definitely seemed like an Archer-Daniels-Midland mutant genetically-modified 'product' rather than real food. The topping on the potato was non-existent; I had to ask my long-absent waitress to take it back and 'do it over.' The beer was so-so which is disappointing for a place that makes a big deal of its beer. I had the 'kolsch"" which at ""BJ's"" (eh hem...snicker) is really more of a pilsner. Kolsch is not common in the USA so I can forgive them on their mistake, I guess. The cookie like thing they serve with ice cream for dessert is good but a tad pricey (I think it was like $7!). They worst thing about a visit to BJ's is that the service is a total mess. It takes FOREVER to get acknowledged by a waitperson. More often than not, they screw up your order, overcharge you and/or forget stuff like silverware, water, refills, etc. This has happened on ALL four visits I've made to this place. The thing that REALLY pisses me off is that I ALWAYS get my salad course served WITH my entree. What gives with this? I can either send back the entree (where it sits under a heat lamp) or just accept the horrible service and eat on. Maybe it is a new MBA-manager way of turning over tables more often?? This SUCKS! It would be one thing if BJ's were cheap (...snicker) but, hey, this is a place where it can cost $20 for a beer, side salad, and sandwich with tip. They need to train their staff to at be at LEAST as competitive as other chains, like Chili's, Chuck E. Cheese, or the hot dog stand at Costco's.  Two stars (barely). Avoid going unless your boss is paying. Be prepared for waitstaff that can't do their job. Management seems to be MBA-types who care more about 'metrics' than customer service. Be warned that the chances for disappointment here are high. Bad sports bar feng shui. Good break up or last date venue (too loud to hear complaints)."
Ryan S.,"Austin, TX",4,11,,2.0,10/20/2011,"I didn't like this place. Prices were not great, not much alternative to the gross fried, cheesy, greasy foods. I have to eat gluten free and they do offer very few items, but they threw croutons in my soup after I ordered gluten free. I just scooped them out, but when I ordered a second bowl they put even more croutons in it. What? This gave me the sense that my gluten free face was not wanted here. heh I did not like your greasy overpriced noisy restaurant anyway! :P Anyway, of course it's noisy. It's pretty much a sports bar. I'm sure it's a nice place to watch the game with a buddy, but definitely not a good place to take a date or if you are enjoy quality food. We only ended up going there because parking is so terrible in this shopping center. It was the only one with parking available. Probably because it is lame."
Erin S.,"Austin, TX",112,119,1,3.0,2/16/2011,"BJ's is a decent, reliable chain that has a location near our house.  We probably eat there about 4-6 times a year. It's a very attractive restaurant--all brick, lots of TVs--reminds me of Champp's (which I wish so much would come to Austin!).  Big comfy leather booths and big tables to accomodate plates and glasses. The beer selection is very good--very above-average for a chain restaurant!  Beer prices are about average.  Their microbrewed beers are pretty good too.  I like the bombshell blonde (I think that's the name of it). The food?  Mediocre at best and definitely more expensive than I'd prefer to pay.  I've had their pizzas which are okay.  I love deep dish pizza and I think Uno's has it all over BJs in the chain-restaurant deep-dish category. I've had the salads which aren't anything too spectacular.  My husband usually gets the angel hair pomodoro which he likes.   So, if you're in the neighborhood and looking for OK-but-overpriced food, good beer and good ambiance, look no further."
vidor h.,"Austin, TX",28,183,2,2.0,1/4/2012,"*sniff- sniff*  what's that smell? why, it's the smell of  vapid kalifornia strip-mall ass! Lot's of big screens. Basically an updated Bennigan's menu,  food that goes with ketchup, with a few ""exotic"" items like Portobello with  cheeze sludge melted on it. wild huh? really.  $11 burger that tastes like my shoe, but drier.   Thing is, wasn't there a Red Robin next door that mysteriously disappeared? this place must'a  ate it. Decent beer selection- otherwise, same shiz. Bland/Blah/Box of Mer'cana"
Dawn M.,"Austin, TX",185,425,64,4.0,12/23/2009,"About a year ago, husband brought me a to-go order from here - I believe it was a wedge salad.  It was, by far, the worst wedge salad I have ever consumed.  I was filled with fury, because c'mon, who fucks up a wedge salad?  I vowed to never walk inside BJ's.   Fast forward to last night, being in the forgiving holiday spirit, decides to give BJ's a try to redeem itself from the wedge salad debacle.   I have to say, every thing was really, really excellent.  We had a very cute server who was on her game - refilling our $2 beers before the end of happy hour, checking up on us to make sure we were happy.  Amanda, good job dear!  And the handcrafted beers - very impressed!  The hefe was excellent, so smooth and tasty, no lemon needed, it was perfect. The food was also surprisingly good - we started off with calamari, which I have never, ever been served with ranch AND marinara sauce.  It was not the best calamari I've had, but I would rank it up there with acceptable.  I hate to admit it, but ranch and calamari are a pretty good combination.  Husband had a mini pizza and I ended up with the roast beef dip.  Both get thumbs up - and the thin fries were oh so good.   So I'm sorry BJ's for being such a crab.  I promise I'll be back and never forsake you again.  I'm just not sure I will ever try the wedge salad again."
Nicole B.,"Austin, TX",18,20,11,4.0,1/16/2013,My mom and I had lunch here last week. She wanted a turkey burger with fries and I had no idea where we would go until I googled it. BJS was the spot! She had what she wanted and I had a California burger. The food was good and the house made cream soda was great. The customer service was excellent. We definitely enjoyed our lunch :-)
Celine S.,"Austin, TX",30,117,14,5.0,9/25/2012,Terrific place to go hang out with friends..  watch a game..  have a wonderful dinner off of their really terrific menu!!! You just can't go wrong here!  :-)
Steve H.,"Austin, TX",681,458,2222,3.0,11/24/2009,"First let my start by saying that I expected this place to be bad. I came in took a seat and took one look at the novel of a menu complete with pictures and just knew this place was going to be bad. The menu was like a novel which is also usually a bad sign. My fried ordered the Calamari and it was so good, I was shocked that a place like this had such good Calamari. The beer selection was excellent! I had the chicken fried steak, living in Texas all my life I've learned that if you not sure about a place you get the chicken fried steak and sure enough it was a winner. I tried the seasonal pumpkin ale and it was better than most pumpkin ales. I loved the porter it was rich and chocolaty. I'll go here from time to time, its a good place."
