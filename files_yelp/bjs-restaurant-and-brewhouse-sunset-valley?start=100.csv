Brian S.,"Houston, TX",0,10,1,5.0,6/7/2016,Very pleasant waitress.  Half-price Mondays are especially good for a movie with grandson followed by pizza and pazooli dessert.  We have been here 3 times in the past 4 months and every time was a winner.  The pizza is very flavorful and we scrape the pan to get every little crumb.  I look at some other reviews that are unfavorable and I can't imagine how they didn't like the pizza.  It is full of flavor and really great.  We always have the pepperoni and absolutely love it.  The triple pazooli for dessert caps off a wonderful afternoon.  We will be back every time after a movie.
Jack D.,"Austin, TX",0,62,1,2.0,4/19/2014,"If brewhouse is in the name of the restaurant, why didn't our waitress know anything about beer, what was available, the types they currently do have? I asked the waitress if they had a particular style and she thought it was the name of a beer. Do they not get trained on beer?  I ordered a seasonal beer which wasn't good at all. At all. The food was average at best. Better than something I would just throw in the microwave but far far from being fresh non frozen."
Jessica L.,"Austin, TX",0,24,,3.0,6/9/2015,"Well it was a typical experience of what I expect out of chain restaurants, service was decent , the presentation is better than food itself, Got my ticket and got charged three times for one item and got charged for tea that never made it to my table, wasn't busy at all , I don't know how that happened but wasn't too happy but overall it's not a go-to spot for me. It was OK ."
Christi K.,"Austin, TX",50,114,644,5.0,5/11/2015,"I really liked this place. I'm not sure why people seem to dislike it so much. We didn't have a bad experience here. My husband and I went on a Saturday night around 6:30/7 and there was no wait. We were seated right away and our server was there immediately. We started with the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which were very good. I liked both dipping sauces it came with, but favored the Santa Fe dressing over the avocado cream sauce. The outside crust was crispy and flaky. They were greasy, but it's a fried roll, it's supposed to be! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. I enjoyed these. I ate one whole taco and the other I just ate the inside. I wasn't a fan of the grains that came as a side. It wasn't that they were bad, I just don't like stuff like that. My husband got the Hickory brisket and bacon burger. Talk about a meat lovers dream and heart attack. It was a patty, bacon and brisket with cheese on it. He absolutely enjoyed it!! He said it was one of the better burgers he has had in a long time. He ordered the wedge fries with it. I ate those off this plate ;) We both liked them, it's a wedge fry, what's not to like. I always like the seasoning on wedge fries. This place has such a large menu, it's overwhelming what to order. I can't wait to go back and try some different items."
Amanda B.,"Austin, TX",2,4,,1.0,5/26/2016,"This review is mostly for experience. I've been to just about all of the bjs in Austin.. But this one can't seem to get even close to good costumer service. NEVER ORDER TO GO!!! Unless you want to pay for things you don't even get. They have left things out of my order every time I have gotten food. But to last night. I came in to order because last time I did curb side and called it took them 20 min to bring me my ice cold food. I went in and waited for ever because some blond guy at check out couldn't get the lady in front of me checked out. Hers ended up being 50 flat and she didn't tip. So I went to check out and started looking through MY OWN ORDER instead of the employee verifying I have what I paid for. I kindly informed him he forgot my items and it's been consistent here. He did apologize and got me a soda while my boyfriend and I waited for them to fix our order. Again that I paid for. To come to check me out and put my food in the bag to tell me to ""have a nice day, not that's completely sarcastic I hope your day sucks"" in such a fake sarcastic voice, yea that's what an employee said. You want to know why?!! Cause the woman in front didn't tip. I left him like 10% tip on my receipt but instead of looking at the things he didn't finish he just automatically assumed that one was mine. I even tried to explain to him that receipt wasn't mine it was hers. He didn't even care to listen. I let it go because he didn't look fully there..I should have gotten a manager. So embarrassing there were people all around. By farrrr the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant industry. Will be talking negatively about this restaurant any time asked. Will not be coming back . And I'm writing a letter to the corporate office. You guys need to get your to go ordering fixed. And loose the assholes that you hire. Just cause that's the only job that they can get. They need more experience in costumer service. This guy wasn't new or anything cause he did chime to me well I hope that wasn't me who had messed it up before he started being rude.  If there was an option to rate no stars or even negative that's what I would truly be rating. Don't come here unless like I said you want to pay for things you don't even get, have cold food when you get it, be mistreated by staff, then be treated like you owe them something more just because they fixed your messed up order!!!! So ridiculous and could definitely express way more on how frustrated I am at this specific business. No wonder all the bjs are popping but this one hardly packs full. Unbelievable and will be spending my money else where. I've easily spent a few $100 here on prior orders."
A V.,"Austin, TX",0,9,2,1.0,6/13/2016,"We went for dinner on Sunday, 12-Jun-2016. The overall experience was subpar. They took over 1 hour to bring our food and there were only 4 in our party. The food was cold and the pizza was soggy. The manager comp'd our meal, which was a plus. Keep your expectations low."
Greg B.,"Austin, TX",29,35,2,3.0,12/17/2014,"I see that BJ's has an average rating of 3 stars which is exactly right. This place has average food, average drinks and average service. Not that I am complaining.  If you can't figure out where to go to watch a game or have a meal and you're in the neighborhood then BJ""s is always an option. Their signature dessert, I believe it is called a Pizookie, is pretty good acutally.  It is three warm cookies with ice cream and whipped cream on top. I got the mini pizza today and it was average at best. It seems like they have much better prices during lunch than for dinner."
Linda V.,"Elgin, TX",35,5,,1.0,6/4/2015,The steaks are horrible! It was either super rare or burnt. They can't cook a decent steak if their lives depended on it. Stay away from steak!
Shawn B.,"Kansas City, MO",105,465,357,1.0,10/13/2012,What happened to this place?  It used to have such good pizza.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza and it was pathetic.  My son and I looked over the entire medium pizza and found only 1 piece of bacon.  This was indicative of the rest of the ingredients as well.  This thing was mostly crust and hardly any toppings. Charging ridiculous prices for a pizza that is on par with a $1.50 frozen pizza...never going back.
Krittika K.,"Austin, TX",3,16,6,5.0,8/2/2015,"I absolutely love love love their food. Their southern chicken is my all time favorite and their stuffed mushrooms are to die for. I love them so much I even recreated them at home. The ambience is great, comfortable seating perfect for a good dinner. The staff is friendly, does not rush you into ordering food and they have a wide variety in their menu. I can never have enough of eating there. Must-try! Great food, good setting and decently priced!!"
Cory M.,"Austin, TX",6,29,2,4.0,2/10/2014,"I have no clue why my buddy Steve H rated this place a 3 star, he didnt say 1 negative thing!!!! LOL  My family and I go here from time to time and I like this place. The Ambiance is nice right when you walk in. It has a modern wood feel to it. Also there are TV screens around the walls and bar area, but they are not overwhelming for others who do not wish to watch them. The beer selection is massive and they brew a lot of their own. I think I had the porter ale that was pretty damn good last time. Calamari appetizer is very good and tender (breading not too heavy). Their burgers are really good and I order them here a lot. They are flamebroiled and always come out tasty. I have also had the shrimp tacos that are good but not enough food if you ask me. On the down side: Menu is too big. Its hard to navigate the whole thing and seems like its all over the place. Also sometimes when busy our waiter has taken a bit longer than normal (as to be expected), but has happened to us a few times so had to mention. Lastly some items are way overpriced. But if you hunt enough on the menu you will find affordable items. Overall a pretty enjoyable restaurant and I would recommend going here."
Katherine F.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,2/9/2016,"Was going to dine here for the 1st time......guess that didn't work out.  Every open table in the bar area was dirty and needed bussing.  Bartender told us we can sit anywhere. Told him every place was dirty including the bar seats in front of him.  His response ""I CAN'T come out there.  Buddy you could have responded that you would get someone to clean them or take initiative and clean the bar in front of you so we would stay.  Goodbye BJs!!"
Melinda A.,"Affton, MO",0,14,,1.0,4/4/2015,Pizza is okay Fries were cold and old tasting Carrots and celery (side for kids meal) were browned and dirty looking Burgers were served cold Strawberries (side for kids meal) were not edible Beer is great! Not going back.
Ella D.,"Plano, TX",1323,419,1599,3.0,8/12/2013,"Eh. More like 2 1/2.  First, the rant: Service at the bar was egregiously slow. And the bartender we had has a habit of printing out your tab after EVERYTHING you order and putting it in a rocks glass right in front of you. We seriously thought we were being cut off and closed out after ordering a first round. We had to ask him what was going on and he said he does it to avoid discrepancies or confusion about tabs. Which we read as: I've had arguments in the past with customers about tabs and this is how I make sure you know what's on your tab at all times. Hint: this is uncomfortable and a bit rude - and unnecessary. He reprints the tab every time you make an order and puts it right back in front of you.  If you do it for yourself, then keep the tabs in your book or your apron so that if a customer has a question about what you've charged, then you can refer to it. But this is an extra step you're taking time to do that potentially makes customers uncomfortable (it's pushy and it makes the tab / money a focal point of the experience) when you're already weeded. Stop it.  That being said, the bar stools were probably 3/4 taken and the dining room was starting to bustle, but there was only one bartender who wasn't a pro at multi tasking to begin with. Now, the goods: I've never had their pizzas but the ones I saw coming out looked appetizing enough. We ordered just beverages and two appetizers - Chips and Salsa and the Avocado Egg Rolls. Of the two, I found the chips & salsa more remarkable. But to be fair, my friend loves the egg rolls and always orders them. I recommend ordering them with ranch dressing instead of the dipping sauce it comes with (which is very sweet) Now, that being said, I actually have to say their salsa is pretty darn good. A mini bottle (two pours) of Chandon is only about $8.75 and they have a decent wine and very nice beer selection.  They have a kid's menu which, for a sports bar that's leaning upscale, was unexpected to me. I've had lunch here in the past with my daughter who loves their pinwheel potatoes (their version of fries... and that's not what they're called, it's just how I remember them.) Also, if you order the chicken tenders, they're made fresh, not frozen and nuked... I know this because I once had to send them back as the centers were pink. The entire meal was replaced instantly and we were perfectly taken care of, so I had no problems with them and appreciate that they make these from scratch.  The big shout out I have for BJ's? Best damn Ranch Dressing I've had. I'm serious. I don't know why. In the past, we've asked for extra to take it home in ramekins.  More staff behind the bar during peak hours, please!"
Chiqui B.,"Austin, TX",468,478,2345,3.0,10/16/2011,"When I get off a late gig and find myself hungry in Sunset Valley, this is the place that is usually open and serves something that won't make me feel sick in the morning. I order their pizza because they're light on the sauce, thin crust, and make a nice shareable snack. We sit at the bar b/c the boyfriend likes their beer and we figured out that the service is better there anyway.  We don't do shady servers."
Olatunde G.,"Austin, TX",102,79,2,3.0,7/5/2015,The food was fine and the atmosphere was good. Haven't really been back after one meal here... Makes me think of a high end TGI Fridays for some reason...
Jessica B.,"Lees Summit, MO",5,66,8,1.0,11/14/2014,The food is always great but i have to tell you that the manager and the floor manager that were on duty on 11.14.14 at 7 oclock were the rudest people ever. The floor manager tried to tell us what some policy was that was non existent about happy hour and then the general manager came over to tell me that the floor manager was wrong but since it was past 7 we could not order and get happy hour prices. IT WAS 7:03! AND IT WAS THEIR FAULT FOR DEBATING!!!! we would had ordered 10 minutes ago if they werent ridiculous. Both manager had an attitude; that is absolutely unacceptable!
Lisa R.,"Austin, TX",14,148,1,4.0,4/27/2015,"I'm embarrassed to say how often we go here to eat, mainly because it's open so late! The food is pretty good. They always let me switch up salad dressings and toppings if I want and their drinks are solid. Flat bread pizza is good, happy hour hors d'oervres aren't very healthy, but we like them."
Ronald M.,"Austin, TX",1,22,42,3.0,6/3/2015,"Came to BJs today to meet with a friend and have lunch. It was not busy and so it was good that we got there early. I chose the ribeye since it was on the first page and it was looking at me. I asked for it to be cooked medium. It came out medium rare. Ya, I should have asked there waiter to changed it but I just felt I was going to bother them. I will take it home and grill it real quick. The service was decent overall."
John Rankin S.,"Austin, TX",30,4,12,4.0,5/30/2015,"Some food is excellent & some is average. The craft beer is good as is the atmosphere. Very classy while being somewhat of a sports bar. In fact, the sport hater in your group won't even notice you watching the game. That is unique"
