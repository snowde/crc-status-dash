Wade W.,"Austin, TX",0,11,10,1.0,3/28/2016,Unlike the north location which has absolutely exceptional service (maybe the GM of the bordie location needs to take notes from the north MoPac location or even fired!) this place ranks far lower in customer service due to a very rude and unprofessional server. I will never return to this location on boride lane. Came here to have dinner before catching movie at the Alamo draft house and unexpectedly waited 30 mins for our food to come out and being that there were only about 25 people in this place you'd think the wait wouldn't have been more than 20  mins. The guy that sat down 10 mins after we did had his food after about 10 mins. you would think someone would have offered some kind of pleasant offer for the wait but instead all we got was a walk by promise that our food was on its way out only to sit there another 15 mins hungry and by that time we had no choice but to leave so we wouldn't be late for the  movie. Thanks for the disappointment!!
Debbie B.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,5.0,4/18/2016,"Hubby had lunch portion Tyme Chicken and he loved it. I had lunch special mini pizza and Ceasar and I loved it, too!! Yummy!!!"
Neil S.,"Spicewood, TX",0,5,,2.0,1/10/2016,"One patty of a double burger undercooked rather dramatically, other medium. string cut French fries greasy. Got the meal for free as I only ate what was minimally appetizing. Server got the write off without my asking for it. Gave her a good tip."
Angel C.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,5.0,7/9/2015,"First time here and I'll come back. Come see Erin at the bar, her recommendations were great and great service. One of the best Mojitos in Austin."
Jean M.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,1.0,12/30/2015,"Eh...no thanks. Tried it once, will not return. Not sure if it was the ghetto waitress face timing with a male friend (who can see everything) in the women's restroom while refilling toilet paper and paper towels and talking loudly about Nicki Minaj lyrics or the overly doughy mediocre pizza or a combination of both. Will not be returning nor will I be recommending this place to anyone I care about."
Lauren I.,"Austin, TX",59,121,24,2.0,1/6/2014,"Hubs and I had a burger and beer craving and this was the first place we saw that could satisfy both...ugh...I've never been a big of BJ's to begin with, but I'd yet to try a burger there so there we went.  So first the good....the beer. Yup, that's about it. My hubs said they had a good selection and the one he chose was excellent to him. So the bad....everything else? The burgers came out wrong and by the time we saw our server again it was too late to really do anything about it. Whatever, I can forgive that. But the burgers themselves....oh god where do I start? Whoever thought that this was how burger meat was meant to taste was wrong...way wrong. It looked gross, it was way overcooked, and had next to no flavor. And I didn't think you could mess up placement of toppings this badly, but you can...bacon slices stacked on one side, the blue cheese barely crumbled and practically smooshed into the meat...and more..meh, it was REALLY disappointing. We got the Pazookie because I always get a kick out of the idea that they have like a room in the kitchen full of easy bake ovens...just wall to wall easy bake ovens...they look exactly like something I made when I was 7 or 8..same tins, same texture. Good memories and a laugh."
Melissa F.,"Austin, TX",37,31,4,1.0,11/6/2014,"I used to love this place, one of my favorite places to go. Now...not so much. The service was horrible!! Took forever to get our food and when we did it wasn't that good. You could tell it had been sitting for a while. We went ahead and ordered dessert because I love their cookies, but that took forever too and wasn't very good, hard and over baked. Most of all.. The service. It wasn't even busy. Only good thing was the part of getting to spend an hour a half with my boyfriend and the cream soda."
Dahlia A.,"Austin, TX",33,40,69,2.0,3/20/2015,A true disappointment. We ordered our usual favorites this evening. My chicken lettuce wraps came to the tables missing some ingredients and my husband's pasta shrimp was flavorless. Gabriel our server was great so I wouldn't blame the poor dishes on him but the kitchen staff certainly needs a talking to. Might not come out this way again for a while.
Nic C.,"Austin, TX",0,59,1,1.0,1/5/2015,Server wasn't great. My plain burger had burnt onions and onion sauce (?) ... little odd. But wasn't very appetizing over all. I don't understand how plain means wipe off as much juice and onions but leave some around... gaah there's no part of plain burger that asks for onions =( good porter!
Karon H.,"Austin, TX",23,7,6,5.0,4/27/2015,"Always enjoy coming to BJ's, this evening was particularly nice as we had a wonderful wait person named Sandra. She was superb, very helpful with questions concerning the happy hour menu. Over all s very good experience.... Thank you Sandra!!!"
Melanie M.,"Far West/Northwest Hills, Austin, TX",9,24,3,4.0,11/22/2014,"A little pricey, but otherwise we always have great service and the food is tasty.  They have wifi as well.  My hubby and I were able to sit and chat after dinner, planning our boys' Christmas presents while on the internet for ideas.  Excellent martinis as well."
Phil B.,"Round Rock, TX",4,31,,2.0,9/23/2014,"Started off with avocado egg rolls that were very good.   I had great hopes for the rest but that was it.    I played it safe with chicken tortilla soup and a Caesar salad.  The salad was made with iceberg lettuce.   Sorry guys,  it is supposed to be made with what romaine lettuce.  Fine I can live with kids portion of iceberg, but then I started on the soup.    This soup I think is great, but was cold.  The cheese was shredded and still solid.    Staff was good and seemed concerned about doing a good job."
Mathew T.,"Austin, TX",25,34,4,5.0,6/3/2015,"excellent lunch menu,very reasonable prices and quick service. I can leave my office about 5-7 minutes away at 1pm and get there, park, order, eat, pay and still be back to my office by 2pm."
Mimi G.,"Austin, TX",56,193,,2.0,11/29/2013,"I was not very impressed by the place whats so ever. It automatically started with my mother and I walking in. You walk up to this random stand and tell the woman the amount of people you want to sit and she just acted as if we were taking up her damn time. She had the worst attitude and acted like she did not want to work there. Not only did she not great us when we walked in, she didn't even make eye contact with us when we were talking to her. SERIOUSLY! Hire someone who at least can fake it!  Than we got passed to the lady who actually sat us. She was very nice and told us who are waiter was. Our waiter was sweet and got us everything we needed for dinner but he just seemed so over whelmed and exhausted. He looked like he had been having a long week.  Ordering was just an experience itself. My menu was sticky and felt like it had a 5 year old playing with it. My hands were gross afterwards.  We ended up ordering their Mint Chocolate Martini drink (which was actually very delicious!! I would recommend the drink to anyone), mozzarella cheese sticks, and Tuscan Chicken Limone (pasta). Mozerella sticks were ok and the Chicken Limone I could have live without. The texture of it was weird and almost slimy. Not in an uncooked way. Its like the batter they used on it or something was just weird. It had way to much Lemon on it and the artichoke pieces were huge! All you taste was Lemon through out the whole thing and if it was not, it was the huge artichoke pieces....It just not as expected. They do have a pretty extensive menu and maybe a little to much. It was a bit overwhelming to order.  I don't know if I would come back or not. I might give it another shot..."
Ryan L.,"Hutto, TX",1,27,,4.0,5/30/2015,"Pizza is good, calamari is good, burgers great awesome deserts, good service... Avoid the ahi and the house beers were a bit flat last time...overall a good place to eat"
Arlene B.,"Austin, TX",127,18,,5.0,3/2/2016,"I dined at this particular BJ's on two occasions and the service was great. the manager named Shannon and the waiters brian  on feb. 20, 2016 and waiter named brian on 3/2/16 provided exceptional service. the food was served warm , and prompt and the prices were mid range. one can dress casual to dressy and the restaurant is welcoming to family business men or women and couples. there is a wide array of entrée and appetizer selections and the type of food served is American fare with some gluten free items on the menu as well. I love the décor which is modern and they have a full service bar with excellent bartenders.  the host named sam on 3/2/16 was very helpful and was able to answer any questions I had and also entered in my BJs reward card promptly before I sat down .    there is plenty of free parking and it is truly a great place to dine. My hats off to the entire staff at this location of BJs."
Merry B.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,5.0,3/1/2016,"We had a great waiter who was very attentive, and our meals , which were delicious, were served promptly.  I would definitely recommend BJ's for anything from appetizers to pasta to pizza....and pizookies!"
Jabbi R.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",73,13,3,2.0,2/23/2016,"Worst queso dip ever! Tasted like only half cooked cheese. Don't order the Hendricks lime drink tasted like old sour mix. Server took forever to come to the table, then return to check on the drinks. Brussels sprouts side was good."
Hemanth G.,"Austin, TX",1,39,3,3.0,2/25/2014,The food is good but services sucks. The waitress sees a spill on our table but never bothers to offer to clean it up or provide us some napkins. We had to l;iterally ask her. And we asked for a to-go box at the end of our meal and totally forgot about it and when I reminded her about it she did not have the courtesy to apologize.  My favs at BJs are the California club sandwich and the moroccon salmon.
Mai H.,"Austin, TX",34,274,34,4.0,9/16/2011,"Today was my first time there and I was so surprised by the quality of the food..honestly.. I never thought I'd be so impressed by a chain... I loved the small plates menu. Everything under $5. Mozz and tomato salad with balsamic..$2.95, 2 mini tacos, and seared ahi tuna all under $11 dollars. It filled up both me and my friend and we had a variety. Yes, the portion sizes are small but I felt like I got more than enough for what I was paying.  They have some AMAZING Belgian beers! I am from Belgium so I know my beers! They have Westmalle, Kwak, Orval.. all the ones I love. I'd love to try some of their flatbread pizzas and other things. They are super reasonably priced but to be honest I didn't get passed the appetizer portion."
