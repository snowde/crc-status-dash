Jason O.,"Austin, TX",1,16,3,1.0,8/22/2014,"So far I've been to bjs 3 times, the last time only bc we were right there and wanted to sit And relax with some table service. Unfortunately like the previous times, it fell short on both service and quality.  I'll say one good thing before I get to the bad. The staff are well managed, they are regimented and follow a system well that comes off as very professional.    However, the atmosphere is rather pretentious for a sports bar / ale house, and their prices match the air of snobbyness. Tell you what bj's... If you have paper kids menus at your restaurant, you're not that fancy.     Food- items ive had there: pizza, burger, fish tacos, salad. The pizza was terrible. Just a simple plain pizza that came out overly charred, little to no toppings and no flavor. All the other items were average, nothing to write home about. Congrats Bjs, you made a salad, hooray for you.     Beer - they have some decent house brews and a good selection of them, but I can get a dogfish 60 min or an independence ipa for the same price as their homebrew..... If it's made in house, you should be able to bring the price point down, at least on your simpler lower abv beers.      Anyway, I'm done with bj's. The only way i would go back to Bj's is if they gave me one when I walked through the door."
Jason K.,"Jeffersonville, IN",40,121,40,5.0,9/10/2013,"This was one of the best meals I had all year. Seriously, the buffalo chicken flatbread is awesome. The Pazookis were quite possibly the best dessert I've ever had. Beer selection is great. Service was great. Nothing to complain about."
Nancy M.,"Austin, TX",8,65,7,5.0,11/15/2014,"I loved this restaurant. The prices are a little higher then your average sports bar and the atmosphere is a little classier . the food was really good, our waiter was kind and they have a good list of beers (I guess that goes without saying). I will make this one a biweekly staple, very cool."
Bradley S.,"Simpsonville, SC",0,6,1,2.0,9/15/2014,"Food was just...  Meh. Service wasn't great either, and I actually could not have the ""chef's special"" that I ordered (direct from the menu), because they had ""never heard of it"".  Odd choice to have a dedicated page to Chef's specials, that they do not actually have.  Plenty of good food in Austin, skip this one.  Probably explains why there were very few people there."
James F.,"Driftwood, TX",413,721,1794,1.0,6/28/2008,QUICKEST REVIEW EVER: BJ's blows  Fish Tacos = Mrs. Paul's fried fish stick in stale tortilla Yet another reason to eat local!
Sarah M.,"Austin, TX",14,78,33,4.0,10/16/2014,"Busy, busy, busy location.  I've been here a handful of times and the service is moderately fast.  The last time I visited thought the gentleman server was slow and hardly ever check-up, my water glass was empty and had to ask twice to finally get him to refill my water.  The food is good and it's a great place to watch games on TV.  Also, a great place to sit at the bar and enjoy some mixed drinks."
Tony H.,"Austin, TX",81,269,53,4.0,7/31/2012,"Pretty quick, pretty friendly.  Prices, like all BJs are reasonable ($12 to 20 for most meals).  There is SO MUCH selection.  The food is also really good. I haven't had anything that I didnt find good.  I've been to a few different BJ locations and have always been impressed with the food.  I had the steak salad on my most recent trip and the steak was truly impressive!"
Carolyn N.,"Briarcliff, TX",44,159,201,5.0,5/8/2013,"I have consistently had excellent service and food at this BJs location. Love the Sweet Pig deep dish and a Buffalo Bite. Amazing meatloaf too. Great HH 3-7 Mon-Fri offers 1/2 price personal pizzas and $1 off their pints, love their Porter, Stout and Pale Ale. They recently started a Rewards Program and sent emails with news and special offers, worth the effort to sign up"
Matthew T.,"Austin, TX",36,2,,1.0,5/10/2015,Such a bad experience. The waitress was very forget full. Had to ask all the employees to pre bus our table they just let stuff pile up. They brought out our food and literally threw it in the table to were food spilled. Once our meals came out they brought out my ribs burnt to a crisp. When they should of never left the kitchen that burnt. Once they brought out the second rack they did not burn it but did not out any BBQ sauce on it. So when I asked for a side of it they forgot or ignored me. After that they sent out manager that to me was one of the stupidest people I've met to run a restaurant. Had some curtiousy but would not do anything to make this problem we are having any better. If I could give this place a negative score I would so it got the one. I suggest if you do come to this place don't come on a Sunday night because they want nothing to do with you. Also do not order the sunrise splash or firefly spiked Palmer if you actually want alcohol in you drink because there not worth the price. Other then these problem attitude and unprofessionalism the rest of are meals were ok.
Daniel M T.,"Lakeway, TX",0,32,8,3.0,11/30/2013,"I have trouble giving any better a rating because of the customer service.  We love the food but sitting in my favorite location towards the rear of the restaurant assures slow service.  It's like a no mans land back here where servers walk in and out of the kitchen with a blank stare on there faces, doing their best to avoid eye contact.  We finally trapped one with a dollar on the floor... Snagged by the dollar, the lone waitress must wait on me telling us our waitress is busy - obviously she's in another state busy because she's not shown up for the last hour. So back to the food - it's always good, I've never had a bad meal.  The pulled pork sand which, the steaks, the pizza - something for almost everyone."
Robin R.,"Austin, TX",2,50,1,2.0,10/11/2012,"I stopped in here today for the first time because I was craving a burger and P. Terry's grill was  closed. I ordered a classic burger with cheddar cheese  medium. When it arrived, it was a very large burger but it was incredibly greasy . I mean it was dripping with grease.  The burger was under seasoned and though cooked to temperature , It lacked flavor because it was cooked at too low a temperature. The bun held together well but there was not enough sauce on the bun which added to the lack of flavor. The skinny fries were cold. The server served the iced tea with very little ice so she would not have to refill and never offered to refill when it was low. Though they offer some lower priced lunch specials, the burgers  are all 9- 11 dollars. The menu is pretty boring and I will not be returning."
Thomas T.,"Austin, TX",4,30,,4.0,5/4/2014,"BJs has some great brews. Their Jeremiah Red is amazing as well as their Hopstorm IPA and Oasis Amber. Their food on the other hand is just mediocre. I have had their burgers, sandwiches and pasta,  but their pizza is still the only thing I find consistent and enjoyable. The BJs favorite is always great and their half off mini pizzas is a bargain for sure. If you want some great craft beer with some really good pizza BJs is definitely worth checking out."
Brian J.,"Austin, TX",2,3,,1.0,6/9/2012,"Over priced food, drinks. What this restaurant does is trick you with their ambiance into thinking its a really nice eatery but in the end its a upscale chilis or applebees.  Hand craft brew is nothing special. Appetizers can be good.  My girlfriend got the ceaser salad and grilled chicken pasta. Cesar salad was $13.50. Dressing was awful, chicken was bland and she got two croutons.  The alfredo chicken pasta was equally awful and expensive.  7 pieces of brocolli, alfredo sauce was dissapointing, chicken bland. The well liqour drinks were $7.50."
Eric B.,"Oakland, CA",133,225,12,2.0,4/19/2012,"The beers here are okay. The food is not. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was sickeningly sweet. The fries that came with it (you have the option of thick or skinny, I had the skinny) were the best part of the meal, nice and crisp. People around me had pizzas which seemed satisfactory. I can't say this place is better than any Chili's/Applebees/TGIF type of establishment. I wouldn't waste my time if there are better options around."
Shea S.,"Parker, CO",138,462,187,4.0,11/11/2010,"It's not often I give a chain like this such high remarks, but to me it has earned it.  I've been to a couple of BJ's and have really enjoyed it each time. Their beer is actually really good; way better than most of the Rock Bottoms I've been to.  Be sure to get the red, as it may be the best red I've had. The food is also really good, and the menu seems like it's a mile long.  Seriously, the toughest decision you'll have all day is what on earth you're in the mood for.  Pizza? Yeah, there's like five million styles and kinds. Burgers? Yes please.  Seafood? Beer battered of course. Pasta? All kinds. And it goes on and on...to dessert. If you somehow have room, and friendly assistants, get some form of Pizookie. And no, I'm not going to explain what on earth a Pizookie is, but you'll thank me later for getting one. And it gets awesomer. I'm told that whenever there's a game on (any game), it's happy hour (this may be only the Austin location). Good beer, endless food options, and sports on the boob tube.  Why am I at home writing this and not at BJ's?"
Cynthia W.,"Grayslake, IL",8,25,33,4.0,7/7/2010,"Met one of my South Austin web design clients here for an afternoon meeting.  Nice atmosphere, with service that was there when we wanted something, yet unobtrusive when we didn't need anything. We indulged in some potato skins with our drinks. Potato skins! I grew up in a place where these are on every bar or diner menu, and I am just a sucker for them. While not quite as good as the ones I make at home, these were seriously not bad and hit that jones just fine. Since I'm not a beer drinker (I know, I know!), my cocktail was a Pomegranate Sunset, which was new to me. And it rocked. We'll certainly be going back to try some other dishes... and signature cocktails."
Courtney M.,"Austin, TX",160,223,117,4.0,5/11/2012,"Love the ease at which you can grab good take out food from BJ's! Ordered food to go (couple absolutely tasty fiesta salads), and they came to my car in the pouring rain. I like when places will go the extra mile and they certainly did.  Also, I'm a big fan of their Half price wine night!!! Go on a Tuesday and get yourself a bottle of wine!"
George C.,"Austin, TX",1,48,3,3.0,8/24/2014,Waiter was very nice but kitchen was slow. Even my kids grilled cheese took awile. If your looking to hang out at the bar and eat tapas this is probably a cool place
Paul S.,"Austin, TX",209,431,646,5.0,10/29/2013,"5 stars for BJ's brewhouse?  are you kidding me?  well, we left feeling like we got 5 star service when we really needed it. sunday night had me completely worn out.  I'd planned dinner but I was fading fast.  we figured BJ's would be easy, good enough, and please everybody in the family.  it did all that and more. we received excellent service from Wendy and that really set this evening over the top. the wife and I had the dine for $20 deal, two salads, any medium pizza and a dessert.  the kids got one kid's sliders and a crispy jalapeno burger, we had TOO MUCH food.  the wife and I also shared a pitcher of heffe.  the beer tasted fresh like only brewpub beer can.  the burger was much better than expected, and the pizza was pretty good too (we got the hand tossed BJ's perfect pizza).   it was exactly what I needed, when I needed it.   fun fact for the evening:  #1 son asked me, ""WHEN is the food going to be here?"" (it hadn't been that long at all).  Wendy popped her head around the corner and apologized for the wait, said the kitchen got slammed but our food ""would be out in about a minute"".  #1 son takes everything literally, he started counting seconds in his head.  the food arrived and #1 son's jaw dropped, he exclaimed ""she said it would be A MINUTE, and I just counted 59 seconds, and the food is here!""   thanks!"
Aj S.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,4.0,9/25/2015,"For a long time it was our go-to option for a standard, high quality suburban experience. Huge evolving menu. Lots of home brews on tap. It's convenient to shopping, so we were there a lot. A year or two ago, service began to falter here and there, and sometimes it seems like the kitchen might be taking short-cuts that they never used to. No matter though, BJ's is still worth recommending. The tavern style pizzas and any of the pastas are consistently good. The parmesan crusted chicken is the opposite of healthy, but it's delicious. The only thing we gave up on permanently is the fried calamari. Seems like it's always cold or oily."
