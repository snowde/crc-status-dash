Paul J.,"New York, NY",0,4,,2.0,9/18/2014,Good food. Inattentive service though. Had to finally get up and go to the bar to get condiments.
Stephanie R.,"Austin, TX",79,202,134,4.0,4/16/2010,"We tried this place a few times and just couldn't ""love"" it.  I did like their beer so that alone will keep me coming back. Recently we took a trip out with the folks and we ordered a bunch of pizzas.  I was a little sad that the parental units picked BJ's but they were paying...so we went along.   When the table next to us got their pizza delivered to them my interest peaked a bit.  Then I smelled it.  All that hot, ooey, gooey cheese, fresh looking toppings.  They probably thought I staring..but really I was thinking, ""dang people, when is OUR pizza going to be delivered?!""   When it finally got to the table it was DELICIOUS!   My friend at work says to try the Open Faced Meatball sandwich.  Sounds like a Cardiologists dream!"
Kim J.,"Argyle, TX",6,47,,5.0,1/19/2014,"My first time at a BJ's.  Great atmosphere, super friendly staff, helpful with beer and food suggestions and super-fast service. I had a Jeremiah Red Ale and the Seared Ahi Salad for my Sunday lunch.  Both were exactly what I wanted and the salad had a ton of fresh, we'll-prepared ingredients in an awesome vinaigrette dressing.  Scotty, the bartender was my server, and he was outstanding.  Will definitely be back."
Danielle M.,"Austin, TX",5,39,5,3.0,5/27/2014,Like 1000 beers on tap. Food was really good too.  Waitress was a little slow but it was a friday night.
Mara F.,"Austin, TX",381,166,107,3.0,2/24/2010,"I honestly probably SHOULDN'T write a review............. I try and order...OK, I really WANT to order different foods, I have those intentions when we decide to go to BJ's....I tell myself all sorts of things to CONVINCE myself to order something different, but I can't help it. AVOCADO EGG ROLLS scream my name upon entry. So if you are up for that - they are AWESOME, as for anything else on the menu, I don't know. I will work on this."
Jack C.,"Austin, TX",292,244,202,4.0,4/19/2010,I have been to a few BJ's Brewhouse restaurants in different States. I will have to say I have never been disappointed by the service nor the food. It's a chain but if you are looking for variety in your entrees and your libations then I would definitely pay them a visit or two.  Recently I had the pulled pork sandwich and the thin crispy fries. It was delicious. You can also get the sliders with the pulled pork.  They have deep dish pies that are very tasty as well. Give them a shot. You just might like it.
Jeremy T.,"Benton, AR",0,6,1,2.0,6/2/2015,"Had to send my steak back 3 times, still wasn't cooked to order, and they didn't offer to comp anything.  Have had decent luck at other locations but I will not be back here."
Matt G.,"Austin, TX",16,19,2,1.0,3/16/2016,"Do not order delivery from this restaurant through a delivery service.   If you want a meal from BJs, you need to be there to actually be believed if you get the wrong order.  We ordered $100 worth of food, three dishes of which were buffalo wings.  The menu said wet wings but the delivery showed up dry with a puny cup of sauce per order.  Fifteen plus tenders/wings per order with one small sauce cup that covered maybe three wings.  Really?  We didn't have any Frank's wing sauce in the pantry so we tossed the tasteless wings into the garbage and raided the fridge for other food.  When I called the restaurant to complain, a nice young man said sorry, this was unacceptable and then talked to his manager Mr. R.A. to see what they could do.   Mr. R. A. (who was unwilling to talk to me directly BTW) essentially said not his problem, and for me to call Eatoutin.  The folks at Eatoutin were very professional and called the restaurant with my complaint.  Mr. R. A. said he would credit two of the three wings but he ""personally saw"" the third dish wet that went with our delivery.  Are you kidding me!?!  The man lied, all to avoid a credit for a $12 dish??  We had three dry wing orders with virtually no sauce.   I will never go back to BJ's.  Ever! Eatoutin credited me for our third order.  I offered to take pics but the Eaatoutin person said ""no worries"".   BJs customer service and management at the Sunset Valley location is embarrassing and atrocious. Mr. R. A. lost longtime customers forever.  But he saved a $12 credit!  I am guessing from my experience tonight that BJ management is happy with this conclusion."
Amanda N.,"Austin, TX",12,54,2,3.0,1/11/2014,"The atomsphere is nice and they do have really great craft beer, but today I went for the food and it was comparable to Chili's. It wasn't bad, it was just for the price it should have been seasoned better. When I pay that much for food, I don't expect to pick up the salt shaker. You never know though, it could have been an off day and I may go back some day and eat my words. My words will certainly be well seasoned though. ;)"
Jean H.,"Austin, TX",27,1,,1.0,5/25/2011,"Tried it didn't like it staff unfriendly and Intimidating . Tried to order a bud light and was told it would be as expensive as their $7.00 beer! Asked how much a bourbon & coke was -guess what also $7.00! Pizza which they are""famous for""  Waitress couldn't give any suggestions - menu was so dirty  I had a hard time prying the pages apart yet there where 3-4 hostesses up front socializing and ignoring everyone who came thru the door! Manager did walk around awhile when he was in the room employees actually worked! Would I go back? No!"
Claud Byron Y.,"Lenoir, NC",23,20,4,4.0,5/9/2012,"After having driven past this place a few times, and having my curiosity peaked, I looked at their website and found that they have one of my favorite items:  Micro-Brewery selections!   My Wife recommended that we stop by and I was all for it.   When we arrived, we were greeted very politely and professionally and shown to our Table. The setting was very clean, the noise level was very nice for the time we were there (Approx 1pm).   Our Servers name was Lisa and she was such a cutie.  What a wonderful personality and very friendly.  She kidded with us and helped us understand the specials and Beer of the Day selections.  She made us feel very welcome to be there. The food came out fresh, hot and plated well.  My Wife ordered one of the Personal Pizza's and it looked great, and tasted great also.  She enjoyed both the size (Not too big, not too small, Just right!), and the Flavor.  She also had one of the Peach Beverages and she mentioned that it tasted very good.   I ordered the Bacon and Bleu Burger with wedge fries and I couldn't have been happier with it.  The Angus beef was done to my liking and the flavor combination was great.  Sometimes you get a burger like this and they tend to put too much Bleu Cheese on it and it gets overpowered.  This wasn't the case.  It had just the right amount of cheese, and bacon to make it a very enjoyable burger. Again, what made our visit to BJ's so enjoyable was our Server.  Lisa was funny, cute, entertaining and knowledgeable.  Her smile was nice to see, and it was real, not just for our table, but all the time.   When we dine out, whether it is a fast food stop, or a more elegant dining experience, or anything between, it's always a joy and a pleasure to have a positive experience across the board.  For this, we want to thank all the Staff at the Brodie location for showing up with their A-Game and making our visit fun, positive and enjoyable. Thanks LISA!!!  You were/are Awesome!!!!  Hope to have you as our Server again, and again!!!!"
Netters B.,"Austin, TX",26,33,3,1.0,7/1/2013,"I've tried this place several times and there is Always some kind of issue. 2nd to last visit we were sitting at bar and our appetizer went to the wrong table so it was sent back to the kitchen where the kitchen staff ate our appetizer.  Our wait person informed us of this after we asked about it since it had be about 30 minutes since we ordered!  Not what you want to hear! Then my last visit we had the biggest Bitch of a wait person.  It was like she was pissed and annoyed with us?  We asked for a taster of a certain wine- like they do with their beers, and any restaurant will do for you before you purchase a whole glass or bottle.  She had to check with her manager to make sure she could do that for us??  Then, when she brought it to us she barely slowed down to SLAM it down on our table and keep walking!?  We were like did we offend you in some way??  I got the manager who then brought us over another taster of wine like that was the problem?    Now mind you, this is Just a ""Glorified"" Chilli's you are dining at but, that was the last straw.   We will Never be back!!"
Joseph V.,"Austin, TX",16,32,32,5.0,4/10/2014,"Excellent place to eat solo or in a group. Chicken fried steak is awesome most days. Sometimes I can tell an inexp cook is back there, but still isn't bad. Great for business meetings"
Robert J.,"Austin, TX",123,92,16,5.0,10/21/2013,Great service and food. The pork chops with mash potatoes and green beans was awesome. I will be back to sample the beer!
Eryk L.,"Kansas City, MO",154,47,5,5.0,5/16/2012,"The atmosphere is great, and inviting.  We started off with the Avocado rolls.  Fresh and delicious, just don't eat with a fork and knife.  These little critters are better to eat with your hands.   I can't remember exactly what I had but it was to die for, and I almost did from great taste.  A Southern Chicken Steak or something was in front of me.  Breaded chicken on golden mashed potatoes, corn and red peppers on the side.. OMG delicious...  I will SO be back in a heart beat.."
Seon B.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,275,366,4.0,1/12/2014,"I've eaten here a couple times and I liked it both times. The first time was for a business lunch, in which I ordered a turkey burger, which was grilled and came with fries and was a hefty portion size for around $10.The burger was very scrumptious and juicy no complaints here and the fries were hot and crispy. The service was good for a busy lunch rush. The second time was within the last 3 weeks with my family which include twin babies and some friends. I had the Rib-Eye steak which was a very tasty 14 oz steak I had medium well. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The service was good. They had enough space to accommodate my babies . The restaurant was busy and perhaps that contributed to the server forgetting the drink and dessert I ordered. However, I still enjoyed the experience, nothing like good company and good food to compensate for inconsistencies in service! There's a lot of food items on the menu to please most and lots of space to appease all types of occasions. This is in my opinion is an above average chain restaurant with affordable prices and good quality food. BJ's standout in a day in which most chain restaurant have sacrificed quality. When you go please try the Pizookie dessert."
Timothy E.,"Austin, TX",111,18,,4.0,2/20/2014,The atmosphere and food are great. No wait to be seated. Large selection of craft beers. We will be back!
Misty M.,"Buda, TX",3,10,9,4.0,4/19/2015,"We stopped in for the first time today, with the boys, and it was wonderful.   We were seated right away.  There was something on the menu for everyone.  My three year old had mac and cheese, my other son had the chicken tenders.  He actually told me that they were the best chicken tenders he'd ever eaten.  I had a chicken club sandwich with fresh fruit and my hubby had a specialty burger with an authentic green pepper sauce.  Everyone was super pleased with the food.  They didn't make it to five star because they were a little pricey and towards the end of the meal our waiter seemed to disappear and I got to sit with an empty tea glass for five to ten minutes."
David R.,"Austin, TX",11,111,,5.0,7/20/2011,"I really like this place. It is kind of like what would happen if Disney Land did microbrews - pretty commercialized version of something we all love for being different. But they did it right. The food is good, there are big screens with sports everywhere, and the beer is really good. I love the beer sampler. I had the dark one and it was good and fun.  What I really like is it is fun for me as a guy who likes beer, but I can bring the wife and kid. My 3 year old had chicken fingers and french fries shaped like smiley-faces. He enjoyed the lighting and looking at all of the stuff. My wife enjoyed her food and trying some of my beers. This is one of my favorite places if *dad gets to pick dinner."
Leila M.,"Austin, TX",304,175,711,3.0,2/6/2011,"As of now, I've been to BJ's four times. My review is a conglomeration of these four visits. BJs is a glorified ""holier than thou"" Chilis with a lot more real estate, AWESOME BEER AND ALE SELECTION and a sincere attempt of providing good customer service while food quality is diverse but not exactly better for the price.   1) first time visit I went with a friend, Jimmy. Appetizers were good, and the servers and waiters were EXTREMELY kind and professional, VERY hospitable but still managed to mess up my order.  I specifically said ""I Do Not Eat Pork"" and I ordered a wedge salad. The menu doesn't say the Iceberg Wedge Salad comes with bacon - but apparently, people don't understand pork = pig = bacon = ham.  I dismissed this and they probably dismissed it too because I was with a friend. Jimmy is a good friend and a big guy, he ate his salad and mine while I waited for my kosher one. I ended up having my over-cooked steak with bacon on the baked side potato too (which needed to be returned). Sucked but oh well. Like I said - big guy and good hungry friend. And first time there.  BTW - baked potatoes here are HUGE and well piled when you specify what you want on them.  They have an extensive menu of baked potatoes as a whole meal.  Oh, and PS - their Chili is not kosher either (it is pork).    2)  Second visit - came back here with a good group of friends and sat at bar. GREAT service! FULL BAR and an AMAZING selection of beers and ales and you name it.  I was very impressed.     3) Third visit: came to visit with my younger sister, hungry from soccer practice and since this is in my neck of the woods, took her to BJs. We both ordered the Iceberg Wedge Salad - ordered WITH NO BACON. She got a Turkey Burger and I ordered a MEDIUM RARE STEAK with a baked potato and again - with NO bacon.  Guess what happened? Both Wedge Salads had bacon, my baked potato had bacon and someone cooked the fark out of that steak until it was leather.  In all fairness, my sister LOVED her Turkey Burger w/ Avocado.  I tasted her wedge fries while I waited for the steak and salad and they were AWESOME! But management realized they messed up, not once but thrice, so I have to give them credit for comping a good part of the bill and providing a free desert. She left there happy (I don't eat sweets). So we went back....  4) Fourth visit  - went again with my sister this past weekend to give it another shot. She ordered the BJ's Burger with wedge fries and a side Iceberg Salad.  I ordered the Pot Roast Dish with a side Wedge Iceberg Salad.  I specifically told the waiter that WE DO NOT WANT BACON on the salads!! Whargharbl@!@!$  Guess what happened (suspense and drum roll) I actually had a  server other than our waiter put down TWO Iceberg Wedge Salads WITH (wait for it, wait for it....) BACON and say, ""Salads WITHOUT bacon"" in front of us! I was so dumbfounded I couldn't even respond to him. My sister suspected it but I wanted to give BJs the benefit of the doubt. We both laughed out loud!  Sure enough, our salads had bacon on them.  My  guess, miscommunication between kitchen, management, waiters and staff.   I know YOU probably love bacon, but I can't eat it. I just don't dig the pig. And if I request it not be on my salad, baked potato, or whatever, the kitchen should understand this. I've been very nice to this place so far because I really want to like it and I keep coming back. It's close by, the staff is awesome but sometimes they can be moronic, and I really like what they are trying to do - BUT I will NOT support the same mistake done again and again and again.  That is the definition of insanity.  GET IT RIGHT; after THREE  fails with the same client the client will call it quits.  Oh and on the food - again, BJs model is a hybrid between Cheescake Factory and Chilis. Still will return to see if I can Russian Roulette a favorite on their 20+ page menu, but so far, if you mess up a salad, I can't trust you on the main course, just yet.  I'll be back because their food is not too far away but my patience may wear thin if the same issue is repeated."
