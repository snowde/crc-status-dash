Trent Z.,"Austin, TX",64,74,43,4.0,1/8/2012,"This place is great. Admittedly the prices is a little expensive, but they are tasty and they have a large selection of beers and cocktails. Since we do after work happy hour once a month, so I go there pretty regularly. I haven't had any complaints yet. Their Pizookie desserts are delicious!"
Andrew F.,"Austin, TX",8,17,2,5.0,9/30/2011,"My ladyfriend and I really enjoy BJ's. There's lots of jibber-jabber on reviews below about it being crowded, being a chain, but they're doing it wrong.  The time to enjoy a good BJ experience is a Sunday afternoon. Any time there's a sporting event on, they have 1/2 off beers, appetizers and personal pizzas. We have a few beers, some avocado eggrolls, kick-ass pizza with bacon and walk out paying $20. Now THAT'S a deal!"
Christina M.,"Austin, TX",19,40,6,3.0,2/12/2014,That have great happy hour prices for appetizers! I came here with coworkers and we were all able to find something on the menu to suit our taste. They also have a beer sampler where you can try 4 different beers. The service was great as well! Will definitely come again
April F.,"Austin, TX",13,112,20,5.0,7/23/2013,"Bj's will always be close to my heart my entire family love this place and I do too. There is so,etching for everybody and everything is cooked really well. Which is amazing because they do have an extensive menu. I love their beer section as well. I know I know there are tons of ""cooler"" spots in Austin to drink craft beer I'm just saying this place has a good selection as well!"
Anne Marie N.,"Austin, TX",940,68,18,3.0,6/20/2011,"Not at all bad for a chain! Seriously! Maybe it's just my memory of the  beer sampler talking, but I genuinely enjoyed myself here! If you like beer, it is absolutely worth a try, even if you're a big food snob and you never go to chains.They brew their own beer and the samplers are very fun. There is sure to be one you'll want to try and they're generous with their sample sizes too (think cups not shot glasses).  I did actually eat something (ha) and that was nice as well. I ended up going with the Italian Market Salad which was really big and they didn't skimp on the ingredients. I hate when a restaurant serves me a salad and it's mostly iceberg lettuce with one tomato and one olive. Not so here. This is a great and filling salad that tasted really fresh and was covered in delicious olives and fresh mozzarella cheese plus artichokes and other veggies. It was super filling which was a pleasant surprise. Despite all this food and beer there was also room left for dessert so we gave their ""Pizookie"" a try. Stupid as the name is, this thing is freaking tasty. It's basically a freshly baked cookie sitting in a deep dish like a pizza and topped with ice cream. It's deliciously soft. You can't go wrong with this thing. Trust me. All in all this is a satisfying chain restaurant. I'm definitely liking it a lot more than other similar counterparts (Chilis, TGIFriday's etc.) and I'd definitely come back to try a red velvet Pizookie."
Daniel M.,"Austin, TX",0,29,2,4.0,1/30/2012,"My wife and I will go there probably more than any other place if we are just looking to have a night out. Love the TVs they always have sports tuned in and if you sit in the bar area most of the time you can just walk in and sit. They do get very busy in a flash so not always. They also have a reservation number you can call if you want to make sure you have a seat when you arrive. Very polite and accommodating staff.  The last waiter we had seemed nice enough although maybe overwhelmed in the rush that arrived shortly after we did. I only say this because we had to flag him down more than once which I don't like to do...I understand getting busy but never forget about a customer! This is not the norm here but was worth mentioning. I love the selection of beers they have: lights, darks, exotics (or seasonal), They have always been informative when I wanted to try something new, explaining the favor and such.  The food is pretty good overall as well. My personal favorite is the Chicken Alfredo!! So good! This last time I got the Parmesan crusted chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was cooked really good, soft and moist with a lemon sauce that was perfect with it. The potatoes, while real, left something to be desired because they had no flavor...throw something in...cheese, butter, salt, anything. My wife really enjoys the lettuce wraps on their appetizer menu. The artichoke and spinach dip was awesome, a must try. I don't even like spinach and I enjoyed this dish.  The deserts should be world famous if they are not now. The P-zookie, oh wow I love this dessert so much. be warned it is great but very filling and rich. A warm chocolate chunk cookie on a warm pan with vanilla ice cream on top.  I will continue to enjoy this Restaurant and recommend it to others as well! Cleaniness -- 5 stars Staff -- 4 stars Food -- 4 stars Atmosphere -- 4.5 stars Overall -- 4.3 stars"
Carla V.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,4.0,5/14/2015,"Recently placed an online order, which was easy to do.  Requested that all of our burgers be cooked well-done, but all were raw and could not be consumed.  I called for a manager immediately.  To make a long story short, it took 4 calls and 8 days later before I could get this resolved.  The manager replaced 3 of the burgers and again we requested all to be well done.  Out of the 4 we ordered, 3 were cooked correctly and 1 was raw again, which was surprising considering that my husband had to wait 20 minutes after the time our order was to be ready.  But overall, the burgers we did eat were good.  Probably will try a different location in the future."
Eugene L.,"Austin, TX",43,76,6,5.0,5/20/2011,"Negra Modelo on tap. Was I dreaming?  I've always been a fan of BJ's, good food, environment, comfy booths/tables, lots of tv's. I'm very excited for the north location in arbor walk closer to me, hope it doesn't dissappoint."
Charlotte O.,"Bryan, TX",112,13,,5.0,7/15/2013,The moment I walked through the revolving door I was greeted by an essence of happiness and love. I felt as if I was back home in the woods of Virginia. Our server was Wendy. She was beautiful and helped me decide which picture looked the most delicious. I went with the mango Thai chicken salad and it was on my top five salads ever. I've eaten over 500 salads making it a one percenter. #babydolphins (there were no dolphins harmed in the making of this salad)
Beth T.,"Austin, TX",8,5,1,1.0,5/22/2013,Terrible food and rude staff... lame bartender with an additude... was there 3 hours and only served 2 drinks while sitting at bar. I will never return! Way better places in town to bother wasting time at this place!
Pamela P.,"Austin, TX",6,26,18,5.0,12/5/2013,strawberry lemonade is delish! food is always great!  totally worth coming for a good dinner... appetizer recommendation... avocado egg rolls!
Ted S.,"Austin, TX",2,29,,3.0,1/10/2012,"This is a good place to eat ""good"" food.  It's not fancy and some things I find questionable in popularity.  I was told the deep dish pizza was quite good but found it way too doughy.  The avocado eggrolls are really good though and so are the salads.  In my experience eating here, seven out of ten times I have experienced a good quality/value/atmosphere.  The other times not so much....but it's just a chain so my expectations aren't really too high. One thing that I did find really annoying is the policy on call ahead reservations.  My family arrived without reservations one busy evening and I was told that the wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine.  I expect a plus or minus of a bit, but when 30 minutes passed and I asked about our table, I was told that several parties that had called ahead had arrived and our place was taken, (at least four times) by these other parties.  Our wait time was about 50 min.  We never would have stayed had we known our wait time was over half an hour.  I think it best to either have a reservation policy or don't, but don't punish waiting customers by extending their wait times more than double the initial time estimate.  If it wasn't for the starving kid we would have left.  It's a good place but not much more than a 20 minute wait kind of good. The same night we had the long wait was one of the three times that was really poor in terms of both service and food.  It appears as though they can't handle busy.  If they aren't overly busy it's three stars and if are it's one to two stars."
Jen F.,"Dallas, TX",2,27,4,4.0,1/9/2012,"This has to be my favorite chain restaurant ever! Having only been twice before, after an amazing lunch experience yesterday, I can't believe that I forgot how good BJ's is. I had one of their flatbread pizza and salad lunch combos, which was very good and affordable ($7). The salad had a tasty vinaigrette dressing and the club pizza was crisp and perfectly seasoned. Also, the calamari was outstanding, as was my husband's jalapeno burger (which I managed to snag a bite of before it was devoured). Our waitress was incredibly sweet and refilled my sweet tea several times without missing a beat. But the absolute best part of the DAY was the cookies and cream pizookie we had for dessert. To call this thing a ""cookie"" would be a gross understatement. Think the texture of a perfectly cooked brownie, mixed with the taste of a not-too-chocolately cookie fresh from the oven, then add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a hint of cookies & cream, and that still won't do this dessert justice. I definitely recommend BJ's as an easy settlement to the endless ""Where should we go eat"" debate, as their menu easily accommodates a range of taste preferences (and vegetarians). But I would also (will also) swing by on those ""I just need a pick-me-up dessert"" days too.  Don't hold BJ's chain status against it. It really is a wonderful restaurant, by any standards."
Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,4.0,1/31/2011,"I like going to BJ's when the hubby is in the mood for brew.  The food is surprisingly tasty.  I ordered the balsamic chicken recommended by our service.  I was not disappointed.  The hubby ordered fish and chips.  They were a skip it.  I also love their Napa Chicken salad.  Yum.  The cookie desserts are good when I am in the mood, but nothing to die for."
Steen M.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,5/21/2012,"HORRIBLE!!!!!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! The waitress was horrid and rude...We ordered dinner and mine wasnt available...She tells me as shes serving others at my table!  So of course Im not happy...So out of nowhere this other waiter comes over and introduces himself saying hes taking over the table because Bubblehead is leaving...So I say ""Good riddance"".....He tells Bubblehead and she comes to the table all attitude and wants to know why I wasnt happy with her service!!!  Who does that!!! So I complain to the manager and he dosent offer free dessert, money off the bill, NOTHING.................................So needless to say I will never eat there again. Last time we were there before this we had a similar retard for a waitress.  The only difference was she didnt want to fight with me about her shit service."
Megan C.,"Austin, TX",86,274,56,3.0,8/29/2011,"I visited this place with a friend a couple weeks ago on a Friday evening.  I usually don't like most chains and prefer not to spend my money at those establishments.  However, I've heard from a couple people that BJ's is pretty good so I decided to give it a try.  But wait.  BJ's?  What a horrible name for a restaurant!  Yah, because the first thing I think about when I envision great food is a BJ!  Yuck.  I'll try not to hold that against them ;). The interior is pretty classy and comfortable for a chain, I'll give them that.  It's very loud though, doesn't make for a good conversation spot.  We waited about 30-40 minutes for a table.  I saw a waiter handing out free slices of pizza to some of the patrons who were waiting.  Where was MY pizza?!?  I digress.... The waiter informed me that they are known for their craft beers and pizza.  Unlucky for them I don't care about craft beers and I don't like Chicago style pizza.  Ha.  The menu was huge and that usually means that a restaurant can't focus in on one thing and do it superbly so they muck up their menu with eleventy billion random options, which is what it looked like to me.  The chicken fried steak was okay, but I could do better at home.  The mashed potatoes and vegetables that came with it were sorta bland.  The only thing I really liked is the portion size.  I got 2 meals out of my $13 investment on that steak.  I might return here for lunch to give it another shot.  Oh and the drink prices were RIDIC!"
Linz Q.,"Austin, TX",37,215,21,4.0,8/31/2011,"I for one think BJ's is rad. I don't normally have a craving for it, nor is it always my 1st thought. BUT...I do like it. I think the staff is great, the food is delish, and I like the look of the place. The inside is super big and you never feel like you are on top of other tables. The portions are HUGE and there is always left overs for the following day. BJ's is a great place to hang out with friends and grab a drink or just go have grub for a laid back evening.   I have a few dishes I recommend trying b/c the menu can be a bit much if you don't know where to start. Go for the Balsamic Glazed Chicken, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, or any pizza, or Calzone. I say it's worth a try. There is something for everyone to eat here!"
Kevin N.,"Austin, TX",2134,1402,1322,3.0,8/26/2008,"I wasn't eager to retry BJ's, mostly by virtue of the fact that my other experience here was sort of lukewarm at best, but at the behest of a friend, we rolled in here today at lunchtime.  I remarked earlier that there's so much going on at BJ's that they seem to suffer a little from a lack of clarity, and I certainly think that assessment still holds true.  But the thing about hit-or-miss menus and dining experiences is that sometimes they miss. And some times, like this time, they hit.  Kind of. Admittedly I ordered something simple, and it does seem like if you sit closer to the bar (which I did this time) you're likely to get more attention from what turned out to be an eager waiter.  I tried a roast chicken dish that was a) pretty massive and therefore impossible to finish and b) pretty decent, actually. The hefeweizen I paired lunch with worked out fine, thanks, and I do think that some of the home brews here aren't half bad.  It's just putting up with some of the other stuff that can be a little problematic."
chris m.,"Austin, TX",11,41,,5.0,11/6/2011,"We love this place, it is a little expensive but the food is good and the servers are always on the ball.  They have a great selection of micro brews and even their homemade rootbeer is rich and tasty. My wife and I have been coming here for over 3 years, we even planned out wedding here while eating thier wings and avocado eggrolls. We have brought friends and family here and everyone always leaves with a smile on their face. I know it's a chain and we do live in Austin, but some rules have to be broken some of the times.. I really like the fact that when we are there and it is packed, we never feel claustrophobic like in some other places we have visited, I don't want to hear the next tables problems or not feel like I couldn't lean back without bumping someone... The have spaced it out very nicely Great for parties, a chill night out or just watching the game on Sundays"
Terry N.,"Austin, TX",2,22,,2.0,1/25/2011,"I knew i might be in trouble at BJ's when we were handed a menu that was about as thick as the one i once tried to read at the Cheesecake Factory.   Pricing was excessive for for most items.  My hamburger and fries with bacon & cheese was $10.75.  The house beer was $5, while brand name beers were $5.75 each.   The hamburger was ok, but a bit undercooked.  The wedge fries were very good.  i had people stealing wedge fries off my plate.  service was hard to find when you needed it. $5-$5.75 for a beer?  Get real.  i like beer a lot, but unless i'm trapped at Disney, i refuse to patronize any place that charges strip club prices for the same beer that you get everywhere else for $3-4. My family of five, 2 adults and kids (8, 4, & 3) paid $70 with tip to walk out the door for dinner."
