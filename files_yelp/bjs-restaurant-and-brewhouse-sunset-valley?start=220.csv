Pop L.,"Austin, TX",5,83,6,2.0,4/17/2010,"Went here last night. Not impressed for that price. Had parm chicken with white cheddar mask and super dry, bacon-flavored spiral mac n cheese. It was not tasty. Chicken tasted like a fried egg basically but with thicker. The apple dessert was lacking. Sat next to super loud, rambling chics who drank way too much. Only thing I really liked was the 80's music. Our waiter was nice. Won't go back any time soon. Quality is less than Cheesecake Factory but above Chilis."
Tara M.,"Bedford, TX",562,1290,1624,4.0,12/18/2007,"I am already embarrassed writing this review and giving them 4 stars after reading Kevin N. and Allison P.'s reviews.  But, I love that I can ride my bike here drink booze and ride it and the calories off on the way home... This place reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory.  They are trying to do way too many things - they need to focus on one thing and do it right. That said I appreciate that there is another option near my house to meet friends who like to drink beer that also serves decent food and wine.   I have been here a couple of times and have stuck with a glass of Rosemount Shiraz - just an everyday wine nothing spectacular. It pairs well with the Spinach Artichoke Pizza that seems more like an appetizer as it is very rich tasting with a cream cheese blend  - kind of like Spinach Artichoke Dip on Pizza - its good try it... The one item on the menu I might come back for on it's own is the Ginormous Baked Potato filled with Vegetables and topped with cheese.  The menu listed it also topped with Alfredo sauce; but, that just sounded plain gross to me so I asked for a side of salsa to top my potato with and I loved every bite.  There was lots of potato left so I took it home and sauteed it with Rosemary salt and pepper for breakfast the following morning - it did not bring back any great memories but tasted good with my eggs... I am sure I will be back..."
Julia R.,"St Petersburg, FL",34,27,,4.0,1/30/2010,"We're regulars at BJ's mainly because my husband loves a good micro brew. They have a great happy hour of $1 off BJ's beers, $2 off apps, and my favorite $5 mini pizzas. Also don't forget about Tuesday which is $2 BJ's pints until 7pm.  We like to go there for happy hour and sit in the bar area. 4 quality beers and 2 mini pizzas later we can get out of there for $30 with tip. You've got to try the bacon cheese burger pizza, it is delicious! The pizzas are a deep dish style and the crust is light and crispy on the outside while still being tender on the inside so you don't feel like you're eating a huge hunk of dough. I've also enjoyed their fish/shrimp tacos and of course their avocado egg rolls. I don't care for their pasta as much, but I'm Italian so I'm pretty picky about my pastas.  Their seasonal beers are usually pretty good so give those a try and they've got some good year round brews as well. If you're a serious beer snob and those don't hit the spot they still have a great tap selection of Austin/Texas beers and some other micro brew favorites like Sierra Nevada and Stone.  BJ's is a great spot for us. Being on the south side of Austin there aren't as many places to go for the hour of happiness so we love it. The $5 mini pizzas and good beer are what make this place for me."
JAG W.,"Austin, TX",7,33,,5.0,1/4/2011,Their pizza is incredible! I probably won't be going anywhere else for pizza for a while. We got the classic combo and added green bell peppers. The flavors were explosive and fresh!  Also had the crispy calamari for an app and it was also very impressive.
Bekah D.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",4,22,5,3.0,1/24/2013,"Blah food, but decent beer on draft!"
Chris D.,"Austin, TX",43,29,,4.0,1/22/2013,"I don't what to say except consistent and excellent! I have been ordering BJ's through ""Eat Out In"" for some time now and I have tried many of their offerings. The pizza is eh, the burgers are alright but the entree's I've had have been perfect. The Jambalaya is a bit overpriced but better than any ""cajun"" restaurant. The Salmon, steak, ribs and pasta's are great, the cajun pasta is one of the best priced items on the menu imo. All in all, I love the food. The prices are not loveable but you're paying for consistency and not necessarily the absolutely quality one would expect for upwards of $14 meals. I highly recommend trying it!"
Jason G.,"Austin, TX",83,109,,3.0,2/4/2010,"This brewhouse has some really good micro-brews that shockingly aren't actually brewed at this house.  They even have fermenter tanks  whose sole purpose is to fake you out. Also, they have a menu like a novel which is never a good thing, unless of course you enjoy dull, non-fiction novels about food that will make you fat. The atmosphere can be summed up as bricks, TVs and huge. So why do I go here?  There's really not a lot of places to go in this area for a good beer, the food is tasty, and you'll always find parking...don't judge me."
Dan R.,"Austin, TX",0,5,3,5.0,7/17/2013,"This BJ's is brilliant!  The service is always attentive and nonintrusive.  The food is consistently amazing and comes out promptly.  We also like their late hours, the local, self-brewed, and international beer selections, and the daily specials and happy hour."
summer l.,"Austin, TX",8,16,,4.0,8/4/2010,"My family lives on this side of town, which is one of the only reasons I ever end up here. I have taken my parents here many times, with each visit my father likes to ask for a lone star beer (since it's a brewery with a large selection) and each time the waiter kindly laughs at his bad joke.  I have to give props for that! The decor is one of those trying too hard, cheesecake factory inspired vibes, however I love the lighting here! Comfy and dim. The booths are roomy and even with a large party you don't feel squashed.  For the food: I love the avocado egg rolls but I mainly dine off of the smaller portion app menu, because I'm not really there for the food. The one thing I get every time is the DÉJÀ BLEU Martini.   Made with BelveIdere Pure Vodka and a bleu cheese stuffed olive. Strong, cold and a must when dining with family.  By boyfriend loves the beer selection.  It's a chain restaurant so don't go hoping for something fun and Austin. It's full of yuppies, plastic surgery ridden woman and loud sports TVs but there are very few options in the area. The staff is friendly and the wait is rather short."
mya j.,"Portland, OR",2,101,,3.0,1/2/2011,Food was alright. It's a typical apple bees or red robin kind of place with better ambience and service. On new years days this was the only place I could find that didn't have a one hour wait. Parking lot is huge. Portions served are huge. I went with 8 friends and they easily accomodated us which was also a huge plus
Glenn R.,"Austin, TX",83,156,14,3.0,10/20/2012,"Cheap lunch.  Had a half flatbread pizza (Margarita) w/ salad for the under 575 calorie lunch and was somewhat satisfied.  The main reason why it was under 575 calories was because the portions were so small.   Service was fast, which is great for lunch."
Justin G.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,5.0,7/4/2014,Great manager!  Comp'ed us 2 pitchers and an appetizer when a group of us went there after being lay'ed off from local hi-tech company.
Cameron K.,"Austin, TX",102,369,7,4.0,12/23/2009,"I think they should change the name to ""BJ's Brewhouse and Restaurant.""  The pizza isn't bad.  It's not divine, but it's not bad.  But those microbrews are yummy. Get a pitcher, put a straw in it, then let everyone else at the table figure out what they're going to do.  If you're into the stouts and darker brews, definitely check their selection out, they do it right.  Beer as a meal, love it.   Only thing is the location, this is way freaking south for me and everything around it sucks.  There's the Specs on Brodie, this place, and uh, yeah..."
Robert S.,"Washington, DC",28,251,2,2.0,8/11/2010,"The staff here makes me feel really uncomfortable. It's almost as if they were trying to force conversation that was never going to happen anyway. That's fine and such, but sometimes, I just wanna eat! Either way, the interior is like art deco + loft + some other architectural and interior design elements. The amount of food you get is epic levels of ridiculousness. I had the California Burger with fries. My plate was so overloaded, that I could only eat about half of everything and left the rest. The burger was okay. I can think of a few other places I'd rather get one from, but here I was. Ha. The shitheap of ingredients didn't add very much to the burger as far as taste. Either way, with middle of the road pricing, this place isn't half bad."
Chris K.,"Pflugerville, TX",5,18,3,4.0,5/15/2010,"My wife and I LOVE this place! Their brews are absolutely amazing! Something for everyone! Whether you are an avid beer drinker or just out to try something new, this place is for you! With tons of different beers and food to choose from, I always start off with a different appetizer. Sometimes I choose the avacado egg rolls, sometimes I submit to the Santa Fe Rolls... which ever I choose, It is always followed by a signature brew, and usually a Burger or a Turkey Cobb Sandwhich, both of which are very generous sizes both include fries.  Simply amazing, just dont ever forget your wallet! I cant tell you how many Tuesday nights My wife and I go in and if you forget your wallet, you'll be watching your party drink beer, while you enjoy the water. They make NO exceptions. FYI ENJOY!"
O K.,"Hill Country, TX",1,109,2,2.0,6/29/2014,"Sunday 11:13 am. I know for sure because I checked the ticket when I finally got it. 12:19. When we finally got our check and left. Ordered mozzarella sticks, tea, and two sandwiches.  Waiter brought mozzarella sticks but no plates to put them on. Brought my unsweet tea without any sweeteners. Ask for Splenda on next trip by, seemed to forget it then finally brought me 6 packets. However, all the tables around me got the normal container with sweeteners when he brought the tea. Table near to us got  their appetizers and lunches way before us (they were seated way after us), but our waiter let both of the patrons tea get completely empty. Table next to us the waiter forgot their salad.  After we finished our appetizers, we sat and waited, and waited, and waited. I saw our waiter going from terminal to terminal looking at it, but never going into the kitchen and checking our order. Finally food arrives, it was bad, and I ask for the check. The manager comes over and asks how everything was, and I said ""pretty slow today"". He then says they got hit with a lot of people at one time.No, there were hardly any customers there when we arrived.  No, you obviously had a new or incompetent waiter who did not know how/ or had a problem with the order terminal, and instead of coming over and explaining that (which I totally would have understood), you let us just sit there."
Jordana G.,"Austin, TX",54,380,117,3.0,5/12/2010,"BJ's is a good place for a pint and a dinner-sized appetizer during Happy Hour.  Their brews are good (I have to say I've never ordered any drinks except beer at BJ's), and their Happy Hour appetizers are a great deal.  The $5 personal pizzas are enough for a meal and quite good.  The Happy Hour beer prices are excellent, too.  Also, Happy Hour picks back up after 9pm for the late crowd."
A J.,"Austin, TX",22,138,1,3.0,10/27/2009,"To start it off, its hard to take someone seriously when they suggest to go to happy hour at BJs.   There's always an awkward giggle and an inappropriate joke. I've probably been to this location a dozen times or so over the last year, give or take.   Ive also been to BJs in Cali a couple of times over the years. Name aside, I think the place is pretty good.    I usually end up getting the cuban burger with the skinny fries or the pizza.   Both are pretty phenomenal.   The burger could be a little less greesy, but then it would probably suck.   I really like their take on pizza - in fact, Id put it up in the top 5 places in Austin. Their beers are ""OK,"" but its a bit of an expensive place for happy hour.   I think their pints are like 4 bucks each, but thats off the top of my head, so dont quote me on that. The atmosphere is nice... the waiters and waitresses do their job well and it comes across a bit more ""upscale"" than traditional chain brewpub-ish places.   I think its a good thing that this place can stand on its own rather than going the ""hooker"" outfits that many similar style restaurants do in town. Overall, its good.  Not great, but good enough to go back now and again."
Anh P.,"Austin, TX",120,312,1,3.0,6/30/2010,"I am going to rate the beer and the food: Beer: mmmmm I love beer. I like NxNW brewed beer in North Austin. But that's a long drive for me and BJ's is right here. I enjoy the beers. Every beer I have tried has been satisfying to me. I give the beer 4/5 stars.  Food: Food, I give a 3. I've eaten 3-4 times here before and it's alright. Nothing special. Some of the dishes are a little bland for me. It's not bad food. It's not great food. It's decent food. I give it a 3/5. Now if I pair it up with beer, then it's even better. I'd rather drink beer here and eat a small portion then eat a large portion and pair it up with less beer."
April B.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,2.0,8/26/2014,"The service here is lacking and sometimes the food is to.  My husband and I frequent this establishment often because we live so close by.  The wait staff do not check on you once you have your food.  If you want more water or anything, good luck!  Don't order anything that is not on the menu because the cooks can't handle it.  If you alter a dish they will get it wrong.  The location and the atmosphere are great but everything else is a crap shoot!"
