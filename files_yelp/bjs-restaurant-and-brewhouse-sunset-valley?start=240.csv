Rebecca R.,"Austin, TX",4,16,1,1.0,11/21/2012,"I have been to this BJ's at least 10 times before and while the service can be slow, today was ridiculous. Tonight we sat at a table in the bar for more than 10 minutes without being acknowledged, other than someone walking by and setting menus on our table. We got a table in the restaurant to get better service and after a few minutes our waiter stopped by, dropped off some drink napkins and then 5 minutes passed before we ever saw him again. The 5 minutes would not have been too big a deal normally, but already waiting over 10, telling the girls at the hostess stand and still getting less than par service, I stood up, told the manager, who was behind us, what was going on. He replied ""oh.""  We got up and left. Mediocre food a little overpriced is one thing, but mediocre food, overpriced, with bad service is something I won't deal with. I will NEVER go to this restaurant again."
Michael B.,"Austin, TX",367,395,81,2.0,8/9/2009,"Ate here last month and it was still pretty average. in the past, pizzas don't usually have enough toppings or sauce when I have tried them in the past, but I have had a decent one a couple of times. the most recent visit I tried the sliders/mini bugers and they were dry and nasty. Also it took forever to get any condiments. My guess is once the waiter knew we had a coupon, he stopped giving a crap. He was MIA much of the time. Little did he know I ALWAYS take the coupon into consideration when tipping. I was probably TOO generous during this outing. Beer (sampler is a neat concept) is enjoyable here when I am allowed to drink it. Gawd . . . marriage . . ."
Lauren S.,"West Campus, Austin, TX",0,12,5,1.0,4/24/2014,"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER. Upon our first visit there last June, we had a terribly rude waitress, not sure of her name, but she was blonde and oblivious. Our pizookie came out completely raw (I love chewy cookies, but with this one- I'm talking warmed up cookie dough), so we sent it back. She brings us our check and takes the pizookie off of our tab...but not another pizookie like we had asked. I left a note on the receipt saying she had ignored us, and while we were waiting patiently for a pizookie from the to-go area, our waitress COMES UP TO ME like a girl in high school and tells me if I would have just ""confronted"" her, she would have solved the issue. No apology.  Fast forward to April, when we were in the neighborhood, were starving, and my boyfriend just wanted a burger. We go in, sit down, and after 10 minutes of waiting in an EMPTY restaurant, a familiar looking blonde girl comes over and awkwardly asks for our drink orders. We go ahead and order, and I try to be polite and friendly just in case it wasn't the same waitress. Even if it was, I would still have been kind, you know? Well, the next morning my boyfriend is missing his debit card. We call BJ's and the manager insists there are no cards with his name on it. Fishy, since we know for a fact we didn't drop it after coming home. A few days later, mysterious charges appear on his card- at the HEB on South Congress, the Whataburger off of Ben White, and Exxon gas station in the area- come on. If someone were to snatch it from our side of town, they probably would not have been trying to use a stolen debit card SURROUNDING THIS BJ'S. Who it could have been that stole the card there, we don't know. Absolutely AWFUL establishment. We'll be chewing out the manager shortly and writing a report to the company. Next time we're craving burgers, we'll stick to the Wendy's across the street."
Nick J.,"Austin, TX",14,14,6,4.0,1/1/2011,"If you love beer, come to BJs.  They brew a wide selection of their own (not brewed locally) and they're all very tasty.  BJ's offers a typical selection of American food from burgers to jambalaya.  Most portions are fairly large and could easily be portioned into dinner and a lunch. They do have a very small gluten free pizza selection listed on the main menu."
Michelle C.,"Austin, TX",741,636,148,4.0,3/13/2009,"If this restaurant were in central Austin, I would never choose to go, and it would get three stars.  But luckily for BJ's, the other choices in the vicinity (which is where my office happens to be) are very limited, so I've bumped my 3.5 star assessment up to 4. So if you're out south in the Sunset Valley area, and you're looking for a experience that is more or less non-controversial amongst a crowd of average Americans, BJ's isn't half bad.  They have a menu the size of Webster's (unabridged), so there's a little something for everyone.  They have home brew, a terrific selection of other beers (hello, Pyramid Apricot), a full bar, and homemade root beer and cream soda.  They have pizza, and chicken, and salads, and meat loaf, and burgers, and pasta, and stuffed potatoes, and flat panel TV's, and tall ceilings. They have parking. It's overpriced.  You may have to wait a while for a table - and you may have to wait twice as long as they say you will, as we did today when a group of us went for lunch and had to wait 30 minutes when they said 15 (however, they did come out with some free slices of their homemade pizza to appease us, which did help).  Then you may have to wait an inordinately long time for your food (lunch today took two hours, and it was not because we were eating slowly).  Service is basically cheerful, but nothing here seems to happen quickly. Portion sizes are ginormous.  YMMV on the food.  I thought the pizzas were pretty tasty; I tried both the deep dish and a thin-crust, appetizer-sized one.  The parmesan crusted chicken was plentiful, moist and delicious, although I found the white cheddar mashed potatoes that were served with it to be utterly bland.  I've also tasted the meatloaf (yum), the bruschetta (yawn), and the shrimp tacos (actively disappointing - not enough shrimp, and the tortillas were too strongly flavored and too dry to stand up to the shrimp).   Basically, a step up from Bennigan's, with homemade beer.  You probably won't go home and rave about anything that happens here.  But there probably won't be any wringing of hands or gnashing of teeth, either."
Laura F.,"Austin, TX",13,67,40,4.0,6/27/2012,"The happy hour specials are the best reason to go to BJ's.  They have yummy appetizers on sale, such as the avocado rolls or the mini pizzas.   Also, they have a good selection of beers and spirits.  Happy hour is Monday through Friday, and they even have a late-night happy hour as well.  Be sure to sit in the bar area if you want the deals."
Lauren G.,"Austin, TX",107,144,16,4.0,10/9/2009,"I love their beer selection. They have a bunch of home brews, as well as a large selection of other brands. I would avoid their mixed drinks, thats not what they're known for. The food is decent, but nothing exciting. It's comparable to the Cheesecake Factory or Grand Luxe Cafe. Sandwiches, salads, some specialties, and dessert."
Diana N.,"Austin, TX",44,37,3,4.0,9/27/2011,"We came here for the $19.95 Special! You get 2 soups/salad, a medium pizza, and dessert. I really like BJ's Restaurant! The food was excellent and we got full after the soup! We ordered the chili and the clam chowder. Yum!!!! For our pizza we ordered the BBQ Chicken, which was so good you try to stuff your face as much as possible. We could only fit one slice each because we had to save room for dessert. We ordered the new red velvet pizzoke...It was sooooo GOOD!!! We couldn't stop eating it. Our server was a sweetheart and made jokes and actually made us felt like we were welcome! The atmosphere of this place was nice. The portions and price are very reasonable and we will definitely be returning!! The left over pizza fed us for lunch and dinner the next day!! Not bad for a chain restaurant!"
Paul K.,"Austin, TX",2,38,,2.0,6/4/2012,Service is slow. Waiting to be seated is slow. Noting special about the food. I was disappointed with their beers. Tried 3 different ones.
Jeff R.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",1,1,,1.0,10/19/2012,"Service here sucks!  We went in to get a table, they told us it would be 25 minute wait.  Okay that's fine.  40 minuteA later we go inside and ask why we haven't been seated.  Turns out that our pager was broken and instead of calling people over the mic, like they had been doing all night, they decided to just skip us and we were suppose to be seated a while ago!  Then our waitress took forever! Overall terrible service.  I love BJs but I won't ever come back to this one!"
Mindy B.,"Austin, TX",48,45,3,1.0,12/16/2008,"Can somebody explain to me why I keep agreeing to come here? It really is a shame the food is so mildy decent that it holds just enough draw to make me go ""Yeah, I'll give 'em another shot."" Never have I been to BJ's where the waitress hasn't taken at least 10 minutes to bring back our drink order (whether there is alcohol or not). I have also never been asked if I wanted a refill without asking first. The waiters/waitresses seem to think people fall into two categories: those who know exactly what they want when they walk in the door, and those who are such dullards they need AT LEAST 20 minutes to look over the menu to decide what they want. I am also going to recommend to anyone reading this that you DO NOT try the Pumpkin Ale. It might taste like pumpkin, but not the pumpkin pie-y deliciousness you would imagine (and they advertise). Instead it goes over your tongue with almost no effect on your taste buds whatsoever, except for a horrible aftertaste similar to pumpkin pie that has been left out of the fridge.....for a week.  If you're in the mood for dinner to take at least two hours, aren't really that thirsty, know exactly what you want to order when you walk in the door and like being ignored, come on down to BJ's - where the waitstaff hates you, and they aren't afraid to show it."
Pizza H.,"Austin, TX",39,40,,4.0,2/18/2011,"So we were visiting some friends on a trip to San Francisco and the topic turned to pizza as it always does when we are around.  Our buddy hails from the Motor City as well and had relocated to the bay area a few years ago.  As we were openly complaining and comparing stories of fu-fu Cali pizza and the over abundance of NY style or thin pizza's...he mentions to us that BJ's makes a pretty good deep dish that reminded him of Detroit Style pizza a bit.  Our ears perked up and we knew then that we needed to try the restaurant chain that we had never been to before.  (Why would we have really?). Hours later we were sitting in a BJ's Brewhouse watching some football and waiting for this pizza to hit our table.  It arrives and it's clear they took some inspiration from a big national chain that makes a pan pizza.  Upon tasting the pizza though we can say that it's a bit different in terms of taste and texture.   For one they are pretty liberal with their cheese and they like to spread it right up to the pan so you get a bit of that caramelized cheese effect (that's where the Detroit style comes into play here).  Another thing that BJ's does that works is the dough is indeed thick, but it's on the lighter and airy side for a deep dish.  That's a huge plus in our books and kudo's to them for their dough.   The big thick round aluminum (or is it steel?) pans bake these bad boys up really nice in our opinions.   Back to the cheese.  It's a good quality mozzarella blend (I swear I tasted some provolone in the blend too). It's not overly greasy which is good, because the dough from these pizza's are often greasy enough.   Now the sauce is a touchy subject at BJ's.  There typical pie comes topped with diced tomatoes and no red sauce.  We requested a pizza without the tomato's but with their house red sauce.  It's decent, a little on the spicy side, but acceptable.   We scarfed down the medium pie and called it a night after eating one of their cookie desserts. Looking back on our experience at BJ's I feel comfortable stating that these guys are doing a good job at putting out a good pizza in a chain type setting.  We liked the feel of the place, it was comfortable and inviting.  We have been back since we came back to Austin (they had one here, who knew?) and it has been consistently good.   If you are looking for a precious artisan pizza stay away, but if you are after a hearty pie, dig in.  And oh...they just might be the reigning king of chain pizzas."
Brian M.,"Houston, TX",111,416,5,5.0,4/17/2009,"I'll keep it short and sweet. Amazing range of choices on the menu; my choices so far (avocado rolls, sliders, meatloaf, chicken fried steak, fish tacos) have been excellent. I can't drink much anymore, but my dining companions tell me the beers rock. Service was fun and cheerful. A winner!"
Erin P.,"Austin, TX",254,38,,3.0,6/9/2009,"It's like Chili's or Fridays or any of those other ""one step up from fast food"" restaurants, but with the best root beer I've ever had in my life.  I don't really need deep dish pizzas or onion strings or burgers, all I need is a frosty mug of freshly-made HFCS-free root beer and keep it coming."
Michael D.,"Austin, TX",0,16,,5.0,12/7/2011,Looks like a lot of people complained about raising the beer prices for lunch so management compromised. Now it's $3.50/pint of BJs beers. Back to five stars! (Especially for lunch)
Kent R.,"Austin, TX",90,11,7,3.0,1/22/2012,"What can I say, in a place like Austin I ALWAYS feel bad eating at out of town chain restaurants.  However, their beer was surprisingly good, the food was very acceptable and my wife and I had two full nights out with a $100 gift card."
Carol D.,"Austin, TX",0,25,,1.0,4/9/2011,"Went to BJ's for the first time yesterday.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad.  It was, by far, the worst salad I have ever had.  The waitress told me that it was an ample portion but she didn't tell me that all it had was lettuce and a bit of ahi tuna.  I would have been embarrassed to offer a meal like that.   We then ordered dessert.  After 15 minutes, I asked the waitress when it would be arriving.  She said that she would take care of it.  Fifteen minutes later I asked again.  She said she was ""going to put the order in.""  I was dumbfounded. Service bad...food bad... I don't recommend at all."
Freddy T.,"Bastrop, TX",0,10,,5.0,2/10/2012,I love going to BJs. Beer is great and I really like their fish and chips. Place is family friendly too.
Jaye B.,"Austin, TX",264,516,11,3.0,7/17/2008,"It's so weird, I had never read Jessica S. review and I said, ""It's like The Cheesecake Factory if it were a brew pub"" when we walked in. I can't think of a better way to describe it. It's nothing great, and there's a little too much going on in the way of stuff on the walls, too big a menu and just too much. The food was fine. Nothing horrible, nothing outstanding. I did like the shoestring fries, and the lunch special (half a sandwich, fries and a salad) was a lot of food and a decent price (7.95).  I'm pretty sure our waitron was 11, so I'm not sure how she got around those pesky child labor laws. I'd go back if I couldn't decide what or where to eat probably. At least, I would for lunch. Maybe not dinner."
Savanah H.,"Austin, TX",2,29,,4.0,8/13/2011,"I would have preferred to give this place a 3.5 star rating, but I rounded up because they really do brew some decent beers despite being a chain.  The quality of food depends on what you order.  They have a novel for a menu, and it can be difficult to wade through.  I typically order the turkey club or Cobb salad/sandwich, or the piranha nachos (which are annoyingly upside down).  Their pale ale is delicious, and I've generally had really good service.  Also Tuesday happy hour is $2 for their brews. That's hard to beat if you like beer."
