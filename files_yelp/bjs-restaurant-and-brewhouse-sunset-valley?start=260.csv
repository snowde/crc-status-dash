Cheyne M.,"Austin, TX",736,128,5,3.0,8/6/2008,"Not really sure what to say about this one... Please read all the way through... I went in and was seated promptly. My boyfriend and I both sat and the guy who sat us asked what we would like to drink. I chose Sprite ( they have sierra mist) and the guy ordered some sort of berry cider (alcoholic). We were promptly told that the guy who asked for our order was not our waiter and he did not have his TABC certification (Texas required to sell alcohol).... He told us we would have to tell our waiter. He comes back with my and the boys non-alcoholic drinks an we continue to look through the menu. About 25 minutes later we are still sitting there... waiting... waiting... No one comes to get alcohol orders. No one asks anything. My boyfriend went to the host stand and sought out a manager. The manager came back and brought back Evelyn a really nice server. She took our order and everything came out pretty prompty. I think everything tasted well enough. I wasn't impressed like this was the best meal ever, but it was better than more than 90 percent of the chains out there. We also had the giant cookie that was baked in a pan.  When everything was said and done, we were satisfactory, but still saddened about the LONG wait for someone to address or take care of us.... Needless, the manager comped the entire meal. It was above and beyond what was necessary. As a manager myself, I know something free is nice... the entire meal is crazy. Thanks for the meal. We tipped the server on what the meal would have cost, so she made a good chunk of change...  I will try it again to see what I think about a return visit."
Danielle M.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/7/2014,"THE WORST SERVICE OF MY LIFE AT ANY RESTAURANT.  If I could give 0 stars or negative stars I would. Our waiter completely ignored us after our drink order. It took 40 minutes to bring us sweetener for our teas. We got our food 45 minutes after ordering and of course my pizza was wrong. My wife's pasta had a hair in it and it took another 10 min before I was even able to flag someone down. After waiting another 40 min we still didn't have the pasta and asked for our check. My wife and daughter never got their food. The waiter said smuggly ""at least you don't have to pay for your dinner."" Needless to say I was fuming and my wife had to calm me down before we left. WE WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED BY EVERYWHERE PERSON WORKIMG, RECEIVED THE WRONG FOOD, HAD A HAIR IN THE FOOD, AND LEFT HUNGRY!!! Luckily Wendy's was close and they actually know how to give the right order. Freaking horrible horrible horrible. Never will return."
Crystal A.,"Austin, TX",214,226,15,3.0,1/12/2009,"All I can do is agree with everyone else that they try to do a little bit of everything and don't really do any one thing really well. I actually liked the Pumpkin Ale, and so did my boyfriend. Some othere things I like: 1) Fish and chips. Though they aren't awesome, they're good and serve their purpose. We actually came in right after the main kitchen closed but the manager let me order this dish because I came specifically for it. 2) Avocado rolls. These are so yummy! 3) Nutty Brunette or the Blonde. Yes, the wait staff is slow. I don't think I've ever been there and got spectacular service. There is too much going on, and it's usually a little too loud. Once my boyfriend moves out of South Austin, I probably won't make the drive back."
Lynn C.,"Austin, TX",92,25,18,3.0,8/6/2008,"The beer is worthy of another couple of stars, but I'm docking them a bit because the service was poor on our last visit. I may have confused the poor fellow with my When Harry Met Sally Meg Ryan inspired menu choices, asking to go light on the cheese. What I got was a potato drowned in cheese with the chili on the side. It launched some laughter and hysterics from my dinner companions, which was memorable in a good way. I think they confused my potato with my sisters potato (Meg Ryan's sister) who asked for her alfredo sauce on the side. That being said, the potato was really, really good (despite the fact that it was just warm not hot.) Total comfort food. The server brought me some extra hot chili to warm it up and that did the trick. I had some sips of my hubby's beer. Yum. Our waiter was not attentive. He got sidetracked with someone else's ticket confusion and pretty much neglected us. We sat, and sat, and sat waiting for our ticket so we could leave. My husband had to get up and stand at the bar for a good amount of time (the server was hunched over the computer at the bar, oblivious to it all) so he could tell the boy that we were ready to go. He was a little ""checked out,"" I believe."
Melanie L.,"Dorchester, Boston, MA",101,36,1,2.0,6/10/2009,"Being from California makes me put BJ's with the same category as Chili's, TGIF, or Olive Garden. Completely unspecial, but you can always find something tasty. I am a particular fan of the giant stuffed potatoes, pizookies, and their own brewed root beer.  The service at this BJs however makes me give it 2 stars. Everytime we go we are treated with outright rude people. They seem to know they are being rude and just don't care.  No thanks, take me to somewhere local."
Marla C.,"Austin, TX",247,225,273,4.0,6/18/2008,"My first experience with BJ's in Austin was not a pleasant one: About 2 mos. after the restaurant had opened, my man, my kiddo and I decided to go there for an early-ish dinner on a Friday evening. And OMG, y'all! There was a 1 1/2 hour wait, and people packed in the waiting area. Really? You're going to wait an hour for chain restaurant food? Um...okay. I suppose it was initial excitement caused by a new dining option in SW Austin (case in point: the ridiculous wait times at the new Chuy's at MoPac/Wm. Cannon), because the craziness has died down since then.  I've been three times now--all at lunchtime--and have had very good service and tasty, well-prepared food. The menu offers lots of options, but unlike Jessica S., I didn't feel like it was ridiculously overwhelming (like Cheesecake Factory--man, their menu is INSANE), and although I haven't tried their homebrew, I hear it's very good.  My only real complaint? TOO MANY T.V.s all over the place. It's sensory overload city, and detracts from the dining experience.  Usually I'm sort of embarassed to admit enjoying chain restaurants, but I dig B.J.'s Restaurant & Brewhouse and am glad it's moved into my hood."
Charlotte S.,"Austin, TX",12,142,1,3.0,7/17/2008,"I really enjoy their pizzas which is what keeps me coming back. What doesn't keep me coming back is their god awful cocktails. I've ordered a cosmo, martini, margarita and some fruity thing here and every one has tasted so disgusting I've only managed to down 2 or 3 sips before giving up. I don't know if their bartender enjoys sending out shitty drinks to tables just to mess with people or what but I'm tempted to take it back to him and ask him to take a sip and tell me if he thinks it's a satisfactory cocktail. There are so many clashing flavors it's like he just splashed a little bit of everything behind the bar into a glass and called it good.  On the other hand my boyfriend loves their house ale and when we have our ""couple's night"" on Fridays we always eat at old people dinner times like 5:30 so we get seated pretty fast."
Bethany H.,"Austin, TX",0,6,,1.0,1/8/2014,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! I have been to this BJ's multiple times in the past two weeks and I have not once received service that I thought was even moderately acceptable. The last time I was there with three friends, the restaurants was practically empty and we had to ask a hostess if we even had a server because nobody had come to greet us for over 20 minutes. After talking to the hostess we got two servers that were obviously not communicating because there were multiple mix-ups with our orders. My friends and I all either currently work in restaurants or have worked as servers in the past so we understand the difference between terrible service and just being overwhelmed. Until the management fixes this constantly reoccurring problem, I will not be coming back and I will recommend that my friends and family do the same."
Lauren F.,"Austin, TX",239,52,5,4.0,1/18/2009,"I actually really enjoy this place...a little overpriced but their microbrewed beer is tasty!  And last time my husband and I were there, we discovered they have $2 Brews on Tuesdays.  He likes the Jeremiah Red, and I'm a big fan of the Hefeweizen and Nutty Brewnette.   We did their Wheat Beer Dinner at the end of August and had a blast--tons of food, plenty of beer, and a hilarious ""brewmaster""/MC known as ""Mufasa"" because he talks like James Earl Jones.  We already have reservations for the next beer dinner--Winter Warmers on February 3rd! I guess I should talk about the food too--the lunch specials are pretty cheap but it's hard to find something inexpensive at dinner.  Everything we've eaten so far has been pretty decent though."
Jessica S.,"Austin, TX",340,425,20,3.0,5/24/2008,"It's like a brewpub version of The Cheesecake Factory.  (I can't take credit for that one, said I wouldn't). My friend's comparison of BJ's to TCF was a perfect one. It's food that they probably don't make in house, in a big, huge room with lots of big booths.   The menu is huge and overwhelming. Yup, just like TCF that serves lots of beer. There's lots of brew on tap, and you can have a sample if you ask--that's a plus for the indecisives like me! Our waiter started out really good. As the night wore on, though his charm wore off. Once our plates were cleared, he came back to ask us how we were. We said we were good; then he left. No offer for dessert, no offer for the check. Weird. I finally decided on a baked potato. My description: Well, it's a baked potato. I should have known it'd be so plain, but I couldn't decide on much else. The avocado egg roll appetizer was good, the rest of the meal seemed just blah. I may go back for apps and cocktails, but probably not anytime too soon. And they DO know what the initials stand for, don't they?"
Shannon O.,"Austin, TX",33,179,,2.0,3/25/2008,"I knew it was going to be a frustrating experience when the wait staff looked like they were having too much fun hanging out than actually working.   We ordered: drinks, app, 2 dinners with salad. We received: drinks, 2 dinners We didn't receive: app, salad, silverware I was personally impressed by the  busser who delivered our food and then blew off my request for ketchup.  It wouldn't have been so bad if he wasn't actually watching a game and laughing about it 10 feet from my table while ignoring us for 5 minutes. When my husband decided he wasn't going to wait any longer or just  eat dinner with his hands, he got up to find silverware (think 10 minutes).  Of course the manager was all over us at that point when you have a customer poking around a serving station.  I probably wouldn't have been so bothered by it if the servers and bussers weren't camping there socializing and watching the game themselves and couldn't be bothered with a thing like a job. The manager was nice and apologized quite a bit,  and offered us dessert on the house, but after you have already forgotten to deliver half my meal, I don't exactly trust the kitchen. I think my favorite part though was the server who pretty much ignored us after that incident possibly from embarassment, but more likely because the bill was significantly less now and thus her tip would be less as well (20% but out of about 25 bucks instead of about 40-45). The food is okay and I agree its on par with Cheesecake factory but I think they need to clear house on the staff and hire people who need their jobs a little more than the ones they have currently."
Emily P.,"Austin, TX",342,335,133,4.0,7/22/2008,"We order from here for HUGE lunch orders, and I LOVE their salads and sandwiches. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There aren't many people who keep good attitudes when you have them do a 25 person lunch order (everyone ordering sep., no catering!)"
Sarah C.,"Austin, TX",68,106,2,3.0,3/16/2008,"My husband and I tried this place for the first time this past weekend. We were seated promptly but waited a while for our server to greet us. She was helpful once she was at our table and suggested a few drinks and food since it was our first time there. She seemed to be a bit in the weeds that night. I'm not sure if it was because the kitchen was behind or maybe she just had too many tables.  I ordered a pomengranate margarita and it was fantastic. I could have had a pitcher full of them but they were a bit pricey so I resisted. We ordered an appetizer which took about 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen and it was only spinach and artichoke dip. Once we ordered that took an additional 30 minutes for our food to come out. I ordered meatloaf and my husband ate shrimp scampi. Our food was OK, it wasn't anything to write home about but it wasn't something that would keep us away either.  Overall, we will try it again and maybe go during the week when they are less busy. The screens on every wall is a bit annoying because you constantly have your better half staring at the tv. In a way it's almost like being at home."
Julie Z.,"Austin, TX",50,337,179,5.0,2/4/2011,"I love BJ's.  I have tried MANY things on their menu and have loved everything.  I like EVERY ONE of their sandwiches.  Some of my favorites are the roasted turkey cobb sandwich with their thin frieds, the chicken fried steak - not your typical greasy steak!  Another one is their Parmesan crusted chicken.  Most of the ""entrees"" are enough food for two people (with regular appetites lol) and if you are not sharing the same dining taste with others at your table - take it home and it will make fantastic left-overs!  Finish your meal with the famous ""pizookie"".  They are fantastic.  Don't eat all of your meal so you can indulge in this tasty treat.  My favorite - mind you I'm a chocoholic - is the Triple Chocolate Pizookie Made with Ghirardelli.  Fan-freakin'-tastic!  Best cookie, ice cream treat you will ever eat!  My husband has had a few of their beers and said they were full of flavor and very nice.  I have not had the chance to sip on a few, but it is on my to-do list."
John B.,"Dripping Springs, TX",25,173,13,4.0,5/7/2008,"Yes! This is a guy place.  Decor is dark sport bar theme. This place reminds me of the Los Gatos Brewery in the bay area of CA. for the interior not the food.  The menu selection reminds me of Cheese Cake Factory for its variety and quantity (less the advertisements).   The food is very good if you remember that this is a chain and most entree items are not going to be fresh (Frozen).  The formula in the kitchen must be the same as Cheese Cake Factory (CCF).  All items have the similar ingredients and prep as the other menu items. They must have 50 food preps and a handful of chefs working in the kitchen.  Portions are large but not CCF large.  So you can eat it and still order dessert.  Busy and popular since they opened.  Lunch is fast paced and no long waits but if you plan to bring in a large party, reservations are suggested."
Amy B.,"Cedar Park, TX",5,35,,3.0,4/11/2008,"Five star food with one star service, so I'm giving this a three. We really enjoy the food. My husband loves all of their beers (especially the Pumpkin Ale) and we always get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. When we lived in LA, we started going to the one by UCLA. This is back when the chain was a pizza chain. Now their menu is approaching Cheesecake Factory size proportions! It's too much. Stick to pizza. The service is horrible, which is pretty much what others have said. Both times we went, the wait staff was inexcusably bad."
Jennifer H.,"McAllen, TX",55,340,144,4.0,2/16/2011,"Very nice place! Cozy booths work nice dim lighting. The only one problem...well for very indecisive people, they have tons and tons of options. So! Once you have made your choice, go for mini  personalized pizzas ""hint hint"". The appetizers for happy hour are more than plenty to share and definitely delicious. Awesome burgers and the pastas are fine. Must come to enjoy with family and friends place."
Doryan R.,"Austin, TX",412,354,8,3.0,7/29/2008,"Yeah, it's yet another West Coast chain restaurant. Whee!! But, at least they make their own beer. And it's not half bad. I recommend their Nutty Brewnette. Good stuff. Red beer isn't much. Pale Ale is pretty tasty. Eats? Two words Avocado Eggrolls. Eat them. You will be addicted.  Pizzas are okay. Nothing special. Deep dish has that spongy ness to it that Domino's, Uno and other large-scale pizza places use for their Deep Dish.  Thin crust pizzas are better, if I remember correctly.  I agree with Jessica S. Cheesecake Factory that's a pub."
Matthew O.,"Austin, TX",38,166,33,4.0,7/30/2010,Absoluetly AMAZING flatbread pizza! Best in Austin IMO! Great beer aswell! Overall experience... Will be back this weekend!
Sena R.,"Austin, TX",37,18,6,4.0,4/2/2009,"I would give this a 5-rating but sometimes service is a pain.  BJ has really delicious beers which they brew on-site. I'm really glad to see more microbreweries in Austin. Personally, their happy hours are fantastic because they have their early and late happy hours.  I strongly recommend trying their tasty pizzas! I love deep dish and they do it really well.  If they're really busy, sometimes service can get bogged down or they're just unmotivated. Overall, they're all nice."
