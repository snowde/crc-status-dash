Andy R.,"Austin, TX",89,25,24,3.0,8/21/2010,"I went in with a large group for lunch, the place seems to be popular for such things. It's big and airy, with that faux warehouse brew-pub decor perfected back in the 90s. You're not going to find local charm, but you will find the comfortable consistency that is the ultimate goal of strip-mall chains.  This particular location seemed to be well managed, they have the lunch-crowd routine down and handled our large group with ease. I probably will not be frequenting here for HH or to watch games (I tend to prefer local dives), though it seems to be a good spot to occasionally meet your more businesslike colleges for an after-work brew. I had the flat-bread pizza, and it was tasty enough. No one in the group had any complaints about the food quality. The wait staff were efficient enough to be almost invisible (perfect in this type situation) Some in the group were unhappy with the automatic 17% added to the bills for large group, though that has become common practice and probably even cost her a couple of bucks. So I do recommend this place for your suburban office-type gatherings; it's boringly predictable and non-offensive. Though the interesting name is guaranteed to elicit a ""never-gets-old"" ice-breaker joke every time."
Shammi G.,"Temple, TX",0,17,,3.0,10/2/2012,"Great place to eat at!!!... although the last time i went there we didnt get very good service... the waiter took almost 20 to 25 mins to actually realize we was sitting their and needed waited on!... and then after that....still it was like slooww service , the restuarant wasnt busy at all.... BUT overall the food is good and especially the desserts!... would come here again, but hopefully, to go back and get faster service..."
Allison P.,"Austin, TX",464,619,176,2.0,12/10/2007,"BJ's needs to be put on some Ritalin. Seriously, it's all over the place. Huge tv's with several games on, some old-fashioned light fixtures, about a 50 page menu, and it's oh, so loud!  Did you hear that? I SAID IT'S LOUD! I was impressed with the beer selection, which is why I am giving 2 stars. It has the vibe of a giant chain restaurant, which really isn't my taste, but they do carry several beers, many of which are local flavors. (Fireman's 4! Wahoo!) I need to try more items on the menu before I get back to you on the food. Our mozzarella sticks for an appetizer were perfectly fine, but my meatball sandwich was terrible. I rarely say that anything is terrible in a review, so you know it's bad. Also, our waiter was very nice, so that helped a little too. However, our final bill was around $40 and I left feeling a little ripped off."
Chad S.,"West Chester, PA",64,101,27,2.0,12/8/2007,"Experience #1 at BJ's was subpar.  I walked in a little before 10pm on a Thursday night....place like that, I figure the kitchen will still be humming, and I'll be able to get out of there with some takeout pretty quickly.  Mmmmyeeeeaahh. There was a takeout counter right inside the front door, stocked with menus...perfect. Quick glance at the menu, I'm thinking sandwiches are the call - quick and tasty, hard to foul up.  I'm standing there, eyeing the digs....not bad, but definitely with a chain feel. New and clean, so that doesn't hurt...pretty good size bar with plenty of TVs around and one huge screen in the middle. So far, so good. Five minutes later, still standing there, drumming my fingers on the counter, not so good.  I was beginning to wonder if the sign around my neck that said HUNGRY CUSTOMER READY TO GIVE YOU MONEY FOR FOOD was readable. Was I....clean?   Check.  Fully clothed?  Check.  Sober?  Meh...it's a ""brewhouse"", so that shouldn't matter. A little waitress finally wanders over and says...""Do you want to order take out?""  I resist the urge to say the first 10 things that come to mind, and instead reply with an affirmative ""yeah.""  ""Oh, well you can do that at the bar."" Bitch, if you would have told me that 10 minutes ago, I could have been 2 pints deep by now. So, I head over to the bar and sit down right in front of the huge screen to watch a little Thursday night NFL (props for having the network, but I couldn't care less about the Skins-Bears...no fantasy implications, and my season tanked with Larry Johnson anyway).  After a few minutes of watching two bartenders fart around wiping things and whatnot, I stand up, lean forward, and bust out the evil eye.  It worked, and I got the sampler...4 beers, dark to light, all decent, none great, favorite was the pale.  Ordered a couple of sandwiches and the avocado egg rolls.  Mmmmm, avocados deep fried.  No deals. They're out of the avocado egg rolls.  So, I read the blitz and audible at the line to Southwest spring rolls, but the blitz got through and my arse got sacked. I finish the sampler about 10 or 15 minutes later, but still no food.  So, I thrust the pale ale glass at the tender and tell him ""MORE"".  I had already paid, but he understood the unspoken ""you will give me more beer now without charging me, and continue doing so until my food comes, and like it.""  He complied (+1 star). The food finally came out 25 minutes after I placed the order.  Sorry, but I could have gone into the kitchen, figured out where everything was and made two sandwiches myself in less time.  On top of that, both were $9.25, and both were just okay (turkey cobb and blackened chicken)...I was hoping $9.25 would get me a big ass kick ass sanny.  Not the case.  The seasoned wedge fries and southwest egg rolls ($8.25) were totally unmemorable, and in hindsight I really should have audibled to something else, but my mind was set on avocado egg rolls, so I went with the next closest thing. When all was said and done, I was out $40 with tax and tip...kicking myself for not just going home and chewing on some celery with a cold Newcastle.  I'm sure dining in would be a different experience, and granted, it's tough to judge by the limited dip into the menu I took, but BJ's seems pretty overpriced for what you get.  I stopped here based on convenience and curiosity (okay, thirst too), but if I'm going to spend that kind of dough, I'd way rather do it somewhere locally owned with better service, better beer, better food and a better vibe. Lesson learned."
Shawn H.,"Hutto, TX",8,43,,4.0,8/18/2010,"One of the preferred office lunch spots, simply for the unlimited soup and salad. 5 different soup options, 3 different salads, and inexpensive ($7 I think). The atmosphere is good, the beer is very tasty but not something I typically indulge in when i have to head back to the office. They do make their own root beer, and t's pretty tasty, so give it a try! The sliders and pizzas are also pretty tasty."
Peter D.,"Boulder Creek, CA",0,16,,5.0,7/14/2011,"I tend to avoid large corporate chain restaurants, but BJ's is pretty stellar! Besides their own tasty beer selection that's brewed in house (I recommend the Jeremiah Red), they've got a killer guest tap offering  as well. And the menu is seriously no joke- page after page of delicious offerings. Honestly, all the choices can be a little intimidating but the servers are extremely knowledgeable and point you in the right direction. A great spot for any time of day!"
Q J.,"Austin, TX",0,60,,1.0,3/25/2013,"I first visited this place a while ago. I honestly don't recall how things were except that their wedged potatoes were very greasy and salty. Went there for lunch again today with a group of people and I don't think I want to return, even though the French fries on some plates looked much better than the wedged potatoes. Service -- Laughable. Apparently another guy at a different table ordered the same item (half pizza with side salad). The kitchen screwed up and plated the whole pizza on one plate. And apparently the plate was set in front of the guy before the wait stuff realized the mistake and snatched it up again. Anyhow our waiter brought me the plate (with the whole pizza) and told me about the mistake (including the fact that it was rescued from in front of the other customer). He then proceeded to suggest he would half the pizza for us and bring me a side salad later. So as I watched he took the pizza plate to a table, slid half of the pizza onto an empty plate, and then? He brought me back the original pizza plate, half of which was occupied by the half pizza and the other half covered with crumbs and remains of the other half. It looked as if someone has eaten half of the pizza and handed me the leftover! Come on, what kind of restaurant does stuff like this? I understand mistakes happen, but at least he could have taken the pizza back to the kitchen and ask them to divide it and re-plate. I've never had a bizarre experience like this! Food -- I ordered a lunch special, a half roasted vegetable and goat cheese flatbread pizza and a side salad. The pizza barely had any very thinly sliced zucchini and was very lightly sprinkled with tiny bits of goat cheese. They used quite a lot of pesto to compensate for the lack of topping. So basically I got greasy flatbread and pesto. The side salad was as basic as it could get, bunch of wild greens with 2 very sad looking tomato wedges. The guy sitting next to me ordered a regular deep dish pizza, presumable lunch size. When they bought it to him I thought it was a joke. It literally looks like something from a kid's menu, actually smaller than the kid size pizza in many other places. For that one they seemed to use extra oil  soaked into the crust to make it up for the tiny size, so hopefully the guy didn't walk away from his lunch still hungry. Never going back there. There are way too many other better restaurants in this town."
Larry V.,"Austin, TX",30,189,354,3.0,1/17/2008,"My first experience at BJs was early dinner on Thursday evening with four other humans, also there for the first time. The dcor is very interesting, with light and dark wood planks alternating in the floor to create a striped surface, dark wood wall panels and posts, with nostalgic lighting throughout, an impressive bar, plenty of table seating, and huge plasma screens stuck everywhere. It still looks new and clean, which is very nice. There is a carry out area at the end of the bar just inside the front doors, too, which I'll keep in mind for the future. The atmosphere is definitely intended to be ""sports bar,"" but it was pretty nice family dining while we were there. Since it was early dinner, it wasn't crowded at all, and it was actually even pretty quiet. There was music playing quietly in the background, sports events were displayed on some of the TVs, but the sound was not on, and there was even a kid's channel on one TV, which was a good thing, because there were lots of families there, and the children were being entertained by the cartoon program which they couldn't hear. That doesn't really matter, though. Kids have such vivid imaginations they don't have to have sound with their visual stimulants. There were also three or four couples with infants enjoying some time out, maybe for the first time since the baby was born. BJ's has an impressive menu. I don't mean the food. I mean the size of the menu. They have about five or six pages of brews, and about that many more of food items. They offer a vast selection of special beers, some of the names I recognized, but most I didn't. Two in our party ordered beers, and one of them asked for a slice of lemon after tasting the beer, and squeezed the juice into it. I asked how it was, and he said, ""Eh!"" The prices here are all a bit higher than you might expect, but the food portions aren't skimpy. It's probably pricey enough that it isn't a routine stop just for comfort food and a beer. Our food, though, was good. Between us we had four different entrees, the favorite being the deep dish pizza, followed by the California Burger on sourdough, BBQ Chicken Sandwich on whole wheat bread, and the steak sandwich on wheat, each of them with the seasoned wedge fries. We only had one surprise, and that was that the BBQ Chicken sandwich came with a sweet slaw on the sandwich and the BBQ sauce served on the side. Not that it was bad, it was just different, and like I said, a surprise. I'm not sure that I would order it again, but that's just personal tastes.   They do offer a 5"" cookie/two scoops of ice cream dessert, and they offered to make our half and half, so everyone in our party would be treated to the kind of dessert they like. Ours came out in just a few minutes, and the cookie was indeed oatmeal raisin on one side and chocolate chip on the other, and was hot enough it was melting the ice cream. Fortunately, it was served with four spoons, so we were able to enjoy the ice cream while it was still solid enough to eat. The cookie, however, disappeared even before the ice cream did, and it was quite tasty, indeed. All in all, the meals and drinks were under $20 per person, and the service was good. We were seated and served in a timely manner, and our server was friendly and attentive. We'll go back, but it will probably be for lunch or early dinner. I don't think we would enjoy BJs at the time of day some of the other folks have reviewed them. We've already sowed our wild oats, and we have the surgery scars to prove it.   :-)"
G M.,"Austin, TX",2,39,,3.0,4/13/2008,"WoW television screens! This is helpful if you are going there to watch a game. But if you just want to eat, you may want to order take out. It took 5 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the overwhelming stimuli. I wanted to check the odds and place a bet - not a food order. Drink selection rivals the food selection. If you like beer, then the drink selection is BETTER than food selection. They have a decent selection of Imports and I don't mean the South of the Border kind. I had a Hoegaarden. But the glass that accompanied my bottle was kinda crusty so that got side-lined."
Veronica C.,"Austin, TX",4,32,,4.0,4/10/2010,"This is a great versitle resturant. I have been to BJ's for birthday celebrations,with co-workers and for a great  dinner with friends with a fruity beer in had, YES I said fruity beer,not sure what it is but for beer it's pretty good. My usual is red wine or martinis I wld re-order the beer."
mars k.,"Austin, TX",76,64,25,4.0,11/14/2007,"In my opinion, this is a guy place. Who else would name a restaurant BJ's?  Ick. Dark wood, ginormous beer selection (including locals, YAY Live Oak!) about 12 screens displaying mostly sports. I think this is where families will go when Dad gets to pick the restaurant. That being said, they had a very extensive menu, burgers, steaks, seafood, and lots of salads. My husband had grilled salmon, which he enjoyed, my daughter had a $9. angel hair pasta dish with feta cheese and pine nuts, I had the veggie cheese burger with really tasty thick cut fries. Yum. The enormity of the room made it not my cup-of-tea, but my family really liked it, which counts for alot.  Energetic, peppy, wait staff includes adorable looking young men and women who seemed to enjoy grooving around to the oldies music (read - 80's and 90's!)  Back to the beer. My spousal-unit is a foodie and a big beer snob, and he loves to experiment. We saw lots of brands we recognized from a recent trip to Ireland, and I loved the fact that they serve slender ""taster"" sizes. I promptly ordered a berry cider that tasted alot like champagne for about $1.95. I think that's a great way to try something new!   Not where I'd go for a night out with the girls, but I think it's a pretty well done concept."
David A.,"Portland, OR",9,22,2,4.0,1/4/2008,"Take it for what it is.   It's a big noisy all over the place restaurant.    But it's VERY clean, brand new and kinda fun just to peoplewatch.  I went with some friends yesterday.  I enjoyed a glass of their Pale Ale - it had good flavor, was nice and cold and served in a clean glass!  For dinner I had a burger which is pretty much right for this kind of place.  It tasted good, cooked the way I asked for it and the fries were crunchy.   The wait staff was friendly and cheerful.  Nothing fell off of their body into my food...so it was a pleasant change from many Austin restaurants (oh you know you have to laugh thanks to our ""slacker"" culture here).  I'll go back and will invite friends to meet me there for a beer and a burger."
Heidi L.,"Houston, TX",53,195,12,4.0,9/10/2010,"This place has the best deep dish pizza which I find a little odd for a brewhouse. I also enjoy the baked potato, it's so huge! The rest of the food isn't bad, but not worth it due to the price. I also enjoy ordering the unlimited soup and salad for lunch."
Anna M.,"Austin, TX",1,12,4,3.0,3/12/2011,"Service was slow and the place was not very busy.  Even after we asked for more water the waitress went into the kitchen, helped two other people and took an order.  She did tell us the jambalaya was their spiciest dish and still failed to notice the empty water glasses. Food was pretty good but not great for the price."
Shannon L.,"Austin, TX",44,31,10,2.0,1/4/2011,"Well I'm not too big of a fan of microbrews but if you are, you'd probably enjoy the $2 happy hour. The Jeremiah Red was good. However, the service was not top notch. Everyone had to constantly flag down our waiter and it was 50/50 getting his attention. Not the worst but I've had better. I thought the broc cheese soup was decent and the caesar salad was again, a caesar salad, but my friend got the Ahi Poke and mentioned the chef could have used a little more finesse when preparing/plating the tuna. So I should probably give 3 stars because it was okay but I give 2 because I've definitely had better. The service could have been much better and the atmosphere a little less stuffy! Probably won't be back."
Lisa V.,"Saddle River, NJ",3,11,,3.0,2/17/2013,Family friendly restaurant with a varied menu- something for everyone. There was an error in a dish from someone in our party and we were not charged. Service was not exceptional but we were there during a busy period. Will give it another chance the next time we are in town
Christine K.,"Austin, TX",0,13,,1.0,2/2/2013,"When will I learn not to have fish at a place that doesn't specialize in fish?  Ordered the mahi-mahi fish tacos at BJ's last night and spend the better part of the night up sick.  The tacos tasted a little ""off"" but I really couldn't tell for sure as there was any overwhelming onion taste to them.  Or it could have been  the guacamole sauce which was for some reason warm.  Hadn't been there in a long time, and can't say I will be back."
Patrick K.,"Round Rock, TX",0,34,,4.0,4/20/2011,"Man i like this place, I can not wait till the new one opens off mopac . It will be allot closer of a drive ... The food is great a little pricey but worth it . There Beer is RAD . I love the atmosphere .. u have 2 check this place out"
Anne Marie B.,"Austin, TX",26,9,4,2.0,1/11/2008,"This is the first not good review I've written, and I can see that a lot of people have already commented a lot. I just want to add a few things - the tea/soda cost is $2.75.  For a drink - are you kidding!?! I went last week with a bridesmaid's group after a spa day, and it was a total downer from the fabulous morning.  Our waitress was way off of her game, and the only good thing - the wheat/rye rolls we had to ask for repeatedly - they ran out of. I ordered a baked potato with Cajun chicken and Alfredo sauce.  It looked really yummy, but the chicken tasted like it had been pre-cooked and frozen - the overall feel was like a frozen dinner heated up in the microwave.  There was not even a hint of spicy blackening seasoning on the chicken. On decor - blah.  On service - she was very busy, but not at all friendly, so blah, on cost - way overpriced, on food - not good.  I will not be going back to BJs."
Crystal M.,"Puyallup, WA",45,120,18,4.0,8/2/2010,It's a chain I wouldn't mind visiting again. I got the curb side service. I liked the convenience of this service after a long day. My salad was pretty good too.
