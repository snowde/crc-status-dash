Amanda C.,"Lockhart, TX",0,1,,5.0,3/25/2013,"Driving through Austin and someone had suggested this restaurant to me, so I decided to try it. First timer here, so I wasn't sure to expect. The food was pretty good though I had a fantastic waitress that really made the atmosphere of the place. If you ever have her,the name was Danielle and she was extremely helpful. My boyfriend and I were lost in the menu and she had suggested some of the most liked entrees and was on the ball whenever we had a question or needed something. Good food plus great service. Will come here again."
Secret R.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,4.0,3/1/2013,"BJs is a great spot! Well-priced meals, good portions, great quality! Service is always excellent, a big open space makes for a fun ambiance that is casual and comfortable (probably good for kids). Yummy beer (and root beer/cream soda that's brewed there!). Would recommend for anyone."
Andrea H.,"Buda, TX",31,6,,5.0,2/8/2011,"I absolutely love this Place!! We go here quite frequently, as we are always with a lot of friends, and they have so much to choose from on the menu. The food is always exceptional, as are the drinks. We always seem to go on a Friday night with 8+ people and are always seated promptly without much wait, unlike other restaurants. You have to try the beer sampler.  So, If you are looking for a good atmosphere, good food, drinks, and friends, go here."
Samantha B.,"Austin, TX",2,54,,3.0,4/30/2009,"I've been to BJ's twice and they were totally different experiences...sigh... The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend and teenaged son on a Saturday night.  Our server was great.  She brought our drinks and appetizers out very quickly and was overall quite attentive.  My son had the homemade root beer and my boyfriend had the stout beer.  We had the avocado eggrolls and they were really good.  For entrees, my son had the buffalo chicken pizza, I had the barbecue chopped salad, and my boyfriend had the parmesan-crusted chicken.  We all enjoyed our choices.  I tasted a bit of the pizza and I wasn't too impressed, but my son loves anything with buffalo sauce, so there you have it.  For dessert, we had the ""pizookie"", which is a big cookie in a deep dish pizza pan, topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Oh. My. Lord.  I think this might have been one of the best desserts I've ever eaten.  Seriously. It was that good.  Mind you, I'm a big cookie fan, especially warm cookies.  And with ice cream on top???  Heaven.   I think that dessert left me with a sense of ""Wow, this is an awesome restaurant!""   Then I decided to make a return visit.   You wouldn't think a Wednesday night would be a busy night and that it would be hard to get a table, but we waited longer to be seated than we did on our last Saturday visit.  We ordered some potstickers and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  A runner brought them out, but we had no plates, so we both had to lean over the giant table and hover.  I made sure to order our entrees the next time the waiter zoomed by, and it took quite a long time for them to arrive.  My son got the buffalo chicken pizza again and loved it.  He did not receive a plate (again) with his order.  I got the balsamic-glazed chicken this time, and it was actually quite tasty.  As other reviewers have stated, the portions are huge.  Since there were only 2 of us this time, and since my son said he would NOT have room for dessert, we decided against the pizookie, and I'm still regretting that decision.   All in all, quite a mixed bag here.  I think the pizookie is the saving grace for this place, from my sweet-toothed standpoint. :)  Wish I woulda had one on that second visit.   Pros: beers, dessert Cons: service, prices way too high"
Grafton C.,"Austin, TX",0,5,1,4.0,1/6/2011,I love the easy take out and the food is always delicious try the Mac and cheese and the French dip
Cathy A.,"Austin, TX",0,10,,4.0,12/14/2010,I had lunch there today. It was yummy and fast. I had tomato soup and a ham a cheese sandwich it was warm and melty goodness. I have also had this breaded chicken dish with a cream sauce that was wonderful. I think their chicken fried steak is good for a chain. They may be a bit pricey but I always get two meals out of dinner due to the portions.
Kevin M.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,2.0,12/7/2012,"My fiance and I have been there for lunch several dozen times and it has been great most of the time(with the exception of being out of Bloody Mary mix 2 Sunday's in row) well we went there to meet some friends for dinner on 10/27/2012 and everything was great except for the steaks that were ordered by my fiance and a friend of ours. Both were extremely undercooked so they were sent back. When they finally came back they looked to be the seem steaks just taken in the back for 20 minutes, still bloody.Needless to say they ate their salads and called it a night. So as far as the food goes for lunch they have been awesome but for dinner steer clear of the steaks. Stick to a steakhouse."
Elshen B.,"Austin, TX",4,33,,3.0,9/4/2010,"Its alright, nothing too terribly special.  Like a higher priced Applebee's.  Your not getting the best and you know hat when you walk through the door.  Tonight was our second visit, always seems to be about 20 a person for dinner and a soft drink...tonight our wait person was having a bad personal problem that she decided to take out on her customers.  Crap o service from her, but many others came around to ask if we needed anything and to do her job.. Meh you kinda expect thatto happen in a place like this.... fair to middling.."
Kerry G.,"Austin, TX",53,196,3,2.0,4/10/2009,Gag. Chef burned my fish salad. Refired it. Brought out a burned fish salad. Comped it. Two stars for the free salad. Never going back.
Voodoo D.,"Austin, TX",119,29,1,4.0,2/23/2009,"First off, BJ's does a few things really well (the beer list is a perfect example) but it's about one piece of flair away from your average chain. You know, one of those places with the multiple big screens and the gigantic menu? The place you don't want to admit you like? But you secretly like the deep-dish pizza so much you keep going back every single weekend? And you look around and see other people like you also guiltily enjoying the pizza and you give them the little head nod like ""I can't believe I'm eating here!"" and they nod back at you like ""I know! Crazy, right?"" That kind of place? I'm just saying."
Ashley L.,"Austin, TX",3,17,,5.0,8/2/2010,"The first BJs I went to were in Dallas and Sacramento. By the time this location started construction I was already a huge fan, and couldn't wait for it to open up. By now I have come here a countless amount of  times with my family. The service is pretty good, but the restaurant does get pretty loud and crowded at night. The best time to go would be around or after lunch time. Some of their signature items include their beer, deep dish pizza, and Pizookies."
Kelly H.,"Austin, TX",43,96,,2.0,3/5/2009,"it's almost as though B.J.'s is suffering from multiple personality disorder. i have experienced some great visits, some o.k. visits and most recently, a terrible visit.  i went with a large group this past weekend and although they don't take reservations, you can call ahead to be placed on the waiting list. so we called an hour ahead, showed up 10 minutes before we told them we'd arrive and STILL had to wait at least 45 minutes to be seated. we even watched as they seated another large party who arrived after we did. very frustrating!! the waiter took our drink orders immediately, but then it took 10-15 minutes for us to get them--even water. the amount of time it took for us to get our dinner was about right considering there were about 12 of us.  overall, i'd have to say the service that night was definitely lacking and we will probably think twice before returning."
Mindy P.,"Austin, TX",1,11,,1.0,7/2/2012,"The atmosphere was good and the PM porter beer was great. The service by our waiter was wonderful. However, the steak I ordered was not cooked as ordered. The manager brought the food out as the waiter was busy. I told her my steak was not cooked as ordered and that it needed to be cooked more. I like my steak medium-well or lightly pink in the middle. When it came out, it was bleeding on my mashed potatoes. She took the plate back to the kitchen and returned in less than 2 minutes. She started off by saying that the next time we come to Bj's, I should order my steak well done as they go by temperature. She then proceeded to say that the steak temperature was 148 and that is medium well but that she had them put it back on the grill for a minute. The correct temperature for a steak to be medium well is 155-165 per several websites and other cooks that I know. The waiter was appalled and said that he goes by color. There is nothing on the menu the doneness is determined by temperature. I assured that waiter that it was ok as it was not his fault. However, the manager and her attitude sucked. I am not sure that we will ever go back."
Michael G.,"Austin, TX",121,39,27,3.0,1/3/2010,"I use to have to travel to Dallas once a month for my old job. There was a BJ's next to my hotel room in Addison so I would always eat there. The atmosphere was so-so. Can't really blame the restaurant, after all it was  Addison... I came to this location not too long ago and was very happy for one reason, their Jeremiah Red beer. Give me 3 or 4 of these and I'm good. They could bring me a wing and thigh from Allsups and I wouldn't know the difference. The apps for the most part really well and the variety of dinner plates is good. However, I am always weary of a place that serves such a variety. One of those is gonna be bad, and I don't feel that lucky so I stick to the norm. Now back to that beer...."
Chris N.,"Dripping Springs, TX",0,40,,5.0,8/22/2011,"This place is as good as it gets, bar none. All other restraunts should try to replicate what these folks do day after day. Food is always incredible with great variety, the best crafted beer ever( the Red), and exceptional service everytime with no grumpy employees allowed, period. I eat here 3-4 times a week and try not to go anywhere else."
Herr M.,"Buda, TX",0,61,,2.0,10/17/2011,"Burnt hamburger buns, tasteless burger, bleh. Waitress was nice, though twice they brought the another tables food to ours..."
Eva G.,"Austin, TX",0,8,,1.0,2/18/2012,"I was recently extremely disappointed with my first attempt to visit your restaurant. My family came to Austin for the wknd & we hoped to treat them to your spot. I have a 2yr old & imn7 months pregnant so I hoped that arriving at 6 & being told we only had a 20 minute wait would make for a good experience. However, after waiting an hour and watching several large parties get seated before us because they called in, I asked to speak with a manager. His response to our situation was they are trying their best but we still needed to wait for 2 additional large parties to be seated. This is in addition to the hour we already spent waiting. If we were told upon arrival that our wait would have been so long we would've decided against it, but we foolishly waited w an infant & toddler thinking that we would be seated ""soon"". I'm terribly disgusted with this experience & will express my opinion online so other families might save themselves from miserable family evenings at your venue."
melissa c.,"Austin, TX",8,164,1,4.0,7/26/2011,"this is a great place to go for groups of picky eaters. theres something for every taste bud. the happy hour has great selections and the atmosphere is great.  i took a star away for consistency in food. i have been so many times and often order one of my 6 or 7 favorites there, it never fails, they always come out diffrerent than before. like no tomatoes one time, lots of tomatoes the next. or flat bread pizza that comes out burnt, and the next time soggy dough. ive had soup and baked potatoes come out cold. avocado egg rolls spicy, then the next time crazy blow your head off spicy. its just annoying to not have quality control and consistency in their food. i often have to ask to send it back to get it fixed which is just annoying for them and for me. overall i will still go back, but i just cross my fingers that what i order comes out as i expect and as the menu advertises."
Don L.,"Austin, TX",2,38,,4.0,5/27/2011,"When I need a cold beer and decent food, BJs is the ticket.  The service is always excellent (props to Brittany there - she's as good as a waitress can be).  The french dip sandwich is recommended.  The salads are pretty good.  As are the pizzas.  I mean nothing is phenomenal.  But it's all consistently solid, good quality food.  The beer is terrific."
Tarana P.,"Austin, TX",6,26,,4.0,12/9/2008,"There were quiet a few BJ's in back home in Southern Cali that were pretty good, I found this one to be equally good for appetizers and beer. I have only been here a few times mostly for happy hour which is half priced appetizers and drink specials. I would recommend the avocado rolls and spinach dip. Service is good/average but I haven't really been there during the busy times."
