Kristin B.,"Austin, TX",54,183,21,4.0,1/6/2009,"Unfortunately I never went inside the restaurant, but I did order it by delivery.  Their sourdough burger was yummy as hell, and the fries were still hot and fresh when everything arrived.  It was a pleasant surprise for delivery food...and thus probably the best restaurant food I've ever had via delivery.  I don't really have much else to say besides the fact that it was the perfect solution to my burger cravings."
Ernesto M.,"Austin, TX",0,2,1,2.0,4/12/2012,We live in the area and have driven by BJ's multiple times. Today we finally decided to go there for dinner. Nice place.  I ordered one of their pasta dinners and the pasta was pretty raw. The noodles were stuck together and crunchy. They fixed it and brought out a new order after the other people at the table had finished their meal. Then I ordered a second beverage and ten minutes later the server came and said there was trouble with the pump and the beer was coming out too foamy and they had spent the last ten minutes trying to figure out what was wrong.   All I can say is my first experience didn't leavee with a good impression to want to return any time soon.
Debra M.,"Austin, TX",34,3,,2.0,4/3/2010,"First the good points are at the particular time I went the greeter was very nice.  The cashier at the take out register and manager were super nice to me.  I liked the atmosphere.  Bad points:  The food is very generic.  I should have read these reveiws sooner because the fish tacos are in fact a lot like fish sticks in stale tortillas.  I bought nachos for my husband, and he pretty much loves nachos and will eat them from wherever I get them from, even if he doesn't like them so much.  He had a few bites of this and left the rest.  I'll probably never go again."
Joe M.,"Austin, TX",0,33,,3.0,8/23/2009,"First the good: Service was excellent, food was fresh, ice tea was clear & foamy (my #1 indicator that they maintain cleanliness). My wife's root beer was tasty. The restaurant was clean with plenty of big screen TVs. I ordered the Spinach/Artichoke heart individual pizza. It was below average, especially given that BJs features pizza. It was deep dish featuring mainly bread, very doughy. The toppings were finely chopped, not chunks like I would prefer. They were good, there simply wasn't enough. The artichoke hearts were fragments, barely enough to capture the flavor. My House salad was fresh, but was mainly iceberg lettuce (at least I got my fiber for the day!). The Balsamic Vinegarette dressing was tasty.  The bar area had plenty of sports with multiple screens. There were also screens in the dining area, but were mounted a little too high, so this wouldn't be my first choice tor watching a sporting event. Overall Great Service & below average food results in an average rating. Note BJs offers 7 different home brews that looked interesting, but my wif, err I wasn't in the mood for a beer. Cheers, Joe Mac"
Krishelle L.,"Austin, TX",62,185,5,4.0,11/19/2008,"While the food here is fairly mediocre and very greasy, I did manage to find many positives about my two experiences at BJs.  First trip was back last Winter. We had the deep dish pizza and loaded fries. The fries were greasy as expected. The pizza was greasier than expected (although tasty) and also mostly bread, which I do not consider a true deep dish pizza. I like mine with more cheese. The house beers were good, I especially loved the light and bubbly berry cider.  Second trip was just this past weekend to watch the UT football game. We sat at the bar. The picture on the  multipiece big screen was not the best, but it was okay. Service was excellent and drink options were far better than what I am used to while watching UT football. I had a bloody mary and a spiked iced coffee cocktail in addition to the great home brews on tap. The food again was greasy fare that I had expected, but again, better selections than most sports bars.  So overall I give this place 4 stars due to the unique and large variety of drinks, friendly service, and better food options compared to other sports bars. In other words, the bar gets 4 stars. The restaurant probably only deserves a 3 at best"
Thor H.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,3.0,2/17/2010,"High end sports bar, Beers are awesome, try the Rootbeer!  Food is good, and priced moderate to moderately high.  Service was average but felt it was a noisy atmosphere"
Yolanda G.,"Austin, TX",223,273,,4.0,6/17/2008,"I been back to BJ's twice now since I first posted last month, and am still impressed every time. The open face meat loaf sandwich is to die for and the chili cheese open face sandwich is divine. The homemade cream soda is great and the service excellent as always."
D M.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2012,"I had a very bad experience at this location on my birthday 4 years ago, but decided to give it another try.  Turns out, the service is still EXTREMELY SLOW!!  We were there at 2:30, not a busy time.  However, the hostess seated everyone in the bar area.  We later found out it was because there was only ONE waitress for the entire restaurant.  It took 25 min just to bring out the side salads and our pizookie came out burnt!  Needless to say, we will not be wasting our time or money here anymore."
Tiffany Y.,"Columbus, MT",43,146,11,3.0,10/15/2008,"The pizza was great.  Everything else seemed like typically brewhouse faire. The atmosphere is good for a family with teen aged kids. Some of the food is not so good - but again, the pizza worked out."
El b.,"Austin, TX",10,131,98,4.0,2/25/2009,"First I might say, this place has a massive drink menu.  Along with the huge selection of beer, they also have wines and mixed drinks.  I have to be honest, I was quite overwhelmed with the menu and panicked so I missed out on drinks.  The southwest eggrolls were really good and they have a pretty good size food menu too.  I had some chicken dish, that was okay.  I will go again for sure."
Erik B.,"Austin, TX",12,31,,4.0,3/3/2009,"Early on a Sunday afternoon, my 2-top was sat immediately; surprising considering the enormous church crowd.  I loved the fish tacos.  The spinach and artichoke dip was good, too; I liked the 3 different colored chips.  My date ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, but got a dinner portion for some reason.  No problem with that, just more leftovers.  Not this day, but I had been here once before and tried 3 of their mid-range beers.  I'm pretty particular about the type of beer I like, so I will stick with the Jeremiah Red, but all of them are very drinkable.  The service was not the best, but I was not in a hurry."
Mark M.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,3.0,7/17/2011,"I had dinner here tonight with my family, and was quite disappointed with the service. They lost my daughters meal. They gave her plate away to another table. After informing our waiter (who hadn't stopped by until about 10mins later to check on us) that her food was still missing, he went back to find her plate. After putting in another order, we waited another 15mins, and still nothing. By the time we got her plate the rest of us had already finished, and she just wanted to leave, and take hers to go. The waiter was very apologetic, and the manager did compensate us for the troubles by giving us a gift-card. I will say we all enjoyed our food. Hopefully the next trip goes a little smoother!"
Timmy M.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,4.0,6/30/2011,"I only ate the left overs, but the pizza was good."
Slim P.,"Austin, TX",0,19,,5.0,7/26/2008,"The beer is great here, most places don't know how to brew beer...(such as the defunct Copper Tank and Bitter end will attest) The food is good for some Californians, very surprised."
sarah s.,"Austin, TX",80,51,29,5.0,12/17/2007,"Ok, this review is from the experience I had in LA...wow, I was a huge fan there, and even as a ""trojan"" I embarked upon the Bruins territory because I loved it so much, ehem, even with Trojan garb on.  But, I must say, I will have to try it out here before being convinced of the miraculous flavors I experienced. =)"
Nicole P.,"Austin, TX",0,28,2,1.0,6/15/2013,"Not impressed! We had an earlier dining experience here in the year, that was (to say nicely) mediocre. We decided to give this place another try and besides we were only going in for dessert and drinks. My family and I had finished a night of shopping and decided we wanted something sweet to wrap up the evening. First, I must say the bar area was hopping and the dining area pretty empty for 9:30pm. We were seated with only ONE menu and it took the server 5 minutes to even acknowledge us. When he finally graced us with his service we each ordered water and as I began to ask him a question about a sparkling strawberry bar drink he cut me off in mid sentence and said in a frustrated tone ""I'll be back, let me go get your waters!""  He returned another 6 minutes later ONLY to quickly drop the waters and run off before we could even make eye contact much less order anything! As my 6 year old daughter went to take a drink of her water she noticed lip stick on the rim of her glass and realized the glass was too heavy for her to pick up and slightly spilled some water on the table. She looked up at me and said ""Mom, why didn't he give me a kid cup with a lid?"" GREAT question!!! After another 3 minutes we decided we didn't want to give this guy a single cent of our money. From my observation, they pay more attention to their bar patrons than their dining patrons. So we jumped up and went next door where we ended our evening with satisfied bellies and great big smiles! I'm writing a 5 star review for the wonderful place next door right after I hit ""post!"""
Jessica M.,"Austin, TX",3,10,,3.0,5/3/2011,"Their beer is good, the service is adequate, and the food is ok. I had the fish and chips and they were pretty good, but my husband had one of the worst bowls of chili ever. It tasted like ketchup and meat. He tried to add Tabasco to it to make it edible, but it did not help. I will dine here again, but will not ever order the chili."
Chris O.,"Austin, TX",0,3,1,4.0,2/17/2011,"I've found the food to be good. But the Clam Chowder is fresh and excellent. The training area is the room farthest from the bar so be nice to these people, they're all trying hard. I do like they're lunch time personal pizzas, probably more than I should."
Dominca H.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,3.0,1/26/2011,"We like to go here when there is a big group of us because they have such a big range of items on the menu.  The food is average, but what really detracts from the meal are all the televisions everywhere!  Especially if there a guys with you, they seem to stare at the tvs instead of the getting involved with what is going on at the table.  Advice--get rid of the tvs in the dining area!"
Craig S.,"Austin, TX",0,42,,1.0,9/6/2009,WAY way overpriced for the food.  Poor service.  Never ever going back to that place!
