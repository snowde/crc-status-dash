Jane D.,"Austin, TX",0,18,,5.0,3/29/2010,"I love the South Austin BJ's. The varieties of beer taste great, the service is good, the Nachos and Avacado Egg Rolls are very tasty, and the 80s music creates a fun environment. This is a great place to chill out on a Saturday evening. There was a wait one evening when my husband and I visited this location, and they gave us free pizza while we waited! Needless to say, we didn't mind the wait and were very happy to have a couple of  beers when we were seated as well :) The waiters are very helpful with their recommendations if you are unfamiliar with the different beer varieties or menu items."
Scott R.,"Austin, TX",35,14,,4.0,2/12/2010,"Very good chain bar and grill.  The food is definitely not low-fat, low-cal.  The microbrews are very good.  Deep dishes taste kind of like a chain restaurant, but a very good chain restaurant.  Service has always been good.  Very extensive menu.  Love the fact that they serve flights of beer."
Brian F.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,7,,4.0,2/1/2008,"Ok, first of all this is a California chain. That said, I've never had a bad experience at BJ's, whether here or in California. The beer selection is astounding and if you're in the mood for something stronger, the bar makes excellent cocktails. The wine selection is pretty good too. The food is more tailored for a brew pub, filling and delicious. And yes, it has the atmosphere of a ""brew pub"", as it should. Fish tacos are a favorite but everything is always good, if a bit on the heavy side. (That brew pub food.) I find the pizza good but I am not a fan of  ""Chicago"" style pizza with a thick crust. If you want to have a casual meal with good service, atmosphere befitting a brew pup, great food and of course, great beer, this is the place."
f M.,"San Francisco, CA",6,33,,4.0,11/25/2007,"I do like me some BJ's. I grew up in Colorado and they actually deliver in Boulder so I hadn't been to one until recently. I must say it's better to pick it up rather then eat it there. Their to go containers are state of the art and they have the most awesome specials. You could eat there and spend about 40 dollars on beer that is just okay and get a pizza and a salad or get a rotiserie chicken, pizza, and large salad and eat it at home with your own beer without the annoying music blaring. The cobb salad is great with a vinigerette and can be eaten for two meals. Huge salad for 11 dollars you can't get that at Whole Paycheck (Foods)"
Sasa S.,"San Jose, CA",16,85,,3.0,2/6/2008,"whoa. is this place, like, giving out free money? it is ALWAYS packed. we've gone twice and at off times, to get in. one was a sunday night (thanks to all the footballers that stayed home) and another was a sunday afternoon - we sat at the bar but that place is still so packed.  the pizza looks good and i cannot wait to try it. i had the clam chowder one time and i think it is meh. lots of clam, but it has something in there that tastes a bit funny. i've had their homebrew root beer both times and i give a big 2 thumbs up. it is sooo good. but be prepared to drink your $4 worth LOL.  their menu, is huge, just like another yelper said - cheesecake factory menu. a bit pricey, imo but the portions are huge. service has been meh too. the waitress at the bar was extremely unattentive. maybe hang over?  but i do look forward to going back to try their pizza. hopefully the place will die down a bit.. but i suppose this is like the south side's cheesecake factory.. so i can only hope..."
