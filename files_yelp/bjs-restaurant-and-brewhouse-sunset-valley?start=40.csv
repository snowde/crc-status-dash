Stephanie B.,"Austin, TX",0,8,,3.0,7/29/2017,"I really like that there are several good healthy food options to go along with great beer. Server was great and very attentive. However, I don't like Fox News (or any news) on the big screen stuck in my face and on the screen next to it bloody boxing.. ugh! Probably my last visit."
Kristin G.,"Austin, TX",146,83,26,1.0,4/16/2016,"Another bomb. Crazy expensive for terrible flavorless food. Salmon Quinoa was $16 and so flavorless I could not eat it. The blackened salmon was only good where the heavily spiced areas were. And that was a steep $19.  The kids meal was ok, but they forgot our drink. I think this is the last go around with BJs. There are so many places in Austin to choose from, this is pathetic."
Bruce B.,"Austin, TX",4,39,7,2.0,9/8/2016,"Gets 2 stars only because the bar area is so cool and nice. I love the 4 tv's and the bar top is classy looking. That's about all I can say here that's good. Came here a couple months back for lunch and the server charged me the dinner price for the lunch special. When I mentioned it she said she could fix it, I told her not to worry about it because I KNOW that the first preauthorization for the first charge wont go away from my account until 4 or 5 days later which makes that money unavailable to me until then. She insisted that wouldn't happen, so like a dumb dumb I listen to her and she came back with the correct amount but sure enough I now have 2 charges for similar amounts on my card. It is extremely aggravating when I know I'm right and a server insists I am not, and I end up being right. I pull up my account on my phone to politely show her how credit card preauths work, and explained that just because you void a preauth it doesn't make it go away from my account immediately. This is why I wanted to just pay the overpriced incorrect amount because although it sucks to be overcharged, it sucks even more to be charged twice for a period of 5 business days. Then the server explains to me that she has had a rough week because a family member died and that she isn't all there this week. Awkward to tell a stranger. Came here today cuz coworker insisted cuz bday. I ordered fried chicken w gravy and mash. The gravy is not gravy, it's an oily type of sauce with a strong, unpleasant, and indescribable taste which covered everything and left that aftertaste after every bite of chicken and mash. Mash was a GIANT lump of dried mess. I asked server Kyle for some brown gravy to moisten that shit to make it edible (cuz hey I paid for it) but they didn't have brown gravy. I did not want anymore of the oily stuff they call their white gravy. So I just stopped eating all together. Kyle was very well-mannered server but when we tell you we just need an extra minute to decide on the menu don't leave us there for 10 minutes on our lunch break dude. Cmon. Place was empty (late lunch) and he was nowhere to be found most of the meal he spent a lot of time in the kitchen for some reason. Kyle charged my friend $4 for the soup when the menu said $1.50 as an add on for lunch. We showed Kyle and he said ""Sorry I never work lunches."" Kyle I don't think you work at all. Service ain't in your wheelhouse broseph. As I said before, very well-mannered but not a good server. Came here about a year ago as well to watch a ball game and the deep dish pizza was all bread in there, no toppings other than that first layer. Cool bar to have a beer and catch a game but not to eat. Menu looks so freakin good but when you get the plate it just sucks and only decent service I've had is when I sit in the bar section. Too many good places within throwing distance to eat for this kitchen to suck in its execution as much as it does. Doc's has great burgers and beer specials, Tarka Kitchen for some good Indian, and Carino's for some good pasta. Sucks to pay $15 at BJ's and still leave starving. None of that food is sitting well with my stomach either as I type this. Prob the mash cuz it was so dry it had to be old or frozen."
Zac M.,"Austin, TX",0,42,,5.0,7/4/2017,"We went to BJ's on Fathers day and SHARON was our waitress.  I think she said she was in nursing school (which is impressive !!).  Sharon was SUPER nice, patient and helpful as she took our order, took our kids order, got drinks, etc....She also got us our Father day glass (for me) as that is our tradition to come to BJ's each year to get a FATHERS DAY GLASS. (and of course we go to BJ's many other times per year for their pizza!).  Anyway, jumbo pizza (with everything), my wife's pizza and our kids food was QUICKLY made and came out fast.  Sharon was ""on top of things"" and did an excellent job with drink refills, getting us side dishes (honey mustard, extra pizza sauce, etc..).  EXCELLENT service this time.  Even in the past, when we have had problems with service and/or food (which wasnt a huge deal), the manager comp'd us the pizza or comp'd us something on our meal, which was a pretty impressive and kind.  That kind of attention to Customer Service has us coming back again and again (even though the price on the pizzas are a bit high, BUT on Mondays PIZZAS are half off....so I got THAT going for me......"
Maez T.,"Austin, TX",0,13,7,3.0,12/10/2016,"We've had good meals here before, but today the steak was overcooked abd the salmon was bland."
Patsy B.,"Buda, TX",106,4,1,2.0,12/3/2016,"2 stars for the TASTE of the food alone (always delicious and the only reason I keep returning). Service has been crap every time I have come here. Tonight- asked our server three times before getting water. Entrees came out before appetizers- like long before. As in the server forgot to put them in. You could tell by where they were located on the check. We got a different excuse from the food runner and server as to why they didn't come out first. When the bill came - not really to our surprise - we were charged for it all. No manager stopped by to apologize, server didn't even apologize. Got to go boxes for most of entree and all of appetizers so we could high-tail it outta there. Every time we asked the server something, it was like it was immediately forgotten. Poor poor experience tonight. Service recovery is not a term y'all at BJ's know. As a restaurant manager for Hyatt, y'all should be ashamed of what you call service here."
Anna L.,"San Antonio, TX",71,6,4,1.0,8/13/2016,Worst service ever and they weren't even busy. Brian our server came by our table a total of three times. They got my boyfriend's order wrong and my deep dish pene had absolutely no meat in it so when I asked he responded that he didn't know because he didn't make it. This was our first and last time here. Thank you Brian you ruined our date night...
Choi H.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/5/2017,"The visit today is ranked in my bottom 3 worst dining experiences from the beginning to the very end!  Our waiter was the rudest person I've ever had.  He acted like it was an inconvenience (sighed, huffed, and actually rubbed his temples while speaking to my family and me like we were stupid) because I asked him to explain something on the menu!!  Of course he soon realized what he'd done and attempted to fake being polite, but the damage was already done.  I ordered a deep dish pizza and it was delivered to me with raw dough - it looked like they placed the topping on a biscuit and baked it.  The manager comped it and offered dessert as a consolation. Upon receiving my check, I was charged for the dessert (which the waiter removed), and was also overcharged by $8.00 for what should have been the special of the day.  I'm not sure what happened tonight, but I will never come back to this restaurant!  **Manager, if you wish to know who my waiter was, I will be happy to share his name with you.  This young man would definitely benefit from customer service training."
Tiffany P.,"Austin, TX",111,275,242,3.0,2/29/2016,"B.J.'s is a little like an upscale Chili's. They have a large menu with lots of choices for people that may have different tastes, they are kid friendly, have a fun atmosphere, and great service most of the time. They have a nice drink menu and lots of beers on tap, quite a few brewed in house. My parents like coming here and my eight year son likes it too. So I guess you could say there is a wide range of appeal. Sometimes the service is fantastic, sometimes it's just ok, it's never been poor. The food is good but not great, I think the burger is one of the stronger options, but I'm not sure any of the food justifies the price point. The calamari is delicious!"
andy c.,"Austin, TX",6,5,,1.0,5/21/2017,"Me and my family have been going to this location since it opened. Granted it's probably been about 6 months since we've eaten there,but we decided to get some take out tonight. Turns out this was the worst idea ever. The food was a pure disappointment. For starters,unripe avacados were used on my sandwich,this was a chicken club with really oily and greasy bread. The point of a club is to be a healthy option. Saturated fat isn't healthy at all. Then to add the fact they took away the option of wedge or thin fries,to only be replaced by a single fry option(which they were overdone and flavorless) I wanted wedge fries. I'm positive I'm not the only one unhappy with this change. My next complaint is the ""avocado egg rolls"". Egg rolls are supposed to be crispy. At least firm if nothing else. What we got was a soggy,greasy,brown avocado mess. I couldn't even finish the one I started. Then whoever the genius at corporate who decided avocado is going to pair up nice with a sweet soy dipping sauce was dead wrong. We hoped the sauce would help the failed frying attempt. Wrong. It only made it worse. Needless to say,that whole appetizer went straight to the trash. Then my wife's prime rib dip(which is fair sized sandwich) came with a 2 oz to go ramekin of au'jus. What we have normally received with this order in the past was at least 5oz Togo container of dip. The only thing we ordered that came anywhere close to acceptable,was the kids spaghetti(which was still a bit greasy for pasta sauce). But this should be expected to the fact it's pretty hard to mess up spaghetti. Also the kids apple juice was prepared way before our arrival,so all the ice had melted and it was a diluted mess. Luckily the girl at the Togo counter dumped it out and made a new one for us. So in all,I think it's safe for you to assume the conclusion that we won't ever eat there again. Since their obvious recent menu change and apparently a poor decision of a chef/executive chef who can't assure the highest quality food leaves their kitchen,then you can bet we won't."
Andrew M.,"Austin, TX",13,20,11,1.0,7/31/2016,Went into grab a quick bite to eat with my wife and daughter.  Unfortunately it was anything but quick.  The place was almost entirely empty at 5:45 but it still took forever to get any food.  When it finally arrived one entree was missing.  The waiter didn't say a word so I assumed it was coming shortly.  15 minutes later I was finally able to flag down a waiter (not mine)  to go looking for it.   The manager agreed to comp my missing entree and it finally arrived.  Over cooked and looking like dog food.  I eat the edible parts and gave the waiter my credit card so we could get out of there.  When I received the credit slip they had added another entree to the order as well as taken one off.  So the manager had to come by again. At this point I expect something else to come off as a nice gesture but alas.  I guess he figures well never be back anyways.   I've never done this before but I ended up leaving no tip.  I'm sorry but if you deliver food to only two out of three people at a table you should have a bit more of a clue regarding what's going on.  If I'd seen the second waitress that actually did something I'd have tipped her...
Michael H.,"Wimberley, TX",6,50,3,4.0,3/7/2016,"First time visit- excellent experience. Tracy our server was fun, informative, and on point. The apps were out quickly, and they were both delicious (potstickers and mozz sticks). Entrees included the baked ziti casserole which we loved, and the 1/2 rack ribs which were also excellent. Will return - great experience"
Keith B.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,4.0,10/28/2016,Good place to eat. Full bar with a good selection of beers.  The menu had something for everyone and is reasonably priced. A cool place to watch a ballgame and drink some craft beer.
Lindsey D.,"210, TX",151,4,1,5.0,5/11/2016,Nicholas at curbside takeout is always professional and prompt. He goes above and beyond in offering to help with the order. Wonderful service!
Gerardo D.,"Austin, TX",64,265,415,4.0,2/13/2015,"BJs is always a great option for the family because it has very varied, good quality food  and reasonable prices. We have tried the pizza, pasta, salmon, burgers, meats, appetizers and other plates. The food quality and taste goes from pretty good to great with a few awesome s. because of the variety of their menu, everyone gets whatever they wants. The place is nicely decorated and service has always been great. they have a full bar and also accommodate larger groups. BJs has a good selection of beers, with one or two seasonal beers that change every month or two.  For dessert, the pizookies are to die for. Seriously. Make room."
Rita T.,"Austin, TX",0,3,,5.0,9/25/2016,"So many items to choose from, we decided to split the Ravoli and Jambalaya.  Both were good, but the ravioli wins! We cleaned that bowl out! The dessert trio was delicious as well. Next time we are getting 3 monkey breads because we could not get enough of that one.  Christophe was an amazing server! Felt like we had known him for years.  We will definitely go back and we will be asking for Christophe! (We should have asked for his schedule)."
Arick W.,"Austin, TX",66,499,187,4.0,1/13/2015,"For Chicago style deep dish pizza this place is amazing. Everything else is pretty standard upper quality chain style dining. The food is fairly heavy either being deep fried, carb heavy, or doused in cheese and sauce. We never have a craving to come here but when there's a BOGO coupon online it makes this place a very good deal for Italian food. I tried their deep dish lasagna which was basically a deep pan filled with cheese raviolis, sausage, pepperoni, red sauce and cheese. Yes it was delicious but after 5 or 6 bites I was already full. Their wedge salad is also amazing and a great add-on to an entree for only about $3. The service here is great as their whole team of waiters aside from your own are all happy to help you. Oh not a bad place to watch some games either, they have huge screens pretty much all over the place."
Katrina H.,"Dallas, TX",0,13,10,3.0,2/27/2016,We came on a Friday around 8pm and waited about 35 mins. I noticed a lot more children at this location than any other BJ's that I've visited. We were sat but not talked to by the waiter for about 10 mins. Another waiter stopped by to see if our drink order had been taken and then continued to service our table. We received fabulous service from there on out! The BJ Royal Soda was pretty good. Way too sweet to order a 2nd one but it has a decent amount of alcohol.
David B.,"Austin, TX",72,5,,5.0,9/8/2016,"Love coming to this place, usually where I have my dinner on Thursdays. Employees there are always in a good mood. Definitely would recommend."
Lisa B.,"Austin, TX",30,345,,4.0,12/5/2014,"I'm guessing this is a chain, and that's okay.  The interior is HUGE and there's plenty of parking in the shopping plaza, so this is an excellent choice  for a group.  I didn't see anyone wait more than 5 minutes for a table on a busy Friday night.  The food is reasonably priced and similar to what you might find at Applebees.   BJ's has a pretty comprehensive cocktail list as well.  My strawberry lemonade was a little sugary for me, but there's definitely something for everyone.  The appetizer sampler is gigantic and can easily be shared with 4-6 people.  My husband liked his burger, and we were in and out in 45 minutes.  Not bad at all."
