Faith W.,"Austin, TX",26,34,5,2.0,7/23/2015,"Tried this place three times before leaving a review. Really wanted to like it because they have their own beer on tap and (should) have good happy hour specials. After my experience tonight, I'll never go back. All three times I had horrible service. The servers themselves weren't bad, they were just very overloaded. Two servers for an entire bar full of people?! Two times I went during happy hour for the specials and sat in the bar at a table. Both times I didn't receive happy hour prices. Tonight I requested my bill be adjusted and when he brought it back, only two of three items were corrected. Rather than wait another 10 minutes for the server to come back, I just paid and left - feeling ripped off since I'd gone there just for their specials. Why bother have a happy hour if the patron will leave less happy than when they came in?! Pros: Food is decent for a chain. Servers were always pleasant, just way too many tables. Clean environment. Good beer selection. Cons: 20 minutes from the time we sat down to even see a server is ridiculous. The food arrived before my drink order! Plates were never cleared from the table on any of my three visit. Messed up bills on two of my three visits. It shouldn't take 90 minutes for a beer and an appetizer on a Wednesday night. They lost a customer. Too many other places to eat in Austin to patronize a restaurant with bad service that doesn't honor specials."
David N.,"Buda, TX",0,10,,1.0,7/29/2016,Ate hear last week. Oven broken and forced to order a grilled ham and cheese. Took two bites and the third bite I pulled out a piece of wax paper. The kind that are placed between cheese slices. Mgr responded to my find inside the sandwich with a cavalier attitude. He did remove the sandwich from the ticket and I have removed BJs from our rotation. Did I mention that our waitress acted as if we were an imposition? Soooo disappointed in BJs. I used to love this place.  Please seek new management/leadership.
M K P.,"Austin, TX",8,51,4,5.0,7/26/2015,Good food and great beers!  Pizza and salads are delicious. Service is good and they are well managed. Had an issue with my drink and they immediately resolved. I can't think of a bad food or service experience there.  It is casual and family friendly restaurant.
Kara S.,"Austin, TX",2,37,11,3.0,6/3/2016,My mom and I meet here for lunch frequently for their awesome fish and chips. We also love their mozzarella sticks and I'm a big fan of their draft rootbeer but I only give it 3 stars because the service is consistently poor every time we visit.
kevin r.,"Austin, TX",129,22,20,4.0,11/4/2015,"This is a chain restaurant that succeeds where many fail. Which is in creating a casual dining experience pleasing to just about anyone with reasonable expectations. Foodies might find it pedestrian. But, the rest of us can enjoy a mid-week meal here with friends or family. Great craft beer selection. And a varied menu. Spacious dining area with good distance from other tables. Service is decent. Typical entry level wait staff. I dig it. Good for the 'burbs."
Brigette P.,"Spicewood, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/23/2016,"We have gone to several locations including this location. But, after our experience today, we will never return to this location and possibly never return to the chain. We arrived at 12:59pm according to the ticket with our loyalty information on it that was placed on the table when we were seated. We waited for over 15 minutes and nobody came to even take our drink order. I walked over to the hostess stand to let her know and she could care less. She told us that we could sit in a different section. So, we moved to another section.  We sat down and noticed that a couple who were seated after us were greeted by the server and he took their drink order and didn't stop by our table.  At that point it was 1:22pm and still no service. We got up and told the hostess again that nobody came to the table and we wanted the manager and she said they were busy. Well, I told her they just lost our business. And she seemed like she could care less.  So, if I were you, I would avoid this horrible excuse for customer service and eat somewhere that your business is wanted."
Balinor I.,"Austin, TX",160,108,178,3.0,9/7/2015,"it is disappointing to go to a place where there was once great food and good portions.  The food was ok, and they are pulling back on portions.  For example, the Calamari, the manager said it was due to standardizing on weight, and of course I am looking a small order. not worth the price posted on the menu. The manager did give us the Calamari at half price to make up for the portion issue.  The Full Rack of Ribs, well, they use to be good.  It seemed they boil the ribs first, then baste it with Sauce and the placed in the oven until the sauce gets burnt. So I will stay away from the ribs from there, it use to be my favorite dish there.  The service was good, and they know the beer menu well.  The manager on duty was attentive, and made sure we felt comfortable.  My wife had a personal pizza and my daughter had the Cajun Pasta, which was both dishes was good.  Would we go back ?  well, only if we have friends asking us to go... I am sadden that they have gone downhill..."
Jenny E.,"Austin, TX",3,105,4,5.0,10/13/2015,"They never let us down. It's just consistently good food.  My bison burger was served a little pink- as it should be. Many restaurants just can't master ""medium rare"". I had the ahi tuna salad on a visit earlier this week and it was also perfectly cooked.  The waiters switch around during each visit, but they take the time needed at our table before dashing away.  So many restaurants are just disappointing and I get better quality food if I cook it myself. This is an exception- it's worth my hard earned money when we do occasionally eat out."
Courtney S.,"Austin, TX",0,7,2,1.0,7/11/2015,"Terrible service. I came into BJ's on friday around 5pm and sat at the bar. The bartender seen me, cleaned my area, then gave me a coaster. Then he walked away and started chatting with the other people sitting at the bar while refilling their drinks. He never came back to take my drink order. Then shortly after there were two female servers chatting away right next to me. I was not going to stand for horrible service so I just walked out. It was really slow, a lot of servers were on but the service was just terrible. Someone really needs to do something about this."
Deniz V.,"Austin, TX",96,577,274,4.0,3/7/2014,"Really probably a 3.5, but what the hell.  After all, they have beer and pizza, so they've got that going for them, which is nice. This place definitely feels like the Chain restaurant it is, but I will say, I love their buffalo chicken pizza which I've had maybe a half dozen times or so.  It's deep dish, which typically is not my favorite style, but they do a great job with it here.  The dough is really fluffy and soft on the inside and it has a nice lightly crusty exterior to it and tastes very fresh.  The toppings with celery, chicken and buffalo sauce drizzled on top really make it.   The only time I've ventured outside of the buffalo chicken pizza, I think was to get the avocado rolls appetizer which were pretty terrible.  It was basically a wonton wrapper stuffed with unseasoned avocado and then fried.  Overly creamy, and not seasoned or balanced in any way.  Just mushy and warm.    Their beers here are about average in terms of craft beers, but they are all very drinkable, with nothing so crazy that you have to just sip and don't really enjoy slinging back.  I'd definitely get the sampler flight to try them all and see what you like. Service is typically average.  I definitely enjoy the usual here, but can't really speak for anything else on the menu and at a place like this, I'm not really too interested in trying everything out anyway, as it's all pretty ordinary stuff."
Avery C.,"Sunset Valley, TX",0,1,,1.0,12/28/2016,This place is really horrible. Their service takes incredibly long to do anything and the food is subpar. I've given this place many chances to redeem itself but it truly is a bad restaurant as a whole.
Patrick B.,"Austin, TX",2,38,9,5.0,8/17/2015,"I keep missing my favorite server Patrick  I'll have to try this coming week, besides the great wait staff the food is always great seared tuna salad +++"
Pam P.,"Austin, TX",0,4,,1.0,9/17/2015,"I mainly give the restaurant the lowest score for go orders. If you sit and eat- it's a great place. This is the second time that I have ordered carry out and the same girl continues to get the order wrong. Never order to go whether on the phone or in the restaurant. She has screwed it up both times with very simple orders from the menu. I have talked to the manager the first time, and was unimpressed. I even had the girl repeat my order.  Basically, never go there for to go. You and your family will be upset when you get home."
Kay D.,"Charlotte, NC",0,7,3,1.0,9/25/2016,"It's Sunday at noon.  They have a zillion tv's here and yet no audio to ANY of the games.  Why?  Dallas isn't playing.  WHAT?  THEY ONLY PLAY AUDIO FOR COWBOY GAMES per management.  Not everyone is a cowboys fan and some of us just want to LISTEN to games, drink beer and eat food.  I guess I will take my money elsewhere."
Daniela H.,"Austin, TX",49,315,124,4.0,5/25/2015,"Bjs is a good chain restaurant that has a few options that I can eat. I tend to stay with the ol' trusty baked tator and salad (w/ egg) combo. My husband eats some chicken salad thing? The food is in the same realm as Chili's, but much cleaner and better. I generally don't do chain restaurants, but I can't seem to find my combo at any mom and pop Austin place. The staff have always been nice, the place is clean and they have a nice bar too. They are open very late and so I definitely like that! So if I get a hankering for my combo w a tea after shopping at Kohls or DSW, I will definitely be back. :) Oh yeah they have meals that run from $7.95-$12.95 .. also under their ""light"" section it tells you the amount of calories in your meal. Which I really LOVE, because a lot of these chain resturants hide 1000 calories easily in their food."
Adina L.,"Austin, TX",1,44,,2.0,4/16/2016,"The food is actually okay for a chain. The service is pretty bad though. Seated quickly but it was 20 minutes before we got water. When we got our appetizer, we had no utensils. The waiter made it seem like getting utensils would be a big challenge, as he'd have to get them from the hostess. ??? 10 minutes later we finally got utensils and napkins. Every step of the dinner service was slow, and our waiter seemed very distracted though he was polite. Salted caramel pizookie was goooood (when we finally got it)."
Joshua S.,"Manchaca, TX",109,54,2,4.0,5/25/2016,Love BJ's pizza and beer but I've been to others and the pizza has always been superb... Today it was subpar... Maybe just a bad day but I was a little disappointed.
Justin M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,3,,3.0,11/19/2016,"Giving this visit 3 stars only because the food was so good! The service on the other hand was a different story. Our waitress was very unenthusiastic and forgetful. We ordered an appetizer that never made it out, even when we asked another waiter as well. When we let our waitress know she said ""oh sh** I completely forgot, do you want me to take it off the bill?"" We were not compensated for this incident, and not to be too forward, but I believe we should have been. But it's worth a try, hopefully you get a great waiter/waitress to complement the good food!"
Cathy T.,"Bellingham, WA",27,35,3,4.0,3/20/2016,"The food is consistently good, and they have a great selection of beer.  It's not the best restaurant that I've ever been to, but they have something on the menu for everyone."
Jason D.,"Midland, TX",19,91,213,1.0,12/12/2013,I came in with out of town visitors. The waitress was nice. I ordered the regular hamburger with bacon and cheese medium- When it arrived the waitress had accidentally placed the order for a blue cheese burger. I sent back. My business associates were gonna wait for my food but they had to make me a new one so I requested they start without me. When my burger came back it was burnt like BURNT crispy and pieces of the meat were missing. I think it was the same burger wiped off and re-cooked. I took it apart and examined it... I still ate it though. I have felt weird in my stomach since. As far as I know my guests food was ok... But I wouldn't recommend sending food back at this location...  I won't take folks here again.  1 star for the nice waitress.
