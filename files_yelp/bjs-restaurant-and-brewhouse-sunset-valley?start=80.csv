Caitlyn W.,"Tallahassee, FL",39,2,,4.0,10/23/2016,"One of the few chains I enjoy going to, they have a very broad menu, especially lunch!"
Tanner C.,"Austin, TX",4,45,10,3.0,3/29/2014,"I'm sorry to give this place such an awful review. But I just had to be honest with everyone after my last two experiences here. I'll touch on my last experience which was very recent.  I ordered the balsamic chicken for take out, and what I got was a disaster. I got overcooked frozen chicken thrown on a plate with cold and uneatable mashed potatoes. (I don't know how you can mess up mashed potatoes) on the side was three or four pieces of soggy lettuce and some soggy cold onions. Zero ""crispy onion strings"" like it says on the menu. The worst part about it all was the heaping amount of sauce in, on, and around the food.  This was downright the worst $16 I have ever spent, and not my first bad experience with the food here. I'm not one to normally one to heavily criticize restaurants, but beware the food here has been very low quality in my personal experiences. I hope it has been better for others. But I will definitely not be coming back. REVIEW UPDATE: I was politefully contacted by the owner who reached out an apologized. Such a nice gesture that I decided to go back and see if I could have a different experience with this place. I did. I ordered the same dish and got an incredible clean hot and (fully loaded with crispy onion strings) version of the balsamic chicken. I am very pleased, I even have this on our company pick list for our weekly lunches.  Thank you again for the kind reply."
Chris W.,"Sarasota, FL",74,38,2,4.0,5/13/2015,"This is one of my favorite place in South Austin. The food is good, the service is always excellent and the beers are quite tasty. With one of the largest menus in the area there is something for everyone too.  If you're local and go a lot get their loyalty program. It saved us quite a bit over the three years we lived in the area."
Sylvia G.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,3.0,9/18/2016,"I had to flag down a waiter for service. My ice tea came without splenda and my Asian salad came without the dressing.  I kept getting different waiters, but was ignored for the greater part. It takes too long to get your order."
Portia V.,"Austin, TX",0,30,4,2.0,4/9/2017,"I have probably ordered take-out 100 times since moving to Austin, and the food tonight was some of the worst I've ever had in Austin, second only to Pizza Hut. BJs looks like it is trying to be a Cheesecake Factory, but maybe they should spend less money on the decor and more on the food. I got the fish and chips and clam chowder. The fish was clearly frozen fish. To make it worse, it was overcooked, dark brown (despite being called ""blonde"" fish and chips), and greasy. They gave very few fries, and the ones they gave me were limp, soggy, and also greasy. I ordered the clam chowder, which also was clearly not made fresh. The bowl was about the size of a cup. It was thick like paste and had very little clam. My boyfriend had a burger, which was nothing special. Everything was just bad. I guess we should have anticipated it wasn't going to be good when it was ready in just 15 minutes. Save $30 and buy yourself a box of Mrs Paul's and On-Cor Salisbury steaks at the grocery store. It won't taste any worse than BJs. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they have online ordering, and they got the order correct."
Harvey X.,"Austin, TX",1,54,,4.0,5/29/2015,"I've not been disappointed yet by the food -- you know what to expect and B.J.'s meets expectations.  It's tasty and filling, and they serve you a lot of it, so if it's not always the best thing you can eat you can only blame yourself.  The service has always been responsive and polite in my limited experience. What makes me a fan are the craft beers, which are very drinkable at worst and excellent at best.  I've never found a better Irish Red, and that's enough to keep me coming back when I can.   Too many inescapable TVs, though, which is becoming a problem everywhere you go that caters to the hoi polloi."
Mike P.,"Austin, TX",31,62,3,4.0,5/25/2015,"BJ's has a great beer selection, millions of TV's to watch the game, friendly service, and a good menu. My favorites on the menu are the California burger and the deep dish pizzas. I like that you can get your burger cooked at any temperature. Most restaurants don't let you do that. The beers are all good in my opinion. I especially like the porter and red ales.  My only issue is that they do not brew on site, so it's not really a brewery. From what I understand, they brew all their beer at a central location that's not even in Texas. So I don't know why they are perpetratin' on front street with their brew kettles on display, but it's a facade. Other than they, they are an excellent upscale sports bar with great beers."
Jayme B.,"Austin, TX",148,248,188,3.0,10/6/2014,"Eh it was alright. Took forever to get appetizer. It arrived and food arrived 30 seconds later. Literally, not kidding. I got a bacon cheeseburger. It was pink inside, meh my fault for not telling how I wanted it cooked and also waiters fault for not asking. It tasted good nonetheless. Had to ask waiter for most things like a box and our check."
Dan V.,"Austin, TX",23,25,4,4.0,1/2/2015,"Like this place a lot even though its a chain. Fun atmosphere, good service. Food was solid but not Fantastic. Great burgers and fries. Always like there brewed beers."
Aivah A.,"Austin, TX",1,7,2,4.0,5/3/2015,This would be a 5 star review but the bartender brought me pure kahlua when I asked for a mudslide. No chocolate sauce no Irish cream. Noda. Confronted problem and they brought it back exactly the same. So I'm confused.  I ordered the tavern cut pizza with pineapples and jalapeños and it was the bomb and well portion for a personal pizza.
Holly B.,"Austin, TX",0,17,,5.0,5/31/2015,"We just had our wedding dinner here 2 days ago with our ceremony guests, before heading home to a big houseparty. We're super classy individuals like that. In all seriousness, for a party of 19 adults, 1 toddler, and 1 baby, these guys did a phenomenal job. We pre-ordered everything off the family style menu and they had salads and appetizers ready by the time we arrived. Entrees came out in a timely manner. Everyone's glasses stayed full. The serving platter sizes were ample. Can't be mad about that! We love BJs, otherwise we wouldn't have chosen to have our wedding dinner here. Good food. Good beer. Good times :)"
Robert K.,"Austin, TX",90,14,,5.0,3/16/2016,Great food. Ok service we felt a little rushed. We gave it 5 stars because food was great
Roger C.,"Buda, TX",6,74,,3.0,11/25/2014,"I read a review from a friend on FB, showing their awesome burgers, so the Mrs. & I went by to check them out.  The decore is more of a high-end, sports bar, although the TV's (which each featured a different football game on them) are positioned above their windows, so if you don't get a neck ach trying to watch them, it will be close to a miracle.  The waiter/ress staff was good.  I went for it... on the appetizer with their CA inspired peta bread but it didn't live up to the picture on their menu... meaning: the chicken and avocado was not plentiful like their picture. It was also pricey.  The burger which is what I had, was good, comparable to the Outback or Texas Road house. The Mrs. had some sort of salad with some sort of meat... but it wasn't plentiful either. Again, not quiet what you would expect at another place.   Yes, I would try this place again, just to make sure my first impression, wasn't a first wrong impression type thing, but I will not be running down there anytime soon to give it a second chance."
John K.,"Austin, TX",1,63,20,1.0,7/28/2014,"Really bad service, decent food good beer selection Kid's spagetty arrived without souce. I asked for it and after 15 mins still no sauce"
Nicole V.,"Austin, TX",107,17,1,2.0,10/7/2015,"My boyfriend and I have been here around 6 times. The food here is amazing every time. My boyfriend always tries something different! I, however, always go for the soup/salad combo, with my soup being in a bread bowl. The first time I ordered it, they brought out my salad with my soup, about 10-15 minutes before my boyfriends entree. Even though I made it clear the soup was my entree. I asked 2 questions, (politely) 1. Why did my salad come out with my soup? And 2. Why did my entree come out before my boyfriends? The server apologized and said it was a mistake. I waited until my boyfriend got his food and then ate (amazing food of course)  The last time I got this soup/salad combo, last Sunday night (oct. 4th) the same thing happened. Maybe it's just their thing to send out one persons entree before the other, and with an appetizer ( the salad) however, since the first time my server told me it was a mistake, I kindly told the food runner "" oh I didn't know they would come out at the same time, I thought the salad would come out first!"" And the food runner was very snotty and said "" THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT TOGETHER!!!!!!!!!"" And sped off. Such a jerk. Again, I waited to eat my food until my boyfriend got his. The server heard me talking about the situation and understood why I was confused and said he didn't know why the establishment did things that way. I honestly have never seen another place that doesn't 1. Serve the salad first and 2. Serve all the entrees together......although the server was nice, it took 10 minutes to get greeted, another 5 for drinks, and a very long time to get the bill. Service is always very crappy, every single time we have gone. In short, while the food is here always amazing, the service needs major improvement. Hostesses don't smile, look bored and like they hate their jobs. Servers are very inattentive and I often see them standing around chatting and flirting with each other. Food runners are rude and snippy, when no one freaking told me that their soup and salad comes out TOGETHER and before every other entree! Boo"
Thomas L.,"Austin, TX",17,9,,1.0,9/29/2015,"Gave em a third chance. After waiting 45+ minutes for two small pizzas, salad, soup, hamburger and chicken sandwich we finally received part of our order. Hamburger resembled a nice charred piece of oak except harder than oak. Chicken sandwich and sales were MIA. The place was not busy and when I asked for the manager he was less than capable of handling an unhappy customer. Not that I was obnoxious or rude. ""All I can do is apologize, I didn't know there was a problem."" Jaci was sweet but didn't keep an eye on our table very well."
Raymond S.,"Austin, TX",97,94,132,2.0,10/4/2014,Poor food execution but had decent service.  The calamari came overdone in what tasted like it was fried in old oil. Shrimp tacos had a cold tortilla and blackened shrimp was super salty. French dip sandwich was probably the best thing of the night but that was not saying much. Fries that came with tasted like above calamari...old oil Pizooki dessert came with under cooked cookie!  The Fort Worth BJs was way better in food quality. Disappointed in the food BC there is no quality control.
Shani S.,"Austin, TX",438,514,442,1.0,4/16/2014,"So, we made reservations for a Friday evening.  We show up and let them know we are there (at 6:50) for our 7pm reservation. Let me preface this by saying that my aunt is handicapped and that standing for her is very hard.  Also, BJ's is packed with children running about.  Ok, back to my experience.  After letting the hostess know that we were there for our 7pm reservations, she tells us it will be about 30 minutes before they can seat us.   Uhhhhh  What? I ask her ""What is the point of a reservation if we still need to wait the 30 minutes to be seated?"" She doesn't even respond, merely rolls her eyes and walks away.  Awesome.  My aunt and uncle arrive.  There is no place for her to sit, as all the seating is taken up with other families waiting to be seated.  Maybe they had 6:30 reservations?.... I help my aunt over to what I am hoping might be a safe zone and stand with her and chat.  Well, I sucked at the whole protective barrier thing, as a small child comes running by and almost knocks her down.   I love kids, don't get me wrong... I don't like parents that can't teach their children to maintain a behavior suitable to situations.  This is isn't a park. Shaken, I help my aunt to a bar stool that my uncle has grabbed and we seat her quickly.  A man, whom I will assume was the manager, then stomps over and says ""You can't let her sit there!  This will not do.  Move that stool now!"" I explain what's happened to my aunt, that we're trying to help her, our reservation issue and he scowls at me and says ""Look, I said this won't do.  Move her.  Now."" ""Where would you have me put her?  Let me know if we can sit somewhere else and I'll get her there, sir.  I just want to make sure she's comfortable and safe."" We help my aunt up, move the chair.  I turn to ask him again where we should go and he has stomped off.  Nice.  I am totally in love with this joint so far.  Finally, we are seated at 7:38.  Awesome.  We are seated at a circular booth.   A waitress comes, takes drink orders and disappears.  About 30 minutes later, we get drinks.  The place is packed, I will say that.  Lots of families... lots of families.  My mother gets her wine, white, as well as my aunt.  My mom's white wine is warm.  We wait another 20 minutes of flagging down the waitress for her to come over.  She then argues with my mother about what the temperature of her wine is.  At this point, I hate this place and I want to leave.   The menu is overwhelming with a million different things to order.  It's like a Chili's or Cheddars. I chose the grilled chicken.  Oh, look, it's previously frozen, shaped chicken.  Yum. Let's just say, I will never return.  The people there are not so nice and the food is not so awesome, either.  BJ's, you're not even good enough to be on my ""oh hell no"" list.  You're like that bad date that I want to pretend never happened."
Code Name V.,"Austin, TX",52,33,35,5.0,10/11/2015,"I happened to come upon this establishment on the reccomendation and of a fellow bartender. This was my first visit and it was at the bar manned by a very capable and friendly bartender named Scotty. So I'm  aware BJs is a chain from CA but that doesn't mean they can't excell at what they do and it's obvious they do their own thing and do it well. BEER and PIZZA!!! They take it seriously here whether it's brewing their own craft beer, offering the best local options or customizing your own deep dish pizza. On Scotty's recomendation, my lovely companion and I  both agreed we had the best IPA we ever had in St. Arnolds double ipa Endeavor. Creamy, strong, and well bodied. Decadent!.  Speaking of, we also dined on root beer ribs (fell off the bone), buffalo wings (solid), and bj classic pizza thin crust style(very good). The bar and overall decor of the restaurant is comfortable and you can tell they put effort and allot of money in the design. Prices aren't bad either. I was a little surprised the other reviews were all over the place but I can only detail my experience.   Fun environment, great service, clever tv screens, superior bar food  and great beer sum up my BJ's experience. Keep it up guys!"
Michael G.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,3/27/2016,"Dirty table. Empty drinks. Cold, kind of yucky food. Rude service. Huge bill. God I hate this place."
