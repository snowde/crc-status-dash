Chuck M.,"Silverdale, WA",2922,434,5215,4.0,12/17/2017,"BJ's Brewhouse appears to me to be one of those chain restaurants that really knows what the consumer wants when out dining. This restaurant really is one of the wife's favorite places to go...only because it is located so far away from our home do I not appreciate coming here. With that said...service is almost always prompt, and always cheerful. I do like eating here very much. I have tried many of the menu items...lately I've enjoyed the parmigiana crusted chicken, served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Routinely this dish comes with a lemon style gravy...the gravy is good, but I always ask to have the regular chicken gravy instead. Our food arrived promptly. I had the chicken tortilla soup as a starter. It arrived first, steaming hot and very yummy. This is a really tasty soup. Following was our entree...the wife really enjoyed her fried chicken with gravy, mashed potatoes and vegetables. She doesn't deviate from what she wants, this is it or she goes elsewhere. Me on the other hand, I try all kinds of foods...tonight I ordered the parmigiana crusted chicken, it was a large dish, excellent chicken...perfectly steamed broccoli, and very good mashed potatoes."
Glen B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,6,1,1.0,1/3/2018,"Terrible, service, host, waitress, manager. Rib eye steaks are better at the dollar store, much smaller but at least edible. Tryed to order beer, waitress had no clue, hard drink, a slow screw, not any clue, and of course a huge bar this size would be able to stock slow gin and orange juice, Not!. Ok what about amereto and coke, no just Pepsi, let try that. Just guess , ... , Ok now how about extra ranch on the side for the $15.00 salad. Sure 2oz. And none on the salad, so the word extra must mean something different to this place than extra. We tried to make the best of it, until getting the evil eye from the manager, for overstaying our allowed time slice, even though the 14 empty tables on our section and total lack of patrons, of course there might have been a party looking for waterfront seating, and our table had that puddle of water from the leaky ceiling right next to us. Oh yeah and the smiling staff, NOT. NOT ONE SINGLE SMILE PERIOD. Even the nice ""thanks for coming, come back to see us soon.""   ...not...hostess was way to busy for that, there were going to be customers come in so she had all attention on that possibility alone. Would we recommend this place to anyone, sure our worst enemies, forwarding a different message to them next."
Amie A.,"Federal Way, WA",29,5,4,2.0,1/1/2018,"*sigh* another less than stellar experience.   I was willing to completely overlook the fact that the chili queso dip we ordered came without the chili.  Mistakes happen, so I moved on.  Then our entrees arrived and it was very clear that my sweet potato fries ( that I was charged  extra for because they are a premium side) had sat for quite a while and were barely warm.  My husbands regular fries, however, were hot and amazing.  My chicken sandwich had barely any honey mustard, but that was easily fixed.... although for a $15 sandwich i hopes for a little more care and attention to detail.  Still, not too big of a deal.    Here's what offended me, ruined the experience,  earned 2 stars and put BJ's on the list of places I'm not going to spend my money at......  I was maybe a quarter of the way through my meal when the server, who had been extremely inattentive the entire visit popped back up and asked us if we wanted dessert.  I typically finish my entree before thinking about that, so I found that a little odd.  When we declined, instead of making us feel comfortable to finish our meal, the server hands us the check.  With almost my entire meal untouched and each of us with a full beer.  We had every intention of ordering another drink, relaxing and enjoying our dinner.  Instead, we felt rushed and so finished quickly so as not to inconvenience them any further .  It's sad that In a restaurant that wasn't even half full they pressure their customers to get out as quickly as possible rather than taking great care of them.   Lesson learned, and I'll spend my money at businesses that value their customers."
Terry S.,"Raleigh, NC",91,19,2,3.0,12/28/2017,Called ahead for seating. Didn't matter - was still told 25-30 minutes upon arriving on a Thursday night at 8pm. Seated in about 10. Host staff was cold at best. BJ's Bloody Mary was good. Peruvian Shrimp Quinoa bowl was great except for the obvious lack of quinoa in the bowl. Should be renamed Shrimp rice bowl with Peruvian quinoa. Server (i believe his name was Ponce) was awesome and full of personality. Keep him around. Three Stars. Pluses were the taste of the food and the server. Minuses were the host staff and lack of quinoa in the quinoa bowl.
Dan B.,"Warren, MI",2,72,1,5.0,12/12/2017,"So, I'm here for work for a couple of days. We went to this mall and unsuccessfully tried one restaurant. Tonight, we tried BJs.  And we were all happy.  The service could not have been better. Caitlyn (spelling?) Was amazing and friendly.  I had the ribs. They weren't bad. I was full, and the taste was quote pleasing.  The tortilla soup was great, as well.  If you come to Tacoma Mall, come here to eat. The restaurant was nice and the food and service were great."
Brenda L.,"Puyallup, WA",191,226,428,3.0,10/7/2017,"My review is for the current lunch menu. I felt like every option was so salty and heavy. I went for chicken and bacon ranch piadina with fries, it was so heavy and salty I was unable to finish it. I would recommend it if you exchange the fries for salad or something.  My daughter had the deep dish pizza. It was not that good according to her, the bread tasted not like pizza bread.  Our friend had the bbq ribs, that came with a salad and free dessert plus 2 sides. I feel like that was a good deal, but it was so much food we took some to go.  The dessert was cookies and cream Pizzoki or however you spell it. That was fantastic according to them. I did not try it but my daughtee totally loved it. So if you are into desserts then you must try this one."
Tiffani A.,"Tacoma, WA",12,124,99,5.0,11/26/2017,"Had dinner with my friend here last night! Our server Monique was very delightful. Bj's has a great variety of food... We started with house ceasar salad, shared pita nachos (new fav) as an appetizer, then my friend got a salmon with cherry glaze that was divine. I forgot the name of the salmon dish. Also from previous dining experiences, I also recommend their avacado egg rolls & spinach artichoke dip. Their flatbreads are also good here. Everyone is very friendly & helpful. Our appetizer came after the salmon entree & the manager came over to apologize which wasn't necessary but very nice & shows that they truly care about their customers. I definitely recommend this location"
Anita V.,"Auburn, WA",60,29,52,4.0,10/8/2017,"Looooove BJs, everything tastes so fresh and delicious. At this point I think I've consumed at least one-fourth of their menu. A+. Would recommend for a birthday celebration, bestie hang out, pre movie, post movie, post hike and date nights. This. Is. The. Spot."
Kristen A.,"Lakebay, WA",255,133,61,5.0,11/18/2017,"I love BJs for happy hour or lunch with clients. It's not fast but it's like a step up from Applebee's with an amazing menu. There are so many options and I've loved everyone I've had. Service is always great, in the bar or the restaurant. Parking sucks at the mall but that's not their fault!"
Shellie T.,"Tacoma, WA",75,313,996,3.0,4/6/2017,I am on the fence with my most recent trip to BJ's. I believe this is the first time I have reviewed this location. The service is always good however the food this time was actually pretty bad. I ordered the fish and chips and it was warm and served on a nice plate however there was so much better and so little fish I don't see that it was worth the price I paid. If it wasn't for the $24 and drinks I purchased I don't think that I would have even given it three stars. I will be back to BJ's to eat again however I am skeptical.
Taylor K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/30/2017,"Have visited many times and never was impressed. Served overripe avocado and brown mush in same dish calling it guacamole. Kids meals are gross. Calamari is all tentacles. Beer is mediocre and overpriced. Environment is meh. Side order of fries is tiny and expensive. Tired of giving them a ""second chance"" never going again."
A Joe S.,"Lakewood, WA",109,115,35,4.0,8/27/2017,"Trying to find a place to watch a game with my daughter while eating breakfast is a challenge. Sometimes only the bar area has a tv, so it doesn't work. BJs did the trick today. Decent breakfast tacos, and my daughter loved her pancakes and bacon. The wait staff set me up with the Mariners game when the entire place was filled with NFL games. Not the best Bloody Mary, but better than average, and a good price. While this is a relatively generic regional chain, I'd come back if the local options didn't work--it's kind of like an upscale Applebee's."
Alex C.,"Lakewood, WA",27,7,2,5.0,7/28/2017,The new prime is amazing. So juicy and tender. Unbelievable. The asparagus was okay. It was too lightly seasoned and a little under cooked. The desert was fantastic of course.  The wait staff was super friendly and helpful. As always I'm impressed with this place and will return.
Zach L.,"Orem, UT",260,237,166,2.0,12/10/2016,"I think this is the end.  And I'm sad. I tried BJs a few years ago in San Diego and fell in love with their pizza.  I had it twice--the sweet pig and the great white--and loved them both.   Now, I've been back four times, twice in Anaheim and twice here, in Tacoma.  Both of those places cooked their pizza the exact same way, which makes me think the restaurant has changed their recipe . . . and it's terrible.   Back then: tasty sauce, good sauce-to-dough ratio, plentiful toppings, and a nice crust (spongy but not too oily).   Now: oil, oil, oil.  The dough is inedible.  The sauce (here and in Cali) was nonexistent.  The toppings weren't anything to be proud of, and the dough was inedible.  Yes, I said that twice.  It's just awful.  It's like they soak it in 2 cups of nasty, old deep frying oil.   It's just . . . sad.   (So why two stars?  Their wedge salad is good, at least.)"
Kristina K.,"Kent, WA",120,223,36,4.0,2/14/2017,"After trying to get into Cheesecake factory and have a terrible experience - we went to BJ's and they made up for it. We went for my bachelorette party and they have two waitresses that were handling our table. The food is delicious I love Bj's pizza- delicious sauce, good sauce-to-dough ratio, plentiful toppings, and a nice crust (deep dish, spongy but not too oily). The salad is crisp and flavorful as well as loaded with deliciousness!  BJ's is great for accommodating large parties.  The only negative would be with our two waitresses - I would have appreciated to have them not have other tables as they were not very attentive because they had to handle their other tables."
Shane ..,"Lacey, WA",4,22,25,5.0,8/5/2017,I love this place. I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all good. The chicken fried steak burger is what dreams are made of. The rotating beers are always good to try. Happy hour is from 3-7 weekdays and 10- close Sunday- Thursday. They always have the best games on tv in the bar. If you don't like what's on they will change it for you. Great place
Vanessa C.,"Seattle, WA",1,7,,4.0,9/24/2017,"The entire experience at BJ's for dinner was excellent. We had the Superfood Salad with blackened salmon, Mediterranean chicken pitas, and the Parmesan chicken. All delicious. Prior to getting our meals, our waitress was very attentive and gave us frequent ETAs on our food arrival. Manager even came by to apologize about the delay; super nice of him. We weren't in a rush anyway as we were busy watching football on their big screens. I'll definitely be back."
Dean C.,"Federal Way, WA",2,30,8,2.0,5/30/2017,They can check how often I come to this place. A lot I come here sense I was 17 now I am 26 and I come here still but my last few time coming here have been extremely bad...  The sodas have a bad taste like dirt The new small back mac and cheeses was so bad and tasteless  Fish tacos are bad - need a new recipe probably one from Houston tx they make food fish tacos  The rips and mash potatoes lol is a joke The BBQ pork burger was nasty basic flavor  Pizza is still good
Debbie M.,"Spanaway, WA",39,65,3,3.0,8/26/2017,"We ordered the honey chicken salad for 14.95   They  used to have lunch size for 7 something and a larger size for dinner.  Now they  only have dinner size, but I think someone forgot to tell the cook because our salads were small  diffidently not worth $14.95  And their drinks are about $1.00 more then other places. The waitress was not attentive never came by to see it we needed anything or if our food was ok.   This is the second time in a row this place has disappointed us"
Pepper J.,"Canyon Country, CA",4,23,129,2.0,4/26/2017,"The service was good don't get me wrong but I recieved silver ware dirty and my order was wrong, so I wasn't very happy about that."
John E.,"Seattle, WA",52,182,14,3.0,3/3/2017,"Kind of like they typical corporate chain restaurant you see at malls.  A menu that rivals a Stephen King book.   The most time I spend there is choosing what I want.  I'd rather go to a mom & pop place, but when at Southcenter, that's not really a choice. So I give up and get the burger 2 of the 3 times I was there.   They pass the gutbomb test, so I am willing to go back when starved.  I also had a nice ahi tuna salad that was quite good. But it's a chain and I would rather not go to a corporate place."
Mindy M.,"Tacoma, WA",33,93,49,2.0,3/12/2017,This was my go to place when I didnt feel like cooking because of the fresh Atlantic salmon they have. It's so gooooooooooooooood with the lemon butter sauce! BUT this and last year every time I've come in their servers are all so inattentive and not sincere. Maybe it's because the location is in Tacoma and Tacoma is known for having RATCHET ass people but hiring ratchet and slow servers doesn't do any good for a business... just a tip. I think I'll just drive to the puyallup location.
Linda W.,"Spanaway, WA",0,1,,2.0,11/26/2017,Been going to BJ for lunch have not been there in a while.  Ordered the shrimp scampi.  Poor Very expensive for what it was  no bread no salad  $19.95  pasta was tough not totally cooked.  Husband ordered the BJ hamburger.  The meat was burned around the edges along with the bun.  He tried to scrap off the burned part on the bun and only ended up eating the center part of the meat by itself. Will not be going back  for $36.00 total bill will go somewhere else
So-Ying C.,"Seattle, WA",102,24,2,4.0,3/19/2017,"My husband and I treated his parents out to BJ's for her birthday dinner.  We ordered the salmon with couscous, rib dinner (full rack with a bake potato and roasted asparagus), seared ahi tuna salad and two clam chowder with the bread bowls.  The bread bowl clam chowder is a must try! I was first hesitant with ordering the soup with the bread bowl but I'm glad we did. It was well seasoned with garlic & butter, and toasted to perfection. Crunchy exterior with a chewy interior. Even when it cooled down, the bread was still delicious.  Overall, a very satisfying experience."
William H.,"Mineral, WA",36,169,361,3.0,5/2/2016,A very large resteraunt with an extensive menu.  Started with calamari then a wedge salad finishing up with the main course a triple decker sandwich.  The calamari was tasty and cooked well not rubbery at all. The wedge salad was good (typical salad). The sandwich was good with alot of meat on it surrounded by wedge fries.   The service was good but a little slow the facilities were very modern and clean.  Parking was plentiful because of the mall next to the resteraunt.  A good stop if your shopping and want to go close to the mall for food.
Katya M.,"Vancouver, WA",0,3,1,5.0,11/3/2017,"This is the best service I've ever gotten, food came out really fast and every thing tasted great  very pleased with service, will definitely be back"
Mel S.,"Lakewood, WA",3,58,245,4.0,11/13/2016,Their tacos are amazing! loooong menu. alot of options. I've only had make orders take out. fresh food.
Patrick K.,"Ocean Shores, WA",25,2,1,2.0,8/14/2017,"I went to BJ's for lunch, had a Chicken Bacon Piadia w/sweet potato fries, caesar salad, and a diet Dr. Pepper.  The diet Dr. Pepper was ok on the first drink, but the other two tasted like not enough syrup.  The Piadia was pretty small and warm only, as well as the sweet potato fries, not hot mind you.  The caesar salad was good though.  I expect my food to be hot, not like it was sitting around for awhile before being served.  Probably won't be going back."
Donald W.,"Lakewood, WA",11,8,7,1.0,8/9/2017,"The food was horrible! The service was worst! I took my wife here for a pre-Mother's Day lunch and what a disappointment. First, the burgers were tasteless. It was like eating a piece of dry wood. We ordered an appetizer and the appetizer came after the meal. The waitress said, ""Sorry I tried"". What a fucking joke. The waitress was rude and inattentive. This is the first time in my adult life that I left no tip. What a joke. Denny's has a better burger and service than this place and it's cheaper. The best thing about this restaurant was the water. Save your time and money."
Marquise J.,"Tacoma, WA",25,2,9,5.0,1/20/2017,"Teresa is a great server. She knows exactly what she is doing and how to treat people, exceptional customer service. More than accommodating. I felt like I was at a good friends house and mom was cooking. Being that I work in the restaurant industry and understand what pressure Teresa could be experiencing, she performs very above average. You can tell she cares about her job and the people she serves. Thanks girl! I'll be back hopefully on your shift... Keep up the good work. So helpful, so cheery I am so satisfied."
Nora T.,"Tacoma, WA",124,3,4,1.0,2/12/2017,"This is the worst place to go, I waited almost an hour for our food and when it finally came is was cold as my drinks - didn't get the manager when our waiter stated that she notify him.about the wait...A ""NO SHOW"" but showed up to the couple that was next to us which was we were here before their were....DO NOT waste your time here - it's  been a long time since we were here, due to the same issue so we thought we would give it another 2nd chance - NOPE, mistake to do - NEVER WILL BE HERE AGAIN NEVER - THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED  AND OR FIXED ANYTHING ABOUT THIS - needs to resolve this -"
Bernard M.,"Olympia, WA",1,70,77,2.0,4/6/2016,"BJ's is one of those restaurants that I've had trouble enjoying. The food is ok to good but not great. The selection is interesting but not satisfying and since I don't drink the beers and spirits aren't really something I consider. This location however is sadly the worst BJ's I've been to. It's not overwhelmingly bad or anything it's just not good. The food always tastes 'wrong' compared to other BJ's locations. The service is decent though, our waitress was good and even took a bad soup off the bill for us so I really appreciate that the customer service is there. Still for the price I can't say that it's worth it and to me (and most people) that's going to count. For the same price point I can find better more robust menus and flavors."
Tessa A.,"Port Orchard, WA",28,68,1,5.0,6/25/2017,"My mimosa was great and we had brunch, I loved the pancakes & so did my son. My husband loved the mushroom burger, we will be eating here again, hopefully soon!"
K. V.,"Tacoma, WA",0,5,,1.0,12/27/2016,"This place is mediocre. Went with the family on 12-26-16. Got the phone app and checked in (ten minute wait) arrived and the wait was an additional 45 minutes. Full foyer (maybe they didn't have personnel). I counted six empty/clean tables. Not impressed. Server was nice, not busy. No drink refills without waving her down. She had one speed. Ordered dessert. She didn't write one of the four down. One dessert wasn't delivered. Dessert server was a different employee. Almost rolled his eyes at my request for the un-delivered item. For $150.00 dinner this was crap. Won't go back."
Alaina W.,"Tacoma, WA",1,37,17,5.0,4/27/2017,"White cheddar mashed potatoes to die for. This food is stupid good Great service, $5 drinks, awesome ribs, kids spaghetti & fruit is on point :-) our waitress Lauren recommended the Cherry Chipotle salmon and it's amazing. It came with asparagus. I hate asparagus but it is cooked perfectly :-)"
Claudine C.,"Lakewood, WA",1,2,,5.0,6/1/2017,"Yesterday I dined at BJ's and my servers name was Faviola! She must have been a waitress angel that fell from customer service heaven assigned specially to my table. I was in awe of how speedy her service was despite how busy it was. Right before I can get to the half way point of my drink, she would refill. Never did I have to wave her down. She was kind, funny, and got the job done. She was a great additional highlight to a well prepared shrimp quinoa meal. I have no complaints at all. Keeep up the great food and service BJ's! Signed, Satisfied customer"
Rebecca C.,"Suitland, MD",0,11,20,4.0,11/13/2016,"Great for groups, luncheons and brunch. Nothing I've ordered has been a disappointment."
Nakota L.,"Lakewood, WA",55,6,11,5.0,8/2/2016,"The service is fantastic, not only that being told about the phone application helps w everything! I can us the app to make a reservation, order food to go and even be picked up when I want to pick it up. It also gives me a personal number so I can begin to receive rewards points towards every purchase made, I'm making my way up to $75 off my bill   I even received a free dessert just for signing up. How cool is that. They even have great food and lots of great beer to choose from including some handcrafted beers."
Adrian S.,"Olympia, WA",64,386,149,3.0,7/19/2016,"I went in the other day and ordered a Cobb salad -- one of my all time favorites. BJ's had a ""New Derby-Style Chicken Cobb"" on the menu, so I gave it a shot. Unfortunately, it didn't compare to what the Brown Derby invented back in the 1930s. First off, the salad was wet. I don't think the lettuce had been dried properly. The ""herb-grilled chicken breast"" was way over-salted, and there was a tiny little pile of chopped bacon and a tiny pile of crumbled blue cheese sitting on the edge of the bowl. C'mon...those are the stars of the salad. The ""housemade avocado ranch dressing"" didn't really help things, they should have stuck with the original recipe's Roquefort cheese and red-wine vinaigrette. The saving grace was the Long Island iced tea. It was very good. Next time I'll stick to sandwiches."
Taylor R.,"Bremerton, WA",81,21,6,3.0,4/22/2017,20 minute wait for Saturday night at 7pm. We had a lovely waitress. Fried calamari was hot and fresh. Our waitress brought my son a snack plate while we waited. I order the sirlion steak. There was no flavor and it was overcooked for what I asked. My husband ordered the deep dish pasta. He loved it. Said it was very tasty. Overall expirenece was great. Wouldn't order the steak again though
