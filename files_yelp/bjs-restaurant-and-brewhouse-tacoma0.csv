Marci E.,"Auburn, WA",0,1,,1.0,3/28/2014,"Nothing good to say. Had tried Southcenter location maybe a year ago. Poor service. Tried Tacoma hoping service better. No. Food over priced for quality. Took too long to get food, then not warm. Restaurant close to empty and still took over two hours for five people. Mentioned food allergy. When waiter arrived made sure to comment that kitchen prepared dish according to request. Salmon on bed of rice with veggies allergic to. Salmon had been put on rice mixture then put on different plate. Warned him if I had a reaction I'd be calling them. No concern whatsoever.  Never again going."
Elton H.,"Kapowsin, WA",15,33,,1.0,3/24/2012,"#1: Ordered a drink while waiting for othe rpeople to arrive. Bartender says ""Want a double""? I said ""SURE""! $15.00 freaking dollars for 2 minimal shots of Canadian Club whiskey. That's what a fifth costs. Total BS. #2. Ordered baby back ribs. VERY TOUGH AND DRY AS A BONE. Burnt ends and cold to the touch. #3. Baked potato had a SMALL dab of cheese which was ice cold and rock hard. Potato was so cold it was unedible. Told the waitress about it and she just blew me off. WTF? #4. Wife had crusted chicken. DRY, COLD and some type of powdered stuff on the outside. STAY AWAY FOLKS. This is one place that will be out of business soon."
Bryan H.,"Tacoma, WA",2,9,1,2.0,11/30/2013,Mac and Cheese was good. Service was not. Shannon our waitress had no sense of urgency and barely came to our table to check on us. She also wasn't audible at all.
Dennis M.,"Gig Harbor, WA",31,9,3,2.0,11/5/2013,"So I was seated promptly & given a menu. I ordered a hard cider & a diet Pepsi, then the pot roast dinner with the garden salad, 1000 island, no tomatoes.  Hard cider came out. Server stopped to confirm whether I wanted the pot roast sandwich or the pot roast dinner. Confirming I wanted the dinner, she left.  Eventually the salad arrived with tomatoes. Salad was good. Then dinner arrived... it was the pot roast sandwich! The server did stop by & noticed that it wasn't the dinner... she offered to take the sandwich & replace it with the dinner, I said no (because I was now hungry). The bill arrived, I figured that she would have adjusted it to the pot roast sandwich, but she still charged me for the dinner, so took out up to the front counter to be adjusted. Never did get the diet Pepsi, but wasn't charged for it either. Overall, dinner was good.... but would have been better had the order been correct."
Sam L.,"Palm Springs, CA",25,15,6,1.0,11/20/2013,I can only give it a one star because  we actually never ate there. We asked to be seated at one booth and was told no because we reserve those for big parties. They showed us to a booth and we asked to go to another booth and the hostess rolled her eyes. Eventually we say down and waited for over five minutes and nobody came to serve water or introduce them self. We got up and left.
Kimberly Y.,"Puyallup, WA",0,12,,5.0,10/3/2015,"Tried the BJ's in Puyallup. Not a fan. My food was cold and it took forever to have it brought back, my husband was done with his meal by time I got it. Barely an apology. Met up with family at the Tacoma location completely different experience. GREAT service, outstanding and attentive. We had quite a few people in our party and everyone's food and drink came in a reasonable amount of time on a busy Friday night. The food was hot and delicious the waiter was very personable and really took good care of us. I will definitely return to this location."
Mallory S.,"Boston, MA",38,391,11,3.0,2/7/2014,Pretty standard. Decent beer and average food. Large menu is good for anyone and lunch options are a good deal. Family-friendly.
Natalie P.,"Calgary, Canada",23,90,5,4.0,7/11/2012,"Great Pizza, Excellent Service and very tasty Rootbeer! Our server was Rachel and she was fantastic - we (my boyfriend)  hadn't had such great service in a long time!  Rachel is friendly, knowledgeable, prompt and efficient.  She is a great upseller and reads her guests well. The restaurant is very nice with very high ceilings, large screen tv's and the room for large parties."
Chris B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,5,,4.0,2/18/2015,"Great beer, happy hours, and service. I don't get why some people bash on them so much. It's not a 5 star restaraunt, just a nice place with a great atmosphere to get some tasty grub and catch up with friends."
Kim P.,"Tacoma, WA",169,509,42,4.0,1/30/2012,"So people compare this place to the Cheesecake Factory and I can see why! First off would be the booklet of a menu they hand to you, GEEZ! It's actually pretty similiar and so is the options available inside.. Lots to choose from which gives the staff time to take care of the other plethora of customers. Yes, the restaurant is quite large and decently full as well, especially during peak hours! Service here is good, the restaurant is still pretty new to the area therefore, Tacoma has done a good job with not downing grading this joint, yet! The interior is dim and DAMN shuffle as you walk, I thought it was just me the first time I came but everyone has the same story about the floor here and how they damn near bit the dust and actually of few of my gals have, LMAO!!!! It's located adjacent to the mall so parking can be horrendous, so plan ahead.  The bar is pretty awesome, especially the HH menu and service. That's the reason for the additional star!!"
Louise E.,"Tacoma, WA",262,46,46,3.0,8/14/2012,It was my first time here. I had heard so many people praising this place that my family and I had come to finally check it out. I don't see what's so great. I guess they are known for their beer collection because one of the first things i noticed was the bar in the back. They has beer on beer on beer! Even international kind. We had to wait for a pretty long while which wouldn't have been a problem if the place was packed - but it wasn't. Same goes for our food. Our server was nice though.  The food itself was so-so. But I've cooked better.  Go and eat here if you want. But that was my first and last time.
Jamie A.,"Tacoma, WA",1,12,,4.0,6/18/2014,"slightly addicted to their pazooki's. I have been back multiple times and been impressed with the menu. Only had one inconsistency of lacking of garnishes on my appetizer one time. Other than that service has been great, food quality is great and I am excited to try something new every time I go!"
Britannia D.,"Tacoma, WA",0,14,1,2.0,11/3/2013,"This is specifically for their curbside to-go service. I used their online ordering website and it worked pretty well, easy to navigate and understand, no weird glitches - overall pretty good. My order automates the time at which my food is supposed to be ready (4:52pm). I arrive slightly late to pick up my food (4:55pm) and park, call the number listed on the sign. The phone rings and rings for so long that I'm starting to wonder if anyone is going to answer - I am almost ready to check and see if I misdialed when a hurried sounding server answers and puts me on hold abruptly. I sit on hold for some time (maybe five minutes?), then a woman picks up on the phone and says ""I'll be here in just a minute."" and then puts me back on hold for a few more. When she comes back she informs me that my order is not yet ready (now about ten minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready) but I'm willing to be unbothered by it, clearly they're extremely busy and we're all only human so whatev. I wait until the server brings the food out, she lists each item in the bag as she hands it to me saying ""the two entrees in this bag, one steak one burger"" and the appetizer and other miscellaneous things in the other. I take the bags, pay, leave. Arrive home and discover that the salad that comes with the $20 NY Strip Smothered in Bleu cheese & mushroom sauce is nowhere to be found. Then I discover that my ""smothered"" NY Strip is not smothered in anything at all and is sitting dry on top of my mashed potatoes. Frankly; $20 is a lot of money to pay for a dry unseasoned ungarnished steak with a single potato side dish. Normally I'd be willing to let something like this go because toppings are normally something I as a customer would add - but this dish was ADVERTISED as having the topping. It is pretty questionable that the cooks in the kitchen don't know how to prepare their own dishes.  Beyond that the experience was fine, food tasted alright (the food that I actually got anyway) - my husband had a burger with jalapenos on it and wedge fries that he really liked and my steak was alright and my potatoes were also okay. The stuffed mushroom appetizer we got as above average.  Not too sorry to say that we won't be coming back to this place. The very high cost for screwed up orders and averageish food just makes it not worth it. I can go to applebees and get screwed up average tasting food there for a fraction of the price."
Sam M.,"Renton, WA",1,61,,4.0,7/18/2014,"I just got home after having dinner at the BJs at Tacoma Mall. The food was good.  I had the Mediterranean Chicken Tacos which I enjoyed and will order again when I want something light.  For dessert I had the bake beignet which is my favorite that I've ordered every time I've eaten at the Southcenter BJs.  While the baked beignet at the Tacoma BJs was good, I felt something was missing and felt it wasn't as good as what I have eaten at the Southcenter BJs. While the food was good, the service was HORRIBLE!  We were seated promptly but after that service was non-existent.  It took forever for our waiter to come to our table and when he finally showed up we gave him our drink order and what we wanted to eat.  It took FOREVER just to get a glass of water -  he must have been in the parking lot drilling for water.  After serving our water and drinks we didn't see our waiter for the longest time.  Another waiter brought our food and after that no one stopped by to see how we were doing or even asked how our meal was.  After sitting for a while after we finished our dinner, we had to flag down a waitperson to get a dessert menu and to find out what happened to our waiter because he was non-existent.  After another long wait, our waiter FINALLY surfaced and took our dessert order. Since we're used to the Southcenter location, which has outside seating, we asked our waiter if the Tacoma location had outside seating.  The response we got was that he  didn't know if the Tacoma location had outside seating."
Peggy T.,"Tacoma, WA",2,64,15,3.0,12/31/2013,"Went there a few weeks ago. The wait for a table was short. The table itself was quite small with little to no room for coats or purses. The fried artichokes were very good, the roast beef sandwich was just okay. The wait staff was friendly."
Gordon N.,"Tacoma, WA",80,24,8,2.0,9/5/2011,"Ahi poke, mini tacos, furakake on the wontons, nice touch. Tacos tasty, bartender on top of it. Poke bland, needed more sauce which they got fast...asked for more cilantro and jalapenos for tacos, also fast...good service, nice atmosphere...will come back, reasonably priced, generous portions...very inexpensive for quality ahi.  On another visit --Stay away from their deep dish pizza. NOT A FAN.  ...Also [really poor] nachos made from tortilla chips  from colors not found from this earth are to be avoided. I mean really...bad nachos--bad sex-- still pretty good right? WRONG! Good to stop in after a late movie at the Regal 15"
Steve F.,"Gig Harbor, WA",65,137,29,3.0,6/13/2012,"Service good and atmosphere good.  A large menu with quite a nice variety.  Also a solid beer selection.  Fits the mold of a well executed mass market commercial chain - in my book, when executed well, there is nothing wrong with that.  If the food here were better it would be easy to give this place 4 or 5 stars.  They have a diverse menu and I can't say I've been through much of it.  When in the area I will try it again because it is a pleasant atmosphere.  I can say their fish and chips were average at best, a somewhat thicker mushier crust with less fish than you would hope for.  Same goes for the calamari.  The presentation was very nice but it came out lukewarm and sort of soggy vs. fresh and popping.  Our server was excellent so no issues there.  A good food stop if you are at the Tacoma Mall."
Brittney R.,"Tacoma, WA",4,26,8,3.0,1/13/2014,Loved the raspberry lemonade it's a great alternative to the overplayed strawberry lemonade. Watched the Hawks game here the other day and it was a great atmosphere in there!
Debbie G.,"Tacoma, WA",0,13,6,3.0,7/30/2015,"The service was ok. We were a large party and one of our guests never received his soup until the end of our meal. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos, they hardly had any fish. I could have dumped the filling from one taco into the other and had one full taco."
Jacqueline L.,"Tacoma, WA",11,27,4,2.0,5/29/2015,"I'm so, so disappointed and actually pretty angry right now. I got the brew house bacon burger to go and it was one of the worst burgers I've ever had in my entire life. I ordered it medium and added onion strings to it. When I first opened up the box the burger was an absolute mess but it didn't bother me too much since maybe it moved around in the 2 minute drive to my apartment but as soon as I bit into it I knew I didn't want to eat anymore. The meat was super thin and DRY. It was well, well done and had very little seasoning. It also feel apart and crumbled when I opened it up and touched it. There was no sauce whatsoever on the burger. Which doesn't even make sense because it comes with it and is clearly written in the description and lastly there were no onion straws even though it was printed on the box they packed my burger in. I'm so surprised at this carelessness and it just seems like whoever cooked this hates his or her job and is taking it out on the people. I ate about 5 bites total, not even half of it. A complete waste of money and it put me in a bad mood as well. I regret tipping them and I'll never be back there again. The ONLY reason I gave them another star is because the pizookies are freaking awesome."
