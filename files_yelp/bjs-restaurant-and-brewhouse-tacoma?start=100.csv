Heather H.,"Tacoma, WA",141,147,328,4.0,12/31/2013,This place has a great Ahi Salad. The rice wine vingerette is perfect and the Wasabi spicy. The Watermelon Mojitos in the summer are amazing! The service is not that great but the good makes up for the service. The menu is very extensive with lots of choices.
Aadrian D.,"Gig Harbor, WA",1,7,2,5.0,12/14/2013,"Good food and drinks as usual! Yum Staff is always wonderful and very professional, never once had a problem with anything when coming to this establishment."
Daniel L.,"Burlington, NC",18,9,,2.0,11/23/2014,"The food was really delicious. No complaints there. But the server was just very awkward, and the speed of service was less than desirable.  We had ordered wings as an appetizer and ordered our food all together like 1 min after we got into the restaurant, as to give them plenty of time to make it and so that we could enjoy ourselves on our lunch break. The burgers took 25 min before they came out and our app was nowhere to be found. Disappointing. I asked them just to cancel it and they didn't give me much info as to why it wasn't ready or brought out. They also didn't offer to give the wings for free even though they took 30 min and weren't even brought out. And once again, awkward server. All in all the food was the only good thing. Bad service time, and bad service.  P.s. We were basically thirsty the whole time. No water refills were offered."
Stephanie S.,"Tacoma, WA",108,593,507,3.0,10/20/2014,"I usually eat here for lunch or for happy hour. I find dinner to be too expensive and not worth it for what you get. The BJs beers on tap are OK, they usually leave something to be desired. However, at happy hour they are $1 off. For happy hour I had the avocado egg rolls which are so good and are probably my favorite thing on the menu. I also had bacon corn balls. These were also pretty good. An OK stop if you know what to expect."
Heather E.,"Tacoma, WA",0,28,11,4.0,2/28/2016,"LOVE the grilled balsamic chicken dinner!!! In my opinion, drinks are overpriced and margaritas are heavy on the mix, light on the tequila. My husband likes the beer pretty well."
Adam R.,"Federal Way, WA",279,296,190,3.0,10/7/2013,"While my opinion of this chain was tainted by my first experience at the Southcenter Location, I think this one has brought it back to an acceptable level. I ordered the jalapeño burger with fries and a wedge salad to start. I also tried one of their seasonal stouts and had calamary to start.  While the food was ""good"" I am only giving a three star rating because it was pretty pricey. For my meal, plus my partners pizza, side of fries and root beer, it was nearly $70... I would rather go other places for that price. My burger was very tasty and was certainly a large burger. I enjoyed the fries, they were just the right crispiness. I have to say the part of my meal that stood out the most was the blue cheese dressing on the wedge salad. If you like blue cheese, I would highly recommend ordering it here! The Calarmari came out a bit over cooked, we know this because the person delivering the food accidentally poured half of it on the table. She promptly got us a new order, which was the ""right thing"" to do but certainly unnecessary. The new order was actually much better than the first, so that was good. So the food was good, service was good and over all a good experience!"
Joel B.,"Tumwater, WA",54,15,1,5.0,3/21/2016,"Not sure what the 3 star rating is all about, we are from olympia and come here for dinner or lunch whenever we are in the Tacoma area. The service is always great (weekends there's usually a long wait though), and the food is fantastic at reasonable price. Try the BBQ bacon brisket burger!!! We just finished with their new monkey bread pizookie and all I could say was ""oh shit"" while eating it because it was that good. Server even refilled my drink 3 times- I appreciate and notice that! Always a good experience."
Coral G.,"Tacoma, WA",2,11,,3.0,5/5/2015,"Go here for the pizzookies, not for the food. I went here yesterday and got a salad so smothered in dressing it felt like I was drinking it straight out of the bottle. It was good, but when you order a salad, you're not looking to drink dressing!  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and the place seemed to be jumping. Like I said, the pizzookie makes it all worth it. (Go for the red velvet, it's the best.) Definitely sharable desserts!"
Dominque D.,"Lakewood, WA",1,18,18,5.0,6/28/2014,"Mother of Arceus, that was hands down the second best, but still largest and cheesiest bacon burger I have ever had. Took my mom and sister here when they moved back to town, my mom got a personal pizza and my sis got a smaller burger. I had the double deluxe and it was so good.  Perfectly seasoned meat, buttery parmesan bun, crispy bacon. The fries though were too thin and I had way too many. Plus they were bland.  The server was a little slow moving around but my perception of time may have been off due to the really lame infomercial I was subjected to. Otherwise the food was great, the atmosphere was cool and the waitresses and female greeters were all cute and had nice rear ends"
Rachel M.,"Milton, WA",18,16,67,4.0,12/23/2015,Everything my family ordered was wonderful! Great kids menu and prices. Good burgers and sandwiches. I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos...would not order them again. The fish is way over cooked and tastes like fancy canned tuna. :( They tried redoing it but it wasn't any better the second time. The chips and sauces that came with it were good.
Angeilea Y.,"Tacoma, WA",15,12,,2.0,1/3/2016,"Second time coming here and was a bit disappointed. The service was mediocre at best, I think it's because it was the dinner rush. Our server didn't really check on us, only to bring our food & checks. It took about 20 minutes to recieve our drinks and appetizer. Anyway, we all ordered burgers and our food took an hour to get to us, which is the longest I've had to wait. I had the bacon cheeseburger and I asked for it to be well done. However when I cut into it, a good portion of the patty was raw and inedible. I tried to wave down a waitress so I could send it back but had no luck. In comparison to food, service & price is suggest Applebee's on 38th."
Monica E.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,2.0,8/16/2016,"The service was slow and inconsistent. We have eaten here before and had better food and service. There was one bright spot on the evening. When our 16 month old started getting fussy, Nikoda saved the day with a small bowl of fruit and a garlic bread twist for her. This was awesome!!! I was blown away by her thoughtfulness!! Thank you Nikola!!!"
Fred S.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,5,,1.0,5/9/2014,"Extremely disappointed with this dining experience. The few times we saw her, the waitress was pleasant enough. However, the food was...too put it simply...gross. Calamari was cold upon arrival and chewy. We didn't see the waitress for 20 minutes after dropping off the appetizer, so we just at it. My son ordered the fish tacos that were literally fishy. The rest of my family had below average meals as well. The crispy chicken sandwich was ""crispy"" but where was the chicken?  Also, don't expect a quick meal. We didn't escape BJs in less than 2 hours. Huge fail."
Erica S.,"Lakewood, WA",167,31,30,4.0,6/25/2015,"The service can be really slow at times even when it's not busy, but the food is great being that it's a chain restaurant and they have some pretty good alcohol beverages. I personally am not a huge fan of alcohol anymore but I got the pear cider and it was delicious, it tasted like a sparkling cider without the overpowering taste of alcohol. I've been here a few times and have ordered something different and so far all my choices have been great (burger, pasta, sandwich). But their best thing to me are the pizookies. If you are new to this place you need to try their pizookies, it's basically a freshly baked cookie with ice cream on it but they are so good!"
Tony Z.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,13,,5.0,8/4/2016,"Wow. What a treat. Visiting from CA. Server Adam was awesome and attentive. Explained everything I had questions about. The refillable soup and salad was one of the best. The ""captures"" and chicken tortilla soup presentation and taste was one of the best. Bill manager was cool and good. Highly recommend this place!!!"
Kathryn N.,"Carbonado, WA",157,30,,3.0,12/30/2014,"I'm not saying this place is great with a kitchen stocked of amazing culinary talent , but they are much more like Sandra lee ... Semi homemade .  We had the 'new' deep dish fries which were - eh okay. The fries were very thin ( think shoestring potatoes) so they didn't hold much of the topping, which was beef and chilies . Also ordered calamari . Not the best but definitely not the worst .  We all had cocktails or beer. They really charge you for drinks . I do recommend the pear cider. I'm not a beer drinker and it was good , crisp, refreshing . I also enjoyed a house cocktail that's was good but not 9.50 good .  I ordered a BBQ chicken salad. For the price it was a lot of food , but the flavor a and textures weren't anything to write home about. My lettuce seemed limp, the vegetables were also old and the dressing was missing something . My husband had a deep dish pizza which was mostly just dough and not much in the topping department . When you think of a deep dish you think of almost a pie , stuffed high with all those toppings, cheese and sauce .... Not this ... Think lots of dough pressed into a deep dish pan and then lightly sauced and topped. The only "" deep dish"" was the physical dish itself. We have lived in Chicago ,so maybe we know good deep dish but I wouldn't recommend it .  Think they were skimping to save money. Another time I ordered the ahi salad and it was Very delicious . If you like ahi I would recommend that .  For dessert we heard pozukkis were a must and did the trio. They were delicious . Warm, soft cookies topped with ice cream .  Our waiter was great but it did take forever to get seated. We could see our table , empty and not cleaned for at least 15 min when we were told less then a 15 min wait . We ended up waiting 35 min . I'd say it's a busy location too . Get in before the rush !"
Shawn P.,"Seattle, WA",14,3,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Ordered ziti and broccoli soup. Both were obviously microwaved, but the ziti was forgivable. They tried, twice, to pass off the broccoli soup as legit. First time out, after everyone else had started eating, the waitress apologized saying with actual air quotes that they ""tried to remake it"". Apparently the microwave was down. Tried a second time, put in a to go cup that was half the size of the original $9 bowl. Still cold! Obviously, I assumed at that point I wouldn't find it on the receipt. WRONG. My mistake for expecting more than mediocrity from a chain restaurant. At least the waitress was up front about how terrible it would be. 10/10 would eat Campbell's broccoli cheddar soup again, but maybe at a more respectable dining establishment, like the dumpster behind a Pizza Hut."
Tiffany D.,"Orting, WA",4,24,22,1.0,11/21/2015,"Had the worst dining experience ever.  Arrived with a party of 7 at 3:45 pm told the wait would be 15 minutes waited at least 30-40 minutes.  Had a very friendly server.  We all ordered drinks and appetizers they came out staggered and not at once.  Mine had frozen guacamole.  Our quick drink and snack took 2+ hours.  When we used the ladies room on the way out at 6 pm 3 of the 5 stalls were out of toilet paper and the ladies trash receptacles in the stalls were overflowing.  The manager did comp the meal with the frozen guacamole.  This was my first and last dining at ""BJs""."
Rusty S.,"Tacoma, WA",213,802,274,4.0,4/4/2011,"Good food & drinks at a Tacoma Mall restaurant?  Yeah.  Kinda weird, right? I really didn't expect to like this place.  Bj's is a national chain and its attached to a shopping mall.  I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive menu and beer/wine/cocktail selection.  The general ambiance of the restaurant exceeded my expectations as well; pretty classy compared to, say, Red Robin (and we didn't hear any irritating b-day singing!). We were told upon arrival that there would be a 15-20 minute wait to be seated, but were actually seated in about 2 minutes (there were still several other empty tables; not sure why they told us there'd be a wait).  The service was fine and the food was really, really good.  All in all I'd prefer to go to the Harmon or other local establishment for this type of menu and price range, but this was A-Ok!"
Crystal S.,"Yelm, WA",1,22,27,5.0,11/2/2014,Celebrated a birthday. Always fun. Dinner came just as ordered. Lots to choose from. Cocktails a plenty as well as home brewed root beer for the kids. For desert the Pazookies are worth saving room for.
