Russ M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,1,,2.0,7/17/2016,"Clean, got a table right away, food wasn't bad but not great. Service was bad, food was overpriced and the house brewed beer was flat, 2 different ones. For a brew house you would expect not to have a 2 inch head on a beer, need to train staff. Told them not to worry about the second one after waiting 30 min and we were leaving. It was 1:30 pm and the place was only half full."
Brenda B.,"Kent, WA",0,21,1,3.0,5/17/2014,"LOVE BJ's - been to 8 different locations - but this one falls short of all the others I have been to. WORST WAITRESS, EVER!!!!  The wait to get seated, wait to meet the waitress, the wait to get drinks - corrected, the wait for food, the wait for the bill was HORRIFIC.  We all laughed at the waitress who actually asked us to ask for her BY NAME on our next visit.... wow  The beer is so good - just save yourself frustration & DRIVE TO TUKWILA! The food will be worth the drive, I swear."
Mike M.,"Tacoma, WA",1,13,7,1.0,3/13/2015,Im not picky.... But if you like pizza and and not fake deep dish wanna be pizza or local beer or even good deals on beer go elsewhere. Trust me. I live close too the place and should of knew better.
Erin G.,"Gig Harbor, WA",139,326,18,3.0,6/5/2015,"I usually try to avoid chain restaurants when able I just like to support the local places and usually the food is better.  However, that is not the case with BJs, I have been in here many times and I always feel like I have had a very good meal.  I think of them like a TGIF Friday's restaurant when they use to be good, but even at their best they were not as good as BJs.  The menu has a large selection of burgers, pizzas, salads, soups, a lighter side selection, and a slew of beers many made in the stores.  I have always fancied their tomato biscuit soup. Their staff has always been pleasant and efficient I have never had to wait unreasonably even when they are busy.  They also have seating for large parties which come in handy when guests arrive and that brings me to another point.  The prices are very good, especially for the quality and quantity of food you get so when you are showing guests around you don't have to break the bank.  Anyhow great place and I would definitely rate these guys way above the Ram too."
Lauren C.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,4,,1.0,1/26/2014,"One word UNACCEPTABLE. We went to Bj's Tacoma and were seated immediately. We sat there for 10 minutes without anyone approaching us. After 15 minutes a server walked by, smacked the table and said ""I will be back in a while"".. No water, no menu, no greeting... You're kidding... We got up and left.  I've always had poor service at the Tacoma location, but never said anything because the food always makes up for it. This time I say GOOD LUCK. With the new surrounding restaurants you think you would be on your game. Be thankful you have delicious food, because your service is terrible."
Chris D.,"Fife, WA",0,13,2,1.0,4/5/2014,"Terrible service hateful water's food cold and over cooked. My wife and I went on Sunday at 3:00 pm. Had to wait to get table over 20 minutes. ORDER was burger and chicken salad. Took over 50 minutes to get .Food was cold and burnt. Asked waiter toget fresh frys abd never got them .The waiters then told us we should have ask her.She scold myself and wife never-ending abuse never got new frys. Was worst food and service I've ever had When food came no silverware and she ask how it was. And we said we have no silverware.  They talk to you like your a asshole.  Most tables as leaving notice most people not eating or taken home.  Thus place shouldn't be in businesses. They have huge staff and dont do anything, but talk and ignoring people."

Star M.,"Steilacoom, WA",0,7,,1.0,6/19/2016,"I am sitting here waiting for our table and asked the lady next to me if the receptionist was rude and she said yes too. So rude!! Young skinny  girl with long pony tail needs to learn what the meaning of customer service is. Almost left, but have a big Father's Day planned."
Jeanny M.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",70,589,271,3.0,1/10/2010,"We had a quick dinner here on a Saturday. The place was packed, the wait was about 45mins but we saw a table in the bar open up. Our server was awesome! I think his name was Rocky. But he was very on it, remembered everything (didn't write anything down), and kept refills current. We were fortunately there during happy hour, which was $5 personal pizzas, half off some other stuff..I wasn't listening, tbh. But my friend ordered the buffalo chicken pizza with no celery and really liked it. My other friend ordered this giant baked potato with chili in it and on the side. That's a lot of chili. I ordered a classic burger with skinny fries and it was tasty. This place is maybe a step higher than Red Robin. And so, good experience, would be open to coming back if things went that way. Thanks, Rocky!"
Jenna C.,"McChord Air Force Base, WA",0,6,,4.0,11/22/2015,The perfect place to stop in for a drink and food after shopping at the mall. Gluten free options are good! Celiac friendly
E K.,"Tacoma, WA",9,19,,2.0,5/15/2016,"While we enjoy coming to BJs, today was a bit of a disappointment.  When we arrived, we were told we would be seated in 15-20 minutes however it took nearly 40 minutes.  What appeared to be the main issue was a lack of serving staff on a Sunday afternoon?!  Our friends from Greece who really like to eat at BJs at least once every time they come to the US were quite disappointed as well."
Nathan G.,"Tacoma, WA",29,9,,5.0,11/6/2015,"Amazing food, service, beer, and atmosphere,  happy to be a platinum member!! I would recommend  this place to anybody who loves food at a decent price."
Sarah K.,"Tacoma, WA",62,16,1,2.0,5/7/2016,"Our server was great as was our app. However the trouble started when our main plates arrived. My wife and I both ordered a sirloin. She ordered hers rare and mine medium. When they came hers was medium and mine was very well done. The steaks were not flavorful at all. Her steak had absolutely no juice to it yet mine was dripping with it however the actual meat was very and I mean very dry. Now to the sides, her side of asparagus was great and her rice pilaf was fine. My sides on the other hand not so much. I decided to get their cheddar mashed potatoes which were very dry as well and didn't taste anything like cheddar but more of a fake garlic flavor. My fries were delicious however they didn't arrive until roughly 10 minutes after my main plate did. After talking to our waitress about how my steak was so over cooked it was practically inedible all she did was comp our pizooki.  All in all, definitely won't be going back anytime soon."
Michael Y.,"Auburn, WA",63,239,44,4.0,4/12/2014,"BJ's has a great selection of draft beer, including some they brew in house, which are pretty good.  I ordered the imperial IRA, which was a special brew and was exceptionally good - with quite a kick.  The food menu is extensive with almost too many choices.  It is tough to decide what to order, but that gives more time to enjoy a beer, so no big deal.  On this particular visit we were greeted and seated right away, and the server took our drink order within a few minutes.  It took a little time to get a second drink order in after finishing the first, but it wasn't too bad.  The food has always been good, but the primary appeal for me is the beer selection.  There is also a great selection of wines.  We've been here a few times and will come back when passing through Tacoma."
Anny T.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,2.0,10/21/2015,"I come to this BJ's whenever I hit the Tacoma Mall for a little shopping. It's convenient because it's right outside of the mall. Anyways, all the times I have been to this BJ's I've had bad customer service. I've experienced so much better customer service at their other locations in WA. A few times coming here I've had bad service. Servers and hostesses that just have bad attitudes!!! I understand the restaurant business can be stressful, just like any other job (yes, I've worked at restaurants before, as a host, server then management), but when you're stress.. seriously don't let your customers know! Don't complain about having to serve a 6-top table, etc. Learn to do your job right, manage your time & routine, etc then you wouldn't be complaining so much and go w/ the flow. Recently, I went to have lunch w/ 2 of my friends. It was a little pass 11:00 AM (around the time they opened). There were two 2-top tables seated at the bar, 1 2-top table & a 4-top booth occupied where we were being sat. Not busy at all right??!  We were going to get seated at a table (between the 2-top & 4-top booth), however 1 of my friends had asked if we could be seated at a booth instead due to her having her 2 month old baby with her whom she was carrying. The host took a good 5 minutes to decide if it was okay for us to even move to the booth that was right next to the table we were going to be seated at & next to the 4-top booth that was already seated. Like it was even a struggle to literally move us a seat over??? 1. Didn't like the tone of her voice when she was taking our name down(as if we were going to be on a waiting list; never had anyone ask to have our names down when they weren't busy) & questioning my friend whether she even had a carseat for the child 2. Didn't like the fact she made it seem like a damn difficult situation to move us to the booth next to the table she was seated at. When she sat us to the booth, she was frustrated & said they only had 1 server on the floor. That's funny, because the the bar had a bartender, then there was a server serving the two 2-top booths up there. The 2-top booth across from us had their own server and the 4-top booth next to us had the same server as we did. My friends & I were sure she was speaking about us to the staff members surrounding the hostess stand because literally all of them turned around & looked right at our table, while her mouth was the only one moving. If she was, which yes we're assuming she was.. really? try not to make it so obvious & if you want it to be obvious, you mind as well say it to our faces?? Another thing that irritated us, but we weren't really sure if our server was being serious was, She came to take our order & we told her we weren't ready because we literally sat down. The thing that comes out of her mouth was ""Good, I'm very busy right now"". WTF?!! you're busy when there's only 5 tables in the whole restaurant seated, which you're not even serving all of them??! All my friends & I wondered was if these people are busy now when there's not even 10 tables seated at the whole restaurant, how are they when dinner hits?! More people were on the floor, which we saw a few staff members just standing around waiting to serve people. Like I said before, I've worked in the restaurant business before. If the hostess had a problem with us asking to sit at a booth (which, hello I know there's plenty of people that do that & it messes up your section of seating for servers) but why not just let the server who was suppose to get the next table know that you'll give them the next 2 tables to make up for it or something? Explain to them what happened. At least that's what I always did for a server. I really wish the employees at BJ's wore name tags just so I could pin out who were the ones making the company look bad VS putting fingers to everyone as a whole because problem workers should get the ding for their actions, not those who work hard & do their job right!"
Michael B.,"Bremerton, WA",13,187,1,4.0,4/14/2014,"Wow, scrolling through the reviews here made me thankful we went on the day that we did. On our way home from couch shopping, we decided to stop for dinner. A friend recommended this place to us, so we decided to stop in and check it out. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were seated within a couple of minutes. Our waiter arrived around the five minute mark. We told him this was out first visit, and he immediately recommended their Irish Root Beer, which was ridiculous. So good. He also spent a few minutes going over the menu with us. A couple of minutes and halfway into my drink, we ordered our food. Patrons of Silver City in Silverdale will see a lot of familiar selections, to include handcrafted beers. We ordered a Caesar salad, which wasn't anything special, a pretty good burger and a deep dish pepperoni. I've been on the lookout for a high quality deep dish since I've moved up here. This one was okay, not to mention filling. I ended up walking home with five slices. Dessert included, our grand total was about $60, and a military discount dropped it down a few bucks. On our way out, we were thanked for our visit by a passing waitress and the front counter greeter. Hopefully this wasn't an off day, based on the reviews, because if their service has turned a corner, there's enough good stuff here to make us frequent visitors."
Michael H.,"Bonney Lake, WA",119,33,11,4.0,3/15/2015,Portions were kind of small but the place is really cool fries are very good and neither other Jo Jo's both taste like Fred Meyer frozen food however I have a deep dish mozzarella lasagna and it was very good my daughter had a chicken thing which was also very good so definitely pay attention to the menu and I went recommend anything with fries or Jojo's
James H.,"Fort Hood, TX",3,10,4,5.0,7/4/2014,Started off with a Hopstorm IPA. Got a Caesar salad which is one of the bet ones I've had. My main course chicken Alfredo pasta and it is very good as well. My son loves his Mac and cheese. My wife loves the fish dish that she ordered.
Jessica H.,"Carson City, NV",111,23,2,1.0,1/31/2015,The waitress was very short with us and the food was pretty awful. The 65 dollars we paid was for a meal that included ahi tuna drowning in dressing fried artichoke with lemon dressing that did not go at all and under seasoned pasta that sat for quite some time before we received it. The only enjoyable party of this meal was the $10 bottle of wine we paid $23 for and the fries.
Michael J.,"Seattle, WA",75,175,71,3.0,4/28/2014,"I was here on 4-26-14.... Myself & a date were looking for a great place to dine.  Luckily we chose BJ's. For a 10pm dinner on a Saturday night, the place wasn't overcrowded.  Color me surprised. There was no wait to get in,  & we were also able to seat ourselves.  Our service was pretty fast & friendly.  They really have great customer service.  They probably came around 3 times prior to us ordering to see if we were ready or not. Excellent. Finally wer were ready.  I had a strawberry margarita which was very strong. Yesssss.  One of my biggest complaints often is that a restaurant or bar sometimes doesn't make the strongest drink yes still charge a premium price. I don't mind paying as long as I'm not getting a p***y drink. Job well done BJ's. I had the smothered chicken over gravy along with mashed potatoes. If I had any recommendations, it would be that they need to make their grave thicker. It appears runny. Bad. My date didn't like her Italian pasta. She commented that it was a bit dry. That's why I can't give this place four stars.  Recommended.  Just watch what you order. It can get pricey quick."
