Celia E.,"Tacoma, WA",62,9,9,4.0,10/25/2013,"My husband, mother-in-law, and I ate here for the first time tonight.  It got off to a rough start due to the very long wait for a table (45 minutes!  Next time we're calling ahead!), but getting a free sample of pizza and the very nice lady at the front helped make up for it.  Once we were seated, we ordered the pumpkin ale, which was crisp, delicious, and refreshing, with just the right amount of pumpkin flavor.  Our server, Bri (short for Brianna, I asked her so I could make sure I got the right spelling!) was very sweet and efficient.  She told us it was her second day, but she did a fantastic job. Originally this review was going to be three stars due to the wait for a table, the fact that the portions of food were very small for the price, and the fact that they brought my mother-in-law the wrong dish (she ordered the fish and chips, but was brought the shrimp and chips instead), but once we sampled the fish and the fries from my mother-in-law's plate (once they brought it out) ... well... WOW.  The fish was perfectly cooked, with just the right amount of batter and crispiness, and the fries were well-seasoned but not overly salty, and crispy.  All three of us agreed that it would be worth coming back just for the fish and chips, it was so amazing! I ordered the Hawaiian mahi-mahi, which was very tasty, but I wish that we'd ordered an appetizer or soup or salad as well, because it was very small.  However, it was packed full of flavor, and the fish itself was perfectly cooked. My husband tried the shrimp tacos, and he seemed to enjoy them immensely, though he said that the meal itself was not very filling, and it wouldn't be long before he was hungry again. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience, with good service, great beer, and good (though over-priced) food.  It would be worth it to visit again."
Dan C.,"Fort Leonard Wood, MO",40,40,34,4.0,7/6/2012,"Oh Washington how I missed you. My trip would've been perfect only if you would've rained.  But anyway, so Bjs is pretty cool. It's dark, the decorations are nice, they have a bar, its nicer than your normal chain restaurants.  We started out with the calimari, which came out crissspy. So good. I ordered shrimp tacos. It was  pretty good, enough shrimp but to me it seemed like that they just put slaw inside the tortillas. Weak right? But the best part about Bjs is the pizookie. Omg its been 6 months since the last time I had it, and when I got it, I just engulfed it. I'm not even kidding. So what the pizookie is a cookie, in this case I got the red velvet and there's no other flavor to go, but yes its a cookie with vanilla ice cream. You have no idea how good it is till you try it. Sigh... But our waiter heard that I came back and gave me 2 more pizookies. Yes I ate that too. Haha"
Martina N.,"Kent, WA",37,25,53,4.0,1/12/2015,"I like the food here. They have great Lunch specials. Depending on which location I am at the service varies but overall, I've been pretty satisfied with my food."
Chad R.,"Tacoma, WA",10,20,,3.0,1/31/2015,"This place was ""aight"". I have to say the service was very good but I think that had to do with the server we received. He was awesome and I wish I got his name but he was bald so we'll just call him ""Bald Guy"". ""Bald Guy"" was professional, offered menu options he liked, took our order and kept our glasses full. The food was kind of ""meh"" but it was not bad. The ambiance was nice and I like the look and feel of the place. Over all not a bad dining experience. I would go back for sure and try some more of their HUGE menu."
Alejandra C.,"Lakewood, WA",0,27,,4.0,5/7/2016,"Had an amazing experience in this restaurant, the waitress was also really friendly. Keep up the good work!"
Marcia T.,"Tacoma, WA",9,1,,5.0,7/31/2015,Went to the bar had good choices of beer. The potato skins were wonderful.  Had a great time.
Kristine A.,"Tacoma, WA",23,3,,1.0,12/15/2014,Terrible service. The hostess was no where to be seen so we sat ourselves in the lounge. Service staff makes eye contact but does not make any gestures to bring menus or come over to greet us. Waited 15 mins. and nothing. Walked out after speaking to the manager. She apologized and that was that. I have worked in the food service industry and that was just bullshit.
megan k.,"Pierce, WA",26,21,1,1.0,7/13/2013,"No Sir. Chef Ramsey would not approve. Never again.  Usually I give a place a second try at least but not here. Long service in the bar during a slow time. Got some strange boiled looking imposter chicken that tasted rank, abed lemony noodles. I left fully expecting to get sick. I think I had some fried eggrolls that weren't terrible. Which tells me this...on a menu with over 200 items that CAN NOT do any inhouse WELL. The only things that are good are the purchased pre-made frozen stuff."
Tami B.,"Tacoma, WA",31,15,9,4.0,7/26/2015,"After getting a few things in the Tacoma Mall my boyfriend who is originally from New York City and was stationed near Chicago while in the Navy, and I decided to try out BJ's. I am a Tacoma native and had never been before. We ordered the BJ's favorite Pizza and two house salads and soda to drink. The pizza was amazing the best deep dish we have had in Tacoma hands down. Well done BJ's. We will be sure to come again and keep trying out more things on your menu."
Marcus C.,"Puyallup, WA",1,3,,2.0,8/14/2013,"It's hard to write a review for this place because on one hand the interior of this place is high class and beautiful to look at and the service is top notch. It's just that the food most of the time isn't any damn good. The pizza is alright but flavorless. The steak is always consistently either burnt or under cooked. They have no idea how to make a good teriyaki. Their burgers are just alright. Even red robin does it better. The only thing I really liked here was their root beer. If they weren't consistently bad, i would give a better rating. But man. Never again! If you want to pay alot for good food, go to the Cheesecake Factory."
Cesar H.,"Gig Harbor, WA",18,1,,1.0,12/9/2014,"Arrived a little before 1pm my friend and I.  It wasn't busy, the place only 1/2 full. We waited 2 mins before being seated. Got menus and waited.   20 mins go by as we witnessed 3 different groups of people who arrived after us, get seated and get drinks as well. We never got any drinks,  in fact,  we were never approached by anyone.  We just up and left."
Heather W.,"Lacey, WA",0,19,7,4.0,4/11/2015,"Had Parmesan crusted chicken, very good. Others with me had a rib eye, cooked just right. Another had tacos, also tasty."
Nancy J.,"Gig Harbor, WA",15,2,1,5.0,11/21/2013,My husband & I had dinner at BJ's last night. Our dinners were both wonderful! I had the Pumpkin Ale with dinner. It was Delish! I loved it! Just read a review about BJ's 'small bites' located about mid menu for $3-5 each! Will definitely check those out next time!  We will definitely be back!
Emily S.,"Tacoma, WA",0,5,,1.0,3/9/2016,"Bj's has never disappointed me.... Until last night. My friend orders her usual some tortilla soup and bread bowl. The soup is supposed to have avocado in it. No avocado. I order a sandwich I believe was called a California something rather that also was supposed to have avocado on it. I get my sandwich half soggy and it has maybe a tablespoon of avocado on it. I had asked for ranch on the side when I placed my order and the order comes with no ranch. The guy who brought out our food was not our server and I asked nicely for ranch again and he goes ""it's coming"" that's it. I'm not expecting an apology but maybe ""oh yes it's on it's way"" would have been nice. We obviously like avocado. We didn't say anything to the waiter or ask for a manager because my friend and I have both worked in food so it's pointless to make a scene. But this disappointment made us not tip and Maybe next time if the establishment is running low on avocado or barely has any they  should let the customers know so we can pick something else to eat considering the menu is huge. We work all day and wanted a nice meal to eat but left not happy. Also to add to my rant my friend was up all night with food poisoning from the soup or bread bowl.. Hope management see's this one!"
Timothy D.,"San Diego, CA",87,22,4,5.0,10/18/2014,The food and beer selection is phenomenal and its taste great also.  First time here so my expectation was open.   It was good and ill definitely come back
Patricia G.,"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA",0,28,,3.0,11/15/2014,"Honestly, this restaurant was ok, nothing wow about it.  The service was great but for the cost of the meal for two it was disappointing. The food was just nothing new. I had the lasagna which was great husband had the chicken pasta and all the time we were there we wished we went to an Italian restaurant instead. If your looking for a younger or just appetizers this would be a great place to start. There was just no wow!"
Andre G.,"Seattle, WA",2,25,7,2.0,2/6/2016,"We came in for lunch and the first thing inside the door I noticed that  it smells like a 30 year old Dennys.   We were sat promptly and the service was quick and on point.   The first couple napkins that were brought out were pretty gross so our server brought clean ones out right away.    The food was good.  My wife had some tasty chicken and the bison burger was well seasoned.    The ""cole slaw"" could have used a bit of help though.   My overall complaint is that the place needs to be cleaned.   The tables, booths, partitions,  and most everything else is pretty nasty looking.   The bathrooms floors are sticky and it looks like some of the plumbing in the mens room is broken.   The atmosphere and money they charge should (in my opinion) warrent an upper scale dining experience.   It just seems to me that the folks working there don't care too much to maintain the place.    If they remodel or somehow deep clean the place I might come back."
Brenna L.,"Tacoma, WA",1,6,1,1.0,12/30/2015,"If I could give this place 0-1/2 a star I would. Did call ahead seating and was sat within 10 mins. But it took a good 30 mins before we were asked what we wanted to drink. Another 15 mins before we were asked what food we wanted. Once we ordered, we sat and waited over an hour for our food. After eating, we decided to order dessert (bad mistake). It took another 45 mins before we got 2 out of 3 of our desserts. Still sitting here waiting for our 3rd dessert. We have been here for almost 3 and a half total hours now. Worst restaurant experience my family and I have ever had. Don't eat here if you value your time."
Melinda P.,"Tacoma, WA",8,31,2,3.0,3/7/2014,"Giving this restaurant a 3, only because our server seemed flustered and looked like she was hungover.  Our food came before drinks and when we got our food she forgot who ordered what. Our server kept being bombarded with other customers near us because she messed up on their orders. Our plates were dirty and the table next to us had a coffee cup with lipstick on it. The waitress must have been so tired because she asked the old man's wife if she sipped from the cup. Then the waitress went on about how their dishwasher sucks. Yeah.. no bueno. But I will definitely go again."
S and e n.,"Tacoma, WA",5,21,3,1.0,4/19/2013,"The first couple times we went and the food was fine..  But the last two times we have been there has been a hair in our food...The first time they were very nice and gave us a voucher this second time we ordered a fried calamari appetizer and sent it back. The Manager came by and didn't even offer to comp our meal...I let him know this was the second time this had happened and all he did was shrug his shoulders. For Pete's sake put a hairnet on your line cooks! We will not be coming back here, as I wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen. Make sure to be on the lookout for thick black hairs in your food!"
