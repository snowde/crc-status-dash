Camaran T.,"Galveston, TX",9,7,1,2.0,6/20/2015,The two stars is for the service.  Food was great when it came. Waitress was preoccupied with something else. We got one refill each couldn't get her to refill after that. We order a pizza and a salad and took forever and it wasn't busy. She had two tables. Then in the middle of the meal she dropped the check still no offer for refills on ice teas when I was done I got attitude because I wanted dessert. That took exactly 22 minutes to get I timed it. The she was frustrated because she had to redo our check. Probably won't be going back. Like I said food is good but I don't need attitude when I dine
Sarah P.,"University Place, WA",36,11,2,4.0,3/24/2015,"I first visited BJs because of their pizookies but it's now become one of my favorite restaurant around Tacoma. While it is slightly overpriced, the lunch menu is worth it. Their apps are great along with their shrimp scampi, crispy jalapeno burger, California chicken club, and broccoli cheddar bread bowl. While the food is great, I once waited an hour for entrees; the manager gave us the meal for free but still, service could be improved."
Tania M.,"Astoria, OR",0,13,1,4.0,2/25/2015,"This is a solid place of choice for me and my husband when going out to eat. Their menu is big enough to venture out, and get something different every time. Food is overall good, although some times their burgers and pizzas can be amazing or down right mediocre! DO NOT get any appetizers, it is a waste of money, and they always disappoint. Now the service is a hit or miss! We have had some AMAZING customer service, even when it's packed, but there are a few waiters who are not very good. They are intrusive and sometimes just look down right annoyed with anything you might need. I do love their reward points and we use them to get some good discount, or a free desert! Overall not too bad!"
Brenda G.,"Portland, OR",10,1,,1.0,6/12/2015,"Met with some friends at B. J'S YESTERDAY and had a very poor experience.  Ordered the grilled Majin fish tacos. Pictured on the menu with a side of salsa and a side of guacamole.   You'd think that it would come somewhat like the menu photo.  I was especially looking forward to the guacamole.   It came with neither.   When I asked the server about it,  she brought salsa only. Asked again for the guacamole like it was pictured.   She made no offers of a substitute.  She was rude and surly.   I can't see myself going back.  The beer my husband ordered was nothing special, and he usually enjoys micro brews."
Thorsten F.,"Tacoma, WA",2,9,1,1.0,7/15/2014,"Ok.  I generally don't like to trash restaurants.  But I just had the worst experience at BJ's at Tacoma Mall.  I've dined here several times, and I've always left happy.  Yesterday I went with my wife, we started with a drink each.  I ate the olives and pepper from her Bloody Mary, and I swear the pepper was almost rotten.  My drink sucked.  It took too long to get our food.  It wasn't that busy, there were several open tables.  Not sure if they were understaffed. I ordered my steak medium, it was rare.  My wife ordered her ribeye medium well, it was cooked to the consistency of an old leather shoe.  My side arrived late 5 min after my food arrived.  I wish I could get my $75 back.  I told my wife I'll never return.   I would not even give it 1 star, but I have to."
Lydia P.,"Port Orchard, WA",14,150,5,1.0,6/24/2013,Terrible service! We sat in the bar and waited 15 minutes before someone brought menus over. Took another 5 for him to take order and another 10 to get our drinks.  Expensive and not worth it at all!
Kseniya O.,"Tacoma, WA",63,86,57,1.0,12/11/2015,"If you have a child do NOT go here. Matter of fact if you want good service do NOT go here. Took 20 minutes to get our beverages and then received one entree at a time. Upon our entire party eating their meal BUT myself, our waitress asked how everything was tasting. I told her I would love to be tasting something and gave her a hungry stare.. Received my pizza after everyone was done. Due to me now eating alone my party ordered another beverage to hold them over while I eat my dinner. After I finished my meal the waitress proceeded to once again ask how everything was going to which we informed her that the drinks weren't there so is she asking how our conversation is going or what? She brought the drinks and receipt together.. Don't bring a receipt on three different occasions unless we ask for it.. My son wants dessert. Waited 20 minutes to catch the waitress and then 20 more to receive it.. We came here at 5 left at 730... With a toddler this was pure torture. Children don't wait that long and I only had enough activities to cover an hour and a half tops. Very irritating to watch your server standing fraternizing while you're waiting to place orders and enjoy your dinner experience. Unless you have hours to kill and don't want anything on your table while you wait- avoid this place. Had to go to the bar myself to ask for my mothers beverage. Finally, to conclude this experience, everything dirty on the table remained on the table the entire 21/2 hours. Why not clear the dirty dishes when you pass the table 20 times? Why must I start putting things on the floor because I have no table space to put my elbows while I wait ? Had better service before so I'm hoping this was an issue with the waitress and not establishment because it's definitely unpleasant to have the waitress walk away after taking one order and there's 4 other people..."
Lacacia C.,"Tacoma, WA",22,28,14,3.0,9/7/2014,"SO inconsistent with customer service. I don't know if it's the management,  but we usually have a pretty good meal and anything from awesome to awful service. The last time we were in was the worst, our server forgot to put our order in and then lied about it. It was so lame. But usually we have the same server and he always gets our order right, in fast and out fast. Hosts are always A+ and when I order drinks they're usually good. The bathrooms might be stocked or missing toilet paper, paper towels and seat covers. It's sad because we really love the pizza and will put up with this but I want to give them more stars especially since it's so close to home. We come here about 1-2 times a month and I have NEVER seen a manager on the floor, I think more presence in the restaurant might help the service problem."
Smaly K.,"Tacoma, WA",110,418,1541,5.0,9/12/2011,"One of my favorite restaurants...great portions and great prices.  Every time my cousins want to get together for dinner, this is our spot.  All of us are always satisfied with our orders.  I've tried many of the menu items, and everything tastes good.  My favorite is the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp.  I always add the crushed chili pepper flakes...tastes really good!  And for dessert, the Beignet is delicious!"
D.J. Y.,"Shoreline, WA",356,948,826,3.0,1/21/2011,"Interesting place, I like the interior, and I like the fact they have a really nice number of choices on the menu for my vegge-head oldest.  The baked potatoes are totally cray-cray in size and at lunch being able to add a wedge salad for $1 was a nice touch.   If you are into sports this place has a HUGE 8 screen tv over the bar that can either have 8 different programs on or transformed into a single MEGA screen, which everyone in the place can see without much problem, heck I could see it just fine without my glasses.   Additionally each corner of the restaurant has decent size tv screens for your viewing pleasure.  It is a bit loud in there with the high ceilings and open floor design but you can still conduct a conversation with those at your table without too much effort.  This chain tries hard to deliver, and I like that. We've visited twice, once for dinner and the other for lunch, same menu with several ""lunch"" specials being offered.  Dinner service was extremely slow not sure if it was the kitchen or our server, I was leaning toward our server as it took forever to bring us water.  Lunch service was attentive and friendly, well actually both servers were equally friendly. 3 Yelp stars because the food is just okay in flavor.  At lunch I had a Turkey, avocado, BLT, it was decent enough, but they use some kind of pre-made ""salad"" dressing, similar to Miracle Whip, which I detest.  It seems to be the base of their Blue Cheese dressing which didn't sit well with my Mom either, she had the wedge salad.  Dinner the burger was decent but the fries were cold, it didn't help that our server never came back until we were basically finished. Haven't tried the pizza yet, had it at the Portland Oregon location many moons ago, will try again and update my review.  Dessert.... one word PIZOOKIE!!  Imagine, cookie pizza ala mode...OMG....  Beignet? Meh....tasted like baked pizza crust... It's a solid choice, I mean it's at a mall after all...."
Cody G.,"Federal Way, WA",12,47,7,4.0,12/18/2014,"I love BJs, this location kind of sucks because it's attached to the mall but I've never received bad service or unsatisfactory food here or any of their other locations. Their brand of beer is VERY hit or miss, the stout tastes like water and the Hefeweizen does too so definitely go with a known brand of beer but other than that it's a great place."
Kurt M.,"Tacoma, WA",0,28,6,1.0,11/5/2012,"Had the Lunch Special Mahi Mahi Taco's. Asked for the char-grilled and not deep-fried fish. What I got was fish jerky in a tortilla. When I complained to the waitress, she explained they baked the fish and they always got dry and hard. She did apologize that I did not like it but explained that is how they always did it. Never  will I eat there again."
Delilah R.,"Seattle, WA",139,451,56,4.0,11/9/2010,"I am a HUGE fan of BJ's. Along with some fabulous innuendos, this place comes with a good time and some laughs as well as super tasty food.  The Good:  The pizza!! All I can say for starters is NOM NOM NOOOOOOM. This reminds me of the kind of pizza we had as kids, circa 1985-ish. The crust is flaky on the outside and slightly doughy within. Any pie you try is loaded with chunks of veggies and meat. There's no layer of grease on top or below the pizza and one to two pieces will leave your tummy set for the night. I can honestly say this is a five star pie. Go with the Classic Combo for starters or the Hawaiian style. You'll fall head over heels.  OK, on account of my taste buds feigning some heat I'd steer clear of ordering the jambalaya again. It lacked spice and to be real, flavor.  If you like Root beer or Cream Soda, you will LOVE their variations. Delish. Try the root beer float for dessert. Very yummy!!  I've had many of their sandwiches and I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner. The pazookie is not down my alley. That's their ""special house"" dessert. It's just not my style...but if you like an overly soft, humongous cookie, order it and give it a go.  My BF and I are going to try every pizza off the menu. I'm pumped."
April M.,"Tacoma, WA",4,24,15,4.0,9/7/2013,"My sister and I come here a bit either for lunch or happy hour. The food is pretty good and I love the watermelon and feta salad. I have went more than a few times this summer just to get that salad. The drinks are always strong and good. Service is not all of that, but the food and drinks make up for it."
Kisela M.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,,4.0,2/21/2015,"Let me talk about the chicken tortilla soup - one word; DELISH!!! I was under the weather and wanted something that wasn't creamed base or overwhelming for an upset tummy. The chicken tortilla soup was so flavorful with each spoonful; cilantro, a little heat. The only problem was I ordered the bowl portion and it seemed not enough; I wanted more! I can't imagine how much you would get in a cup size. Besides the portion size, I would order this again and again! If you order as a main dish, I'd suggest ordering a side salad."
Homar M.,"Charleston, SC",40,122,94,4.0,10/10/2014,"No bad place for groups, beer is decent but the variety no so great. The food was served quick and the service was on point. The menu is not as varied, just few options, but the food taste good. I think you should visit just for the beer..."
Rob G.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,2.0,12/29/2014,"Everyone has an off day, but I must say the last four times I have visited the lack service continues to surprise me. It's not that there is not enough staff, some of them just do not care about customer service or don't know what to do. No need to go into details about the poor service, which does include the bar and kitchen staff. But let's just say, while they are busy, they need to pay attention to what they are doing. And find a better time to catch up on their social chit chat.  While I will try to be a patron, the family is ready to give up after our last busy"
Jenny D.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,3,,1.0,5/11/2014,Waited 15 min to be seated when it was less than 30% full. Table was so sticky that I had to ask it to be wiped. Waitress spilled water all over my son. Sevice was VERY slow and the food was bland. The group seated next to us cancelled their dessert order because they had waited so long and was clearly upset. People seemed nice enough but this will be our one and only visit here.
Peter R.,"Gig Harbor, WA",4,13,,1.0,6/29/2015,"My GF and I went to BJ's yesterday evening after doing some Tacoma Mall shopping - Its been a pretty good place most of the time in the past and the wings have always been pretty good -Well first off they were completely out of wings ! on a Sunday ? really ? how horrible is that for a customer to have to deal with .We decided we would make the most of our visit as to not be a complainer so we ordered the appetizer Club Pizza a $10.00 item that had no sauce ,was ice cold and lacking in anything resembling toppings ! Horrible - to make matters worse we got an order of fried Brussel sprouts instead of the stuffed mushrooms we ordered - they were horrible as well ,finally our stuffed mushrooms arrived after 10 more minutes of waiting and I will give them kudos for those they were warm and tasty. The server was nice but inexperienced as usual as this place seems to have a revolving door for employees. This pisses me off because we could have gone anywhere we wanted to for dinner and we went to BJ's for wings witch they didn't even have .Shame on you BJ's !!  My GF and I will NEVER go there again .EVER!  and to top it off with 3 beers it cost us $45.00  .that's a smack in the face . see ya"
Alan T.,"Tacoma, WA",48,20,21,1.0,11/24/2013,"This is my third time here....with my family too including the kiddos. I'm tired of being financially profiled here.  First 2 times I was thinking....maybe they just didn't realize there was a priority of seating people. Or maybe the waiters just have orders they need to get to for other tables before were greeted. Buy I have come to realize that this consistency is due to this facility treating different people differently. I always play well, I tip great, and me and my family are super friendly.  Profiling people is not the way to keep a loyal customer base. This is bad joojoo. Maybe other people have different experiences here. But as for me...3 strikes means your out.  Paxil"
