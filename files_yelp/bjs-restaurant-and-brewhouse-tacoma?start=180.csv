K.c. O.,"Tacoma, WA",0,7,,3.0,8/7/2014,"I have to come here quite often; my boyfriend and my best friend love BJ's. Let me start off by saying that I have never had anything that tasted badly, which is sating a lot, I've had many of their menu items.  Food: Greasy, full-flavored, and unique seems to be what they go for. The various ""egg rolls"" on the app menu are pretty good. In my opinion, the buns for the burgers are soggy and gross, but the burgers themselves are quite good.  Drinks: If you're not there for happy hour or any other discounted alcohol time (half price wine on Tuesdays!) DO NOT GET DRUNK HERE. The alcohol prices are completely ridiculous. That being said, their special fruity cocktails are always yummy.  Service: Completely hit or miss. Sometimes we get a professional server, and other times a young brat, but I don't really care about that.  Decor: This place is beautiful! They have gopd lighting, lots of wood, traditional American art, and these round booth things that are super dope!  I don't hate coming here, but my eyes probably roll when my lover suggests BJ's yet again."
Beth M.,"Waddell, AZ",319,31,187,2.0,5/22/2013,"Incredibly slow wait staff and kitchen this visit. It was not packed.  We got right in.   2 hours for a meal which consisted of an app, a pizza, an entree salad, and a kids cheeseburger is ridiculous.   We've had more negative experiences than positive at this particular location."
Mylynn D.,"Graham, WA",16,29,22,4.0,6/30/2013,"Loved everything about this place!! great costumer service, the beers were great....DON'T FORGET the BURGERS!! Soooo Delicious. Definitely a must go."
Julia C.,"University Place, WA",3,48,6,4.0,7/12/2014,Customer service usually great. Food is amazing and they have nice portions that actually leaves u filling full. Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken is awesome.  Dessert also yummy too.
K S.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,11,2,2.0,1/23/2016,This used to be one of our favorite places to go for happy hour. Since the first of the year they have taken the pizzas and other items off. So now we rarely go there for happy hour even though they have good pizzas there are other places that also have good food.
Laurie H.,"Springtown, TX",6,95,41,5.0,7/1/2014,"We love to order the large  appetizer sampler, it's perfect and goes great with the beer sampler.  The avocado egg rolls are my favorite, very unique and consistently good! Love the atmosphere and location!"
Jessica P.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,1,1.0,7/11/2015,BJ's really suck now . They started off good but now it's like they don't care. I ordered the gourmet Mac and cheese and there was no freakin cheese. It's like they just put one drop in the middle and topped it off with bacon. I'm so done with this place.
Danielle H.,"Boise, ID",0,10,,4.0,1/3/2015,"The food was quite good and reasonably priced. The service was slow and if you want water, good luck."
Lisa J.,"Lakewood, WA",0,3,,1.0,2/23/2014,"The worst place to eat. I went there last night, took over a hour to get a appetizer!! The only reason I got my appetizer is in a hour, is because I had to get my server attention!! His attention was on the table behind me, they got their drinks and meal, and bill before I got my appetizer!! The food was awful and service was worse!!! Unless you have 2 hours to wait or you are younger than 20 years, you will be okay."
Nancy C.,"Steilacoom, WA",292,21,15,1.0,4/11/2015,"So we were craving deep dish when we were in Paradise at the base of Mt. Rainier. we drive all the way to BJs in the rain only to get greeted by a lackluster gal who did speak clearly. she didn't fully enunciate her words. There were 3 servers behind her just bs'ing. I saw close to 6 open tables, none that looked like they were for large parties (not adjacent). she said 10 minutes to seat 2. but there were empty tables. she seemed disinterested in us or maybe we looked dirty. either way, my money pays the same. she mumbled about the bar area so there we went. The table was tiny and this server guy walked up and made. comment about this being his other job. so there we go on a pointless conversation because he says he doesn't have any other job than that one. His hair looked disheveled and dirty but u k we he spent 40 minutes to get it to look like that. His smug attitude and disingenuous demeanor were off putting enough for us to leave. I don't think they cared at all we left."
Jane D.,"Seattle, WA",5,11,2,1.0,2/23/2014,One of the worst service experiences we have experienced in a long time. Servers acted flustered and confused. This place needs new management. We will not be back. What a waste of 2 hours that we will never get back.
Shauna M.,"Bonney Lake, WA",48,42,9,4.0,6/18/2014,"I'm much  happier with service at this location then with the Puyallup one. During happy hour, they have awesome martinis and mojitos! They also have super cheap appetizers. We usually just order a bunch of appetizers instead of real meals. The chicken skewers are great, as are the spring rolls, hot wings, and pot stickers. really, I've been happy with every meal I've ever ordered here! it can be crazy busy though, so I don't typically go there for dinner."
Richard K.,"Tacoma, WA",32,78,46,3.0,7/2/2014,And we decided that we wanted to go out and get something eat as a group of six and this was the most convenient place as it was located close to us and it was decently priced. I know this because I have been there previously and enjoyed my experience as well as a atmosphere. However this time wasn't too impressive as of the restaurant was completely dead and upon entering we were not greeted nor were we sat promptly. The food however seems to be consistent along with the drinks and the staff or friendly once we got to our table. I would say this is a pretty typical American-style restaurant.
Michelle C.,"Tacoma, WA",31,19,2,4.0,6/19/2014,"Bomb!  Great food, service and ambiance!"
Mike C.,"Tacoma, WA",0,8,2,1.0,4/27/2014,Terrible service and mediocre cold food. My thirteen year old son likes this place and wanted to go here for his birthday. Had to wait 25 minutes for a table of 6 in a half full dining room. 15 minutes at the table and the server finally takes our drink order and asks if we need more time to look at the menus. Another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Had to take silverware from a nearby table because we only got 4 sets and no server around ask for more. Food was cold when it finally came. Go here if you don't value your time and are looking for just Ok food.
Chris S.,"Tacoma, WA",4,60,1,3.0,5/23/2013,"I love the food while I am eating it.  However, I have been sick twice after eating here.  Unfortunately for my stomach, the avocado spring rolls are too good and no one else makes anything like them so i will continue to come back.   Their beer is not nearly as good as a lot of other places in the area like The Ram or the Harmon though."
Jay W.,"Tacoma, WA",8,41,1,2.0,2/11/2012,"Great food, but that's about it. The service is just terrible. The menu is overpriced. They rarely get your order right... as you can tell, I am not a fan of BJ's. We go here (unfortunately) because my girlfriend is a huge fan of their pizza (admittedly, I am too) but I still cringe every time she suggests it.  To start, I can think of at least 3 separate occasions where we asked for a high chair for our 2 year old and ended up sitting with him at the bench seat because they did not bring one. Not to mention we always seem to get 2-3 different people waiting on us per visit - seems a little bizarre.  Now the food - don't get me wrong, it's reallllllly good. The problem is that they rarely get things right. I'm not much of a finicky eater - just give me meat and cheese and im set - but my gf is allergic to things and only eats specific things (a waiter's nightmare, I know!) They, of course, don't seem to understand this concept. When we order a pizza WITH something added, we never get it - and have to request it a 2nd or 3rd time. When we order a pizza WITHOUT something, you can bet it's there.  On top of all this, it's astronomically priced. I believe we were told it was what, $6 to add chicken to a pizza? Seriously??? ... and that's if they even remember to put it on! On top of all this, I rarely ever get more than a single drink refill when I order refillable drinks instead of beers. All that, and I've never had a bill from there that was UNDER $50. WOW. What a rip-off.   My preferred way of eating BJ's pizza is from my home, in the left-overs box, when someone else paid for it.  Imagine how much pizza you could get at Cloverleaf or PSP for $50 - with the correct toppings - and less brain-dead service!"
Nora K.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,1,3.0,11/21/2014,"The pizza was good, the service was quick, and  those pizokies are delicious!!!! The one bad thing was the greater at the door.  She was very rude and dismissive."
Elyssa D.,"Augusta, GA",73,120,32,4.0,11/3/2012,Who needs dinner when you have a pizookie? I have eaten here for lunch and dinner and my favorite thing to eat was the soup and sandwhich combo they have for lunch. But I mainly go here for that warm cookie topped with ice cream! They even have a sampler where you get 3 smaller cookies to try.
C P.,"Tacoma, WA",127,228,93,2.0,1/9/2012,"Well, gave this place another shot. I ordered the sausage/garlic deep dish pizza and the other one got a bleu burger. He specifically asked it medium rare.  Low and behold, food comes out and the burger is well done. Told the waitress that it was well done, she just said ""ok"" and went to the back. So neither one of us thought she went to the manager about the well done burger. One of the bartenders came over and I told him about it. He walks to the back and a manager walked up. She tells us that BJ's was going to comp the burger.  I'm glad that they comped the burger but seems every time we got there, something always goes wrong at this place."
