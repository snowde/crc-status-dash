Syth T.,"Tacoma, WA",2,12,,2.0,6/14/2013,"Took a while to get seated despite the half full capacity, though that might have been because it was at a switch over time between Day shift and night shift. We had the deep fried avocado eggroll appetizers, which were in a word: weird. On the one hand it was an interesting application as avocado typically isn't served warm. But the sundried tomato and pinenuts didn't really add much to the dish. The dipping sauce was some sort of brown sugary concoction that I didn't recall seeing in the menu description. Didn't really pair well. For dinner I had the Angus Pot Roast sandwich, or rather that's what I order but I got the Angust Pot Roast dinner. Not a big deal but I was pretty clear in what I ordered. The meat and potatoes were great, but I recognize the meat as a pre-made product or something very similar to it, so no credit there. My main gripe was with the ""oven roasted vegetables"" that came with it. Not sure what they were thinking serving carrots that had sat on the line so long they got that chalky white surface appearance. Especially when it's paired with onion quarters that have been cooked so little they not only have no caramelization typical of oven roasting. But celery sticks that look more at home on a chicken wing appetizer. No kidding, they were just cut in thirds celery sticks that you dip into ranch in between shitty fried chicken. Both celery and onions were so under cooked and raw I had to borrow my girlfriends steak knife to cut the things. I'm not expecting much from what equates to a bar version of an Applebee's, not much at all really, it was in the area we were shopping and were starving. But for a 45 dollar tab for two with no booze I expect a bit more professionalism out of  a place that has an army sized kitchen staff. Step up your game guys."
Misty M.,"Tacoma, WA",45,144,5,1.0,4/9/2011,"Never again. Never ever EVER again.  It's been over two years since the BJ's debacle happened the first time. I was absolutely craving one of their sandwiches last night so I begrudgingly convinced myself to give them another shot. There's tons of room for improvement in two years right? Apparently not. Are you freaking KIDDING me? We arrived at 10:50, not like I usually keep an eye on the time but I was worried they closed at 11, not so! We were in the clear because they close at midnight on the weekends. Whew! A man named Bill seated us and we looked through our menus. The place was pretty dead so we figured this would be a quick in and out deal.  Nope. After 20 minutes we got up and left, no one EVER came to our table to help us, no one even acknowledged our existence. It's not like we were seated in bumhumpegypt either, we were right next to a table of nine that was done eating.  I asked to speak with a manager and I must say, the server that got the manager for me was prompt and handled it well. She never gave me an attitude, and I wish I caught her name because she was extremely nice to me.   Bill was apparently the one who was the MOD for the night and the way he handled the situation was almost like he had no idea how to handle a calm and angry/disappointed patron. I wasn't after free food, I just wanted the hell out, but it's almost like he didn't know what to say. I told him that this was the second time that I've had service like this and it was completely unacceptable and he needed to know how his restaurant was being run. The fact that there are now customers that are extremely happy with the food but fed up with being ignored just isn't OK. After I finished he did offer to serve me himself. I told him thanks for the offer but I was completely turned off to the restaurant and felt it was more appropriate to leave. Never. Again.  Ignoring customers is just bad. Especially when we give you guys two and three chances to make it better."
Lauren J.,"Federal Way, WA",4,25,1,5.0,12/9/2013,"Amazing happy hour, wonderful bartender. I was asking a lot of questions because I'm not a meat eater, and he helped accommodate all of my needs. Then, he answered all my drinks about their extensive beers/ciders on tap. I can't wait to come back, and I tell all my friends their HH is a hidden treasure."
L. L.,"Tacoma, WA",13,79,,4.0,12/3/2013,Fun place to go for groups.  Food is very good and and it is lively without being loud.
Khristian V.,"Olympia, WA",113,133,17,3.0,2/11/2012,"I will keep this short since I have already did a review. BJ's still provides great service and has the friendliest bar staff and wait staff. The food is alright, and the beer selection is broad and likely to please any palate.  But last time we went to BJ's for lunch, my salad was pretty alright, until I got under the top layer of nice lettuce.. The bottom of my salad was all old, brown, tiny pieces of lettuce as if I literally got the bottom of the barrel. Ewww. Also, they do not take reservations, but you can call ahead to get in line on the weekend."
Judy M.,"Tacoma, WA",21,224,25,4.0,4/30/2012,"I have to admit I didn't really like BJs when I first tried it at Southcenter.  But, like an ugly boyfriend, who is attentive, and has good credit, it's grown on me.   I take that back, it's more than grown on me.  It's pretty good.  I'm not just saying that because I live in Tacoma and our dining options are limited, because I travel for food.  Yes, indeed.  I actually like the tuna tartare which is often difficult to get at a good establishment.  The tuna is not the greatest cut, but it's decent.  It does, however, have great acidity, sesame oil, yum and yum. The tomato, mozarella salad is pretty tasty, too.  I also liked the pork sliders, parmesan crusted chicken, pizza, and beignets are good.  Oh, don't forget this peach cocktail they have.  Yum!"
Renee C.,"Vashon, WA",21,17,1,3.0,12/14/2012,"I've been 3 times, not good not bad.   About half the foods been good, the Cobb is very good.  One time I got the baked potato, thinking entree potato. What I got was a plate with a bare potato and a teeny square of sour cream and butter. The potato was so completely overlooked it was inedible.  The fish and chips I got instead; fish good, fries adequate.  The desserts have all been very good, rich, amply sized treats.  Very sweet. That might be the ticket, it's a fine place for a dessert and coffee.  The climate control could use some work, stuffy or cold seem to be the settings. I'm sure we will go back, since the location is convenient."
Leah B.,"Indio, CA",21,3,1,1.0,11/10/2014,"I too had a problem with the hostess. When we checked in for lunch we were told it would be a 15-20 min wait. They give you a buzzer, and there was no seating in the waiting area, so we took our two small children outside to wait. The buzzer never went off, but after 15 minutes we came back inside the restaurant. The hostess told us she had just called us, could we wait 5 more minutes. 15 minutes later we still hadn't gotten a table so I asked the hostess if she still had us on our list. She said she did, but there were still a few other people ahead of me. I asked her how that could be, 15 minutes ago she had said she had just called my name. She said, ""yes, but when you didn't come up to the desk in time I had to move you to the bottom of the list!"" TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST! I couldn't believe it. Furious I took my family next door to the Blazing Onion. I don't think it is at all appropriate to be bumped to the bottom of the list, if we had missed our table we would have happily waited for the next available, but the hostess was giving them to other groups who had checked in long after us. Very disappointed!"
Low C.,"Tacoma, WA",21,20,,2.0,3/26/2014,"Uninspired, chain restaurant food. Waitress was way out of her league handling customers. Food was the same as Applebee's , TGIFridays, and ruby Tuesday . The night we were there, the place was swamped with school kids and a staff that was around the same age."
Allison D.,"Bellingham, WA",11,2,,2.0,6/30/2013,"BJ's advertised as having a gluten-free menu, but on arrival the only item advertised as gluten free was the thin crust cheese pizza.  When we asked if the grilled pork chop was made with wheat, the waitress said, ""oh, you can have the balsamic chicken, it's our only gluten free entree.""  The balsamic chicken was dry, served on top of wilted but raw greens, DVD the balsamic glaze was sweetened.  The salad was made with romaine that was not cut fresh, but probably shipped pre-cut in a plastic bag, and the burgers were dry.  I do recommend the thin and crispy fries; they were the only thing I enjoyed.  They do brew their own iced tea.  At the end of the meal, we were hurried out of the restaurant to make space for a large party, who had been ushered into the dining room before their table was ready.  All in all, I'd rather go to Red Robin."
Cherish K.,"Sahuarita, AZ",35,22,2,2.0,2/23/2011,"The food is awesome but the service is pretty bad. My first visit, the waitress got mad cause we asked for a booth and kept slamming our plates down on the table. I finally asked her what was wrong and she went off on us... I stopped her in a firm but friendly way and told her to get her manager before she got herself in trouble. The manager apologized and gave us a free dessert. The waitress came back and slammed that on the table too... i promptly called the manager over who ended up giving us our meal for free. At this point I refused the free meal just in case the manager thought we might be exaggerating and trying to get a free meal. I wanted it very clear...this waitress had issues. I wrote the corporate office and never received a response. A couple months later, I went back. At first, the service was good. I received my meal..the food was delicious. I gave the waitress my credit card and she disappeared for a long time. I finally waved down another waitress to get our waitress and when she returned she sheepishly told me she lost my credit card. Grrrrr I asked for the manager who asked me if i had another way to pay. I told her no...charge it on the credit card you lost. Then I left. I called the next day to see if they found my credit card and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. I ended up ordering a new credit card. I again wrote the corporate office and never got a response.   Three months later, I went again because I'm demented. The waitress service was better but we waited forever for our food and then it was food we had not ordered. We sent it back. We waited another 15 minutes and asked for the manager who apologized and left. We waited another 15 minutes and asked for the manager again. The same manager came back and apologized and left. After waiting for an additional 15 minutes, we decided to leave and on the way, we waved at the manager who acted like he couldn't see us."
Don M.,"Seattle, WA",31,98,54,4.0,3/11/2012,"So here we go....  Tonight started off rough. My friend was planning on having her bday here. We called ahead and spoke to the manager. She informed us that they do not do reservations. She said we should call ahead and come in early. So we did and the 30 minutes she quoted us turned into 1 hour and 45 minutes. WTF??? We asked how come the time jumped so much? She informed us that they had taken a lot of reservations. Apparently you can make a reservation if you have 10 or more people. Thanks for the info dumb-ass we had a party of 12. Lucky for BJs the numbskull management some how was able to hire excellent servers to make up for their shortcomings. Our server was Kelly and she was fantastic. She made my beer sampler just how I wanted it ( this is usually against the rules) she got all the different bills right, made change, and dealt with us drunkards with a smile on her face. Way to go Kelly you turned a 1 star review into a 4 star. Maybe Kelly should be manager. Just saying."
Tigris W.,"Tacoma, WA",4,37,1,5.0,10/1/2014,Great staff.  Very attentive. Good food there as well ESPECIALLY the gluten free pizza. This is a treat for me.  Great place for business meeting lunch or happy hour or pre-movie.
Jim S.,"Tacoma, WA",35,28,1,3.0,5/21/2012,"Was in a party of 6, plus a 5 month old.  The staff was friendly and the service was good.  We all had the deep dis pizza and the food was great.  The wine was average and the ambiance was so-so.   Our waitress was really attentive and cared that we were all taken care of.  The challenge I have with BJ's is that it feels like another sports bar.  It seems to work for them as it was full of folks enjoying a Sunday evening. I mentioned the pizza was good, but I will say on prior occasions, we have found other food to be just mediocre, or in some cases (like the burgers), the food was lacking.  We would tend to go 2 blocks to Red Robin for a burger."
Justin H.,"Federal Way, WA",6,39,5,1.0,4/25/2012,"1st visit was a long wait for a GROSSLY over-seasoned burger. I tried something else here on my 2nd visit, but it was so boring I've honestly forgotten what it was that I ate. Pros = nice waitress"
Rich X.,"Seattle, WA",38,92,4,4.0,4/10/2013,Man oh man what can i say about this place? I went with my girl and i ordered the balsamic chicken while she ordered the country fried steak. She was blown away that my chicken tasted good cause she doesnt like vinegar. Probably one of the best balsamic chickens I had in my life. Her country fried steak wasn't super amazing but it was low on grease and had amazing crunch to juice meat ratio. The service was also super nice and gave us a nice plate of dipping sauces for our wings =D Definitely should come and try some good american food! Definitely beats applebees lol
Jee H.,"Puyallup, WA",6,137,31,3.0,3/24/2011,"A group of us from the office went to BJ's for a birthday lunch and we arrived about 12:15ish.  We were a party of 7 and called ahead of time to ensure that there would be a table.  We were seated right away and our server immediately took our beverage order.   After returning with drinks, Amelia took our lunch order.  The wait was a bit longer than I had anticipated but it was also during a busy lunch hour.  Our food arrived and one of my co-workers had a Cobb Salad.  She ALWAYS get the Cobb and remarked that Red Robin's Cobb is better.  My boss had some kind of burger resembling a patty melt and he said it was yummy.  My other coworker had a gluten free pizza w/ red sauce, artichokes and something else...she LOVED her dish.   Me?  I had their black cherry soda (pretty tasty) and their balsamic chicken w/ caramelized onions, arugula and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  It was pretty good but the portion was huge.  I barely ate half of my food and took the rest home.  My meal including tax was $17.16 -- more than what I usually pay for lunch.  Since I was also able to get dinner out of it, I guess it was ok. Amelia was friendly and attentive but nothing extraordinary.   I would go back but I'm not dying to go in the next week or two."
Kathy B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,4,1,5.0,9/13/2013,BJs can be one of the best place to go inTacoma!!!  Fantastic menu... Good prices and the food???  Simply wonderful!!! Oh. Fantastic service .... It earns a 5 star review in every aspect .. You won't be disappointed !!!
Pamela G.,"Tucson, AZ",2,70,6,4.0,3/11/2015,"Love the brews and the food is pretty good too. Great fish and chips too. Casual, lots of tvs with various sports shows. Nice atmosphere."
Marcolina V.,"Tacoma, WA",14,3,,4.0,3/2/2014,Food is amazing! I always save room for some pazooki. I love the atmosphere but the service isn't spectacular. Every time my husband and I go to bjs we are barely greeted at the front and our server always seems to forget my refill or not check on os as often as they should. But I also don't see a lot of support from any managers when I am there.
