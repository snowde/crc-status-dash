Cindy H.,"Tacoma, WA",0,94,10,3.0,9/10/2012,"When is it never busy? Geez.  Anyway, been here 4-5 times. Not impressed until this last time.  Wait was short, and the clam chowder AMAZING.  Yes, I can say this as we had chowder on the waterfront the same week (at 3 times the price) and BJs wins by far.  Saw platters go by of ENORMOUS sandwiches.....maybe next time. BTW keep the screaming kids at home, 'kay?"
Kelly R.,"Tacoma, WA",1,8,,1.0,4/5/2014,"My daughter and I have pizza every Saturday, we are on a constant search for the best pizza in the world, and so we stopped here. A 35 minute wait time is acceptable for us on a Saturday night, so no problem there. But the pizza was awful. No red sauce at all. wtf. It was dough, with cheese, and cubed tomatoes and we got half pepperoni and half ham and pineapple.  I like marinara sauce, in face I believe it is vital to have it on a pizza. If there was a ten commandments of Pizza, number one would be ""PUT MARANARA SAUCE ON THE PIZZA"". Nope, not here. I ate one slice, my daughter had a half of a slice. The bill was $25, we left $35 including the tip, and brought the box home. my wife usually grazes the fridge when she gets home from work, but didn't touch this pizza. How do she know? Anyhow, we consider ourselves experts on pizza in Tacoma. Lets face it, there are a lot of pizza's around here, some of it is very very good. But BJ's came in last. Costco had better pizza, Domino's had better. I left a good tip, because the staff was good, and the beer was tasty. The décor was awesome, nicely designed, There were TV's everywhere if you wanted to watch the game.  But this pizza was disappointing, and that is what really mattered to us. .  Hansome, and the Boss."
Aj T.,"Olalla, WA",6,185,73,4.0,10/8/2013,Great beer and wine selection. service is usually pretty good even when they get busy. the menu is very diverse and their drink menu is unusual.
Bill N.,"Auburn, WA",35,263,,4.0,5/16/2011,"I have been to the Tacoma Mall BJ's twice and the Southcenter one 3 or 4 times.   I have always gotten great food and great service.   This time I had a grilled sourdough burger with the steak fries.  The fries weren't the best but really liked the burger.  Joe had a gluten free thin crust pizza that was not very good.   But it was the ""healthy"" pizza so that is what we should have expected.  Jess had a great pulled pork sandwich.  The boys had the rootbeer and creme sodas that were really really good.  I had the Nut Brown Ale which I will definitely have again.  I remember having their dark beer before and not liking it.  I will now stick with their nut brown.    Did not have an appetizer this time but I am a big fan of their avocado egg rolls that everyone talks about."
Lori W.,"Marysville, WA",9,3,,1.0,8/16/2014,"This was our first time at bjs. It was horrible service. We asked three different waiters to bring sofa crackers for the kids to eat while waiting for their meals and still didn't get them. Our meals came out in pieces instead of altogether and so some had to watch while others ate and even our bills were messed up. I would not recommend this restsurant, and the food wasnot great enough to make me come back and tolerate the poor service. I'd sure like to know who the manager. Never saw he or she on the floor supervising once."
Mike T.,"Sapulpa, OK",22,56,10,4.0,7/3/2011,"Pot stickers, Santa Fe chicken salad are very good!  Beer is very good too!"
Deanna M.,"South Colby, WA",5,6,,2.0,1/13/2014,Took my work team out for a post holiday dinner. Very disappointed. Waitress seemed overwhelmed. We order appetizers and shortly after ordering that we ordered dinner. We received our dinner salads prior to appetizers and then received our appetizers prior to finishing our salads. Was ok with that but when we received our meals they were cold and the pasta lacked sauce. Waitress did what she could with what she was given but I will pick a better location to treat my staff and not recommend going to my friends and family.
Briana H.,"Tacoma, WA",43,7,20,5.0,11/14/2013,"Food is always great... After trial & error... I know what I like ... Drinks are good, & every once and a while beer is better. I'm a reg!"
David Z.,"Portland, OR",104,154,30,4.0,8/17/2010,"BJ's dishes up some fairly typical brewhouse fare. The menu is actually quite vast, almost too vast really. It was hard to decide what to order because there were simply too many options! I suppose variety is the spice of life though, right? Anyways, vast though it is, the menu offers many delicious sounding options ate very reasonable prices. Hard to argue with that. I ended up ordering one of the burgers and I have to say, I was not disappointed. Was it the best burger I've ever had? Hardly. Was it delicious all the same? Certainly! Even though I was at a brewhouse, I decided to forgo the alcohol for the root beer. As you may or may not know, it is my quest to find the world's greatest root beer, so I must try all new options. This selection was good, but nothing special in my opinion. If my review ended here, I'd probably be giving BJ's a 3 star review. Good food, good prices, and a good atmosphere, but not on par to many other eateries I've given 4 stars to. That said, the service was amazing. Fast, friendly, personable, and super helpful! Congrats to our waitress Destiny for earning an extra star in this review."
Sharon R.,"Puyallup, WA",0,50,3,1.0,8/10/2012,"Absolutely horrible rude,  unprofessional service and management  along with mediocre overpriced food!"
Jamma K.,"Ashford, WA",0,14,,1.0,1/25/2015,We won't ever be going back to this one.  My husband and I got our soup and salad right away. (there were 8 of us)  We ordered the bread bowl and didn't get it Just the soup  slopped in a dish.  My salad was swimming in salad dressing my husband didn't have enough.  We asked for some bread and 45 minutes later we got 4 skinning strips of dried out toast.  Our soup had been gone for ages. Half an hour later 5 other people at our table got most of their food.  We had to ask for the fruit sides. One child at the table never got his food and we had to reorder. She said 3 minutes...Yeah right another 20 minutes for a kids pizza. The waitress was friendly which did not make up for her lack of counting heads.  Terrible terrible.  It wasn't like they were that busy.  Empty tables were viewed..What a shame...Hoping South Hill Mall has better wait staff and management.
Krystin T.,"Seattle, WA",101,400,,4.0,1/17/2011,"I went to BJ's to watch the (horribly depressing) Seahawks game yesterday with my boyfriend and his friends. I very rarely venture into Tacoma (even though the boy lives there - what can I say, Seattle is more my style!) and I'd never been to a BJ's, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I also didn't much care - by the time we got there, I'd been driving for nearly an hour after getting up early, and just wanted some coffee! BJ's delivered. Their coffee was REALLY GOOD. I don't know what it was, but I was surprised by its tastiness. The boy and I got a little table in the bar while we waited for his friends to get there, and we found our server very attentive. He was always around to refill our coffee or take our order - chicken sandwich for the BF and mini bruschetta for me. The menu was pretty extensive and, because it was so early in the a.m., I wasn't really sure what to get. There's no breakfast food to speak of (which is fine) and I didn't want to eat a full-blown lunch at 10:30 in the morning, so I opted for the aforementioned mini bruschetta. And they were SO FREAKING GOOD. The dish is made up of four tiny little square-shaped bruschettas (cheese, basil, tomato, red pepper, and onion) with a basil pesto dressing. I'm picky about my bruschetta and this satisfied my snobby little palate. Then I kept picking at the boy's fries, which were good - but let's be real, I've never met a fry I didn't like, so I may not be the best judge. Once our game-watching companions arrived, we moved to a different table, and the server was pretty accommodating. One couple ordered a calzone, which was HUGE, and they said it was pretty good. They had one of the pizookie things for dessert and said it was good as well - I didn't actually taste any of that so I can't offer a real opinion.  The place is pretty big, the menu offers lots of options (including gluten-free pizza), and everything seems fairly affordable. It was a good choice to watch a (very, very bad) game, even though I had to drive all the way to Tac-town to do it. :)"
Ashley G.,"Tacoma, WA",0,7,,4.0,10/21/2013,I've been here a few times and each time it got better. The first time I went was on a dinner date with some girlfriends. Its not the type of place Id pick for ladies night but the food was good. I really recommend the pizza here. There is many different options to choose from and its nice that you can customize it. The next two times I went was with family on nights I didn't feel like cooking. I'm not a fan of most chains like Red Robins or Applebees and while this is a chain its a bit of a step up from those places.
Tammy C.,"Kent, WA",118,138,89,2.0,4/4/2010,"The boy and I met up with another couple with kid in tow at BJ's on Saturday...  I have to side with other reviewers and say the service really, really needs an upgrade. (The boy and I have both worked in same said service industry and thought maybe she was having an off day... but from other reviews me thinks not.) We saw her once for drink orders.  Once to get our food order.  Drop off drinks.  Come back well after the food was dropped off to see if we needed drink refills (hell yes!). And finally to drop the check.  She did NOT serve us our food, ask how our food was, make any effort to get to our table for drink refills, or just the 'how is everything?' So how was everything? I am bummed they do not offer a soup/sandwich/salad/pizza combo on the weekends.  Lots of places do not, but the option here would be nice. The food: My wedge salad was swimming in dressing.  Swimming. And I love a good wedge and blue cheese dressing, but damn!  Swimming!! The boy ordered a chicken salad and the dressing was the same on his.  The remnants that made it home were a complete soggy and inedible mess. I also got the baked potato.  If potatoes can be sterioded this one certainly was.  Next time I think I will order the veggie filled potato instead of the classic. Oh right, and next time I think I will just head to the Southcenter location with much better service."
Juana R.,"Tacoma, WA",9,25,,3.0,4/18/2013,I am not a big fan of the food but I do enjoy coming here for drinks and of course pizookies!  You can never go wrong on half off wine Tuesdays!
Michele B.,"Las Vegas, NV",69,43,7,2.0,7/20/2010,"Ok, I tried.  I really did.  I am in no way a food snob.  I love going to dives and can usually always find something I like no matter where I go.  I have been here 3 times in the past 3 months.  My kids love the atmosphere but I just can't take it anymore.  The food is blah, the service can be downright awful, and it's super spendy!!   On my first visit, I tried the wedge salad.  I asked for the dressing on the side and of course it came out on the wedge and totally drenched my plate!  And forget about getting a refill on your iced tea.   My second visit, I did the pizza.  Not bad, but again - service was awful.  If you ask for anything, you may get it if you are lucky. My last straw was yesterday.  I decided to split the salmon entree with my husband and the vegetables that came with it were RAW!  They had not seen the inside of a fry pan ever!  The waitress tried to tell me that they didn't cook them long enough, but please!  And it took a good 45 minutes for our food to come out. (and additional 15 min for my 2nd set of cooked veggies)  My daughters mini burgers came out extra pink and with no cheese when we asked for well done and cheese. So, alas - BJ's I gave you a shot, many to be exact.  I am sure I will find other places to spend my dollars."
Chris W.,"Camarillo, CA",131,107,50,3.0,4/28/2010,"Before heading out to BJs brewhouse for my girlfriend's brothers birthday dinner, we looked to make sure they have a gluten free menu, and sure enough they do (well it's called a food sensitivity menu). So it was safe for us to go. This is a typical big chain restaurant that brews their own beer.  The beer is good from what I am told. The food portions are big, so come here hungry or else you will be bringing some of it home with you. There are TVs all around with various sporting events on.  There is even a jumbotron behind the bar that was split 6 ways with 6 different games showing. The service was good and our waitress was gluten free as well, so she was very accommodating to my girlfriend and I.   We had the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes along with potato skin appetizers. The pricing is a bit on the high side, but for special occasion it's a nice place to go. I am sure all BJs Brewhouse restaurants have the gluten free menu available if you ask, and yes...they do have gluten free pizza here."
Stephanie W.,"University Place, WA",80,103,41,4.0,1/27/2013,Pretty good eats!  The flatbread pizza and mozzarella salad...hullo it just don't get better than that on a Friday night in T-Town
Ananda L.,"Tacoma, WA",5,5,1,4.0,6/7/2014,"Happy hour is great here. Our waiter actually seemed to care about the service and food, which is always a plus. I didn't enjoy my first drink (lemon drop) and I think he noticed so we were able to add variations to it.....strawberry puree made is banging. ;) We came in about an hour after happy hour started so it wasn't crowded at all."
Jason N.,"Tacoma, WA",2,17,,4.0,10/20/2013,Another past birthday lunch location. It is a very comfortable and fun place and the food and drinks were great. I had to fill my comfort food urge and get the open faced meatloaf sandwich they had at the time. I hate going to the Tacoma Mall but this is right outside of the Food Court cesspool so it works out. Parking is insane but its all worth it usually.
