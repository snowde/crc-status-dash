Sara R.,"Peyton, CO",3,29,1,3.0,2/10/2011,"This place is hit or miss. The menu is HUGE so there's definitely something for everyone here. The avocado egg rolls are usually pretty great and I love their giant baked potatoes.  All in all, a big step up from your ""usual"" American style restaurants like Friday's or Applebee's but nothing to write home about."
KC O.,"Tacoma, WA",11,65,35,3.0,6/6/2010,BJ's is a decent addition to the Tacoma Mall area. Not the greatest place but ok in a pinch.  I have only been a couple times and it was different both times. First visit was in the bar where I had a great cantaloupe martini but the food was disappointing. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and it was not that great-tasted like it might have been a previously frozen entree. The white cheddar mashed potatoes are pretty good and the sauce that comes with the broccoli was pretty good also.  My second visit was for a birthday party in the dining room area-this time I had the Cesar salad with cajun shrimp and it was great! The shrimp cooked just right and the cajun spice was excellent. I also had the avocado egg rolls which were recommended by a friend and they were also excellent! I would go back just for those! Don't try to take them home for leftovers-not good reheated!  On the second visit I had a pomegranate martini-good stuff!  I would not pick BJ's for dinner but I would go for the drinks and avocado egg rolls!
Mr. J.,"Tacoma, WA",0,146,,3.0,12/22/2010,"The food and beer are good. I especially like their pizzas and nachos. There is a nice selection of Belgian ales. But in general I would prefer to eat somewhere truly local like the Harmon, rather than a corporate franchise place like this."
Lora B.,"Lumberton, TX",0,25,4,4.0,9/10/2013,"Is just slightly better than ok, but love the choices of beer and local ales."
Christian M.,"Tacoma, WA",16,24,21,3.0,5/27/2013,"1 word... A-OK.  The food here was very good. I ordered the sliders and they were very good. The reason for demoting 2 stars was because the service was terrible. Our server was inattentive and would rarely check in or refill our drinks. Also, it was a bit loud and hard to hear the waiter talk to us.   We finished our meal with a pizooki witch was excellent. I would recommend coming at a time that's not so busy so around 4:30."
Charlotte P.,"Tacoma, WA",0,1,,1.0,12/22/2013,"If I could I'd give this place 0 stars. I keep going here thinking it'll get better but it only gets worse. I went once and they were out of tortilla chips which nixed alot that i wanted and made my friend sick from dirty plates another time. They also make their own sour sauce which tastes like crap and only carry Pepsi instead of Coke... I mean who drinks whiskey and Pepsi that's just gross! But this last time was the straw that broke that broke the camels back. I asked for a whiskey and ginger ale, as I do not like their sour sauce or Pepsi with my whiskey, I was thinking I was going to get a well whiskey and ginger ale but when I got my tab it was a Jameson. I asked the waitress why i got a Jameson wheni did not ask for it and she said it was the only whiskey they had...really??? Its a bar, you have only one whiskey?? And the only whiskey is expensive whiskey?? And besides all that she copped a huge attitude when I asked her about it. With drinks and food and service there's always been a problem. Now I'm on the hunt for someplace better to go."
Allen B.,"Tacoma, WA",5,126,1,4.0,8/10/2010,"Been there 3 times. 2 out of 3 ain't bad, I suppose. 1st time was for happy hour and I was thoroughly  impressed. Best fish tacos ever (Except for my own homemade, if I do say so myself). My wife got the Personal Pizza and Salad. She wasn't raving about it, but gave it a passing grade. Those 2 dishes w/ two finely crafted brews (Jerimiah Red's the bomb) and the tabs's less than $25. 2nd time, not so good. Got a chicken sandwich which was a little dry and lacking flavor. Didn't go during happy hour so I got sticker shock when the tab came. Saw the server twice. Once to take our order and once to drop off the exorbitant check. A different person came w/our food. 3rd time, got a Parmesan Crusted chicken dinner that restored my faith in the place. Pounded out thin w/ a nice sauce that I wanted the recipe for. The mashed potatos were positively divine. The service showed improvement. Overall, I'd say try it. Just order the right thing. Unfortunately, you gotta kiss a few frogs to find your prince."
Iris M.,"Seattle, WA",21,116,,4.0,9/22/2010,"Went on a Wednesday night with a large group of friends and had a very pleasant experience. We were seated right away and our server was totally cool when we wanted to have separate checks.  My husband and I shared the beer sampler. It was awesome, but honestly, we only liked the Red and the Hefeweizen. The Lager tasted worse than Bud Light.  The avocado spring rolls were super yummy and would be too much food if you ordered it for yourself because you get six pieces (really three cut in half), but they are BIG. The tamarind dipping sauce was super yummy, sticky and sweet. I loved it. Nice appetizer for a big group.  I had the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp and it was really tasty. I was worried that it wasn't going to be spicy enough, but it was really spicy and I loved it. The shrimp was obviously frozen, but I already expected this so I was okay. The pasta was cooked perfectly though and I really enjoyed the bread that came with it too.  I wanted to give BJ's and extra star because of our server. She was one of the best servers have had in a long time and was very attentive and friendly. Next time I will try to get a pizza. They looked amazing."
Lisa B.,"Puyallup, WA",0,11,,4.0,9/30/2011,"Made my first trip in on a Wednesday night with my mother in law. It was busy but not so busy we were totally overlooked. I loved the wide menu, they had a ton of appetizer and even mini appetizer options. The thai shrimp lettuce wraps were great but a little difficult to eat without being messy, stuffed mushrooms were great  but the best part of my time there was the dessert... nothing is better than a warm cookie (different options) with ice cream on top. It was so yummy!  I thought prices were pretty reasonable - Two full appetizers, one mini appetizer, one mini dessert (just one of the trio dessert you could order) and two mixed drinks = $43... not too bad for missing out on Happy Hour. I'm taking my family back this weekend to try out some more of their extensive menu! Can't wait!!"
Billy J.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,,1.0,11/6/2013,Took over an hour for a burger that was burnt like no other! I'll never come to this overpriced establishment ever again. I would rather have McDonalds!!!
Misty A.,"Puyallup, WA",2,105,15,4.0,3/4/2012,"We recently went there on a Saturday night at around 10:15. It was pretty late, but the place was still really busy. We ordered our meals and they came within a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the chicken marsala and wasn't really impressed, but it was still worth eating. My boyfriend ordered a balsamic vinaigrette chicken meal and it was really good. Then we had dessert and left. All in all this place was nice. I liked the atmosphere and everyone that we came in contact with was really nice. Our waiter was a little weird, but super nice. The cost is a little more than we usually like to spend because there is normally three of us, but I would say it's worth it! I can't wait to go back."
Earl O.,"Lakewood, WA",32,56,57,3.0,11/12/2012,"Went there for veterans day pizza,nice atmosphere friendly staff.homemade rootbeer was awesome.  I Would go back"
Annette B.,"Puyallup, WA",6,58,144,4.0,9/29/2012,"Great food, great atmosphere, they really have great pizza! My husband loves their mac and cheese. Great clean place and kid friendly!"
Scott J.,"Tacoma, WA",2,43,,3.0,7/22/2014,We come to this location and Tukwila. I would rate this location a little higher. Food is good and service is okay. Pretty typical chain restaurant.
Diego S.,"Seattle, WA",139,434,65,3.0,1/17/2010,"Great brew house.. been to a few of these places, big in Cali Food is good drinks are great  hours are adequate"
Glamma 4.,"Kennewick, WA",6,147,236,3.0,2/11/2014,good place to bring a group for some grub and drinks. reminds me alot of bob's burgers with more menu items. the atmosphere was alive because the seahawks were playing so most everyone was into that more than reviewing the food. this was my second trip to the chain and the food is fine.
Chelsea G.,"Tacoma, WA",15,7,,2.0,10/4/2013,"My family and I ate there last night and we should have ate elsewhere! My husband and I had a burger, different kinds, but both were flavorless. McDonald's makes a better burger! The wedge fries were good though. My daughter had a grilled cheese but the bread was too crunchy"
Isaac J.,"Tacoma, WA",536,16,35,4.0,10/20/2012,"This is a good family restaurant. I love the BJs honey chicken salad.  Entertainment is good if you love sports, with many television showing the games."
Gail B.,"Boerne, TX",1,8,,3.0,8/19/2014,"Ribeye was okay; overly spiced with quite a bit of gristle. Decent portions. Best part was visiting with family. Otherwise, would have picked a better quality restaurant for a steak."
Courtney L.,"Lakewood, WA",10,4,,4.0,12/21/2012,"We went here for lunch for the first time and even though it was quite busy and the holiday season, we got seated quickly. Our server, Melissa was quick to take our orders and very friendly. She looked like she really enjoyed working there. Our drinks came out fast, I had soda, my husband a beer and water. The appetizers and the dinner plates took a little longer than at most chains, but we chalk that up to being near the Tacoma Mall and that the kitchen was just overwhelmed. Portions are huge and I had a to go bag because of it."
