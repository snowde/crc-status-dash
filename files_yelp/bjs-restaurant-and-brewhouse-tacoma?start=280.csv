Sarah L.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,13,,4.0,3/29/2013,"Really good food, I especially like the deep crust pizza!! A little on the pricy side though, but I'd still go back, just not as often as I'd like because of the prices."
Amy L.,"Fort Knox, KY",5,48,,4.0,10/2/2012,"This is one restaurant our whole family enjoys. BJ's has great food and excellent service. Plus, the portions are so large you always leave with a meal for the next day as well."
Larisha S.,"University Place, WA",21,100,10,3.0,4/12/2010,"finally a restaurant thats open late that isnt shari's... though not quite open late enough for my usual habits. but far better food.  their home made creme soda is awesome though i wished it had been served with ice. nevertheless, it was great to try.  my friend and i got the appetizer platter which had the avacado rolls (which were fantastic with the sauce), mozerella sticks which were eh, some santa fe spring rolls which were decent, and some artichoke and parmasean dip with chips. my friend and i split that and a small bacon cheeseburger deep dish pizza. it was good but i wish some of the flavors were more pronounced.  i ordered an apple crisp for dessert which was pretty delicious also we had leftovers, portions were great, the food could be a little more flavorful for how its described, but still better than quite a few other places in the area. nothing was bland just not what i was hoping for the atmosphere was not as we expected, it was very classy, dimmed lights (possibly for the time we were there? around 10pm), only thing i didnt like was the music was just a bit too loud, a little distracting. service was good, a little ""noob""ish, but i could tell he meant well. not as attentive as i like, but every place is different.  id come back again and try some of their other entrees for sure"
Andrew F.,"Murfreesboro, TN",43,146,21,5.0,5/20/2012,"Awesome place it reminds me of a place in Hawaii but it will not have as many beers as them.  The food was slow coming out, because it was Friday and BUSY BUSY, but the food is worth it.  Had a house beer which was Okay on my end but I have tasted worse beer than that.  I would go here again and if your looking for a place to grab a few with food options then this place is for you."
Daniel Z.,"Tacoma, WA",54,123,16,4.0,5/26/2009,"I've been back several times and it's always been great. The food is always good, the service is always friendly and prompt. I can't comment on the bar since I haven't tapped into that department at BJ's just yet, I always seem to be the one driving."
Angelina C.,"Seattle, WA",99,76,12,4.0,1/18/2012,I love all the different types of food they have here. Service is always friendly and very helpful. Even when it's busy the enviroment is always welcoming.
Katie O.,"Renton, WA",143,525,44,5.0,1/31/2012,"When BWW's fell through, BJ's was there for us! My friend and I gave up on our wing dream and quickly got a table. The menu was chalk-full of tempting items, but I settled on one of their specialty pizzas, and my friend got a salad. Oh my gosh, that pizza was huge and oh so filling. I definitely recommend it, but if you're eating the pizza by yourself, get the personal size and not the small."
Sabrina S.,"University Place, WA",0,21,17,4.0,5/4/2014,All our meals were well prepared and my salmon was moist and fully cooked. I am very picky about fish but fully impressed. Good kids meals too. Lots of options for them.
Katy T.,"Port Orchard, WA",85,9,,1.0,3/30/2014,"Never ever will go here again. To start, we waited 25 minutes to be sat in between lunch and dinner. Multiple people came in and were sat immediately. Not one other guest was waiting in the lobby. Then the hostess got our name wrong when it finally was our turn. Had four different servers and not one of them could get anything right. We ordered spinach artichoke dip and received cold dip and stale chips. Asked for something different and had nothing to offer. I ordered soup and sandwich and received my soup well before my sandwich.  When I finally got my sandwich, there was a black hair in it. Took it back and waited 20 minutes for a replacement. I finally told them to forget it considering the others I had came with were already done with their -terrible- meals. Told the manager and still tried to bring it to me. In the meantime, they brought me another soup not realizing they already served it to me. Someone obviously is missing there's. On top of all that they only gave us two napkins and silverware for 2 people when there was 3 of us. Asked multiple times to all of our servers and never received anything. Will never ever eat here again. Oh and the drinks suck. Pure juice, no alcohol."
Rowena M.,"Des Moines, WA",18,135,1,3.0,6/8/2009,"Not really into places that provide big tv's to watch sports while you're trying to get to know a person, but I guess as long as he doesn't have ADD then it's ok.  They have a nice list of brews that graduate from light to dark and we went with a nutty brown ale that was very nice. I went for burger and fries to go with my beer and was impressed with the meat on this monstrous thing. At some point I tossed the bread aside and just tore into the meat trying to satisfy some strange primal urge that I got from that hunk of meat (or maybe that was my date.) They also offer a choice of wedge cut steak fries and thin cut fries. I chose the thin, which were fine, but a little greasy. He chose the wedge fries which looked like they were less greasy. I have no problem eating greasy food, but I think in my old age my body is being less cooperative and I woke up in the middle of the night with a bit of heartburn. Not blaming them, though because I really shouldn't be eating burgers anyway. Especially since they have quite an extensive menu. Might check out another dish next time."
Mike O.,"Fox Island, WA",1,28,2,5.0,6/8/2012,"Really good pizza and beer, deep dish style. The crust is almost fried.  We like the open and airy feel of the restaurant and there is a lot of big screens to watch, oh yeah the service is good too.  we get the pizza with everything on it, my son orders entrees and is always happy with his choice."
Mandi M.,"Tacoma, WA",3,41,1,2.0,3/11/2009,"BJ's could be a lot better!  The food was fair, the atmosphere was fun, but ... the service was AWFUL. Not just once, but twice! After waiting WAY to long for our food, it came minus one meal. By the time my friend got her turkey club, everyone else was finished eating. The server was less than sympathetic ... she was rude!  The avocado egg rolls were really good ... I'd order them to go!"
AandB S.,"Issaquah, WA",3,23,,4.0,6/21/2009,Beer is GREAT... all of them! Food is okay as well as the service. Try the Avocado Egg Rolls. Have plenty of beer and walk it off in the mall. My rating system: Things To Die For = 5 stars Things To Die From = 1 star
Jill E.,"University Place, WA",58,382,99,3.0,2/18/2009,"You other reviewers are far nicer than I am.  We've been there a couple of times since it's close to our house and if we're at the mall, it's better than the food court.  The first time we ate there I thought well, it was ok, we'll give it another try.  The last time, I won't go back.  I ordered a pasta dish for lunch and when it  finally came about 25 minutes later, and the place wasn't  crowded, the noodles were stuck together in clumps and the sauce was gummy.  It took many minutes before the server even showed her head to ask if everything was ok.  She did get the mangers to take it off our bill but with the poor service and the very average food, why bother."
Kirsten P.,"Tacoma, WA",178,4,,2.0,4/26/2011,"Yuck! Never again! I hadn't tried this since the last horrible time I went. Had the fish and chips. The pieces were so overcooked that I could barely eat them and the fries were cold. Never, ever again!"
Lija S.,"Tacoma, WA",4,2,,1.0,3/23/2011,"For starters we showed up 15 min. before our reservation to an empty restaurant and weren't seated for 20 mins. We asked for a menu with nutritional info. and were told they don't have one, but they have a small section of the menu that is under 700 calories. So the salads we ordered show up rather wilted. Service was not knowledgeable, but full of snotty attitude, so that was fun!"
Ted P.,"Arlington Heights, IL",33,323,18,4.0,4/22/2009,Decent food (better than similar chain competitors) and the service was prompt and attentive -- even if it did feel a bit perfunctory. The big win?  Cheap lunch.  My wife and I enjoyed two non-skimpy meals (no drinks) for under $14.00 total -- not bad at all.
Nate P.,"Puyallup, WA",83,2,1,2.0,11/25/2012,"We have been to this location a few times, and usually have a great experience. Today however, the waitress was very unattentive. I got my salad, before ever getting my soda, or even silverware.. Which I didn't get for another 5 minutes. Food was good, once we actually got it."
Rhonda B.,"Graham, WA",0,3,,3.0,5/13/2014,Great food and great service. would recommend the Ahi tuna salad and shrimp lettuce wraps.
Nathan P.,"Seattle, WA",24,62,140,3.0,9/2/2013,"on august 31st , My parents and I came to this place and we had drinks and appetizers and they were great  but the male waitress was not attending the tables  we had to wait long time for our drink refills."
