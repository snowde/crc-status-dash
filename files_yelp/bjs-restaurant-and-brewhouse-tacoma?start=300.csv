Jacob R.,"Tacoma, WA",157,53,105,3.0,11/26/2008,I ate at BJ's last Sunday. I am not a big mall person and I hardly venture to that part of town but I wanted to give BJ's a try. A friend and I headed over to BJ's at about 5pm. Parking was pretty easy. The building looks nice from the outside and has a big revolving door. The place was very busy. We were seated promptly. There was a cold draft coming from the vents on the ceiling. The person being seated right before us asked to move tables because it was right under the vent. I was cold the whole meal.  The waiter was nice and tried to push some beers on us but I wasn't feeling it. They also really push some root beer they make. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer and shortly after our meals. I ordered the turkey cobb sandwich and my friend ordered some pasta. The main meals came out quick but 30 seconds later here came our bruschetta. We said no thanks to the bruschetta because we just got our meals. The waiter said the same thing just happened with his other table. The bruschetta was taken off the bill.  The turkey cobb sandwich was good. It had a lot of avocado which I like. The joejoe style fries tasted like they came out of a bag from the freezer.  My friends pasta looked kind of boring. It was a plain spiral pasta with chicken and broccoli. He said it was good. It looked like it needed some pinenuts or something in it. He said the piece of bread that came with it was really hard.  All in all it wasn't bad. I would probably go back sometime. The pizzas looked interesting so I might have to try those sometime.
Cara T.,"Tacoma, WA",25,39,,3.0,12/4/2008,"Tuesday night, didn't feel like cooking, 1 less child for the evening (YAY!! only 3 kids) means we head out for dinner.  We actually tried another place first, but there was too long a wait so drove over to try out the new BJ's. I was pleased to find a close parking spot, although that doesn't really speak to the restaraunt but set my mood off pleasantly.  We were greeted and seated rather quickly upon entering.  I will say I felt a little overwhelmed by the 8 page (or so) menu/booklet.  But 4  pages are dedicated to their beers.  The kids and the BF ordered drinks - the waitress talked him into a Prickly Pear Patron 'Rita since it was the same price ($7) as the other drinks.  Pretty reasonable for Patron - it was tasty but not really strong by our standards. We ordered an appetizer and all our food at the same time and waited.  My son had root beer and sat waiting for a refill - the waitress didn't come back to our table once.  Son ordered soup but it was forgotten and came out only after we asked.  Me and the BF were also served, but no food for the 2 little ones - which didin't settle well. We had to ask the waitress what happened to their food and it was brought out several minutes later.  Oh, and no appetizer.  I was getting ready to ask for the manager when he came over on his own and apologized.  He told us to enjoy our dinner and he would make it right .I will say this much, everything we ate was really good.  The turkey cobb had thick slices of bacon and avacado and a toasty garlicky roll and the french dip had lots of melted cheese and tender roast beef. Halfway through dinner the waitress brought the appetizer and said it would be at no charge. OK fine.  We got the bill and I was pleased, as I noticed she didn't charge us the upcharge for soup instead of fries for 2 of the meals and also no charge for the appetizer.   Now out comes the manager with a huge Pizookie - huge as in the platter size that I think goes for about $18 - served chewy and warm with gooey vanilla ice cream.  That was on the house and he hoped we would be back.  I give them 3 becuase the food was good, and the manager really seemed to care how we were treated.  They were very apologetic and I understand it can be difficult to get things going in a new establishment - and they were pretty busy too. I am sure we will be back, I hear they have a pretty good happy hour with drink and food specials so  I will definately re-review on that too."
Grant R.,"Tacoma, WA",64,59,10,4.0,7/21/2011,"Went here for the US Women's World Cup match against Japan. The service was good enough, and the food was great. I had one of their deep dish pizzas and really enjoyed it. Very family friendly atmosphere."
Mike Y.,"Seattle, WA",0,59,,1.0,5/15/2013,"NO! This place is definitely not worth it  Another shining example of a big box restaurant that way over promises and WAY under delivers.  Food is very average and the service is SLOW, disjointed and grossly inconsistent.  My advice: DON'T GO!!"
Nikki W.,"Alexandria, VA",3,36,4,5.0,3/31/2011,"I loved the shrimp tacos! I ordered a delicious strawberry drink that was described as a strawberry pina colada. YUM!!! The strawberry beignet was DELICIOUS!!!! Hands down, delicious!!!"
Rachel P.,"Honolulu, HI",38,16,6,3.0,1/15/2009,"There are $3.00 beers from open till 3PM. The televisions are huge. The feel is very corporate but definately a step up from chili's and TGIFriday's. The Menu: HUGE! Spring rolls, potstickers, Pizza, Steak, Ribs, Gourmet sandwiches, Potatoes, Pastas, Salads, Nachos... and on and on.... It doesn't end.  Bar: Brewery: Seven BJ's Speciality beers, two Seasonals, maybe 50 beers on tap... Full array of Wine, Martini's, Margaritta's. The biggest Belgian and German beer selection I've seen  Happy Hour: 1/2 off mini pizzas, appetizers, $1 off drinks M-F 3-7, 10-Close Sun 9-Close This is as good as casual dining gets."
Casey A.,"Olympia, WA",9,55,,3.0,12/8/2009,"After the finding the restaurant we wanted to dine at was closed we discovered BJ's. We were greeted and asked how many in the party and I said 3, as I was standing there with my husband and daughter.  I was asked if we wanted a booster seat or highchair and told him we would like a highchair. We were led to the largest booth in the place, it would have easily sat 6 people.   He looked at us as we sat down and said, ""Oh, so it is just three of you.""  Yes...that is correct.  He took away one of the three menus he  brought and said he would be back with a highchair and a kids menu (there was a high chair right behind him).  Did he think someone was going to sit in the highchair and order from the regular menu? Our waitress came, took our drink order, and was very friendly.  We ordered two burgers and a grilled cheese kids meal.  She asked us if we wanted the kids meal to come out first, and we said that would  be great, but that is not what happened, all our meals came out together. My burger was delicious, great flavors.  I had the California burger with avocado grilled chilies, chipotle mayo on sourdough bread.  My husband liked his burger as well.  Our daughter liked her cheese sandwich but didn't care for the happy potatoes, not that I can blame her, they were a little disturbing and didn't taste very good. Overall it was ok, we might go back, but we would have to have a compelling reason to do so."
Jason F.,"Rocklin, CA",18,43,11,5.0,12/18/2008,"I happen to love this place, but have only been there for lunch, so I seem to miss out on the negatives that the other reviewers seem to have. I have never had more than a 5 minute wait for 4 people. Parking can be a pain since its at the main entrance to the mall. The menu is pretty extensive, which can actually be a little overwhelming, but the food is excellent. I have had a couple of their sandwiches, both of them great. Others at my table had various things that we all somewhat sampled off each others plates, and it was all good (the soups are excellent). The beer selection is amazing. They have beers that I have only ever seen overseas in Belgium and the Netherlands, and their own craft beers are really good too. For the non-alcoholic drinks, they have a great ""hand crafted"" root beer. The prices are decent, but just a little steep. They have some good lunch specials, and if you are just drinking water you can get out for under $10 (not including tip). Cheaper than the RAM for similar food and beer. The service was quick, but again, that may just be based on the fact that we were there during lunch, and business seemed a little slow."

Emma C.,"Tacoma, WA",10,18,,4.0,9/14/2011,"I love coming here!! I love that their menue is like a freaking book! I love that htey have a ton of beers to choose from. I have never had a bad experience here. I have had a few different dishes, all good. Their pizza is fantastic! I love thee pizzokies! I highly recomend it. The only problem I have ever had was when I called ahead a half an hour before hand and they didnt have a table for us when we got there. A HUGE party came in supposedly unexpectedly.  But even then a great experience when we got sat."
Ann L.,"Kathleen, GA",150,554,11,4.0,4/17/2011,"Stopped in here after some shopping and wanting a beer to relax after braving that crazy crazy packed Tacoma Mall.  Although I was skeptical given the fact that it is attached to the mall, I was pleasantly surprised.  Bartender was attentive and helpful.  Santa Fe salad was yummy.  Hefeweizen hit the spot.  Decor was non-offensive.  TV screen showing games is huge.  They did not have sound for the games - pop/alternative rock from the mid-90s to today played through the restaurant and bar."
Angel E.,"Tacoma, WA",48,18,15,3.0,7/24/2011,"I went for the Avacado eggrolls id heard about, after trying though id say they are just Meeehh compared to the ones at the Cheesecake factory. Their deep dish pizza was pretty good but a little ""airy"" for a deep dish.  This is probably a great place to drink and eat, but since I cant drink right now (pregnant) I can only judge the food. A few vegetarian items to choose from, but mainly salads and one soup (Tomato). Not horrible but not  my Go to. :)"
Melissa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",66,230,11,3.0,12/3/2008,"This was my second try at BJs.  My DH and I went on a Saturday night and there was over an hour wait.  We left.  I went again last night with a friend and had a pretty good experience overall. The waiter left both of us without drinks for a significant time.  My friend wanted the rest of her dinner boxed to go, and they forgot and threw it away.   It seems like the food is great but the service has something to be desired.  I'd go back again soon; it beats Applebee's by a million!"
Les U.,"Honolulu, HI",12,161,186,3.0,5/29/2011,"I had the fish taco, it was OK.  The guacamole was watery, tasteless.  The salsa was pretty much the same. The one thing that saved my meal was the root beer.  It was good but not as good as Waialua Soda Works. My little one had a flame broiled New York strip steak.  She said it was really good.  She had a orange creme soda, she did state that it tasted better after putting some vanilla ice cream in it.  My other daughter and her boy friend, I can't recall what they had but they finished before me with  not much talking so I am guessing it was either good or they are truly starving students trying to make it on their own."
Denise H.,"Olympia, WA",3,22,4,4.0,2/12/2012,"Nice clean restaurant. Helpful staff. Good food, good beer, GREAT desserts. We loved the Pizookie!"
Lesleann S.,"Atlanta, GA",8,23,,5.0,8/16/2011,"I love this restaurant! When my family was in town, I took them here. They were impressed with the amount of food they could select from and everything we ordered was amazing.... My mom said this restaurant was much like a Cheesecake Factory... maybe because the menus look very similar. I love stopping in for a quick bite after shopping or for dinner with friends! Great place!!"
A B.,"Portland, OR",0,115,2,4.0,10/14/2013,"We needed to each lunch in Tacoma and nothing else was really striking our fancy on Yelp. We were craving thai food but none of the highly rated thai restaurants were open either a) at that hour or b) on Saturdays, so we decided to settle for BJ's. However, we were pleasantly surprised! It was happy hour (yay!) and so we tried the chicken lettuce wraps. OH MY GOSH. They were delicious!!! And they had good beer, too! What a variety they offered for main entrees - I had a bison burger - mmmmmmmmmm! So many things on the menu and different portion sizes can accommodate even the most picky eaters -- those living a paleo lifestyle!"
Gwendolyn S.,"Tacoma, WA",1,13,,4.0,12/30/2011,"We just tried this place earlier tonight.  My daughter is a huge fan, had eaten here previously, and graciously offered to buy her brother and I dinner.  I had never been, and quite honestly never even heard of it.  (Yes, as a matter of fact, I DO live under a rock) I was very impressed even though it was obviously a corporate chain.  I've been in the ""industry"" for over 23 years and BJ's passed all the preliminary tests: Hostess-prompt and friendly Table-roomy and clean Table menu (the drink or dessert menu that stays on the table)-clean The salt and pepper-clean (are you getting a sense of my OCD yet?) The waitress-amazing~ The best part was our server.  I wish I had gotten her name.  I'm actually quite surprised at some of the poor reviews mostly referring to the service.  I don't think I've ever had better and I'm a pretty tough customer when it comes to that. All in all the food is very good, not exceptional, but very very good, and the prices more than reasonable. I only have one complaint-mall parking lot.  I'll just have to get over that though=)"
Mz L.,"Silverdale, WA",86,10,4,5.0,6/21/2013,Love it here! Food is great and the waiter was nice.. I don't mind coming back again :)
Peter H.,"Tacoma, WA",10,48,12,5.0,2/14/2011,"We love this place. Always busy, but worth the wait! You have to try the jambalaya...I'm allergic to shellfish, but they will prepare it without the shrimp.  Service is prompt and friendly."
