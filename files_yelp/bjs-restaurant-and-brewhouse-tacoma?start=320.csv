Tri T.,"Washington, DC",145,261,33,3.0,1/6/2009,"The place looks really nice and the staff is really friendly. However, I wasn't too impressed with the food. Although there is a selection very similar to Cheesecake Factory where they hand you a novel to look through, everything was just mediocre. Who would've thought that you can get egg rolls, spaghetti, and fish and chips all at the same place? I'd suggest going for the televisions, beer and bar food. That's where this place is a winner."
Mrs M.,"Tacoma, WA",48,164,21,3.0,12/7/2010,So the menu is inventive. Tons of different choices and types of food. Happy hour is decent but only obtained in the bar area. 1/2 price mini pizzas. Which are enough for one person. They come with whole chunks of tomatoes so if you don't like them. I would order with out. This restaurants would have got five stars however. You never know if your going to have a good waiter. Not that its rocket science. They hire anyone and some people feel they are entitled to a tip. I go in after work in my uniform and they seem to think I am not going to tip and forget about me. Anyways great food...crapy wait staff. 80% of the time.
sarah b.,"Tacoma, WA",36,26,,2.0,4/11/2011,"certain menu items are very good like the bbq chicken salad... however the food is very overpriced and the wait service is horrible, slow, unorganized, just bad.  I wish the host/hostess would wait tables or at least teach customer service to the wait staff."
Jeremy W.,"Tacoma, WA",64,73,39,5.0,1/9/2011,"I love going here, my favorite dish the open-faced meatloaf sandwich, it's excellent. One of the best sandwiches I believe I've ever had."
Ken E.,"Lakewood, WA",49,79,15,3.0,10/25/2010,"I had the sourdough guacamole chicken sandwich for the first time.  It's basically a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled chicken, guacamole, and swiss cheese.  The cheese was melted just right and the guacamole was fresh so it was a good sandwich overall."
Jennifer W.,"Tacoma, WA",14,14,1,3.0,1/2/2011,"Okay, when a friend from work had her birthday party here, I thought, oh great, it's one of THOSE kind of places - like a Red Robin or something. I mean, it's in the mall parking lot, and huge, so how good can it be? And I was so pleasantly surprised! What I have experienced there is delicious. When I first went they didn't have the gluten free pizza yet, so I ordered the Sesame Chicken Salad without the wonton skins. It was, and continues to be, fresh and delicious every time I order it. If you are GF, you might ask for extra almonds; the last time they were skimpy on them, and if you get it without the wontons it really benefits from the almond crunch. I also had the thin cut fries (YUM!) and my boyfriend had the Oreo cookie Pazookie. I slipped off my gluten free wagon, ate half of it and it was so worth it. It seemed, at the time I was eating it, to be the most heavenly dessert I'd ever experienced. Since that time, I've had the gluten free pizza (also without cheese). I vastly prefer it to Garlic Jim's (their pizza is not my style). I also tried the house-made Cream Soda and enjoyed it thoroughly, although I would ask for ice next time. They have GF beer for those who want it, but I'm not a beer person so I can't say if it's any good.  Service isn't amazing, but I've never seen it as bad as some have reported. Also I saw some reviews that say it's typical chain food (frozen & microwaved), but I would say that depends on what you order. So far I am pretty happy with the fries, pizza and salads. And oh yeah -- there are some darn good cocktails!   Also, the service where you call in an order and have them bring it to your car is very cool. They also have a separate counter for take out orders so you can just park and go in too. In fact, you can do your whole order online. The takeout has always been fast and friendly."
Heidi O.,"Tacoma, WA",8,8,,4.0,1/28/2011,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to a great cheeseburger and this place never disappoints.  Their BJ burgers are one of the best burger's I've ever had!  No joke!  The meat has just enough fat in it to make it juicy and flavorful but not greasy at all!  Their ingredients are always super fresh and they always pile them on.  If you ask for extra something on your burger they will usually bring you a whole separate bowl of it.  While I usually go for their burgers, I've also gotten some of their soups, and their giant baked potatoes which are amazing as well.  It's always busy here unfortunately and don't plan on getting a table in less than an hour if you don't call ahead if you go in the evening; especially weekends.  The staff is friendly and prompt.  They've got a great bar area with TV's everywhere although I usually stick to the dining area."
Ashley S.,"Portland, OR",33,172,49,3.0,8/20/2010,"All laughs aside, BJs was great. Our waiter is easily the best waitress I have had. My calzone was very creamy and tasty. At some points the texture was that of a creamy spinach dipping sauce, but tasted excellent. There were huge chunks of artichokes which is awesome, I have had too many experiences with artichoke in things where it is barely noticeable. I highly recommend smothering it with the red marinara type sauce. I enjoyed the Irish cider a mix of one of their beers with some pear cider. Yummy."
Christopher P.,"Tacoma, WA",2,11,,3.0,2/22/2009,"BJ's is another brew house that offers a large selection of food and a nice selection of beer. The food is good, but nothing special. It seems that BJ's went on par with all the other brew houses. Take beer, add some burgers, steaks, and salads. Finally throw some plasma TV's everywhere and mix.  I would say that if you are in the area and want to have a meal for a reasonable price go to BJ's. They have a lot of room and can accommodate  larger groups. I wouldn't make this a destination restaurant by any means though."
Ms. V H.,"University Place, WA",0,7,,4.0,5/21/2011,"I went to BJ's with a group of 6 during dinner. There was no wait and we were seated in a good location. Our food came out super quick! For starters we had a sampler including mozzerella sticks, egg rolls and a few other things. All very good at hot. I was stuffed before my meal came out. I had a burger on sourdough with chipotle mayo and melted cheese. I took two bites and it was fantastic even though I couldnt finish. My boyfriend had to take it for lunch the next day. He said it tasted great cold as well. They have a great selection of drinks. I also love their sampler for the beers. Too many to choose from! Service was nice and out waitress fixed other's sides when they came out incorrect, or without a topping. Not her fault and she corrected it fast. I will be going back again!!"
John H.,"North Easton, MA",0,15,1,4.0,5/18/2011,Its a chain restaurant but the food is good with lots of choices.  Beers galore and very clean.
Kevin B.,"Federal Way, WA",12,2,1,4.0,1/16/2011,"Met here for a friend's birthday on the Monday before Christmas. This location is adjacent to the mall and both were packed. The food was quite good and most of it came on time, but it took forever for our friends to get their pizza. Overall, we had a good time, the staff managed the crowd well and I became a fan of the unique dishes on their menu. My wife and I made a meal of three different appetizers, including my new favorite the Thai lettuce wraps. If you are a fan of dark ales, you should try the Tatonka Stout. Yum in a glass!"
Tracy P.,"Olympia, WA",0,25,,3.0,12/20/2010,"We thought that we'd sit at the bar while waiting for a table in the main dining area...We decided to stay, it was so nice. For a bar. I would give it more than three stars if it had not been for the bar tendress other than ours whom my hubby and I watched be short and rude to her patrons.  We were lucky, ours was a sweetie. The food was pretty good and the chicken was really tender.  I recommend the garden salad with pecans:)"
Arin W.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,2.0,8/6/2014,"We stopped by to celebrate some good news with great food and good beer. We were seated quickly as they were not overly busy. The beer came quickly and was delicious. We ordered two burgers, figuring it would be a quick meal to make as we were hungry and it was getting late. Around 40 minutes later, the manager comes over and tells us that when the cook plated our meals, he didn't like how it looked, so he was remaking everything...  No apologies or anything. I decided to order a side salad to tide us over, the waitress said she would go make that up real quick... 10 minutes later she walks by with no salad, I told her to just forget about it. Another 10 minutes go by and finally we get our meals. The food was great, but it really shouldn't take that long for two burgers. We asked for boxes and our check as soon as we received our meals. Unfortunately this is not the first time we have had issues- undercooked food, took way too long, etc... I doubt we will come back after all these issues. We only got an apology when we were getting ready to leave. At least the waitress was nice, can't say the same for the manager..."
Gregory J.,"Tacoma, WA",0,9,,5.0,9/20/2011,"After seeing the reviews on here my girlfriend and I were apprehensive to try this restaurant, we were so glad that we did! There was not one thing about our visit here that we did not like (save for the fact that they carry Pepsi products instead of coke) The staff is friendly and helpful, and even though the restaurant had every table taken the service was excellent and the food was hot when it came out. (hot enough to burn my mouth hot, which never happens!) From the avocado egg rolls to the red velvet cookie dessert (both which I highly recommend), the food was amazing and very reasonably priced. I will definitely be going back and telling all that I know about this wonderful our experience was at this place."
Megan A.,"DuPont, WA",1,14,,5.0,1/14/2011,I think this place is one of my favorite places to eat around here. My husand and I always sit in the bar area and we love to drink good quality microbrews. BJ's has a wonderful selection of beers and cocktails. Their menu can be a bit overwhelming as it looks like a book but everything I have tried has been delicious. My favorite menu item are their fish tacos - they are sooo good! I also love the Avocado eggroll appetizers. I would go to this place more often if I lived closer. This place ROCKS!
Liz D.,"Olympia, WA",4,20,,5.0,9/26/2010,"I love this place for happy hour.  The food is reasonably priced, and I have never had anything that I didn't like.  The flatbread pizzas are especially good.  My favorite part are the beers on tap.  They have everything!!!  Try the Schneider Avetinus.  (spelling??)  Is one of my all time favorite beers!"
Susan A.,"Kent, WA",0,3,,5.0,1/3/2013,"""Great food and excellent service! Our server, Valerie, was so nice! Everything was cooked just right and served quickly! The hostesses were kinda rude and dismissive, but other than that...excellent!"""
Mike P.,"Tacoma, WA",0,11,,1.0,11/5/2009,"I must point out I've only been there once, so my rating might change if I ever go in there again.  But, based on my first visit, I'd give it a Suck Factor of +10.  Horrible (bad attitude, eff'd up our order, as bright as a 10 watt lightbulb) waitress, bad food, overpriced garbage.  Their beer selection is decent....my beer held my hand as I journeyed through this downward spiral of dining.  I'd rather go to any other chain restaurant (with the exception of Chuck E. Cheese) than visit here again."
Alison S.,"Lakewood, WA",1,16,,4.0,12/6/2012,"Love this place.  Avocado egg rolls are awesome, as is most of the food.  Good drinks, not too strong.  Not bad for the $$"
