Danielle D.,"Fort Lee, VA",83,24,,3.0,8/27/2010,"Pazookies are very yummy!!  Lots to pick from, good deal on lunch specials.  The food is good but not great."
Sarah G.,"Lacey, WA",20,5,,4.0,7/2/2012,"Had a wonderful early lunch here the other day.  Hadn't planned on stopping but wasn't sure where to go for a bloody mary and app.  Bloody mary was good and the appetizers were great.  I'm a huge fan of the chicken lettuce wraps which I can't seem to find anywhere.     We came early, so there wasn't a huge crowd.  Music was soft, so conversation was easy.  I noticed the bar was open to the restaurant and the entire restaurant is very open.  I could imagine the place becoming noisy when crowded - but can't say with certainty.  Waitress 'Sara' was wonderful."
Gina H.,"Newport News, VA",65,10,2,4.0,1/21/2010,"I defy you to find better a better deep dish pizza crust anywhere in T-town.  Krystal, our waitress, was simply awesome.  Definitely get a cream soda and share a pazookie for dessert  Portions are HUGE, prices are reasonable, service was exceptional."
Crystal C.,"Puyallup, WA",0,4,,4.0,6/12/2012,"I have never had a disappointing moment at BJ's...... oh I take that back, they don't have wifi available. Other than that, in my experience and I have been on many occasions, I have yet to have poor service or bad food. I love the fried artichokes and the Tai Shrimp Lettuce wraps. I get em every time I havn't tried anything else."
Tracie F.,"Tacoma, WA",35,34,5,3.0,4/7/2009,"I love the food at BJ's...when it is cooked all the way.  Twice I have gotten still frozen in the middle appetizers.  The service is atrocious, although I haven't had a rude server yet.  I think they mean well but can't quite get there.  Probably they are mostly new to the industry.  The mini pizzas are fabulous...the bacon cheeseburger and the spinach artichoke are my favorites.  My biggest problem there is that they are really bad about soda refills and retrieving drinks from the bar.  People are less likely to complain about the wait if they have something to drink.  The best thing about BJs is their happy hour...$5 mini pizzas!  I also think that the managers should find something to do other than stand in a corner of the room and gossip."
Mike C.,"Olympia, WA",30,31,3,5.0,4/8/2011,"stopped in after a day wondering Tacoma, really loved this place, had the fish and chips, with a bj's redhead Irish beer and it was fantastic! the fish came with a homemade tarter sauce and was perfect! next time I'll try their in house blonde, but I skeptical cause we all know redheads do it best!"
Cecilia N.,"Tacoma, WA",0,15,,3.0,8/27/2010,"This places only saving grace is the fact that my husband LOVES their wings and I am IN love with their cookies and cream pazookie.      Yes, IN love. It's delicious. Everything else I've tried is hit or miss. They have a really varied menu, so there is always something for everyone. But the only two things I've found to be consistent are the wings and pazookie."
Melly M.,"Hope Mills, NC",1,5,3,5.0,4/12/2011,"I eat at BJs all the time, they are one of the fastest during lunch. There staff is amazing and they follow strict guidlines that ensure you get the best service. Also our server last week was Amelia and she was more than extrodinary, anyone who says not is un pleasable. Would recomend this place to EVERYONE =) Best in Tacoma"
Savy S.,"Tacoma, WA",5,10,,4.0,2/9/2011,"The Cajun pasta was very good..Spinach Artichoke dip was good also.  I'm giving it a 4 stars due do the service. The host was ridiculous. Off all the to place to seat two people, she put us in the biggest booth available for 6-8 people.Idiot.We ask our server to move us to a smaller booth more fitting for two people.So he did. Overall the food was good but little bit pricey..."
Riley B.,"Tacoma, WA",0,17,,5.0,1/19/2009,MMMMM... Luv their pizza so fat and great. Haven't been there myself though their food makes it seem like heaven.
Bobby R.,"Tacoma, WA",0,2,,3.0,10/23/2009,"Service was great and the pumpkin ale was delicious. I tried the sourdough burger wasn't as good as i thought it would be, fries were skinny and cold."
