Nicole R.,"Lakewood, WA",56,24,27,3.0,9/12/2016,"Bjs is nice inside and I came at a good time , a lot of tables were open and we got a booth . Our server was nice , the food was okay but they seriously need a new bartender . The Bloody Mary I've been craving for days was a disappointment. Very gross . Otherwise good experience . $30 including a $5 tip for chicken , and a Bloody Mary . I split the artichoke hearts with a friend"
Lizzie K.,"Tacoma, WA",117,14,2,1.0,3/4/2017,"They don't take reservations. So when they ask you to call and make a ""reservation"" don't do it cause they don't take them:) They will tell you it's an hour wait, you might as well have walked in. So, if you are taking the time to call in and hold a seat have fun. We drove all the way here to celebrate someone's birthday and we prearranged seats and a time and we showed up and they told us to wait an hour. Go somewhere where they will hold to their word and give you great service for the money you pay. Will not be returning."
Ephesia W.,"Fort Polk, LA",22,8,3,5.0,4/17/2017,Food was AMAZING root beer ribs with white cheddar potatoes and asparagus and even the calamari was
Jerry M.,"Portland, OR",8,494,1318,4.0,12/6/2016,"Once again, my Yelp app directed me to a good meal.  I was visiting in Tacoma and shopping at Tacoma Mall, so I searched ""nearby"" on Yelp for restaurants.  There were several good options, but I decided to go to BJ's because they're conveniently located at the mall.  Upon entering the restaurant, my first impression was that this place looked a LOT nicer than the BJ's that used to be in Portland years ago.  This dining room had mansion-like architecture, classic looking with high ceilings.  Nice decorations too, with fancy paintings on the wall, chandeliers, etc.  Anyway, my main objective was FOOD: I had seen somewhere on Yelp that they have daily specials, and I was there on ""Baby Back Thursday"".  I love ribs anyway, so I was able to order a rack of baby back ribs at their special price which included two sides of my choice.  Everything was really good, the ribs were flavorful, moist and tender. . .and my two sides, grilled asparagus and wedge salad with blue cheese dressing were perfect accompaniments.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The whole experience there was really nice."
Anna T.,"Seattle, WA",206,87,78,4.0,7/13/2016,"I've been here multiple times and each time the service gets better. Today I brought a party of 9 for my little brothers birthday and we had Ruby as our server. We only had a 5 minute wait, yeah yeah so what if it was a Wednesday night, I'm still happy for not waiting long. Can't say for the weekends..Anyways she was awesome! So friendly and fun, she made the whole experience easy going! We got everything that we wanted. Everyone's meal came out fantastic except for this plate call the beach mahi mahi and shrimp(?) it was really mushy and salty...I hate complaining but my mom was the only one not enjoying it. I let Ruby know and she kindly took care of it for us. (Thank you!)  We also got a free mini chocolate chip pizookie for the birthday boy!  Service was fast and efficient. It's been a change from the past!"
Kayla G.,"West Des Moines, IA",0,3,,5.0,8/18/2017,I don't know how this place doesn't have 5 stars. We came here three times on our five day vacation because we were so impressed. Definitely recommend getting their chips and queso and a deep dish pizza and then dip the crust in the queso. We're from the Midwest so we were pretty excited to find a deep dish pizza and it was amazing. We just got the cheese and tomato but it was delicious. They have a good selection of beers - I loved their in house PM Porter and my boyfriend was a fan of the Hopburst. We sampled their desserts as well and our favorites were the salted caramel pizookie and the beignet. Try the sampler of mini pizookies! Wish we had one of these back home.
Brooklyn L.,"Auburn, WA",58,30,44,3.0,1/15/2017,"This is the place for groups to dine delicious meals. The proportions served for my orders have been fairly generous. They have all sorts of food on the menu: salads, burgers, chicken, you name it. Don't forget to try pizookies for dessert if you haven't before! Although I love the food they offer, I'd give it 3 stars for having tables a little too close to each other every time I dined and the long wait on busy days. But hey, if you don't mind waiting, it's the place for you to try. Quite clean and convenient for shoppers shopping around the area."
Sabina I.,"Tacoma, WA",76,14,13,4.0,8/10/2016,"Good food, great atmosphere ! The wait is pretty long at times, especially on the weekends, but it's worth it."
Lance M.,"Whittier, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/4/2017,"If it were possible to rate 0 stars I would. Without any exaggeration this was the worst dining experience I've ever had. First the waitress brought my wife the wrong dish so I had to eat my dinner while she sat and watched me. Every component of my dish was a fail to all senses, I couldn't even force myself to eat all of it. The insult to injury was bill because not only was it brought with my wife's correct dish on it but also the initial wrong dish which she didn't order in the first place. I had to get up and find my waitress to have one of her entrees removed. My card was ran once for 59.07 and another time for 48.11. Was not given a void receipt for the initial transaction so my unpleasant experience will continue even after the dining is long over because I must now call my bank which is closed on sundays."
Chris D.,"Myrtle Point, OR",2,41,2,1.0,4/9/2016,"Having eaten at the South Hill Mall location several times, we decided to forgo any other dining options at the Tacoma Mall, and just head to BJ's. What a mistake. The wait time, which the hostess said was a couple of minutes, was actually closer to 25 minutes, and an entire section of the restaurant (where we wound up eventually being seated), was open. The food was all underseasoned and overly greasy. The server took the time to specifically ask me if medium-well was acceptable for the cook on my burger, to which I said yes, but apparently medium-well means ""cook it to within an inch of its life, and make sure it's extra dry and crumbly."" There was so little cheese on the burger as to be almost unrecognizable. My wife had the bacon, avocado, and tomato grilled cheese, and actually had to open the sandwich and salt it so that it would taste. The lady at the table next to ours ordered the mixed veg as a side with her entree, and had to send it back twice. The second time, the server told her ""they're bad because they come in frozen, and they're portioned out the night before and then microwaved for service."" Eww."
Michael D.,"Tacoma, WA",4,4,,1.0,2/12/2017,Burger sucked.  Way too dense and overcooked.  They dont serve the one thing that made this an attraction anymore.  The thin fries are now gone and they didnt bother changing the menus or telling the wait staff.  Manager shouldnt have a job anymore.
Russell E.,"Tacoma, WA",1,13,1,1.0,4/15/2016,"If i was rating based on the food, maybe 3.5 stars. The service is TERRIBLE. They sat us down and got our drinks, then had us wait for 45 mins for food. They didn't refill our glasses for an hour until i told a waitress from a completely different section. She poured water in my ice tea and said ""oops, now you have tea water"" then she didn't fix it. At an hour the same waitress from a different section came and asked if we had gotten all our food...we hadn't. 30 mins later we got our second dish, our drinks we bought were still not refilled. I demanded the check and surprise! Heres our original waitress again to ask if we wanted refills and collect her tip. Where she went for an hour and a half, who knows? I will NEVER come here again."
Josh B.,"Lacey, WA",256,905,6224,5.0,4/20/2015,"I can say right off the bat that this lady was our server (name starts with ""Sa"" and ends with ""m"" as many reviews get removed for using names) and she was AMAZING. It was her last day and she was really candid and just really personable and an awesome server. We sat in the bar area although there wasn't a wait when we came.  My friend and I just got our bonuses, so we had a ""Treat yo' self Day"". We started with mimosas followed by other drinks and our appetizer of avocado egg rolls which were also amazing. The egg rolls had excellent flavor and the dipping sauce that was thick and dark was also a nice accompaniment. I don't really know what the sauce was though. Who'd a thunk though, avocado and egg roll together just perfect.  Then the main entrees came shortly after small conversations with our server. It was really a personalized experience even though she had several other tables that she was handling and also one of the big bosses was in town and had a whole table to himself just looking down on the parade of servers and hosts and patrons waltzing below.  My friend got fish tacos which basically she devoured in about 5 minutes because yet again they were amazing. I got a deep dish 9"" pizza with onions and olives. Yusssss gawd! Just perfect. I know I sound like a broken record but it was just almost too good to be true. It was my first time trying a Bloody Mary as well, and eh...it wasn't bad. I'll stick to shots shots shots shots shots shots shots! Just kidding just kidding, but seriously...even after appetizers and entrees and drinks, I still didn't feel overly full. I don't like leaving a restaurant feeling miserable after stuffing myself, so yet again it was perfect.  The ambience is decent as well. It's kind of an obvious sports bar but there are all different games/channels on so there is variety. Also, the servers don't overly pester you just to get through their service. They seem pretty respectful of the fact that people are actually trying to have an experience and not just there to eat. Definitely will be back."
Mercedez J.,"Graham, WA",144,5,,1.0,1/21/2017,"We waited for over an hour to be seated, when there were multiple tables available, finally sat us down and waited for another 10 minutes just to be greeted. This place is understaffed and very slow."
Tempest C.,"Tacoma, WA",48,9,14,5.0,6/29/2016,"This was my first time here at the Tacoma Mall location for BJ 's restaurant, amazing service by Shannette C. She remembered our orders without even using a pen, no mistakes or trouble. We got seated fast & friendly. I would most definitely be coming back here. Thank you so much for an amazing lunch"
Paula C.,"Maumee, OH",91,13,7,2.0,8/13/2016,"We were disappointed in our experience at BJ's this evening. Our dinners were good, but it was obvious from the get-go that our waitress was overwhelmed. She was rather argumentative, and didn't want to commit to which meals might be a good choice for dinner. The topper however, was when she ran our credit card. We explained to her before she took the card that our magnetic strip wasn't reading properly and that the card number would need to be entered manually. She returned to our table a few minutes later to explain that the card had been denied. We explained again that the card number would need to be entered manually. She said that she couldn't do that but would ask her manager. The manager returned a few minutes later to tell us the card had been declined. We asked if she had entered it manually or had swiped it. She got defensive and said she had swiped it and that should be sufficient. We tried to explain again that the credit card company knew about the problem and was sending us another card, but in the meantime, entering this card manually would work. And it had worked just fine in the 3 days leading up to this meal. The manager then back-peddled and said she had punched the card in and that we now needed to pay for our meal by other means.  After paying for our meal with another card, we went shopping in the mall next door. Funny, the two stores we visited there had no problem running our card. We will not be visiting BJ's again any time soon!"
Leif I.,"Puyallup, WA",0,3,3,3.0,1/4/2017,Food was great! I ordered the Jambalaya which was really spicy but good so prepare yourselves for a little heat. I also ordered a mini 5 meat pizza which was really delicious. I would have given them 5 stars however service was horrible. Our waitress seemed more interested in rushing us all through out the visit from the time we looked at our menus to the the time we left. She didn't seem as focused also when we were talking to her about our order and when we had questions about some of the items on the menu. Great food but really poor service.
Sharon L.,"Tacoma, WA",12,47,47,3.0,5/5/2016,"I had been here before, but to me it was pricy and unforgettable. We decided to come for my son's birthday. I had the triple decker sandwich. They had parmesan crusted chicken. Here's my problem. Everything was parmesan crusted, I am not a fan. My sandwich was ok my fries were good. So it was an alright experience.still pricy though but left the waitress a good top for attentive service."
Jm P.,"Tacoma, WA",25,9,292,1.0,3/13/2015,"Chicken wings were decent, had 3 different flavors bbq, sweet maui & hot buffalo. All tasty, it's hard to mess it up. ordered the mahi mahi tacos, 1 grilled and 1 fried. They were horrible. The cabbage slaw topping was soggy and something you could buy from an albertsons pre-made  salad bag. The sauce was salty as f*ck and the side tortilla chips tasted like they were deep fried in the same oil as the fish (they probably were).  The size of the mahi mahi was decent but not really any taste. pretty much OVERPRICED and UNDERRATED  just go to chipotle around the corner or sarku japan inside"
Arie L.,"Tacoma, WA",125,291,617,4.0,6/25/2014,"3.5 but honestly, I'm biased when there is wonderful service and a military discount for our service men & women.  Flavors, choices, taste is Pretty good for a chain, and they have a good deal on happy hour.  Atmosphere is more date vibe, and everybody is pretty mellow here. Dimly lit and a bit dark with a huge screen tv in the bar.  I've been here before with a girlfriend for the crisp tasting chopped bbq chicken salad and a bubbly hand tossed pizza. It was pretty good. Today we came solely for pizookies.  I ordered the gluten free, dh got the new salted caramel one, and our friend ordered the original chocolate chunk.  Honestly, I couldn't even tell mine was gluten free. 2 huge scoops of ice cream, and my dh got a ghiradelli chocolate square with it (which I stole). The salted caramel is delicious, but waaaay too huge of a portion for me. We could have shared, but not according to my husband, he finished his in a gulp.  Ill be back for hh! Can't wait to try it out and will update my review :)"
