Lucy V.,"Whittier, CA",5,13,13,1.0,1/3/2016,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR TODAYS EXPERIENCE  AWFUL!!! If I could give 0 stars I would! Let me just start off by saying we've been here a couple of times and the service has usually been okay, but today definitely made us regret coming here. My boyfriend & I came to get some lunch, as soon as we walked in the host was giving off an obnoxious vibe & the other host Maria was incredibly rude.  I've never been so upset about a restaurant visit.  We sat down in the very back, I didn't get our servers name but he was okay given we only saw him two times, when he brought out water and took our order we never saw him after that.  We got our food and it was okay, don't really have any complaints there.  While eating our food no one came and asked us how everything was or gave us refills or anything at all. I'd understand if the place were busy but it was so slow!  So that was unacceptable. When we were done with our food we waited 20 min YES 20 min to get our check, and no one came we were so fed up with the waiting we decided to get up our selves and ask for the check.  We arrived to the host area and asked for our check. The host was talking and being handsy with someone I assume was her boyfriend & didn't really pay attention to us (which again is unacceptable) .  We finally got her attention and she was down right rude!!! Her name was Maria, and she was awful.  Our server came over and literally said ""Awwww I forgot about you guys my bad I'm sorry"" that honestly just made everything worse.  All in all this experience was terrible.  From a previous host/server to the servers/host who are present now GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER today was unacceptable"
Lisa F.,"Lakewood, WA",14,50,1,4.0,10/26/2016,"I have been here many times in other areas was so happy when the opened in Tacoma, service is great and my favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza,  not too spicy but just enough heat and the flavor is buffalo all the way.  Great place to sit after a day of shopping at the Mall."
Madison P.,"Fremont, CA",0,5,3,1.0,1/21/2017,Horrible customer service. Have been waiting 30 minutes and was told to keep waiting because they had parties ahead of us when there is nobody waiting. There is a bunch of open tables and they are continuing to seat walk-ins no problem.
Amanda M.,"University Place, WA",176,219,448,3.0,2/17/2015,"This used to be one of my favorite places to dine at, but over time, some of the items were dropped and the quality of the food seems to have gone downhill.  The spinach and artichoke is amazing though - always has been.  But everything else... not really sure what happened.  The gourmet mac and cheese came out very soupy and had a weird taste to it.  The chile verde fries were soggy, granted the toppings were placed on top, but I mean the fries themselves, were soggy."
Junior F.,"Tacoma, WA",0,11,6,4.0,4/20/2016,Have been here many times and they have great service and the food is hit and miss. Not sure if it is because they go through cooks or their cooks are his not on the same page but their food is not consistent.  I have found that their lunch cooks seem to be much better than their evening cooks. Hence the 4 stars. But great place to go to for lunch and a reasonable price.
Robert C.,"Seattle, WA",22,10,8,4.0,11/11/2016,"I have had Christmas party catering at my house from BJ for the last 3 years. Fresh food. Wonderful accommodating staff. Best part was the free beer mug that i got. Oh, don't forget to try their avocado spring rolls. It has awesome taste and texture."
Chelsie S.,"Tacoma, WA",29,8,1,1.0,7/12/2016,"Every time I come here the customer service is awful! But this last time was thee absolute worst! My hubby and I decided to have lunch here on the 4th of July and when the woman sat us down she literally tossed the menus on the table and walked away. Did not look at us nor did she say anything. I thought maybe she was distracted. Our waiter came up and greeted us and we had to ask for a kids menu because the other woman did not even ask and didn't give us a chance to ask. So the other woman, not our waiter, comes with a kids menu and she does the same thing! Dropped it on the table and walked away quickly. My husband and I were so upset we almost left. We ordered our food and while we were sitting there I would catch her just glaring at our table. We witnessed her sitting other people and didn't give them the same treatment. I caught a picture of her because I think people should be aware of her and also hopefully management looks on here and recognizes her since I couldn't get her name."
Pam F.,"Steilacoom, WA",0,11,2,2.0,10/22/2016,Wow. My order app. Sriacha queso and chips.  They kept trying to give us what looked like potato chips and guac. Oops. Server input error. My order. Honeyed brussel sprouts...mush...my main meal: broccoli chs soup in bread bowl...what i got? Clam chowder! Color me unimpressed! They gave us a comp for 25...n9t sure if i will ever use it. Sadness.
Molly L.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,90,17,3.0,2/19/2017,"I went to BJ's today for lunch with a friend. I had the derby Cobb and it was delicious! He ordered a chicken Caesar and did not get the side of ranch he ordered. I had a sauce blanc which was okay.. then we both ordered mixed drinks, both had coke or Diet Coke in them and the drinks tasted like they had been sitting for an hour even though she just made them. The soda was completely flat. Overall our experience was fine, service was okay, but it was nothing special."
Jasmine G.,"Seattle, WA",196,43,20,1.0,10/11/2015,"This was my third visit to the Tacoma BJs. My previous visits were awesome - food and service and was great! This time I was in a hurry so called in my order to go. This is where things went very, very badly. I asked for a personal sized cheese pizza worth bacon. She repeated my order back to me as a pizza with pepperoni. As someone who hates pepperoni I was dumbfounded and repeated back to her ""no pepperoni, just bacon."" She said okay, my total and that it would be 15-20 minutes. I arrived and went straight to the takeout counter where I stood for a solid 8-10 minutes as several waiters and waitresses went in and out. I could see my order sitting there getting cold so I went to the hostess to let her know I was waiting. She said ""okay"" and walked to the back and reappeared a few minutes later not acknowledging me or my food. About two minutes later a man appeared to give me my food and take care of the bill. He opened the box and the pizza had - you guessed it - pepperoni on top. I told him I had asked for bacon and the ordering story. I was in a hurry so I took the pizza as is. The guy said there was still bacon on top though. As I paid I opened the box again and didn't see any visible bacon and I asked the guy AGAIN if there was bacon on top - he assured me there was.  Fast forward to me eating the food, cold by then, and sure enough there wasn't any bacon on the thing at all and barely any pizza sauce. I checked the label on the box and all it said was pepperoni and the receipt only said pepperoni as well. The guy lied to my face about it because he also saw the label and receipt.  The food at BJs is awesome and the vibe is great, but I would highly recommend taking in the experience at a nearby location (Tukwila, etc) for better service where they don't lie to your face about their errors."
Bruce F.,"Milton, WA",69,632,210,4.0,11/4/2014,Friendly.  Front desk could be improved   Ahi salid good nacho ok The biggest problem with this place is the lady at the front desk.   Last time my wife said lets go - based on our greeting or lack of.   This time it was at best robotic - sort of sets the tone.  It is a Red Robin on steroids with a hint of the Cheesecake Factory in look.   I think the look of the place was one of the best features.     Our server was pleasant and helpful. I had the Ahi Tuna salad which was really good (not cheap but not expense for the size and ingredients.   My wife had the Nacho's which she said were good but not something she would order again  (not sure what that means  :))  Overall I would come again - although not often since the price is a factor.   If I could just get in without going past the lady manning the front desk.
Stacy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,192,28,3.0,7/20/2016,"solid bj's outside of the tacoma mall. they have lots of big tables where they can accommodate large parties, and they easily accommodated our group of 11 at lunch.  their menu has now gotten ginormous, but i still return to my go-to, their deep dish pizza. i forget that the mini deep dish doesn't come with the cast iron pan, but all the other sizes do. their home made root beer is okay, but they at least have free refills. long story short, come here if you have lots of people you would like to please. otherwise, there are better places to go in tacoma."
LaraMichelle L.,"Tacoma, WA",30,12,,1.0,8/15/2015,"Really not worth it.  We have been to this location a few times and it is always the same. Long wait time to be seated, food is tasteless and over priced. Service isn't horrible but it really depends on how they feel that day.  I would save yourself the hassle and just pick somewhere else."
Cassie M.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,2,2.0,9/19/2016,They have a great broccoli and cheddar soup and bread bowl! Probably the only thing I would continue to come back here for. The service was terrible. And our entrees we hardly ate any of. Took about 20 minutes for our server to even bring us our check... Very disappointed in our experience.
Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",504,559,1042,4.0,4/4/2013,"I have only been to BJ's twice now. I thought I wrote a review for the place, but maybe not? Well in that case, this particular outing, I ordered a Wildberry Mojito (first time trying one) and I ordered the Scampi Pasta which I have to say was amazingly delicious (: For my dad's birthday not too long ago, I made him shrimp linguine which almost tasted the same as yesterday's dinner (: Surprisingly, the pasta was not the usual ""over-done oily"" that I despise when wanting to order a pasta dish. I really liked the crumbly things sprinkled over my whole bowl of noodles. The two sticks of bread, I was not particularly fond of. My friends' ordered the Hawaiian Maui Maui which... was WAY SMALLER in portion than we had expected... of course pictures on a menu is deceiving at times. The Maui Maui fish was ... quite salty and I could barely taste the pineapple fried rice that had been buried underneath. My other friend had ordered the Salmon and Lobster special on one of the separate pamphlets tucked inside the menu. I think the salmon was a little well done for my taste. I would give 3 stars for my friends' dishes but I give it a 4 just because I liked my previous experience here and my mojito was good. Because I haven't tried a mojito before, I was expecting tons of minty flavor but got mostly sweetness out of it. I do not know if most places don't rip up the leaves and squash them beneath the cup but the place I used to work at, they would rip up into tiny pieces and pound them down and then add the alcohol(:"
Mariah N.,"San Diego, CA",149,23,63,3.0,9/13/2014,"I have mixed emotions about this BJ's. I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance for a group of 25, my hubby's birthday. I was told it would be no problem and they would give me a call the morning it just to confirm everything. I called the day before just to confirm everything myself and spoke to a different manager. Turns out ALOT if information was left out. Such as we could no longer order from the menu and were forced to eat pizza and salad because of our size. Also, everything had to be on one check. That means $600 out of my pocket. After recovering this information, I had to uninvite a few people from my party, as cold hearted as it sounds just so we can have an open menu dinner.  Once we arrived, the service was excellent. Nice save BJ's, but I don't think I'll ever host parties here anymore due to the lack of communication."
Chloe M.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,1,4.0,12/2/2016,"I love BJ's mainly for the pizookies! I also love their burgers & thin fries. Service is always great for me here, and something new that I really like is that they offer a free little appetizer for kids (it's a freshly made garlic bread knot and fruit). It's become a regular place for me and my best friend with her 2 year old daughter, the kids appetizer makes a huge difference for her."
Princess P.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,6,5.0,2/13/2016,"I come here every so often, and always know the food will be pretty good. Coming in today was even better than normal because of the fantastic service. Danielle was our waitress and she was prompt, helpful, kind, and overall made my dining experience more enjoyable - despite it being a packed house on a Saturday afternoon. I would go back based on her service alone."
Sha P.,"Tacoma, WA",71,113,403,3.0,12/20/2015,This place is good for lunch. Multiple entree selections. A must to have is their Parmesan Chicken. The Southern Chicken is not what you would expect but good.
Paula L.,"OLALLA, WA",0,23,1,4.0,9/3/2016,"Overall, very good. Ordered 3 kids meals & 3 adult meals and a side baked potato for under $60. We used the online pickup. I ordered about 3:30pm for 5:30pm. They were about ten minutes late but considering it was a busy Friday night, not a problem. Everything was really good. One of the baked potatoes had a very obvious black spot and shouldn't have been served but this is the first time we have ever had anything remotely wrong. We tailgated at Cheney before the Rainiers game! We would definitely try this again."
