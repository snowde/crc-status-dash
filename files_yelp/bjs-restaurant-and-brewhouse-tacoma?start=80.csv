Stella R.,"Tacoma, WA",151,31,30,1.0,7/29/2015,"I came in on a lazy night to get apps and food to-go. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait on a server.. so the bartender Brent comes over speaking 500 words a minute, and I ask him ""What was your name again?"" I didn't understand it and he seemed offended but I honestly was trying to know his name. So as a 28 year old 12 year industry vet, I understand to check ID's. But please understand that sometimes a woman doesn't want to wear makeup, spray tan, do her hair and weighs 18lbs more as the my license indicates (thank you senior year, but I've been slowly losing and am going to grad school!!).  I felt that he had a chip on his shoulder towards me from earlier because he went to the back to have his manager double check my license but not my friend's vertical one. He then proceeds to walk out with my license in his hand asking me to read the address listed.. shit!! I haven't lived there in almost two years. Of course I remembered it to the T but I was so offended and felt like I was guilty for having good genes that God blessed me w in my youthful appearance.  This is the second time here in which I received bad service. And who knows, perhaps I'm not seeing their side. But as a guest in your restaurant I want to be made to feel welcome. And I haven't here since the first time, and this is my third encounter. The South Center locale I've experienced twice and enjoyed my whole experience.  Don't get me wrong, they have good food for a chain including the caprese salad amongst others and pizzas that create a pants off dance off in my mouth. However I don't care to support this establishment-at least the Tacoma location, no matter how tasty some menu items are. I will walk away just as I did two nights ago and continue to never spend my money at this place specifically but at BJ's as a whole. The 1 star is the 4 for their food and is deducted by this location being the only place I've had two of the worst restaurant experiences at? As Drake tells us ""I'm just saying you could do better""."
Tom S.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,7,,4.0,7/15/2016,"We've been to BJ's several times and always find something to like.  I seem to find the same thing to like over and over again because I love the Tuscan Chicken Limone and always order it.  It's a little different each time, probably due to the variety of the menu and number of cooks in the kitchen but I've been happy with it each time.  My date, a.k.a., my lovely wife, enjoys more variety and went with the Chicken Fried Steak this time (pure comfort food) but I won't be surprised to see her stick with that dish next time around.  Their beers are good, some of them are great like the Grand Cru when in season.  Try the current special Oktoberfest for a real treat.  Service has always been friendly and timely. Overall, they do a great job for a big mass production restaurant and bar."
Craig D.,"Salem, OR",16,66,19,5.0,6/24/2016,Great food.  So many options.  It was really busy and we still got excellent service.
Yen E.,"DuPont, WA",172,394,328,3.0,6/3/2013,"My friend and I came here on Friday for lunch and our waiter Matt was awesome!   My friend ordered their Thai Salad which she exclaimed how delicious it was and even our waiter complimented on her choice saying it's the best salad.   I ordered their lunch special which was half pasta and half salad.  My salad came and they drenched it in ranch.  Meh.  5 bites into my salad, our fried calamari arrived... loved their aioli dipping sauce.  Before we could even dig into our appetizer, our main course arrived.  Thumbs up for fast service, but I felt so overwhelmed.  I had ordered their fettuccine alfredo with broccoli and it didn't taste that great really.  There was definitely something missing in their alfredo sauce. To end our meal, we ordered a chocolate chunk pizookie.  Now, my friend whose from out of town (New Mexico) has never had a pizookie, let alone heard of it and she was in heaven after the first bite."
E R.,"Tacoma, WA",3,9,4,2.0,8/5/2015,"We arrived at BJs and were given a pager and told it would be about a 30 minute wait. We waited about 45 minutes. This was after we asked how much longer, the hostess looked at the list and couldn't find our name and said they were going to seat us after one more group. In the mean time, another large party that arrived after us were satbbefore us. We get sat down and things were fine. Dinner came out ok. Unfortunately the waitor didn't check on us until after our meal was done. We then ordered dessert, the waiter proceed to bring us the bill before our dessert came out. Working in a restaurant for many years, you never bring a bill out before the meal has finished being served. Overall one of theb worst experiences we've ever had.  Then the restroom was so trashed. There was paper everywhere toilets had paper stuffed in them. Paper on the floors, trash full, no soap. We mentioned it to the hostess and all she did was apologize. We used the bathroom again a little while later and still dirty and no soap. I was contacted by the manager and asked to email him. I have since done so and received a courtesy credit to come back in and give BJs another chance. I do appreciate the manager taking time to respond and try to make things right. I will update my experience when we go back."
Lani B.,"Seattle, WA",13,11,11,2.0,6/5/2016,"Slow service. Waitress couldn't make a drink recommendation. Was attentive, and offered us dessert... And that's when we all realized she never put in our entree order."
Marcia P.,"Kent, WA",33,5,4,1.0,6/18/2016,Not a good experience this evening. Took forever and it wasn't crowded. My food was lukewarm. I used to like it here. Won't be coming back.
Lynsie C.,"Tacoma, WA",19,1,,1.0,1/3/2017,First off my friends and i were seated and we were not waited on for probably  15- 20 minutes the restaurant was not even busy probably around 5 tables in the entire place. My food wasn't very warm at all but it was alright didnt feel the need to complain because as a server myself its not their fault on how the food comes out. I ordered a Peach Margarita asked them to make it a double because at BJ's they never pour correctly. The server didn't feel the need to mention I would be paying for a whole other drink. So when it came to getting my bill I had payed for 20 bucks for 1 drink. I've been to many restaurants and I work in one as well and none of them charge you a whole 9 bucks for a double. We asked why it was so high for a double they didn't really have a valid explanation. So we paid and my friend was getting her son all ready to go and she could here our waitress Ruby complain about how much we tipped her. And really right in front of her. Very disrespectful. It made me never want to come back again.
Stan G.,"Port Orchard, WA",12,53,46,1.0,4/11/2015,"Dipshit bartender just wouldn't serve me because I didn't have my id. I am 44, and probably look 50. Still not the worst service I have had in this place."
Mari M.,"Tacoma, WA",2,45,5,3.0,9/1/2015,"The food for me here has been mediocre. Not a terrible place at all, just nothing too special"
Seth P.,"Tacoma, WA",30,292,29,4.0,3/29/2016,"I've been here a few times, same pleasant experience, I like the fact that they have their craft brews and the other typical beers you find at the local bar. The take out service is pretty descent but if you come in late like I did then expect to wait a while; the place will look empty, just wait patiently like I did for about 10-15 minutes and they'll show up to take care about of you."
Corinne M.,"Tacoma, WA",488,532,119,4.0,10/13/2013,"I guess that they just got a new GM, and it truly shows! Thank heavens, because I love coming here, and it's not been the best experience the last few times.  The service was the best we had gotten in a long time, and the food was REALLY good! I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, and it was really really good, and browned just right, I couldn't have asked for anything to be different.  My son ordered from their BIG kids menu, and loved it, he got some chicken pasta, and he loved broccoli, but would have preferred the broccoli on the side.  I'm really excited to see how they turn things around here, they are off to a good start.  The only thing that was not so good, was that they advertise call ahead seating, and we did that, and when we got there, this girl said, oh now what do I do, so she clearly didn't put us where we should have been on the list., we were told that it was a 10 minute wait, and after waiting for over 20 minutes, I went up to see what was going on, and they took us right back, I was not digging that.  Again, things are changing, and I'm so happy, maybe they'll work on the call ahead seating too."
Cameron G.,"Tacoma, WA",73,5,2,5.0,10/9/2015,"I've been eating at this Bj's since it first opened at this location and I could eat from their menu all day. Sadly yesterday I ordered a pizza to go for work on my lunch break and it came out terrible.. The wrong sauce and looked depressing to pay $30 for. A simple phone call and promise to replace at a time of my convenience. But I'm always hungry so I zoomed back to have the correct pizza waiting. The Pizza should be a staple here (and the stuffed baked potatoes). I know the Buffalo chicken pizza probably isn't made too often, but when it's done right it is magical!! They immediately returned the trust my stomach needs from a solid restaurant. Huge thanks to management and staff for the replacement. I will be a customer as long as the doors remain open."
Austin S.,"Warrenton, OR",0,4,,1.0,1/23/2016,"If I could give a zero I would. Sitting here now. 45 mins to receive my appetizer, only to receive it with our cold food. Cold sandwich, cold and dry potato. Stay away.  Highly disappointed!!!!!!! I will never go back."
Doug H.,"Tacoma, WA",40,1,,5.0,5/6/2016,"Love the lunch soup & salad combos... unlimited. If you want the best of courteous & friendly service, sit at the bar during lunch time... Rachel is one of the best servers I have seen there. Chilli is a must! Just stop by and find out for yourself."
Rachel M.,"Port Orchard, WA",0,1,,1.0,10/29/2016,"While I like the food and the fact that there are lots of choices, the service at this location has been awful the last two times I have eaten here.  My husband got his burger well ahead of the rest of our food.  They tried to bring my food when he was about halfway done with his sandwich, but the order was wrong.  He finished his burger before the kids' food was delivered.  No apologies for the delays.  And they acted like it was my fault that my order was wrong.  And please don't expect drink refills!  The waitress finally asked but as we were ending the meal.  And the wait to get the check was quite long."
Angela N.,"Seattle, WA",1,10,,3.0,4/26/2016,"When we arrived it was pretty busy. Our waiter was managing probably 6-7 tables. Two of them large parties. So when he forgot to order my appetizer I didn't mind. I just ordered something else. He never came around to fill my water glass again. He forgot my daughter's chocolate milk. The food seemed to take forever, but he was a really nice waiter and it was busy, initially. The food was also fabulous. It tasted amazing. The only thing that could have been better was the service itself."
Alisia H.,"Tacoma, WA",0,18,3,1.0,10/22/2016,"Pros : Many food choices CONS : 10/21/16 two coworkers and I came in for lunch from 12-1. We were not asked if we'd like to sit at a table or booth. Hostess assumed we would be okay with a table. Once we got to the table we asked for a booth(sitting at a dinner table with booths around you is like putting you on display). The hostess goes on to say the booth(one out of many open) was not clean and that a busser would need to wipe it off. In my opinion the hostess could have been more forward thinking and could have walked a few steps and grab a rag considering the busser could have been busy. But I guess that was not her job so she didn't have to do it despite the fact I've seen many hostess wipe a table. We ended up sitting at the table. We are then greeted by the waitress who takes our drink order. I give her my ID and embarrassed me in front of my coworkers. I've gained quite a bit of weight, stopped tanning, And stopped bleaching my hair. She asked me to close my mouth(I have braces) and gestured with her hands around her face as if it's different. Yes! It's rounder and now I have a second chin! I had this happen once before...I was asked my address, tested on another random info listed on my ID, and had to show my debit card with my name(more professional). We had ordered our food assuming she was splitting it up or could do it at the end. Our check came as one and was never asked! What she did ask was if we were splitting the check evenly. We agreed but my coworkers and I go to lunch daily and this was a first of being asked to split it. Check was split evenly and we all 3 signed separate receipts.  FINAL STRAW : I checked my account the next day(today) and I see I was charged for double but in one transaction! I spoke to a manager who couldn't help me because I don't know the waitresses name and I don't have the receipt. She did end up taking my debit card # and states someone will call me next day. This was my first time in the restaurant and WOW!!! If you go here I suggest you take names and keep that receipt. I did not authorize the transaction amount debited.  NEXT DAY : I was called early and issue will be fixed."
Danielle Z.,"Seattle, WA",2,3,,3.0,12/14/2014,"The food was great and tasty. However, the service was absolutely horrible. We arrived at 145 for our 2pm reservation and was not seated until 2:20. We ordered our drinks and had them ten or so minutes later. I was with a large party, and out of the 8glasses of water, 2 glasses were cracked in half. We ordered when we got our drinks, but weren't served food until 3pm. Three orders were messed up-either missing food or completely wrong. I don't think we ever actually had our silverware. A seahawks game was playing and all of the servers paid more attention to the TVs instead of their patrons. McDonalds is more friendly. The food seemed over priced, 10-18$ for an entree when compared to the size of the food you get  Reccomendation: go here, expect to stay a while, and be aware that the servers aren't trained to provide good service."
Bob P.,"Tacoma, WA",19,17,,3.0,3/6/2016,The food was very good the only problem was that the salad and main dish came at the same time . I m glad I didn't order dessert until dinner was finished
