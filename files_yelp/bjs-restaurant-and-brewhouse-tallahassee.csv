Marcy H.,"Tallahassee, FL",206,103,249,4.0,1/10/2018,"BJ's satisfies my embarrassing love of all things cozy and comforting in a way that other big chains never could.  As many others have mentioned it's a much better (albeit slightly pricier) alternative to other chains like Applebee's and Chili's. They brew a lot of their own beers and many of them are actually really good!  I came on a Saturday night at 7pm and they were completely slammed. We put our name down and went to Target to kill the 35 minutes the Maitre D' told us we'd have to wait. When we came back she sat us immediately. The place is huge which I feel like makes it difficult to manage effectively but they seem to do a pretty good job.  The menu is extensive, and I feel like I'm a prime victim of chronic indecisiveness; however the menu is very well organized and has a lot of very different items which makes it much easier to choose. I love that they have everything from super healthy to sinful gluttony and everything in between. Their kids menu is also awesome and allows you to pick various items for their meal.  The service was great (although a bit slow I imagine because the place is so huge and busy) and the food was scrumptious. My husband loved his burger, and I ordered the Santa Fe Salad with shrimp. That salad was a shocking flavor bomb and did not make me regret not ordering the fish and chips that my pregnancy cravings tried to hijack my brain to order. It was dusted with the blackening seasoning they use for the shrimp which was delicious and it was chock full of shrimpies, crispy tortilla strips, corn, beans and cheese. The dressing was delicious too (I asked for it on the side because I'm healthy like that).   My husband and I both really enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back to try the other 5 million menu items!"
Brandi C.,"Tallahassee, FL",187,100,646,4.0,12/14/2017,"FOOD/DRINKS: I love the menu at BJ's because there is variety and I am pretty certain there is something for everyone. I love the variety of beer and I would have to say that the pizza is at the top of the list as far as favorites. The pizza is also 1/2 off on Monday's. There is a late night menu as well as happy hour specials. The bar area is pretty spacious; yet cozy and it would be a good place to watch a sporting event.   SERVICE: The service has been pretty good on most visits. I did have bad experience one night with a large party but that doesn't outweigh the positive service that I have received. On my last visit, our server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. He answered all of our questions without hesitation and gave recommendations when we asked. He frequently checked on us and when the kitchen made my order wrong, he immediately took it back and apologized.   ATMOSPHERE: ""Upscale casual"". This restaurant is a nice size and has a bit of an intimate feel. Ok for groups.  LOCATION: Ample parking. Parking lot PROs- Food variety, happy hour specials and late night menu. CONs- None"
Dottie T.,"Tallahassee, FL",29,48,116,3.0,12/9/2017,We had a very nice lunch here. We wanted to go to brunch at a nearby café but there was no way we were waiting in the line that was there. So we decided to go to BJ's. The main thing I wanted from brunch was the Mimosa which I was easily able to get there. The food was very good however the appetizer came out with the main meal and that was highly disappointing. The appetizer we ordered was the flat bread nachos and I'll have to say it's probably the best flat bread I've ever had. Extremely delicious. I will most definitely be getting that the next time I go there. I also got a Nashville spicy chicken sandwich I believe it was called and it was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. I was worried because I've had something with the same name other places and it was awful. I got a Caesar side salad with it which was definitely overdressed and wilted. Don't order that. Brad got their new chicken sandwich that has the ham and cheese I believe and he loved it. I didn't try it so I can't comment. I can tell you I will most definitely be going there again and I would've given four stars if the appetizer had come out first and the salad hadn't been wilted.
William L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1528,321,1478,4.0,10/14/2017,"Conveniently located across from Governor's Square Mall, I had the opportunity to dine with friends one evening on a recent visit to Tallahassee.    Arriving right as Happy Hour was ending - 6:56 p.m. - Damien H was our server.  My two friends and I were quickly seated in the bar area.  2  ""Happy Hour"" Bacardi and Coke's for me, and a white peach Margarita for each of my friends.  Dinner was quickly ordered - 10 piece bone-in chicken wings and a large gourmet five neat pizza.   Pizza was great - and only cost $12.98 with the 50 percent off Happy Hour special.  Chicken wings were average in taste and were priced 50 percent off at $5.63.  Margarita's were a dollar off at $8.50 each and the Bacardi and Coke's were $4.00 each for Happy Hour.  I'm a cheap date.   Damien was a friendly and polite server, although busy.  From my vantage point, he seemed overworked, but he did make it back to our table several times during our visit.  Restaurant was busy, but seemingly well run.  The hostess quickly seated all guests immediately upon arrival.  Plenty of parking and central location on Apalachee Parkway, near downtown Tallahassee.  Restrooms were clean and well stocked.   I would stop at this particular BJ's Restaurant on a future visit to Tallahassee, but most certainly during Happy Hour for the great specials. William E. Lewis Jr. Vero Beach, Florida."
George A.,"Tallahassee, FL",257,52,85,4.0,7/8/2017,So honestly I know this is chain restaurant and I was anticipating a 3 star rating but for me personally it earned a 4 star rating.  Food: The food came out pretty fast for a group of 10 people on a Saturday night so props to them. The food was better than I thought. Not 5 stars good honestly but better than average. I was pleasantly impressed  Service: Service was good prompt and polite. Refills were brought without me even asking.  All in all for a chain it's better than a lot of other places so well done BJ's
Daniel C.,"Norcross, GA",36,1,11,1.0,1/1/2018,Terrible service the waiter was not good at all. He brought me out one soda no refill at all. He had the nerve to come into the restroom to see if I had skipped out on the bill. I will never set foot in that place again.
Shantai M.,"Lakeland, FL",4,51,58,4.0,12/11/2017,"Took my brother, sister in law, and two nephews here when I was in town. I have been to the location that was in Tampa and the food was good. I ordered the flatbread, my nephews had the sliders, my brother had some sort of rice bowl with sausage, and my sister in law had pasta. My flat bread was tasty, despite an excess of grease. Our mixed drinks were mixed perfectly. Overall the atmosphere was perfect for a family night out. Everyone had a nice night out."
Peter B.,"Tallahassee, FL",14,22,,3.0,11/16/2017,"The food is fine, and the menu is extensive, but the service has been poor during our last several visits. In fact, it's become so poor, that we likely will avoid BJ's in the future.  Our group of 5 people arrived at 5:45 PM. A server did not come to our table until 5:55 PM. We ordered drinks.  The water and iced tea came in about 5 minutes, but those of us who ordered mixed drinks weren't served until 6:27 PM, about the same time our food arrived."
Katie S.,"Tallahassee, FL",271,35,1,4.0,10/8/2017,BJ's is a great restaurant for watching NFL Sunday or even a date night! They have a great beer selection with happy hour deals all throughout the week. With a large menu you are sure to find something for everyone in your party.
Richard A.,"Tallahassee, FL",35,78,27,4.0,6/24/2017,"Overall good experience at BJ's over several visits. As with most chains like BJ's you can have your good and bad days. This review is from today's visit only. We used the app to check in and get our name on the list. That gave us a wait less than 5 minutes. So not too shabby. Our waiter greeted us fairly quickly and was amazingly attentive from the minute we got there, to when we left. Service was a big plus for us this trip. BJ's has a big menu, but they have some good specialties like pizza that we enjoyed this time. We also had the Avocado egg roll appetizer which was very good and came with a tamarind sauce that was sweet and flavorful. BJ's is a good alternative to the Chilis, Applebees type places and they usually have decent promos if you are signed up and use the app."
Marshall C.,"Orlando, FL",0,2,,1.0,11/17/2017,Service is horrible. Not to busy plenty of servers?? I don't blame  the employees it's the management.  If I were corporate I would clean house. Don't go unless you have lots of time.
Joe L.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,81,136,4.0,5/9/2017,"Not a bad restaurant, but for the indecisive eater this restaurant menu can be overwhelming.  I recommend reviewing the menu before going to start to narrow it down to a few items.  The service was great!  Our waiter knew the menu well and was able to advise us as to what items best suit our needs.  I ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Good salsa and the chips were fresh.  I got a fresh homemade lemonade and tried the homemade root beer.  Both were good but I prefer the lemonade.  My main course was the tavern style Italian meat pizza.  It was thin crust, but not very crispy.  The grease kept it flimsy like a totinos pizza.  Dessert was beyond good.  I ordered the sea salt pizookie.  It was only $3 because it was a Tuesday special.  Definitely worth getting and highly recommended."
Ingrid B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,111,3,5.0,11/27/2017,Always reliable with a broad menu and generous drinks. Top it off with friendly service and it's a winner!
Maria Luisa E.,"Tallahassee, FL",19,20,10,4.0,11/8/2017,"I think BJ's is one of the best restaurants we have in Tallahassee. They serve good food & good service. Ive eaten here a few times, celebrated my birthday here & even shared the cake with our servers & they were delighted! There was one time we did not like the appetizer we ordered & they gladly replaced it with a different one. I would definitely come back."
Dennis B.,"Asheville, NC",0,2,,5.0,11/30/2017,We enjoyed our dinner. Food was excellent and I loved their beer.one of the better restaurants I have been to. Food was great and our waiter was awsome
Karen T.,"Cape Coral, FL",153,238,618,4.0,5/5/2016,"Our first visit was on the fly and we were impressed with some things and not as much with others.  Since then, I've done some yelp reading and decided we needed to go back and try some more of what they have to offer.   The seating and ambiance are still impressive.  The staff was once again friendly and attentive.  The highlights of our meal were:  Draft Root Beer, Root Beer Glazed Ribs, BJ's Brewhouse Classic Tavern Cut Pizza and the Pizookie Trio. It doesn't get better than a frosty mug of seriously good root beer.  BJ's is made with real sugar.  In addition to the root beer, they also have vanilla cream soda, orange cram soda and black cherry soda on draft.  AND they'll make any of them into a float upon request.  Giving into temptation occasionally can be a good thing, right? We shared the Root Beer Glazed Ribs to start.  They were cooked perfectly and the sauce was tasty.  They were gone in the blink of an eye.  Oh so tender meat and savory sauce.  Yes, please! BJ's Brewhouse Classic Tavern Cut Pizza is just the way we like it.  Thin crispy crust with flavorful tasty sauce.  It's topped with pepperoni, fresh mushroom and Italian sausage and BJ's 5 cheese blend.  Hot, fresh, crispy, cheesey goodness.  It ticked all our pizza-lovin' boxes.  WINNER The Pizookies will keep us coming back.  Time and time again.  We shared the Pizookie Trio this time:  Chocolate Chunk, Triple Chocolate with Ghiradelli and Peanut Butter.  Om nom nom nom.  I can't imagine ending a meal here without a Pizookie and I wouldn't question anyone starting a meal that way either. Final Assessment:  We're fans!  Not sure how we managed to not try a BJ's Brewhouse before but we'll be looking for them now."
Teresa H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,8,,2.0,10/28/2017,Make sure you aren't starving when you arrive. The wait time for your food is horrible. I have visited this location twice and its taken an hour to get food. The food was pretty good but the service is horrible. Both times the waitress have been missing in action. They aren't tip worthy and the location is not worth giving a third try.
Brittney G.,"Tallahassee, FL",477,220,137,4.0,2/27/2016,I've visited here twice once at night and the other during lunch hour I loved the fresh creme soda and root beer on tap. I had a pizza and my mother ordered wings they were delicious. The lighting is awkward during lunch time came in when they first opened and it was just entirely too dark for lunch time like mood lighting for a date.
Ralph S.,"Miramar Beach, FL",33,339,538,4.0,11/28/2016,"The menu at BJ's is extensive.  There will be something available to suit any taste with this many dishes available. I was able to order a lunchtime portion of spaghetti after 5 PM which was an accommodating service for diners.   The spaghetti was not up to the standard of many family owned Italian restaurants but it was still quite good. With such an extensive menu, I would expect that many dishes will not come out as being among the best available in restaurants but still tasting good.  The beer list was impressive. There is also wine available. While the wine list is not long, it is more than adequate for those who like to enjoy a good glass of wine with a meal. Service was very good. We were seated promptly and given an option of seating accommodations. Our server was prompt, answered all questions and was available throughout the meal to make sure we had everything we wanted.  Overall, a pleasant experience and worth a visit."
Melissa W.,"Valdosta, GA",0,20,35,5.0,5/30/2017,"First time at BJ's and we had a blast! Stopped in for a few beers and appetizers while shopping in Tallahassee for the day. We got a couple beer flights and chips and salsa .  Our server was amazing! Very attentive, polite, well dressed and knowledgeable about house beers. We tried 8 of the in house craft beers ranging from stouts to light blonde. I for one am an IPA girl so the Hopstorm was delicious! The menu is huge,  there is something for everyone. Burgers, tacos, pasta and salads! Great happy hour specials on cocktails and wine as well. Can't wait to come back!"
Soti M.,"Tallahassee, FL",10,14,40,5.0,1/27/2017,"Hubby and I went for the first time...Date night success!!! Service was great, food was great and our server Derek was awesome! We were seated almost immediately in a comfortable booth, the ambiance was relaxed and intimate. We received an extensive book like menu, and Derek was available to answer any questions we had. We started with calamari appetizer, a new mixed cocktail and a Sangria cocktail. Our main course consisted of...Hubby: Medium Sirloin Steak, Rice Pilaf, and roasted Asparagus... I had: Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl with red peppers, mushrooms and asparagus.. Our food was served hot and full of flavor, yum!! Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough room in the tummy for dessert, we will definitely be back not just for the desert but for their soup bread bowl which looked scrumptious!!"
Matt P.,"Tallahassee, FL",6,43,58,3.0,1/18/2017,Three of us had dinner this evening. Service was very good tonight. I had a small deep dish meat pizza. Crust was thick and light...toppings were very good. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed about 1/2. Thats all I could eat. The others ordered sliders and a burger and both enjoyed their dinners as well. Much more enjoyable experience this time around.
Shamik B.,"Tallahassee, FL",7,16,9,4.0,12/23/2016,"Went here for a friend's birthday. Their food selection is as extensive as it is impressive. I had the blackened bison burger and would definitely recommend. A friend wanted the chicken club sandwich without the bacon and I jokingly asked the waitress if I could have the bacon that my fried wasn't having. She happily obliged. Thank you!   Their in-house brews are pretty solid too, as are their cocktails. Also, my friend who had the birthday got a complimentary dessert at the end Would definitely recommend."
J Z.,"Wellington, FL",3,84,27,5.0,6/16/2017,"Came in for a weekend to drop kids off at FSU. while staying at the Hotel on the other side of rhe parking lot I decided  to meet my Aunt for dinner here. Just right meals and great Salad choices. after my aunt went back to wstch the FSU game at the stsdium I stayed and began to try several items on the menue with suggestions from rhe best Wait staff person I havr had in a long time! Dina, was the most attentive even with multiple busy tables and never let any of my water or other drink glasses empty! and made some exceptional flavor  suggestions when I could not decide on choices from the menu.  If you go to this BJ's ask for Dina and her smile will make your day and be sure to ask her suggestions, did not steer me wrong once."
Cote L.,"Tallahassee, FL",142,41,22,3.0,8/9/2017,"After having been to BJ's several times, I can honestly say that it is pretty good but nothing too spectacular. Being that this is a chain, I already know that it is not going to be mind blowing. The service has always been pretty great with the exception of one time after waiting 45 minutes for my food to be told that they ran out of what I ordered. Other than that, everything else has been okay. I can't say that I have ever left feeling super satisfied with what I ordered. My favorite thing about BJ's is probably the ""pizookies"" which is ice cream on top of a warm skillet cookie (absolutely incredible). I can say that for a chain, it is a little more of quality than others, so I will come here again."
Mary Pat R.,"Pompano Beach, FL",43,26,14,2.0,11/5/2017,"Walked in and gave name for a 5 minute wait. Hostess chatted with coworkers before taking us to a table. Server arrives and tells her name and how to correctly pronounce it. Weird just weird! They only serve Pepsi products but server neglects to tell us they hand craft sodas too. Order appetizers it very disappointing. Bussel sprouts were burnt. The avocado egg rolls were entirely too mushy. These looked great in photos. We ordered our entrees later to avoid a food pile up. Guess what? Not 2 minutes after our appetizers comes our entrees. The expediter asks to take away our appetizers. I tell our server, using the correct pronunciation, and she states ""we are getting ready for the rush so we are hurrying food out"". Daughter's Smoked Turkey Dip was very good. My Pulled Pork Sandwich was just okay. Portion was large but if it isn't good who cares. Will not be going back."
Sherry T.,"Tallahassee, FL",85,82,116,4.0,4/27/2016,"We have had two very good lunches since our off start last August. The past two times we sat at the bar and were treated to very able and congenial bartenders. Today we sipped house made sodas (very good) and sweet tea (also very good).  We shared a broccoli and cheese  soup that was very cheesy and tasty. I would have preferred more broccoli, but it was a nice appetizer course.  I tried the half triple decker with wedge fries and my companion had a grilled ham and cheese with wedge fries. These coated and tasty potatoes are like tiny tater logs that we love to get at chicken shacks. Sandwich meats were excellent quality and piled high. The only thing I could think to add to my sandwich might be an option to add bacon; everything needs bacon. We left with happy, full bellies AND leftovers and change in our pockets. Excellent value! We will be back; maybe for dinner so I can try a flight of BJ's brews!"
Kira V.,"Carmichael, CA",1,22,3,5.0,7/9/2017,Since my last review I can honestly say that BJ's has stepped up their game. My husband and I go almost weekly. 90% of the time we have a stellar experience that I am very happy with. The few occasions that we have had issues they were immediately addressed and corrected. Their food is consistently good and they stand by their quality. I love the environment fast service and of course the food!!!!
Val W.,"Mineral Point, WI",28,34,,2.0,6/9/2017,First time here. Went to the bar. Got drinks right away but then bartender tended to ignore us with no eye contact. Finally waved her down so I could order an appetizer. I got the crispy artichoke hearts. Yum were they good! Decent price for an appetizer. Would have gotten an higher star had I not had to wait and try and wave down the bartender. I think her name was Zoe.
Sarah B.,"Spokane, WA",1,46,25,2.0,10/18/2015,"Had lunch here today, it was decent. The parmesan crusted chicken wasn't quite as pictured, and the chicken itself was a little burnt, but it was delicious once I got over the burned bits. However, it did take an hour+ to get food for a mostly empty place. Asked the waiter to lower the shades and after he did so, he took the orders of tables that came after us, and we had to get up and flag him down to take our order finally (20+ minutes to lower the blinds and return to take our order??). Food came without silverware, which took asking two separate waiters to get. For dessert, we had the triple ghirardelli pizookie, which was great, aside a very iron-y metal taste, which was either the silverware or tin it was served in, and it did not complement the chocolate well. In addition: I stumbled across another reviewer's photo of the same parmesan crusted chicken dish. It is very clear this time around it was not at all cooked at its best. Where their photo has a beautifully golden texture, mine did not."
Kate B.,"Tallahassee, FL",223,175,294,3.0,2/17/2016,"Interior and atmosphere is nice, food is alright - 3 star rating it is.  What's Nice: Big restaurant, plenty of seating. You could host a large party here with no problem.  The dip to chip ratio is good! We usually have to ask for more chips to finish the spinach dip - which is pretty good.  Pizookie. The main reason we come here. The menu rotates, but you can't go wrong with the tried and true chocolate chip. The trio option is nice too ;)  What's Not: Menu is freakin' ENORMOUS. Unless you know what you're getting ahead of time, you can spend a good 20 flipping through.  Drinks don't have prices. Our waitress told us nothing is over $10, with the Long Island being the most expensive. Prices are alright, it's the lack of printing that's the problem. The basic margarita ($7-8) was alright, nothing special.  All in all - not incredible but a safe bet when you're not sure what you want. They have just about everything."
Eric O.,"Liberty Township, OH",3,221,4,5.0,8/19/2016,"Walked over from my hotel for dinner. Sat at the bar . I was told it is happy hour , half price appetizers and drink specials .  2 dollar bottle beer , I had a few , cold and tasted great .  I ordered the thin crisp pizza.  Excellent , it comes in a large oval shape . I will return when I am in town ."
Charles L.,"Las Cruces, NM",5,6,,1.0,5/19/2017,"So overpriced. Ordered a burger for like 8 or 9 dollars. They asked me how I wanted it prepared, which was a joke because they only prepare them one way: a tiny charcoal patty no larger than a McDonald's hamburger patty (which costs $1). I guess if you're on an all-bread diet, the gigantic bun might satisfy. Oh and this doesn't reflect some one-off bad experience, because I made the mistake of forgetting how awful it is and I went back with family only to be disappointed all over again."
Leslie W.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,5,,5.0,2/26/2017,Great service and good food. Thank you Kristie and Aurora for being so attentive and going above and beyond! Came with a large party and we will definitely return!
Erik O.,"Tallahassee, FL",2,10,15,4.0,6/9/2017,One of the consistently good places in Tallahassee to eat when all other places are usually so dismal and plain awful.  The only issues we have ever had was the servers were not exactly sure about the mixed beers or drinks.  Other than that it's a wonderful place.  The management is pretty damn awesome as well.
Daniel P.,"Tallahassee, FL",254,714,4083,5.0,3/7/2015,"Yes!  We had a GREAT dining experience at BJ's tonight.  (Note that we've enjoyed all of our previous experiences except for one consistent hiccup that we experienced each time - see prior review. We were a 7-top, seated at what I learned was table 616 (center row on the left room (closest to Blairstone)) and Chelsea was our server.  Early on, she very courteously and attentively helped us through the menu selections and was pleasant and cheerful throughout.  (A very busy night with a seemingly constant door-wait for parties of all sizes). We placed our order - one very similar to those of the past (salads, soups, apps, entrees) and in short order - we had everything delivered. Truly a five-star experience.  BJ's deserved it all along for every area other than plate delivery (which I chalked up to an order entry process) and tonight, the stars aligned.   Way to go Chelsea!  Way to go BJ's!"
Isaac B.,"Tallahassee, FL",15,53,96,1.0,1/1/2017,"There was no hostess after a few minutes of waiting at the entrance. Then, a waiter brought menus to the hostess station where we were standing, but didn't address us. We took this as an indication of how service would be if we waited any longer, and left."
Kenzie F.,"Tallahassee, FL",218,42,35,3.0,12/18/2016,"Pretty sad experience last night. Ordered a burger. The fries were solid ice cold upon arrival. Also, my four friends and I were shoved in the very back, back corner with the rotating table top! (Hint: it's not suppose to rotate) The table top wobbled and you can literally spin it. Water spilled, our drinks sloshed, you couldn't rest anything on the table without disturbing others. BJ's - you're a corporate restaurant with overpriced food. Fix your damn table! The waitress was kind, but had no idea that you all don't serve Moscow Mules until after I ordered one. Then I ordered a beer and she came back to tell me y'all were out of that one too. Ugh. Also, took almost half the meal for the waitress to even come check on us after getting our food. We needed water and condiments and had to ask random passerby waiters for help.... wasn't that great of a night."
LaQuata W.,"Spearfish, SD",56,100,408,5.0,11/7/2015,"Just made our first trip here and we really enjoyed it! Upon walking into the restaurant I immediately noticed all the seating. There is definitely ample seating, especially for big groups. It was very clean and spacious. Our waitress was Krista, who was very pleasant and welcoming. The menu is huge people!! There was so much on there that I kept going back and forth on entrees, so they have a little something for everyone. I finally settled on the cream soda, calamari for an appetizer and lightly fried mahi mahi tacos for my entree. The cream soda was very tasty! The calamari was absolutely delicious! I've always had rubbery, hard to chew calamari but this absolutely melted in my mouth. The mahi mahi tacos were just as  yummy.  My son had the root beer float, which he loved so much that he decided to get another one and he didn't leave a drop in either cup! His appetizer was the mozzarella sticks and his entree was the root beer glazed wings. Yes, he was in a root beer mood today:-)  He loved all his food and even had enough leftovers to bring home. We were stuffed so decided to bring dessert home of the pizookie trio with white chocolate macadamia nut, salted caramel and triple chocolate. Those were very good also! Service was great. Food was delicious. We will be returning to try more!"
E B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,16,1,1.0,7/30/2017,"Not impressed at all by their food, which seems to be pre-made, highly processed food and artificially presented as fresh food. The sashimi, which you could mistake for a seared fish if you choose it based on the picture in the menu, seems to have come out of a package being already sliced and just placed on the plate.  Have tried BJ's a few times at the insistence of friends wanting to try it, but will avoid it from now on. If you like unprocessed food, this is not the place for you."
