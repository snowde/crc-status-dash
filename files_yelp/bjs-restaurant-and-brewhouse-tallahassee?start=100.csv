Angela B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,32,5,1.0,4/26/2016,"We waited about two hours for our food plus we had waiters and waitresses come to our table MULTIPLE times, asking us if the entree they had in hand was ours. Nobody knew what food belonged to whom. Additionally, I got soup and salad. The salad was great but the broccoli cheddar soup was probably the worst broc. cheddar soup I've ever had. It was mushy and had a nasty flavor. I love BJ's for their atmosphere but the service and food is AWFUL."
Elyse F.,"Tallahassee, FL",60,46,4,1.0,11/17/2013,"I am wondering where they make their ""craft beer"" I think it has a lot of similarities to Anheuser Busch, which is the antithesis of craft. I tried their amber Ale and didn't bother to finish it. They are also among  the most expensive in town for bottled beer. It was $6+ for Dos Equis, Heineken, Blue Moon, etc. The food was overpriced as well. My meal tasted like it came from frozen, prepackaged foods. My boyfriend had the brewhouse burger and said it tasted like ""the best steak and shake burger he'd ever had"" Only it was 3 times the price. The service was decent but I noticed that 3 tables around us had gotten up since we were seated and they stayed empty for over 10 minutes until after we left, even though there was still tons of people waiting outside to get a table.  The most shocking to me is that on the bottom of the wine menu it says they charge a $7 corkage fee after your first bottle of wine! I think it is just absurd for a chain restaurant to charge a corkage fee on their OWN WINE LIST."
Steven D.,"Palm City, FL",0,14,1,1.0,6/4/2015,Waitress didn't know that beers on tap were not listed on the menu.  Ordered the ribeye medium and it came out well.  Baked potato was not fully cooked. Not s good experience.
Lakshmi R.,"Minneapolis, MN",73,112,10,4.0,1/10/2014,Been there almost like 5 times.... Nice ambiance.... And Food is good enough... I liked the spiced pumpkins ale beer. I sliced of one star because of poor service. I know it's a new franchise so it may take a while to get up to mark....
Sherry S.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,23,,5.0,4/22/2016,"I am a return customer to BJ's for two reasons: tasty food and stellar service. I had one of my favorite dishes: Southern Fried Chicken. It is tender, crispy and juicy with white gravy. Very good ....... and the sides: mashed potatoes and corn ..... just right."
Erin C.,"Perry, FL",0,6,,2.0,4/17/2016,"Really not that great. I really like the atmosphere but the food was subpar. I had a salad and my husband had a burger. We both thought the food lacked flavor and didn't taste fresh. I know it's a chain, but still could use some improvement in the quality of their food."
R. Debrady F.,"Tallahassee, FL",6,29,38,4.0,3/30/2015,"Great food!!!  My wife and I dined here recently (my first time ever).  We endured a 30 minute wait, but it was worth it.  I chose the Parmesan crusted chicken breasts and my wife had grilled salmon.  My only complaint was the asparagus (cooked a tad too long).  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  We'll definitely return!"
Melinda T.,"San Mateo, CA",17,33,5,5.0,10/29/2013,"Really people? 3 stars? Let me start with the disclaimer that I would never give BJ's five star in Sacramento. BJ's is BJ's, wherever you go, some are better some are worst, but you know what to expect.  I have spent the last 4 weeks in Tallahassee, pretty much eating out every night. First I was very excited to try out what this town has to offer. Visited some of the highly rated restaurants on yelp. Maybe I had high expectations, but I left disappointed every time. I am sorry people of Tallahassee, but good old BJ's serve pretty good food comparing to many of the ""high end places"".  I suggest you try the Pork Chop, the Moroccan spiced salmon, the mahi mahi or the ahi salad. You won't be disappointed. Yes, the wait is long and service sucks most of the time, but if you sit at the bar you can cut the wait and get the bartender's attention whenever you need it. And no, I would never give BJ's 5 stars if I had a better restaurant experience in Tally."
Jodi U.,"Panacea, FL",0,4,1,4.0,4/3/2016,Food was inexpensive and very good. Would not recommend the broccoli cheddar soup but everything else was awesome. Server was great too!  Will be back.
Kenneth M.,"Campbellsville, KY",46,185,27,3.0,11/22/2013,It's good but pricey for a pizza
Alexander D.,"Tallahassee, FL",7,3,,4.0,1/22/2014,"A very nice, mellow, classy experience. Excellent craft beers, with a fairly large selection."
Steve M.,"Alpharetta, GA",43,12,,4.0,5/30/2015,We're visiting from out of town and had dinner. BJ's has a great beer selection and extensive many for any taste or budget. The service was friendly and it's a nicely appointed place. We're going back tonight!
G Q.,"Aurora, IL",55,132,,2.0,1/5/2015,VERY loud. Food was average at best. Service the same. No parking at this location.  I wouldnt go back
James B.,"Tallahassee, FL",33,1,,1.0,4/11/2015,"I dealt with some incredibly incompetent employees, I didn't even end up going because I didn't want to give them my business. I called them around noon to make a reservation for a party size of 7 and they told me I just had to call 30 minutes before I went to put my name on the list but when I called they said that parties of 7 or more had to make a reservation and the wait would be over an hour if I just showed up. It ruined our plans for the night."
John M.,"Bonifay, FL",0,36,,3.0,4/11/2015,"Nicely decorated, high-ceiling, comfortable dining area complete with big screen TV's on the walls.  Food quality is average for these types of dining establishments.  The pizza, however, is exceptional.  Hamburgers, on the other hand, are mediocre at best.  Service staff is attentive and courteous."
Paul K.,"Ladson, SC",0,6,,1.0,12/30/2014,"Our dining experience in this Restaurant was atrocious! Three of us placed  A drink an appetizer order, which came right away. Unfortunately, two of the drinks were wrong. The Waitperson was told, took our food order, and then disappeared for 15 minutes. Meanwhile our appetizers were placed on our table without any napkins or small plates. When the Waitperson returned we informed her about our drinks. She again, disappeared for at least 10 minutes, forcing one of our party, my Wife, to go to the bar and see if the drink order could be expedited. The Bartender treated my Wife with disrespect, giving her a snarky comment about ""Do you want me to MAKE the the Club Soda""? The Bartender's condescending attitude was extremely unprofessional! Meanwhile, after almost a half an hour, our meal had still not been delivered to our table. The Waitperson appeared to be overwhelmed by the number of Customers she was handling. She was polite and apologetic, but seemed incapable of getting our order and service coordinated in a manner sufficient to provide for a minimal dining experience! We asked to speak with the Manager. He nodded his head, as we told him of our ordeal at his Restaurant, and apologized for the problems we had incurred. He then told us there would be ""no Charge"" for our drinks and appetizers, and bid us good day. I feel this Restaurant is ""All show, and no go""! A fancy building, ""cool"" atmosphere and a wide an eclectic menu is all for naught if the service is terrible! Avoid this place!"
Todd C.,"Detroit, MI",0,19,29,3.0,3/17/2014,"This is a decent place to eat and drink. It is not inexpensive, but it has a nice atmosphere. Once I flagged one of the two bartenders down and got one to acknowledge my wife and I, the service was alright. The food was good. The beer is good."
Brandon G.,"Tallahassee, FL",3,5,1,5.0,1/3/2015,"The food is amazing.  My wife says the berri Sangria is better each time.  Also, the deep dish lasagna is fabulous too."
Roy M.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,7,,5.0,9/28/2015,I have been here several times now with my family. We have yet to be disappointed with the food or the service. The beer is outstanding! One of the few chain restaurants in town that my wife and I are willing to go back to again and again. Most of the big chain restaurants I feel I can cook better than. Really like the freshness that this restaurant has to offer. And if you are ever there ask for Don. He is probably the best server you will ever have a casual dining restaurant!
Jim W.,"Port St Lucie, FL",1,15,,5.0,12/1/2014,First time.  Was in town on business.  Had a lite lunch.  Their beer was great. Service was awesome.  I will definitely eat at BJ'S again.
