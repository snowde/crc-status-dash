Dan S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,13,,1.0,10/31/2015,Before you come here understand half the menu may not be available. The entrees that my wife and I ordered  they no longer have.  We specifically asked that all the food come out at the same time. It did not. The food took forever. I watched other people return their food as well. Unfortunately not a lot of late night choice in Tallahassee. But find somewhere else.
Kiki F.,"Tallahassee, FL",7,3,22,3.0,10/17/2013,The wait was short because we called ahead.  The service was good.  The food was good.  The famous poozookie I could do without.  The price were reasonable.
Burley L.,"Brooksville, FL",0,11,,2.0,4/15/2014,I will give only 2 stars one star for the brew and one star for service. Calamari was the worst ever. Very small portion brought out cold then returned burnt to a crisp. The French Dip not much better. They do have a nice selection of brews a friendly manager and servers.
Matt Y.,"Tampa, FL",0,22,,4.0,12/12/2014,"Good restaurant that is fun to go out to with friends and family. The food is good and the restaurant itself is nice. If you're a drinker, they've got plenty of options! My only two complaints are that service can be slow (they don't appear to have enough waiters at times) and there are very few healthy options (their ""healthy"" menu has an idem that was over 700 calories). Outside of that, this place is awesome!"
Rabiya J.,"Miami, FL",1,4,,2.0,10/22/2013,For my full review and pictures of my meal please go here: Overall.... Not the greatest I have been to. Honestly would avoid during lunch time. Would love to give it a shot again maybe in a couple of months once the restaurant and staff gets better trained.
Terena W.,"McDonough, GA",0,18,4,1.0,11/23/2015,"First let me say our waitress was super, she was the best part of our experience here. She was very attentive and courteous. We went on last Friday around 8pm, our wait was well over an hour, although there did not seem to be lots of people waiting ahead of us. The lady who brought our food pretty much dumped it down in front of us then disappeared, My husband had the deep dish pizza, he loved it. I on the other hand, had the fish and chips. My food was room temperate and the homemade tarter sauce was HORRIBLE. I've never tasted anything like it, I believe it was either old or was not kept at the appropriate temperature. I only took a few bites and I was done. Upon leaving the restaurant I became very very ill, and could barely make it to the Publix down street. I experienced this for most of the evening, losing all of the two bites I took of my dinner. I know that my dinner caused it because I had only eaten a salad and grapes the entire day before dining at BJs and I was fine all day prior to this. I believe one of the biggest issues is the size of the menu, it is too big. There is no way they are consistently keeping everything hot, cold, or fresh with a menu that size. I am still not feeling my best and this is 3 days later. We will NEVER eat here again."
S C.,"Tallahassee, FL",9,11,5,3.0,6/3/2014,"Slow service, mediocre food and a $50 bill for two people. The Santa Fe spring rolls were delicious and my house salad was good but my burger was flattened like it was squashed with a spatula and falling apart. My fried were saturated with grease too. It was overpriced and disappointing."
Cory H.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,23,3,5.0,4/24/2015,"I love this place! The food is amazing, but expensive. If you don't want to spend a lot of money but still want to eat here, go during the happy hour where the appetizers and pizzas are half price! I had the California flatbread, the supreme personal pizza, and the boneless wings; all very good! The service was very fast and our server was really polite. The choice of drinks is also very extensive, great place to go for birthdays and special occasions. I would definitely come back here!"
Art s.,"Tallahassee, FL",17,125,,2.0,11/4/2013,"Good food, very nice decor for the genre, but some of the worst service in Tallahassee and that's really saying something.    The first time we called them and asked about the wait.  They said it was not bad at all.  I asked if they had ""call ahead seating"".  They said they did so I told them I'd be there in about 15 minutes.  I was there in exactly 15 minutes and was told it would be at least a 30 minute wait, and that they don't offer call ahead seating unless you call at least 30 minutes prior.  It's not like I expect them to be respectful of my time or anything, but could you at least tell the people answering your phones to familiarize themselves with restaurant policy? The second time we went for lunch.  It was busy but we got in and pretty soon wished we hadn't.  The service was abysmal.  Every ten minutes or so someone would try to bring us some other table's order till eventually we got ours.  As this was happening our server was so busy grab-assing with her colleagues that she couldn't be bothered to re-fill our drinks even once.  That's inexcusable when you're charging $3 for a club soda. It took us about 15 minutes to get our waitress over and ask for the check.  Between our table and the service station she decided to chit-chat for awhile and check in on another table, then came back to us and realized she had forgotten to get our check.  She eventually brought it to us, and when we were reviewing it we noticed they charged us for a few things that we never ordered and never received.  It took another 15-20 minutes to get her back to the table.  She left to correct it, and came back about 15 minutes later (after much additional multitasking) to say that she needed to have the credit card again!  We finally told her to take the card, walk directly to the register, correct the f-ing ticket, and walk directly back.  If you're not doing the math, we were stuck there almost an additional hour after we were finished with our meal.  Needless to say, no math needed to calculate her tip. I realize it's a new restaurant, with new staff, but there is no substitute for giving a damn about your customers."
Beth Y.,"Lighthouse Point, FL",271,46,316,3.0,12/25/2013,A 3 star restaurant for sure. The food doesn't live up to the bright lights and high end appearance. The pleasant menu offered a large variety with a meal that was very much 3 stars. Not my first pick and yet... not something you should passover because of bad service reviews.
Johnny J.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,6,4,1.0,4/13/2015,"HATE to give this place a negative review BUT the service we had last night for my Birthday Dinner ( which they refused to even acknowledge.....awesome ) was HORRID. VERY incompetent waiter. Waited 30 minutes before someone even talked to us and they were not that busy. Server had NO IDEA about anything on any menu. Ordered everything at once as we feared waiter would take another 30 minutes to come back. After waiting almost an HOUR total so far, first out came all of our entrees, THEN our drinks, then our Apps all at the same time. We sent our entrees back as we did not want them cold. COMMON SENSE in the service industry SAYS Drinks, APPS, Entrees. Little scary that simple concept went way over the head of our waiter. The waiter was very awkward, making rude jokes about needing a drink. We could not eat as they had never even gave us silverware. WE HAD TO ASK A MANAGER FOR SILVERWARE. We wait another 30 mins for entrees, my girlfriends kale and Brussels sprout salad had NO Brussels sprouts or kale but we did not dare send it back. We  finish, order 1 more drink and wait nearly 20 mins for that before getting up to leave. We got the check, NOTHING COMPED NOTHING DISCOUNTED!  They said THE HELL to my Birthday ( i'll survive )WE LEFT EXTREMELY UNHAPPY. The food was GREAT, the service was BEYOND HORRIBLE...... GET IT TOGETHER OVER THERE. Would love to come back but WOULD NEVER sit somewhere other than the bar next time. What a shame. I have heard from many others who have had similar experiences due to lousy servers and management. Clear house and get some experienced employees before you lose valuable customers."
Arturo L.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,6,,4.0,1/31/2014,This place is really beautiful and I like the open atmosphere. The lighting was nice and every one of the employees was smiling. I ordered the shrimp pasta and it was really awesome. My friend got the balsamic chicken and that one met the mark as well. I was able to speak with a manager about an inconvenience I had and he handled it very professionally while at the same time extremely friendly and welcoming. One thing I would mention though is that my server was extremely bland and lethargic. She tried on multiple occasions to remove the check from my table while I was still in the middle of conversation. She seemed ready to leave or something. Other than that I had an excellent time.
Ann L.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,36,3,1.0,1/24/2015,"Very disappointed tonight.  Have always had good food. Ordered stuffed mushrooms and they came out slightly warm. I told the waitress who took them away and brought them back not much warmer than before.  The mushroom caps were cool to the touch and not appetizing at all. The waitress asked if they were better and I said no, they still weren't hot. She offered to replace them but after two cool ones I certainly didn't want six more. So I left four uneaten. She charged me for them and no manager inquired. Sad!"
Kamilla K.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,1,,4.0,1/21/2014,"The variaty of the menue is excellent and the prices are quite reasonable, too. I have been dining at BJ's for years (recently moved from Orlando) and I have yet to have a bad experience. They always have awesome drink specials, mostly on their own brews which are delicious. I will add that with this new location being in a college town, most of the staff is younger and a bit inexperienced, but give it a couple months and I am sure they will get the reputation they deserve. Try the Pizzokies, they are to die for! Nom nom nom."
Kate W.,"Benicia, CA",0,5,,2.0,1/27/2014,"Food, 5 stars. Attitude, 0. The fried chicken is great, and so is the jalapeno burger, and salads are pretty good too. But I've eaten here three times now, and from the front desk to the servers, at each visit they've seemed to think they were doing me a big favor to serve me. I've never seen a smile or gotten anything but a pro forma hello. On a recent mid-afternoon Saturday, when we were told there was a 20-minute wait, we asked about eating at the bar. The host said ""You're welcome to look for yourself. The bar seating is first-come, first-serve."" All he had to do was look over his shoulder at the bar and he could have seen there were seats available and invited us to enjoy a meal at the bar.  I lived in New York for a long time, and it's not pleasant to find New York attitude in Tallahassee. Despite the fried chicken, three strikes on the service and they're out. I'm taking my business elsewhere."
Jose S.,"Tallahassee, FL",3,39,4,2.0,3/11/2014,"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and BJ's is the perfect example of why. You can tell all the food is canned. Though I have never been to another BJ's you can probably bet it is the same lousy pizza, burger and food in general. For a college town their beer prices are very ""un-dude"" for what I would consider, typical microbrewed beer (several of my friends can brew way better beer in their garage). On the bright side the service was very friendly and pretty fast. If you are into restaurants like Friday's and Chili's BJ's will suite you. If you're into quality food look for a local joint."
Annie D.,"Tallahassee, FL",34,18,5,2.0,10/27/2013,"It's unfortunate that this place has awful service for such a generally good chain. Our server didn't show up for 15 minutes after we sat down, didn't wipe it down from the table before, and then walked away every time we asked a question. I mean, I expect at least a ""how are you?"". Is that too much to ask?"
Phillip W.,"Tallahassee, FL",2,47,2,2.0,10/31/2013,"Lousy service, noisy atmosphere.  Food was ok, but overpriced compared to similar restaurants in town.  Service staff knows not what they are doing, and it's hard to I enjoy a meal with family when you can't even have a conversation with them.  I even tried contacting BJs through their website but even that is broken.  Oh well, just like the government; poor service and a crappy product, with leadership that lies to you and expects you to just take it. Thanks, I probably won't be back."
Samantha M.,"Omaha, NE",0,6,,5.0,6/2/2014,The waitress was very nice. She definitely knew what to offer us. The home brewed beer was very good and a reasonable price. The mini deep dish pizzas were fantastic as well! I wi definitely return.
Dena G.,"Tallahassee, FL",4,90,3,3.0,12/12/2014,"We have eaten at BJs three times in the past three months.  I have tried their roast beef sandwich, their macaroni and cheese, and most recently, the chili and classic turkey sandwich combo.  We have also tried the fried artichoke appetizer.  Service has generally been good.  Wait staff are pleasant and appear to be well trained and fairly prompt for the most part.  The place can be noisy, and on one visit we almost lost our minds when a customer insisted on drumming her clogged foot on the laminate covered floors.  By the time I had identified the culprit, I was ready to stick a fork in her eye.  Fortunately, the arrival of her meal stopped the drumming.  On to our food.  The roast beef sandwich was very good the first time I tried it.  The bread was crisp and the meat was fresh.  The second time the meat did not taste fresh.  The thin fries are generally good, but my Guy usually eats those up.  The fried artichokes are all right, but a bit too tart for my taste, and needed something to mellow out the sharpness of the artichokes.  They would be better stuffed with goat cheese IMO.  The macaroni and cheese appetizer needs serious improvement.  It is too thin on the cheese sauce, and needs to be baked.  Additionally, it has way too many flavors going on in the dish that are competing for your taste buds.  Fail.  The last visit, I had the chili with a half turkey classic, no cheese.  This was good.  The chili was meaty with just the right amount of beans.  There are no peppers in the chili.  It does need something as it seemed to lack a certain depth of flavor, but it was still tasty and filling.  The turkey sandwich was good, though I will fault them on the shredded lettuce.  Tomatoes were fresh, and not too much mayo.  The turkey was good, though a bit salty.  The bread was a nice whole wheat.  We'll be back."
