Jack C.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,8,1,3.0,10/12/2013,"This location opened less than a week ago and it shows. Still training staff & learning extensive menu. Atmosphere was nice, tall ceilings & large screens TVs for sports fans, however food & prices not that great. The verdict is still out. I will try them again in a few weeks during game day."
Jim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,5,5.0,11/23/2014,"Great service and food, especially for a chain. Interior is well done, prices are great, and service was impressive. Beer selection is also very good and there are plenty of options for the beer lover."
Kurt H.,"Tallahassee, FL",69,47,6,1.0,5/22/2014,"Just ordered the southern fried chicken dinner for takeout. Thursday night at 10pm. Came to $14. It's supposed to come with two chicken breasts, but what I received was far different. Two chicken pieces about two inches long. Super dried out with about two bites of chicken each. The mashed potatoes were super bland and tasteless as well. For this price, I could get an 8 piece at KFC, and the chicken would be a hundred times better. What an utter disappointment and a ripoff at the same time."
Elyzabeth A.,"Tallahassee, FL",4,7,1,2.0,10/20/2013,"Beers were great.  Crafty seasonals were excellent.  Service was friendly, but the kitchen was terrible.  Food was very late, then a burger was well done when ordered rare.  Management was apologetic, but is still took a long time and came out medium the second time and with the wrong sides.  Ate because I was so hungry by then.  Menu is not complicated, I would recommend waiting till they work out the kinks.  Maybe avoid the food and just go for the bar."
Corey F.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,2,,3.0,7/12/2014,This is our 1st time at this restaurant.  We ordered a calamari as an appetizer. We were not impressed. The food was not seasoned well.  The jalapeño burger was good though.  The service was great.  So overall average restaurant.
Nicole A.,"Tallahassee, FL",2,134,1,3.0,10/30/2013,"Generally I love this place (I'm from CA so been to a few locations there), food is good and consistent, and they have good beers. This location is still on the rocks though. There is always a wait, which is understandable since they just opened...but they are still seeming to work out a lot of kinks because food is late, things are disorganized, etc. Hopefully it gets better because it's a good place to eat and just have a casual hang out with friends! I like the pizza and sandwiches (turkey club is delicious), and of course pizookies."
Janice T.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,8,6,1.0,12/6/2013,"We visited the Tallahassee location several times, and this place has the worst service that I've ever seen. We gave them a couple of chances because they were new, but they have not improved. They have, in fact, gotten worse. The last time that we were there (and I do mean the LAST time) we sat for 25 minutes waiting for a table, although several empty tables were within view and there was only one couple ahead of us (we asked). We were finally seated , only to have to sit for 30 minutes with servers walking back and fourth by us and no one waiting on us. We got up and left. I don't care what the food is like, I will not patronize a place with such crappy service. And there are plenty of places in town with better food."
She J.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/13/2014,"What a terrible night out. The food was TERRIBLE. Not only was there no flavor on any bite of my main meal, but the chicken was so raw I felt sick after eating it. The chicken was so raw it was extremely pink and wet. Once I gave it back they reheated it but it was still raw! Pieces of cartilage also scattered throughout chicken. Then the waiter told me an absolutely wrong price for a drink (said it was $2 but was $8!) and manager wouldn't apologize or allow me to pay $2 since I ""drank it""... but manager, I wouldn't have had it if it was $8... In addition, it was an ""alcoholic"" drink but the alcohol was so little I couldn't taste anything but sugary syrup. Waiter never came to refill drinks or anything, and never came to collect my bill. The place looks fantastic from the outside but what a piece of crap on the inside. Just spend your money somewhere else."
