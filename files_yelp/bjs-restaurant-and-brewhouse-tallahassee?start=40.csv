Tony J.,"Bergen County, NJ",3190,446,3667,3.0,10/20/2015,"This was my second time here because I like the proximity of this restaurant to my nearby Hilton Inn, which is within easy walking distance. I was here again on business with my associate. Tonight I started with a pint of their Tatonka stout for $5.25. I also enjoyed their full rack of barbeque ribs for $21.95 which was more than filling so I could not finish all of my ribs. It was truly gut busting. I ended my dinner with a pint of their red draft for $4.95. Damien H. did a good job of taking care of both of us. My share of the dinner was $35. I will probably return here because of the convenient location."
Vishal P.,"Tallahassee, FL",146,139,170,5.0,9/26/2015,Just ordered root beer ribs.  The ribs were freaking fall off bones and best sauce hands down.  Coming here for ribs till this special is gone.  Cheers!
Gordon C.,"Tallahassee, FL",716,184,319,5.0,10/19/2015,Love the beer selections. Everytime i go here i am waited on by either Taylor or Lindsey and they are both fantastic at there jobs. I love the flatbreads here. I believe thursday has half off appetizers at the bar! An interesting thing about bj's is that they make there own beers however it is not brewed locally or on location.
Tim K.,"Tallahassee, FL",214,323,223,4.0,5/10/2016,"After our movie ended late, there were very few places still open that we could expect to serve decent food. BJ's thankfully was one of those. The service and food were both good, having had the brisket and bacon burger, as well as the baked ziti. The size of the restaurant also made it so that you didn't have to wait around for seating to open up. I would highly recommend BJ's, especially if the evening got away from you and you need some good food past 9pm."
Keith R.,"Rex, GA",0,8,,2.0,6/28/2017,"I've eaten at this BJ's a couple of times when I'm in Tallahassee...as a matter of fact, I've eaten at BJ's in Vegas, California and Louisiana. The only reason that I'm giving them 2-stars is because of the beer, otherwise they would get only 1-star. The quality of this restaurant is below the quality of others that I've been too. My first mistake was ordering a steak at a brew pub. I ordered the ribeye medium...it came out well done. My waitress took it back and placed an order for a new one. The manager brought that one and said that it was perfectly cooked. How does half of the steak turn out to be medium and the other half was rare. Besides the steak being unevenly cooked, it was fatty and not a choice cut. I'll probably refrain from eating at this BJ's again or just stick to eating a burger."
Tiffany R.,"Loganville, GA",0,4,8,5.0,3/20/2017,Had the calamari which was amazing and the shrimp tacos on pita and they were sooo good. My Fianceè had the wings and fries. Everything was really good which was surprising because they have so much on the menu. Service was quick and great.  I will definitely be going back to try the flatbread.
Jamile F.,"Tallahassee, FL",58,6,,4.0,3/10/2017,"I love this place. Good food, affordable, great service!"
Eric H.,"Crawfordville, FL",0,20,2,1.0,12/3/2016,"This had to been the worse visit we've had here. It's apparent the management is sub-par. Thirty minutes after placing our order the food arrived cold, not cooked to order and tough.  The tables around us were left with dirty dishes, sitting untouched during our entire 45min visit. The level of service and quality of food is has never been good here, but today's visit was the worse."
Shuang F.,"Tallahassee, FL",73,18,100,3.0,6/10/2016,"I visited here twice. The first time I ordered salmon, and this time was turkey burger. They were both well cooked and nicely displayed. Their menu has plenty of choices. And they also has a bar, but the screens are not large enough(not like those in real sports bar). Good customer service."
Tony T.,"Yulee, FL",0,12,23,5.0,1/28/2016,"Christmas shopping night out for the family!!! Stopped by for the Awesome Rootbeer for the kids and a Big Boy Beer for dad... The waitress (Yazzie)suggested Tatonka Beer and it was a hit!!! Dark Draft... Soup, salad, pizza, relaxed atmosphere, good music, and my wife loves this place... Great Job BJ's and Merry Christmas!!! Visited 12-21-2015 at 7pm...."
Helen L.,"Tampa, FL",327,453,2093,3.0,9/25/2014,"Service at the take out desk was great. The server was friendly, attentive, and cheery.  I had ordered the top sirloin with a side of brussels sprouts and steamed broccoli. The sirloin was good, however, the spice around it was a little overpowering. The meat itself was tender. The brussels sprouts did not look green anymore and looked a bit overcooked. Otherwise the steamed broccoli was great. I ordered a side of fried artichokes with  lemon garlic aioli sauce. The sauce was tasty and the artichokes weren't bad. The bruschetta was my favorite. Instead of the topping being on a crostini, it was on top of a tasty bread. The side of pesto sauce was tasty as well."
Nic K.,"Fountain, FL",2,8,,4.0,5/14/2016,"Salmon dish, Fat Tire, Bar.  Great food, and atmosphere.  Price is typical of family restaurant.   Does not do UFC."
Ray H.,"Caryville, FL",0,22,1,4.0,12/15/2016,"Good service, food and drinks- both regular root beer(house made) or real beer etc. it's a chain but worth a visit"
A G.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,1,,5.0,5/14/2017,"Regulars here. Always great service and quality food. Specifically great management, tonight my girlfriend lost her ring in the sink bathroom and the manager gladly dug around the sink to retrieve it. They went above and beyond and we really appreciated it. Kudos"
William B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,17,,2.0,1/13/2017,"Reservations must be placed 24 hours in advance.   I don't see why that is a requirement since I never plan where to have a casual dinner until that day.   I was asking 6 hours ahead of when I wanted to dine.    It just pissed me off.   So, now I'll show up very early to get on a waiting list.    I'll probably avoid this place in the future."
Christin Y.,"Memphis, TN",2,187,164,4.0,11/17/2014,"Stopped in for lunch on our way out of town and sat at the bar. The bartender may have been one of the friendliest and most upbeat I have met. I went with half of the veggie flatbread (awesome!) and Caesar salad. Everything was great. Beers were cold (I liked the IPA), and staff was attentive. A+ casual lunch experience!"
Andy M.,"Huntsville, AL",51,392,1579,4.0,1/10/2015,"Reservations not required, but recommended.  We came about 5:15 pm on a Saturday, and the wait time for a table was already 20 minutes.  We watched the wait line continue to grow longer behind us, as the restaurant was full.   We then had to wait a little while for our service and food, because they were so busy.  We were OK with that, as we weren't in a hurry.  Their staff was hustling.  We left happy.    As visitors, we then found it a little confusing getting back to Apalachee Pkwy from the restaurant.  You might want to bring your trusty GPS."
Jaye J.,"Montgomery, AL",0,1,,2.0,3/4/2017,"Don't bother using the dine-in order ahead option--- they completely are unaware that's it's advertised on their website.  It's a pretty normal Saturday night but they couldn't handle it.  Poor service-- no silverware provided until we asked.  Manager didn't seem concerned at.   Although they took care of the bill, just poor service overall. The food is consistent with other BJ's-- very good and fresh!"
Jean L.,"Tallahassee, FL",131,53,57,5.0,8/4/2015,"This is one of my favorite places to eat here in Tallahassee. The restaurant is fairly new but every time I've eaten here it's always been a great experience. My favorite dish form here is the jambalaya. Everyone tells me to try their pizza, I just haven't had a chance to. Oddly enough BJ's is known for their in house beers l but not one person has recommend for me to try it. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing."
Mike M.,"Orlando, FL",183,115,178,4.0,8/2/2014,First time at a BJ's and I have ro say I am quite impressed.   I started out with their handcrafted brew called BJ's Jeremiah Red. Nice smooth beer. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it was phenomenal. It seemed to have a hint of lemon which I love.  One downside was the amount of broccoli they gave.  There was only 4 florets!   The mashed potatoes were very good tasting but were a bit lukewarm.  I definitely recommend the place though. Atmosphere was great and food was very good.
