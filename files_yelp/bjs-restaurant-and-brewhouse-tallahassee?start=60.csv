Mary M.,"Tallahassee, FL",4,5,,5.0,1/10/2016,"I've never had a bad experience here. Both the food and the service are great. The other day I had the new Deep Dish Ziti and it was wonderful! I like their pizza, too. I really like the selection of beers and ciders - I can try new and different ones.  And the club for regulars has great rewards, free meals and lots of coupons. There is lots of room inside; even when it looks crowded, there are usually still places to sit."
Meghan D.,"Crawfordville, FL",7,31,23,2.0,3/8/2015,"We have eaten at BJs three times total since it opened in Tallahassee. The first two experiences for dinner were good - decent service, good food, great drinks - but nothing to write home about. The last time we came was for lunch. We ordered mahi tacos and a club sandwich - nothing too extraordinary. After our waitress ignored us for 25 minutes (no refills, no table touch), the food was unceremoniously dumped on our table by a food runner who did not stop to say a word or ask us if we needed anything else. The food seemed to have sat under the lamps for awhile as the cheese on my club was congealed, the fish on my husband's tacos was cold, and the fries were limp and greasy. Our baby was getting super-fussy, so we called a manager over to tell him we would be leaving and not eating, as we did not have time to wait another 25 minutes for a new order.  The manager seemed nice and offered us a giftcard for our trouble - when I called to check the balance the next day (we thought we would give them another go as we have had decent experiences there before) = the card was empty. $0. Just as well. I will not be returning"
Bill S.,"Delray Beach, FL",488,808,638,4.0,7/13/2014,"I visited this restaurant with my family when we were visiting my daughter at FSU. We had a great time here and the drinks were good, the food was good, the desert was good, and they serve special Gluten Free meals such as pizza and pasta. I had the ribs and they were excellent, the chicken sandwich was excellent, and the cookie in a brownie dish was great. I love the ambiance and the multitude of large televisions on all the walls."
SabrahandHailey G.,"Tallahassee, FL",3,6,,4.0,5/15/2015,"Pretty good food. I mean not my favorite but pretty damn good. Nice bar - HUGE bar. I'd say you can get anything and everything at that bar. Service is alright. a little delayed due to the HUGE space and immense amount of customers it accommodates.  Which brings me to another thing: Noise. NOt gonna lie, it's pretty noisy. but understandbly so. And not so much that it's a huge inconvenience on your convo.  It's a fancy place, very nice for a corporate restaurant. But i also feel like you could really get crazy if you felt like it. Awesome.   Anyway, nice.  I feel like it's one of the only classy place in Tallahassee. LOTS of beverage choices.  But a lil bit of a wait. Keep it classy tallassee,!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Linda M.,"Orlando, FL",10,42,12,5.0,12/23/2015,"The excellence of the food, drink and service continue to impress me. Frequent happy hours for food & drink make it a great value."
Katelyn A.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,6,,1.0,10/25/2015,"If I could give my experience last night zero stars I would. To preface this I have been a server and worked on very busy nights but for a restaurant, that constantly has a line out the door, they should have handled themselves better.  Besides our drinks taking a half hour to get to us and our meals taking an hour (with my birthday dessert arriving before everyone's meal), the food ended up being cold and the waitress even colder. We got no apology from her and no attention at all.  We asked for the manager and told our waitress we knew it wasn't her fault we just wanted to comment on how cold the food was and she met us with attitude back. The manager never came to our table, we had to go find him an hour later. And he also had no apology to offer.  I was appalled and we will never be spending any more time at BJs. My birthday dinner was ruined by rude service and even worse management."
Kevin L.,"Tallahassee, FL",2,12,2,4.0,2/6/2015,"Been here at least a dozen times since they opened in fall of '13. Place is always packed with happy people. Solid, rib sticking food, good dependable beer when you stick to their own house beers and great happy hour specials.  Everything from pizzas to hamburgers to wraps to salads to tacos can be found on their multiple page, book of a menu. Prices range from about $8.95 to $16.95 Best deals can be found at happy hour from 5:00 (I think) until 7:00 (I know) when awesome, tasty appetizers are half price and house beers are a dollar off. Waitresses are always friendly, efficient and attentive. A great place to start an evening off."
Coral S.,"Tallahassee, FL",55,101,964,5.0,12/1/2013,"The reviews are all over the place.  We went during the FSU Florida game, Extremely top notch service, great food.  A bit loud each time FSU scored ;-).   I must say I wasn't sure I would ever step foot in this new chain restaurant, but it happened & boy am I pleasantly surprised.  Friendly, attentive staff, and food prepared well.  We had a burger, Fish 'n' Chips (Brit approved), Hawaiian mahi mahi and kids meal sliders (2).  This isn't Applebee's, you might wanna stop in and see.  They have a very diverse menu, good for undecided crowds."
Josiah S.,"Tallahassee, FL",14,13,25,4.0,6/7/2015,"I come to BJ's quite rarely, but when I do the food is wonderful and our waiter or waitress is always great at serving us. I got the Black and Bleu-house burger this time around. It's not the BEST burger I've had but they gave it a great amount of chipotle seasoning! Not too much, not too little. And the blue cheese was a killer topping for this burger! I suggest you get lettuce on it though, makes the burger even better in my opinion. When you get a burger and are the rare to medium well kinda of person, they'll have the cooking spot on every time. I'm never unsatisfied with how cooked my burger turns out to be and i get it medium."
Elizabeth B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",187,744,192,4.0,1/25/2014,"When friends suggested dining at BJ's this week, my husband and I were a tad wary after seeing so many negative reviews on Yelp. However, I was delightfully surprised by my overall experience! Of course, the first impression is what an establishment looks like. The restaurant is beautifully and tastefully decorated with quality pieces and a high-end finish. I was particularly impressed by the bathroom's appearance and cleanliness. It's the sort of place you could bring business clients, a date, or a family with a couple small children, and everyone would be happy.  Our waiter was very nice and polite. With kids in the group (2 kids under the age of 2), you quickly notice how long it takes for food to arrive, and everything came out very promptly.  Last but not least... The food! My side Caesar salad was simple but tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my deep dish Great White pizza. It essentially tasted like doughy breadsticks had a baby with chicken fettuccine alfredo. I ordered the small and was full after eating 3 of the 6 slices. I shared a slice or two with the rest of the table, and everyone thought it was really good, too. Though I didn't personally order a beer, all of the other adults at the table did, and everyone was impressed by the beer selection."
Michael M.,"Jacksonville, FL",13,10,8,4.0,7/10/2015,Had the chicken quinoa bowl and it was excellent. Wife had the Santa Fe salad and said it was good. Daughter-in-law had mahi mahi tacos and said it was also good.    Service also good.
Diane H.,"Valrico, FL",14,18,25,4.0,1/3/2016,"Loved the Deep Dish Pizza, best I have ever had. Spaghetti was great, had a nice spicy kick to it. Tried the Calamari, was terrible, would skip."
Dean L.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,20,1,1.0,8/22/2015,"Pros; excellent mixed drinks, great microbrewery, & friendly service. Cons; make sure you eat before you go there. Food is horrific & void of any flavor. If you arrive with an appetite be prepared to wait well over an hour for your food to be served which is bereft of flavor. Despite instructing the wait staff to deliver certain dishes with dinner, they'll deliver well in advance & after rejecting it will bring it back 5 minutes later. God Awful dining experience. Woke up famished!"
Rick L.,"Charlotte, NC",23,71,22,3.0,4/15/2015,"I really like this chain.  The concept is solid.  Every time we visit Tally, we end up here.  I think it's because of the vast selection of menu items. I've been here several times and my review should tell all. I haven't fallen for their own brews; but that is just my pallet.  The food is better than average and slightly imaginative but execution can be hit or miss. Like my steak on this past visit: the menu makes it sound good--a bone in aged NY strip.  But they don't tell you it was very over seasoned with coarse salt and spices that I had to scrape it off.  I asked for medium rare and definitely got cool inside. I did not want fries or the other sides they offered so I asked for a side of pasta that is offered as an entree.  I had to be upcharged $5.25 for 4oz of angel hair pasta with sundries tomatoes and veggies.  The fries cost more. So if you are looking for a a little bit better than average micro pub with a selection of food that should please all pallets, this is your place.  Just don't expect perfection."
Terri K.,"East Sparta, OH",1,13,,1.0,3/9/2016,Service was poor.  Broccoli cheddar soup was awful(gooey!).  Beer was the only positive from this meal.
Selmy B.,"Sarasota, FL",37,333,357,3.0,12/30/2013,"Select food then pair beers to meal! This is a beer junkie's spot to come with family or friends. The wait time can be extensive but it seems like everywhere in Tally that is the case. The pizzas are tasty and the burgers especially the BJ Brewhouse burger is excellent. I prefer the appetizer selections of shareables and small plates. Tasty, filling, and perfect for socializing. Tables can accommodate large groups which makes it a good spot to celebrate special events. In an effort to push/sell their own beers, wait staff are only educated on the brewhouse beers. You are left to learn on your own the large Belgium bottled beers.  Staff work in teams so it rather easy to get someone to help you get that extra napkins your server forgot to bring. Large menu makes for everyone to find something to eat. This is not the spot to go if you want healthy eats. Other than 4 salad options, I really did not see anything for the heatlthier meal."
Melissa M.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,1,,4.0,3/14/2016,"I was here for the first time around March 1st with my fiance, we had a good experience all in all. I ordered a jelepeno margarita and my fiance ordered a drink that we had somewhere else and they both were good. Our server or waiter I believe his name was Damien,not sure though was very witty and very sure of himself. The food was good as well. The only down side I have to say is that the rest rooms are not very well lit,not me but that may bother those women who maybe need to touch there make-up just saying."
Jeff G.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,97,19,1.0,10/14/2015,3rd and last meal here.  Food is still bland and service continues to forget parts of meals.  When you forget 3 different things for one family's order you lose our business and earn one star.
John T.,"Marietta, GA",47,5,1,2.0,2/6/2016,"At a table for 6, none of our table silverware had been washed...at all. It was wrapped in a nice black napkin as if it had, but obviously had not. I mean it looked like they hadn't even ben rinsed. Everyones food turned out to be very good, but it a made us doubt the cleanliness of the dishes it came on. The manager actually brought us new clean silverware that he put together himself, but it's hard to make up for something like this."
Emma H.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,14,,5.0,3/5/2016,"If you want awesome, consistently good food you have found the right place! The drinks are always amazing too. The menu is second in line to cheesecake factory so you will be able to find something here you like."
