Marquett S.,"Melbourne, FL",0,7,,2.0,9/2/2016,"My husband and I went to  this establishment yesterday. The two stars is for the berry cider only, as our food was rather tasteless and bland. The interior design of the establishment is very nice, staff was pleasant, but food wasn't that great. We ordered an appetizer of spinach dip and had to request some garlic to give it a boost in flavor. Also ordered the avocado egg rolls (not bad, not delicious either.. Mediocre at best), a California flatbread (gross, and not because I'm not a fan of ingredients), and my husband had the pulled pork sandwich which he voted as bland as well. Come here for quickness and mediocrity, not savory and delicious."
Aleisa M.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,3,,4.0,3/22/2016,"Ample seating, extensive menu, and a great restaurant app. The half rack of ribs was HUGE! I can't imagine what the whole rackc looks like - order it to feed a crowd, I guess. They were good, too, as was the wedge salad and the baby pizookie. The hours of operation are great - occasionally, I wait too long for most restaurants, but if I do, BJ's is open. I love BJ's!"
Kristen A.,"Orlando, FL",194,5,,5.0,6/9/2016,"Let me start off by saying I frequent many BJ restaurants due to my travel work. Sharon, the bartender, is one of the best in this business. She remembered me from months prior and went above and beyond to welcome me back. This establishment should be super grateful to have such an amazing person working for them! Sharon made the experience!"
Tony K.,"Miami Beach, FL",40,3,,1.0,7/31/2014,Terrible service we were here for over three hours and food and service were awful.  Long wait Bad service Management unresponsive to issues in restaurant  Clueless staff Bland food We're charged for all of their mistakes  Management made promises it could not keep Waited longer than any other service I would not go here for any reason in the world.
Jennifer I.,"Tallahassee, FL",107,648,62,2.0,6/1/2014,"First, let me start off by saying that I would give the service at this restaurant 5 stars. Our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and very patient with our table (we had some people who needed extra time to decide on a dish). Also, the restaurant manager came by and asked us about the quality of our meal and offered to fix anything that wasn't good.  The food, however, is another story. We all ordered the house sirloin steak, with various side dishes. The side dishes were fine (mashed potatoes were good, the baked potato was....well, a baked potato, it's hard to screw that up, and the vegetables were good). The steaks, on the other hand, were not well cooked. I ordered my steak medium-rare, and it came out well-done. My friend ordered hers medium, and it came out as a hockey puck. When the manager offered to replace her hockey puck with a properly cooked steak, the steak that was brought out was rare. It was as if they were so afraid to over-cook it that they didn't cook it at all.  Overall, I liked the beer and the atmosphere, so I'd be willing to give it another try, but I definitely won't recommend the steaks to anyone I know. The manager tried to make it right, and that's the sign of a manager that cares, and a restaurant that has the potential to succeed in the future after all of the kinks are worked out."
Bex D.,"Tampa, FL",10,40,86,3.0,1/6/2015,"Service was a little slow but my server had a great easy going personality.. Enough so we didn't mind the slow service or him messing up our drink orders. Wings were ok, dip was great."
Trevor R.,"Tallahassee, FL",3,2,,1.0,1/6/2016,"My coworkers and I just had the worst delays here.  As State workers, we don't have 1.5 hours to wait to order, get food, billed, etc.  Their whole process is jacked and slow.  Too bad cuz the food is great, but we won't be coming back and we used to be frequent flyers.  Even the Manager went to get us something from the kitchen to go as we were leaving and obviously immediately dropped the ball and was never to be seen again...as we waited standing for another 10 mins and the waitress finally helped.  SHAMEFUL"
T Y.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,6,,3.0,2/27/2015,"I have been to this restaurant a handful of times, and my experiences have varied greatly. I don't know why, but whenever I come here with just my husband, we have the worst service imaginable: waiters forgetting orders, ignoring our table or bringing incorrect drinks. However, when I've visited with a group of people, the experience is pretty good. At first I thought my husband was a bad luck charm, but he's joined in the group and we've all had a good time. I think the service is just really hit or miss here. As far as the food goes, it's OK considering the price. The main appeal is the wide variety of beer, which, as a non-beer drinker, doesn't really do much for me.  Also, their restaurant app constantly has problems, and is virtually useless."
Carla M.,"Midland, GA",34,140,114,2.0,5/8/2015,"Let's start off by saying that my group and I (10 people total) were VERY upset at the fact that a reservation had been made since Wednesday morning for Friday evening and when we showed up, they couldn't find our reservation.  On top of that, we had to wait an hour to be seated and in the meantime more customers are coming in and being seated before us. When we finally got seated,  thankfully we got a GREAT waiter and Damian is the reason for the two stars (he did great). The food wasn't that great, I've had better food at cheaper and better establishments. This place deserves ZERO stars but Damian's customer service deserves five stars."
Stephen M.,"Midlothian, VA",0,2,,1.0,6/24/2016,"So apparently people can call ahead and as they show up, they're bumped to the top of the list. This continually causes you to move down the list making the wait longer. After watching multiple similarly sized groups show up, receive a pager, and get called way ahead of us, we had enough. Never been here before...won't come back."
Cecil S.,"Tallahassee, FL",129,50,249,4.0,8/28/2014,"Great atmosphere, great house beer, well trained courteous staff, cant beat half price appetizers during happy hour. Don't forget to try their in house root beer with free refills, it is so good. My favorite beer in Tallahassee is their Harvest Hefeweizen paired with sliders or deep dish pizza, my second favorite is the Jeremiah Red paired with sliders or Traditional Wings. The other appetizers I have tried and like are, Crispy Calamari (I like mine kind of well done, just ask no prob), Crisp Potato Skins are great also. Bring your kids, bring your wife, bring your girl friend, bring your boy friend, heck bring your granny (or somebody else's granny), she could probably use a cold one. Love me some Bj's."
Todd C.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,16,17,2.0,12/24/2015,"I just had another crappy meal at BJ's. I ordered the baby back ribs. They were burnt on the outside, with bristles from the bbq brush on top.  The beer, Hoppy Scotsman, was good this time. One time At BJ's, there was something rubbery and round, like the shape of the tap floating in the foam of my beer. It was like an old beer bacteria colony floating.  I am done with BJ's.....in front of Dick's sporting goods. nice building, crappy food"
Rob M.,"Bowie, MD",16,49,,5.0,7/23/2014,You really can't beat the happy hour prices. I look forward to coming here when I visit Tallahassee. Bartenders are very friendly and the food is pretty good. The drinks are pretty strong and cheap during happy hour. Non-happy hour are about average  I would Rate this well above a Fridays style restaurant.
Nastaren A.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,10,,2.0,11/6/2015,"Ordered food for pick up. Got the parmesan crusted chicken and chicken Alfredo. In both the chicken was not as pictured.  My fettuccini was incredibly undercooked. We also got the fried calamari as the free appetizer, not happy with it. Mozzarella sticks were good."
Will B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",135,122,61,4.0,2/13/2014,"Whenever I try a new restaurant I like to browse some of their reviews and see what people are saying about their establishment. This place had some not so nice reviews that made me wonder if I we should even bother.  I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I think the restaurant had a rough opening and reaped several bad reviews because of it. I think since then they have settled down and are now putting out good food and good service.  I had a burger which was very good. There wasn't a whole lot to say about it but it was good. My wife had some  kind of deep dish pizza which was also very good. They seem to specialize in pizza so that's probably a safe bet if you want to ensure that you get something good. Being a brew pub they have their own brews which were decent. A few of the special selections were a little better than the typical offerings but over all pretty good.  The one thing that really bothered me about this place was the menu. It was huge. It's about the size of the cheese cake factory's menu, which is way too big in my opinion. Cheese Cake Factory doesn't, in my opinion, deliver on all their menu items and I can't imagine this place does either. I know this place is a chain and they need to stay consistent, but you can't possible do, pizza, burgers, fish, pasta, BBQ and do them all well.  Overall I like this place. I would stick to the portion of the menu that they can deliver and their beer and you'll have a good time."
Izzy R.,"Satellite Beach, FL",0,2,2,5.0,8/17/2015,They have the best deep-dish pepperoni pizza I've ever had! Love the atmosphere and service. It's sooo cold though so bring a jacket
Fat G.,"Tallahassee, FL",8,75,,1.0,1/21/2014,"WOW! Having eaten a few times at BJ's in Gainesville, we watched with growing anticipation as the BJ's in Tally was abuilding.  Finally it opened, but we decided to let the store get its legs under it and iron out those ever present opening glitches. So last weekend off we went. We'd always had pizza and been okay with that, so we decided we needed to spread our wings and try something different. And before I get mail, I realize a burger and a chix sandwich aren't THAT different, I only meant for our BJ's visit. My partner opted for the """"NEW"" Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich; I opted for the Crispy Jalapeno Burger. That Parm crusted chicken arrived showily 'chef-sliced', that heavily angled cut apparently for drama. What me partner ended up with was a clearly cooked from frozen chix patty all on one half of the bread. Yes, one-half was completely devoid of the proffered protein. Small portion of chicken? Too much bread? I don;t care - but the bread and chicken ratio was way off. But that left one-half with chicken. How was that? Well, the way it was prepped and cut left the ingredients to fall out. Hmmm...too much mayo lube or the creamy garlic sauce? Well, that left it a knife and fork sandwich, and a pretty poor one at that.  But there's that Crispy Jalapeno Burger. Sounds absolutely wonderfully tasty to me. Presented with a small portion of friend jalapenos, pepper Jack, Chipotle mayo, ""Baja"" sauce, LTO, and cilantro. First bite - excellent char on the burger. Tasted great! But then there was something...chewy. Examine please. Well, how does one fry a jalapeno to the consistency of a tire plug? I went home and tried it without success. The jalapenos were certainly not crispy. Both sandwiches were ordered with 'crispy thin fried'. Thin? Check. Crispy? Not a one that either of us found. And very nearly not done. Service was okay, but nothing to write home about. Bottom line - not on the return to list, at least for a long time. My 'WOW' is now a 'meh'."
Chuck N.,"Tallahassee, FL",20,9,5,5.0,9/13/2015,Mikael was a great server. Service was great and management was on point. We will return.
Channa P.,"Knoxville, TN",325,474,166,3.0,2/1/2015,"I was visiting Tallahassee and this bar was the closest thing. I went in around 9:30 and had a decent beer and appetizer. This place seems like it's pretty standard. it's a huge room with a seemingly larger menu.  Since it was so late, I got the avocado spring rolls. They were really good and also very filling. I managed to leave a couple on my plate. For the beer there is a pretty large draft menu and some BJ specialty offerings. There are also some local brews and other domestics and imports. I've chose one of the BJ brews and was definitely just what I needed. This place is great for a standard bite and a range of beer. I'd stop in again if I was nearby, but I wouldn't go out my way to eat there."
Rashida C.,"Atlanta, GA",247,109,86,3.0,1/3/2015,"Ho hum!  This is such a pretty restaurant with a big menu of traditional, comfort American bar food. Pizzas, burgers, wraps and the like.   The only issue is.....it's mediocre at best. Customer service was great and our server was energetic. That's really the only thing good....customer service. It took 20 mins to put in a order by the way it's Friday evening with light customer traffic, it took almost 30 for our burgers.  I had a burger which was burnt to hell and tasteless (I asked for medium well) the fries were nothing to write home about. The floors were dirty I stepped on 2 chicken bones and a napkin with both feet.....yuck!  The drink was pretty good a bit overpriced but still strong. I tried the peanut butter pizzokie and it was delightful. So overall an Ok experience of a bland entree, good service, good drinks and great dessert."
