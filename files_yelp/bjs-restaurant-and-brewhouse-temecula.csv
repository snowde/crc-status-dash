Rhonda W.,"Corona, CA",35,39,21,5.0,8/3/2017,"I have to give the manager props for being who she is. Very sweet and very professional. I made a mistake on my order and didnt see the burger sauce listed on the menu. So my bad when I had them take off everything but the sauce. )= So I didnt like the burger. Again, my fault. I did not ask for it removed due to my mistake and when asked if I wanted something else, I passed. Manager on the floor came up and apologized and insisted that I not leave hungry. She wanted me to be happy and full. I finally gave in and ordered  a single deep dish pizza with the fixins. Excellent choice by the way!  So long story short, burger was taken off and so was the pizza. I was taken back by that and told the server that they shouldn't have removed the food from bill. She said the manager insisted since I had to wait for my food. Talk about professionalism from the facility and the kindness and sweetness from her.  I went and found her on my way out and thanked her and gave her a hug. Need more people like her in this world.  Thank you.... Visit was 7/29/2017"
Eddie W.,"Upland, CA",105,47,63,2.0,11/10/2017,"In a past life I was a bartender. I completely understand being busy. I remember my first St Patrick's day both of the bars (the place I worked had one on each floor) ran out of ice. Needless to say I have empathy for wait staff and bartenders. But seriously, waiting at an unbused bar table for 20 minutes even after a waitress said ""We'll get that cleaned off for you."" a minute after I sat down seems understandable but not necessarily the best example of organized, well-managed service. I get it, it's Friday, Veterans Day...but 20 minutes?  My only suggestion would be to increase staff by one or two during holiday promotions times might be a plausible solution. This review serves as a note to management rather than bad review of wait staff on a busy night."
Joe T.,"Temecula, CA",0,465,44,2.0,10/29/2017,"We came in on Saturday for ""brunch"" around 12pm. 1.  Lemon Thyme Chicken-  Ordered with no bell peppers.  First time served, it came out as some totally different dish,  not what was ordered at all and WITH bell peppers.  The server immediately noticed this and took it back.  Had to wait just a couple of minutes for the correct item to be served and it was the right item but again served WITH bell peppers.  :-( 2.  California Scramble with Hatch Green Chils.  Barely 1 egg worth of scrambled eggs on it (I think it said 3?) and funny, I know, but this had NO Hatch green chilis within the dish at all. (I like peppers, she doesn't).  Hatch chilis are the BOMB! 3.  Southern Comfort Crispy Chicken Sandwich- YUM.  This was the best dish of all really good.  Excellent flavors, yummy fries.   Bottom line, the place wasn't that busy to have menu errors.  It's probably good for pizza.  Not so sure on other items due to this visit. *Note that the Manager did apologize and comp the Thyme Chicken due to the errors.  Thanks for that."
Jaelyne S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,18,26,3.0,10/24/2017,"The hostess, Riley, was super friendly & outgoing. Our server, Carlos, was also very friendly, attentive, & helpful. We ordered the peanut butter s'mores & ghirardelli pizookies (which were amazing, especially for $3 each). The great customer service really made our visit EDIT: everything was great, except for the cockroach that crawled past my feet as we were waiting for our check...."
Blair H.,"Hemet, CA",2,135,385,5.0,12/23/2017,"It's been a while we came to this location but this last visit was very good indeed. We tried the Ahi Poke appetizer and chicken lettuce wraps for the first time and the family liked them. The cheese deep dish pizza was good as well as the pita shrimp tacos. Service is always great so no complaints there. We didn't stay as long as we wanted to because we had so many holiday errands to run, so we didn't even order desert. But for a fun and quick dinner stop it was actually a delicious experience."
Luis C.,"Perris, CA",0,1,4,2.0,10/21/2017,Worst customer service ever. Spilled water didn't bother to clean it up spilled chips left them on the table I'm guessing for us to eat them off the table. Found I don't know what in the ranch. I don't know but other restaurants seem to be way better then this way over priced for this wasn't worth it.  UPDATE: I have to say thank you to the manager for contacting me and trying to make what happened to me and my wife right. I appreciate the fact that you took the time to contact me personally. I hope that if we decide to visit again our experience is different.
Annie P.,"Murrieta, CA",0,36,,2.0,1/10/2018,"We didn't have the whole experience as we had our food delivered by a delivery service. We ordered three rather pricey pizzas from BJ's and pretty much got three boxes of cooked pizza dough, very tasty bread it was, but sadly lacking much in the way of toppings. Very little cheese or sauce on any of the three, but interestingly enough quite a bit of tough overcooked chicken on two of the pizzas. I do realize that one delivery order doesn't give much of an overview of what a restaurant offers though."
Kathy N.,"San Diego, CA",80,257,3061,2.0,2/22/2017,"ughhhh BJs in general has a great menu for big groups and families but oh man this BJs in Temecula has some work to do on training their service staff / waiters. We spotted a hair in our spinach dip and our waiter Keith just looked at it said ""Oh"" and walked away, he did that a couple times, just ignoring our questions   The waiter was nice half the time and weird the other half of the time, felt like he had an evil twin or something. Yea I also agree with another review I read that the seared ahi salad looks NoTHING like the photo haha, although it was pretty tasty. I was happy I could substitute the wontons for crispy onion strings, much yummier. The grilled chicken sandwich with fries was delicious. The chicken alfredo ended up being a bit too oily."
Matthew S.,"Temecula, CA",0,50,1,4.0,12/27/2017,"I like stopping by here every once and a while. Their to go service is the fastest I've seen. I like their pizza, and love their black cherry soda."
Derek T.,"Wildomar, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/24/2017,Ashley S took 30 minutes and never checked on us until I said something. Our tab was 18 bucks so I gave her 40 to get change and she brings me a 20 and two 1's so she only got a couple bucks for a tip. Sorry service by our server
Sheila J.,"Flagstaff, AZ",162,10,,5.0,12/24/2017,"Melissa M. was our waitress and let me tell you.. she was AMAZING!!! My birthday had past a week ago and she was checking my ID to make sure that I was old enough to drink and as soon as she read the date she was so excited and was checking on us every 15 minutes to make sure that we were satisfied, needed more drinks and everything. When it came time for dessert, I didn't want anyone to sing to me so another lady brought out our dessert and Melissa came running after her with candles, let them and told me to make a wish and blow out the candles. Every time she came by she reminded me of how it's still my birthday no matter the day we celebrate. She was amazing!!!"
Cheryl Q.,"Running Springs, CA",18,10,,5.0,12/26/2017,"Love the small plates! Prices are very reasonable, great service and food on point. Loved the turkey meatballs!"
Buhtra S.,"Vinita, OK",0,16,19,4.0,11/13/2017,This place used to be good- got bad- and now the quality has dramatically improved. This is my go to place for lunch. Nice outdoor patio- great place to hang out and grab a drink.
Trey P.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",229,51,313,3.0,6/26/2017,"Stopped by BJ's to take a break with traffic coming from Palm Springs. My wife and I usually stop by here when we head home to SD. Usually the food is superb however today they got my order all wrong. I asked for the Root Beer ribs however received wings instead. The server was nice enough to bring out my ribs 10 mins later however these portion looked like rib tips and not ribs. The pizza was good as usual and so was my salad. Lately, the BJ food experience has not been up to par on our last few visits to their resturant. I think I will be taking a break from eating at their spots for a while."
Yvette A.,"Encinitas, CA",76,171,60,3.0,6/5/2017,This place is really close to the dealership I bought my car at and since I was having some work done I figured I had some time to kill and BJ's is usually pretty good. They had outside seating with misters which was great. The server was really nice and attentive. The food was just ahhh...  We had Brussels sprouts as an app and they were good but needed more balsamic and bacon. I ordered the special which was shrimp skillet with jalapeno corn and was not impressed it had 4 little pieces of shrimp in a tiny skillet with some corn that was smothered in sauce. My friend had a burger that was pretty bland. The beer was cold so that was good. Overall the food needs to improve.
Stephanie B.,"Murrieta, CA",28,132,24,1.0,11/3/2017,"Definitely won't be returning. The service was beyond disappointing. Our waitress couldn't be bothered to refill our drinks and or even see if we were satisfied with our food. We barely touched most of our food and you would think that would be a good time to ask if it was ok, but no. The food runners kept dumping all of our hot plates in front of our small children. The best part was sitting next to not one but three filthy tables for a majority of our meal. Management should make training priority at this point."
Benton H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",110,4,3,5.0,10/10/2017,"I love and mean absolutely love coming to BJ's but the one closest to me has been very disappointing as of lately so a friend of mine invited me to the one in Temecula and mannnnn they showed out! Our server Jason greeted us immediately when we were seated and we received our food within minutes and he checked on us making sure everything was perfect and it was. I think I will start going out of my way now just to come to this location, it's definitely worth the extra drive."
Ashley H.,"Temecula, CA",10,4,,5.0,11/19/2017,"Love love love coming here. I usually do appetizers and a drink for a quick bite with friends. Their lemon Thyme Chicken is amazing, the Peruvian Quinoa bowls are a great choice as well. Today I tried the Santa Fe chicken salad and I can't even begin to explain how amazing this is. Yes I'm a little dramatic but basically I haven't been disappointed. Oh and the service? Yes, love it. They're always so nice and friendly and so helpful! On my birthday our waiter remembered to bring shots out exactly at midnight even though we forgot. I was impressed since it was a busy night. The couscous mac n cheese is a must! Love it here."
Hugo G.,"Temecula, CA",3,10,15,5.0,11/10/2017,"I would like to take time to thank and make a point that in Friday night Nicole (the blonde) and Kaitlyn Q were phenomenal with their services. Kaitlyn was very welcoming and professional with her services without being our server. Really thank you guys in a very busy Friday night , great service we'll be back soon ,"
Ed K.,"Temecula, CA",6,60,38,2.0,12/19/2016,I apologize in advance but this was about poor management and execution. Bar staff caked see my tip. After making a poor Black and Tan it took me 5 min to get another beer. Nice penalty for criticizing your poor Black and Tan. Service is king and make stuff happen for customers. Especially when you don't know your job! My ahi salad sucked!
Mike M.,"Menifee, CA",0,16,,3.0,11/24/2017,"I'm back!  And BJs is just as schizophrenic as ever.  Try this when you go in:  tell them that every other dadblasted BJs in the known universe can get closed captioning on their televisions and ask if they can.  They will A) tell you that no one there knows how to activate the CC, B) it is broken (and has been since the store opened) and currently being repaired or C) they are the one BJs w/o CC.   I know, I know, it sounds trite and trivial but I have been fighting this fight since opened and they still insists it work but it never does. The service has improved and the bar is excellent.  The employees and friendly and concerned for you well-being but those darn televisions . . ."
Janine T.,"Vista, CA",179,11,3,4.0,11/2/2017,Bjs in Temecula was great. The employees were all friendly and prompt. I got seated quickly and my meal was fantastic.
Kendra L.,"Murrieta, CA",35,5,,1.0,11/4/2017,I am very disappointed with BJs tonight! I ordered a to go order through Grubhub. I received my food and was noticed right away that neither my husband nor my own baked potato was thoroughly cooked. My husbands was still pretty much raw and very hard. Both of our steaks had absolutely no flavor at all and they were very burnt. I asked for no tomatoes on our salad.. and you guessed it! We got tomatoes. Our whole dinner was ruined.
Ariel R.,"Temecula, CA",321,135,77,3.0,11/15/2016,"I'm BAAAAAaaack... for the Pizzookie only. For a Monday night, it was pretty busy. Every time I've came here for dinner, there was never an issue with us getting seated right away. It was my Son's Birthday and right after Day-Care, my Husband and I took him to get a Pizzookie since he's a cookie and ice cream fanatic (Gets it from his mom) . Our server was nice and attentive. We didn't really ask for much during our dessert, but when I did, he was quick.  Birthday Boy got his own little personal Pizzookie while I was daring and ordered the Trio Pizzookie, giving you the options to choose three of their cookie flavors all topped with their vanilla ice cream. My husband decided on the Chocolate Chunk, Cookies n' Creme and Salted Caramel. Everything took about 10 minutes to come out. Birthday boy even got a Candle on top of his Pizzookie. Everything was warm and extremely fresh. Warm and delicious! YUM! My favorite will always be the chocolate chunk which is just a chocolate chip cookie. I always for some reason order the Oreo Cookie and I'm always indifferent about it. They have this Cookie and cream paste that they squirt on the side of the dish... which is an odd texture. The salted caramel was meh... nothing special to me, but I'm not that much of a fan for caramel. Total bill came up to $14.05. In total I paid $16.00 including tip. Literally just for dessert. Insane."
Valerie M.,"Temecula, CA",141,1,,1.0,11/10/2017,"It was terrible! My food was late, took almost 2 hours! The food was cold. They didn't deliver everything I ordered, and added something I didn't order. When I called they told me I was going to just get an emailed gift card of $10, still haven't gotten. My order was $35 for an $18 meal! Then I got an up charge of another $2 because the pricing was wrong on the menu! What a joke, and overall terrible experience! Don't order from them!!"
A V.,"Oceanside, CA",2,213,136,2.0,10/22/2017,"So I must admit, I'm not really a fan of this location. After waiting for about an hour to get a seat, I spent pretty much $80 for two of us and must say that I was not impressed with the quality of the food that we received. Probably will not be revisiting this location. It was just bland at best."
Bernadette R.,"Temecula, CA",1,24,7,5.0,11/7/2017,"Came on Monday and did not know that they have weekly specials. Monday is half off pizza's and their pizza's amazingly good, they also have happy hours specials they have a burger deal for $6 on the happy hour amazingly good. Need to try more of their desls"
Larissa J.,"Temecula, CA",0,9,,1.0,10/27/2017,"This Location was my favorite but I feel like is going downhill. A few months ago I came in and the waitress was very rude. When we got our check she circled the suggested tip as if we didn't know we had to leave a tip. Absolutely rude! Last night we also came in around 8pm. They took forever to Acknowledge my party, we waited forever to order our food. And it took forever to get it brought to our table as well. 3 different waiters came to our table and were absolutely rude. Also they messed up on our food. So disappointed. I probably won't be going back."
Pauline M.,"Temecula, CA",29,86,817,5.0,4/24/2017,"My husband and I have eaten here several times and we've always enjoyed the food, service and the ambience. Our server Janey was very attentive and friendly. We didn't even ask for refills for iced tea, she was on top of it. I'm on a special diet, the menu is great that you can find many things for any diet you are on, if you can resist the other yummy stuff."
Kimberely R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,1,,4.0,7/23/2017,"The appetizers, potato skins and chicken pot pies were good and could have easily been shared by two.  The server could have received a higher tip if her customer service was better.  She was slow in bringing us our food and it appeared as if she was not familiar with the check out process and honoring their reward points.  However,   she had a positive and pleasant attitude."
Chelsea G.,"Murrieta, CA",160,24,27,2.0,6/23/2017,I haven't been here in about a year 1/2.. idk what happened to management but I didn't talk to one worker that didn't have a weird attitude. They were all pacing everywhere for no reason. It wasn't busy tonight.. every worker looked like they hate life.. anyways.. on another note the food.. ehh.. was very bland.. I took it home to fix it lol  I got the couscous mac and cheese and a side Cesar salad. Salads was good as always but the couscous mac and cheese had no cheese flavor at all.. tasted like just a roux.. before you add the cheese haha
Limairi S.,"Temecula, CA",27,7,7,5.0,10/13/2017,This is my most favorite place to eat besides dennys.  I always get something different and each thing I get is delicious.  Dominic is the best server ever.  I have this complicated order where I don't want cold water so I have them put some hot water in it and he accommodated me very well. I think he'll be management soon . He's a real good guy
Buster D.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,,1.0,12/23/2017,"O.K. , after two years of being away from B.J.'s because of poor food quality and being served cold , we came back during the Christmas holiday . Gift cards were given to my wife at work , so we thought we'd try B.J.'s again , hopefully this time things have changed , but NOOOOO !! The food quality has changed  , but for the worse . Not getting into the whole meal my wife and kids had ordered (which by the way was mediocre) , I'll just concentrate on my order . I ordered a bison cheeseburger w/bacon , fries and a drink. Simple right ?? When they sat down our order and I looked down at my plate , I grabbed a fry , which many restaurants are notoriously served cold , of course they were sitting in the pan in the back cold . I asked the server right away to bring me some fresh fries , no problem . I then looked back down at my burger at the bacon, looked like it was just shaved off the pig , RAW !! Not only RAW , but ice cold , like they just took it out of the refrigerator .I picked it up and it was refrigerator cold , they didn't even attempt to heat it up . I grabbed the bacon out of disgust went to find the manager . After some time he came out the back from the kitchen and I relayed my story to him , he gave me some minor pushback , and I told him ""Touch the bacon , it's raw and cold"" , how do you as a restaurant dare serve food like this , long story short he took care of the food bill , because he knew what they served us was disgusting . Trichinosis is a big deal eating out and I know if I ate that food/bacon there was a high probability I would've gotten sick . B.J.'s is a disgusting restaurant for food , unqualified cooks that serve poor quality food . I gave the gift cards to the table next to us , they were grateful . I will never return to this establishment . I'm not sure if all the B.J.'s are this poor quality , but this one needs to have top level management go in and do an overhaul of the complete restaurant ."
Frank A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,4.0,10/8/2017,"I've been a frequent BJ's customer for a number of years.. so far, so good.. considering how popular it has gotten, they still serve great food and good beer. Their jeremiah red is my personal favorite, however their other beers are good too. Their menu occasinally changes as they add and/or remove items, but  overall it's a great place to eat, drink, watch a game, etc.. I give it 4 stars."
Brad B.,"Temecula, CA",2,56,15,1.0,9/27/2017,Lots of issues. Alfredo at the bar working double shift slow as a snail and overwhelmed. Shrimp tacos came out very late and ice cold. Stay away.
Deja O.,"Fallbrook, CA",11,101,55,5.0,4/14/2017,"I have eaten here twice. The wait was not long, staff very friendly, and food amazing. My 3 year old is very picky and loved their thin crust pizza. We had a great time. I LOVE their nachos and cheese."
Scot L.,"Temecula, CA",343,69,57,4.0,10/1/2017,"This location is either VERY good, or just so-so to below average. Sit in the bar area for better service. Managers are great, servers are nice too. Service can be a little slow, hostesses no where to be found most times or chatting about something that is ""more important"" outside of work and BJ's, seriously annoying. Your customers first and last impression are HHHUUUGGGEEE!"
Heather M.,"San Diego, CA",164,44,1,3.0,5/7/2017,"Restaurant was clean. Front desk staff was friendly  And the food was good but service by Ashley S was terrible. She didn't tell her name when she originally walked over, just placed a single menu on a 2-top table and walked away. After several minutes came back and without a word placed another menu on the table and left. She only came over two times during the entire time we were seated in her section the table runner provided better service  Between the hardship of parking and the bad service I won't be returning to this location. I'll frequent that one in mission valley,San Diego instead."
Charley S.,"Poway, CA",0,6,10,5.0,12/9/2017,Overall great experience! Pretty much got right in and seated right away last night for a party of 3. Our server Melissa M was prompt and personable. Our drinks were always topped off & service was quick.
Linda W.,"Temecula, CA",78,150,120,1.0,3/31/2017,I like this restaurant just fine but last night I thought a big clump of dust was going to fall from the chandelier into my food. Pretty disgusting.
