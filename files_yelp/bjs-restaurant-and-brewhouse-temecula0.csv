Jared B.,"Temecula, CA",4,13,1,4.0,1/31/2016,BJ's is one of our family favorites. We called ahead and were seated within 25 mins on a Saturday night. The service was excellent! The food was good as always.
Deric M.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",5,32,,5.0,8/22/2016,We were so impressed with the very friendly staff and good food.  We sat in the bar area and the bartenders were awesome- genuinely friendly and attentive.  We will be back soon!
Jay V.,"Temecula, CA",0,69,8,4.0,2/17/2016,"Usually get a seat fairly quickly. Good food and decent service. Parking is not great, but okay."
Priscilla S.,"Murrieta, CA",1,14,,5.0,2/15/2016,"Got seated super quick, our food was on the table within 25 mins of being seated, food was great, plus Kat was every bit of amazing. Everything was awesome."
Suzie D.,"Murrieta, CA",76,97,2,4.0,1/25/2016,"Service was good, drinks were cold, food was good and fresh. I had the lunch special with wedge salad and personal one topping pizza. Pizza wasn't all the way done in the middle that's the reason for four stars. Our server sent it to be cooked some more and it came back hot and done. All was good and we will be back."
Larry M.,"Murrieta, CA",28,80,51,5.0,8/17/2014,"Good food, excellent service, fair prices ..... The location of the Temecula store is great, easy access. It's nice to go into a restaurant during lunch and be seated and served in a reasonable time. Plenty of ample parking. All sounds like a winner. Afterward, swing by Costco to pick up a few things."
Sherry B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,10,1,5.0,8/28/2016,"We had the Fried Chicken lunch special and the mini Mediterranean pizza...both delicious! These are two of our favorites.It's been a long time since we have said that our waiter was excellent , but we were able to say it on this trip. We had a young man named Evan. He did everything but shine our shoes.. the service he provided was incredible. What an asset he is to this restaurant. Great food and beyond excellent service from our waiter, Evan. Thank you!"
jerry b.,"Temecula, CA",57,112,54,5.0,12/3/2015,"It's all right... If you like fantastic food, great service, awesome drink selections including house brewed beers and root beer. If you're into that sort of thing, then I guess you should try it ;)"
Sarah B.,"Temecula, CA",65,65,16,5.0,10/26/2014,"We love this place! Kids meals are awesome. I have a toddler with a cold, so curbside takeout is such a luxury!  First time using it, and I'm so grateful. The lady on the phone was so friendly also! No complaints other than the prices on pizza ;)   $21 for a 12 inch special is pretty high. bring cash if possible,  the poor girl had to go back in to run my card...i figured they'd have a portable card processor. Oops."
Humberto G.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",3,7,,2.0,8/12/2015,"I love BJ's. Me and my friends absolutely love it. But tonight we got the worst service ever! A waitress named Carly was extremely rude to us. She told us about the Happy hour at 10 pm and my friend said ok I'll take it. But she was so rude cause she's like ""I said it's only at the bar"" She never said that and was extremely rude. So my friend said why would you tell me that and not explain it right to me. And she repeated what she said earlier but so rude. That she walked away with the worst face ever as if we were arguing with her. My friend just asked why she would offer it and not explain it right and she was so rude to us. The rest of the night she didn't even look at me or my friend and just looked and spoke to my friends younger brother. So rude. So unprofessional. Her name is Carly. I honestly expected more from BJ's and their staff."
Norman R.,"Murrieta, CA",3,21,3,4.0,11/5/2015,"Wife and I dropped-in on Halloween after a party for some food and a drink. No food poisoning on our behalf, but chicken wings, calamari, and a complementary ""Pazooki""  was the extent of our dining. We sat at the bar to ensure prompt service, and the experience was wonderful due to the calm, quiet atmosphere. Great time~!"
Christopher W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,7,1,5.0,7/30/2015,Best place to go for gluten free pizza. They know what they are doing when someone can't eat gluten. I eat here all the time when I want some pizza. It's gluten free and tastes amazing.
Brooke G.,"Phoenix, AZ",973,246,242,2.0,8/27/2012,"Went here after a morning of new car shopping.  We were starving and decided to give Temecula BJ's a shot. First off, it was a Sunday, when we first arrived the place was pretty empty. Our server came over after we had been sitting a while and took our drink order. Then she brought my beer out, then she brought out my boyfriends iced tea then she vanished. After quite some time, (long enough that boyfriend needed a refil and still didn't get one) she finaly came back to take our order.  I ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps, he ordred a meaty small pizza. After about 25 minutes our food came out. His pizza was cold, I mean like cheese wouldn't even stretch cold. He is pissed and thirsty, I am pretty content on  my meal itself, but it is a chilled meal so I have no idea if my meal would have been cold too had it been a ""hot"" meal. We asked for our check a couple times and a box. Finally our check came, but no box. If you are going to be a decent restauranrt, have decent service.  This easily could have been a great review but because a server failed to do her job, we had cold pizza, no tea and slow service. It made for a bitter experience and will not be back to this location."
Salvador M.,"Wildomar, CA",0,13,,1.0,5/8/2015,"This place is way too expensive and not worth the price. My friends and I ordered one pizza, 3 sodas and 2 salads. Somehow the bill was over $35 for hardly any food. Haven't gone back since."
Marcus G.,"Temecula, CA",0,5,5,2.0,2/7/2016,"I normally come here fairly often for myself or to pick up food for my boss, but last night I had the worst service possible. My friends and I were greeted politely & seated fast (that probably was the only decent thing that happened) but from the moment we were seated it took approximately 15 minutes before seeing our waiter. When he came he kept leaving too soon (not allowing us to order properly) he was very rude (tossing coasters our way like he was playing a damn game of black jack) and then he disappears for another 20 minutes before allowing us to order. After ordering I asked for a refill, he walked past me at least 5 times and another waitress brought our food and my refill out, he showed up with my refill 12 minutes after I asked. At this point I was fed up and asked a different server for her manager. In doing so she rudely placed her hand up to me (telling me to wait) so I was just done at that point.  When the manager came I lit him up and all he had to say was, ""hmm that's not right, that sucks I'm sorry"". He didn't offer how to fix the situation so instead I requested our waiters be switched. It was just pleasant to end the evening with someone who has at least a tad bit of respect for their customers & care about their damn job!!!"
Mary B.,"San Diego, CA",0,32,1,4.0,12/29/2015,"Another solid lunch visit at BJs in Temecula. Service was great, food was good. The ONLY downside is there are so many menu items it is so hard to decide on what to order."
Daniel P.,"Temecula, CA",4,28,14,3.0,11/15/2015,Management must be gone for the night because waitress and waiters are doing too much chatting/flirting with each other and not enough service. Food still tastes good though.
John E.,"Encinitas, CA",8,99,3,1.0,4/13/2014,"Pizza sucks Service sucks Beers suck This place is all smoke and mirrors... Chicago pizza, yeah right, this place started in Santa Ana CA... The best thing I had was the water! I don't understand how restaurants like this exist...???pumping out processed junk and faux deep dish"
Cyndi A.,"Temecula, CA",0,35,10,5.0,7/14/2015,"Wow, the service provided by this restaurant was stellar!  We started our lunch with their delicious fried artichokes and broccoli cheddar soup (better than Paneras).  My husband ordered a mini pepperoni pizza and I ordered the small buffalo chicken pizza.  I know what you are thinking!  Why did she order the small and her husband the mini right?  BJs buffalo chicken pizza is to die for.  You gotta have leftovers.  Here's where the story gets good. When my pizza arrive it was not hot. Phillip our server was fantastic.  He offered to get a soup or salad while I waited for that pizza. I declined. Phillip told the manager in the kitchen my pizza was cold.  The manager brought me out a mini buffalo chicken pizza and they wrapped my small to go!!!  Who does that anymore?  Isn't the service provided by BJs what we all long for?  Thank you BJs.  Telling everybody I know why BJs has such an awesome reputation."
Andrea F.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,2,3.0,1/23/2016,"Being a football fan, I think maybe I wasn't all that interested in going for dinner even though got a ride from some family who live an hour away from Temecula. It was my sister's birthday so we had to go.  Soda was flat and I asked for another but that was flat too so I gave up. LOL  I liked where we were as it wasn't too loud but there was a game on and it was nice to watch it for a bit even though I'm one of those who wants to hear everything but being in a restaurant, that's not possible.  I had the portobello burger which I thought was good and I liked the waitress we had. We had to wait for someone who was coming but he had called his gf to give the order and we finally ordered. They had some of the birthday ice cream cake but I have to admit, it just didn't look all that appetizing."
