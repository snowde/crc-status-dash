Carole S.,"Temecula, CA",1,310,9,4.0,7/5/2016,"Got the chicken bacon ranch Piadina with thin crispy fries and OMG was it ever good, and only $9.  Loved, loved, loved it!  Noisy in there with many TVs all going on different stations, the music system trying to compete with a packed place and everyone talking at once.  Took a star off for all the noise.  Even though it was crowded, service and food was fast and good.  Definitely will be going back.  Oh, the pizzas looked wonderful too."
Jonathan D.,"Menifee, CA",47,7,,5.0,3/10/2017,"Madison our server was great. Some of the best service I have had in a while. These guys know how to run a restaurant. Even on a full Friday night, our experience was perfect."
Elsie H.,"Temecula, CA",0,18,1,5.0,3/9/2017,I was there last night and had the best service! Her name was Samantha and she was very consistent and attentive. I had a lot of alterations and she was very patient with me and got everything right. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and it was so delicious I got two.
K O.,"Long Beach, CA",648,6,3,5.0,3/4/2017,"Okay, out of over 20+ visits, I have yet to have a ""great"" experience at BJs, BUT this visit is an EXTREME exception and it will keep me coming back!! Jessica, our cute bubbly blonde waiter was INCREDIBLE. One of the best servers I have yet to have. The food was great, the drinks were great.  Everyone should ask for Jessica because she will make your experience wonderful. That girl needs a major raise or promotion! Definitely knows how to make the customer say WOW!"
George L.,"Clarksville, TN",6,152,231,5.0,11/30/2015,"Pleasantly surprised by my visit.  Was expecting average Chili's type of place.  I would say this is closer to Cheesecake factory in terms of quality and menu breadth.   Service was spectacular.  One server for party of 14.  Never saw anyone so prompt with drink refills!!   Food all came out hot, and every dish was good, all 14 of them...ranging from fish, to salads, to pasta, and fried chicken.   Better than a ""3"" rating than this currently has.  Would say this is closer to 4.25-4.5 range."
Marcy C.,"Murrieta, CA",1,20,9,5.0,8/6/2017,Evan our server was awesome he was attentive and quick he is by far the best server we have had here! The food was great like always...try the Sriracha dry rub wings they are the best!! The Mid summer ale beer was really good too!
Costa M.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,,1.0,3/20/2017,"We ordered burgers (guacamole & blue cheese) and pizza among everybody. The blue cheese burgers arrived cold and the blue cheese itself on each burger did not exceed half a teaspoon. Disappointment. Also, these burgers were of the greasiest that we ve ever tried. Fries have some type of salty spice on them, that it was impossible for all to finish them. There were 4 slices of pizza left over, so we decided to ask for a box. The waiter addressed the cold food issue to the manager and she was nice enough to come, apologize and give us a discount on the whole check. No complaints from their customer service. Next day however when my son went to open up the pizza box and eat a piece, we were all in shock to see that the slices had SHRUNK to almost HALF the size of the original piece!!! Of course we threw everything in the trash. It is a SHAME that companies like this try to save pennies on such a low cost item (i.e. pizza) by adding blowing agent crap in their food. It's obvious that their primary goal is profit, not quality."
David R.,"Winchester, CA",3,50,,4.0,3/12/2017,"So, we have been disappointed with BJ's far more times than happy.  We decided to go here again, against my better judgement.  The Tortilla soup was excellent.  We have had so many small, cold, or just plain sparce and lousy bowls here, I was hopeful, but not expecting anything different.  The soup was excellent, a decent portion and actually had some chicken in it this time.  The pizza was the best we have had here, decent amount of sauce, we asked for no tomatoes and extra sauce, and probably the same amount of toppings on this one pizza, than on our last three pizzas here.  This was a redeeming visit, and we will probably be back again sooner rather than later."
Beau P.,"Palm Springs, CA",29,60,58,5.0,1/1/2017,"First of all let me say this is my first time at this restaurant. And it was a great experience, Bree our server was amazing,  the food was expedited out of the kitchen in a timely manner, very impressed, never had  to ask ask for our drinks to be refilled Bree was always there to see that we were taken care of."
Maggie B.,"Chandler, AZ",8,44,6,4.0,10/13/2016,"First time at this location. Had excellent service from Travis, then Eric. It was difficult trying to figure out what I could eat with my uncommon allergies, but Eric was stellar in helping me figure what to have. When I saw that the quinoa side that came with my Shrimp & Arugula Tacos contained cucumber, he noticed it without my bringing it to his attention & took it away, saying ""You can't have that,"" then asked me what I could have. Since everything other than some salad was not for me, I went without, but totally appreciated his efforts! It's so nice to know special needs can be accommodated. What I did have to eat was very tasty, as was my DH's chicken Caesar salad. Only complaint would be the wait for food, but the place was packed, so it was expected. Thank you so much for the great experience!!"
Gari Y.,"Temecula, CA",46,1,,5.0,2/9/2017,"I've been watching customers complain about the smallest things and the Manager Juana handle all the problems VERY professionally. I can only say that this place has amazing service, awesome Bartenders...Elise and Claudian and of course, an AWESOME MANAGER...Juana !!! Two thumbs up young lady AGAIN for making this place AWESOME....."
Jason I.,"Norco, CA",8,127,3,2.0,5/30/2016,We occasionally eat here for dinner while working. The food is good if you actually get what you asked for or you get silverware before your food gets cold. You have to constantly be asking for your drink to get refilled and even at that it's multiple time asking before it gets refilled.  I don't know what it is about this location but the wait staff can never seem to get anything right. It's like it's training day everytime.
Brandon M.,"Temecula, CA",1,12,,4.0,7/28/2017,"They have a great selection of food and alcohol. They taste of both, are amazing. This place has been hit and miss as far as service. I have come here many times with excellent service, and other times have been very poor. However, the food and beer keeps me coming back."
Filiz B.,"Murrieta, CA",61,72,192,3.0,5/9/2016,"I 've been BJ so many times.i love bj's pizzaz beers appetizers, atmosphere is so cozy.very nice decorations.but today i ordered classic hamburger and i really don't like it.even i couldn't finished my burger.for today my stars going to our fast and very kind server!"
Derek C.,"Menifee, CA",100,76,199,3.0,3/3/2016,"Came here on a whim as we usually go to the one in Menifee where I live.  We ordered the Root Beer baby back ribs appetizer, Fried Artichokes, Salmon quinoa, and Halibut for lunch.  I specifically asked that our food be brought out piping hot, and the Artichokes were brought out lukewarm.  Ribs were not as tender and fall off the bone as Menifee BJ's was, and also, they skimped on the BBQ sauce, so we just had them sent back and taken off the check.  We were also pleased to find that the artichokes were taken off our check as well.  Management and server were great, but I don't think the kitchen staff is as ""on point"" as Menifee."
Sofia P.,"Temecula, CA",0,6,,3.0,7/18/2017,"Bj's in general is a great restaurant,but at this particular location the food was a thumbs down . My children received their chicken strips and they were so undercooked they were almost raw,it was disgusting! And the hamburger i received was so messily done."
Sandy S.,"Murrieta, CA",4,4,,2.0,10/6/2016,Very disappointed. We've had avocado egg rolls for years. These were missing something....hmmm...oh yeah AVOCADOS! They were filled with red mush and very very hot! Sent back one after three of us each tried them and they still charged us full price. No manager even came to the table.  Won't be back. Not the first time disappointed here.
Jeff R.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",526,20,4,5.0,5/9/2016,"My first time here Mom suggested BJ's which I like as a restaurant and their menu is great.  Being Mother's Day, the wait was long so we sat in the bar at a high table while we waited for our ""dining room table.""  Well, the server Megan K. was SO AWESOME that we did not want to leave the bar area (and we we not even drinking alcoholic beverages!) so we ordered with Megan. She was the absolute BEST server I have had at any restaurant and I dine out OFTEN! Thank you Megan!!!"
Michelle K.,"San Diego, CA",7,68,6,5.0,8/25/2016,I'm a regular here and my favorite servers are Nicole and Julie. They ALWAYS go above and beyond for their customers. They are the main reasons why I always come back.
maryann d.,"San Diego, CA",89,5,16,1.0,5/19/2017,"I went there with my family on Mother's Day and the hostess gave us a wait time of 50 minutes. I understood because there were many people waiting but I noticed others were seated before us who arrived after us. My husband asked how long and at this time we had already waited 48 mins. The hostess said ""sorry you have to wait another 30 mins. We took the callers before you and there are 2 other groups ahead of you."" I understand being busy but why couldn't they incorporate my group with the callers that supposedly  made reservations. I thought that was ridiculous. If I knew that Was the policy I should have called to make reservations. Horrible communication and service. I ate at BJ's many times on holidays, etc... I never had a problem until this day."
