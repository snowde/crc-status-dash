D D.,"Winchester, CA",0,5,1,1.0,2/24/2016,Very disappointed with the portion of the salmon I got when I ordered the Salmon Quinoa bowl for lunch to go today!
Kimberly K.,"Murrieta, CA",57,25,37,5.0,2/28/2016,"Great Sunday brunch and delicious (and affordable) bloody marys. Love this place! We always have good service here, and we love our experience each and every time!"
Eugene D.,"Sun City, CA",0,13,4,5.0,7/19/2016,"Always a friendly staff, love their bone in buffalo wings , avocado egg rolls and strawberry lemonade. Consistently great service"
Javier S.,"San Marcos, CA",0,10,,2.0,3/2/2017,Ordered the house serloin steak which on the picture looked like a normal sized steak but in reality got a tiny quarter of a steak compared to the picture on the menu. The place wasn't busy at all yet my meal came with asparagus which was cold not even warm. The steak was warm and the potato was hot. The steak tasted like it was cooked straight from the freezer. It had no taste. When I brought this to the waitress attention she said the steak shrinks when cooked. Duh! But the picture on he menu the steak was cooked and a lot larger. Good place for a beer but not for a nice dinner.
Kirsten M.,"Tempe, AZ",159,4,,5.0,12/24/2016,"We came on Christmas Eve, so surprised that they stayed open. Getting seated was fast and great atmosphere. Amber was our server and she was great. Great service and the place was clean. Will return soon!"
Jared S.,"Temecula, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/16/2016,"Walked in just after lunch time, and was seated immediately. We were served by Karlee L and she helped us decide what to order and told us if the happy hour specials which we took advantage of. Food came out quick and tasted incredible."
Josh W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,2,3.0,7/28/2016,"I went with my office to BJ's for lunch. The food was good, but the service was terrible. Two people at our table had not been brought their food by the time everyone else had finished eating.  What was most surprising was the amount of time it took them to bring out a bowl of soup. One person ordered soup and salad. They brought out the salad but the bowl of soup made it to the table after everyone finished eating. We asked three times about the soup and the waiters kept saying it was coming. It is mind blowing that no one could ladle soup into a bowl and bring it to the table. The manager did apologize and comped the two of these meals, but I do not believe I would revisit this BJs Overall, the food was good and restaurant was very clean, but the service was terrible."
Kevin D.,"Murrieta, CA",9,11,1,1.0,8/25/2016,"The manager screwed up my order and not all of the ingredients were on my burgers! Never order late on Sundays or Mondays, for the cook can't cook for nothing. You have been warned."
Sylvia M.,"Murrieta, CA",242,42,63,5.0,8/4/2016,"Out of all the BJ's we've been to, nothing beats the service we get here in my hometown. Whether I go with my family for dinner, with my friends to grab a pizookie, or just whatever, we always receive exceptional service and I'm grateful I don't have to travel far to find a quality place. The waiters are really thorough and detailed with the menus and I usually try whatever they suggest. All in all, the food is just like any other BJ's, but it's the service that makes this location stand out."
Tiffany R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,29,5,1.0,6/30/2016,"They don't care, their food is not as it is in other Bj's their lazy and incompetent (from the servers & cooks to the management)!  Drive the extra few minutes to go to the Bj's in Menifee it's worth the extra time!!  Do not order take out or curbside at this location, they are either sneaky and out to overcharge you, or they cant adequately train their staff in how to perform the rather simple task of taking your order. I ordered a Santa Fe Chicken Salad, and the lady behind the counter at the take out ended up ringing me up and subsequently charging me for the salad (which comes with chicken), and a side chicken breast totaling 17 dollars and change. How in the world this employee couldn't comprehend that the amount she was going to ring in for 1 salad was astronomically too high is beyond me. But if that was all that happened I could look past one horrid employee, and wouldn't have to write this review. But upon receiving my receipt and seeing what the take out counter had done with my order (they could have at least given me extra chicken but the cooks obviously felt like skimping out that day it was the smallest amount of chicken I'd ever seen on that salad.) I called to talk to a manager to inform him of what had happened so she could be properly trained and they wouldn't have this happen again. I was not looking for anything in return, but the call  progressively got worse. Take out counter was very rude, tried to not let me speak to a manager, then the manager tried to tell me I was wrong, then admitted they were in the wrong, never actually apologized, but asked for our address to send a gift card to encourage giving them another try. (didn't offer fixing the charge, or even a discount, or a refund, I ended up paying the full 17 dollars for that salad.) *Best part 4 months later... we're still waiting on that gift card that is never coming.. I refuse to eat from this location again. This wasn't the first bad experience I had had with them.. I just kept giving them the benefit of the doubt.. don't waste your time it's not worth it!"
Crystal G.,"Temecula, CA",8,34,10,1.0,12/1/2015,"Your service sucks :/ three time asked for water, still nothing.. Understaffed maybe? Better bring my bro his birthday dessert.. If you ""forget"", there will be hell to pay.  Disappointed Here's a tip BJ's have your staff look around when they walk through the floor.. Maybe they will see empty glasses and plates or wondering eyes... Everyone walks from point A to B as if nothing else is going on around them.. Still waiting on water..."
Dianna G.,"Temecula, CA",0,83,76,4.0,2/6/2016,Used the call ahead seating feature which was nice on a Saturday night in Temecula. Fortunately right after we got there we scored a table in the bar. We sat down and weren't immediately acknowledged by anyone. Then our waiter Matthew showed up and immediately apologized for not greeting us sooner. The restaurant was swamped. He was awesome!! He took our drink order quickly brought our food quickly all with a huge smile the entire time. He checked in often and our drinks were never empty. He was so fabulous and the food was delish. We will definitely be back
Ning s.,"Murrieta, CA",45,3,2,1.0,10/16/2016,Had dinner with the family 10/15/16 and I ordered a chicken club sandwich. I had the other piece of sandwich taken home and decided to eat later tonight. I looked at the sandwich and I saw the bacon raw. Called the restaurant and ask to speak for manager but I was put on hold for over 10 minutes. Very upsetting and wasted money. Never again eating at this place.
Helen B.,"Temecula, CA",20,46,11,1.0,11/18/2015,"This review is for the Temecula location, on Ynez Road.  Strike One: The hostess sat my husband and I near a family of four with two small children under five. The screaming and yelling that emanated from their table was enough to distract me from my meal the entire time I was there. Why would we be seated in what is obviously a section for families? I was very unhappy, and would have asked to move but for the rest of our experience making me want to leave the whole place as soon as I possibly could.  Strike Two: Our waitress was just plain strange. She would stand at our table after each interaction, like she was waiting for us to say something when we were clearly done with talking. Now, this can't really be helped, other than by not hiring odd people. But it DID make our dining experience a little uncomfortable.  Strike Three: We ordered the soup and salad combo, with the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl as the soup for each of us. The bread bowls were toasted beyond what is edible. We were JUST at the BJ's in Menifee, where they served a MUCH better version of this meal. The soup inside the bowls was slightly different as well, much thinner in texture with fewer clams. But the real sin was how blackened the bowls were! Normally, my husband would snack on the bowl once the chowder was eaten, and he pushed his plate away as soon as he possibly could.  I have not had any good experiences at this restaurant. I would not recommend it to someone visiting Temecula, because I don't feel that it is in any way a fair representation of the good food one can find in this area. Pass on this one, guys, and keep looking."
Kayla R.,"Murrieta, CA",219,28,70,5.0,4/1/2015,"I love BJ's! My best friend and I always eat here when we get together to catch up or just to grab a meal. We never go anywhere else. That's how much we love this restaurant. I've been here plenty of times and I have no complaint with anything what so ever! The ambiance is romantic and elegant, but you can come casual or dressy, which ever you prefer. I usually come for lunch or dinner and I never had to wait for a table. The service is always great! They're very friendly and patient with you, which I appreciate because I can be very indecisive, and they always check up on how we're doing often. The food comes very fast and fresh. I never get tired of the food here! I normally order the BBQ Chicken Salad or a pizza to share and they never disappoint! They also came out with new appetizers recently which I'm dying to try! I've tried the pepperoni dip and it's alright, not the best appetizer, but it was worth trying. And of course, we always have an Oreo Pazooki which is our favorite. Making your own pazooki's at home are just not the same. I don't mind spending $6 for a cookie with ice cream, they're amazing!"
Mo K.,"Temecula, CA",2,16,,1.0,12/29/2016,"The food is great but the service is terrible. The last time I went to BJ's I ordered takeout. When I arrived I had to wait a long time just to tell them that I'm picking up my order. The girl on the counter gave me unreasonable attitude and tossed the food on the counter and walked away. I was upset and left the restaurant. After a couple hours I tried calling to speak to a manager but I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. Like as said, good food but terrible customer service. Will not go or order from BJ's again.   Very disappointing."
Nancy T.,"Temecula, CA",18,22,,1.0,7/10/2016,Someone please explain why this is somehow a popular restaurant. Weird menu and food that is mediocre at best.
Jasmine O.,"Winchester, CA",43,17,6,1.0,2/22/2016,"I have been going to this location for quite some time. Normally it's not bad enough to comment but this time it's being noted. I took my 19 year old daughter here this past Thursday night to celebrate her bday. We had a party of 15 attending and I made sure all on one order to make it easier for the waiter. They weren't that busy, and it seemed we were going to be tended to. First delay was kids menus. Our waiter was getting us drinks and couldn't get anyone to help him. The hostess sat us down with not enough menus (her fault) yet he brought the drinks and then went missing. Finally when he came around we reasked for kids menus. Ordering went fine. Then came a manager trainee named Cody to let a waitress out of the emergency exit. The exit was right next to our table. She said can't I just go out this door? He gave in and let her out just so she could bring a friend thru the door. The problem was the alarm went off and kept ringing, right next to our table. Alarms happen and we are pretty understanding but this was left on while the staff was joking and playing around including Cody. Cody went to get the key and came to lock the door then says ""sorry bout that"". Doesn't even make eye contact and walks away. I was pretty angry by now. I felt I chose to spend a lot of money here and there are a bunch of restaurants in this area. Hmm I made the wrong choice. Well the food came and we had to ask our waiter twice for a child's spoon. Having a 3 year old stare at others while they eat doesn't work in any family. Period! The next doozer was using the restroom. What the hell???!! I have attached pictures. This restaurant needs Kandis the old manager to be back. She ran that place like a champ!! The bathroom counters were disgusting. This place has lost so much and will continue of their staff doesn't get a clue. I'm Disappointed for spending a fortune at a place that treated us as if we were buying fast food. I don't know if anyone could get me to go back to that location."
Daniel P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,5,1,5.0,9/5/2016,"Bj's BBQ pulled pork sandwich, honestly, is better than most legitimate restaurants that center around BBQ. The pork is so perfectly cooked, and dressed in just the right amount of sauce. The wedge cut fries are delicious, and as everyone knows, their p'zookie's are better than any other places replica attempts. Soft, gooey, delicious! They should be rated higher in my overall opinion. This was take-out, too...;)"
Christina M.,"Cardiff, CA",679,286,170,2.0,9/21/2014,"Not the best experience I've ever had at a BJ's... Although we were given a pager and told it would be a 20 min wait, myself and the group I was with were pleasantly surprised when we were seated 2 minutes later. Our waitress Megan was nice but very forgetful and incredibly slow with service. Our drinks took awhile to come out, so slow in fact I debated canceling my drink order since I prefer to enjoy my drink before my appetizer (which is why we ordered them before we ordered our appetizers). Nobody really cared for their food excepts for my daughter even though her fries were cold(not warm, literally cold) it was like they left them on the plate for awhile and then set hot chicken strips hoping they would warm them up. My pizza barely had any cheese and their were some spots where the vegetables on my pizza were only touching bread. Super bummed since I've had BJs pizza before and was expecting it to be just as good. Two of the people in my group didn't eat close to 1/2 of their food because it was either cold or sloppily prepared and Megan never bothered to check on us to see how our food was so they made do.  We decided to get dessert since no one was really full haha..The pizookies were delicious as always!! So that's where that second star comes in..the way to my heart is through dessert:) Bottom line, we all had fun because we were together but we wished we had chosen a different place for dinner since it was money wasted. Sadly, I won't be returning to this location!"
