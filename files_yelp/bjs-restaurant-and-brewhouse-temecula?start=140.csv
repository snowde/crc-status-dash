Mary R.,"Aguanga, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/11/2017,"If this would let me go negative stars I would choose that I ordered ahead 1 lg pizza and was told 15 minutes I show up 15 minutes exact and had to wait 10 minutes to talk to someone mind you this is a Tuesday night not too busy. Then I was told to have a seat by takeout and they'll bring me my pizza 58 minutes later I'm kind of losing my patience so I tell the manager this is kind of crap that I order ahead of time because neither me nor my husband can go sit down at a restaurant due to ailments and that it was our anniversary that they should do something to make up for their mistake all I got was a sorry and here's your pizza and on top of that I heard the manager lie on the phone to another customer that she would go look for keys instead went and talked to which had to be an old employee by the way all the workers stopped to say hi the manager then went back on the phone hello can I help you, oh sorry I was so busy I forgot, no liar you saw a friend and forgot about work. Any way whatever their customer service needs improvement."
Bryan R.,"Temecula, CA",0,1,,2.0,6/10/2016,"So i am a huge fan of this restaurant. I enjoy their food and the people are always friendly. Me and the wife decided to go enjoy some lunch there today and i was super excited to have a burger i saw on the online menu. When we got there there was no wait at all. We were seated before we even said hi....exagerration of course....as we sat there and looked at the menu, we literally decided our drinks, appetizer, and main meal...all while still not being greated by a waiter/waitress. After deciding our whole three course meal i started wondering why we havent even been greated and still to this point havent so much ordered drinks.  After 8 minutes i noticed that a table next to us had the waitress ask them for deserts, leave, bring them boxes, leave, and then bring them a check and drop off drinks at a different table and then once again leave...all while me and my wife sat there paitently to order our drinks. After 12 minutes we decided to leave because i couldnt imagine the wait to get a box or get our check or get a refill or any of that. I understand waiter/waitresses are nice and friendly but you also have a job to do. Im highly dissapointed. And what makes it worse is that they were not busy by any means as there was tables open all around us."
Caitlin Y.,"Long Beach, CA",63,90,165,1.0,8/22/2015,"Haven't been to BJ's in a hot minute and decided to stop in for lunch with my sister. We got in and were greeted. I notified the hostess it would just be for two. She then began a 2minute discussion with two other employees on where to sit us, claiming certain waiters/waitresses were too busy to have an additional table. They sat us in Robin's section and 5minutes passed before Robin came to greet us. We ordered our food and my sister asked for  a side of ranch with her meal. When our starter salads arrived, the Caesar didn't have enough dressing on it and my sister wanted to request a side. Well, Robin was nowhere to be found for quite a while. Finally my sister was able to flag her down and order that side of dressing. When our main dishes came, there wasn't any ranch delivered, so we had to request some from the girl who delivered our food to us. When we were almost done with our meal, Robin checked back in and asked if we wanted to get a pizookie. I told her we'd have to think about it. After finishing our meals we decided to get the pizookie trio. While waiting for our trio to arrive, Robin hands us the check and tells us to pay whenever we're ready. We had put cash in the check book but kept the book with us because we didn't want the already lacking service to dwindle because she already got paid out. Well, while we are enjoying our dessert, Robin approaches us and notifies us that she's leaving now since her shift is ending and rudely requests we give her the checkbook. Excuse me? I understand it can be a huge pain waiting tables, but I've never ONCE had someone come up and do that. I've had them introduce us to the next person who will be helping us, but never have I had someone rudely request us to handover the book so they can get paid out. So Robin leaves us, the new girl doesn't introduce herself. But as we are finishing up, she asks if she can have the checkbook. I tell her we already paid out. She then asks me if we are had a tip left or not. To get her to leave the situation alone I commented that there wasn't a tip. I then see her walk away and she goes up to Robin and I can see them exchanging words. I completely understand every waiter/waitress wants their tips and it's a huge part of their paycheck. But please don't pressure me into paying you, it makes the situation extremely uncomfortable. I really don't need you or your replacement breathing down my neck for your tip. I work hard for my paycheck and I'm not going to leave you a great tip for below par service paired with an awkward tip hungry departure. Sorry, not sorry. I won't be coming back ever again when your best employees here are the efficiently fast bus boys."
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",470,646,455,4.0,8/14/2014,"It's just another BJs, no complaints there. It is like any other -- crowded often, loud, beer, etc. The parking lot is large, service friendly and quick. However this last time I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup and a side Caesar salad. Bad choice. I couldn't finish the broccoli cheddar soup. It was thick, not too flavorful. The Caesar salad as the side was actually very large, but just DRENCHED in dressing. I couldn't finish it because every leaf was just smothered and I couldn't take it anymore.  I have to make sure to not other that again."
Aaron M.,"Anaheim, CA",3,17,13,1.0,10/31/2015,"Worst service ever! Came in for breakfast, placed our order and 30 minutes later the food comes out and it's the wrong order. Another 15 minutes later our food finally arrives and it's cold. Ridiculous! No apology or anything from staff."
Vickie B.,"Murrieta, CA",99,103,609,5.0,12/17/2015,Always great service when Taylor serves us at the bar!!  She makes the best Lemon drop martinis ever!! Thanks for always making us feel so special!
Anomoly S.,"La Habra, CA",88,38,127,4.0,10/7/2014,"If you have been to one then you know what this is. Most things are decent on the menu nothing really or if this world... Except dessert.  The pazookie is often imitated never duplicated. Fresh baked with vanilla bean ice cream. They have many different flavors now but I usually stick with the original chocolate chip. Big enough for two but often eaten by one. If you have six or more go for the party platter.  They also have a new s'mores chocolate, peanut butter, roasted marshmallows and vanilla bean ice cream.  Overall worth the visit."
Lou S.,"Temecula, CA",42,90,79,1.0,8/20/2015,"This BJs location is officially black listed.  Their craft beer can no longer compensate for the poorly managed kitchen and subpar customer service.    I have been a repeat customer to this location since it opened, never again. Management can message me via Yelp if they wish to discuss where they are failing."
D L.,"San Diego, CA",0,36,,5.0,2/27/2017,Came in last Thursday and the service was excellent and the food was very good. Thank you BJ's for a great lunch. We will be back.
A L.,"Temecula, CA",42,29,15,4.0,8/26/2016,It taste like BJ's Nicole was are server and she did a decent job. The ambience is dark we have plenty of customers in the restaurant.
Grant S.,"Temecula, CA",3,31,6,3.0,6/5/2015,You know all I have to say is when you come to a restaurant a servers job is know take the order and then serve it. How many times do we have to have our food auctioned off? And you want a 20% tip! REALLY! If I want to get the service right maybe I need to get on the schedule! Then we ate with our fingers ( never received silverware) 4 different people bringing our food. Damn where are all the people that want to work. Back in the day my wife could handle a bar with a 10 top. It takes 6 people and I still don't have silver ware. Good thing my jeans need to get washed I used my pants to wipe my hands! At least Xavier took care of us.
Odie O.,"San Diego, CA",2,1003,63,2.0,6/9/2015,"Filthy, filthy, filthy on a Monday night not busy but trash on every corner of the floors of this entire place including the bathrooms which needed the sinks scrubbed, paper towels, tidied up, looked like a nightclub bathroom, ew. Staff was nice, food was just ok. My Mac and cheese was very dry and chewy from the broiler, no sauce at all just oil."
Yesenia F.,"San Diego, CA",16,51,17,2.0,4/5/2016,"I have gone here many times, but last week was probably the worst service i ever got. Came in and this girl seated us right away. Was not a busy night and we came in probably around 9pm, took 25 minutes to get our drinks and by that time we knew what to order. We got one pizookie cause i lost my appetite that took another 20 minutes to make. Afterwards it took almost 30 minutes to get our check. This waiter kept walking pass us, very upset about this BJs. I was there for more than hour for one cookie."
Tara B.,"Fallbrook, CA",25,72,12,2.0,5/1/2016,"Last time here I said I wasn't coming again. Then, someone gave us a gift card, so we had to come back. Please no one give us any more gift cards! The food is impressive and the device is less than lackluster. They were busy, but not overly so. I'm just over paying money for subpar food and service at restaurants. I will stay at home and cook my own food to my liking and then I will have nobody to complain to, but myself."
Jason L.,"Temecula, CA",97,2,,5.0,8/19/2016,"The best bartender in all of Southern California works here!!  Taylor is incredible, if you want a great time having a beer or two, come to BJ's Temecula. This Woman Rocks!!!!!!"
Randy C.,"Temecula, CA",43,23,2,5.0,1/17/2017,"Had a fantastic birthday dinner with my family.  Using their app to order ahead for dine-in worked way better than expected.  When we arrived we showed the hostess the confirmation code from the app and we were seated within 5 minutes.  Drinks arrived swiftly and food magically showed up.  Paid the check with the app as well.  It was really nice to just show up, sit down, relax, socialize and eat.  Food was fresh and delicious.  Staff were very friendly and super efficient.  Drinks refilled before we had to ask.  Thanks to the team at BJ's for a great night out."
Heath M.,"San Marcos, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/9/2017,I probably go here to much but I can never get too much of a Jeremiah Red beer for some reason. Probably my all time 2nd favorite beer. I usually pair this the ribeye. Nothing like a delicious steak and cold beer to wash it down with. Highly recommend. The staff in my experience have also been rely attentive but that maybe because I come too often and they know the family. J/k
Rosielle A.,"Murrieta, CA",30,31,5,4.0,9/19/2015,"When I got there, I told the receptionist that I had a reservation, but when she checked the computer she said that she didn't have any reservation under my name. I told her that I had made the reservation online the day before, but still she didn't find anything. But I called my cousin, who was there 15 minutes before my brother and I got there, and it turned out that they already found a table outside.  Onto the good stuff... My cousins, brother, and I went here yesterday to celebrate my brothers 21st birthday. All in all, our experience wasn't too bad. I kind of felt bad for our waitress (Leila) and how she kept on apologizing to us about having to wait a while for our drinks, menu, etc. because it was so busy, but we didn't mind at all because it didn't really seem like we were waiting too long.  Anyways, Leila was very attentive and was always checking up on how we were doing and/or we needed a refill. She's friendly and was also helpful with giving my brother some tips when it came to drinks/drinking. Thanks for also taking our group picture :) Btw, the food was great! We ordered the crispy calamari (I always order the calamari whenever I go to BJ's). We also got the chicken bacon ranch, sweet pig, barbecue chicken, and the buffalo chicken pizza. Out of all of the pizzas we ordered, I think the unanimous favorite was the barbecue chicken pizza (we had to order another batch of barbecue chicken pizza.. AHAHA!) Other than the wait for our drinks and food, which we really didn't mind, the only complaint my cousins and I had was the lighting outside. We had a hard time reading our menu and differentiating which pizza was which."
Brandi W.,"Temecula, CA",17,29,65,3.0,10/24/2015,"Went with my hubby & sister. Once we got there, we asked the hostess if they could change the tv to the football game; every other channel was on the baseball game so we figured changing ONE tv wouldn't be a problem. About five minutes into us watching football, the tv is changed back to the baseball game. To make a long, ridiculous story short, some couple who wasn't even aware that the game was on, but were instead sucking face, complained that they were there first so they should be allowed to watch the baseball game. You know, because the other 12 tvs showing it wasn't enough.  Anyway--big ups to the server(s) who apologized, moved us, and found the football  game on the tv towards the back (where we wanted to be seated to begin with). It was a nice gesture and everyone was content. The complaining couple continued to suck face.  Food was ok--the burger was well done when I requested mid rare. However, the wings & mozz sticks were good as usual so no complaints there. We might go back..."
Jose G.,"Murrieta, CA",373,574,1354,4.0,8/24/2012,"If you're looking for a great place for a birthday dinner, BJ's is a favorite because of it's free pizookie! So I decided to come in a few days ago to get ready for my 21st... Got my California Chicken sandwich order messed up a little bit, but I think what was more important was how they handled it. But needless to say, they really did take care of it.  So kudos to BJ's and their management for treating their customers right!"
