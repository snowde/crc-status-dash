Natalia C.,"Sun City, CA",0,6,1,2.0,11/8/2015,Food is great. Always enjoy the clam chowder and salad however I ordered a drink and it is awful!!!! I ordered an old fashioned and it tastes like water. Pretty obvious that it is either watered down or made poorly because it is supposed to be a bolder drink. I'll probably never order another drink here. I've had friends complain about the same thing and I would highly recommend you spending ur money on actual drinks from a place that isn't stingy and doesn't suck ass  But once again food:good  Service: sub-par  Alcoholic drinks: no
Eric S.,"Wildomar, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/2/2016,"Went here with my family for my birthday and everything started out okay . When the food finally came out one of the plates was missing some ingredients , and another plate came out when everyone was done already.  The manager didn't say anything.  This place is a joke this is not the first time this has happened at this location.  They definitely need to pick up on the customer service skills. The manager is a complete joke and doesn't deserve the spot he is in . I will most likely not come back to this one as there is plenty of other places to eat in Temecula."
Jess D.,"Temecula, CA",10,16,13,4.0,6/17/2016,"We were there June 15, 2016.  We had the avocado egg roll.  It was good.  The server was super good.  He was so nice & attentive.  He's the type that a resto should have.  Excellent customer service!  BJ Temecula is always great compare to other location."
Joseph F.,"Elizabeth, NJ",126,8,5,5.0,1/11/2016,"My 5 stars review is referring strictly to the Pizookie, which is a deep dish cookie crowned with vanilla ice cream. From peanut butter to salted caramel the spectrum of flavors is almost overwhelming. If you're looking for a unique desert experience that will tantalize your tastebuds the Pizookie is for you."
Cat L.,"Murrieta, CA",0,30,19,3.0,5/15/2015,Average. Nothing incredible. Very expensive. Wait time is quick But it is like every other BJ's chain. They also could use a menu change..
Nicole T.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,1,5,1.0,1/6/2017,"Wow...waited FOREVER for a table. They finally seat us, and lord behold...I count 8 open tables...they sit us down and table is dirty, has crumbs and is wet. ..We wait for waiter, and waited. ..so we just moved ourself to another CLEAN table....very disappointed. ...."
Medea D.,"Temecula, CA",215,8,25,5.0,8/28/2015,Our server Matthew was awesome this evening. A real gentleman Who Delivered Awesome service. We had never been here before this evening and we know for sure we will be coming back again in the future. Thank you Matthew and the staff of Bj's!!!
Michael A.,"Aguanga, CA",28,4,,4.0,12/27/2015,Excellent burgers....best I've had in awhile.  Wait staff very attentive and courteous.  Waitresses are ridiculously gorgeous as well  Good vibes
Jasa S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",56,128,119,5.0,3/11/2014,"Our server was very friendly and attentive, he had a great sense of humor so me and my boyfriend were always smiling and laughing :-) definite plus.  The food was delicious. We both had pizza. My boyfriend had the BBQ chicken pizza and I opted for the gluten free thin crust cheese pizza, really happy about that option, also you can add toppings of your choice for only a 1$ extra. I got grilled chicken on mine. I was a tad disappointed that spinach isn't an option, but that in no way had taken away from the amazingness of my pizza.  Will definitely go back, and definitely recommend :-)"
Angelo F.,"Chula Vista, CA",1831,466,1591,4.0,9/17/2012,"If the food was bad, the service alone would easily get three stars on its own!  Thankfully, the food was great! I came here for a suprise party for my cousin and when family is involved, that means a lot of kids.  We were seated in the open area towards the lot.  There were 18 adults and 9 kids.  The kids had their own booth and that means a hot mess waiting to happen!  Our waitress was awesome!  She was patient, diligent and attentive.  Not an easy task when you have adult and kid accomodations to worry about. She was on point.  Sorry I forgot her name but hopefully 20% gratuity shows our gratitude.  Gourmet Mac & Cheese: Ohhh emmm geeee!  This was rediculously good!  It was thick, creamy and just had a bold cheesy flavor!  This should be served in a bigger plate!   Crispy Calamari:  Good!  Not the best Ive had but it holds its own.  The pieces were good in size.  The crisp was there.  And what I liked most was that it wasn't too oily.  The lemon aioli is a perfect sauce for it! BJ's Classic Combo Pizza: My favorite pizza from here.  Im a carnivore and the more meats on a pizza, the better.  This had pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.  Crust was thick and crispy.  Toppings were plentiful.  All around good pizza."
Kazandra P.,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",328,13,,5.0,10/9/2016,I really like this place travis (works in the bar) he was really cool. He gave us great service. i would come back and bring my whole fam
Mojgan S.,"Temecula, CA",1,4,,1.0,7/24/2016,"I came with my family to celebrate my fathers birthday, and we usually come here for birthdays, the night was going okay, but our sever JADE was taking very long to bring our drinks, waited at least 10mins and it wasn't even busy, then she told us that we always have birthdays like no shit when we come here it's cause it's someone's birthday but she made it seem like we were lying!! After that it just went down hill she would talk to the other severs and then they would give us dirty looks whenever they passed by! So immature, we just wanted to leave but JADE was no where to be found and seemed to ignore us, my father had to ask another sever just to get our bill and that sever told us she had to look for our sever! So that took awhile! I'm not coming here again fuck that!"
Gabe P.,"Temecula, CA",953,290,3651,5.0,3/2/2015,Was very happy  with  my experience. The food and  the service was great  didn't  order anything  fancy. I just got a burger but the burger was nice and tender with lots of flavor and the french fries  are good also.
Morgan G.,"Winchester, CA",27,175,23,4.0,1/26/2015,"We've been here twice now since moving to the area...for some reason people continue to give us gift cards....oh well. While the food is absolutely standard BJ's, this staff has it down. Let's be honest, not a lot of people get stoked on waiting tables, but on both trips we got individuals who seemed like they just wont the lottery being able to help us.  Incredibly helpful with menu selections, more than accommodating when we didn't know what we wanted to drink...no hint of annoyance at all. Hell, I was annoyed with us not being able to choose. Maybe people in Temecula are just happier? who knows...all that matters is we were very happy w/ the service we got, and if we get another gift card in the future, you better believe we won't use it at any other location but this one. Good Job."
Jen E.,"Temecula, CA",0,10,,5.0,12/7/2016,"Karlee was absolutely amazing! The service was exceptional and very attentive. Karlee was prompt, courteous, and very helpful. We love Bjs and we are a frequent customer because of the staff. The food is always consistent and good quality. They are a very family friendly environment which we enjoy. We can't wait to see everybody we have come to know and love, Karlee, Priscilla, Page, Evan, Jade and Nicole !!"
G S.,"Temecula, CA",4,22,,1.0,7/24/2016,"If I could give it no stars I would...the service sucks! And JADE the waitress is a bad-mannered, barbarian,and insulting b&@ch and so is the other girls working that night I went. Why?, first of all I came with my family to Celebrate my dads b-day, we order our food got it, then we say it's my dad's b-day and Jade the waitress says "" oh really you seem to have a lot of b-days.."" First of all WTF who do u think you are saying it's not his b-day you never been our waitress we don't even know you!, but anyways she leaves and we get the b-day thing  for my dad.. But her and the other girl workers, one with red and some other ones were no lie standing by their computer staring at us! So not obvious.Then were just sitting and waiting for jade to come and give our check but she wouldn't even come! She would go to other tables help them wouldn't even look our way. Then would go into the kitchen. After 15 mins later we ask another girl to get our check, and she said she'll call jade to get it, who took her sweet @ss time, we finally got. But in the end she ruined our night and it was terrible service and I'm not coming back because of JADE and other girls. BJs get some well mannered women who are respectful!....thanks a lot for nothing."
Sydney H.,"Wildomar, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/8/2017,"Went here for my graduation dinner. I was very excited to eat here with my family because I loved this place. My family and I were greeted by two of the RUDEST hostesses in the world. I was Astonished that they thought their behavior was okay. They told us a party of ten would be a 2 hour wait. So we called ahead for a party of six and a party of four. No problems there, except when we actually got there. We simply asked ""how long is the wait for a party of ten now?"" They told us two hours. We said ""alright well how long for the reservation for six we called in?"" The hostesses immediately got snarky, ""well six or ten?"" She said in an annoyed tone. ""Six"" replied my father. She told us the wait for six would be 30 to 40 minutes. ""Okay great, so can we seated next to the party of four that we also called in. We don't need to be at the same table but can we be seated at a table next to theirs?"". The hostesses got angry and said no. Well I don't see what the big deal is! How hard is it to have people sit at tables next to each other!? The other hostess then told us she WON'T sit us next to each other. She had a horrible tone in her voice as she refused to sit is next to each other. All she had to do was explain in a calm tone that she couldn't do this, instead she raised her voice and rollers her eyes at us. We were appalled by the rudeness of these two blonde hostesses. The first hostess then turned her face and laughed at us. That's right she laughed at us. Not like a giggle, a full on series of laughs. What a rude rude lady. We will never ever be returning to the temecula Bj's on Ynez road. We will also be calling the big boss and letting him know that these hostesses think laughing at their customers and yelling at them is okay. We will never ever be returning here. My entire family was disgusted with your horrible service! I will post this review everywhere that I can. I want people to know that this restaurant hires rude hostesses that apparently don't know how to do there job. Thank goodness for Macaroni grill. They were so so polite and gave us such amazing service. When they heard how Bj's treated us they were appalled and made sure to treat us way better than Bj's had ever treated us. I hope those two hostesses at Bj's get set straight because it is never okay to laugh at your customers in their face and yell at them. NOT OKAY. I strongly recommend that no one eats here ever again unless you are okay will horrible treatment!"
Amanda M.,"Fullerton, CA",322,58,57,2.0,4/16/2015,"We had a larger party for my cousins birthday and it wasn't that great of an experience. The mixed drinks were probably the best part of the night. Most of our orders were wrong, we waited forever for our food, and the food wasn't that great when we did get it. If your celebrating with a larger groups, I wouldn't recommend going here. Maybe you will have  a better experience if you go with a smaller group."
Tara J.,"Murrieta, CA",135,6,,1.0,4/16/2016,"Used the app to add name to waitlist....wait time was 35 min...showed up with 10 min still remaining, checked in.  Staff said I had a 45 min wait because a lot of people came in and we're put on the list ahead of me....what is the purpose of being able to call ahead/use the app if your name isn't added to the list until you check in at the desk!!! Host staff was rude and said I should have showed up earlier and my name would have been higher on the list!!! Wasn't going to wait 1hr+ to be seated (party of 3), so we left.    Called to ask a ""supervisor"" how their call ahead/app waitlist works and was told that they can't ""confirm"" your waitlist until you physically arrive.   Glad I decided not to place my order through the app as well, can't see how that is beneficial if you can't even really be on the waitlist until you are physically present in the restaurant."
Kansas S.,"Murrieta, CA",4,3,,4.0,8/28/2015,"We come to this BJs often. While every experience hasn't always been top notch, the managerial staff is amazing. They have always responded promptly and properly to any feedback we give in the surveys after (we're rewards members and get one usually after every visit.) I never feel like we are just sending surveys to an abyss! We love the pizza and it makes an easy date night since we have a baby and don't like to be gone too long. We love Phillip and request his section if he is working. I do wish corporate would bring back the Cobb salad as that was our favorite and we miss it! Great location and we love coming here."
