Martha E M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,17,4,2.0,3/17/2016,"I do want to say that their food is delicious. Good size servings and their pear cider is amazing. But, I do wish that they would bring out everyones food all at once, or at least within a close time frame. My parents, my aunt and uncle, and my husband and I came here on Valentine's Day to have dinner. The wait time was about 5 minutes which was great. We ordered our food and they first brought out my mom's and my dad's salads. About 6 minutes later they brought my uncle's potato soup. Several minutes later they brought two entrees and our wings, and it continued that way until everything was brought out. But the last thing that was brought out was my mom's steak. It looked like a rock on a big plate. Even though it was delicious, the presentation was HORRIBLE. I would suggest to maybe serving the salad together with the steak on the same plate to make it look a little nicer. I did post a picture of my mother's plate by the way."
Linda S.,"Beaumont, CA",2,16,3,5.0,8/8/2015,We're looking for a restaurant that I can eat at again my MSG allergies and we stopped at BJ's Restaurant in Temecula and it was very very good they even had Atlantic salmon and they had three homemade  dressings  they actually cooked my brown rice n and my salmon and another one with great asparagus can't recommend it enough also Stacy was our waitress was very very helpful was 100 questions also Juana the manager was just very patient and kind with my question my husband enjoyed his usual decadent dinner of fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy which she said was one of the best he's ever had I also like it here because even though there's some noise there's not tons of noise was very pleasant meal. Nice people
Jacqueline C.,"Bakersfield, CA",0,11,2,5.0,4/24/2016,Come here as often as I can. They never disappoint me. Always friendly service and great food no matter who you order. The beer menue is awesome and love the deserts.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhma K.,"San Diego, CA",0,11,4,5.0,9/9/2015,"Once a week me and my friends would dine in for their late happy hour and order our usual strawberry mojito, wings & corn fritters. Love this place .. their corn fritters are to die for !"
Jenylyn C.,"Murrieta, CA",62,28,110,3.0,12/28/2014,"I know Saturdays can be busy, but the server we had didn't seem to cope with it too well. There was a lack in service courtesy. The Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon I ordered was ok. The salmon itself was fine but the cous cous seemed overdone and the asparagus wasn't cooked enough. My husband asked for medium with his burger and he got well done borderline crispy. The calamari appetizer was good and the pizookie with vanilla bean ice cream were the highlights of our visit."
Jeannine C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,6,1,5.0,5/6/2016,My husband and I love coming here . Food is really good and my husband loves the beer selection . Costumer service is always great.
Ivan T.,"Temecula, CA",73,7,4,5.0,12/27/2014,"Came into BJS tonight and everything was delicious. Walked through the door the hostess was nice and greeted us with a smile. The wait was 25 mins I believe it was less than that. The food was great had a BBQ chicken pizza, the dough was nice and fluffy. The service was outstanding, our server Marina helped me pick out some craft beer."
Renee A.,"Murrieta, CA",112,2,1,2.0,3/28/2016,"Service was horrible, I will never go to this BJs again. Lazy Servers  not friendly ."
T T.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,1.0,12/13/2015,"The red headed hostess was very rude seating us down. I'm a hostess myself and I know how to properly greet people as we are the first impression of the restaurant. From the moment we walked in, I could tell she had an attitude and the way she said ""enjoy"" with a hint of sarcasm. Not professional at all."
Kim R.,"Irvine, CA",182,167,108,4.0,9/16/2014,"I honestly love coming here! Their food always tastes great and their prices are pretty decent. I also like coming here for their tvs and bar to catch the game.  I would say though that their portions during their lunch specials are pretty small. I got their flatbread and salad combo for $8 and I was still hungry after! I mean it tasted good but there was so little of it. I am neither a very large person nor do I eat a lot, so that says something. Other than that, their dinner portions are fine so give this place a shot."
Darnell C.,"Wildomar, CA",0,14,,5.0,4/17/2016,So went here again recently.  Twice back to back days and they still dont disappoint. I honestly want to give a shout out to Phil and Audrey. They are two waiters who are nothing but amazing. (Both are at the temecula location). They are very attentive but never overbearing.  They are always around or watching you from a far. Love them! Request their section anytime uou are there if you want great service!  The jambalaya is the best dish that bj's has to offer in my opinion.  It is to die for. Great portion and tremendous flavor. You just cant go wrong. I love the bj's royal soda. Its a mixed drink. It's strong with a little sweetness to it. Perfect for anytime!  Bj's temecula is the hangout!
Henry A.,"Murrieta, CA",0,2,,4.0,4/14/2016,Always have loved BJ's no pun intended lol but it's a great place too get beer and hang out with friends. Of course you can always expect the food too be good as well. Oh and that pizookie is straight fire! Would reccomend
Fred C.,"Temecula, CA",1,25,,2.0,3/13/2016,BJ's has gone downhill. The last time I was there it took me thirty minutes to get someone's attention to take our drink order. The food was mediocre. BJ's used to be my go-to place. No more.
Lindsey S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,5,,5.0,4/10/2016,Great service. Great food. Great ambiance. Never been disappointed at this location. The food comes out fast and the wait staff is always great and very friendly!
Maddy K.,"San Diego, CA",0,25,11,5.0,8/6/2016,Awesome food.  Great service.  Very friendly staff    Love the atmosphere and love sitting in the bar area for a big game.
Mike M.,"Torrance, CA",64,39,5,3.0,1/4/2016,BJ's is a very good for food and beer. The ONLY reason for three stars is this location's paucity of parking. It is hard to enjoy a meal when you are aggravated by the lack of parking. All you look forward to is the LONG hike at the end of your meal. Not the makings for an enjoyable night out. This location SERIOUSLY needs to provide a valet
Veronica R.,"Murrieta, CA",3,23,1,2.0,10/28/2015,"Ok, so I love the food at BJ'S, but not when you pay $16 for a salad that contains half rotten lettuce. I ordered their Ahi Tuna salad which is normally very tasty, but today it was horrible. Worst part is, I ordered it to go, so I couldn't even take it back. I think the chef needs to take more pride in the food theh serve their customers. The last time I came to this BJ'S, my boyfriend had a piece of glass in his Cesar Salad...so I'm not sure what goes on with their lettuce :("
Vee P.,"Hermosa Beach, Los Angeles, CA",3,13,4,5.0,10/23/2014,"Finally a BJ's near my house that has great customer service... Well at least my waiter, Cody, was GREAT!!!  I've been to a few BJ's restaurant's near my area but yesterday night my friend and I decided to give this specific location a shot since the last one we went to (near Menifee) had the WORST customer service the last few times we dinned in.  I don't leave too many reviews but I was pleased to leave this one for Cody since he went way above and beyond our expectations of what GOOD customer service is. Honestly I almost gave up on BJ's  restaurant's all together. So thank you Cody for changing the crazy idea that I had about BJ's and treating us with exceptional customer service!"
Sarah H.,"Menifee, CA",77,140,91,5.0,12/21/2015,"Came to this location last night with my friend got drinks, appetizers, and desert. We sat at the bar and the bartender named Tommy helped us. I ordered a white peach margarita but a Cadillac margarita version. It was delicious! We also got a chocolate chip pizookie and the spinach/artichoke dip. Everything tasted amazing and we had excellent service from Tommy. I'll definitely be back at this location when I'm in Temecula."
Brittney S.,"Murrieta, CA",120,116,124,1.0,10/26/2015,"I was really craving some chicken tortilla soup last night and I was told the BJs had the best.  I've never had the greatest experiences but thought I'd give them a try since it had been a few years since my last visit. And of course I was disappointed once again. The soup came out luke warm and when we told the server she said she have them ""warm it back up."" Which assumed to me they just popped it in the microwave...gross. And yet again it still wasn't hot like a soup should be. Our server seemed to be very irritated with is especially since we had a gift card and didn't know the amount on it. Anyways...once again learned my lesson and will not be returning."
