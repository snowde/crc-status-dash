Stacey C.,"Cerritos, CA",50,68,3,5.0,4/5/2016,My kids and I were here last night. We had a great time with our server Melissa. I dont know her last name but she was amazing! Their service is typically OK thats why we don't go but this time we had a blast and she was awesome. If you want great service and a fun person ask for Melissa.
Erin M.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,1.0,11/3/2015,"Used to be a regular family dining favorite for us.  After visiting 11/1/15, I don't think we'll return.  They were running a new ""test menu"" which did not include many our favorite items.  The service was NOT good. We sat staring at our food for sometime waiting for utensils. We were a party of six and one of the main entrees was not brought out.  Service had already been so bad, we decided to not say anything to see if the MIA entree would appear on the bill.  Sure enough it was on the bill!!!!!  The server had no clue it never came out and was shocked when we asked for the item to be removed from the bill.  Thankfully, our friend was not that hungry and was fine with the side salad.  Not impressed with the new menu.  How can you remove a cobb salad from a menu?"
Bryan R.,"Temecula, CA",1,5,,1.0,5/16/2015,"After a 20min wait for a waiter to come ask for our drink order, I realized that the restaurant was only 1/5 full... After 40 mins of waiting for my chicken ceaser salad, they brought me a small ceaser salad no chicken... 2 mins later a chicken ceaser salad. I tasted it and realized I've had better salads at Mc Donald's. The salad was yellow the chicken was stale, I was almost doubting that it could have been worse. I love BJ's, just not this one."
Kendra J.,"Upland, CA",64,131,113,5.0,7/18/2015,"We really like this location. Servers are always nice and try their hardest to be on top of everything even though they can get really busy. Food is great, drinks are awesome. We wish they had energy drinks for Jaeger Bombs, we'd go weekly if they did. Kids love it here! They always run specials for their club members."
Jessica N.,"Moreno Valley, CA",19,5,3,5.0,3/7/2015,"I had a fantastic experience at this Bjs! The staff was friendly and the manager, Juanna even came by and made sure we were taken care of. I tried the Beignet dessert at her recommendation and it did not disappoint. Plus, her butt is amazing and it has inspired me to go back to the gym! Thank you bjs!"
Keel S.,"Fallbrook, CA",48,4,2,2.0,9/7/2015,"First off service was great got us seated pretty quickly got our order quickly,on the other hand, the kitchen staff may need to be retrained.The food was very poorly seasoned my medium steak I ordered was extremely tough I didn't know whether to get ready to eat or get ready to fight the steak. I usually have a great experience at BJs but unfortunately this was one of those bad experience."
Amanda O.,"Fair Oaks, CA",264,163,48,4.0,7/5/2015,"I love the fried artichoke appetizer. It's always good. The pizza is great, I've never been disappointed. Drinks can be a bit pricy. I've never had bad service here."
Michael S.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,2,4.0,6/22/2016,"Came here for lunch today with my girlfriend we got two entrees and one appetizer. Waitress was extremely friendly and on point with refills and everything. We got potato skins as an appetizer and two sandwiches, food was good nothing spectacular. great service and good food!"
Brenda B.,"Temecula, CA",24,23,3,4.0,7/23/2012,"My man loves this place. ""It's been too long since I've had BJs!"" he likes to fancy saying.  That said, we've been here a few times. I can't say I really recall the times prior to this last one over the weekend-- it always struck me as just another one of your chain sports bars but with a slightly more put together appeal. Their menu is giant. This could be a bad thing because you get so lost in it, and I much prefer my restaurants to stick to a smaller menu of amazing dishes than a large one of just so-so. So far, though, I've not gotten anything I didn't like. Counting my calories at 1,500 a day for the last few weeks is not my idea of fun, but my jeans are thanking me. Going out to eat is another matter, with delicious tempting entrees that are easily over 1,000 calories alone. BJs, though, has an Enlightened menu, so I decided to give that a try. I ordered the a pint of Lightswitch Light Lager, 135 calories. I love my beer, especially my high, high calorie hoppy beer, so I didn't expect much here. It was light, cold and fresh-- perfect for a Saturday afternoon. I also ordered the Enlightened chicken tacos with black beans for lunch-- 511 calories. It was very good. Three cute little tacos with chicken, cabbage and carrots and a bowl of black beans with a few measly corn chips stuck into it. Doesn't sound too good, does it? But it was very delicious and filling. The flavors were spot on. Saturday afternoon was incredibly busy, but we were seated promptly. The waitress was pretty decent, too. They have a new points system where you get 1 point for $1-- I'll have to bring the kids next time!"
Kristin O.,"Whittier, CA",219,29,,2.0,3/13/2015,"Lied about wait time, supposed to be 20 mins but waited for over an hour. Food was decent but not worth it. Would not recommend."
Vikki C.,"Murrieta, CA",181,102,37,5.0,5/15/2015,This place is so good!!! I always leave super full! Try the beet salad and the peanut butter s'mores pizookie! OMG!
Ethan S.,"Temecula, CA",65,173,188,5.0,3/27/2015,Amazing pizza and salad I usually go with the deep dish or a burger witch I love but I'm on a diet so we went with a thin crust pizza and a salad and man was i surprised !!! 5 starts all day
Diane K.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/1/2015,Unfortunately family ate here but 3 had food poison. Ruined my grandkids Halloween. Use to be our favorite restaurant! Please yelp if anyone else got sick 10/31/15.
Eileen T.,"San Diego, CA",293,190,215,2.0,11/12/2013,"Came here with my boyfriend and his group of friends after an event in Perris. We all come from the southern part of San Diego which is about an 1 hr and a half away. Fortunately this restaurant is open late and on the way back home.  My friends and I ordered food. We waited approximately 20 mins before the food was served to us. However, all but one person did not have food served in front of him. The server came out, apologized and said she made a mistake. She put in the order but my friend had to wait for another 20 mins for his fried meat and veggies. While he waited I offered him some of my food because I knew he was hungry. Finally his food arrived. When we got the bill, I expected that he would get a discount on his food since he waited for so long. Unfortunately, he did not. This is unacceptable. I've seen other restaurants give a small discount when they know the server was at fault.  If you know you made a mistake, try to fix it with a discount as it gives customers a reason to come back a second time."
Suzie K.,"Murrieta, CA",0,11,,1.0,8/23/2015,"Hard to give it even a one star despite the fact that wait staff are always friendly. Fish and chips arrived cold along with my fries despite the long wait. Burgers used to always be great, but my husband's was sub-par. Last couple of visits here have been very disappointing. Worst BJs ever. Sorry to say, but taking my business elsewhere."
Ryan H.,"San Diego, CA",32,13,,1.0,2/6/2015,It was my first time at bjs and did a call ahead seating they said it be about 30-40mins wait not a problem I get there they said another 20-30mins not a problem so I waited and 45mins went by I went in to ask how much longer and they didn't even put me down they said they put me down and the first table came open they would give to me. 4 groups of 2 and I ask why haven't we been seated yet they still didn't even put me down hour later I am pissed worst experience at bjs.
Jacob R.,"Winchester, CA",80,63,3,4.0,1/4/2014,"Love going here. For some reason my wife and I tend to go here when it's raining (subliminal or what??) My three favorites here: Spicy Spaghetti with Meatballs, Pepperoni Pizza on wheat and their California Chicken Sandwich. You can also usually be seated very quickly here compared to other restaurants near Promenade Mall. I've had a few issues with service in the past here (reason for the 4 star), but they've always taken care of us. Apparently, the kitchen has a lot of strife with their waiters (never a good thing). Be sure to get the pazookie for dessert. Can't go wrong."
J C.,"Murrieta, CA",5,45,14,4.0,5/4/2015,"This was our first time here. The staff was friendly from the moment we walked in. The wait was 45 minutes but we were seated in 20. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxed.  Matthew, our waiter, was EXCELLENT to say the least!!!! He was on point with drinks, never had an empty glass..  The calamari was good. Pizza & pizzookie were delish! Only thing we were not too fond of were the ribs.."
Murray G.,"Murrieta, CA",6,117,66,1.0,1/3/2015,"So I just called to make reservations for 7. My family wants to go there tonight. They told me that for 7 I would have to call 24 hours in advance. I reiterated that it was for tonight and the hostess reiterated her 24 hour rule. I asked if they were booked for 5pm and she said no so I asked if in thst case could I make the reservations. She once again reiterated the 24 hour rule. Sooooo, F. U. BJ's."
James S.,"Murrieta, CA",223,9,,4.0,7/19/2015,"Service was absolutely 5 stars. Our waitress was Priscilla, and she was absolutely amazing. She was very professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. Or bus boy (who's name I unfortunately didn't get the name of) was also exceptional and had a great sense of humor. I've been going to this BJ's for quite a while and I've enjoyed most things on the menu. Sadly, the burger I had tonight was burnt and so was the bun. The only other thing that I saw that gave it 4 stars was a waitress who's blouse was too tight and was very unprofessional. As a male, while it might be cute, it's not appropriate for an establishment like BJ's."
