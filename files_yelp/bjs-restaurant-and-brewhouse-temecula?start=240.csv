Sabrina B.,"Menifee, CA",0,7,,5.0,2/17/2015,"I love this place, my boyfriend and I always come here on our date nights! The Mediterranean tacos are my favorite. Also the mozzarella sticks, flat bread pizza, and of course their pizookies. Everything I've had here was good and the service has been on point every time."
Patty H.,"Fallbrook, CA",44,17,143,3.0,11/16/2014,"Food was good but the service was terrible. Came in on a Saturday afternoon in between lunch and dinner. The place was not packed at all. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. We ordered a large pizza, a bowl of soup and a wedge salad. The soup came out first, 5 minutes later the pizza came out and after asking twice about the salad it finally came out 10 minutes later. We had no silverware or napkins on the table, so we had to wait a couple more minutes for that before we could start eating. The waiter never asked how we were doing and walked by a couple of times leaving empty drinks on the table. It wasn't until we were done eating that our drinks finally were refilled. I visited another BJs a few months before and we experienced the same poor customer service. I love the food but the customer service is really steering me away from eating here again."
Kendall D.,"Andover, NH",1018,338,257,1.0,7/3/2013,"Not often am I compelled to write a 1 star review, but I was pushed to the point of no return! First off we get here and we get seated right away which was great! In fact it was the only good thing that happened before the ridiculous mudslide of shit that followed. I ordered a cheeseburger and it took thirty plus minutes to arrive, then pile onto that the fact that it had no cheese, in fact there was nothing on it but lettuce... Da fuk?? It was disgusting. I had three bites and pushed it aside, I was tired, still hungry, and at this point I just wanted to get the check and leave. But getting the check would require having a waiter who was around. Waiting just fuelled my hate fire for this particular BJ's, but I decided to just let it go and pay for my food that I absolutely hated so we could just leave. I give them my card to pay for my ""cheeseburger"" and when he brings the check back I notice $45.00 was charged to my card. At this point I was now tired, hungry, angry and broke.  So thank you, I never in my life thought I would say that I hate BJ's... Pun fully intended... But you have brought the words right out of me!"
Daniel C.,"San Francisco, CA",6,9,1,3.0,12/21/2014,"The food was pretty good, that's why it has 3 starts. The service however, is a different story. I won't go on just to say that the service was not smooth. It just took a little more time to get our food and desserts. There was lack of communication between the waiters. The place is nice though! But they could work on their service (: Other than that, it was a good environment and the food was was 4 out of 5 stars."
Jhermie S.,"Temecula, CA",0,5,1,1.0,4/3/2016,Worst service ever!! Waited 1.5 hours for a mini pizza and pasta for my baby. People who showed up after us already had their food and left. Then we decided to get our food to go because my baby was getting fussy and  we didn't want to wait anymore..still screwed up the order so we had to drive back for the side order that was missing!!
Vanessa G.,"Temecula, CA",2,24,,4.0,3/27/2015,"It takes a lot to get 5 stars outta me, so giving this restaurant 4 stars is at least an A! Friendly greetings the moment you step thru the door.   Seated right away as my hubby and I were there for an early mid-week dinner.  We sat in the bar, (it was happy hour) usually I tend to feel guilty for sitting in the bar to have dinner because I feel like I'm making the bartender work harder by leaving the drinking customers to tend to dining customers.  Anyway...service was great!  Our server had a great sense of humor and tended to each whim promptly.  Food was good, not much different than Applebee's, just slight twitches to each dish set them apart.  The atmosphere is what I believe makes it just a bit nicer, dining wise.  I think any guy could feel quite comfortable taking a date to BJs Restaurant or even my hubby of 31years for any meal they serve.  Menu consists of Beef, Chicken or Seafood.  Chin chin!"
Samantha M.,"Carlsbad, CA",178,19,4,1.0,10/30/2014,"Our very young waitress smirked at us when we requested a gluten free menu (I have a severe gluten allergy)...so the smirk isn't necessary young girl. After 15 min, she came back without a menu and asked if we needed more time...I had to get a menu from the front because she neglected to remember that simple request. We ended up leaving before ordering. Definitely a bad experience when you wait 10 min for a waitress to show up and another 15 for a menu that never comes.  Won't be coming back again."
JR R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,100,,5.0,3/27/2016,"Went in to celebrate my aunts, cousins and sisters birthday, as well as my wife and my 40th anniversary. Brisket burgers a real hit, Asian salad very good, pita not so, kind of dry and tasteless. Our server was Paige, and she comped us 4 desserts. She was great and we all appreciated her service. Wish they did lunch specials 7 days a week, as there are some nice selections not on regular menu. All in all a great experience, thanks especially to Paige."
Carmina I.,"Winchester, CA",0,32,17,5.0,4/24/2015,"Not too long of a wait for food on a Friday night ! Great service , the only thing id say is that they no longer have red velvet pizookies and I was hoping to get one, after not going here for a while. :/"
Dana B.,"Menifee, CA",0,17,,1.0,8/2/2013,"I have had the worst experiences there. Some include not being ""waited"" on for over 30 minutes; not even asked for our drink order.... being told our pizza was given to another party at the bar (we had a half buffalo chix and half veggie - kind of odd that another party ordered the same thing) told them it was my husband's birthday - they did nothing...  The only good thing about that place is one waiter who has helped us on 2 occasions - when we weren't seated in his section - but he saw how we were getting more and more irrate so he assisted.  The owners of BJ's should really consider their trainings - the place would be great if the service was good."
Krista B.,"College Station, TX",0,22,9,4.0,7/17/2015,"Love coming here, great atmosphere! Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering a Spicy Pig Tavern Cut Pizza and while tasty, it definitely wasn't enough food for my family even with an appetizer and salads. Stick to the deep dish pizza! Otherwise food was yummy and service was good."
Andrea C.,"Westside, Las Vegas, NV",797,86,20,4.0,1/15/2015,Service wasn't that great but the bison Burger  was awesome. That's the only thing i have to say about this place
LeAnn R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,28,2,5.0,11/9/2013,"LOVE the food here!! And the staff- superb! Never had a bad experience at this BJ's (can't compare to Menifee)!  The Pazookis are to die for! Go on your birthday ;) And the root beer- I wish I could take some home!  The pizza is incredible! The atmosphere at this location took me a trip or two to get used to because it feels very open, but once you're seated and eating it's really fun. The wait staff is really friendly here and very good at what they do!!"
Amy Q.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",7,9,,4.0,2/24/2015,Miss Tayor you're amazing. Your positivity and sweet heart makes me come back. You are an asset to Bj's. Thank you for such kindness.
Marissa D.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",8,19,5,5.0,2/21/2015,"I experienced amazing service tonight at this BJ's location. We were told it'd be a 30-40 minute wait and were seated within 10 minutes. While we were waiting we were given complimentary slices of pizza to apologize for the wait. After being seated, we were swiftly taken care of. One of the members of our party had a slightly over cooked steak, but they kindly replaced it and even gave her an extra scoop mashed potatoes. Overall, this was the best experience I've had at not only any BJ's, but any restaurant period."
Nicole C.,"Chicago, IL",38,81,19,4.0,1/10/2015,"It's was your average BJs so we were happy enough. Beer is always great and we like the menu. The place was packed so we sat in the bar that had tons of open seating. Service was good, not lightning fast but not bad either. We'd go back for happy hour or lunch."
Mary H.,"Temecula, CA",7,65,9,2.0,9/5/2014,"Came here with my husband for dinner and really I think 2 stars may be generous.   We were told that we would have to wait ""about 15 minutes"" for a table for two.  This seemed reasonable to us, however after 20, 25, 30, 35 minutes we still weren't seated.  If we had the real waiting time we would have chosen another restaurant and visited this establishment at another time. We've been to the BJ's in Carlsbad a number of times and have never had a problem with our order.  However nothing in our order came out correctly.  Due to a food allergy that my husband has we were very clear about our questions about food preparation and ingredients.  Still, when we got both our appetizers and food there were ingredients that we asked to have kept off of our plates.  When we asked to have our order made over the waiter made it sound as though we had done something to the food ourselves to make it unacceptable.  My husband was able to have order something different however when they brought out his new plate (a pasta bowl) there was some kind of spicy seasoning in it that he reacted to.  The waiter came by to check on us after giving him his new plate and although we mentioned that my husband wasn't able to eat it due to the spicy seasoning, the waiter didn't offer to change it or take it off the bill and just take the plate back to the kitchen.  Typically we love the dessert at BJ's but due to our experience that night, we didn't want to even try that!  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in general is a good restaurant, but this particular location leaves much to be desired."
Jason H.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/15/2014,"I can summarize this place in one sentence. WHERE IS THE SERVICE?! I've given bj's plenty of chances but no matter how many times i've been the service is always terrible.  Every single time I've come here i have had to wait a ridiculous amount of time to receive any of my food, even appetizers.  The beer selection is decent but that is about all they have going for them. It seems no matter how busy or how empty the place is they just can't get the food to their customers in a timely manner. I have waited an hour for my food before from time of ordering. With all the similar brew house restaurants opening in town now i wouldn't be surprised to see bj's lose more and more business. Something's got to change."
George K.,"Temecula, CA",14,6,2,5.0,1/20/2015,"I've been in here many times, the food always perfect and delicious, the staff are very nice and welcoming.. highly recommended"
Trevor H.,"San Bernardino, CA",117,64,6,5.0,12/14/2014,The service was great and the food was good as well. Came in for a Pazookie (get your own!) and a couple beers.
