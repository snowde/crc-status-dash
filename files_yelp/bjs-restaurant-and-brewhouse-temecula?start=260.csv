Erin L.,"NJ, NJ",139,108,63,1.0,5/12/2013,"UNDER COOKED CHICKEN TO INFANT! HAIR IN BURGER! Need I say more. We came here today for Mothers Day, brunch/lunch with friends of ours. We had ordered our food & a kid meal, and asked for it to come out first. The soups and salads came, no kid meal, 10 minutes later no kids meal. Then another 10 minutes later, our lunches come, but NO kids meal. 5 minutes later the waitress shows up and said that the first one was under cooked and she was brining it back. Our son finally gets his chicken (dried out) kids meal. I go to take a bite of my Bison Burger, and feel something in my teeth, yup a CURLY BLACK HAIR about an inch & a half long. They did comp the hairy burger & under cooked chicken, we were still charged for everything else. We never really got an apology, just we will fix it in the back. Obviously they don't care. *Never brought our sons apple juice either. I will be advising my company who does catering from them (which we did every other week) to not go here or not going back to this location.  *Note I went to the bathroom and employee had used the bathroom, rinsed her hands with water and NO SOAP and then wiped them on her apron. Think about that next time you think you want to eat here.  I am very tempted to contact Public Health for Temecula/Riverside County."
Kirsten D.,"Encinitas, CA",19,35,1,2.0,1/20/2013,"What a SCAM... Chicago Faux Deep Dish Pizza...especially since they started in SANTA ANNA...??? The hostess was polite and sat us very quick for a party of seven; however, three of seven menus were full of food...GROSS The server was awesome. Jenn did a great job on time managment and we never felt rushed or neglected... With a restaurant with food runners/expeditors the food should come out all at once... AND SHOULD NOT BE COLD!!! CLAM CHOWDER - COLD, TWO PIZZAS - COLD, FRENCH FRYS - COLD !!!WT??? We told Jenn and she took care of it...The frys came out piping hot and the pizza was hot as well... The manager came over and made a few EXCUSES for the restaurant and took the clam choder off the bill... But this restaurant has very poor standards for quality food obviously...AND I DONT ESPECIALLY SINCE IM FROM CHICAGO..."
Andy C.,"Carlsbad, CA",193,1233,3341,4.0,12/8/2008,"I came here yesterday with a friend to have an early lunch on sunday. our server ashley was super nice and when she came around to take our order, I didn't know what I wanted to eat.  I came and she was able to give me the best and most delicious dishes in each section of the menu. I ordered the champagne shrimp pasta and wasn't interested in the shrimp so I ordered the chicken. They happily changed it and it was delicious. My friend ordered the Cajun pasta with blackened chicken and this is really delicious too. I'm not too much into the spicy foods, but this is good.  Make sure when you come to save room for dessert!!! You must order a poozokie dessert from here!!!! they are super delicious with a hot melting cookie with melting ice cream on top!!!!"
James M.,"Mountain Center, CA",431,108,45,4.0,10/21/2014,"Awesome setting , plenty of seating large bar and large tvs. Came for a quick lunch meal grabbed up the calamari for an app and bacon cheeseburger for entree. The calamari was cooked to perfection not chewy fresh fryer oil, burger was juicy bun was soft but crisp. Waitress was a sweetheart noticed I had a cold told me to get better. At the end ordered a pazookie just cause it makes everything better did half  chocolate chip half peanut butter. Great experience great service great food. I will be back !!"
Amy O.,"Temecula, CA",14,12,,4.0,1/10/2015,"The food is good, the service is good and the environment is fun! Good for a casual date night!"
Sonja B.,"Temecula, CA",6,22,1,3.0,8/12/2014,"I like the food but it's always so crowded!!! And takes awhile before you see your server. If it weren't for the baked potatoes, I would probably stay away."
Matt M.,"Temecula, CA",4,58,5,3.0,2/20/2013,"I'm giving this place 3 stars. The restaurant is very nice, good service and the beer was excellent. Best hefewiezen I've ever had. The only problem was the food. We ordered some hot wings as an appetizer. They were brought to our table about 2 minutes before our main course came. Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering an appetizer. The wings were served plain and the hot sauce was on the side. Very strange. Never had hot wings served like that before.  We ordered a large deep dish pizza with pepperoni and onions. This was the worst pizza we've ever had. The entire pizza had only 6 pepperonis on it, a few pieces of onion, maybe a tablespoon of sauce and very little cheese. There were several slices that were 100% plain!!!!!  $24 for a pizza and all we get is crust??  The slices that did have something on it had zero flavor. The waitress was embarrassed when she saw our pizza. The manager came over immediately and was very nice. We gave back the pizza minus the two slices we ate.  He removed the pizza from our bill and offered us another free pizza and dessert. We declined the free pizza because it was horrible but accepted the free dessert which was very good. I don't know about their other food, but stay away from the pizza!"
Christina N.,"Murrieta, CA",0,19,2,5.0,2/26/2016,I go here on a regular basis just because TAYLOR the bartender is amazing at her job! Her smile and customer service is what keeps me coming back and sitting at the bar only when she's working!!!!! Thank you
SuzAnne S.,"Howell, NJ",195,447,179,5.0,6/1/2011,"Here is the low down on BJ's in Temecula. If you dont like a long wait, have you thought of sitting at a table in the bar area? yes kids can sit there (see * below) and there is no waiting. :) A quick shout out to Kelsey our server in the BAR area on Sunday- Kelsey you were awesome friendly, attentive, informative and my little one thought you were very very nice to suggest she could have her own pizzooki on account she graduated 5th grade with such good grades... We agree-- and all know- okay I didnt want to share.. I am entitled once in a while.. yeesh!!!  J/K- no really.. First lets talk brew because you can have ice water and tea anywhere but the brew factor menu here is dyno-mite. had to say it. Just trying to choose is boggling, so this time I had the Berry Burst Cider AMAZING okay I have to say I am a  Framboise gal  (bev mo $5.00) but this berry business has me rethinking my love of a hearty lager.  Moving forward on the food business. I always have a salad kinda cons my brain into healthy mode- this time I had the bleu cheese wedge salad- bacon-y goodness and perfect crunchy lettuce plenty of tomatos M MM MMM  Main dish was the pot roast. Now, normally I have a pasta dish or a personal pizza-- but a pot roast went by to another table-- and I luvs me a good pot roast, hearty hunks of tender meat, salty yet not too salty--peppery thick mushroom gravy hearty and just stick to your ribs fluffy potatoes, carrots were not mushy, just tender and a still a tad crunchy-HOLY SMOKES I am jonesing for pot roast-- goodness...  man-o-man had they offered me a order of sourdough bread I would have licked that plate clean- go ahead laugh-- you would too! On to the real reason why I am here-- one word-- PIZZOOOOOOOKI      doesnt matter how you order it or how much you eat you HAVE to HAVE a Pizzoooki. Seriously I could make this at home any old time and I have, but something about that scoop of ice creme on a not quite all the way cooked, crunchy edge choco-chippy cookie in a pie pan is the bombdiggity! and makes me a happy Redhead and that makes my man happy to see me enjoy a dang cookie -ahh the simple things in life.  OKAY now go to BJ's *******   Parents --- If you have kids who can't behave DON'T sit in the bar area..... wait for a booth where you can coral them in.  We dont want to trip over them as we leave, head to our table or trip over the little darling, as we head to the restroom- Screaming is not an option, pick a non naptime to eat out, if the rest of us who have /had kids can do it- so can you.  Because once again--if our server drops our order in order to not punt your kid across the floor because they were running the 40 yard dash giggling and being cute trying to get away from you....-- - oh yes you the parent will pay for my tossed meal if your kid is a banshee. And I am  NOT the only person that is a parent out there that feels this way. If you think this may be about you- chances are IT IS!"
R. R.,"San Diego, CA",2,33,,2.0,8/27/2014,"When this place first opened it was great. The last time I ate here the food was late getting to table, pizza was cold and they added a long blond hair as a topping. Won't come back."
Chelsea M.,"Long Beach, CA",120,133,74,1.0,9/17/2012,"My boyfriend and I went in for a lunch before I had to go to work on a Sunday.  It was pretty crowded, so I understand it took a while.  But our order was taken after about 10 minutes of us sitting there and then it took ""29"" minutes before we got our food.  In the end, I only had about 5 minutes to scarf my food before I had to get to work.   Our server, Nicole, never came to check on us or to refill or drinks, although she paid much attention to those around us.  I do wonder if it was because our meals were not as expensive and therefore a larger tip would typically not be in order. We did complain to the floor manager that we had been waiting for around 30 or 40 minutes for our meal and that others that had come in before us had already been served.  He was very concerned and did go and check for our ticket and our food immediately came out.  He came to our table and said that the kitchen was a little backed us and that I was in fact wrong about my estimated wait time.  It was really 29 minutes of waiting.  Still pretty long for two small lunches, in my opinion. We didn't receive compensation for any of the wait or distress, but I will really think about visiting this particular BJ's Brew house in the future."
Liz B.,"Wildomar, CA",1,10,1,5.0,3/25/2015,Loved this location!! Service was amazing. All smiles! Manager kept checking on us which was nice. Really enjoyed the mediteranian tacos! And their fries are always on point but I really loved the service everyone was so nice.
Xavier A.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,152,219,3.0,9/25/2014,"Love the ambience and the pleasant vibe. The music is not too loud and neither is the bar. Good food, good service. Straight shooting and solid."
Kimberly W.,"Brooklyn, NY",344,242,222,4.0,10/15/2010,"It depends what meal I'm eating here.  Lunch - A Okay  Happy Hour - Yay! I'm a fan.  (so I'll give the rating the benefit of the doubt)  For lunch today I had the chicken parmigiana. The chicken was nice and thin, crispy, not too much cheese... very well made. The pasta was like a spaghetti. I asked if I could have alfredo sauce, she said it was a spicy type sauce... so for the sake of the people I was sitting with, I just said okay... but... it was spaghetti. The bread pieces it came with were crispy, I wish it was softer. (also can't they tell if the group is business or social? social = booth is acceptable; business = seat at a table!)  So all n all, lunch was... okay.  Now Happy Hour I really enjoy and look forward to. Variety of mini pizzas, mac n cheese (probably my favorite), bruchetta, and not to mention the beer. I love the variety you can get and at all really good prices. Happy Hour... Really Good!"
Billy Y.,"Menifee, CA",0,24,,2.0,12/28/2012,"This Review is about the new one in Menifee, Ca. Not Temecula or Moreno Valley which my co-workers and family think are great!!! We have all tried the new BJS in Menifee that is closer to our houses and offices, but it's worth the drive to go to the other ones. It's not to busy so you get seated quickly, BUT once your seated it takes 10-15 minutes to get  your drink order or service. When you do order, your dinner will come out befor your drinks and salads. Do not order desert that takes a extra 30 minutes. Now we I know why this BJS is getting less and less busier. SERVICE!SERVICE!SERVICE! I've never left a $1 dollar tip for nobody. I did last week. And after talking to friends, family and co-workers they all had the same type of service I had. BAD!!!"
Bob W.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,7,1,1.0,2/5/2016,"Happy Hour is a rip off, big deal $1 off a drink that is already overpriced.  Bring back the half off happy hour and you will earn customers back.  Sad"
Joshua W.,"Provo, UT",1,7,,4.0,2/20/2014,"I love going to BJ's and this location is no exception. The pizza is always good, but what we really came here was the dessert. Their pazookis are always such a treat.  The service was great, and it wasn't as crowded as i would have thought. We were able to get seated pretty quickly, even though it was prime time. Overall a good experience, but only a 4 out of 5 because nothing really set it out as special."
Sandra S.,"Sun City, CA",828,51,21,3.0,4/7/2013,"My husband says I deserve it (not great food) because I go to a place known for pizzas and beers, and order pasta.  I love Bj's Cajun Pasta with shrimp. I still order it every time despite the inconsistency of it. It's always hit or miss at the Menifee's BJ's. One time it could be amazing- flavorful and cooked right, next time it could be bland and pasta can be either over or under cooked.  We have been to the Menifee's BJ's since opening day and I wish their consistency in food and service could be better. The wait time for food is increasing. To the point that if my pasta came out yucky, I (normally would) wouldn't send it back because it would be another 30 minutes of wait time.  Yesterday we went there again and our server went on break so she brought another waitress over to take care of us. The sub waitress must be really busy because she would rush to our table, ask how everything is, and before we could say anything, she would head to the next table, or her eyes would glance around other tables. I understand she was busy, but come on, a little eye contact or be present with her customers for a second or two, wouldn't hurt.  My husband's pizza was delicious though."
Karen A.,"Murrieta, CA",2,11,3,5.0,12/4/2014,Best place to watch Thursday night football.  Happy hour from $1.00 off beers $4.00 BJ'S craft beers or call drinks. Plenty of meals you can share the small deep dish pizza and the tomato with fresh mozzarella cheese balls are wonderful to share or eat yourself. Take the plunge and get back to BJ's for a date night.
'Sherie D.,"San Marcos, CA",1,3,,1.0,1/6/2016,"The service sucks and policies are not consistent from one restaurant to another.  First our server was inattentive.   She made me believe she was just getting off of her shift not starting it.  Employees wander around and visit either other employees sitting and eating or friends of theirs that have popped in.  It took forever to place our food order and there were only 5 tables of people in there. We almost left because it was taking forever for the food to come out.  Then my drink refill was not even what I had been drinking.  There is a huge difference in Peach and Raspberry tea. I will never return to that establishment.  I always get a military discount when I take my kids to the restaurant in Escondido.  The server said she didn't think they offered it but would ask.  Then the young manager came out and told me it was for active duty only.  I was STUNNED.  So if my spouse was deployed and I went in there with my kids we were not good enough for a measly 10% discount but we were good enough to have our patriarch put his life on the line for this measly establishment.  I told this manager that I am given this discount when I am with my kids in Escondido and he said to me. ""You do?""  I said ""No I am lying!""  He tried to back peddle at that point and say that isn't what he meant.  Too late the damage was done.  I couldn't believe I was treated that way and especially in front of my girlfriend or that other tables could hear what was going on. I was so embarrassed and felt so belittled. What made it worse was that he came over with the bill like my credit card didn't go through.  Keep treating your customers like you are doing them a favor and they will show you a closed business.  I will not return to that location!"
