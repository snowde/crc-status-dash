Bernie C.,"Carlsbad, CA",95,269,1146,3.0,11/20/2010,"I've been to several BJ's locations and this is my first time in this location. It's all the same, food is the same...it was okay...I ordered their Jambalaya and I'm usually a fan of spicy food, but this time around...it was too spicy for me! I wished the server came by more often, because I really needed that extra soda or something to cool the spiciness of that jambalaya down!  I understand it was a busy night, but hey...at least acknowledge us every now and again...*rolling eyes*."
R. D.,"Wildomar, CA",3,20,9,4.0,6/28/2014,this place rocks. they have a broad menu so everybody in your group has something to choose from. they have an always amazingly professional staff and you feel welcomed instantly walking in. I was disappointed when they removed their wontons from the menu (light on your stomach *and* wallet) but there are plenty more delicious options. their flatbreads fit in with that same criteria  the staff is great at making sure you have anything you need without swarming too much. bring that hot date for a great meal and wonderful ambiance!
Julia R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,10,,2.0,10/2/2015,I really like the place and I enjoy the food but the waiting time after you order is ridiculous . More than ten minutes to have a house salad and a soup on the table and the place wasn't even packed.
Abrham G.,"Murrieta, CA",0,2,,4.0,9/29/2015,"Food and service was great! My girlfriend and I had the avocado rolls and the spicy Hawaiian pizza, so good! We always got a free Pizookie :) definitely will come back."
Marcus F.,"Escondido, CA",254,1903,3172,4.0,1/25/2010,"Dining in the Dark.  One of the large Big Box BJs franchises. If you've ever been to the BJ's in UTC or Maui you'll know what I'm talking about with the size of this place.  The food is like the Cheesecake Factory in many ways. A very diverse menu with obese sized portions. The food is predictable as far as taste, and in line with many other places like this, though it's cheaper than Yard House and Stone Brewery. I ordered the BBQ salad which was a pile of chopped salad drowning in dressing. It did have a lot of chopped chicken and it tasted good. There was just too much of it, and because it was soggy I couldn't take it home. The Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes was large ( had the rest for lunch today) and was decent. Kids meals are serviceable, but the smiley faced potato discs had an odd texture. Oh well, my son didn't seem to mind. They really dim the light here for dinner, not sure why.  Know This!  - Deep Dish Pizza (Great White) is my fave. Just understand that it's not authentic Chicago style. - The place is dark inside, and well, if it's date night..um I'm just saying :)"
Kris C.,"Beloit, WI",127,391,142,2.0,2/28/2012,"What a mess. I was part of a party of three.. We were seated relatively quickly given that it was a Friday night. So no complaints there.  The food came out ice cold, as if it had been sitting there for days. The sides that we requested to go with our food (ranch, honey mustard) did not come and then when asked for again, I only received half of what I requested. This was after the ridiculous amount of time it took to get the food. Clearly there was not enough wait staff to assist with the crowd. Our waitress gave it her best shot, but it was just not good enough. I am very disappointed with the downhill motion of the quality of food and service here. It really is regrettable as this was one of my go-to places for the longest time."
Diana S.,"Escondido, CA",27,3,,1.0,11/21/2015,"My family and I came here for lunch 2weeks ago. The service was crappy, and the food was missing condiments. I ordered the margherita  flat bread. The tomatoes and basil where missing all it had was cheese. My husband ordered the black and bleu  burger and was missing everything except the bun and patty.  The only meal that was done right was my kids deep dish, but not before I reminded them that they forgot a meal. Later that afternoon my son got food poisoning. Talk about the worst Bj's I have ever been too. We will never ever come here again. I did report this to the health department.  They need to get it together."
Suzee B.,"Redlands, CA",1,6,,1.0,6/5/2012,"What a horrific experience.  I went to the bathroom prior to being seated and overheard a woman stating she had horrible service, I should have taken my clue there. My husband and I sat down and our booth was disgusting. The waitress called over the bus boy and he did a ""piss poor"" job at wiping only half of the table. The waitress ended up having the wipe it down, yet the whole back side of the booth was covered in food as well. Disgusting. The manager was unhelpful and also standoffish when we spoke of the other events that happened. Needless to say we will never eat there again, it's disgusting and so are the attitudes floating around are just as bad if not worse."
Leanne P.,"Milpitas, CA",346,800,158,4.0,9/4/2012,"Great experience at this BJs.   We went here after doing our wine tour of Temecula.  We ended up sitting in the bar area so we could watch some football while we ate dinner.   Our server was quick and attentive.  She made sure all of our drinks were refilled constantly but she didn't hover. Overall, awesome."
Michael C.,"Temecula, CA",5,10,2,5.0,8/1/2015,"Well I can't give a place any less than 5 stars that gives me free beer! My server Travis or Trevor hooked it up! Thanks again bro. I appreciate the trade deal, that's what's up!  ;) I will be back just to srr dude.The food is good too, pizza is great, egg rolls were awesome too ."
M M.,"Temecula, CA",1,23,,2.0,3/23/2015,"Great server but very marginal food. Burnt calamari, inedible lasagna and everything very very slow.  Always like this never gets better. My friend loves the pazookie so I agreed to go but just as bad as all previous visits. The waitress was very pleasant. Wish I could remember her name."
Krystal G.,"Murrieta, CA",41,10,1,4.0,10/30/2014,"Typical chain. The pumpkin beer is awesome! I had one with a shot of fireball, delicious! We went on a Saturday night and it was of course packed. That being said our server was excellent! She was quick and so was the kitchen. Even with our server having a trainee tagging along it was still really fast and quality service."
Steven W.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,2.0,10/26/2014,"10/26/14 @1250 hostess  was very rude and the reason this will be the last time at BJ'S, the waitress was nice and the food great but because of the snobby attitude of the blonde hostess (forgot her name ) will never come back to BJ'S . To the manager please reconsider her employment for the sake of your restaurant"
Jackie S.,"Lancaster, CA",31,209,1,2.0,1/8/2012,"How sad.  We have a Bjs in my hometown, and I JUST went Friday night. But we were tired and hungry, and I just wanted to sit somewhere that was still open.  All i asked for was a chicken sandwich ..no tomatoes, with a side of honey mustard. it came cold, with tomatoes, and no honey mustard.  I felt our waiter was condescending. He asked if we wanted pazookis. I said no, but my dad and brother had one. I took a bite of his, and he said, ""well, well the people who said no are now having bites."" WTF? Shut up. He did not deserve the 20 dollar tip we left him.  I will not go back to this Bjs ever... CRAP!"
Jayme G.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/15/2015,Never will I go again and never have I ever been treated like this before.  I'm not one to give reviews but when you're treated like a toddler at a restaurant its ridiculous.  We were refused drinks (we each had 2 drinks) until we ate something.  This was after we had ordered appetizers and also entrees. Servers were rude and food wasn't anything to write home about.
Shannon W.,"Murrieta, CA",12,22,,5.0,5/29/2014,"Co-workers and I usually stop by once a week after work for the happy hour and just to relax. Never had a bad experience here and the staff works their butts off. Mike and Ashley are both awesome and we totally enjoy coming here,  even if it's just to enjoy a beer or two!"
Michael D.,"Seattle, WA",160,42,35,4.0,4/13/2012,"I love BJ's!  What man doesn't?  Joke! The food here is above average for a chain.  Favorites include the Jambalaya, open faced chili burger, deep dish pizzas, fresh made potato chips, and a few others.  So far, there hasn't been anything ordered that was a disappointment.   The lunch specials are really cheap!  Personal size pizza and salad for about $6. Full bar, lots of people, and great service every time I've visited.   Try it, I doubt you'll regret it."
M G.,"Sun City, CA",1,22,6,1.0,10/11/2013,"I thought this BJs would be better at this location but I was wrong..... Again.  The hostess looked lost, seemed as though she was not too familiar with how to put us in the computer.  The waitress was nice but too bad she didn't know what her daily soups were and assumed we wanted something different. She forgot about us so we had to ask someone else for a refill. Too bad your service doesn't match your food. Hey! We tried."
Grant D.,"Murrieta, CA",6,1,,2.0,11/12/2013,"It's good food, only if a waitress would bring us our food! Or at least come by our table. Waited well over an hour from when we ordered till we got it. That's kinda how it is all the times I've gone there. I usually avoid going there to be honest. Nobody has time to wait as long as everything takes there."
Mike W.,"Murrieta, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2013,Went Monday night for a family dinner at 6:15 PM. It was the worst dining experience we have had in the 10 years we have lived in Temecula. Service was beyond slow and the food was prepared poorly. Had to ask the manager to have a pizza redone because the dough was uncooked. It will be long time before we go back. Be warned
