Ryan M.,"San Diego, CA",250,132,98,4.0,8/4/2009,"I like BJ's! ..............Get you mind out of the gutter, foo!  I'm talkin' about the restaurant! Pizza is pretty bomb diggy.  Love the Great White and Buffalo Chicken.  Always a hit with the friends and family.  Also, I'm a big fan of their micro brews. The Jeremiah Red is money.  Ask for the Jerryburst, which is a Red with a splash of berry in it.  That's downright dangerous because I can down a few of those with a quickness.  For dessert, you gotta pick up a Pizooki, which is a nice, warm, freshly baked, ooey-gooey cookie with a heaping chunk of ice cream on top. That's some good stuff, my friend. Had a party here and booked it the day before. Manager and staff were really courteous and had a table ready for about 10 of us. Would of been nice to have our tables placed in a less crowded area(we were smack dab in the center) but was fine with the set up.  Everyone had a good time and food, as always, was delish!  A few of us, including me, got a bit stupid off the microbrews.  But it's all good in da hood! Anyway, I like it here and often come back.  Definitely one of the good bars/restaurants in the Temecula area. My wife likes BJ's too!...............Get you mind out of the gutter, foo!  Already told ya I'm talkin' about the restaurant."
EvilOliv 3.,"San Diego, CA",1,54,10,2.0,11/16/2013,Waste of time. Only good part was the beer. My burger was the size of a quarter. Expected much more for $10.50
Erin C.,"Temecula, CA",68,334,26,4.0,8/16/2011,"I just read my review of the Laguna Hills BJ's location and now I'mwondering what I was so critical of. BJ's has definitely grown on me, especially as it is one of the places that my parents and I can AGREE on! I love their Jeremiah Red beer, and their food is very good. DEFINITELY get a pizookie!! You can definitely do worse in Temecula. BJ's is one of our go-to locations."
Basil M.,"Murrieta, CA",140,471,203,1.0,6/25/2013,"I never write reviews for chains - but I felt compelled to. I have to preface this with - we like the food. We get take out here often.  But when we have eaten at the restaurant - we have always had a bad experience.   I don't know why I even bothered going back again today. We ordered our appetizers and the kids food first. The apps and kids food came out 25 Minutes later. The kids fries were cold and soggy - but they were starving and they ate it anyway. Our calamari was cold too. We sent it back and it took them 20 minutes to replace it. All we ordered for food was a soup and salad, and 1 entree. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out after they replaced our calamari. Today - on a Sunday at 3pm, when the restaurant was 70% empty.  Busy or slow - it's always the same.  The service is bad - it always is bad. In all the years it has been here it has never improved.  This is not a staff problem - This is a management problem. They clearly do not train the staff. Or they under staff to keep the bottom line low.  Either way - if you come here, expect mediocre service and long wait times.  If you like the food - stick to take out."
Jarrett M.,"Gilbert, AZ",22,79,21,4.0,3/21/2014,Been here a few time with hit or miss service. Food is usually pretty good with a large beer selection. There menu items are safe they dont really go to crazy. I like there burgers and pizza. Also dont forget to get a pazoki.
Julie H.,"Temecula, CA",8,10,1,3.0,6/15/2014,Went for lunch. Good service. Chicken tacos are perfect for lite lunch. Ahi salad is my favorite choice.
Jenn G.,"Temecula, CA",5,63,11,2.0,10/20/2013,The food was ok but took us an hour and a half just to get our food. A week prior we came here with another group and the result was the same. Our waitress was fine.
Dee S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,5,5.0,9/14/2015,"We come to,Bjs for the the entertainment the people watching,the good and did I mention the,deserts!!!"
Sara L.,"La Puente, CA",15,25,9,1.0,9/27/2013,Worst service ever!!  Especially by Julie L waiting 1 hour and 20 mins to receive my meal. Horrible!! Not even a sorry to keep you waiting!?
Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27,2.0,11/4/2013,"Gotta agree with Dana a bit from below. This was our first time here and we had to constantly keep calling the waiter for refills and utensil's which they didn't provide us with when we sat down. Still the food was GREAT but the service really is bad here. Understaffed, under deliver..."
Ray V.,"Oklahoma City, OK",2,83,3,3.0,4/21/2012,"Being in the suburbs of Temecula, BJ's is a good place to take family or a date.  It can get quite noisy with the mixed crowd and the extremely busy during the weekends.  The servers and host/ess do try their best to accommodate the customers and I do appreciate that.  They also have several TVs playing different sports.  The food is so-so but you really don't go here for the food.  The beer on the other hand is great.  Try the porter or the stout... And if you are feeling like a fat kid, get the ""pazzuci(?)"" It's a freshly baked cookie with ice cream. A-Ok in my book."
Daniel C.,"Brentwood, CA",218,30,1,2.0,6/2/2013,"This is a very generous review. I've had many issues with this particular location but today's shenanigans set me off. Here is what went wrong: 1) incorrect sauce was brought with a meal 2) meal replacement took so long to return everyone at the table was done eating 3) drinks were never refilled nor asked about 4) my rewards card was not scanned properly and I was told ""it'll take too long"" and 5) my growler was filled and left uncapped for about 5 mins. Simply put...terrible."
Dwight W.,"Kahului, HI",0,7,,4.0,7/24/2014,We have always had good service at the bar. The house taps are average and the guest taps provide a good selection of top quality choices. The food choices are plentiful and above average. I would definitely choose this place above the Public House and the beer is better than Karl Strauss.
Aaron H.,"Hemet, CA",12,44,432,5.0,2/23/2014,"This place is just fantastic. Not a bad experience yet. People say the prices are a little high but come on, they're more than comparable to their competitors but in opinion the food is much better. Giving this place a 5 for the years of good times. By the way try their Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli. I said Bacon Aioli... that's all you need to know."
Tanya J.,"Monrovia, CA",1,4,1,5.0,5/23/2015,"So we just got done with a group of 12 at this location and must say definitely  impressed. Cody was our server and he not only kept the tickets organized and separated he rocked the service with making sure everything is okay, as a group of 12 skydivers going out to eat it's not always smooth but boy did he kill it! Totally impressed, great experience."
Jamie L.,"Chicago, IL",186,61,17,3.0,1/4/2012,"They've got a great beer selection, and a menu like an Applebees with a ton of different American style types of meals to choose from. The food was definitely a little better than your average chain, but nothing to write home about.  I got the Ahi Tuna Salad. The salad was actually pretty good except it came un-tossed, which I guess this is pretty standard for seared tuna salads. Except there was a dollop of wasabi at every corner of the salad . First I tried grabbing the different parts of the salad for each bite but that was kind of obnoxious. Then I tried to toss it so I could eat it like a normal salad, but this caused large chunks of wasabi to be hidden within the salad. Therefore, every few bites I'd get one of the chunks and my nostrils would burn and flare up. Luckily that feeling only lasts a few seconds. Not sure the best way to resolve my issues, but the salad could have been great otherwise. Maybe try mixing the wasabi in with the dressing BJ? All in all the best part of this place was the beer and the atmosphere. Next time I'll just stick to the bar and finger foods."
Gregory W.,"Murrieta, CA",32,19,6,4.0,11/9/2013,"Good Pizzas, but I have to say if your looking for a top quality beer I would suggest going to Karl Strauss Brewing Company instead."
Zue W.,"Cathedral City, CA",33,210,737,5.0,5/1/2012,The food here is so good ESPECIALY the New York it's delicious and everyone is so nice and eager to please your every wish but without being a pest the food is cooked just right. The drinks and the beer are so fresh and delicious. Come here it's very  cool but very loud. Cheers.
Joel N.,"Temecula, CA",38,22,,4.0,2/11/2014,Wow what a great place! Hard to believe I just discovered this place last year! Great food great service. My kids love the pozokies! It's also a great place to get avery good microbrew!
Melissa C.,"West Chicago, IL",220,148,579,2.0,7/25/2013,"We were so excited to come to BJs this year. Coming from Chicago, we don't have a BJs in the area, and I remembered from our past visits to Southern California and Maui how much we loved their bruschetta and pizza. This past visit was super disappointing :( The service was extremely slow and the server kept forgetting things we'd ask for (parmesan cheese, silverware, etc). First we ordered our appetizers and ordered the famous bruschetta among other things for the table. We ordered a large, but the server had put in the mini order for us! When we let him know the mistake, he said to keep the mini order for his mistake and that the large order would be out shortly. It did take quite a while to get the order out, but ended up coming out fine. However, at the end of the meal, we noticed (after we paid of course!) that we were charged for BOTH the mini and the large order of bruschetta!  After our appetizers, we waiting QUITE a while for our meal. Our server kept coming up to our table saying that the food would be out any second, yet I never saw him go back to the kitchen to check it :/ When we received our order, my husband and my cousin's husband shared a large pepperoni and sausage pizza. Again, being from Chicago, I've had a ton different types of pizza. When we recieved the pizza it was lukewarm at best and had a doughy texture....like it wasn't cooked long enough, but than sat under the warming lamps for longer than it should have. Overall, our trip to BJs was anticlimactic at best. In the future, we'd probably order some bruschetta to go and leave it at that...."
