Linda T.,"Long Beach, CA",132,399,69,3.0,1/3/2012,"We had dinner here after wine-tasting, we got to sit at the firepit which was very nice. We ordered pizzas and burgers, and pizookies, which I opted out of. Everyone enjoyed the pizzas, but the rest of us who had hamburgers were a bit dissapointed. The meat was a little too charred for medium-well. It was a bit dry, too. Overall though it was A-OK."
Kate P.,"Temecula, CA",143,10,1,1.0,8/5/2015,"Went there late last night. Our server seemed frazzled despite the restaurant being half empty... First we ordered drinks, we waited about 10 minutes for those. When he came back he forgot my dads beer and he brought me a raspberry sparkling lemonade thing when I ordered an orange twist... When I told him it was the wrong one he told me I was wrong and that it was definitely an orange twist. It wasn't because it was clear with red stuff on the bottom. I asked him to bring me another one, and he brought back the right one. Dad still didn't have his beer. When he bright me a refill he brought me back some red cranberry grapefruit thing? I honestly didn't feel like waiting for another 10 minutes just to have him fix my drink again. Finally brought dad his beer. When the food came out they got all the sides wrong so we had to wait again for those. My boyfriend and I are regulars here but maybe we'll find somewhere else. Pazookie was great. Make your servers and bartenders study drinks and pay more attention to the customers drink and food orders and you'll be a great restaurant. The hostesses were nice, sweet and awesome! They always are!"
Angelina B.,"San Marcos, CA",0,10,3,5.0,6/24/2014,Very fast service. Food was great! I had deep dish pizza my daughter had fettuccine  Alfredo
Adriana B.,"Riverside, CA",0,28,5,4.0,3/8/2015,"Wow! Finally a bjs that I can see myself coming to that has great quality food, service and environment! Especially after midnight very impressed."
Bard M.,"Canyon Lake, CA",3,85,1,1.0,2/4/2014,"If I could do less than one star, I would. This place has the worst service as well as the one in Menifee. We went in for lunch a couple of weeks ago and the hostess seated us. Then we were asked what drinks we wanted. That part was okay but it took another 15 minutes for the server to come take our order. The appetizers didn't take long to get but when we were done with them, the entree took another 20 minutes and it was cold and hard like it had been sitting under the lights waiting for the server to pick it up. The place wasn't busy at all which really surprises me. This happened in both the Menifee and Temecula properties. How do these people stay in business with such crappy service? I won't go back!"
Ken K.,"Murrieta, CA",31,11,,5.0,6/9/2015,Love this place I'm usually a creature of habit.  But at BJ's I've tried several dishes and there all awesome.
Joe S.,"Temecula, CA",54,154,94,4.0,4/4/2012,"We hit this place last night for a late dinner.  We started off the night with a nice tall, ice cold Hef, a pomagranet mojito and an ice tea to chase down the avocado egg rolls and the seared ahi tuna appetizers.  I could have eaten this 2 items all night long. For the main course, we ordered Scampi pasta, a sesame salad and a medium rare 12 oz. rib eye with horseradish mashed potatoes.  Yeah, you heard right, horseradish mashers!  Anyway, all was sweet. The waitress (Amber) was really nice but, towards the end of the night, we kind of felt like she was trying to rush us out of the establishment.  Maybe she was about to exit stage left and wanted her tip.  She did do a good job and passed by the table quite often. Total bill was $81.67 for 3 of us.  They need to step up their game to be competitive with The Yardhouse down the street."
Bree M.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/26/2014,"So I came here to have a nice lunch with my fiancé and 5 month old baby. I have never been so disappointed in a BJ's before. I will not be coming back to the location because of the staff. First off we tell them we have 2 plus a baby and when they go to seat us they put us in there busiest isle in a 2 person booth with a sling. -.- Our poor baby was so in the way and kept getting hit for being so far in the isle and when we asked to be moved they made a huge deal out of it and wouldn't move us saying they couldn't serve us in the bigger booths next to us! This BJ's is trash thank god our food was good, but def no tip was deserved..."
Russell S.,"Temecula, CA",0,16,,5.0,5/22/2015,"Love this place!  You can count on a very good dining experience.  Good food (though they do tend to change the menu often), very solid service all around, and incredible value for the money.  They are very accommodating, e.g., will seat large groups with ease, and break up the checks to make it easy on large parties.  This place is always clean, and the environment is nice--good energy but not too loud.  This is one of our ""go-to"" places, and always delivers a good experience."
Raul V.,"Fallbrook, CA",5,95,33,5.0,1/13/2014,"This place never disappoints! Food, service  & brew is excellent. Last time I went I ordered the jambalaya, if you like spicy this plate is right up your alley! I loved it. We also had some flat bread pizza as an appetizer, bomb! ;)"
Jennifer B.,"Temecula, CA",18,29,6,5.0,11/30/2013,Called in ahead of time and went right in. Was super busy but service was excellent. Food was perfect. It totally hit the spot. I had the balsamic glazed chicken which is sooo goood!!! Scott had the ribs that just feel off the bone. They were delicious!!! Ended with a triple chocolate pzookie which was mmm mmm good.
Stephen M.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,13,5.0,5/13/2014,Great weekday lunch specials and Sunday Brunch menu. Highly Recommend!
Danielle G.,"Denver, CO",239,237,13,4.0,8/14/2013,Food was good. Did takeout - lettuce cups and potstickers. Staff was courteous and friendly on the phone when I placed the order and when I picked it up.
Jared P.,"Mount Juliet, TN",42,41,23,2.0,8/30/2013,"There is something great about coming to a restaurant that is understaffed.  BJ's has a beautiful atmosphere but in the end I come to partake of food, not wait an hour at my table before eating... Slow as hell...."
Juan C.,"Temecula, CA",0,19,1,3.0,1/14/2014,To be honest I come here when I want to get free stuff. It's a guarantee they will mess your order up or be out of something you want. It's happened every time I've been here. Food is good beer selection excellent but they are so unorganized it hard to make it a go to spot.
Brian B.,"Murrieta, CA",2,7,6,4.0,1/7/2014,The French dip is great here and the pizzas are good for the whole family. The tatonka stout is my favorite beer on tap.
Chris A.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,4,1.0,4/16/2015,They will believe it's your birthday and be completely fine if you make sexual innuendos about their name.
Dawny M.,"Platte City, MO",29,101,102,3.0,7/22/2013,"I had the California Flat Bread and bowl of clam chowder. Both were good, but the wait was unbelievable long for a Monday night. First the flat bread was the wrong one, everyone else was served then I had to wait another 10 minutes to get what I had ordered. Both my husband and grandson were getting very impatient for their dinner I had soup so I was ok with waiting. Then wait wait wait for a drink refill. Oh yeah the wait for dinner was so long, first round of drinks were emptied before we were served. Did I say the service was very very slow. Not our waiters fault you could see him running around. They didn't have enough wait staff working and the kitchen was slow. Relax and don't expect good service. If the service was better, I'd go more often because for a casual dinner it's pretty good."
Dan C.,"Murrieta, CA",1,3,6,1.0,2/16/2015,Food took for ever to come out waiter seem to not care. Waited about 25 minutes for our apps that came out with our entrees it was cold won't be back
Emily H.,"Canyon Country, CA",15,58,7,4.0,8/6/2011,"We live in L.A. and had just bought a car down the street and were starving and needed a lunch.  BJ's is gorgeous on the outside and equally beautiful inside.   Our waitress was ""Robin S."" and she was great!  She was always there at the perfect time:  to pour more iced tea, get our appetizer ASAP, and to ask us how the meal tasted.  She was great and we gave her a good tip. I had a chicken sandwich which was okay, my husband had the signature Jambalaya which he loved.  We shared an Oreo Pizookie which was the perfect portion for 2 people. Overall it was a great place to have lunch.  Thanks Temecula!  :)"
