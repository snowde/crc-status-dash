Kait R.,"Houston, TX",0,356,138,4.0,10/11/2010,"5 stars for service 3 stars for food I've been to my fair share of BJ's restaurants and this one is by far the best when it comes to service. Our server Robin was terrific. She stopped by soon after we sat down and had a very friendly demeanor. She checked back just enough times to see how everything was. If every server were like her, I would be a happy camper. The Bazaar wait staff should learn from this woman. One of our appetizers was late because the kitchen goofed on the ingredients and they had to make it again. Robin came over immediately to let us know and apologized profusely. The manager even stopped by to apologize. They didn't leave us out to dry wondering where our orders was. We also received complementary pizookies because we were celebrating a few birthdays.  The restaurant was very busy at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the wait only got longer. Luckily we only waited 20 minutes for a large booth in the back dining area. By the time we left, all the wait area seats outside and inside were filled with people eager to get into the restaurant.  What to order: A pitcher of BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Crispy Potato Skin Platter Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage Flatbread pizza Buffalo Chicken PIzza Pizookie The food isn't bad and they have a good selection so there is something for everyone. I would come back because of the great service.  NOTE: They no longer serve the pizza in a deep pan. It now comes on a plate, but according to our server, they still cook it in the pan."
Laura B.,"Murrieta, CA",12,38,,3.0,9/4/2011,"I came to BJ's last night with my husband. I'm a vegetarian and finding a place that we can both eat at is often very hard. So I was pleased to see that BJ's had an assortment of pizza's that were meat free, a pasta with veggies dish, and a bunch of salads. So many restaurants these days are content and making their vegetarian patrons eat bread and cheese, so it's nice to be able to see some actual veggies.  I ordered the mediteranean vegetable pasta and a mozzarella and tomato salad. I thought the salad was really good, although I'm not really a fan of straight up balls of cheese (I made my husband eat those).  When my vegetable pasta came out, I thought it looked really good. WRONG! It was horrible. I can't even explain it. It tasted good at first, but there was a really nasty after taste that reminded me of burning plastic. I was never able to pin-point the culprit. Perhaps it was the kalamata olives? Or the capers? Or just the weirdness of putting those together in a tomato sauce. Either way, it was gross. I tried to eat it, tried to ignore the after taste, but about 1/4 of the way through the salad I just couldn't do it and had to stop eating (and believe me, I'll usually force myself to eat even the most gross restaurant meals, but not this time) If we go back (which I imagine we will), I will be sure to NOT order that god aweful vegetable pasta. Oh, and service is just ok. One of the other waitresses took our drink order (beer and wine) and then forgot to tell our actual server so we waited 30 minutes for our drinks. Then our waitress kept sneaking up on us and asking how food was. Look, you only need ask once, not every 5 minutes."
Jeffery S.,"Winchester, CA",50,9,6,5.0,10/27/2013,Every time I come here I try and order something new and I've never been disappointed. The food is amazing the service is fantastic and don't even get me started on the beer.  Can't go wrong here!
Eric M.,"Temecula, CA",6,6,,3.0,3/9/2014,"First time there was great, second, not so great. We must have had a trainee. You should never have your food delivered with empty beer glasses. Ate half my meal without something to wash it down with. Pasta dish is good, have yet to try the Pizza, seems a bit small and pricy for me. Wish they would leave a drink menu behind so you can remember the other crafted beer choices to try."
H A.,"Orange, CA",19,78,166,4.0,7/16/2011,"I guess I'm on a salmon kick, and everywhere I go I order it.  I ordered it here too and I was delighted by the plate. it was good!  The atmosphere here is loud and lively.  Good place to come with friends or bring the family."
Katie B.,"Temecula, CA",0,15,,4.0,3/5/2014,"I'm not that big on chain restaurants - i usually prefer smaller gems, family owned, fresh food, etc. But I have always liked BJ's; Great beer, great food, and even better dessert.  If you haven't tried a pizookie, you are missing out on life!!! If you're a newbie, definitely get the original chocolate chip for your first experience. Pizzas are good - I like the Great White and the BBQ Chicken. And the avocado egg rolls are my favorite appetizer! The staff is always very friendly, they've got a lot of TV's if you want to go in and watch a game, and its a good place to bring a family - they've got a MASSIVE menu."
Marlon D.,"Menifee, CA",136,36,6,1.0,4/20/2014,"Well here is my take on this spot.   Food wise was great as always.  However the service was less than desirable.   Considerably less.  Now this may be because I came in with a fairly large group but that is no excuse for terrible service.   At anyrate, first mistake, guy took our drink orders and took our appetizer orders.  Drinks came out fine however the appetizer after about 20-30min I ordered never came out even though I watched him write it down just before he left.  I asked if my order was going to come out he then said ""no I forgot to put it in I'm sorry ill do it now.""   I told him that wouldn't be necessary as it would come out the same time as my meal as I had ordered a salad.  Mistake #2 Our drinks were consistenly late being refreshed even though 3 different servers passed us looked at our tanle saw the empty glasses smiled at us and continued on their merry way.  REALLY what happened to working as a team?  Mistake 3 After about 1hr and change our order came out.  This is after the server  came back to tell us about 20min after we ordered our main dishes that serveral orders from our group could not be fulfilled due to being out of those particular foods.  Wow... now comes the real disturbing part. Mistake 4 One of our party members could not consume a particular food and had made it abundantly clear at time of order.  When the order came out.... it was exactly opposite of what he ordered.  He made the complaint politely and reordered his pizza.  Mistake 5 After about 20-25mi  the order came out again the exact same way it came out originaly.... WRONG!!!!  At this point we are completely dissatisfied.   The attempt to make things right went almost unnoticed.  Now after being to both the Temecula one and menifee one and after hearing that the Temecula one service was so much better... I'll have to disagree.   This experience has been the worst I have had in ANY RESTAURANT.  I firmly believe that corporate should come down unannounced and investigate both sites for a period of one month to rectify these deficiencies.  Because this was absolutely horrible.  However the food, when we got it was great.  Not 1-2hr wait time great but good none the less."
Philip M.,"Santa Monica, CA",337,112,31,4.0,11/13/2010,"Went two nights in a row, had a great time. Very casual, but a great time.  They forgot my soup both times and comped me both times too. Sweet! Great house draft beers and lots of other choices too! Gluten-free pizza is a great option, so is the gluten-free beer.  Love the shrimp lettuce cups and the avocado wrappers."
Andrea M.,"Hemet, CA",23,237,19,5.0,4/10/2013,Love the Classic pizza! The Jeremiah red is the best beer there. Nice place to go grab a beer and hang out for a while.
Karen T.,"Temecula, CA",0,14,,2.0,10/15/2012,"I'm glad they have a gluten free menu, but it would be nice if the wait staff were more familiar with it. My gluten free BBQ chicken salad came with the onions on it which makes it not gluten-free. When I told the waiter he disagreed with me, saying that it was still gluten free. I'm glad I kept the menu so I could show him that it is only gluten free if it doesn't have the onions on top. He didn't apologize, but took my salad back to be remade. An apology would have been nice."
John A.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,23,17,4.0,8/15/2013,"Great place to have a reasonably priced lunch.  Chicken fried steak comes with mashed potatoes, gravy, and vegetables.  It is a sports bar, so can be a bit noisy.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  Dinners are very good too!"
Erika G.,"Fallbrook, CA",10,101,34,4.0,4/6/2011,"Me and my girlfriend sat at the bar at around two on a week day. We were helped by Greg and, while shy, he could hold his own in a conversation so that made us immediately comfortable. We both ordered a beer at happy hour price, I ordered the tuna starter and stuffed mushrooms, she ordered the salad and sandwich combo. Her caprese salad wasn't huge but it had excellent flavor. My food items were great and immediately filled me up. I splurged a little and got the berry....thing....pazooki? Dunno...And it had nice flavor but it didn't leave me wanting more.  This place is always busy but the service I have had at my last visit and the ones before have always been very nice. They have huge TVs and their decor is very modern in a very open space. Will return!"
Ian L.,"Oceanside, CA",2,13,13,4.0,10/27/2013,"Here's another place that depends on when you get there, that will depict how fast you're seated and your service quality. Nice on tap selection and the grub is good, I generally order a couple appetizers and have a few drinks though."
Erika S.,"Temecula, CA",6,19,,5.0,8/4/2013,"We had our sons 1st  birthday party yesterday and we were VERY HAPPY with the service and food! Our party was approx. 85 people so it was hard to find a restaurant that could accommodate a party that large but BJ's was perfect!! They gave us the entire side room and it was the perfect size. They also let me set up a sweets display table at the party which was also great! I know some places don't let you bring in any outside food which can be a drag, especially for kids parties. I met with the events manager Brian Neal a few months before to go over the menu and guest # etc with him and he was very attentive and very accommodating, he even offered us way more buffet options for our event with no additional cost! It's nice to know that when I bring in a large event to a restaurant they will somewhat ""take care of me"" instead of nickel and diming me for every little thing. My guests were very happy with the food, service and set up of the party, as was my husband and I!! At the end of the party we were provided 3 HUGE PAZOOKIES for my guest wtih no extra charge!!! What a GREAT way to end a party!! My guest were so delighted and happily STUFFED with the great food and dessert!! During the event all the staff was very nice and attentive as well. I was running around the whole time, first setting up the décor and what not then busy mingling with my guest when they arrived. Really having barely anytime to sit down so it was so nice that a couple times the staff came up to me and asked me if I needed a drink or anything, which I thought was very attentive! THANK YOU BJ's for a great and memorable 1st birthday party!! You really exceeded my expectations!! Would definitely recommend BJ's for not only their regular dine in but an event as well!!"
Stephany A.,"Kailua, HI",37,29,15,4.0,3/17/2013,"Love BJ's in Temecula!!! I enjoy the food, the service (for the most part), the ambience but I love the drinks the most!!! The mojitos are awesome and the chocolate cake shot is delicious!!!"
Norman V.,"San Diego, CA",18,12,,2.0,10/14/2012,"The salads today were good but the pizza was VERY bland. Bread with toppings, served on a plate, with no real pizza flavor to it. Not sure if the kitchen was lazy, BJ's is trying to get ultra healthy on us, or the Temecula joint just sucks (but they sure were busy). Customer service was a little weak too (missed orders, drink refills, etc.)."
Tamber G.,"Temecula, CA",93,161,88,3.0,2/10/2013,The food was just ok here. The service was good. Im not sure if we will give this restaurant a try again. It's just not all its hyped up to be.
James L.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,1,2.0,1/21/2015,I like BJ's but this location sucks. You can't get your growler refilled with beer! Only root beer..... WTF root beer.
Lisa Y.,"Escondido, CA",4,35,,4.0,6/29/2013,"I went there for the first time last weekend. The staff was very friendly. I had the Cobb salad. I was not so thrilled with the garlic dressing. Otherwise, the food was pretty good and reasonably priced."
Darcy S.,"Anza, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/7/2014,"So, after I first great time at BJ's about a month ago, we went back in on a Monday night taking our guest from Germany.  It was very busy and I thought ""uh oh"".   Not fear though. We had a darling waitress Ashley and she was fantastic.  We never had to ask for anything, she was always right on the mark.  Rib Eye and Top sirloin were fantastic and the Cajun pasta was awesome.  I wouldn't recommend the Tuscan pasta, it was really gross.  But, the service was impeccable as always and we had a very nice time."
