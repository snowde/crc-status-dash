Kennia D.,"Murrieta, CA",13,9,3,5.0,11/12/2014,"BJs never disappoints, food is delicious! I usually get the buffalo chicken pizza, very good! The burgers r huge and delicious, my daughter had the soup in a bread bowl and salad, first time ever she did not finish the bread because it was a good size portion,(and she can eat!) For a family of five with teenagers, you get big portions and price is good."
Jesse W.,"Murrieta, CA",83,88,90,2.0,7/18/2010,Overpriced and over hyped. A small 4 slice pizza is in the 14-15 dollar range. It's good imitation Chicago style deep dish but not worth the price. It's constantly crowded and I can't figure out why. Twice the price as it's competitors and not any better.  The service is okay but everytime I have gone here the seemed more concerned about making sure I finish my dinner in 10 minutes. I'm by no means a slow eater but here I feel the watchful eyes everytime. I hate getting the check dropped off not even way into the meal. If I'm dropping 40 bucks on food alone I want to enjoy it.  Im sure there are good waiters but I can't keep justifying the price and rush for the food even if it's okay.
Joe F.,"Spring Valley, CA",15,75,1,2.0,7/18/2010,"The service at this place is what kills it, since the day it opened.  Love the Cobb Salad, the beers are great.  But when it takes 20mins to make a salad, or when you have to remind your waiter that you have another beer coming, big turn off. If I can, I try to sit at the bar.  With the barkeeper there, things seem to go faster."
Greg A.,"Murrieta, CA",118,34,34,5.0,4/6/2013,"BJs Restaurant & Brewhouse in Temecula is a place we enjoy at least twice a month. The food is always consistent, Service is always above average. Great Deep Fried jalapeno Burger.You can't go wrong with anything on the Menu. The Micro Brew is some of the best. I gotta give it 5 Stars just because you always know what your gonna get before you go & the prices are resonable for the food. Never tried the Pizza but hear it's awesome. French Dip with Horse Radish is highly Recommended !!"
Louie A.,"Menifee, CA",134,147,1388,4.0,9/3/2010,"Love place, the atmosphere and the food is great. This eatery is well known for their deep dish pizzas and variety of beers. To start off we had the Sampler platter and Fried Calamari. Tonight our group had ordered two deep dish pizzas, the Mediterranean and the BBQ.  Both was very good, FYI the BBQ is very spicy and the Mediterranean had awesome flavors, it had some pepperchini.  To top it off, we ordered a couple Poosokies, we had the -- cookie.  We shared the deserts it was more than enough for a group of seven."
Heather F.,"Corona, CA",8,4,,2.0,5/2/2013,"Been to much better BJs...Apparently the Manager here takes saving payroll very serious. Every time we have come here the waiter/waitress we get is taking care of way too many tables at one time. Takes forever to get your food and when you do, it's been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minutes. Beer is good tho!"
Veronica C.,"Escondido, CA",133,151,45,3.0,10/1/2012,"I LOVE them for their pizookies, but I wish they a wider seafood and vegetarian selection"
AK M.,"Bay Area, CA",94,142,6,4.0,1/9/2010,"I""ve always had good experiences @ this restaurant. Except this time, I was on a good one so of course I had a great time :)  The chicken alfredo is yum yum yum!"
Colleen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,11/17/2014,Watch your back people this happy hour is designed to distort portions and prices....don't think you are ordering what is on the happy hour menu - ask for details
Scott G.,"Temecula, CA",5,1,,2.0,5/27/2013,"Staff was great. Pizza, not so much. I ordered the ""Sweet Pig"", the ham was like warm and the pizza tasted like it had been frozen. Just not the place I would turn too for pizza in Temecula."
Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,29,23,4.0,1/19/2007,"Shawn H. pretty much said it all... the menu is huge!  So far, everything I have ordered - from appetizers to entrees has been delicious.  As far as I can tell, you can't lose with BJ's - they have tons of beach city locations in southern California - seek one out and go!   Now, I am not from Chicago, but the pizza is excellent.  If you are not a fan of pizza (in other words insane), try the ""Fork and Knife"" meatloaf sandwich.   It's a really special recipe - mmmmmm... meatloaf."
Shawn H.,"Temecula, CA",11,24,10,4.0,9/5/2006,"Today was the first day this restaurant was open to the public, so everyone was on their best behavior.  There were many servers available.  By noon, the place was packed with atleast 100 people waiting for a table.  This is not untypical for a new restaurant in Temecula.   BJ's is a Brewery and Pizza place that also serves a wide variety of foods.  They are famous for their Chicago style pizza and Pizookie.  A fresh, oven-baked cookie with a large scoop of ice cream served on top.  The menu is HUGE, and doesn't JUST serve Pizza.  Check out their menu on-line and you will see they have EVERYTHING.   I can't imagine not ordering Pizza but that is your problem. :) What I like about this restaurant is the food is very fresh.  The pizza crust is great.  It has the corn meal crust like a typical Chicago style UNOs or Ginos has.  The tomato pieces on the pizza were tasty and not wet and slippery.   We ordered ""BJ's Favorite""  The menu says this about the BJ's Favorite: The Works! Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and fresh Roma tomatoes. The server was brand new to BJ's but obviously not new to serving.  She was on top of my drink and was pretty quick on all of our needs.   The restaurant is very loud and noisy when full as there is nothing really soft to mute the sounds of all the people echoing into the high ceiling room.  This is part of the ambiance that I think people like.  I liked it a lot. They have comfy booths as well as large tables for larger groups.  The price of the pizza was $17 and easily served 3 people.   I wish they had the nutritional information available but they didn't.   I asked at the restaurant and I went on-line, they just don't have it yet.  There are only like 30 restaurants right now so maybe as they grow. Check it out and tell me what your thoughts are.  I hope it was a good experience!"
Alan And Jackie H.,"Oceanside, CA",15,73,1,5.0,2/23/2013,"Me and the Family have been here multiple times.  Each time is great!  Nice place and the servers are friendly.  Food is great as well.  They have this all you can eat pasta salad thing that my daughter and I love.  They have a bunch of pizza's and stuff, but we have never gotten any of those."
Rachel Q.,"San Diego, CA",279,584,46,3.0,8/27/2010,"I have been going to BJ's a lot lately!  Twice in a week! We went to BJ's for a coworkers ""farewell"" lunch..  I have to say.. the service was SLOOOOOOOOOOOW.. What was intended to be an hour lunch lasted us about almost two hours.. Yikes! It took forever for them to get our drink order.. then after we ordered everything.. it took forever for the food to come out.. and we ordered the pizookie sampler at the same time we ordered our meal.. and that took forever to come out! I'm still going to give it three stars because the food was good.. I had the lunch chicken parmigana.. and that was really good.. and the pizookie sampler we had was the choco-chip, cookies n cream, and the white choco-macadamia nut.. All were heaven in my mouth! I like this place enough to come back to this location again.. just not at lunch time when I'm in a hurry.."
Veronica R.,"Temecula, CA",0,41,,3.0,4/22/2013,"Because it's in walking distance we frequent. However, we get drinks/beer, which are good and sometimes appetizers. They don't offer many healthy choices so this is why I no longer eat anything off the menu, except their tortilla soup which is delicious!! The salads aren't that great.."
Stephanie N.,"Menifee, CA",72,58,190,4.0,8/19/2012,We just came in today for a quick appetizer and a beer and the service was outstanding . We love the ambiance of the establishment and the cleanliness as well.  Jade was our server today and she was so very attentive and professional. She is a true credit to the service industry.  She was prompt and made recommendations to assist with our selections.  She checked back within two minutes after our food arrived and cleared our plates from our table as we finished them.  Though we were not a large ticket she was very attentive and continued to ask us if we needed anything.  The food was good and the service was fantastic ....Great job Jade!  We will be back again and we hope that you are our server.
Ken K.,"Hemet, CA",0,20,,2.0,10/30/2013,"Went to BJ's (the Temecula location) for the first time last weekend. First off, I thought the prices were inflated for the amount of food received! I realize they're a business and have to make a profit, but at least give the patron more value for their money than what I saw was the case. $3 for a lemonade? $10 for very, very small ""chicken wings"" (or what passes for ""chicken wings"")? $11 for their ""mini"" (should be ""super tiny"") pizza?  $15 for their ""small"" pizza? $10 for a smallish calzone? (And why do they refer to the calzone fillings as ""toppings""?) By the way, I almost feel they're guilty of false/misleading advertising because the supposedly ""deep dish"" pizzas we ordered were hardly akin to actual deep-dish style pizza. In my view, BJ's serves ""puffed-up"" cotton candy-like thick crusts to give the impression the pizza is so ""tall"" because (as with authentic deep dish pizza) it's chock-full of cheese, meat and sauce. When you bite into a slice of BJ's faux ""deep dish"" you mainly get a mouthful of airy crust with a skimpy amount of cheese, meat and sauce on top. Very disappointing ... but the photos of this mock ""deep dish"" pizza sure do look mouth watering on the menu! The kicker was when our waiter disappeared while we were waiting for a ""mini"" pizza which was ordered late, after the appetizers and main meal items had been ordered. He never gave any indication that he was leaving. We waited and waited and waited for this ""mini"" pizza to arrive and finally I asked another waiter if he could check on it. He informed me that our waiter was gone because he was doing some kind of transaction (maybe squaring up his tips with the cashier or similar.) It would have been nice if he took care of that sometime when doing so didn't interfere with the diners receiving food they'd ordered.  All in all, those who are easily pleased or who aren't too concerned with getting good value for their money or minimally adequate portions of food may like BJ's but for me, the best I can say is that I rate the BJ's location I dined at as ""fair"" at best."
Melissa W.,"Moreno Valley, CA",32,85,4,3.0,8/11/2012,"Service was good, as usual. My steak was thin and overcooked. I prefer it medium rare, and I got it medium, so not enough to complain about. The horseradish mashed potatoes which were described as having ""a little kick"" had huge chunks of horseradish in it, so that was pretty unpleasant. I probably won't get a steak from there again, but will definitely go back for the other thing I enjoy like the avacado eggrolls or their pizza."
Dena L.,"Sun City, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/30/2013,"Sorry but the only thing good out  of 4 adults dinners was the salads.  Horrible food, ok service. I almost didn't make it home before getting sick. Everything was cold.  Won't go back."
Megh D.,"La Jolla, CA",5,149,,3.0,11/15/2009,"It took me 4 visits, but I finally ate something at Bj's. Well done, me. And well done, Bj's, for actually having some reasonable options for the vegan-vegetarian crew. Aside from the cop out option of altering a salad, the manager helped guide me towards a vegetarian pizza (no cheese) or baked potato dressed how I like. I opted for the pizza...why spud it when I could do that easily at home? Without cheese, the deep dish crust was not oily or weighed down; it became more of a pizza pillow, gently cradling the healthy dollop of toppings. The flavours, serving size, preparation were all on point; my one complaint would be that I would have liked some more sauce -not only am I a tomatoe sauce fiend, but the stuff was good purdy durn good. I have also enjoyed a number of their drinks. The house brews are alright. Nothing special. Being a Porter girl meself, I was surprised to enjoy their Berry-something-or-other. Their mixed drinks are served up generously and rocked to heck. Competitively priced for the chain-brewery scene, too. While not a go-to for me, it is nice to know there is yet another place where I can dine with the 'normal' folk (is eating flesh normal?) and not feel like the menu options for me came from a debtor's prison."
