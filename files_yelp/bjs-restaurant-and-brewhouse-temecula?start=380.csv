Chef J.,"Winchester, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2014,Boring menu.......you'll just end up settling for something small and expense  on the menu..
Gabrielle G.,"Menifee, CA",117,101,69,4.0,7/11/2012,"I really love this place despite the consistently horrific service. Great lunch specials! The deep dish pizza, tomato bisque, and Caesar salad are my favorites."
Nino R.,"Hackensack, NJ",295,2097,1483,2.0,10/24/2009,"I have to admit that I'm not a fan of brew house-themed restaurant.  And the fact that this place is a chain makes it a little more intolerable.  I've only been here once for an MNF outing (Monday Night Football).  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and a Crown Royal on the rocks.   The chicken was coated with Panko breadcrumbs and served w/ broccoli and basic mashed potatoes with cheddar.  The chicken was topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil and parm.  It was fine, the Crown was much better of course. The bartenders were dull and ill-informed about anything to do with sports.  I tried starting a conversation about hedge funds but that didn't fly.  Then I asked their opinions on an effective exit strategy for Afghanistan to which an immediate echo of crickets resonated. Very rarely do I tip less than 20%.  It happened at BJ's. On the positive side, the restroom was nicely laid out and very clean.   I'm sure if I ""loved"" beer I would like this place.  If I liked talking to moron bartenders then I would LOVE this place!"
Reviewer M.,"Hemet, CA",0,147,,3.0,5/30/2013,"Good food! My only complaint was last time we went in the kids wanted root beer floats instead of a soda. A soda comes with it, a scoop of ice cream for kids is somewhere near a buck, but for some reasons, we were charged $3.95 for a root beer float. Huh?! No credit for the plain soda they didn't receive at all, just a huge upcharge for a non-refillable drink. So I guess next time we'll order ice cream with our drinks so the kids can put their own ice cream in their cup and save $3.95 each! What a rip off! The manager told us tough stuff!"
Marco G.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,19,,4.0,7/22/2013,I come here for lunch with my family on saturdays great service and staff is on top of it with making sure our drinks are full ...my top five resturants to eat
David L.,"Boston, MA",116,981,840,3.0,3/21/2010,"Taste: 4 Value: 3 Service: 3 Came here for take-out and got one of their sandwiches to go. The food was pretty good, albeit a bit expensive. I also had to wait a bit too long, over 10 minutes."
Carol M.,"Escondido, CA",0,9,,1.0,8/28/2014,Not sure we're going back to this BJ's location.  It looks like drug deals are going on in the parking lot weekend nights out of the back door. Seriously.  It just doesn't feel safe -- and it looks like employees in their uniforms to boot.
Sara C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,5,,4.0,9/17/2012,"The food was good, especially the fried artichoke hearts and the service was superb. Loved it and would definitely come back here."
Gloria B.,"Murrieta, CA",4,59,73,2.0,10/14/2011,"We used to like it a lot but they have discontinued favorite menu items and portion sizes, so we don't go here anymore. There are other better places to eat by the Temecula Mall.  Don't know if other locations have followed suit."
Bryce D.,"Honolulu, HI",5,5,,5.0,4/1/2011,"Took my brother out for his birthday to the Temecula BJ's location. I've been to another BJ's previously and was mildly pleased with the food/service but it was nothing spectacular. This time was excellent though, everything from the service to the food to the value! Got there around 9pm on a Wednesday night, restaurant was about half full so we got a table right away. The hostess and server were both very pleasant and we felt comfortable immediately. I was recommended a beer -the same one I had actually already picked out- and the rest of our group had non-alcoholic beverages. Drinks arrived in a couple minutes, my beer was a ""Red"" that was hearty and flavorful. We ordered the Soup and Salad, BJ's Fav Pizza (medium), and I had the California burger. Debated on the size of the pizza as it would be split amongst a couple people, but after they server showed us the size on another table we decided medium would be fine. Food arrived in about 12 minutes, great timing for a variety of items. My burger was cooked perfectly medium the way I ordered -many places have their own ""version"" of cooking temperatures which are usually wrong. Medium should be slightly pink in the middle, and that's the way it was cooked. The burger itself was fantastic, one of the best I've had all year. Came with chipotle mayo on the side and wedge-cut fries that were equally good. All for $11! The soup and salad was pretty standard, though the Ceasar dressing for the salad was quite tasty and definitely one of the better Ceasar's I've had. The pizza was quite large for a ""medium"", as much food as a normal ""large"" pizza would be at any of the pizza chains. Excellent dough, perfect amount of sauce, and loaded with fresh veggies, cheese, and meat. Great combination that made me steal an extra half of a slice ;). Our total bill came out to around $54 which was a great value for 4 people to fill up to great food. I was completely stuffed as were the rest of my party. Highly recommended!"
M T.,"Murrieta, CA",15,16,,4.0,9/11/2012,usually the pizza is really good but i had the pot roast tonight.  It was good but the veggies consisted of an entire onion and 3 baby carrots.  Really kind of weird.  But the pazookie is iconic so I'm giving the fourth star
Mark P.,"Temecula, CA",17,271,11,4.0,4/28/2012,"First, it is a little expensive.  Second, they took the cajun chicken (southwest) sandwich off the menu, but they still made it for me.  Boneless wings were small for the price, but the sauce was good.  Burgers are huge, kids pizza was dry, pasta dishes were large and good.  Service was solid, although we went at 11am so it should be."
Jonathan W.,"Temecula, CA",102,19,,4.0,8/6/2012,"I went here for a birthday dinner and I thought it was pretty average. I had the Homemade Creme Soda and it was really really good. The menu is so comprehensive and I think it favors everyone. My main course I had a custom Small Pizza with Pepperoni, Bacon and Garlic. It was really good. The customer service was a tad bit inconsistent because we would order something and they would come back with it 10-15 min later. Thats the only part, I wish was better."
Chris M.,"Hemet, CA",41,214,31,3.0,1/31/2012,"I love BJ's, have been going here since I was a kid (Laguna) but the whole franchise food in a bag is sending BJ's in the wrong direction."
Stephanie C.,"San Diego, CA",30,113,11,2.0,7/4/2013,"2 stars for food, zero stars for drinks. The first time I went there I ordered a peach drink. It was off their menu and it came with frozen peaches. The whole drink was loaded with so much sugar I tried to water it down and the before and the after the drink was still not even drinkable. I thought for sure the bartender or person who created the drink wanted to give me and everyone else who ordered it diabetes. I just pushed it aside and could not drink it. Our server might as well be a servant. She had no personality and besides taking our order and dropping our items off, she was clueless. Had she been an attentive server she would have noticed my drink was horrible but however I paid the bill and will never order that drink again. Next time I went there I figured I should at least give this place a second try. Well the appetizer I ordered was alright but I ordered another cocktail off their menu, something different. Wrong! what I learned is do not ever try any cocktails off their menu. A man with no taste buds created it. The drink looked pretty in the picture, it came out looking different and it sure did not taste good. I pushed it aside and this server of course did not recognize my dislike for this cocktails. Moral of story, ask for advise when ordering. Too many items on the menu that are horrible. Food is mediocre, cocktails are just bad."
Dru C.,"Orange County, CA",658,833,2262,3.0,4/21/2009,"I admit it, I'm a fan of the Pizookie. I know it's just a oversized cookie in a deep dish with a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream on top, but I always feel like bustin' a move on top of the table and doing a little shimmy every time I take a bite out of it. Pipin' hot out of the oven, I love the slightly soft and chewy texture on the inside of the cookie. The white chocolate macadamia nut is my favorite, and I could probably polish off 2 or 3 Pizookies in one sitting. Hey BJ's, how about a Pizookie eating contest? I'll be first in line, waiting with a large white bib, two huge spoons, and a grin from ear to ear. One other thing that I liked were the avocado egg rolls. Now I've tried the Cheesecake Factory version many times, and I must say that BJ's version is a lot less oily and heavy. Plus, they don't go overboard with TOO much avocado.  The deep dish pizza? I always end up ordering one, but by the second slice, I'm already sick of it. As an unabashed fan of thin crust NY-style pizza, the concept of the deep dish intrigues me, but I have yet to experience TRUE and authentic deep dish pizza. I definitely hear a foodie trip to Chicago in the very near future."
Karla Z.,"Murrieta, CA",61,61,43,5.0,1/26/2012,"BJ's is my cheat day restaurant of choice. I love their deep dish pizza but my absolute favorite is the Black and Bleu burger. It has bacon, creamy blue cheese and garlic pair that with potato wedges and rootbeer and I am in ""I don't care how many calories I am shoving in my mouth heaven"". I am not a sports fan but I don't mind the noise because of the food. Sometimes the wait can be long but it's always worth it!"
Stephanie L.,"Huntington Beach, CA",36,22,29,4.0,7/12/2011,"Wow it's like 100 degrees out here in the I.E.! The minute we walked into BJ's in Temecula, a cool relief! I had the new seared ahi salad, very delicious and refreshing! My boyfriend and I also tried the artichoke appetizer and flatbread. The cold house brews where a  perfect match and made for a delicious experience! Hey, and Nick our waiter gave excellent service! Thanks Nick!"
C K.,"Medford, MA",4,27,,1.0,6/4/2012,"It hurst my heart to write this because I absolutely love BJ's!!  However, this particular location S-U-C-K-S!!   I gave it a few visits before writing a review hoping that each bad experience was just a fluke. I've come to the conclusion that it's not and it probably attributed to poor management and lack of training. They get your order wrong...EVERY TIME.  And it's not like I order anything special or complicated.  If you ask for something, you have to ask 4 different servers and maybe one of them will will help you, but usually not.  The wait time to get your food is ridiculous even in non-peak hours and the wait to get your check is even longer. The last time I was there the manager had to apologize to 4 surrounding tables about the crap service!!!   I am so disappointed because when we moved to Temecula from San Diego I was so excited that there was a BJ's up the street.  Now we have to go to the one in Carlsbad which is awesome, btw!  Or to the Yard House."
Melanie V.,"Murrieta, CA",0,37,,3.0,6/23/2014,The atmosphere was quite nice. It was fairly quiet and uncrowded for lunchtime on the day I went (today). I had the gluten free pizza. it was mediocre at best. I ordered it with garlic and spinach. I did not taste any garlic and there were about 5 small pieces of spinach on the entire pizza. I think the spinach was placed on after the pizza was cooked because it was just loosely laying on top of the pizza. The crust was thin (which I like) but it was not at all crispy. The pizza was bland. The iced tea was very good. Service was pretty good. i would definitely go back one more time to try something different as I did enjoy the atmosphere.  Hopefully I would make a better menu choice next time.
