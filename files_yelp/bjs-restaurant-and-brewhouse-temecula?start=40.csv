Robert S.,"Canyon Country, CA",36,1,,3.0,9/24/2017,Salt City.  I have been to and have always enjoyed many BJ's breweries. This is by far the worst one. Not very busy but extremely slow. When the food did come it was way too salty.   Two of us couldn't even finish our meals they were so salty. I will not come to this BJ's again.
Apryl H.,"Palm Springs, CA",274,96,824,1.0,1/20/2016,"Woohoo! Happy 28th birthday to my sister. I drove 7 hours to be with her, and a group of us went to the restaurant that her and her man (who turned 32 yesterday) picked. They really wanted some good stiff drinks and deep dish pizza. So, we waited 25 min., to get a table at BJ's. Didn't mind the wait at all, because it is a popular restaurant, especially for a small town on a Saturday night. Score! We got to sit in the bar! It's the little things when you finally get a night out together without children. We were ready to party it up! 2 birthdays, and I was celebrating scoring a great new job. The waitress instantly greats us, and I was thinking ""wow! What service."" We all asked to start with water, and I was SO excited about my sisters birthday that I blurted out the fact that she needs a recommendation for a great celebratory drink, and my sister included the request for a mixed drink without any vodka. She recommended a few and my sister and her man decided to go with the first two options. I thought they sounded horrible, so I asked for a bottle of Lindemans Framboise, with 2 glasses so I could share it with her. She asked for ID's, and took a while staring at my sisters man. She asked for my sisters ID, and cringed since it expired today. OK, then she looked at her mans ID, and happily exclaimed, ""happy birthday"" before refusing his drink because he didn't have DMV paperwork proving that he renewed it. Instead of feeling bad about ruining his (all of our) celebration, she pressured him to order a non-alcoholic drink. Blushing and pissed off, he shrugged and said, ""ah, maybe a Sprite?"" Of everyone in the group, GUESS who's ID she didn't even care to check?! I guess I look too old to get carded... I went against my feisty instincts to walk out before ordering, so we choked down mediocre chips & queso, pizza, some weird black & tan but with cider on the bottom, and the most enjoyable part of the night was the pre-bottled Framboise, not tipping, and the double Pizookie they threw in because they knew we were pissed. Ruined our night & will NOT go back. 2 stars because food was alright."
Che H.,"Temecula, CA",52,13,50,5.0,7/1/2017,"Great service and food on a Friday night from host and server (Philip Taylor). I am very detail oriented and so was Philip. The following day Saturday afternoon after deciding our service was pretty damn good we could go back! The secret to not waiting for a table is to ask to be seated outside. Although Philip wasn't my server he still came outside and checked on my group. Again, the food was fabulous!!! Ask for Philip when you come in!!!!"
Truthtelling R.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/30/2017,"Been here several times and everytime its a pleasant experience. We came on a Friday night around 9 and the greeter up front was nice and got seated in 10 minutes considering the fact it was busy.. the server was a pretty cool and the food was amazing. Definitely worth stopping by and checking it out. Also, please take into consideration when theyre busy, you arent their only paying customer and having a lot of things to do, idk what all these bad reviews are about..?"
Stephanie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",31,18,3,1.0,8/1/2017,"I was recently in here on Sunday afternoon. With my significant other, tell me why as soon as we walked in they kept on starring at us like if we did something wrong. We where seated very rudely. And the server looked at my partner differently. All I can say I felt discriminated and felt like I was in a racist environment. Why because I'm light skin and he is brown skin heads up even though I look white I'm 100% Mexican. I felt discriminated even though all the dirty looks where towards my partner. Will not be coming here anymore with these close minded people."
Alicia H.,"Murrieta, CA",116,22,2,2.0,3/16/2017,"I ordered via GrubHub and ordered the rib-eye with brussel sprouts and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  I also ordered the potato skins.  My order was correct and made it on time...it was still hot.  However, the rib eye was dry and bland and tasted as if there were no seasoning on it at all.  (A hard feat with a cut of meat that is so marbleized it comes with it's own flavor.) The mashed potatoes were salty, could've used that on the steak, and a bit dry.  And the brussel sprouts were slightly sweet, which I REALLY didn't like.  The potato skins were OK but the toppings were scarce.   This was my first time trying BJ's and looking at all the reviews, their quality/service is hit or miss.  Probably won't patronize their business again."
Karen S.,"Temecula, CA",21,20,2,2.0,1/31/2017,"Generally like BJs, but last week, after being stuck inside with rain for days, we wanted to sit outside for lunch, it was brisk, but sunny, I mean , it's so cal it's not that cold! We asked the greeter if we could sit outside, she looked outside, squished her nose, made a face and said. Ummm no.  Oookkkkk saving all those tables outside for the queen are ya?? Went down the street, next establishment said, no problem! Took us outside and were very accommodating . Silly BJs"
Mike G.,"Winchester, CA",1,6,,1.0,6/1/2017,"Food meh! Server was cool.  But hostesses were horrible. Skipped our name and if we don't say anything, we'd still be there waiting. Then they lied and said they called us when they didn't. And then laughed when they messed up and said they'd try and get us a table asap!"
Matt V.,"Temecula, CA",21,502,32,4.0,7/22/2016,"First of all I have to say I've been to a few different BJ's locations, all the way from San Francisco to Pasadena and points in between, mostly in LA and Orange Counties. Never had any major problem and they make one of the best pizzas I've eaten at a chain restaurant. Overall I really like the food here, no matter what city I'm in. We had dinner here on or around 7/19 and I really enjoyed it. Saw a guy picking up three huge bags of take out food as we headed to the front doors.  My wife had a hard time making a selection from the large menu but did end up ordering the Caprese Piadina with fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, in a toasted bread wrap with marinara sauce for dipping. It came with crispy shoestring fries which are her favorite, so it was a hit. I had the Bison Burger which comes with coleslaw, although not the traditional kind. The burger was cooked medium rare the way I ordered it (thank you!) and the slaw was like chopped cabbage with a dressing lightly drizzled on top, not mixed in or soggy the way some coleslaw can be. In fact, it was under dressed, a bit dry and the cabbage looked a bit dry and grey around the edges. Tasted okay but obviously had been prepped hours before. So I'm still a fan and have eaten here at least 6 times."
Mario R.,"Moreno Valley, CA",62,5,,3.0,7/30/2017,"Went to dinner with a couple coworkers, food was alright but the service was definitely sub par.. we felt rushed even though there were plenty of tables and booths available.. waitress seemed upset because I didn't like their craft beer and ordered a domestic.. only reason for the 3 stars is the food otherwise it would be a 1."
Kaitlin W.,"Jacksonville, FL",1,19,18,3.0,5/27/2017,"My experience was alright. The staff was friendly and informative, but my food was not the greatest. My brussel sprouts appetizer was burnt and way too salty. My seared ahi salad was good, but seemed to lack in some of the toppings listed, such as the avocado. The dressing tasted great, but too much! I left the last bit of my greens because they were soaked in dressing. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his food though. I tried some of the fries he got with his burger and those are addicting. Like I said, an okay experience, but nothing to make me come back (except for the fries)."
Sophia S.,"Murrieta, CA",0,8,4,2.0,4/15/2017,"I ordered a barbecue pulled pork sandwich. They completely messed up my order. The burger has BBQ pulled pork, BBQ sauce, crispy onion strings on a toasted bun along with coleslaw and fries on the side. When I got it, it was completely missing the onion strings. I don't get how someone can forget one of the most important parts of the burger. The burger was alright but it was missing a key aspect which ruined my meal. It also takes them too long to bring your food out."
Patty T.,"Temecula, CA",0,13,,3.0,11/21/2017,Rib eye steak ordered medium well was a charred hockey puck. Inedible. Fried fish was ok. Parmesan chicken was good. Mashed potatoes were good. Of course the pizookies are always good. Probably the only reason to go is for desserts. Not worth the wait for a table. Server was good.
Honest T.,"Murrieta, CA",63,37,1,3.0,11/10/2017,"Went there Veterans Day eve. Ordered a side salad. Very disappointed at the serving size, 4 oz. almost embarrassing to even serve it.lettuce is cheap!"
Caroleann B.,"Oceanside, CA",457,576,3900,5.0,10/9/2015,"The 5 stars is based mainly on our server, Natalie this visit.  Outstanding, and friendly customer service.  You Rock!  You can never get too many great servers these day! The food was very good.  I always enjoy the ice, cold strawberry lemonade.  My sister and two nieces took a sip and order the same on top of the drink order they had already placed.  We got the appetizer Piranhachili/Sriracha dip to start with.  We expected some spice, and although we didn't get the spice effect from the Sriracha it still had great flavor.  I had the Chicken & Spinach Quinoa dish and it was made perfectly.  For my dessert I ordered the BJ's Baked Beignet, with the request of the strawberries, strawberry sauce, whipped cream and ice cream be served on the side instead of on top of the beignet.  I try to enjoy my dessert slowly so I didn't want a soggy beignet.  This dessert was very delicious, simple and light.  I would definitely order that dessert again.  I would have the Quinoa Chicken bowl too, but my hope is to try something new each time I return to a restaurant."
Tatiana H.,"Murrieta, CA",199,3,5,2.0,3/31/2017,"I had purchased the Bison Burger... Totally thought it came with fries.... Nope. Instead it was paired with a CRAPPY iceberg lettuce salad with a ton of red onion and a tiny bit of sauce.... And on my Bison Burger, it was suppose to come with a specialty BBQ Sauce... I opened the bun and it was literally a drop of sauce. I had to ask for a side of extra BBQ Sauce.... Although our waitress was Great!"
Paul G.,"Marion, IL",149,28,4,3.0,8/4/2017,It's usually a hit or miss at this place not just for food but for service as well I had an incident where there was hair on my pazookie and I told our server but she never came back so I decided to just leave
Rowland A.,"Queen Creek, AZ",7,44,63,3.0,8/20/2016,"We were able to get seated right away there were only 2 of us. We started out with appetizers of fire roasted salsa and fresh made guacamole. The salsa was really really good. The guacamole was pretty good too and the chips were light and crispy with good seasoning.  My daughter ordered the bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and Swiss cheese. The first thing she said when she took a bite was that the bacon was amazing. It's pretty thick applewood smoked bacon. She said the fries could have been crisper and seasoned better.  I ordered the appetizer sampling platter(and they would not make any substitute on it)  as my main course. The boneless wings were okay. The mozzarella sticks were gross. My daughter tasted them and agreed that they tasted like stinky feet. And the avocado cream cheese spring rolls were bland. The warm artichoke dip was ok. Overall wasn't that impressed with the platter, I might have enjoyed it more if I wasn't already full from the salsa and guacamole."
Zully C.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,5,3,1.0,11/11/2017,This is the worse place you could get prime rib at Im from Las Vegas and I had better prime rib at ax Charlie's and it's $6 dollars chefs don't know how to distinguish from rare to well done. Waitress was friendly but food quality  go to Burger King if you want a better burger
Kelsey M.,"Sun City, CA",55,5,,3.0,8/3/2017,"Don't get me wrong, I love the food. The dining is delicious. But their kind of a sports bar place and they weren't playing any sports. I zipped over there today to catch the Cowboys play the Cardinals. I asked if they would be showing it and the hostess said yes. So I sat for a minute to wait for the channel to be changed. The tv's had baseball, commercials, and a football documentary. The game never came on. I left and everyone I talked with was very nice. But it's the first week of football and there's not a single game playing?? They haven't lost my patronage but I know where not to go for sports."
