JennineDavid B.,"Temecula, CA",13,71,122,4.0,10/28/2011,Love the fried artichoke & gourmet Mac n' cheese!  Also their custom tap rootbeer is very good.
Michael S.,"Murrieta, CA",1,36,,1.0,4/15/2014,I've had terrible service here before but Saturday was the last straw. My girlfriend and I both got food poisoning. This establishment sucks and we will never be going back. Complete joke.
Jen M.,"Temecula, CA",86,2,,4.0,7/9/2012,"Love the beer here, plus the BBQ chicken pizza is fantastic!"
Natalee H.,"Winchester, CA",77,17,4,4.0,2/18/2012,"Yummy pizza and the best shrimp tacos on the PLANET!!!  Awesome margaritas. Had one of my best meals ever here. Always have a good, consistent experience here!"
Tom V.,"Temecula, CA",0,251,32,4.0,2/6/2010,"I never had the inclination to go to this place, because I am not a fan of the BIG CHAIN restaurants. I prefer to spend my money at the more mom & pop places to help keep them afloat.  Friends invited us out and they chose this place for dinner, so we (wife and I) reluctantly went.  What a surprise! We enjoyed everything about the place, from the wait staff to the excellent food.  I had the opened face meat loaf sandwich and I hate to say it but it was much, much, better than my dear ol' mom's (RIP). The mashed/whipped potatoes and fried onion strings atop it made it fantastic! What a combination to ignite the taste buds. The wife had the pulled pork plate and raved about it and their BBQ sauce. I pride myself in my own homemade sauce so I got hurt feelings :-(  The appetizers were awesome, but quite expensive, especially the avocado rolls.  When we have a few extra bucks and don't want to hit one of the mom & pop places we will definitely return.  My wife is a GREAT cook and loves to do it, so it's hard for me to actually go out and pay big money for something she could whip up herself. But she needs a break once in a while too, so when together I let her choose."
Linda V.,"San Diego, CA",20,9,1,1.0,10/14/2012,"I am not sure if it is happening at all locations - but the pizza has changed.  It is a spongy white crust now and the toppings are sprinkled on.  We have been going to BJ's restaurants for 20 years at locations in Southern California and over the last couple years we have noticed changes in the pizza. The flavor is still good, but it seems like the restaurant is cutting corners. Management should look at the original recipes - including portions.  Yeah maybe the calories are less - because we have a lot less pizza!"
Jeff M.,"Temecula, CA",0,48,,2.0,12/5/2011,"Food is decent, price is decent, service is average to absolutely awful. It seems as though the slower they are, the slower the service. I've been there with it less than half full and it takes forever to get drinks, food, napkins, silverware, whatever. Now I'll only go when one of my friends/family wants to eat there."
Josh M.,"San Diego, CA",275,521,,3.0,8/22/2009,"BJ's was a real go-to place for lunch, back when there was only one in town and deep-dish pizza in San Diego seemed to have died out with the Chicago Brothers (and doesn't that reference just date me).  Of course, in 2009 Chicago-style pizza is available at every corner drugstore. BJ's was losing some of its cachet, and so they expanded their menu in two directions.  First: more sandwiches, salads and non-pizza entrees.  It hasn't reached Yardhouse or Cheesecake Factory levels yet, but I can see a future where that happens. Second, they jumped onto the beer wagon. I have to respect their attempts to make craft beer safe for malls.  They currently offer a decent selection of crafts and imports.  Perhaps more impressive, most BJ's now have special brewery nights when they host outside brew to pair with their food (and despite the timeless classic of pizza and beer, it helps that they expanded #1, above).  It's good bit of corporate generosity (and humillity), since their own chain-brew averages about two stars. Nitpick: if they mean to be taken seriously as a brewpub, they need to better educate their waitstaff on the type and flavor of a possibly esoteric tap.   Double nitpick:  please, don't mis-correct my pronunciation when I order a Smithwick's.  You're only helping to make future Irish pub waiters even more smug. Their service (as a chain) is a little odd; take-out is sometimes delegated to one staffer, and even when idle, undesignated staff will be unable to assist you.   Service quirks aside, another chain safe for the 'rents."
Liza B.,"Lemoore, CA",49,95,152,5.0,10/25/2011,I had an awesome experience!! It was my first time going after passing by the place many times. My grilled pork chops were amaaaazing and so were my mashed potatoes and veggies. Food and my strawberry daquiri all came in a timely manner I love how they were not stingy with the alcohol I find that a lot of places are that way. Overall I had a good time and my dinner was great I WILL RETURN AGAIN!!
Troy G.,"Temecula, CA",0,25,,3.0,2/1/2014,"Saturday evening so I understand the place being busy. But one dinner was pretty good, the other poor. My wife had the top sirloin and it was good but could have had a little more seasoning. But, she enjoyed it. I had the fish tacos, one was grilled shrimp and the other fried Mahi. The shrimp looked pink and not grilled at all. It was the consistency of shrimp you find on a shrimp cocktail, and just as cold. The Mahi was left in the fryer too long. Never fish was seasoned at all. The waiter was good and the beer cold. I'd suggest if you go there, order something they are known for."
Dee N.,"Fallbrook, CA",0,71,20,4.0,12/18/2011,"Good Food, Good Pizza. *Just triy not to read how many calories are in everything! Eeeek."
Jim L.,"Temecula, CA",155,190,42,4.0,8/27/2011,"Enjoyed the house beer here, but wished they had growlers for home pleasures. The food is good but happy hour is even better."
Frank R.,"Murrieta, CA",0,29,4,2.0,5/6/2011,Medium level food with horrible service the last two times.  I will not spend money there again.
andrew m.,"Murrieta, CA",7,40,,3.0,6/23/2011,"Love the food and the beer, but this place can get rather loud pretty easily. If it wasn't for that, this place would get a 4."
Sarah B.,"Wildomar, CA",6,1,,5.0,3/28/2012,"My husband and I visited here for the first time after looking at it for over a year every time we drove past it. Boy are we glad we stopped in! The food was amazing and the drinks were too! We ordered a small BJ's favorite pizza with artichoke and feta instead of olives and mushrooms, a jalapeno burger, and potato skins. The service was nothing short of spectacular. We were in a rush to get home to relieve our babysitter so my husband paid for our meal without looking at the receipt. We realized later that we had been overcharged for our pizza by $4. The next day we called the manager. He was extremely apologetic and mailed us a $15 gift card for a pizza on them! So impressed! We will be back for sure!"
Sarah W.,"Riverside, CA",0,90,9,1.0,9/19/2014,"Every time we eat at this place we vow never to return.  The service is always awful - having to wait over 30 minutes for the food to be delivered to our table!  We went back because I received a $15.00 gift card due to a previous order being screwed up.  If I had not had that card, we would not have returned.   On this visit, which was about 1PM on 9/18/14, we placed our order (Unlimited lunch - salad and soup) and boom out came the food!  We were pleasantly surprised at how fast it was delivered to our table.  HOWEVER, the salad had old, wilted, black romaine lettuce in it.  We ordered 2 more salads and again, old, wilted, black romaine lettuce in it.  We called over the Manager, he went and got 2 more salads.  The top of the salad looked fresh but the bottom of the bowl----- old, wilted, black rotten romaine lettuce once again.  Unbelievable!  WE ARE DONE.  NO MORE BJ'S AND THIS TIME WE MEAN IT."
Michelle W.,"Temecula, CA",0,12,,5.0,2/12/2014,"Loved the food! I had the Spinach and Artichoke Dip/Chips and my son got the deep dish pizza. Then we had the Red Velvet Pazooki for dessert which was delicious.  Waiter was really nice, too. Will go back for sure."
D B.,"San Jacinto, CA",29,135,,3.0,9/9/2011,I gave this place three stars because I really all around enjoyed this place. With that said there were a few things that ruffled my feathers. For example the parking. It took about 15 mins to find parking. The lot was super small and parking across the street wasn't an option. The service was ok with the exception of our poor waitress being completely over book on tables. We had a large party. It was a party of 13. The restaurant was completely full. Our food came out at different times about 10 mins apart . And we had to ask more than once for things. But I understand the place was over booked and understaffed. It was good company and a nice atmosphere. I will go back again. I had a flat bread pizza. It was delicious. They allowed me to make several changes to my order to make it just perfect. I appreciated that. :)
Chris R.,"Temecula, CA",7,1,,1.0,2/1/2014,"My wife placed an order for take of 5 hot wings,10 BBQ wings some mozzarella sticks and brushetta bread. Picked up my order, got 10 hot wings, 5 BBQ wings, my cheese sticks and no bread. I called to tell them and they offered to fix my order so I went back to get the missing items.  I was told that they would throw in an extra order of the BBQ wings for my trouble. So I get home and the BBQ wings are now boneless wings and no extra order.  All the food was relatively cold upon receipt. The cheese sticks were like eating breaded string cheese, they were that cold.  How do you mess up the same order twice and not double check what you are giving the customer.  After calling a second time it was offered to speak to the manager but i declined as i did not want to leave again and risk something being wrong a third time.First time ordering from bj's and if this is any indication of the quality control it may very well be my last.  Not a good first impression."
