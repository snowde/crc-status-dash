James J T.,"San Jose, CA",1,113,39,3.0,7/22/2011,Fun place to hang out with coworkers. Foods were average. Service was okay. I would chose Yard House over this.
Kristen E.,"El Cajon, CA",6,19,17,4.0,9/24/2011,Had to wait 20min for a table after 9pm on a Saturday night (do people ever put their kids to sleep?) but otherwise everything came out perfect. I was surprised actually because it was so busy I thought for sure that something with the food order would be wrong but she got everything right. All around a great BJs experience.
Shari B.,"Temecula, CA",10,32,21,5.0,7/12/2011,"Love this restaurant! I always get the balsamic chicken, it is always perfect. They have there own creation of root beer and it's the best out there. The place is loud and crowded on Fri & Sat nights which just means it is good."
Juan H.,"Winchester, CA",1,36,2,4.0,11/4/2013,I really like this BJ'S compared to other ones I've been too. Every time the service has been good and I like the jalapeño burger. My kids like it also
Meredith A.,"Temecula, CA",5,42,5,1.0,12/26/2012,Worst food and service to date. Will never come back!
Carlene n Cynthia S.,"Oceanside, CA",20,29,20,4.0,4/26/2011,"First time at BJs...The happy hour was a good deal. We had the avocado egg rolls which were delicious! And a mini Southwest pizza. I had the Jeremiah Red, which was tasty! The server was nice and offered to bring us ranch, which is always a plus in my book! Will definitely return."
Lori P.,"Murrieta, CA",12,17,,5.0,12/22/2010,Large menu! Great service! Absolutely amazing beer! Can't say anything negative! Try the Avocado rolls! AMAZING!!!
Kristine C.,"San Diego, CA",84,17,1,1.0,7/18/2010,Service was horrible. Our order was wrong even though the server verified the order two times and wasn't corrected until after our party was already done eating. If I could give 0 stars I would. I will not be returning.
Rick L.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",8,59,1,5.0,2/24/2013,"OK, B.J.'s is like my sweet spot, my home when it comes to restaurants. You can never go wrong with the items they serve. I love the environment, I love their drinks (they even have special non-alcoholic drinks sometimes that are so good), I love their desserts (famous Pizookie), and I love their food in general! I have been here probably a million times, and me and my friends would always come and share that huge pizookie or I would go with my family for food on weekends or to celebrate friends' birthdays. They work well with larger groups as well. Some of my favorite menu items, are the Ahi-Poke appetizer (so freaking amazing), the parmesan-crusted chicken, and the ""B.J.'s Favorite"" deep-dish pizza. I always go to B.J.'s when I see them in different cities, but this B.J.'s is the best. They have awesome customer service, and it's usually a pleasure to be there (I don't go when it's packed). I actually got to know one of the hostesses there named Sephra (I believe) from coming in so often, but they are all very nice workers!"
Robin E.,"Huntington Beach, CA",13,26,,4.0,2/28/2011,"So I've been to a few other locations in the past but, this is the first time I've gone to one for an actual meal. Usually I've just popped into one for a quick brew or company party. I am absolutely in love with there Harvest Hefeweizen! It is yummy! U don't even need a lemon or orange. That's impressive to me since I usually refuse to drink a heff w/o my lemon!  On this day however, I was drinking iced tea. For lunch I had the Grilled Chicken Club with a side salad & wedge cut fries. This was a verrrrrry yummy lunch! First the salad was crisp & fresh with the perfect amount of dressing. As for the sandwich......OMG! Sooooooo good! Presentation is your average. Nothing special. Didn't care. The sandwich is 1 large chicken breast half (or whole, wasn't sure but, it was plenty of meat) layed over two thick cut pieces of white bread lightly toasted with a yummy buttery flavor that the sandwich wouldn't be the same without. Inside to keep this yummy chicken company is more crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, & avocado with again, a perfect amount of swiss cheese to tie it all together.  Another yummy appitizer I've tried in the past is there Brushetta! I've been to Italy and had the real, fresh, oh so delishous brushetta & BJ's version stands bold beside it!  I highly suggest trying this place for lunch or dinner or just a night out if you're by one. U won't be disappointed!"
M Q.,"Ventura, CA",9,61,3,4.0,6/26/2011,The pizza here is great. But you need to go for the pizzookie. And now they have a red velvet pazookie? This is way too good to be true. Pretty amazing stuff. I love BJ's and this one it pretty good and efficient too.
Gabe J.,"San Diego, CA",28,149,199,5.0,2/12/2011,"Went to BJ's on a Friday night, was pretty busy but we were able to get seated pretty fast, the hostess & staff at the front were really on top of it and friendly. Ordered their coconut lemon martini and it was fruity and good, although the alcohol was minimal, but it was refreshing. They have a Jambalaya dish with rice and we requested a preference with pasta instead and they easily switched the rice with pasta, the dish was nice and spicy and dee-lish! YUM! Service was great and so was the ambiance.  Been to a few BJ's, San Diego, Huntington Beach and this one in Temecula-never a bad experience."
Joey H.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,320,3,5.0,12/5/2012,"our favorite pizza is at bj's. we were in temecula and decided to eat here. we had our usual. the vegetarian for me and the spinach and artichoke, gluten-free for her. the pizzas were perfect. the thing that made todays decision to eat here a great one was the sevice. we were fortunate to be seated in waitress britneys area. she was one of the best servers we've ever had, friendly and attentive with a smile. all servers should understand that service matters and she did. we made sure that her manager knew that she was special. we'll be back, thank you."
Phil P.,"Canyon Lake, CA",1,3,,5.0,11/16/2013,"My waitress was Carrie, and she was excellent...hard working and willing to go the extra mile to please. This particular BJs was the best experience so far and the food was great! Thank you Carrie!"
Rochelle R.,"Temecula, CA",2,3,,2.0,11/14/2011,"I usually love this restaurant but the my last experience put a bad taste in my mouth... literally.  I always order my burgers well done, especially now that I am pregnant and do not want to risk undercooked meat, but this time I received my burger medium.  When I asked the server to take it back she acted as though I had asked her to take hours out of her day!  I then realized it was the end of her shift and she was trying to finish her tables up.  Then when I finally got my burger back it was still medium-well and not well done.  At this point I gave up and just took the food home to reheat to my liking.   I would usually recommend this restaurant to others but after this experience I wll probably go somewhere else before I choose here again."
Paul L.,"Bear, DE",1,21,7,3.0,7/13/2011,"Decent food offerings, nothing really stood out on the menu, nor did it differentiate itself when I ate it. I had the fish tacos, and for the price, I really would have preferred Rub's over the stuff at BJ's. The staff was polite and understanding. Overall, it was acceptable, but not memorable."
Richard B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,,4.0,10/23/2011,We were out shopping yesterday and decided to get a bite to eat and get out of the heat. This was the perfect place. It was cool and dark we enjoyed a couple of beers and the menu provided a variety of options. There's a part of the menu that offers half sized starters which was a nice way to enjoy a couple of different appetizers without over ordering. We can't wait to go back!
Donna P.,"Oceanside, CA",3,68,3,1.0,2/10/2013,"I ate here several months ago.  The service and the food were terrible.  I ordered the flat bread pizza  and salad lunch and there were all of 3 small pieces of mozzarella on the flat bread.   It was more like crackers with dried out bits of cheese on it.   It was very dry.  I couldn't send it back or even complain because the server NEVER came back to ask how our food was so I ate the salad and waited.    Our drinks were never refilled.   At the end of our meal our check was brought over and I made a comment about the flat bread.  The server apparently went to get the manager.  The manager came over and he told me that I ate the salad so he would charge me for the salad.  : o   I told him I had no opportunity to send the flat bread back because the server never came by to ask how our meal was.  The manager was very rude.  When the server came back he made an apologetic gesture by  removing the charge for the salad, most likely unbeknownst to the manager. .   We did leave a tip but we paid $60 plus tip for lunch for 3 people and had a very negative experience."
PrincessPeac H.,"Cathedral City, CA",504,408,77,5.0,1/21/2008,"I'm not going to make any juvenile comments about the name of this fine restaurant chain...except that it's negotiable for an order of avocado egg rolls. Given this new addition, Temecula is well on its way to becoming the chain restaurant capital of the universe.  BJ's is one chain that I think can claim consistency among locations.  I feel the need to give them all 4 or 5 stars. I love BJ's because their menu has something for everybody.  I wouldn't worry about somebody in your party not being able to find something to eat.  The staff at this particular location were very friendly.  They have curbside pickup for takeout which is awesome.  My mom and I sat at the bar instead to wait for our order and the bar tender was really cool helping us figure out which of their weird beers we'd like to try. After all that I just said about consistency...this location has the spiciest avocado egg rolls I've gotten so far.  This could be good or bad depending on your preference.  Just FYI...I can out-spicy my husband, and he is from the spiciest state in the spiciest country in the world...and they were almost too spicy for me."
Dania R.,"Rosamond, CA",59,248,76,3.0,7/26/2012,"We ended up eating here as it was the only choice still open after 3 hours of Batman vs. Bane.  Our server was fantastic - cheerful, nice personality, actually seemed to not mind being at work.  That was a plus.  The beer selection is insanely massive and I liked seeing Stone and Lost Abbey selections on the menu.  The food menu is ridiculously long and took me half of a beer before I finally finished the novella and made my dinner selection.  Portions are massive.  Prices are reasonable - especially if you consider that you're probably going to get two meals from whatever it is you order.  And I guess there if you eat here often - sign up for the rewards club.  Free Piezookie.  If giant cookies and ice cream are your thing.  And let's be honest - who DOESN'T like cookies and ice cream?  Especially when they are free.  Either way - dining here was a nice experience.  Even in the darkest hours of night just before closing time.  I'd consider coming back.  I'm just not a huge fan of chain restaurants - which is why the 3 stars.  It's good - but I'm never blown away by mass produced food."
