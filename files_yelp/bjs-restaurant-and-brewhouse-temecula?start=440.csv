Dave L.,"Temecula, CA",5,11,2,4.0,4/22/2008,"I'm not big on chain-restaurants, but I AM big on beer so when BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse opened up in Temecula a couple of years back I was excited to give them a try.  Not only did I enjoy my first outting there with my family but have been back a few times since. My most recent outing was this past weekend.  It was my wife's birthday and SHE CHOSE to go there.  I'd say that speaks volumes about their food, but I'm sure it had to do with the Pizookie. BJ's in Temecula is on the corner of Ynez & Overland - across the street from Cosco.  It usually appears quite busy but the wait never seems to be very long.  Each time I've gone it was with a party of at least 6 or more.  The service for me has consistently been good and they've always been real friendly to my kids which is a big plus as you'd be surprised how often wait staff barely pay attention to the little ones.   Personally the trip to BJ's is always about spending some good quality time with my company and enjoying some good food & drink.  Personally I like most of their handcrafted beers, but my personal favorites are their Hefeweizen, Irish Red Ale, Tatonka Stout and nutty Brown Ale, but if you haven't had any yet I'd recommend the sampler.  Of course they do have other beers to choose from, but why bother? This past weekend we had a very friendly waitress who was more than happy to make some very good martini suggestions for my wife and my mother-in-law.  I can probably go on and on about the food, but its a chain restaurant and the faire is pretty standard.  Nothing to blow you away, but nothing will disappoint either.  The crown jewel to BJ's though is their Pizookie - a warm baked cookie served large and round like a pizza and topped with a mound of ice cream.  Needless to say the kids love this.   My only complaint about this particular BJ's is that the front door faces West.  So what?  Well when you sit down for dinner and the sun is setting... you better hope you're not sitting right in its path as everytime the front doors open you'll get an eyeful of sun.  Not very comfortable.  I try to be sure we're seated off to the side somewhere.  Other than that the atmosphere is great, the prices aren't outrageous and the staff friendly.  I've been there a few times and I have no reservations about going back for more."
Ann T.,"Patterson, CA",97,97,1,4.0,11/7/2008,I like the food.  This is like every other BJ's but the seating is very crowded.  I have been seated in several sections and on a number of occasions servers and other patrons have bumped into me.  This would not be a great place for small children or a large party due to the space concerns. Parking is very limited so try to car pool or plan to park at Costco across the street and walk.
Deirdre M.,"Chicago, IL",77,119,4,1.0,2/9/2010,"I love BJ's. They have amazing food, and the service is always great, but I am absolutely not a fan of the Temecula location.  I came here with my family for my late 21st birthday dinner and it was actually so terrible that we left. My mom, Dad, Brother, Grandma, Boyfriend and I arrived at about 6:30 (I called to make reservations, but they don't do them unless it's more than 8 people) and were escorted down the stairs to the main dining room. Did I mention that my grandma uses a walker and my dad uses a cane? Well Bj's isn't very handicapped accessible, so it was either try to meander through the crowded bar area and down the ramp, or go down the stairs.  Once we were seated, our waitress came over. She was definitely on something. My parents and I got a pitcher of beer, my boyfriend got an Arnold palmer, and the rest got water. About 15 minutes later we were served a single glass of beer and a glass of iced tea. Huh? When we told the waitress the mistake she came back with the Arnold palmer and some water glasses....which she proceeded to pour on the poor man at the table next to us. Then she just seemed to forget about our table, while I was down on the floor wiping up the water she forgot to tell anybody about.  At this point we looked around and noticed that everybody seemed to be getting bad service. Some people were finished with their meal, while the other people at their table hadn't even been served yet. We decided to leave. The general manager, Michelle, escorted us out the back door so we wouldn't have to go up the stairs, was very apologetic, and gave us a gift card. I felt really bad, but this wasn't the first time I've gotten sub-par service at this location. Love the restaurant, but they need to step it up."
Susan H.,"Chula Vista, CA",0,23,,1.0,5/19/2012,"Big group of kids wanted to go to BJ's but when told there was an 18% gratuity added to groups of eight or more they went to Applebee's.  Two theater groups were already there, the staff made room for them on the patio, turned on the heaters, treated them GREAT and did not add the gratuity charge.  I will never go to BJ's or recommend it to anyone ever again."
Alyx M.,"Temecula, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/30/2013,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Every time I have come here, I come with a group of people and most of them  like it for the food (I've had much better) and I ALWAYS leave disappointed. Not 1 time in the 3-4 times I have come have they gotten my order right, it takes over an hour for food to get to the table and then they ALWAYS mess up on the bill and charge for extra items (scam maybe) Its a shame because the beer is great and the atmosphere is great. but the service SUCKS."
Valerie M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,11,4,1.0,8/5/2014,"Let me begin with saying how bjs is typically my favorite restaurant. Today I went in and ordered my usual. When it arrived it came to my table burned, the French fries, the bread, and my PULLED pork was chopped and I received very little. When I asked for a new version I had to wait another 30 minutes while everyone else has finished their food and at that point I no longer wanted it. When it finally came to my table I was approached by a very rude lady who I'm guessing was the manager, I told her how now it was pointless of me eating it because everyone was ready to go. Instead of offering a fix to the problem she simply took the plate and walked away instead of apologizing and trying to make it okay because this restaurants quote is ""they give the best never compromise"". Yet here I am upset, still hungry, and only got it taken off my check but not because she wanted to but simply because I didn't touch it. Will never be coming here again and they just lost a regular customer."
Sarah P.,"Tustin, CA",9,24,4,4.0,10/7/2010,"Ate there for lunch and it was delish! The service was a little slow, but it was lunch time rush. The appetizers where so good, and so was the soup!"
Mike D.,"Temecula, CA",2,82,2,2.0,6/29/2012,"This would normally be a 4 star experience but major kitchen problems.  Come on get the order right no cheese!  Gluten free pizza which you pay more for my daughter ordered with no cheese (lactose intolerant) the server entered it correctly but the cooks screwed it up and put cheese on it.  I watched three other tables send food back that was cooked incorrectly, come on your better than this"
Allison V.,"Fallbrook, CA",19,24,3,5.0,10/31/2010,Friendly service and great food to boot. I have eaten here twice and both times blew my socks off. Must try the broccoli cheese soup! Their lunch specials arw also a great deal for great food.
P K.,"Oceanside, CA",46,67,5,5.0,2/2/2012,I was so happy when BJs finally came to town. The food (especially the buffalo chicken pizza) is great. You can't go there and not get a pizookie.
C S.,"Newport Beach, CA",426,376,34,1.0,6/21/2010,"GOOD SERVICE, BUT THE MOST HORRIFIC FOOD I'VE EVER HAD AT A BJ'S.  AVOID!! YUCKKKKKKKKK!   Do the chef's here make food with a blind fold on?  I'd cook better in my sleep!!"
cody r.,"San Diego, CA",10,9,,4.0,5/29/2007,"Not bad.  The wait can be long (especially on a Friday or Saturday night), but the outside patio for appetizers and drinks can be nice. Their food is good, some things are better than others.  I enjoy the avocado egg roll appetizer, the pizzas - I've tasted the Great White (chicken and Alfredo sauce) and the BBQ Chicken - the beer is brewed in the restaurant and is typically fresh, plus they have Stone Arrogant Bastard on tap. They also have a dessert called the Pizooki (sp?) which is damn good!"
Ron D.,"Winchester, CA",23,18,15,4.0,5/24/2010,"Great beer, good food.  This location is not the best for service but they seem to slowly be getting better.  If you want excellent service go to the bar and have Cherelle (I hope that's how it's spelled) the bartender take care of you.  When she was a waitress your visit was the best it could be.  i wish all waitresses could learn from her.  Don't pass up a Pizzookie for dessert."
sofia b.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,120,,4.0,2/14/2010,"They have a great selection of beer and they have their own brand that is really delightful. I recommend the nut-brown and the grand cru when they have it. There food is okay, it's a chain so expect chain food. but happy hour is great and their mixed drink list is awesome."
Connie M.,"Winchester, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/6/2011,Good food but the WORST SERVICE consistently that I have ever experienced at any restaurant!  Never can get anyone to wait on you and when you do- it takes forever to get your food!  Mostly my problemmwith this place is the servers are obviously not trained well and listen up managers - that is your responsibility!  I just gave you my last chance to see if things were better and they are the same.  Your employees are in a huddle talking to each other and not handling customers - it's beyond belief!  The Yardhouse down the street from you is amazing!  Their  service is always amazing and the food consistently good!  You get seated immediately and waited on immediately!  BJ's you have lost so many customers to the Yardhouse because they know how to run a food business and treat customers and that's the bottom line!  Terrible and frustrating is what I think of when I think of BJ's.
TruckTruck G.,"Augusta, GA",79,70,71,3.0,1/11/2010,"Their beers are mediocre, but their beer list of other than house brews more than makes up for it, especially Belzebub. The food is good and they've got a nice outdoor patio for spring/summer nights and a lot of TV's for sporting events. The waitresses are always very nice and attentive and I've never had a a bad experience w/ any of the bartenders."
Alisa G.,"Erie, CO",25,42,,2.0,4/3/2008,"I am so sick of this place. They are fooling people by claiming they've got Chicago style pizza. For all your Southern Californians- this is not it. The food is kinda blah and overpriced, appetizers are decent, happy hour specials are- do they even have happy hour specials?? No one ever remembers what they are- $1 off beers or appetizers or something- they certainly don't want to ever tell you what they are. The service has gotten better since they started, but seriously, they had no idea how to deal with large crowds when they started. I will give it to them- the pizookie and root beer are both quite good. But that's the same at every BJ's."
Reanna R.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,188,81,5.0,2/24/2010,My boyfriend & I love this place.  No matter how full we are from the great food we always have to get their famous treat!  Service was great!
Mark J.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",0,4,2,1.0,11/25/2012,I food was Horrible just horrible. Ribeye was cheap cut of meat. The whole meal was so bad. We had a group of 5 people & will never go back. This was the 3rd time we tried this place.
Jewel S.,"New Providence, NJ",30,48,3,5.0,2/18/2010,"Fantastic pizza, amazing beer, and PIZOOKIE. Nothing could be finer."
