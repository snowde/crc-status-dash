Lost O.,"Temecula, CA",0,6,,3.0,10/21/2012,I love the beer and pizza.  Service on Friday and Saturday leave allot to be desired and they should up the staff those nights.  Often the food is not made with fresh ingredients and will get served cold.  Regardless of these negatives I will return because I love the micro brew.
Marilyn C.,"Temecula, CA",3,3,2,3.0,3/1/2012,"go when its not crowded. they barely refill your water when their busy.  they dont give you complimentary bread like other restaurants. the gourmet mac n cheese sucks, as well as their chicken fried steak. i've tasted better ones at denny's. their pot roast and fish n chips are delicious and my favorites to get. avacado egg rolls are a must for a starting appetizer."
Jim D.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,49,,4.0,9/9/2012,Great food and beer! This place never disappoints! Lots of tvs for games and great happy hour.
Scott B.,"Anza, CA",75,87,115,5.0,12/4/2008,"We always go for a BJ pizza that is(its the best) ,after Pole Position kart racing .All the food,seating is NICELY DONE Great Bear too. It can get full make reservations.Call me for large Queen Palms."
Laurie K.,"Temecula, CA",0,16,,4.0,2/2/2010,"I love the ambience of this place....except when it is super-crowded....which is a lot of the time. If you can go when it is not so crowded it is a great place to sit and enjoy some refreshing drinks....love the ice-tea.....some exceptionally good food (parmesan crusted chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes...YUM) and of course, don't leave without trying the Pizookies......they are melt in your mouth delicious.....good for sharing but you probably will want your own. (Triple chocolate is my favorite)."
B-ry P.,"San Diego, CA",28,85,,4.0,11/29/2008,Good pizza. Piezookie is the shit. I wanna try that berry beer.
Rich K.,"Murrieta, CA",36,149,15,5.0,12/20/2008,"We really like B.J.'s. Enough that we went there last New Year's eve. We like the drinks. We like them a lot. The food is plentiful and tasty and we really have to try hard to save room for one of those pazookie's. I usually get the Jambalya and have never been disappointed. It can get a bit crowded on Friday and Saturday, but we've seldom had to wait long. This is a good place to come for lunch too, and have a sampling of different beers with your lunch. All in all, one of our favorite spots to eat."
Chris H.,"Temecula, CA",4,36,20,4.0,1/21/2010,Great service. A lot to choose from on their menu! I like the mini pizzas. Wife likes the stuffed baked potatoes.
C C.,"Murrieta, CA",0,44,,1.0,9/21/2011,Old school BJs in the LBC and Seal Beach were awesome. This one is a sign of good things gone bad.  Poor service and management. I will never go back to this one.  Soon to be another shell in the strip mall ghost towns of the IE.
Christine L.,"Honolulu, HI",94,67,419,3.0,7/31/2010,"mini pepperoni pizza and caesar salad lunch special works for me! kids love the mini burgers, flatbread appetizer pizzas are filling, but we've definitely had better jambalaya. appetizers and service are ok... and pizookies are yummy fun!"
holly h.,"Temecula, CA",4,6,1,5.0,7/8/2011,"From start to finish it was a great experience!  our food came out fresh and delicious!  our server, Kali was very friendly and provided great service.  I will surely be back!"
Derrick B.,"San Diego, CA",97,103,16,2.0,7/19/2008,"BJ's was fun the first time, but after that it was a let down. The only good thing is the pizookie . The second time i went there with a friend (and last), It took the waitress 10 min to bring out our beers even though we were there for lunch and the bar just was about empty! and on top of that, some chick was giving some guy head in the bathroom!, classic!!"
Christine S.,"Sonoma, CA",2,2,,5.0,7/11/2011,Had a Rehearsal Dinner for 50 people on July 2nd and it was wonderful.  I was a little hesitant at first but the relaxed atmosphere made everyone more comfortable to mix and get to know each other.  The staff was very personable and attentive.  They went out of their way to fulfill my every request.  The food was great and the feedback I got from my guests was all positive.  Thank you BJs!
Claire A.,"Murrieta, CA",76,41,7,1.0,8/5/2008,"I've been here several times (because other people wanted to eat here) but I've never liked any of the food. Last time I ate there my boyfriend got food poisoning from the shrimp pasta. I will not be going there again. Don't wear heels unless you want to slip and smash your face on the over-slick floor. I don't know why they don't do something about that. The crowd is all loud obnoxious people that my parents would probably refer to as ""yuppies."" I can't stand this place."
Sunny V.,"Temecula, CA",0,2,1,5.0,3/28/2011,"Every time my husband and I come here we have the best experience. The staff is always very friendly and attentive and the food can't be beat. For example, we came here last night and as we were walking up to the door, a server taking out curbside to-go food to a car greeted us with ""Hi! Welcome to BJ's!"" Nice touch. So we usually sit at the bar. My hubby is a big fan of beer and the bartenders are never shy about letting him sample a few before he settles on a pint. I'm a big fan of the Berry Burst Cider and just found out last night that they can blend two different beers as well to make a custom concoction tailored to your tastes. They have a few blends listed on the menu, but really they can do any kind you want. I like the Berry Burst Cider blended with the BJ Beachouse Blonde. Yummy! We are big sliders fans and usually order them if they are on the menu at any restaurant we go to, but have found the Angus beef sliders at BJ's to be our favorite. We add cheese to them, as they don't come with it regularly. Next, it's on to the Sweet Pig pizza. I like to substitute pepporoni for the ham. I don't know how they get the crust so crispy, but however they do it, it's working for me. Good job BJ's!"
Jane W.,"Aptos, CA",2,12,1,3.0,10/3/2008,"I've been to BJ's a handful of times, as it's one of the ""nicer"" locales in my area. I've really enjoyed their salad's and of course the Avocado rolls. (I could just order two servings of those, and be a happy happy camper.) They do have a great selection of beer/wine/cocktails, albeit a little pricey. I've had their ""Chicago"" style pizza, and it was ok. I was a little disappointed at how THICK the slices were, because I was not even able to finish one. It was the Buffalo style, and I also thought the seasonings were a little much. (Too spicy if that's possible...even the ranch side did little to tone it down). So when I go back, I'll stick to the salads and Avocado rolls, with a glass of Sterling Chardonnay."
Rich J.,"San Diego, CA",0,35,,4.0,2/14/2008,"We like B.J's. Unfortunately, so does everyone else, so there can be some long lines on Fridays or weekends. The atmosphere is ok, though it can be noisey. Service is good and the prices are reasonable. Try the beer sampler for something different. And, of course, save room for desert!"
Nadine T.,"Temecula, CA",0,11,,4.0,2/7/2009,"I decided to give BJs a shot, and I really liked it.  They have some lunch specials from $5.95.  I hade the soup (clam chowder) and sandwich combo (which was supposed to be the grilled chicken club) for $6.95.  The chowder was a good, generous portion with lots of clams.  The sandwich I had was good too, but it wasn't what I ordered.  The waitress gave me the wrong order and when I asked her if this was the correct sandwich, she said it was and we ate it.  The bill came, and it turned out it was incorrect, but she really didn't seem to care.  The sandwich was good, but not what I wanted.  Anyway, it was a pretty good lunch and I'll probably go back.  Also, their strawberry lemonade was yummy!"
