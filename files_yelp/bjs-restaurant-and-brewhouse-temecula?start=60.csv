Shar R.,"Solana Beach, CA",1,7,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Portions are not consistent, service sucked, and food was not fresh. In addition we were treated badly when we couldn't find any seating except for the bar, we got treated very badly since we had a toddler with us. Our waiter ignored us. Won't be back."
Yvonne N.,"Citrus Heights, CA",49,10,4,2.0,8/20/2017,Don't order curbside.  Food is very cold.  Never again will i order from here.  Paid a lot and food was very bad
Dennis D.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,,5.0,8/6/2017,"This brief note of appreciation is for Mr. Jeffry Bush and his staff at BJ's.  On Saturday, 5 August, Mr. Bush graciously donated 30 pizzas to the non-profit HOMES FOR OUR TROOPS event celebrating the ground breaking for a mortgage free residence being given to a tragically injured veteran.   Mr. Bush's community service and activism helped welcome double amputee Army Sgt. Christian Valle, his wife and four children to Temecula.  It is these acts of kindness that define us as American's.  Mr. Bush helped in all facets of the preparation of this delicious meal.  Please thank him, if you have a moment while dining at BJ's, for his graciousness and hospitality to a deserving Wounded Warrior."
Ricky M.,"Murrieta, CA",125,5,,5.0,11/5/2017,Great hospitality by Jillian our server for my cousins 20th bday. Party of 16 and she handled it well; drinks were poured before they were to the bottom food was out in a timely manner. Great server!
Turner W.,"Temecula, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/4/2017,"I came into BJ's looking for a quick burger with my good friend. We were greeted by a very kind hostess who sat us and made us feel welcomed even though there was a timely wait. I was very happy with the front end service, so I asked for the name of that hostess, which was Cammy. Although when it came to our waitress it unfortunate we were served by a girl named Ashley. We were given a hard time about our orders but luckily our food came out at a decent time. She never came to check on our food or drinks the entire time we sat. We were sitting over an hour both needing refills. I needed ketchup for my burger & eventually had to resort to asking the hostess Cammy who was walking by. Cammy graciously went out of her way to get me a bottle of ketchup. Ashley did not stop at our table once until giving us our tabs. After we payed cash for our meal she never returned with the change. We waited until we were finally frustrated and left. We have come to BJ's numerous times and have always had excellent service, but this time we felt so disrespected by our server that we will think twice about coming back."
Rebekah B.,"Escondido, CA",193,148,47,3.0,6/8/2016,I come here for the desserts and drinks. It's a good place to meet up with friends and order appetizers and drinks. The happy hour is decent. Worth checking it out if you're in the mood to just hangout. The flatbread is good. I always enjoy the salads. Desserts are a must!
Frank S.,"Murrieta, CA",58,41,36,5.0,7/6/2017,We haven't been to this BJ's in a while. On Fourth of July my wife and I went to have dinner. The service was excellent and the food was good. We will definitely be going back for more.
Pia G.,"San Diego, CA",274,33,26,3.0,10/24/2016,"Came here with my sisters to have a nice dinner since it's my first time here Forgot to take a picture of my food but, for appetizer we ended up getting the avocado spring roll. Which was not bad on my part tasted like a zesty pizza with sweet sauce My sister ended up getting the chicken Alfredo but, while she was eating she found a hair in her food! Now I don't know if the could were properly using their headwear but, they need to have their hair properly tied so it doesn't happen again.  I ended up getting the shrimp penne and mashed potatoes! Absolutely loved it! Hit the spot very well had to take it home.  Overall this place was good for my first time service was great. Couldn't get the servers name but, he was amazing very helpful."
Melissa M.,"Temecula, CA",0,15,,5.0,7/20/2017,I had to give a shout out to Paige. I care for people for a living and I can go in there thinking I don't know how I'm going to make it thru the rest of my day. But then the way she tends to every whim and detail fills my cup and I sailboat of there happy belly and full heart . Thanks Paige!
Meredith C.,"Temecula, CA",58,4,,5.0,8/12/2017,Went here on a Saturday with a party of 6 we got sat immediately and had the BEST server! I don't remember his name it might of been Evan but he was super attentive and helpful! Definitely will be back thank you so much
Bertha C.,"Temecula, CA",10,7,11,3.0,7/21/2017,"Update: I really do appreciate Jeff's expedient follow up on my original review. Jeff was so kind as to give me a gift card as a good faith effort to make things right for customers and this gesture fows a long way in that regard. I wasn't looking for this, rather, I wanted to share my experience as a way to empower other consumers to advocate for what's right. Getting your money's worth matters! Especially when considering the power of consumer choice!"
Alexis C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,74,116,5.0,4/8/2017,BBQ glaze boneless wings are my go to! This BJs has an amazing outdoor seating area perfect for spring. It's always busy so I love the preferred waitlist option and even the order ahead feature for dine in.
D A.,"Winchester, CA",31,117,302,2.0,10/9/2016,It was okay. There was no hostess in front when we entered. Appeared she was leaning over in one of the booths talking with someone. The food was not memorable. I guess they don't sing happy birthday to anyone anymore. She just put the pizookie on the table and walked away. It felt cold and not warm and inviting.
Cheryl T.,"Temecula, CA",287,6,4,5.0,6/16/2017,Enjoyed the food! EXCELLENT customer service from MELISSA!!! You the best!!! Lets go to Disneyland !!
Torres Y.,"Perris, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/30/2017,"This is an honest no exaggerated review at all. My husband and I went for dinner at BJ's on Friday the 27 of November. I ordered the shrimp penne, he ordered the chicken Alfredo. It was horrible. My food didn't have flavour, and the shrimp taste like they took it straight from the sea and onto the plate. Instantly felt like throwing up. I'm a pescatarian and cook salmon and  shrimp a lot. The smell of the shrimp was beyond what I've smelled. My husbands food the Alfredo sauce was very watery. The noodles were hard and stuck together. He said the chicken taste awful. I'm not one to complain so I didn't say anything. The waiter was very nice. I think he knew there was a problem When I ask for a to go bag the look on his face said it all. I threw the food in the trash on the way out. This review doesn't even deserve a one. I read a few other reviews that were good. Don't know if we went in on a bad day or what, but whatever the issue there shouldn't be no issues when you dine at any restaurant. We spent $50 and still tip the waiter."
Elizabeth P.,"Wayne, PA",135,6,2,2.0,3/29/2017,"Just had an ABSOLUTELY unpleasant experience at this BJ's location. It started off with our server being very inattentive to our table. He looked like he was serving too many tables than he can handle, and was showing attention to what seemed to be like every table but ours. Then, we ordered our favorite sliders with cheese, and we received them with no cheese. We nicely asked for them to be redone with cheese, and we got them back with cold slices of cheese added to the now cold original sliders. Pretty frustrated at this point, we asked to speak to the manager and I explained to her our situation. She kindly returned with the sliders fresh and exactly how we wanted them. The rest of our entree's were also very good. But the manager and our server seemed to be uninterested in the troubles we were experiencing. Our food was delicious, but we spent a 2 hour trip that was expected to be a quick dinner at BJ's, excitingly with a promotional free pizookie. Even after our complaints, we had to flag down our server for the check.  Overall, our food was very delicious and we were very pleased with our meals. But the service was extremely poor from start to finish. Even after bringing our problems to a managers attention, we lacked the experience we usually never fail to get at a BJ's restaurant. The table behind us received excellent costumer service and even gave recognition to the manager about how great their server was. We wished we could experienced the same. We definitely will not come back to this location."
Andrew C.,"Murrieta, CA",3,37,3,4.0,5/22/2017,Surprising that this time around the food was actually really good. Try the new prime rib! AND my gluten free pazookie actually was cooked perfectly (hasn't happened here in a while). AND my server was great. Not sure if every other time was bad or if they finally made changes. But I'm glad for once it was good
Bonnie G.,"Murrieta, CA",17,5,1,3.0,12/14/2016,I ordered soup and a salad and it says large bowl of soup well I got a small cup! On top of that they didnt give me any dressing for my salad so I could t even eat it! What a waste of 10$!!!! Only changed the rating because the business manager contacted me and was very nice and resolved the problem. Thank you very much. :-)
Leanna H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",118,10,2,5.0,7/14/2017,The waitress Paige was so attentive and sweet! I would go to this place just because of her! Food is always great but service is the cherry on top.
Kevin M.,"Riverside, CA",219,15,,2.0,2/12/2017,"Consistency was the biggest miss Hosts - seemed inconvenienced by everyone who was walking up to them. You are the first people your guests see. Greet them with a smile. Bartenders - no. You guys need to taste your own drinks one night after close. You couldn't mix your way out of wet paper bag. Wait Staff - my waitress took our appetizer away before we were finished and filled up my whiskey lemonade with water. Granted the whiskey lemonade tasted better after adding 20 parts water. See bartenders. Kitchen - on point. You guys rule. Expo - very friendly quick and helpful. I was very disappointed in my experience and will not be returning. I would recommend yard house for a similar atmosphere and menu, but far superior service."
