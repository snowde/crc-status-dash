Amy H.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",80,9,,5.0,7/2/2017,Food and service was absolutely amazing! Phillip Taylor was our waiter and I could not ask for better service! One thing I can say I respect a server for taking children's order first and bringing it out first! He was very responsive with any requests. seemed as if he knew what we needed before we asked! Thank you Phillip keep doing what you do!
Natalie D.,"Murrieta, CA",9,15,3,1.0,8/18/2016,"For takeout I Ordered sliders, they come with mustard pickles lettuce onions and ketchup. NOPE just ketchup!!!! We ordered a salad with blue cheese dressing...NOPE we got ranch, my husband got a tavern cut pizza, it was good until you got to the soggy center. The WORST part about this whole story you wonder? THE MANAGER  handed my husband the food, the person who you should rely on for quality! Not this place! So many bad reviews too SO...I have contacted corporate, hopefully they will clean this place up!"
Sheena H.,"Hemet, CA",2,19,4,1.0,9/6/2017,"Never again will I come back to this restaurant. Thought taking my mother-in-law and her friend here for their first time, after being on the airplane for 6-7 hours, was going to be great but they were totally dissatisfied! One ordered the chicken alfredo but her broccoli was hard as a rock, noodles were dry, and her side of bread was hard as well. My mother-in-law ordered the shrimp/asparagus penne, that came out dry with only 3 pieces of shrimp out of the whole dish?!  (yes because of what was going on with the other orders we actually counted). And her bread came out as hard as a rock too. We asked the server if the bread was suppose to be like that and she said ""yes"". She went back and made us some new ones anyway and this time it came out perfectly soft (so it wasn't suppose to be like that like she said). The only thing that was delicious was the Avocado Eggroll. Overall,  waitress' service was good."
Audrey N.,"Riverside, CA",34,81,52,4.0,8/13/2016,"My fist time going to this Bjs. Usually when I go to Bjs I order Pizza. Today I decided to try the Balsamic grilled Chicken and I was not disappointed.  By far the best meal I've had at Bjs. I also had the strawberry mojito which was good too. The service was also good, our waitress was very nice. Next time I'm in the area ill go back."
Bris B.,"Temecula, CA",0,11,,4.0,6/17/2017,"BJS BJS BJS! It is not your traditional BJ, but for a fact, they got food that almost matches up to that! Besides there amazing pizookies, i had there tacos and those were wonderful as well. I also tried their pizza and wow thats some good pizza."
Richard B.,"Temecula, CA",14,4,1,5.0,6/30/2017,Great service from Nicole. I really like their ordering app from the tablet the drinks and food came out amazingly fast!
Gina R.,"Temecula, CA",0,13,,1.0,5/6/2017,"BJ'S has gone down the shithole for sure! I feel bad for the waitresses, they are very pleasant. Food was horrible!!!"
Ashley Z.,"Murrieta, CA",86,4,,3.0,9/7/2017,"Service here is so intermittent. I've come here multiple times over the past year and always seem to be sat with a server who is less than attentive. Last week, I had a server who brought us the wrong appetizer and the wrong desserts all while ignoring our empty glasses. Tonight, hoping for a better experience, I am again disappointed. Our server seemed on it initially for a drink order. Then the server spent 20 minutes speaking with a patron she knew COMPLETELY ignoring her other tables. I was able to step away, find another waitress for help and have her get the attention of our server. This waitress, the one who was actually helpful (I believe her name is Catherine), is the only reason I give this BJs a mediocre review. CATHERINE spent all night keeping ER contact with me to make sure our drinks were filled and we were content even though she wasn't our waitress. The manager walked by and checked on us, but I didn't want to complain when our server would be able to hear it. If my family and I decide to return (won't be anytime soon) I will request to sit in Catherine's section."
G H.,"Temecula, CA",0,20,1,5.0,6/1/2017,"I really like this BJ's. Service is always great. Janae was my server this time and she was awesome. I had the new Prime Rib French Dip. It was really good. Thanks.  Just had another great meal here. I'm never disappointed. I love their Tomato Bisque. Also tried the new Slow Roasted Pork Chop. It was delicious and doesn't taste like ""chain restaurant"" food at all. Samantha S. was my server. She did a magnificent job."
Eric N.,"Murrieta, CA",0,14,1,5.0,5/28/2017,"Awesome environment, great food, wide beer selection and friendly service.  Come here often and always leave satisfied. BJ' s is to be commended for openly Supporting their local Law, Fire and 1st responders. Buy a hero a beer program was a great idea. Thank you."
Edgar J.,"Sahuarita, AZ",44,6,,4.0,1/20/2017,"Service was excellent, drink specials are awesome and their crafted beer is good. Deep dish pizza was really good. I recommend this place for cheap fun during happy hour. Avocado egg rolls are amazing too!"
Carol B.,"Glendora, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/13/2017,"Stopped in on our way home from Pechanga. Got seated right away.  Lots of empty tables. No one came to offer us anything for about 15 mins. Servers were attending customers all around us several times with not even a ""I'll be right with you"" acknowledgement. We got up, returned our silverware and menus to the hostess and walked out.  Very disappointing."
Lance C.,"Murrieta, CA",29,17,8,5.0,5/8/2017,Stopped by on my lunch break for chicken and fried waiter was very attentive and got me in and out and was very acomidating would recomend for a very good lunch break meal took 14 minuets to prepare food which is very good for a sitdown restrant.
Helen W.,"Murrieta, CA",1,375,4,4.0,8/9/2017,"After our disappointing visit at a local brewery/restaurant, we ventured over to BJ's for a comparison.  We had been to another location several times, but our second here after about 8 years.  The food menu is much better here.  I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya, which I've enjoyed before.  This version was drier, saltier and the rice was hard.  There was plenty of protein though.  My bf had the pizza, with meatball, sausage and white and red onions.  It's very thin and the center was very limp.  Not very filling or satisfying for the $18.50 price.  I enjoyed the berry cider, it was sweet and fresh tasting.  My bf also enjoyed his blonde ale.  The $3 dessert of a chocolate cookie with pecans and 2 scoops of ice cream and caramel drizzle was excellent.  It was the Tuesday special, so we went for it.  For the $7 regular price, maybe not.  Overall, a positive experience, except for the very pricey pizza."
Tom H.,"Temecula, CA",1,6,,5.0,5/1/2017,"Pretty much my favorite place to go for happy hour, and has been for well over a year.  Drinks are great and the food is great, but the employees are pretty much the best around (shout outs, in particular, to Claudian, Elise, Tommy, Taylor, Dominic, Justin, Audrey, Priscilla, Melissa, and Julie). Do disregard the misinformed toolbags saying that the bartenders don't know how to make drinks by the way, because that couldn't be less true.  They're great at what they do.  Like, Tom Cruise in Cocktail great at what they do.  Except that they actually do it in real life, and to my knowledge they're not Scientologists.  And they're probably all a little bit taller.  Anyway, props to you all, and stay awesome."
Angelica B.,"Murrieta, CA",58,84,30,1.0,2/5/2017,"We were very disappointed with our food . This place usually has delicious pizza . Well that wasn't the case tonight bc the pizza we had was absolutely disgusting ! It was extremely greasy , and the dough had a weird consistency. This place has gone down hill . We won't be back !"
Martha M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/26/2017,Boss took us out to lunch to celebrate Admin professional day and this was a very good choice! Restaurant was very presentable and food was great and the Pizookie was absolutely fantastic! Service was also good. Definitely the best Bj's I have been to.
Kellen C.,"Riverside, CA",7,23,8,3.0,1/2/2017,I don't know what it is about this place. Maybe it's the food just being alright. Maybe it's the fact that I had to circle the parking lot 5 times to finally get a parking spot. Then just parking at Costco across the street and then walking my butt across the street to get in line to have a 50 min wait just to get sat to have some mediocre food. Ugh. I don't really care for the place. But hey. It's food.
Jimmy W.,"Sun City, CA",1,37,19,2.0,2/28/2017,"Came in on a Tuesday night - not busy. Server was nice but the food quality, especially the sides was poor (old potatoes - hate dark baked potatoes... celery on wife's plate was old and dried up. After we brought that to our servers attention, they swapped out. Really ... guess they find a lot of people who just put up with that .did I mention our server was nice."
Claudia N.,"Temecula, CA",75,18,30,2.0,10/26/2015,"I was really disappointed with my visit. The wait staff took a long time. My root beer was flat and had no ice when it finally arrived to my table. I had the angel hair classico, it just didn't have a lot of flavor. I really wanted to like it. Note that I'm not extremely picky and I usually rate places really high; check out my other reviews.  The worst thing was my boyfriend's steak. Extremely overpriced for what he got. He asked for medium rare and it came out extremely tough and medium well. The presentation was very poor as well, and I'm not really that picky about that. For that price, I'd rather go to Karl Strauss and get an exponentially better steak for an extra dollar.  I left very distraught and wished we chose another place to eat. I don't know if we just got really unlucky, but we won't be coming back for a while."
