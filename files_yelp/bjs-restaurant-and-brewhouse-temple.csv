Howard S.,"The Colony, TX",13,356,440,4.0,12/17/2017,"This is a very good restaurant. I used to live in Temple, and we came here often. Stopped in for lunch on a car trip today and it remains a very good restaurant and a very good BJ's.  Our server was very good and friendly, but service seemed a tad bit slow. I had their spicy chicken in soba noodles and my wife their bacon cheeseburger. My dish was very good. The burger was good except the top bun was very dry and fell apart.   The coffee was a very good blend.  I like BJ's because they have an extensive and varied menu with great craft beers."
Terri K.,"Cameron, TX",0,15,1,2.0,8/30/2017,"I've been to several BJ's and this is one of the bottom rated. Maybe its because I come at the ""off hours"" in the afternoon. Wait staff is pretty good but the afternoon cooks seem to be off more often than not. The food is often over cooked. Today was not a good experience. Today I first ordered lemon peppered bone in wings and caeser side salad. After about 15 minutes I was told they were out of any bone in wings. So I reordered for fish and chips. After about another 20 minutes these were brought out and were more plastic than cooked fish. Way over done and lots of breading. One of the managers delivered it. After complaining and sending them back another manager said they cut off the waitress that was explaining when they saw the meal. I reordered a flat bread pizza appetizer.  They finally turned out close to right when it came out. I have been here several times in the mid afternoon and it seems the afternoon cooks need a bit more training."
J B.,"Plano, TX",13,39,58,2.0,12/26/2017,"We eat at BJ's pretty often.  Stopped at this location on the way home so we could meet up with family living near here.  The food was definitely not the best we have had.  My shrimp scampi had so much oil in it I could have filled half a glass.  The quinoa bowl was 95% rice.  The pizzas were not fully cooked (doughy on bottom).  Chicken on the salad was cold and the coffee was not good. The burger was below average. The kids burgers meat was half the size of the bun. Also, the gluten free pizza may have been cross contaminated with gluten (had symptoms of gluten consumption after eating).  Our waitress was really nice (only reason for the 2)."
Emmanuel O.,"Killeen, TX",0,3,2,5.0,12/17/2017,"It is definitely my number 1 place to go, atmosphere is great and quiet to go and enjoy of some amazing food with your family or friends. Price is great for their service and quality of food. Go check it out and enjoy!"
OJIBOY N.,"Grovetown, GA",18,17,19,1.0,12/5/2017,"We used to make special trips just to eat there - especially for the ahi poke tuna and deep dish pizzas. But the past few years the quality and preparation has drastically spiraled. Last time we were there, we spent almost $80 and ate hardly any of the dishes. The tuna was older with silver skin, the pizza was blah, the speghetti n meatballs was yuck, etc. We drive all the way to Austin now"
Yvonne J.,"Houston, TX",7,76,19,5.0,8/12/2017,"Love the service, the food, the specials, the beer! Plus I have the app on my phone where I can put myself on the waiting list before I arrive."
Ashley Y.,"Austin, TX",58,2,,5.0,12/5/2017,Love BJ's! We go here all the time and the food/service/drinks are always on point! A little pricey but worth it
Skip D.,"Elm Mott, TX",1,28,2,2.0,10/23/2017,I had ordered their Pork Chop and waiter returned telling me they had no pork chops. I had eat at BJs in Waco before and ordered Pork Chops and they did not have them. Any how I asked for diet coke... nope Pepsi only. So I order a steak medium well. It arrives and cut into it and blood actually squirted from the steak like the heart was still beating. They bring another and I ask for hienz 57... don't have it... only A1. The steak was just okay. The asparagus was very tough. Mashed potatoes were good. There was no offer of any reduction in the price for all the problems. I do not recommend this place at all.
Amber H.,"Temple, TX",0,4,,4.0,12/1/2017,"My boyfriend and I love coming to this place. Their rootbeer is creamy, mozzarella sticks are to die for & their burgers are heavenly! It's a little expensive but it's worth the price! The only downside is that the service has not always been the best, it is normally really good but has occasionally not been amazing. Overall, really good though. I dont enjoy their pizza though, too expensive & not very good. But i would still recommend this place!"
Jay J.,"Temple, TX",0,6,,3.0,10/16/2017,"This is the first terrible experience we have had at this location.  We sat down at 4:55pm and there were very few people in the restaurant.  The waitress was running around frantically for no obvious reason.  She finally came over and took our order 15 minutes after we sat down.  Our food (burger and California chicken club) showed up 35 minutes later.  The California chicken club came out with brown avocado and tasted terrible.   The only positive is that the burger tasted pretty good.   We sat there for another 15 to 20 minutes waiting for the server to bring the check.  We really wanted dessert but didn't want to wait another hour for it to show up.   We have never had this issue here in the past.  I'll update my review if I ever return and receive better service and food.   Update- The manager called the next day and offered an apology.  He went out of his way to explain that is not how they do business and wanted to make things right.  Because of this, I am changing from 1 star to 3."
Shawn M.,"Temple, TX",88,102,129,2.0,6/28/2016,"Extremely overpriced food from a place trying to be Cheese Cake Factory.  Service was okay, if a bit on the flamboyant side.   The décor is terrible, like I said they seem to be wanting to look and feel like a Cheesecake Factory and just aren't pulling it off.  The drink prices are ridiculous, with something as simple as a margarita costing almost as much as an entire adult sized entrée.  There are just better more local places to eat at than here.  I would even recommend the Applebees over this place, since the food is about the same quality but it's not as expensive."
Sharon B.,"Killeen, TX",3,34,17,5.0,10/12/2017,OMG! Tonight is the first time trying their ribs! They were absolutely delicious. I normally get the sliders and fries but my husband surprised me with dinner and got something different. Whenever I want ribs....this is where I will be going!!!  Compliments to the chef!!!!
Kenneth B.,"Harker Heights, TX",9,20,41,2.0,7/8/2017,I was not impressed by my experience at BJ's today. The service was horrendous and the food was not at all what we anticipated it to be. It took forever for the waiter to bring water to the table after requested and the refill on drinks took awhile as well. The beignet tasted more like a fried pancake than a beignet. Was definitely not a good experience and will likely not be revisiting this establishment again.
Myrna D.,"Temple, TX",0,17,,4.0,4/10/2017,"Great, low-key, relaxing place! Beer is what's offered at BJ restaurants so a variety is on tap. Canned beer and growlers are also available. There is no food cooked on site though a food truck is there at times on Fridays ( I've been told). The lack of food is where that generates the four star rating, otherwise I really like the place. You can play games such as chess, dominoes, cards. All in all, a fun way to spend an evening."
Cari B.,"Temple, TX",3,27,5,2.0,8/3/2016,Decent food Horrible service $3 sodas--can't get someone to refill!  Need better trained servers!
Meme M.,"Southlake, TX",0,2,1,4.0,7/1/2017,"Let me tell you....we just happened to walk in this BJs while driving thru. And well and be hold, we came across some pretty good, satisfying food!!!  I'll say, as we were enjoying a glass of wine...we came across some tempting off the menu specials our sweet waitress named Courtney advised us.  THE 'NEW' SOUTHERN COMFORT CHICKEN SANDWICH was VERRRRRY tasty!!! It satisfied my taste buds!!! :)))))) Coming out soon!! A MUST TRY!!! Let the pic say speak for itself!!"
Aus-Tex B C.,"Austin, TX",19,27,9,1.0,6/23/2016,"C'mon guys, this place has no pride in the quality of food they serve. I ordered my niece a cheeseburger kids meal and clearly told the guy meat, ketchup, cheese, pickles. We sat down to eat and there was no ketchup, no pickles, burnt cheese. Food wouldn't even serve my dog! The smiley potatoes smelled like feet and of course anyone who has kids knows if it's now how they ask for it, good luck getting them to eat it! Ugh! On to the next one. Ordered the broccoli cheese soup bread bowl. The bowl was burnt all the way around and hard as a rock!  Would not recommend this place, at least not the one in Temple, TX. Very disappointed especially from such a large chain.  Have more pride in the food you serve BJ's especially when there's 6 people in the restaurant, guess that should've been a red flag right there.  Cracker Barrel, please start staying open longer, especially in Temple, TX."
Brodie B.,"Santa Rosa Beach, FL",20,43,26,1.0,12/26/2016,"My wife's food was cold, once she received it.  The pizza my son ordered took 1 hour to come out. Mine was Luke warm. The excuse was we're busy. We didn't see a manager on the floor trying to correct the situation.  They still wanted to charge us."
Dawn B.,"Coppell, TX",104,217,94,3.0,4/4/2016,"Apparently it was around prom time and we were also in time for a concert that many people from the surrounding area had come to just like us.  So glad one of my friends knew you could seat yourself at the bar area.  We did that and avoided the seating line.  No rave reviews here or bad things to say.  It was ok. Our server was a little stretched as it seemed she was serving tables spread across the restaurant.  I had the California club pizza that was  very tasty or maybe I was just really hungry.  ;-)  I did like that it was a deep dish pizza with crust that wasn't under cooked. That's it, this place was pretty standard."
Alice S.,"Nolanville, TX",37,14,1,2.0,6/18/2017,"This place is generally one of my favorites...  The Avocado Egg Rolls are on the top of my face foods list, but definitely not if you order for take out.  I guess since they can bury the boxed so you are surprised when you get home the quality is not important.  Literally- they were doughy and soggy.  Not an option when you need to grab and go!"
Francisco A.,"Austin, TX",28,23,1,5.0,4/25/2017,"I have always been a fan for BJs ever since I tried them back in 2015 for the first time in Austin, TX. I was very impressed in their quality food and beer selection, which I love that about them. Their beer is AWESOME. My Husband and I go regularly on our date nights away from our 5 kids. It's a very clean location and staff is friendly and attentive. Their dishes are superb - delicious. Waiters and waitresses are very attentive kind and gentle, which I LOVE. Keep up the good work!!"
Brittney V.,"Lower Pacific Heights, San Francisco, CA",1,17,6,5.0,5/25/2017,Great beer. It's so many items on the menu it will take you forever to decide what you want. But the food is pretty good overall.
Mike B.,"Temple, TX",0,9,1,4.0,6/15/2017,We ordered deep dish pizza and mistakenly got wrong. However floor manager came and apologized. I really appreciate that.
Vergie W.,"Harker Heights, TX",35,8,9,5.0,4/19/2017,"I went to BJs for the first time for lunch on Monday and it was great! First of all I ordered the pizza and lucky for me, it was half off pizza Monday. I ordered a large half and half, half BBQ chicken, half great white & it came out fairly fast. The pizza was awesome! I will definitely be visiting BJ's again."
Moriah L.,"Temple, TX",0,4,,2.0,2/4/2017,"Sad to say, the quality of the food has really gone downhill in the last year. (Greasy, wrong orders, soggy sandwichs, wrong temperature). Maybe change in management?  I know I never see the original manager checking on customers anymore. I belong to a fairly large meetup group and we go out to eat once a month.  To date, we have always gone to BJ'S. However, due to hour long waits for seating, and being told they no longer book reservations for groups, and the food being hit and miss, we will not be going back. Staff and servers are usually polite but seem overwhelmed at times. Also decor needs help. We brought to one servers attention, since he couldn't find the Mgr, that a picture on the wall over our table was covered in mold or mildew under the glass. Last month,  it is still there. Until they improve, it's not worth the price."
Scott B.,"Belton, TX",0,13,,5.0,9/9/2017,"It had been sometime since my wife and I had eaten here but decided to go in late August. Service was great, the food was very good, and we really enjoyed ourselves. I will keep them in mind more often."
Yamil C.,"Manor, TX",30,80,134,4.0,8/9/2016,"I love the beer choices here and the onslaught of meals on there menu. They have a ton of meals almost on the line of too much. Many people have the pizza, i personally love there calimari. There burgers are very good as well. I am a fan of fries so if you order them, I would recommend the steak fries over the thin fries they are more filling. Can you tell I'm a fatty. swing by get a beer and enjoy your time at a calm, casual restaurant."
Becky M.,"Bastrop, TX",23,7,,4.0,5/18/2017,"Had lunch there yesterday for the first time.  I absolutely recommend dining at this establishment!  Loved the cleanliness & decor.  Staff was more than accommodating & helpful.  Most importantly, the food was amazing!  I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich & there aren't enough words to describe how delicious it was.  Fries were good.  Would like to have them crispier & will ask for that next time.  The others at my table had burgers & they were grilled to perfection.  We all agreed that we will make this a regular place to eat.  Can't wait to try their steaks and pizza.  Their menu is a book & is awesome because it gives the caloric info.  Reasonable prices & a great bar!  Epic number of craft beers to try! You must go!  Lastly ask to sit in Melinda's section.  She's remarkable!  Also Steve, the manager, is extremely gracious.  The entire dining experience was great!"
Noel B.,"El Paso, TX",329,173,130,5.0,7/27/2016,"My wife and I frequent to this BJ's as it is the closest to Killeen.  Every time that we have visited, we have never had to wait for a table for no more than 10 minutes or a bar seat opens up.  The facility is clean with attentive workers.  Our food is delicious and hot.  We always enjoy coming here and will return."
Isaac R.,"Bell County, TX",1,54,1,2.0,1/2/2017,Nothing special. Food is just ok and the staff leaves a lot to be desired. I can't recommend it to anybody.
Melody M.,"Killeen, TX",103,195,1235,2.0,8/17/2014,"I've been here quite a few times and keep hoping that the food gets better.  Has it?  No.  I even tried to order different things in hopes of finding a winner, but I always seem to find myself on the losing end.  This place certainly has the ambiance and promise of good food, but everything I eat here tends to suck.  If you visit their website and look under the ""menu"" tab, you'll see them state, ""And of course, everything tastes better with BJ's own handcrafted beer.""  Maybe that's what I need.. a beer, to drown out their mediocre food.  Well unfortunately, I don't like beer. Our waitress was friendly, but it took a long time for our meal to arrive.  Although no fault of her own, she kept apologizing for the wait.  When my chicken fried steak finally arrived, it was overdone and very tough to chew.  Plus, the mashed potatoes were cold in the middle.  Immediately, I waived down our waitress to complain to which she offered me another one for free, but I was already tired of waiting enough as it is and disappointed; downright hangry. Hey BJ's, I think this is where we part ways.  Unless some friend of mine wants to drag me in here again sometime, I'll just have a cocktail or a Pizookie -- your only saving grace."
Eugene G.,"Oak Ridge, TN",229,9,2,4.0,1/31/2017,Nice upscale atmosphere with a really nice contemporary vibe. Food and service is good while not being absolutely spectacular. I will return.
JeraLyn W.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,2,,2.0,3/19/2017,"After noticing that everything else that sounds appetizing was closed on Sunday, we chose to eat at BJ's Brewhouse.  We have never had this bad of service or food, but we are compelled to let some patrons know that maybe Sunday is not the day to be here.  Been here other times and never did I have the server forget the things we needed, when we specifically asked for it.  It seemed that from the time the hostess was busy socializing and forgetting our silverware, the meager service from our waitress that gave us a different name than what was on our receipt, to the measly soup bowl we shared in a up-charged bread bowl that only had a cup of the soup we ordered goes to show that not every time do you get what you pay for or deserve. Only redeeming part of the meal was the Belgian Ale Bottled beer and the Twisted BLT starter salad.  Will be going back when around, but will not go on Sunday.. and will try our best to make sure to use a server that hasn't failed us like this group of staff..."
Brittany W.,"Dallas, TX",0,5,,1.0,10/4/2016,"Decided to give this place a second try today - the first experience dining here was not very impressive. We place our orders and I decided to set a timer to see how long it took to get our food this time -(last time took forever). We waited - waited and waited. The table behind us that came in 10 minutes after us received their food before we did. When we finally got our food - it took 39 minutes - it was disappointingly cold. So cold that I couldn't even stomach eating my burger. Husbands food was also cold. The server came to check on us and I told her the food arrived cold and that I couldn't eat it and all she said was - ""we can remake it for you or I can offer you a beer"".... Really?  So she comes back with our check and says, I took your fries off your bill for this inconvenience. Um - what about the burger that I didn't eat? Shouldn't that have been taken off? Guess not   Additionally - the whole time we were waiting for our food the wait staff and kitchen workers were being rambunctious to the point where it was unprofessional and distracting. They stood around gossiping and talking instead of - um maybe delivering a hot plate of food to a paying customer. I won't be going back. Should have learned my lesson the first time."
Kaui C.,"Copperas Cove, TX",80,123,583,4.0,5/28/2016,First Timer at BJ's restaurant yesterday. It was very good. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and clean. Went during work hours on a weekday so it was pretty slow. We got seated and greeted by our waitress immediately. I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad. It was amazing! It was perfectly dressed and the Ahi was so delicious! They were kinda stingy with the ahi though. If the salad is 14$..I expect more than a few small bites of ahi. The salad was so good though that it didn't bug me to much. The other items on the menu looked great as well! I can't wait to go back and eat here again!
Ronika A.,"Indianapolis, IN",39,99,99,3.0,8/15/2015,"The boyfriend really likes this place; it's just okay to me. I think it's a good place to go if you aren't familiar with your dining partners' tastebuds-plenty of choices ( a step above Applebee's, Ruby Tuesdays, TGIF). I had the Angel Hair Classico with shrimp and the boyfriend had the shrimp scampi pasta. Both were okay. He wasn't a fan of the craft beers but found the mojito quite tasty."
Yvonne B.,"San Angelo, TX",0,37,,4.0,12/31/2016,"I love the eat at BJ's specifically for the Parmesan Chicken. The atmosphere is always welcoming and comfortable. Due to the multiple big screens in the restaurant, you can dine even if your favorite team is playing-you won't miss out on the game."
Jesse B.,"San Antonio, TX",25,223,61,4.0,2/6/2015,"Ignore me concerning dine-in because this is all about take-out. I've been in Temple/Belton for a few weeks on business and I recently got to the point that I did not want to keep going out for meals. I remembered that BJ's has great salads and they have take-out! I tried varying my take-out places, but BJ's has been amazing every night: always on time, always fresh, always prompt take-out providers and that's why I keep going back. Even the manager was incredibly kind and helpful.  What makes my take-out ordering so helpful is that BJ's has an online ordering system!! Wahoo! I can set my time for pick-up, select what food I want, customize it, etc. It's fantastic. Not all items seem to be on the site, but it does make my life a lot easier when it comes to wanting to order food ahead of time."
Marken O.,"Temple, TX",27,10,4,2.0,11/30/2016,Basic food for high prices. The only good thing is the cookie.
Karen S.,"Temple, TX",0,4,8,5.0,11/29/2015,Fav place in this town to go... Can get a little loud. Great food and beer. Kids love the root beer and cream soda too Use the app for quick service and discount
