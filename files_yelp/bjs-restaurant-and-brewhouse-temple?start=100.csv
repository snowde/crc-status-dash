Josh S.,"Overland Park, KS",0,28,1,2.0,4/22/2015,"Stopped in for lunch, soup and salad that took an hour and a half.  Salad was ok, soggy croutons and the soup portion was rather small for a bowl and salty.  I did order the all you can eat soup and salad but ran out of time at the 1:45"" mark for a second bowl.  I left hungry.  I'd just go to five guys."
Seth M.,"Modesto, CA",12,65,1,5.0,1/31/2015,"Tough to get a seat any time after 6pm, but these guys have awesome beers, a pretty solid and friendly staff, a huge and consistently good menu, and the best pizza I've ever eaten, hands down. Love the sweet pig and pepperoni extreme with the Abbey  Tripel on tap. Everything is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for here. Just go."
J H.,"Temple, TX",0,13,9,4.0,8/18/2013,"My fiancé and I visited here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty packed, we waited about 15 minutes to be seated but it wasn't a big deal. Wait staff seemed tense and rushed, maybe because of the large crowd? Anyways after half way through our meal the waitress chilled out a bit and was more relaxed. We started off with the potato skins covered in cheese and bacon, wasn't much cheese or bacon. I had to scrap up pieces that fell on the plate and put them on my potato wedge to make it worth eating. The flavor itself was good, I just wish they weren't so greedy with the cheese and bacon.  My fiancé ordered the texas style chicken fried steak which she enjoyed. Came with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes , everything seemed fresh and tasty.  I had a small deep dish pizza with Italian sausage , bacon and pepperoni....Delicious! I finished all but two slices. My fiancé only fished a quarter of her CFS. She had a raspberry lemonade? And I had an orange twist which is a mixture of orange cream soda and some other fruity berry juices. Our total bill was $46 which I didn't think was all that bad for the two of us plus we had plenty of left overs and free refills that I took advantage of :) but I wouldn't bring a whole family out to eat here.  Glad Temple has this joint!"
Debbie K.,"Austin, TX",6,7,1,1.0,1/24/2015,"HORRIBLE service! This was my first and last time to eat here! I ordered thru the mobile app for curbside to go. When I got to the restaurant to get my order, there was no place to park. I had to park at Taco Cabana and walk.....so much for curbside to go. When I got inside I along with a couple other people stood at the to go counter for 10-15 minutes before anyone even came to see what I needed. The girl behind the counter was just looking at me like a deer in the headlights. The food was cold. Will never go there again!!!!"
Laura W.,"Lewisville, TX",259,81,11,5.0,7/30/2014,"I discovered this BJ's on the way to Austin from Dallas.   The staff was wonderful, friendly, and attentive.  Free wi-fi for customers and half-price wine on Tuesdays were the icing on the cake!"
Katherine R.,"Temple, TX",29,10,1,4.0,12/7/2014,"This place has something for everyone. I like their atmosphere, it's good for families, girls night or a date. I've tried several items in their menu but my favorite is always the California flat bread pizza and all their pizzokie desserts are awesome. Customer service is for the most part pretty good."
Doanna M.,"Ennis, TX",12,24,102,4.0,5/12/2013,"This place has the best food. We had bruschetta, chicken tacos, jambalaya, basil flatbread pizza, crispy jalapeño burger. Beer taster of pale beer, root beer, orange soda, black cherry soda, Creme soda all were quite tasty and the sodas had free refills and are made in house.  Now the only thing was the service was so slow. I realize it was Mother's Day but good heavens we spent 2 hours in the restaurant."
Lou S.,"Delmar, NY",1,65,8,2.0,8/14/2014,"Late review as I was just reminded how bad the service was. Great looking place, after waiting 10 minutes in a mostly empty place, placed my order. Got a beer which was good, sandwich was ok. Never saw my server again, noticed hosts just talking and relaxing. When server came back 20 minutes later asked if I wanted the check; yep, glad to get out. Managers really need to fix the staffing problems."
Rick S.,"Temple, TX",61,12,13,4.0,9/11/2014,Try the blackened bison burger.  They'll even put some blue cheese on it if you ask.  A real winner.
Aliyah K.,"San Antonio, TX",244,430,294,3.0,12/4/2012,"Now that the kid is older we have stopped here a few times on our way to SA back from DFW. It is nice to rely on a clean bathroom, friendly service, a sensory overload for the kid and an easy in-and-out back to the highway. I was disappointed by the wedge salad more than once, I forgot it was not worth the calories.  Don't bother. The pizza however is pretty awesome and is really what BJ's is known for. The ""Kid's Menu"" has quite a few options and the staff interact nicely with her. We are clear upon being sat that we are there to eat and go and the staff try to accommodate, which is appreciated.  Overall, it is hard to resist a stiff drink, beer or wine on a 'Sunday funday' or 'Black Friday' for that matter but it is nice to eat, run and get on home.  The staff seem used to travelers too."
Debi K.,"Temple, TX",0,10,,4.0,9/26/2015,"We enjoy coming to BJs, the menu is nice and varied, food is well prepared."
Esperanza M.,"Temple, TX",97,42,78,4.0,11/10/2011,The restaurant is trendy and the food is delicious.  Lot's of items to choose from on the menu; classic American cuisine!  Great place for lunch or happy hour!
Benjamin B.,"Temple, TX",28,10,2,2.0,7/5/2014,I eaten here 3 or 4 times. I want to like this place. There beer is the best thing they have. Food is ok service sucks bad.
Brad D.,"Wylie, TX",41,97,22,5.0,4/29/2014,"I stop here frequently on my drives up and down I35. I've never had a problem, and always have a good meal that comes out quick so I can get back on the road. I'll be back soon!"
Kimberly B.,"Copperas Cove, TX",37,62,3,4.0,3/3/2014,My husband and I ate here for the first time during lunch. The lunch menu was diverse and reasonably priced. The food was delicious and the service was decent. Our bill was $22 for the two of us.  I would definitely return if in the area again.
V C.,"San Francisco, CA",5,152,20,5.0,3/15/2014,My fav: avocado rolls and ahi tuna salad!
Heather N.,"St. Petersburg, FL",2,27,,5.0,5/10/2014,Great good nice staff.  Love the variety of the menu for food as well as drinks.  Their root beer is very good I always order that.  Giant potatoes are yummy w broc and cheese very filling.  Nice size portions.  Great rewards program too.
Michael L.,"Georgetown, TX",3,7,,4.0,3/9/2014,Great food a little pricey but very tasty. I highly recommend trying the parmesan crusted chicken. Their moscato is really good as well.
Nathan W.,"Porter, OK",0,61,,4.0,7/30/2011,"I really like BJ's. The main thing I don't like is I feel it is a little pricy for what you get. Portion sizes are usually generous for the entree, but not so much for the appetizers. They have a HUGE menu selection. Probably the largest selection in town. Taste has always been great."
Duane H.,"Round Rock, TX",1,113,27,2.0,2/25/2011,"My wife & I ate at BJ's one Saturday, mid-afternoon.  Although we got seated within 5 minutes, the service took FOREVER!!  It is no exaggeration when I say we waited 45 minutes between getting our appetizer and our main entree!!  Yeesh. That being said, the food was very good.   The ambience is nice too, but it is very loud.  (Hello... it's a bar!!)  Imagine the big booths and high ceilings of the Cheesecake Factory, with big & bold decorations and very clean bathrooms, and combine it with a microbrewery with lots of different beers on tap. We'll try it once more, but if the service takes a long time on our next visit we won't be returning anymore after that."
