Zach D.,"Temple, TX",88,21,5,5.0,6/20/2013,Great food and great service every time I come here!! They make a fantastic Bloody Mary and the beers are great. Make sure you ask for Jared for your server
Ana M.,"Killeen, TX",17,21,10,2.0,8/13/2014,"super disappointing!!!  Ive eaten at many BJ's..most in California...this one SUCKED!  the server didnt even greet us at our table until we were seated at least 15 minutes...the apps were ok...but they screwed up our order like 3 times!  they were only burgers, how can you mess up burgers!!  they did!  wont be back!"
Casey B.,"El Paso, TX",2,11,,1.0,8/26/2012,"Super disappointed. My husband and I went to a BJ's in san antonio and were in love with it, and when we found out there was one close to fort hood we were excited to go! We ordered the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, okay, kind of boring. The Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad was god awful. Rubbery mozzarella balls and tasteless tomatoes. I was hoping for smooth creamy mozzarella with yummy tomatoes like the one in San Antonio, but nope. Also, the balsamic reduction was wayyyy too thick. It stuck to the plate like glue, so I couldn't enjoy it. I ordered the Chicken Al La Fresca (the under 575 calories entree) and I was so disappointed. Chicken was flavorless, rice pilaf was so bland it tasted like plain white rice, and there was no arugula on mine, they put spinach on it instead. I didn't even eat it. My husband ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. That was the one good thing out of everything.  The manager came to talk to us and I expressed my disappointment. He asked if I wanted anything, I said no. Why would I want more gross food? I asked him to take it away. No refund, just a deal with it attitude. Will never be going here again. Ever."
Carol J.,"Southlake, TX",2,48,9,3.0,9/14/2013,Burger was good .Fries great!  Fish taco was fair- tortilla was like cardboard . A corn tortilla would have been better!   Beer -good.
Michael M.,"Warrenton, VA",5,105,1,1.0,8/17/2012,"This was my first stop on my Texas vacation.  I looked at their menu online and was excited to try the jalopeno burger.  I was seated promptly but it took 10-15 minutes before our waiter came to the table.  This was unexcuseable because it wasn't busy.  We didn't leave because I really wanted the burger.  Getting our food took around average time so no complaints there.  As for the food, everything on my burger seemed fresh but had no taste.  Nothing on it stood out.  I was expecting a kick from the fried jalopeno's but I got nothing.  That, on top of the slow service is why I give them 1 star.  PS- the waiter was friendly, just slow."
Claya C.,"Temple, TX",0,13,,5.0,7/23/2013,"I had an excellent experience both times I went to this restaurant. The food was amazing, although a bit pricey. I will definitely be going back."
Nagel S.,"California, MD",144,134,234,4.0,9/23/2012,Decent beer selection (I liked the Jeremiah Red). Got the Jambalaya and it was very filling and a good amount of spice. Just enough heat to have to wash it down with some more beer! :)
Naomi R.,"Flowery Branch, GA",2,3,1,2.0,5/1/2012,"I'll start with the actual layout. It is nicely set. My waitress was really nice; though we were done almost with our whole meal before she came by to pick up plates (at least that's what other places do). The price for the food is too much. I had 2 appetizers, a bar drink, and 3 kids menu items along with the kids cookie desert and ended up paying over 60 dollars. This is high for me when I've paid that or less and fed more people. The food was not the best I've tasted, but maybe that's my Hispanic taste buds speaking."
Margo M.,"McGregor, TX",66,59,24,5.0,3/25/2010,"I love the atmosphere, the food, and the BEER!  Great burgers, French dips, and southwestern egg rolls!!! Must try the beer."
Jim B.,"Dallas, TX",74,79,7,5.0,4/11/2012,"One of my top 2 favorite places to eat in Temple if not eating mexican food.  Service for me has always been excellent, Lindsay was not only excellent, but very easy on my eyes! food came out fast & as always the quality was outstanding, portions are huge! finding your way to their parking lot can be an adventure when your just passing through!"
A. M.,"Waco, TX",3,24,,5.0,8/11/2014,"I avoided coming here at first because I thought it would be a ""beer-burger-football"" place. Well, it is, but it's better than that. I sat at the bar where I learned about the 4 beer sampler flights they offer. I found some beers I liked and one I really, really didn't, but that's just my personal taste. After hanging out for a while I wanted something crunchy and light and decided to try their beet & arugula salad, which was very good. I also ordered a glass of their black cherry soda, which was also delicious. All of the bar staff was very friendly and checked on me regularly. I usually avoid chains, but I think I'll come back to this one."
Melanie J.,"San Antonio, TX",191,324,974,4.0,5/12/2010,"Love stopping by when passing through Temple.  Seem to always get the same thing-an appetizer flatbread pizza, although I do change it up quite a bit.  Luckily for me, the always accomodate.  I usually order the Italian Basil flatbread and what I substitute is grilled chicken for the sausage with artichokes to add as an additional topping.  With a side salad, I'm in my ""happy place""!"
Methane C.,"Temple, TX",1,70,4,2.0,10/14/2013,"The Fish & Chips must be frozen and taste like they are cooked in rancid grease.  The pizza was much better on our second trip.  Way too noisy inside to have a conversation with friends while eating.  Acoustics need to be fixed!  Staff was very attentive and continuously asked us if we needed more mixed drinks.  Eat here if you can find something you like, but I don't recommend it."
Tani B.,"Austin, TX",34,65,1,5.0,9/10/2010,"Back to BJ's last night before rehearsal.  The usually grumpy waitress was actually smiling and friendly, and obviously remembered us from previous visits - remembering that we both liked the Sweet Pig, for instance. We both tried a new pizza this time - he got a Bacon Cheeseburger (which the waitress said was ""surprisingly good"", and he agreed), and I tried the Spinach Artichoke.  Mine was acceptably tasty, but I think in the future I'll stick with my Pig or the Mediterranean.  What can I say?  Once I find what I like, I usually keep going back to it..."
Cheryl R.,"Sparks, NV",0,4,,1.0,11/7/2014,"Worst experience ever!!!  The hostess is gossiping with a male person when we walk in.  Acts like we are a bother.  Get seated and the waitress takes our drink order very promptly.  Get our drinks, and place our order - the food arrives, but my food is well done.  The waitress apologizes and takes my food back - the Manager, Brian, comes over and asks if everything is okay.  We tell him the problem and he just smiles and says ""how sad"" - hope they get it right the next time"" - REALLY???  And you are the MANAGER??? My food arrives and is right - the waitress apologizes again and is very sincere. Lucky us...Brian comes by again to see how my food is. We tell him it is fine, but my friend questions Brian's manager skills.  His answer, ""Just don't tip the waitress if you don't like the service"".  We will NEVER be back."
J M.,"Temple, TX",1,25,,4.0,5/5/2013,Jalapeño burger only had 3 pieces of jalapeños... not what I expected.  Other menu items are good and the handcrafted beers are alright.
Joyce J.,"Temple, TX",1,14,11,2.0,8/15/2010,"I've been to BJ's several times and most experiences have been enjoyable. Food: overpriced and mostly generic.  I've known several people who've gotten the roasted chicken on different occasions and had it come out undercooked (as in raw in the middle). The pizza is mostly just there but always loaded with toppings so it's flavorful.  The parmesan crusted chicken is very good and an entree I would highly recommend.  The pizookies are fabulous, and now they have mini ones! Drink: The mixed drinks are priced higher than I'd like, but the bartenders usually make a good drink.  The beer is more consistent though, and I like that they have flights.  Mostly I recommend their handcrafted root beer which is so, so, so very tasty.  Service: The hostesses and managers are always very nice and greet you as soon as you walk in.  Most of the time, I get a decent waiter.  The bar service is always nice.  Unfortunately, I've always had horrible service with groups larger than 8 people (automatic gratuity added to the bill).  In fact, one waiter even griped at us when 2 people didn't show up so we had 6 instead of 8.  With larger groups, I've found that we're lucky to get the waiter to return for drink refills more than once before the bill comes out.  On more than one occasion with larger groups, I've had to repeat my drink order to the waiter several times, and it would take him two trips to bring it to me. Overall, I'll still go to BJ's.  After all, there aren't too many places in Temple, but I recommend going with a smaller, more intimate group or sitting at the bar."
M N.,"Fairfax County, VA",3,230,23,3.0,4/7/2010,"Bier and food are both decent.  At every brewery, I always imbibe my favorite, Indian Pale Ale (IPA).  Unfortunately, BJ Restaurant and Brewery did not have any.  So, I had the pale ale - not too bad, a bit on the hoppy side, but not hoppy enough (at least for me).  I was not hungry, so had the Thai shrimp appetizer (4) - shrimps (3 per appetizer) with fresh veggies, wrapped in a lettuce leaf.  Tasty, a bit spicy, but relatively healthy and tasty.  I know, I know, why order a ""Thai inspired"" shrimp appetizer while in Texas and not some ""manly"" meat appetizer?  I was not really in the mood to order anything more substantial, thus ordered the Thai appetizer.  Late happy hour prices begin promptly at 2100 (9:00 pm), thus I was able to get a pretty good price break. BJ Restaurant and Brewery reminds me of Gordon Biersch - a corporate brewery.  The restaurant is chic, upscale - for me, personally, not really what I would look for in a brewery/pub.  Bier and food (at least the portions I tasted) were tasty and decent.  However, its still a ""corporate"" restaurant/brewery - I long for the brew pub with distinct taste and character.  Thus, three and not four stars."
Johnny H.,"Temple, TX",1,12,5,3.0,6/1/2010,"I was greeted by many of the employees in the waiting area which was nice.  Atmosphere was appealing to my eyes.  So far so good.  Then when I asked our server to change one of the channels to WSOP to the big screen I was declined?   The manager explained to me that BJ's policies wouldn't let them show any gambling or fighting. and he said those were BJ's policies.  No gambling or fighting? So now they turned off the WSOP that was on the small screen which was playing before I made a request for the big screen.   This was strange to me because I considered all those channels i wanted to watch to be a type of sport/competition  (UFC, Boxing, Poker).  So I ended up watching lots of unwanted commercials and baseball while enjoying an expensive beer on tap. Overall the food and drinks were good.  Atmosphere was nice.  But overall experience was just ok  *shrugs*"
Chris S.,"Round Rock, TX",87,264,,4.0,8/15/2009,"I like the beer at BJ's. The Hefeweizen went down very smoothly, and the porter finished off a nice lunch. The day looked a whole lot brighter and happier after those brews. They were not messing around. The food was pretty ok for a chain. It was overshadowed by the beer buzz, I reckon. The service was fantastic. Attentive and friendly, and the carefully engineered ambiance was quite nice...especially for a restaurant in this neck of the woods. When dining in Temple, you could do a whole lot worse than BJ's."
