Haley B.,"Austin, TX",90,138,24,3.0,3/25/2010,"Okay, here's the thing. Temple doesn't really have much of a night life to speak of. So, we came here after trying some local bars, in order to get a few drinks. Our waiter was nice enough, gave my friend some drink recommendations. However, as he came around for our 2nd round, my 2 friends both ordered waters and I got another beer. He brought me a water too, ""just in case"". I find this a little offensive. Makes me want to ask if he thinks I've acted inappropriately or something. Well 2 minutes after getting our 2nd round of drinks to us, we get a check. What the hell? We weren't ready to leave, but i guess we are being asked to? We definitely aren't the rowdy type, so i don't really understand...  Any-who, we came back the next day for lunch and our waitress was awesome. She made jokes and really ensured that we had a great time, so they earned back a few stars. Also, the avocado rolls are delish!"
Mitch W.,"Alvin, TX",0,11,,4.0,3/19/2012,"I'm in Temple a lot, and one of my wife and mine's favorite places is BJ's.  I'd say the only thing that keeps this from being 5-stars is the price.  They are expensive, but you have to know how to work it.  We have found that if you go during lunch, you get a much better value, and the portion sizes are still substantial.  We usually end up splitting the mini-pizza lunch which also includes a generous salad.  Since we both drink water, we get out of there for $10 including the tip.  I have never had a bad experience at BJ's, and it's always a place that we both look forward to."
Matthew S.,"Louisville, CO",7,5,2,4.0,8/22/2010,"As far as franchises go this one is actually quite good. I can't say enough about the beer. It's not your traditional American mass produced beer. The different types all have a lot of flavor and all have something to offer. And if beer isn't your thing the ciders or mixes of beer and ciders are worth a taste. Which is happily given by the staff for free prior to ordering.      But to make things even better, BJ's has rather good food. I'd try the avocado rolls...... Amazing. Can get crowded on the big nights like Friday and Saturday though so show up early or hit the bar for a minute or two."
Tracey W.,"Richardson, TX",115,131,,3.0,6/19/2011,"This was my first time here.  I have to admit that it took us awhile to get seated, but I think it was because we had a bigger group.  Once we did, the service was lacking.  I ordered a salad with my personal pizza...I finally got the salad when I was halfway done with my pizza.  I'd have much rather had it prior to the pizza.  So that was a definite downside for me.  Then for dessert, they decided we have to have a Pizookie.  They get it ordered...when it's ready, they bring out our 2 and they are the small ones.  We were a group of 8 and they brought us out a smaller Pizookie.  So we had to sit there for another 20-30 minutes while they re-did the entire thing to make it right.  It was very tasty...and one might even say addictive...I might go back, but the bar has been set low for service so I won't expect much and hope they can improve from there."
Ba L.,"Austin, TX",265,233,243,4.0,3/2/2009,"Party of 39?  We'll take you.  Decent selection of beer?  Got it.   Big variety of food to please a crowd?  Yep.  I came here with a party of 39 after a competition, and it was a decent experience.  The fact that they could seat all 39 of us was pretty nice.  The wait staff didn't managed to keep the orders together though the wait for anything was long.   My dining companion and I ordered 3 beers, 1 pale ale & 2 porters  (4.75 each), along with the large Mediterranean deep dish pizza ($24).  The pale ale was alright.  I'd drink it, but I didn't have any strong feelings about it.  The porter on the other hand, was excellent.  Dark, rich, and chocolaty.  Carbonated with nitrogen, it was smooth and delicious.  This is one of my favorite beers.    The pizza was a pizza.  And it wasn't like a deep dish Chicago pizza; it was just a pizza with really thick crust.  Looking at everyone else's food at the table, it was just typical chain restaurant food.  It's like a Chili's, Applebee's, or Bennigan's (RIP) within a brewery.  Food was satisfying, but not great by any means.  It was also severely overpriced.  $24 for a pizza was a little ridiculous.   In spite of the food and price of food, BJ's gets 4 stars.  They were able to accommodate a large party, though the club meeting was a little difficult due to the noise.  And the Porter was just awesome."
Ceze V.,"Temple, TX",15,178,45,5.0,9/30/2013,"when in temple and want a great dinner with a great experience i come to bj's. i am a card holder now. it can be on the pricy side at times but you get your monies worth. i love their beer selections and their food is amazing. i have had the mahi mahi tacos, the salmon teriyaki, the veggie burgers, the fish n chips, and the pizza so far. i try to mix it up time to time and the staff is always great about pairing beverages with your meal. the pazookie dessert is always phenomenal. i will continue to revisit this location based on my experience. i highly recommend a visit."
Missus M.,"Round Rock, TX",5,130,24,3.0,7/20/2009,"A-OK just about describes it. Their food is a bit overpriced, but if you go in there knowing that, you will enjoy whatever you get. I get the market salad, and their pizza is good as well as the shrimp tacos."
Heather B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",124,200,33,5.0,6/29/2011,"Superb Parmesan crusted chicken, clam chowder, and grilled pork chops. Our son loved his pizza. The in house made sodas were excellent too! A ""must try""! Garrett our waiter was great too."
Jim B.,"Belton, TX",1,26,,2.0,11/2/2012,As a frequent traveler  my expectations are typically set at a very reasonable level.  Having eaten at several other BJ's I was expecting above average service and food quality.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed by both at the Temple store.  I witnessed lackadaisical management and mediocre service and food.  I won't be heading back to this BJ's anytime soon.  The owners should take a hard look at their management.
Sabrina O.,"Belton, TX",41,34,1,4.0,7/8/2013,"I'm new to the area and BJ's has been my go to restaurant. The first time I went there I got to shrimp scampi. It was delicious, but I added some marinara sauce to it and it tasted even better (I just like to add marinara to everything). We also got the avocado rolls, but I didn't like them. It came with some oily sauce (soy maybe?) and the rolls were greasy. My fiance loved them though. The next time we got spinach and artichoke dip. It was great and it came with a lot of chips which is something many chains don't understand you need to eat dip with. That time we had the bbq chicken pizza. It was awesome, however the deep dish pizza isn't Chicago deep dish. I was kind of thrown off, but it's similar to pizza hut's pan pizza if that helps you understand. Their cookie desserts are AMAZING. And their cocktails are even better. Try the pomegranate sunset (or sunrise whatever its called) and the ""a drink like that."" I like the former better, but both were great fruity drinks."
Jay E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,549,6,4.0,6/19/2011,"A solid chain restaurant without the chain restaurant feel.  It's always busy so not the quickest service but the servers are friendly.  The food is what you'd expect from brewery/pub - great appetizers, a wide variety of entrees, and a plethora of desserts.  We'll be back."
Deborah M.,"Austin, TX",66,10,,4.0,9/29/2011,"I like the beer, and the sampler is a pretty good deal.  The food is good, and the waitress I had was awesome.  I would go there more often, but as a student, it's a little beyond my price range to go there regularly.  Overall a good experience though."
Ray K.,"Williamson, TX",0,11,,1.0,11/18/2012,"Ate here for a second time (and last) tonight.  The first time I ate here did not leave much of an impression on me.  It felt like a watering hole and appetizer type place.  My wife and I returned tonight and I left resigned never to return.  We arrived at 5:50 pm.  No wait.  The place was crowded but not full.  At 6:45 I spoke with a manager because we had not seen our food yet.  He came back 10 minutes later with our cold food and explained that the food had been delayed because ""we are very busy"".  I told him that there was not a good excuse to keep us waiting that long.  His response to me was ""OK"", then he promptly left and hid the rest of the time we were there.  I had a pot roast sandwich that was cold and tasteless.  My wife had pork chops that were cold and hard.  All in all, a horrible experience that I will never repeat."
Lindsay N.,"Colorado Springs, CO",29,64,6,4.0,10/25/2010,"This seems to be the only ""city like"" restaurant anywhere near Killeen.  My husband and I found it shortly after moving here and we really liked it each time we went.  Their Avocado rolls are really yummy but you have to really like avocados!  Their martinis are expensive but very good.  Its good to call ahead and get your name on the list, especially on weekends.  The only think I dont really enjoy there is the pizza."
Jessi H.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",85,181,73,3.0,7/16/2010,Gave BJ's another try and I am positive that this place is just A-OK. I can't say anything bad but in the same breath I really can't say anything great. For a chain it's good and for Temple it's much better but in the big picture this place does not knock my socks off.
Megan R.,"Georgetown, TX",1,6,,5.0,1/19/2012,"I went here on my lunch break today.  Usually I don't venture into actual restaurants for lunch but it was payday, and hey, I wanted to treat myself.  And I was treated well.  Let's get down to business: Atmosphere: Very busy, very spacious restaurant.  That said, the only time I had to wait for anything was when I was being sat, which wasn't long.  I like the bar atmosphere quite a bit.  They have tons of tvs and an extensive beer list along with cocktails.  I sat in the dining room this time though. Service: Excellent! My server, Megan, was far and away the best I've had in some time, she sold me on a bunch of great items and knew the menu well.  She was prompt, polite, and courteous.  Very good.  I had a couple managers stop by briefly to ask how I liked everything as well. Food:  The lunch specials are fantastic! I walked in looking to get a sandwich and walked out having had an essentially 4 course meal for under 20 dollars.  They have new items that are ""snacks and bites"" which are pretty much mini appetizers.  I was eating alone, so these were perfect to start off.  I chose the ahi tuna, and it wasn't the paltry serving I was expecting.  It had a good 5-6 pieces of tuna and was accompanied by an asian slaw.  Usually slaws aren't my thing but I liked this one.  For my entree I went for the lunch special half sandwich and salad, specifically the Ty Cobb sandwich.  The salad was out first, and again a nice generous portion.  The sandwich also came with fries (you can choose wedges or thin and crispy. Me=wedges) which was also a nice surprise.  All of it was fresh and delectable.  The best part for me though is always the pizookie, and now they have mini personal ones!  The red velvet is to die for. Definitely check this place out!"
Alexis P.,"Hewitt, TX",4,12,5,5.0,4/23/2010,"If I feel like just going out and getting something to eat, I go to BJ's.  I usually eat at the bar and both Ira and Ricky are awesome bartenders and very friendly."
Jessica P.,"Menlo Park, CA",94,39,30,3.0,2/28/2010,"BJ's is now the place to meet the pals in Temple as there is not much to choose from otherwise.  They have a good selection of their own brewery beer.  The food on the otherhand is just okay.  The have a rather large menu of burgers, pizzas, pastas, etc that is on par with your typical franchise fare.  The dessert called the pie-zookie is a must try in any of the varieties they offer - chocolate chip, white choco macadamia, double choco or Oreo!"
Edwin H.,"Austin, TX",4,66,,3.0,2/27/2011,"Cut the menu in half, learn to execute it with consistent recipes served  hot and timely, and your stock will go up.  Keep doing what you're doing and even opening new stores won't save you.  Micro-beer drinkers won't save you when you start moving into urban areas. You're gonna have to get the food right.   Way to many menu items for the kitchen to manage efficiently.  Flying high right now. My prediction is take a look at the stock in two years, if that long.  Also, more comphehensive wait staff training. Obviously, these comments come from our experience of eating there on a number of occasions.  Personally, I love the meatloaf, my wife hates it. More people will hate it than not, it has no ""middle of the road"" appeal. You either love it or hate it, no in-between.  Chains MUST learn to please the moderate ""taste buds"" in both directions!"
A E.,"Overland Park, KS",0,96,,3.0,1/15/2013,"Worth a try. I would stop again. The menu has too many items to select from. The service was on par for a brew pup. Obviously not at the top of my list, but a good choice if you have not been here yet, and a locally owned restaurant doesn't grab you first. Maybe after a few more attempts at the food selection I could find moving this to a 4 star."
