Amanda R.,"Killeen, TX",4,1,,5.0,8/25/2010,"As soon as I walked in the door, I knew I would like this place. We were seated right away, our waitress was awesome! Very attentive. I had the California sandwich...yummy!!! I wasn't in the mood or beer, so I tried the pomegranate margarita, a little strong, but really good. You have to like sweets. I would definately recommend this place!"
Tracy B.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",3,26,,3.0,8/19/2010,"BJ's is a pretty decent restaurant. I love their root beer and HIGHLY recommend it. I have only gone here for lunch. The staff are friendly and attentive. The food was so-so. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. I think the atmosphere is nice and te service prompt. I would go back."
Glynna T.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,7,,5.0,4/5/2010,Great place for soup and sandwiches.  Bakery items are yummy.  Close to Scott and White so good place to go for a break between appt.  Highly recommend
Ellie G.,"Temple, TX",0,2,,3.0,4/22/2010,"My family enjoys going here due to the large menu selection. My husband and I enjoy the many beer choices. While it tends to be quite loud and the last few times I went there the service time was very long, I still like to go when in the mood for a very casual, leisurely dinner."

Liesse B.,"Temple, TX",68,15,,3.0,5/2/2011,"My husband and I have been to BJ's a handful of times (since it's one of the only restaurants in Temple slightly better than Applebee's/Chilis).  The ONLY reason we come back is because the food is good and the beer is better. We have never had any issues with the food here.  We have enjoyed everything we've ordered.  I love the beers and the root beer isn't the best I've ever had but it's darn close.  Seriously, we only come back to this place for the food... Every time I've been in BJ's in Temple the service has been less than desirable.  Seeing as my husband and I waited tables through college, we're pretty understanding of the biz.  The first time we visited, our waitress was in a bad mood and it was very obvious.  The second time our waitress was nice, but a complete ditz.  I think the worst experience we had was when we took my  parents and children to BJ's for Sunday late lunch (around 1:30 p.m.).  The restaurant was less than half-full, and it took us an hour to get our food.  The kids were cranky and restless, and there were no apologies or much of an effort to keep us slightly happy, and we could barely catch our waiter to get our drinks refilled once we received them a half hour after ordering them.  The table next to us (with 6 adults) managed to get their drinks and food in under a half hour and when we questioned about it, the waiter just said, ""That's how it goes sometimes.""   I'm happy to see they've got a gluten-free menu, and the only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 2 is because I find myself constantly daydreaming about Pizookies and beers."
