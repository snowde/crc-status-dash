Robert M.,"Dallas, TX",0,9,,1.0,4/24/2017,We came in on a Monday evening and I ordered Chicken Parmesan. After 35 years in the corrugated box industry. I know cardboard when I see it. Broccoli was so cold and firm that I could have buffed the car.
Rawan D.,"South Side, Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,5/17/2017,"Went there last night for dinner. Food was cold, meat was unseasoned. Service was just horrible. Took the waiter 30 minutes to bring us our drinks. Got upset when we returned 2 of the 3 dishes we had. Absolutely awful experience."
Bill K.,"Belton, TX",12,293,14,4.0,3/5/2016,The food is good.  We got the new vege penne. Tasty. Their root beer is excellent and a must try if you like root beer.  It is a bottomless glass.  Our waiter had several issues but they made it right.   The new monkey bread with ice cream desert is quite nice.   Recommended.
Brian B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",373,1302,44,4.0,12/2/2015,"A fine BJ's restaurant.  Standard menu, food, etc.  The bartender (Ira Y) who served me at ~ 12:30AM after a flight from California and drive from Austin was super awesome and friendly.  Thanks for being open late, making good food, and having a friendly and efficient staff, BJ's Temple."
Tami P.,"Temple, TX",0,3,,4.0,11/1/2016,Wonderful wait staff. Professional yet fun. Food is good too. Save room for a Pazooki!
Karen C.,"Kapolei, HI",33,76,60,2.0,8/13/2016,"Almost gave one star, but the service was honestly great, however the food and my drink, not so much. Ordered an Absolute pepper Vodka Bloody Mary and it was very watered down tasting and I couldn't taste any spice or vodka at all in it. I also ordered the ahi tuna salad and the tiny 1/4 maybe of a tuna steak (the tuna was good, but for that price def not worth it). My daughters grilled chicken was extremely dry, and my sons frenchfries came out 10 minutes after we got our meal. Husband had a flatbread and the edges were burnt and had a terribly bitter taste to them. Sad because we normally like BJs. Hoping the location closer to us is better food quality. Again, service was great."
Texas B.,"Midlothian, TX",1,21,,3.0,9/5/2016,"Overall an odd visit compared to most, at this BJ's.  Came with the family for an 11:00 lunch break. No one in the restaurant ... Hmmm. Hostess broke free from gabfest in back to pretend to care about seating us.  Service started off OK but the food was not made correctly. Hey, it happens. But the dramatic eye rolls were off putting, by other servers not ours. Disagreement among servers over how the sandwich should be prepared, looked like they were covering for each other.  Sandwich gets remade with new hot fries, sandwich dry this time as requested.  So, good marks for the food and flavor. Manager came by and check on meal, actually listened and checked on the remake. Good marks for this manager.  Score knocked down for the hostess and drama while on the restaurant floor, instead of in back. OK to grouse about patrons just not within earshot of us. ** Long time BJ's member, eat here occasionally as I head back home from road trips."
Kevin H.,"Hutto, TX",71,2,2,1.0,10/17/2016,"Good food, pricey, service was horrible. Place needs new management. 1430 almost no one in the place. Got our drinks fairly quickly but then waitress didn't come back for almost 20 minutes."
Mike L.,"HANSCOM AFB, MA",2,10,13,5.0,1/7/2016,"Giving the cheesecake factory a run for their money, this place has an extensive menu with healthy and sinful options. The lunch portions are so great for those trying to keep the portions to a minimum... but u can still go big or go home if you want to. I had a beer that was paired with my food from the menu recommendations. Wait staff was on point. Plenty of ambiance from easy music to flat screen TVs scattered around. Great seating choices as well. I will definitely be back for more soon!"
Tammy G.,"Martinez, CA",26,14,,5.0,7/8/2016,Loved this place! Been to this chain when I was in California and I was beyond excited when I moved to temple to find BJ's. Great variety of food very unique and any brew you could think up!
JL A.,"Salado, TX",26,4,7,4.0,6/23/2016,"Sat at table 509 (which was the first table we sat at on our first visit). The waitress (Jenifer) was absolutely the best, happy, joyful, uplifting, wanted to serve us and make our visit the best it could. She went way over her expected duties to make us feel at home and family."
Greta P.,"Liberty, MO",47,10,2,5.0,10/18/2015,"Delish! Unique options and amazingly expansive drink menu. This may bey new favorite hand out. I sampled a little of everything here. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding. The avocado egg rolls were my favorite. The artichokes were really good too!! I also try the broccoli cheddar soup in the breadbowl.. Yummy! Lots of tvs to watch football and amazing pumpkin ale. Plus, free wifi! I'll be back for sure:)"
John B.,"Temple, TX",0,18,,5.0,4/1/2016,"Good to have a place to get a decent meal and tasty craft beer right here in Temple. Very ambitious menu, lots of selections that are well executed. Good beer variety, should keep any beer nerd happy. Wait staff is always very friendly and helpful. Even during peak hours, never have had to wait more than 15-20 minutes to be seated. Very kid friendly, always lots of folks with little ones in here. Recommended."
Ernest P.,"Temple, TX",0,3,,2.0,3/16/2016,"Although this has was not my first time to BJ'S it is by far my worst experience.  My first drink I received they made it a virgin because it taste like there was no alcohol in it.  Then I ordered the brisket bacon burger which not only smashed but also completely over cooked, I ordered med but received well done, this was the first time.  The second time it was still over cooked but hey it was at least MID WELL...LMAO. I think next time I would just ask to cook it myself. The service was what I would expect from most chain restaurants but BJ'S always seemed to stand out, guess they gave up or maybe they didn't expect a tip since I was with my family.  I am complete disappointed in them. Don't know if I will ever be back...well at least not to the one in Temple,TX."
Adam A.,"Temple, TX",38,14,,4.0,9/14/2016,Food is pretty good service is very good my one complaint is it takes forever for the food to get delivered to your team know to wait more than 30 minutes for your plate but the beer is as good as it comes recommend their berry burst if you like something sweet The ambience is nice and it has to be the best tomato bisque soup
Cathy L.,"Harker Heights, TX",45,8,7,1.0,7/29/2016,Very rude waiter. Did not let me finish my order and did not want any questions. Hot tea came with dirty cup and no apology or cup replacement. no non alcoholic beer choices like other bjs in the state.
Mandy L.,"Lakewood, Dallas, TX",210,203,143,4.0,5/18/2015,"Came here quite late on a Saturday night with a large party. Food and drinks were a bit slow, but I suppose that's to be expected when you only have 1 waitress for a table of 15+.  Drink choices were great and the margaritas were tart, but good. As for food, I love all the selection. We got the appetizer sampler and the avocado egg rolls were amazing!! I don't normally enjoy the pizza or flatbreads here as they taste pretty plain, so I suggest trying something different."
Meghan A.,"Temple, TX",59,4,,5.0,7/5/2016,Fantastic Food and Outstanding Service! I love how our server answered questions with enthusiasm & made great suggestions! That shows me this restaurant has outstanding management!
Shelley C.,"Arlington, TX",24,2,,5.0,7/3/2016,I really like BJs. Everything I've ordered has had a lovely flavor. Have had only one bad meal there when they forgot the Brussels sprouts in the Brussels Sprouts and Kale Salad...they eventually brought them on the   we had the jambalaya (delicious even though Mom ordered it with no spice :-) ) and the Asian Chopped Salad (delicious). Can't wait to come back.
Allen C.,"Miramar, FL",381,145,271,5.0,3/13/2014,"This is an excellent place for good food and drinks. They're constantly updating the menus and always try to keep them with the seasons. I usually sit at the bar, so service is fairly quick and the bartenders make it a point to get to know you. In my case, they know me by name and automatically set me up with the drinks I want as soon as I sit. Anyway, it's a good place for a date or a night out with friends."
