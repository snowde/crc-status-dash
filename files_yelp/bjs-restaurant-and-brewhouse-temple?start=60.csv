Naomi F.,"Channelview, TX",68,1,,4.0,7/1/2016,"Went in on a Friday night with a friend, and we were immediately seated. The waitress was super nice and attentive but not over bearing. Avocado rolls were so good, and the sauce that came with it was pleasantly sweet and complimented the bit of spice in the rolls.  I had their beer battered fish and chips, which was beyond good. I usually don't like fish, but it was perfectly cooked and the batter was absolutely delicious. I got 4 large cod fillets and wedges fries which are seasoned similarly to curly fries.  We sat and talked for a bit after our meal and weren't rushed. This was one my better dining experiences at this B.J.'s and the food was superb.  I've had their pot stickers, mozzarella sticks, pizza, chicken Alfredo and pazookie's in the past. All of it is delicious. What I love about this place, is that you can go on a casual day out or dress up after a more formal event. Their drinks are good, and they often have great specials. They even have an so where you can reserve a table or order ahead. Overall it's a pretty good restaurant, although it can be a bit pricey."
Scott C.,"Killeen, TX",0,7,3,4.0,3/7/2015,"Go for the craft beer. It is a good bet whatever you choose it will be good. Don't get the Santa Fe Chicken Salad ... the chicken is not grilled breast, nor does it have any taste whatsoever! The new thin crust pizzas are terrific."
Aron Y.,"Austin, TX",236,304,624,4.0,11/17/2011,"Nice setting, nice atmosphere. You get to try different samples of their ale before purchasing (and I think you don't even have to purchase if you didn't want to). I tried a few and I actually liked them more than I thought I would. I got their Deluxe Bacon Burger and it was amazing! It was really big and I wasn't able to quite fit it in one big bite without stressing my jaws. It had 2 big patties, all your common veggies, onion rings, and the taste was great! It was kind of greasy but when you get a burger with so much stuff on it, you can't expect not to get messy =] It also came with potato wedges. I even got people around me coming to ask me what I ordered b/c it looked so good! Totally worth the price and would definitely come again."
Jennifer C.,"Denton, TX",27,55,9,3.0,4/15/2015,"BJs is deserving of an update after 4 years. We've had some servers that have been really good and attentive and the menu has changed enough that there is something for everyone's taste.  Although I tend to make a chain such as BJs a last choice on a normal basis, it's a good choice in Temple when going with a group of friends or family!"
Alyssa D.,"Belton, TX",71,10,1,2.0,3/16/2016,Usually we receive decent service. I suppose they are under staffed today seeing as our waiter is more interested in the group table(more of a tip). He is treating us as a burden.
Travis M.,"Sterling Heights, MI",0,31,4,5.0,3/18/2016,"I have tried 2 burgers, both awesome. Bacon, avocado is amazing and brisket burger will know your socks off. Did I mention they have craft beer. IPA'S have all been great and red is really good. Highly recommend stopping in. Huge menu!"
Jess F.,"Belton, TX",0,10,1,4.0,4/4/2016,"Great house brew selection, decent pizza, appetizers-a step up from say, a chilis.  The salmon seems to be of a better quality than a typical chain restaurant.  Service can be hit or miss, but one of the main bartenders, Ira, is quite possibly the best bartender ever in the history of bar tending. Great place to come with the family, or watch the game with the boys."
Lola P.,"Temple, TX",0,19,10,3.0,2/7/2016,I have mixed feelings about this place. The first time we went the food was okay and our server was okay. A year later we went back and the food was delicious! Our server Tim was great. We went back once a week after that and the quality  of the food decreased. Jennifer was our server a few times after that. She was loud and annoying. She always seemed like she was rushing us out. One time she brought out the wrong  food for us and I had to flag another server down and have her fix it. Needless to say her tips from us suffered because of her attitude. The last time we went back the food quality was still poor but our server Chris was great! We will be back only if Tim and Chris are there.
Gabriel S.,"Temple, TX",0,19,,4.0,8/28/2016,"Great burgers and pizza. Some entrees are on the salty side, but great overall. The healthier options are also good."
Chris M.,"Austin, TX",4976,535,2556,2.0,1/17/2011,"BJ's is a nice place to go, always a crowd, plenty of TVs, good HH specials.  The food is good - nothing spectacular, but pretty good, and the beer selection is great.  The service is what typically drags this place down - - it's inconsistent and can be spotty at best.   We've been here several times recently, and I'd have to say we have some issues w/ quality of service nearly everytime.  The various issues include:  waiting too long to get your food, waitstaff disappears longer than expected, drinks are not filled, service is reactive instead of proactive , or we're usually waiting for something and then have to put in a request when the waitstaff shows up.   The Managers are usually very nice and professional, they'll walk around and will at times check in with you.  If you escalate to them they are usually very accomodating and eager to please.  That's a great thing, but after the same mistakes happen over and over you just get tired about complaining about the same thing.     A couple of us had the unlimited soup and salad lunch combo.  The 1st round of salads came out in a jiffy, the soup took longer than expected.  They finished the salads, which was then replaced w/ soup, but the waiter never asked if anyone wanted more salad....and he never came back for a while.  After finishing their soups they sat idle for a while - - no one came back to check up.  It wasn't too busy at all, not to mention we had to ask for sugar and silverware initially and never got the sugar, had to take if off another table.  Don't deny us any sugar, pretty please (with sugar on top).  My fish and shrimp tacos were - - okay - - nothing great or exceptional.  The tomato bisque was very good, and my friends loved their caesar salads - - they just wished they could have more of it.  So if BJ's could be more consistent w/ their quality of service - - well - - I'd put them back up at 4 stars easily.   We did, however, enjoy Vanessa's service during one lunch - - she's pretty darn good.  I think next time we'll request her."
Kimmie P.,"Harker Heights, TX",149,13,,5.0,4/7/2016,My mom and I went here one day for lunch after going to another restaurant and not getting any service. The food and the service were awesome. Mom and I both got salads and they make great salads.
Scott K.,"Temple, TX",487,238,745,4.0,8/5/2014,"You get way you pay for, and BJs always delivers. Yes, it is a chain, but it's always good no matter what you order. The service is attentive, but it does get crowded so expect a wait on the normal busy nights. One down side, when it's busy it is also loud, so don't expect to be able to carry on a casual conversation with anyone further than two seats away."
Andrew M.,"Belton, TX",0,51,9,4.0,2/10/2016,"This place is a little BOOGY and the food ain't all that good, but of course they have a GREAT SELECTION of House BREWS/taps and well that makes up for it... I give yall 4 ""WHOLE"" stars.!!"
RayRay S.,"Cedar Park, TX",53,47,432,5.0,1/4/2015,"I've never had bad service at BJ's. I love, love, love the New York strip.  The mexican martini rocks it hard. My husbands fish and chips were exactly what he wanted. He loves their craft beers. In fact sometimes I catch him cheating on me with our craft beer loving friends. I'm personally not a fan but all the guys seem to think their beers are amazing."
Karin P.,"San Antonio, TX",89,164,86,4.0,10/31/2014,"Always a fan of BJ's, not matter which one I go to. Food is always good and the staff is always nice. Got to have lunch with a dear friend I hadn't seen in months so it was an awesome lunch."
Arlicia A.,"Beaumont, TX",380,16,14,5.0,2/25/2016,"Awesome atmosphere and OMG the food! Ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and was nearly blown off my feet! The presentation was superb and the taste even better! Note to the Chef: If you ever decide to add oysters added to the recipe, I will be your first Guinea Pig! Lol! Peach tea was an excellent add to my order! Great service! AND they honored a military discount! Thx you for acknowledging our families sacrifice & commitment to serve! Will definitely return!!"
Gary H.,"Hobbs, NM",25,118,90,3.0,7/30/2015,"Fiery pork thin crust pizza. While the flavor wasn't bad, the crust was not crispy.  When I order a than crust, I want every bit to crunch.  Service was ok and the atmosphere was typical BJ's."
Ann M.,"Evergreen, CO",27,245,114,5.0,6/15/2014,"After trying a few terrible places to eat at while staying in the area, we went here.  Yes, they are a chain, but you know what I'm giving them 5 stars because the entire week I stayed in this area this was the best food I ate.    I always ordered the Cherry Chiptole Salmon and it was delicious.   People I was with ordered the BBQ plate for lunch and said that was good, as was the Parmesan Encrusted Chicken dinner. The pizookie was good was well.  I got a flight and I was very happily surprised by the size of the samples in the flight.   The beers I chose were the,  Harvest Hefeweizen,  Jeremiah Red, Oasis Amber, and Abbey Normal.   The Red and the Hef were amazing. I also had a mixed drink one night, that was like some sort of Sour Lemonade Jack Daniels drink, I don't remember the name of, but that was also very good. We ended up eating here multiple times this past week, because of all the dismal options in the area."
Kirk J.,"Belton, TX",0,4,,1.0,8/12/2016,Made a reservation and arrived 3 minutes prior to the scheduled time.  Told it would be 30 minutes for table.  Party included 2 over 70 not in great health.  Ridiculous.
Michelle V.,"Temple, TX",15,46,39,4.0,5/20/2015,"The selection of food is overwhelming and it seems as though you could frequent and never try all that is on the menu. With that being said the quality service and the food we have tried has been pretty good. Their avocado egg rolls are top of the line  paired with their dipping sauce, makes for a must have appetizer. The pizzas are all delicious and their deep dish lasagna is wonderful. They also have a parmesean crusted chicken that has great flavor. I'm not much of a beer drinker but their selection is also expansive and they have events that make for great outings in town."
