Mark A.,"Belton, TX",0,11,,1.0,10/11/2016,"Cody, our waiter gets the star. My wife and I had not been to BJ's for a few months due to the fact they would get something wrong with our order or not have something we ordered, so we thought we'd try again.  We were seated promptly and water on the way. We ordered roasted Brussels sprouts which were great. When we ordered our beer I wanted a porter, wife got the Newcastle on tap. She got her beer but I was told the dark beers are too foamy so they aren't selling it. So I have to try again. Got the beer and we ordered. Wife got fish tacos I wanted a ""new "" item, spicy chicken with ""soba"" noodles. The waiter comes back, no spicy chicken cause no noodles. I try again, this time manager comes to apologize for the ""inconveniences"". I order burger with wedge fries, mayo on the side. We also order another round of beers. We finally get the order, they have to go back to get the mayo. My wife was to have chips on her fish tacos per the menu, but when she asked the server argued with her that it didn't. We asked for the menu. When I spread the mayo out of the little cup, there's a worm or something like that in the mayo! NOT good. They go to make another but my wife now wonders what her sauce has in it. Manager reappears. I want my check and out. He wants to make new food. I say no, check and out . He charges for 4 beers. We never got the second round. He leaves and comes back with another tab, I give him $15 and we leave.  No communication with staff as to what they can sell and can't, no ""here let us make it better with whatever"", no apology for arguing about the menu items. WE won't be back."
Roxy W.,"Ewa Beach, HI",155,442,1390,4.0,6/24/2012,"My husband and I came here for the first time today for lunch. It was a little busy around 1pm but I wasn't surprised since it's a Sunday. We ordered the root beer, sampler platter,  Thai chicken mango salad and the ahi poke. We enjoyed eating the ahi poke. The fish was fresh tasting and it is so far the only place so far I know in the area besides C & H that has ahi poke on their menu.  (The ahi poke is better here than at C & H). The price for the ahi poke appetizer is $9.95. The Thai mango chicken salad was priced at $10.95. It was  delicious and fresh tasting as well. They advertise this salad as being less than 575 calories. The ahi poke and the salad is definitely worth coming back for but not the sampler appetizer. The sampler appetizer is priced at $16.95 and it came with avocado egg roll, southwestern spring roll, mozzarella sticks and spinach and artichoke dip. You could find these items at most American restaurants. I was disappointed with the avocado roll. Yelpers recommended this and I am not impressed at all. It is definitely not worth the price so I recommend NOT to get the sampler. The root beer was another recommendation by Yelpers and AGAIN I am not impressed. It was ok but it tasted like any ol' root beer.  My husband and I will definitely be back again for the ahi poke!"
James L.,"Hamilton, TX",2,9,,4.0,12/20/2015,It's a chain but I think their food great ... I like the fish tacos and the jambalaya! The PM Porter is awesome!
Ron B.,"Moosic, PA",13,39,2,4.0,9/4/2014,I visited BJ's perhaps 10 times in the month I was in Temple.  I sat at the bar each time. The atmosphere is casual and there were several TVs behind the bar to keep my attention. The bartenders were attentive and did a great job of taking care of patrons.  There were usually 2-3 working the bar and it was normally pretty full plus all the dining room tables to poor drinks.  They made an effort to learn my name on the first couple visits and started greeting me by name on future visits. The food was consistently good.  I ordered a variety of dishes and my favorite app was the corn bread fritters. I won't hesitate to return whenever I'm in town again.
Lynn B.,"Belton, TX",0,32,2,5.0,6/22/2016,"I love the atmosphere, waitstaff, bartenders (Ira remembers your name and what you like to eat and drink), Caesar salad, chicken wings, flat bread pizza, beers.   Seldom waiting for a spot in the bar area.  Better wings than a wing place."
Erik M.,"Kempner, TX",4,26,1,5.0,6/8/2014,"Again, GREAT service from the Hostess to the server and the cook in between.  Seating was instant, server Kathan was fast to the table, quick to bring our drinks, kept the water topped off, and took our dinner requests with perfection.. Dinner was served exactly as requested (Ribeye Med Rare), and Kathan checked in once a few bites had been made to make sure it was prepared as requested.  Another GREAT experience at our local BJ's"
G.A. W.,"Temple, TX",0,16,,4.0,7/6/2016,"I like BJ's. Nice up beat atmosphere. They have a very good staff, and I love the Pizza. I have eaten a few entrees and they are good, but a little pricey for what get, but over all it's a nice to place to eat dinner with a friend or your girl.  I give the Pizza 5 stars and their entrees 3 stars. I wish the beer cost a little less."
Chris J.,"Belton, TX",55,30,2,4.0,9/6/2015,"If you've never done BJs, well...need to change that.  Great menu.  Sandwiches, burgers, lunch specials...my favorites are half sandwich with chicken tortilla soup or mozzarella and tomato salad (or both!).  Gotta try the pizza too-big fan of the Buffalo chicken.  But honestly, I have to sit in the bar-will not find a better draft beer selection anywhere and if you like sports, they've got the mother of all entertainment walls.  Add great service, cant't go wrong here."
Vicki B.,"Temple, TX",40,2,,5.0,6/9/2016,My husband and I are loyal return guests to BJ's.  We go there at least once a week and we also participate in the BJ's Premier Rewards.  We build points rather quickly and the perks are great!  The staff there are always professional and friendly!
Gina C.,"Temple, TX",0,4,,5.0,11/4/2015,Love their food. Great menu a but pricey but worth it. Staff is very friendly. Clean environment
Tonya M.,"Little River-Academy, TX",65,9,,5.0,9/5/2015,"My husband and I had dinner here last night. We come here quite often. The food is great, I love their draft beer, and staff is usually great. Last night we had a couple problems with our food (first time we have ever had a problem) we didn't ask for a refund or replacement just wanted to let them know maybe their cook needed more training. Minutes later the manager came to our table, listened to our concerns, and offered to replace our food. He was VERY nice as was our waiter. Another one of the reasons we will continue to eat at BJ's....plus you have the best pizza in Temple!  Thank you for great food and great service!"
Zach S.,"Cypress, TX",76,1,,5.0,6/4/2016,"Great service, management spent about 15 minutes looking for a specific baseball game I wanted to watch and Tashina was an awesome waitress."
Joshua G.,"Belton, TX",287,113,41,4.0,4/14/2015,I really enjoy this location when it comes to getting a nice drink in a high end bar. The atmosphere is great and during football season it's a nice stop to see the game and meet up with friends. The only down side is the place is packed all the time and it's very over crowded. The food is also axing and te pizza appetizer is amazing. If you drop by try and catch it during off peak time and you will have an amazing meal. Also try there home made root beer.
Heather B.,"East Bernstadt, KY",3,128,27,5.0,4/20/2015,This place is always amazing. The waitors are so nice and lively. There's one waitor (I'm upset that I forgot his name) that always jokes around with us. Food is amazing. Alot of vegan options.
Arie M.,"Houston, TX",175,502,444,4.0,9/25/2011,"I don't always drive out to Temple, TX for the first time on a whim , but when I do, I go to BJ's.   Seriously, I was in Temple for about 3 hours and most of that time was at  this place.   Getting there was a bit tricky.  I completely passed it  by while I was looking for it and ended up on a loop of some sort, but rather than blaming my bad sense of direction, I blame it on the weird on and off ramps Temple has that are much different than the ones in Houston... At any rate, I enjoyed this establishment (aside from the purpose of my visit) because the service was great (The to-go ice tea cup was a life saver on the late night drive back to H-town cool waitress) and the broiled salmon I had was delicious.   The side salad was not that great but I'll let that one slip.  I also got a bite out of a flat bread pizza they had and that was good too.  Sharing is caring. Pro tip: the hard wood floors are a little slipper so be careful."
Russ A.,"Fort Worth, TX",12,39,62,1.0,5/12/2015,"Ordered the Kale and Brussels Sprout salad at BJ's Webster, TX. Guess what? No Brussels Sprouts. They seemed surprised when I pointed out ""no Brussels Sprouts"". You'd think the main ingredient  would be present. Manager seemed smug. He did comp the salad I didn't eat and the beer I drank. Im done with this place. Check your salads folks. One star because either they are running a ""they wont notice scam"" or even worse...kitchen incompetence"
Martha N.,"Hewitt, TX",111,44,321,4.0,9/4/2013,"I was meeting up an old friend for lunch and  when I asked my friend what's good, he said everything, but the burgers are really good. Well, because I was starving, I wanted an appetizers and got the spinach artichoke dip. It was mediocre. (I have had better...from cheddars) Then i was deciding between the brewhouse double deluxe burger or patty melt. I got the patty melt with the wedge and thin fries (because someone else recommended those). It was good, but something I could get anywhere for cheaper than $10.  Overall, the food and service in general at this chain is good. I didn't get to try any of the beer or other drinks because I had to go back to work, but my friend definitely enjoyed his drinks. The prices for everything is a bit high, but if you go during lunch it's not too bad."
Daniel C.,"Austin, TX",83,8,10,4.0,11/30/2013,This is a VERY 50/50 win lose establishment.  Sometimes it is quick and good and sometimes it is HORRIBLY slow. Don't make definite plans to get out at a certain time.  The bar is good.  Flatbread pizzas are nearly always great
Serena D.,"Morgan's Point Resort, TX",2,42,,4.0,6/13/2015,"BJ's has great craft beers! My favorites are their stout, red ale and currently- their summer beer. The food is good too, the pizza is awesome as are their healthier options, like chicken pita and salmon. The last time my boyfriend ordered a steak it was very salty, which was disappointing, so we may be wary of ordering that again."
Sam S.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,3/14/2016,"Came in on a Monday night, wasn't busy. Sat at the table for 10 minutes without getting greeted. The silverware that I received had food on it. We ordered drinks and an appetizer and I asked the waiter for new silverware. We got the appetizer and got our drinks 15 minutes later! When we got our meal the waiter finally offered new silverware after we ate the  appetizer and he  left the dirty finished appetizer plates on the table and didn't bus them until we got our check. We ordered a second beer from the waiter and that didn't come until 30 minutes later and by that time we were done with the meal. Most definitely the worst service I have received. He wasn't even apologetic about anything that was late or went wrong. Can't say I'm going back."
