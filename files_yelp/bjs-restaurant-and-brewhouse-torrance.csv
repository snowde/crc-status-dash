Jessica K.,"Burbank, CA",346,174,292,4.0,12/5/2017,"Yeah Yeah Yeah I know this is a chain but this location has great great service. And this is solely based on one waiter. Stefan helped us during a busy day during one of the Dodger games!  He was super friendly, welcoming, and attentive. His personality is amazing! I see that other yelpers have mentioned him and I can see why. He is one of the best waiters I have ever met in like EVER. Out of all my experiences- and that says a lot. Never let the drinks run low and made sure we were comfortable.  The food is not bad. I like the Ahi Tuna Salad. Happy hour is great for beers and munchies! Especially when they are having the $10 off of $30 deals is when I often visit! A note to management: Give Stefan a raise! For reals. Best service! Makes this BJ's stand out from the others hands down!"
Cheyenne M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/22/2017,"We USED to live going here after our expierance we will NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Our wait was about 40 to get a table for 2 people ok I understand that it's Sat night, but after that went down hill. Waited for 20 min just for someone to take our drink order which was a regular water nothing special and a drink from the bar after 10 min I got my drink, my husband's water nope took another 35 min to get his water.       Now mind you when we places our drink order we also placed our appetizer order, and our main course order which was a med well steak and hubby ordered the prime rib special which came with one of there cookies (I will get to that later). Then we got my main course first no appetizer nothing, my steak was cold like it was sitting around for awhile plus it was cooked rare. Then we got the appetizers which were also cold but somewhat editable, then we got our soup and salad, which was once again cold and cheese was on hubby salad he's alligeric to loactace so no cheese so he couldn't  eat the salad we told them that when we ordered the salad. Still no main course for hubby when we finally got it it was cold and oversalted, so we called our waiter over who then called who we thought was the manager Mario nope not the manager said ok Your whole meal is on us because we couldn't eat it then changes it to ok you have to pay for the appetizer and my drink ok fine just give us the check and cookie to go,      Nope cookie came to the table not in a to go box but at least  the right cookie, when we told Mario of the mistake we ordered the cookie to go he brought it out in a bag should of looked at the cookie before we left, we got in the car and they gave us the wrong cookie. What a crappy anniversary dinner thanks BJ 's never again should of went across the way to the other Restaurant."
Kristen Q.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",211,700,1391,3.0,10/21/2017,"Can't help it growing up in the 'burbs, I love my chains for the fair prices and decent size quality portions. Food: -Chicken w tumeric cauliflower: the meat was rather dry and cauliflower lacked being memorable or tasty, could use some work. Plus there's a $2 extra fee to swap in the cauliflower. -BBQ salad: enjoyed this big portion size and flavor don't measure up to Cheesecake Factory, though it's pretty darn good -Calamari: smaller portion than what I'm used to and lots of octopus served, was okay -BBQ ribs: tasty and alright  Service was good and pleasant, and acceptable for the restaurant being packed to the house, but it was tough to flag a waiter down towards the end of dinner. Also, great place to watch the football/baseball games, TVs are everywhere!"
Moran L.,"Torrance, CA",79,40,10,4.0,1/8/2018,"Honestly I don't know where the 3 stars comes from. I've always been really happy coming to this location, the food and service is usually really good! I guess they do get busy, and somethings on the menu are better than others. They probably could do a better job of making sure their guests are 100% happy with the food and service before they leave the restaurant!"
Denielle L.,"Torrance, CA",211,102,88,5.0,10/9/2017,"So I need to give this place 5 stars and a shout out! Went there last night with my bf and the place was packed! He accidentally forgot his debit card (he was sleepy, it happens). Anyway we called BJ's when we got back to my apt - 20 min after closing. Thankfully the manager answers, we tell hey the problem, she checks with our server Kayla, and Voila! The debit card is safe, the manager will even let us come get it right then and there. I commend the honesty, integrity and helpfulness of both of these women! BTW, the HAPPY HOUR $3 Sriracha Queso is FIRE!!! SO good! The HAPPY HOUR $6 Brewhouse Burger and seasoned fries were also great! Earlier that evening the bf couldn't decide which beer to get and Kayla brought him little samples to try out. So, with all that said, obviously we're becoming regulars!"
Mark C.,"Torrance, CA",129,576,668,4.0,10/20/2017,This place got revamped along with most of the Del Amo mall. It looks snazzier and the food portions are great. The service can definitely fluctuate in quality depending on how busy it is. But it's a great place for some solid food and if you're in the mood to watch some sports games.
Shelby J.,"Lakewood, CA",44,149,485,2.0,8/3/2017,"Well I will start this review off by saying I'm totally biased against BJ's. After shopping around through Del Amo Fashion Center, my sister was craving a pizookie and was ordering takeout. For some odd reason I can't imagine WHY the restaurant was so overly crowded that night so the restaurant handed out free deep dish pizza to the parties waiting, including myself. I dunno if I was just really hungry or they were having an exceptionally good night, but that night the pizza was so good! It was so good that I decided to give BJ's another chance despite the bad experiences I've had in the past, but sadly to say I was disappointed yet again.  This location is always crowded. Like always! I strongly suggest you have a snack or walk around the mall while you're waiting to be seated.. Our waitress wasn't really the best. She wasn't necessarily good or bad. Just kind of like whatever. The food matched her performance. I ordered their boneless chicken wings and deep dish pizza. Both were highly disappointing. The chicken was dry and just nasty. It tasted like frozen chicken they just warmed up in a toaster oven. The pizza was okay. It wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the money they charge for it in my opinion. I will never go back to BJ's again. The food is just nasty."
Caroline L.,"Torrance, CA",203,227,329,3.0,8/7/2017,Not a fan of their food but the pizookie is yummy. There is almost always a long wait for a table during dinner so try your luck at the open seating bar. We usually just come here late at night for dessert and small bites. Parking is easy and they open late.
Mark M.,"Torrance, CA",36,334,1086,4.0,7/24/2017,"Torrance Food Crawl #245 BJs is located at the far east end of the Del Amo mall so its a convenient place to visit before or after a movie at the nearby theatre. I was here for a late lunch and there were plenty of seats available in the restaurant. Rather than go for one of the lunch items I went for the New Orleans Jambalaya. It wasn't quite as good as jambalayas I've had in New Orleans, one of my favorite cities to visit, but reaching that level of cajun food quality is hard to achieve. There was shrimp (good), chicken (didn't leave any impression), and andouille sausage (very good with a nice mild spice taste). It also contained red and green peppers (crunchy and good), tomatoes, and onions (perhaps too much in the way of onions). These were found on a bed of rice pilaf which came out very nice. Perhaps not the best jambalaya I've had but it was pretty good.  Service was prompt and attentive. There was seating indoors as well as some on a small patio outside."

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,9/22/2017,"Well, unfortunately, BJ's lack of QA has reared its ugly head again.  After experiencing the best experience ever at a BJ's in Montebello, we just experienced one of the worst. The hostesses were pre-occupied with gossip vs. patrons.  We actually stood there and observed two hostesses converse about their private lives while we are literally three feet away wanting to get seated.  Finally, they took notice of a line building up and we finally got seated.  Rule one, keep your personal life at home and do not bring it to work.  Seriously. Once seated we ordered our appetizer.  Needless to say, it was not cooked all the way through.  How can you not cook mushrooms thoroughly.  One of the simplest things to do.  Needless to say, our waitress was clueless when we asked her to take them back for fresh ones and could not understand wy we would want a fresh batch.  I told her, feel it, it is stone cold. Needless to say, we got the good old fashioned roll of the eyes thrown our way.  She did not say a word and took the dish.  Someone else brought out a new dish and no words were spoken.  It was like the show' Westworld'  all robots but these robots are not thinking about the client and the client experience. We got our salads at the same time we got our food when we distinctly asked for the salads before the meal.  Very disappointed as our food was getting stone cold as we had our salads. So, our waitress never came back to give more water or ask if we wanted a refill on our beverages.  AWOL.  All I can say is that the food was not edible as it was stone cold.   We asked them for the Prime Rib sandwich a certain way.  It was not even listened to, as it came the way it would normally.  We waited for the waitress to make the orders right, however, she was staying away at a bigger table and we were just forgotten about in the corner booth. Needless to say, this location failed at all levels.  First impressions were a zero, the waitress was a zero and the food was a zero.  All of this could have easily been avoided if people just did their job.  Nothing fancy, just do your job and who knows how it would have turned out. We wanted to take advantage of Pizookie special, however, our waitress was AWOL and we did not want to waste any more time in a place that did not care about us this day.  Get Montebello to train your staff, Kristian in Montebello knows how to be an AWESOME server!"
Rebekah S.,"Torrance, CA",33,154,149,4.0,6/23/2017,"Came here for happy hour on a Thursday night.  There is a large assortment of drinks available with $1 off for happy hour. I got the berry burst brew (berry flavored beer), it was really good and not very sweet! My friend got the watermelon margarita, which was good as well.  Food choices during happy hour is pretty good too. All appetizer plates, shareable flatbreads and buffalo wings are $2 off. We got the calamari and margherita flatbread. Both were very delicious and enough for the two of us to share for happy hour! Both plates are approximately $11.50 regularly with $2 off for happy hour.  The happy hour menu was a little more pricy than other places, I will admit. We'll probably still stop in for drinks in the future."
Josephine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",92,425,1832,2.0,8/14/2017,"I came here for dinner with husband's family on Sunday night in August. Before I left the house, I used the bj's app to put my name on wait list. Once we got there, I went to desk to mention my name on wait list. Then we waited 10-15min for table and sat in a dimly lighted booth. Everyone had to use their flashlight on their cellphone to read the menu. The funny thing is the specials for that night was pork chops and 3 family members wanted pork chops and the waitress said no pork chops that night so they were highly disappointed. This is why I gave 2 stars if they don't have pork chops then don't promote it on the menu. The waitress was good on refills but busy with other tables. I wish the booth wasn't so dimly lit. I also used $10off $35 coupon from the app but the waitress forgot to deduct it from the pay heck. don't think I would go back to this location."
Amanda S.,"Lomita, CA",0,9,1,5.0,1/6/2018,"Did you really go to BJ's if you didn't get a pizookie? Usually when I come the service is pretty average and the wait tends to be long for food. Today they forgot my brothers fries for his order which was understandable considering how busy they were, but JEANNA did an awesome job of making up for it. Thank you Jeanna, you were great!"
Jennifer B.,"Los Angeles, CA",96,657,3811,4.0,2/23/2017,"YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: 46/100 Lunch and a movie, Hubbers said.  We haven't been to BJ's in years, and since AMC was practically next door (a few steps away, upstairs), it couldn't get any more convenient!  Got my usual Hef. Hubbers got his brewski as well (forgot what he got.)  Whoa, their food menu is extensive! It took us a few minutes to read through everything!  We agreed to start our meals with their honey sriracha Brussel sprouts and spinach stuffed mushrooms.  The only teenee issue I have with the Brussel sprouts, really, is that a couple of them weren't cooked through - still edible, though. The honey sriracha wasn't overpowering and the seasoning was nearly perfect. I didn't really get a good taste of the spinach with the mushrooms. The pesto sauce came off a bit strong but didn't really do any overpowering. We really liked this also.  I had the lunch portion spaghetti and meatballs while Hubbers got the fish and chips with the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad.  The spaghetti and meatballs were nothing to scream about. It was average, the typical spaghetti you get from mediocre Italian restaurants. I should have asked for fresh grated mozzarella and black pepper because that might have made a difference. It was okay, though.  Hubbers enjoyed his fish and chips. The salad is pretty much a caprese. We shared it and the key to that entire thing was the balsamic vinegar dressing. I could have had that as a meal!  Service was above mediocre level. Nothing to complain about on that department.  We noticed their ""MOVIE AND A MEAL"" ad. I asked about it and movie tickets were only $9/each (given that you dine there, of course.) So, Hubbers and I scored on that!  We enjoyed our experience enough to agree on a return visit in the future. For Happy Hour, perhaps..."
Mimi L.,"Torrance, CA",3209,1017,9804,5.0,6/13/2017,"I think the service speed has definitely improved a lot lately, sometimes we choose to sit at one of the booth seatings in bar area, it's easier to watch sports and the servers always come by faster than regular seatings.  This restaurant is a brewery too that's one of the reasons we love to frequent this place, I love their handcrafted brews like berry cider, piranha, Jeremiah red and stout. Also the Chicago style deep dish pizzas are just too delicious and they even have gluten free choices. Extensive menus with yummy small plates and light items are perfect for light meals, pizzas, burgers and wings are great for watching sports. Other favorites are Sriracha brussel sprouts, tuna poke, clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, jumbo spaghetti with meatballs, jambalaya and super salad with blackened salmon. They have Happy hour Monday - Friday from 3-7pm, Sunday- Thursday from 10- close at bar dining area, Tuesdays half off wines on glasses and bottles. Don't forget about the pizookies that's one of the best desserts out there. And they make very strong and refreshing Grey Goose martinis that I love to have as my non sweet ""desserts""!  Absolutely our favorite go to chain restaurant in the neighborhood, can't beat the food and drinks at both prices and portions! They sell their own canned brews at the restaurant ""to go"" area that we like to grab a few to take home after our meals here or whenever we do take outs, it's quite convenient for a beer lover like me!"
Mandy M.,"Bellflower, CA",15,12,2,1.0,12/21/2017,"I tried making a reservation for party of 6 for a company Christmas lunch. Apparently, they can only take a party of 7. They couldn't make an exception because we were short 1 person. Poor quality in customer service."
Vijayendra Y.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,5,1,1.0,12/22/2017,Called in to find out approximate wait time but i was told we are not allowed to mention wait time on phone. Thats not cool
Sandy L.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",103,45,84,1.0,4/3/2017,"I've been to this location before, but after my visit last night, I'll never be back here. It was a large party and we went around in a circle to give our orders one by one. My boyfriend was the last place his order. We all waited about 15-20 minutes and we all got our food except my boyfriend. Didn't think anything of it because it was ribs- thought it just took longer to make. I asked our server where his food was and she apologized and said it was coming. She came back to tell us ""the food wasn't made properly"" and suggested we ""reorder the food"". Then came back out and asked him what sides he ordered. Obviously she forgot to place his order. 35 minutes pass and STILL no food. I asked her again and even asked our food runner- ""it's coming"".  It got to a point where it was getting intolerable and I asked to speak to a manager. He apologized and said he would take care of his food. The server didn't even offer to comp his food after multiple times of asking her where the food was. On top of everything, it took our server another 15-20 minutes to give us our checks, after giving us boxes, even though she had it in her pocket."
DONNA P.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,68,56,1.0,11/11/2017,"Came in for breakfast and ordered for starters coucous Mac and cheese I've never had it before so I thought I'd try it... I'm not sure but when I got it it came with a black hair in it is that an extra surprise ??? I showed my waitress and she said "" It must be my hair "" is that supposed to make it better I feel like throwing up now !!!!!"
Simon M.,"Indio, CA",60,8,3,2.0,8/4/2017,"This was a redemption visit after 3 failed attempts to have good pizza. Unfortunately, we can't come back after wet, saucy pepperoni pizza that virtually fell apart when attempted to pick up with spatula.  BJ's has grown and has many locations, but the quality will remain a thing of the past."
C J.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,68,,4.0,9/11/2017,"I really like this place. I'm not sure why I love the vibe so much but I do. It's a pretty good sports bar as well with a very cool bar area with lots of screens everywhere, even the large dining room. The place feels like a secret lair, or a private cave, both in a good way. It's an upscale place for a fair price. My favorite dish is the Lemon Thyme Chicken $12, lunch menu. It comes with brown rice and Brussels sprouts and grilled chicken. Absolutely deelish. It may be a little salty for some but low in calories. Always served promptly and hot. I've always enjoyed the food, and it's a GREAT place to watch NFL on Sundays. Here comes the negative ***MGMNT ARE YOU LISTENING?*** ... At least four times I left because no one approached me. Four times! Once I am greeted everything is fine from then on. But something needs to be done about this. Four times? If I didn't like the place so much they'd never seem me again."
Jose V.,"Torrance, CA",212,57,65,4.0,6/16/2017,The Food: I got the BBQ brisket hamburger... that thing was fire!!!  The service: the service was amazing! Our waiter gladly moved us to another table because the booth was pretty tight and someone even brought us another table after it was done being used!  The location: nice inviting atmosphere.
Jim M.,"El Segundo, CA",930,806,165,3.0,5/2/2017,"Had a business lunch here last week and it was a good experience. I wasn't super hungry and therefore had their half salad with a half flatbread lunch. A small portion and exactly what I wanted. Our server was attentive and great. If you're hungry I recommend avoiding their lunch specials menu.  It's a mall, but parking isn't too bad due to where BJ's is located."
Son M.,"Atlanta, GA",20,68,17,4.0,5/1/2017,"It's really true.  This restaurant does have an extensive menu.  I visited family in LA and we thought we would go out for a quick bite to eat.  I didn't know what I really wanted, so my family recommended BJ's and I agreed.  I'd visited Torrance a few years back for a family reunion, so I was familiar with the area.   Ambience: This spot appears to be a place well liked by many.  The hostess station is up front and you have to put your name on the wait list to be seated. The wait was about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, very clean and there are tables for large and small parties.  The restaurant is not well lit so I had problems reading the menu.  Increasing the lighting would be beneficial for many.   Food: I decided to order the gluten free pizza. It was difficult because there was so much on the menu to choose from.  One family member ordered the bbq wings and the other ordered the deep dish pizza.  The pizza was excellent, the crust was thin and the cheese tasted great.   Service: Our server was extremely nice and very attentive.  He made sure our drinks were filled and made recommendations since it was my first time visiting.   Overall the food was good.  I will visit again during my next trip to LA."
Ashley K.,"Las Vegas, NV",108,46,40,1.0,4/4/2017,"Normally, I don't post reviews for chain restaurants like these. But this BJs has been absolutely the worst BJs I have ever been to.  Usually chain restaurants are the same. Food and service wise. But not here. I came here lunch time on a weekday. It wasn't busy at all. Food came out luke warm. I'm not asking for my food to be piping hot. But it'd be nice to be able to eat the food while it's somewhat hot. The server sucked as well. He never checked to see how the food was. Never refilled the water. I always had to flag him down. Never will I return here. If you want to go to a BJs try a different location and not here."
L T.,"Inglewood, CA",0,21,2,1.0,10/30/2017,"I wish there was a negative rating. Yesterday my son brought me a pizza from BJ's Torrance location and there were shreds of wax paper in the pizza crust. I called to tell the manager and that ASSHOLE BITCH treated me like I was lying and trying to get something from her. She interrogated me like I wanted a freebie. When I first started telling her what was going on, she hesitated to apologize and I could tell from the lull in her response that she was going to be an ASSHOLE. The pizza had already been paid for, the previous day and was at my house, at least 10 miles from there, no way was I going  to take it back. She asked why I didn't call yesterday when I realized the paper was there, how long did it take to realize that the paper was in it, who ate the pizza, why I didn't bring it back, she eanted pictures of the wax paper, she asked so many more questions until she caused me to hang up on her. All I wanted to do was make her aware of what was going on in the kitchen that she ""manages"". In the photos related to this particular  BJ's, are pictures of the wax paper, I couldn't figure out how to attach it to this post. She REQUIRES customer service/management training."
Hammer1035 G.,"Redlands, CA",0,49,6,5.0,10/2/2017,"BJ's is one of my go to spot I like environment I like the bar I like watching their TV's. The food is delicious. I usually go their and order chicken wings ""appetizer"" But on this latest occasion I noticed that they add two other flavors to the menu. One them was Root Beer wings"" OMG the flavor and the crispness of these wings was off the ""Noose"". On the real!!!"
Bill S.,"Torrance, CA",7,33,,5.0,12/11/2017,"GREAT ATMOSPHERE HERE, and A good place to have a bite, a drink and watch the game.. the waitresses are always friendly. The menu selection is outstanding. The best BJs yet for me."

Jane A.,"Long Beach, CA",5,28,50,5.0,5/29/2017,"Celebrated my niece's birthday visiting from Australia with family and friends on May 28,2017 @8ish in the evening .There was a lot of ppl that evening but we were seated in 20mins to our table . Our AMAZING waitress Amber James was so friendly, professional , attentive to our needs and got our orders correct ... I would surely come back here again thanks to Amber and her great personality and hospitality indeed...  I had the chicken Cobb salad and my niece had the rack of ribs and BBQ chicken salad . They were very yummy and spot on with the seasoning and taste ... Also, the birthday Bazuki was phenomenal ! We loved it to the max !!! Thank you to the Amazing Amber James and team BJ's for the birthday experience  of a lifetime  especially to my niece who was visiting on her special day ... We shall be back again soon!"
Tae G.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,765,1929,3.0,8/4/2016,"This has never been my favorite BJs. Seems like service is always slow no matter what day, time, or month I go. I dont care for the mediocre customer service either.  Thought I'd order my nephew a quick pizookie on the way to picking up dinner at Outback's since I was a bit early. Negative! Sat at curbside calling the number on the sign repeatedly. After about ten minutes, I remembered I had the app and ordered online. Figured I'd pick up food and15 minutes would be enough time for a cookie to be done.  Not surprised when no one picked up the line again. After swveral tries, I googled the general restaurant number. Explained to Kiana that I had been sitting outside for the second time and no one was picking up the curbside line. This b**ch pauses for a minute then tells me it's probably because the other girl was making food in the back. Really smart ass?! If so, it's sad to say that there's ONE person making food, bringing it to cars, and answering the phone!! Luckily, the baby was in the car asleep because I would've been inside ready to snatch her up!  Anyhow, I got my cookie. The young lady was nice when she came out. I couldn't figure out how to pay for the cookie via the app because I had no table number. She showed me how to navigate through it and find my points as well. As for the cookie, it was alright when I ate it last night. Lol"
Julie B.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/31/2017,"Worst service EVER!!!!! Our food was cold and stale! It took us over 25 minutes to get desert, and we didn't even get what we ordered! Highly doubt we'll be coming back anytime soon or referring our friends there. So disappointed"
Den G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/8/2017,"Avoid. Avoid avoid avoid. I've gone here on my own and a few times with groups (6-9 people), and the service is TERRIBLE. I can't remember worse. The staff is friendly enough, but completely inept. No one knew what was in the Vegan soup (not vegan mind you, just like options) and the few servers I asked NEVER came back with an answer. They don't coordinate with each other, which did lead to a second free meal (that lack of coordination issue) but after about an hour of waiting for a simple bread bowl. They blame their co-workers or silently smile daggers trying to blame you for their inability to divide a cheque after we'd physically labeled who-got-what with a numeric key to make things easy on her. Don't go thinking it'll be fast to order or even get your check, even near closing time when you'd think everyone wants to leave. Alone or with a group, we are always seemingly forgotten. I've had servers spill on people SEVERAL times, at the start of the meal. If management is the reason I keep getting free desserts/meals, fine, but something bigger is going on. Maybe people aren't being paid well enough, or you're just hiring friends, or your staff isn't getting training. I don't know. The food is decent at best, but over priced, though I enjoy the pizookies well enough. However, none of that is good enough to make me recommend this place under ANY condition."
Ric J.,"Long Beach, CA",56,14,,1.0,12/3/2017,"Watch out for the hostess' they will definitely ruin your day.  Went in on Sunday to put name on list and was standing near the podium, three females chatting way about something.. one turned to me and said wrong side of podium please walk to middle of the podium, like these girls are far each other it's standing room only.  Damn learn some customer service people.  Again if you are unable to meet the job requirements ask for some training it's ok and perfectly unstable.  Don't ruin people Sunday."
Giacomo M.,"Torrance, CA",0,32,1,1.0,11/15/2017,"I do no know what happened to this place! We were there a couple of weeks ago and I was so very disappointed with food, very small portions and the shrimps looked raw we had to send it back and the plate did not look anywhere near the photo on the menu. We ordered a deep dish pizza the crust was no where near what shows on the menu as well, I brought it up to the server and she said that's the way they make it here. I spent over $50 for two and there after I had to go in the mall food court to buy something else because I was still hungry. Very disappointing place was never like this before will never see me again."
Warren T.,"Torrance, CA",322,373,536,4.0,6/26/2016,"My department decided to treat me out here for my first week of work. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon and loved it! Every BJ's I go to, I get the same great quality. Also ordered their signature root beer that they brew themselves. It's unlimited refills and comes in a cold glass. I returned in one week because there was a BOGO coupon on yelp. I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and the lemon thyme chicken. Both were flavorful, but I definitely enjoyed the lemon thyme chicken more. The spices on the chicken were excellent. I know I sound like a pig, but I ate it for both lunch and dinner."
Desire D.,"Southern California, CA",212,93,8,1.0,6/28/2017,"No surprise of all the NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE FOR HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! We recently dined here and our server ROGELIO was INATTENTIVE, RUDE and BEYOND UNPROFESSIONAL. He did not even check up on our table once, for the entire meal he was nowhere to be found and the restaurant was not even busy at that time.  He's a NEGATIVE REFLECTION OF THE BUSINESS LOSING BJ'S LOTS OF $$ due to his lack of service. We were ready to order more drinks and desserts but since our server neglected his job we didn't. ***AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS***"
Lidia A.,"Gardena, CA",103,2,,1.0,12/26/2017,"The worst customer service I have ever encountered. I was immediately met with a rude hostess who apparently had a bad day and decided to take it out on me and my companions. I had two children with me who were looking forward to eating pizza here and wanted to eat pizza from BJs. The manager was called and handled it in a mediocre manner. Then to undermine the situation, the manager decided to have a ""talk"" with the hostess, but instead they laughed in an overt manner. I will not be coming back to BJs restaurant, I will settle for something else."
Anna R.,"Fort Worth, TX",11,226,1114,3.0,6/24/2016,"For some reason I was never a huge fan of BJ's. Not a big fan of deep dish pizzas, their pastas are whatever, and somehow their service always seems to be really slow. Today I tried something different: SEARED AHI SALAD: Baby field greens, napa cabbage, romaine, red bell peppers, tomatoes, avacado, pickled cucumber, cilantro, wasabi, crisp wonton strips and green onions tossed with rice wine vinaigrette - I was quite impressed with their salad. The dressing was good and the seared ahi was okay too. But the salad's around $15 and I don't usually spend that much on salad. (The only reason why I tried it this time was because I had a BOGO entree coupon.) DEEP DISH ZITI: Penne layered with housemade meatballs, Italian sausage, pepperoni, Marinara and Italian herbs, finished with BJ's signature five cheese blend. Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. - Very cheesy, the way I like it. But not something I would want to pay $15 for again. The waitress today was very friendly. I was ready to leave great reviews about their service, but everything was TOO SLOW! It was lunch time, meaning, there are a good number of customers but the seats are not filled. It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch!!! Not because we were talking so much and taking our sweet time, but mainly because we had a long wait for the waitress to come by and take our order and a REALLY long wait for our dessert to come out."
