Giuliana M.,"Lomita, CA",113,5,,1.0,11/16/2016,I tried this with my boyfriend's family and wasn't too impressed. We went back three more times and received none to terrible service (he insisted that they're normally amazing). We didn't get any refills and didn't even know who our server was and aside from that the warm cookie with ice cream was over cooked both times we ordered it.
Brandy A.,"Torrance, CA",11,25,,4.0,10/11/2016,"I have eaten here a few times, and each time I go I enjoy my meal. I think some meals might take longer to make, so that's probably why you wait longer. The last time I was here, our meal was quick. I ordered the triple decker sandwich with wedge fries, my oldest daughter had Mac and cheese, my youngest had grilled cheese with the skinny fries and my boyfriend had a salad. It only took 15-20 minutes. We were there on a Friday afternoon. I have a child with special needs and going to a restaurant is not always easy for us, so the last time we came here it was a good time and the waiter (I don't remember his name) was very good. I will be coming back here"
Strawberrie E.,"Carson, CA",488,29,3,2.0,7/11/2016,"Slow service and cold food. Took us 30 minutes just to get a cup of ranch. Would definitely take advantage of the unlimited refill on root beer floats BUT they take so long to ASK for a refill that I'm over it and don't even care for another. For the price I'm paying on the pizza I feel like I'm paying for expensive fluffy bread with little to no sauce on top. Even if I wanted to make a comment or ask for the manager there wasn't a serve in sight to ask for assistance. AND the hostess can't do much either. In all, I would not return. ""busy"" Monday night or not."
Shelby B.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",172,11,7,5.0,4/29/2016,"our server Joe was amazing! He was very friendly and entertaining and brought me a pazooki for my boyfriend's birthday. our ticket was small but he provided great service, remembering my name every time he came to our table. the Parmesan crusted chicken is insanely good, and something about the side of mashed potatoes is magical.  thanks joe! 5/5"
Jose A.,"Inglewood, CA",13,44,19,2.0,7/5/2015,I've been to BJ'S several times but this latest time left a bad taste in my mouth. What I liked most of BJ'S other than the pazookies was their beer selection... Not so much anymore. The first thing I noticed about the menu was that their beer list was significantly reduced. I found out from the bar tender that they cut down on their Belgium selection and are trying to promote their house beers.  The food is still the same...the pizza and pazookies are delicious no doubt about it. This time I ordered the Buffalo chicken pizza on a Flatbread style....the toppings are all centered leaving a big space on the outsides. Stick to the deep dish style. Macadamia nut pazookie never dissapoints.
Dennis Y.,"San Jose, CA",31,108,121,4.0,3/12/2016,Came here for lunch with a coworker. It's located at the Del Amo mall. Plenty of parking available nearby. There's also outdoor seating. It wasn't super busy when we came so we were seated promptly. Our waiter took drink orders right away and gave us a minute to order.  I had the Asian chopped salad. Came out in about 6 minutes. Flavors were good. Ingredients weren't soggy. The pieces of chicken were huge. About the size of the square outlet piece of an iPhone charger. Pretty basic salad but was satisfying.  Only downside is the price of the dishes. It can get expensive; especially for lunch during the workweek.
Joyce T.,"Lomita, CA",55,25,2,4.0,11/22/2015,"Food is always delicious and tasty.  We order the wings extra crispy and it's perfect each time.  Dessert is the chocolate chip pazookie of course ! I will save the beignets for our next visit... they sound tasty. I have to mention the service has been really good - server checked in frequently, refilling our drinks regularly and making sure we were all good.   Planning to return soon !"
Alex P.,"Long Beach, CA",10,58,20,1.0,11/21/2015,"I never knew or thought if I had a party of 25 that we would get kicked out of a restaurant for ""ordering too many alcohol drinks"". Seriously that's what happened here. We had the patio area for our party and everyone ordered alcohol, none of us were even close to being drunk nor were we causing a scene. The manager felt that because 50 alcohol drinks (2 rounds of drinks for the entire party) was excessive and did not allow us to order anymore drinks. We paid our tab and left.  We walked to another establishment to continue our party and the manager called that establishment to tell them not to serve us (which the employees informed us of this).  We went to a third establishment and the manager from bjs called them to say the same thing. The manager from third establishment spoke with us and flat out told us he got a call from the manager at bjs saying we were ""too intoxicated"". After speaking with us, the manager clearly could tell we were not ""too intoxicated"" and accommodated our party. We had a great time and it was $1,900.00 well spent to have a great time without being harassed over alcohol drinks.  All in all, I strongly discouraged anyone going to bjs with any type of party."
Kristin D.,"Carson, CA",95,76,18,1.0,12/19/2014,"Yeah. No.  It was bad service from the moment we checked in, to the moment we paid the bill."
Antonio F.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",101,164,600,4.0,6/4/2015,"Hosted a Lunch & Learn Presentation for some clients. We reserved a room called Patio 1. The space is good for small group meetings. We had 11 people in attendance. We were able to set up a flat screen TV for the power point presentation. Our waitress was Hanna, she was very professional and handled the situation flawlessly. Because we were having a presentation we requested for the music and the tv's to be turned off and the manager  was able to accommodate. We were there for about 2 hours the service was great. We ordered 3 appetizer platers (not the greatest). Each client ordered their own meals, all the food arrived at the same time and everybody was satisfied with their selection.  I will definitely consider BJ's again when I need to host small meetings in the South Bay Area."
Sophia A.,"Orange County, CA",20,95,112,5.0,11/20/2015,"Stefan was our server on 11/19/15. He was prompt, professional, attentive, and overall made the dine in experience 10/10 compared to other times I've gone. Actually best server I've had at this location. Will be coming back and asking for Stefan! Food was tasty, freshly made hot, delicious, and reasonably priced."
Ms. B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,25,3,1.0,4/29/2017,It's upsetting when you see employees on their phones and not seating when there's a full lobby and empty tables. They past my quote time and I even reserved a table online. I finally get seated I didn't get serviced until 15 mins later. I finally got my food ordered and my entrees came out first before my appetizers. I asked the waitress how come my entrees came out first. She checks in the kitchen and comes out 7 mins later our appetizers. She apologized but then when we ate the food it was broader line warm to cold. It's just disappointing when they have this much staff and they are delivering cold food to paying customers when it expected to be hot. Later one of the food runner drops over calm Chowder at our table and we didn't even order it. The management really needs to train their employees getting wrong tables. They probably gave my food to another table. This is by far the worse I've experienced at the establishment. I came here for the pizookie but I feared by the time it came to me the ice cream would have melted or I would get it when the store closed. My advice don't come here during rushes. The waitress tried to fix it by comping out appetizers which I appreciated but then when our bill came there was added stuff. I told the waitress this was not what we ordered and again she apologized and gave us the correct bill. When we paid she came and apologized again and rang up the wrong table. This night BY FAR IS THE WORSE SINCE WE GOT IN TO THE ESTABLISHMENT TO VERY END. No manager came to apologize it's just very DISAPPOINTING!
David G.,"Long Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/15/2016,"Came here with my girlfriend, the food was good and the drinks were too. Our server Edwin stepped it up and made it a great experience, he was attentive, knowledgeable and courteous. We'll definitely be coming back!!!"
hao n.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,5,,1.0,6/27/2016,"I decided to come here because I did not want Denny's again for a late mean after work at 930PM. So I called to make sure they were open, which they were and happy hour was about to start so why not.... I walked in and was not greeted by anyone, I had to approach someone to be seated. but because I asked about happy hour they pointed me to the bar area, so I walked over there. Seated myself for a few minutes. No one brought me a menu so I got up and grabbed one myself. After taking some time to look at the menu, I moved from a table near the bar to the bar itself because no one was coming to take my order.  I got to the bar, and was asked by the bartender about my order about 10 minutes after sitting down. I asked about happy hour again because I was unsure of it and she said no because it starts at 10, and its been 10 LOL. She told me its half off appetizers and pizza. So I order 2 appetizers to go. I got my bill and put my card in the cup. When I got the receipt back to sign and tip it was more than what I was expected. I asked the bartender for another pen because it was not working and I asked about my bill being higher than what I thought. She then said, ""oh sorry its actually half off pizza and $2 off appetizers.  I was going to change my order but I did not want to wait any longer. So I paid the price and took the $2 off, being ok with that because I am expecting and assuming great customer service form now on because of the miscommunication.  45 minutes pass by and I finally get my appetizers, but wait... She forgot my spinach dip, so that took another 10 minutes. About an hr later I was walking out the door hungry as a MUGAFUGA. They did not organize my carry out bag right so the containers began to fall over inside the bag. The frustration in building up. I got home, and relieved to eat. I opened my bag of food. And notice the special poke sauce for the ahi poke appetizer was not in the bag or poured on the ahi fish. That is the main part that makes it taste good........ So I settled for the soy sauce I had at home. My experience was not so good. I should have went to Denny's."
Brian S.,"North Tustin, CA",250,366,881,2.0,10/11/2015,"Been here 4 or 5 times, most of those were in the bar, a couple were in the dining room. Usually service is not bad, especially in the bar.  Food and beer are decent, as anyone who's been to BJ's before is probably familiar with.  The dining room is another matter.  Today (10/10) went for a family birthday gathering with 4 adults and 2 kids which was not very good.... Called ahead to get on the ""priority seating"" list which really means nothing.  All that it means is that if you get there and check in at the same time as another party of 4 that didn't call ahead, you'll be one ahead of them on the list.  They told us it would be 20 minutes when they handed me the pager, which then took 50 minutes.  I don't mind a few extra minutes while a table is cleared, but that was pretty rough. We were then seated and it took a little while for someone to bring our drinks.   Appetizers came out a reasonable time after, but both were below average in quality and appearance, which was surprising, because I dine at BJ's at a regular basis and I know what to expect.  Also didn't look anything like the menu. Ordered our entrees while waiting for appetizers.  Food took a while, but then came out and tasted pretty good and was reasonably hot.  Was definitely a notch above the mediocre appetizers.   However, wait staff refilled drinks once and acted like we were troubling them to get anything (water, sugar for tea).  Also took about 15 minutes to clear dirty plates. Near the end of the meal, brought wrong dessert 15 minutes after ordering.  After informing them, it took another 10 minutes to bring the right dessert. The worst part came as we were getting ready to leave.  It turns out halfway through our dinner, the table was cleared of 4 (unused) appetizer plates.  There was a birthday card (unopened) with a gift card inside which was a white envelope leaning against these plates.  Somehow, the plates and the envelope were swooped away at the same time.  Nobody noticed because we were busy trying to eat our food, have a conversation, and control two small kids.  But when we all got up to leave, we were surprised we didn't see it anymore, and nobody had grabbed it.  I was the last one to get up, reached back to pick up my wallet off the table and that was the only thing there.  5 minutes later, I realized nobody had the card, went back and there was no sign of the it anywhere - spoke to hostess, and all but the waiter said they didn't see it.  He said he'd noticed it earlier, but not later in the meal.  I talked to my family and we were all in disbelief and frantically trying to remember who saw it last, which was fruitless.  After attempting to get further clarification there was nobody else left to speak to in the restaurant, so I then left.  Essentially, all evidence suggests a worker picked it up with the plates and threw it away, or (worse) actually decided to keep it for themselves. Won't be back unfortunately, not just because of this incident but the food and service also.  Worst part is there wasn't even anybody to complain to or find out what was going on.  I was tempted to call the police, but out of sheer luck was able to resolve the issue on my own outside of the restaurant.  Will not recommend this location to anyone, as the wait here was horrendous (and got even worse after we arrived) and service / food just as questionable."
Jesse F.,"Hawthorne, CA",20,6,,2.0,6/21/2016,"Got here asked for a booth at the bar and was told the were cleaning the table and it would be available shortly, then after waiting ten minutes and seeing a couple walk in and sit down at a booth I'm told by another host the bar area is first come first serve. Ok so I take a table in the regular part of the restaurant. We order ""appetizers"" and entrees. Our entrees arrive at the table 10 minutes before the appetizers so I inform the waitress we no longer wanted the appetizer dish we ordered so she says sorry the kitchen is taking longer than usual and leaves the dish at our table. I take one bite of the appetizer and realize it's cold I ask for my check and leave. Not once did the server ask if everything was ok. I won't be back to this place"
Sarah R.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,10,1,1.0,12/10/2015,"I am only giving this a one star review because I have to. Where do I begin...maybe with the drinks? Got here at 7, mostly everyone orders, 30 minutes later, still no drinks.  (We had a large group have our holiday dinner here tonight, 20 people in total. The waitress has either never served this many people because the service was horrendous, or she was completely overbooked on tables. Either way, terrible and management should be aware.) After 30 minutes of waiting for drinks, mine finally arrived, last. She seemed more concered with pushing ""pre drink orders"" to make sure drinks kept flowing and telling us how wasted she got on fireball the night before. If she spent as much time making sure we had our drinks and our food on time and less time on making friends, this review may have actually been decent.  4 appetizer plates, all cold and disgusting. Nothing else to say about that.  Most entrees came before soups and salads.  She made excuse after excuse instead of just making things happen. They comped some things out, which they should've done if they were reputable.  Still, I will never ever eat here again. This place needs to get it together."
Roberto C.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,5.0,5/7/2017,"First time visit really good experience! Ruben was our server and took really good care of us! He recommended Parmesan chicken and a barbecue chicken salad for my girlfriend, and both hit the spot! Definitely coming back just because of our excellent service! Highly recommended to request Ruben, won't go wrong."
Serg M.,"Torrance, CA",65,76,15,3.0,11/2/2014,"Came here reluctantly after my first choice was closed for the evening.  Evening started out bad when we (party of 2) got bypassed for a party of 6. Guy at the front apologized and said I'm sorry,  I forgot you guys were here. WTF? We got seated immediately after the party of 6.  Order Buffalo wings and a raspberry ice tea. Both were actually good.  No complaints there. Our waitress was very helpful. She recommended several items.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi Tacos. They were ok, but not for the price. 10 bucks for 2 tacos, a handful of chips ( which should be complimentary anyway) and sone sauce. It tasted ok but got an upset stomach later. For dessert,  got the piczole thing (forgot the actual name) with ice cream. It was good. Overall,  my experience was ok. I won't be coming back."
Peter A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",557,26,12,2.0,7/5/2016,"I try to avoid this restaurant as much as possible. Everytime I come here, granted we have large parties and do not call ahead, we are constantly met with rude service. I really don't know why this location has such a poor attitude in servers."
