Carolyn P.,"South El Monte, CA",2,8,2,1.0,9/29/2016,"Where to begin.... We arrived and checked in at 415 pm and waited until 445pm for a table. We were seated at table, ordered water, and asked for a few minutes to order food. 7-8 minutes later the waiter finally returned and dropped off water and took our order.  We ordered the ribeye steak with veggies and broccoli and the carnitas French fries. We waited and waited and waited...... Our waiter refilled water and brought food to the tables around us but never brought our food or checked on us. Another couple who was seated one minute before us were finishing their meal. We've now invested about 90 minutes at BJ's and all we've experienced is a drink of water.  Unfortunately, we don't remember the name of our waiter who was really the issue. We've eaten here before and not had any problems. We probably won't be eating here in the future."
Paulina A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",254,118,99,5.0,9/15/2016,"Came here on a Monday night and it was pretty busy. I had called a week in advance and spoke to a manager about getting reservations for a party of 12. The manager was super professional and nice about it. When we actually arrived, we got seated and waiting for the last two (birthday boy and his gf) to show up. We told our waiter it was going to be a surprise and he even surprised the birthday boy with us!  When taking our order of 16+ items, our waiter nailed it. He didn't even have to right a single thing down. That's how you know he's great at his job. Food came out and it was delicious. We ended up ordering dessert as well (pizookies, yum!) and even got a free dessert from our waiter for the birthday boy! This has got to be the best service hands down I have ever received at a BJ's, mind you I traveled all the way from Huntington Beach. JR was our waiters name. He was so fun, patient, and super friendly. We will definitely be back!"
Jennifer P.,"Torrance, CA",0,22,,4.0,7/3/2017,"YOu can't be looking for traditional New York-style pizza when you eat here; as long as you are good with deep dish, you are all set. No idea what they put in their pans to keep the pizza from sticking, but that's not semolina!  Cookie pizzas for dessert have basis in Neopolitan cooking, FYI ;)"
Lauren B.,"Marina Del Rey, CA",0,31,20,2.0,10/3/2017,Called 4 times trying to place a pick up order - finally just went in and the takeout staff was talking with what looked like her boyfriend and ignored me. Then while I waited for my food the poor host was understaffed and the phone was ringing off the hook and he was never able to answer it once because he was the only one able to seat people. Terrible staffing-where is management?
James T.,"Carson, CA",0,49,,2.0,6/27/2017,"Came in with family.  Waiter was fine at first.  Most of our food was good, but my prime rib dip sandwich was terrible.  The Aus jus as very very salty.  I couldn't eat it, so I asked for some hot water to dilute it.  It took over 10 minutes to get that so my sandwich and fries got cold.  And it took over another 5 minutes to get a refill on my soda since I was now so thirsty.  Now my food was not worth eating.   Gave them 2 stars only because the other food was good.  But it wasn't that busy and our server seemed busy with other tables to attend to our needs.   They need better service.   Even with all this, my server never asked how we were doing after he droppef off our food.  We also had a coupon for one entree free with another, which was accepted.  But when we wanted the daily special desert, we were told that we would to pay full price due to our coupon. Don't plan on going back."
Jeon P.,"Torrance, CA",150,3,8,3.0,7/9/2016,"The overall experience was definitely positive throughout my whole visit here tonight. I was welcomed by a lady in the front who informed me that half my party had to be present before we actually got seated. Unfortunately the lady who actually seated us looked and sounded less than happy to do so. But it was okay, fortunately our server for that night, Jeremiah, was great. He was super friendly and I felt very comfortable around him. (4 stars) I ordered the siracha and queso dip and chips as an appetizer for me and my friends. The chips were good, nothing amazing. However the dip was disappointing because it merely seemed like melted cheese with a bit of green onions mixed in. There was no siracha!  (2 stars) As for the food, I ordered a seared ahi salad. The ahi was clearly not seasoned well enough and it lacked flavor. Also, only a third of my plate was lined with ahi and I really wish I got more (2 stars). The avocado in the salad was a good balance to the very acidic, and probably too acidic, greens and dressing (3 stars). In conclusion the food was average, nothing too special. I did however enjoy my server very much which was probably the only reason I'm giving the place a 3 star. Would recommend for a special occasion/reservation!"
Mari S.,"Riverside, CA",0,22,5,1.0,7/9/2017,"Came in for lunch and it literally took the server 15 minutes to attend us. We finally ordered and it took nearly 25 minutes for our food to come out. Not to mention it was a bit cold. The service was horrible, I dine out a lot, and the service here was not up to par with other BJ restaurants I've been to."
Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3080,6372,5149,3.0,2/5/2016,"Meeting up at Del Amo we came here for some drinks and shared a large pizza. Drinks were fine, descent selection and fair prices. Pizza was ok, one of their better menu items. Service was fine, not stellar, especially when they are busy it can be a mess getting refills or adding anything to order. Restaurant gets pretty noisy, not an ideal date spot, but fine for a few drinks while in the area."
Teryn M.,"Gardena, CA",22,4,,1.0,10/7/2017,Worst and slowest customer service tonight at the take out station. I waited 40 min for some ice cream for my pizookie while the girl at the counter didn't even bother to ask if I needed anything. I had to ask multiple time about my order only waiting for some ice cream.  Also other customers before me were waiting a long time and did not seemed pleased.
CJ F.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",7,4,,1.0,6/18/2017,Service was bad. It took about 45 min for a pazookie. Our waitress was horrible. Didn't pay much attention or even looked at my direction ON FATHERS DAY. Smh
Darian L.,"Torrance, CA",10,6,4,3.0,12/4/2016,"So stopping by around 9 pm on a Tuesday with a group of 4, the wait was around 30 minutes. (Reservations are for larger parties, but they will ""put your name down"" if you call ahead of time). On the plus side you can order drinks at the bar while you wait and they have some booths to sit at around the entrance. You should expect a dimly lit bustling atmosphere with the occasional slow service, but at least you have lots of time to find what you want through their delicious menu items. [   ]  BJ's Favorite Deep Dish Pizza: $26.50 5/5 Safety Rating I'm pretty open minded when it comes to deep dish and pan crust pizza and I thought this was a pretty safe pick. BJ's Favorite in particular is one of their more popular ones so it must be doing something right. Eat it with people. Maybe 2-5 others to be safe (if you're alone it's okay, you can always take it to go friend). [   ] Brisket Burger: $12.95  4/5 Safety Rating Could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce, but maybe you like it that way. It was as if they reached the perfect ratio of sauce to burger, then passed it by a bit. It was quite filling and made me feel okay about spending $12.95 on it. [   ]"
Alissa G.,"Inglewood, CA",0,8,1,5.0,7/14/2017,"We Iove coming to this location and sitting at the bar! When we come in on Friday nights there are 2 sweet and attentive bartenders that have always served us, don't know their names but just know you guys are appreciated. Today we tried the Cherry Nashville wings for the first time and they were so delicious. We always have such a pleasant time!"
Kristina G.,"El Segundo, CA",89,57,5,5.0,11/12/2016,"Went for dinner last night and loved it! The del amo mall is a nice place for dinner and drinks!  It was Friday night so the wait was 45 minutes(too be expected so no biggie) but while we waited a server came out with pizza bites for everyone waiting which I thought was very nice! Our waitress in the bar area, I think her name was Jo? Was the best! We started with the favorite avocado egg rolls!! Our pizza order came out wrong and she took it back and got us a new one with a size upgrade no questions asked! We got a half chicken bacon ranch pizza and the other half the bjs Classic! Yummm!  My friend and I ended with a chocolate chip pazookie. Always a good night with one of those!"
Karen L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",246,340,482,3.0,7/24/2015,"Dinner on Saturday, 7/11/15 I walked in with a party of 9 and it took about 10 minutes for a table. It was pretty late like 10pm and it was still a bit busy. It's the usual sports bar-like ambiance with dim lighting and a bit loud.  Our server came by once in a while but it was still busy so we had to wait for service. I ordered BJ's original pizza and it's delicious as I remembered it to be. Their deep dish pizzas are the best! I've also tried their buffalo wings. It's not drenched in sauce either. I usually order them but I wasn't too hungry. Our party also ordered the pazookie trio. I was too full to try it but my friends loved it. I would definitely come back again especially for the deep dish pizza and hopefully make room for their famous pazookie."
Gilberto C.,"Carson, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/10/2017,"I wouldn't recommend to come to this place. I understand that I came a bit late and the employees were pretty eager to go home but they still had a couple of hours left. I was ignored for about 30 minutes until I realized that it wasn't worth my time. I used to really enjoy coming to this place, but after this experience I'm not sure if I will come back."
Amanda C.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,5.0,6/22/2017,Sierra Nevada sidecar on tap  Avocado egg rolls Deep dish pizza Any kind of pizookie All amazing
Rosa V.,"Whittier, CA",0,6,2,2.0,6/6/2017,Our server was great! Our dinner not so great. The menus were sticky. Unused utensils were filthy. We unfortunately found a small hard piece of plastic in our soup. The manager was kind enough to apologize and offered us another order but we weren't really craving one after that experience.
Roman C.,"Torrance, CA",6,6,,1.0,6/19/2017,"I called two days before on the process to get a table for 8 as I know they don't take reservations. They said I could call ahead and they would put me on the waitlist which would take 30-45 min at least but I could put my name in. When it tried to do it the day we wanted to come in they said that they don't put a request for a table of 8 and we had to physically be there. What is the process. When I asked to speak to the manager, Scott he was rude and said that it would be a 2 hour wait. Forget this place, never going here."
Jonathan A.,"Torrance, CA",80,4,1,1.0,6/30/2017,"Honestly, we had the worst time here last night. We had a party of ten, and they said it would be an hour and a half to two hour wait. The hostess was extremely rude. Half the restaurant was empty. They had about 10 empty tables. She told us when we do sit, we will not sit together and we will on two different tables. I asked if we could push the two tables together and she laughed and said no that is not allowed. We left to eat at a place that would accommodate us and who would be friendly as well."
USmell_Me ..,"Carson, CA",0,15,10,1.0,3/13/2017,Awful food and service. Our waiter had no patience and my sons food was burnt! The menu is over priced with boring food options. I won't being visiting any Bj's again.
