Oscar A.,"Hawthorne, CA",73,1,1,4.0,12/4/2016,"Service was garbage! But they seem to always give complimentary foods (fries) to be exact! so overall everything was okay. Burger was on point but they got our order wrong but then again they seem to always have an answer for the issue more (Fries). Waiter, was fantastic! His name was Richard."
Eriko Y.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",86,38,126,5.0,2/2/2016,"Came in Tuesday night around 6:30pm and we did not have to wait in line! Awesome! Caley was our server today and she was amazing! She was very attentive and got everything right :) We love coming to BJ's and indulge our guilty pleasure of eating pizza once a month. We would definitely come back for more next month! (We limit ourselves to 1 pizza night per month...) We had BJ's favorite deep dish pizza, golden beet salad, and birthday pizookie. Everything tasted great! I loved the fact that we did not have to wait in loooong line. Going there during the week is definitely recommended for relaxed dinning experience."
Sage J.,"Torrance, CA",67,20,20,1.0,4/23/2017,I am completely upset with both of my experiences here. Twice I have come in to eat or pick up food and the manager has been more concerned with hitting on his servers than helping out customers. Just disgusted with the way he talked and acted. Then to be ignored while he checks them out was obnoxious.
Ed S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,15,2,1.0,9/26/2017,"Story goes, my lady, brother, and Mother went to this BJ's location spur of the moment for my Mother's b-day. I was at nightschool so I couldn't make it. So, my bison burger and salad were ordered to-go with the assumption, it would be ready at the end of the meal. Nope.  It was the first thing delivered to the table. It was asked to be taken back. The waitress took it back promising a hot, fresh plate to go at the end of everybody's meal. Nope. What I got was the same beat burger that either sat out or was put in the fridge--it was cold (thank God I ordered a salad--which BTW sucked)  As I heard, my families meal consisted of uncooked pizza doughier than Pillsbury doughboy. When I got my burger, besides being cold (if it was taken out at the appropriate time, it would be somewhat warm--we live five minutes away), it was burnt. Charcoal. How the Hell do you mess up on a cheeseburger? Really. How do you mess up on the most common American food out there? Doughy pizza--sure I guess. But a flipping burger. That's one of my pet peeves in this world, screwing up something that is as easy to make as a cheeseburger that you make 100 times a day.  Please don't go here--if you here for the beer--just go up the street to the many breweries in Torrance. Their food. forget about it."
Jason K.,"Lomita, CA",103,524,101,5.0,12/7/2015,"Summary: Great drinks, solid food, excellent service, reasonable prices, and ample parking (except for when crowded). This is a great place to grab a bite or a drink before or after a visit to Del Amo Fashion Center. My wife and I have been coming to BJs for lunch or dinner pretty often recently. It had been a while since we had been, but then we had a great time and kept coming back. Usually we will get one of BJs many awesome house beers, the sriracha brussels sprouts, santa fe spring rolls, the ahi poke, and the queso dip. All of these items are delicious and affordable. We often aim for happy hour or Tuesdays since it is happy hour all day then. We also love the PB smores pizookie. Talk about a sugar rush. The service is always attentive and friendly, and the restaurant is usually hopping with people. As long as the experience continues to be excellent, we plan to keep visiting."
Catherine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,42,66,3.0,3/9/2017,"Food was ok, service so slow. Was here an hour had one drink each, waiter forgot to bring plates, mentioned it, then never brought them anyway. Got the margarita flatbread and stuffed mushrooms, both ok, wouldn't order either again. Husband got bacon cheeseburger, liked it, cooked perfectly medium. I had their lager, perfectly fine. Maybe our waiter was new, he seemed befuddled. But the slowness was a killer. We stared at an unbussed divider between 2 booths for the entire time we were there."
Peter Y.,"Torrance, CA",28,11,8,1.0,3/7/2017,"I was charged twice on my recent visit to BJ's!  $107.20 2 times!!! watch your credit card.  It was a fluke that I caught it, never thought to look."
Brandon T.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",89,7,,4.0,7/9/2016,"I have eaten here many times and every time i come theres nothing that really hooks me to want to come back. Today I had the sriracha queso dip and there was not one drop of sriracha to be seen.  Now for my entrée I had a deep dish ziti that was pretty good! The pasta was cooked well and the cheese wasn't too overwhelming.  I gave 4 stars purely because the waiters are nice and the service is good, 1 star was knocked off because of the appetizer and having no urge to have to come back other than big partied events."
Pablo V.,"Norwalk, CA",0,19,,4.0,5/15/2017,"Been here a few times.  Food is always good (not the best), but good. Service is also good.  Only cons is its popularity....so expect to wait to be seated."
Laurie D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,21,,4.0,5/31/2017,Although our first experience was not good The Mgr contacted me to apologize and sent coupon - very nice to do this!  Second time was much better!
Alberto C.,"Hawthorne, CA",6,8,8,3.0,4/18/2017,"Good place to eat, great service BUT THE Black manager lady is the worst try to ask some questions and I can't believe that she ignored me  SAD BECAUSE SHE IS THE FACE OF THIS GREAT COMPANY !!!!"
James S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",4,52,6,4.0,3/31/2017,"Out of all the BJ's I've been to, I like this location the best. Not only because I live near there, but it's spacious and there's plenty of parking since it's at Del Amo Mall. The happy hour is great, that is if you're a lover of beer and deep dish pizzas. I love their IPAs and their mini pizzas. Their other appetizers are also pretty good. Service is friendly and it's a great place to just hang out with friends."
Phil W.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,37,,1.0,1/9/2017,"We've eaten at a few other BJ's locations and have always enjoyed the experience, but this review is about the Torrance location.  We had a drink at the bar whilst waiting to be seated.  After being seated by the hostess, no one came to our table.  After about 10 minutes I called the hostess over.  Another 10 minutes before our server showed up, apologizing for his absence.  He placed 4 beer mats on the table and said he would be right back.  Another 10 minutes and he returned, saying he had to wait in the kitchen for a ""special order.""  I presume the cooks were incapable of preparing this ""special order"" without his constant oversight?  We finally placed our order and the food arrived fairly quickly.  It was not worth the wait.  The burgers (one ordered medium, a second medium-rare) were both overcooked and actually a bit burned.  Our server never returned until we were finished eating, and wanted to know if we needed another round of drinks.  Heck no (at least not here) - give us the bill and let us get out of the place! The drinks were good, the food was lousy, and the service probably the worst I've ever experienced.  Needless to say, we won't be back."
Lawrence T.,"Carson, CA",1,24,21,1.0,9/30/2016,This is a pretty cool spot to have a beer .. The pizza is good .... Just don't order the BS Parmesan crusted chicken it sucks its dry flatten like paper and not well plated ... Also the waiter I had yesterday was not friendly No smiles Rushed us to order No dialogue with him whatso ever he handed us a to go box without us asking for it ... Not friendly at all.
Rich K.,"Gardena, CA",2,21,,1.0,12/28/2016,"Sat in the Bar area and Boom...  Bad to the Bone service right off the bat.  Okay so it could have been busy at that time for the guy right?  Well it wasn't that busy at all at that time.  Food wise... i'm pretty sure all their food is frozen and all they do is heat it up in a oven.  So Sad...  Beers....  They are bland and lack any have no body or anything else.  I wish this helps you who read this decide on wether to go or not.  I'm never going back again that's for sure.  Maybe it was just this location?  i dunno i never went to any other BJ's before, but after today i'll probably never go to any of their locations."
Newton H.,"Delthorne, Torrance, CA",13,42,16,2.0,3/18/2017,"Seated quickly, then down hill from there. Menu said, ""ask waitress about vegetarian options"", she had no clue what it meant. Ordered 'crispy fried artichokes', she thought I said Spinach artichoke dip. Wife ordered salad with dressing on the side. Comes out covered in dressing. I order sirloin with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Steak comes out with potatoes, waiting on brussel sprouts. Finish steak and potatoes, then brussel sprouts arrive. Hot on the outside, hard interior. Very sad performance!!!"
Katie C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",109,124,75,3.0,6/5/2016,Food is always pretty good here and prices are quite affordable! Our server today was awesome.   They have several tv's to give the place a sporty vibe. It's almost always really busy in there so it's not our favorite place to bring a toddler but they were really good with her and their kids menu has many options. The bathrooms were really dirty though.  No toilet paper in any stall and overflowing trash.. As someone who worked in the restaurant industry for a long time I know this is completely unacceptable.
Jones B.,"Gardena, CA",0,13,4,4.0,11/6/2016,"the drinks here are exellent, they do not skimp on the alchohol. I stopped going to chilis because of the watered down drinks. no watered down drinks here! only reason for 4 stars is the huge tomato chunks in pizza."
Susie H.,"Hawthorne, CA",45,102,127,4.0,6/21/2016,"Food is always good. Depending on how busy it is, service is pretty fast. Today was the USA game vs Argentina, so it was crowded. Staff from the hostess to the waiter are always welcoming and friendly. Good dining experience tonight. I ordered a mini pizza, since they ran out they gave me a small pizza for the mini price.  **If you saved enough room for dessert, tonight only, you can mention you saw the ad for a free pizookie."
George L.,"Torrance, CA",55,151,361,4.0,12/5/2015,"This one of my go to places when I want beer and Californian American food. Predictable, affordable, easy and consistent. The other go to is Cheesecake Factory. Regardless of the type of service I get I still go lol. They periodically have new items on the menu I like to try. My go to beer is Jeremiah red. Not too hoppy and not to light. The usual appetizers I get is their sampler plate or avocado egg rolls or the root beer pork ribs mmmm I And for sure you can't leave here without ordering their pizookie!"
