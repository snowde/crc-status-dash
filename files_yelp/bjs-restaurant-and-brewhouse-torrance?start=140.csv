Andrea H.,"Torrance, CA",1,21,,5.0,4/13/2017,"Eureka, I have found it!  I have been in search for decades of the best baby back ribs in and around L.A.  I have gone to many places recommended by Yelp Reviewers, as well as places suggested by family or friends, but tonight I tried the ribs at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse and can say without a doubt they are the very best baby back ribs I have ever had in my entire life (and I'm elderly, so I've been to dozens of ""rib joints"" in my lifetime).  They were perfectly seasoned, the sauce was both spicy and sweet (which I like), there were crispy parts and juicy tender parts.  And, they were OHHH so meaty.  Just perfect!  We got it for takeout.  I called and placed my order, and it was ready when I got there and stayed hot until I got home. They have a Thursday special for $18.95 for a full rack of ribs. It includes a salad, two sides and a mini pizookie for desert.  There was plenty of food for two of us.  We selected a baked potato and asparagus for the sides.  Even the baked potato was delicious.  It tasted fresh-baked and creamy, and it was large.  The asparagus was cooked to perfection.  For our salad, we chose the house salad with a very flavorful strawberry vinaigrette.  There are other salads to chose from.  For our mini pizookie, we selected the chocolate chunk pizookie with chocolate chip ice cream.  OMG!!  So good. I had a pizookie at BJ's for the first time a couple days ago, but this was my first full meal there. I'm already looking forward to the next time.  Specials and prices may change, so check before going there."
Lissa M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",80,14,8,1.0,3/19/2017,"This is my third or fourth time trying this place. Each time trying something different. I thought I would be safe with a burger and fries. Wrong! Food was lukewarm firstly, burger no flavor and fries seemed old overdone and warm. I'd be safe in saying unless you're just popping in meeting a quick date, watching a sporting event. or happy hour for a drink and an appetizer pass on this place for dinner."
Karen D.,"Carson, CA",0,4,,5.0,4/22/2017,"I've been to this location twice , both times we got a server named Joe he was awesome great personality , first time I went with my boyfriend and he was so friendly ,  food was great and he answered all our questions being our first time their , the second time I went was with my parents for Easter Sunday, same wonderful customer service, as the first time !!   My parents loved it their and said they will be back ! And so will I"
Stephany C.,"Lawndale, CA",11,1,,1.0,11/5/2016,"My friend and I came into BJ's on a Friday night and our waiter's name was Duane D. So first off he seemed not too happy to be there when he threw the coasters on the table in a rude manner. After he took our drinks he came back and asked what I would like to order and I said I'd like to get the deep dish 'Great White' pizza and then he responds by saying ""You're so racist"" and my thought was like okay thats not really funny because clearly I'm a Hispanic female and you're African American and I know what racism feels like. But I just did a fake laugh and let it go. But then Mr. Duane comes out with my pizza and says to me in front of my friend ""Here's the pizza for the Trump supporter"" and walks away. Wow! I could not believe that came out of his mouth! how offensive is that to say to someone? Especially because I don't even know this guy, who made this guy a waiter?! To have the audacity to call someone a Trump supporter oh my goodness that's horrible. I didn't ask for a manager because never in my life have I had to complain about customer service and I love coming into this BJ's I've never had a bad experience here.  After the service I got from Duane D. I won't be coming back into BJ's I felt like I was treated in a very hostile manner all because of the GREAT WHITE pizza which I did not name! So maybe if Duane D. has a problem with the name of the pizza he should talk to the people who name the items on the menu and not take it out on people who order the items."
Jon D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1046,148,15,3.0,8/24/2015,"Enjoyed brunch with my family yesterday. Justin was a good kid server, doing his best with limited knowledge. The menu is too busy, disorganized and they have no gluten free options, so if you're trying to actually eat healthy good luck with that as your options are severely limited.  I enjoyed the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi fish platter and a garden salad with their vinagrette which was pretty good. Prices are reasonable and it was pretty clean. They did screw up several orders after being very specific which was frustrating. Fortunately the management was proactive in fixing the problem and doing damage control. If they can get it together better we'll be back."
Pat B.,"El Segundo, CA",0,36,8,3.0,4/17/2017,"Had a $10 off $35 coupon so stopped in for lunch. We were seated sooner than they had committed. We were greeted immediately, service was great. Ordered two items of the SMALL SHAREABLE, they ARE NOT SMALL, had we known, LOL. We each got burgers, only issue with the visit, wife ordered hers with no bun and lettuce, came with the bun. No worries, looks like they were training on a new tablet ordering system, so all good. Burgers were OK, fries were good. BJ's will always be a beet and pizza place for me."
Nelina J.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,2.0,3/14/2017,You would think that the manager would be nice but when I was ordering take out she asked me a question really fast and I asked her to repeat it and she asked me again with so much attitude. Extra slow as if I was stupid lmao like da fuk hello its loud in here bye.
Jasmine F.,"Lomita, CA",35,70,171,1.0,6/26/2016,"It's had to be about 11 when me and my friend decided to come here.  We were seated pretty quickly the host was very sweet. When walking to our table we automatically felt uncomfortable but we couldn't put our finger on it yet. Our waitress went to 4-5 other tables and skipped us numerous times. She also never greeted us when we first sat down as most waitresses should.  It took a while to order. So during that time me and my friend were talking. We kept noticing that the waitress was passing us over and over again.  I'm the one to speak but HAPPILY I stayed quiet because it was friends birthday. I called the host over and asked for a new waitress.  I did this because I'm not about to receive crappy service and not give a tip, when I can switch out my waitress for someone who is amazing and give them an awesome tip. With that being said the original waitress had an attitude and you can see it in her face. On the other hand, our new waitress was amazing and her vibe was what made everything turn positive. With that being said I would like to thank the manager because he really helped and also the woman who served me and my friend.  I recommend the jambalaya with either rice or mashed potatoes. I gave this one star for the crappy waitress."
Jaquelin R.,"Lawndale, CA",1,38,2,2.0,3/26/2017,"Food here was okay. I thought it could have been way better. When you walk in everything is really dark inside. The customer service was okay, but I didn't like how we saw our waiters make signals to the hostess to not sit us in her section. She could have been at least more discreet about it. I felt uncomfortable after that. Overall I would not come back. The food wasn't to die for or at least good. Parking is pretty good it's in a mall, so there is a huge parking structure."
Christina T.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,5.0,8/27/2017,"Came here last Wednesday for a birthday dinner. By the time we got there it was almost 10:00. I had to write this review because of how amazing our service was. Amber was our server and we agreed that it was the best service we have ever gotten at a restaurant. Right when we sat she was very attentive and she's extremely funny. She recommended a peach margarita that was amazing, she got a little busy throughout the night but made sure everything came out correctly and that we were satisfied. She was doing her checkout when we were still eating, but was very patient and let us hangout. Overall a really great experience."
Sarah T.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",33,18,1,5.0,10/10/2016,"Good food and a great atmosphere. Watched a dodgers game here with my man, and there are big screen TV'S so everyone gets to see the game. My server Hannah is the very best. She gave me sauce samples, was such a joy to be around, and really put out experience on top of her thousand duties around the restaurant. I highly recommend you be served by her and when her time comes she has to start managing. Amazing service.  Here they are also doing a promo (since it's the month of October and it's breast cancer awareness month) order a pink drink and part of your purchase is donated to breast cancer research. Support the cause, for I had a relative pass away due to breast cancer. Come on down!"
Mike N.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",189,63,6,3.0,8/1/2016,"I'll keep this brief.  I feel the food is good but service can be okay at best. Went to lunch today with the family and had to actually get up and find a waiter when it wasn't that busy. We were waiting for about 15 min and no one came by to even take a drink order. Suffice to say, food is good enough, but the service is not consistent. *edit* 8/6/16 Went again later at night (on a different day) for dinner with a friend and must admit that the experience was much better. Our waitress Jasmine was extremely attentive despite how busy it was. She was moving really fast which was nice and made some helpful suggestions for our pizza. I've gone ahead and bumped my rating by a star based off of how helpful Jasmine was. Still not quite 4 stars though cause of the previous experience which was awful. If I could do 3.5, I would.  So kudos to our waitress Jasmine for helping us have a better experience."
Tray Jamal G.,"Lynwood, CA",197,4,,1.0,12/22/2016,"So far my service has been terrible, I will keep you guys updated. But I am extremely upset I have been waiting for 30+ mins and it ain't even crowded ahah smh fucking shame. My pazookie better be fire"
Melissa U.,"Redondo Beach, CA",15,124,150,4.0,7/16/2016,"The service was great, Andrew/ Justin  was very fast and friendly. Constant check in and refills. The hostess in front were kind and cheerful. The food was not that great; which is the  reason I have the 4 star rating I did was for the staff. The burger was over cooked. The fettuccine Alfredo noodles weren't al dente the sauce was mediocre. The chicken that put into two of the ordered dishes was for sure a processed frozen stripe and way too salty. I don't think any of the food was cooked fresh. Which for the pricing of 10-15 a plate is a bit high. This place is noisy so don't expect peace and quit here. Lots of tvs for sports. Full bar and obviously this place also has their own brewed beer. Maybe we just order the wrong thing. Also try the piezooki they are delish and you can get a free one on your birthday."
Rc 7.,"Torrance, CA",0,23,23,1.0,8/25/2017,"Wooow (NOT IN AN AMAZING WAY) Food was disgusting. Waste of money, didn't bother finishing my burger felt I would get sick!  I have never gotten a beer so hot, literally my beer was on the bar for good 15 mins before it reached my table because that beer was not tasteful at all!!!!! Very disappointed over all!"
Ron M.,"Las Vegas, NV",50,42,6,3.0,2/20/2017,"BJs used to be one of our favorite spots.  There is a wide variety of food and usually seating is not bad even on busy dates.   Lately we cant seem to get a good meal.   In Vegas the deep fryer oil was so old that everything tasted off....   at this location we came in for a Sunday meal while visiting California.    My wife and one of our boys ordered the fish and shrimp tacos.    The tortillas were cold and they didnt even attempt to warm them.  The food orders came out so staggered that by the time I got my meal everybody else was finished.    We ordered the pazokis and they were ok... but took 20 minutes to arrive.    Its unfortunate when a good spot cant maintain quality of food.   I would recommend not going here.    They need to go back to paying attention to detail, very disapointing"
Agnes G.,"Calasiao, Philippines",0,15,,5.0,2/19/2017,"My experience was great! Sat at the bar since the wait for a table was about an hour. Lucky to stumble on a table at a right time at the bar and I enjoyed it. Had a great dinner with great company. As for the food.. I ordered a Bjs favorite pizza and it was hot, cheesy, and delicious. The crust on the pizza couldn't have been more perfect than it was.  Service was great and fast and even the server recommended a drink for me since I didn't like sweet and sour but I liked a splash of the white peach but it wasn't something on the drink menu. He recommended an awesome drink as he listened so high five to that! Thanks!"
Mike B.,"San Pedro, CA",416,452,1851,4.0,7/2/2014,"Exponentially better experience. Everything from the service to the food. Nice to know that BJ's seems receptive to their customers concerns... Will definitely be back to be sure!!! The Hawaiian Mahi Mahi was out of this world and this time, so were the avocado egg rolls... Our server Britton, was both courteous and attentive. A very pleasurable experience!!!"
Chris G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",789,1189,1413,3.0,7/8/2015,"The server (J.J.) was solid, but the food delivery was slow.  We had lunch on a not overly crowded Wednesday and the pace was SLOW. The food was good, spinach & artichoke dip (B+), and the mini lunch cheese pizza (B+). The restaurant is clean with lots of televisions for sports viewing.  I unfortunately did not get a beer, but that is always a reason to eat at BJ's - plenty of good beer options."
Carrie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,302,27,3.0,5/21/2016,"We went here on a Friday afternoon to have lunch and was quickly seated... Pros: The food was good coupled with the drinks. Cons: Although the restaurant was not packed, 30 minutes and a flag down later, we were given water. Service sped up and it went ok but it seems like this location has an abundant amount of staff with poor service. I will give it another try if all other eateries are closed in the Del Amo Mall area."
