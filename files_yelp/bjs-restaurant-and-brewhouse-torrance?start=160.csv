Brian B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",373,1302,44,4.0,6/18/2016,"Fine BJ's.  Just stopped in for a Pizookie.  Took a little while for the server to notice me...and for the Pizookie to show up--but they were busy, so don't blame them."
Ruth V.,"Compton, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/18/2017,I love this place and i am excited to go here together with husband. Its clean and very inviting. I am glad its close to my work place. Thanks
Lisa Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",815,400,1654,2.0,6/1/2014,"This location has really gone downhill. Considering BJ's used to be a restaurant I really enjoyed coming to, I was SOO disappointed with my recent visit. My party ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls as an appetizer to share. The avocados were creamy, but there was really not much else in the rolls.  I didn't taste any sun-dried tomatoes or red onions. Did they forget the pine nuts, chipotle peppers and spices? I think the only thing that was listed in the description that was actually on the plate was some cilantro sprinkled on top and the tamarind sauce. I would not get these again. I added a Caesar salad to my entrée, so that came out first. A white, all iceberg lettuce salad. Some of the lettuce was brown and wilted, and there was barely any dressing. There was no taste, and I definitely felt like I wasted my $2.95 to add it to my entrée.  Since they did away with my absolute favorite, Angel Hair Toscana, I was forced to choose another menu item, hoping to get something else that was similar. When I read the description for the Angel Hair Classico, the item they supposedly replaced it with, it just wasn't cutting it for me. So, I decided on the Tuscan Chicken Limone. The chicken was dry. There were two measly clumps of spinach on the side.  Really? THAT is supposed to be my ""fresh steamed baby spinach""?! ( ) Not to mention the garlic bread was hard as a rock. The portions were decently large, but to me it's more about quantity than quality here. I considered giving only 1 star, but the Handcrafted Root Beer was really good. Came in a chilled class, so it made it nice and icy. This was the only good thing that came out of the meal."
Jordan C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/6/2016,"My fiancé and I recently visited BJ's, the Del Amo Fashion Center location and O'BOY where do I begin. Our server was ok; however, our food not so much. We ordered 1 large BBQ chicken pizza and specifically asked for it to be half BBQ / half pepperoni with added pepperoncini's and a salad. We received our food about 20mins later and as I'm eating, there's 2 FREAKING blonde strand of hair in my food (my hair is BLACK)!!!! Grossed out at this point I immediately called the waiter over and showed him what I had found, he took the pizza back and thinking about it I don't recall him ever apologizing for it. Before walking off our server did informed us he would be going on break and another person would be waiting on us. While waiting for our food, this time it took much longer than before, I would've thought since the mistake was on THEIR end they'd rush the order but apparently not.   Our food finally comes out and the order is not the same as our initial order PLUS the pizza looked DRY!! Dry meaning as if it had been sitting back there for a while, which could of happened because like I said, this time it did take much longer for us to get our food! Upon our food arrive we expected to receive our the same order we initially order the first time; however, we RECEIVED a full BBQ chicken pizza with NO pepperoncini's! At this point we were annoyed, irritated and a bit impatient with your staff. What was supposed to be 30min lunch had taken well over an hour; our plans were to catch a movie afterwards but due to the screw ups and waiting games WE MISSED OUR MOVIE!  I did mention to our waitress that our order was incorrect BUT I told her we weren't looking to be here any longer then we had too, so we ended up keeping the order! The mix up and screw ups was just horrible and unfortunately this wasn't the end.  Lastly, we ordered a Pizookie and I specially asked for half chocolate chip and half Oreo.. They still couldn't get it right!!! We received a half WHITE chocolate and Oreo instead of WHAT I ASKED FOR!!! I just couldn't take anymore and was so over it, the miscommunication was beyond me. I'm not sure about others but when I specifically ask for something and PAY MY MONEY for it I expect for it to be what I asked for. I highly doubt we would be revisiting this location again."
Bonnie G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",132,776,676,3.0,7/14/2015,"I liked the food better here than at the woodland hills restaurant (should be the same chain wise) but we got here and the place was full no wait but it seemed as if they were short staffed. I asked for extra sauce and never got it. Half way through my meal the server said she'd be right back with my sauce never came back. The food runner who brought me my food I also asked them and they never came back. Food 4stars, sevice 1 star"
nicole l.,"San Pedro, CA",72,9,2,5.0,11/11/2016,Samantha in the bar was a delight.  A very crowded dinner service for veterans day and she made this veteran and her family very satisfied. My burger was cooked perfect and the strawberries and cream was a great substitution for my sons food allergies! Thank you Samantha!
Liz S.,"Spring Valley, CA",0,2,1,2.0,2/26/2017,"I give this place 2 stars not because the food wasn't good but just the experience was not good. We got seated fairly fast but where we sat was the deal breaker. First of all we sat at a table that was half booth and half chair, but the table next to us was so close together that it seemed we were having dinner with the people sitting next to us, there was no space for the person sitting at the booth to get out without bothering the people sitting next to them. Secondly the booth was filthy, looked to my right and there was a corner filled with dust and other trash, which while eating is very unappetizing. Thirdly as I sat down I hit a booster seat which was left underneath the table along with a napkin. Like I understand they're busy but I'm sure a guest would rather wait a few more minutes to receive a better experience."
Andrea S.,"South Pasadena, CA",1,23,1,1.0,5/9/2017,"WORST SERVICE EVER! Waited at our table for 15 minutes before a server approached us and, once one did, he said ""I know you think I'm your server but I'm not; that girl over there is your server. But I'll take your order anyway."" Same server brought food, drinks and utensils over, then pointed to another server (now a ""him"") and said he would be over to introduce himself shortly and take over service for our table. Server never came over to introduce himself, apologize or ask if we needed anything; he only only came out once to clear a plate and bring us the check of the end of the meal.  We love BJ's other locations, but will not be coming back to this location again."
Michelle G.,"San Pedro, CA",36,8,15,1.0,3/14/2016,"I booked my daughter's first birthday party here back in January for Sunday, March 13. I was told I was the only reservation for 30 for that date, so I would be given the larger outdoor patio. Sold! We were thrilled BJ'S at Del Amo could accommodate. The manager I set things up with, Scott, helped me tour the space and assisted in setting up the most expensive buffet menu for my party of 30. We would be paying close to $30 per person with the extras I requested.  On my way to my party on Sunday at 2:09pm, I was called by the manager on duty that day, Jennifer, who told me that ""instead of the patio your party will be seated inside."" This. Was. Just. The. Beginning.  The girls working at the front desk all need new jobs. My background is in organizational leadership and I train people, much like these employees, how to properly treat customers like they actually mean something to a business. **I have never seen or experienced such attitude from girls at the hostess position** every single one of them working at that location on 3/13/16 from 2-4pm needs to be addressed.  They all wore the ugliest, sour faces, and each one had an attitude to match. The receptionist at 2pm was rude to my sister when she asked about my reservation. They were rude to me when I asked for a glass of water for my thirsty baby. They were rude to my husband when he asked about what the heck happened to our private patio. They were rude to my mother in law when she arrived to the mess of my daughter's first birthday party and began speaking to her like she could not speak English. Fired. The manager straight out lied to my face when I asked what happened to my reserved patio. She told me that ""99% of the time, large parties are specifically assigned the large patio. Your party is just the 1%."" She went on saying that Scott had not told her my party would be on the patio. But over the phone, at 2:09pm, she told me my party would be moving from outside to the inside dining room. Sounds like she did have an idea after all and was trying to cover up their mistake... I spoke with Scott on Friday, 3/11/15 around 12:30pm to finalize my buffet menu. He assured me everything will be taken care of. Come Sunday, minutes before party guests arrive, a large party is seated where my party is supposed to be. They did not have a reservation.  The staff was making a long table for my party in the main dining room, an experience that is completely not what I signed up for. Luckily, there was a smaller patio that was clearing up that could kind of accommodate my needs. Even still, the staff that was helping clean and set up the area gave us attitude when he was WIPING DOWN THE TABLES. Unacceptable. YOUR COMPANY IS THE ONE THAT SCREWED UP. My other kids had to sit outside with my sister at a separate table because they could not all fit in the space, missing out on the party. The ONLY good thing about our experience at BJ's on the day of my event was our server. I forgot his name because he obviously didn't piss me off. He made sure my party had everything we needed.  When you don't put proper customer service training as a high standard, it shows in every element of your business. You need someone to go in and completely retrain your staff on how to treat paying customers with respect.  At the end of the day, the world kept turning, but I will not be returning to this BJ's. I don't want to relive the stress of my baby's 1st birthday. Sad."
Jeff S.,"Royal Oak, MI",101,273,61,2.0,4/24/2015,"This place is whack.  The service is horrible --- it takes 6-7 people to get you seated and the majority of the servers are mediocre at best. Thankfully, we ended up with one of the better ones.  The first two beers I ordered took at least 10 minutes to show up and both were flat. I had to send them both back and ended up going with a Sam Adams --- so much for the micro brews.  The deep dish pizza tasted frozen and was super doughy. Even with 5-6 toppings, it was tasteless until we added a ton of cracked red pepper and/or hot sauce.  None of the toppings are fresh -- the sausage is basically the same as Pizza Hut or Dominos.  The only reason I'm giving 2-stars instead of one is because of the Pazookie. I suppose it's hard to mess up a giant cookie with ice-cream.  At the end of the day, I dropped $75 bucks for lackluster service and a stomach ache.  This place has been going down hill for years and I'm sorry that I gave it another chance tonight. Never again."
K M.,"Torrance, CA",0,9,,1.0,7/19/2017,"Came in today to celebrate the end of Summer league.  Our waitress was pleasant.  I stayed behind to pick up a to-go order.  The gentleman in line before me was picking up his to-go order.  BJ's website apparently didn't list a soup in bread bowls so he wrote in the comment that he wanted them in bread bowl.  The cashier at the pick up area added and deleted a bunch of stuff so she had to call her manager, Mecca, to fix it.  Mecca made some changes and the order went from $54 to $85!  That cashier had to call Mecca back to fix the order again.  At this point, Mecca began to scream at this poor guy ""explaining"" why the website didn't work and she said ""to make you happy I will zero your order"".  The gentleman said thank you and this manager, Mecca, continues to explain ""loudly"" at him and packing his order with so much rage!  I was even offended by her action!  Mecca should NOT be in the hospitality business if she is NOT a people person.  BJ, you can do better than this."
Jeffrey L.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,38,1,4.0,1/7/2017,"I had a great time at this location , even tho my Raiders lost today !! The calmari was good also my burger was delicious the bar wasn't to crowded and I was able to enjoy the game.. I recommend this location anytime your in Torrance"
Alana M.,"Torrance, CA",1081,543,19981,4.0,4/4/2015,"I have been here only 2-3 times.  The last time was a long time ago because we weren't thoroughly impressed with this place.  My husband had a company lunch here and thought his burger was good, so we came here today, but the funny thing is that nobody ordered a burger!  LOL My experience on our visit on 4/4/15 Our server was very personable and interactive.  The only setback was that when he was gone, he was gone for a while.  I will say that whenever he was tending to us, he was efficient.  The food did take quite a while to arrive, but at least it was a level or two above warm! Items I took bites of: * Ahi Poke Appetizer had a lovely plating!  I wasn't all that impressed with the ahi poke, but it was okay.  The pieces of ahi were a little larger than I like, they were good sized chunks!  The little wonton triangles were cool in the presentation, however, I didn't really need to eat them with the poke. * Clam Chowder was super creamy and thick, New England style.  It had noticeable clam bits in it.  I really appreciate that the soup came out nice and hot. * Chicken Lettuce Wraps were tasty!  I do have a favorite place to get them from, but this was something I'd order again from here.  I think the Sesame Soy Sauce didn't complement the wrap, but I did like the Chinese Mustard! * 16 oz Bone-In New York Steak - steak with choice of 2 sides, we chose roasted asparagus & steamed green beans.  We ordered the steak medium rare, but for some reason, it was overly chewy!  The initial flavor of the steak was really great, but then the steak left a lot to be desired after having to really chew it.  The asparagus was super stringy and too much effort to eat, so we notified the server and he asked us what other side we wanted.  Nice job!!  The green beans were okay, nothing special, but some crispy bacon bits might have added an extra level of flavor to them. * White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes were brought out as a replacement for our asparagus.  Thank you!  And I must add that these are excellent in flavor and texture!   These items I either barely tasted or didn't taste: * Barbeque Pulled Pork Sandwich - pork tossed in their smoked BBQ Ranch Sauce and topped with crispy onion strings * BJ's Barbeque Lunch Platter - a pulled pork slider and a spiced chicken breast, crispy‑thin seasoned fries, & coleslaw * Soup & Salad Combo (Caesar Salad & Chicken Tortilla Soup) - they don't offer the UNLIMITED combo on the weekends.  I thought the soup was too acidic for my liking.  I did pick out some of the avocado pieces along with the tortilla strips.  The server poured the soup on top of the accompanying toppings as soon as he was in front of us.  That was pretty cool!  I like the lime wedge which is speared so you can grab it easily.  (   ) * Carnitas Fries sans Cilantro - shredded pork with roasted green chili sauce and a mixture of jack and cheddar cheese which is topped with freshly chopped onions.  The plating of this is unique, it comes in a metal pan.  Money & Time Saving Tips: 1) They have a Movie & A Meal Deal, where you buy a movie ticket for $8.00 with any purchase.   2) There is a BJ's App, and by using it, you can view wait times & move up in line from anywhere, it offers Mobile Pay, and you can place your order in advance to dine in. 3) Premier Rewards Program - it is free to join.  You earn 1 point per dollar spent on just food & non-alcoholic beverages.  With 100 points, you can get a FREE Pizookie!  Go to their website to learn more. I wasn't really a true fan of anything I ate here today.  In the past I have had a pizza and think I would go that route next time I come back."
Uncle Lou V.,"Carson, CA",4,48,12,1.0,10/17/2016,This place was horrible today. Food took forever and there was no one eating. This was at 230 on a Monday. Bison burger was horrible. No taste what so ever. Salad that came with it was just chopped salad and placed on the plate. The new spicy peanut was ok. I usually have a great time here but today really sucked.
Amy P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1358,849,1152,3.0,4/14/2015,"Since when did BJ's start having brunch?! Our party of 4 arrived on a Saturday around 11:30am and was seated right away. The front page of all our menu's had brunch options which was pretty surprising but i LOVE brunch so i'm not complaining. Since we were bridesmaid dress shopping, I decided to go for a lighter dish so I wouldn't have to get a bigger size while trying on dresses!! EnLIGHTened Veggie Omelette with side of fruits ($8.95): Prices are a tad bit cheaper than I would normally see for brunch options elsewhere. The taste of the food was very sub par. My omelette had some excess liquid running off - substituted the feta cheese for pepperjack. Overall the dish was only 300 calories so I can't complain! Doesn't leave you feeling nasty or heavy after. This particular BJ's is located in the Del Amo Mall. Plenty of party and there are some parking spots for take-out orders as well."
Clark B.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",259,235,430,4.0,6/9/2016,"Spicy Brussel Sprouts from BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse. This place is never going to ""Wow"" you but they have a huge menu and some tasty dishes. I'm impressed how busy this place was at 11pm at night. Almost full in the bar area. So they are doing something right. Love the bar setup with the huge TV. Good beers on tap. Love the Avocado Spring Rolls and the Sante Fe Spring Rolls. Both dishes are perfect Bar food. Lots of flavor. The Spicy Brussel Sprouts not as good. It's so hard to make Brussel Sprouts taste great. The Ratio of good dishes here are low but they take the Cheesecake approach and give every option possible. You did catch more fish with a huge net. They also dominate in the Del Amo area. They are always busier than PF Changs, Ra Sushi, Buffalo Wild Wings, Stacked, and Lazy Dog. Smart business model."
Lia W.,"Gardena, CA",123,115,256,3.0,9/15/2015,"I really like bjs. I come here often for drinks and dinner. I came in on saturday, september 12 and it was quite busy. Gentlemen told us a 40 minute wait for 2. Didn't hand us a buzzer. Let the host know we'd be at the bar. Instructed us to come back and see the wait time in 15 minutes. We decided to go to the bar, had a drink. Went back 20 minutes later to check the time and finally received a buzzer! Noticed two tables trying to find their waiter for about 10 minutes at the bar, and they had to ask other waiters for help. Fast forward 30 minutes and we are seated at a booth. It took a while to receive our food. My crispy jalapeno burger wasnt crispy, and it didnt have jalapenos :(. I was really disappointed."
Toni F.,"Buena Park, CA",1,35,,1.0,10/24/2016,One star for the food.  Horrible customer service from the beginning to the end of my visit.  I guess I am not the only one who experienced that. I'll never visit this location.
Madison S.,"Hesperia, CA",99,8,,5.0,1/15/2017,We had the best server Joseph! He was super attentive and had such a positive attitude! He made us laugh and was very friendly.
Aimee M.,"Torrance, CA",1,5,,1.0,12/30/2016,"I can't believe I'm waiting an hour for this when the hostess said 25-30min.  BJs food is definitely not worth that wait and I would've walked straight out if I knew they were going to con me into waiting this long.  BJs food is what it is; slightly overpriced and pretty standard, typical American food.  But definitely not worth a wait more than 30min"
