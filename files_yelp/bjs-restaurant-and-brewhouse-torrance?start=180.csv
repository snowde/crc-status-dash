Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",148,592,545,2.0,6/18/2015,"Overview: This BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is an upscale American restaurant that serves a variety of popular entrees such as steak, fish, pork chops, and both deep dish and flatbread pizza. Everything here feels generic, likely due to the breadth of the menu, and I feel like there's not really a ""signature"" dish even though on their menu many items say ""signature"" in the title. Yes, this is the home of the pizookie (large cookie with ice cream) but really... it's not that special. Expect to pay about $20 a person here with an entree, beer, and a shared dessert. The Establishment: Located in a beautiful outdoor mall in west Torrance with lots of parking lots surrounding the shops. Next to a P.F. Chang's along with assorted upscale department stores. Dimly lit, and decorated with upscale materials. No problems here. The Service: The chefs are quite quick, my server was ridiculously efficient in processing the bill, but I did notice a bit of ""attitude"" and impersonal behavior (looking away from you as they take your order) here. The Food: Here's why BJ's gets 2 stars. Let's use the pizza an example because it's the last item I ordered here and it's fresh in my mind. As of June, 2015, you'll pay $25 for a 14"" deep dish ""BJ's Favorite"" which is equivalent to any other pizza joint's ""the works"" or ""supreme."" What I received was lower quality than any Pizza Hut pizza I've had in the past 5 years. Spongy, stingy on the ingredients, uneven spread, hardly any cheese... why didn't I just pay half the price for a better pizza at my local take-out pizza chain?? I took a photo below of the nicest section of the pizza, but trust me, 1-2 slices were sparsely topped and the layer of cheese is quite thin (in my opinion). I must admit I've only been to BJ's about 3 times in the past and have tried their burger, their pizookie, one of their beers, and a pasta dish, and every time they've been more bland than the equivalent dish at a ""specialty"" place that concentrated on one genre of food. With such a wide menu, I understand why BJ's jack of all trades is a master of none. Conclusions: This BJ's is in a wonderful location and is decorated well, but it serves very middle-of-the-road food at inflated prices. I hope that in the future, the franchise owners chose to slim down their menu and concentrate on perfecting a few choice dishes rather than try to appease every potential customer."
Ivie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",193,52,19,1.0,5/22/2016,"as soon as we got there, we sat down and ordered drinks.  Our waitress was not only rude but she only offered the boys at my table new drinks. I had to ask for multiple things twice.  When our meal arrived, this is what she brings me. these are Brussel sprouts, they were small burnt leafs of Brussel sprouts."
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,3.0,4/2/2014,"Let me make one thing clear: the food at this BJ's is great. It's comparable to any other BJ's location (if not better -- this location definitely does not skimp on ice cream served with the Pizookies). The lower star rating for this location is for service. On the majority of the times that I've visited this BJ's, the service was usually poor. For example, on my most recent visit, the server didn't even give our party (five people) enough table settings until we asked (repeatedly for it). We constantly had to ask for water refills and extra napkins. Upon (finally) taking our orders, the server only took the order of half of our party (it was only appetizers) and disappeared for a long time before coming back to our table to take the remaining orders. Perhaps it was to already put in some of the appetizer orders? I'm not exactly sure. That being said, we were clearly not done ordering (we ALL ordered appetizers) and he just disappeared midway through the process! All that aside, the food from BJ's is great and I always take out of town guests to the eatery. Of course, BJ's is known for its deep dish pizzas, but the menu contains other hidden gems. Some of my favorites are listed below.  ""Gourmet Mac & Cheese"": This is one of my favorite mac & cheeses. It can serve as an appetizer or as a meal for one. This creamy blend of rotelle pasta is combined with chipotle, garlic and three cheeses. It's topped generously with bacon bits and seasoned breadcrumbs to create a toasted, golden-brown crust.  ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"": One of the pre-set flavors on the deep-dish pizza menu, the ""Chicken Bacon Ranch"" is phenomenal. It includes applewood smoked bacon, Jack and Cheddar cheeses, grilled garlic chicken, red onions, diced tomatoes and ranch dressing drizzled on top. I love deep dish pizzas and this one is completely covered with chicken pieces, cheese and ranch dressing. It's definitely a great savory blend. ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"": If you're not in the mood for pizza, this is a good pasta option. ""Tuscan Chicken Limone"" comprises angel hair pasta (one of my favorite types of pasta) and pieces of chicken sautéed with garlic and topped with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, freshly steamed baby spinach and soaked a lemon butter sauce. Two pieces of cheesy garlic bread also accompany this entrée.  ""Chocolate Chunk/Peanut Butter Pizookie"": Did you know that you can get half of one cookie flavor and half of another in ONE Pizookie? Just ask your server! My default dessert choice is a Pizookie with half ""Chocolate Chunk"" (a cookie generously loaded with milk chocolate chunks) and half ""Peanut Butter."" The Pizookie comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It's best when the server brings the Pizookie warm (like fresh-out-of-the-oven warm). It'll be a race against time to keep up with the melting ice cream! ""Salted Caramel Pizookie"": To my knowledge, this is the most recent addition to the Pizookie menu, and it's a great salty-sweet combo. While some of the Pizookies are on the sweeter side, this one's blend of flavors result in a moderately sweet dessert. This Pizookie features a caramel cookie with pretzel bites and dark and white chocolate chips. It's topped with caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and a Ghirardelli Squares dark chocolate. On my most recent visit, I gave up my default dessert (see above) to try this new ""Salted Caramel"" option and I was not disappointed. The caramel cookie was soft and chewy, and I loved the texture of the chocolate chips and pretzel bites within. The cookie itself was hot (so the ice cream was melting at an incredibly fast rate), but it wws definitely fresh and the chocolate and caramel were just oozing all over.  ""Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie"": I only ordered this Pizookie once, but it was a delicious one ... chocoholics will surely be pleased with this choice. This Pizookie includes a rich, chocolate cookie with the distinct taste of Oreos. It's topped with three (small) scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse. I especially loved the dark chocolate cookie served in this dessert ... it's moist, rich and simply to die for.  All in all, BJ's provides delicious American cuisine, and when there are specials (especially the lunch ones), the prices are reasonable. I like the eatery itself well enough, and the Pizookie desserts (every one that I've tried so far) are phenomenal. But if you're looking for stellar service, this location isn't the best one to visit. You'll have better luck at other locations like the Culver City or Brea."
Carrie L.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/16/2017,"We typically love BJ's and look forward to going there. Tonight was such a let down. We got there and they didn't have any crayons for the kids menus. We were squeezed into a table and given a high chair with a broken strap. We had to ask for silverware to eat our food, which was not as good as usual. The pizza was greasy and the crust, underdone. The burger we had was slapped together carelessly with too much sauce, and cooked well done, rather than medium rare like we asked. Once we finished, the server had disappeared and we just gave up and didn't even order a pazooki, which is criminal in our family. Not excited about returning to this location."
D F.,"Torrance, CA",1,16,9,1.0,1/26/2017,"Husband and I went in for a quick lunch. This was obviously the kids first job at the front desk because he could hardly speak. We said 2 people for lunch then he left and went into the kitchen, it was weird. He comes back a few minutes later, we didn't see him at first but he grabs two menus and starts walking.  I see him look back and I ask ""do you want us to follow you"" and he so quietly says yes. We sit down and not one single person came to our table for 20 minutes, it was not busy. My husband goes up to quiet dude at front desk and asks if we could have someone come to our table. Quiet dude leaves and goes into the kitchen again, comes back out and starts chit chatting with a server at the front desk. Never came back to our table to say, someone should be with you soon, or we happen to be short staffed, nothing. We wait another 10 minutes and start to leave. As we pass the front desk where deaf mute boy is the lazy server girl says ""hope you enjoyed your lunch have a nice day"".  We went a few doors down to Lazy Dog Cafe and had an awesome lunch, Gilbert was our server and he was great. BJ, you blow."
Jay M.,"Orange, CA",62,1,,2.0,12/10/2016,Food was good but the SERVICE was horrible my goodness. Not only the wait to get seated was 30 minutes which is fine. But having to wait another 25 minutes just to take our drink order. Then finally ordering our food and that took another 40-45 minutes to get. Like come on it's NOT that busy right now. N our dessert never came out. So we just canceled it n got our check. Definitely NEVER coming back to this BJ's.
Nikkia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,42,344,1.0,5/11/2016,This place!!!! It's isn't busy today and it is taking for ever for my good to come to the table. It took 20 mons to get a drink. I have been here for over a hour and half for my food. And guess what they brought me the wrong dish  They fuck up my order!!!!!! Fuck you BJ I use to like you but the Torrance is fuck up  for go her if u want a nice dinner with your husband or a drink or the right order. This is turely my 1st bad reviews. I usually write good reviews.  Of u want to go to a BJ go to Fox hills  mall!!!!!!!!
Cleo N.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",180,117,542,3.0,6/27/2015,"Not quite sure what to rate BJs. I've  been to Bjs several times over the years. Everything I've ordered is fairly appetizing. On my most recent visit, I saw they took away the bruschetta that was like $5. I used to always order that. Their happy hour prices for drinks are a steal. I came after a movie and saw their HH prices for a mojito was $4! I had two regular mojitos and the first one I finished under 10 min. However, the second one it was more of a struggle to drink. Not sure why. It might've been stronger. I wasn't particularly hungry so I shared the carnitas fries. It was good but after a little bit it was difficult to finish.  I got a chocolate chip cookie pizookie for dessert. I think my food combo was upsetting my stomach cause after the pizookie my stomach was so full but in a hurting way. I think the carnitas fries had too much going on for my tummy to handle, so to add dessert was a bad idea.The next morning wasn't pretty. I would still come back for HH drinks though. Our server was pleasant."
Carlos G.,"Lomita, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/19/2016,"Worst service ever!! Had to wait 2hrs 1\2 just to be seated. That is even after asking about 3 times about our table being ready. So they finally go to clean our table and it takes them another 30min for the busboy to clean the table. So we finally had enough we take it to the manager, and the manager instead of just apogizing, starts to have an attitude towards me and my wife. Then as the manager is walking away to check on our table another employee makes a smart remark at the manager and starts to laugh in front of our faces as it was all a joke to them. It was 6:30pm when the party got there, didn't get seated until 8:45pm. SAD!! Mind you as we were a party of 15 with kids and with a one month old baby. All while they were sitting tables of 8 that got there after we did. Had to take it to another higher manager for them to do something about it.  Gave it two stars simply because the food was ""ok."" Waiter was friendly."
Jan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,89,52,3.0,6/22/2015,"Had the chicken club sandwich and loved it. The coffee is always roasty and strong, just how I like my men, LOL. Our waiter Alex was very nice and a cutie!!  ;)"
Amber L.,"San Pedro, CA",574,330,7123,4.0,1/24/2015,"Each time I've come to BJ's, it has been a pretty good experience. I'd have to say that the worst was some months back when I called to make a reservation and the hostess took the reservation and confirmed the time of 7pm. Here's the problem...we get to the restaurant in time for our reservation and the hostess tells us that they don't take reservations. I told her that we called and made a reservation. Surprisingly she admitted to being the one that I talked to. She said it wasn't a reservation, but just being put on the wait list. Well even though I was pissed about that, I figured I could go ahead and wait a little bit, but when she told me that the current wait was at least 45 minutes, My irritation finally surfaced. I told her that she should have told me that they don't take reservations when I called. She should have explained this wait list crap. When someone calls requesting a reservation, their expecting exactly that. To my surprise, she apologized and put us as next to be seated. That was the last time that I came, but I figured I'd give it another shot. Fast forward to last night, some coworkers and I went for dinner and drinks. We were immediately seated and served by Chazz! He was absolutely awesome! He was patient with us, because we did take awhile before we ordered appetizers because we were so busy talking and he helped us with our drink orders. Most of us ordered beers, but me and another friend ordered ciders. She got a cider and beer mix and I couldn't decide, so Chazz told me that he could bring me samples of the ciders on tap. That was awesome, because I had no idea that you could sample it first. He brought me a sample of the berry and pear ciders. Both were really good, but I chose the berry. Here's the other thing...I'm not a big drinker, especially with beer, but Chazz told me that they have small glasses that are the size of the cider samples that he brought out to me, only their filled up. Perfect! And they were around $2.00 for that small glass.  We orderes various appetizers: The hot and spicy chicken wings that come with a side of wing sauce and ranch dressing. They were good, but the problem is that in the picture, they are completely coated with wing sauce. When we got them, they were bare, with light drizzles of wing sauce, so all of us were trying to coat our wings with that little side of sauce. #irritating! The small starter salad: The Golden Beet and Arugula Salad is made with diced golden beets, arugula, and red onions tossed in a strawberry goat cheese vinaigrette and topped with goat cheese, toasted almonds, and dried cranberries. I can tell you that I am one person who hates beets, but because I know that their really good for you, I make myself eat them or have it in a smoothie (a la Whole Foods). This salad however surprised us all! It was freakin delicious!!! It was a small one-person salad, but we all took some bites of it. After eating the golden beets, I now know that it's red beets that I don't like, because the golden ones were mild and delicious!  The crispy fried artichokes were lightly breaded and fried artichoke hearts sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with lemon garlic aioli. They were okay...kind of small, not the biggest amount of flavor, but I'd probably try them again. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were also an okay dish. They are mushrooms filled with spinach and artichoke dip, feta cheese, red onions, herb bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and topped with a lemon pesto sauce. They probably would have been better if the mushrooms were bigger. These were literally bite sized, so you didn't necessarily taste all of the ingredients that are supposed to be in it.  The corn fritters with bacon aioli were little balls made with jack and cheddar cheeses and jalapeños, breaded and lightly fried. They serve it with tangy bacon aioli, smoked bacon, corn and green onions. Another okay dish, but I think I need to try it again.  As Daniel W said, BJs is located at Del Amo Mall where there's plenty to do. It's on the outside of the mall with a movie theatre and bowling alley upstairs. If you get there early enough, you can all shop in some of the outside stores. And whatever you do, don't forget to get a pizookie for dessert at the end of your meal...hell, even first! My favorite is the triple chocolate Ghirardelli!!"
Andrew J.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",3,141,2,1.0,4/9/2016,"I loved the Newport Beach branch, but this one was brutal! Maybe the entire chain is going downhill."
Douglas K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,5.0,1/9/2017,Pretty busy place especially on weekends. The servers were friendly and helpful. Very nice hangout spot for friends and colleagues after a long and stressful day at work.
Kandyce M.,"Inglewood, CA",1,16,9,3.0,6/15/2017,"My service was great once I finally got seated. The host however, Chelsea was super unprofessional and lacked training on how to conduct herself amongst and with customers. It's a bad look for the company as the first person whom a customer comes in contact with. I don't blame her however. It reflects bad on whoever is appointed to train and overseas hosts and their level of professionalism."
Christina Jane S.,"Hawthorne, CA",126,110,98,3.0,6/5/2015,"Appearance: This BJ's is bigger than the one in Culver City. I like it better because each time I come in, I can easily get a seat. This time I went in for dinner and sat at the bar and it was very clean.  Food/Drinks: I ordered a Jeremiah Red and a Caesar salad to start. There were a little too many croutons in my salad for me, but it was still pretty good. I also ordered a Buffalo Chicken pizza, Tavern-cut style. I feel like the ingredients were all centered and weren't as many on the edges of the pizza. When it came to pulling the side slices, it was a basically cheese flatbread. Service: We were instantly greeted by a bartender. She brought our drinks right away and was very diligent. She placed a napkin and utensil setups in front of us. The food runners were also very polite and thorough. They brought everything that we needed such as share plates and ranch when we asked for it. Because there was a birthday, the bartender ordered a birthday Pazookie for us. It came out in decent time, but as I was taking bites, I noticed it was under cooked. And it was definitely confirmed the next morning if you catch my drift. Overall Experience: I always go to BJ's for a Buffalo Chicken pizza and a beer. This was the first time I tried the pizza as Tavern-cut style. I would just prefer if they spread the ingredients out a little better. And I hope they get better about cookie their Pazookie more thoroughly.  I'll come back whenever I need my fix for this pizza again minus the Pazookie."
Groovy G.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,28,60,1.0,6/25/2016,"BJs stands for BAD JOB! Ordered on-line, set up for curbside pickup at 6pm. I arrived at 6pm sharp to find NO curbside parking zone. WHAT? How can you advertise curbside? Decided to pull up in red zone, called the restaurant to discover they had no record of my order... Even though I had an email confirmation. I gave them the conf#, only to find out they can't use the number to pull up the order. That makes no sense! So, after listening to the Manager blame technology or operator error (me) I said clearly the error is not mine.. I have the conf#.  She offered to expedite my order so I placed the order for the deep dish my son wanted and one of their famous root beers. I live 20 minutes away and was only there bc my son really wanted BJs.  She then told me there are 3 designated parking spots in the lot (NOT curbside), when I kindly told her there are cars parked that haven't moved in the now 10 minutes, she told me to pull into the red zone. Hmmmm I waited and waited. Observed that the 3 spots never turned over AND a delivery man came out and hopped in his car, which was parked in a handicap space. SHAME ON HIM! I guess he felt his time was more important than someone's need for handicap parking.  Finally, 40 minutes After I first arrived, my pizza was brought out to me. I asked about the root beer and she told me they were out. WHAt? Why didn't they tell me that on the phone as I idled in the red zone? Their housemade root beer is delicious... How could they be out at 6:44 on a Saturday night? At last, I paid my bill before I lost my cool. NO concession was made for my lost order, the 40 EXTRA minutes I had to wait or for the lack of root beer. No discount, no coupon, no here's a free cookie.... NOTHING!  Why do you offer online ordering if it doesn't work? Why do you offer curbside when there is no such thing available? And why would you make a gesture that my time mattered and you want me to return some day. Btw, if someone orders something on the phone and you are out? TELL THEM... Don't wait til the very end.  The only reason you get 1 star is because the pizza was ok... Not great, but edible.  Big bummer from BJs!"
Molly L.,"San Pedro, CA",137,3,5,5.0,6/24/2017,Edwin was attentive great food and great service .... going back for sure hot coffeee great chicken yummy !!!!!
Rosie P.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,2,1.0,6/4/2017,My gosh!  What a horrible experience!  Will never come here again.  Servers have attitude and seems like manager does not care about making sure the customer is a repeat customer.
Kevin B.,"San Pedro, CA",47,8,7,1.0,12/22/2016,"This place has good food , but we ordered the plate with steak and shrimp that came with a pizookie , and we had finished eating , paid our bill , tipped the waitress and thirty minutes went by and we never received our pizookie.....disappointing to say the least."
Karen V.,"San Pedro, San Pedro, CA",0,2,1,2.0,6/9/2017,"The general manger needs to develop her people skills!!! She talks really fast and extremely dismissive. I understand things are busy, but please.. learn to be genuine to the people who contribute to your paycheck. Customer service is a must!! I'll think twice about coming here."
