Katherine L.,"Gardena, CA",464,14,102,2.0,10/23/2014,I usually love BJs but today I have to give them 2 stars. Everyone was kind and asking if I needed help but the Pizookie wasn't what I expected.  My office wanted to do a Pizookie for one of our co-workers birthday as a surprised so I ordered one Togo and we sure did have a surprise. Turned out there was some parsley leaves or green leaves baked into the pizookie. Wth? Luckily BJs is only 6 mins or so away from our office but still we went out of our way thinking it was the best choice. Ended up having to throw it away but at least we still got to enjoy some of the ice cream.
Samantha T.,"Long Beach, CA",37,70,1104,4.0,10/2/2015,Food  was good and service was great...Hubby and I went to happy hour to watch Thursday night football. We had a couple of drinks. Myself apple martini and Hubby absolute vodka and cranberry..they had a special going on 2 for 25.00 where u get 2 salads a medium deep dish pizza and a pizooke to share. We decide to get that..hubby got the garden salad and i got the wedge salad. Pizza we ordered the chicken bacon ranch pizza and it was good. Overall there drinks are decent and so are the prices for the happy hour food.
Christine L.,"Torrance, CA",50,147,309,1.0,9/1/2014,"Have been here a hand full of times and each time I manage to get stuck with some waiter who doesn't seem to care. Normally I wouldn't leave a bad review for restaurant service because I get it, sometimes you just have a bad day and it is what it is; but at this particular location I've had 3 separate incidents where the waiter was for lack of better words...AWFUL. One can only assume that there is bad or lacking management in place?  My most recent incident was just last week. I got stuck with some waiter who must have judged me right off the bat. It was just me and my young 4 year old son. We were on a mommy and me lunch date. I don't know if he just saw us and thought automatically that I was going to leave a lousy tip or what....he blew me off multiple times, I called for him as he walked by and he just kept walking. I ordered some appetizers, my meal and my son's meal and then a meal to go for my husband. He only brought out my appetizers and put in my meal and my husbands as ""to go"" when I made it clear I only wanted ""one to go"".  He was just beyond a hot mess. I clearly was so frustrated that a young lady, she must have been a supervisor or asst. manager spotted me and came to my rescue. I handed her my card and paid for my tab. I just wanted out of there. He had the audacity to come back after I paid and brought me my check. HA! I paid already , just please get me my boxes.  I normally leave $20 tips no matter what the bill...but I made it clear by writing on the receipt ""Worst service EVER"" and left him a $10 tip only so he could see that if thats how much he got as a half assed server how much more would I have tipped if I had actually been happy. It's sad...I don't know why service is lacking at this location. They have decent food so it's a shame that I will be avoiding this place like the plague.   This has happened too many times and was not an isolated event."
Norah R.,"Lawndale, CA",155,503,550,4.0,11/16/2014,"Corporate food but you know what? My Santa Fe salad with salmon was quite delicious. My dining companions had a veggie flatbread and a burger...they enjoyed them and even said they would try this place again.  Loved the beer, we enjoyed the Tatonka stout, a few glasses, thank you. Perfect accompaniment to the burger and salad. It's a family restaurant, and we were of course within hearing range of a kid with one of those chilling scream-cries and the obnoxious parent who thinks it's cool to discipline their kid by yelling at the top of their lungs all while never missing a Facebook post. Memo to parents: pay attention to your kids, please? Sad what the family unit has become. We will visit again but next time we will dine in the bar.  Ivan was a great server by the way. It was quite busy and he handled the crowd with a smile and swift service."
Kevin A.,"Torrance, CA",327,171,104,3.0,9/23/2015,"Pretty standard for a BJs.  They staff was friendly, and although there was an NFL game going on, we didn't wait too long.  Happy hour lasts throughout the entire game, which is nice, since we were there to watch."
Karey R.,"Seal Beach, CA",128,621,635,4.0,8/11/2014,"Bj's was our second stop on our Happy Hour crawl. We sat in a comfy booth and order cocktails and appetizers. The avocado egg rolls and mini pizza were our favorites. The staff was efficient and helpful, even when they started to get very busy, we suddenly had 2 staff members waiting on us. We had a great time people watching and planning our next stop. This Bjs gets incredible busy on a Friday Night around 5:30pm. I would count on getting there slightly before that time to get a table without a wait. By the time we left we had 2 groups of people waiting for us to pay the bill so they could sit at the bar."
Brian R.,"Torrance, CA",62,123,15,2.0,11/4/2014,"I was a bit disappointed here.  We brought a large group here and I was happy to since last time we went to Red Car Brewery, which isn't my favorite place to go with a small group and I heard good things about BJ's.  However, looking back, Red Car really made the experience much better for us and BJ's was not interested at all in doing the same. Came here with a large group (15) from work, which in retrospect was a mistake.  We had a reservation, which they told us we did not at first.  When we asked if we they could still accomodate us, they reluctantly said yes and then we got a little attitude.  Then they realized they did have a reservation and were actually just unprepared.  They offered us two options, one of which broke us up (which shouldn't have even been an option) and the other which was across a few smaller tables.  After being left to stare at the tables, we started moving then ourselves, which they eventually helped us set up, didn't give us enough seats (about 12).  We again had to take it into our own hands and make our room to seat the other 3. We were in a good mood from the prior event, so we were still optimistic it was the right choice.  The service from the waitress was prompt but with an attitude the whole time, especially to the person who eventually was taking the check.  He remained polite to her but was not happy.   We ordered a good amount of food, and when we ran out of room on the tables, we asked her to take empty plates that had been sitting there, which annoyed her. The food was pretty good and so was the beer.  The servings were a but small so we had to place a second round. Sliders - tender and pretty tasty Mozzarella sticks - pretty good Wings - pretty good Pizza - ok, but typical for Southern Cali.  More.chicago deep dish style Spinach Dip - pretty typical I forgot what else we got, but nothing to really write home about. For beer, their Red was really good, their stout tasted a bit flat, and a few people really liked their Blond Ale. Overall, probably ok place if you are at the mall and want to sit down with a couple buddies to watch the game.  Food is typical bar food that tastes like something you would buy in bulk at Sam's Club and warm up in oven.  Servings are pretty small and beer is pretty good because they have their own selection.  I doubt I will return."
Alexis O.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",238,10,7,5.0,3/21/2016,Great bar seating. Never a wait here. The staff is friendly and cares about your needs. Love the experience!! Mike & Angela at the bar are great!!! Totally stellar!
Josh L.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",318,3,,1.0,6/22/2016,"This place is the absolute worst. I've been here exactly 3 times because every time it has been shitty. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and decided to give this restaurant a chance after the first and second time, but this is the final straw.  The first time I went here, my food took forever and when I finally received my pasta, it was so cold I didn't even eat it. The second time, service took forever as well (and no the restaurant was not busy). Finally, this 3rd and final time was he absolute worst.  At first we thought it would be a good time, and our appetizers rolled out quick but they tasted really shitty. The calamari was a little cold and the avocado egg rolls tasted sour. Then we put in an order for food at 10pm. Then 10:45 rolled around and we still haven't received our food. The two girls sitting next to us ordered two small pazookies the same time we placed our orders and they haven't received their food either. They began to get frustrated just as us. Once they noticed how pissed we were, they began to try to help us. So they brought out our two padinas but they didn't bring out fries with it because it wasn't ready for some reason. I mean, how long does it take to make fries??  Not to mention they didn't even bring out the pizza yet.  It was so bad that I will never come here again nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone. I will actually tell everyone I know to not go here.  I'm not sure what's the issue with this restaurant. I'm not sure if it's lack of personnel or just lack of quality workers, but they need to fix something here.  This was absolutely shitty. Thanks for wasting our time."
Grace M.,"Long Beach, CA",147,14,37,2.0,8/25/2016,"I'm giving this partucular BJ's 2 stars just coz i like their pizookie & my nephews and nieces like their kods menu, otherwise they would've gotten no stars at all. The waitress that helped us today, whose named Katrina B (#130), was very rude!!! I dont like the way she talked to the kids, she has no respect whatsoever. We should all respect each other no matter what gender, race, or age. She really pissed me off! If the kids weren't with me, i would've said something to her. I shouldnt have given her tip at all! Just a piece of advice, if you dont like what you're doing then quit!"
CRYSTI S.,"Long Beach, CA",26,72,9,2.0,11/15/2015,"My Husband received a gift card for your chain. He bought 2 pizzas.  No one said to finish cooking the pizza once we got home.  They were raw. And my main question is, WHERE IS THE SAUCE?  We had a large and medium, both different and they were dry, no sauce to be found. I even dissected 2 pieces  (should have taken photos) cut them up, showed my Mother and she agreed 100%.   What's the deal? Don't think we'll return. Thanks."
Monique E.,"Torrance, CA",1,13,9,1.0,9/17/2016,"Worst service ever. Went there tonight at 6 with my family and friends but my sister has severe food allergies and illness which forces her to bring her own food places. Already feeling embarrassed bringing in her own food, when we went to order she asked for a plate and the waitress told us no. She said that she would get her manager to come over. Once the manager came over she explained that no outside food could be brought in because if she got food poisoning it could be blamed on BJ's... don't know how that would make sense. The manager finally came over and  handed her the plate and in a very rude response to my sisters kind ""thank you"" said ""mhm my pleasure"" but it was not sincere. If you have food allergies DO NOT GO HERE. Made my sister already feel worse about being different. Definitely will not return."
Joe A.,"Carson, CA",140,70,140,4.0,1/25/2016,"We came around 11:30 and the place wasn't packed, well it was a Sunday night and the place was closing at 12 and we did get there thirty minutes before closing, but why did we have to flag a waiter down? To me that didn't make sense and the fact that our drinks took even longer. It got a 4 stars from because we did get two rounds and they did get us a little treat for our birthday girl."
Tony G.,"Lawndale, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/25/2016,This place used to be good but lately the service is just horrible.  Today we got our main dish before our appetizers and my wife did not get her garlic bread with her main dish.  Even after telling three waiters she still did not get her bread. She finished her meal and told waitress she did not get her bread and asked my wife she would bring over bread.  What for? I told her she is done with her meal.  We used to be weekly customers but for a while now this BJ's service is terrible.  If you go here make sure you ask to be waited by Joe.  Just look next time you are there Joe is the one going back and forth servicing his customers and everybody else working at their own slow pace which is unacceptable....
Dave M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,107,4,4.0,2/8/2017,really good soup and salad lunch special well worth the price the beer is ok parking is good as it is in the mall
Lo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,39,11,2.0,8/29/2016,"I hadn't been to bjs in over a year and I was highly disappointed with the service at this location! The food was delicious as always... But the service, oh boy it was terrible! A few friends and myself went for Sunday lunch about 2 weeks ago, our waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there at all. When my food came and was made incorrectly she said I ordered the wrong thing, if she heard me wrong or if I ordered it ""wrong"" you never argue especially when the customer is paying for it! Of Course I was charged for the wrong order and the correct order which took forever to fix. When I asked for the manager I was sadly disappointed with her attitude and the way she brushed off the errors as if they meant nothing! I'm not one to publicly complain but when your paying $100 for some pizza burgers and beers you expect to get what you pay for."
Chisato A.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",147,37,22,1.0,12/22/2016,"Came here on a Wednesday night. The place was fairly busy due to holiday season. I went in to the restaurant around 9 PM with a group of friends to get a pizookie. They had a fair selection of pizookie and definitely recommend the trio pizookie if you are planning a visit there. You get to select 3 flavors from their selection (salt caramel, chocolate chunk, peanut butter smores, etc) and comes in a fairly decent size for the price. However, the cookie was too sweet and the texture wasn't consistent. Some parts of the cookie were hard and some were gooey. In addition, table service wasn't on par for what we paid at the restaurant. The waiter rarely comes by and never checked in on us to see how we were doing. When we asked for our check, the waiter just gave us a crumpled receipt from his pocket (no folder to put in cash/credit card what so ever). At the end of our stay we had to stand up and go to the cashier to pay for our dessert. I feel that this is a place that you can hang out with a group of friends after a long day of shopping and do not want to go elsewhere. Otherwise, I would say go to a place where the server will actually give you attention and proper service."
Kimberly C.,"Torrance, CA",310,395,2270,4.0,10/14/2013,"This BJ's always has good service whenever I'm here. Of course, on weekends and game nights there are big crowds, but I've never had an issue. My parents are big fans of the pizzas - BJ's Classic Combo and Sweet Pig are really tasty. The Grilled Burger Melt is my favorite when I'm craving a good burger; but my usual here is the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and Ahi Poke. They are both appetizers. but the two of them together makes for a great meal. I usually order the mac and cheese without the bread crumbs  because I find that its less dry and better tasting without it (and ask for some extra bacon pieces on the side! More bacon is always better!) The ahi poke is always really fresh with just the right amount of seasonings and has such great flavor. On my most recent visit, I ordered the ahi poke like normal, but instead of the mac and cheese, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and order something different: chicken wontons and spinach stuffed mushrooms. I wasn't happy. The chicken wontons (you only get three, which, even for an appetizer is rather small) were just not good. The chicken was really chewy and I didn't like how it tasted. The spinach stuffed mushrooms were okay, but the feta cheese was just too overwhelming. I won't order those again. But aside from my poor food choices, I've always had a nice dining experience here. The employees are all friendly and attentive. I will be here many more times in the future, I'm sure."
Irene G.,"South Bay, CA",17,20,20,5.0,12/8/2015,"Tiffany hooked my honey and I up with great steak, spaghetti and other shrimp stuff. Best of the best service ever!"
Harmonie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",262,873,2920,3.0,1/12/2013,"Betcha not many people know that BJ's serves brunch on weekends? Neither did I and even though BJ's was not our first choice, it was a sufficient backup plan. No wait for a table but for a place with not too many customers during brunch, it did take an unusually long time for our food to come out. I didn't order anything super spectacular because 95% of the menu items are meaty or cheesy or eggy. But the one item that could be veganized was certainly satisfying: Oatmeal with dried fruit sans milk. Since it came with toast, I asked to add slices of avocado to place on top. It costs $1.50 which may seem pricy but I've seen other places charge way more for a smaller portion than what I got. My brunch options might be minimal but the ""normal people"" items had many options. I was mostly there to be with friends so I'm just glad that there's at least one thing I can have for early morning socializing."
