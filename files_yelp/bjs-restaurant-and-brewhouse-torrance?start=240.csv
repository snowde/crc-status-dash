Warren S.,"Carson, CA",2,12,,5.0,3/6/2016,"Me and the family arrived on a busy Friday evening around 6p.  Didn't expect much on a Friday night.  But pleased we only had to wait a few minutes before getting seated, maybe we just lucked-out.   Ordered a large deep-dish pizza, a beer and a pizookie for the kids.  Delicious! We were especially pleased with the excellent quality and service with our server, Stefan.  Thanks!"
Bennett K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",140,16,1,5.0,9/4/2016,"I always enjoy coming here but, my server Joe has made my expiernce 20x better. So Profesional and direct. I felt like he was here to take care of me personally. He knew my name and my girlfriends name after only looking at our ID'S one time.(this made me feel at home) He clearly knows how to do his job and has made my night. I will definitely be back soon!"
Kelley G.,"San Pedro, CA",0,1,,5.0,3/3/2017,"I'm a regular here, at least 3 times a month, I'm actually sitting at the bar writing this. I come from long time customer service background, don't write many reviews but Lauren deserves one. She was on point from the second I sat down. Kept my beer full and my order was checked on without me asking at least twice, they were a little busy. The food was on point, just got home from San Fran and I still like the clam chowder more here. Bread bowl is a must."
Scott Z.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1682,590,347,3.0,7/3/2014,"I'm going to say the jury is out for me on BJ's...one visit isn't terribly representative of a place unless it is great or horrible, and BJ's was just...just...okay for me. We came here prior to seeing a movie at the Del Amo multiplex.  There is ample parking whether you chose the structures, or the adjacent lots.  No worries there.  There is also over a dozen other eateries within walking distance, so if one place is jumping, it seems the other places work overflow pretty well. BJ's does have a pretty big menu...I got a salmon salad, my lady got a pasta dish.  Meh, they were okay, but not something super memorable.  While there seemed to be other items on the menu (pizzas, sandwiches, and salads) most of the menu is really high in calories.  I only saw 1/2 a page of lighter choices, and that's disappointing.   Although if you really wanted to sin, BJ's is known for their signature dessert, the Pizookie.  Which happens to be a pan sized cookie, served hot with ice cream and toppings.  Sort of like a cookie sundae or a hip-slapping, ass-popping, gut-bumping, rush of sugar that makes you go mmmmmhhmmmmm.  Seemed like everyone around us ordered one...or two!  Oh, America...land of the free and home of the morbidly obese.  Now I'm not saying I wouldn't try one, just make sure to share it with 84 of my closest friends.  With that much sugar (after a pretty fatty meal mind you) you could easily choke a donkey. Now, because we were in a rush to make our movie, we were able to get bar seating even though there was a 35 min wait.  Winner! The hostesses, and all were very very nice...the bar staff moved quickly and also did everything they could to make the experience worthwhile. I tried one of their in-house brewed beers, an amber, and it was ok...it was not a big production high-end beer...but it was beer.  It will eventually get you drunk, and no matter what it will assist you in making poor decisions.  Beer...it's probably how a lot of us got here. So BJs, big menu, close to a lot of things, decent service, huge cookie sundaes, and all kinds of booze...there is potential here. ENJOY!"
Rob A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2105,788,4022,4.0,11/14/2012,"Nice restaurant, located outside of the Del Amo Mall.  That means, it picks up extra foot traffic.  That translates into, it gets extra busy.  Come during the in-between hours and you'll be fine.  If you've never been to one before (It's a chain), they're pretty nice.  The menu covers a wide range from burgers and specialty salads to pizza, chicken, soups and  pasta.  If beer is your thing, they have a wide range to choose from.  So, go on it, and have them seat you at a table, or head to the long bar if that's you're thing. There's the web site to scratch your itch.  Giant TVs, with sports on, keeps things lively.  The place is large yet comfortable.  Darker interior sets a nice mood.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  And they stay busy. On this visit I had the small personal pizza and BJ's Jeremiah Red®; a nice strong ale that went well with the just-the-right-size-pie."
A 'Rebelde' G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",140,38,27,1.0,10/6/2014,"Normally I love BJ's but man Idk what happened to the BJsin Carson!  The ambience was the same as everywhere, clean, calming music, and not very busy at all. Thats why I am bothered with the way this BJ's was scored.  So I sit down at a booth at the bar tell my host there would be two more people joining . As My waiter goes to bring the extra  menus my nose begins to bleed probably from my lack of food cuz I was really hungry!  So I asked for some napkins. The waiter comes back with only TWO NAPKINs. Really!?!? Ok Maybe they have to keep their inventory real tight. I can understand.  After a few minutes he returns with my beer and doesn't comeback to check if I was ready so I got up towards the bar pretending that I did not know how the ordering went about. Obviously I did if I wanted to order from the bar tender I would've sat at the bar. Fortunately for this establishment ""the manager"" (he never introduced himself as the manager, or wore a name tag but he was wearing a light green button up shirt) stopped me from speaking to the bartender and requested the waiter to take my order.  I ordered an Alfredo Fettucini (with no chicken) pasta and salad lunch special and an order of avocado egg rolls- My favorite!  Ten minutes later the avocado egg rolls arrive and they look funny?!?! They were super burnt and still served them on my plate! I was quite surprised with this because I was not even that busy at the bar section. Really BJ's?!? I call ""the manager"" and he stopped me from finishing my statement and reordered my because of how burnt the egg rolls were.  A little rude but I liked his ""call to action"".  So I pretty much got all of my food at the same time... Whatever I was hungry. My avocado egg rolls were now delicious! The mozzarella salad was great and when they brought my Fettucini Alfredo IT HAD CHICKEN!!! What is this like Strike 4!?!  Really BJ's in Carson I just remembered that the last time I came to this same location my order was just as bad with mistakes and mishaps. Last time I received my order as I walked out the door because of how many times they had to fix my order.  I originally wanted to rate this place a 2 because of the quality, presentation and the BJ feel of the place but after remembering of my last visit this place NEEDS A 1. SOME OVERALL STAFF RESTRUCTURING. I really hope this review helps the overall Carson business and brand of the business."
Heidi L.,"Hawthorne, CA",125,16,6,1.0,11/6/2016,"Let me start off by saying that the service here is horrible! My friend and I enter the restaurant expecting to be greeted with a smile. Instead, the receptionist looks at us and he doesn't say a word. He just waits until someone decides to seat us. After she seats us down she gives us a few minutes to look at the menu. Then, our waiter comes with her hands in her pocket and takes out order. When she came back with our plates, we notice a huge dried spinach on one of our ""new"" plates. We give the plate back asking for new ones and yet we received no apologies and she just says ""ok"" and walks away. Our appetizer, fried calamari, first comes out. But it isn't hot. It's room temperature with a few calamari just in our dipping sauce. Then, Our pizza comes out. But once again it isn't hot, it's room temperature and the pizza wasn't cut so my friend and I struggled to cut through the cooled down pizza. As we are eating our pizza, we see another waiter just drop a few togo boxes onto the dirty floor yet he picks them back up and stacks them up with the rest of the clean togo boxes and proceeds to walk away. Our experience here was the worst that any restaurant can provide."
Denise G.,"Long Beach, CA",32,8,4,1.0,6/3/2016,"Waited 20 mins to get a server after being seated, then another 20 to get our drinks. Food is nothing special. Manager wasn't even trying to be apologetic. Yeah, never going back to this BJ's location."
Andy K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",59,27,4,1.0,5/7/2016,"Took an hour to be seated, an hour to get food, and 30 minutes to get dessert. But they were fast to take our check! We also got our food 5 minutes  before we got silverware, so that was interesting. I don't know our waiters' name but he looked like a Chad. Don't get Chad."
Yolanda L.,"Garden Grove, CA",1,13,,1.0,2/20/2017,I would have rated higher because the food was good our waitress outstanding!  The problem their hostesses...horrible unhappy people!  Rude and right out mean face gals!! Ruined our lunch because we have never been treated so rude!  Will not return to this BJ again!  They need to learn that the front desk sets the tone for the experience of a great visit!  They have lost customer service skills!  That's how rude they were!!!
K H.,"Torrance, CA",12,46,51,5.0,10/24/2015,Great bar tender ... Name was Mario ! Thank u for the service ... I was having a bad day and the other bar tender was very rude ... Asian chick ... Mario quickly changed things up ! Thank u AAA+++
Toni F.,"Lomita, CA",12,31,1,5.0,3/8/2017,"Had Avocado roll appetizer and mini Pizookie delivered...OMG, not only was it delivered on time, ice cream was packaged separately as I requested.  Food and Pizookie were hot...absolutely the best delivery service...well worth the extra money."
Krystal G.,"Gardena, CA",63,19,23,1.0,5/4/2016,"Yesterday, my husband and I decided to eat here with the kids. I wanted to see the hype of this place since I heard good things about it. It was much smaller than I imagined. Our server, ROGELLIO, was the WORST SERVER I have ever seen!! He was not polite, and took forever to serve our food. I clearly noticed that he served two other customers who came after us.  By the time we received our food, it was just barely warm, like it had been sitting in the kitchen.       My husband ordered our pazookie to go, along with the check and some take-home boxes. ROGELLIO came back with the check and boxes, but took 30 minutes to bring back the dessert. And then when he finally brought the dessert, it was NOT in a to-go box. So my husband asked if he could put our dessert in one of the boxes that he gave us, he told my husband ""no, we can't do that."" Oh, and the place was no where near crowded. Literally like 10 ppl there. So he wasn't flustered with a whole bunch of customers.      Overall, a pretty bad experience. I do not recommend this place to anyone.  PS: BJ's, please train your employees better. ESPECIALLY ROGELLIO!!"
Fatima G.,"Inglewood, CA",2,6,3,3.0,3/27/2015,"First time here and not what I expected!  Came for a late dinner with my girls and we were seated quickly which of course was a great.  After my group ordered, the food took forever to get to us and when they finally brought it to us we were disappointed.  The plates looked empty. I honestly don't feel like describing everything but the main dish that disappointed us was the steak that looked like a piece of charcoal in a plate.  It was literally the same size of a charcoal! It gave us a good laugh! They didn't even try to make it look apitizing by adding something around the plate. And I thought soups and salads were usually served before the steak not after.  Anyways the drinks were delicious and we were too busy catching up that we didn't even pay much attention to the food ;p"
Ric S.,"Pasadena, CA",6,22,19,4.0,7/4/2016,I LOVE PIZZA.... BJ's always delivers GREAT FOOD and is consistent state to state !!!.. Beer....not the best...they could use a real craft brewer....so come for the pizza and drink beer elsewhere :)
Marcel E.,"Lawndale, CA",16,4,,1.0,8/29/2016,I am a big fan of BJ s but this one experience was so bad ...the food was not overcooked it was burn server did not help us at all...A manager never came in our rescue and we left the place with a sad face and a empty stomach......worse restaurant experience ever
Shantoya H.,"Inglewood, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/16/2017,"If I could give this restaurant no stars I would. I enjoy coming to Bj's and one person ruined my entire dining experience. Everything started off very positive. Once we were seated our waitress came to the table to take our orders and she was very dry and didn't appear to be very friendly. Still not a problem. Once we were done placing orders the waitress whose name is Toni snatched the menu out of my hand. I still didn't stay anything. Once our appetizers was served Toni brought a new waitress over by the name of Anissa and said she was going on break. She was wonderful and turned the experience around quickly. I watched Toni serve food to other table, but she was supposed to be on a break. I thought it was odd. At some point she did eventually go on a break. Once her break ended she never came back to our table. I watched how interacted with her other tables. She was very friendly with her customers and each time that she passed our table she gave us nasty looks. Once our check came we paid our bill and tipped Anissa. We thanked Anissa for her wonderful service. Before we left the restaurant we decided to speak with the manager to let her know about Toni's behavior. We spoke with Christina and she assured that she would talk to her. We were still finishing dessert when Toni walked past our table and called us B*****s. I had to make sure that I wasn't imagining things. I wasn't because 4 other people saw the same thing including my 11 year old. I said someone better go get the manager because we are about to have a serious issue. Toni walked passed our table again and flipped the bird to us. Again we have our children present who is witnessing this behavior. I completely lost my cool and was about to flip over the entire table because at this point I am livid. Christina the manager walks over to my table and I explain what has happened. I can tell that she was not pleased to hear what her waitress has done. Christina then went to talk to Toni and she stormed out of her job. Christina gave me a courtesy card to come in for another visit in addition to giving me information for the GM of that location. Christina was very professional and I appreciate her hospitality and trying to rectify the issue at hand. I am never the type to mess with anyone's livelihood, but that was just ridiculous. In all my years as a consumer have never felt so disrespected in a place where I am spending my hard earned money. I usually let things go, but I will see this one all the way to the finish line."
Becca R.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",228,31,32,5.0,4/10/2016,I've been to BJ's numerous times but tonight was the best experience. Shoutout to our server Moses - he was amazing! I was with 6 people and he didn't forget one thing and kept our glasses filled all night. We ordered hot wings for the table and I got the hickory smoked BBQ burger ( I think that's what it was - it had red onions mayo brisket BBQ sauce ) and it was really good :) thank you BJ's! Tonight was fun. Absolutely no complaints
Robin R.,"Gardena, CA",9,49,226,3.0,6/18/2014,Well here we go again.... Let me start off by saying the food is always good from here but...... The customer service is bad. I had the same experience the last two times I ate here within a month. We were seated and no server came to our table for at least 15 minutes. He walked past our table twice and didn't say anything. I'm not sure what's going on at this place but if I have to tell a manager on ever visit then I'm better off taking my food to go. May be they need to hire more servers or have there managers help them. On my next bj's visit I mit just try a new location. Just to see if there service is better.
Ashley M.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/9/2016,"My family and I (I'm ten) Went to BJ's a few months ago, and we experienced the worse waiter! When we ordered the food it took like one hour (Probably). He didn't bring it until we called him. He said ""Sorry! I forgot. It happened 3 times when we wanted to order something. And my mom said "" he racist or what?"" So my mom decided to call the manager which was worse. My parents had a conversation with her the manager. Finally she said "" If I knew who he was then I would of helped you "" BITCH HE CALLED YOU IDIOT. I was basically gonna kick her in the ass for doing that. The waitress called you idiot. Not yourself."
