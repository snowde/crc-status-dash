Ross V.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,118,63,4.0,6/2/2015,"I've been to this particular BJs twice and I think the service and food is pretty good in general. This time, I went with a group of 8 co-workers after a night of bowling at Gable House. -Ambiance- In true BJ's fashion, the ambiance is very dim light and a very cool place to hang out -Food- We ordered 3 large pizzas to split. We ordered 2 Pepperoni, and 1 half Buffalo half BBQ. We received 2 Pepperoni and 1 Buffalo. Granted, the Buffalo pizza is pretty awesome and our waiter threw in the BBQ pizza for free for making the error, but it's always a pain not getting what you asked for right. -Service- Since the food situation happened, clearly our waiter was not paying FULL attention Overall, never go wrong with BJ's pizza and/or a pizookie. Enjoy!"
Brian L.,"Gardena, CA",93,102,,2.0,5/1/2016,"Havent been to a bjs since college, it's a pizza joint, I don't remember them having all these crazy items on the menu, anyways, just wanted a normal pizza, they didint' hve it, think pizza on crackers or deep oily dish pizza, how come there is not just good ol normal crust pizza at a pizza place???  that was really annoying to me, just drank my water and walked out."
Timothy H.,"San Jose, CA",1,82,4,1.0,5/1/2016,"BJ's.  The initials say it all.  Bistro Jeopardy.  Bad Joint. ""Bad Joice.""  The food is designed to soak up the alcohol thus enabling higher consumption levels among the patrons.  Bring a large book and wear your sweatpants to keep yourself safe and comfortable at Boring Jack if you are not a drinker.  Brimming Junk.  Baffling Jurisdiction.  The possibilities are BJ-endless.  Come here if you feel like experiencing the sci-fi delight of a world controlled by flat screen tvs and large portions of food."
Tiffany T.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",512,101,449,4.0,4/4/2014,"I'm sure everyone is familiar with BJ's since the first one actually opened  up here in Orange County, California in 1978. Bj's operates several microbreweries which produce and distribute BJ's handcrafted beers throughout the chain. (Which is why you can't find then anywhere else expect at BJ's.) BJ's is also credited with creating the ""Pizookie"", a fresh baked cookie (white chocolate and macadamia nut, chocolate chip and many other flavors), with vanilla ice cream, served in a pizza style pan. The first few times I have tried BJ's two years ago (in Newport Beach) I wasn't impressed at all. The food was so-so and it wasn't anything worth remembering. When I had the opportunity to try the BJ's in Torrance I automatically changed my mind. The food here is actually quite delicious. I can tell that they changed the menu quite drastically from just a simple Chicago style pizza joint to an all-round American bar and good eats restaurant. Which included more than just  pizza. They also have flatbreads, pastas, burgers, salads, and creative new appetizers. My personal favorites are: Calfornia Club Flatbread Really warm and crispy with grilled chicken, Applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, mozzerella cheese, roasted garlic aioli and diced avocados. (Really my FAVORITE dish here!) $9.75 Crispy Fried Artichokes Served with a lemon garlic aioli sauce. (If you like artichokes this is a must!) $4.50   Mini-Bruschetta Grilled focaccia bread topped with melted provolone and a blend of fresh Roma and sun-dried tomatoes, onions, basil and fire-roasted red bell peppers. (The mini bruschetta has a nice crunch in the bite along with the fresh tomatoes and basil finish.) $3.50 Tips: BJ's also has a Premier Rewards program that  earns you 1 point for every $1 you spend at BJ's. 75 points - You get $5 off your meal. 100 points - You get a free Pizookie 150 points - You get $10 off your meal. 350 points - You get $25 off your meal.  Pros: -Closes around 12 midnight! (Great place to grab a late night snack!) -They brew their own beer and they have their own root beer! (Which I think is awesome it actually tastes like root beer and its made fresh.) -The BJ's flatbreads are out of this world! (One of the best I have tried.) -This place is reasonably priced for the quality of food that is given. (The wedge salad here tastes better than the one a Flemings and it about 1/3 of the price.)   Cons: -This place can get quite loud and busy on Friday nights and  weekends. -I ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms and overall the dish was soggy and oily. (The only appetizer that I didn't enjoy at BJ's.) -The menu changes quite frequently so when you come back a week later your favorite dish might not be there anymore. (Piranha Pale Ale Nachos and the Red Velet Pizookie I miss you =( Overall, Love the food! Love the location! (Its right next to the AMC 18 Movie Theather) So come with a group of friends and have a blast!"
Marlon O.,"Inglewood, CA",6,8,3,5.0,7/10/2016,Never been to BJ's before so I decided to try something new and bring my wife here for her birthday with the family. Upon arrival a was very impressed with the establishment. Several TV's through the restaurant all covering different sports. We arrived with a group of 11 and normally have to wait about an hour to a accommodate a group as big as ours but BJ's had us seated within 20min. Then we met our server Jasmine and hands down she was amazing and made our experience that much more memorable. Normally at other restaurants such as Olive Garden we constantly have to keep an eye out for our server. Not the case at BJ's. Even when Jasmine had to go to lunch she introduced us to her coworker Jared. Jared was also great. Food was amazing. The family and I definitely had a great time and would definitely recommend this place.
Yvette Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/7/2017,"Big ups to our waiter Jeremiah.   THIS YOUNG MAN WAS VERY ATTENTIVE, AND POLITE.  Restaurants should hire more people like this young man.  His parents did a wonderful job at raising him..   TEAM JEREMIAH!!!!!!!!!   Will surely be back and will definitely be looking to sit in his section."
Santiago O.,"San Antonio, TX",34,17,3,2.0,7/24/2016,"Took 15 minutes to greet us, no manager presence on the floor. There were at least 3 hosts in the front and other servers walking around in a daze. The only reason it didn't take another 15 minutes to get our order in is because a great server from another section saw us and intervened. The food was good and the price not half bad."
Ryan W.,"Torrance, CA",863,710,2912,4.0,7/13/2012,"The lunch specials really are a great deal! I've been coming to bjs for a while now and here's a rundown of the things that I've ordered previously.  Service: At times can be a little slow, but it depends what time you go. If there's a game on or a weekend night, you can be waiting for a 1-2 hours. **The take-out girl, Tiffany is a cutie patootie :)  Appetizers:      Avocado egg rolls: 4.5 stars. Holy crap these things are amazing! Consists of tons of avocado, cream cheese, onions, cilantro, pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes wrapped in a wanton wrapper and deep fried until golden brown. The thing that makes this appetizer so good is the sauce that they serve alongside. It's packed with flavor and goes so well with the crunch of the wanton wrapper and the soft, creamy texture of the avocado and cream cheese. Definitely try this out!       Calamari: 4 stars. Deep fried calamari that is lightly battered and served with a spicy marinara and a lemon garlic aioli. The calamari itself is very soft and the batter is very light. The sauces go perfectly with the flavor from the calamari. One of the better calamaris that I've had.       Spinach and artichoke dip: 3 stars. Definitely nothing special and I would Not order this again. The blend of cheese, artichokes, and spinach seemed very watery. Compared to other places it was less creamy and seemed to have more of a liquified texture.  Food:      Cajun pasta: 3.5 stars. Fettuccini noodles with blackened chicken, red peppers, red onions in a creamy tomato sauce. I thought the chicken was nicely cooked to keep it moist and flavorful. The creamy tomato sauce packed a punch when it came to flavor and it had a little hint of spiciness to it. I really likes this pasta.       New Orleans jambalaya: 4 stars. I've had jambalaya from many different places and this one is one of the better tasting jambalayas. It consists of shrimps, blackened chicken, chicken-andouille sausage, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes in a spicy sauce. The flavors hit you from so many different angles! This dish is packed with different meats and shrimps. Everything is cooked perfectly and it's all served on a bed of rice pilaf which makes the dish just absolutely delicious!       Shrimp scampi pasta: 2.5 stars. Angel hair pasta tossed in olive oil, garlic, butter, Roma tomatoes and lemon juice. Personally I thought they put in way too much lemon juice that it tasted like they put in lemonade without the sugar. Also the Roma tomatoes kind of masked all of the flavors along with the lemon juice. The thing that I love about the dish is the toast that is served alongside the pasta. Some of the most flavorful, crunchy cheese toasts that I've had. A+ on that!       Grilled mahi mahi tacos: 2.5 stars. Two grilled mahi mahi tacos with chipotle mayo, cabbage, onions and cilantro served with a creamy avocado sauce and a fire-roasted tomato sauce. I was a little disappointed with these tacos. It lacked the flavor that I expected it to have. The mahi mahi had no flavor at all and the little cabbage cole slaw that they put on top needed a pinch more salt and black pepper. The two salsas on the side also didn't pack enough heat the way I expected it to. The other disappointing thing was that the dish was just the two tacos by itself. I understand that this dish was part of the lunch special, but it could at least come with something else. I mean, at Wahoos you can actually get two fish tacos, rice and beans for a cheaper price... Dessert:     Pazookie: 4 stars. Obviously this is the thing that they are most known for. They have a great selection of different cookie flavors to please every pallet. They have chocolate chip, red velvet, white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter, oatmeal raisin walnut, cookies n' cream, or triple chocolate. Personally I like the cookies n' cream, red velvet or the regular chocolate chip the best!"
Barbara G.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,8/9/2016,"I love the food here but if you are planning on ordering take out, don't bother. Order through a delivery service. I ordered lunch online and came to pick it up. There were 6 hostesses and servers hanging out at the front chatting and one person at the pick up station. He couldn't even be bothered to turn around and acknowledge my presence. After almost 10 minutes, a guy from LA Bite who was also here to pick up an order found someone for me. A second person showed up at the pick up station. Clearly she is new because she was the only one actually working. She was working her butt off running back and forth to the kitchen to take care of the orders while the guy on the phone finally hung up and then joined the gaggle of people at the hostess stand. Evidently you only matter of you are dining in."
Sabrina R.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",2,30,6,5.0,12/30/2015,"Pazookie. That's all I gotta say. Oh, and they sell it as take-out.  Salmon and burgers were good--but who cares the pazookie is amazing. Pricey but the service is great."
Melinda H.,"Manhattan, NY",183,25,2,1.0,12/14/2016,"First let me start by saying I like to dine at BJ's because they have good beer and good food. This specific BJ's needs a little help. This is the second time I have dined at this specific location; the first time being an OK experience with long wait times for our food in a low peak hour.  The second time being an awful experience. We had a server who was new, which we were completely understanding. However, we waited about 30 minutes for food at 10 p.m on a wed night. Prior to ordering our food we asked if there was happy hour and were told no. Found out aftermath that that was a lie. After the 30 minute wait, our server told us our food had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes for a to-go order. Our food had to be remade again. Once we got our food, there was hair in it. Two hairs to be precise. Called the manager and the manager comped one of the meals but not the whole dinner. This could have been dealt with differently but we appreciated what we got.  I ordered the fish tacos and she offered to make me another fish taco to go. I accepted and not took an additional 20 minutes. The manager actually came back to our table to ask if that fish taco arrived and we smiled and Shook our heads. She didn't brought it out herself. Long story short, the way that BJ's has been to us the couple times we have been to the specific location we will not be back. The service is terrible. Food was good, just like the hair. I will definitely continue to eat at BJ's just not this one"
F C.,"Compton, CA",43,16,7,5.0,12/28/2015,Mandy you're awesome!  She has great customer service and is attentive without being bothersome to each one of her tables! Great waitress here at Bj's definitely coming back to receive service like the one she provides. Overall pazookies were great As well as my deep dish pizza Satisfied.
Jara Neriza M.,"Ventura, CA",137,194,357,3.0,5/16/2013,"Happy hour!!! No one can beat half off mini pizzas! They are well made and really flavorful. However as a whole, I would rather go to Elephant bar for happy hour.  ~For one, drinks are cheaper there.  ~ 2. I prefer Artichoke and Spinach dip at Elephant's. BJ's sort of has this bacon ad bleu cheese flavor going on which isn't my thing but if it is hey go for it. but its $8ish dollars here at happy hour and it's only $4ish at elephants which is more up my alley ~ 3. I'm a Sangria sorta gal so when I ordered the Peachykeen Sangria, let's just say it wasn't what I was expecting. LOL!"
Jessica G.,"Seattle, WA",510,556,794,4.0,7/30/2012,"You know what? I really hate chain restaurants. But I make an exception for BJ's because the pizza and beer is good, and hello! PIZOOKIES! My ex and I used to come here all the time and split a medium deep dish pizza - half BJ's Favorite and half with meatball, pepperoni, and bacon. Sounds delicious, right? IT IS! I think we were only able to get 2 slices down each (on a good night), and then we'd have to take the rest home. For drinks,  I'd always go with a strawberry lemonade (which, by the way, is like 1928392819 calories of goodness), and he would get a beer. His favorite was Jeremiah Red, but he was often adventurous if they had a seasonal beer. And people, I don't care how much you've ordered, how full you are, you HAVE to get a pizookie. Go in the bathroom and make yourself heave if you have to make room. *laughs*  Oh man...*mouth waters*...seriously so f'ing sick good. It doesn't matter if you go with choco chip, peanut butter, Ghiradhelli choco, Oreo, or Macadamia nut...ALL of it is good. Shoot, try a pizookie trio and get three flavors with various flavors of ice cream on top. It's free on your birthday!  Quick tip: Do a ""call ahead"" when you're on your way. If your name is on the ""call ahead"" list, you get priority seating when you arrive. It has saved me many a night of anxiety and frustration, because the line (especially on the weekends) are just ridiculous. Nothing pisses me off more than when you enter a restaurant like this and are told the wait is like 75 minutes. So do yourself a favor and do this; ESPECIALLY if you are a party of 2. You can thank me later. *oinks down 12398291 pizookies in the background*"
roland b.,"Torrance, CA",2,17,1,1.0,6/21/2016,I ordered lunch to go. Entree Caesar salad but no chicken I called and a manager was to get back to me but no phone call.
Analilia A.,"San Pedro, CA",360,12,1,4.0,7/1/2016,"The food was overall great! Very tasty and not too greasy. Their pazookie is probably one of their most delicious desserts! The waitress on the other hand was not the best ever. She took a very long time with our waters, she barely checked in with us to see if everything was fine or if we needed anything else, she was only eager when she gave us the bill. That's the only time she was smiling and being around our table but her Disneyland theme park voice was not fooling any of us. Then the server gave us our pizza with no plates. They didn't even ask if we wanted any condiments."
Laura C.,"San Pedro, CA",109,16,141,5.0,6/11/2015,"Love BJ's!  They have great Happy Hour deals   Their portions are generous, too!  Fried artichoke hearts, jambalaya, parmesan  crusted chicken, pesto chicken sandwich, chicken tortilla soup, and hand tossed thin crust pizza are a few of my favorites... As far as cocktails go, I love all of their mojitos - and their root beer and creme soda rock! They make it there.  My friends all love their desserts, although i have never had them myself   It can get quite crowded after 530-- like really crowded- for a table   I just usually sit at the bar and eat there.   Also, plenty of televisions all around the bar and restaurant area for watching wherever you are.  Ive honestly never been disappointed with the food or drinks"
Brenda M.,"Gardena, CA",6,99,38,4.0,8/18/2015,Shortly after my review I received a message from the GM Scott M. he was very kind and concerned that I did not have the best experience at BJ's  We were able to speak by phone and he wanted to make up for my last visit by offering me to return and offered me a gift card . I gladly accepted with the intentions on returning and meeting him personally. In my opinion that was EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE . I want to say THANK YOU AGAIN for reaching out  I will continue to up date my review after my visit . I look forward to a nice cold cold BREW ON TAP :)
Michael Q.,"Torrance, CA",206,102,456,3.0,3/6/2016,"I used to be a huge BJ's fan, but now it seems as if I like this place less and less each time I come. This past visit, on a Friday night, was below adequate. The wait was about 45 minutes for 8 people at 6. They had a malfunction with their buzzers, so we ended up waiting about 10 more minutes than we should have. Our service was below average as well. The waiter did not even introduce himself, and he didn't know the prices on some of the items. He was slow with water refills, which left us thirsty for portions of the meal. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip which was just adequate. It lacked any real flavor. My meal was $11.25, while others were on the higher side. It seems as if every time I come here the prices rise. I came here for a birthday, and they didn't even sing happy birthday to my friend on her 18th birthday. We did order a huge pizzookie platter which was delicious. On the other hand, it took us about 10-15 minutes to get our check which was annoying. BJ's better step it up!"
Dor T.,"Lomita, CA",17,46,10,5.0,5/17/2016,"The woman running the togo orders is incredible!!! She is organized, fast while correcting issues! If she isnt a manager she should be!"
