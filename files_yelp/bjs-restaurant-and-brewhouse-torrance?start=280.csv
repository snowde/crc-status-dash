Rick W.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",1,6,4,5.0,7/24/2016,"Loved the BBQ chicken pizza, Cobb salad with balsamic and hanging out with friends on the patio. Good times. The server Stephan was super awesome. Great service!!"
Mike B.,"Torrance, CA",1,6,2,1.0,12/27/2015,"This one star review is very generous. We had a party of 6 adults and 1 toddler. The wait quoted was reasonable, but they went 35 minutes past the estimated time because there was a specific area / table they wanted to seat is at. That's ridiculous. There were other tables free and clear that would have accommodated our group.  Our waitress started us off nice but had to leave for an ""emergency"". We were fine with switching service staff, but the new staff did nothing to make us feel comfortable.  I was never offered another beer nor were any of the water glasses refilled (and that was all a couple of adults ordered to drink).  When it was time to pay, the waiter skipped by us and didn't pick up the bill.  It was 40 minutes before our bill was picked up and processed for signature, that included waiting on a pizookie to-go. I can't believe the manager didn't catch all that was not happening with our group. It was like we were invisible to the service staff.  We definitely didn't feel welcome here and we won't be coming back.   You might expect poor service towards a rowdy group (which doesn't make it acceptable), but we were calm, lo-key, adults and there were only 2 alcoholic drinks on our table. I know serving others can be difficult, but not serving is unacceptable.   A big ""thank you"" should be given to the family sitting in the booth across from us. They shared their ketchup bottle with us because we couldn't get a service member to bring 1 for our table (isn't ketchup standard with burger and fries?)."
Grace C.,"Anaheim, CA",50,843,1158,3.0,8/11/2014,"Came by this past weekend. They have those old-school huge revolving doors.  Love it! Walked in, was greeted by the staff, and promptly seated.  Ordered our drinks, ordered our appetizers, got our drinks, ordered our entrees, got our mozzarella sticks.  Munched on our mozzarella sticks, got our entrees (Santa Fe salad for me, and the ham/bacon/turkey sandwich for the bf). Bf had also ordered me a strawberry pina colada mixture of some sort.  Not bad at all.  I had to mix it up, otherwise there were a few sips that were quite sweet. Food-wise, definitely enjoyed the mozzarella sticks.  Crunchy, good amount of cheese, and marinara sauce was good.  Fresh parmesan on top didn't cause an issue, either :)   Bf absolutely LOVED his ham/bacon/turkey sandwich.  He said it had the perfect balance of crisp/crunch of the grilled panini-style bread, and that the turkey/ham/bacon combination meshed well with the cheese and the overall flavor.  I think he said it was the best turkey sandwich he ever had... @_@;; For me, the Santa Fe salad was good.  Fresh ingredients and good size.  Was hoping for more spice, but the chicken with cayenne pepper wasn't bad at all. The service was very polite, but there were times when it felt like it was a little slow. Felt like a standard BJ's, but the doors are awesome! Only thing I don't like are the bathrooms.  For whatever reason, they decided to have some sort of bright spotlight overhead in each of the stalls.  So, this means that I can clearly see my shadow in whatever I'm doing in the bathroom and, because the divisions between the stalls aren't too low, my next door neighbor can get a general idea of what I'm doing, and I can guess what they're doing.  It's like something out of  the musical Chicago, where they're waiting for a song and dance.  Creepy."
Jasmine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,6,,1.0,11/25/2015,Got there and had to wait for over 40 minutes to get seated party of 8  Wednesday night
Doug W.,"Torrance, CA",46,369,45,3.0,4/27/2014,We were in the vicinity of this place and since it was early (11:30am) went for it. Patti had the Avocado Egg Rolls which was just ok and I had the BJ's Brewhouse Burger which was good but didn't have any of the grilled onion as stated on the menu. However the burger was cooked to medium as I like it and the parmigian bun was toasted to perfection with lettuce and tomato ( 1 dinky slice). The Brewhouse Blonde was cool and refreshing and our waitress was cute and attentive. We will venture back.
Joshua C.,"San Pedro, CA",11,23,8,5.0,3/14/2015,Me and my sister usually come here after work or on a day off and it's AWESOME!  We get the Chicken Tortilla soup with the Original Pizookie afterwards. Service is good most of the time. All the servers are friendly and respectful too. Especially Joe every time we had him as our server he treats us as if we are his only table. Thanks for the great service Joe!
Marisa A.,"San Pedro, CA",59,139,301,5.0,8/1/2015,Went here for lunch with a friend. We sat in the bar area Hannah was our server she was awesome!!! I will go back & sit in her section
Abby J.,"Carson City, NV",0,8,,1.0,10/5/2016,"Wouldn't go back here again. They have horrible service. ALL THE TIME. I've been to other bj's where their food is actually hot and service is good . But here my food is always cold and I never have walked out of here in less than 2 hours. Last time I went for a pizookie and there was a piece of straw in my pizookie. After telling the manager, he did nothing but apologized. It's pathetic. They need to do something about this place."
Vanessa A.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,7,1,1.0,4/1/2016,Bad Bad Service!! I Wont Be Coming Back Again To This Place..  The Waitress Was Rude It Took Over 35 Minutes To Bring My Food All Bad
Candace Y.,"Torrance, CA",18,21,36,4.0,3/22/2015,"Always love this place for dinner! Whether it's for pizza with friends, quick bite to eat with mom, or date night with my boyfriend. There is so much on the menu that no matter what I can find something I want.  They have their own brews, but I always get the house sodas. My favorite is the Orange Twist! It's so good!  I usually start with the caprese salad. Sometime I order the tomato soup for my entree, sometimes I'll splurge and get the rib eye. Seriously everything is good here!  I work at the mall so sometimes I like to come here on my lunch break. Sometimes I just get a baked potato, sometimes I get the caprese salad. The only thing is my total always comes out different for some reason. It depends on who rings you up I guess?  No matter how much I love the food, the thing that can't be ignored is the service. I've had some really funny people, chill people, plain/boring people, but no matter what they're like they all have the same thing in common: bad service. It seems it always takes forever to get to you. And after they do you don't see them for another 20 minutes. I've waited a full hour and a half for my food. I don't what it is. I have never had speedy service here before.  BUT, I love this place and I'll never stop coming back!"
Trisha T.,"Torrance, CA",7,22,7,5.0,9/13/2015,"If I could give 10 stars I would.  I love bjs for many reasons  (That sound super inappropriate sorry) one being that I had my very first date with the love of my life here big sigh! But now I have a new great experience I would like to share with everyone.  Joe puts the J in BJs. He had phenomenal customer service.  Best I have ever had hands down.  Funny,  prompt,  considerate,  aware and by far exceeded my every expectations of him as a server.  Thanks joe!  I will be ranting and raving about you to all my followers. Great job in finding him.  Now you have to keep him or I might recruit him!"
PV D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,20,,4.0,9/28/2015,"Lots of negative reviews but we just ate here for 2 different birthdays and no complaints.  I had the BJ Burger both times and really liked the wedge fries.  Daughter found healthy options that she really liked. The free birthday dessert is a great touch.  A lot of people don't like chains and we're not even drinkers.  But I still like BJ's and don't have any issues with the Costco style size of the place.  Great variety and attentive staff. Biggest challenge is just the parking and getting there.  The mobile App is awesome and makes the overall reservation process much more manageable.  Still had to wait, but not that bad."
Kathy A.,"Carson, CA",0,115,,2.0,12/29/2016,"I went to BJ's first in Belmont Shore in L.B. once after clinicals and didn't enjoy it much there because I was too tired to eat but those classmates of mine were twisting my arm to go even though I wanted to go home. The food didn't taste so good to me there. So I said to myself, maybe I'll go to my local one here at Del Amo mall and maybe the food will taste better when I'm well rested and relaxed and in a happy mood. So I went with my parents and other family members that Xmas and the food was the same--average and especially over-priced. I ordered a large pizza with 3 toppings and it was almost $34 dollars!!!! And it wasn't even good, it was like those horrible pan pizzas you get at Pizza Hut. It didn't even look like a large, it looked like a medium. I can get a better pizza and large too with 3 toppings at Domino's for $8 only and only 2 bucks for extra toppings. At this horrible restaurant, only cheese is free and anything above it is almost $5 for extra toppings. And the portions of the food here and at any BJ's are horribly small and you pay so much money for little portions. I hate the loudness at the bar too and people getting drunk and loud all over the place. Never come here or to any other BJ's ever again."
Mary Jane C.,"Torrance, CA",414,444,268,3.0,6/24/2014,"So we returned this year for an early birthday party for my boyfriend.. this was a little messier than usual.  I had made the reservation a few days earlier, the earliest they could seat a table of 14 was at 8:00pm--so we took a late dinner reservation.  About 7:30pm we found out our group would be 20 people.. I called and asked if it would be possible to accommodate the add-ons.  I spoke with the manager, Eric, who said yes.  They were seating us in the open seating area and would put the table of 6 nearby (which was fine with me).   Upon arrival, my sister had checked us in already.. so we waited outside.  Wasn't much of a wait that by 8:15pm we were seated in a side room.. which was fine, I was told the table next to it had been there for 1:15 hour and it was up to us to wait.  They made it sound like they were leaving soon..  At this point maybe 15 of our party had arrived, but by 8:30pm everyone was there, standing room for the latecomers.  AND the table of 6 hadn't even gotten their dinner yet--in fact they didn't get it until 8:30pm, we saw them get served.. what the heck?!  I know they'd been there for over an hour, but that was a big failure to tell us that they hadn't even been served their food yet. Eventually the OTHER side room with a group cleared out and we were moved, this was probably 9:15pm.  This was a very very very very long dinner.  Cory, who ended up being our final waiter in that room that night, and he was a gem.  Very patient with us, checked up on us, kept our cups filled.   The pizza.. I don't know who cut it.  We would have slices anywhere from 1"" wide to 4"" wide, and some were stubby.. terrible job with the slicing.  Some of the pizzas had portions that had no filling towards the edge, and were just great puffs of bread.  And the deep dish, albeit deep--was either not cooked enough or just came out floppy.  We would lift a slice and it would literally fall apart just trying to get on the spatula.  I do not know what was going on the kitchen that night.  No one complained, everyone was starving, but still. We didn't end up out of the place til almost 11pm.  We ordered 11 mini pizookies at 10:15pm and it took 30 minutes to get to us.. it was so.. long.. our friends joked if they were making the cookie dough from scratch. I like you BJs, but this was messy.  If you couldn't accommodate the changes, we would have moved the group of 6 elsewhere, just be honest.  Your server was great, your food was mediocre at best that night, and the kitchen was slow.  Ay yi yi."
Eddie S.,"Carson, CA",2,10,9,3.0,4/28/2015,"I went with my family for a birthday, and I have a mediterranean chicken pita tacos, did not like it at all,  The taste it so plain, pita bread seems under cook. It sticks in my teeth and taste the flour in my mouth and salsa barely in it. how can you have tacos with out salsa."
Noah M.,"El Segundo, CA",72,9,8,1.0,9/30/2015,"Let me begin by saying typically B.J. at other locations has been a go-to spot for good pizza and a nice cold drink. The wife and I stop in for my birthday lunch and it's dead inside, we sit at the bar area and don't get any attention until we ask for help.  We order drinks and cheese sticks. Drinks come fast and are amazing, sadly the cheese sticks were out almost the same time it took to make the drinks, and were cold. It took another 5 minutes of trying to get someone's attention to get the plate replaced with the same food just reheated.  We are halfway through our drinks and are trying to get someone's attention (again) for some water or a coke, the whole time our server flops our food on the table or seems disinterested in our visit it's off putting. Not to mention we had to ask for pepper and cheese, which honestly is a staple in any pizza.  What happened at this location that's different than others I don't know. I do know we will not be returning."
Dan W.,"Los Angeles, CA",75,93,5,5.0,8/17/2015,I think 4 stars is more appropriate but everyone is giving them 3 stars and leaving good reviews so: wrong officially righted. Good beer and prices.  They have an IPA they brewed with Stone that was like 8% but was mild like a session.  Guac burger was great and the pizookie was pretty kick-ass.
Subin S.,"Gardena, CA",1,140,11,3.0,9/18/2015,"My second time here for lunch on Friday around noon. Ordered BJ Hefeweizen (on special for $3.50), which was just ok. I'd suggest that they garnish it with a slice of orange or lemon. I've tried the BJ ale last time and it wasn't all that great either comparing products from other local breweries. Both times we were greeted by the host with warmth and the servers were attentive. The last visit we had Josh and I happened to received a wet menu and he quickly apologized and got me another one.  He was also helpful helping us ordering and checking back often to make sure things are ok. We got the Ahi salad and the medium BJ deep dish pizza, which has a little bit of every toppings they offer. For about $15, the salad was refreshing with fresh pretty green herb/vegi leaves. The dressing was oil and light and I was able to taste the fish, pine nuts and the herb/vegi.  The medium size pizza was also good, but I just think that it is not $20 good.  Well come back again if someone else is paying for the tab ;-)"
Donald D.,"Torrance, CA",4,12,,2.0,11/21/2015,"The BJ's at del Amo has really gone down. We used to really love it and went there just about every Friday night. I loved the ribeye and my wife the New York steak. We hadn't been there in several months, and went back today. I was so disappointed that I'm not even home yet and writing this on my cell phone. The dinner salad, tomato amd mozzarella, was actually half of the salad plate, with an intricate design occupying the other half. It was delicious, but it was about three bites. The New York steak was, without exaggeration, smaller than a dollar bill and clearly had been cut down by the chef. It was also a cheap cut, very very dry with a gritty consistency. The ribeye was dry too, even though I asked for it medium. The naan bread was like those refrigerator biscuits you pop open with a knife handle. Service was slow, and we had to remind them about several things we'd asked for, bread included. The check was only $43 dollars, which is cheaper than I expected and remember (I was expecting around $60), but the meal was not worth even that. I don't know what happened, but you shouldn't leave BJ's thinking that it would have been better to just have gotten Chipotle."
Ingrid L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1021,454,858,2.0,2/6/2012,Went with a group of about 10 OT girls after a fieldtrip. We had an hour and a half and thought that we would have more than enough time to get to school afterwards. Boy were we wrong. We didn't get our food until an hour and 15 minutes into the lunch.  They got our bill wrong the first time around and we had to wait 10+ minutes to get it back even when we told them we were in a rush.  I get that we were a pretty big group but they just took way too long.  My flatbread pizza and salad was yummy thought and everyone else seemed very satisfied with their food even if we only had 10 minutes to eat it.
