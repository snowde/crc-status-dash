Tori S.,"Carson, CA",140,13,3,2.0,6/15/2016,"There's always a problem when I come here . The service is so slooooooow tonight . I just waited well over an hour for my food to arrive . It was only pasta. Maybe they had to go catch the shrimp in the ocean, and that was the reason for the wait ! I'm terribly disappointed. I love BJ's, but I won't return to this location. The one in Cerritos, is the best one by far, but a little out the way. I will take the extra trip by any means just to avoid this location."
Asia D.,"Gardena, CA",0,13,4,5.0,5/28/2016,I LOVED THE STEAK!!!!!   The steak was cooked to perfection and the waitress Tiffany was super sweet and nice! I didn't have to wait to long to be seated and I appreciated her efforts in making sure that my boyfriend and I were happy and doing well. We also had the root beer ribs and they were AMAZING!!! If you haven't had them try them! This was the best way to end my fist week of having three jobs. Thanks BJ's.
DP G.,"Torrance, CA",0,30,25,1.0,1/15/2016,I think BJs is going down hill. Their management seems to promote bad customer service. Not a problem because there are an unlimited number of real bars to go to now. No need to go to corporate garbage like BJs.
Luanne S.,"Hawthorne, CA",552,183,1896,2.0,2/13/2014,"Bjs! Being a chain restaurant, Bjs is okay. I have been to several different locations and they were all pretty much the same. There's long waits to be seated, the decor is dark and somewhat modern, not bad. The menu is huge! So many different options to choose from which sometimes is good and sometimes bad. Everything that I've had here though was just okay. The burgers are hit and miss with the flavors, the sandwiches are average, the pastas lack flavor, the salads are average, the appetizer platter is okay, the pizza is okay, the soups are mediocre, nothing spectacular but nothing disgusting either. Overall, I usually only come here for group occasions, which they don't really do a good job handling big groups by the way. Probably the only reason id be here by choice is for the pizookie, that's about it. Happy eats, loves! ^_^"
Ana-Julia F.,"Whittier, CA",404,34,7,1.0,1/30/2016,"I haven't even sat down yet and hate my experience here. Rude ass ""hostess"", not attentive at all, too busy talking to the other ""hostesses"" at the area. Your job is not hard, you must dress for your job and have a good attitude. I wish these people had name tags."
Jenessy ..,"Los Angeles, CA",3,79,136,2.0,3/10/2015,"BJs is a corporation so regardless what I write, people will come here to this location. Have to agree w/ most people yelping for this place... It's not really clean. I had to ask twice for new silverware because it's filthy dirty. Looks like it was used and wrapped up in the towel for the next customer  luckily I had a extra pair of chopsticks in my bag from a togo the other day because waiting for my server took forever. Hannah the server is sweet. I tipped more then 20 % because i understand customer service and being a food server sucks!"
Justin L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",252,41,353,4.0,6/3/2015,"Over this past year, I've been coming to BJ's quite frequently. I'd have to say maybe around 10 times within the past few 3 months?  FOOD / DRINKS The food is pretty good. It isn't super oily compared to other American restaurants and I like how there is variety. Also, I think there is a healthier menu? For my entree, I usually get the Parmesan Crusted Chicken or the House Top Sirloin. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken comes with two big pieces of chicken and two chosen sides. Because I don't like the sides, I always ask if I can substitute them and they have no problem doing so. The chicken is really tender and not dry at all although sometimes it does come a little burnt. For the House Top Sirloin, it comes with the steak and two sides of your choice. Personally, it is way too fatty and oily for me, but I still love how it tastes. Both come is great portions and you will be extremely full.  I think the Cream Soda / Orange Cream Soda or Root Bear is a must try. It is actually really good and I almost never drink soda. It's not too sweet and it is definitely worth it. When I'm not feeling that, I get the Fresh-squeezed Strawberry Lemonade. This drink is really sweet but nonetheless, it tastes delicious. SERVICE The wait here can get pretty long because it is at Del Amo Fashion Center and it's usually busy all the time. Typically, you'll have to wait around 30-40 minutes dinner time. I would get there early if I were you. But the place really is a hit or miss. I've had times where my food was brought out so quick, I barely finished my appetizer. And other times where I waited for a good 15-20 minutes before it came. It really just depends on the waiter you get I guess. The Cream Sodas/Orange Cream Sodas/Root Beer comes from the bar so it takes awhile for it to come. If you want a refill, grab the waiter halfway through your glass. PARKING The horror. Parking here is almost impossible on the weekends and even dinner time weekdays. I hate coming to this location because I know I'm going to have to circle the parking lot a million years before finding a spot. I know I could park at the structure near Buffalo Wild Wings, but the walk will be so far and I wouldn't say I'm lazy but it's just too far. The spots here are also really small so if you drive a big car, you might have a hard time. Overall I'd have to say I'm a fan. I think their food is pretty good and it's of good value. Definitely a place I would keep coming back to because I enjoy enjoy the ambiance as well as the food."
Kat M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",673,731,348,3.0,11/29/2013,The restaurant looks nice.  The vibe is good.  The seats are comfy.  They have a great beer selection if that is your thing.  The service is consistently poor.  It's never an amazing experience.  I much prefer Cheesecake Factory for this kind of fare.  Pros: The cookie desserts are delicious.  The chocolate with chocolate ice cream is my favorite.  My least favorite is the red velvet.  Oreo cookie is solid.  PB is good.  Chocolate chip is classic. The salads are tasty.  The chicken entrees are good enough.  The french fries are good. Cons: We never got our drinks refilled even though I told the waiter.  I was thirsty for an hour before I practically yelled at our waiter to refill my drink.   I have NEVER had good service here.  Not one time! The pizza is NOT deep dish.  I am originally from Chicago.  Deep dish is NOT bready.  This is the opposite of deep dish.  This is Sicilian style.  I would absolutely skip this poor excuse for deep dish.
Akisha B.,"Norwalk, CA",707,302,745,4.0,4/26/2014,"Whoo hoo! Came here on Friday during lunch hours and didn't have to wait. I'm not used to being seated immediately, because when I go to the Cerritos location, I don't care what time I go there seems to always be a wait. There wasn't much of a variety on the lunch menu. Well at least for me since I'm a vegetarian. So I ended up ordering the Flatbread pizza and salad. And of course you know I ordered a pizooki for dessert!  I didn't have any problem receiving my food in a timely manner. Our waiter was attentive to our needs. So no complaints here."
Lily M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",9,127,112,4.0,5/23/2014,"The food is delicious with a great variety of all different types of food (healthy and not so healthy options).  The mozzarella sticks were yummy and a good appetizer for 2 of us.  I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi with only 425 calories. It was full of flavor, a good portion size and bursting with flavor. I gave it 4 stars because the parking can be difficult since it's in a mall.  The waiter ((Brandon) we had was totally efficient and checked in with us frequently, and never left empty plates on our table for more than 3 minutes. Very impressed with his friendly, efficient service."
Ken B.,"Bellflower, CA",131,171,683,1.0,10/5/2013,"Worst service ever we waited at our table for our food for 45 min. I cannot believe how we could have been overlooked. Freaking ridiculous, they even got one of our orders was incorrect.  After telling the waitress to check on our meal and to bring the manager to our table. The waitress came back and said she was going on break and we would have a new server.  We asked for the manager to come to our table again so that we could voice our displeasure. He did not show up until 10-15 min after iur meals came to our table. Needless to say iur plates looked thrown together (see picture). The manager didn't seem concerned that we waited that long at our table for our meal. He just asked if the food was good.  He offered up some lame apology though.  Later just after the check came the waiter said they were going to bring over some ice cream for my mom for her birthday. Well after a 10 min we stopped the waiter and asked when the ice cream was coming to our table. He told us 6 or 10 more minutes.  This was suppose to be a birthday celebration for my mother. What a terrible experience. Mark my word I will never bring my family this restaurant nor will I recommend them."
Tim C.,"San Pedro, CA",10,27,13,1.0,11/11/2015,"Never had great service here. Usually long wait for service. Many times we've had to speak to the manager regarding either service, dirty utensils or subpar food. If there was a closer BJ's I'd easily choose that location. Such a shame."
A A.,"Lomita, CA",81,21,8,1.0,11/2/2016,"Would have given 0 stars if it was possible. This restaurant has declined so badly. First had a 5-10 minute wait. Not bad as other times I have waited here 30-125+ minutes. Got seated in a decent spot. Took about 5-10 minutes to take the order. Waitress came and took order; 5 minutes later she came and introduced us to her replacement saying she was going on break at 1830. Funny thing was, I kept seeing her over the next 30 minutes on the floor. They dropped off appetizer and never came back to check if I needed anything. They never checked on our drinks. Eating the egg rolls were spicy and was hard to enjoy without a refreshment. Dinner dish arrived and it was like warm. service in the past has been good. Tonight sucked and had to talk to the manager. Not sure if I will recommend or come back again."
Christopher O.,"Carson, CA",48,50,16,5.0,11/8/2013,"This BJ's has excellent service, also clean and tidy, and servers are always on their toes.  Happy hour is always good, half off most appetizer mon-fri 3-7pm.  Spinach artichoke dip, sante fe spring rolls, and mini deep dish pizza for $17. Enough to feed 2 ppl! Amazing!"
B S.,"Inglewood, CA",4,19,17,2.0,7/19/2015,"Not a great experience.  My party got skipped, then we were told we were next to be seated after 3 parties were seated before us. We were walked to our table, only to be walked back to the waiting area because the table hadn't been cleaned. Recommendation; go to a different one or take your changes being hungry longer than you anticipated. The food wasn't even tasty, but the booth was decent. We had enough room. The order was chicken fettuccine and salmon. Both meals had no flavor, not cooked well (pasta over cooked and clumpy and the salmon overlooked and extremely dry)"
Cesar L.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,3.0,4/28/2017,"We like BJ's normally. But last night, 4/27/17, we went there late to have the prime rib special. The waiter came a few minutes after we were seated and asked if we wanted something to drink. We said yes, my wife ordered Diet Coke and I ordered flavored ice tea. My wife then said the waiter, ""we're here for the prime rib special"". Is it still available? His reply was "" I'm not sure, I'll go ask"". He then left. After about 10mins, he returned but not to inform us about the availability, but to get the order from the table next to us. I assumed he would tell us after he took their order but that didn't happen. He just went back. Wow, no drink and no update. After another 10min, he returned and asked us if we had decided on what we wanted for drinks? REALLY? You took 20mins to forget our drinks and NOT to let us know if the prime rib is still available?!!! To make a long story longer, he must have been new or something because he forgot everything we ordered and had to keep coming back to ask us what we wanted because he didn't get one thing we ordered right. The topper was for desert we ordered the mini pizzookie  since we accumulated enough points for a free one. He said great and took off. 10 mins later he came back and asked,"" Do you guys leave enough room for some desert?"" Are you kidding me???? You totally forgot we ordered a mini pizzookie? Oh yea. Frustrating evening. Will be going elsewhere to eat where they remember your order, or at least write or type it on something!!!!"
Luke M.,"San Pedro, CA",31,95,162,2.0,11/13/2015,"The location of this Bj's is located near the Del Amo Mall AMC theatre. And other Restaurants. Weekends get very busy so come early and wait. The wait time on a Friday night at 5 pm was about 10 minutes . The food was good not the best , service was not all that good , they can do a lot better dont act as if your doing me a favor and then expext a big tip . It's not going to happen. Good service , good tip and it doesn't matter what the suggested tip says . Tipping is in no way shape or form a LAW."
Erika G.,"Bellflower, CA",0,20,2,3.0,7/13/2015,"I ordered the mac n cheese without bacon for my apetitzer and was very disappointed. I couldn't get past the burnt flavored and had to send it back (could have been from the bread crumbs).  For my meal, I ordered my usual- a California Burger with a veggie patty and wedge cut fries. The food was great until I noticed that one of my fries was shaped like a ball. It was a random mini corndog that was mixed in somehow. Yes, mistakes happen, but as a vegetarian of 8+ years, this mistake could have caused me to get ill. Please be careful of accidentally mixing ingredients. Our waitress was very nice and apologized for the mixup even though it wasn't her fault."
Britnee S.,"Lomita, CA",40,26,12,4.0,1/24/2015,The 4 stars is purely for the Berry Cidar and the waitress we had. She was awesome! Came with 65$ in gift cards.. So glad because the new frito appetizer was gross and sad looking and the pizza was super dry.
Denise M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,52,10,2.0,1/10/2016,"I don't recommend coming here on a weekend. Last night my boyfriend and I got here around 4:40, got seated around 5:00 (wait wasn't too bad.) took our waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table, waited about 30 for our food and appetizer which ended up coming at the same time. ""Starters"" are starters for a reason, they should come before the food. I asked for ranch and ketchup and it never came, I had to ask the supervisor who was very helpful and sweet. I still dared to order a pazookie which took another 20 minutes to come to us lol. At least the food was good. Don't order their new spicy Hawaiian chicken pizza if you don't like SUPER spicy food lol.. It was more spicy than I expected it to be, but it was good and very filling. Their spinach and artichoke dip was OK."
