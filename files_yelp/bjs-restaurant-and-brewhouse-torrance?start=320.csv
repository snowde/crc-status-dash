Jessica R.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/16/2015,"I go to this BJ's pretty frequently, because of their food def not the service. I've never had a GREAT experience there, I swear almost every time my boyfriend and I go it seems as if we have an invisible cloak over us because it takes AT LEAST 15 mins from the time we get seated for someone to even acknowledge us being there.  This past time was the worst, my boyfriend made a reservation for 12 for my birthday dinner on a Friday night at 7, there was no problem making the reservation. We arrived at 6:30 and he let them know we were there... we got called up at 7:15 and before we got seated someone who looked, but didn't act at all like a manager informed us that we had a 2 hour time limit from the time of our reservation....wait what? first of all....why were we not told about a time limit when we made the reservation? second of all.. from the time of our reservation? which was 7 and we were there but you didn't even call us up until 7:15...but you're timing us from 7? that's insane. Fast forward to dinner.... it took FOREVER for everything...for drinks...for apps...for food. I mean, I get waiting a little bit, obviously.. I mean its a Friday night, totally understandable... but 15 mins for a drink and an extra 5 mins for one that was ordered at the same time is kinda ridiculous ESPECIALLY when you put a time limit on how long we can be there. I have a friend who is vegetarian and had a whole conversation with our waitress about how she doesn't eat meat and asked for the jambalaya with no chicken and no sausage. her food came 15-20 mins later, complete with sausage and chicken....okay.. let our waitress know (who was very nice about it)... and waited another 15 mins for a new one to come out. Another friend ordered a mojito...got a margarita instead (she doesn't drink tequila). then... to top it all off...I got MY drink with a nice black bug in it. awesome. nothing was comped.. only got apologies from our waitress...no manager ever came out.  oh, and you better believe right at our two hour mark when we were trying to figure out there bill because for parties over 6 or something they wont split the bill AT ALL...a manager and a few busboys were at our table ready to tell us it was time for us to go... all of this after we racked up a bill of close to $400...you'd think they'd wanna keep our business...right? thanks for the great birthday dinner BJs..."
Rodney A.,"Outer Richmond, San Francisco, CA",13,14,11,1.0,1/18/2016,Longesssst wait to sit. Not even a busy night. Sat for 15 minutes to get drink order. Waitress nonchalantly comes. We order. Takes us 45 minutes to get our food. Seriously was gonna leave before food came. I hate coming to this location. Will not come back.
Frankie P.,"Carson, CA",4,9,3,1.0,10/1/2016,"I hate giving bad reviews but overall, my experience here was by far the worse ever! I'm real disappointed with BJ's with the lack of level of service. I took my wife out for dinner and we were excited. We looked forward to eating at BJ's. when we got here, we were greeted and seated very quick. We waited about 5 minutes for someone to take our order. After they took our order (mind you, they didn't put it on their note pad like they're suppose to) another waiter shows up and asks us what our order was again.... are you kidding me?! And not only that but we were seeing people get seated around us and they were getting their drinks and appetizers quicker than we got ours. 20+ minutes into waiting, we finally got our appetizer and then our food.... it defeats the purpose of an appetizer if we're getting our food at the same time.... they offered to refill my wife's drink. He took the cup and never came back until he asked us ""how's the food? Is there anything you guys need?"" Like I said, this was bad service overall. I was borderline about to just walk out before they bought our food. I really hope they fix the lack of customer service here. I left very disappointed and real pissed off with the thought of never coming back."
Mark J.,"Torrance, CA",462,12,3,1.0,9/22/2015,"Wish I could rate a -5 stars!  Embarrassed for our waiter! My wife has tomorrow off from teaching. Thought it would be great to hit up something casual, quick and a bit on the ""chain"" side of dining in the South Bay. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought this to happen. Now we're not one to loose patience too easily, thankfully. We are also very much at ease with mistakes and some levels of just bad business. But, when management just doesn't care and has that attitude of ""well, it is what it is. Can't help you"", especially when you're more than kind and patient! I gotta warn my friends!  So, I ordered one of the BJ Stouts, my wife ordered a nice glass of Le Creme wine. My Stout shows up in a nice tall beer glass. The wine? In a nice short wine carafe but with a wide mouthed flute styled beer glass! WHAT? So, we ask our more than helpful and clearly frustrated water, ""are you out of wine glasses?"" He responds, ""yeah, don't know why but we only have a few today"". Everyone is ordering wine and we don't have wine glasses. Ok, well clearly something was up and it suddenly turned into a ""principle"" matter. So, being my wife's husband, I chose not to drink my beer and wait till a wine glass showed up. Clearly our waiter was frustrated as we weren't the only ones in this position. I stepped up to the bar and asked the bar back if they had any to help out our waiter, she too said nope don't have any. REALLY? Are we acting spoiled or are we amazed that a chain establishment doesn't have enough wine glasses? Really? Pretty amazed to say the least! The manager must of walked by 10 times, Looked right at us and our drinks could clearly see we weren't happy and didn't even ask or say a word. Well, we made the effort and spoke MR. ERIC FLORES the manager about this wine glass issue. HIs demeanor? Couldn't care less and knew that if we left unhappy, someone else would sit where we were. He basically said, ""yeah, don't know what happened or why we don't have any wine glasses. Oh well, maybe they broke or something last night"". Couldn't give a damn about the customers! I sat there and just stared at him and didn't say a word. He then walked away. No, apology. Or, ""Oh, we'll take your beer and wine off the tab. No, let me see what I can do"". Nothing.  Maybe it's a bit  petty cause they did have a beer glass at least?  However, if there was even a thread of courtesy to us as the ""CUSTOMER""... we would have been ok. I think my wife would have had the wine in the tall flute style beer glass. However, the attitude that manager threw mixed with his I don't care about you demeanor was out of control! Food was par, our waiter was clearly overwhelmed. Hate to say this, ""we will not be returning to this BJ's"". Oh, after the brussels and pizza and moments before the check arrived... a wine glass showed up and they actually did take the $3.47 off the bill for the glass of wine. Thankful for that but not the harsh treatment and attitude."
Randy D.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",26,2,1,1.0,10/11/2016,"This place has turned into a joke.  My wife and I have been coming here for years and have noticed a significant downgrade in service and food.  The servers are slow and forgetful, the food was cold and/or under cooked and the workers are just flat out rude. We asked for a manager 4 times before actually getting him and explained how our kids ate under cooked chicken and that a server flat out refused to give us a bag to take home the leftover trash we ordered.  The workers response was that he was ""joking"" but there's a time and place for everything and that doesn't excuse him.  Further more he kept insisting it was just a joke like we were old buddies having a spat.  The manager seemed completely oblivious to everything and offered up an apology but did not stick around long enough to hear him finish.  Couldn't have left fast enough and rest assured will not be returning to that venue or any other venue that bears the BJ's logo.  You've lost honest patrons of your mediocre establishment forever."
Kelly W.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,642,695,4.0,9/13/2011,I've been here several more times and they have gotten a little better with the service.  The food is consistently great and the prices are fair.  I came here on a double date and it took about 30 minutes to get seated and it was around 8:00pm on a Wednesday night...so yeah this place gets busy. We ordered the Avocado egg rolls and the stuffed mushroom caps...both excellent.  My date and I split the jambalaya and it was pretty food. My friends got the pork chops and a flat bread and they were really happy with their food too. This is a pretty solid place for good food if you don't mind the wait.
Johnny M.,"Bellflower, CA",5,6,,5.0,3/26/2016,"The food was great as usual...been coming here for quite a while and i can honestly say our waiter joe was the absolute best waiter ive ever encountered in the FOH! Super friendly,courteous,professional and an amazing employee over all! Being in the industry myself for the last decade ive never encountered a FOH employee with his drive and professionalism! I want to come here more due to this terrific experience! Thank you joe!"
Nancy F.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,79,,5.0,9/27/2014,"This review is for the amazing customer service we got from our server Joe. I've been to this restaurant too many times to the count, and the food is always pretty good. But tonight we were lucky enough to come across a server who was so kind, so caring and attentive that I had to write a review just on him (which I've never done before). Joe approached us like we were the important people in the room, treating us with the utmost kindness and respect. It threw us off immediately, usually servers here are just okay. Joe was so sweet and different, he genuinely cared about us and even went out of his way to get us the best deals possible. Such a stand up employee and person. On top of his wonderful attitude, he was prompt, on top of things even though his section was full and he doted on us without missing a beat. BJ's, I hope you are treating your server right, because you are lucky to have someone who is such a needle in a haystack. In all my years of visiting restaurants, I've never come across anyone like Joe. I sincerely recommend you give him a token of appreciation because this guy goes way above and beyond what a server needs to or gets PAID to. Customers, if you visit this BJ's restaurant and you get to sit in Joe's section, you'll be damn lucky...and very satisfied.  NICE WORK JOE!!!"
Andrea C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,10,,3.0,7/7/2015,"This is one of my go to places to go with friends. I love the drink options and the food is pretty good. I especially love the mimosa deal with brunch on weekends! My only gripes are that some of the items are very overpriced and the service can be really hit or miss. Items forgotten, etc. For example, I went twice in one week last month. On Monday, I got amazing service from a lovely waitress (unfortunately, I've forgotten her name). On Wednesday, I got the strangest service and behavior I've ever seen from a waiter. I won't put his name because maybe it was his first week and he didn't realize what he was doing was wrong. Let's just say he spoke to my friend and I both like he was flirting and like we were three years old. You'd think the martinis would let him know this isn't acceptable? If you're reading this, sir, please never say ""Are we ready for din din?!"" to two obviously over 21 people. You were nice, you brought everything promptly, but we felt really uncomfortable.  Overall, I'm a fan of BJs. I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls and calamari!"
MARGIE I.,"Torrance, CA",911,699,1212,2.0,9/24/2013,"Whenever I come here, there's nothing really memorable. It isn't my go to spot for anything. Service was cool, but I'm not particularly a fan of their food."
J B.,"Kauai County, HI",12,523,13,3.0,1/17/2016,I believe this place is underrated. It is a great place to take kids due to the noise level and the variety of food especially for picky kids. Mom and Dad can have cocktails and nibble on the bar scene even with crying tots. The food met my expectations since I didn't see this place as a gourmet restaurant. The service was great and courteous. Beer flights were tasty but not crazy good. Average food for an expected average place. I will be back. Oh the buffalo burger was made perfect! Tough to do for an average place. :) great job
Ruben S.,"Torrance, CA",55,63,13,4.0,11/16/2013,"I have been here several times for both lunch and dinners and I have always had good experiences here.     I would say 90 percent of the time I order the beef dip when I come here. The beef dip is amazing and the horseradish and aus jus compliment it so well. Give it a shot if you haven't tried it yet.  I hear they make good pizzas, sandwiches and other varieties of food but I can't comment on those from a personal stand point.     BJs crafts their own brew and they have several tasty ones.  I recommend trying the beer sampler which gives you the opportunity to try about 8 of their craft beers. Some of Their seasonal beers are tasty as well.  The most recent one I tried was the pumpkin spice ale and it was very good.  A pizzookie is a must when you come here. Those things are so damn good.  My favorite is the Oreo pizzookie...simply outstanding! In conclusion, BJs is makes some good food and crafts some good brews.  One draw back is that the place gets crowded so depending on the time and day, trying to get a spot at the bar area is near impossible and the wait times can be hefty. BJs is one of my favorites spots to grab a meal and a beer and you can count  on it that I will be back."
Elizabeth P.,"Lawndale, CA",8,20,6,5.0,11/15/2014,"The burgers and fries are great, the ambiance is better, and the beer is THE best! BJ's Jeremiah Red is absolutely my favorite and I recommend it to any beer lover looking for something tasty that goes good with food AND will make you feel all warm and fuzzy haha .. I have never had a waitress or waiter I didn't like either! I finally had a Pizookie tonight--fresh baked cookie with vanilla bean ice cream on top. SO yummy!!  This is a great place to go with friends, family, or a date. And of course, you can shop before or after ;) Try BJ's and you won't be disappointed!"
K C.,"Garden Grove, CA",64,25,17,5.0,4/12/2015,Love their happy hour!   I usually go for the BJs Favorite Personal size.  Their Spring rolls are delish!!  I also usually get the Cabernet during happy hour which is 6 bucks.  Energy and atmosphere is always cool and fun.
Page N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",53,54,1,2.0,11/29/2015,"Crispy jalapeño burger was so so. My Sweetie had the California Chicken Club, not very good. Bacon wasn't cooked and the chicken was tough. And, they brought the wrong fries with the club."
Anne B.,"Torrance, CA",6,38,16,3.0,3/4/2016,"In moments like these, I really wish I would leave half star reviews. (3.5 stars) Anyways, I've been here multiple times, usually for birthdays or dinner after a movie. I've noticed that every time I come here the prices keep getting higher. A large pizza is $26 now and the big pizookie platter is $22 now. I miss the days before price hikes... The wait time will be at least 30 minutes on a Friday night, but today the buzzer they gave us was really odd. It went off so my party went up to get our table, but then they said that it was an accident. So they gave us a new buzzer (which we later found out didn't work) and they ended up just calling us up since our buzzer wasn't buzzing. So when we went up to finally be seating they told us the table wasn't clean yet.. Then why did they even call us?! Besides the odd beginning, our server was very attentive and friendly.. even though he forgot to even tell us his name lol. As for the food, the pizza is usually good! We had the deep dish BBQ chicken today and it was pretty good but could have used more BBQ and could have been cooked a bit longer because it was a bit soggy. Their menu is very extensive with everything from burgers to pasta to salads to sandwiches to fish and tacos... you name it. But you can never go to BJ's without getting a pizookie (the only thing that makes me come back here)! The cookies and cream flavor is my personal favorite, it's a chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream and an Oreo mousse. There are also a few other desserts on the menu, the strawberry beignet looked really good as well! Overall, it's a very busy and loud place, but it works for a large party."
Ticha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1102,1623,7645,3.0,5/17/2011,"WTH with the WET/SLIPPERY FLOORS? Geez...I almost ate it like 2-3 times going to the bathroom and back to my table. I wonder how the wait staff manuvers their way with the big plates around the slippery floors around the bathroom and bar area? Long wait, no pagers, no standing room, slow to get seated. Wait staff weren't too bad. The one we had was very attentive. She took care of us, but I think she was a bit overwhelmed with all the tables she had. Food was good, beer, PIZOOKIE (Red Velvet was just ok). I'd stick with the regular Pizookies since I thought the red velvet was too sweet.  Turn off the FUTBOL and turn on the MLB Sunday night game please.  Overall pretty good experience even though they were super packed."
Danny G.,"Chino, CA",3,21,3,1.0,3/13/2016,We went here for my daughters birthday. The service was slow but that is expected here. The bad part was they got my daughters food wrong and my southern fried chicken was un edible. I couldn't even cut with a knife. I told the waitress and she took it away but never said anything.
Dulce D.,"NORTHRIDGE, CA",198,96,72,3.0,9/4/2015,"BJ's food is Delicious, but going from the Valley- to Torrance to BJ's was not the business. I met up with my family & the service for a Wednesday Night was ridiculous. Sat down @ 7:10 & Didn't get our dinner til 9. The service is so slow. It was irritating. Even to get the bill was frustrating taking forever too. I don't think I will be going to that place."
Brad L.,"Compton, CA",186,221,239,4.0,1/23/2014,"Despite others' criticisms, we had very good service. (Katrina)  My girlfriend loved her balsamic-glazed chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes.  I had the cajun past; which was a bit backwards from what I expected.  Instead of the chicken being blackened, cajun-style, it was quite mild, but the pasta had quite a kick.  Honestly, I would do it the other way around.  I also sampled four of their brews: blond, brunette, piranha and hefewiezen.  The piranha was a bit hoppy and bitter for my taste, but the others were quite enjoyable.  We also managed to save room for dessert for a change, which was, of course, a pizookie sampler.  Delicious decadence, indeed."
