Maria A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,3,,5.0,11/29/2015,Great place!! I always go but my visit last Sunday was great. Our waiter Stephen was super attentive. He was checking if we needed anything constantly. The supervisor was also great! And of course the food was delicious as always!
Patricia L.,"Los Angeles, CA",116,95,44,4.0,12/24/2015,"I recently came here for dinner with a friend and we were seated right away! Since this restaurant is located at the mall, parking can be a hassle especially during the holidays. I love their service here overtime I come. Upon arrival, they seated us at a booth and my friend and I were surprised since there was only 2 of us. Our server was very nice and attentive. She made our experience there a whole lot better. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and guacamole and chips as appetizers and they were both delicious. I wasn't expecting a lot from the stuffed mushrooms but it turned out pretty good. I would definitely order that again. As for our entrees, I got the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger. Oh my, that was so good! It's one of their new burgers they have and it is definitely worth a try! Overall, good food and great service!"
Denise S.,"Carson, CA",63,55,20,5.0,2/20/2016,I love this place for only one reason: BERRY BURST CIDAR! Omg best alcoholic beverage INVENTED! I wish I could take it home. I sound like a lush but I am not. I only drink two kinds of alcoholic beverages and that is Margaritas and BERRY BURST. Yes I'm lame.
Gerardo P.,"Long Beach, CA",2,6,,3.0,3/26/2015,"Well ina start off by saying that i have been to other bjs befor just not this location. I came here during lunch hours with my girlfriend, it was barley half full when we arrivdd. We were seated promptly and given our waters in a timley matter. Now we did have trouble ordering so we asked the waiter (an older hispanic gentlmen) to return. 20 plus minutes later, still no waiter.. no big deal i guess. Finally he showed up and took our order  .avocado egg rolls .buffalo chicken deep dish The egg rolls came out first.. fresh and amazing no complaints there lol..  But then the pizza came out. I have tried this pizza befor at other locations so i kinda have a comparison of what i hope to taste and what i want. It was very very dry which to me is a very odd thing to taste in a pizza.. it barley had any cheese or buffalo sauce and was for the price you pay very dissapointing, and when we went to look for our waiter we had to wait almost another 20 minutes to even find him.. i actually began to think he was on break but then i saw him across the room chatting away .. it took me another 10 minutes to flag him down (all i wanted was extra buffalo sauce) and by that time i asked for the check as well.. this location was probably the worst ive been too but they cant all be great"
Cindy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,22,18,3.0,12/12/2014,"Good drinks and good food, but host was very rude, he whistle at me to let me know my table was ready. Appetizers took a long time. I spoke to the manager and he removed the appetizers"
Bri B.,"Torrance, CA",18,17,,2.0,8/16/2015,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. seriously, Moses is one of the worst waiters I have had at BJs or any other restaurant. no one came to our table for 20 mins after we were seated and when Moses finally came by, he dumped a bunch of dirty plates AT OUR TABLE (this is so disgusting and unsanitary I can't even begin..) while he said ""what do you want to drink?"" not a polite asking, no greeting, no anything. really? the rest of the meal went similarity- he paid us NO attention and almost acted like we were a burden to him. I had to flag him down any time we needed something - and since I got only get his attention twice, we did not have the meal we wanted. for example I ordered fish and chips and was not given malt vinegar, no problem usually unless your waiter doesn't come by for another 30 minutes, so i went without. likewise, we would have ordered another round or 2 of drinks, but we're not given the opportunity.  We were beginning to think that Moses was just a bad waiter, but then another couple was sat across from us. Mind you, I am in a lesbian interracial relationship and the couple across from us was white and heterosexual. Moses paid them 100000000 times more attention - so much so it was hard to miss. He even squatted down at their table to tell them any specials and all of that. They were sat, fed, paid and gone and he whole time Moses ignored us completely. It's hard not to take that personally and not feel offended seeing the major difference in attention and respect from Moses. Very disappointing altogether, and we will not be back to this location."
Jamie A.,"Escondido, CA",507,530,1309,3.0,1/7/2013,"Note they are open at 10 am for brunch! Awesome for early-risers and people who wake up hungry (me!).  I usually eat something sugary like pancakes - but this time I decided on a breakfast sando with bacon, eggs, swiss cheese. I am picky about bread and the sourdough was perfectly crispy and buttery.  The dish came with potatoes which I liked because they were not greasy at all. Our server was really attentive and although it took a long while for our food to come out - service was great.  We got to substitute items without any problems and got ketchup and Tabasco when we asked. I have only been here for Happy Hour, so I was pleasantly surprised.  Be prepared to thumb through a lengthy menu though.  HH is Mon- Fri 3 - 7 and you get 50% off mini pizzas and $1 off brews. DEAL! The details:"
Ali E.,"Torrance, CA",233,66,20,1.0,11/23/2014,The pizza and food were decent but the service is slow... So slow... It takes an average of 20 min to have your drink orders taken 20 more min to get your drinks and it just gets worse from there...  The worst part of all is after we finished eating our food it took us nearly 30 min to get our check.   I had to walk in to the kitchen find the manager and ask him to find our check since our waitress was nowhere to be found.  Needless to say... I won't be going back
Adam F.,"Long Beach, CA",52,561,116,3.0,11/11/2013,"I got dragged here as part of a work function organized by someone with no taste in food. I actually expected I'd hate it - loud, boring chain right in the heart of a giant strip mall? No thanks. But I went anyway, and I have to say, I was... at least partially surprised: It was indeed deafeningly loud when we were there - so loud you could barely hear the person next to you, let alone anyone on the other side of our 10 person table. And the service was indeed craptaculous - orders confused or forgotten until asked about, brought out slowly and at widely differing times, difficulty getting extra place settings, all the things you would expect of a place like this. That aside, though, I'll say this: the food was actually pretty good. I was not expecting that, but there you have it. I was expecting one step up in food quality from Denny's - it was several. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't complain about it to the same extent I did this time, either. Their steak was an excellent cut of steak and cooked perfectly; their mango salad was pretty tasty (even if it could have used a lot more mango in it), and their tomato bisque soup was actually one of the best I've tasted. A little overpriced for the fact that it's nothing particularly *interesting*, but it is still surprisingly good food."
Angela E.,"Culver City, CA",0,25,1,2.0,11/8/2015,"This is for the breakfast menu and service. The coffee is really good and smooth, but their machine broke so no refills, and one person at our people didn't get his coffee until AFTER his meal.. The breakfast food is just ok. I tried the veggie omelette and it looks nothing like its picture in the menu. The short stack of pancakes is supposed to be 3 pancakes but they gave us 2 for some reason. (Maybe the pancake machine wasn't working either?) As good as the coffee was, I won't be going back, at least not for breakfast."
Orlando J.,"Torrance, CA",79,5,,2.0,3/13/2016,"Connor provided excellent service, he was very attentive and very polite.. However the cooks have NO IDEA what they're doing, I asked for my streak medium rare, Rare being the key word. They made it is medium well Almost well done.. This isn't the first time this happens either which is the sad part. As a chef, I am very disappointed with the fact that BJs cooks don't know the difference between steak temperatures.. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."
marian m.,"Culver City, CA",63,124,70,4.0,12/13/2014,"Came here for a holiday work party!!! Service was very slow in the beginning but very good experience over all... Appetizers were amazing egg roll, cheese fingers, and spinach dip...m pizza was yummy. All white pizza was very delisious... House pizza was good and santa fe salad was amazing... We finished the night with a gigantic pazzoki!!!!!"
Sonya P.,"Torrance, CA",194,16,4,4.0,5/22/2016,"Came here with my family yesterday to celebrate my graduation. The food and drinks were good, and our server Moses took great care of us."
Pia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,29,14,5.0,9/12/2015,"One of the best bj's I've been to in a long time. Clean and friendly service. We had a great time and our server Stefan totally made our night. He was super friendly, attentive and really took great care of us. I will definitely return to this bj's and Stefan is one of the main reasons why!"
Melika S.,"Torrance, CA",0,28,33,5.0,3/4/2016,"Joe was so outgoing, genuine, and sweet. He was an overall amazing server that catered all of our needs perfectly. Will be back again just for the amazing service."
Dianna M.,"Inglewood, CA",61,21,18,2.0,9/26/2015,"i used to be a fan of this specific location, however my last visit has me disgusted of BJs. Food just doesnt taste the same anymore,theres no quality in it, taste like microwave food now. my last visit was this weekend and my husband and I ordered appetizer: potstickers (taste like something you would buy at costco in the frozen area)  pizza: it was so bland. the crust was wayyy too fluffy and not enough cheese seriously pizza hut can probably do better. RIBS:  i was tired of the usual i get wich is any chicken entree so i was craving ribs, worst decision! OMG the ribs from here are so disgusting , they were so dry and the meat wasnt good at all , i felt like i was biting into nothing but fat ,there was literally no meat on it. and if there was meat it was nasty and chewy at least if it was smothered in more BBQ sauce maybe they would be just ok. but NO i hated my meal. i shouldve just got half rack if anything i left more than half a slack! sucks:/  oh and the mashed potatoes that i asked for with it were so nasty! dry ass hell and plain it tasted like powder mix that forms into mashed potatoes. how sad!  im sad typing this!! lol  so since my meal was horrible i had to at least order the famous pizzokie to make up for that horrendous dinner i had and leave at least 20% satisfied. hmm wont ever be returning   grossed me out"
JESSE C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,50,13,3.0,9/14/2014,"I'm eating gluten free for a few weeks.  The have a Gluten-Free menu! Awesome... The food was good.  All three peeps in party enjoyed their food.  However, the service wasn't very good at all.  Server, seemed really tired, slow and not very attentive.  Brought coffee with no cream or sweetener, got order wrong, and a couple other things.  She went on a much needed break.  Next server, took a few things off the bill to make up for other server's mix ups. I've always had good experiences at BJ's so, I won't hold this visit against them.  They did make it right; which is what it's about...."
Steven S.,"Gardena, CA",73,76,1107,4.0,1/8/2016,"Even though they've raised up their prices and changed the menu items and happy hour to give you less, the majority of the food is still tasty and full of flavorful. I don't come here as much as I use to but when I do I still enjoy it always a fun environment, service can be a bit slow but I go into it knowingly."
Lan N.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,17,2,4.0,1/7/2016,"Favorite place to grab something to eat when I'm in the area. They have great lunch specials, I usually get the soup and half sandwich deal for $8 bucks. Pretty good deal. Their kids menu is good too for the little ones. The reason why I took down one star because sometimes they are packed and long wait."
Aaron B.,"Bellflower, CA",317,61,64,2.0,12/2/2014,BJ's food is always amazing and they have a ton of cool and creative dishes for being such a large chain restaurant. I worked at one in Huntington Beach for over a year and know how they should be ran and this one is not doing a great job at it. Sucks because they have such a great location and are in a primetime area.  The wait to get served here is extremely long and our food throughout the night came out luke warm. (Pizookies came out cold. I should never be able to touch the metal pan and not burn my finger lol) I will definitely not return to this location in particular and if I am part of a group will suggest another location or restaurant all together.
