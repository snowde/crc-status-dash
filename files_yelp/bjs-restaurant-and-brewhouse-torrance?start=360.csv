Joe A.,"Washington, DC",6,22,2,1.0,1/3/2016,Slow service. Went there today and they got my order wrong they took for ever and didn't seem to care.
Winston S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",93,447,89,2.0,8/10/2013,"Our server was Bennett, or something like that, and he was very slow at bringing our drinks and dropping off our check.  He slams down the drinks, when he delivers them, which is not proper nor polite. Food was decent as usual, but service needs much improvement.  Where do they find these people?"
Lorrie H.,"Los Angeles, CA",70,7,2,4.0,1/13/2017,"Me and my boyfriend love coming here. We visit often. More than we probably should. Usually everything goes very well both dine in and call in. I understand what it's like to be busy as I've worked in food service in the past; but  today, I called in to place a take out order and drove form my home all the the way to this location while on hold waiting for the order to be taken. I left the phone on the call, and the very second I step in the door the young lady at the Togo counter hangs up the phone! Yes they were busy..but I found that intersting. I explained that I was just on hold for about 15 min and that the second I stepped in that the phone call was hung up. Showed me all the order tickets that were placed before me, which have nothing to do with why I was hung up on after waiting for someone to come back to the phone and take the order to be started. She admitted to hanging it up and proceeds to take my order :-/. I wanted to call in order for a reason. Then I paid full price for lettuce wraps and a small pizza $30.18. Lol smh. I guess when places get busy now a days good customer service goes out the window."
Melissa A.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",48,1,,1.0,4/16/2016,"Food was okay but, service was very slow. No concept of service here. Management can start training their staff."
Brandon H.,"Long Beach, CA",2,8,1,3.0,4/25/2015,Everything took forever Mac n cheese was horrible beware they forget to give you refills  The only good thing about the end was my cookie
Dianne D.,"Harbor City, CA",238,91,39,4.0,5/15/2015,Usually when I eat here the food is so-so. But this time we got the deep dish pizza and lasagna and both were surprisingly really good! Their pizookie is amazing as always. I don't think any other place can top their pizookie. The only problem I had was service was really slow. If you're going to eat here I suggest bringing someone you can talk to for a looooong time. I had good company so I didn't really mind plus our waiter was super nice to us.
Abby S.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,41,38,3.0,9/19/2013,"Gosh ice been coming here for their grilled chicken fettuccine Alfredo and their Oreo pazookie for ages! But I gotta say, they're not as consistent with the quality of their food. Sometimes it would be great but sometimes it tasted bleeh. I love their crispy thin cut fries but last time I came here, it was soggy and too salty.  Servers are usually amazing 95% of the time so kuddos."
Zachary M.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/9/2016,"My gf and I went on Saturday evening and it was very busy. We walk in and walk up to the hostess station, there were about 5 girls talking to each other, not one noticed us for a good minute. Finally one of the girls looked over and said ""for two?"" My gf said yes and she just rolled her eyes and started walking. I was about to call a manager but my gf said it's fine. When we go to our table my gf said thank you and again, the hostess rolled her eyes and walked away without explaining anything. I don't know if the hostess has been having a bad day but she shouldn't bring her attitude to work.       We just tried to brush off what just happened and enjoy our date night. But our server came up to us and he wasn't the greatest. He seems very stoned, with bloodshot eyes, very slow response, and kept saying ""I'm sorry, what was that?"" so we had to repeat our order many times. He wasn't rude so it didn't really bother us but our table next to us seemed very angry at him. I guess they brought out the food and they had no silverware for at least ten minutes until the father walked up to a server to ask for some, and their food was cold by then. The server also took one of their drinks for a refill and never came back with it for the whole meal. Now they were waiting for their dessert but it's been 30 minutes. It was hard to enjoy our meal when the people next to us were so angry.       But I have to say we love their food. Especially the best beginnings! It has a bit of everything and the portions are huge. They have a wide selection of beers too.       In all our meal was fine, but management really needs to work on training their staff and weeding out the rude ones. It can really ruin a customers whole evening."
Jasper L.,"Arcadia, CA",870,60,37,5.0,7/14/2014,"I don't like BJ's. I really don't. I actually went out of my way to avoid it after having one terrible experience after the next at other BJ's. But I went today because of nostalgic reasons. Because I wanted to eat a Pizookie on my birthday. I went during lunch hour and headed straight for the bar. Party of one unfortunately - no one else at work has my lunch schedule anymore. I went straight to the bar and was greeted by Andrew, or Andy as he preferred. He's the reason behind the 5 stars. He is knowledgable about the menu, charismatic and knows how to make small talk. It's the first time in the years I've given BJ's my business that I've met an employee capable of making you feel welcome. He was also on top of refilling my water and my root beer - no drinking during work hours :( After ordering a lunch special, the BBQ Chicken Pizza that came out was actually fantastic. The cilantro was fresh, tomatoes were good and the chicken wasn't dry. I was shocked. The salad before didn't disappoint either (But I'm a sucker for Honey Mustard). Noting my ID, Andy wished me a happy birthday and brought out the little mini birthday pizookie. How awesome is that. Thank you for making my experience a great one. The service was top notch and Andy did a great job restoring my faith in the chain. I don't think I'd go to any other location frankly. Cheers to you for making my otherwise boring birthday lunch, very enjoyable."
Savanna M.,"Hawthorne, CA",5,20,,5.0,2/18/2016,Service was quick. Our waiters were great and very personable. Our meals were delish! The waiter helped us pick our beer sampler and he did an amazing job. All the beers were great! Can't wait to go back!
Todd P.,"San Pedro, CA",62,37,67,4.0,8/4/2014,"This was my first time in BJ's after countless times at The Del Amo mall. Went for a light dinner after watching a movie. The variety was impressive! With lots of burgers, tacos, sandwiches, and an abundance of sides and appetizers. I had a bowl of clam chowder that was great as well as a platter with a lot of other things. It can be pricey but the food was good regardless. I look forward to coming back and trying one of their burgers."
Taylor C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",28,29,17,5.0,9/19/2015,"Went to Bjs tonight with my family, a group of five of us, and we had a great experience. Our waiter, Jared was probably the best waiter I have had at ANY restaurant. He was so nice and pleasurable. He was always making sure we had what we needed. He did not wait until our drinks were completely empty to come around with a new one and came around refilling our waters when needed. He made sure we had our food and that everything was good. And before when we were ordered I had about three questions about items on the menu and he answered them no problem and told me what he liked about the dishes and how they tasted. He was great ! Oh and the food was great too! They have a new barbacoua spiced chicken that is amazing !!!"
Karamelia M.,"Tomball, TX",120,22,4,5.0,1/30/2016,Food was delicious and customer service was amazing. The server catered to everything so quick. Great first time experience. Also the pazookies are TO DIE FOR! Definitely will be returning.
Jaime M.,"Torrance, CA",5,5,1,2.0,6/7/2015,Went to have dinner on Sunday we were told to wait 30 mins after the time was up we were told to wait another 30 mins on top of that not cool when you're  hungry and told one thing and then we wait 15 mins to see anyone before we order Sunday is not a good day to eat here.food was ok!!
Joshua H.,"Lomita, CA",2,6,11,4.0,1/29/2016,If your in Torrance it's a must stop. Great place for family dinner and drinks! Service here is awesome
Cheryln J.,"San Pedro, CA",29,25,16,4.0,11/23/2014,"One of my fav spots, lots of menu choices and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Comfortable, casual atmosphere and lots of TVs! Also some really good and extremely affordable lunch specials. Great place for a great meal."
Marsanna S.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,3,,2.0,8/18/2014,"I really like this place, because of it's location an my last visit we had excellent service,but this visit I'd wish I had kept going! Very bad customer service!! :(  I don't  what I today,i.guess it's Monday?? If it wasn't for the desserts, which I love so well, I would not come   this location,there are way too many places in this area to eat, to be stuck with.bad customer service!!"
Pansy T.,"Lawndale, CA",2,9,,2.0,12/20/2015,"I always thought the food here was pretty good, but the amount of times my order has been wrong is just unacceptable. After working in a restaurant for 3 years I completely understand that mistakes happen and it's perfectly okay. However, for the last 3 times I've been at BJ's my order always came out COMPLETELY wrong. That is absolutely aggravating. Not only does my food come out wrong, I also get charged twice for a salad that I only ordered once. It just makes no sense, the only reason why I gave two stars was because my server was attentive and tried to help."
Shingo A.,"Dallas, TX",105,699,318,4.0,9/25/2014,"I was surprised how good the ribeye steak was.  In fact, it tasted better than the steak at Outback and Black Angus.  Enjoyed their beer, good service, and their reasonable prices for food items."
Kat S.,"Las Vegas, NV",935,352,3088,1.0,4/10/2014,"Saturday 1pm: called in ahead to ask if they had lunch specials on the weekend hostess said ""I'm not sure let me ask"" and put me on hold .... for 5 min at which point I hung up bc 5min is a long a*s time on the phone. Showed up and was seated immediately. Had issues with empty water glasses throughout the meal, asking specifically for dressing on the side - the waiter repeating it and then a busser dropping off a salad drowned in dressing, asked for small bills with my change for tip (I was owed $11) and got back 2 fives and a one. had to wait another 10 min to get some dollar bills back for tip. i love the soup at BJ's but i'll never come back to this location. basically, tons of waiters and bussers walking around being too busy to ever check-in with our table."
