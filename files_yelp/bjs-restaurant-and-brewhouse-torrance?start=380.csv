Radu M.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,58,88,2.0,5/31/2014,"We were a party of four and the full rack of ribs had a good flavor, but the meat did not fall of the bone so let's say was just 75% good, the Caesar Salad was good and the least good was the Deep Dish Pizza that was NOT Deep Dish at all...so after turning back TWO we gave up since we had to get to the X-Men movie.   The Pizza Guy maker at this restaurant really needs some kind of Gordon Ramsey training...F****...or maybe the Manager is NOT really paying attention!!! They messed up my Saturday that I enjoyed at the beach!"
Jennifer C.,"Torrance, CA",2,4,,3.0,1/7/2016,"I liked this restaurant when hangout with friends, modern decorations with friendly staffs. Menu have so many to choose from. Their deep dish pizza is the most delicious pizza I ever had. Happy hours are good deal!!!"
Diana F.,"Carson, CA",1,60,6,5.0,7/22/2016,The Homey Sriacha Brussels Sprouts are DELICIOUS! Jessica took great care of my girlfriends and I. A great lunch topped off with the S'mores Pizookie. Can't wait to come back for the brussel sprouts.
Alan k.,"Torrance, CA",0,40,,1.0,8/7/2016,"Cheap food, poor plate presentation, slow service...Don't know how they can survive in this mall vs. Lazy Dog just a few doors down ( excellent quality food, good plate presentation, excellent service) !!"
Brian W.,"West Los Angeles, CA",296,1703,4,3.0,5/10/2013,"BJ's for lunch or dinner is usually decent for chain food. Unusually, we went here for weekend brunch, 'cause all our usual places had 30+ minute waits and we had a schedule to keep. Brunch was.... so-so. They asked if we wanted an appetizer (?!?!), the place was almost deserted so the rows of dark booths and the large dark room just felt weird, and the food itself was just so-so. Oatmeal was merely edible, but at least it was cheap. French toast, ham, and eggs was reportedly okay, but the eggs were pretty meh. How do you mess up eggs? Granted, BJ's isn't normally a brunch place..."
Diana I.,"Los Angeles, CA",2263,1137,1415,3.0,6/14/2010,"When this BJ's first opened in the Del Amo Mall, it was ridiculously packed. I'm talking a 1 and a half hour wait for dinner! What the heck?! It's only BJ's for crying out loud! I've been to BJ's at other locations too and I'd say in comparison, this one is a little busier and packed than the other ones. But the food is the same.  They're known for their pizzas but I'm personally not a fan of them. They're thick and ""gourmet"" pizzas or whatever but I never find myself wanting to eat more. But, I do love their pizookies! My favorite is the regular chocolate chip cookie with the vanilla ice cream on top. MMM they also have a pizookie platter for large parties! and a pizookie trio which is 3 mini pizookies which are good for sharing in small groups.  They also have a pretty good late night happy hour, good drinks, and lots of TVs to view your favorite sports games.  Service is okay. They can forget to bring a couple things here and there but overall they're really friendly. :)"
Hattie H.,"Torrance, CA",17,33,25,2.0,7/3/2015,Terrible customer service. The waiters are forgetful. The food is mediocre. Only reason they get 2 stars is because they have great selection of beers.
Bandy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,20,1,3.0,8/16/2015,I would like to start off by saying that I do enjoy the food and beer here. But every time I frequent the bathroom it's usally at a good level of nasty. Another thing they could work on is getting condiments you actually request. Many times food has come and something was missing and have waited to long or just gave up . Just needing to tie up lose ends and this place would be awesome .
Yumi K.,"Santa Monica, CA",368,202,314,4.0,4/17/2013,My favorite thing here is the lunch special unlimited soup and salad! Other than that... Ehh... Oh and the pizookies! I had a calzone but it's not as good as your local pizza places... We waited like 35 min for food too.
Cerene C.,"Carson, CA",0,12,3,2.0,4/8/2015,"First off, me and my bf have been here a couple of times because of their pizookie. I love thie place. But one unfortunate thing happened. Me and my bf decided to eat here today for some good food and pizookie at around 3:45pm. It wasn't packed and we got a seat as soon as we got there. So all is good. We ordered our food. My boyfriend got the salmon and I got the southern chicken. Then we waited  and waited some more. We saw people who came after us got their food.  Then after an hour (more or less) of waiting, the manager came to our table to apologize for the wait. He said that the salmon accidentally got served to another table. He offered us free soup (we got the tomato soup) and it was good.  Food wise, there's really no complains. What annoys me the most was our server (she's a blond one, I forgot her name). Never did she update us about our food while we were waiting for so long. When we got our order, never did she apologize for the long wait. And when we were almost done eating, she went to us with the check already before asking us if we want some dessert. We told her we wanted the pizookie so she took back the check and left. We got our pizookie (triple chocolate) and it looked so good. A few minutes after we got the pizookie, she came back with the check again and said 'no rush, it's for your convenience'. So we just put our card while we continued eating. She rushed to get our card then came back for the receipt. We were not even halfway the pizookie yet (my bf and i were just sharing) so we didn't sign the check yet. Then she went back again to go get the receipt and we told her we haven't signed yet. A few minutes later she went back and we haven't signed it yet again. So I told my bf just to sign it to get it over with. It's just an unpleasant experience because it felt like she was rushing us. It wasn't our fault in the first place that we were there so long. It was the ""swapped salmon's"" fault. She even just came to us once to ask how we were doing and it looked like she didn't want to be there. To the manager who came to our table to apologize and offered us free soup, thank you so much. You are professional and you seems to care for your customers greatly. To that blonde woman who unfortunately was our server for the day, I hope that you don't rush every customers that you serve. Learn to smile genuinely. Learn to care about your customers. Learn ""customer service"". We weren't going to tip you but we still did. That doesn't mean you deserve it. You ruined what could've been a pleasant experience for me and my bf. It looked like you didn't even want to be there in the first place. I got news for you girl, there's plenty of people dying to be in your place right now. And I'm sure that they're going to do a better job than you.  I'm still gonna go to this place, but I'll leave once this server will be my server again."
Daniel S.,"Lawndale, CA",0,4,4,5.0,1/10/2015,The Tuscan chicken limon plate is very tasty and has good consistently. The trio cookie dessert is good.
Ashley L.,"Torrance, CA",53,5,2,1.0,3/13/2014,"I want to be clear THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS! My reason for a 1 star is that we had a terrible server last night. It was so awful I wrote an email to corporate about it. Our servers name was Katrina B. If you have her as a server please request to chance servers. It took us 1 whole hour to get a salad and a small pizza when the restaurant was not busy. We witnessed her chatting with other servers, she was very not very attentive. She walked passed our table 4 or 5 times staring at our empty beverage glasses before I had to flag her down to refill our drinks. She was taking her hair down and putting back up into a low pony tail AS SHE WAS WALKING INTO THE KITCHEN. It also took her 10 minutes to even come take our order. When we asked for a napkin because we only received one when we were seated, she proceeded to go and grab a stack of brown square bar beverage napkins.  Great food terrible service. If you get Katrina B. as your server please do yourself a favor and request a new server."
Maggie C.,"Torrance, CA",117,173,121,5.0,4/1/2013,"We (Beef and I ) LOVE BJ's. The place is hoppin' on the weekends, guaranteed. We sit up in the bar area to be helped faster. Service is great, food is interesting yet not too crazy. Beef loves his chicken stuffed baked potato and ""A Drink Like That"" I am a fan of the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. Big chunks of tuna and lots of greens.  So many drink choices. When I do drink I get their Harvest Hef Beer on Tap with a slice of lemon. Sign up for the BJ's perks club and you begin earning points right away. First visit after you enroll you get a free pzookie! Great for a Date night dinner and movie combo"
Cindy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,593,170,2.0,3/11/2014,"What's all the hub, bub?   It was loud and crowded.  We ordered the club sandwich and hamburger.  Meat was dry in burger and the sandwich was okay.  Although, I didn't care for the parm cheese toast that the sandwich came on.  Shoestring fries were a little cold and our order didn't come out together. The service was bad and the food was just meh.  A lot of dining choices out there folks, so skip this one and move along."
Kanin A.,"Gardena, CA",39,27,5,4.0,1/23/2016,"Celebrating my birthday with my fam here and so far, everything has been pretty great. The only reason why this isn't 5 stars is because they messed up on uncle's order three times. He ordered a bacon burger with wedge fries and red onions. The burger had no onions and he got the skinny fries. They had to bring the two things separately. Other than that, everything else was fine. The waiters were nice and funny and the pizookie is just awesome"
LaTonya P.,"San Pedro, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/28/2015,This is the worst BJ's to go to. Their service is horrible and they continuously mess up on your food. I ordered a pizooki party platter and it was burnt. We re-ordered it and it was burnt again. I DONT recommend going to this BJ's. 0 stars
Angel P.,"Commerce, CA",2,4,9,1.0,7/30/2015,"Bad service as far as I'm concerned, brought my fiancé after we both had a long day at work thinking of a good dinner... Order a glass of the brewery beer they have they where out for the day... Lol so much for trying something new ... Ordered ahi tuna they did not provide soy or wasabi I had to ask for soy sauce.. And that's all I got I guess I should of been more specific and said wasabi lol but I guess what ever right you get what you pay for not this time around... Got a rib eye it was too over cooked it really tasted like charcoal disgusting"
Reese M.,"Los Angeles, CA",328,333,210,3.0,9/12/2012,"BJ's is ok if you are in the mood for commercial deep-dish pizza.  Wait for the 2 for $20 deal that comes out periodically. For $20, you get 2 salads, a choice of a pizza, and a pizookie to share. It's a great deal."
Amna K.,"Torrance, CA",0,13,1,3.0,7/3/2016,I come here a lot and the waiters always seem to mess up my order except for Joseph. He is the best waiter there so pleasant and sweet and does not get the order wrong.
Eldora B.,"Long Beach, CA",100,26,2,2.0,5/25/2015,"We eat here often and this has been the worst! Service was horrible. It took 2 hours to serve 6 people from the time we sat down to the time we left. And it was not that crowded (20 min wait). In addition to our food taking forever, we had to ask twice for sugar for ice tea which should have been automatic, it took over 30 mins to get 3 desserts, and had to ask three times for spoons for dessert. The worst part is that the wait staff seem to not care. I asked to speak to a manager who never came over. Will think twice before coming here again!"
