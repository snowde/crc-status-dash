Pat L.,"Torrance, CA",69,46,172,3.0,1/20/2017,"If you're super hungry and want super fast service..... then this is not the place for you. If you're willing to wait like 40 minutes to an hour for your food to be served... then go for it! I came here with my friend and we were super hungry. We waited like 45 minutes for our food to be served. There weren't much people when we came but it took really long for our food to come.  FOOD: -We got the Chicken Alfredo, which was the bestselling pasta according to our server, and the deep dish Ziti. They were pretty good but the Chicken Alfredo was a bit dry.  -We also got a Spicy Pig pizza and I really liked it. It had bacon so........ of course it's good lol. SERVICE: -Our server was really nice although she was quite busy and hard to find so you really have to be patient when you eat at Bj's.  Overall, I give it three stars because of the slow service. I would've given more stars if it wasn't for that."
Leslie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",345,195,145,5.0,11/30/2016,"This BJ's is nice. Its located in the heart of the Del Amo Mall! You could kill a date in one place!! BJ's is really clean, roomy, and a great environment to have any kind of parties. The bathrooms are really nice and clean. Today my waitress was Angela. She is a fellow Sagittarius like me so I knew she was going to be great. I had the spinach dip, fries, two shots, and one drink and everything was wonderful. Angela was very nice, kind, and took our order and made anything wonderful. Ofcourse i received the famous Bazooki and ice cream and the cookie was soft and ice cream perfect. I would visit this BJ's 1000000 times!"
Chris I.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",4,45,2,2.0,8/15/2017,"I was torn whether to give this place a 2 or 3 star rating- Service- Pleasant and attentive Sante Fe Salad- I have had a version of this salad several times at other places and have always really liked it.  However, this salad sucked.  It had very little flavor.  Ate about half of it and left the rest to be thrown away. Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with Sweet Potato Fries- This was pretty good and I would recommend it.  Had a good BBQ flavor to it."
Denise B.,"Long Beach, CA",37,237,120,3.0,6/8/2017,i would have to say the last 2 times I came here the service seems to be on a decline. And the food is always changing. I'll start sticking to the HH section because its like you have to flag someone down to get service. Just know what you're getting youself into and adjust your expectations.
Stephan C.,"Gardena, CA",0,3,,5.0,11/11/2017,"Picture yourself going to a restaurant, ordering a burger with fries, except your picturing it to be plan and simple , well now imagine the moment they bring you that burger , you see this colossal burger that looks straight out the TV , not only does it look fantastic but taste better, this is truly a great place to bring family and friends to enjoy delightful food."
Asuka M.,"Torrance, CA",74,21,26,1.0,6/24/2017,"Horrible. Had a reservation at 7:30 but did not get seated until 8:15. Worst part, they couldn't even put everyone together! We got separated!  We were counting on BJ's to make my amazing coworker/friend's going away/congratulatory dinner special since we all could hardly get together. They disappointed us very much. I love their pizookies but I can live without it. Probably never coming back again."
Tim M.,"Torrance, CA",9,6,,1.0,5/22/2017,"BJ's used to be one of our favorite places to dine while at the Del Amo mall. I am writing this review from a different restraunt nearby, because my wife and I just watched two innings of baseball from our table without even being greeted by a server. This was totally unacceptable from any restaurant, let alone from a large chain like BJ's. And we were met with indifference when we told the host why we were leaving on the way out. So long BJ's."
Dan S.,"Detroit, MI",6,21,2,1.0,6/22/2017,"Apparently splitting checks is the worlds most monumental task. Something Stacked seems to have accomplished with the use of some alien technology called an iPad? Also never asked if we needed to split the checks and asked us to write down ""how much we owe"""
Danielle M.,"Edgewood, MD",128,123,300,4.0,12/6/2016,I am traveling for business and decided to stop in for a quick dinner.  I had never been there before and I was pleasantly surprised. The Asian chopped salad was delicious. It was on the light menu but didn't lack any flavor.  I ordered an order of the wings and they were yummy! The waiter was pretty good .  The skinny margarita was very good and you couldn't tell that it was skinny.  I can't wait to return.
Claudia V.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,5,1,1.0,6/2/2017,"Not one of my greatest experience there. Server (Richard) was kind of friendly ""I guess"" the food came right after the appetizer. Didn't get my salad before. Prime rib was sold out so I got another steak. When I asked for the dessert the server said if didn't came with it. I order a new dessert and it took almost 15 min to get it. I went to the front and and asked for my check and Cancelled the dessert the manager said oh! Ok! And she did. I had seen her before but not once the manager on duty approached our table to ask if everything was ok. It's sucks that this place doesn't see it as ""every table is my table"" don't think I'm Coming back."
Razi S.,"Torrance, CA",55,82,36,5.0,5/10/2017,I love this restaurant every time I stop by it is always a great experience. The menu is like a book and anything you order will taste amazing. My wife and I come here when we need a break from the kids and it is always nice night. The last two times we came here we had the same server he was awesome and super nice. For dessert we got the 3 mini Pazookie combo they were all out of mini plates and they brought up regular size Pazookie. My wife and I could not believe our eyes. That was a great night I don't think i will forget that anytime soon. Over all the food is 5 stars the service is 5 stars and I can't wait to head back for another meal.
Bobby Y.,"Torrance, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/26/2017,"We very much enjoyed our visit to BJs this weekend. Our server was Steffan, and he made sure everything went as it should and was well organized. They got our order right, even after my wife had to make a bunch of substitutions! I would definitely come back here!"
Devon C.,"Lawndale, CA",105,110,141,5.0,5/22/2016,"Had a great time with my bro and my wife Got a pitcher of beer, deep dish ziti, jambalaya and a some shrimp penned dish. All the food was delicious and the servers, who switched off for a lunch break, were both great! Shoutout to Cindy and Kristina! Will be coming back! We were told we had to wait 20minutes for a table but only took five. Both servers we had were really attentive, kind and a delight to be around. Service was slightly slow but it was a full house, nothing on their end they can do. Gotta be more patient when you know they are slammed and you will have a great time. :)"
Jasmine S.,"Gardena, CA",4,84,60,1.0,10/9/2016,"My boyfriend and I decided to come here because Buffalo Wild Wings had a long wait. We sat in the bar section in a booth and our waiter was great. We order the buffalo and root beer barbecue wings (boneless & bone-in) which was okay, nothing spectacular. We order the five meat pizza, which was AWFUL!!! My boyfriend and I literally ate bread w/melted cheese and burnt ham! There was a pinch of marinara sauce on the pizza. This was the WORST pizza I have ever had in my life! For desert we ordered the trio poozike. We ordered the oreo, chocolate chunk and monkey bread. The chocolate chunk and oreo poozkie was amazing. The monkey bread had NO taste! We didn't taste any cinnamon or brown sugar. We practically ate baked bread with vanilla ice cream. We should have never left Buffalo Wild Wings. I will NEVER eat at this location again!"
David S.,"Pico Rivera, CA",84,248,46,1.0,4/30/2017,"Interesting when a group comes in, they are told it is a five minute wait. After twenty minutes, it is asked why the delay and why others are being seated. They stated they were preparing a table up front since a few people have walkers in the group. Fine, it is what it is. But then they sit another group at that table! After concern was raised again, everyone is escorted to the table in the far back corner! Total disconnect amongst hosts/hostesses and service was horrible."
Ed C.,"Vallejo, CA",0,18,,5.0,10/18/2017,From out of town on business. Hotel suggested this place. They were right on. Bartended was outstanding ( Angela) and the lemon pepper dry rub wings were very tasty. So good in fact i came back on my second night in town. Good food great bartenders nice atmosphere  Been a year and i am back. Same bartenders Angela and Lauren. Both are fantastic. Food and beer happy hour priced are super. Highly recommend sitting at bar and watch sports
BF S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,119,43,3.0,6/11/2017,I was surprised there was no wait on a weekend but now that I've read some not so positive reviews it's getting clearer. My experience was decent. Our waitress wasn't friendly but we didn't need a comedian. We both asked for Diet Coke our waitress said ok as an afterthought i said it is Coke isn't it she says no it's Pepsi. My friend and I said no thanks then. You don't automatically assume that's ok i for one hate Pepsi. I had the Cobb salad no bacon of course the salad had bacon. Other then that it was fine.
Gina H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/13/2017,"I went there with 6 other ladies and it was awful.  First we had to wait around 20 minutes after calling ahead of time, Second the floor is very slippery and it makes you worried to walk on it., Third the service was slow, Fourth the food options were all unhealthy.  We all got drinks and nobody was happy with them, they all varied on what they were--mojitos, dessert type, martini's etc.  The pizookies were decent but not worth all the hype or the calories.  I will not be back"
Pooja M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",10,14,6,1.0,2/14/2017,"They ruined our valentines night. First of all the server bought our drink glass holding by hand, almost putting his fingers in the glasses... yuk! Secondly the pizza veggie one which we ordered was completely stale and cold. When we complained about it he just microwaved it and bought back??? We denied for that microwaved pizza and asked for new one. New pizza was again cold and stale.  Their cloth napkins were black, I don't prefer black napkins, can't even check if it's clean or not... Burger was mediocre, just warm, we asked for ketchup they took forever to get that. We left the food as it is and headed home. No restaurant was open by then we had to sleep hungry."
Sandy M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",45,87,285,3.0,7/25/2017,"This was a very odd experience. While my phone showed the Wi-Fi was strong, I could not sign on to the internet & I could not use the app, that was my first annoyance. The waiter Steven was particularly efficient and polite. He brought my steak, which seemed really small compared the menu picture. I don't think the menu states how many ounces this cut is supposed to be. (I am missing my sirloin with the Outback being closed!)  Everything was prepared well and tasted good. Towards the end of the meal Steven came over to tell me that he was ""being sent home""(early) and introduce me to the next waiter that would take care of me, Josh. I could see the manager of the restaurant holding court across the aisle from me on a table with about 4 servers crowding around her. She seemed to hold up Josh for quite a while and then reminded him to come check all the customers he'd just acquired.  I'm glad that I could see that three-quarters of the meal had already happened when Steven left and I had grabbed a few bucks out of my purse to hand him some cash. All the cash I had was only $3 but I wanted him to not miss out on a tip. After that it took kind of a long time to get my iced tea refilled, get a to go container. and cash out my check. So one star deduction for manager drama and one star for the tiny steak. And please, if you're going to promote having an app that diners can sign in on, turn on the flipping internet."
