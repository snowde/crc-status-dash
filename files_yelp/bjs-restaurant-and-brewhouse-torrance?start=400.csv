Mitchell L.,"Millbrae, CA",61,26,102,2.0,7/9/2014,"Oh BJ's if you didn't have those always alluring and addicting pizookie's I swear I would never go back. This is just your typical American cuisine chain that really does not do anything that special, but rather just has a little bit of everything. Going to any American restaurant is a little hard considering that I tend to eat fairly healthy, except when it comes to pizookie's, so I do appreciate that they have a ""skinny"" menu. So I came with a huge group, 25, and luckily was able to get a reservation. We were seated immediately any had two main servers.  I skipped on the appetizers because there was nothing healthy that seemed appetizing really. For my entree I wen't for the mahi mahi which was listed at 420 calories. At 13 bucks I expected at the least a little pepper or salt, but this was literally the most bland piece of fish I have ever had. I had to ask for a the siracha and lots of it. The bed of rice and veggies that the fish sat atop of was bland as well except for the pineapple that it came with. This was literally 13 bucks of crap on a plate. Never again will I ever order this and neither should you! BJ's I would never come back if it not were for the pizookie's which are absolutely god sent. Then again it is pretty difficult to mess up a fresh baked cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely delicious, unlike the previous dish which was gross.  I know service can be difficult considering how busy BJ's normally is; I'm not exactly sure why to be honest. For twenty five people though we should be first priority considering you get the biggest freiking tip from us. We were only attended to when it came to getting our dishes, and any time after that we did not seem them once. What a shame, they deserved the most minimal tip, but of course with such a big party we didn't have a choice but to tip big.  Ambiance: 3/5 typical BJ's Food: 2/5 Should be a 1 if not for those delectable pizookie's Service: 1.5/5 Bus boys were around often enough. Overall: 2/5 Only come for dessert and go somewhere else for dinner."
Jenn B.,"Torrance, CA",4,10,3,1.0,6/26/2015,"My husband and I had such a bad experience here last week.  We are big Lazy Dog fans when we have our kids with us, but decided to give BJ's a try as we had a night out alone.  We were going to a movie at the mall after dinner, so we didn't have a lot of time.   It was a Monday evening and the place was moderately crowded.  The hostess showed us to a booth after only a minute or two.  Once we got to our booth, NO ONE acknowledged our presence!!  We sat there for 20 minutes and never had anyone EVER come to our table..no drink order, no ""I'll be right with you"".. No nothin'!!!  I have restaurant experience and my husband & I are probably the most easygoing people that you're ever going to wait on, so for us to get up and leave a restaurant is pretty bad..!   Not sure what happened here??  Maybe we got seated in a ""no mans land"" where the servers weren't sure who's table it was..??  Maybe our server was very busy..??  I honestly don't know?  But 20 minutes at a table with zero service or even acknowledgement is unacceptable...  Other employees walked by multiple times and looked at us, but offered no help.  We even tried to flag down a bus boy, but to no avail...  We told the hostess on our way out the door what had happened and her response was ""huh? Oh sorry..""    Not so sorry for us.. We went over to Lazy Dog, had fast, friendly service and a good meal AND made our movie on time!    Don't think we'll back to BJ's"
Joseph K.,"Gardena, CA",1,2,,1.0,4/6/2015,"Ordered  a buffalo chicken pizza for lunch and my pizza looked like it was overcooked and thrown together. No sauce and cheese  was burntI brought it back,Only for the manager to tell me that all pizzas here were made this way. I Will never return to this location again!!!"
Aileen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,57,28,1.0,2/22/2015,"After watching a movie my girlfriends and I decided that we were famished and decided to come eat at BJs. The reason for the 1 stars is for attitude and what I would say would be a health code violation of some sort regarding food. I am not a food professional so I could be wrong, but what I do possess is common sense. Our table received some of the avocado egg role which the server just plopped down and walked away without so much as a ""enjoy"", ""heres your food"" or even a ""kiss my ass"" would have sufficed. But no, we get just food put down and we tried to get his attention ""excuse me excuse me"" to no avail. So we waited while we looked around for our original server Katrina to come by so we could tell her that this was not our order. It took about 5 minutes to find someone, all the while the appetizer just sitting at our table. We finally saw our server and she realized it was not ours and basically took the appetizer and gave it to the right table which was next to ours. At this point I was completely appalled. I am not a food service professional nor have I ever worked in the food service industry BUT as a customer if I knew that my dish was sitting at someone else's table for longer than a minute and then transferred to my table you bet your sweet ass I would be completely livid. We did not touch the appetizer or do anything to it, but the fact that she was very nonchalant about it and didn't think twice to just move it over leads me to believe that this has happened more than once and the chances of all guests not touching what was put in front of them on accident are slim to none. She gave a dish that could have been tampered with to another table knowing full well it had been sitting at our table first. I am stilled appalled and when I told my other friends about it too, they were also appalled. I for one will not return to this particular BJs because who knows where my foods been since it was out from the kitchen. Not to mention the service sucks. I wouldn't go so far to say that our waitress was rude but you could tell she was having a bad day or maybe she just doesn't like her job but nonetheless service/friendliness NOT TO MENTION CLEANLINESS are issues that should be addressed.  The food itself is same o same o BJs food, good bang for your buck and thats about it. I personally think that no matter how good the food is, if the service and atmosphere are not up to par, people will look elsewhere."
Renee J.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",41,16,1,3.0,1/2/2015,The pazookis are always good! I love the atmosphere. The berry mojito is the best mojito I have ever had... and I've been to the Caribbean.  The entree food is decent. They don't take reservations for small parties so be ready for a wait.
Julius S.,"Los Angeles, CA",41,39,,3.0,3/3/2014,"Considering it was a Friday night, around 10 PM, in a popular chain restaurant, the bartender got to my orders quickly. There are a lot of TVs mounted on the front wall of the bar, and lots more around the entire restaurant, all of which are tuned to ESPN or some other sports channels. I guess BJ's is a sports bar. I drank their house stout, which was dark brown and clearly smelled of chocolate and caramel. I first tasted the chocolate and sweetness of the caramel, then I got a bit of the smoky malts, and it finishes off somewhat bitter. It's a medium-to-thick body beer. Stouts should be foamy, with no more than two fingers of head, and have good looking lace, but their brew didn't. So, it leads me to think that the glass I had wasn't that clean, or the hops they used weren't fresh, or both. It was a decent stout that I wouldn't hesitate to order again. 3 stars!"
Raymond A.,"Carson, CA",173,29,74,5.0,6/22/2014,"I love BJ's lol. This place is always packed everytime of the day which is probably my only dislike. I can't blame the people though because it's totally understandable. BJ's are awesome. I always get good service here. They seem to bring the food out in a timely manner every visit. waiters/waitresses are always checking on our party making sure we are ok or if we need anything. The Food is the best. I've ordered pizza, Parmesan crusted chicken or chicken Alfredo and OMG they are all good each and every time. The cheese sticks are my favorite appetizers. For dessert I always get the white chocolate macadamia Pazookie!!! I love BJ's & I hope u enjoys BJ's as much as I do lol"
Sydney K.,"Torrance, CA",133,11,2,1.0,3/9/2015,"This place gets worse & worse... Two situations: 1st I had called the day of to make reservations for 7:30 for a Friday night. No problem. We got there basically at 7:30 & ended up waiting A WHOLE HOUR to get a table. When we first arrived, the hostess told me they were waiting for a table to leave to seat us- they had their check already, so probably around 10-15 min. Sure, no problem. 20 minutes later I ask what's going on? Same answer... Okay, well since we had reservations shouldn't we just get the first available table?? 45 minutes later, same hostess said okay they were cleaning the table. Apparently it took 15 minutes to clean off a table & at that point we were so irritated & didn't even want to eat there. The manager was nice & explained the situation, but the hostess was cold & unaccommodating- didn't care we had waited an hour WITH reservations. There were other walk-in parties that day before we did! My whole point.. We had reservations to avoid waiting an hour for a table. 2nd my friends & I came in to grab a pizookie. We got seated immediately (it was a week night). We already know what kinds of pizookies there are & what we like so immediately we were ready to order. We had a waitress walk past us at least twice without any acknowledgement, helping the tables around us. 15 minutes pass with not even a simple ""what would you like to drink?"" Or ""I'll be right with you"" So we said forget it & left to Stacked across the way. This place is slowly losing my interest. The pizookies are delicious but not for the wait or the customer service."
Randall K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",108,109,27,4.0,7/23/2015,BJ's is always a good place to eat and drink. Happy Hour is ok for the most part. You know what you're gonna get when you go to BJ's.  Good Food at a good price. I'm always coming.  Place is packed typically at night.  Food: 3.5  Service: 4  Venue: 4  Clean: 5  Beer: 4
Yvonne B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,14,7,1.0,2/20/2016,"Ate here on 2/5/16, service was terrible. I am 36 years old and wasn't allowed to order a sangria at the bar. I had left my brand new drivers license at home by mistake, but had my old one on me. I showed it, it clearly verified my age. That's the only purpose of checking the ID and trusted at 36 there's no way I look under age in any way. When the waitress told me ""I can't take this"" with no further explanation my younger sister, who was with me insisted she check with the manager. This was even more upsetting. The manager, Scott Montero, refused to come over and speak with me. So I suppose that he looked at the 3 minorities at the table and assumed we'd be trouble, wussed-out and sent the waitress back to us without any reason just ""no."" From that time on I guess the waitress was scared or something, so she wouldn't come over to deliver any of our food, she sent someone else to bring our appetizers and to refill our water. Her service was terrible. But, but when it came time to pay they accepted my credit card. So a 2 month expired Driver's License is not acceptable to purchase a lousy sangria, the most light-weight drink on the menu, but it is ok for a credit card purchase. Because I'm obviously an under age criminal trying to score drinks at stupid BJ's in Torrance...(I hope you can detect the sarcasm) I don't curse but ""F"" you Scott Montero and both waitresses involved that day! You ridiculous, racial profiling, morons! That's how I feel. I will never eat at any BJ's ever again. And unless you're white you shouldn't eat there either."
Christy T.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,34,2,2.0,11/11/2015,"The wings are definitely great. But I ordered a medium cooked steak nd received a well done steak. I could barely cut through it. Idk if the waitress put it in wrong or the kitchen made the mistake. Also, I ordered a pomegranate martini expecting it to be good....it was horrible! The reason I asked for one was bc I had one the previous night at STACKED nd it was great! Expecting the same but was very disappointed."
Steven H.,"Fairview, OR",13,76,62,2.0,5/6/2014,"Second time coming to this restaurant. I enjoy the food and that is why I am giving it one more star than I was going to. There is always a wait of about 30 minutes or longer to get a table, even for two. Both times I have been sat in a booth (not a big deal) but when the booths are extremely small and your fat, it is hard to try and squeeze in there. I felt like I looked like a I had a mushroom top on the tabletop. The waiter Cory had finally come up after several minutes and just looked at me with a weird look which was more like ""how the heck did he get in that booth, he looks hideous!""  He took my order and was pretty curt. Whenever he would come he would give his weird look and would slam my food or drinks on the table. He wouldn't ask how things were and didn't say anything but put the stuff down on the corner and walk away. On my way back to the car I saw one of the waiters that had just walked out for his break at his car smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer. He saw me approaching and turned around to try and hide it but it was too late I already saw it. This is what any customer wants to know is that the staff are outside smoking and drinking on their breaks so they can take extra good care of me when they return. I really want to give this place a higher score...if it was just on the food I would give them four stars as it is pretty darn good. I especially like the Parmesan Chicken and the Low Fat menu. I hope that if I decide to return that I get better service. I also would like to try paying for my bill with my phone which I saw was an option."
Samantha C.,"Hawthorne, CA",169,28,25,5.0,8/12/2014,"This location always has very good service and it's in a nice location. Their food is so good.  OH, and they have Wi-Fi!   If you haven't yet, you MUST try the pizookies! Salted caramel pizookie is sooo good."
Betty V.,"Redondo Beach, CA",44,62,,5.0,8/27/2015,Counteracting all the negative reviews and offset the three stars. Great chain restaurant and service. The crispy chicken salad is addicting and the pizookies are always a favorite. I like the mobile app.
Pina R.,"Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/17/2015,"Horrible service. We had made a reservation here two weeks prior to coming for a group of 10. When we got there they could not find our reservation. Secondly, once we got seated, which was an hour later, the service couldn't be any worse. The bartender apparently took 20 minutes to make our drinks, which the waitress came over and complained about. The manager came over and spoke to us. We told him we were expecting better service. When they couldn't find our reservation they didn't even try to do anything about it: it took three times of telling them that we had a reservation in order to bring the manager out. Took forever to get our food and the bill. HORRIBLE SERVICE."
Joy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",38,27,15,5.0,7/16/2015,"Fun experience! Came in for happy hour to vent and loosen up, you can never go wrong with the strawberry mojitos! The kale and brussel sprout salad is the best, i usually put he dressing on the side bc the dish is flavorful in general. I always get my salad with blackened salmon. My server luis was great at suggesting pizzas and was attentive even after his 30 min break. He servess on the cocktail bar floor area, i strongly suggest him! Good times!!"
E J.,"Simi Valley, CA",659,92,12,3.0,7/10/2014,"Overall a great place to eat!!! Sooooo much to choice from., it took a while to decide I would recommend nice atmosphere!! I had the pulled pork which was good!!! Yum!  My daughter had the flatbread pizza which was alright!! The appetizer was the potstickers which were delish!!"
Shantal G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/18/2015,I was told that my order would take 15 minutes and it took almost thirty minutes and when I went to ask the waitress about my order she dismissed me telling me she had to go then I asked another young lady and she said someone else will help you and they have no manners they don't even say excuse me as they pass I don't understand I think I am more upset at the way the three first girls handled everything disappointed
Daina M.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",12,32,,1.0,4/20/2014,"We never eat here because we always get quoted a wait time of 30-40 mins but there was no waiting today and we were seated right away. After 5 minutes our waitress did a drive by and and said I'll be right with you. I asked her if see could bring use some water. After about 10 minutes she finally came back with water and to take our order. It 20 mins for our appetizer to come out and another 15mins after that for my food. A different server brought out my food but not my husbands food. My burger was over cooked, the salad on the plate was hot so who knows how long it sat under the heat lamp and onion straw were cold and greasy. We finally saw our waitress like 5 minutes later and asked her to correct the problem and if my husbands food was coming out as  well. After correcting the issues I has 3 small plates in front of me. When we were trying to get our check we never found her, we had to ask someone else to track her down.  If that's the kind of service you get on a slow day I hate to see the service you get when their busy..."
Katrina D.,"Torrance, CA",245,40,46,4.0,7/19/2015,"First thing worth mentioning: OUR SERVER STEPHAN. He was the most pleasant, attentive, knowledgeable and amazing server I have had at a restaurant in a long time.  He made excellent beer selection suggestions and always kept us updated on how our orders were progressing.  This made the wait for the food seem like nothing. The beers were great (I had an Amber Oasis and the rest of the table ordered Jeremiah Reds).  A pint was about $5.75 for most beers, but they also offered pitchers.   The food itself was average, nothing too spectacular.  We started with calamari for an appetizer, and it was JUST enough for 2 people.  I definitely wouldn't recommend just one order for a larger party.  For the main course I ordered a 9"" ""sweet pig"" deep dish pizza.  The crust was excellent, not too saucy, and good amount of toppings.  HOWEVER, the price was ridiculous coming in at over $10.  Another person ordered the salmon, and it seemed pretty average.  The vegetables looked like the kind you buy frozen and then steam, the salmon was grilled (but nothing significant), and the price was your average Uncle Ben's rice. We finished with a pizookie which never disappoints, but again, not really shareable beyond 2 people. Overall, for a calamari appetizer, two small pizzas, three beers, a salmon dinner and a pizookie the bill came out to $90.  I'm deducting one star because for $100, I feel like the food quality and portions could've been a lot better.   The only reason I'd probably come back is for Happy Hour or something where the food is cheaper."
