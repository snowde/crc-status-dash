Kristin J.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/13/2015,"Placed an order for take out tonight and I've never experienced such horrible service for something as simple as bringing a meal out to a car. The person who took our order told us it would take about 15 minutes for our food to be ready and gave us the option to pick it up inside the restaurant or have it delivered to our car. We obviously chose to have the food delivered to our car. When we arrived we called the restaurant to let them know we were there and the host transferred us to the take out line where we were put on hold for at least 10 minutes. At this point, I had my boyfriend just go inside to get our order where he waited another 10 minutes for their staff to figure out where our order was. By the time we got our food, everything was completely cold and and soggy. Not to mention, they didn't even get our order right and gave us the wrong burgers! We settled and just ate the food because it probably would've taken another 20 minutes for them to get our food order right.  The burger was bland, but I will say the spaghetti and Santa Fe salad were tasty. I do not advise ordering take out from BJs...you're better off eating inside the restaurant. Hopefully the servers there are able to provide better service. Very disappointing BJs!"

Not coming again.  The only thing that saves it is the pizookie. edit not even the pizookie. If I could do no stars I would"
Ciara G.,"Frenchtown, NJ",187,1212,7583,4.0,11/12/2009,"I am not one to review chain restaurants but I felt the need since RL and I had a really good dining experience here the other night.  I enjoy BJ's and have always had good food here. Service is usually hit or miss. On this occassion, service was on (Thank you Maureen). The MOD David also stopped by while doing his rounds and chatted with us a bit and he was great as well. Was also tempted to leave both of them my business card to come visit my cafe but I was all out. ): Next time! (; Tonight we dined on our usual BJ's order. Chicken Wings (crispy and spicy). I love how they drizzle the wings with sauce and ranch instead of drenching them. It's a nice touch because I really enjoy the crisp on buffalo wings and here you get it bc they are not slopped up in sauce. We also tried their new Southwestern Pizza which was spicy and tasty. Their seasonal Pumpkin Beer was good and we passed on the poozokie since we had Susie Cakes waiting for us in the car. Will be back and will hopefully remember to ask for Maureen."
joe j.,"Torrance, CA",32,170,17,3.0,12/6/2013,"Four star food, four star service, 0 stars hostess staff. Long waits, unorganized management getting a table. Great desserts, great meals."
Breana C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,23,12,3.0,9/30/2014,"Came here for late night happy hour. My boyfriend and I sat in the bar area. Took a while to get helped. Once helped ordered our drinks. Had a good night overall, but I felt like our waiter wanted us to leave. Once we signed our receipt, she came and said thanks bye! We didn't even leave the table yet, as if she was kicking us out. Shouldn't they wait to the customers leave the table to pick up their tip? Just saying."
Geoff H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",81,78,,4.0,6/18/2014,"I really like BJ's. It's usually quite crowded in here, which to me is the main downside to coming here. I never have a problem with the food- I think it's very good. I enjoy the pizza here, and while I realize that true Chicago natives will roll their eyes at their ""deep-dish,"" I still think it's quite good. The toppings are fresh and plentiful. I really like the touch of roasted tomato on top, and I actually don't even like tomatoes. I think the crust is nice and soft with good thickness and crunch along the edges. Come at happy hour and the mini-sized ones are at a really reasonable price. I also quite enjoy the beer selection here. Their house brews are all good, and I think their red is a nice one with a good but not too harsh bite to it.  For an American chain restaurant offering a variety of cuisines, I think BJ's does a very good job. If you haven't been here, it's worth a try! Minus one star for being on the pricey side, but happy hour is always a good option to save a few bucks!"
Ian S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",40,365,142,3.0,9/21/2012,"I don't think I've ever gone to a BJ's where I didn't think the food was good, but thought the service was super quick. I had a mini pizza, watermelon salad, and okterberfest beer. All were really tasty. I never would have thought that watermelon and salad could be meshed together but I was pleasantly surprised. Our server was super friendly, but forgot our appetizer, and by the time dinner came out we didn't even bother asking for it. Lengthy space in between visits. I'll probably end up back there again, but it's definitely only for the food. The service isn't the draw."
Sean T.,"Gardena, CA",28,29,68,3.0,8/23/2015,"The only deep dish pizza near Del Amo mall. Food was okay but service was below average. After getting our food served they never come back, when they do, it's to give you the check. Tried to use that opportunity to get refill on drink and menu again for dessert but the server stormed away so fast. Probably better driving little bit further for deep dish pizza."
Amara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,266,432,3.0,11/8/2013,"I came here for LEGIT ""deep dish Chicago style"" pizza. I don't think that's what this place offers. Their pizza consists of bread which essentially makes it ""deep dish"". I want more sauce..more ingredients! Actual DEEP DISH filled with something other than bread! I admit...their menu is decent and the vibe is alright. Their craft beers are pretty tasty and not toooooooooooo pricy. Not my  ""go to"" pizza spot but their other choices are decent. I heard their happy hour is good too..but I've personally never been.  Service is alright. Nothing special."
Helen S.,"Gardena, CA",142,19,,4.0,7/1/2015,"I just have to rave about my favorite dish at BJ's, which is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken! They have the best Parmesan Crusted Chicken then any other place and this is the only thing I order whenever I go there. It comes with two tender and moist breaded chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, and broccoli florets. I could eat this every day if it was up to me. :) For dessert to save on the calories, their Mini Chocolate Chunk Pizookie is my favorite! Mmm, a warm, home-baked chocolate chip cookie with one scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The mini is the perfect size and more than enough to satisfy your sweet tooth craving if you want dessert and don't want to feel too guilty about eating it. :)"
Francisco M.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,3,1.0,3/13/2015,"Worst experience at a BJS by far. Came in with my siblings and our waitress looked mad from the start. Our waitress  attended us twice, too get our drinks, and bring the check, that's it. She didn't offer refills on our drinks once. The food runner who brought out the food did it all for us. The crispy fries tasted like they had been fried in the same fryer as fish and they smelled terrible. Offered a fresh batch of fries but was disgusted from the first, so we declined. The food itself was mediocre. Won't be coming back."
Lisa L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,54,116,3.0,2/11/2014,"The service is good.  The food is also good to great depending on what you order.  Their flat bread pizza was actually very delicious.  The wait time is average for a busy place, 20 to 30 min.  My only complaint is really THE FLOOR!!!!! I am shocked more people have not fallen! I have been to BJ's a few times, and in different shoes, it didn't matter.  The floor feels like your walking on ice. The first time I went I wore flats, and fell trying to walk to the restroom to change my then 6 month old son, thankfully he was not hurt.  The other bad part was that the customers seemed to run to my rescue before any of the staff even looked my way.   Anyway, the place is ok, but Id never wear heels there!"
Jonah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,10/20/2013,"I experienced what may possibly be the worst service I've EVER had at any restaurant I've ever been to at this location.  I had a party of four, in the evening.  We started with a waitress, who I unfortunately cannot remember her name (she was just fine, and in fact a pleasure).  We ordered five drinks, three beers, one liquor drink, and a sparkling lemonade.  I also asked if it would be possible to change one of the six televisions from a football game to a baseball game (Game 6 of the American League Championship series, Red Sox v. Tigers, an important game and one that honestly should have been on a tv already.)  About fifteen minutes after ordering our drinks, we placed our food order (two hamburgers, a steak, and a pizza).  At this time, our waitress informed us that she would be leaving for the evening, and we would be waited on by a young man named Obini.  Our waitress also told me that she had spoken to the manager, and they would be putting the baseball game on the tv presently.   This is where our visit suddenly took a sharp turn for the worst.  We waited another fifteen to twenty minutes before our first drinks arrived at our table.  Obini passed around the drinks, and when he came to me, he sat down my beer, and when I told him that the liquor drink was also mine, he seemed incredulous, and almost refused to give it to me (bearing in mind that it is not an uncommon practice for a grown man to order a beer and a liquor drink with dinner, especially in a bar type setting.)  The baseball game was still not on the television. About ten minutes later, our food was brought to our table, however one of our hamburgers had not even been put in to the kitchen.  Obini said ""That's not MY fault."" and left the table.  At least five minutes passed before he returned and said that he had placed the order in the kitchen.  The baseball game was still not on the television. At this point, my friend ordered a second beer.  At no point did Obini ask if anyone else at the table would like another drink, or a refill on the lemonade (at no point throughout the entire meal did he refill the lemonade.) About ten minutes later, the second hamburger came out, and no sort of apology was offered for it being later (I understand that it might not have been anyones fault, however this is a service industry and a simple apology can go a LONG way).  The baseball game was still not on the television. After finishing our meal, my friend ordered a third beer, at which time Obini said to him ""Are you driving? because you've already had four or five.""  In an incredibly condescending way.  I had also ordered a second beer (in addition to my liquor drink), and another in our group had ordered three drinks, as well.  The fourth member of our group had not ordered ANY alcohol at all, yet nobody else was subjected to his questioning.  Frankly, it was embarassing, especially considering Obini's protests were louder than anyone at our table.  The baseball game was still not on the television. I then asked to see a dessert menu, and Obini left for an inordinate amount of time before returning to take our dessert order.  One person in my group ordered her dessert, and then he walked away, and we had to shout after him to return and take the other THREE dessert orders. There was also a party of young men and women across from us, and I witnessed Obini not only TOUCH one of the UNDERAGE girls on her bare shoulder, but also stand so uncomfortably close to another that she physically moved away from him. He was RUDE, off putting, embarassing, and uppitty, and he alone made our experience so awful that it put a damper on my entire weekend.  I have never in my life seen any waitstaff so ill trained, and with so few manners working in an establishment that I otherwise frequent and enjoy.  And I missed the entire baseball game. UPDATE: I spoke with Scott montero, who is the general manager of this BJ's. He apologized and told me that he would send me a gift card, and to come back in and have another meal. One month passed and I had yet to receive any gift card from him. I sent an email and confirmed that he had my address correct.  Scott montero then told me that he would send the gift cards within the week (this is a month after he told me he had already sent them). Almost another full month later, I still have yet to receive them.  It goes without saying that I won't be returning to this restaurant, even if Scott montero were to actually send me a gift card."
Jayde A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,4/4/2015,"This place is always great, but what made it especially nice tonight was our server STEFAN!!! We were celebrating a birthday with a party of 8, and he was so nice the whole time even though i know it can be stressful. (I work at a restaurant too lol) He made us laugh, and was a very kind-hearted person. Even though it was very busy he made us feel like when we asked him for something it wasn't a huge hassle!"
Karli G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",53,79,273,4.0,12/17/2013,"Love this place for lunch.  They have great lunch specials that start at just $5.95.  I love the chicken sandwiches, turkey sandwiches, chicken tacos, BBQ chicken pizza and salads.  I really love the chicken tacos, such great flavor.  You get three for $5.95 with beans on the side.  The Pazooki's are great! They are a warm cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  AMAZING!!"
Angela M.,"Torrance, CA",189,30,,1.0,1/11/2014,"If their service wasn't so incredibly craptastic this place would have a solid 4 stars because the menu is actually quite extensive and the food is good. However, every time I've been to this location, I've been greeted with the worst customer service. This latest time was my tipping point.  When we sat down, our waitress was friendly enough. When we declined drinks and appetizers a switch flipped and she was less than stellar. Our food took twice as long as normal in a literally empty restaurant. It was 11am on a Monday.  Never again."
Eliza A.,"Gardena, CA",1,27,4,5.0,7/16/2015,I love the Cajun pasta its my favorite and their pazooki are to die for ...I love this place .....its pricey but worth it
Joyce D.,"Costa Mesa, CA",198,426,846,3.0,7/8/2012,"P-I-Z-O-O-K-I-E!  The food here is really good! I love their appetizers, especially the avocado egg rolls! Yummy! Came here during happy hour and this place is busy! We got the Sweet Pig deep dish pizza minus the tomato sauce, (my friend dislikes tomatoes) and it still tasted pretty good! The drinks the ladies got were the pomegranate margarita (so good!), strawberry margarita (yummy!) and of course, the classic margarita (delicious!). I don't remember the beers the guys got, but they all looked very refreshing! I want to try the beer sample one day... Anyway, the atmosphere is pretty cool and similar to cheesecake factory minus the cheesecake, but that is okay because they have pizookies!!! If it is your birthday, you get a free pizookie! Basically, it is a giant freshly baked cookie that comes with ice cream! It is so delicious! Good customer service! Our waitress checked on us at a very timely manner and was not too overbearing or hovering. If you come here, make sure to get a pizookie!"
Shanice W.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,19,32,1.0,6/4/2015,"Some friends and I went here around 10:45 at night. We weren't greeted by a host/hostess and we waited at the station for at least 4 minutes. Already off to a bad start. Employees proceeded to walk past and smile at us, basically acknowledged that we were there and said nothing about someone coming to seat us. Strike two. Finally, a hostess comes and seats us and gives us a table instead of a booth when there were a clear row of comfortable booths available. Strike three. We order and as we're eating, my friend finds a hair in his food. Strike four. Never returning to this location. Ever."
Vivi C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,3,5.0,8/10/2015,Awsome server. Wendy is amazing super sweet funny and all around a great person. The food was amazing drinks were great.  Had a great time would go back again forsure.
