Lexi S.,"Valencia, CA",0,9,93,2.0,4/26/2016,"I have been a trusting customer of Bjs for over 10 years. Each location has provided me with acceptable service, excellent food, and I haven't had many complaints all in all. However, I'm disappointed with the Bjs rewards points. At this location I did not receive my rewards. I followed up with a call the next day, and spoke with a manager. He told me that the points were pending and he wouldn't be able to help me on his end. I called back the next day, I spoke with another manager. She told me to add the points myself, while on the phone I explained that I can not. I tried a fourth time while still on the phone through the website, and the app. She took down my name and number to see if it went through or was still pending on her end. Normally I receive  an email hours after my purchase, stating my points went on my card. She did not return my call, I still have not received my points. I'm extremely displeased, my check was over $100. Beware you may not have your points out on your card, or have a manager take notice, or return a follow up call. Won't be returning to this location."
Hayley M.,"Torrance, CA",2,22,5,4.0,9/11/2015,"I came here on a Friday night, even though the place was busy we waited 20 minutes- not bad. Our waiter, I think his name was Joe was excellent. He delivered all our requests and I didn't even need to ask him for refills. The food isn't amazing but it's pretty good; above average. You'll probably leave here feeling stuffed especially if you eat a pizookie after your lunch or dinner."
Wendy B.,"Carson, CA",1,16,,2.0,8/12/2016,"Every time i come here to eat there is always something wrong. I dont know why but i always get a bad server, you might ask why i keep coming here?!? The food is good its always the server that sucks! This last time i came in to have dinner with my boyfriend the girl that served is was a total disaster. She was rude. Like she was on a rush. While we were looking at the menu she asked the usual question ""can i get you something to drink?"" We were looking at the menu so we waited a few seconds to reply when she said ""you want something? Yes, no, maybe?"" What a horrible way! After that she kept on making noise when removing plates or bringing food. She was totally rude and disrespectful! She would always come around with her long face and  being totally rude! That is not a way to treat a customer. I am 200% sure i wont be coming back here! Horrible service Tequila! (I think thats how you spell her name) too pissed to even try to remember how to write it."
Glenn S.,"Hawthorne, CA",21,10,,1.0,2/16/2015,"Worst BJ's we've been to. Hostess in the front were very rude and had no manners. After a hour wait they took us along with another party to the same table. They girl that escorted us just said ""oh"" and left us. After we got seated the waitress took our drink order we got the drink my mom asked for sugar for her tea. We end up asking 4 times for sugar before it was brought. When the food came the pizza and french fries were cold. Club Sanwhich bread was burned. My dads pork chops were so over cooked that he could barely chew it.  They got alot to fix before we come back."
Kathy W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",213,545,113,5.0,7/28/2013,"I don't go to BJ's too often but we had a party of 20+ the other night and our waiter, Benny, was awesome....he memorized every order w/o writing anything down and gave us all separate checks!  He rocked!  I enjoyed my mushroom pizza and my dining companions were quite happy with their choices, ranging from the Cobb salad to the pulled pork sandwich and more."
Laizelle F.,"Daly City, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/25/2015,"-First of all they didn't even bring us utensils and napkins, we had to ask for it. -they didn't ask ""if we wanted anything else"" or if we were ok -if we didn't ask the waitor for how long our food would've arrived, it would've taken another 15 min. Like bruhhh"
Cara C.,"Los Angeles, CA",497,379,18,4.0,8/9/2013,"They serve brunch on the weekends 10-1...yes, they have breakfast pizza. In case you were wondering.  I was quite thrilled that their brunch is pretty good!  I had the french toast and wasn't expecting much from a pizza place, but it was pretty darn good.  It was under $10 which is a fair price for a meal at BJ's, I think.   I also had their stout beer.  It goes pretty well with french toast. Who knew? The place is massive so there was no wait, which is also good for a BJ's.  Service was good too."
Evan F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",18,362,113,3.0,3/6/2014,"Ate there three times. I thought the food was okay and the service incredibly slow. Last time after eating and declining dessert it seemed like an eternity until the bill came. I'll go again but the place is low on my ""must of to"" list."
Chelsea L.,"San Pedro, CA",0,10,,1.0,10/31/2016,"I've never had a bad experience at this BJ's ever, until yesterday. My boyfriend & I were told it will be a 15 minute wait for a table so we waited. When the time came, we head to be seated until the lady seating us, told us to stop because our table wasn't ready because it was still dirty, she then just headed to the front as if nothing happened. The lady just left us mid aisle with no instructions except for ""stop"" so what were we suppose to do when our table was still dirty & we were just standing there? My feet were killing me from shopping all day so I sat down. We waited a good 10 minutes at the dirty table until the manager noticed all the dishes to the side and it was just my boyfriend & I talking. She then got a bit mad and asked us what happened. As we tried to explain our story, she said to point out the lady who seated us so she can tell her what she did wrong and how she could fix it. We looked after the manager left as she approached the lady who had seated us and she acted as if she did not know what we were taking about. As if we seated ourselves. Let me remind you I waited that 15 minutes to be seated! The manager then came back & asked if we seated ourselves but we tried explaining the lady just left us with a dirty table. The manager YET did not really believe us and told us it was ""okay if you seated yourself"" but we DID NOT. I was so disappointed at how the lady acted as if she did not even know who we were and how she ""did not"" seat us. I was left speechless. Later, our waiter brought us our drinks which were the wrong ones but we did not say anything. He later went home & introduced us to a new waiter who then forgot to put our discount TWICE on our check. I still am so speechless at what happened yesterday because I love this Bj's and I don't want to have a reason to hate it."
Kimberly V.,"Carson, CA",173,75,18,1.0,11/7/2014,Can I give this place one star?!!! Seriously over an hour to get out food. No apology no nothing. Worst service ever.
Lina F.,"Lakewood, CA",1152,447,1258,5.0,6/28/2013,"We went to the BJ's at the Del Amo Mall and it was great.  Joe was our waiter and this dude was outstanding.  He always checked on us, not overbearing but good and we were sending him back and forth for one thing or another.  He was cool though, didn't seem to get irritated.  The food was great, I had a bowl of meaty Clam Chowder, Basil and Italian Sausage Flatbread and they hit the spot.  My niece and nephew had the Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and Garlic Cheese Toast and the little monsters tore it up.  Mikey ordered another round of noodles so they must've done something right because he's the pickyiest boy I know.  I had their house brewed Cream Soda and it was kinda sa-weet as in ""too sugary"" but then again, aren't they all? Enjoyed the evening with the rugrats though.  Oh, and we took a Pazooki Chocolate Chip with Ice Cream on the side for the kids to eat at home.  It was late too so I sugared the kids up and dropped them home.  They were probably bouncing off the walls.  Why does that make me smile, lol... bad girl.."
Jonathan W.,"Torrance, CA",16,11,2,2.0,1/15/2014,"Went here with my party of 9 for a company Christmas Dinner.  In the end, we left with an overwhelming mehhhhhhhhhhhhh.... When we arrived, we were seated within 15 minutes, which was great considering our party of 9.  We all ordered drinks, and they arrived very promptly and was very delicious.  That is where the great service ended. It took 20 minutes after we received our drinks for the waitress to take our order.  Took another 15-20 minutes for our appetizers to come out on the table.  After appetizers, it took 30 minutes for our entrees to come out.  Food was alright, some food was cold for some.  Biggest mistake of the night was that my boss, who was paying the bill and giving tip i must say, never received her steak.  After ANOTHER 20 minutes trying to flag down a waiter, I went to the front and asked what happened to her steak.  As per norm, another 15-20 minutes passed before the manager came and apologized for forgetting her food.  He offered to bring it in comped, but everyone was already done eating.  Boss took it to go anyway. From my point of view, the drinks were great.  The bartender mixed a great drink, and it came out fast.  However, between the mediocre food and the extremely long wait times (almost 2 hours from seating till we left), I would never eat at the resturant part of the brewhouse again."
Arturo H.,"Inglewood, CA",177,3,,2.0,10/19/2015,"Stopped in to BJ's today for lunch for 2 and was very disappointed. Greeted and seated right away by the host and then waited about 10-15min before the server came over only to let us know he will be another min and apologized for the wait. Not a big deal but, not a great start. We were very hungry so we put in our full order right away. Ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to start, burger(medium rare) & fries and the salmon & quinoa bowl. We never got the dip which we didn't even realize at first since we were happy to finally eat. The salmon and quinoa bowl was delicious and we had no problem with that. My fries were stale and cold and my burger meat looked like meat pudding. I love my burgers a little bloody but def not raw. Our server Eric quickly brought us new fries and apologized for not getting the dip in. He offered a complimentary dessert but, I already felt an upset stomach from the burger. This has been one of my favorite restaurants but today really made me want to stay away for a while."
Rachel B.,"Chicago, IL",31,14,18,2.0,1/4/2014,"I have been to this BJs maybe 3 times since it had opened. First time 21st birthday, second with a group, and most recently with a friend.  We get there and it's friday so I expect a long wait, all of the del amo area is busy least 30-40 min. They us the wait is just that. So we wait. and wait. We get to about 50 min and I am agitated. I can see from where I am standing the list and my name is next so I don't say anything. I see the host and they tell their waiter that I have been waiting for over 45 min, when the wait is 30-40. The next name is called and it's someone who got here after me. Right as I am about to go up to talk we get called. We sit down and my friend and I already know what we want. She orders California Burger, but with sauce on the side, as well as a cup of ranch dressing. I get the brew burger and a strawberry splash.  we get drinks first. for 9.25, don't get the strawberry splash. it taste like a Piña Colada with soap and strawberry puree.   then our food comes. They bring my friends burger, its covered in sauce and no ranch or avocado that comes with it. Then when she bit into the burger it was a bit cold and the sauce she had asked not to be on it was disgusting.  my food was fine.  so I don't think I will be going back to this one for quite some time. If the waiter hadn't taken her food off the bill I probably would have given it a one. The staff is very unresponsive and sometimes rude for simple questions. I was extremely disappointed."
Ebony P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,38,6,3.0,12/29/2013,"I like BJ's restaurant as an overall restaurant. Great selection of drinks and even bigger selection of beers. I like the Wildberry Mojito, it's my favorite. They have a very extensive menu and can be a bit overwhelming if this is your first time here. They have a great selection of appetizers, I highly recommend the wings, its covered in a spicy sauce and drizzled in a little sour cream.      Good quality pizzas, excellent tasting pastas. My two favorite dishes are the Jambalaya and the Creole Tilapia. The pizzokie is probably the best thing on the menu. I always get the white macadamia.        Went here a few days ago with my sister. It wan't busy and we were seated right away. Service was very slow and our waiter was not very attentive. Overall my sister and I were there for over two hours and our waiter only came to take our orders and give us our checks."
Allison C.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",3,35,47,3.0,4/5/2014,"Have been here about 5 times. Not a big pizza fan so I can't comment on that menu item. Used to like the beef dip sandwich here but they're starting to skimp on the beef and trying to compensate by giving more fries. Sorry BJ's, but I'm paying for Beef not bread and potatoes. This last visit I had the beer-battered fish and chips; it was yummy -- very crisp and flavorful and enough to satisfy my hunger. The wait for dinner was 30 minutes --about what I expected -- and our server was attentive and polite.  I will definitely come here again because it's close to home, but I wish the food quality and quantity would be more consistent. Oh, they also need to be more observant about spills under the tables and on the floor. My daughter accidentally dropped her scarf under the table and when she retrieved it, the scarf was soaking wet."
Ryan E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,92,,3.0,4/21/2014,"Came here for a work lunch. The restaurant was nice with large TV's showing sporting events. Unfortunately, we had to go back to work after, because there was about 3 pages of the menu devoted to drinks. I had the California chicken sandwich with a house salad and fries (lunch special). It was pretty good. I also had a coffee which was surprisingly decent. My co-workers told me they are known for their deep dish pizzas but that is not my favorite kind of pizza. For dessert we shared Pizookies (pizza/cookie) which were pretty good, a little sweet for me. Overall: decent."
John A.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,20,12,5.0,11/14/2014,First time here!! Pretty crowded on a Friday...but the drinks are flowing...after a 10 hour shift...it's much needed!! Staff is awesome..I encourage any and everyone to come here..cheers!!!
Kim G.,"Long Beach, CA",26,105,14,1.0,2/24/2016,"Do you like to get your food and drinks? If you do, don't bother checking in here! First, this is a zero rating if I had my way. We went to meet a small group of friends and had reservation! They knew we were coming. Our server had our table and two small tables behind us. Not across the restaurant and the three tables combined would have been the same as having four regular ones. Our waiter liked to disappear. We HD to stop other staff to ask for things. One friend ordered a beer. It is a brewery,  he never got it. No apology. My husband ordered a small pizza for dinner. Everyone at the table got their food and we were half way through eating before our waiter decided to show up and didn't even notice he had no food. My husband had to ask him for it. I ate my entire dinner with no drink. Then when we ordered dessert my order never came. When our waiter finally came back everyone was done so we told him to take it off the bill...he mumbled and walked away...rude.  Funny how he didn't forget to charge us for it. Still no apology. Then ten minutes later they come out with my dessert and when we told the runner we didn't want it, it was too late, he was rude and walked away. Not worth it! I can spend my hard earned money in a place that wants my business and values their customers!  Enter at your own risk!"
May T.,"Torrance, CA",23,43,48,3.0,7/9/2012,Food is not bad. I ordered one of their healthy plates- grilled chicken with rice and zucchini. It wasn't bad at all. My daughter ordered shrimp scampi because we both love angel hair pasta and it was good. What we all loved was the red velvet pizookie!!! It was sooooo good! The kids attacked it even though they said they were full. They were scraping the bottom of that cookie pan! Service was kind of slow but she was very friendly.
