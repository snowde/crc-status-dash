Johnny P.,"Prince George County, VA",0,20,7,1.0,7/10/2015,I asked to be seated in a different area since it was not busy and I got rude service from a young black host. To top it off I got my food with the French fries cold took a bite into my burger and found a long black hair in my burger. Very disgusted not only was the service horrible but then the waitress tried charging me for the burger after the manager had waived the price. Can't believe this I always come to this location but this will be my last time. I'd recommend going to lazy dog cafe or stacked.
Lani I.,"Torrance, CA",160,17,16,4.0,3/27/2014,Always have great service whenever i come here with family & friends.  My all-time favorite plate to get here is their Parmesan Crusted Chicken OMYGOSH *drool... Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! It's super delicious with their side of mashed potatoes and broccoli!!! If you haven't tried it yet and you love MOIST CHICKEN with crusted CHEESE all over and bomb mash potatoes ORDER IT!! Oh and of course their pazookie hahaha
Cheryl S.,"Anaheim, CA",116,24,,5.0,4/9/2015,"Our server, Joe, was awesome!  He used our names every time he checked on us (which was frequently), smiled and was very professional.  Next time we come back, we will request for Joe!"
Jamie W.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,7,1,1.0,4/28/2014,"My boyfriend and I usually go to Bjs for happy hour but today we had an awful experience thanks to the god awful manger.  My bf missed placed his ID so he brought his military ID to show he was 21. Once he handed our waitress the ID she gave him a rude look and told him she had to run it by the manger, she was gone with his ID for 15-20 minutes finally the manger comes to our table refusing to serve him alcohol because the ID wasn't in there system. (I have no idea what that means because he wouldn't explain it to us) we were completely appalled on the way the manager treated us we left and went to stacked and had a great time!"
VeraChris N.,"Norwalk, CA",522,290,6670,4.0,3/30/2013,"What's not to love about BJ's???  Haha... BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse, that is!!! This is a usual and popular spot for our rep-sponsored happy hours after work.  Aside from all the giggles and smirks that come about when all my nurse friends say ""I love BJ's"", I can honestly say that we always have a great time and a great meal when we go here.  Drinks and appetizers are what we get... The perfectly breaded fried calamari, spinach and artichoke dip with the warm and thin-crispy chips, the Italian-twist Ahi poke, and the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps and the avocado egg rolls that *everybody* loves... It's great eats, all of it!!! Flatbread pizzas are a must, too!!! We have some fans of the goat cheese flatbread, and the Margherita flatbread disappears as soon as it hits the table!  The potato skin deals need to be eaten right away or the potato itself gets kinda tough to eat as it gets cold...   And the drinks!!! The Jeremiah Red is a favorite for the guys, as well as the Piranha. One of these times I'm gonna skip the cocktails and try one of the brews... There's the Brewhouse Blonde that I'd like to try. I tried the Coconut Mojito last night and it was delicious!!! Two of my girlfriends ordered this Spring-special cocktail and they enjoyed it, as well! Last night was definitely a Mojito night for the ladies.... Strawberry, white peach, pomegranate... One time we went we tried up all of the Martinis. Pomegranate was my favorite, and the lemon drop was an all around favorite.  Yes, this place gets mad crazy and packed, especially after 5pm. If you have a big party (10 or more) definitely make reservations ahead of time to secure a spot for your party! Last night was a last minute deal for all of us, but the staff did their best to accommodate us and we were able to get one of the patios and enjoy our time there before our 9:30pm cut off time (another party had reservations then...) Our other times there, arrangements were made ahead of time and our wait to clear tables and get everything situated wasn't very long. Oh, and there are plenty of heaters to keep you comfortably warm when out on the patios. We seem to always have great service when we're there, so I have no complaints with that... I can usually get a good parking spot in the lot in front of the restaurant, on the Carson side. Honestly, it's the only place I know to park where I won't get lost or confused when it comes time to leave, lol... Yah, that happens sometimes..."
Nicole S.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,49,36,1.0,3/3/2016,"Came here last Saturday and had the absolute worst restaurant experience. I had a movie to catch later that night so we got here about 2.5 hours early. There were lots of restaurant to choose from but I decided to go to bjs because I had only been once before for a work party and wanted to give it a shot. We were quoted a 25 min wait time and I guess they just call out your name which is a very stupid system, anyways 25 mins goes by and we check in with the hostess who then tells us it's actually going to be an additional 25-30mins. It was annoying but I know that kind of thing can happen so we waited and finally got shown to our table where our server stops by to tell us she will be with us shortly. About 5 mins goes by and she comes back to first check in with her other tables and offer desserts before even taking our drink order. After she finished with everyone else she finally came by to take our order. The salad I ordered came out before our 2 waters did which is ridiculous. After I finish my salad the drinks then come out and then our food. My bf got the chicken club sandwich and I tried a bite. In that one bite I got something that may have been a chicken bone stuck in the roof on my mouth causing it to bleed and it was really painful and hard to get out. At this point I'm pissed but decide to not say anything to management because I was in a rush and just didn't want to deal with it. Jasmine then took over while our server was on break and I really appreciated her sincerity on how slow the service was that night, she was really sweet and at least explained to us that things were running a little bit behind that night without us even complaining or anything. By the time we needed our check our server seemed really busy so we asked another server who told us he couldn't help us and to ask our server to get it... I then saw the manager and called him over for our check. He was nice but didn't ask how everything was or anything which I feel like is a managers responsibility. All around a terrible experience. No teamwork in the restaurant, felt like we were the last priority, got hurt, and had a terrible time. Complete waste of money coming here. Very unprofessional on all parts. Will not be eating here again."
Andy L.,"Long Beach, CA",58,4,4,2.0,8/28/2014,"The margaritas fresca flat bread pizza is great. But the service was horrible. Waited for our drinks to come for some time. Also the waitress brought our straws with no covers holding them in her bare hands that MAY NO BE SANITIZE!! Once done with our meal, we asked for the check which took some what about 15 min to come. The another 15 for her to pick up. A check that was $40. Plus she never asked if we would a refill to our drinks or boxes for what was not finishes. And most important no deserts was offered... Watch out for waitress TIFFANY M."
Jamie S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",269,87,60,4.0,8/7/2013,Reasons why I would come back to BJ's: Pizookies Beers Pizzas (and happy hour) That is all.
Thomas K.,"Gardena, CA",229,398,2278,3.0,12/19/2013,Located in Del Amo Mall next to other restaurants. The parking is really terrible and lots of punk ass kids hanging out on the weekends. The service is pretty good but my complaint is this place is pretty dark and they have too many people blocking the entrance waiting to be seated during rush hour times.. They need to incorporate a pager system to keep the entrance close. The food was terrible. I did not like their pizza or their Jumbalya or the desert. A bit pricey for what you get. My favorite is the have good waiters and waitresses.
Siedah D.,"Long Beach, CA",119,10,1,1.0,3/12/2016,this place sucks I'm never coming again service was a 2 star being that my waitor was rushing like no other litterally almost falling and tripping bc he's running to each of his tables like its a marathon.Random waiters a total of 5 came to our tables with the wrong meals  after a while we just had to laugh at the bad service and just go for appetizers! it was the worst bjs in the entire world.
David S.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/17/2015,"I have celiacs and have gone to other BJ's locations for their Gluten Free Beer and Pizza.  I went to the one in Torrance with my family and ordered the pizza.  Within a short period of time, it was obvious to me that there was gluten in the pizza and more than a little bit.  I had not had such a strong reaction in a very long time, in fact the symptoms lingered on for nearly a week. I was not impressed with the level of service.  The service was slow and we were missing some items from our order.  The biggest issue was the gluten in the ""gluten free"" pizza.  I suspect that someone in the kitchen was acting very sloppy.  My recommendation to with anyone with Celiacs is to avoid BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse in Torrance.  It is not worth it."
Steve K.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,125,139,4.0,8/5/2013,"Been here over 20 times and have noticed that service at this particular BJ's is directly proportional to where you sit. Once you enter the door and facing the podium, the bar is situated on the left. The further right you sit (aisle-wise), the shittier service you get. It never-ever fails. If you're lucky to sit on the left-most aisle, consider yourself lucky! The central aisle, which we sat in most, is also serviced by well attentive servers.  The right-most aisle, we've probably sat in 5 times, and all of those times we had to wait over 10 minutes before our server would greet us, always had problems refilling our drinks and always had an issue with server checking up on us. Other than that, BJ's always hit the spot. If you dine here often like us, be sure to sign up for the Premiere Rewards program. We've redeemed two $25-off coupons already. Just remember, avoid the right-most aisle (because I think the right-most aisle is where all the n00b servers are training). Update 7/22/14 - ever since I wrote this review, we've sat at the bar (not within the tables in the bar area, but the actual bar, on the bar stool), never an issue with service."
Christina M.,"Long Beach, CA",189,104,4,4.0,8/13/2013,"Yeah, it's a chain.  But you know, sometimes going to a chain restaurant isn't a bad thing.  Hopefully they've got some consistency going down... I am a beer lover, and BJ's has their own brews (Jeremiah Red if I can handle all the alcohol or the Nutty Brewnette if I want to slow it down a bit) - - as well as a rather extensive selection of Belgians and other hard-to-finds.   The service is nice and friendly, and speedy about 89% of the time.  It is packed most of the time, so, yeah, you might have to wait for a minute every once in a while... The food is decent too.  I am a HUGE fan of their ""Small Bites"" menu.  You end up spending as much as a large meal, but you get to try a whole bunch of little things, all of which I really really like.  Fresh mozzarella and tomato salad, stuffed mushrooms, fried wontons....  Really good!   Their menu is very large, and very diverse... So if there is one meal you aren't in love with, you are bound to find another that you love. And finally, they have a really really good HH.  Apparently Tuesdays you can get ANY wine 1/2 off.  And they have a decent wine selection.  Their HH is terrific on their own brews which, last time I was there, was every day during the lunch-time hours.  If I remember correctly.  My point is:  Many ways you can experience a HH deal there. Definitely a fan."
Jack C.,"Tustin, CA",31,21,18,5.0,12/18/2014,Awesome food.  Happy hour is great!  I love their pizza for of course.  Their santa fe spring rolls are good! Bartenders are all friendly and awesome.  Happy times everytime i go here
Thar S.,"Torrance, CA",361,72,2,4.0,8/6/2013,"I'm giving this restaurant a '4' because it's such a  reliable, safe restaurant (reliable as in it's always open when you need it to be and safe as in its menu aims to please everyone).  I've been here countless times.  The service is...OK. The speed really depends on when you go (like all other restaurants). Most of the time, they seem to be doing 20 things at once.  As for the food, BJ's is known for its pizza,but I've never had them myself. I mean you can order pizza from a chain and it would be exactly the same thing but cheaper. I always get the entree items and they're pretty OK. Nothing to brag about, but they're pleasant. Texas-fried Chicken is good because the portion is huge! Pasta dishes are tasty too but their portion is not too big. Pizzokies are good, but the crumble was a revelation and very different from other crumbles that I've had before.  In conclusion, the service is serviceable, and the food is good. Nothing to brag about, but it gets the job done."
Jennie V.,"Redondo Beach, CA",67,68,29,2.0,3/23/2013,"Delicious food...horrible service!  I'm not sure if they are short staffed at this location but man the wait to receive our food was unbearable.  Several tables near us also looked irritated, one actually left before their food came out.   HI: food is consistent since it's a huge chain. LO: horrible service!"
Berlyn P.,"Pasadena, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/25/2016,Came here to celebrate my bday last night. The servers were terrible. I work in this industry I know it's rough. The server never apologized for her bad attitude. She was rude. We had a big party she never brought the waters we asked for or any of the drinks for that matter. When we tried to help her she said she knew what she was doing and didn't need our help. The icing on the cake was when she circled the suggested gratuity...seriously for your bad service? Normally I'd feel bad and give a tip but she didn't even feel sorry for the way she was acting. She clearly hated her job. One of my friends went to complain to the manager. We told him the server was nice but the service was horrible. He said he would give us bigger desserts. We never order any dessert. We were paying and leaving. We waited two hours for our food. Two people at our table got their food 40 minutes before us. And to top it off my pizza was undercooked...so much for a happy bday.
Premier Legal D.,"Gardena, CA",8,4,,5.0,11/16/2014,Love the food and ambiance!  My best friend and I eat here once or twice a week!  Our favorite server is Chanel.  She is the BEST!!  Make sure you ask to sit in her section if you want excellent and friendly service by a truly beautiful woman!!
S. V.,"Torrance, CA",4,49,34,5.0,2/28/2015,We stopped by BJ'S yesterday for lunch after out movie & ate at the bar. Yuki was AMAZING & on point we loved our experience and will definitely come back. On top.of the GREAT SERVICE the broccoli & cheddar soup was Yummy & my husbanf LOVED the Thyme Chicken.....thank you YUKI
Shiva K.,"Torrance, CA",103,9,,5.0,2/26/2015,"Great place to eat while you shop or even just to hang out. All the servers are always so kind but one in particular, his name is josh, is the best of the best. He's attentive and awesome and not hard on the eyes. Ask for him when you dine in, you won't be disappointed :)!"
