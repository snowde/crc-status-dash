Nans R.,"Willowbrook, CA",436,356,211,4.0,1/26/2013,"This BJ's has the tendency to get crowded after 6 pm.  If you come right before the rush of people looking to eat after work then you'll have no problem getting a table right away.   I like that they've included a page on their menu that includes food under 500 calories. I save my calories for new joints or amazingness ... or bowls of popcorn, or wine, or ... you get the point.  I've had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it was pretty good. Fresh veggies, rice was a very good consistency, the fish was okay.   The staff is always very friendly and attentive, so kudos to them for holding it together."
Joshua D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",10,54,,2.0,1/23/2013,"Meh. That sums up BJ's in Torrance. Obviously it's a chain so the menu is consistent, but the service is sadly not. My wife and I recently visited the Torrance location and the service was simply terrible. This was midweek ~11am, so the work rush hadn't arrived and the place was pretty empty.  Nonetheless, after being seated quickly the waitress took about 5 minutes to arrive. Not good. After placing our order we waited, and waited...and waited, about 40 minutes for our food.  On top of it all, their menu has become so bloated, much like many of the frequent BJ's clientele.  Bottom line, if you're not in a rush, if you're looking for a nice afternoon food coma, check out BJ's. Otherwise, there are tons of other Torrance options to choose from."
Gene Y.,"Torrance, CA",44,49,47,4.0,2/25/2013,"Appetizers are excellent: artichoke dip, bruschetta and calamari. Deep dish cheese pizza with tomato chunks - Excellent!  If you buy appetizers, pizza and Pizookie - plan on a doggie bag for leftovers the next day.   Don't stress over it, the pizza actually tastes just as good the next day!  Save room for dessert.  Pizookie - a hot out of the oven big cookie in a tin with vanilla ice cream on top.  Once the spoons hit the table, the fighting begins!!   Tips:  1) Pizookie - Order 1/2 chocolate chip and half peanut butter.  Yumm! 2) This place seems crowded so go early.  They use beepers but only works within a short distance!"
Lian L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,8,1,1.0,4/1/2014,"Service is extremely slow! Table are empty,  but host would not bring guess there. Foods are okay but it took 30 minutes wait to get your order up on table. It is not worth to go!"
Aurora U.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,3/2/2015,"This was my first time eating breakfast at BJ's. I had the french toast, scrambled eggs, and sausage. French toast was fluffy, perfectly golden and crust was not chewy or hard. Scrambled eggs were tasty, but given a rather small portion. Sausages were the best, great smokey flavor and fresh. My boyfriend had the buttermilk pancakes, they were delicious! His country potatoes were done well, with butter and herb. Overall it was a wonderful breakfast, and no waiting time."
Paul K.,"Indianapolis, IN",124,866,16,3.0,2/22/2011,"Bjs is so-so in my opinion- I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza so that in itself eliminates half of their menu. I also mostly come here for lunch, and while their lunch specials are reasonable the service tends to be quite slow, to the point I won't come here unless someone else suggests it. Once the food comes, however, it is generally pretty tasty. It's also hard to find something healthy on the menu- they just started listing their calories and- mamma mia!- a turkey san over 1,000 calories without the fries?  If you want to come here, come at night, wash everything down with plenty of their beer, and don't worry about calories!"
Jan M.,"Torrance, CA",1,2,,1.0,10/12/2014,Worst service ever but the food was great. Water spilled took 10mins to get it wiped up they wouldn't give us anything to wipe it off the seats. The server took so long with everything. We watched her wait at the bar for 5mins to get one beer. Wow probably won't go back. Maybe during the week for lunch.
Melissa P.,"San Jose, CA",70,101,18,5.0,12/30/2014,"This was the best BJs I've been to. The waiter loved his job & showed it. The food was delicious, we had the chili verde fries & medium BJs favorite deep dish pizza. Everything was great all around, gives me hope for others."
Katie W.,"Torrance, CA",58,123,34,3.0,12/28/2014,"The food here is not awful, but it is definitely not worth waiting for... Yet there always seems to be a wait here! It is located in the Del Amo Mall and they do have a full bar, so I do understand the allure, but I just don't think it's anything special. I've come here several times and have had both good service and bad service - doesn't seem to be too consistent. Their pizookies are delicious and I would say that this is a fun place to go with a group, but it would never be my first choice."
Hiroshi I.,"Long Beach, CA",175,142,69,5.0,10/4/2013,"Came here with a friend on a late, Tuesday night. Probably the most fanciest BJ's I've walked into!  Place was very clean! I've ordered many of the deep dish pizzas here and all of them have not failed in taste!  This particular night, we ordered the chicken bacon ranch and it was fantastic!  And as any meal at BJ's, you CANNOT go home without getting their pizookies!  Can fit that thing in even after you stuffed yourself with food! Food & Service: A+!"
Kelly D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",8,19,3,2.0,9/9/2015,Dry pizza with no sauce. My soup came out completely room temperature. Almost as if they forgot to even heat it up before serving it to me. I sent it back and it came back completely the same. Then they brought us the wrong pizookies. Yuck. Never coming back here.
Brandon V.,"Torrance, CA",113,255,201,3.0,10/20/2010,"My dining experience at BJ's during my last visit wasn't all that great.  Same great food and beer, but the service that night was just horrible.  My usual order is the great white and some chicken lettuce wraps.  Easy order, right?  Nothing fancy, just pizza and lettuce wraps. Twenty minutes have gone by after placing our order and the pizza comes.  Great tasting pizza, deep dish, alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, and melted cheese.  Yum!  So I'm eating and I'm thinking this in my head, ""Strange how the pizza came before the chicken lettuce wraps."" Ten minutes after we got the pizza, the lettuce wraps finally came.  Except it wasn't the chicken lettuce wraps.  They served us the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps.  So, we had them take it back.  After we ate most of the pizza, we ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie.   About ten minutes after ordering the pizookie, it finally came.  Sweet sensation baby!  Fresh and warm and ready to be fully covered with ice cream.  It made me forget about the chicken lettuce wraps that never made it to the table without an explanation.  Perhaps I should put an ad about it on a milk carton:  ""HAVE YOU SEEN MY CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS?""   So we got the bill and they had the nerve to charge us for the chicken lettuce wraps.  So I asked the waitress, ""Do you remember taking the wrong lettuce wraps back?""  She said she did.  Then I told her that the chicken lettuce wraps never made it to this table.  She asked me if I was serious.  At that point, I wanted to start twitching.  I wanted to turn green.  I wanted my body to rip through my clothes and say, ""Now do I look serious?""  Bottom line, they fixed the check, I went on my merry way, and I ended up with a nice pen.   FOOD:  5 STARS SERVICE THAT NIGHT:  2 STARS OVERALL:  3.5 STARS"
Brandie J.,"Carson, CA",7,8,2,4.0,2/18/2015,"I've always have a good experience at this BJ's at Del Amo. The service has always been wonderful. My husband and I have a tie to this location because our name initials are ""BJ"" hence the restaurant's name and when we were pregnant with our first child my water broke while we were eating here ( LOL ) . So we will ALWAYS remember this place ! I also love the openess of the floor plan, you can see the whole restaurant from any place you sit including the TV's at the bar."
Julia C.,"Pacific Palisades, CA",111,4,,5.0,4/21/2015,"Honestly, it took a long time to get seated over the weekend, but what really tuned it around was the service, my server Greg actually is the only reason I rated this 5 stars, really turned my experience around very personable and had a great sense of humor made my family feel very welcomed and he provided more than exceptional service  he went above and beyond and made us completely forget about the long wait time and mediocre food thanks greg next time we come by we will definitely request to dine with you again!"
Jill C.,"San Jose, CA",73,91,216,2.0,6/19/2014,"Thefood is really good I can tell, but the -3 stars is because of the service.. They're super SLLLOOWWW... And that's one thing I really hate in terms of dining in to a restaurant, I want my server to be quick and paying attention to there customers, so whenever we need anything she's always there to help us during our meal... Our Order was slow, so we have to cancel the calamari which supposed to be a an appetizer, we finished our soup, pasta and chicken already and we're about to get our dessert but our appetizer not yet in our table! Even the dessert omg so freakin slow!! BJS DEL AMO FIX THIS PLS! You're food was good but your servers -NOT!!!"
Allan M.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,2,1.0,3/13/2015,"I would like to start off by saying terrible service. Terrible communication. I had the California club sandwich which at first was okay but toward the end it's started to get soggy with the bacons grease. I would never recommend the French fries either, they tend to have a strong seafood stench as if they fry the seafood in the same oil. Been here a couple of times and have never been satisfied."
Dustin T.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,19,2,2.0,5/10/2014,"The pizza is amazing and the service is almost always great... However I'm giving this two stars because of a situation with a server named Katrina. If you find yourself seated in her section,  ask to move!!!  I've waited tables most of my adult life,  and I know the difference between someone giving an honest effort and messing  up and someone just not giving a f***. Katrina is in the latter. My girlfriend and I were there post rush but far before closing. She was rude,  ignores us,  and made us feel like we were imposing on her space. I rarely ever give less than 20% tip,  because I've been in the industry and know how it is. But I couldn't in good conscience give her more than 10. She never checked on us,  we waited a solid nearly 10 mi uses to be greeted,  our drinks were empty until we stood up and flagged her down,  and the food took 45 minutes for a small pizza and a salad. And they weren't busy at all.  She's terrible and needs to get it together or walk."
Jenn G.,"Torrance, CA",1678,1065,6635,3.0,7/26/2009,"Everytime I think of BJ's I think of good times with friends over pizza and pizookie. When BJ's opened up here in Torrance I was curious to see how it was. I had heard that it got pretty crowded here and that the waiting time could be long so I didn't come here right away. I finally came here recently to BJ's for a lunch with an old friend.  I honestly expected this place to be bigger but it was actually not that big. Luckily it wasn't too crowded either. It was Saturday lunch time and so I expected more people but only a couple of the tables were filled. We were seated pretty quickly and given our menus were given quickly. After scanning the menu, I chose the California grilled chicken sandwich along with their root beer. My friend also ordered a chicken sandwich and a Caesar salad.  My root beer came out first. BJ's freshly brews their own root beer and so I was curious to try it out. It was pretty good and a bit on the sweet side. I noticed however it wasn't that cold when served. It would have been a bit better if it was somewhat chilled.  Our entrees were quickly served but I did notice that my friend's Caesar salad came after her entree was served. This was a little weird considering salads are usually served before the main meal =P. They also gave her the wrong drink by giving her a coke instead of an iced tea.  My entree was the California grilled chicken sandwich. This is a chicken sandwich on a sourdough bread. Inside the sandwich there are big pieces of chicken, avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing. I got this with the wedge cut fries. (You actually have the choice of getting wedge cut fries or regular fries). Taste wise it was OK. It was good but nothing way out of the ordinary. It does leaving you feeling pretty full though. I actually only ended up eating half there and the other half I took to-go. I had no room for the pizookie (too bad because I think I would of rather enjoyed that lil treat...)  I kinda wish I ordered pizza because I noticed one of the deep dish pizzas at a nearby table and it looked pretty good.  Anyways I wouldn't mind coming here again. It is kinda pricey but the prices are pretty comparable to other competitor restaurants.  The vibe of the place is not bad. They have tv's everywhere and it kind of has a sporty kinda feel to it.  Oh yes Bonus points for having a tv that turned onto the NHL network...yay hockey :)"
Liisa H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,111,,2.0,1/31/2015,"The food here is okay, but the service is unbelievably bad.  We have gone a number of times and finally decided last week was our last because it never gets any better. The beer is excellent and the food is okay, but neither of these make up for the extremely slow service.  We ordered as soon as our waiter (finally) came over.  It took about 20 minutes before our drinks came and about 35-40 for the food.  Then, it took about 15 minutes after we were done eating to track down our waiter to get the check, plus another 10 for him to bring it.  Another friend who was there at the same time, waited 45 minutes to even order.   The small appetizer salads are quite good (but small is the key word). The ahi poke was kind of tasteless this time, though it has been good in the past.  My daughter really liked the spaghetti with marinara and my husband said the small veggie deep dish pizza was good as well.  I like that they have calories on the menu, but there is almost nothing the least bit healthy or under 1,000 calories.  I will say again that the beer is very good, so if you want to just sit at the bar and drink beer, the service is probably better and the beer is worth it."
eric l.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,52,99,5.0,2/3/2016,I've been coming here for lunch at least once a week for over a year. It's the best option in the neighborhood and the service is great. This place has a good crew and a big variety of foods to keep me coming back to try more. Happy to be a regular.
