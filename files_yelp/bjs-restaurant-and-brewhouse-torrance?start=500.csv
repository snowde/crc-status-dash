Lori L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",837,270,970,3.0,8/27/2012,"Came here with my kids with a gift certificate which I won at my kid's school's son and mom night, we ended up spending a lot more than the amount on the certificate bc daddy decided to join us at the last min., which ""destroyed"" my plan for only spending a little bit more than the rewarded amount.  Lol. Two things stood out during our visit here: the happy face potato tator tot thingy was cute and tasty, my kid loved it!  And the ultra cool attentive young waitress, I know she will go to places someday. The food was really just so-so, but I think ppl come here for the ambiance and convenient location.  It's by the mall and the movie theater, so they are always crowded."
Oscar R.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",12,13,,1.0,1/26/2015,This is my 2nd review for this BJ. WORST BJ EVER. Their customer service is horrible. The lady in the front was very rude. I asked her how long the wait was and she responded rudely. We got seated and probably waited more than 30 mins for a waitress to come ask for our drinks. Than after that we order our food and my girlfriend got her food first than me. I waited for my food another 30 mins. Don't understand why they have horrible service.
S N.,"Long Beach, CA",45,131,,2.0,11/26/2012,"This is my second experience at a BJ's in 2 months as I had a gift card I wanted to use up. The first was in the Huntington Beach Bjs where I had the worse Mohitoes on the planet-yes I've had them in Cuba so know what I am talking about. Anyhoo this second visit in Torrance for my bf birthday-he actually requested the place as he likes the pizza- was only a little better. Since the first visit was one star for their tasteless ""signature drink"" and this second visit was 3 stars I  will balance it out to two stars. Ahem-We went to the Torrance Bj's last Sat night at 645 pm. Parking was tough but free and security everywhere. The place was packed and the wait was told to be 45 min. Rather than wait my bf suggested we lurk in the bar for someone to leave as they serve the same food in there anyway so we did just that and scored a table immediately. I asked our waitress to wipe our table and she ignored me.  But she was busy so ok. That's cool. What is the real travesty is the pizza. My bf was raging about this places pizza as being the best in the world.  He ordered my fav toppings hoping I would agree. We got their special which was pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and tomato. It  had no toppings what to speak of. I mean 5 peperoni if that and the cheese was non existent. I must say though I enjoyed the crust immensely and since it was all crust that was a blessing. I also enjoyed my Malbec very much and the beer selection is indeed very good.  However, we went there for pizza and even my guy who loves this place was disappointed and it was his bday which really upset me.   After we finished our ""crust"" we noticed our neighbors got the exact same pizza and they had 3 times the toppings. We were pretty pissed seeing that. Since I had never had their crust that they try to pass off as pizza I did not know I had grounds to gripe but after seeing our neighbors pizza I was experiencing some mad pizza envy as did my birthday sweetie.  We  used up my gift card in full and proceeded to go see a movie next door, fb bday cheesecake at home. It was a super nice evening but BJ's food and service had nothing to do with it. Because he loves the place we will in all probability give it another shot. Let's hope they gimme some toppings!"
Alex G.,"Los Angeles, CA",312,164,2914,5.0,7/30/2011,"This place is great. I was feeling it last night. Yeah sure, there was a 15 minute wait to be seated but I made the best of walking to the bar and getting a Stella and a La Crema red for the lady. After half way through the glass we were being seated.  The staff were very polite and attentive. As it should be since the place was packed. They did an outstanding job waiting and serving the multitude of hungry and parched crowds. The place was packed.  The appetizer we ordered was the never disappointing Avocado Egg Rolls that comes with the Tamarind Sauce. These two go hand in hand. Its a match made in heaven.  The signature pizzas are fabulous. Everything is great about BJ's Fav PIzza. What I like most about it was the crispiness of the crust. The cheese tasted fresh as well as all the other toppings.  Oh! and the Pizookie! is a delight."
Aubrey S.,"Hendersonville, TN",33,23,,2.0,3/27/2014,"The 4 times that we have been here, the service and time spent waiting for food has ruined this experience. we have never been here and it has taken less than  hours which is unfortunate because the food is pretty good.  The last time we were here will be the last time. It's too bad but when I go to a Brewery I don't expect a full hour to lapse between getting seated and receiving my food."
Almas A.,"Alhambra, CA",187,27,5,1.0,9/22/2015,Worst place ever. I wanted happy hour and had my daughter with me so I couldn't get it. I loved bjs so much and they disappointed me. Don't recommend if you have kids.
Clifford P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,101,,3.0,1/20/2013,"Came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and the place was packed. Waited about 35 minutes for a table, but I guess that's to be expected on a Saturday night. Once seated, things moved fairly quickly. While waiting to be called, we took a look at the menu and already made our dining choices, so once we sat down, we were able to order our drinks and entrees at the same time. If you're pressed for time, I highly recommend this, as our food arrived quickly, and we were able to eat and leave in less than an hour. Having been to other BJ's, I was happy to see that the Torrance location offered a much wider selection than other locations. Some of the selections our table ordered were soup &  salad, a deep dish pizza, and the rib eye steak. All the dishes were well prepared and service was superb even though the place was packed. One note. We noticed a sign on our table that if you join the BJ's Premier Rewards program, you're allowed to make reservations at their restaurant, rather than waiting for a table after you arrive. We didn't sign up for this since we weren't sure how ofter we'd be back, but if you're a regular or thinking about becoming one, it sounds like it would be worth joining just for the ability to make reservations, not to mention any other perks that come with membership."
Ariana F.,"Torrance, CA",0,17,,4.0,3/21/2015,"Their weekday lunch menu is great! I like having lunch here after a day of shopping. Their mini corn dogs from the kids menu are good! The service can be so so, but being a former waitress I understand. The service has never been rude."
Sang L.,"Gardena, CA",26,139,6,4.0,2/7/2013,Well IM BACK!! Check out their appetizers! So many! So hard to decide!!!! But beware!!! their happy hour ain't that happy on prices :)
Obichang O.,"Honolulu, HI",100,38,122,5.0,7/18/2013,"I hadn't heard about BJ's before but was glad to have been introduced to this chique, sportsbar-esque California chain. The service here is really friendly and helpful and patient with to talk story and explain menu items and options. The alcohol selection is incredibly expansive, including a wide variety of California and international beers, a nice selection of wives and a large collection of spirits. If the beer choices are too expansive, the staff is more than happy to give you reading samples, or if you'd rather make your own exploration, there is a beer-tasting item on the menu that offers one ounce samples of your choice of any four beers. They also offer a selection of cocktails and mocktails to suit even discriminating tastes. The food menu is huge and covers every facet of American cuisine. I like to judge based on the salads - a simple concept that can be mind-blowing if care and creativity are used. I selected the mango salad because it seemed exotic and strange to me - it ended up being amazing beyond comprehension. The mangoes  compliment tree fairly standard salad by offering a light sweetness that enriches the.flavor of the vinaigrette and the diced tomatoes. in fact, the salad really triples as an appetizer, entree and dessert.  BJ' s service motto is to never lose a customer and I think they take that challenge brilliantly in their service ideals and their approach to amazing food."
Lauren M.,"Los Angeles, CA",131,117,22,4.0,12/11/2012,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse: Last Friday night my mother and I took my cousin Michael and his girlfriend Emily out to dinner at this establishment.  POSITIVES: The service. The Asian American waitress did a fantastic job at servicing our table. This is why I hope she received a good portion of HER tip since she did most of the work, meaning she was the waitress that constantly checked in. I'm sure the next round will be a bit ah... different.  The restroom: Clean. Definitely a plus! Always a plus.  The water is also quite fresh. NEGATIVES: The noise. It was a bit overwhelming and really detracted from conversation but whatev. It is a sports bar after all.  Great place. Never really disappoints."
Julie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,83,5,5.0,10/20/2013,"My waiter was amazing! Super attentive and super nice. The meat pasta with meatballs were bomb. California flatbread, ahi poke, and Thai style chicken wontons. Super happy!"
Nesha B.,"Hawthorne, CA",259,250,107,5.0,10/7/2014,Love love love Bjs whats not to like i cant get enough of their deep dish pizza and pazookies this location is always busy but its on the side of the mall thats to be expected I've never had issues with food or service thus far keep up the good work ;-)
Vincent R.,"Harbor City, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/31/2015,Cleanliness. Fix that. I sat in a chair with frosting on the back rest. Never coming back. Clean your chairs and tables.
Shannon R.,"Los Angeles, CA",288,110,2,4.0,9/3/2013,Great burgers. But this time I got the cob salad with spinach instead and balsamic.  Wasn't that great. Next tine I'll keep it like they intended. lol Service is good.
Ally F.,"Compton, CA",28,65,17,3.0,6/23/2013,"Our server, Jessica H. was really nice, drinks refilled before asking...but in other areas of customer service...needs improvement... I think. Here's our experience -- My nephew decided to order the teriyaki chicken plate, but instead of rice, he just wanted fries. I ask him, ""Are you sure? Teriyaki chicken NO rice?"" He told Jessica, ""Yeah I don't want rice, can I get fries instead?""  Jessica nodded, ""Sure, besides our rice isn't the bomb here, it's terrible, so better you get the fries."" A long while later, we finally get our food. My husband, son, and I all liked our dishes. But not the nephew. They put the teri chicken all over the fries lol. I told him, well, that's what you ordered.  Seriously tho, what cook would put a slathering of teri chicken on top of fries? After the nephew kept making all kinds of faces giving us hints he didn't like his plate, my husband took the neph's plate, and gave him half his hamburger and fries.  I tried the food on my neph's plate. It was awful, there was hardly any chicken. I saw mostly vegetables. If there was chicken I didn't see it was drowning in their terrible teriyaki sauce.  Jessica came by again and asked how the food was. We told her the teriyaki chicken was terrible, we weren't going to eat it, and we wished we had specified the fries to be put on the side. She shrugged and said, ""Yeahhh, it's not that good, but to be honest, that probably tastes even better than if you had it over rice."" Shrugged again and walked away. Soooo...she ended up taking away a full plate of untouched teriyaki chicken-covered fries. I didn't ask to return the plate because it's what the nephew ordered. and he's 18...if he wanted something else he should've said something. But at the same time, I really wanted our server to do something other than shrug and agree that the food sucks. Like really? Can you please take off that $14 charge perhaps?  Oh well. Lesson learned. BJ is only good for desserts."
Marlyn I.,"South Gate, CA",0,9,3,1.0,8/2/2015,My pizza was disgusting cold and drenched in bbq sauce i couldn't even taste anything else my pizza was so cold my cheese wasn't melted  in some places ummm don't they specialize in pizzas i expect it to at least be edible i had half of a slice left hungry n wanting a refund. I give them one star because our waiter Joe was awesome he was on the ball.
Toni D.,"Burkesville, KY",22,46,18,3.0,1/21/2013,"This BJ's is a good one to go to and sit at the bar!  Whenever we go here and sit in the dining room, it takes for-EVER to get waited on and to get your drinks and then to get your food!  I will not go back and sit in the dining room here! My Son and I did come here and sat at the bar last time though and the service was awesome from the bartenders!  They took our order and wham!, we had our drinks and then, wham!, we had our food!  It really was wonderful!  Their food is excellent too! I would definitely come back here again someday, but I will never have the patience to wait such long times for actual service like I have experienced here before.  I will only sit at the bar and if the bar is full, well, I guess we go somewhere else!"
Hannah K.,"Torrance, CA",44,163,19,4.0,7/14/2013,"The BJ's at this location has good service and is clean. I like coming for lunch time because the meals are cheaper and the portions are smaller (if you order from the lunch menu). I love to get the pizookie (ice cream on top of fresh baked cookie) once in a while as well. If you haven't tried it, then you should because its so delicious! This BJ's is located in the Del Amo Mall. Its on the outside portion of the mall near the AMC theatres and PF Changs. If you are at the mall and contemplating where to go to eat this is a good place to come to (especially at lunch time)."
Quennie J.,"Lawndale, CA",51,9,22,4.0,12/4/2014,They have a great pizookie I recommend half oreo and half peanut butter pizookie.. Or the white macadamia yum!
