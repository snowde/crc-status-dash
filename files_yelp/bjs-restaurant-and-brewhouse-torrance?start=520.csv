Andrea C.,"Torrance, CA",122,42,17,5.0,11/15/2012,"I love this place! The atmosphere is friendly and inviting. The service was amazing thanks to the extraordinary server.  I came here with a friend for their reverse happy hour. I ordered the Wyder's Pear Cider (Loved!), Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms (off of the small bites menu), and the Ahi Poke. The Ahi Poke was beyond great. I will forever order the Ahi Poke at BJ's."
Kevin H.,"Woodland Hills, CA",154,46,,3.0,8/12/2013,"I always love BJ's locations. The dip dish pizza style is very unique and completely worth the trip to most any location. Their own brewed beers are also very good and can satisfy any style of thirst.  This location is good but I give a lower rating only because tables can be very close together and the place can get very loud. Since it is also in a mall it also can get hard to get easy parking and may have a wait from time to time. Still, when you're here it's a great place to eat."
Author W.,"Torrance, CA",104,5,11,2.0,3/16/2015,"2.5  poor customer service from the time we walked in. The greeters didn't greet just confirmed a party of 2. The young lady who escorted us to our table didn't speak. We were walked over and she left. What happened to, ""your server will be right with you."" At first I thought, their young and this may be their first job but... Jose G our server was just as rude. He checked on us in passing but so quick I had to ask another young lady for what I wanted. She was sweet but no badge so I don't know her name. My husband was giving Jose his order. I'm digging in my purse. I noticed it got quiet but I was trying to find my hand sanitizer. I then hear, is there anything else or does that complete your order? I look up, I'm like owe, you're done, I'm use to my server asking me directly what I'm ordering. I didn't know you were waiting on me. At the end he handed us our to go boxes. I had to flag another waitress for a bag. Like, Jose where did you go? Not to mention I wanted shrimp in my meal not chicken but guess what, I got chicken. Smh... Very poor service and I see I'm not the only one who feels this way. Cerritos and Burbank have the best service ever."
Don S.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",152,214,,2.0,8/19/2012,"This is from my visit about a month ago.  I mentioned this on other reviews-- I normally don't do a BAD review for a restaurant, I usually just don't post anything at all since I believe in the American Dream and don't like contributing to others' failure.  But when it comes to big national chains?  Fuck it, I gotta speak on it. Service at this BJ's was not horrible the 2 times I went.  Host and wait staff was fairly friendly.  The real problem was the food.  The pizza I got absolutely sucked major ass.  I mean it was nasty in my mouth.  In fact I fought through half of it because I was hungry and then I just felt like going all Super Model on myself and sticking a finger down my throat to puke it up-- that's how bad I wanted that crap out of me.   It was one of their ""signature"" deep dish pizzas.  But damn, it was bad.  I'm thinking they need to abandon the deep dish format and go with thin crust pies because that doughy half baked mess was not the business.  You have been warned."
Victoria L.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",36,51,29,4.0,10/20/2015,"Always a treat! This bjs is located at del amo mall, that being said it is usually crowded on weekends. Coming closer to the holidays and following a very recent remodel it's constantly busy. It's about 30-45 minute wait on your average Friday night. That may be their only downfall, how busy they get. I've always had great service and great food. I usually sit at the bar, the service is always great. Jo is fabulous, always keeping the food and drinks coming. They have a great beer selection, including their own collection of beers, two of which I have tried (hefeweizen and pumpkin ale) and they are great! Reasonably priced running about $5 a pint. During happy hour you get a dollar off beer, great deals on appetizers and cocktails (during evening hours I think 9-close/ and during football games) I usually just dine on appetizers while at the bar. One of my favorites is The great beginnings (an appetizer platter) if you are looking to try a few of their different appetizers I would suggest this one. It can easily serve 4 people. Aside from beer, bjs is famous for their delicious pizookie (warm cookie deserts topped with a generous scoop of ice cream) in a variety of yummy flavors. I will definitely be back for a pumpkin ale and pizookie soon!"
Carolina A.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",2,3,,1.0,7/25/2014,The worse service ever! The houstess was rude because the place was full and the other side was closed because they dont care give us a table to eat something! Why dont tell us that they dont have tables and wait a long time with out service waiting in a corner !!! Really bad place
Drrea R.,"Long Beach, CA",7,9,,5.0,11/14/2014,Our waiter Kalina was awesome very outgoing and attentive ! Had a nice lunch will be coming to this location again
Breana L.,"Gardena, CA",60,5,2,5.0,6/30/2014,"It was extremely busy so I went in with low expectations, but I left BJ's with high expectations. BJ's has set the bar so high and it's all due to one person who made my experience so enjoyable-- Katrina. She was so friendly and genuine. Not once did I have to ask for my water to be refilled (I drink a lot of water so my glass is empty within 5 min.) and there was a huge crowd of people already seated. I just can't praise this restaurant enough; they did a good job by hiring Katrina!"
Sean S.,"Stanton, CA",56,7,,3.0,11/9/2014,"It was a busy Saturday night, so a wait was expected. We called ahead and only waited 10 min once we arrived. After that, the night kinda fell apart. Our server, Chad, didn't greet us for 10 minutes. Even on a busy night, that's unacceptable. To save us time, we ordered our drinks (soda, tea, water) and dinner at the same time. My mother received her salad before her drink.       The food can and everything was fine. As we neared the end of our meal, I ordered a mini pepperoni pizza to go (no tomatoes, for what it's worth). Chad returned to collect our dishes and said he would come back with the check. I told him to just take my card and he didn't know how to carry it and the dishes (several pockets on his apron, shirt, pants) and not forget my card. Got the pizza and the check and left.     I come to check the pizza today and it was a plain cheese pizza. Not one pepperoni on it. Now, Chad seemed like a nice enough guy and I tipped more than 20%, but he is just not a good server (I was a server/bartender for 8 years). He doesn't know how to multitask, a pretty important skill for the job.       If our at here, and get him as a server, on a busy night, plan ahead and check everything."
Bubba R.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/19/2014,Absolutely the slowest service I have ever experienced.. I have been sitting for an hour and all I have gotten is my water... but this is not the first time I have came to bjs and experienced this.. every time I come it's an hour before anything happens.. ridiculous
Sue O.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2,153,9,4.0,10/19/2012,"For a chain, this place has great food, good atmosphere, and the best Pizookies!  If you can, come for their weekday lunch specials.  You get salad, 1/2 sandwich, and fries for about $6.50 and it's a steal! They also have other choices like salad and individual sized pizza for about the same price.   Their Fried Artichoke is awesome and it's only $4.   I bought a fundraiser card from my little cousin, and they have a free Pizookie with purchase of 2 entrees!  Sooooo worth it.  The Red Velvet one is the best!"
Daddy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,44,29,4.0,6/8/2014,"Service here usually sucks, but today was a good day. Not crowded, attentive & upbeat waitress, and food was on time."
Nicole B.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,94,,2.0,4/20/2012,"I was holding off on reviewing this place simply because my coworkers and I frequent this place (at least 1-2x's per week) since we work so close and their lunch specials are cheap with a good amount of food, and I didn't want to give them a bad review. But after our experience today, I decided it's time for a review. First, their service has been horrible (at least to us). The servers that we have been getting, particularly this tall white guy with dark hair, have been unpleasant. He comes, takes our order, and disappears. We don't even get refills. We don't see him at all after he takes our order. He only comes 10 minutes after we're done with our food to give us the check. Also, we have had other unpleasant servers, who we literally have to track down in order to have her/him bring us a side of ranch or a refill. Second, the quality of their food over the last 3-5 months have sucked. We have sent back so many dishes. The meat is either undercooked, there is too much dressing in the salad, the fries are too oily and cold, etc. It makes me wonder if they have all new chefs? Third, the past three times that we have ordered appetizers (including today), our appetizers would come out at the same time as our food. Are you kidding me? We always send them back and tell them to take it off the bill. What's the point of an appetizer if we're gonna eat it with our main course? Fourth, the utensils are dirrrty!! They have food crusts all over them, and deep water stains. I wonder if they got a new dish washer. Fifth, we always order a pazooki. This time the cookie was literally attached to the pan. We could not scoop it up no matter how hard we tried. It tasted like crap. I am so surprised, because all it is is  a cookie and ice cream, so how can they mess it up?  Sixth, their service has been soooooooo slow. We order our food right away because we only have a 1.5 hours for our lunch break, but then it takes them a good 30-35 minutes to bring out our food. I wonder why they used to be quick with brining out our food in the past but now it takes them forever. Overall, I am really disappointed. I used to love BJ's and considered them one of my favorite restaurants to go to in the South Bay. However, things have started declining. After our experience today, we decided that we would not be going back there for a long while. Lazy Dog has just as cheap of a lunch menu with quick and better service. I hope things start improving."
Raven S.,"Torrance, CA",5,8,7,5.0,11/14/2014,"My family and I usually go to the Cerritos BJ's. We never come here because everytime we do, we get bad service, but a couple weeks ago, our waiter Nicholas T. definitely proved us wrong about this place. He was on top of refills even when the cups were only halfway empty, he took our orders for appetizers, entree and dessert at the right time, he always kept the table clean by taking finished dishes, and finally he grabbed the check as soon as we were done with it. Believe it or not, the last time we came here our waitress failed to do all four of those simple tasks. Nicholas was a very chill waiter with great hospitality and customer service skills. I recommend that he be promoted sometime in the near future. :)"
Sally H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/7/2014,"Quite possibly the worst meal we've had at Del Amo mall, and there are certainly a variety of bad eating options close by. My ten year old said her cheese pizza tasted like sausage, and the crust was overly brown. I had to move the mound of lettuce out the way to find any fish on my grilled mahi mahi tacos, that came with a sauce that only can be described as the ugly step sister of an avocado.   I didn't expect much, and I was still disappointed."
Christina G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1464,987,1073,4.0,4/24/2012,"Aw, I love this place! Pizza is so delish. But only if you're hungry......... the sliders were surprisingly a good deal.. ordered a classic mojito and a peach (I think?) sangria.. they brought out the wrong drink, which was this tart fruity drink forgot what its called but it was better than the sangria.. even though they took it back when they brought out the sangria.. but anyways, the booths are so comfy and love that its not overly-lit .. pleasant and can be romantic and nostalgic annnnnd of course good for celebrations.. or partings.. anyways, BJ's is always a good choice for any occasion! * At other locations they handed out pizza samples for people to try while waiting for a table.. sigh, I wonder if this location does too!"
Natalie B.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",62,17,7,4.0,6/9/2014,"I always get the Strawberry Patch-- it's a super fruity drink with no bite. Dangerous! The bar tenders are nice, servers are nice, and the food is good. It gets really packed, and usually has a really long wait."
Tony D.,"Gardena, CA",1,11,2,2.0,6/23/2012,"SLOW service. It took 45 minutes to get our food. I saw a group that got seated a couple of minutes before us, order lunch, get their food, eat and pay and leave while we were waiting. I think the wait person forgot to put in the order. We didn't order anything that would take too long to prepare.   I ordered the beef dip sandwich. Bread was dry and hard. The sandwich tasted like cardboard. Small size for price. The wedge fries don't taste like they're even made of potatoes.  This is the second time here and it is very cold inside. Feels good at first but sitting there so long my friends had to put on their jackets.  It seems that they don't care about the customer. There was a short wait but no one bothered to write names down to keep track of who came in first so that we could be seated in order. I can see this leading to angering a customer who comes in and watches other groups of the same size who come in after get seated first. I agree with one reviewer. It was busy when we first got there but if BJ's keeps this up they are going to see their customers stop coming."
Alisa S.,"Gardena, CA",0,7,2,4.0,11/17/2015,Food was very good went during a Monday night ! Only down fall was that after placing our order it took around 30 to 45 min for it to be served ! Out waitress was very sweet but after we finished our meal it seemed like she wanted us to leave already but other than that great experience and the spinach dip is AMAZING
Christine W.,"Hawthorne, CA",86,5,,1.0,12/22/2015,I really liked coming here before because I would get off work late and eat here. The food is really delicious and I really loved coming. Anyways I drive to the restaurant and the website says that they're open until midnight. I have gotten here a little past 11 before and I am always able to sit and eat. Anyways I got here at 11:10 and the hostess in the front tells me the dining room is closed. Really dissapointed that I wasted gas and money. I usually don't like writing bad reviews but it looks like I won't be coming back.
