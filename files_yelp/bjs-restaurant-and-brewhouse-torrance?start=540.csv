Alyssa D.,"Torrance, CA",160,25,6,5.0,5/8/2015,"My review is based on my last experience at BJ's, which was yesterday. I haven't been to this location in months bc the service and food was terrible for a long time that I quit going here. However my experience last night totally redeemed all of my bad experiences I've had on my previous visits. Joe was our server and he was awesome.. He was very personable and attentive. The food came out timely, came out hot, and delicious. He checked on us a few times through the meal to make sure everything was good and if we needed anything. I let him know about my previous experiences at this location and thanked him for being so great.. And he told me he was a lead trainer. I've had bad experiences with management here, so the fact he went above and beyond was better than the management as well. He totally changed my opinion about the place. If service continues to be the way it was yesterday I'll definitely return. Thank you joe for the awesome service and food yesterday!"
Tim R.,"Spring Valley, Las Vegas, NV",12,19,11,1.0,9/26/2014,"Came for lunch and it was a little busy.  Staff wasn't very friendly or attentive to us.  Had to ask for refills on beverages.  Food server just brought food, served it and left.  Perhaps everyone had a bad meeting before their shift started...."
Catherine K.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,310,38,4.0,7/21/2010,"BJ's in Del Amo has been a go-to place for my high school group when we have our summer reunions.   I always heard about BJ's pizookies (huge cookie with ice cream on top) so I was pretty excited when it first opened. I also frequent this location with my family because they frequently give surveys for free bruchetta or mozzarella sticks on your receipt for your next visit!  Mmm the bruchetta has really fresh tomatoes and has always been a favorite. The bread they give with the bruchetta is also very buttery and crispy. I personally enjoy the balsamic glazed chicken! They give generous portions: two balsamic glazed chicken breasts with buttery mashed potatoes yumm, salad, grilled onions, and fried onion strings on top The chicken is never dry and very flavorful! I've tried most of their pizzas and I'll crave one once in a while, but the chicken is my favorite!! Since everything in Torrance closes pretty early IMO, BJs is a good option since they open late (midnight on weekdays and 1am on weekends). I love their wide drink and food selection so I'll be back!"
Daniel W.,"Torrance, CA",119,137,58,3.0,7/30/2014,"Who doesn't like a BJ!? Well it's your regular BJs chain, good food, good micro beer, clean environment, full bar, long wait time depending on when you go. If you like all the good old Americana dishes, some infusion, then come here. The menu ranges from ahi tuna salad to pizza, calamari to fried chicken, waffles to burgers, and a good dessert menu. They offer a nice selection of their micro brews with seasonal beers which taste great. Prices are a bit on the higher side, they do offer a good lunch special though. This BJs is part of Del Amo Mall so there's plenty to do in the area."
Ming-Jou C.,"Dallas, TX",1070,875,388,4.0,1/7/2010,"I've hated BJ's ever since college, when they accidentally threw away my leftovers and rewrapped them when I asked what happened to them. And gave them back to me soggy. Totally disgusting. That was the Westwood location. I am a convert now though. I love this location for lunch because of their lunch specials and because 95% of the time, they are pretty quick. Usually, it's me saying, ""Can we go to BJ's? I really want a baked potato."" People are usually okay with it because of their expansive menu.  So they have lunch specials for around $6 - $9, but my favorite is the half baked potato with soup or salad ($7). You can take your pick of potato from the baked potato list two pages prior to the lunch specials page (I come here a lot, I know). Most of their potatoes come with alfredo sauce, which kind of freaks me out because it's just too much gooeyness for me, so I usually stick with the classic. But today, TODAY, I've found the baked potato of my dreams. The pale ale chili baked potato. O M G. I ordered the regular sized one ($9) because I was starving and didn't really want to fool myself into thinking I even cared about having a salad. The combination of the chili and sour cream and chives was awesome. They even gave you a little side of extra chili. After scraping off every bit of potato, I almost ate the skin. The response from my lunch buddy was, ""Wow. You finished it.""  Hellz, yeah. That is now my potato of choice. I've also been here for happy hour on the weekends, which is a pretty good deal for $2 off appetizers and like $5 mini pizzas or something to that effect, but mostly for lunch. And my alcoholic friends love their selection of beers. If you're in the Torrance area, get here before noon for lunch or else you might have a little bit of a wait."
stefanie A.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",116,15,3,1.0,3/17/2014,"Terrible service on a special occasion dinner.  Brought my dad here for his birthday on Wednesday March 5th, with 3 others.  A birthday celebration down the drain, due to bad service, on a day that wasn't even busy. Our food was served after an hour wait. We had our empty plates sitting in front of us during the entire duration. Ordered 2 pazookies, a chocolate chip and a peanut butter birthday pazookie  && it came to us late, and was the wrong flavor. Then we only received one they forget to make the other one so we had to wait again for it to be made. My husband  Initially ordered it to eat at the restaurant, but we had been there for 3 hours already, so he asked to have it TO GO, which of course was another wait. To top it off our waiter never checked up on us, so drinks weren't filled. So terrible. The manager comped us a $10 gift card for our next visit, unfortunately it's unlikely I will be back. I did appreciate him apologizing to us, but it doesn't change the fact that my dads birthday was somewhat ruined. --- I actually had two bad experiences here (within a 10 day period) and was going to write them in 1 review, because I felt bad for writing a bad review and then I realized that wouldn't be fair to other Yelpers. So my second experience will be in another review."
Ricky G.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,15,9,1.0,5/19/2014,PLEASE DON'T EAT HERE! I have severe food poisoning from one of their pizzas and it's not worth the agony of violently vomiting and pooing at the same time for days. Do yourself a favor and choose the Lazy Dog next door.
Melissa F.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,1,,5.0,9/28/2014,"So this is the first review i leave here on yelp.. And it is all because we had such great service here today.. I have been to this restaurant numerous times. And today our service was great!! :) I wish I would've remembered our first servers name.. She was very nice and helpful (loved her make up as well .. Its a girl thing).  Anyways, she was going on break so she came to our table and introduced the server who was taking over- Loren H.  Loren was PHENOMENAL! Seriously i am all about customer service and she did a fabulous job! Very attentive! One thing I cant stand is when servers take your order and once you get your food they disappear.. Loren always came around and made sure everything was okay..  The food was delicious! The broccoli cheddar soup is the best! Pizza was also good & obviously we had dessert (pazooki) mmmmmmmm love it!!"
Jessica P.,"Chesapeake, VA",101,109,61,3.0,1/11/2012,"I usually love BJs but lately the last few times we've been here, we've had HORRIBLE service. The last time in particular.. we went to the bar since there was a wait for the dining room.  First mistake, we should have waited the 5-10 min. Took 10 min for someone to give us menus, etc. Got our drinks, decided on the Santa Fe Spring rolls - amazing stuff. Ordered our food - BJs fave personal pizza (during NFl games, its half off) and the spicy tomato sauce pasta with meatballs (we always order 2 things and share), and I ordered another mojito.   20 min later our food comes, no sign of our waitress and no sign of my mojito.  i cant eat pasta/pizza without peppers and cheese and I couldnt eat either one we sat there for 15 min waiting to flag someone down but no one came, our waitress was no where to be found and meanwhile my pizza was cold.  FINALLLLLLLLY she comes and says she'll bring some cheese & pepper, and my husband tells her the pizza is cold. so she throws it back in the oven. she admits she forgot all about my mojito 20 minutes after this whole fiasco i finally have my mojito and a burnt warmed up pizza. i understand no one is perfect but that would have been a good time to send over a manager, as we were pretty pissed. or at least comp. my mojito that i waited 40 min for..."
Brannigan C.,"Torrance, CA",6,47,10,4.0,4/15/2014,Had a nice dinner with the Wife and kids. We didn't have to wait for a table. The waiters took our order quickly and brought the kids food first which is always awesome for parents. We requested a plastic fork for the little ones to use and they brought both a fork and spoon. Manager is very friendly and helpful.
Armando Lucy R.,"Lawndale, CA",8,11,10,5.0,10/13/2014,Michael runs the bar like nobody I've ever seen. Friendly and great costumer service.
Suesue E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,21,,5.0,4/30/2014,"Updating my review. I said I would never go back to BJ's but ended up coming again because it was my sister's turn to choose where dinner was. Out of the 83838 times I've been to BJ's, this is the first time I've ever had not good service, but great service! Freddy was a pleasure to have as our waiter. He checked back on us frequently & everything came out as ordered.  It doesn't make up for my past experiences, but I  know I will be coming back now to give BJ's more chances!"
Mike M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,16,1,2.0,11/16/2015,Well BJ's has now joined Starbucks and all the other greedy corporations out there. Just when Happy Hour was happy they jacked with the happy hour menu. By the the look of all the empty seats last night during the game I guess I am not the only one that thinks so. I asked the person next to me and they weren't to happy either. i guess good things must come to an end.
D J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,90,5,1.0,3/30/2014,"This BJ's is really going down hill. The service here is horrible. The girl who seated my party had a horrible attitude, she didn't greet us just said follow her, then she just put the menus on our table and walked away. Our waitress was friendly but her servicing skills were not good she seemed to have be handling too many."
Lucio M.,"South Gate, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Came in on a Sunday afternoon, did get seated quick but honestly was the most horrible service I had in a while. Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and 40 to get out food, and what made it worse was that our server was never to be found. Sorry but this service was so horrible never coming here again!"
Jaime S.,"Hawthorne, CA",11,32,10,1.0,3/14/2014,"Fellow yelpers don't fall for the comment below by bjs I sent them an email a week ago and never got a response, I see the run the same system as their servers."
Eder P.,"Los Angeles, CA",357,608,122,4.0,9/27/2010,"This was my first ever visit to BJ's. I loved the atmosphere and their drink list wasn't extremely impressive, I'm not a huge fan of beer or wine but if you are, you'll love this place. The pizza was awesome and their pazuki (?) was a great way to feel fat. A right out the over cookie with a huge scoop of ice-cream on top. I was upset at the service but that's because our waiter mentioned that another waiter called in sick. Great place to have lunch or dinner and relax."
Shao R.,"Gardena, CA",1,5,2,5.0,4/6/2014,"Very good service, mgr. makes sure that everybody is well taken care of. Food was served very fast considering that the restaurant was very full..One of my fave restaurant in the area."
Mitch I.,"San Pedro, CA",132,49,2,3.0,1/26/2012,"Pizza and Pizookie! Those are the only 2 things I've ever ordered here. Pizookie gets 5 stars. The pizza gets 4 stars. I enjoy deep dish pizza, if you don't, this is not for you. The service gets no stars. Over half the times I've been here they get something wrong.  One time they got my pizza wrong 3 times. Simple order; Medium pizza with meatballs, no tomatoes. First the bring out a pizza with peppers. Then they bring out a pizza with only pepperoni. Next they bring out a pizza with meatballs and tomatoes. 3 wrong order out of 3. By that time i was starving and just picked the tomatoes off and ate it. The manager came over and gave us free soup and a free pizookie for dessert. It was a nice gesture and appreciated but the service is always bad and the orders are always wrong. It can also get to be a very long wait for a table. I suggest calling ahead. They do not take reservations but they will put your name in on a call in. It's pretty much the same thing except you can only call like an hour ahead of the time you come in."
Andrew F.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",400,42,19,4.0,6/11/2014,"One of my favorite restaurants and love the location here. The service is good too, depending on your server. We once waited for a long time to be seated and during our wait, the servers were passing out small slices of pizza! Pretty awesome. The food is on point also. One time our servers were missing up our order and to make up for it, they gave us the meal for free and a free piziokie. And their pizokie is the best desert ever!!"
