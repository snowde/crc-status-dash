Sean D.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,12,1,1.0,3/24/2015,"Went in to have a casual dinner with a friend. Ordered the Cajun pasta which came with two pieces of garlic bread. Upon asking for an extra side order of the garlic bread, a long, hair-like material was on the bread--which I discovered upon biting into it. The waiter took this issue to the manager who only came by to say that the hair-like material wasn't hair but a long thread of lint which was most likely from one of their towels. He only offered more bread or perhaps a dessert. Very poor customer service. I wasn't looking to get my meal comp'd but after ruining my meal, it would seem appropriate that the manager of this establishment take adequate measures to amend this situation--more than assuring that it wasn't hair, but a long piece of lint from their towels. The manager displayed a feeble concern for the resolution of this matter and the satisfaction of his customers."
Monica O.,"Downey, CA",65,102,24,4.0,11/14/2011,Love coming here for the chocolate chunk pizookie it is delicious! Also once a year they have a 2 for $19.95 meal deal which is awesome. The new mini chicken tacos are good and so are the chicken lettuce wraps! I usually get good service when I go.
Ivan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,298,42,5.0,8/15/2012,"For starters, their Spinach Artichoke Dip is amazing! I can't get enough of it. The manager at the time walked by and noticed we were running low on chips and offered to give us more. If you're not one for dip then their Avocado Rolls are just as good - or better. Crunchy and full of flavor. I had their new menu item: The Bacon Cheeseburger with their house sauce. It comes with white cheddar and I opted for Pepperjack, it tasted way better! You can order with steak fries or skinny fries. I got the patty medium well and it was delicious!"
Erika S.,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA",743,32,7,5.0,9/1/2014,"An awesome place to dine.  The desserts are so awesome!  I love having dessert before my food. Great food, great service!"
Brook D.,"Torrance, CA",4,65,7,3.0,7/12/2014,"If you want good food, come here. If you want horrible service along with waiting a long time for food and drinks, also come here! I love the food but every single time I come here (and get a different server) i always end up waiting way too long for everything from the greeting, down to the check! Its ridiculous and I keep coming back in hopes it will be different, but its always the same bad service/experience as before. But the food is good! ..."
Michelle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,27,37,4.0,7/8/2014,It's a little noisey here and the service is slow. They never fail to make good food though. I ended up coming here during the World Cup and it was constant yelling. Not a good place to be at to say the least.
Angela R.,"Torrance, CA",190,312,180,4.0,7/12/2010,"Have I not wrote a review for this? I suppose I haven't!  Well, this is one of the chain places that I can depend on for good food, service and well, countless other things. They have a great amount of televisions all over the place so I can always get a good glance at the score of games. They're pretty nice and accomendating about the games too.  So the food, each time we've gone - we always try to get something new but there's just so much on the menu. Really, it's a pretty diverse piece of work.  We just went last night which is pretty much why I had to check if I had reviewed this place. I had the clam chowder bowl which was okay. The bowl and soup wasn't that great but for some reason the top part of it was buttered and grilled? Delicious! I love their wedge salads here. I love them anywhere. They're pizzas are delicious and just such a great size to share between two.  My boyfriend usually gets something different every time and something extreme to something not, either way - he's always happy. The drinks here are a little pricey but then what chain restaurant isn't? They're all creative and good.  I love coming here and it's pretty decent every time. The service has for the most part been on top of it so I'm glad everytime I walk out."
Sarah K.,"Palos Verdes Estates, CA",0,13,,5.0,4/8/2013,"Decent food if you're in a rush to watch a film at the AMC upstairs. We usually come here for the service and quality drinks. Those bartenders (Franky, Steven, Cora & Tia) are the best in the pouring business--always perfect, always strong and never a hiccup when it comes to quality and service.  A+ BJ's all the way when these kids are serving up the spirits! Thank You & Carry On!"
Calee A.,"Chatsworth, CA",321,155,36,5.0,10/17/2009,"I've been a Bj's fan for many many years. It's all my dad's fault because he loves their beer so we eat here often. I've eaten at numerous Bj's locations from our hometown in Woodland Hills, to Cerritos, to Valencia, to here in Torrance so I'm just going to put all my experiences into one review. What I like to order here: -BBQ beef sandwich with wedged fries -Parmesan chicken w/ mashed potatoes & broccoli -Deep Dish Pizza (any is good..tried the hamburger one recently-tasted like a burger lol) -Caesar salad -Bruschetta (NomNom..) -Spinach artichoke dip..must have. -Avocado eggrolls -Santa Fe Spring Rolls -Fettuccine alfredo w/ chicken  -Pizoooookies! One time my family ordered a oreo/peanut butter/macadamia nut/chocolate chip pizookie platter. It was DEADLY. YUM YUM YUM. The pizookie is Bj's signature dessert. It's a MUST to order here every time you come. Please don't bother buying the garlic bread here as an appetizer. Unless spending $5 on 3 slices of bread is completely fine with you. Do they still even have them as appetizers on the menu? This was a couple years back. My best friend & I always come to this location before we burn off all our calories shopping at Del Amo mall. I can't even count the many times she's gotten hit on over here. One time when we were having lunch, this guy who I thought was our server kept stopping by our table to give us whatever we needed; then I realized he wasn't even our waiter & all of a sudden all these waiters were surrounding our table trying to have a conversation...then he ended up giving my best friend his number. Sorry dude, your breath smelled BUNK! She never called you :( Sorry. My boyfriend loves their beer here. My dad does his best to get him as drunk as possible. Dad orders pitchers full & the beer sampler too. Mark's not a huge drinker, but he likes their hefeweizen. And I remember him saying the Nutty Brewnette tasting like a mix of herbal tea & chocolate & other stuff...gross. I'm not a fan of beer nor do I drink alcohol as much. Oh yeah, there's a full bar. They have happy hour but I forgot what time it's always at. This location is smaller than most I've been to; it gets pretty packed during dinner time / weekends. Loud especially on game nights. Plan ahead & reserve for big parties! There's also seating outside for larger parties (we had one for over 20 people). The service has always been phenomenal (besides that weirdo hitting on my bff) :D"
Quisha H.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",452,528,935,4.0,5/4/2010,"Give me a Berry Burst Cider (ale) and an oreo pizookie and I'm a happy camper! Come during the late night happy hour 10-close (everyday) and all mini-pizzas are half off. Only a dollar off drinks during happy hour though which is why they lose the 1 star. I've always had friendly and attentive service here even during busy hours so i really cant complain about that. Oh and if you're lookin to get more then a little tipsy order ""A Drink Like That"". Taste like an alcoholic jolly rancher BUT you'll probably need help getting to your car if you have more then one because they are pretty strong. :) GO PIZOOKIES!!!"
Matt L.,"Bakersfield, CA",33,24,1,5.0,9/24/2012,"I have been to three different BJ's Restaurants and they are all great. It's hard to write BJ without thinking of something else, but I will do my best. All the food I have tried I would say the Parmesan Crusted Chicken is by far the best. Super tender chicken and the white sauce adds that little extra something.  You wont go wrong with the Pizza, but here is a little tip: If you order the personal pizza 8"" just order the kids pizza.  Its the same exact size and its half the price. I am not a big drinker but BJ's has a nice selection of home brewed beer which is much better than your grandpas can of Miller.  They also brew their own Root beer which is very very good. Come here for the game or food."
Adriana R.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,9,4,5.0,8/8/2015,Our bartender Angela was super awesome! She was on top of things. I really liked how she took care of all her customers around us. Our drinks were delicious and the food came out quickly. We will definitely come back to this BJs.
Marie B.,"Gardena, CA",0,8,2,3.0,8/7/2014,"Good food & a good place to be with friends. However, if you have any plans for a movie or anything else after dinner, this is not the place to eat. I've been here a couple times with my husband we had movie plans after dinner. Our movie didnt start for another 3 hours, so we figured we come here and eat. Its a busy night during Friday & saturday so we figured we wait. It took us an hour and half to get in. Once we were in they didnt have the same menus they had before. The food is good , I do suggest to either order to go or come on a weekday. I will try maybe a different Bj""s."
Tamy H.,"Torrance, CA",86,28,24,5.0,9/28/2013,Great food and great service ! Can't ask for more. Their was a wait to it but it was worth it. I love the avocado roll ! It's a great appetizers or a midnight snacks. I love coming here w/ friends and family. The host Quoc is extremely polite and knows what he is doing .
Sandy Z.,"Sterling Heights, MI",57,129,123,4.0,3/26/2014,Came here with my girlfriend in December 2013. I'm a fan of this place. The lights are dim and the TV's are large. Upon walking in you get that upper class bar feel to it. They had an awesome selection of wine and the staff is friendly yet responsive. The booths are comfy and restrooms clean.
Morgan A.,"Honolulu, HI",34,15,1,4.0,7/29/2014,I always like going to BJ's. They have a wide selection of food and its always good. They have a big selection of beers and cocktails as well. My favorite thing to get is probably the deep dish pizza. My only problem with all BJ's restaurants (not just this one) is the slow service. I understand its a large restaurant and it gets very busy but the service at times is absolutely horrible. I would recommend going after two pm or after 9pm to avoid the crowd. Besides the poor service at times this place is great and a fun to watch a game at with some friends.
Bonita A.,"Torrance, CA",149,7,,4.0,1/31/2014,If you are looking for something for everyone this is the place to go. Many selections on appetizers and entrees and the beer selection is good. Great service and all around good experience.
Kara G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",2,9,2,2.0,1/31/2015,"Collette, the gal who took my phone order for take out, needs help with her customer service soft skills... I didn't realized that taking my simple pizza order was such an inconvenience... Geesh!"
David P.,"Torrance, CA",235,56,,3.0,5/20/2014,"Had a Medium pizza (half great white and Bj's favorite), the cobb salad, and a chicken alfredo pasta for 4 people. The quantity was enough for us, especially since the slices of the pizza are really filling. However I felt as if the quality of the food was not as good as I remembered it to be. The chicken was dry and the Great White was surprisingly not tasty. The service was a little slow which made it more unbearable since I was there with two infants."
Andra C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,20,,4.0,7/18/2015,This is truly a family friendly restaurant. Great food and good customer service. They have some good appetizers. The kids menu is also great.
