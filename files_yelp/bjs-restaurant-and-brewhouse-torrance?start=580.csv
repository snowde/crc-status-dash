bart s.,"Redondo Beach, CA",3,42,1,5.0,5/9/2015,"Long wait tonight (mothers day weekend ), but they brought out free pizza while we waited - NICE TOUCH."
Linda T.,"Long Beach, CA",132,399,69,4.0,12/12/2011,"Pizookie you make me kooky!!!!!  Did I spell it right? I don't know, All I know is that the macadamia nut with white chocolate chunk is effin delicious! This creation from heaven is a divine and generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of a pan of fresh-baked cookie. It was a great way to end my day of chaotic Christmas shopping. Pizookie take me away!"
Shane C.,"Torrance, CA",88,24,1,2.0,3/17/2012,"Although I continue to visit this place from time to time, it's simply that it's close and they have Racer 5 on tap.  Other than that, whether on my own at the bar, or with friends at a table, the service appalling......this from a restuarant that seems to have millions of staff running around, in and out of the kitchen area constantly!  Even with two bartenders, it can take up to ten minutes to get a first drink, when sat there! As a company, I would say that this particular BJ's might be an exception, all being a bad one.  When working in Monrovia, I would frequent the Arcadia BJ's and that place was excellent."
Eli G.,"Los Angeles, CA",2607,1293,3436,2.0,5/18/2009,"Burger #124: A Buttery Lump What did I expect, it's BJ's.  The pizza and pizookies are the only passable items on the menu, yet I felt I needed a burger. Feeling healthy-ish, I ordered the California burger, medium rare, which was described as, ""Our half-pound patty served on sourdough bread, topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing."" Yes, every burger needs mayo AND ranch *rolls eyes*. The bread was actually solid garlic butter that they somehow made to look like real bread. It was soggy, limp, and literally dripping with oil. The meat, bless them for trying, was almost cooked right. It was one of the first times I've seen pink in a big chain type place burger. Needless to say, if I feel like torturing myself again with BJ's, I'll stick with the garbage they're known for."
Jason C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",219,873,511,3.0,10/11/2009,"I had lunch with a friend here after she recommended it.  We went, got seated, we waited about five minutes before someone came to us to take our drink orders.  By this time, we were ready to order and ordered our food. I had lunch special personal pizza with one topping and wedge salad.  I ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  My friend ordered the 1/2 sandwich and soup with wedge fries.   The soup was excellent!  The salad was good as well.  The salad wedge was topped with bacon, blue cheese and green onions.  The pizza was made with their chunky sauce and five cheese.  I ordered mine with meatball.   I would come back again.  They have lot of different types of food and the fact that this is a sports bar, its a nice touch!"
Annette M.,"Anaheim, CA",6,53,86,5.0,9/29/2011,"I LA LA LA LOOOVE BJ's and especially this location--aside from my bfs football team winning on our anniversary weekend (thus he is in a grrreat mood) the service here was amazing, I will update with the girls name but she was this cute pale skinned girl with black hair (had kinda a unique look about her).  We got to take advantage of the football Sunday deal they had going and drank drank and watched football. We ate at the bar area and suited well with the humongous flat screen tv.  They have the NFL channel so that was a bigg plus! And of course the AMAZING food such as: -best beginnings -great mini pizza -mini tacos (come in 2) -PAZOOKIE (choc chip) Great location, plenty of parking, amazing customer service, A++++"
Cheri A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1193,1551,3888,4.0,5/29/2009,I came here a few weeks ago for a quick bit to eat at the bar at lunchtime. The place was dead...I think there was only 2 other tables but it was a week day and it is in the Del Amo Mall. We shared the ANGUS ROAST BEEF DIP  which was really good.  The service was slow but I think the bartender/server just kept forgetting he had anyone or maybe he was the cook too. :)
Rina C.,"Carson, CA",137,13,3,4.0,10/21/2013,"Sweet pig pizza and the ahi seared tuna salad is delicious! I go there at least 2x a month. Also, their pizookie is great to end the meal. I like the Oreo flavor."
Corey S.,"City of Industry, CA",20,6,1,1.0,5/13/2014,Worst service ever for a BJs. Waiter stood around talking to his friends while customers needed service.
Joseph H.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,103,23,1.0,11/14/2011,"Ate here on a Saturday night as a friend was visiting from the Bay Area. He was down in Orange County so I settled on a half-way meeting at a risk-free place. I should have found a Cheesecake Factory. I will never eat at anothe BJs again. This location at 9PM was heavily populated by 8th graders and teenagers. They behaved themselves, but I just thought you should know, if you were considering going here for something closely resembling romance (and if you were, you need to check yourself). Our server was overloaded. I don't blame her for taking 10 minutes to give me a water refill to the point where I had to walk to the host-island and ask someone to fill it themselves. But it did piss me off (but I didn't take it out of her tip). Who were worse, and ensured I won't step foot in here or another BJ's again (as an econ professor in college put so poetically: there is no reason to return to a bad restaurant when there is so much market competition) were the male servers. I only took one trip to the men's bathroom but had to literally dodge two of them invading my personal space by walking macho - one on the way there who was ready to run me over with a tray of food, and another on the way back as I was turning the corner, as if he was running a red light. Let me try to tell you the impression both of these gave me: if these two guys behaved this way to me on the streets, they would do it expecting to start a fight. Why on Earth would you give a patron the impression you not only don't give a damn about them, but that in another time and place, you are actually starting shit? Who on Earth employs such people?  I don't care that you are working at 9PM on a Sat. night. I don't care how overworked you are and that you don't get paid enough. Who hasn't felt that way before? Only losers don't rise above it and perform their job with class instead of passively-aggressively taking it out on someone (me) who doesn't think its worth it to knock your tray of food onto the floor to prove my point. Or maybe you were looking for that so you could get take out your anger at me instead of at the gym?  They were not doing their job of ""treating"" a guest, and BJ's isn't either by employing disrespectful thugs with aprons. As if the manager there gives a shit. Oh and they can't even cut a pizza right."
Princess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,273,176,3.0,3/18/2014,The food was good and i really like their varied menu. It kind of reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory minus the cheesecake... insert Pizookis. Our server was fun and playful. Parking is free but it gets busy.
Matthew D.,"San Diego, CA",6,49,,5.0,12/20/2011,"Came in for a lunch special.  Had the good fortune of being waited on by Virian.  The food was excellent.  Tried the all you can eat Soup and Salad special.  The Caesar Salad had crisp lettuce and a sublime amount of dressing, not drowning everything and not just dry lettuce.  Broccoli and Cheddar soup was a bit on the heavy side, but it was excellent pub fare.   The reason for 5 stars is the service.  Virian made excellent suggestions in terms of entrees and drinks.  She was in the section attending to tables, making small talk, and getting tables cleared.  I was very impressed with her skill, and I will come back again for the food and for the excellent service."
Diann S.,"Torrance, CA",72,62,18,4.0,5/11/2012,"Your pizza and beer  maybe the staple but come on. Don't just forgo to prices of drinks and be very detailed on the extra costs of toppings.  Our waitress was awesome, and very attentive."
Stephanie A.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,12,1,3.0,6/21/2014,"Amazing food, terrible service. The food is always great and consistent, the menu is very large and offers an array of options for everyone. Definitely leave room for dessert! Their pizookies are to die for! Be prepared to WAIT. The service is incredibly slow, even for a sit down restaurant. The drinks take a long time, even if it's just waters, the food takes a long time even the desserts take long. Servers like to disappear so be sure to ask for everything you're going to need when they are at the table. 0 stars for service, 5 stars for food= 3 stars."
Lina C.,"Los Alamitos, CA",22,35,15,3.0,3/25/2014,"I really like Bj's restaurants. However, I did not have the best experience here tonight. It was my first time at this location, and I'm honestly disappointed. The food was mediocre, but the ribs were delicious. My issue was with our server. For starters, after taking out orders, he disappeared for a good 15-20 minutes. It took forever to get our drinks, and even longer for the food to come. A friend of mine had ordered a soup, and he didn't get it until his meal came, because they forgot about it. Then after waiting for what seemed like ages to get our bill, our server finally appeared with our bill, only to disappear again for another 10 minutes. Like I said, great restaurant. Only problem was this location. Food and service could have been better."
Kelly E.,"New York, NY",107,372,48,2.0,2/23/2010,"What should be a 3 star based on food is reduced to a mere 2 star because of horrible service.  First off, I've been to other BJs so I know it takes a CRAZY long time waiting in line (even with reservations) so I understand it should take a while. Even so, it was almost a 2 hour wait... With reservation? What?? Wound up getting the gigantic appetizer sampler to share with my group which was pretty good (super fattening = A-okay with me).  Bad service interlude: rude waitress who did not want to take our orders kept ignoring us when we asked for refills on drinks. Sighhh. Anyway, got a few large pizzas which were standard, a step above dominos/papa johns but not quite something I would have an urge for again. the Pizzokie is where it's at, honestly I can't believe they're the only restaurant to serve this kind of thing! I make these at home all the time, but BJs does have a pretty delicious one. If it's your birthday you're suppsoed to get a free one BUT that's if you have a nice waitress D: All in all, if you want to try a BJs, I wouldn't suggest this one. You'll be full but definitely NOT satisfied because of the service. Pooo."
B D.,"Wailuku, HI",0,20,28,2.0,7/19/2015,"Ordered a small order of thin fries they came to the table cold. Told the server he took them and returned with a smaller portion still cold. My daughter and I both ordered pasta. My angel hair pasta was like eating bland top ramen with shrimp pieces that were dusted with a seasoning, frozen broccoli steamed and placed on top with sprinkled parmesan cheese. It was so bland I tried to enjoy it. I asked our server for more parmesan cheese but never received it. I used more salt than I care too and ate about 1/3 because I was so hungry. My daughters shrimp scampi also had the top ramen noodle effect. They must pre cook the pasta and use it as needed. It was very soggy on its way out. Trying to get our server to give us a check I finally decided to go up to the payment cubby to track him down to pay. The meal was pretty crappy, service just okay, it felt weird paying $60.00 bucks for less than average food. I did tip though."
Golan B.,"Los Angeles, CA",39,41,8,5.0,5/8/2014,While working in the area I was craving middle eastern food. Found this place on yelp and went. The service was very good and the food was delicious. The chicken shawarma is recommended.
Emily A.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/10/2014,"I honestly don't like pizza that much but BJ's makes me think otherwise!  The service here is welcoming and all the waiters always have a smile on their face.  They have great desserts (I highly recommend the new ""Salted Caramel Pizookie) and their drinks are great! BJ's is a great family friendly resturant."
Ashley A.,"San Bernardino County, CA",694,255,47,5.0,12/12/2011,The BJs Pizza & Build your own pizza are the best! Their seafood Jambalaya is delish! I love their soups on sourdough bread and I definitely recommend their PIZOOOOOKIE!  BJs youve done me well!
