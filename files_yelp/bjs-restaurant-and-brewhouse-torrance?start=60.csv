Nicole B.,"Santa Monica, CA",724,576,391,5.0,7/26/2016,"I am not really sure why this location has bad reviews! I come here often and whenever I do, I know that I am sure to have a great time and a great meal.  What I like most about BJ's is that they have a very extensive menu; lots of cocktails, beers, appetizers, salads, pastas, etc. There is something for everyone and you can rest assured knowing that whatever you order will be tasty! They have a small bar area and a really big dinning room with TVs everywhere!!! Great place to grab a drink or a quick bite to eat after shopping at the Del Amo mall!!"

Brett M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,98,36,3.0,11/16/2016,I love the BJ's Hefeweizen. My wife loves the BJ's Blonde. Chips and Salsa appetizer was very good.  Salsa was nice and fresh. My daughter got the Golden Beet and Arugula salad.  She loved the freshness and quality of the salad.  My wife usually orders that salad and loves it too. My wife and I shared the Garlic Chicken and Pesto Tavern Cut pizza.  I was disappointed in the pizza because only two slices (the ones in the middle) had any sort of toppings and freshness to them.  The rest of the slices were dry and minimal toppings.  The crust was dry and crunchy which was not tasty.  I prefer thin crust to thick crust when it comes to pizza but when you order these tavern cut pizzas it seems like you will only get two slices of pizza that have the toppings on them and can actually enjoy. The service was a bit slow too.  When we sat down in the bar area it took over 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and ask if we wanted anything.   Love the bar area.  Plenty of tv's with different college football games on.  That was enjoyable.
Oswaldo O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/20/2017,"***RAT INFESTATION***  I was dining with my fiancée and her friend last night when we saw a RAT run from under a booth where other people were eating.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first, but then the RAT ran from under one table to the next throughout the bar area and eventually headed into their kitchen!  The girls and myself were beyond disgusted to think that we just ate food from a place that has a RAT problem.  Paola was our server, and she was very attentive.  However, after we told her about the RAT things got even worse!  She told us that she saw one the day before as well, which confirms that they are there.  She also said that she would tell the manager, but the closing manager never acknowledged us or the fact that we just pointed out the this BJ's has a RAT problem.  She never came by our table, she never apologized for how grossed out we were by it, and she probably is not going to do anything about the RATS.                   ***AVOID AT ALL COSTS***"
Vinh T.,"Lawndale, CA",87,54,7,2.0,2/16/2017,"Ummm first time here. The foods is ok? But the services was horrible to me. First.... after order the drinks. Server ask if we need any appetizer. Well hello? We just seat down?. The food come out quick. So that's a good..... they didn't give me the small plate so I ask the server. Dude told me "" hold on sir"" if you're a professional server you should have said "" sure what you need sir? And I will be right back with your request"" so he interrupted me right away..... no very good. After the diner. We told the server that we need one box and the check. He come back with the check and no box. Then again he come back asking if we are done with the check without my to go box. Ummm the place is not busy FYI. So not sure why is take him forever to just grabs me a to go box. Very bad........ not Coming back here again in the near future. Server name is Ivan"
Scott S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",705,553,1851,3.0,1/3/2016,"The review I would give this restaurant is pretty much the same review that I would give to any BJ's location around the L.A., OC area. It is a large, well-designed space made up of a lot of booths and some tables. The food is as expected -- just like all the other BJ's. It is pizza based restaurant and is pretty good. In fact, I'm am a big fan of the various pizzas at BJ's. They do have other offerings but pizza is their primary focus and it has been my experience that is always the best choice when you eat here. They also have a nice selection of beers which, of course, go well with pizza.  As is the case with all BJ's the staff here is nice and friendly. How good your service will be is highly dependent upon who your server is.  Just like all the other BJ's this place can get very-very crowded.  When it is, expect a very loud and chaotic atmosphere. So, the best time to go is on the off hours.  In terms of food, this location offers a breakfast menu. The breakfast dishes are mostly pizza styled entrees. Which is the best way to go. They do have traditional Americana style breakfast; i.e.: eggs, bacon, and pancakes, but the one time I ordered this, my eggs arrived supremely cold. Not good! So, my suggestion is to stay with what BJ's does best, pizza style food.  This BJ's is right off of two large outdoor parking lots in the outdoor section of the Del Amo Fashions Center, so though these too can get full and crowded, parking is generally not too much of an issue.  Overall, BJ's is BJ's, eat here if you want some good pizza and beer."
Mark M.,"Torrance, CA",119,30,23,5.0,10/22/2016,"This place is awesome! Great beers/food, incredible bartenders (Ricki & Mario) friendly staff, couldn't ask for more. Their craft brews are delicious!  Everyone was wonderful from the greeters to the bartenders, servers etc. and went out of their way to make me feel welcome......customer service is alive and well at BJ's!!!!!! I'll  be back many times......."
Alexia L.,"Lawndale, CA",168,2,,1.0,7/20/2017,While I was eating I saw a rat.. and I told the server and she acted like it was a regular occurrence. Gross
Yvonne M.,"Richmond, VA",223,625,785,5.0,3/18/2016,"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants. I was in Cali, and went to this location. I came in with a party of 4, but changed to 6 and they were super accomodating about the last minute xhange and it was literally just a 5 minute wait. The server we had was great, she was there to keep us happy and came by just enough.  The appetizers: we chose the avocado egg rolls. These were warm and tasty. We also had my favorite spinach artichoke dip. Omg I could have licked the bowl.  Entrees: I chose the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was the perfect level if heat in your mouth. The serving size was huge..I couldnt even eat all of it. The bread that came with my meal was so good I wanted to ask for a couple more to take home. Libations: I had a ""tickled link"" cocktail.. it was so good, it had absolut vidka, chambord black rasberry liquer, peach snapps and pineapple & cranberry juice. (Sounds good right??) Im looking forward to going back and trying sonething else soon."
Reyes V.,"Gardena, CA",29,23,2,2.0,11/10/2017,"I haven't been to BJs, in a while, but it was my son birthday so I wanted to get him a pizookie. We arrived and got seated right away, took a while for them to greet us, but I noticed our server had around 7 tables he was taking care plus one was a large party, so from there I k we service would be slow. The food we ordered was great we both got pizzas , they were yummy, pepperoni for my son, and I got the chicken ranch. I giving this place a 2 for the simple fact , that I told them it's my son's birthday if they can sing for him. It took them like 20 minutes just to bring the pizookie, and literally all the server did was bring it out and say happy birthday and left. Lol. Unless they dint celebrate birthdays or Singh happy birthday. He did not make it important. We ate the pizookies, took s while for the bill to come and left. It sucked they really didn't acknowledge my son's birthday besides a cold  happy birthday, so not memorable."
Addie G.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,9,10,5.0,7/14/2017,"My favorite bartender Lauren is THE BEST. Super friendly and knowledgeable, she has taken care of us a few times and I have literally come back to the bar just to see her, she makes our visits so enjoyable. Ask for Lauren, you won't be disappointed."
Cindy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,68,113,3.0,3/19/2017,"Good place to come with the family but when you order the rib eye steak get prepared to get a steak full of fat. I ordered the rib medium well with Brussels sprouts and asparagus, the Brussels sprouts were  over cooked and mushy. I asked the waitress Anissa for a new order and she brought me a new one, the second order was the same thing. So I asked Anissa to bring more asparagus once she brought it I was done my meal. Anissa was very friendly, and overall experience was good. My suggestion, order something different."
David T.,"Gardena, CA",65,297,471,5.0,7/27/2016,awesome clam chowder in bread bowl.  The bread portion was delicious.  During brunch they serve $4.00 mimosa.
sambriddhi w.,"Fort Belvoir, VA",8,24,22,1.0,4/11/2017,"Worst BJ's I have ever been to.... food is decent but cold and service is Horrible!!! I have been to about 5 of these, but this location sucks!!! I called the manager over to talk to him and he could have cared less... appetizer came with meal and kids spaghetti came without sauce... WTF!!!"
Robert C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5,22,12,3.0,11/12/2017,"It was my Wife's birthday on Veteran's day and we were out running errands till after 2:00 when we thought we'd grab a bite to eat at BJ's.  Even in the afternoon it was crowded!  It's first time If been to BJs and I was pleasantly surprised, the food was good,  a decent beer selection and reasonably priced.  The service wasn't great, since they were super busy otherwise I'd rate it with more stars."
Patty A R.,"Mission Viejo, CA",426,276,348,1.0,2/22/2017,One hour and forty five minutes for a couple burgers and a pizza. Why? It took 15 minutes just to get water! The service was horrible. Pizza was cold and like rubber. No apologies or alternatives given. Good bye-
Steve N.,"Torrance, CA",954,942,1365,4.0,12/31/2015,"BJ's is always a nice place to stop in while walking through the Del Amo Mall in Torrance. There are definitely many options to choose from as you're walking through the outside area, but BJ's won't disappoint! You have your choice of sitting outside on the patio or inside where there are several booths and small seats in their bar area. This location is along the Del Amo mall on the Carson side right across from the Vegas seafood buffet. The wife and I come here at night after work to order some food and a flight of beers. If you like deep dish style pizzas, they serve a variety of different pizzas with sizes and toppings of your choice. The one thing I do suggest is to save some room for dessert, as they serve a warm cookie pizza (what they deem a ""pizookie"") with a scoop of vanilla/chocolate ice cream. It's honestly the only reason we try not to order too much food when we come here!"
Scott b.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,35,,2.0,9/3/2017,"The food & beverages are good.  The wait staff is poorly managed.  As in very poorly managed.  Staff just walked back & forth without helping each other.  Sat for 10 mins with no one asking for drinks, 10 more mins after the food arrived with no forks/napkins (and it was 20+ mins from ordering), and ask for a wine that showed 2 on the menu & the staff said none available.  I had to walk to the bar to get it. I used the app to add to the list and we were seated for 20 mins and then got a text our table was now available.  As I write this I'm even less thinking we would  go back.  if you go sit at the bar, they were helpful."
Abe G.,"Torrance, CA",37,3,,2.0,11/19/2017,Wait was nearly an hour on a Saturday night. Once seated it took server about 10-15 to get our drinks order and we were then rushed to order right then and there. Appetizer came out quick and some food came out before the pizza. Pizza was not served with the cheese and peppers (should be a given) no ketchup for fries offered either.. server then rushed our table and other tables to pay our tabs before she would head out to her lunch break.. assuming she wanted to keep all of the tips to herself.. she was pleasant but a little all over the place.. I've been over this restaurant but get their pizza cravings here and there.. won't be back for a while though.. not worth the wait.
Jayson M.,"Hawthorne, CA",391,90,82,1.0,5/23/2016,"Came here for a late night snack since I just landed back from a long flight. Called at 11 regarding last calls which was 5 minutes before closing time. The employee on the phone was nice and she seemed well informed of their policy. Got there around 1115ish and asked for a table of two after waiting about 5 mins for someone to approach us. A man and woman walked up and told us the bar area was open, but we didn't want to sit at the bar so we asked if we can sit at a table. He then ignored our request and said the bar area is open? My friend and I was confused. We told them we called earlier. The guy proceeded to tell us the dining area is closed at 11, and the bar area is only open up until last call. Then he looked at the girl and they started to whisper something to each other and the girl looked confused. It was pretty awkward for us standing there while they whispered to eachother. I feel like the girl wanted to seat us in the dining area, but the guy didn't. I didn't want to make it a bigger issue than it was so I just decided to sit at the bar area to find an open table and to our convenience, all the tables were dirty, but he called someone over to clean it pretty quickly. seated and ordered right away with Raymond. He didn't seem too enthusiastic while taking us. We got the two for $25 deal which consisted of a pizza, pizookie, and soup or salad for us both. We asked to just make everything at the same time and just to bring out whatever came out first because we knew it was late. Raymond didn't really understand and kind of gave an attitude saying ""can I bring out the soup and salad first?"" And I kept repeating myself and he kept repeating himself lol. After the whole ordeal he understood. I just didn't want him to wait on us finishing our pizza to start making the pizookie since it was already 1130 and they close at 12.  Everything was fine except my Caesar salad. It was funny because there was literally only ONE crouton on my salad. (Refer to my picture) I was literally so baffled at how there can only be ONE crouton. And this was literally the cherry on top of everything that has unfolded so far. I was discouraged to eat it, but I just landed from a long flight and just ignored it. I was going to ask for some more croutons, but no one came around until the pizza and pizookie came out which came out at the same time which was perfect. At this point I just wanted to get out of there which I asked for the check when the pizza came. I paid right away, and tipped 40% of the bill just for my memorable bad experience.  Raymond peeped the tip amount after returning with a Togo box for the pizza. We could tell his mood changed and seemed a little more happy to serve us which he then offered another refill of lemonade lol. Don't wanna get into that. But yea left the establishment and looked around to see that we were not the last customer there. Yay. ANYWAYS! I wanted to inquire to management about what their policy was regarding their dining area hours for future reference, but I came to a conclusion that I just shouldn't come anymore. I was a server part time and understood everything that was going on. I would never treat customers any different even if they came in one minute before last calls. Treat them how you want to be treated! Thanks BJs!"
