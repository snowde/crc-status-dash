Shelly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,38,1.0,5/1/2014,"Went for lunch time, why did I do this slowwwwww service good waiter named Chaz but I was so pissed about my service the manager asks me do I want a dang Pazooki..Heck No, just give me my $61 lunch bill so I can leave before my husband begins  talk or curse becsuse i had to contain myself.How sad it wasn't even crowded and #$@!

Lenore B.,"Carson, CA",313,129,548,2.0,4/13/2011,"OK, First of all this place has horrible service! Every time i came here something goes wrong... The Servers rarely refill your drinks, you have to beg them too. One time i came here i asked for ranch 3x, and then they decide to give it to me an hr later when my meal was already gone... I like the Cerritos Location MUCH better. The wait time isn't worth it here for the kind of service you will be getting. TRUST!!"
Eunice C.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,17,8,1.0,5/23/2015,"i came here with my friends, just a table for four. we waited outside in the cold for an hour and finally the buzzer ""rang"". we ran in and went to the desk and gave them the buzzer. the lady behind the desk said ""sorry we just sat somebody down in your booth. the wait will be two minutes."" so we got a seat inside the restaurant and sat here for about a good 10 minutes. we finally went up to them and asked what's going on and how long it'll take, and they said ""oh we're sorry the buzzer takes a while to buzz when people are outside. so we sat someone else. just wait maybe 5-10 minutes and a table will open shortly."" WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR 30 MINUTES.  the reason why they probably did that? because we're just unimportant high schoolers who don't matter. i get that we're young but that's no reason to belittle us. we'll be in college next year, full fledged adults. great thing, our society."
James H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",90,18,2,1.0,9/25/2013,"Just walked into BJs for my son's school fundraiser at 6:30 pm, and it was a 45 minute wait for 2 of us for mediocre food.  NOPE!  The hostess was also rude and should be busing tables not greeting guests.  Bad choice for the school fundraiser. Thank goodness there was no wait at PF Changs."
Alma M.,"Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles, CA",29,64,26,1.0,4/10/2013,"¡WARNING! Bad service  If I could I would not even give them one star but since I have to I did .. Anyway where can I start?.. Hmm I asked the waiter about a few drinks & he said ""I'm not 21 so I don't know "" really!? Shouldn't you know what you're selling anyway? But Whatever is not his fault he wasn't required to learn the menu & is also not his fault he is not an alcoholic like us lol but anyway moving on to the worse part!!! We order our food & 20 minutes later the waiter comes out to say ""your loaded / baked potato , will take longer but your food is coming .. 25 min pass and the birthday girl has not gotten her dish & the waiter never stopped by to see if we needed anything so we were a bit fed up and we finally got up and called him, he finally comes to our table ,so we went ahead and cancel the potato and her food because after an hour she was over dinner. We asked to speak to the manager   , of course to only wait another 10 Minutes for her to have the decency of walking to our table , by this time I was already pissed off & all she said was ""oh its your birthday? im sorry you dont have to pay for your plate"" uh hello she never got her plate why would she have to? so then she offers us a complimentary dessert, that by the way took quite a while , I literally wanted to cry :'o I've been to very cheap places & I've been treated like a queen! Just like I've also been to 5 star restaurants where I've had 5 start service too , so I'm sure I know how I'm supposed to be treated and how long my food is supposed to take on a tuesday night! i would have waited 2 hours if the waiter would of kept the drinks coming and checking up on us! the fact that he didnt have our food was not a reason to ignore us !!  All I can say stay away front this place !!!!!!!! This was my first and last time at a Bjs restaurant , never again will I enter this place . Save yourself the bad moment and go to a better place for basically the same price, I can't deny the food was tasty but the service was the worse I've had !!"
Tiffany C.,"Gardena, CA",120,4,,1.0,9/16/2011,"Just came here last saturday night and it was a horrible dinner. First it was an hour wait just to get a cramped spot in a corner booth when it was 5 of us. Then it was and hour wait for them to serve our food! They served one plate, then two more. When the other two came, it was all screwed up! smfh. Not to mention my spagetti was cold and lacked much flavor.  Can you say Disaster? The manager had to come atleast 3 times, and solved nothing. 3 diff waiters and they were clueless. What really topped it off was when we get the bill, they charged double for the order they messed up and said they took off 1. Noooo they really didnt, they just wanted to get the money for it anyway thinking we wouldnt check. After all of that, all they give us is a $20 GIFTCARD (as if I'll ever be back), and we simply gave them exact change.   HORRIBLE A** PLACE!!!"
Lorri N.,"Lawndale, CA",0,4,,1.0,4/4/2013,"Tonight we discovered what it was like to just get up and leave a resturant because apparently we were invisible. After entering  BJ's Torrance at 5:00pm we were seated, and that is when we became invisible. Servers walked right by us to take orders for the newly seated tables next to us, but ignored us as we tried to get thier attention. On the third pass we stopped the waitress and mentioned our concern and her reply was that we were not her table. So out of three tables next to one another, we were in the wrong spot. She didn't offer to help us, just left us there. We waited for another 5 min and then decided to get up and leave. What the restaurant has transformed into over the past six months has been a gradual decline in service, food quality and helpful attitude by it's staff. The management had better wake up and focus on what it takes to make customers come back...they have lost the focus and sadly that leads to...customer invisibility. Russ C"
Alex P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,70,5,1.0,6/19/2015,"So slow! 50 minutes after my family and I ordered our food, most of it finally arrived; and not even complete. Had to ask for the ordered salad dressing multiple times, and for silverware. The biggest disappointment, after we got most of the food, the kids Mac and cheese took ANOTHER 10 minutes to come (it looked like the kind from out of the box, and was dry)  for a grand total of an hour until all of our order was fulfilled. The food was good, but not worth the frustration of an hour wait."
Tiffany S.,"Cerritos, CA",6,88,134,4.0,5/1/2012,"At the torrance location, the staff is very friendly.  The atmosphere is pretty chill and it's a good place to be with friends and family.  There are huge televsions to watch sports.  BJ's has a decent selection of food and it tastes good.  Their specialty is the chicago style pizza.  My favorite is the sweet pig, which is pineapples and ham.  There is also vegetarians items.  The portions are big, but make sure to leave room for dessert. The puzookie is an excellent choice, try the one with macadamia.  Another dessert option is the beignet-- a lighter option but still delicious."
Tara K.,"Carmel, IN",167,462,5,4.0,4/5/2011,"I always love coming here.  I work across the street and it's my go-to choice for a near-by restaurant. They have a large menu with alot of variety.  One of their specialities is the deep dish pizza.  The mini or small deep dish with meatballs is my standard order.  The crust is super delicious!  And, the mini with 1 topping  plus a side salad is included in their lunch specials for $5, which is an excellent deal.  And, you must get the OREO pizzookie for dessert!  It's a cookie cooked in a pan, served warm with ice cream on top (and probably some crack because it's super addictive - don't even try to share it!).  It comes in many flavors, but the OREO is the best! The restaurant is large and I've never had to wait for a table at lunch time.  But, the service can be very slow.  The only way to get in and out in less than an hour is to put your food order in right away with the drinks.  And, the pizzookie can take some time to make, so if you're in a hurry, ask for it before you finish your entree!"
Sylvia G.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,95,1,3.0,5/25/2011,I'm generally a fan of a lot of the food that they have at BJ's. I've never had any problems with any of the food at this location - always good. This place is just always PACKED though. And the waiting area is pretty small considering how packed it always is. They also seem to run out of the pagers when I'm there and there's no room to wait inside so we have to wait outside and go back and check when they tell us to. The service here is slow. They aren't mean or bad but it's just slow. Takes a while for your server to come to your table and takes a while for your order. It always seems like they are a bit short staffed. It's also unbelievably slippery in there. I seriously am scared to go in there sometimes if I'm wearing the wrong shoes because maneuvering yourself to get to the table without falling on your face seems like way too much trouble.
Madison L.,"Torrance, CA",0,24,11,3.0,5/7/2015,"I have always been a fan of BJs (this location specifically) but my last two visits have sucked. Service has always been terrible but my visit this week was awful! -Called for a reservation and was told that they were no longer taking reservations for that day. So party of 6, we wait on a Monday evening. -Hostess said she will let us know the ET for waiting, did not check and had to be asked multiple times.  -Finally was told 45 minutes, we actually wound up waiting almost 2 hours because they accidentally sat one person at the 9 person table. -Server was slow  -Cousin orders a beer, they are out of it. He orders house beer, they are out of it. -Appetizer came out LATE, with our meal. -I ordered veggie pizza with BBQ sauce, server had the HARDEST time understanding that. Came back twice to ask where I wanted the BBQ sauce and if I wanted cheese and then toppings on it. wtf... -My pizza was not hot at all, but warm and soggy :( Really overall, not a good night!"
Craig K.,"Torrance, CA",2,12,4,1.0,3/16/2014,"Got to the restaurant Sunday morning at 11:15. Restaurant was about 1/4 full. Ordered around 11:30, took them until 12:10 to make one hamburger, a small pizza, an omelette and pancakes. Food was good, but not worth an hour wait. Too many other options in the nearby area to make it worth eating here. Stacked, Johnny rockets, and lazy dog are all much faster options, especially if you are in a time crunch."
Martin S.,"San Pedro, CA",311,365,158,3.0,2/1/2012,"While having tires put on my car at the Sears auto center my options to kill an hour were A) Stroll around the Del Amo Mall or B) have a beer at one of the chains in the area.  I of course chose to grab a beer at BJ's.  The place beats the heck out of the depressing lounge area of the auto center and they have a good selection of craft beers. They had a belgian that I wasn't familiar with ""Maredsous 8"" Really good stuff.  The food on the other hand was pretty blah. I had the angus sliders. Pretty f-ink bland. The fries we're nice but the little burgers could have used some help. Meh, thats why I normally don't do the chains for food.  So in summation my little wet nosed puppies. Go for a drink, eat at your own risk. Oh, The bartender was very helpful and on top of things. So yeah, they've got the service thing down.  Cheers"
Ryan R.,"Carson, CA",47,15,2,1.0,4/9/2011,This place has shit service I hate having to hunt down waiters and to see them hanging out and completely ignoring customers. The food gets to your table semi warm -00 points... Rank place.... Why would anyone go here!?!
Elaine H.,"Irvine, CA",137,237,15,4.0,1/21/2012,"I wasn't really a big fan of BJ's before, but my most recent trip was pretty satisfying.  I went during lunch time and right now, they have some pretty nice lunch specials along with $2.99 appetizer deals. The bill comes out to be less than $15 including tip for 2 people.  Not bad...not bad at all."
G. C.,"Torrance, CA",27,80,10,1.0,12/17/2013,Came here on a Monday night for my sons bday. Normal crowd for a restaurant. They get my sons order wrong. A cheese pizza. Then it takes forever to get a new one. I honestly think they forgot. Then while they are eating they as if he wants his surprise poozokie and I state no because he has to eat first. Then another waitress comes bye with a poozokie asking if he wants one. I clearly state my kids need to eat their dinner before offering them a desert.  Finally my son for his birthday receives his food. Thanks but no thanks BJ's of Torrance.
Toyo K.,"Long Beach, CA",120,440,641,5.0,11/14/2013,"I've been here a few times before with a smaller group and always left satisfied, but last night I made a reservation for 16 people.  After reading some of the bad reviews I was expecting subpar service, but let me just say I was very, very satisfied with the night.  My reservation was for 7pm, and by 7:10pm half the group showed up so they seated us.  At first, the manager came by and took our drinks and eventually our waiter came in (we were seated in a side room that was aside from the main floor) and took our orders.  I noticed it took some time for the waiter to come by throughout the night but I figured it was because he was really busy and our room was secluded  so it was fine.  It also would've helped if he had the utensils ready when the food came, but he got everything in order so we weren't waiting too long.  This place doesn't add on the extra gratuity for large parties, and in the end he split up all of our checks individually.  That was a nice gesture, and I left a good tip and made sure the manager knew our waiter did an excellent job."
Cathy N.,"Long Beach, CA",507,499,148,4.0,12/12/2011,"LOVE the food here. Service could be a teeny bit better - but overall, always a good experience. I recommend the sampler platter if you've got 3 - 4 people in your group. It'll disappear in pretty much an instant. OH, and FYI - two large pizzas provide plenty of food for 4 very hungry, growing, big boys..."
Clara L.,"Granada Hills, CA",223,138,14,4.0,4/17/2011,"Busy busy busy, but yummyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!! Their avocado egg rolls are sooooooooo delicious, they're warm and the portions are big!!! Coming here and leaving without eating a pizookie should be a crime!!"
