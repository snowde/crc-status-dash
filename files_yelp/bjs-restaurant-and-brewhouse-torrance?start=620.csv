Lisa M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1079,909,1293,2.0,12/20/2008,"So I love BJs. Their pizza, beer, potato wedges, love the food. I have to say though, I've been here maybe half a dozen times since it's opened, and this particular branch's service SUCKS. With a capital S. The last time I was here, I came on a Thursday night and the wait was over an hour long. I was already irritable from watching people eat when I was starving, so by the time we were seated it felt like my stomach was eating itself. Our waitress started out nice and competent enough, but taking our order was the only thing she did right. She forgot to bring the bf's beer, and didn't even remember it until she brought the check and realized her mistake. AND she didn't apologize!! ""Oh did I ever bring you your beer? hmmmm oops."" Oops? how nice.  Now, we know how the service for the pizza is supposed to work because another previous dining experience got us a free pizookie for POOR service again. When you order pizza, your waiter is supposed to bring you the pizza stand and plates right away. Our waitress neglected to do this. Also when they bring the pizza, they're supposed to cut it up and put it on the plates for you. If you try to do it yourself, the pizza gets all messed up, which is what happened to us. The manager saw us struggling and apologized, saying it's the server's job to do that for us. SOOO of course our waitress didnt do that, nor did she offer to help us when we were once again struggling. We had to ask her for her help, and she seemed pissed that we even bothered her. When she brought the check, we only got one copy of the receipt. No customer's copy. Coooooooooooooooooool. We were looking for the manager to super complain about how crappy of a dining experience this was, and HE was nowhere to be found either. I don't think I've ever had worse service than this. Ever. I'm sooooooo disappointed in this place now, and it totally marrs how good the food is. Why, BJs. WHY!?"
Patrick Jay R.,"Torrance, CA",41,19,3,1.0,3/22/2014,Went here for a friend's b day party and the food was awesome but the service was horrible!
Niel W.,"Gardena, CA",1,20,5,1.0,3/19/2014,"I decided to give this place another try. The first time was when it first opened. It was crowded on a Tuesday night. A friend and I patiently waited and got our table in about 30 mins. We never had a waiter come by. In about 15 minutes, the hostess came over and suggested we order at the bar if we wanted faster service. She then sits us at another table near the bar! Same thing, no waiter and not even a glass of water... We finally just decided to go else where. Super poor service & the food isn't good enough to put up with that BS! There are a lot of cooler, tastier restaurants that are smaller with a way better vibe and menu in Culver City. Try the City Tavern."
Stephanie B.,"Victorville, CA",0,3,,1.0,5/20/2015,Went there last week. One of worst experiences.  Bad food. Bad service.  OVERPRICED. NEVER AGAIN
Mike S.,"Lomita, CA",56,36,8,2.0,2/24/2014,"This rating is really a toss up of a 1 or a 2 star for me...I have been here a few other times with my wife and some friends, and the last time we were in a big group(over 10 people) it wasnt bad, not great, but wasnt bad.... The last time it was my wife and son, it was horrible...We called to make a reservation, told on the phone there will be no wait.  When we got there it was a ten minute wait, totally not a big deal.  We got seated and few our son his dinner, as he wont eat the stuff on their menu, and we sat there.  He ate his entire dinner and no one came up to us.  I went to the front and asked if they had a record of when were were seated, we were there for over 20 min and not one person stopped at our table.  I let them know we were leaving and went to get my wife and son.  On the way out the Manager was at the front and blocked us off asking if there was an issue, I was very cordial in telling him that no one stopped at our table and when he asked who the server is I told him I do not know as everyone walked by.  He said if we sat down right now he would get us a waiter. I told him no need as my wife and I were very hungry and tired and were just going home...I called a few days later, not to complain, but to give feedback and let them know what happened.  The manger I talked to had no idea, and really didnt seem to interested, but offered a girft card to us to come back, and I told him that we probably were not coming back in again, he insisted on sending them anyway.  Gave him my address, never got anything (I will not hold this part to him as I dont know if he sent them or not, and if they got lost in the mail)    That was close to a year ago...last week some friends wanted to get together for dinner and  BJs was brought up...had my doubts, but majority rules... We got there a little late and the other couple was already there and had ordered drinks/appetizers...The waitress came up and brought water for us, didnt ask about appetizers...took our orders, and walked away.  the other couple finished their drinks and she took the glases and didnt ask if they wanted more. Our food was brought out by other staff...Everything looked good, couldnt eat it though as the first couple were the only ones with silverware....at this point we havent seen out waitress in about 15 min.  She came out a few minutes later and asked if everything was ok, and that she was going on break.  so we are eating and talking about the service and we are all really let down as if brought the meal down for us.  Our temp wiater who had his own tables though really picked it up for us, checked in every few minutes, asked questions, everything...Our son didnt eat his meal, and the guy took it off the bill, even though i said it was totally fine and not his fault, he still did that.  Then after were were done with desert, the waitress was back on and gave us the bill...The big debate shot up, what do we give for a tip...and how does it get split...we werent sure what the deal was so i took the bill with the money for it to the front... I talked to a hostess about paying and was told it has to be with the server, when I explained that i wanted to plait the tip, I was directed to the manager.  I explained that i did not want to give her much as we felt she didnt deserve it...he didnt really seem to be interested in what i had to say, and let me know that the original server gets the tip, when he took the bill from me he asked what was in it, and I told him strictly the bill only and i wanted to pay the other waiter..he walked over to our table area, and just gave it to the waiter and walked away from me, never talking to me about how to split the tip.....a little discouraging from my view.... I went to the next step, and asked our waited about how to tip him and if we were allowed to, he said yes.  I told him why we were tipping him and the differences in the service.  I also told him that i would be giving his tip to the manager and he could get it from him.   Walked up to the manager on the way out and handed it to him and told him there were two tips.   He took it, said have a good night and walked the other way.... Not asking that something be done on the bill, but at least take the couple minutes to talk to me as a customer....I usually give a second chance to places, but not really in this case...."
Jake W.,"Redwood City, CA",108,472,21,3.0,4/2/2011,"I often come here for lunches with big groups that I work with.  I usually get the burger (if the company is paying for it) or one of the very affordable lunch specials. If you like pan pizzas, the ones here are pretty decent.  I'm not a big fan of that style, so my experience only lies in the tasting of my friend's pies. The sandwiches are good, but nothing too special.  If you do the 1/2 sandwich and side salad (the wedge, I believe has no redeeming health benefits, but is delicious), it's a pretty good deal ($6.99 if I recall correctly).  The thin fries (I haven't tried the other kind) are good (although not worthy of their own paragraph in my review). What takes this chain restaurant (I'm not usually a chain restaurant kind of guy) from two to three stars is a desert they have called a ""Pizookie"".  Know that it takes a few minutes to make, so if you're in a rush, try to order it early.  Basically, it's a big cookie, cooked in a pan with ice cream on top.  The cookies are always hot and soft (never overcooked in my experience).  I recommend the Oreo or Chocolate chip, but I don't think you can go wrong here."
Eddie C.,"Torrance, CA",196,42,,4.0,10/29/2012,"BJ's got one of the most tastiest deep dish pizza's I've ever had. The pizza is thick & full of toppings. Went there for dinner with friends. Had ordered half buffalo chicken and half spinach & artichoke. Great flavor combo of veggie goodness and meat! The server was friendly and came by frequently to check up on us, making sure we were doing OK. This place gets pretty packed, we had to wait about 15~20 mins before we got in, but the pizza is really worth the waiting for. :)"
Arlene D.,"Torrance, CA",66,99,315,3.0,12/5/2013,"Thought I take a break from the awesome hole in the wall places and try out BJ's that my friends have been raving about.  Treated my DN for some fun lunch.  Glad they had their $5.95 lunch specials.  Without the specials, their prices were too steep for my wallet.  Pepperoni cheese pizza, caesar salad, chicken tenders & fries, southern fried chicken and a chocolate chip pizookie for a dessert treat.  Every dish was good nothing spectacular. Restrooms clean and service was good.  So back to my hole in the wall adventures........"
Sandra H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,5/8/2015,"This was my second time here, we came for my Grandsons 12th Birthday! Once we received our food my Grandsons order was  wrong! So the Birthday Boy had to wait for another plate! Then as we were winding down our evening! The Manager (Michael ) came to our table and told us we had to leave, because there was another reservation waiting! I thought wow that's pretty rude, we had a party of 10 and spent a nice amount of money there! If my Grandsons order would have been right the first time, maybe we would not have been there that long! Non the less he enjoyed his bday!!   I truly felt the attitude of the Manager on shift was rude and uncalled for!!"
Randy E.,"Carson, CA",140,16,,5.0,1/2/2014,Great customer service. Everyone is always nice and friendly. They make sure the customers are satisfied.
Kevin Z.,"Riverside, CA",4,56,69,4.0,11/22/2011,"It must seem like I eat at BJ's a lot... but I guess I just happen to try different locations here and there. This was a nice location. Our waiter was pretty friendly and helpful. He knew his beers pretty well and knew the menu well. He liked to talk for sure... was a tad bit of a beer snob, leaning toward BJ's being the best of all....... I am a bit of a beer snob... maybe I was setoff because he was so pro BJ's beer...... there are lots of other brews out there. so he needs to sample more I think. I give four stars because it is just like most BJ's nice decor... good food... but with most chains I am sure they are hit and miss. They almost never perform consistantly. We got seated fast, food was brought out in good time... although I didn't get to finish my salad before my meal came... but it was almost done. We had a pizzookie (sp?) It was great. They messed it up... we asked for certain ice cream and dough.... but it didn't matter, they are all good combinations.  The best part, dinner was free to me. A customer of mine was treating me to dinner, that always makes a meal taste better :D I can't say if this is a busy place since we didn't show up till about 10:45 and it was a fast seating and about 1/4 full. Seemed like late night movie goers and people on dates getting some drinks and desert. A big, huge party of like 14-18 people came in and sat next to us. luckily we were almost done and they weren't too loud. Although it's a kinda large and loud place.... overall, good and satisfied."
Muriel T.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",128,170,3,4.0,11/18/2011,"Good service, good food.  I came in with my sister in law for a lengthy dinner and chat.  Our waitress seemed to notice that we were more into catching up, so while she chimed in at the right moments she wasn't over bearing.  I had the steak with green beans and mashed potatoes.  The steak was a but pricey (something like $18.95) but it was really really tasty. We also has a mini oreo pizookie.... so good!!!!  Ya it did grow a little noisy but nothing more than I would expect from BJs."
Crystal D.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",107,6,,1.0,3/6/2016,"Where to begin..first we were told two days ago that we can't make a reservation for a party of 5 but to call ahead on that same day..fine I called and let the hostess know that it's was for 5, 4 adult and a baby and that we needed a high chair. We got there and checked in and waited about 15 minutes or so even though they said 10 which is fine but then they ended up taking us to an elevated booth..I told the hostess that I let them know I needed a high chair prior to arrival..it was ok because they had another booth almost ready for us. We got sat with menus and no utensils. Sat there for about 10-15 minutes before waitress came to take our drink orders. Interestingly enough she made sure to stop by and pick up the previous check book right away but never said hi or I'll be right with you..we order a pitcher of beer and two glasses of wine and also my 16 month olds meal and or appetizers. Drinks took forever to come as she said she was waiting for the bartenders. Servers name I believe was Ginger. Well drink orders finally came but only wine and the glasses of water that my in laws asked for with their wine. Still no beer..few minutes later we got the beer then the appetizers..got the fried calamari which was just ok and the sliders appetizers..well we all were surprised when there was only two sliders and the menu said 4. So the server finally came back and we told her we thought the sliders came with four and her response was ""oh I'm not sure if it does..let me check for you"" already bad that the server doesn't even know the menu..but also I asked where my baby's dinner was. She said ""oh yes"" basically saying she forgot.. In between that my father in law ordered a soup for his dinner and it came out right after the appetizer with not even enough time to take a bite of the apps. She ""found out"" about the sliders and said "" oh I'm sorry the kitchen accidentally sent out a kids meal sliders and that they will get our other two out right away."" Well a few minutes later my babies food came out and then shortly after our dinners came out. Followed by the dinners the other two cheeseburger sliders came out but without cheese or lettuce or tomato or the pickles it was supposed to come with..server didn't come to check how everything was but to just introduce her co worker because she was going on break..new server asked if we were plans my in law asked for the cheese and tomatoes and lettuce that was supposed to come with the sliders..he quickly said ok and they proceeded to be next tables to introduce still almost done with most of our food the slice of cheese and piece of lettuce arrived nothing else and he just dropped it then left. No pickles, no tomatoes and not a word. Well the baby was already getting restless as her food was late and she was just getting tired so we were waiting forever for any plates to be cleared and asked for boxes..when we asked for 2 boxes still none of the plates were cleared and we waited almost 15 minutes for boxes..but it made sure to drop the check as soon as he brought them over and never asked if we wanted anything else dessert or anything mind you it was my boyfriends birthday dinner..well my father in law was already upset as were we and he just put the card in and my mother in law actually had to place it in the servers hand as he was walking by or who knows how long we would've had to wait to get it processed..when he brought it back I decided to look over the bill to see if I could find out what really happened as I am a PIC at a restaurant.. Basically a manager. Didn't see much on the check but the fact that we were charged for the cheese even though it was supposed to be included with our sliders..as we were leaving my in laws decided that they wanted to speak to manager because of all the terrible service and the extra charge and the fact that no one stopped by our table after the slider incident..well we were up front waiting to speak to a manager and about 10 minutes later both managers are at the hostess desk and the hostesses tell the woman manager that we would like to speak to them and the. She proceeded to get this nasty look on her face and rolled her eyes as she walked up to my in laws..unaware that I could see her face before she walked up to them as we were standing separately because of the stairs..sad that all around nothing was done but an insincere apology.. Terrible experience and sad that we came for a birthday celebration..you should really work on customer service and make sure there is teamwork and managers need to stop by every table no matter what but especially if there was an issue."
Marcela I.,"Carson, CA",1,7,3,1.0,10/5/2014,BAD!!!!! Dont ever try any of their pastas because they dont have any taste at all. When its crowded which is usually the case every weekend their service gets even worst. Some of the waiters are such a snob. Overall it was a very bad experience. The only thing i like is the pizookie.
Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1014,1383,2184,4.0,9/9/2011,"The-e-ee DEEP DISH of the 21st century. Having frequented more than a dozen times, I took a chance last night on what I presumed would be their kitchen weakness: The BBQ Chicken Pizza. I was mistaken, it contained those succulent bites of tomato and slathered just right without that over-sweet sauce taste that you would get at CPK. I am not a dark beer man. At BJ's, I love the light ones: Lightswitch Lager, Jeremiah Red, Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweizen. The Pazookie is a dessert classic, its a huge cookie and ice cream dollop for two. But let's get back to pizza. For me, I always ask for extra tomatos and I get 'em no hassle, they pile them on and the pizza gets my lips humming. Of course, this is a runner-up in the Pizza Olympics. Nothing in the world beats Pitfire Pizza (locations Culver City, Westwood) however."
Randy L.,"Torrance, CA",38,33,4,3.0,1/17/2012,"Had Marsala Chicken, which was just OK. The chicken and noodles were good, the sauce was not so good.  Servers hounded us every couple of minutes for our order while we were getting settled and visiting with friends. Service was good after we ordered."
Monthakan B.,"Honolulu, HI",70,71,755,4.0,12/27/2010,"I always love BJs!!! Great place to hang out, watching the games, & grab a bite! $3 all beers during Lunch time!! I was just gonna have 1 but ended up with 3! ^_^ Cobb Salad was OK....But they do have the best Wings!!! Wish they have a better Happy Hour though..... $1.00 off drinks and $2.00 off Apz. are not enough during this tough economy!!! hahahaa"
Michael G.,"Bellflower, CA",6,58,23,5.0,2/12/2013,"The whole fam-damily loves this place! They still spend time on the menu because there's lots of good stuff here. I tried many things and liked them such as the Spinach artichoke dip, pizza and the Parm encrusted chicken. I settled on a favorite and order it just about every time. The Jambalaya and a brewhouse blonde. They have several beers that taste great but the brewhouse blonde is just the perfect simple beer. Pair it with the Jambalaya and its the perfect marriage of spicy and refreshing. The restaurant is comfortable for a get together as well as sports with friends. And the service is great. any employee will fill your drink or get you something. This is how you run a restaurant. It's too bad not every BJ's is run the same as this one. No reservations but you can check in over the phone before you get there."
Nicole D.,"Torrance, CA",339,211,345,3.0,4/10/2013,Stuffed mushrooms are a must and i appreciate the full spectrum of beers (extra light to Guiness-esque).
Chris R.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,15,5,2.0,12/3/2013,"Overrated. Had the bbq buffalo burger, the description on the menu made it seem amazing! When i got it, nothing like i expected. It was carelessly made, seemed like a rushed job.  I was very disappointed.  Very poor. And i asked for wedge cut fires and they gave me regular. Service was Ok at best. I give them 2 stars because the calamari appetizer was good.  If you want a great burger, go to the standing room in redondo beach, great burgers!"
