Maira T.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,28,,4.0,2/14/2014,"Got food for pick up- which I've never done from here- the staff was awesome despite the crowds and craziness. I got clam chowder and calamari. It was ready when I walked up and still very hot and fresh when I sat down to eat it.  Like somepeople say the food isn't ""wow"" but it's definitely decent and worth the cost."
Caroline S.,"Los Angeles, CA",52,133,,3.0,1/2/2011,"My review has nothing to do with their food! Their food is ""A-OK."" But their FLOORS need improvement! They need to be waxed less or something. On several different occasions I have almost slipped on their floors in different parts of the restaurant! And I have even witnessed other people slip! If you go, please wear shoes with good non-slip soles, for your own safety.   I can't believe I'm writing this here, but I hope they do something about this. I mentioned it to them once, but they brushed it off saying that it was my shoes... So wear good shoes, since they won't/can't do anything about it."
Jeff H.,"Los Angeles, CA",476,473,1326,4.0,1/14/2009,"This place is impossible on a weekend night (Fri, Sat) Expect a long wait.  I came here for lunch during jury duty. Fantastic lunch specials. Soup and half sandwich w/ fries for $7, I think? What a deal! Not much of a crowd. And the service was annoyingly attentive."
H K.,"Carson, CA",0,3,,2.0,3/10/2015,"Was there last night...Off night. Poor service, slow service, flavorless dry salmon, and piping HOT mac & cheese for my 4 yr old grandson AFTER everyone else in our group had received their's. It's mac & cheese...Really. Not sure what happened since the last time I was there.  I hope management will work to improve this and provide better training.  We'll give them a while and try again...if for nothing but dessert. Wish I had a better review for them :-("
Donn G.,"Torrance, CA",69,15,17,2.0,10/25/2010,"I've been to BJ's quite few times during the day with friends for some deep dish pizzas, pizookies, and delicious beer. I never thought I'd ever describe any form of beer delicious, but BJ's brewed beer was nice and sweet.   However, when I went here for my birthday dinner, the service was BIZARRE. I made reservations at least 2 weeks in advance to make sure I get it on the day of my birthday at the time that I wanted and... SUCCESS! The lady on the phone was even uber nice to offer me the balcony/patio because I had reserved for a party of 20, which she called a 'big party.' When the day finally arrived, I confidently walked infront of the people waiting in line and checked in with the hostess thinking I was going to get seated right away because I had a reservation.  BUT NO. I had to WAIT at least 45 minutes to get seated, and I didn't even get an outdoor table as promised.  After putting together a row of tables for us (clearly showing how unprepared they were), they finally seated 14 of my guests plus myself (15 people).  I thought the night was going to go smoothly from there. But when the rest of my guests arrived, (4 more people, 1 cancelled on me) I was told those 4 had to sit seperately because they couldn't make the customers they had JUST SEATED at the end of my row, whom they put there AFTER they seated us KNOWING I reserved for a party of TWENTY, move somewhere else. Not only that, but they even had teh audacity to tell my 4 guests that they had to wait BEHIND the customers who walked in before them. I complained, as anyone would, but everyone working there played victim with me. My last 4 guests just decided to eat at RA sushi instead and just met up with me after. Our server took too long to give us our food, our check, and everything else we had asked for. The worst part  was I was left worrying about whether my guests were enjoying themselves or were being just as frustrated and annoyed as I was. BJ's in Torrance, you have embarassed me to the max I want to cut them some slack as that night must have just been a very busy one, but you don't do that to someone's birthday or to someone who's made a reservation. I will take the drive to BJ's in Cerritos just to get away from this one. The only reason this rating is a 2 and not a 1 is because I got two free pizookies at the end. They knew they messed up."
Adam B.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,64,1,5.0,4/16/2011,"I'll admit it, going out to eat with my family is, well, a pain.  There's usually a lot of us, a slightly modified order or two, and it can all just be a lot to handle.  However, the staff at BJ's in Torrance were just excellent and professional throughout the evening, and it was very appreciated.  Our server, Christianne (I hope I'm spelling her name right), provided an amazing level of service, despite being treated extremely rudely by one of my family members, a fact which was embarrassing to all of us present.  Her treatment of my grandmother in particular really stood out, and she has our thanks (as well as a good-sized tip in addition to the charged gratuity). That being said, I felt that the food was good.  Not spectacular, but good.  Really, the only problem I had with the place was the very large and varied menu, since everything sounded great.  I ended up with the roast beef french dip (the rushed decision) plus a cup of tomato bisque, and was very pleased with the quality.  The only complaint that I heard all night was from my grandmother who thought the clam chowder, while good, was a bit too salty for her taste.  Considering how dining with my family usually goes, this was a good night! I know for a fact that I'll be back if I'm in the area, and so will the rest of my family."
Elina A.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,216,65,4.0,1/9/2014,My first experience at BJs was in Arizona. I hated it. So I was really reluctant to come here.  But my friend wanted to come so I went along. I am glad I did. The food was really good. I tried a few appetizers and the parmesan crusted chicken. Yum. I would be back.
James S.,"Torrance, CA",4,7,,5.0,2/26/2014,Family decided to eat back here. Spoke with Angela the manager and explained the situation from last time. She took care of us this visit and took the time to check in regularly. Our server Nicole was great! Some of the best service I've had in a long time. I  was very happy this visit and VERY impressed with the way things were handled. The food all came out at the same time and was HOT. Nicole checked up on us regularly as well. I really appreciate you guys doing that for us. Will be back because of the turn around. Amazing service! If corporate reads this one as well... Promote both of them! Thank you!
Tobias D.,"San Pedro, CA",64,20,5,4.0,12/17/2013,"Solid dinner spot while you're mall-trolling or before a movie. Big, tasty meals and a good selection of beers, many of their own brews. Pork chops were actually quite good, ribs are decent too. Nothing is mind-blowing, but it's all reliably good."
Jerry A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,3,4.0,11/3/2013,"Food is good had a deep dish pizza great place to take a date and watch the game without having to sit at the bar. The wait was decent 20 min, disliked how close the tables are to one on other, if I had to complain about something."
Asher K.,"Tacoma, WA",8,8,,4.0,9/17/2012,"Avocado eggrolls, new orleans jambalaya, scampi pasta are definitely my favorites. Wish if new orleans jambalaya was less salty."
Brooke D.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,207,152,4.0,10/31/2014,"This is the local BJ's, and I have dined here numerous times, but I wanted to write a review based on my experience last night. Came here with school friends to celebrate 2 birthdays. Initially, the head count was 14, but as the night progressed, more unannounced guests showed up. We eventually hit 23 people. The staff were kind and courteous and very accommodating. No attitudes were given like you usually would get at a restaurant when hosting a party of that size. Drinks and food came out in a timely manner (or as quick as they could get all of our orders out). The majority of the food ordered was pizza because many people in the group had never dined at BJ's. I truly enjoyed last night's experience, and hope that all of my future experiences will be as pleasant as this one."
Charlene G.,"Torrance, CA",9,12,,2.0,8/20/2014,"Went to BJ's Torrance for our anniversery dinner.  It was less than an exciting dining experience.  We waited forever for our food to be served.  Had to flag down our waitress who was oblvious that our meal had not come out yet.  Food luke warm....french fries cold. Not what we had hoped for, for an anniversary dinner."
Alanna L.,"SYLMAR, CA",4,50,,1.0,2/23/2013,My first time here. Celebration with my bro and his fiance and my girl. The service was NOT good. He came back to check on us ONCE. Our table was very cluttered. I wouldn't come back.
Alexis M.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,21,8,3.0,9/6/2013,"I love coming to Bj's and eating their delicious food but the thing that really got me upset was that they took FOREVER for our food to arrive, while the people next to us got theirs first. The food taste the same, it's just the service was really terrible that day."
Craig Y.,"Torrance, CA",1159,1149,11927,4.0,7/9/2010,came here yesterday evening for dinner got here around 5ish so the place was still empty slowly filling up. I got the scampi pasta it was delicious lots of shrimp and pasta the garlic bread was good too. I couldn't finish it either ate about half of it brought the rest home lol. I was stuffed couldn't even make room for a pizookie this time lol. I'll def be back here again. Then again i've always enjoyed this place.
Albert L.,"Los Angeles, CA",88,186,142,3.0,1/8/2011,"I've been to BJs six times or so throughout my life now, including twice over this break.  First time was in Cerritos, then Westwood, then four times here in Torrance.  It was only recently that my mother mentioned about a ""happy hour"" at BJs.  Because I've been at college in other cities on the opposite coast, I know very little about the ""happy hour"" scene of los angeles, let alone a particular suburb of LA. I have to say, they're extremely conservative in offering happy hour specials. I've never heard of a single place (of the few that i know about) that offer less than 2 dollars off anything.  given that a happy hour is usually centralized around drinks, and BJ's brews their own beer, i expected to see a bit more of a discount on drinks. half off mini pizzas was the only half decent deal, although the mini pizza is really quite mini.   my friend and i got the chicken pesto flatbread pizza, and it was nothing particularly special.  given the nature of this restaurant though, i didn't expect spectacular food anyways.  i opted to have one of their cider/beer mixes (some berry cider with their piranha pale ale), which actually tasted pretty sweet and nice. this is another ""cheesecake factory"" alternative, meaning that it's good for groups and offers a good variety of food options. they got good beer; i'll be back."
Nene A.,"Torrance, CA",0,25,1,1.0,3/7/2015,"My friend and I visited this BJ's restaurant last night. We were told to wait 30 mins and the hostess gave us the light up pager. After waiting 30 mins, our pager lighted up and it was our turn to be seated. The lady just took the pager and she TOTALLY ignored us!! People here are EXTREMELY rude!! We waited 30 mins for nothing and we are HIGHLY disappointed!! They DID NOT give us ANY attention when we wanted to ask when we could be seated because it was supposed to be our turn. So we just got VERY angry and we left the place. We both used to enjoy eating at this restaurant before but we're never coming back to this place again after this bad experience since they disrespected us and ignored us."
Michael B.,"Anaheim, CA",111,85,6,5.0,11/14/2012,Service was fast and friendly.  The avocado egg rolls and BBQ chicken salad was delicious and to perfection. My server Nicole B was above and beyond right on and was ahead every step of the way. She was charming and polite and I highly recommend this location. Just watching all the staff here interact well with not only their fellow employees but each guest was great.  Manager Ryan came to my table and was so very nice
Jennifer O.,"Torrance, CA",387,47,79,4.0,8/21/2013,"I went on a busy night but I was seated within 20 minutes. Since we got called in everything ran smoothly. The server was very patient and took care of us well. Of course I had to order a deep dish pizza and I got the bbq chicken. I think I inhaled it in 2 seconds cause I didn't want to miss the warm and crispy taste of the pizza. We also go the watermelon salad and lettuce wraps. I gotta say that I was a bit skeptical about the watermelon salad but it was one of the best simple salads I've had in a while! Although we were stuffed, we couldn't pass up on the pizookie. I could kill for another one right about now.."
