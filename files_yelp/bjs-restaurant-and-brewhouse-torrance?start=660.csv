Nick D.,"Torrance, CA",90,263,219,2.0,4/22/2011,"I haven't been here in a while, but it was just okay.  I had the pizza.  Small mom and pop pizza places makes better pizza.  I bet their pizza dough was pre-made and they just added the toppings.   One star less for not having coca-cola."
Kimberly N.,"Torrance, CA",10,51,,1.0,1/10/2011,EEK! Methinks not because the service at this chain is really bad. EVERY TIME I GO. I really don't like writing bad reviews (Sorry!) but this place has consistently given bad service.  Example...bringing a pitcher of beer. No glasses!! Who does that? What a horrible tease. We sat there staring at our beer for 10 minutes. no joke. no glasses. So sad! Once we finished that pitcher we had to wait another 10 minutes (after our glasses were empty) for another pitcher. Big boo boo guys!  We were served our food and I sat staring at my food...no utensils. Yup...another 10 minutes waiting to eat with the food in front of me.  Yeah....I really try and avoid this BJ's.
Ayumi S.,"Pasadena, CA",3944,984,1478,5.0,5/31/2010,"I love going to BJ's! That's always a number one option between my friends and I when we want to go eat somewhere. I always get the same thing though, I should probably try something new now... -__- I get the roasted turkey cobb which consists of..well obviously turkey, and you have the bacon and avocado...mm avocado :) Their fries are good too! The wedges, or the shoelace ones, they're both pretty awesome.  Sometimes I get the half sandwich and soup thang..I get their broccoli soup..yum!! Awesome customer service too!"
Michelle T.,"Torrance, CA",1662,1003,4594,4.0,5/5/2010,"free mini pizzookie for tony on his b-day! (i ate most of it-oops) came here for lunch before we went to see the long awaited Kick Ass movie. reservations, seating and meal went smoothly. we had some more of their small bites menu. pesto flatbread, house chipshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BSuQI44­gJqNbKXjjN7hK6w?select=9_4qGFYWWI4PsvN6vVIubw. all pretty good.  i still gotta come back for their pizzookie mini trio, cuz one is never enough to share."
Madeline G.,"Fullerton, CA",84,646,,3.0,3/3/2013,"Regular BJs. Crowded, loud, average/decent food, decent service....blahhhhhhh boring! But I came here with my girlfriends and so that is always fun."
Keesy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",362,404,11,3.0,4/21/2011,"Buffalo chicken pizza is pretty good, salty, but good.  Came here on a Monday and caught Mojito Monday (completely by accident by the way) and I gotta say either I'm turning into a lightweight in my advanced age or those mojitos were REALLY good! You really couldn't taste the alcohol and the bestie and I were feeling a little warm after the first one.  The bestie was in no mood to eat so she just ordered dessert. She had the beignet with the ice cream. I had a piece and it was tasty, like a fluffy donut with ice cream and strawberry puree. I had the pazookie trio platter (I've been on a binge, don't judge me!). Out of the Oreo pazookie, the white chocolate macadamia nut, and the peanut butter (all with a scoop of vanilla ice cream each) I'd have to say the Oreo cookie was the BEST. Followed by the peanut butter then the white chocolate macadamia nut.  Food here is average but they have interesting combos. They do have some diet friendly items but they truly pale in comparison to everything else that threatens to give you a coronary."
Patrick S.,"Torrance, CA",1546,415,1722,4.0,7/7/2008,"yes, finally, a few more choices to eat at the mall. this place has great food,, GREAT BEER, and a full bar. everytime i go there i walk away happy. the pasta, salad, burgers, deserts- etc etc etc, are all great. not over priced, good portions and the service is always good. the place is clean and well staffed. but be prepared to wait, the nornal wait time on a busy night is 45 min. but its woth it,, i would go again. tip,, call ahead and put your name in if you are in a hurry. tip#2 GET A DEEP DISH PIZZA,, ITS THE KITTYS WISKERS !! UPDATE: went there for dinner and my order was all wrong, but we were pressed for time ( movie tickets ) so i still ate what they gave me, it was a turkey burger but the topings etc were not right,, it was still good. I was not complaining about it, but i did tell the waiter that my order was wrong. So when the bill came they gave me a free dinner!!!  yes,, way to go Bjs. thats how you run a restaurant!!!"
Eric C.,"Berkeley, CA",65,330,5,4.0,5/30/2011,"A 3 star average? Wow, this place gets a bad rap. I came here expecting some pretty mediocre food but I was pleasantly surprised. Though it took a while for our party of 7 to be seated, the rest of the evening went without hiccups.  If I could sum up BJs just in a couple of words -- think Cheesecake Factory competitor with a brewhouse twist. Add in a pitcher of pale ale (damn, we left with 1/3 of a pitcher remaining -- I was the DD) and it makes the experience that much better. Pastas, fish, appetizers, they all came out nice!"
Sandy T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",49,22,4,5.0,7/3/2013,"Great food and great service. Went there for lunch and it was busy, but the service was great and the flatbread pizza was incredible"
Ana M.,"Killeen, TX",17,21,10,4.0,5/27/2014,"the food was PHENOMENAL,  but the service SUCKED!  we got there before 5pm on Memorial Day, it wasnt crowded enough to have such lacking service.  we were a 2 family table of 8, and the food came on time, my friend had ordered a 2nd glass of wine and it took asking them more than 4 times for the glass and after 30 minutes, it arrived!  other than that and the lack of attention from the wait staff and it was great!  for appetizers we had the avocado egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, and artichoke and spinach dip...all were onpoint!  i had the prime rib sandwich with au jus and it was really tasty and fall apart good but the skinny crispy fries were a little greasy.  my husband had the bone in new york steak and had no complaints.  my friend had the moroccan salmon and said it tasted amazing.  il definitely be back!!"
Joel S.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/20/2012,"Bad service, told the girl at the desk that my daughter was having her birthday today and they did nothing, check came and I told a waiter and they still did nothing, had to ask for silverware, food was over cooked, for that amount of money I expect a lot better service. My son got a calzone and there was hardly anything in it. Don't go there!"
Sovana L.,"Long Beach, CA",27,45,8,3.0,5/23/2011,"I've only had their grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a bowl of tomato bisque for lunch.  It sounds so ridiculously plain but it was quite delicious! In fact, I love how they spread garlic butter on the bread. So, it was grilled ham and cheese sandwich with garlic bread and a side of tomato bisque.  Genius.  I also love their tomato bisque. It was thick, sweet, savory, and it has a touch of tanginess.  I'm craving it just by talking about it... /droolz"
Gayathri V.,"Torrance, CA",0,8,,3.0,12/12/2013,Beer that hubby enjoys and avocado egg rolls that are simply delicious!  Veggie pizza was good too and the chicken tortilla soup was good but I had much more delicious versions in bahama breeze and in-hotel stay menu at hyatt! I give it a 3/5 :)
Heather B.,"Inglewood, CA",3,5,,2.0,10/13/2013,Service was terrible had to order to go. Received my pizza and it wasn't cut it was just in the box whole. Will never go to this location again!
Chris Y.,"Lawndale, CA",64,282,36,4.0,3/14/2011,"One word... PIZOOKIE!!! So delicious! And BJ's makes 'em! Gotta love a giant, fresh-baked chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla ice cream on top! Ok, now that I've got that out of the way... onto the rest of my review... Aside from that, their entrees are phenomenal. All their pizza's are awesome! And I'm a big fan of their pot roast sandwich. Huge portions! I've yet to try one of their giant stuffed baked potatoes, but I've seen other people order them. My God!... I've never knew potatoes could be that big. It looks like you'd need a cart (or crane) to move that thing. ""Giant"" is an understatement. A more accurate description might be ""Godzilla of Spuds"". And for you drink lovers, they have several of their own handcrafted brews on tap. I highly recommend getting the sampler sets, which will let you sample all the different kinds. My personal favs are their ""Nutty Brewnette"" and ""P.M' Porter"". Aside from their awesome decor, they bar has a wall of flat screen TV's behind it, each one showing a different channel. Great viewing for any sports fan. The wait time can be pretty lengthy during peak hours. This is just one of those unfortunate consequences of going to a place that pulls in a lot of patronage. But it's definitely a great restaurant to go to for good food and good beer. One of my favorite spots!"
Billy K.,"Torrance, CA",176,252,205,3.0,1/12/2011,Came here Tuesday night around 8pm.  Was given a pager and wait time of 15 mins. Waited 15 mins.  Ordered thai shrimp lettuce wrap.  Shrimp was tiny.  Four wraps were enough just for two people. It tasted like Rascal's salad.  Could not taste the mango.  Thai sauce tasted like teriyaki sauce. Avocado egg roll was the reason why we went to BJ's   The rolls were nicely fried.  It was tasty. Grilled Chicken club was good.  But maybe due to reheating and eaten the next day. Place was crowded but service was not slow.
Mary W.,"Lomita, CA",0,15,,2.0,11/15/2012,Went in with co-workers for lunch.. Our server only had 3 tables and even like that service was slow and took for ever to get our bill. My pizza was cold. Strawberry lemonade is delish.
Angelina A.,"San Pedro, CA",4,28,10,4.0,7/25/2011,My #1 favs are:  Mac and Cheese! its perfect i have to order this every time.  Chicken Wings. The hot sauce is just perfect not too spicy but still makes your nose tingle a bit.  Pot-stickers. enough said.  Grilled Chicken Club. i love the bread and all the avocado mm my mouth is watering.  Cocktails. There all so good never had a bad one.
Rick S.,"Torrance, CA",0,30,20,1.0,10/31/2013,"Poor service. Maybe Katrina needs to find a different job. Customer service is definitely not for her. Too bad, the food is very good."
Chris H.,"San Diego, CA",4,28,,1.0,7/5/2013,"It was one of my worst experiences at a BJs, let alone any established restaurant.  Not only was our food delayed for over an hour, it came out cold and with a hair in the mashed potatoes.  The manager came over and apologized but did not offer to comp our food or ask us how the rest of our experience was going.  It was terrible.  We had three waitresses change shifts for no reason whatsoever.  It's not like we're that hard to please - we didn't ask for much and of course, they gave us little in return.  I'm not harping on all BJs because I've had good experiences with them, but this restaurant was the worst."
