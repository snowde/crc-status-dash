Deb G.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,94,48,4.0,5/26/2013,"We frequent this location often my family loves the pizza nachos are delish, I prefer the appetizers at Lazy Dog but BJ's does have better drinks.   The service can be hit & miss which is a shame, tonight started out strong & then slowed to a snails pace.  Great desserts.  Do wish they'd do something about the service."
Kayla M.,"Torrance, CA",11,92,65,3.0,3/20/2012,"I'm giving this place 3 stars because they have messed up the call-ahead seating one too many times for me. I called ahead to reserve my place in line. I was told 20 minutes. I show up there 15 minutes later to check in. I still had to wait 1 hour AFTER I got there. I asked the person at the front where we were in line, and she just kept making excuses, and said there's only a few parties ahead. It's like they didn't even take down my name for call-ahead seating. I bitched to the manager finally and she gave me some gift cards to use the next time, of which I just gave away to my friends. This happened to me the last few times now so that's it for me.  I haven't been here in quite a while now, so maybe they don't do call-ahead seating anymore.  Ok. that being said, and for the sake of being fair, here's what I thought was good about this place. The food is actually very good and I like the environment when hanging out with friends. There's lots of good beers here. And the P'Zookie is one of my favorite desserts of all time. Too bad I won't be having it at this location any more."
Lolita D.,"Long Beach, CA",5,69,1,4.0,6/24/2013,My first time coming here and I got breakfast and it was good. French Toast and a breakfast omelet pizza with potatoes. Lots of food!
Claudette B.,"Carson, CA",156,79,86,1.0,3/2/2011,"*rating is for service only WORST SERVICE EVER!  I don't know if it's because the people that work here are so young, but it seems to be the census that it's not just BJ's, but just this one in Del Amo promenade.  It seems as though the servers forget about you and you're just an afterthought."
Tawny S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",20,63,10,4.0,4/6/2013,"Great place to eat. Service is nice and friendly. Lots of TVs to watch. The food is really good with a large variety. I would recommend the salmon, burger and Caesar salad; don't forget the pizooki for dessert."
Yvette C.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,96,201,3.0,2/11/2013,"Since I was in the area, decided to pop in for my favorite salad, Seared Ahi.  Service was very good and friendly, I sat at the bar. I requested lite dressing, it was served with heavy. I still ate it, I was starving! The ahi was cooked to perfection. I ordered a Bloody Mary, uh, underwhelmed. If you want a good BM go across the street to the Elephant Bar. They make them from scratch. Yum."
Areen L.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/17/2015,"After a long day of work, I wanted to unwind with a drink or two. Decided on bjs at del amo because I figured it wouldn't be too crowded or loud. Walked in and went straight to the bar.  It was pretty empty, just as I'd hope.  While waiting for my friend, the bartender(Silvia) asked if I wanted a menu.  The problem was that she had to repeat herself 3 times because I couldn't hear what the fuck the was saying.  I thought maybe it was my ears, but after my friend showed up, she also couldn't hear wtf this ""bartender"" was asking.  I'll fast forward a lot of information because it's too much to type, but I will say that this was the worst customer service I've ever received.  Silvia kept talking to co workers, instead of tending to her 3 maybe 4 tops customers.  We ordered drinks that all tasted horrible and we couldn't even get her attention to replace them.  After ordering 3 poorly made drinks that were watered down, we decided to order a shot, only because there was no way to mess that order up or so I thought.  She charged us for 2 shots and after 20 mins of waiting and never receiving the shot, we asked where our shot was, to which she replied, what shot? I was so over it, that we both decided that we had to leave.  Overall, terrible service, horrible drinks and waste of time and money."
Janet L.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,241,63,4.0,12/21/2010,"BJ's the best place to visit for birthdays because of their free mini pizookies! to celebrate my friends' birthdays, we decided to go to BJ's last night. the restaurant was over-crowded and we had to wait a good 20 minutes until we got a table. and we waited another 15 minutes until the waiter finally came to take our orders. the waiter kept apologizing for the wait because they were short-handed. despite all the chaos and stress from a busy night, our waiter was still friendly and cracked a few jokes when he passed by our table.  - avocado egg rolls: delicious combination of flavors wrapped in a crunchy fried wonton wrap with a slight kick of spices and chipotle peppers. the avocados and cream cheese were the dominant flavors of this tasty dish. it comes with a sweet sauce but i felt like the egg rolls had enough flavor and the tamarind sauce would kill the flavor.   - santa fe spring rolls: they were pretty good, but i prefer the avocado egg rolls! - spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips: i couldn't get enough of the dip! so creamy, so delicious. my chip broke in half cause i smothered it with a huge dollop of the dip.  - mozzarella sticks: YUM. extremely cheesy!  then we got two free mini chocolate chunk pizookies and ordered another cookies & cream pizookie with vanilla ice cream scoops. the pizookie was chewy and moist and melts in your mouth like butter. delicious! we finished all three pizookies less than 10 minutes! you don't have to go to BJ's just to fulfill your pizookie cravings. my friends & i made our own home-made pizookies! a few recipes we found: "
Dave S.,"Torrance, CA",2,581,485,4.0,3/29/2014,"Had the Parmesan crusted chicken with cheese mash potatoes and brocolli.  The chicken was really good.  Good crust with moist breast meat.  I would have this again next time.  For dessert, we had the cobbler.  It's an interesting type of cobbler. It's baked in it's own dish as opposed to being scooped out of a larger dish in the traditional sense.  The top had a candied type crunch you would get for a creme bruelle top.  It was a good dessert, but to call it a cobbler was a bit of a reach.  I would say it was more of a small pie without the top crust."
Kendall W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,1,1.0,8/25/2013,"Whack. Not enough place settings, food was burned. Out of four adults and one child, the best dish was the chicken pasta....OFF THE KIDS MENU.  The service was shoddy, the waitress made out table seem as if it were an afterthought.  We ain't comin back."
Robert S.,"Torrance, CA",1,123,9,3.0,8/25/2013,Very overrated chain of restaurants. The food is only ok at best.  Some if the worst pizzas that I've had. For about the same price you can go to Houston's - which the food is always excellent.
Grace A.,"Carson, CA",69,154,18,2.0,3/15/2010,"I can't say that I dislike Bj's because I really do enjoy other locations. But this location is just... lacking.  I work about a minute from this place and decided to stop by for an early dinner with a co-worker. Surprisingly, it was empty. Several empty tables. And yet we're asked to wait 30 mins.  ""Let's just go to panda express or something,"" said the co-worker. ""Damnit, I want a beer!""  So the alcohol wins.  We wait. And boy do we wait.... An hour later, we get a waiter. An hour sitting on a booth watching waiters pass us by. No, they weren't short-staffed, because most of them were standing waiting to be assigned to a certain table. Well you would think the staff is smart enough to service those who need yet to order. But they just watch you sit and bitch. It doesn't matter when you order, since waiting for your meal takes an hour.  ""I hate to sound like a fat woman at a buffet, but how long is it going to take for a pizza and a chicken salad?"" (Co-worker) ""That beer would be good right about now..."" I did get the beer after 15 mins. Can't recall the name since it was one of their seasonal beers. But it was a great pale ale. But 15 mins... you would think they were just preparing it. We got a medium hawaiin pizza and a chicken ceasar salad. They're not amazing pizzas-just cheese, sauce and your toppings of choice, duh. But they're cooked to perfection. Crust isn't thick nor thin...it's just my kind of pizza. The ceasar salad is your regular salad, but I love the large portion that can feed 2-3 people.  Their service however, ruined the meal. Took them longer to give us the bill, all the while I was still waiting for the second beer. Because we were constantly getting different waiters, I got a beer for free. But these kids are like lost puppies in need of a trainer.  ""Which table am I helping? Yep, the quote of the day. Ill make it simple... you see customers sitting on a table without a plate in front of them, there's YOUR table!    I gave them a chance a couple of times, always with the same result... So I can't complain about the food. Its adequate. The beer is their signature here of course. But their service keeps me from coming back."
Brian S.,"Wilmington, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,3.0,8/10/2013,"Came here on a Friday night with no reservations - wait was about 35 - 40 minutes. Calamari appetizer was pretty good, so was the mahi-mahi tacos, but the  burgers were average at best. Ordered our burgers medium, and they came to the table well done. I've been here several times before and never had an issue with their pizzas; guess I'm going that route again on my next visit. Overall the atmosphere was fun, our sever was very nice, and we had a great time!"
Daniel P.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",5,41,3,3.0,5/1/2013,"Decent beer, our pizza had no sauce and needed to be returned. Our waitress took the pizza and apologized for the lack of sauce. Great service recovery. BJs please add Moore sauce to your pizzas."
Char M.,"Long Beach, CA",223,490,142,3.0,1/13/2011,Boy oh boy does this place get packed for the lunch time rush...if you don't wanna get stuck...stay on your server!!!  make sure you get your check as your food comes and plan to arrive right as they open!
Yasmin D.,"Torrance, CA",17,110,471,3.0,3/14/2013,Came here with friends to unwind after a corporate meeting in Torrance..got the calamari and the best beginnings for the appetizers...nothing special but it was great for sharing. Checking the menu for our next order was like reading a book....that's a lot of choices! Ended up with the 5 meat deep dish pizza...hmmm...moving to the Pizookie! Yummy! That saved the whole experience!
Vanessa C.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",26,39,3,4.0,3/10/2013,"Great ahi salad , well dressed  and perfectly cooked ahi. My hubby had a double decker hamburger, huge and delicious with a side of fries. Well accompanied  with two Black and Tans. Great meal before a movie night. The four stars was due to the service, needed extra silverware and napkins."
Adrian J.,"Tempe, AZ",286,78,4,3.0,1/25/2013,"I always enjoy eating at BJs, but I hate how busy it always is and how long it takes for service due to the popularity. My favorite thing to order here though is the avocado rolls. Must order them everytime I eat at a BJs Restaurant. Pizza isn't bad either."
Rhonda S.,"Upland, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/23/2013,"This restaurant doesn't deseve 1 star but that's the lowest score Yelp will allow me to give. The service was very, very slow.  People who sat down after us received their drinks and food before we did.  This was strange because we all had the same waitress.  When I questioned the waitress (Katrina) she got an attiude.  Of course she did!   We asked for easy sauce on our pizzas and when they finally came, they had NO sauce at all and the cheese pizza had very little cheese. When we got the white chocolate macadamia nut pizooki, it had chicken on it.  Yes...chicken! Horrible food and horrible service.  I just called the corporate office to complain and spoke to Tiffany who seemed bothered that I would call and complain. I won't ever go back to BJ's."
Nicole C.,"Los Angeles, CA",289,61,1,4.0,12/3/2012,"My friend wanted to meet here for her birthday...i was the ghetto person who needed to charge her phone and move tables 2 times (found one by an outlet which eased my paranoia of some one swiping my phone or knocking it off the chair)...I also wanted a bday surprise for my friend, and gave the server my card before my friend came....all of my whims were accommodated with a lot of grace and hospitality!  I can't compliment the service enough, and my wine was pretty decent, pizza could have been better is my only complaint, shrimp lettuce wrap appetizer was also pretty good..they gave us a free mini pazookie and then i received my own pazookie too (thanks but i could of done without that just based on the calories)....I think the big pazookies are better,  because the mini one got rock hard half way through.... but all in all this was a lovely experience!  Great service!  Thanks BJ's near the Del Amo mall! Oh and PS they're open until 1 am which was perfect since we were running super late:)"
