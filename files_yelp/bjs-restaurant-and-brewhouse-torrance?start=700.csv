Syd N.,"Torrance, CA",0,143,1,2.0,11/8/2014,"I've eaten here a handful of times and I haven't eaten anything that I can say, ""Wow, that's really good!""  I've eaten the sliders, the pizza and a few other things that I can't remember.  Well, during this visit we started out with the pizza dip which was ok and I had the turkey club sandwich which was ok and would have been better on plain toasted bread rather than grilled bread.  And, we had the pizookie for dessert and the cookie was really hard and totally stuck to the pan so we didn't get too much cookie..."
Chad B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,47,5,5.0,4/29/2013,"Not sure why this place has such a medicore rating we really liked it. Wife got the jambalya and I got the flat bread pizza. Both were awsome!! Will be coming back for more!! The craft beer was pretty good. I had the pale ale (was okay), Red (decent), Nut (liked it)."
Chealsy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,11,5,5.0,9/7/2012,"i LOVE BJ's! i think i come here a little too much. it's the perfect place for a group of friends or just a party of 2. customer service is the same at all BJ's. if they mess up your order, they'll bring what you ordered for no extra cost. It gets really crowded when there's football or basketball games on so call ahead to avoid the wait. if you're a hardcore Laker fan and they're playing the celtics and you got that one ANNOYING person cheering for that lame team .. you'll get irritated. but cool off with a pizookie. the lakers will win for you (; they have great salads, pizza's and pasta! also, look out for their lunch specials during the weekdays! satisfy your hunger without being broke :))"
Mary K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",19,27,9,3.0,2/7/2011,"Hmmm BJ's... It was awhile ago that I went there with a friend.  It was at lunch time, but it wasn't too busy for some reason, and we were seated right away.  I ordered the chicken avocado sandwich with a cup of chili, which was a lunch special I think.  The sandwich wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be, but it was ok. The chili was good, but not outstanding.  I got it with the steak style fries, but if I went again I would probably get the skinny fries, because they looked better. I don't remember leaving this place like, ""Oh my gosh, can't wait to come back!"" This place has ok food, but some items are a bit overpriced, so it's good to get the special.  The service was good, I don't remember any problems. I haven't been back since, but I might try it again and order something different.  The pics of the pizookies look yum, so I might stop in for one of those, with someone to share (they look huge!)"
Kat M.,"Lomita, CA",31,60,22,4.0,12/28/2012,"I'm not a fan of their pizzas, but I do like their salads, particularly the Ahi salad, and the pizookies. They also have a nice Hefeweizen."
Lisa B.,"Carson, CA",0,4,,2.0,2/9/2012,Dont get me wrong I LOVE THE FOOD HERE!!! especially their PAZOOKIS!!!!!  But where did they find their servers??!! they have the worst service ever! They either take FOREVER to bring your food out or they have your whole order wrong. Its best just to call in your order for pick up!
Kai H.,"Seattle, WA",0,133,2,1.0,4/27/2014,"This place took 1.5 hours for us to get our food, and when we got it, it wasn't even correct. They weren't busy however every few minutes you would hear crashing dishes, one waiter broke a whole tray of glasses, filled, right next to me and got my legs and dress soaking wet, and didn't even apologized, but laughed at me. My friend had to give me his napkin to wipe my legs. Whole waiting for 1.5 hours for food on a slow night, they only refilled my drink once even though I asked several times. Then I had ordered a dessert which didn't come out till closing so in all I paid 45.45 and I left no tip for our waiter and bjs did not deserve it. We will never be back here again. I've never not left a tip until now. I should see the waiter more than twice. Also the steak we ordered well done, it came out dripping rare.... All of our allergy restrictions we told them about in our dessert they ignored. A waste of $45.45"
Giovanni C.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,3,1,5.0,8/2/2011,"What can I say about this place I love it!!! It seems every time we go we are completely satisfied and extremely full!!! Now this is a very affordable place especially when you go during happy hours! I love that they run it twice a day and you can choose to go for dinner or a late night meal! The fact that the mini pizzas are half off during happy hour is amazing considering how delicious they are. Not only do they have great food but they have great beers and cocktails as well. Its a great place to just hang out and watch sports. Service is always good, but every once in a while the waiters do take a bit longer than normal but its only because it is so busy. If you haven't had a pizookie then you are missing out!"
Tiffany L.,"Camarillo, CA",42,74,17,5.0,3/5/2010,"Love this place! Yummy foods! Great beers! They've got the best calamari I've ever had. Comes with ranch and sweet mariana. Their avocado egg rolls are also really good. Roast beef sandwich with dip, also not wrong! Oh! And don't forget to get a pizooki! Warm, soft, mushy cookie topped with scoops of vanilla bean icecream. You can get it half and half if you can't decide on the cookie flavor. You can also get their beer sampler if you can't decide which beer (it's like...7 beers of different shades) Service was attentive, even during the dinner rush!"
Shazam L.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",8,226,,2.0,1/2/2013,"Fair. Only go back if everything else is closed.  Food greasy, overlooked and just plain oozing with cholesterol and high sodium...even with that the food didn't taste good.  At least if its going to be blatantly fattening and unhealthy make it taste good? Blech."
Kay G.,"Los Angeles, CA",36,248,48,3.0,9/21/2010,"I like going during the week for the lunch specials. It's empty and service is much faster. Should you go during the weekends or at night, call ahead and get a table (which we did). Our wait was maybe three minutes, while others waited for about 10.  Their pastas are enough for two meals, pizzas can be a variety of different toppings, and their wedge fries are delicious (if they're fresh). I liked their sandwiches--filled my appetite. Their barbecue pizza puts CPK's to shame. The pizookie is delicious. I'd recommend you'd get one, only if you have someone to share it with. The salmon teriyaki is also delicious. So is their fettuccine substituted with blackened shrimp. Haven't had a bad meal/experience here yet. Much better atmosphere than that tacky butt TGI Friday's down the road."
Redondo B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,40,,1.0,1/11/2012,Went in on the morning of New Years day which was on a Sunday to watch the NFL football games. Very light crowd and a small group of people watching and my game wasn't on. I asked the bartender about the game I was looking for and he said my team is out of the playoff hunt and they aren't showing those games. Something like 14 televisions in the place with several not being watched and they couldn't put my game on one of them so I left... Went next door to Lazy Dog Cafe and what a different experience. Bartender saw me looking at the screens and asked me what game I was looking for. He went out of his way to find a television that he could put it on for me.  And they introduced themselves to me by name and personally took responsibility for me having a good experience which I did. I know my opinion is minor because BJ's usually gets crowded and apparently they know this because the service always sucks and the temperature there is always freezing. Forget BJ's and head on over to Lazy Dog and you will have a much better time.
Jayda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,122,,4.0,4/3/2010,"Upside: Pizookies, Thai Shrimp Wraps, Homemade Rootbeer, Caprese salad (aka ""Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad), friendly service, and Pizookies (again.) Downside: Expensive, many things on the menu are too plain (like Spaghetti with Red Sauce for nearly $10!), Cream Soda, Orange Creme Soda, and wait time I'll be back, but only after I receive my pay check."
sassy mom g.,"Torrance, CA",1,74,2,2.0,4/15/2012,Waited for over 40 min when initially told by the host 15-20 which seemed reasonable when u have hungry kids on a Sunday evening!   Don't come with hungry kids if u want fast service.   I would go to Stacked which has much better pizza next time.
Priscilla W.,"Torrance, CA",2,23,6,1.0,12/17/2012,"If there could vbe a negative that's what they would get. I placed my to go order just before 8:30 PM on Saturday, immeidately placed a call advising that I placed the order online but would like to use their curbside service. Once in the curbside service parking spot (about 5 mintues prior to 9) I called again to let them know I was there. After waiting,,and waiting...and waiting..several calls during the wait, finally a waiter came out to the car (EMPTY HANDED!!) and told me that their policy was that they don't go outiside after 9 pm, well I was there before 9 and at no point did anyone bother to tell me that they had zero intention of bringing my food out. No call to me and the several times that I called them, they just kept stating that it would be out. I gave the waiter my cc and he said they he would try to sneak past the manager and bring my food..OK..well more waiting time (another 10 minutes) I called and asked that they just return my card to me and I would find food elsewhere. At this time, I spoke with the manager who informed me that they would take care of the bill and my food would be out in a few moments.. Well my fod finally came out, but why this there a pending transaction from BJ's??? I will continue to monitor since I didn't sign a cc slip and expect that it should reverse. Ohhhh...BTW, this isn't the first time that their takeout service have failed me. I've gone inside before and ordered takeout and it's taken about an hour. Pretty sure I say people come in, sit down, eat in leave while I was still waiting. Bottom line...NEVER, EVER, EVER use their take out service."
Sylvia M.,"Torrance, CA",141,131,4,3.0,10/3/2010,Good brewhouse menu. Servers seem better trained than most chain restaurants. Salads are sad - stingy on ingredients and not fresh.  It's weird in a place that's pushing out tons of grilled fresh food that a grilled chicken salad gets topped with a handful of chopped cubes of chicken that obviously had been sitting for days. I also wish the wine selections were a little more imaginative and varied.
Aaron J.,"Redmond, WA",126,216,44,4.0,1/7/2012,"I guess I wouldn't be much of a Yelper if I didn't write about the time I bit into a small screw and bolt while eating a shrimp taco at BJ's. So why on God's green earth would I still give them three stars after I probably could have sued them for such a potentially dangerous mishap?  Here is my reasoning. I have eaten here maybe 20 times. Their service and food are always above average and are usually very good. I truly believe it was a freak accident that this occurred, and know that I can eat here the rest of my life and it will never happen again. They bought me my dinner and desert and were completely professional following up. I could have given them one star, but I still like BJ's, their beer, their service and their food. That's a testament to a good restaurant if a customer is willing to come back after potentially cracking a tooth."
Jackie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",40,35,56,5.0,9/27/2012,"They have the very best stuffed mashed potatoes. My brother thinks I'm crazy cause I looove them. The potatoes are on the menu for a reason!---for potatoe lovers like me! :D I tried the original with Bacon bits and extra sour cream. I've also recently tried their chicken bacon ranch pizza. It was the largest one, big enough for 4 people to share. Of course they have the best dessert, the pizookie (sp?). My favorite is the cookies and cream. I haven't had a bad experience here. I've been for plenty of birthdays or random dates. Its really a great spot to eat. Prices are decent, especially when you're sharing! :) The area is great, at the Del Amo mall, so its a convenient place to eat after shopping."
Albert P.,"Hawthorne, CA",9,110,139,4.0,12/6/2012,"Awesome beer selection! Their pumpkin and red beers are really smooth, although the pumpkin was a seasonal beer. As for the food, they have a large menu and many great foods to go with a good beer. Because they are a popular chain the wait for a table can be long. At 6 pm on a Saturday night expect to wait about an hour."
Garrett L.,"Los Alamitos, CA",498,332,76,3.0,10/8/2009,"I say 3.5 stars, but i cannot give the benefit of the doubt on this one. I'm pretty big on service and that's what really hurt the most.  So i came here with some friends on a Wednesday for lunch after a nice movie at the AMC. It wasn't busy, but many of the tables were occupied. We were seated right away by a really nice hostess and we were ready to grub. i like to try the different types of beers here so i got the Harvest Hefeweisen. It was only $3 since it was still happy hour or something. It had a good flavor so i wouldn't mind ordering that one again. So we got our drinks quick, but the server didn't want to come back.  We were ready to order and i think the server forgot about us because we were waiting for a little bit too long. I was guessing there was something going on and she probably had a good excuse. When she finally got to us she didn't give us an excuse so either she forgot or she doesn't make excuses. Anyways i ordered the sliders which is 4 little burgers and fries. I got the thin fries, which i think is better than the wedges. The burgers were good and the food here always seems to satisfy me.  Everything was good except for the service. I've been to a couple of restaurants in the Del Amo mall and so far i haven't really found a place that has good service. hm... maybe i should stop coming here..."
