Andreas R.,"Torrance, CA",16,95,,4.0,10/29/2012,"Nice atmosphere and good prices. I like their snack menu which has a few small-bite options at low prices. Had the white chocolate macadamia pizookie which was amazing! Perfect size. What I don't like about certain restaurants (it happened here last night) is that they put the bill on the table before you ask for it and say ""Whenever you're ready"". It's a pet peeve of mine. If I'm ready, I'll ask for the bill, thank you. It's unappetizing to have the little folder sitting on the table in front of the food I'm still eating. Agh!"
Butch N.,"West Covina, CA",82,95,99,3.0,9/23/2010,"I've tried BJ's a few years back when my friend introduced me to this place. I went with her during lunch mostly and have tried the deep dish pizza, the pork ribs, the sandwiches and their lunch entrees. My friend always tries a different drink everytime we go there and have always liked them. I always liked their food. Somewhat close to what Chilis, TGIFs and Elephan Bar type of food. If you are into those joints then you will definitely like it here as well.  Prices are also comparable to the list I just mentioned so either way, its a win win situation."
Chris L.,"Torrance, CA",19,34,,3.0,12/1/2010,"Although I don't like the food here for the most part, I LOVE the wedge cut fries. I always order these with a side of honey mustard and ranch.  Their beer selection is decent as well, with a good number of Belgians."
Salvador D.,"Wilmington, CA",1,11,4,2.0,4/14/2013,I been to bjs many times and yesterday was the worst they took long on my order n they got it wrong afterwords n the service was bad wat a bad experience
Christina Y.,"Torrance, CA",40,184,,3.0,1/14/2010,"I think there's something wrong with me, because I had pizza TWICE this week.  Dear.  God.  The first time was a homemade pizza that the bf made, which was quite tasty, and the second time was during my 20-minute wait at BJ's last night.  A waitress came around with ""samples"" of pizza for those of us waiting for tables.  Mind you, the sample was actually the size of half a normal slice of pizza.  America's obesity epidemic, here I come!  The pizza was unmemorable.  Too doughy.  I was really hungry though so I ate it.  I thought the samples were a nice touch and kept people from getting cranky. There was an inexplicable crowd for a Wednesday night, and even though we only had two people in our party, we still had to wait.  Apparently the par-tay in Torrance is at BJ's.  My friend was a bit late, though, so it worked out just fine.  I thought it would be really huge inside, but it's actually pretty small -- hence the wait, I guess?  It's really loud inside. Our waitress was good but very inexperienced and couldn't answer our questions (she just started last week).  At least she was attentive, though.  I ordered a grilled chicken potato with NO alfredo sauce, and she was aghast.  (""No alfredo sauce?  That's the best part!""  ""No, I don't like alfredo sauce."")  Haha.  The potato was decent, and was the size of a small child's head.  I could only eat half.  I like BJ's own brews, so I had the Nutty Brewnette, a good dark ale. I feel bad for Jerry's Famous Deli, right across from BJ's.  There was NOBODY up in that joint.  But then I read the Yelp reviews and realized why.  2-star average, Jerry's.  That's just sad."
Karen M.,"Gardena, CA",50,25,8,5.0,2/16/2012,"Love this place! their food is totally delicious, and so are their appetizers, they brew their own beer so you'll find great tasting beer, their dessert are delicious. Great for birthdays, dates, family occasion and just great for lunch and a late night dinner!"
Chad H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",41,75,110,4.0,9/24/2010,"I'll preface this review by saying I'm a homebrewer and thus am partial to going to places that make their own beers. I'll further preface by saying I am aware this particular place doesn't brew their beers onsite... I come here for lunch every couple of weeks or so. It doesn't disappoint. They have a really good lunch deal going on--food items between 6-10 bucks and their beers for $3. Pure genius to do 'happy hour' during lunch. God bless the Brits for that little import (for believing it's ok to have a drink at lunch, not happy hours). So now that we've established that a beer at lunch is socially acceptable- and that if that beer is of the proprietors it's even better- back to the review: The bar staff are always friendly and know more about beer than I'd expect from a chain restaurant. They'll know the abv of the beers and be able to talk about hop and malt character of beers. And you should care about this even if you aren't a beer fan but just drink it casually. Why? Because then you'll learn what you like better over time! So why not 5 stars? The food is solid but nothing earth shattering and the beers don't push the boundaries. They are quaffable but that's it. But for a quick and cheap lunch (with a beer!), that's all you really need."
Tatyana B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",35,4,,1.0,11/12/2011,"i was not please with their service at all.. first we had to wait to be sited for 40 mins, then a waitress came.. talking like a robot (fast and indifferent) and let us wait for another 50 mins.. then gave up her shift to another waiter, but brought our food herself and the food was cold. .. go figure. I am not going to this place again, though i like the food there.;("
Magnolia H.,"Los Angeles County, CA",1,32,,4.0,5/20/2013,Bj's is a really good restaurant. The only problem I had with it was that the food has taken a long time to get to us. This has happened more then one time. But other then that I really love the food and atmosphere! I highly recommend everyone get a pazooki! Make sure to save room though! Food is delicious you'll want to finish every bite but keep in mind that yummy dessert!

Kristen M.,"Hillsboro, OR",948,916,922,5.0,6/18/2010,"One of my favorite chains but this location is quite smaller than the Cerritos one, hence expect to be waiting a while. Overall, I'm always here for the pizza, pizookie (especially on my birthday because it's free!) and apps. You can't go wrong :)"
Carolyn V.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,1,4.0,5/9/2009,"GREAT FOOD. Nice waiters/waitresses. You musttt get a pizookie, those are the bombb."
Annie B.,"San Jose, CA",72,40,28,2.0,10/12/2011,"Over-priced. Very noisy. Rude servers. I was Going to dine in with my boyfriend but it will probably take forever with how many people there... So we decided to order to go. I walked up to the counter after the previous customer walked away to order but the 2 cashiers started a convo. Stood there for a minute and the cashier in front of me finally asked ""what did you need?"" .... (Who asks that at a take out counter?) The other cashier kept talking to the one that was taking my order so she kept asking me ""what was it?"" and ""can you repeat it again?"" Horrible. Last time servers were very attentive... These ladies were just straight out rude. We ended up waiting 50 minutes for 2 pizookies; We saw 2 brought out but 1 was placed in someone else's order, so I thought, oh, not ours. We waited and waited...  I finally lost my patience and confronted another waiter. He apologized and rushed into the kitchen. He finally came out with the remaining pizookie and we were on our way. The ice cream for the first pizookie was melted, unfortunately, from sitting on the counter for 20 minutes....  I would've given them 1 or no stars at all... but my previous experience saved them."
Kenny B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",41,164,278,5.0,5/2/2014,Love love love their deep dish pizza!  Haven't had to wait long here and service is good.
Patrick L.,"San Diego, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/31/2014,"We wanted a dinner together so we could talk and get caught up.  We were able to get a nice table on the patio that evening which was perfect.  Our waiter, Cory, suggested appetizers and entrees that ended up being delicious!  The salad and salmon choices are the best. But the service we received from Cory really topped off our evening.  He was so funny, friendly and efficient.  He really made our dinner at BJs all the more enjoyable.  Thank you for the piizzokies!!!"
Greg H.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",96,56,13,4.0,4/12/2010,"I've been coming to this BJ's since it opened.  I usually only come here to watch the Laker games and sit in the bar area.  Coralynn and Nicole are excellent servers and Laker fans. I really like the Red and Blonde.  Talking about the beers.  :)  Happy hour is good and weekday lunches are a good deal.  It's usually crowded here after 5pm so be prepared to wait if you come later.   My favorite dishes are the flatbread pizzas (Not a fan of their wanna be deep dish pizza) and their salads.  Pizookies are good too.  Overall the food is good for a chain restaurant.  Better than going to Elephant Bar or Friday's. Also, what's up with Jerry's Deli next door?  It's always empty.  I think it should close down and BJ's should make that into a bar only place.  It would make a killing compared to Jerry's Deli."
jamie j.,"Walnut Creek, CA",146,249,13,3.0,7/11/2012,"Drink (water) service was slow (took about 15 minutes after ordering) and food service was semi-slow (15+ minutes to get salads.) Food not too bad, but all 4 people in my party agreed that their salads (we all had different types) had too much salad dressing - but we were to hungry to send the salad back. Ordered a side of bacon - received two 6"" strips of bacon. $4 was kinda expensive for this little bacon. Clean bathrooms."
Roxy S.,"Torrance, CA",1,15,1,1.0,6/25/2014,"The star that I am giving is solely for the pizookies they have. they are so good. But the rest of the food is so so and unfortunately they are in the business of ripping people off. Some of my girl friends and I were getting pizookies and we had a $10 bill that we split four ways, some with cash some with cards. Shouldn't have been that big of a deal. They brought out only one receipt for the people with the cards and we thought it was fine. We left and found out they charged the cards twice. Then I heard from another friend that the same thing happened to her but they caught it while they were there and the manager wasn't apologetic at all. He didn't care. This makes me think that this is not a good company."
Buck O.,"Torrance, CA",0,7,1,2.0,4/9/2011,"Definitely your average run of the mill establishment. Seating is adequate although some tables situated in a row are a bit compactly fitted especially when they are trying to shoe horn in a high chair between the tables. Most of the dishes I have sampled were pretty tasty especially the pulled pork sliders and flat bread pizza. Their beer selection is vast. Although the last time I went there they tried to pass off one of their brews as a Guinness. pretty evident it was not a Guinness: lack of the traditional foamy head and it had a very bitter taste. My guess would be their porter or stout. Very disappointed in that. Otherwise service was good. Contacted BJS for a reply on their questionable practice by the bartender. Could have been an honest error but......Still have not heard from them. It's now been over a week ago since I wrote to them. Their website states ""Our genuine commitment is to take pride in passionately connecting with every guest, on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail during every shift -- to create and keep fanatical fans of BJ's concept and brand."" Well... they have now lost a customer and my friends."
Skitts P.,"Carson, CA",0,10,,4.0,8/22/2014,"Food is good, but the portions are massive. Happy hour is great! Fair warning though, the bar is extremely small and gets crowded quick! It's best to just sit in a regular table. Order the Irish Root Beer when at happy hour. You won't be disappointed!"
