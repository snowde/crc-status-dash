Julien R.,"Fullerton, CA",596,248,48,4.0,11/3/2011,"Probably the top ""kick it"" spots along side with Buffalo Wild Wings, and Lazy Dog cafe at the Del Amo Mall. BJs definitely has the best deep dish pizzas, no one can beat it. You can customize it and it fills you up while you gulp down on some great tasting beer. If you're a dark ale kind of person, BJs has a wide variety of dark beer a long side with a full bar to get your night going. I also recommended that signature dessert the offer (cookie and ice cream) its even better then the pizza."
Sc Z.,"HARBOR CITY, CA",0,26,1,2.0,11/18/2012,"Went for lunch, we got seated right away . Our waiter was blah, it seemed like he wasnt having a great day. Had the balsamic chicken, it looked better then what it tasted like..."
Annie B.,"Torrance, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/7/2013,"Love the food but the staff kills it for this restaurant. Great appetizers, awesome pizzas and the Oreo pazookie is amazing. The staff needs some more training and some are extremely rude. i feel like the staff around the bar area knows what they are doing but the staff by the booths on the floor need some work. The food is great so i just took off one star for the staff. Now go get some yummy food!!"
Rachel V.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,41,,4.0,2/27/2013,"I love BJ's desserts, try the poozokie :)!!!!"
Anne P.,"Manhattan, NY",73,74,40,3.0,2/11/2010,"Been there numerous times due to the proximity and convenience to Del Amo. Actually ended up sighting Kyla Pratt (voice from The Proud Family), and I wouldn't doubt it if other celebrities dine here as well. The ambiance and atmosphere really keeps the place with long wait lines because the pizookie is worth the wait!  Absolutely in love with the pizookies! Every single one has not failed to be surprisingly delightful. The coolness of the ice cream melts away as soon as it touches the large cookie, and the pieces one-by-one continue to pop that sweet sensation as they enter into your mouth. The edges of the cookie are usually baked just enough so that there forms a hard crust on the outside holding in the flavors from the soft cookie. Definitely a must when you go to BJ's."
Kristin F.,"Irvine, CA",24,32,,3.0,4/2/2011,"I would give this restaurant more stars if they just had better service.  Our party of 4 had to wait for such a long time before we got our food!   Otherwise, the food was great as always and their pizzas and salads are always good.  I love ordering the pizookie since it's basically the thing that I always look forward to :)  Great tasting food, but please just speed up the service."
Mary P.,"WILMINGTON, CA",0,2,,4.0,2/19/2013,Great appetizers and drinks. very beautiful atmosphere. Highly rec this restaurant.
Amanda H.,"Aurora, CO",10,42,15,4.0,6/22/2012,"Had the potato skins for the appetizer which could honestly use some more flavoring but still decent. I had the sweet pig personal pizza which was delicious, boyfriend had the mahi mahi tacos which he really liked. Bjs makes their own root beer which is to die for! I haven't been to bjs in years but the food is definitely worth coming back. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because the service was a bit slow and the waitress took a long time to drop the check and even longer to return with our change."
Megan I.,"Torrance, CA",59,86,15,4.0,4/12/2012,"I have to admit that BJ's seems to always defeat it's chain restaurant rep with me. I'm usually satisfied with the food items here (though I wish they'd bring back the pulled pork sliders..hint hint) but everything is usually cooked well. However, I feel there was an occasion where either a cheddar broccoli soup or mac and cheese order was disappointing to a friend that ordered it. Beyond the savory items, pizookies are the way to go! Just don't look at the calorie count and you'll be in heaven! I usually enjoy late-night happy hour here because nothing's better than enjoying a $2 pint with $1 OFF apps and friends!"
Jacob S.,"Anaheim, CA",1,26,,1.0,12/6/2010,"Wow, I had been to BJ's a couple times for happy hour, and I felt it was a 2.5-3 star experience... The wife and I decided to try BJ's for an early dinner...HUGE mistake.  Inattentive waiter with a half empty restaurant.  He asks if  ""we're ready to order"" within 15 seconds of us sitting down, then doesn't come back to take our order for 12-15 minutes.   Wife ordered a martini...ended up with a margarita (wow, really!?).  My IPA was totally flat, so I ordered a smithwick's...still flat!  Something is wrong with their keg system or something.  The jambalaya was horrifyingly over salted and insanely over spiced (tasted like someone spilled half a bottle of poultry seasoning on it).  The pizza was average, but not worth the terrible experience.   I mentioned (1) the bad jambalaya, (2) wife's wrong drink, and (3) my TWO flat beers.  Waiter just shrugged and walked away.  Never coming back here, especially with PF Chang's and Lazy Dog right next door."
Jocelyn S.,"Las Vegas, NV",227,212,332,3.0,8/13/2011,"Food is ehh, the best things here are the beer choices and Pizzookies.  If I'm just doing food and beer though I prefer Yardhouse."
Christopher T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",52,226,12,4.0,4/29/2012,I went here for lunch with family. Their lunch specials are a great value and I also enjoyed their brews.  I will be coming back here again soon.
Jeff B.,"Culver City, CA",134,54,2,1.0,3/22/2010,"If I could give negative stars, I would.  The service here is probably the among the worst I've had at any restaurant in my life and has been on more than one occasion (I tend to give restaurants 2nd chances, even awful ones). I understand it gets busy on the weekends, I expect that even because the food is good and the beer is fantastic (aside from the Pumpkin seasonal ale, which for some reason, tends to taste more like Jager than a good Pumpkin Ale) So after an hour, we checked in to see where we were on the list and were told it should only be another 10 minutes or so.  My friends and I are patient people, so we waited.  1 hr 45 minutes now, so we check in again as we were told the table would be ready in 10, they apologize and tell us just a few more minutes as they are cleaning the table. Well, for some reason, we kept waiting.  It's like a bad TV show, once you've invested your time into 3 seasons, you have to keep going until you see the trainwreck that is the end of the show in its entirety. After THREE hours and my complaint to the manager, we were seated.  Then, our waitress only came by once to take our order and completely forgot a few of our beers (mine included) until the end of our meal.  At that point, I said ""thank you, but we won't be paying for these"" and I asked to speak to the manager again.  Instead, they comped the beers, when they should have comped half the meal in my opinion. I'll never be going back to this location.  Unfortunately, this type of service has happened at the location off the 405 near Playa Vista as well.  They need to train their staff better overall."
James K.,"Gardena, CA",55,76,,1.0,6/9/2009,"This is basically an amalgam of all the times I've been to this location. First of all, i can't figure out WHY I kept coming back to this place.  You would think that after the first time, I would have learned my lesson. The food itself is really nothing to write home about, everyone seems to go gaga over their pizzas, but I do not think that it's worth $14.25 for a small pizza, which is basically 4 slices.  It's the size of a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut, which costs $10 less than BJs. The service, was to put into one word, horrendous.  Last time, we had a party of 6 and they jammed us into a booth, where my legs went numb from the position I had to sit in order for everyone to BARELY fit in.  Our server did not even come to our table until about 10 minutes later, where after taking our drink order vanished for another 20 minutes.  She finally came back with our drinks, took our orders and then proceeded to never be seen again.  Refills on drinks were something you could only dream of, and the food came out about an hour later after ordering, well almost all of it, because I NEVER got my food.  Yup, I ordered a small Buffalo Chicken Pizza and never received it.  Even after everybody had already finished eating.   At this point, the server decides to FINALLY ""check"" in with us and didn't even realize I never received my food until I gently ""reminded"" her about it.  I finally got my pizza to go, but I never wanted to order take-out pizza that would take 2 1/2 hours to get.  The saddest part of this review though, is that people are still going to go to this place and say it's WONDERFUL..."
Cynthia A.,"Long Beach, CA",417,535,108,4.0,9/24/2011,"I like BJ's happy hour because all mini pizzas are half off which means they are about $5 and their appetizers are $2 off. I love their buffalo chicken pizza, everything off their small bites menu, and of course the pzookie. Great place to have some beers and catch a game or celebrate a birthday with a large group of friends."
Glen C.,"Carson, CA",1431,290,544,5.0,7/15/2009,"PIZZA HUT, MOVE OVER! BJ's Pizza tastes like Pizza Hut, but tastes way more gourmet! GET THE BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA with RANCH! Pricey, but WORTH IT! POSITIVES: -Great vibe of people, customers, and workers! -clean restrooms and enviornment in general! -TV's EVERYWHERE! EVEN OUTSIDE! -THEIR PIZZAS STEAL THE SHOW. NEGATIVES: -it can be PACKED, which SUCKS especially if there's a waiting list! -PRICEY, but worth it. FINAL THOUGHTS: -it's an awesome get-together place to just sit down and eat.   -TRY THEIR PIZZA, DAMMIT! hahaha!"
D N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,48,,2.0,11/22/2013,"Slow, slow, ssslllooowww!!!  I given this place like 5 trys.  They just cant get it together.  Lunch and dinner.  Food is mediocre.  Definitely not worth waiting 1.5 hours for a meal.  Especially during lunch."
Lewis E.,"Fresno, CA",162,4,9,1.0,5/7/2014,"After a long day of traveling my girlfriend and I were in search of some comfort food. We left the hotel and drove into Hermosa and Redondo. It was a Monday night and it was close to 10pm so everything was closed or closing. We headed towards the mall and noticed there were a few restaurants still open. I've never been to a Lazy Dog Cafe and after the way things ended up I wasn't in the mood to gamble the last decision of my day. Since I've been to Bj's many times in different cities I thought I'd win this bet. WRONG. Our server came to greet us, she seemed sweet and took our drink order. She asked if we wanted to start with an appetizer and I thought why not..Avocado Egg Rolls it is! When she brought the appetizer she didn't not bring any plates which made it hard to share so we used napkins. I asked for plates. Just as she dropped off the plates and walked away our entrees arrived. We had not more than a few bites of our appetizers and felt rushed. Oh well I was hoping to get back to the hotel sooner anyway. My girlfriend ordered the Lemon Chicken Pasta and I had another pasta dish that came with olive oil but requested to have cream sauce instead. BTW the person who dropped off the entrees was very short with us, she dropped the food and left. She didn't not ask if we needed anything or if everything looked ok. She must have been a runner/expo I hope not a manager. On to the food. My pasta was angel hair so its easy to overcook, its was mushy and dry. The blackened chicken was dry and tasted like it was made at the beginning of dinner service. My girlfriends entree was the same mushy, pastey and had an overwhelming lemon taste. Our drinks were not refilled throughout the meal and I finally had to ask after positioning my glass at the end of the table. Meanwhile there where 2 bussers at the table next to ours watching soccer while pretending to bus it for 10 minutes. Although our server was nice she didn't seem to be fully engaged in taking care of us. This is probably due to the time of night and Im sure she was juggling side work and trying to squeeze in her tables in between. We presented a credit card as our form of payment but I did hear her ask the table next to us if they needed change. To me that is another sign of rushing or inexperience to assume all of the cash in the guest check holder was hers for the taking. My rating was based on this experience NOT the chain of restaurants. Maybe the next time we are in the Torrance area we will give it another shot!"
Kaitlin F.,"San Pedro, CA",0,12,1,3.0,6/1/2014,good food but very poor service ! it took 40 minutes for my food to come when it wasnt even crowded. they didnt clear our table or refill our drinks.
Elysia M.,"Hawthorne, CA",79,128,32,2.0,3/22/2012,"BJ's food is pretty good. I've been to this location a few times. My last visit was OK. I brought my mom in for dinner for her birthday and had my infant daughter with me. We were seated right away and our server (I believe her name was Cassie) was absolutely AWESOME! She was just GREAT!! --The reason for the 2 stars! The DOWNSIDE to my visit: I walked up to the host(ess) desk and asked the tall gentleman if he would let my server know that it was my moms Birthday and that I'd like a Bday Pizookie for her with a candle. He politely let me know that he would--needless to say, He didn't! I of course didn't want to say anything in front of my mom (it was her Bday, I didn't want to ruin anything) but I was simply PISSED! It wasn't very busy and I don't see how you could forget that after I'd JUST told you...too busy yapping your gums with coworkers to be efficient and accommodating, I suppose. After paying our tab & taking my mom & daughter to the car, I came back in to speak with the manager. I was highly upset, but maintained my composure while expressing to him my utter disappointment. He was semi-understanding & offered a measly $10 gift card to come back for a pizookie. It wasn't about the damn pizookie sir, it was the MOMENT that I can't get back Dipsh*t! I took the gift card, but wound up giving it away. Don't think I'll be visiting here any time in the near future!"
