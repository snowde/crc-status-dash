Mike H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",49,41,21,5.0,4/28/2012,The only reason I'm giving this place a 5 is because of the service. Never once did I reach for my drink and found it empty. Shout out to Nicholas T for the service. (hopefully management reads yelp.)
Cherie H.,"Torrance, CA",14,53,24,3.0,3/10/2012,BJs is alright. I consider it the 2012 version of what Applebees/TGI Friday's were in the 1990's.  The menu is too big making it hard to order but they have pretty much everything on the menu so that can be a plus.  I like the Berry Cider (girl beer) which helps with the wait; people love this place and it's always packed during typical peak eating hours so expect to wait 20-30 maybe even 45 minutes for a table.
Melissa N.,"Boston, MA",46,42,4,2.0,4/13/2012,"I used to love this chain, but this location has pretty terrible service. It definitely shouldn't take an over an hour to get food on a so-so weekday night.  Apart from the service, the food is good -your typical american brewery type. After going many times I typically order either their pizza or a burger because it never disappoints. Avocado egg rolls are yummy. Also, lunch specials are great."

Stephanie C.,"Torrance, CA",47,29,1,3.0,7/20/2012,"Bjs has generally delicious food, though their service has always been lacking. I went here last Friday with my fiance, mom, and her boyfriend for an early dinner. We came in at 6pm and my mom had called ahead so they were already seated (Parking REALLY sucks during Friday/Saturday so arrive early if you don't want to walk or pay for valet).  We ordered drinks and browsed the menu to see what was new. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos (fried) and my fiance ordered the fish and chips, and we were both extremely happy with our orders. My tacos were cooked perfectly, with the cabbage and sauce being perfect, and his fish was DELICIOUS.The server was nice enough, but absent for most of the meal and wasn't good about checking up on refills and other side orders.  If you come here, expect good food with a possibly long wait time and slow service."
Alexis W.,"Los Angeles, CA",20,35,4,5.0,3/24/2012,"I go to this location so many times it's unhealthy. Waiters know who I am and my boyfriend just laughs at me.  Their pizzas are amazing, as are their salads, and desserts. My boyfriend really enjoys their burgers and pasta dishes so definitely try one of those and you won't be disappointed. If you have room left get a pizzookie!! Also, I've only ever had one bad experience which the manager came and fixed and I think took off a percentage of our bill or gave us free dessert. It was great! I recommend everyone to come here."
Jon W.,"Las Vegas, NV",236,25,26,1.0,11/19/2011,The worst service we have ever had... This was the Torrance location. Waited 20 min past their quote... waited 30 min for appetizers which had to be remade 3 times because we didn't want green onions... all food was severely overcooked! Its now been almost 2 hrs since we arrived... looks like We will note return... sucks b/c I will be down here once a month for the next 1.5 years
Xavier M.,"Carson, CA",29,62,17,3.0,6/30/2011,One of the best places for pizza. The other items on their menu are good too. The service is fast and friendly  even when they are extremely busy. The pizookie with vanilla ice cream... amazing...
Marissa J.,"Long Beach, CA",195,26,9,4.0,5/26/2011,"I love this place.. Very clean, the seared ahi tuna is really good! Small portions, but fulfilling my taste buds. I would definitely go again.. Chill vibe. Great place to hang at as well."
Shinobu K.,"Torrance, CA",22,160,150,3.0,1/7/2010,"Wonder Twin powers -Activate! Form of... a PIZZA! Shape of...another PIZZA! (repeat 3 more times). The Super Friends swooped down upon BJ's the other day to take advantage of the limited time only 2 for $20 deal: For every two of us,  1 medium pizza, a soup or salad each and a pizookie to share. Since The Apache and The Samurai couldn't make it, and there were only about 11 Super Friends available, we had 5 medium deep dish pizzas threatening to destroy the table. We were able to try a few slices each. Love it when a plan comes together. I think it was Batman's plan. Mediterranean Pizza. Greek salad-Form of a pizza! Cheeseburger Pizza. Cheeseburger - Form of a pizza! BJ's Favorite - The Works Pizza - in the Form of a pizza! Sorry, couldn't eat more than three of these enormous, thick and heavy slices. So that's my report for now. Aquaman had an Iced Tea. Wonder Woman had one of BJ's house brewed orange soda's which she reported was good, and not overly sweet. None of their house brewed sodas come with ice, unless you ask. But they're refillable. Great service, did a great job with our huge party of 11! Had to wait about 30 mins for a table, and even when it's only been for 2, the waits been really long. You have to come in off hours to get seated right away.  The Flash doesn't have the patience to wait for anything, but the pizza was worth the wait."
Y L.,"Long Beach, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/3/2011,"Just went there for early lunch yesterday. It is not even crowded but it took long time to get our food, our waiter is no where to be found. I have to ask another waiter to check on our order but didn't get a pleasant respond. I understand it's not his table but he didn't have to tell me ""I am busy right now and have a couple things to do"" then walked away. I was shocked to hear that from him. That's the worst customer respond I ever got.  We will not go back to that place again.  I hope BJ's will train their employees for how to respond to customers."
Aimee A.,"Torrance, CA",89,171,20,4.0,1/24/2010,"So MG, the man, and I finally made it a date night...that's right, all THREE of us. We ended up at BJs, since none of us had been to the Del Amo location, and we were seeing ""Legion"" there (word about the movie: don't.)  I was pleasanly surprised how large and airy BJs was...my last experience with them being numerous years ago in Brea, and I remember hating it. But the server (can't remember his name, really nice guy, very good) was attentive, and the food was pretty gosh-darned decent. I have to say I am NOT A FAN of BJs pizza, but that is okay, because I didn't order it. I don't like deep-dish pizza, just not my thing.  I got the Tuscan tomato bisque and a wedge salad, and you know what? That amount and portion was just perfect. The soup was really good...it looked like it could have been super salty (and according to the nutrition guide on the back, should have been), but it wasn't. The wedge salad was great, and fairly nutrious (considering) as well. I really like that the nutrition guide is listed at the back of the menu...it saves you the trouble of thinking, ""God, will I need to workout like five days this week to work this off?"" I just knew what I was eating would take about two days to work off. See? Time saved! It's a fun place...loud, but in a busy-anticipatory kind of way. We had a corner booth, which was perfect...allowed us to people-watch, and tv watch as well."
Andrei T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",49,4,,2.0,10/30/2010,"I have been to BJ's on a few different occasions. This particular location (Redondo Beach) had better customer service than the one in the San Fernando Valley (Victory and Canoga I believe).  My lady and I ordered a deep dish pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. She selected a Coke as her beverage and I decided to try the Jeremiah Red Beer.  The beer was not smooth at all; it had some kind of yeast taste to it and smelled like a wet dog. I had to rinse my mouth with some water and ordered some jack and coke. The server lagged forever, and then he finally showed up with the pizza only. I took a deep berth and explained I was expecting my drink still. He came back with the drink but forgot the dish for my honey.  I don't think I have ever been to any other pizza joint that one can't select a different crust. It's just bread, I'm the customer and I don't want a lot of it. The customer is always right and I am pretty sure I am not the first to suggest having some options when it comes to the amount of bread you have with your pizza. So here we go - with the only option - deep dish - as I moved a slice into my plate I noticed the oil and grease dripping all over...sick. I love cheesy, maybe even a little greasy but this thing was saturated in it. I felt my stomach cringe after the first slice so I boxed the rest and tried some of my honey's meatloaf open face sandwich. It was OK, just a little too salty for me and definitely overcooked (maybe from sitting too long under the heat lamps). Over all this place sucks and we will never waste out money here again."
Anthony N.,"Playa del Rey, CA",4974,2735,19385,3.0,7/1/2009,"We went here before a movie at the AMC Del Amo (Public Enemies, which wasn't that good).  I'm not a big fan of the food here (but if you are a fan of places like T.G.I. Friday's or Applebee's, this should be a welcomed change). The service at BJ's was very good.  We shared one of their deep dish pizzas (which was kind of like a Pizza Hut ""pan"" pizza with lots of toppings).  A medium easily serves three.  They had accidentially dropped the pizza, so the manager came by and said there would be an additional wait.  They comped the pizza, and they even offered soup to hold us over. One waiter had to leave, and another came on, and the transition was smooth.  Finally (though we didn't pay for the pizza), $20 for a pizza at a sit-down place that easily fills three isn't that bad.  So if you are a fan of chain sports bar places, BJ's may be worth a shot."
David S.,"Eastvale, CA",116,47,42,4.0,4/30/2012,Not a great place to go on a Friday night at 7:30 PM. Long waits even for the bar. However I have always found BJ's restaurant to be consistent in their food quality and service. There selection of beer is above par and always ice cold. Valet parking available at Torrance location.
Hugo C.,"San Jose, CA",301,419,231,3.0,12/24/2008,"Within the last month I've dined at BJ's twice. I've had great service, but the food isn't consistent. I had a great meal at BJ's and couldn't stop raving about it. I Liked it so much that I had to come back, and was sorely disappointed. I had the exact same sourdough bacon cheeseburger with potato wedges, and they were like night and day. The girl got one of their deep dish pizzas on one visit and was sad to see their pizza was mostly dough and skimpy on the real ingredients. The next visit she decided to go with a grilled chicken sandwich -- which had to be taken back because the chicken was charred. I feel like going back to BJ's would be a gamble, I just don't know if I'd enjoy dinner -- even if it was topped off with one of their scrumptious pizookie's."
Jennifer T.,"Torrance, CA",45,78,108,2.0,4/12/2011,"Why am I never happy when I leave this place? The service is OK..the food is OKAY, but last time I went, the wait was too long and the guys that were ""hanging out"" at the front desk when you first walk in were sooooo unprofessional. One had on a ""hoodie"" and didn't even look like he was supposed to be behind the front desk. He probably didn't even work there. Who knows? We just left and went to Lazy Dog."
Jerry F.,"Addison, TX",17,114,3,3.0,12/18/2011,"Not a huge fan of large chain restaurants. But, I had lunch here with a bunch of work people, and I have to say that I was impressed. First of all, the service was outstanding. As soon as we sat down, they took our drink orders and came back pretty quick with our drinks and then took our order. I love that. I ordered the Blackened Blue Cheese Burger, and it was a very tasty burger. I would go back for that. I probably wouldn't get the string fries, or whatever they are called, but that's my fault. I think I'm more of a steak fries kind of guy. Anyway, I can't give it 4 stars because I just don't care for places like this. But, overall, if you're into large impersonal corporate restaurants, I think this is probably a good one."
Reno C.,"Carson, CA",44,347,365,4.0,3/13/2009,"This was my third time here, so I decided to review the place. All three times I've sat in the bar area. Do you go to a brewery for the food????? No, you go there for the beer, duh? Do you go to a fancy 'Steakhouse' for fish? You can, but no! Sat at the bar around 4:30p, plenty of room, for an order of wings and a Porter. Ask the bartender for put on the Laker game. Can it get any better? NO! The beers are cold the service was fast, the wings were good. What the heck, its only half time, my Porter is done, let's order more. So, I got the Mediterranean pizza and a Stout this time. Yeah, a Stout. Both were good. As you can tell, I have no problems here, but the drunk guy next to me, whom I bought a beer for (He's out of a job, so he tells me). As they say, all good things will come around."
