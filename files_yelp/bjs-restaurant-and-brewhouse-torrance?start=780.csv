Shirley A.,"Torrance, CA",18,31,,3.0,2/6/2012,"Went there for my B-day.  The pizza was delicious.  The tomatoes were fresh and the parsley tasted like someone cut it from their garden.  The Brunet Beer that I had went down smooth.  Word to the wize though, don't eat the ice cream if you are going to drink beer!  The staff was friendly and the waiter that sang happy B-Day was cute too!"
Sunny D.,"Torrance, CA",20,188,,3.0,10/14/2009,"This place would get 4 stars except for the fact that there is always a long line out the door and therefore a minimum of a 15 minute wait. I also do not like that it is very loud and crowded once you do get seated. The service has always been slightly off when I am there. Although the wait staff seem nice enough, I still get the ""beverage/dessert up sell"" and the ""are you done yet because someone is waiting for this booth"" feel from them. I am not sure if this is emphasized by management or whether they are so understaffed that  those who serve the food ask these questions a few seconds after the waiter does.  In summary it's  your usual business chain type of restaurant.   The positives are that it is a great place to watch sports, there is something for everyone on the menu, and the food overall is pretty good."
Amy K.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,15,,1.0,8/12/2012,"I love BJ restaurants.  This was my first time at the Del Amo location, and it was horrible. First the desk gave me a pager, but did not write the pager number next to my name.  We were outside and they only yelled the names out inside.  (One of the waitstaff told me there is a broadcast system outside, but it wasn't being used).  So we waited an extra long time.   When I asked if there was anything they could do to make up for the mistake, they offered me  pizzokie.  Which the waitress said they would have given to me anyway, since we were celebrating a birthday. Then the wait staff forgot about our salads, and they were brought after the main course. I don't know why the service was so bad at this location on Saturday.    I've been to other locations, and they are great!  But avoid the Del Amo Mall.  Go to the Lazy Dog or PF Changs."
Lydia Y.,"Torrance, CA",69,6,11,4.0,1/17/2012,"I love going here for little sisters' night out during their happy hour.  Even though you don't get seated and you have to wait until a table clears out, we are  satisfied with the service most of the time.  $5 mini pizzas are really priced well I think, and my favorite is the mushroom one with sweet sauce!   To me their menu during regular hours is a bit pricey, but happy hour price is really good. Oh, and I also like how they make their mixed drinks :) Overall they provide a great ambience for a chill night out."
Gil K.,"Torrance, CA",37,439,26,4.0,9/28/2011,"Service is good, the food is your typical big franchise fare, and their beer isn't that good. The thing I really liked was that when we watched Sunday night football there, there was room at the bar and the service there was quick (at least more than expected) and we were able to get our drink on, our food on and our game on at a decent price.  I'll be going here in the future because national's is a little more grungy than this place. Just remember, BJ's is always backed at peak dinner hours so make sure you have 45 - 1 hour to burn if you aren't willing to sit at the bar."
The Reviewer X.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,,3.0,3/12/2014,"Went there with the family. Ordered the Calamari and spinach dip for starters. Ate a few pieces of Calamari and found a hair fried into the calamari batter. They took it back and brought another place of the same. Again, another hair. This is why I gave them 3 stars. However, here is where I give them 5 stars for service. The manager comes out to apologize and assures us that the product (the batter) has been pulled and that they will not serve it. He told us that he would comp our entire meal. Now that is customer service. Thanks, Eric! Atmosphere is cool. Food is good if there isn't any hair in it."
Jennifer S.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,273,49,3.0,9/7/2009,"I've eaten here plenty of times and the service is definitely hit or miss depending on who you get. A few times, wait times have been short, food came out exactly how we wanted it, and service was great. Sometimes though, our name never gets on the all ahead list (which seems to happen a lot) or our server sucks. One time, we had a large party and we asked the server to split the checks since half of us were paying with a card and half of us were paying with cash. She refused and then said if we just told her how much we wanted on each card, she could just do it that way. We said okay, that's fine. So, we wrote down each card and how much money was to be put on it, and we wrote down how much in cash we were giving her so that the total would come out correctly. When we got the check back, we saw that she hadn't paid attention to that at all, and instead had taken ALL the cash as her tip, and overcharged everyone on their cards. Yeah, that's why we wanted split checks! Also, I do takeout a lot and service is also hit or miss there too. Some of their takeout servers are very rude and others are very nice. It depends on who you get I guess. Also, don't do their curbside service. We did it once and it took them 20 minutes to come out to the car. Wtf is that. That's pretty typical too. The thing that keeps me coming back is the great food. The service, eh, not so much."
Ahmed S.,"Alameda, CA",96,327,,1.0,3/19/2009,"I've been to several BJ's in the country and this is by far the worst one. I went here with my brother and his buddy, the quiet one. Got there around 3 pm or so for lunch. Were seated immediately, no wait at all. Waitress was a huge disappointment though. She asked us if we wanted beer and I politely declined, and she seemed to take it personally. She filled our waters only once. Took our orders and never came back to check on anything. Dropped off our pizza order at the table, did not offer to help with the pizza, and just left the bill in the middle of the table. Once again, never came back to check on us and we were sitting with empty water glasses for over 30 minutes. She did come back to grab the bill which to her dismay was missing my card as we were still in the middle of lunch. Even offered to box up our food while we were still obviously eating.  If she was in a hurry she could have been more polite about it. We sat around for a little bit after paying, but she still hung around so it was obvious she was in no hurry to be anywhere. Just horrible service. Food was still good as compared to any other BJ's."
Enrique G.,"Wilmington, CA",5,98,,4.0,12/5/2011,"Coming here and not having the mediterranian pizza would be a crime!!!! Great food, excellent service and a laid back atmosphere!!"
Joseph A.,"Hawthorne, CA",223,35,31,5.0,9/16/2011,"Definitely order the great beginnings, a pizza, then a pizzookie for dessert!!"
Petra S.,"Artesia, CA",417,7,,1.0,12/19/2012,"HORRIBLE SERVICE. Came at 9:30pm and didn't leave until 11:55pm!!! Ordered an appetizer then a pizza. Server brought out the pizza 30min after ordering it and it was the WRONG pizza. Keep in mind we still didnt receive our appetizer. We send the pizza back and the appetizer finally arrives. Later we receive the correct pizza and order a pizookie. Everything seemed to be going better until we asked for the check around 10:45-11pm. The check took forever to arrive; at least 20min and when it did it had two extra items we never ordered on it. We sent it back including a coupon I had and it took another 20-30min to arrive again, but the check STILL had a wrong item and the coupon was ""not working"". We sent it back for the 2nd time and asked for a manager. Once the manger came she did take off all the food except the alcohol but was rude and did not seem sincere or like she cared about our bad experience. Although we did not pay for the food and just alcohol, I am still very upset about the experience and will not be returning to this specific restaurant."
Scott G.,"Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA",166,402,42,3.0,7/13/2011,"Service is ok here, it has its ups and downs.  The food is decent but the desserts and beer is where its at!"
Chase M.,"Torrance, CA",4,51,4,4.0,10/21/2011,"When I came it was very busy and noisy. Got the flat bread pizza and it was pretty good. Also had a pzookie, and I thought that was pretty good. Overall this is a pretty good place to go to."
Margaret N.,"Gardena, CA",210,83,4,3.0,6/26/2008,"The restaurant's pretty cool.  This BJ's opened on Monday at the Del Amo outdoorsy section.  Noticed that Jerry's Deli was open across the walkway as well!  We came for happy hour in the bar area today and it was pretty crowded.  I noticed that there were quite a few parties waiting for tables in the dining room around 6:45.  Who knew Torrance was so poppin'?  The bar area had seats along the bar, some booths (nice!), and tables.  They even had chairs lined up against the wall so you could partake in the happy hour specials without having to cop a table.  The waitstaff and bartenders were buzzing around, quick and attentive. Happy hour is from 3-7 and 10-midnight.  Specials include $1 off drafts and wine (a large selection of drafts at that!), $2 off appetizers (ranged in regular price from $7-15), and 1/2 off mini pizzas--these thick, 5-6 inch diameter, Chicago-esqe pies with various topping combinations. My Blue Moon was $3.95, not terrible.  Checked out the beer menu and saw that they carried some specialty beers--Chimay, Lindemans, and the like.  They also did tastes of their beers on draft.  A cute, skinny 3-4 oz glass would be $1.50, and I think 4 or 5 tastes were $5.50.  A fun way to get your drink on without getting stuck with something you thought looked good but then grew tired halfway down the glass, leaving the beer to get warm and..yeck, I just grossed myself out a little.   I ordered the sliders and wedge fries ($7 regular price) and ate off the appetizer platter ($15 regular price), which offered a sampling of the spinach artichoke dip, santa fe spring rolls, mozzarella sticks, and avocado egg rolls.  The sliders were OK, I'd order them sans fries if I got them again.  Came in a stack of 4, kinda tasty with the diced onions incorporated into the patties.  The appetizer platter was nice.  Pretty much 4 of everything and their respective sauces plus a cup of the dip and tortilla chips in the middle.  Served with a sweet and tangy sauce, the avocado egg rolls were a definite standout.  Avocado, cream cheese, sun dried tomatoes, onions, cilantro, chipotle--creamy, rich, yet spicy!  Pretty freakin' good. As we left, even more parties were congregated around the hostess booth.  I noticed they were sitting around with small plastic plates--samples of the pizza while you're waiting?  Why thank you, don't mind if I do!  (Well, I didn't get a sample, that's a mental note for next time.)  I think I'd come here again for late night dining.  And with Jerry's across the way?  A lot faster than driving out to MDR.  Always looking for spots in the South Bay to get my late night grub on.  Terrible, I know."
n k.,"Coquitlam, Canada",0,78,4,1.0,9/2/2012,"I m appalled by the fact that this place has got 3 stars... Ppl wake up! This is not food that they serve u, it's practically crap, like real garbage... We went there bc my sis insisted their pizzas are such and such... We ordered a medium size pizza half chicken, half veggie and we absolutely no onions on them, with whole wheat. The pizza arrived at our table loaded with i onions and the crest was such a disaster. It was soggy and out of shape and all over the place... I wish I took a pix to post here... We asked for a second pizza with regular crust and NO onions. It arrived practically without a topping on the veggie side!!!! And I mean it! There were 2 or 3 olives on it but they were CANNED olives... And I swear to my everything that pizza didn't cost them more than 30 cents.... I wish there was a no star choice here so I could use it. We had been waiting for 30 min to get a table and I'm still wondering how ppl can be a fan of this place with this disastrous quality of food... Ppl! Try to get a taste for good food and distinguish btw crap and food... Stay away from this place and live healthy. Go try pizza slices at whole foods store and see the difference.  The veggie side was all soggy crust with no veggie on it rather than couple canned olives like we are dumb! And they charge like 20 bucks for a 30 cent pizza... WHAT A RIPP OFF..."
Lilly M.,"Carson, CA",0,42,,4.0,12/16/2011,I love BJ's! Sooooo much! Mt personal fave is the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza! Plus THEIR PIZOOKIE IS BOMB!! THE WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT ONE IS THE BEST!!!! But the service is really slow.
Cynthia D.,"Torrance, CA",103,191,25,4.0,10/26/2011,Loud. Good variety on menu. Decent food. Fun for groups.
Michael R.,"Lomita, CA",33,30,,2.0,12/23/2008,"I have only been here when it wasn't busy, not that it was crushed last night (Monday night), but it was busy. Service was slow and inaccurate though polite. We had beer and desserts so I can't complain about that as both were good.  Management needs to solve the problem of staffing shortage or whatever causes the inability of the harried servers to service their tables in a timely manner and keep track of orders"
Emma B.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,88,1,4.0,4/7/2011,"YUM! I looooooove the Great White deep dish pizza!! Alfredo sauce with chicken on it! And PIZOOKIES!! This is the place to go for pizza and pizookies. Great place for me to entertain coworkers and guests. The beer sampling is fun too. I'm not the type of person who just drinks, I like to taste, so I usually taste something and let a buddy finish it off."
Erika H.,"Harbor City, CA",230,70,45,5.0,5/26/2011,"HELLA busy but food and drinks are YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mac & cheese, pizza, calamari are a few of my faves....oh and of course the PIZOOKIE... can't go to BJ's without having a Pizookie!!!!!!"
