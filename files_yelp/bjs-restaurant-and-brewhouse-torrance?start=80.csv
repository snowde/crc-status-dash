Ju B.,"Torrance, CA",15,4,4,1.0,12/30/2016,"I wish it was 0 stars ! The worst guest service I ever had! My waitress forgot about my table , it took 20 min to bring utensils and napkin. 35 min for a beer. The food it self was not bad. Wen we asked for the dessert (it was my birthday) I took another 30 min, but surprise surprise! They didn't had what I wanted so they brought a mini dessert and said it was on the house! Really? For 4 people? A mini dessert? On my birthday?? Ridiculous!"
Daisy U.,"Norwalk, CA",7,12,6,5.0,3/19/2017,Planned a last minute dinner with friends and Bjs was able to accommodate us. They were very polite and provided everything we needed. I would definitely recommend this location for dinner with friends and family. Amazing customer service.  Used them again March 2017 and amazing. Awesome customer service and everyone in my company was happy that they were so accommodating with all our changes.
Jamie N.,"Redondo Beach, CA",70,66,9,4.0,6/26/2017,"We came in last night around 9.30pm for a late bite. The hostess was EXTREMELY rude. She looked like she believed she was above it all and that she certainly didn't want to be there. I get not wanting to be at work (we've all felt that way at some point or another) but as a hostess or greeter it's pretty much expected of you to be welcoming. We almost left but gave it a chance... we are very glad we did stay because we recieved the best service from our waiter. I only wish I remembered his name. The next time we visit hopefully I will see him again and update this post with his name so everyone can request to be seated in his area :D He definitely more than made up for the initial experience. Managers, either your hostess was having a VERY bad night (as I noticed she was giving the same cold shoulder to everyone I saw coming in) or give that woman a different position. We almost didn't stay because of her."
Joshua R.,"Oakland, CA",286,3,1,2.0,9/2/2017,"Walked in without greetings. I frequent a lot of BJ's brews and the quality here is sub par. Bar seemed kind of dull around happy hour and featured a mess of a front counter to the bar. Waited a whole 5 minutes to clear for us to take our seat, with the manager Mecca passing but I guess she doesn't work. And as im writing this still no water and I'm thirsty it's like 100 degrees outside.  -Passed out dude at the bar"
Serena C.,"Torrance, CA",120,196,202,5.0,2/12/2017,"I don't come here super often, but when I do, we're usually lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar area and skip the long wait. Last night (wish I got her name), our server was awesome. She brought plenty of samples of BJ's beers. I ended up sticking with my tried and true: Sculpin.  She checked up on us regularly and was super friendly the whole time we were there. We got the poke and mushroom strips as appetizers and I got the shrimp and asparagus penne pasta.  The poke was bomb as always.  Some of the batter on the mushroom strips were much too mushy, but we just peeled off the batter. My pasta was really good doused in Parmesan and pepper flakes (bc I love cheese and chili). We ordered the sampler pizookie-- all really good, but couldn't finish bc we were so stuffed.  Pretty pricey (maybe that's why I don't come too often), but really thinking about throwing this into my rotation of restaurants."
Dianna R.,"London, Canada",1216,118,238,5.0,10/1/2015,"It's been awhile since I've reviewed this place! Service is still great! My friend and I sat in the bar area because we wanted small bites and some drinks. We didn't notice that they blocked off the booth we sat at because there was a pipe leaking in that area. When the waitress came to let us know, she began to move us to another table in the bar area. A guy was just about to sit at the table but she politely told him she was escorting customers to the table. Yay! We ordered a round of bloody marys and the garnishings that they put in them was sooooo delicious! I wanted to just order a side of it! It was an olive, a pickled string bean, and some pickled thing that looked like a tiny grape-sized bell pepper. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls which were pretty good and calamari but the best part of the meal was of course, the pizookie! We decided to get the s'mores after asking the waitress if we should get the trio or just get one large s'more since they don't allow it as an option in the trio. She suggested to get the s'mores and we were definitely not disappointed!!! It was soooo delicious!"
Jose M.,"Lakewood, CA",23,11,2,5.0,4/19/2017,"Ohh my goodness where do i start!!! Man do this restaurant have a extensive menu and damn good beer selection. Me and my party ordered quite of different variety of appetizer and soups. All amazing from the Cheddar Broccoli soup to the Root Beer glazed Ribs. I myself ordered a plate of jambalaya and a house pale ale beer. Jambalaya was not to greasy and nicely seasoned with bell peppers, green onions, and tomatoes. The beer was smooth and with a nice kick to it. We will be going back for sure!!  Ohh and I forgot thanks Maricela for the great service."
Ken F.,"Harbor City, Harbor City, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/10/2017,Had the worst time.  We had arranged a farewell party for 15 about one month earlier.   Friday June 9th came and we went there at our arranged time of 7:30.  Well the places was packed.  They did not seat us until 8:10. And when they did we had to split our group into two very small booths.   But there was another group of 15 and got seated in an off the major dining floor in a separate room.   To me it seems that the manager made a racial decision to give them the room and give us the split booth decision.    Needless to say I will never go back to BJs again.   Also when I asked the manager what they are doing to seat us.  She was rude and did not even apologize for the wait even though we had made a reservation weeks before.  Every one should stop going to this BJs go to long beach instead.
Kalee G.,"Long Beach, CA",24,20,23,3.0,8/30/2017,"Really nice staff. Very friendly and helpful. The only complaint is that they changed their Asian Salad recipe.. I think it used to be a Sesame Asian Chicken Salad, which used to be AmAzing.. now it's just not the same. Please please please bring back the oldie but goodie"
Kester D.,"Chino Hills, CA",144,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,The service here is extremely bad. Came here for one of my best friends birthday and I've been waiting here for almost 15 mins just to get drink orders. Two other tables who came later than me got their food while I'm barely getting my drinks. Very unacceptable and very unprofessional service!!
Kerri H.,"Torrance, CA",1489,638,2719,5.0,8/5/2015,Another fun night at BJs happy hour.  Spinach and artichoke dip for $5!!! Whoop!!! Wine is half off on Tuesday buy I'm still getting over a cold so no drinks for me!!! Loved being here with nice people
Diana T.,"Redondo Beach, CA",407,328,1450,4.0,7/4/2016,It's a chain so what can I say? Food is good and hot. I got the calamari and lunch pizza and salad. The waiter kept my strawberry lemonade filled so that was great. When it came to getting the check and I was in a rush it took forever. And it's so big it's hard to flag down ur waiter. I also came on a Monday afternoon.
Israel V.,"Inglewood, CA",0,6,,2.0,8/10/2017,"The food is ok, usually comes out cold. I only receive good service 1/5 times I visit. Bazookis are good tho."
Shannon S.,"San Pedro, CA",67,19,3,5.0,12/22/2016,"In cocktail Joe Joe kept it going... Five stars!!! Pizza was delicious,  Joe Joe kept on cruising around making checked backs freaking awesome service!!!!"
NikkiSweet T.,"West Covina, CA",9,3,1,1.0,12/10/2016,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERIVCE!!!! It only got one star but because I had to rate it.  Sat down waited 20 minutes just to place a drink order, another 30 minutes for our food to come out. I wanted a pazooki and it never came, the sever kept telling me it's coming it's coming. At this point all I wanted was to go home, I finally got up and went to talked to a manager and I told him how the night has been and I just would like to go home. We got there well before 8:30 and it's now 10pm. I'll never return to this bj's, EVER!"
M V.,"Bellflower, CA",0,5,,1.0,8/12/2017,Horrible customer service. Horrible manager. Horrible food. I completely disagree with the way they are doing business. I will not return and be writing a letter to corporate.
Michele A.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/16/2017,I will never go to this BJs again!  This was a three hour ordeal!  We had to demand to be sat after waiting for and hour and fifteen minutes.  The hostess had stated it would be a 25 to 30 minute wait.  The waitress was so slow!  We had to ask for more water every time!  She would not pay attention and disappear for 20 minutes at a time!  Food was good but so not worth the wait!  I live .3 miles away but I will never go to this restaurant again!  Please do not waste your time!
Jazlyn E.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",22,60,92,4.0,4/22/2017,"This place gets very busy!! I recently have started coming here more often because one of my close friends work here. It's not bad food and everyone working is very nice. The pizookies are the most popular thing here! Last night I tried the trio (monkey bread, triple chocolate, and chocolate chunk) and they were are very good! My favorite here is the Santa Fe salad with chicken!!"
Steve R.,"Torrance, CA",2,15,3,1.0,9/17/2016,"Just got home from BJ's. This was my first time eating here. We ordered bacon cheeseburger, cheeseburger, mahi mahi, clam chowder, French dip sandwich.  Upon entering, the front receptionist didn't say a word...  But she looked up, tilted her head at me, and puckered her lips, like ""what the hell do you want"". I was like, party of 6 please.  ""We'll call you but I'm-a tell you right now iz gonbe 40-45 minute"".   FML.  Money not well spent I must say.  Biggest issue beyond the front desk is the food temperature.  All of our food was just mildly warm.  It could be so much better with some kick ass management to clean house of all the lazy waiters."
Maya A.,"Long Beach, CA",5,31,29,1.0,4/4/2017,Omg! Why did I come back to this place? Oh yeah.. my fiancé wanted to have a beer last night. Okay fine.. the beer was great. What I regret is buying the calamari. Such a waste of money. $10 for an appetizer but only what? 8 pieces of it. Not worth the $10 I payed for. My fiancé wanted pizza. I told him don't even buy the food here.
