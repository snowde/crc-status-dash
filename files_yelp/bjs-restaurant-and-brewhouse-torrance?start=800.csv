Silvana C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",17,49,5,4.0,9/5/2009,"Love it! they close late so if im home hungry and bored on a weekend i call a friend and we go there sit at the bar have some of their good beers and order the best pizzas ever, you have to try them they are really good. I also like their salads and sandwiches. The restaurant its nice and big so its good for groups. The service is alright, some servers are good some bad just like in any other place. You might have to wait long but i think its worth it. I live in Torrance and go out a lot and this is one of my number one options. Prices are average. good place!"
Qanelle J.,"Arlington, VA",84,478,4679,2.0,7/17/2008,"I visited BJ's Brewery for a welcome lunch for a new coworker.  It wasn't my choice, but I'm supposed to show departmental pride and support my new team members.  Bleh. I ordered the blackened chicken and a house salad with raspberry vinaigrette.  The salad itself did not taste fresh and the raspberry vinaigrette tasted even worse.  There was no hint of raspberry at all in that dressing!  It was so bad that I didn't bother finishing it.  The sandwich was poor too.  It seemed like all the sandwiches my coworkers and I ordered had the bread toasted/grilled with butter so the bread tasted very oily and unhealthy.  The chicken was dry and I could barely taste any spice that I should have tasted in blackened chicken.   I'm definitely not a fan of this place! Go Trojans!  Fight On!"
Kamuela A.,"San Pedro, CA",0,22,,1.0,9/3/2012,"Made it pass the front door with poor customer service.  Not even hello welcome to B.s. oops BJ's.  This was at 6pm on a Friday evening.  Sat at the bar area and more bad attitudes from the lady behind the bar.  Got up with my friend and walked out. Will never return. ""Only a matter of time before they close their doors look at the restaurant across."""
William L.,"Inglewood, CA",3,22,1,1.0,11/2/2013,"i never write reviews unless it is really bad , either service or cleanliness or i get really sick, wich was the case at bjs in torrance, we just ordered pizza , salad and she had a drink ,... over priced !!! and i had a regular iced tea. tasted a bit funny , but did not think too much about it. i was up all night getting sick !!! never again , and i insist somebody check hygiene and cleanliness in the kitchen !! call john from bar rescue to yell at these people and clean it up,before more people get sick!!"
Winnetka W.,"SAN PEDRO, CA",123,126,55,3.0,4/21/2011,Not too bad for lunch. It's way to crowded at night. Super helpful staff (some) and there chicken pesto flat-bread appetizer (which is scrumdiddliumcious) is enough to be a meal.
Denise Y.,"Torrance, CA",101,54,11,4.0,5/30/2009,"PIZOOKIE... that's all I have to say  :)  No, really, the food is great, but I'm hooked on the original chocolate chunk pizookie and so is my family.  If friends haven't had pizookie, I always suggest we go to BJ's so they can get hooked too (I haven't had anyone not be hooked). My favorite dish to split is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  They give you two chicken breasts with a big scoop of mashed potatoes and a side of steamed broccoli.  The pizza and pasta dishes are delicious too.  For lunch, I sometimes get a soup and salad.  The broccoli cheddar or the tomato bisque are great comfort soups and the Caesar or Honey Crisp Chicken salads are good.  The kids and I like their cream soda or the strawberry lemonade to wash down all the great food!  When the kids aren't around, I like to drink the Berry Burst Cider  :) Lunchtime is hit and miss for being crowded, but dinner is always a long wait.  We always ""call ahead"" so they place us on the waiting list before we arrive.  It works out really well when they're busy and we usually don't have to wait more than 30 minutes.  For large parties, it's always good to reserve in advance."
Chris V.,"Torrance, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/22/2010,"Great Beer! Great Food! Great Pizookie! This BJ's gets 5 stars from me and no, it's not the beer talking. I love places that make their own beer and BJ's does so very well. I love their Nutty Brewnette and Jeremiah Red. Great Beers! The food has never disapointed me at BJ's. Last time I was there I had the ribs. Oh man. The ribs literally fell off the bones and were full of flavor. I wouldn't say they're as good as a smokehouse's or something pro like that, but they were reeeeeeally good ribs. Don't get me started on the Pizookie. How can anyone not like ice cream on a freshly baked cookie?! The Ghirardelli Pizookie is to die for. No, literally, it will probably kill you with chocolate goodness if you try to eat the entire thing. It is one of the most rich desserts I've ever had and wonderful. The place can be a little loud when packed (especially if a game is on) but I think that should be expected for a good brewhouse. You don't really want a bunch of silent people sitting around drinking beer do you? That'd be a little depressing... As someone in a wheelchair, the seating is pretty nice (no pun intended.). Not too crowded when at tables which is nice for not having waiters snagging a handlebar or something.  Go to this BJ's and show it some love! Now I want a Pizookie..."
S B.,"Vallejo, CA",103,144,41,4.0,7/28/2011,"Calamari & deep dish pizza was on point & hit the spot , would of gave it 5 stars but they didn't have the lettuce for a ceasar"
Ann A.,"Torrance, CA",0,8,,2.0,1/10/2013,"Was there last night with a large group.  The staff was awesome, the food was bad and it was way to noisy."
Lynn J.,"Lakewood, CA",0,21,4,1.0,8/22/2013,Why doesn't this location have Oatmeal Raisin pozookie?  Seems like all the others were a variation of chocolate.  This is the only reason we went there instead of pf changs.
Teej T.,"Urbana, IL",668,663,20,3.0,8/6/2008,"It's a total chain, and if you've lived in San Diego or Orange County, you're already probably very familiar with it.  This one is huge and a bit more impersonal for it.  The waitstaff are very friendly, efficient, and thoughtful, but overall, there are more unique and tastier places you can find on your visit to Torrance. However, if you jsut want a dessert, it's all about the pizookie.   Pan pizza sized cookie covered ice cream?  Delicious.  I know Americans are often stereotyped as obese, self-absorbed consumers, but I'm glad to take that label if I can have one of these babies.  Yum."
Favian R.,"Merit-Carson, CA",3,29,6,4.0,8/9/2011,"I'm such a fan now!!! I will admit the food isn't blow my brains crazy but it is good and the service is adequate. I had the California Burger and it was a very tasty burger, it had avocados and I think provolone with a chipotle mayo on a sourdough bun and my mouth was watering lol, The fries are so-so, I really didn't care about em. Obviously they are known for the pizza here and it is a very tasty pizza almost deep dish style but definitely not Chicago deep dish. I recommend the buffalo ranch pizza it's something different and it's very good and please get the strawberry lemonade mmmmm delicious. Overall great place to relax and get some good grub."
Shaun S.,"Torrance, CA",116,158,20,4.0,4/14/2013,like it here and would come here more toften if tehy had a cusomter card or coupon!
Jake A.,"Torrance, CA",1,14,,2.0,11/15/2012,i been there a few times. foods good but the service is not so good everytime i go. its slow and servers have bad attitude. hope they get better.
Gayle P.,"Winter Park, FL",8,30,,1.0,11/4/2011,"NEVER, I repeat, NEVER book a large party here if you want your party to be a pleasant experience!!! I booked a 30 person party a month in advance in an 8pm slot. We were seated at 10:15pm. By that time, many of my son's friends had been picked up by their parents. We ended up with about 8 who could stay. However, BJs still charged us for a 30 person pizza buffet!!' The server was awful. My son and many if his friends ordered root beers, which sat empty most of the time. But, as always, every place has their savior, and at this place it would be DANE. If I were just giving a rating on him, it would have been 5 stars. Seriously, if you want to eat here, call ahead to see if he's working. If he's not, head over to Lazy Dog; they'll take care of you.  Go for DANE...tip him well...he's worth every dime!!'"
Gail K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",136,147,3,4.0,4/8/2011,I have to say that I love BJ's for all the evilly delicious beers and bar food!!! I have not had a bad thing off the menu yet and there signature tatonka stout is one of my favorite beers! It is only my eater's guilt that gives it takes away a star!!!
Jessica A.,"Wilmington, CA",79,43,9,5.0,8/16/2008,"I waited a few weeks after it open to try it. I must say, I was impressed. The place is totally random i loved it. The bathroom has random pictures of hot guys lifting tires, flowers and Marilyn Monroe. They booths are so beautiful. The food was great and really well priced. I thought I was gunna pay up the but it was really reasonable. Of coarse I got me the Angus Beef burger. IT WAS AWESOME. I would recomend this place to anyone. I went with a party of 6 and everyone was very happy."
Ryan B.,"Chesapeake, VA",2,10,2,4.0,8/23/2011,This place is always a little loud but always has good food.  Their craft beers and ciders are amazing and make sure you get the Pizookie for desert.
Cris I.,"Costa Mesa, CA",170,148,27,2.0,7/29/2008,"Bj's is famous with my group for always having dirty silverware haha. Everytime we go there's something wrong from having dirty silverware or plates or our orders taking forever.  We went to this Bj's when it first opened and it still had that Bj's charm with the dirty silverware.  We we placed our order it took forever to get our drinks. I was the last one to get my drink and she kept saying ""oops i'll be right back"", this went on after we got our pizza! I had asked her for silverware as well and i didnt get it until the pizza had been out for a long time along with my drink.  The service here was pretty bad and it took her another 30 minutes to bring us our check. Then when we got it BAM she charged us extra for things that we didn't order. I think it will be a while before i go back here. If you live in the area and want Bj's maybe you should just make the drive to the cerritos location which gives us better service, and better pizza."
Gregorio A.,"Shibuya-ku, Japan",128,188,40,1.0,3/18/2011,"The most repulsive, artificial, bland, disgusting ""deep dish"" pizza ever. two pieces of white bread over guinea-pig pellet cheese. never again"
