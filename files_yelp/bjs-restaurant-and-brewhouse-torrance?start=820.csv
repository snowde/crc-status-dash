Larry M.,"Los Angeles, CA",16,6,8,2.0,10/2/2010,I went to BJs today and ordered a pizza which turned out ok but the service was not as good as I though. The server got my friends order wrong and did what they could to fix it but I told them to hold off on giving me my food and  i specified to keep my food hot in the kitchen till my friends food was prepared and ready to be served so when they brought out my pizza along with my friends food it was warm/simi cold  and not hot as it should have been.
Y B.,"Washington, DC",6,67,2,4.0,5/23/2009,"I'm delighted with BJ's in Torrance. The food really is excellent and far better than their competitors, e.g. Jerry's, TGIFriday's, Outback, or whatever else you may want to compare it to. The parmesean chicken is literally the best chicken served in the South Bay region.  Also, their pizzas are some of the best around. Highly recommended. The only bummer is that they never take reservations and the wait is VERY LONG on Thurs-Sun."
Brittany R.,"San Pedro, CA",1,1,,2.0,12/14/2011,"I recently ate at this location this past week with my mother and 3 year-old daughter. It was only about 1 pm in the afternoon. Slightly busy. The food is very delicious and great but I'm afraid I cannot say the same for the service! The host sat us down in one of the rows of booths. It took our server about ten minutes to just come and take our drink orders! Once we got our beverages my mother ordered the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. I ordered a giant suffed baked potato with a small salad and chicken strips for my daughter.       The first order that came was my baked potato (that came with a small side of mixed butter, sour cream and barely any chives). Then the chicken strips and lastly my mother's soup and salad along with my salad! Even our waitress was shocked the potato came before the chicken strips or the salad and soup. Our waitress was really nice but seemed very busy waiting on what seemed the entire row of booths we were in. She didn't even ask my mother if she wanted more of the unlimited soup or salad.      I feel the restaurant needs more structure for the waiters/waitresses. The servers should know what tables they are in charge of. If they do know it really doesn't show.  It just seems that whatever order comes out on the kitchen counter, any server who notices it just takes it out to the table if they're waiting on it or not. I understand that the staff are probably just looking out for each other so no customers get cold food but it looked very chaotic and needs some more order! In my opinion. Food is great though but the experience was just a pain in the butt!"
Kay B.,"Los Angeles, CA",154,47,8,4.0,3/10/2009,"LONG Wait on weekends, but the food is good. My favorite is the Calzone. I also like the Great White Pizza (i think thats the name) as my second choice. For drinks, Im not a beer drinker, so I opt for the Ciders. The Berry Cider is good, the Pear is my favorite, but not of them are bad.  I love the Pazookie for dessert as well. I havent had bad service at this one, but it is very crowded on weekend nights. Ive been to the ones in San Diego and in Cerritos and they arent nearly as crowded."
Lizz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",633,232,973,1.0,6/15/2010,crap food. I had some sort of pasta and asked for no meat on everything I ordered incl. the salad and everything had meat on it. and it was incredibly greasy (my pasta) and my bf's burger was deep fried in everything and looked repulsive. boys. the servers need to start writing down orders. also the floor is very slippery. every time I went there I slipped on the floor at least twice. Do not wear heels to this place. Extremely fattening food. I prefer the Yardhouse and their Spicy tuna or the pizzas there..
Johnny F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",72,39,30,4.0,3/13/2011,"Great for lunch, had a wedge salad, a pint of Jeremiah Red and a personal pizza for $10!"
Jasmine A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",149,694,154,4.0,7/24/2008,"Oh delicious! I love BJ's! This BJ's location is huge and very crowded. Conveniently they have call ahead waiting, so you can just call before you leave home and put your name on the waiting list, which i would really recommend doing because this place is crowded!  I don't get how people come to BJ's and don't get the pizza. Its thick, but not dry thick, instead buttery delicious thick, like a pillow of goodness. I think they put way enough toppings on their pizzas, and every bite is something good. The crust is amazing...the back edge has cheese that's melted to a delicious crisp and it's just really good. I do personally like to ask for extra sauce on my pizza, because I think it makes it better. Of course the beer is good, and the beer taster sets are fun (a rainbow of beer!) and a good deal. The service was kinda  all over the place...he brought our bill before we were done eating pizza and hadn't even ordered our pizookie which ended up taking like 30 min to come out, and they messed up the orders for both of the tables sitting next to us and they ran out of avocado egg rolls. But whatever, they were pretty crowded. Don't go to BJ's and not get the pizza."
lynette b.,"Long Beach, CA",83,32,23,3.0,4/14/2011,"bj's almost everyone has been here.its your normal hang out with group of friends your your ""friend"".so lets get to the point, and the rundown of things: 1.the sampler - first timer here?try the beer sampler.it's little glasses of the beers that they offer 2. i personally prefer the blondes and light beers 3. pizookies are when you want your craving of sweets 4. the margherrita pizza is sweet and saucy.i love! 5. avocado appetizer roll is good but sometimes ca get too spicy for me.because it is spicy 6.chicken wings - gotta have the wings, no matter what 7. spinach dip is normal 8. calamari is ok 9. tick crust pizza - not a big   a thin crust girl"
V L.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,9,,4.0,8/25/2013,"Came for their friends and family 50% off large pizza deal, their pizza is good once in awhile.  One good thing is that they seem to be real consistent, you a know what you will get."
Christine T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1006,683,2453,3.0,12/13/2010,"Chicken pesto flatbread pizza!!! If u haven't tried it, try it now!!"
Rick K.,"Los Angeles, CA",132,552,22,3.0,7/28/2008,"Word of advice... don't go. Service is alright, but it's overcrowded, noisy, and small. I remember waiting a long time after my friend had made phone reservations.  Anyway.... as much as I like BJ's, i just cant give this one a rating above 3 stars. It is just not as good as other BJ's.... and it comes down to the entire package... service and vibe."
Lisa H.,"Valley Village, Los Angeles, CA",66,80,11,4.0,1/18/2009,"Any restaurant in this area will be jammed with people, just because it is Del Amo.  I grew up in this area....it's my mall rat history.  So any new place is a novelty.  I love them in SD, was thrilled when I found one close to my parent's. I love BJs, can't resist the Pazookie with it's hot, gooey cookiness, draped in ice cream.  It is an automatic instinct to order one of these and usually the topic of conversation before we even look at the entree list. The beer list is respectable.  Your usual suspects on tap with a few surprises.  The house beer is good stuff for the price.  But one can not survive on beer and pazookie....hmmmm, or can I.  I wonder...... The few times we were here it wasn't a horrible wait.  But, we seem to time our arrival for the off crowd - which there is one.  My dad really likes it because he can watch his beloved games while he chows down in his mad, quiet fashion. As for the food, it is quite tasty.  Yeah, it is a chain but it is decent.  Not, OMG this is awesome but decent.  Service is okay... they were busy with the Sunday Brunch crowd and a birthday party (for brunch at BJ's??).  The waiter took a while but made up for it with bringing refils and his entertaining personality. BONUS....this is someplace to take someone who doesn't want to have the annoying attention because it is your birthday.  They bring out the birthday dessert (my brother chose the Apple Crisp) with a candle.  We sang him Happy Birthday with out too much obnoxious pomp and circumstance.  Kinda nice when you are too old for that shit...."
Jenny D.,"Carson, CA",23,29,7,1.0,2/21/2011,Ok.where do I strt.... the wait was a lil....when we ordered drinks....the beer took forever..... when we got the appitizer..we got no napkins..... we had to look for the waiter to get another drink...it took ages to come as well....overall food sucks.....horrible service....so dnt bother comin to this bjs
Kanisa H.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,38,31,3.0,12/8/2010,"This place is okay...I like the atmosphere.  Not too many foods I can rate considering I order just about the same thing each time I go, which is the Scampi Pasta with extra alfredo sauce on the side.  It is pretty good.  However, I have tried a few appetizers.  The chicken lettuce wraps are ok.  I've tried the Best Beginnings Appetizer combo (spinach & artichoke dip, avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls and mozarella sticks).  I love avocados, but did not enjoy the avocado egg rolls at all.  There was no flavor.  They would have been better off slicing up a avocado and putting it on a plate, I think I would have enjoyed that more.  The other appetizers were just ok."
Shaun K.,"Carson, CA",127,47,22,2.0,5/7/2010,By pass this place if your looking for good food. The prices are jacked up for some mediocre pizza and pasta. Cant say much more than that.
Dan D.,"Encino, CA",39,130,3,3.0,12/19/2010,"The pizza was ok, but didn't live up to the things I had heard about this being the place for Chicago-style pizza. I noticed the Parmesan cheese on our pizza wasn't fully melted, and the pizza was cool enough to eat as soon as they brought it out. I wonder if they are just toasting it. Also, there was a 30 minute wait to get seated. Not sure why they are so popular."
Aaron F.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",215,424,,1.0,11/14/2010,"This seems to be a running theme with service I have been experiencing. Don't get me wrong, the food is great and I would kill for some pizookie right now. However, service is horrible. This is the third location I have had bad service. A few years ago I made reservations a week in advanced for my birthday. I get there early and find that they have no record of me reserving a few tables with about 10 people. After waiting with my party for about 25 minutes they finally got everything together and apologized profusely for losing my reservation.  Even friends and family that go here always complain about the servers messing up orders or simply forgetting things. Not going to this location again. ANY B.J'S AROUND HERE WITH GOOD SERVICE?"
Gail L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,52,1,2.0,2/24/2011,"Had lunch at BJ's today and although food was tasty, service was abysmal.   My party of 6 was seated promptly, and then continued to sit.  15 minutes later, we still hadn't even been acknowledged, or offered drinks.  Finally went up to the front desk to complain.   At that point, the host (we later found out that he was the lead trainer) took our full order and apologized for the wait.  He was great.  The drinks were delivered by another girl who again apologized for the wait and told us our server's name (you know, the one who never acknowledged us). At that point the manager came over and offered us beverages and dessert on the house.  Like I referenced earlier, the food was good.  Guess what?  When it came time for the check, no one would deliver it.  Finally, our designated server came up and said ""oh, I thought that the host was taking care of you, I didn't know that your table had been reassigned to me"".   Ummmm, we thought this was very funny, because if she had helped us in the first place, we would not have had to get the host involved. We flagged down the manager again and he covered our entire meal ""on the house""  because the service was so bad.  Let's see...  We couldn't get anyone to wait on us without tracking down the manager, drinks were never refilled, condiments were not offered, and no one ever came over to check on our food.   It was very nice of the manager to take care of our meal, but frankly, I'm fairly certain we won't be back any time soon."
Emma N.,"Compton, CA",4,8,,5.0,7/8/2013,"I love this place! the staff is amazing, their suggestions were really good and they're not ""fake"" polite, very genuine. the food was really good i love the appetizer california flat bread pizza"
