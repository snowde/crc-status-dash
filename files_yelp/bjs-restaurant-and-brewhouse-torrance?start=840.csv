Jerico H.,"San Pedro, CA",106,118,26,1.0,12/17/2011,"so I came here because it was my wifes b day dinner and weve never tried it... let me say i liked the past a i tried but after the bill came it was over 100 bucks for 3 people, really? the waiter thought he was fucking slick by telling me to drink up my beer and hed get one on the house, but yet i was almost charged for it. i know ways the employees upsell you, its their job  but dont fuckin lie to me and try and charge  me for something u told  me was free. the service  was OK the waiters mediocre...sorry to say ive had better beer, i like to give good reviews more than bad ones but i must warn other fellow drunks. its not funny thats how you loose people...for that reason youve been chopped!"
Amir C.,"Gardena, CA",23,21,4,3.0,1/14/2011,"This place is always super crowded. I'm digging the basalmic glazed chicken, definitely try it. The service there is unpredictable but seems to be better at night. Definitely hold out for a booth unless you want a million people walking by your table. The other reviews are right about staying on top of the servers. Unfortunately your experience is kind of in your own hands here."
De'Yeneico W.,"Downey, CA",27,5,,1.0,4/28/2013,"Friends have been raving to me for years how great BJs is so I finally said ok let's go. WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER! I'm typically a patient & understanding person but I was beyond pissed with their service. The 30 minute wait for a table when there were about 4 tables open was the least of the problems. Our original server was a bug! She kept coming to the table literally every minute before we even knew what we wanted. Then after we put our order in they switched servers on us. It took them over an hour just to bring my appetizer and it was the wrong one. Literally every customer that came after us received their food before us. They brought our entrees about 5 minutes afterwards. The toppings on my pizza were wrong and the bread on my friends sandwiches was had as a rock. When they finally got my appetizer of boneless wings right they were smaller than a McDonalds chicken nugget! I had completely lost my appetite & just wanted to leave. They knocked off my appetizer, half off our entrees, and gave us free desserts but I was far from pleased. They were still taking forever just to even bring the check. They took so long that I was late for work. 2 and a half hours of my life wasted. BJs will NEVER receive my business again!"
Capo M.,"Torrance, CA",1,45,1,4.0,6/20/2011,"this place is a good alternative if you want to have some drinks and food. they open until 1am on the weekends, which is great for Torrance. I don't like to wait for table so i opt for their bar which is first come first serve. Good atmosphere and crowd. Hosts and general service staff are friendly and attentive.  They have a full bar; drafts beers, domestic, and imported drinks.  The Clam Chowder in carved sourdough bread is delicious. Steaks and hamburgers are some of my favorites too.  I would not recommend their bloody Mary drink, but any draft beer, you cant go wrong."
John P.,"Carson, CA",4,8,3,1.0,2/8/2012,"So far the worst BJ I've ever been to and I've been to the ones in OC. The service staff obviously could not count as well as the servers because they seated us(6 people) in such a small space and table that we had to complain and be moved into the patio. Untensils that was given to us was only for four and not six so we had to ask for that not to mention plates too they only had four, c'mon simple common sense... And then there's the drinks, our server is so confident he'll remember our order that he doesn't even write anything down. We asked for ice teas some water with lemon wedges and all we got was sprite and plain water without lemons. My mom was also treated offensively, we were ordering our appetizers and my mom wanted the lettuce wrap and the server said that it was her main meal. I mean seriously? Don't you know the definition of appetizers? So the best part was when all of our order came in and they have no room to put it in because they put us in a pretty shitty table seating and space and that is why they had to move us when we complained the best part was when the server asked us if we want help to move our food, lol seriously these people are so idiotic and offensive. Talked to the manager and we let them know how shitty their service was and are a disgrace to the restaurants franchise name. All in all we will never go back to this place again and I hope that this experience will never happen to you or your family!"
Wayne L.,"Torrance, CA",0,8,,4.0,4/14/2013,"Like the menu variety, acceptable service, lots of beer choices, clean, modern ambiance. Calories are included on menu. Good place."
Laurie T.,"Torrance, CA",173,128,184,3.0,9/10/2008,"OPENING DAY. super sucky wait time. they said 1 hour wait. 2.5 hours later, we got seated. 30 mins later we finally got someone to take our order. 1.5 hrs later, everyone was finally served. couldn't anyone to refill our waters to save our lives. PIZOOKIE was not as big as people made it sound. disappointed. had to order a few more. we did get to sit at the corner table under a fancy chandelier.  HAPPY HOURS. I come here often enough for a happy hour. it's decent. love a pizza, spinach and artichoke dip, and a pear cider"
John G.,"Lomita, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/14/2013,"Beer was flat. Food was average if it arrived hot and being as most arrived cold, it wasn't even that good. You're better off spending your money elsewhere."
Nikki S.,"Los Angeles, CA",267,501,82,3.0,7/13/2008,Yay finally a local BJ's. Really the only reason I go here is for the PIZOOKIE. Black & white and smoothered with vanilla ice cream. Other than that I get salads so I don't feel like a fatty when I devour the pizookie and sometimes I get a pizza and maybe some beer.
Josh A.,"Fullerton, CA",0,48,,4.0,6/18/2013,"I love BJ's and its rowdy yet appropriate atmosphere for this particular chain. The food is good, the service friendly and attentive most of the time. Their pizookies are somewhat overrated, and not as large as I'd like them to be but come in a variety of flavors and are a fine way to polish off a meal. Not recommended for people who fancy a quiet, soothing atmosphere."
Jennifer Lynn A.,"San Pedro, Los Angeles, CA",60,12,23,1.0,12/18/2012,"Worst service ever!! Went there for lunch with a friend, my beer was beyond flat--so disgusting. The waitress took forever to come take our order and then the food took twice as long to arrive and when it did, it was awful. The pizza was just as bad as pizza hut, so greasy. My friend and I tried to split our bill and instead of charging my card for $16, the waitress charged my card for $6! Huh??? Anyhow, I let that slide....the worst of all of this is when I randomly checked my bank account the next day and found that they charged my card for the $6 I got a receipt for but apparently they also charged my card $60, our bill in total was only $29!! I called the restaurant to find out what was going on and the manager said the waitress charged my card for the wrong amount and immediately voided it. Either way my bank account was shorted $60 for three days! And the manager was so rude about the whole situation, and I was most upset about the fact that no one had has the decency to tell me that my card was overcharged! I worked in the food/customer service industry as well, I understand accidents happen--but at least have the nerve to tell me what occurred so that I understand and not freak out that I have a very large charge on my account that I did not make. The manager didn't even offer me a gift card or free dessert or anything to appease me and smooth things over. Very bad customer service and mediocre food. Don't go there!"
April G.,"Playa Del Rey, CA",10,31,1,2.0,12/3/2009,I have dined in her twice and the service is TERRIBLE.  The first time I ordered a chicken lettuce wrap and it took an hour for my food to get to me and when it came to me my lettuce was warm...disgusting!  My friend ordered a salad and frankly it doesn't take an hour to make salads no matter how busy.  The manager apologized an offered a pizookie and gosh that giant cookie with icecream is heavenly.  Next time I would just come in for dessert.  My boyfriend and I just order take out if we crave for their pizza or dessert.  I try to avoid dining in there.  The servers are rude.
Lisa C.,"Lawndale, CA",2,14,,5.0,5/14/2013,I only tried BJ's for the first time a few months ago and it is now my favorite restaurant!  Their appetizers are delicious and their pizza's are great.  My husband and I went there before seeing a movie at AMC and order only appetizers and had drinks.  It may have looked a little ridiculous with all those plates on the table but their appetizers are so good they can stand alone as a meal.  Definitely recommend the buffalo chicken wontons.  They have a good variety of beers and the Pina Coladas are great.  I would definitely recommend anyone to try BJ's in Del Amo mall.
Kristen C.,"Waipahu, HI",77,630,197,3.0,7/31/2009,"After a day of seeing LA and shopping, we decided to try BJ's because I really wanted to try some deep dish pizza.  During dinner hours the place was pretty full but we only had to wait 10 mins for a table so it wasnt too bad.  First off our waiter was very slow and didnt really pay any attention to us, even as she walked by she didnt even check on us so we had to stop other waiters for some help.   As for our food, we ordered the half white pizza and have bj's special or something like that.  The white pizza has a white alfredo like sauce with chicken and the bj's special is like a supreme at pizza hut.  We also ordered bruschetta and the avocado egg rolls for apps.  The bruschetta was good, the bread was nicely toasted and topped with the tomatoes...mmm.  Everyone else seemed to really like the egg rolls as it was just ok for me.  When the pizza came our waitress actually served us but she had a really hard time cutting it.  I tried the bj's special and it was ok, nothing special and It didnt even seem like a deep dish pizza that i've seen on tv because i didnt even have to use my knife and fork because the crust wasnt even that thick.  As for dessert a few of us shared the oreo pizookie with vanilla ice cream and it was so delicious and a perfect way to end an ok meal with crappy service."
Anna L.,"Torrance, CA",14,221,49,4.0,7/1/2010,"i really like bjs...everything ive eaten here has been pretty good. i also tried some of their beers and those are good as well. i came here last night for dinner, and again i had a nice meal. service is always good, and the environment is very upbeat/fun with different games playing on multiple screens throughout the place... what i order here each and every time are the avocado eggrolls..they are yummy, warm, crisp, and delicious! i also always order the bbq chicken chopped salad...YUM! i love the lil jicama bites in the salad and the slight bbq saucy flavor. we also ordered the meditteranean pizza..my first time trying it and it was yummmy! some other things i really like here are the baked potatoes..huge potatoes overflowingly stuffed with your choice..and i always ask for the alfredo sauce on the side.  their flatbread pizzas are good, pastas (shrimp with angel hair?), i also had a chicken dish with mashed potatoes and stuff..which was also really good as well. and their blondie beer is good too. ok i pretty much said everything on the menu is good. haha anyways i love coming here with a big group of friends or a small group of friends, or whatever. i like it here. :)"
Kenneth D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",222,66,,4.0,9/27/2010,"What do you do after a mighty workout...Ruin it with food of course. My man Jon and I randomly worked out until the AM and wanted some grub so off we drive to go get sushi at RA (we figured we might convince them to give us some) but alas the sushi was put away. So we go to BJs and it is crowded. It being a friday night and all, we tried to find a seat at the bar but could not so we tried moving chairs until finally the gods opened up two seats. In comes our bartendress Coraline who basically had the cordial manner and laughed at our inane jokes and made us feel welcome. Kinda bartendress a boy could fall in love with by the end of the night. Well...I get mini crushes all the time and I'm usually buzzed or drunk by the end of the night. I digress...The service was excellent. We got the 20 dollar special, I mean I had a tomato basil soup which was not too spicy and a good consistency. Next came the pizza I had the artichoke one and my friend had the other half as a BJs special, the artichoke one was good but very creamy and heavy with a lot of cheese. The artichokes and veggies are flavorful and I loved the crust. Not the best gourmet pizza I've had and next time I would avoid the cream cheese and stick with the italian or veggie pizza. I had the snakebite, that is guiness with some pear cider and it was delicious. Layered goodness that blended perfectly and was sweet yet full bodied, next I had black velvet which was I think their porter with berry cider again sweet yet velvety taste that goes down smooth. I was buzzing it ok when the pizookie came. Pan baked gooey oatmeal raisin cookie and smooth vanilla ice cream melting together and as you taste them...an orgasm in your mouth. Hahaha ok not that epic but that night maybe the combination of workout, the bartendress, and the full moon made that pizookie a love affair of sweet creamy lust. So if you come here and only have a few bucks on you have a mixed beer and a pizookie. You won't regret it."
Angie W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",78,186,,4.0,7/9/2010,"This place is pretty consistent with the other BJ's restaurants.  The size is a little smaller than most.  I think the ones in Cerritos and Brea are twice as big.  This place was super packed on a Thursday evening.  We got there around 6:30 and had to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The pizzas are their specialties.  We love the BBQ chicken pizza.  We had 5 people and split two large sized pizzas along with the appetizer platter.  My husband likes the beer samplers which you can choose 4 or 7 glass samplers.  I think they brew their beer onsite.  They also have their own root beer which is quite tasty.  I heard this place gets uber packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a long time for a table."
MICHAEL A.,"Torrance, CA",30,160,72,1.0,8/14/2008,"We went on opening day - OMG what a disaster! The waitress forgot to put in our order for our appetizers, Dinner took over an hour to get, drinks were slow... we would order.. it would take 20 plus minutes to get a beer...  Orders were mixed up... You name it. We finally got silverware, after a third request from the waitress There was a manager floating around, and on several occasions asked how things were - we would tell him we have been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks, etc etc... but nothing would ever happen... we would just wait... and wait.. and wait...  Tho we were constantly assured our order was coming over and over again... ...  Some of their micro brews were a bit off too... I don't think they quite perfected it yet....  Hopefully the next batch will be better..  The beer at the other locations are quite good Oh the up side.. The restroom was immaculate, clean, and well stocked.  The servers, and hostesses were very polite.. tho rushed and confused.  and the dessert (when we finally got it) was GREAT.  I will stick the the BJ's in O.C. - I have lots of good experiences there"
El L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,59,4,5.0,11/27/2012,"LOVE this place. Fun bar with widescreen TVs, diverse menu, EXCELLENT customer service. I have never had a bad meal there. Also parking is great since it's part of the Del Amo mall, plenty of free mall parking in front. We love to walk around the mall after dinner to work off our food. :) 5 STARS!!"
Earl U.,"Torrance, CA",33,97,,3.0,9/30/2012,"Food is good. Service needs to be better.  Pan pizza is similar to eating at Numero Uno's.  Nice beer selection.  Try the sampler...If you go for lunch specials, prices will be reasonable...no sound on any of the tv monitors...nice to have audio...what i really don't understand is how you can order a pizza and have it comes out to the table only warm (the pan is just warm too). When will their pizza ever come to your table hot just out of oven...gives me the impression that bjs pizzas are not made before ordering ....even home delivered pizza is hotter...."
