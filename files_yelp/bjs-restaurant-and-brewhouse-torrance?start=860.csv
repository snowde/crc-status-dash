Calvin L.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",3,9,28,2.0,1/1/2013,"SUPER SLOW service. It took forever to get our food even though we both my friend and I ordered appetizers. It took forever for beer too. People that sat down after we ordered got food before us. 30 min to get food and 15 min to get the check. Granted. this was New Years but I went at 3 or so and there were a bunch of tables empty so the ""It must be busy"" excuse can't be justified. I ordered the Angus Sliders and they felt like they came out of a box. The meat was well past well-done and the surface entirely charred. Not charred as in grill marks charred but both sides of the patty. The bun looked roughly handled as it was wrinkled. This may not seem like a big deal but the presentation is an important part of the meal. I'm not sure why but every single time I've been to a BJ's, the server always changes halfway through my meal. What, do they have one hour long shifts or something? And if customers are in the middle of a conversation, don't interrupt, even if you want to get off your shift. (The customer is always right!) This is fast food dining at a sit-down price. Not worth it. I won't be coming back."
Christian S.,"Torrance, CA",1,96,1,4.0,12/11/2011,smallest BJ's restaurant Ive seen but the food is always great
Charlie B.,"Torrance, CA",446,10,,4.0,12/28/2010,"Went to Bj's on a Sunday nite.. Really busy but the host and  then our server (Kat or Katherine) were really excellent.. Kat or Katherine lol was extremely stellar with making me excited and engaged wit dining wit Bj's.. Will certainly be going back, only if i have Kat or Katherine will be my server.. :)"
Marcelo C.,"Torrance, CA",207,38,5,5.0,2/11/2011,"We just love BJ's. The manager and most all of the wait staff is fun, friendly, and spot on. Don't forget to leave room for a pizooki!!"
Alicia G.,"Torrance, CA",105,23,,5.0,3/14/2013,"LOVE this place! Great soup, amazing homemade root beer and my favorite chicken dish if all time!! Make sure to try the (Parmesan??) crusted chicken. Huge portions and good value"
Stephie D.,"Long Beach, CA",95,252,241,4.0,4/29/2010,"While expensive ish, you can't really go wrong with their pizza and some pizooki. I'll admit that I've started to grown tired of it but the deep dish cheesy goodness I cannot duplicate so I will keep coming back for more."
Nicole Y.,"Alhambra, CA",116,254,1629,3.0,4/23/2010,"The Thai shrimp lettuce wrap taste very good, as well as the Pizookie! Also tried the handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana, the sauce is a little bit on the sweet side, but the chicken taste good.  Good food considering it is a chain restaurant."
Ed L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",377,432,403,4.0,9/24/2009,"The fish taco's are Shockingly Good.  I told my wife she was crazy for ordering fish taco's at a pizza place, but she was right on this one and I was wrong.  You get two soft taco's stuffed with battered fish, topped with cole slaw.  The batter on the fish is crispy, with light flaky fish inside, and the slaw is really light on mayo but has cilantro mixed in.  It comes with a side of tortilla chips, salsa and creamy guacamole.  She got the lunch special so it was only about $6.  I love Rubios taco's and these are Way better than Rubios! The buffalo wings appetizer is also amazing.  They give you a lot of wings, which are borderline too meaty.  They are crispy on the outside and have spicy sauce and ranch drizzled on them.  The buffalo hot sauce and ranch come on the side so you can dip them as much as you want. The pizza is good.  Not  a true deep dish, like an authentic Chicago Deep dish which is stuffed full of meat and vegetables.  It's more like a  thick pan pizza, but still pretty good. I've been there four times and the service is not great, but not bad enough to ruin your meal.  We will definitely be going again."
Tammie C.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",45,113,5,4.0,4/27/2011,"I liked this place.  1st time I'd visited so I checked the reviews & took a look at the menu before going.  I was going with my family which makes it a party of 7 so service is always an issue for us.  Seems like whenever we go out as a group, there is at least one service disaster in which something goes wrong with 1 person's order & everyone else gets served while they have to wait an extra 15 minutes for their meal.  So it seemed from the reviews that service was spotty so I was a little leery... but am happy to report that there were NO issues!  They get my award.  Our server, Christine, was attentive & available - that is, she was there for us when we needed her, not 20 minutes later.  And even though it was Laker night (game 5 or 6 of the series), all of our orders came out correctly & timely.  And on top of that everyone was happy with their order.  I had the Field of Greens salad - expecting it to be on the small side as I'm used to with this type of salad - but it was really big with lots of toppings.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Mom got the Clam Chowder which she couldn't stop raving about.  A cheese pizza was ordered which looked KILLER!  Boyfriend ordered the open-face Pot Roast sandwich & was stoked.  Topped it all off with a Pazookie for everyone to share.  All & all it was a great experience.  I really want to go back soon because there were so many vegetarian things that I could choose from on this menu (note, I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian) - small plates, veggie burger, stuffed potatoes, pasta, appetizers...  It all looked super killer but it was late & I tend to eat lighter in the evening so I bypassed the heavier choices for the salad & wasn't disappointed.  But NEXT TIME!!!!  And looking forward to it!!"
Lisa C.,"Torrance, CA",12,24,,3.0,12/14/2012,"Need more seating in host area, noisy and crowded. Sure hope the food is good!"
Renee I.,"Torrance, CA",33,288,311,4.0,1/18/2010,"I really love the parmesan crusted chicken. I haven't had anything from the menu that was awful.  Pizzas are a deep dish yummie, hamburgers are yummie.  salads are good, but I only had a bit of my friends whenever they get salads and they were good too.  If you go to Bj's you HAVE to get a pazookie, there is always room for desert!  However, watch out for the floor people especially people wearing shoes without any grip because the floor is slippery.  My friends including myself have almost slipped on the majority of occasions that we have been to Bj's."
elizabeth a.,"Compton, CA",61,5,,4.0,10/26/2010,Ive been here two times for lunch and the food is great especially the tomato soup is one of the best i ever had and the prices are pretty desent for lunch....i would give 5 stars but i didint beacause the servers were not very clean their aprons were quite dirty and seemed like they havent washed them for days but ill still go for that soup:)
Tobi L.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,87,228,3.0,1/17/2010,"I think the best thing about this restaurant is the ambiance. Beautiful new brewery in Del Amo mall. Always busy during the weekend. The pizzas, beers, and pazookie(delicious cookie with ice cream on top) are great here. However, all the other dishes are very mediocre, including  bad wine selection. I am actually a wine person, the wine selection there sucks. Now, you are wondering why would i go to a brewery for wine. I love the ambiance and pazookie there. The customer service there is generally only ok."
Meryl G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",16,34,,2.0,6/15/2010,We went to the BJ's in Torrance for our end of the year party and they were not prepared for a large party at all.  I was really disappointed with the service although their food was delicious once it showed up.  I have had much better experiences at all the other BJ's restaurants I've tried but not this one.
akai k.,"Torrance, CA",6,57,,1.0,10/27/2013,"This is one of the worst restaurants ever. We walk in through the lobby entrance for a midday meal. There were 3 employees standing there and saw that we entered. We were the only ones there waiting to be seated. But no employee acknowledged us nor told us where to stand to wait to be seated.  We wait patiently to be acknowledged and seated but then another party walks in through the other side of the lobby entrance. They get acknowledged and then escorted ahead of us to their table. So we walk over to that side. After standing there for a while, other people came in after us and were greeted promptly.  Since we were still waiting, we just walked out. Our recommendation is BJ needs to retrain its employees to treat each customer with respect, not play games and ignore them. So speak with your wallet and take your hard earned dollars elsewhere. PS we tip big for good service so they missed out big time. And they better not complain about getting low wages because they sure did not earn any money period."
Denise L.,"Bellflower, CA",64,61,8,2.0,1/10/2012,"I've been to many bj's and I love their beer selections ,atmosphere n food. However everytime I come to this specific location something goes wrong. couple months ago I went with my bf and I waited good 15min to wait for a table which is understandable and another astonishing 30min for someone to acknowleg that my bf n I were sitting waiting to be asked if we needed water atleast!!! Well I wassent too happy so I.went up to the.front desk n told the ladies I hadn't been helped ..totally brushed me off ..by that time I wanted to.never see another bjs again I was about to leave when I went on my phone looked up the number to the bjs and asked yo speak to the manager..long story short the manger confirmed I was indeed waiting for 31mins ..was very nice and apologetic ..decided to stay... I.said I would never go to that location again ..but I did and ordered the great white pizza which is delicious and to my ""surprise"" the brought us the wrong pizza!! lol I told our waitress the order was wrong...she just took the pizza and left ..no apologies ..havent been to this location n probably will never. P.s always.ask a.customer if they want their beer poured..my.waitress took my beer without asking and poured it as if she was pouring water. Its beer...not water!!!"
Shaunt N.,"Torrance, CA",199,39,4,5.0,12/8/2009,Love this place.. I work right next to it and I always order take-out... Everyone needs to try their chicken potato and Pazookies.
Nancy R.,"San Francisco, CA",278,237,9,1.0,1/20/2009,Came in with my boyfriend and a few of his cousins and their girlfriends. HORRENDOUS SERVICE. Nobody asked us if we wanted a booth or a table or anything! We couldn't get attention from the waitresses to order anything so we walked out. How rude.
Todd X.,"Hawthorne, CA",1,8,1,4.0,3/10/2010,"Stopped by with a fiend on a random Wednesday evening and this place was packed.  Barely got a seat at the bar.  From there on it was great.  The service was bar none.  Once seated the bar tender was on us for some drinks.  He then told us that if we still wanted happy hour we had 5 minutes.  Placed our drink and food order and within 10-15 minutes the food was in front of us.  Great service and great food, can't ask for a better combo."
Joey P.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",67,36,10,2.0,2/17/2011,"Ok, so Im not too big on chain restaurants, but this being at the Del Amo Promenade, it was the most appealing place to eat after a hard day of shopping for myself. My friend and I went in and after we were sat it took about 10 minutes to just be seen by the waitress, when she finally showed up at our table she clearly seemed like she'd rather be doing something else, instead of greeting us or even saying welcome or hello, all we got is ""what do you want to drink."" she them seemed very annoyed when all i wanted to drink was a water. after she took our order we didnt see her for a while. Our food came out actually in a quick manner and was pretty tasty. about half way through our meal, and i mean half way, i wasnt even done eating she finally showed back up and instead of asking us how it was or whatever, she asked are you done and went to grab for my plate, i said no, then she asked if we wanted dessert, again i was only half way through, why am i being rushed to order dessert already? after i said no she came back no more than 5 minutes later and asked again if we wanted dessert, still i wasnt done eating. during this whole process when she visited our table twice she not once refilled my drink which i had asked her to please do. After the second time of her asking us if we wanted dessert she came back and put the bill on the table and didnt say anything, not a thank you or have a great day, nothing. Being rushed by her, clearly she didnt want to be there and we were keeping her from leaving, its not like it was late and they were closing, it was like 6pm. as we were leaving I saw another server, clearly off his shift walking around the restaurant with his shirt sloppily hanging out, his earphones in and wearing his apron around his neck like a cape. very unprofessional and not a great experience at this place, then again, its just BJ's, i should lower my expectations when visiting a place like that again.... that is if i go back."
