Damaris K.,"Torrance, CA",31,4,,4.0,8/8/2010,"Me and my husband used to come here a lot, at least 3 times a week. One of the reasons is because their kitchen closes around 12am, which is great for us because we work late and we got no time to cook at home. Plus their food is good. I love their minestrone soup. (too bad they dont have a bigger size.) After having a bad treatment from the same waitress 3 times in a row we stopped coming here. We stayed a really LONG time without passing by the door.  We decided to give it a second chance.  I missed the food so much that only this week we've been there for 5 times to have dinner and 1 time to have lunch... only in one week. The waiter even know us now. Im totally addictive to their Brownie... is the best thing EVER. Tonight we went there AGAIN around 11pm .... the hostess is the same almost every night we went. She saw when i was coming in, she looked at me and turned her back and started cleaning the balcony while i was standing there for almost 5 min. and her coworkers would just get there and talk to her, when finally someone asked how many? How can that be possible? Never had the old waitress again which is good, now the hostess??? Specially the hostess because she is the one that welcome the costumer...  maybe she was just having a bad day... who knows?! Their food is great Love the big menu they have, a lot of variety, but they serious need to work on their staff... Besides that... it is a really nice place to go... Just dont forget to try their brownie, no whipped cream though... .DELICIOUS UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE... a chocolate overdose! Yummy. :)"
Coral L.,"Torrance, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/27/2009,"I love BJs Brewhouse, the restaurant chain. The Del Amo location, not so much. My boyfriend and I used to drive to Cerritos regularly just to get our deep dish pizza fix at the BJs by Cerritos mall, so we were absolutely thrilled when we found out that a BJs was coming to Torrance. However, ever since it opened, we have never had a single great experience there. Why? The service SUCKS.  Eating dinner there usually turns into a 3 to 4 hour, extremely painful ordeal. Not only is the wait long (which is to be expected at any BJs), but unlike other locations, once you get to your table, the waiting isn't over. Oh no, not even close. Getting someone to even take your drink order is like pulling teeth. Once it took us at least 30-40 minutes just to get our check! When we asked to speak to a manager during one visit, it took half an hour for one to even show up at our table! I guess he must have been busy apologizing to every other table in the joint. The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because of the food. BJs has some of the best pizza I've ever tasted... the BJs Favorite or Spinach and Artichoke pizzas are deeelicious. The Avocado Egg Rolls and Chocolate Chip Pizookie desserts are always a must have. I used to go to the BJs in Cerritos very frequently, but now after so many bad experiences at the Del Amo location, I rarely if ever find myself wanting to go anymore. The Del Amo location is way too small and understaffed to meet the demand. They should have known better than to fit it in such a small space when the enormous Cerritos location always has at least an hour wait each night. What a major letdown."
John P.,"Redondo Beach, CA",20,125,,3.0,4/10/2010,"Food is rather decent, but nothing special. The biggest problem here is the long wait on weekends... be prepared."
Marcos S.,"Torrance, CA",67,108,1,4.0,1/2/2009,"Well I wasn't sure how this place was gonna be cause it is a chain.  I thought the drinks were gonna cost an arm and a leg, but it was the opposite.  Three drinks and a mini pizza later the bill came to a respectable 12 bucks and change.  Most of the beer is regularly priced between 3.50 and 3.75 but there are some more expensive selections there. The seating at the bar does fill up fast, but there are always people getting up so you shouldn't have to wait long.  The big t.v. is also a plus when sitting at the bar you can watch like 5 sporting events on it.  The micro brews are great and I recommend the Tataonka( its like a beer milkshake).  B.J'S doesn't kill your wallet and lets you have a good time whether your waiting for a movie or just getting out from one as well."
Jess B.,"Long Beach, CA",338,477,14,4.0,8/25/2008,"i've been to visit this bj's two times now and both times i've had great service (altho sometimes slower..it's to be expected with the crowds this place draws in).  the food is great and the people are pretty much friendly.  this past time a friend of mine said the pizza was lacking in the sauce area and he thought he could get an overall better tasting slice at pizza hut.  idk.  i didn't taste it.  he also said the bartender gave him attitude.  she didn't look to ""friendly"" but she didn't look pissed off either.   the security guards are super friendly guys... the only complaint i have is that each time i've been i've noticed big parties of really rowdy, loud, rude individuals who almost always run out on their checks.  what the hell?  management should handle that."
Tiana H.,"Austin, TX",1021,568,255,5.0,11/18/2008,In the new Del Amo outdoor restaurant area. Quick seating on a Saturday afternoon before a movie was delish! Love their chicken strips! Yummmm.
William E.,"Anaheim, CA",79,3,,1.0,12/27/2010,"Where do I begin.... not really a big BJ's fan, but that is what the family of 12 wanted to do the day after Christmas... 1. Waited 1.5 hours to be seated, I expected it being a Sunday, big group, and a holiday.  2. Had to re-order my kids drinks 3 times, because they were always on there way after 15 min and everyone got there drink...(apple juice and chocolate milk....BTW). 3. They take my wife's menu without taking her order, waiter takes order, comes by 2 minutes later and ask her did she order something! 4. Waited 40 min to get 2 appetizer platters, and  another 30 minutes to get our food (by this time my kids our starving). 5. Food comes piece mail, 2 or 3 items at a time - med pizzas, when we order large (was told they ran out of pans - no problem - only to see the table next to us get a large pizza 1 min later - who sat down 20 min after us). 6. 10 minutes later my daughters food comes out COLD, and they forget my sons kid pizza ....  7. 10 minutes later pizza comes out by manager,and we ask for my wife's burger - tells me it wasn't on the order???? to top it off my son, says I'm not hungry anymore it took to long . 8. Burger comes out 5 min later 9. Needed to flag down other waiters to get refills after talk with manager? 10. We try to order desert, waiter brings menu, said take your time I'm here until 11:30 - its 9pm (this guys is complaining about turn over after all this)?    11. As we try to leave we have to ask for ""to-go"" boxes 4 times! 12. 4 items comp'd (thank you), but see a 17% service charge for group size? Look I worked in the food industry through out my young life... runner, waiter, bust-boy, & bartender.... So I have a soft spot for bad service, but to ask for a 17% tip on a $200 bill after all this BS is just tacky! If you like long waits, bad, & slow service Torrance BJ's is the place!"
Jim B.,"Los Angeles, CA",62,219,,3.0,1/12/2009,"Agree with the yelpers below.  Skimpy toppings, poor service, wait for table is too long (regardless of day or time of day).  Love the six screen TV in the bar area."
Clint U.,"Washington, DC",67,278,142,2.0,7/21/2008,"The name says it all:  Brewhouse first.  Restaurant second. The menu says:  BJ's FAMOUS DEEP DISH PIZZAS.   Famous for what?   I guess it's not misadvertisement.  We ordered 3 large pizzas and one small.   Two BJ's favorite, one Vegetarian, and a small cheese.   Thats $85 of pizzas.    It's obvious that BJ's caters to people that never had real deep dish pizzas.   So what's wrong here? 1.  A $5 Dominoes pizza has the same amount of toppings as a large BJ's pizza.   The toppings were extremely skimpy and thin.   You can see many areas of bare crust through the toppings....what a ripoff for their ""works""  and vegetarian pizzas. 2.  There is nothing deep dish about this pizza.   The pizza is thick because it is all bread.   I've been to deep dish pizzas where the ingredients weighs down the pizza with hefty amounts of ingredients.   There wasn't much of a crunch or crispiness to the crust.   Yes it was take out, but the crust on the bottom wasn't browned and came out more like bread.  If i wanted a loaf of  bread I would have gone to a bakery.  3.  Taste of the sauce was  bland.   Not spicy, just plain.   There were also chucks of tomatoes but they were also not seasoned.    4.  The wait on a Sunday night was 1.5 hours at 7 pm.  Way too long for mediocre pizza.   We couldn't wait with 6 hungry kids so we ordered take out. OVERALL:   If you want to get drunk with beer and don't really care about the quality of food, this could be a place to go to.   The atmosphere is like the many breweries/restaurants that have been around for the last 20 years.   What makes this place different is that they have 20 foot ceilings. However if you want a really good pizza, this isn't the place.  You would be better off ordering from Pizza Hut or Papa John's and using the money you save to buy yourself something nice at the mall."
Rob S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,96,,3.0,10/25/2011,Limited beer selection. Mostly fried foods on the appetizers menu. Its clean and service is friendly. Enough TVs too see most of the games you'd want to catch. Nothing spectacular but not bad either.
Tina S.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/16/2014,"My sister and I were visiting from Orlando, Florida and love all the BJ restaurants in the state but were very disappointed after visiting this one near the Del Amo Fashion Mall. Upon walking in, the gentleman at the hosting station greeted us by saying, ""hi, party of 2? Please step aside as they are clearing your table."" He seemed friendly enough, however three more groups of people proceeded to walk in behind us. He greeted all with the same generic greeting ""hi, party of 3? Step aside....party of 2, step aside..... Etc"" Never once got a name, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought he must have a good memory. Well, as the other hostess came up with an open table he proceeded to seat 2 other groups both party of 2s, that came in after us. Then looked at us and said, ""Oh , they are still cleaning your table"". Needless to say, it's a small thing to do, just greet and take a name so you don't lose track of who came in what order, but he failed to do this. Customers are loyal by the little gestures and respect, not the by the apologies afterward. Which never came. Luckily, we have experienced great service by this restaurant chain consistently, just not at this one unfortunately."
Karen M.,"Lomita, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/16/2014,"Went here last night for my nephew's birthday.  Everything started out okay, drinks came quickly, waitress was friendly, and appetizers were good.  Then came the food. I didn't like my Black and Bleu burger, the chipotle sauce was strong and hot, way overpowering the flavor of anything else on the burger.  Well, that's okay, I guess I just ordered the wrong thing and I'll know better next time.  But my husband's pork chop and vegetable were COLD. He's not the type to send food back, but he did this time.  Of course by the time he got his meal back, we where all done eating.  And his pork chop was way over cooked (hey BJs, cold and undercooked are not the same thing).  I waitress was nice, but the service was about average.  Thank goodness we didn't have another waitress we enjoyed watching - she spent a large amount of her time flirting with a couple guys at a nearby table. Other people at our table were satisfied with their food, but we won't be back. Lazy Dog is much better."
sonny s.,"Torrance, CA",1,37,2,5.0,8/28/2011,my wife and i went to bj's last night before hitting the amc movie theatre.. i walked in and it was packed!! there was a lot of people but it only took 25 minutes before we got seated but while we were waiting to be seated we went to the bar which was also very ful!!! but! the cocktails and beer was sooooooo soooooo delicious :) and the bartender assisted us in a very quickly manner considering there were like over 100 people at the bar. and then we were paged to get seated and we ordered more drinks and ordered stuffed mushrooms which were awesome! and the pork chops were perfect! i cant wait to go back... 2 people $50 for a nice time with cocktails.
Janine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,50,2,5.0,6/25/2009,"I love this place!  I first went to one in Westwood when I went to college.  My friend said save room for dessert, and I said I didn't want any.  ""trust me"" he says.....the pizookie!!!  For something so simple as a cookie with ice cream on it, i don't know how they do it.  If you've ever had a pizookie, you know what I'm talking about.  Their food is also really good.  the chicken avacado eggroll appetizers YUM!.  They are also pretty good on the prices.  We went the other week for our friends bday and I bought 2 appetizers, 3 vodka diets, and 2 cokes, and it was about $40 with tip.  Their beers are also really good I hear.  Def.  try this place out!"
Tom H.,"Torrance, CA",51,399,8,4.0,7/18/2008,"I've always seen a couple of BJ's in the greater LA area but never happened to patronize one.  This new one in Torrance that just opened at Del Amo Mall finally made me take the leap and I wasn't disappointed.  I came on a Saturday night and the wait was an hour and a half, but since its at a mall I caught up on a little shopping while I waited with my family.  I know when a new establishment opens the service can be lacking due to the crowds and the new employees but  I didn't experience any of that.  I would recommend asking for Kristina as your waitress, she was the best, polite, gave fast service and excellent recommendations.  I ended up getting the sampler of draft beers for like $8 bucks and was treated with about 7-8 different drafts in 4oz size shot glasses.  They all had they're own uniqueness and I'm still not sure which one I preferred.  We ended up ordering the thin crust pizza appetizers and I had the Jumbayala.  The Jumbayala was the best and I thought Claim Jumper's would never be beat.  An excellent blend of chicken, sausage, shrimp and spices.  We ended up coming back a week later and ordered the deep dish pizza and that was the best.  Nothing comparable so far in the South bay, not even close.  Although, the second time around our service was not as good as the first.  That's why I would recommend Kristina if she's on that night.  Overall, I was very pleased and will definitely be back for more.  BTW, they accept call ahead seating if you plan on visiting during peak times."
Danny K.,"Gardena, CA",278,38,8,3.0,3/11/2011,"usually one of my favorite places to go but not THAT great.. i would of given 4 stars but i went here last night with a friend and everything was..unsatisfactory...except the root beer. first, the hostess told us the wait was going to be 10-15 mins..ok, no problem. we waited 30 mins and as we were just about to decide to leave..we get our table. we ordered 'The Best Beginnings' appetizer (kinda like the sampler of appetizers). everything was undercooked except for the chips..which i doubt they make anyways (though in a previous visit..the chips did seem OVERcooked to the point where we had to send it back..). i really like the avocado egg rolls..but yes, they were undercooked..the outside of it wasn't even browned. i LOVE cheese sticks..but yes..undercooked..cheese wasn't even melted inside. after that, it took about 20-30 mins for us to get our pizza..and i mean 20-30 mins after we finished eating the appetizer. and when the pizza came out...yup~..undercooked. ..AND..two different waiters brought out the same pizza. the 2nd waiter came out and was like..""oh..looks like it came out already..."" ...and he was our primary waiter~ after we finished eating that..we literally had to flag the waiter down to get our check. i honestly felt bad that i had to pay for this food and service.. but like i said..USUALLY one of my favorite places. this just happens to be probably the worst visit i've had here. positive notes; the food IS delicious when cooked properly and they have a pretty good menu with different choices. anything from pizza to hamburgers to pasta to parmesan crusted chicken(excellent choice to get btw). they also carry their own line of beers which are awesomeee (including root beer, if u're into that like i am). desserts r awesome too~ good enough for when u just feel like eating dessert and something sweet than having a full meal. oh, also a great place to go to watch a game..they have a sh*t load of tv's..lol"
Hello K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,160,3,1.0,3/29/2011,"I have been to this BJ's 3 times and I kept thinking maybe I just had a bad experience the first time - wrong! The service is what stinks here. The servers try to hurry you out as fast as they can, and with a scowl on their face. The second time I came here was the worst because the waitress literally had a look on her face like she hated us and we were annoying. She had an attitude right from the start. Maybe it was because we were a table full of women and she was upset she could not flirt with us for a bigger tip - who knows. The ham sandwich and ceasar salad I had during this trip however was very delicious. The last time I went my date wanted to buy us a brownie to share for a sweet treat. The waitress seemed irritated when we said we would like one brownie to share. This was after she asked us if we wanted appetizers, mojitos, or beer. Some other woman ended up bringing us our brownie - and surprise! she had an unhappy look on her face. Is anybody happy working there?! Well the brownie sucked and the waitress sucked too. I will never go to this place again."
Donna M.,"Torrance, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/22/2013,"Went today for lunch,  had a great server named Krystan G. Have been here before but today was the best. She was attentive,  interacted with my kids and was just amazing. Definitely coming back because of her. If you want a great dining experience ask for her! I never leave hungry when I come.  It can get a little crowded during lunch so we came when it wasn't too busy. We were her only table for about 5 minutes then the hostess sat all her tables (which I counted and she had  9) and a huge group. Even though she was busy she still took time to talk to us making sure we were doing good.  The large group that she had wasn't too friendly from what I could hear but she kept a smile on her face and was polite (again this is just what I was seeing)  as we were about ready to leave I heard the party say they didn't need to tip because she didn't addthe gratuity, I then sat back down and waited till the party left to ask her if gratuity was added to parties of a certain size she informed me that they no longer put it on. I felt awful and gave her a extra 20, at that point she looked confussed and I let her know what I had over heard.  I think I may have over stepped my bounds. She simply thanked me retured the 20 and went on her way.  I left the money and hope she took it. I also tried talking to a manager but they were a little busy.  All in all I was very happy when I left. She was standing at the host deak thanked us again and told us that she hoped to see us soon. Like I said I will definitely go back and ask for her"
Jason P.,"Sacramento, CA",211,193,1,4.0,4/5/2010,"This is another spot that my friends chose for my bday dinner and had a great time. It was on a Friday night, so it was pretty packed, given that out wait was for 2 HOURS. So we decided to have drinks at the bar which made time pass by rather quick. I was a lil upset that since my friend had his wallet stolen that week, and he had a DMV printout. They still would not let him order a drink. So, it was a lil buzz kill. Otherwise, the customer service was pretty good. The food was also pretty good and of course they bought me two of those bday ice cream cookie things. One was small, then they bought a really big one for the rest of my friends. So that was pretty impressive and unexpected. I was a lil worried about going to this location, but it really turned out to be a joyful and memorable experience, and their staff did a great job keeping us happy. I guess to make up for that super long wait time."
L B.,"Louisville, KY",4,29,,4.0,2/22/2009,"I came here on a Monday night with a few friends.  Surprisingly, it was packed.  I had the balsamic glazed chicken, which was really good.  I also had a pizookie for the first time (peanut butter), which was very good.  I took a star off for service.  Our waiter was nice, but the service was a bit slow and she forgot to submit my dessert order."
