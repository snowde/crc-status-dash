Jimmy D.,"Torrance, CA",89,24,,3.0,2/9/2011,"I would've posted a 5, but unfortunately the last two times I've been here have been ridiculous. This last time, our waitress was just stupid. It took about half an hour for the appetizers to arrive, and she didn't check on us until 10 minutes after someone else gave them to us. The entrees took another 10 minutes to come. We were in the restaurant for an hour and a half... usually we're there for 40-45 minutes. We brought up to her that we had a bad experience the last time we came (because we had cards that the manager gave us), and she says ""Oh, yeah I'm sure I didn't help with that."" And my friend goes ""Yeah it's been a hit or miss"" and she said ""I think I was a miss!"" Who SAYS that? And she wasn't even apologetic about it. This is the first time I didn't give a tip on a bill. It would've been a $15 tip too. This is the 20th time going in the past 6 months, and all 18 of the other times have been perfect. I'm still going to go, but I'll make sure to deny Katherine as my waitress."
M P.,"Watsonville, CA",36,136,62,4.0,12/28/2011,"I went the day after Christmas and the place was packed to the brim. Fortunately we didn't have to wait since my uncles were at the bar. It was a night filled with booze and food and it was ace. I had a tequila sunrise and a strawberry margarita. Both were really good and made great. Everyone else had beer and my cousin had a lemon drop. We shared some appetizers (mini pizzas, pot stickers, and stuffed mushrooms) which were all really good and hit the spot. I ordered the California burger and was blown away. I am a sucker for chipotle and it had a nice spicy chipotle mayo and an extra kick with green chilies. I would definitely order it again. My boyfriend ordered a calzone with jalapenos and anchovies (ew) but they accidentally made one with artichokes and jalapenos. They probably couldn't believe someone was actually ordering anchovies. They gave him the wrong calzone for free and made him the right one with no charge. Definitely get a star for that alone. Most places throw it away which is so wasteful. No pizzokie this time but I'm sure I'll be back!"
Cat C.,"Torrance, CA",0,6,2,3.0,2/23/2009,"For quite some time I had been told by others who lived closer to their other locations to try BJ's.  I finally went for lunch last week and was a bit underwhelmed.  I had their Shrimp Tacos lunch special and my friend had one of their stuffed baked potatoes.  The tacos were good, but nothing to write home about especially here where fish/seafood tacos are abundant.  I plan to come back in the future for dinner and to try some of their beers, but for now, it hasn't impressed me as anything more than an upscale generic american restaurant.  The best way to desrcribe it I think would be if Cheesecake Factory and T.G.I. Fridays had a child, it would be BJ's. The service was a bit slow and when we finally got our food the waiter did not bring utensils or napkins for a good 10-15 minutes while we hungrily drooled over our food but could not eat it. A little disappointing, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since maybe their wait staff is a bit new."
sam k.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/21/2011,"Decided to order some food to go on Friday night, I called in the order around 7:20...the girl who helped me out was pleasant and offered ""curb side pick up""..i thought how nice, i don't have to leave my car! She said the wait would be 20-25 minutes...I pulled up around 7:40...waited..and waited...it was now almost 8pm, so altogether thats 40 minutes of waiting for one small pizza and one sandwich..No one ever came out, so I decided to leave my car and see what's going on..my order was already ready and just sitting there..wow thanks for the curbside pick up you offered!...there were no napkins, or utensils...only ketchup that i didnt even need..Food was the only good thing, i want to come back because their beer looks good, but not so sure now because of bad service..hire some people with experience!"
Anastasia K.,South Bay,0,11,,1.0,11/25/2008,"Ok, had lunch there, and was initially impressed with the decor and setup of the restaurant. Unfortuantely, my experience compared to it's look wasn't good.  Service -  Host was kind, no problem there. Our server, however, was a mess. He lost our order on the way to the kitchen, brought too many soups, forgot our drinks, and put my baby in harms way. Who in the right mind plants a hot coffee right in front of a baby sitting in the high chair? Also, anything hot like the soups, he would hover it over her head.  We had to ask other servers not handling our tables to get our drinks. We repeatedly asked our server for the drinks, but would forget in a span of 3 minutes.  The Food - Honestly, not impressed. I ordered the Honey Crips Chicken Salad. The salad is DRENCHED in some kind of dressing (ranch), and the strips of chicken, well, there were 4 skinny ones, that was worse than Jack in the Box's chicken strips. Not worth the 11 dollars.... Overall, the food here, isn't that great. They must sell a lot of beer to stay open. Hope they get of this server. He can't handle even drinks, the bus boys got them for us in less than 2 minutes."
Noel A.,"Torrance, CA",137,90,13,2.0,6/13/2009,"This place is still terrible. We had a late lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Our last experience was during dinner last September - figured lunch would be better but it wasn't.   There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, so we thought the service would be better.  We knew something was wrong as soon as we sat down because the manager was talking to the couple across from us. They looked pretty upset. The waiter came by to take our order and he did not write down what we ordered. My wife who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time asked for a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich and a glass of water and I wanted a mini Sweet Pig Pizza with ice tea. He mumbled our order back to us and then proceeded to take the order of the table next to us. He came back several times confirming what we ordered and saying the food should be out shortly.  It took about 10-15 minutes before he realized we didn't have our drinks yet. When we brought us our drinks, he reassured us our food would arrive momentarily but it seemed like forever. Anyway, another person brought out my pizza - it was a ""small"" ham and cheese pizza and not a mini Sweet Pig. The waiter came and realized that wasn't what I ordered so he said it would be free. As soon as I started to eat it, my ""mini"" Sweet Pig came. Again the waiter came back and said there was a mix up so I got the first pizza for free and was charged for the one I ordered. Then my wife's order came - it was a Grilled Chicken Club and not a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich. My pregnant wife was so hungry she just ate it. The manager came by shortly thereafter to apologize for the pizza when we broke the news to him that my wife's sandwich was also not what she ordered. The manager gave us that for free as well. When the check came out, it still showed the charge for the sandwich so we complained to the waiter and told him to talk to his manager who didn't tell him we got the free sandwich.  He seemed confused but he approached him only to come back and apologize as he didn't know about her free meal as well. It seems like the staff don't talk to one another. I am sure someone else got my wife's sandwich and/or didn't get their pizza I ate.  Good thing we had a gift card to pay for our meal on top of the free food we received.  Not planning to eat at that location any time soon."
Michael R.,"Fayetteville, AR",0,1,,4.0,10/10/2008,We go during lunch during the week and love the place.  We usually sit at the bar to watch sports.  I like to get the all you can eat soup and salad and have the great specialty beers.  Everytime we go we have great service and everyone is super friendly.  I really can't complain about anything so far. I really enjoy the atmosphere and people.
Jennifer S.,"Lawndale, CA",0,26,,1.0,9/20/2010,"food was nice, but the service sucked.  They were very unprepared for a monday night football night.  The bathrooms were filthy and out of toilet paper.  We had to ask 4 times for crackers for our soup.   The food took over 40 minutes to deliver.  Was enough to never go back!!!"
Cheryl P.,"Torrance, CA",0,29,,4.0,9/8/2010,"Good food, friendly staffs, and fun place to go with friends and family.  Love their chicken wings & beer!"
Valerie B.,"Cerritos, CA",291,163,434,3.0,7/13/2009,"yeh decent for any other family brewery. got there 2min before happy hour ended, and just said forget it. we'll just take a table and forget about the happy hour. mango mojitos are not bad (was expecting more mint) and the thai shrimp wraps were good. not too bad. next time ill come back for the happy hour drinks (thats if theres no traffic coming from the 405s)."
Lisa I.,"Torrance, CA",91,100,23,3.0,8/27/2008,"i realize that this BJ's opened relatively recently and they are probably still working out the kinks, but the service i had here this weekend was pretty awful (although they did somewhat make up for it).   i came here on sunday for a late lunch with a friend, but service was so slow, it ended up being an early dinner as well.  i don't know who was at fault for the long wait (kitchen was slow, wait staff was spread pretty thin, etc.), but i've never had such poor service at any BJ's location before.  the place was sort of busy, but not as crowded as i've seen it (not to mention that i've had far faster/better service when it was more crowded).  after taking over 10 minutes to get water, we placed our food order only to wait another 35+ minutes just to receive the appetizer.  we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip with focaccia bread instead of chips (the ONLY way i will eat this!) which was good, as usual.   because i ordered a mini pizza, i expected a bit of a wait (my friend ordered the california grilled chicken sandwich).  but when the appetizer came so late, we joked that the rest of our food would probably arrive around the same time.  but well after we finished our appetizer, we STILL had not received our meals.  in fact, people at the table next to us noticed we were waiting a long time and remarked how slow service was.  after being seated for almost an hour and a half, our food FINALLY arrived.  the manager personally delivered our food, apologized for the long wait, and comped our entire meal (offering to add a pizookie).  this was an appreciated gesture, especially since we hadn't made any direct complaint.  so our waitress or the manager (or both) themselves noticed the poor service we received.  however, my pizza was cold -- not what i expected after waiting so long.  i was so hungry at that point, i didn't even consider sending it back.  when we finished eating, our waitress asked if we wanted to order a pizookie, but by then we'd been there nearly 2 hours.  not wanting to test out how long it would take for a pizookie to arrive (as much as we LOVE pizookies!), we decided against it. i don't blame our waitress for our poor service, but i would have liked it if she were more proactive in checking on our order after we were waiting without food for so long.  the manager did slightly make up for the wait by comping our meal, but with my food arriving cold, i still wanted to give 2 stars.  i only gave them 3 stars because the other two times i've been here, the service was decent."
Nancy I.,"Irvine, CA",5,140,7,4.0,1/26/2009,"I went to the one is Cerritos before and wasn't too impress with the food or service, but tried out the Happy Hour here and the drinks and appetizers were pretty good! I never sat down for the food service so I can't speak for that but the service at the bar was pretty good even on busy nights so I love going here for Happy Hour!"
Kei C.,"Carson, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/15/2011,"BJs in Torrance Ca. service sucked sooo bad tonight, that I came home, pulled out my laptop to make sure I wrote this review before I went to sleep tonight. We had a party of 8, the greeter said the wait would be 30 minutes, instead it was 2HOURS. When inquiring about the wait the ""greeter"" said ""oh, we are waiting for these people to finish eating."" Was she serious? They kept bringing the food and desserts...WITH NO PLATES. So again we had to wait.. Our waiter was really nice, only because I think he felt bad for our experience. The people that bring your food had the worst attitudes. Maybe it was a full moon tonight......By the way Ladies, be careful if you wear heels the floors are soooo slippery. My cousin fell by the bar coming out of the restroom and she said all the employees just looked at her and didn't even bother to see if she was ok, or even help her for that matter. My whole family was disgusted by this experience. It SUCKED!!!!!! Food is good, cant complain about that!"
lia s.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,20,,2.0,1/11/2012,"so after numerous times going here I finaly had to write a review. last night i went in for a late nite, dinner, just me and the hubby as this is is fave place. now we have been here before and they have messed up our order and mischarged us before, but it ususaly got taken care of. but yesterday was too much, we sat down and the waitress was like so are you ready to order? hum no can you give us a min? but the whole time i felt we were rushed to put in our order. it was 2 hours to closing! so i didn't think we were holding her up. after we palced our order, i had to ask 3 diffrent people for a straw, where they all went to diffrent tables waited on them, and like ( not exagerating) 15 minutes later, we had a straw handed to us.  the food was ok, but not as great as it normaly is, when it arrived.  again they mischarged us, normaly the staff are nice, and very busy, but this time, like i said the wiatress rushed us, then forgot about us, then mischagred us. so i'm not sure about going here again.  after the 4th time of messing up our order i think im done with this place. darn now i will have to find a new fave brewery."
A P.,"Cypress, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/12/2008,I've been over to this BJ's a few times since it opened and I've really thought they've done a good job. The atmosphere is great and the food is just as good as Cerritos or HB. I've had really nice servers and I didn't feel that the time I waited for my food was too long. The place did just open and I doubt they had much cross-over of waitstaff from other BJ's because of distance. Every time I've gone a manager has checked on my table (something I rarely see at other locations!) and the one time the dressing was wrong my salad he quickly fixed it and comped it! I am really happy with my experiences there and I will keep going back.
Jean J.,"Carson, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/14/2009,"Now, i am very understandable if small mishaps occur in the restaurant because it happens. I've also been a big fan of BJ's pizookies. However, my experience today was rather unbecoming. One of my utensils had a piece of lettuce stuck on it. And the utensil of someone from our party had residue on hers. We let that slide. We didnt call them out on it because we figured they were busy and accidents can happen. We had ordered a pizookie trio. It was delicious but our night was ruined when we found a bobby pin in one of our pizookies! YES! We alerted the waiter, and of course the manager comes to our table. He apologizes and says he has no idea how the bobby pin got in there. Then he has the nerve to imply that one of us might have purposely put the pin in there because he said that ""they were investigating how the bobby pin got there, but nobody who works there wears bobby pins. so...we dont know how it got there."" Oh really? in the 10 seconds you ""investigated""? and you know exactly what ur employees wear in their hair? Now, i know one thing and that is the customer is always right. Dont try to imply stuff like that when you did something wrong. I was ready to forgive the incident if they hadnt implied that we were trying to scam them. I called them out on it. We didnt pay for the pizookie. Nevertheless, considering all i have seen tonight i have reached the conclusion that if you value your health and want to avoid food poisoning at all costs. Refrain from coming here."
Ru G.,"Mountain View, CA",15,165,8,1.0,9/4/2008,oh yeah...and my speedy almost got drenched by another server! all i needed was a dessert tray to fall on my head to cap off this afternoon!
