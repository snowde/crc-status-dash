Matthew S.,"Baltimore, MD",216,123,97,4.0,11/1/2017,"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday and couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience. The restaurant was clean, the staff (waitress, hostess, food runners) were friendly, and the food was amazing. Myself and four friends all left feeling very satiated and can't wait to return! I got the Enlightened Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and WOW. Diced grilled chicken paired with a cucumber, tomato, red onion, and feta ""salsa"" which is them topped with cilantro and a creamy yogurt sauce. The pita they envelope it in is seriously heavenly. Warm and soft, just like you'd expect it to be and more. Served alongside a huge serving of grain salad and just the right amount of both. Finished the whole entree and it left me feeling full without being overstuffed - perfecto.  Friends all loved their entrees as well. Salads are large and filled with fresh, seasonal ingredients. The Parmesan Crusted chicken was   and the portion was larger than life. Literally enough for 2, even 3, meals. Side of brocolli that it comes with could have used some extra seasoning but the chicken and mashed potatoes more than made up for it's lack thereof. My only regret is not getting our waitresses name so I could drip it here. She was amazing. Claimed to have tried every item on the menu (which is huge so we were a bit skeptical) but proved herself right when she was able to quickly rattle off her personal likes and dislikes about all the items we were contemplating and then ranked them in order from best to worst. She was seriously amazing and will definitely be getting return service the next time we stop in!"
Kendra R.,"Randallstown, MD",140,116,133,3.0,11/12/2017,"I had a great time here. The service was great and the food LOOOKED good. I said looked because I ended up sending my barbacoa tacos back. They had a horrible stench to them. They looked great, but I couldn't stomach the smell. I'm excited to return to try some other food items because every picture on the menu made me want to try it. I didn't order another entrée, I opted for dessert instead. I was thoroughly please with my white macadamia nut pikoozie. Absolutely delicious. Parking in Towson is always a pain especially if you're not wanting to use the garage. I lucked up and found a spot right out front. I look forward to returning here and trying something else."
Jude T.,"Parkville, MD",78,387,372,3.0,9/19/2017,"A solid three. This place is a chain restaurant, but it's a good chain restaurant - it's what Friday's could be and maybe is trying to be. However, it's STILL a chain restaurant, and that's important to remember.  BJ's has a good beer list, including their own, which is the real center of attention, I guess. Their actual menu is quite bloated and far too large, much like a lot of other chains (looking at you, CCF, especially). You have options here, but because there are so many things it means some of the things aren't going to be as great as the others - no restaurant staff can learn all of these items and prepare them perfectly each time. They have flatbread pizzas, burgers, tacos, ribs, sandwiches, wraps, salads, fish...far too many options. As for what we had? Two people ordered burgers, both MW. One was a bit dry with one side closer to well-done and a little black, but the other burger was perfect MW. The flatbread pizza appetizer was actually pretty good - I liked the sauce a lot.  I had the fish and chips, and the fish was cooked well with a nice breading but maybe a little greasier than expected or wanted.  All meals came with fries and the fries were actually good restaurant fries! Waitress was very nice and came back with an extra drink when I asked for a refill, so that's cool. OTOH we didn't even get a person to ask us for drinks until we had been there for about 10 minutes, so service can be slow. In the end, the food can be good, but some things are better than others...and it's a brewhouse that's trying to be a sports bar (tons of TVs and the clientele is definitely sports fans on a Sunday) and because of this, it fails to live up to its true potential."
Nick H.,"Baltimore, MD",30,18,2,2.0,1/6/2018,We have eaten here twice now. The first time was ok. Nothing stellar but nothing amazing. Food was fine and service was average. Unmemorable. So we came back recently to try this place again. The service was very slow. Snail slow. Having food in front of me for 10 minutes without silverware. Come on. Flagged down another server and it took flagging down a third to get to job done. 20 minutes with food in front of me and not able to eat it may have affected my roon temperature impression of my meal. Unfortunately this place was more memorable a second time. They have craft beer but I soent all my time trying to eat I didnt have a chance to actually enjoy this aspect. Will most likely not return. Its a great concept poorly executed.
Johnny P.,"Towson, MD",27,19,59,4.0,12/20/2017,"Love this place after a movie in Towson or when the friends get together, also pretty nice place for a date. So many options on the menu! Favorites  Pulled pork and the root beer glazed ribs. Save room for dessert the monkey bread pizzokie is soo freaking good! Deff gotta try that if you go. Prices aren't crazy high about the same as any other chain restaurant. Service is usually pretty good and the loyalty program and being able to pay your bill from the app is def a plus."
Toy S.,"Owings Mills, MD",78,89,100,4.0,6/21/2017,"BJ's is good for what is, a cool place to eat wings and watch the game.  Whenever I have free time after going to Cinemark theater, I always walk out of the theater and to BJ's. Their selection of personalized beer is tasty (TATONKA is my favorite)  and I love, love, love their homemade pizza. The sauce is always just right.  What annoys me with BJ's, and is the reason I can't give them five stars is because no matter when I come I have to ask someone to wipe off the bar or the table before I sit down. And I mean every time!!! I don't know what goes down at night but there is always so much food gook on it and the morning crew must be like FORGET IT! But the staff members are always nice when asked.  The service in general is a guessing game. If I sit at the bar it's pretty good. It doesn't hurt that the hour I go it's desolate, just the way I like it.  Still, during football and basketball season they get crazy busy, in a good way! Be prepared if you like cheering with other fans."
Tiffany D.,"Baltimore, MD",136,97,196,3.0,11/29/2017,"I came here to have dinner before my movie. My overall experience was great, but the food items were mediocre. The server was very nice and personable and truly made our entire experience. On another note, some of the restaurant practices were blah. They call themselves a brew house but didn't offer tastings of their wine or beers. So I ended up going safe instead of trying something new. Next, I ordered from their  $10 menu, and it was to be expected that it wouldn't be much to write home about. I was satisfied with my meal, but my girlfriend didnt care for hers. At the end, I got dessert and that was really good and on discount. Bottomline- I would go back again for dessert and half priced wine.... and maybe even to try a signature item before I completely write them off."
Cynthia F.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",127,191,479,3.0,6/10/2017,"Came to BJ's last night for dinner before we went to a movie at the theater. We caught the last 15 minutes of happy hour. They brew their own beer, so BF and I decided to try some of their brews. I got the Jeremiah Red which is a red ale, and BF got a mango IPA. I wasn't a big fan of my beer, but i thought his mango IPA was pretty good. We started with the stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty good and I loved the pesto drizzle. BF got a guacamole bacon burger and I got a mini deep dish pizza. The deep dish pizza's were half off during happy hour. BF really liked his burger, and I was a fan of the fries that he got with them. My pizza was SO greasy. The pizza itself tasted good but the crust was just a sponge of grease. I am the type of person who feels like I always have to finish the food in front of me so I finished it anyway. All during the movie I had a stomach ache which I think was caused by how greasy the pizza was. I would still return, but if I ordered a deep dish pizza I would make sure it wasn't as greasy, or just try something different on the menu."
Jamie F.,"Baltimore, MD",9,61,93,3.0,9/17/2017,"Went for Happy hour.. it was okay, didnt have much of a selection. The bartender was a nice lady who made me a really nice drink. The root beer glazed ribs was soooooo good!!! Thats the only thing I would go back for."
Bethany A.,"Tampa, FL",12,23,,1.0,11/9/2017,Would give zero stars if I could. Worst dinner I have had in months. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Waited over 10 mins to be greeted and to order drinks. 2 Appetizers (one that was RAW) took 45 mins. Dinner then came while we were eating the apps. Never checked on us. Food was mediocre at best.  We asked for the check and it took ANOTHER 15 mins while we watched the staff standing around in the kitchen. The staff was actually arguing with eachother in front of us. Hostess looked to be in tears at one point. It was so bad but there was no manager in sight so we just paid the bill and left. So many restaurants nearby - don't make the same mistake as us - eat somewhere else!!
Molly R.,"Annapolis, MD",0,2,7,1.0,12/29/2017,Only one star for the atmosphere. Very cozy and nice. The service and food is terrible. I came with 4 people and all of our food came out at separate times. I ordered a thai peanut dish and the smell alone made it unappetizing. Would choose another restaurant in towson before this any day. Don't recommend wasting money here.
Wayne B.,"Crofton, MD",0,5,2,1.0,11/10/2017,"They refused to seat a walk in party of four until after 9:00 at 5:45 PM. There were about a dozen empty tables, so..."
Candace F.,"Atlanta, GA",7,101,3,3.0,5/21/2017,Came a few weeks ago with a friend at the end of lunch time and had a pleasant experience. Their asparagus is seasoned well... which is the whole point of this review because so many places act like veggies don't need seasoning! You're probably not coming to this place for asparagus but I had to attempt to have something healthy on my plate so don't judge me ok?! I don't drink beer but did notice they have quite a variety available!
Annette B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,39,,3.0,10/27/2017,"Upon arriving to this restaurant on the evening of October 26th, there was a red haired hostess that didn't wait on me and my guest.  She saw us and acted as though she didn't.  This was not only rude, but unprofessionally.  Something should be done about this.  Then a male host with salt and pepper hair came and told us he would seat us in a minute.  Once we were seated, Shay did everything possible to make sure we were completely happy and satisfied.  She went over and beyond to continually checked on us and asked if there was more she could do for us.  Her service was terrific and the food was just as we ordered it."
Kitty L.,"Baltimore, MD",4,20,39,2.0,12/26/2016,"So, the day after Christmas, hubby and I decided to eat here because our planned one o'clock movie was sold out. First time here and definitely will be the last!  The host seated customers as well as waited tables. The table had bread crumbs. Our waiter promptly arrived at our table in 10 minutes to introduce himself & take our beverage orders. I ordered simple calamari and hubby a platter. Well the calamari was over cooked, bland and greasy."
Vicki K.,"Towson, MD",2,59,,5.0,6/9/2017,We had the soup in sour dough bread bowls. The bread bowls were grilled to perfection. The soup was delicious. The only complaint was there wasn't a lot of soup. Our server was great. We will come back again and try some other foods. We had a small Pizzokki. It was an awesome dessert.
Kayisha E.,"Baltimore, MD",1,28,5,3.0,7/26/2017,"I've been here three times. The ambiance is nice and the staff is pleasant. My first experience was with my boys to get a pizookie, which is really good. I returned by myself to fix a chocolate craving and ordered the chocolate chunk pizookie again.  The third time included food. I purchased a deep dish pizza, which after traveling to Chicago is one of my favorite styles of pizza. What we received was lackluster. It seemed we would have been better off purchasing a Hot N Ready for $5. Overall, this is a cool place to hang out, especially if you want to watch sports."
Taylor H.,"Baltimore, MD",0,7,2,4.0,12/18/2017,"The food is SO good, which makes this one of my favorite places to eat in Towson. However, the service is hit or miss. Sometimes we will get someone wonderful and other times we will get someone who never checks in, and when you need them they are no where to be found. I'm going to keep coming just because the food is so great I just wish the staff cared more."
Michelle Y.,"Towson, MD",304,35,61,3.0,7/23/2017,"I would say Bj's is your average sports bar type place with a nicer interior. I've been to this location twice and both times were just okay. Nothing super special, but nothing terrible either. Second time I went, my knife was covered in a layer of grime and the kitchen forgot my egg on my chicken steak fried sandwich. Service was great, food was alright."
Scott F.,"Towson, MD",0,5,,1.0,9/1/2017,"Not sure what is worse, the food or the service. My wife and I went for a quick dinner.  Ordered chips and queso but got chips and guac. When we pointed this out our server apologized and said she would get the queso right out. 30 minutes (YES thirty minutes) later and after numerous requests which she blamed on the kitchen, the manager brought out our queso. She told us there would be no charge, but still charged us for the chips and guac that we didnt order bit she said to just go ahead and eat. Salad served with wrong dressing.  Fish tacos tasted like they had a vat of salt in them, inedible.  Pork chop tough and no taste. Avoid this place...horrible."
Mel L.,"Pikesville, MD",168,43,190,3.0,10/2/2016,"I visited BJs for the first time on Friday 9/30. My friend recommended we go to get the pizookies. I will say they were pretty darn good and very filling, but unfortunately that's where the good part of this review ends. We were taken to a nice booth immediately. However, we were not greeted or given drinks for at least 10 minutes. Additionally, we were never given napkins for the messy dessert and the spoons we received were dirty. They never brought out our french fries and I had to call our waitress over to ask about the status of the fries. She never came over to check on us probably because we were only a group of two which I guess makes us not as important. She was not very friendly and did not take much interest in my food allergy.  If I'm being honest I will probably go back just because the food is really good. If the service had been better, I would have given this 5 stars."
Sherie A.,"Springfield, VA",18,15,16,1.0,3/12/2017,We came on a Sunday before our movie.  30 mins later we are still waiting for our food.  Waitress no where to be found to ask about our order.
Jay S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,14,,2.0,4/16/2017,"BJ's is not a place I would typically visit BUT we met a group of family and friends that wanted a local corporate restaurant. Briefly, here were my issues during our last visit: - While we had a somewhat large party (7 adults), our wait was one hour and 15 minutes. There were two 12 tops that remained empty the entire time we waited AND the entire time we ate our meal (as we left, they finally split one of the 12 tops for two families). The staff easily could have split one of the twelve tops (they obviously weren't holding it for a reservation or a walk up group). - My meal came with no sauce even though the menu listed a sauce...it was so dry and flavorless. - My meal was listed as ""spicy"" but there was no spice...nor any flavor...again, zero flavor. That said, it wasn't all bad... - The menu has lots of interesting items (but since there is no flavor to their food, it doesn't matter if there are 500 items on the menu). - Our waiter was fantastic, so maybe their focus is customer service instead of focusing on quality of the food. People who prefer corporate dining over local restaurants, places that are the same in Topeka as they are in Wilmington, will love this BJ's. We won't be going back, though...not our style and the food has zero taste."
Nikia H.,"Parkville, MD",54,4,3,4.0,8/22/2016,"This is my second time here and again I was really impressed with the food.  The menu is so plentiful and there is a lot to choose from.  My first experience was great food wise but the service was not so good.  But tonight for a nice family dinner I was impressed with the service and patience the waitress showed (we have a 6 year old and 20 month old)  she was helpful and cheerful and checked on us frequently. So, my overall review is a favorable one and I could totally see my family and I having some great times here!"
Lynna O.,"Damascus, MD",0,6,9,2.0,8/1/2016,"Not such a great experience at all. Not what I was expecting at all. Defiantly not a DEEP dish. More like a fat hand tossed pizza crust.  Pizza Hut tastes better... Let me explain.  I would just 1st like to start by mentioning that BJs offers "" curbside delivery "" when you are placing a carry out order.  I placed my order around 8:30pm. I was told it would be about 15-20min for my delivery. When I called and requested the curbside, no one asked for a number to reach me on, no one asked for what make and model I would be in and no one mentioned where to park for this "" curbside "" that is offered.  I ordered a medium size pepperoni and cheese  CHICAGO deep dish pizza. I called BJs back to let them know I was in the front of the restaurant parked in a valet spot, because there are no designated "" curbside "" delivery spots. When I called again, no one asked what car I would be in, I had to mention it.  Around 9pm I got irritated and walked in and asked for my pizza. It was just sitting the heated area where pizzas are dropped off. I payed my bill, walked to car and checked the pizza ( they did not open the box to check the pizza). I noticed it was a chicken and bbq pizza... Not what I ordered. So I walked back in and ask to speak with the manager because I was simply irritated at this point.  He had offered to give me a Large pepp and cheese pizza that was already in the over and remove my charge for the incorrect pizza. I said okay and asked about the curbside the restaurant offered. He only said that he would walk it out. Didn't really answer anything about curbside for me at all.  15more min later and after everything I got my pizza around 9:30... Not cool.  Got home and tried eating the pizza, but it was way too doughy... It looked done on the outside but the cooked part of the pizza peeled right off and there was the base of the pizza... Doughy. There were some kind of bruschetta tomatoes on top? Design I guess? But they were all Over the pizza. No where on the menu did it mention that.  I'll say that it might have been that they were in a rush to give me a pizza because of the error that occurred previously, but at least have some sort of pride in what you give to your customers. The pics online looks like BJs has amazing food. I was excited to try it but super let down even after the manager tried to fix it. Terrible.  Don't know if It's worth going back. The only good thing out of this was that this terrible pizza that was not eaten was free.  2 stars for BJs. Customer service was horrible, the manager tried to fix this error, but this could of all been prevented if management had a process in place for carry out food."
Emilie J.,"Towson, MD",11,103,53,4.0,3/4/2017,"I am aaaall about the Ahi Poke dish. I get it everytime I'm here. I've also enjoyed the Peruvian Salmon Quinoa Bowl which I would like even better without the tomatoes in it. I ordered the ribeye last time I came. It was a bit under done (I ordered medium rare and it was more on the rare side) which made it too chewy. I should have sent it back to get put back on the fire, but I was satisfied with my food overall. Download their app for deals AND pay for your meal without any hassles or waiting especially if it's a busy night and you're eating at the bar."
Ann K.,"Baltimore, MD",37,36,15,3.0,3/18/2017,"We are really torn about this place. We have always enjoyed the food and beer, but the service...   So the kitchen seems to be the main culprit. We've been during very busy times, but also at lunch when the restaurant is only half full and it tends to be slow. The servers are usually good, although once or twice that's also been part of the problem.    We continue to go because the food is always good, the FOOD IS ALWAYS GOOD, and it's convenient when going to movies. But no one wants to have to rush out to make it to a show, or be late, when you leave ample time to make it.    So our mixed feelings continue. I wish they would just make it easy on us... quicker service and a well trained staff, or the food wasn't so darn good."
Eric C.,"Baltimore, MD",3,33,16,3.0,9/6/2017,"I went in this past Saturday night with my friends and sat at one of the tables at the bar. We didn't order much food, just the chips and dip and the calamari. I tried their house porter and the stout on the draft. Beer came out nice and cold and the bar food was okay but nothing of spectacular. The service could've been better, I saw the server sitting around with her friends while we were waiting to order more drinks."
Misty J.,"Baltimore, MD",12,33,43,5.0,3/6/2017,"I'm giving this place 5 star for two things and two things only: their berry burst cider which is their own beer brew but looks and tastes more like a wine cooler and their AMAZING . . . MONKEY BREAD PIZOOKIE'S!!!!!!!!  Anyone from BJ's reading this, don't EVER get rid of this thing! Seriously, don't do it! Ugghhhh warm cinnamon and brown sugar monkey bread and I only get 1 scoop of ice cream and not the two it comes with! BEST THING EVER!!! I've even caught myself wanting to go there just for dessert. Some of their entrees are good like the chicken piadina or their bacon cheeseburgers but they're pretty standard. I get my piadina with BBQ instead of ranch and no tomatoes!  Service is either good or outstanding, depending on your server! Deep dish pizzas aren't the best! I'm also from the north so my standards of pizza are prettttyyyyyyyyy freaking high!!! Only other downside is the parking! And with everything else in such a close vicinity, parking can be a nightmare! My husband and I have managed to find some street parking that's always free after 6 and always open, after visiting so many times!  Seriously, thank me later for the monkey bread pizooki! Deeelisshhhhhh!!!!"
Malissa V.,"Milford Mill, MD",30,3,3,4.0,5/4/2017,"This was my first one here. The food was very tasty and reasonably priced. I ordered the homemade guacamole and chips as my appetizer, the New Orleans Jambalaya as my entree and to finish the night I ordered a single scoop of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chip ice cream. Everything was delicious and well prepared. Service started off a little rocky in the beginning. But the night ended well. I'll definitely comeback again."
Connor S.,"Palm Springs, CA",1,56,5,1.0,12/5/2016,"I have been to BJ'S many times in southern CA, so I am familiar with the food and beer. I have always had a great experience  and returned again and again. This time however, I had a most horrible experience. Without droning on too long, I will say that our server was completely useless. She was more interested in sitting at a table behind us to get on her phone and text. That being said, she was unhelpful, inattentive, our (not great)food was not hot, our water was never refreshed and we had no opportunity to order more drinks! All bad stuff. I would gladly pass along her name, buy she never told us when we sat down. That being said, the experience will make me think twice about returning. With so many other options out there...why would I bother going back?  I say, pass on BJ's... there is much better out there!"
Kim B.,"Baltimore, MD",284,148,356,5.0,1/6/2017,"While visiting with my son and his family around the holidays he mentioned how much he liked BJ's so when I saw they had a ""B1G1 Free"" Entree hubby and I decided to treat our son to dinner.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5:00 and the place was still pretty empty which was fine with me.  We were seated at a table in the bar area and were immediately greeted by Ashley who explained the specials and took our drink orders.  For appetizers we went with the Calamari and Chicken Lettuce Wraps and both were quite delicious.  I've had Lettuce Wraps at several restaurants and BJ's take on one of my favorites was quite original - the chicken was mixed with spices, veggies, water chestnuts and topped with Wonton Strips and served with a Sesame Soy Sauce and a Spicy Mustard (trust me when I say make sure you have a full glass of water nearby if you have a tender tongue.  I love spicy things but my tongue was burning for a few moments).  We totally lucked out coming on a Thursday night - my son and I were in the mood for ribs and as luck would have it Thursdays is Rib Night and you cannot beat the deal they have.  For $18.95 you get a Whole Rack of Ribs, Salad, 2 Sides and a Pizookie for dessert.  Both the House and Caesar Salads were fresh and flavorful and each was enough for 2 people.  The ribs were tender and I really loved the flavor that the dry rub topped with a sweet heat bbq sauce and unlike a lot of restaurants, they don't upcharge for premium sides - I went with the Roasted Asparagus and Shoestring Fries.  The fries were hot and crispy, salted to perfection and didn't even need ketchup (which says a lot for this admitted condiment-aholic) and the Asparagus were Crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside and tasted like they had been dusted with Parmesan Cheese and I couldn't get over how large the portions were, I actually brought home half of my entire dinner.  Hubby got the Sirloin (also with the fries and asparagus as sides) and he said it was quite tasty but not the best he's ever had, he said he'd give it a B-.  We've never been the type of people who save room for dessert (we usually can't even finish our entire meals) but since the Pizookies were included in the Rib Special we made an exception and left a little wiggle room.  I chose the Monkey Bread and my son chose the Salted Caramel Pizookie, both were topped with 2 Scoops of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (and my sons was drizzled with caramel and mini chocolate chips).  The Pizookies come out warm, right out of the oven and talk about a decadent treat.  Our entire bill for 3 meals, 2 appetizers and 3 drinks came to about $66 before the tip which is an awesome deal plus they have a Premier Diner's Club where you earn a point for every dollar spent (there's also an app where you can keep track) and you can save to redeem for money off, free items, etc.  Parking is validated in the garage attached to the movie theater so it only costs $2 and it sure beats looking for a parking space in the Towson area.  We will definitely be back, I'm looking forward to checking out the lunch specials, the Chicken Fajita Soup in particular."
Melanie F.,"Towson, MD",20,1,1,4.0,5/4/2017,"I've been here a few times and the food and drinks are always good. This time, I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts.  They were pretty tasty and not what you would normally think of Brussels sprouts. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon and it didn't disappoint either. And the 2 strawberry mojitos I had were perfect.  Tonight, however, the service was a little lacking.  Maybe because it was rather busy for a Thursday.  Still, overall, it's a good place to go for food, drinks and conversation."
Tom S.,"Bel Air, MD",1,16,21,4.0,3/19/2017,"The wife and I tried to call ahead but their call ahead seating is a little unusual. We wound up just walking in close to 5 PM on a Saturday evening and got a table immediately. The hostess was very nice and explained a couple things on the menu before turning it over to our waitress. Loreal was our waitress. She seemed nice and knew what she was doing. I ordered the Ahi Poke as an appetizer. Someone from the kitchen brought that before we received our drinks or silverware. We thought we would try the beer sampler which provided four beers of your choosing in sampler glasses. Those were perfect and they even label the beer in front of each glass. For dinner the wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad and I chose the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. For the appetizer and entrée the tuna was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the chicken tacos and the dressing that was added on the side was a perfect combination. I noticed that I could download an app for my phone under this restaurant and after doing so, discovered a $10 off coupon that I could immediately use for this meal. The food and atmosphere was excellent. The desserts look great but we had no room left after eating the meal."
Jill B.,"Baltimore, MD",246,146,289,5.0,6/30/2015,"This place is amazing!!! I live and work in the area and there is so much amazing about this place. I am thrilled its open.  1st thing - do this now - RIGHT NOW - go to their website and join the premier club. It takes 24 hours to go into effect, and you want to make sure you get your points!  I will elaborate later on the quality and consistency of the service (AMAZING), the quality and flavors of the food (also AMAZING), and atmosphere (PERFECT).  You would not believe this was a chain if it weren't for all the technological awesomeness they have thrown in through their website and app. Group orders, where you can pay separately, that you can place before you go for carry out OR DINE IN!!!! Are you frickin kidding? this is the solution to short lunch breaks! having your lunch waiting for you when you arrive saves at least 10 minutes.  Now the service was amazing, but that was because we had Shea as our server. I don't know if everyone that works there is as wonderful, but if you get Shea you're in for a great experience.  I'm still dreaming about the possibility of one day getting one of the ridiculous desserts. And our lunch trio has expanded to at least 6 next time just from our rave reviews at work!"
Teresa F.,"Encinitas, CA",901,242,115,3.0,10/18/2016,"Not consistently, super fresh ingredients, but an array of dishes. Definitely a sports bar. Decadent Pa-Zookie dessert is a treat, warm cookie with ice cream. Salted caramel, yum! Friendly and patient staff with a foodie. Alas, I've tried several dishes here, and was repeatedly disappointed. Next I'll have to try their ""enlightened entree"" options, like salmon and quinoa, but I don't like farm-raised fish. Fortunately, they have a few ""enlightened"" salads which are pretty good. Best considered for those who like blaring sports, pizza, beer, and burgers."
Alana B.,"Towson, MD",0,13,,2.0,6/27/2017,"BJ's was my favorite spot for lunch during my lunch hour at work. They offered curbside pick up and lunch specials all done online. BJs curbside lunch was my routine every few weeks. It was speedy. The host was very nice and met me at my card with food.  My visit today reminded me of how cumbersome my last visit here was and I wish I would've remembered before I placed my order. Now when you arrive curbside and call the curbside number they tell you ""you gonna have to come to the bar To get your order"" .  (This happened last time too) This review is more  so to speak on the staffing .  There are two hosts at the front. A runner that brings to go orders to the bar (not sure if they're a waitress too) . The bartender is left to take to go orders, cash them out, serve drinks at the bar and tend to food orders as well. The bartender has a heavy load to carry , yet is the most pleasant of the employees out of all of the other employees that are far from busy while the bartender takes on everything.  The bartender asked the runner if she could bag my order that the runner brought out while the bartender was making a drink. The runner rolled her eyes and ignored the bartender and walked back to kitchen .  The food was good as always. But the staffing during lunch can use improvement. As a customer it feels like everyone else is sitting around not offering help and everything is on the bartender . It's upsetting to be offered curbside when it truly no longer exists at least during the week."
Sarah P.,"Middle River, MD",114,4,,1.0,9/3/2016,"This was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had in Towson. There are many decent local places to choose from in this area, and I really wish we would have opted for one of those.  My husband and I came in to watch college football and have dinner. We sat at the bar right in front of the game we wanted to see. I ordered the queso with chips, and the Twisted BLT salad.  My husband ordered a full rack of ribs and mashed potatoes.  Oh where to begin? The queso came out lukewarm and the chips were extremely stale. I asked them to reheat it since it was like eating coagulated velveeta.  My salad came out drenched in dressing. I don't know if the spinach was going bad and they were trying to cover it up, or if the half cup of dressing wilted the spinach. There was also no bacon on the salad. Nice BLT with no B! My hubby's mashed potatoes tasted like potato gum. Instant,  I guess. Gross. The ribs were the worst we have ever had. They had the consistency of overcooked chicken; dense and chewy with the flavor of a McRib. Also, the game we were clearly watching was turned off twice (channel change), which was remedied both times...once, ok. But twice? Weird! Beyond the terrible food was the service. Both bartenders were pleasant but not proactive at all. They never came back after the food was delivered so I didn't get a chance to tell them how bad everything was. When we told her we wanted to pay the check she then asked, ""Do you want boxes to take this home?"" I told her,  ""No, that was pretty much the worst food I ever had."" Her reply was, ""Oh! I could have gotten you something else!"" Well yeah, I guess if you had checked on us that would have been an option. She then removed just one plate of the disastrous food we left behind, instead of getting it out of my sight. It also clearly did not occur to her to be proactive enough to have a manager come talk to us. After she returned our credit card and we sat to finish our drinks for about another 20 mins, we never saw her again. Really unacceptable for a chain, although I should know better than to eat at a chain!"
Caitlin C.,"Perry Hall, MD",2,18,4,3.0,1/24/2017,"Service is quick, good pizza, friendly staff. Tons of beers on tap and a large diverse menu. Prices are a bit high but the portions are good. Big screen TVs throughout the restaurant to watch any sports event that is on"
Jeffrey A.,"Baltimore, MD",11,24,,4.0,7/3/2017,"This is our 2nd time going here (it's a relatively new Restaurant here). Overall, it's a very good Restaurant. They have a large Menu; lots of choices. IMHO, this place has the best Clam Chowder anywhere. Also, very good service. (Ashley was a very good Waitress). I'm not really a drinker, but they have tons of liquor, wine, etc. Parking here is  very unpredictable. Its hit or miss. We will be back. They also have a special for lunch (11- 3 Mon- Fri). Unlimited soup & salads; $10.00."
