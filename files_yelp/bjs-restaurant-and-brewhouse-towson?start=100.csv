Melissa G.,"Nottingham, MD",36,4,3,5.0,2/14/2016,Self seating in the bar! Saved lots of time on 45 minute wait. Service was good. Siracha queso dip and Mediterranean chicken tacos. Yum! Will definitely return.
Jalisa J.,"Owings Mills, MD",56,128,178,4.0,12/14/2015,I've been here two or three times and have yet to be disappointed! The food is delicious and the beer is good. We have always had great servers and a good time at BJ's.
Mike B.,"Nottingham, MD",0,3,,4.0,4/24/2016,"Good brews with plenty of selections. I really like the bar setup if your a sports junkie like myself. Food is good also, I recommend this place. Cheers"
Tyesha C.,"Baltimore, MD",3,33,17,1.0,11/14/2015,I have meat allergies to red meat & pork. I asked for ravioli with chicken instead of sausage. This order was to go. So when I get home there was pork all throughout. Fortunately I noticed after 2 bites that it did contain pork and I did not have any immediate reaction. That womps! Probably not going back ever again.
Megan M.,"New York, NY",142,72,94,5.0,10/30/2015,"Just ate at BJ's for dinner and our mean and service was great. Our waitress Caitlyn S was very attentive and sweet. Our food was done perfectly, I had the bacon avocado burger (highly recommended). The only complaint was out food came out very quickly and we didn't get to finish our appetizer. Other than that very good"
Don M.,"Towson, MD",0,38,2,2.0,12/19/2015,"Ok, I don't normally leave two star reviews but this place has potential so I am hoping it will help. The food is not bad at all. Though we never got our appetizer, the two sandwiches and salmon plate we ordered was better than expected for a chain resturant.  The issue here was horrible service. I would have even overlooked that, but it was not just our waitress, it was the lot of them. You can see into the kitchen from the dinning room, so watching 6 or more wait staff in there shooting the bull while your food gets cold is more than a little irritating. We could hear the other tables also complaining so it was not just us. I should add we were there at 11:30am on a Saturday, so not at all busy. This was our first time here, and it will be a bit before we return. Hope they get better, and I get a chance to improve this review!"
Jerry C.,"Baltimore, MD",2,122,54,1.0,11/6/2015,"Not a fan of this place. This was my third time here. Food taste like any commercial franchise place--some fresh and a lot of processed. Sitting at the bar the service was great. Once we moved to tables, it was mediocre. Management had too few servers to handle a Friday night. We rarely saw our server. Had to ask the bartender to  check on our drinks. One runner who brought our friends' pizza was too lazy to walk around the table and hand it to him. She just stuck it out for someone to grab so we could pass it around to the right person. The look on the runners face was ""really you gonna make me walk over 4ft?""  Finally, at the end of the night, had to ask the bartender to take our checks because our server couldn't be found."
Charles Peter D.,"Towson, MD",0,20,,1.0,10/29/2015,Nothing special here. To pool bar room for food with a California twist. Had the French dip sandwich and it was not him pressed. Second time I went I had The avocado burger and it was dry and overcooked
Melonie O.,"Catonsville, MD",0,14,28,1.0,12/3/2015,"service was terrible and there was a little flying bug on my food. when I asked the server to take it back, she got an attitude. will not be attending this place again."
Sean O.,"Baltimore, MD",1,2,,4.0,2/15/2016,"My girlfriend and I came here after walking out of ""World of Beer"", next door. I'm glad we did! We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted and introduced to both bartenders working. The lady that served us was engaging, made great suggestions and truly made the experience great. I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger, as suggested by the server. Although the burger was overcooked, it still tasted good. I also enjoyed their house drafts on tap, I would suggest the Hopstorm IPA. I would definitely return again just based on the service alone."
Chase S.,"Baltimore, MD",0,21,16,3.0,11/23/2015,"The food is great!  There is not a doubt about that, but tonight's service was terrible.  The wait for the food was long (and there is not a lot of patrons in the restaurant). One of our meals was given to another party. We never received our appetizers. I expect better from this franchise."
Alan S.,"Owings Mills, MD",0,15,,5.0,8/10/2016,Excellent burgers. Fun vibe. A little noisy. Easy parking in garage. Food is always good. Do the beer tasting. They give you 5 or 6 small glasses of beer. Lots of fun. Wide selection of beers. Good times. Reasonably priced. Right next to the Cinemark movies.
Kim S.,"Reisterstown, MD",45,16,22,5.0,6/19/2015,I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. From the decor to the bartenders.. everything was great. I had the Fried Artichokes and the Brussel sprouts.. both were excellent. I would highly recommend this place.
Tanisha A.,"Roanoke, VA",67,18,,5.0,11/6/2015,"Stopping here was a last minute decision when looking for late lunch/early dinner. I had read good things regarding this place on their facebook page but we wanted to be the judges for ourselves. Service was awesome, atmosphere and dining experience was awesome. I LOVE the wide variety of selections they have to choose from. Their beer and desert selection is awesome. We had a bacon cheeseburger and the ravioli. The burger had a wonderful flavor and cooked perfect for a well done burger. The ravioli was sooooo good. It had the perfect amount of meat and cheese. The only thing I will mention to the server if it happens again is that the food could have been slightly warmer when served. Aside from that we are sure we will visit again!"
Alli R.,"Mount Wolf, PA",39,42,,3.0,9/27/2015,"Visited Bj's on two occasions. Great location, but unless you know the area, parking stinks. The food was really good and I would give more stars, but the first time they were out of root beer. The second visit, the root beer was extremely flat and I couldn't drink it. The avocado rolls are fantastic. Very unique and the dipping sauce is excellent. The service was great both times as well. Although the second time, the waiter seemed to disappear at the end. I would go back because I enjoyed the food. Hopefully one day I will get to try their root beer!!"
Steve E.,"Towson, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2015,"If I could give less stars I would. 3 times I've been there and 3 times I left disappointed. The first time our Bartender forgot to put in our food order and since we had a movie to catch, we weren't able to get it. Second time wings took 25+ minutes to arrive to the table and the ribs were extremely tough. We said something to the server and she didn't even acknowledge the complaint. The third and worst time we sat in the cocktail area and we stared at our drinks for 10 minutes before we had to flag our server down to get them. Again wings took extremely long and had to cancel them.  Zero stars. Terrible service for just OK food. Avoid at all costs in my opinion. Save your $$$"
Paulette H.,"Parkville, MD",40,1,,1.0,12/6/2015,"I don't normally write  reviews on restaurants, but this one was the worst! The service wasn't great, our waiter had no customer service skills.  When I received my food it was incorrect. I sent it back and it returned still incorrect.  They never apologize for the inconvenience.  The manager was sitting  across from us and didn't even come over to apologize.  I will not return to this establishment again!"
Barry B.,"Baltimore, MD",165,1,,1.0,1/21/2016,This is one of the worst places I've been to. First we start 35 mins before a server came. Another 25 minutes for our drinks and finally another 45 minutes for our entrees. Everyone at my table had their food and I get mine 35 minutes after they finish. This is horrible. I will never come back. The first salmon they brought was dry and over cooked and Noe this one is just as bad. I'm too thru
Stephanie G.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",12,3,,4.0,10/9/2015,Fun date night in the heart of Towson! Get discounted tickets for the movies afterwards!
Pete N.,"Towson, MD",0,6,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Everything seemed fine while we were there for lunch June 11, but a few hours later we were both really sick to our stomachs and it ruined our weekend.  It was the only thing we ate all day so no doubt we got food poisoning."
