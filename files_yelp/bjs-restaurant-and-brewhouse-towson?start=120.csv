Elizabeth H.,"Sparks, NV",50,6,,5.0,1/5/2016,I got one of the  personal pizza for dinner with a bunch of friends and it was delicious. All of us ended up getting them. The personal pizzas where no bigger than a plate but that filled us up we also got desserts and ended up just getting three and all six of us split them. I will definitely go back there again.
Alexis C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",37,74,116,5.0,6/30/2015,"I love the location since you can grab dinner and walk to the movie theatre! Brussel sprouts, cherry chipotle salmon, and s'mores pizookie are a must!"
Jason P.,"Towson, MD",5,53,15,3.0,7/15/2015,"Their own beer is pretty good and there are a lot of menu options -- but otherwise, there's nothing that would draw me here -- primarily based on the location.Truthfully, I don't know why/how a restaurant chain like BJ's exists in this area. Well, I guess I do... shoppers and tourists. There are just much better local independent options 10 mins away that I would patronize before BJ's."
Jason B.,"Woodstock, MD",0,20,3,3.0,12/20/2015,"Atmosphere is good and the TVs are big and good quality. The food is okay, decent  and the menu is huge so you should be able to find something you like. Large beer selection on tap."
Maurice O.,"Cockeysville, MD",1,11,,4.0,12/6/2015,"I wish i could give a 3.5 but ill round up because the food is awesome. But if you go here, expect to be there awhile. Never had to wait for a table but ive ALWAYS had to wait way longer than acceptable for a server. And the time it takes to get your food after you order is outrageous too. Then when you get the food, might as well ask for the check. The food, beer, and dessert are all great. But the wait makes it sometimes better just to go elsewhere. But if youre in no rush, eat at this place."
Rod R.,"Parkville, MD",0,6,6,5.0,8/8/2015,Service was great. Facility is nice and clean. Tons of micro brews and the deep dish pizza was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend.
Mark K.,"Stewartstown, PA",0,1,,5.0,6/18/2016,The lemon thyme chicken was delicious and the deep dish pizza was very good. The service was excellent. Looking forward to going back again!
Delinda J.,"Parkville, MD",3,19,,4.0,7/18/2015,"Great, great and great! Kale and brussel sprout salad was awesome and bj's classic combo pan pizza was tasty! Save room for a pizookie...certainly  a must try! Delosh and great service!"
Kristina T.,"Germantown, MD",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2016,"It took the waiter 30 minutes to get out order. We then waited an addition 30+ for our meals which, ended up getting dropped on the floor before they reached the table. We were told they would rush the orders and it ended up taking another 30 minutes and coming out wrong. The manager came over and apologized but did not try and make the situation right. Terrible service, we barely even saw our waiter the whole night."
Jen D.,"Nottingham, MD",0,26,7,4.0,6/17/2015,"Brand new place. Really cool atmosphere. My husband had a beer and I had a skinny Rita. Both good. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The pizza (deep dish) was good! Flakey and not too greasy. Our waiter talked us into downloading the BJs app to start collecting reward points, so we did. When the bill came, my husband noticed you can pay through the app, so he did. We left. The waiter ran after us into the parking garage. We asked if we forgot something and he said, ""you didn't pay!"" We told him we paid through the app. It was the first time he had a guest pay through the app...honest mistake on his part. Also, the restaurant will validate your parking. We had them validate it, but when we put the ticket in, it wasn't validated. We paid...it is only $2 to park anyway. Overall, good food. But the app needs some help!"
Jamie B.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,16,,1.0,10/12/2015,"This was a very disappointing dinner. I'll start my review with the food: Calamari Appetizer- Not that crispy. Included more ""rings"" than tentacles.  Sirloin steak cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts: steak was not medium rare. It was more like medium with the outside very well done. Hard to explain... but it was tough. It did have a tasty rub on it though, but since it was so dry I had to ask for steak sauce. The mashed potatoes were very good but you really can't mess that up. The brussel sprouts were dry, flavorless, and luke warm.  Greek chicken wrap: My mom ordered this and while I did not try it, she said that it was not that good. The rice salad served with it was cold and she didn't like it.  Jambalaya: My dad ordered this and I did try it. I thought it had okay flavor. It had some spice. But he wasn't impressed. It had a lot of sauce and should have been served with bread. He asked for some bread, which the waiter did bring out, but he seemed kind of put off.  Pink Cadillac martini- this drink tasted very good but I felt that it had more juice than alcohol. Usually a martini is a bit stronger. This was more like a fruity mixed drink.  Service: we had come here to celebrate my mother's birthday. I told the person on the phone when I made the reservation that it was her birthday and asked if they did anything. They said yes. Well... they did nothing. It was a bit disappointing especially after the sub par food. Also I had asked the waiter if he recommended the steak, and if it was tender. He said yes. We also asked him if calamari was good, he said it was the most popular appetizer. My mother asked him if the greek chicken wrap was a good choice, and he said it was popular. Lies! We will not be returning."
Ralph K.,"Baltimore, MD",4,7,,3.0,7/25/2015,"Only 3 stars due to the service we received. If it was based on food alone, the score would be much lower. I stopped in shortly after this place opened to have a business lunch with an influential friend of mine. Other than our server, Marianna, we were honestly not impressed.  Given what she had to work with it really made our experience great. We ordered an avocado appetizer. Some sort of egg roll. I can only imagine it was frozen. The avocado was mushy and brown. My Guest got a salad and the dressing was overly sweet as was the dipping sauce for the appetizer. It was nearly a small bowl of molasses. Draft beer was good and my lunch entrée was acceptable. I mostly felt like it was any chain restaurant. If the food quality improves as a staff becomes more experienced it could be a good place assuming that the staff is as good as as our server was. I hear that the pizza here is good, so I am hoping to give it a second shot."
Marci C.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,30,41,4.0,7/18/2015,I ordered the kale salad. I was a little nervous based on other reviews. I got the dressing on the side. The salad was DELICIOUS. The lettuce was crisp and yummy! My son got a grilled cheese which was huge. My hubby got the Barbaco chicken. All were very very good. The only small issue was the main dishes came out too early. We didn't have much time to eat the appetizers.
Kelly J.,"Baltimore, MD",1,4,,5.0,6/23/2015,"Our family came in for dinner tonight & had an amazing experience! The service was awesome, our server Maria (I hope I got it right!) took great care of us! The food was fantastic, and we were thrilled to enjoy a new spot that is kid friendly & we could enjoy a tasty brew we have been waiting for quite some time for a place like this in our neighborhood! We will be back again for sure."
Sarah J.,"Baltimore, MD",0,5,,5.0,7/10/2015,"Sat in the cocktail section during lunch. Beautiful bar, for starters. Love the open, garage door-style windows. Really brought in the summer vibes. Our server, Maryana, was impeccable. Our party had pushed two tables together in her section (she even helped move them!) and she handled our large party effortlessly. Drinks were rung in and came out quickly (the bar was slow and I noticed her get a bartenders attention to make sure they knew a drink order was in). Encouraged us to join the rewards program, which I did. Food came out perfectly, in a good amount of time, and was delicious! I got a mini deep dish pizza. So. Freaking. Good. Crust is buttery and crispy...I love it! Maryana was very attentive, unobtrusively offering refills on drinks as necessary, and bringing other little things (extra sides of mayo and such) and clearing empty plates with cheer and good humor.  Highly recommend for the food, drinks, and service. Will definitely be back."
Kate B.,"Charles North, Baltimore, MD",0,10,,5.0,1/15/2016,"We just tried BJ's today and it was great.  The food was good, our server was terrific, and they had a great kids' menu.  This is an excellent addition to the movie theater development."
Steve G.,"Towson, MD",32,82,21,4.0,11/4/2015,"I like their food and beer selections.  On the beer side I love the fact they offer not only their own brews, but also several other locals which I enjoy.  I typically eat at the bar and I've never had a bad experience.  The staff is very good and will readily answer your questions about the beers. They have made several good recommendations.  I've enjoyed the dinners I've had there--particularly the Asian Chicken Salad and the Steak.  (I think they recently dropped that salad from their menu but they do have others which I will try in the future.)  They have plenty of TV's so you can catch a game while you're there.  (I kinda wish they gave the option of having the small boxes where you can get the audio for the game you're watching as opposed to the music over the PA.)  I would recommend downloading their smartphone app since they do offer some freebies (such as appetizers).  They also offer free wifi.  (Side note: another nearby restaurant also offers wifi and their signal is pretty strong. So you have two potential options.)  Overall I like the place and like to stop off for a beer, dinner, or snack after going to the nearby movie theater."
Amber W.,"Parkville, MD",42,10,7,2.0,1/11/2016,"Went here once before and had a good time, but this past Friday's visit did not live up to my expectations.  We found seats at the bar easily and ordered some beers.  shortly after looking at the menu we decided to order some potato skins.  The bartender put in our order and in like 10min. set out some plates and silverware for us.  we finished our first beers and ordered 2 more while waiting on our potato skins.  then after 40min. went by after ordering our potato skins we decided we needed to say something, and while having beers full in front of us it was hard to get the bartenders attention.  eventually we did and she seemed shocked we did not have our food yet and went back to check on it.  she came back 5min. later saying it would be about 2min. the first batch was burnt and no one told her.  so 15min. later she goes back into the back to bring us our potato skins.  I was so hungry at this point that I just at the potato skins even though they hardly had any cheese on them and were over done a bit.  We waited over an hour for poor potato skins.  It made me really sad, and the server never apologized for the wait or anything.  We left shortly after kind of wishing we would have gone somewhere else.  I do not know if we will come here again when we are looking for drinks and appetizers, even if I really love their berry cider."
K M.,"Eagle Mountain, UT",0,56,,4.0,2/8/2016,"Great food in good servings. The pizookie is to die for, in every flavor! You won't regret eating here. Parking can be a hassle but the food is worth every penny."
Frank B.,"Parkville, MD",1,7,,1.0,2/14/2016,"If you want to go out for a nice Valentine's Day Dinner, send it back to the kitchen twice, because it is not cooked right and go home to make your own dinner - then this is the place for you."
