B L.,"Baltimore, MD",0,12,3,2.0,9/25/2015,Food was decent and good drink and beer selection but it took WAY too long for things to arrive. Very slow.
Matthew H.,"Washington, DC",0,4,,4.0,10/29/2015,"Great spot for a beer and a deep dish pizza. There are plenty of items on the menu that is sure to appeal to everyone. The beer flights are fun to try. The only thing I can criticize is the happy hour menu is nothing special. However, the staff, food, and drinks were good."
Judivelly T.,"Baltimore, MD",2,24,17,5.0,6/23/2015,Very attentive and friendly staff with an extensive and delicious menu. They're lunch combos are filling and well priced.
Ric K.,"Annapolis, MD",1,2,,4.0,11/11/2015,Sat at the bar... Eventually greeted by bartender right in front of me engrossed in her recipe book making a mixed drink...she said she would be right with me.....ummm...13 minutes latter another bartender stopped by and I was able to order a beer...which is what I came for....been to many BJs...but first time here....almost walked out from the wait (for beer WoB is next door)...but glad I stayed...pumpkin beer was good and the pale ale excellent...and the siracha chicken Mac and cheese great addition to menu...chicken was rubbery...but the Mac was creamy and very cheesy...wow get again....overall would rate this place poor overall based on the service (the bar not busy at all with three bartenders)...but...being that it was Veterans Day....and they had an entree special supporting our vets...then I will support them and recommend...
Michael C.,"Towson, MD",0,6,,4.0,9/29/2015,Went here with a group from work. Burger was pretty good and so was the stout. Service was quick. The menu is huge so it would be a good place to go with people who like different things. Ill probably go back.
Christopher M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,7/1/2015,"Just horrendous service. I was staring at my drink for 10 minutes before the server realized they were ready. Then he walked by it to grab a tray before delivering it me. Had to cancel my order of wings. Then when they finally came out, they were wrong."
Evelyn S.,"Essex, MD",0,7,,2.0,11/9/2015,"We were greeted at the door without smiles by the hostesses. All we were asked was 'table or booth?'  Then when we were seated it took 15 minutes before our waitress walked by our table and said she would be with us shortly.  The draft orange soda was great. (we can't drink alcohol but usually breweries have great food). We were there for lunch. I ordered the classic burger and my husband the bacon burger.  I ordered mine medium well, it was almost all rare to medium( I should have sent it back). The fries were good.  We ordered the trio of pizookas for dessert. They were fine but nothing special- my husband did like the peanut butter one.  The bathrooms were amazingly clean!  But on the way out my husband and I agreed that there is no reason we would return, nothing special about it. I do know it is fairly new and maybe the staff has not been trained in pleasantries, or it is too big and you need more waitresses, so that may be the case."
Chentile G.,"Downtown, Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,5.0,7/4/2015,"Love this place! They have BJ's Brewhouse Restaurants all over the U.S., and I have been to a few. I was excited to see that there was a new one opening within minutes from my house. The menu is very extensive, and in the years that I have been going to BJ's, I have never had bad meal. Portion size is good, prices are fair, and the beer selection is great. They actually brew their own beer. The managers are nice and walk around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal, and the staff is friendly. I have been to this location maybe 6 times since it has opened. Some of my favorites are the California club flatbread, shrimp pasta, lemon thyme chicken, chicken wings...I could go on! Oh and you have to try a chocolate chip pazookie that comes with vanilla ice cream! Ask for Amy at the bar. She has a cute Southern accent, and is the best server/bartender that I have ever had. I will be going back to BJ's for sure!"
