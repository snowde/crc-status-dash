Liz J.,"Baltimore, MD",88,325,8,3.0,3/20/2017,"Came after a movie for drinks, and it was a good place to go.  Clean, plenty of room, and they serve food pretty late.  Decent beer as well."
Christina O.,"Baltimore, MD",220,145,1315,5.0,1/7/2016,"Wow  this place is amazing ^_^ My bestfriend and I came here for a late lunch which turned into a happy hour ^_^. The interior is very nice and modern, I love the bar, they have huge TV's which that has different channels on all. The bartender was amazing, I forgot her name but she was an older white woman. She recommended the Strawberry Patch and it was really good, when I say good I mean really good. It hit the spot! We also ordered two Twisted BLT salads with mini pizzas, I had the buffalo chicken mini pizza and she had some type of meat pizza. The salad was very good, I should have requested no blue cheese crumbles since I'm not a huge fan of them. The buffalo pizza was okay, but it looked amazing. I would recommend putting more buffalo sauce on the pizza, I hardly taste any actually. My bestfriend meat pizza was good. Overall I would definitely recommend this place. It can get pricey especially with the drinks. Happy hour is a $1 of cocktails, our drink would have been $9 but it was $8."
Keejoo L.,"Alexandria, VA",168,532,130,3.0,2/23/2016,"Third time to this location now.  This one is fairly new, it's in the shopping centre with the cinemark across from the Towson mall.  Upon walking in the two hosts seemed a little clueless, they did multiple double takes at each other before picking up some menus and taking our small party of two to a table close to the bar. We had two waitresses for some reason, one that got drinks and another that was very aloof that admitted to us she was in her own world in her head. Had to flag her down to order, get sauce, check...  Me and my friend came in Tuesday which is apparently half price wine glass and bottle night . I approve of that! For dinner I decided to be a little bland and ordered the chicken club, my friend got a jalapeño burger. Both came out very timely and hot. I love these kind of shoe string fries, crispy yet flavorful. Chicken could of been seasoned a bit more and the bread ended up a little soggy but overall ingredients were fresh and well cooked. Great place to stop in for dinner pre movie.  Only tip is for service to improve a bit, both at the front of the restaurant when you walk in as well as the servers at table side. Both parties seemed a little spaced out even though it was quite busy for a Tuesday night ."
Ali W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",221,12,2,1.0,4/21/2017,Good food but the worst service on the planet. Average time spent here for 2 people is 2 hours and that is when the place isn't even full. They advertise an app where you can get rewards but don't have the intelligence to be able to take the money off that the rewards have made you. They told us it was going to be a 30 min wait and then texted us that are table was ready 2 minutes later. This place seriously needs to get it together. Every time I come I look through the window that they have next to the tables and all the waiters and cooks are just gathered in a circle talking. Don't know why it's so expensive when the service is so terrible.
Carlos G.,"Streamwood, IL",0,15,4,5.0,4/18/2017,Im in town every week from Chicago and this is one of my favorite spots. Great appetizers and great tasting meals. Flatbread pizza (with extra sauce) was delicious! Huge beer selection!
Ashton M.,"Towson, MD",61,51,28,5.0,6/12/2017,"This place has become a go-to for our family on a Friday or Saturday. It's always busy but never a long wait. There's a huge selection from salads to pasta, pizza, and burgers to satisfy all tastes. The service is always fast and friendly. We use the rewards card, which I never do, and it's worth it. There are lots of TVs showing sports, which is everywhere now, but it's not obtrusive. The burger with fried jalapeños is awesome, the fried jalapeños should be an appetizer. The calamari is really good. One negative, the queso with the chips is so hit or miss. When it's good it's the best but sometimes it's like to bottom of the barrel and barely edible, about 50% of the time, and never enough chips. It seems like an easy thing to fix. Other than that, and it's minor, BJ's remains fantastic and never disappoints."
Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285,4.0,10/16/2015,"Oh BJ's...thank you for a great meal.  My daughter and I were at Towson University for a field hockey clinic about a week ago and we didn't get to the restaurant until pretty late-around 10pm.  Thankfully they were still hopping and our waitress, Loreal C, was in a great mood.   Neither of us had eaten at a BJ's before so we blew some questions by our server and her suggestions were on-point!  We were very hungry and very thirsty...and had a long drive home ahead of us.  I ordered a Pepsi (I never order soda), a pumpkin ale, and a water and my daughter had the lemonade...fluid intake had been minimal so this was a nice way to get things going.  Drinks arrived and we ordered fish and chips and Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger.  Loreal C gave it a HIGH recommendation! The food came quickly and we jumped on some fries - they serve very skinny, well done fries which we thought were great - similar to Smashburger fries...probably previously frozen but delicious nonetheless (that was for Adam D who sees frozen fries as a dealbreaker).  My daughter LOVED her fish...yes, it's just fried fish, but it wasn't too greasy and was very flavorful.  My burger was done just as I requested (medium) and the brisket and bacon topping was a home run.   Since neither of us had eaten a real dinner, we also ordered dessert...a Pizzookie Trio.  If you've never had a Pizzookie, it's a 3""=4"" cookie served HOT in a small metal ramekin-like dish and topped with ice cream...UMMMMMMMMMM, OK!!!!!!   We had the Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia, and the Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli Chocolate.  First off, when you order the trio you should actually have three people as ONE Pizzookie and ice cream is enough for one person...However, full disclosure-I don't like leaving delicious food on the table so I toughed it out.   I was really pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal.  I like being able to spend time with the kids eating out like this as I know it will be short lived as they will be off to college sooner than I know.  I could EASILY return to BJs for another meal!"
Lori N.,"Pasadena, MD",25,19,9,5.0,3/18/2017,Quick pick for lunch.  Had a great selection and the food was awesome.  I had the lettuce wraps and the Santa Fe salad.  I will definitely return.
Rebecca G.,"Baltimore City, MD",97,348,291,4.0,11/5/2015,"A great alternative option in the Towson area, this is like a brewhouse version of Cheesecake factory, with a slightly less ""hotel-food"" menu. We've enjoyed all of the food we tried at our three visits, and the staff is always really nice, despite the fact that each time they've gotten parts of our order incorrect. On the first visit, they put in the wrong pizza size for D, and brought out the erroneous one AND the right one, at different times, even though we told them to just go with the wrong one (and they're the ones that pointed out the error). On the second visit, they forgot his salad, and the third visit, they forgot our fries. The seared ahi salad is great, quite a lot of flavor and very fresh. It does have a somewhat hidden streak of wasabi running through it, so be warned of sudden heat. The mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are good, though the multitude of sauces get a little muddled together. Mahi mahi was fresher than the shrimp, though the shrimp did have good texture. From the appetizers, the calamari is decent (nothing super special, just what you'd expect from fried calamari), and the ahi poke is good if a little too acidic by the end of the dish."
Kate Y.,"Harrisburg, PA",16,64,22,3.0,6/18/2016,I had an amazing ahi tuna salad at this place when I came for lunch while shopping nearby. It was fresh and HUGE. Service was attentive and prompt. The pizza would have been better had it been left in the oven longer. It was a pan pizza but the crust didn't get crisp or very brown.
Sana A.,"Laurel, MD",215,3,,1.0,11/19/2016,"This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I went to BJs on 11/18/16, a Friday night, for dinner with my cousins. Right from the get-go, our service from our waitress was unacceptable. There were no smiles as she greeted us and sat us down in our booth. We began by ordering our drinks.I requested a water with lemon. Our drinks were brought out and I noticed there were no lemon, so I reminded the waitress that I had requested it. She said ok, she would bring it out. I ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus pasta, an entree I order regularly and have grown to love. I specified I would not like any bread crumbs in my pasta, as well. After waiting for about 30 minutes, our food was brought out to us. This was the SECOND time we were seeing our waitress. She did not come check in on us while we were waiting to see if we needed anything. Yet again, she forgot to bring the lemons, although at this point, I was beginning to feel it was deliberate.  At this point, I tried pushing my frustrations aside and focusing on my meal, which I order regularly and am very familiar with. Unfortunately, my entree was on par with the customer service we were receiving... highly disappointing. There were barely 4 pieces of shrimp thrown into my pasta and of course, there were breadcrumbs.  I began looking for my waitress to let her know my food was not acceptable, however she was NO WHERE to be found. Yet again, she was not checking on us AT ALL. As I sat there and waited, everyone else at my table was eating their food. This was supposed to be my first real meal of the day, considering I worked all day, and I had really been looking forward to it. By the time our waitress finally showed up, I had eaten most of my meal. This was the third time we were seeing our waitress that night. She did not come check on us while we were waiting for our food, and she did not come check on us while we were eating our food. It was obvious she was not committed to providing us the customer service we usually receive at this restaurant. Nonetheless, I went ahead and informed her of my dissatisfaction. Instead of trying to alleviate my concerns, all she said was ""let me go get a manager.""  At this point, I had enough. This situation would not have escalated if our waitress had taken responsibility for her mistakes and offered us a sincere apology. The first manager that came out, a Caucasian woman, made the situation even worse. She didn't even bother to listen as I recounted our horrible experience and the nasty attitude of our waitress. All she could focus on was the fact that I had eaten a majority of the entree. I told her that I order this entree regularly, and there was significantly less shrimp than normal. After a few minutes of going back and forth with her, I really thought I was going to lose my mind. Even the manager was talking to us in such a rude manner, instead of apologizing for our ruined meal. Eventually she cut the conversation short and asked ""So, what is it that you want me to do?"" It was obvious that my concerns meant NOTHING to her and that she just wanted to shut me up at this point. I WAS HOLDING BACK TEARS AT THIS POINT because never have I, ever, been spoken to this way, at a place I chose to give my business to. At this point, I wanted this meal from hell to be over, so I told the manager there was nothing she could do for me at this point and to please just bring our check. She did not offer any ways she could alleviate my distress or come to a solution, she just said ok and left. A few minutes later, our waitress dropped our check off at our table without saying A WORD to us. There was no ""thank you for choosing to dine with us"" or ""im sorry your meal did not turn out the way you expected"" or even ""i hope you have a great night"". SHE. DID. NOT. SAY. A. WORD. This is what sent me over the edge. They were not treating us like humans at this point, much less paying customers. I took a look at the check and saw my entree on the bill, full price. When the waitress came back, I let her know I refused to pay for my meal, so she went to get the manager again. This time another manager came out, an African American male. He was much kinder than the others.He went ahead and apologized for and took the entree off our check. As we were waiting for him to bring our new check out, our waitress stood at the bar with two other waitresses. She was loudly and profanely telling them about how I ate my food and then didn't want to pay for it. I could hardly believe it. I was being accused of being a cheap liar right in front of my face. I was literally being attacked for speaking up about the unacceptable service she gave us. When the male manager returned. I informed him of what I had just witnessed. He said he did not see it, so there wasn't much he could do. On our way out, one of the waitresses called after me ""don't go out if you can't afford it."" Needless to say, I will never be returning here."
Jeff K.,"Mount Wolf, PA",55,371,35,3.0,8/30/2015,"Just returned tonight to BJ's. They are really striking out with the root beer. This experience wasn't nearly as good as the first... THE GOOD... -seated promptly -greeted by server quickly -avocado egg rolls were still good -water refilled promptly THE BAD... -this time they had root beer, but it was FLAT! C'mon that's two strikes! -food order took awhile (server never checked-in with update) -water refills were room temperature (no ice refills) -deep dish pizza lacked sauce...I looked under the cheese and it was pretty dry -mushroom topping was cut up very small  Overall I was a bit disappointed with my second visit. You'd figure on two separate dining experiences they'd get the root beer situation under control...nope. I wouldn't order the pizza again."
Kelsey T.,"Cockeysville, MD",0,4,,2.0,3/4/2017,"I shared the Ahi Poke app, and got a salad+clam chowder bread bowl for dinner. I also got a salted caramel pizookie. I also had a caribbean mule to drink. The food and drink were pretty good, the server seemed overwhelmed/slightly inattentive(I asked for another mule 3 times and never got it so....lol oh well I guess it was for the best anyway considering what happened after...). Upon returning home, I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom with what was most likely food poisoning. Yay."
Alexis T.,"Pasadena, MD",14,11,20,3.0,6/25/2015,"Stopped in to check out the happy hour. It was different then what I found on the website, $1 off beers and cocktails, $2 off shareable appetizers and flatbreads, 1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas, and $3 for two of the beers that I can't recall. I thought the happy hour food pricing was great but I feel like the drinks could've been better like I saw on the website. My friends and I started off with a beer taster, we tried 4 beers for $7.95 and it's worth it if you're not sure what you want/like. The menu is very intensive with a lot of food and alcohol options. I really enjoyed the berry cider that they have and I would recommend that. I shared the sliders with thin fries and they were ok. The burgers were seasoned really heavily, too much for my liking.  Our server was very nice. She kept checking on us and was being very attentive.  I wouldn't mind coming back and trying a main dish."
David M.,"Baltimore, MD",14,25,1,2.0,7/16/2017,"This place is the definition of mediocre corporate dining. A huge menu of diverse items to ensure they don't do anything  good. Loud, busy, and always a weeded server."
Rebeca F.,"Pikesville, MD",50,193,1,4.0,4/25/2016,"I've visited twice and sat at the bar both times. Fairly friendly and attentive bartenders. Nice drink selection, although they are a bit expensive. Love the pizza! Check online for a coupon, they are usually pretty easy to find! Save room for a pizookie!"
Shenelle T.,"Middle River, MD",0,9,8,4.0,2/9/2017,Wings are amazing and so was the brisket burger! We went with a group of 9 and was very comfortable. They also had a party of 25 behind us. So the place is pretty spacious. I did not give it a 5 because they ran out of certain items on the menu. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.
Shanay B.,"Owings Mills, MD",97,148,25,4.0,3/26/2016,"On this beautiful Saturday, I dined with my auntie at BJ's before we headed to the movie theater. She had fish and chips and I had a wrap with fries.  Our waitress was on point , she made sure we were good, got us our drinks and just insight on the food.. I would dine here again!!"
Paul S.,"Towson, MD",84,158,69,5.0,6/28/2015,"This place has it all.  A really big menu so everyone can find something for them. The items are huge servings and have big flavor, you are garenteed to be well fed for the amount of money you put out.  A lot of premium beers for the beer connoisseur as well as lots of great tasting mocktails and sodas straight from the tap. So even the non drinker can have a fun drinking experience.  I'm a non drinker and want to try every soda and mocktail on the menu. You will love the orange cream soda, its like drinking a slightly carbonated creamsicle.. Great atmosphere, very spacious and a clear view into the kitchen.  -Super friendly wait staff and management, even the most simple of mistakes will be corrected with kindness right away. Never have to wait on additional requests, food delivery time to the table or drink refills. Even pay your check on their app to really cut down the wait time.  I've been here twice now, very little if anything to complain about, they are so kind and welcoming. The place is great for friends to hang out at and enjoy good food at drinks. This is like a Fridays, but on a much higher level of quality.  They have everything from sandwiches, steaks, tacos, pizza, etc. etc. Everyone will find something to eat.  I love how they use matchstick fries, something unique to bring to the table because I never see them anymore. As a kid I loved having a pile of matchstick fries with my burger so it was like my inner child smiled.  I plan on being a regular here, trying as much of the menu as possible. If you plan on being a regular too, download their app for advanced seating, to go orders, bill pay, and reward points for coupons and free food. Each point is equal to one dollar spent.  I think many chain restaurants could learn a thing or two from the way BJs does things.  A+ on all fronts!"
Phyllis C.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,2.0,7/11/2017,"The service is not the best.  My family and I had to wait for 5 minutes before someone came over to take our drink orders. Oh, and that person was just walking by and noticed we had been there a while without being greeted. We never found out who our server actually was. The food was just ok.  I ordered the salmon with asparagus.  Substituted the the couscous for the mashes potatoes and everything I had tasted like it had way too much salt and pepper.  The only reason I gave it two stars was because we had a coupon for BOGO free."
