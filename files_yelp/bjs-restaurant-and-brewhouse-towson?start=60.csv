Nicole S.,"Laurel, MD",0,2,,2.0,5/5/2017,"If you come in and get the right bartender, you're in luck. This is one of the few chains that I like, and frankly, coming when it's busy isn't worth it. Connor and Danielle are wonderful and the reason I would come back, and his female counterpart Ashley is the reason that some people shouldn't be bartenders. She is rude, presumptive, lazy, haughty, and genuinely can't be bothered with you. She will not offer her services because she's too busy counting her money in front of you, clear your plates or glasses, or attempt to be hospitable. Save your time, money and efforts. If you sit at the bar and have anyone other than Connor or Danielle- just leave."
Jackie D.,"Catonsville, MD",27,42,73,4.0,3/19/2016,"Sat at the bar on a weeknight.  Cocktails were meh, but it IS a brewhouse.  Flatbread and lettuce wraps were A+.  Pizookie was a little sweet, but enjoyable.  Looking forward to a return visit."
Nicole T.,"Tacoma, WA",41,134,273,4.0,1/30/2016,"Nice atmosphere would prefer to visit without the kiddos but it was a good experience. We initially if a 40 minute wait and about 20 mins into the wait we were told that it was seat yourself at the bar. So my family of four sat down after confirming with a waitress that it was indeed seat yourself only to find out after our assigned waitress told us that inly applies to the actual bar and hi-top tables.  was my initial reaction and we profusely apologized however she was nice enough to say it was ok. I think we spent the entire night apologizing. We placed out order....entrees mahi-mahi tacos, bacon burger with fries, sirloin steak with mash and roasted Brussels sprouts and chicken tenders and fries. Food was out fairly fast and it was ok. I had to send my steak back because it was more on the medium side then medium well. Overall the food was good and we will most likely revisit without the kids!!!"
Neal A.,"Baltimore, MD",162,77,227,4.0,1/25/2016,"BJ's has always been a personal favorite for a quickly thrown together happy hour, a late night drink, or a business luncheon. Well, after I left the West coast I though for sure I'd seen my last BJ's for awhile. Low a behold! Here I find myself in Towson enjoying a delicious Tatonka Stout and digging into one of my favorite Mediterranean pizza.  The staff here was entertaining, polite, and attentive despite being swapped with patrons. The food as always was delicious and I had the opportunity to taste the Grilled Chicken Taco from the healthier menus which was surprisingly filling and super flavorful."
C S.,"Baltimore, MD",13,21,16,3.0,2/12/2016,"Beer, Brussels sprouts & service...great, meal...NO!  It was great to get here and not have a wait...so great.  When we arrived, we got a good seat at a booth. Although the hostess seemed to not want to be there, our waitress was phenomenal in her service.   We ordered drinks and I wanted a certain thing they didn't have and she gave me suggestions on how to get what I want without ordering it in the way I thought I needed to.  The beers were great...which would have made this 4 stars yet the food was not on point.   The food was not great.  My friend and I ordered salmon. I ordered a glazed salmon and they ordered a blackened salmon. The glazed salmon was very sweet yet cooked correctly. The blackened salmon was over cooked and drive as we needed to use a fork and knife to cut it. The broccoli was just steamed with no seasoning.  The rice was good yet probably due to the large amounts of salt used. The good thing is that our waitress talked to the manager and the cute manager stopped by and replaced the order completely. Btw, the staff in the restaurant seem to be put together and semi good looking to good looking."
Leándra C.,"Columbus, OH",48,4,4,5.0,8/23/2016,"My food was good, my drinks were excellently  prepared, but I had the most awesome experience because of the bartender Paul. I made a suggestion about how he could improve a specific processes in his service. And his response to me was ""thank you for telling me that, because I can always do better"" OMG! How refreshing! I was completely amazed and left with a smile on my face. Thank you for being so awesome Paul."
Bruce K.,"Baltimore, MD",12,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"If there was a zero.... The bartender accidentally dropped a carafe of wine on bar ..glass broke.. Covered my wife's face and clothing and ... You think after broken glass they would have offered to replace our food?! To add insult to injury .. A different bartender . Asked if all way okay.. My wife said my clothes are soaked with wine... And now I have to take a shower.. The bartenders response... Wait for it.. Was to say ""that's what you get for being a lush""..I'm sure that bartender has a future in stand-up comedy.. Or table waiting  Oh well.. We did not pay for that glass of wine.. Spoke to manager who seemed to not really care.. Did not offer a thing other than an 'Oh wow' We can tolerate an accident; but not the lack of concern. If you like a bartender that spills wine in your face..and an apothetic manager.. This is your place Plus..so kid friendly .. They let kids play with toy cars in the bar"
Ryan C.,"Vernon, CT",0,2,,1.0,3/6/2017,"Service was slow and then I was given dirty silverware.  When i asked for new silverware I was told I had to wait for it to come out of the dish washer.  My chicken sandwich came out burnt to a crisp, even the bread was burnt.  I sent it back and the new sandwich was good but the whole experience was awful.  The bartender was nice so I tipped her well but the kitchen needs to get it together for sure.  I won't be returning.  If I want bad service and burnt food I'll just have my friend invite me over for dinner again!"
Kasey D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,14,26,3.0,9/4/2016,"The atmosphere is very nice I'll give them that.The menu is confusing when your ordering lunch on the weekends, small portions and over priced. Service was a bit slow and they weren't even busy. I gave them three stars because it is very clean place and the food was pretty good it not great."
Stepheny S.,"Baltimore, MD",54,16,10,5.0,10/2/2016,"This was a shocker... didn't have any expectations besides it was food to eat! So after a long Sunday I had no interest in cooking. Pick this place only because the Japanese place next door was closed for some reason so instead of getting back in the car said why not lol so I had a top sirloin and asparagus... when I food came out I asked the waiter (who was sweet, very good at his job and eager to please) for a1 because shitty steak needs a1. I have to say I ate the whole steak without one drop of it. My husband had a full rack of ribs and were just as good as my steak. I would recommend to everyone. I am truly pleased"
Kenneth G.,"Baltimore, MD",165,2,,4.0,8/29/2016,Pretty deep and extensive menu. I came at night so wasn't manny puerile surprisingly. Loved the food and service. Good place food friends to gather and drinks could be a little better or stronger.
Tierra W.,"Gwynn Oak, Gwynn Oak, MD",0,1,,1.0,3/22/2017,Horrible service. My partner and I went in to sit at the bar for dinner. After waiting a while (too long) and watching a Caucasian couple come in after us given menus and drinks still received no service.
Brandon L.,"Parkville, MD",30,89,195,4.0,11/20/2015,"I have come here twice so far, and have gotten the deep dish pizza and haven't been disappointed at all. I don't do the ""gluten-free"" food thing, but did try a piece of someone's gluten free pizza and it tasted like a really good thin pizza. So, if you're looking for gluten free food, the pizza wasn't that bad. The inside of the restaurant itself is pretty nice, and the bar area is also decent with a bunch of HDTV's around the whole bar area. They have all kinds of beers you can choose from as well, so if you're a beer drinker, you might want to try this place out. Their desserts are also pretty good. They are called Pazooki's, and I have tried a couple of them. I recommend getting the mini ones where you can choose 3 of the different flavors.  I will definitely be back."
Chuck D.,"Reisterstown, MD",8,48,,3.0,3/11/2017,"Went for a late lunch, party of five. Servers were friendly but very slow. The food was good. Boneless wings, potatoe skins, shrimp taco, buffalo chicken pizza, cauliflower taco, salmon taco were all very good. Beer selection is great. If the service was better, it would have been a great visit."
Kerri M.,"Baltimore, MD",42,160,13,1.0,6/24/2015,"I was going to give this place, two stars but reconsidered because it was really that bad of an experience. The only good thing this place has going for it is the beer selection. I guess the service from the wait staff was also acceptable, but still not enough to give this place two stars. Open, airy space. Got a Chilis vibe going on. Multiple TV's.  Menu is rather large and too extensive, which is probably part of the problem. Menu is also kind of boring. Nothing really special or eye catching. Typical stuff like burgers, salad, sandwiches, pizza, etc. Started off with the potato skins as an appetizer. Boy were they bland. Tasteless. My partner ordered the black & bleu burger and he could not finish it because it was so bland. The fries that came with the burger were of the shoestring variety. They also lacked salt.  I ordered the Kale & Brussel sprout salad with chicken. It was awful. It was a super soggy mess and I could not finish it. Why was it so soggy and floppy? The dressing that it had been soaking in was not good either - strawberry vinaigrette. Didn't really taste of much other than vinegar. The salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it, but it definitely had bleu cheese in it. Bleh.  This is just a generic place trying too hard not to be generic by charging a lot for their plain food.  Really regret coming here and will not return."
D M.,"Baltimore County, MD",3,56,104,3.0,1/31/2016,The Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with the side of grains was good. Light and filling. Blood Orange Pom Sangria had cinnamon whisky and a cinnamon stick in it. Didn't think the cinnamon worked...for a sangria. Service was fine. Bathrooms clean.
Todd D.,"Towson, MD",0,8,,2.0,7/12/2015,"This place was pretty bad.  On par with crappy bar chains but worse.  Five words to describe the food:  Generic, soggy, greasy, processed, bland.  Sandwiches were over-salted to hide the fact that they had no flavor.  Everything was soggy from the grease.  The salads were a mess, covered in wayyy too much gross dressing. The appetizers were mushy and greasy - the avocado spring roll thing is terrible.  Drinks were watered down and really sugary. The only reason for two stars - service was fine and the beer selection was pretty good.  They did some cool ""layering"" with their beers.  Aside from that, I would strongly avoid this place.  Their menu is so expansive that instead of making 15-20 quality items, they have 200+ terrible items."
Kiersten L.,"Hawthorne, NY",83,107,53,4.0,10/4/2015,"Came here for the first time with my parents and it was delicious! Their menu is huge, and a bulk of it is drinks- so if you like beer and margaritas definitely go. I had the Santa Fe Salad, and my parents had the chicken pesto sandwich. We both enjoyed our entrees very much. The service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was cool and modern. Highly recommend!"
Kevin M.,"Baltimore, MD",163,288,68,3.0,6/18/2015,"Came in for the opening day which was my second time after the soft opening and to be quite honest it lacked a lot. While the decor and building itself has very good architecture and the fire place outside is an eye catcher. The food defiantly leaves you dissatisfied. The food was similar to that of a Chilis or a tgi Friday's with the exception of an incredible beer menu. I did try the banana beer which was tasty.  The country fried chicken with gravy was truly an embarrassment, being from the south I know what country fried chicken is supposed to be like. The chicken was extremely dry and sadly placed upon a mediocre pile of less then desirable mashed potatoes and the dish was decorated with corn kernels as if it was a decoration not a side. The gravy was thick and lacked flavor. The avocado egg rolls were the worse. The sauces did not accompany the appetizer well and tasted very similar. They were not crispy and were soggy in less then a few minutes. No one at the table was satisfied with them.  My friend ordered the flatbread and salad and he was not that impressed either For dessert we shared the pazookie which is a cookie with ice cream which was expressed to be the best dessert and in reality all it is, is a big cookie overly sweet and soft almost undercooked with store bought ice cream on top with some kind of drizzle depending upon what you order... Defiantly seems like a lower end restaurant presenting itself as upscale. With a clientel base of college students and late night drinkers. personally have no desire to return in the near future.  With all that said the staff was very friendly and seemed to be learning very well about the menu."
Jonathan P.,"Cockeysville, MD",100,91,82,5.0,6/18/2015,I am throughly impressed by this place!  BJ's just opened a few days ago. They have a great atmosphere and ambience. The service is really good. Our waiter was very attentive and super helpful in recommending dishes. The food was amazing. I had the jambalaya. The rice and shrimp were cooked perfectly and the dish overall had great flavor. My wife had a burger with fries which was really good as well. We couldn't stop eating the fries (lol) and the burger was juicy with great flavor.  There is a huge selection of beer. We had the Nit Nat(I think that's the name) which was good. Desert was amazing. We had the macadamia nut white chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. We don't usually have desert but maaaaaaaan this desert was da BOMB!!! Lol. We will definitely be back!
