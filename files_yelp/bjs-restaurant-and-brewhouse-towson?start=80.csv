Elizabeth J.,"Baltimore, MD",178,252,104,3.0,4/25/2016,"We stopped in to grab a beer and a snack before our movie. Nothing special, but it did the trick. Great selection of beer, but the bar tender was moving a little slow and not familiar with the menu. Nothing to write home about, but good enough for a pre-show brew."
Kevin J.,"Evesham Township, NJ",39,207,11,4.0,6/29/2015,"I had a great experience at BJ's on Sunday night.  Beer- I tried the hefferveisen and my wife got the stout. We both liked the beers. The stout was better and had a unique taste. The hefferviesen was not heavy enough for my liking, but it was still good. Not enough heff! The price point at $5.75 a beer is a little steep. I heard they have a happy hour. I will come back one night and sample more of their brews during that time.  Food- The food was excellent. Their menu is huge, maybe too huge. I had a double burger and my wife had some kind of chicken sandwich. Both were great, had flavor, large proportions and were reasonably priced. Their thinly cut French fries are awesome! I saw a couple deep dish pizza's around them room. They looked good. Atmosphere- Nothing crazy to report home about. It was clean, new, and spacious. Looked like there was plenty of space at the bar and adequate seating.  Service- Top notch! Attentive hostesses and wait staff.  Other- They have a decent rewards program I signed up for. Check it out at their website before they go. Apparently you can pay via app. I did't do this, but that seems new and high tech.   There are now a ton of good restaurants in that square there by the movie theater. This is one of the better ones. I will be back!"
Robert B.,"Towson, MD",1,21,,2.0,7/30/2016,"Serviceable but not much more. Table service was good. Nice clean bathroom. Hostess seemed like she was attached to an unreliable motion detector -- she was staring at nothing when we came in, then eventually noticed we were there and flipped to the ""on"" position. It's a bar and grill, so we got burgers, the hickory brisket burger and sliders. The burger was ordered medium and definitely wasn't -- I have no idea why restaurants incapable of cooking to order bother to ask. The sliders were *very* greasy. The shoestring fries were good, nice and crispy. Not the worst I've had by any means, but there's not really much reason to return."
Allison T.,"Rosedale, MD",34,5,2,4.0,7/21/2016,"We came in relatively late, and sat around waiting for the rest of our party which is really annoying to servers, but Elisse (sorry is spelling isn't correct) was a breath of fresh air. Very pleasant and wonderful. We will be coming back for her and your awesome rewards program. Oh and of course the pizookies!"
Irene A.,"Ocean City, MD",14,4,,4.0,1/15/2017,Food was good. I had the grilled chicken breast which was cooked nice. My son had the kids burger which he did not like because he did not like the flavor. The wings were delicious and so was everything else. I would like to come again.
Austin W.,"Manchester, CT",1,41,13,3.0,5/19/2016,"The pizza isn't anything special. The dough has so much air in it, making it so fluffy, that they barely put any toppings on it but it still gives the illusion that you're eating a lot of pizza. I might as well have been eating just bread. On the plus side it's not a very greasy pizza so you don't have to worry about pools of oil on the pizza."
Keisha C.,"Baltimore, MD",34,25,119,3.0,7/23/2015,"Don't usually like chain restaurants but they places was pretty good. The large bar area was clean, invited and large. I like that they have outdoor seating available, which is a nice benefit for warm weather months. The vast menu allowed for great food options to choose from. Service was attentive. The only negative is that the entrees are pretty pricey for a chain restaurant."
Vincent D.,"Towson, MD",25,88,284,2.0,4/10/2016,Came here on a week night. Place had about 8 tables occupied and some patrons at the bar.  Not a busy night. The place was nice. Our waitress was nice and the food was ok. However... I saw some people (at different times) waiting (some left) at the entrance because there was no one there to seat them. Some customers left without ordering- I guess no one was paying them attention. The guy who brought us our food just turned around and walked away- while my friend was still talking asking for ketchup. This place could be better.
Emily B.,"Towson, MD",35,10,,3.0,4/23/2016,Went for dinner last night and had a big comfy booth for just the two of us. We sat for about 10-15 minutes before our waitress realized we were there. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was hot. Ingredients seemed fresh and food was very good. Service was incredibly slow and we were never given utensils. We had to find another server to bring napkins since ours was MIA so often. Staff all looked miserable and were slow but the food was good. Probably won't go back again for a meal.
Valerie N.,"Parkville, MD",0,36,,3.0,8/16/2015,"I continue to have a great experience here, and it's been my third time dining at BJ's.  They have a great beer selection, the bar tenders are good-natured, and the food is delicious.  They also have a neat happy hour from 3-6 on weekdays and also during aired football games.  They offer discounted appetizers, pizzas, and drinks on their happy hour. Overall a really cool place, making it one of our go-to restaurants in the area.  I'd recommend their deep dish pizzas and Hefeweizen beer.  It's a delicious combo! Edit:  since my original review, their happy hour has turned into just a dollar off of their drafts.  Also, the food comes out extremely slowly and there has been many mistakes with orders.  I have tried contacting management to bring this to their attention, but no response.  It's a shame that I felt the need to adjust the rating from a 5 to a 3."
Sarah G.,"Arlington, VA",220,336,92,4.0,1/25/2016,"Bar only review! A friend and I came in here to kill some time before a movie at the Cinemark a block away. It was a perfect spot for that, and despite large Saturday night crowds, we found some spots at the bar. Our bartender was right with us with  menus and giving us the specials. They had drink specials for the games that were playing on the numerous TVs. I ended up ordering a berry beer which I thought was a cider since it was listed under ""Cider & Fruit Beers"" but my eyes only read Cider lol. Surprisingly (even though I really don't like beer) this was super tasty! Probably because it tasted nothing like beer, but more like a fruit wine spritzer aka super girly but I don't care! It was really refreshing and easy to drink. Our bartender even gave me a shot's worth of the Berry Burst Cider which they have an option to mix with the Belgian fruit beer I was drinking. Very tasty together! It's a great spot that I'd love to try out in the future because the food that was coming out around us looked really good too. Plus with other locations closer to my work, it shouldn't be too hard to find the time!"
Michel D.,"Gunpowder, MD",0,3,,4.0,10/16/2016,"We arrived around 5:00 PM on a Sunday. Admittedly not a real busy time of the week for a restaurant. The wait staff was courteous and attentive. We ordered two pizzas, bacon with chicken and a Mediterranean, and a BBQ bison burger. The food was good and well presented. My only complaint was the beer. While they have a large selection of beer on tap, all the beer is kept at about 37 degrees Fahrenheit. This is fine for most lagers and ales but is too cold for porters and stouts, the finish tends to be bitter unless porters and stouts are kept at about 50 degrees. A bit disappointing since I'm a fan of dark beers."
Geo F.,"Gwynn Oak, Gwynn Oak, MD",0,1,,1.0,5/13/2017,"Left a movie, and walked in to BJ's and a young lady who was a hostess told me that a young man who had started to walk away would be with me to place my carry out order. She then called him while he ran to the kitchen and asked him to take my order when he came back. When he came back almost ten minutes later, he had his jacket on and back pack, ready to go out the door. Before he left, he was ""kind"" enough to tell me, while walking back into the carry out booth, that I should place my order at the bar. This was around 10:30 this evening of May 13th. There were two girls and this guy I spoke to on tonight's shift. Sad.....because we went somewhere else and the restaurant lost business only because of a young guy that was rude and thought he was being slick. Took us for being stupid making us wait while he got his jacket and backpack to make his exit. Get some customer service training and if you don't know how to act like an adult in the service business, go do something else."
Jalina M.,"Baltimore, MD",3,4,,2.0,4/7/2016,"This was my first visit to this restaurant and my husbands second. He advised against this restaurant due to his lackluster food on his initial visit. I thought maybe they were having an off day and his pizza wasn't delicious that one time and another shot should be given. Boy was I wrong!  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Our waitress was between rude and slightly nice? She was not excited at all and her demeanor was as if she had better things to be doing instead of being a polite server. We also noticed there were cliques of employees and lots of standing around doing nothing, this isn't optimal behavior at a restaurant. Now on to the food, the root beer wings were really good. The deep dish pizza was not- tasteless and no sauce to speak of, crust was buttery and greasy and the waitress wasn't surprised I said something about the lack of sauce she just brought out a cup of marinara sauce... I'm sad to say that we didn't even order dessert because I didn't want to be disappointed with that. Also I'd like to add I was disappointed by the response to the no sauce on the pizza, she didn't even inquire if we wanted a new pizza made, she just brought the sauce which was tacky in my opinion. I also think with a complaint like that, a manager should've been notified to inquire how the experience can be upgraded to encourage another visit. So maybe this review will help you to determine if this the place to go for your next dining out experience, I'm not saying I'll never go back but I hope that they get better service and food before I do. If I could sum up the experience, I'd call it bad service with a smile..."
Mimi A.,"Riverdale Park, MD",91,4,1,5.0,3/6/2016,"So this week was one of my best friends' birthday and as a last minute thing after going empire his kids to Port Discovery, I told him I wanted to get something to eat/take him out to eat for his bday.  As a last minute thing, he suggested horseshoe casino m, because they have good food there.  I told him I DID NOT want burgers, that I wanted real dinner-type food.  So first place we checked out was the steakhouse on the bottom floor.  The menu looked great, but my friend didn't seem like he was feeling it, because it was a little too stuffy for him.  He really seemed interested in going to Guy Fieri's place, so I said ""OK let's go check out the menu.""  From the second that we walked up there, he was hooked just by the friendliness of the hostesses, of course, I still had to check out the menu. I ended up seeing that they had more than just burgers and agreed that it'd be a cool place to eat.  Our server was Monique, a super friendly, super knowledgeable waitress who gave us great service! Then, at some point, the restaurant manager came by to stop by and say hello, which seems to be standard these days, but my friend happen to know her so that made the experience even cooler, but what I was really blown away by was that towards the end of our meal, the general manager came by to say hi and see how things were going, asked if we needed anything, to which I replied, ""yes, everything is GREAT, but if I could get a to-go ramekin for this sauce I'd really appreciate it.""  She tells me, ""sure, of course!"" and then proceeds to buss our table!!!  Let me repeat that, the general manager bussed our table!!  Not only that, but she brought back good to-go ramekins herself and didn't send someone to bring them to me!  I got some Hawaiian chicken bbq dish that I wasn't blown away by, but my friend LOVED his burger and I would DEFINITELY, 100% come back to this place for the experience that you get starting at the front door and beyond!  There was another guy who kept coming by our table and I don't know what his position was there, but he was also super friendly and funny.  Definitely check out this place, especially if you're someone who appreciates great service!!!"
Jessica D.,"Atlanta, GA",270,215,187,4.0,11/16/2015,I've been here a few times. For the most part the food is decent nothing to be excited about. Although being from Atlanta I was happy to find lemon pepper wings on the menu. The one thing I would say on the menu that is worth getting excited about it the pazzoki. My mouth waters just thinking about it and they have a couple different flavors. I've had the macadamia nut as well as the salted caramel both absolutely amazing. I tend to sit at the bar when I come. The service is usually pretty good although if it gets busy they tend to forget about you. There is one bartender she usually works during the day from what I see but she has a thick southern accent and she's always very sweet if you ever get the pleasure. I recommend coming on Tuesdays they have half off wine glasses and bottles which I can't resist especially since I'm not a fan of beer. During happy hour they have beer specials and $2 off apps. BJs is always cool for a quick bite before a movie so check them out.
Courtney S.,"Davidsonville, MD",41,41,49,5.0,2/16/2016,"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants and I'm thrilled to see its in Towson now! There are very few places around here that you can get a decent deep dish pizza, so now that BJ's is here you'll never have to resist your deep dish cravings anymore. And if you love dessert? Their pizookie (my favorite is the peanut butter s'mores) will make you come back in a heartbeat. Check it out, I highly recommend it!"
Erika H.,"Columbia, MD",77,39,45,3.0,3/29/2016,Normally love BJ's but don't go there on a weekday at night. We waited 5 minutes or more at the hostess desk before we were even acknowledged. Then we were seated and sat there 15 more minutes without anyone ever coming over to even take drink orders. There were a good amount of people there and more coming in so you'd think they'd make sure everyone was taken care of but all the staff seemed to be totally uninterested and moving too slow. So we left.
Kate R.,"Cockeysville, MD",10,4,,5.0,10/2/2015,"We don't go out to eat often so it's always a bummer when we have a disappointing experience. Such was not the case AT ALL with BJ's. We couldn't have been more thrilled. In fact, I think we were in a better mood when we left than we were when we got there! The food is pretty much what you would expect if you're looking for pub-type fare but I couldn't believe the options. It wasn't just burgers and wings, there were so many interesting things on the menu. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which was delicious. I love that they have an ""EnLIGHTened"" portion of their menu.  The food was good but the staff was incredible. We ordered a pitcher of beer and realized pretty soon that the waitress brought us the wrong beer. We let her know and she apologized and told us to just finish the pitcher we had and that she would bring a new one with the beer that we ordered at no extra cost to us. That was pretty much all my boyfriend needed to hear. It was a simple gesture but it goes a long way in terms of customer service. She was quick, attentive but not TOO attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. It wasn't just her though, the hostess was great and every single staff member that we encountered was friendly and just GOOD at their job. We even called the manager over to let her know how impressed we were. We were there once before but just had drinks at the bar and the bartender was SO friendly and engaging. She overheard us talking about movies and ended up talking movies with us for the next ten minutes which was so fun. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible beer selection.  Often times when you go out to eat, if a waiter or waitress isn't assigned to a table then they don't want to help that table and I get that. They work on tips and every second counts so I wouldn't hold that against anyone. But it seems like the staff at BJ's is trained to treat every single customer well regardless of whether or not they'll be tipped by that customer. It's rare and it's truly impressive.  I hope the place sticks around for a long time and I hope that a lot of people have the amazing experience that my boyfriend and I had. I really can't wait to go back."
Cassandra R.,"Baltimore, MD",38,11,72,3.0,10/22/2015,"Nice new bar near the mall and moive theater. Great for watching sports because they've got these HUGE HD flat screens long the perimiter of the bar. I only went for drinks so I can't speak on the food. I ordered a drink called ""A Drink Like That""....its probably one of the strongest drinks b/c it's got 151 in it. Very Tasty....like a firecracker ice cream pop in a drink. I had two and was done for the night. Cool vibes."
