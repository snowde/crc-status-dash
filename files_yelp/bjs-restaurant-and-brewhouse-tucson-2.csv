Ashley B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,14,2,5.0,12/22/2017,"Fish and chips are prepared well, and consistently. I've never had an issue with the quality of the fish, or on the preparation. For the most part,  servers know the menu and are attentive without being annoying."
Diane P.,"Tucson, AZ",5,13,28,1.0,10/24/2017,"I would seriously give the Broadway location a zero if it was possible! We had the worst service and food on a Monday at lunch with friends. The server had no clue that dirty dishes should be cleared when refills of salad and soup were delivered, the glasses of soda were intentionally left at the end of the table and refills were ignored....service was slow and she only had one other table of 5 in our area. If she had other tables on the other side of the restaurant, that is just plain mismanagement. The waitress was annoying on the verge of rude, she corrected my husband several times when he asked questions and had an unpleasant attitude. A few members of our party asked to make slight changes to their orders, apparently that makes their handheld ordering system upset. She seemed very perturbed that she had to go to the kitchen to correct it. If it causes that much of an issue...maybe it's not the right system. If she thought she was being funny or making jokes, she missed the mark.  We called and had a chat with the floor manager later in the afternoon. We told him about the bad service and the unsatisfactory food. He did admit that all of the soups are very thick and for the most part, spicy. Not much chicken could be found in the the chicken tortilla soup and the chili was mostly beans. He also apologized for the lackluster service and offered a gift card. We went to retrieve the gift card, to use it at the other location on North Oracle (our favorite location.)  When we arrived the next day, 3 very nosy hostesses all wanted to know what was going on when we asked for the gift card. The floor manager was busy and kept us waiting over 15 minutes. The manager finally arrived and was able to open the office door (the floor manager had locked her keys in the office) and get the gift card for us.  North Oracle has a better management style. We have never had an issue there....it's worth the drive."
Jamie Y.,"Tucson, AZ",49,58,25,5.0,9/24/2017,"Came to BJs for a friend's birthday with a group of 6.  The menu selection is phenomenal and so is the beer!  Tommy was our waiter and he recommended for me to try the Sonoran White Chocolate beer and their Amber. Both were delicious! And Tommy was a great waiter. We ended up calling him Big-T!  Our group was filled with laughter and probably a little noisy. But it was Sunday night football and not very crowded after we arrived.  We got a bunch of appetizers and one giant, deep dish pizza with pepperoni and bacon. Avocado egg rolls, mozzarella sticks, wings, spinach-artichoke dip, and pot stickers. Others also got some soup, tacos, and chili. We were all stuffed. We wanted to make it to dessert but we didn't haha."
Alex C.,"Tucson, AZ",38,112,89,1.0,12/18/2017,"I honestly don't understand the big attraction of this place. Maybe it's the meat or the sports games playing on big TVs? Neither things appeal to me. They have a novel of a menu and only one item clearly marked vegan, which came in a bread bowl with the top heavily buttered. My friend got a steak well done but it was pretty pink. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was so super oily it felt like taking a half shot of oil in every bite. The sweet potato fries were barely lukewarm when they arrived. The beer selection was subpar. They did have Dragoon IPA thankfully. Honestly if you want a place like this the Yard House is a few minutes away with awesome vegan options and an amazing assortment of beer. Sadly, the work Christmas party picked this place. On the upside, my food was free! Even free food though will not have me coming back."
Nessa P.,"Tucson, AZ",75,109,22,4.0,9/6/2017,"My girl love pizzookies.  She was having a bad day so we got impromptu dinner in Labor Day.  The place was packed, but we were seated within five minutes.  They had a great special going on where you got half off a large pizza.  We saved $12 bucks. Our server was great!  She was on it.  Apologized if she was a little long between visits. Had drinks refilled.  Made sure we were good.   The pizza was just what we wanted.  We got BJs favorite.  We had enough for lunch the next day and then some.  We would have appreciated the leftovers boxed up for us since we were at a small booth.  I heard other servers offer it.  Would have made this review a 5. We had the cookies and cream pizzokie.  It was dang delicious.  Warm chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream.  The real reason we came to BJs.  We weren't disappointed."
Sara C.,"Atlanta, GA",131,118,141,4.0,6/19/2017,Fun sports bar atmosphere that's good for the family . For the table we ordered lettuce wraps they were good but P.F. Chang's  still has the best . Luckily my dad warned us about one of the sauces it's basically like sticking a huge amount of wasabi in your mouth I dabbed my fork in it to taste oh woah! It's good but wil clear your sinus. Everyday they have different specials we came it was half off pizza deep dish or tavern cut my mother and I split a tavern cut which was sooood good and more than enough food for both of us. I also got a house salad which was yummy . My dad ordered soup bread bowl I tasted a piece and had a nice garlic flavor . From the food to service great lunch with my parents !
Kevin L.,"Tucson, AZ",6,80,2,5.0,12/12/2017,"I had a large catering order for a company party and I was very impressed with the way the Saturday (Dec 9th) team handled it. A few days prior to that, I was given some confusing information so I was a bit worried about how things might turn out. The morning manager that day was very knowledgeable and got my order in quickly and reassured me that the order will be processed correctly. On pick up, the two gentlemen at the carryout station (Edgar and another friendly guy) were nice, professional, and very efficient. They showed what teamwork and leadership is all about. They also helped me carry many items to my car. Above all, this is in the midst of a very busy Saturday night. Props!"
Amanda B.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",74,53,104,4.0,7/8/2017,"Service was very good. The food was also very good. This is my first time to one of these and I was surprised at how diverse the menu is. You can find anything you are hungry for on this menu. I didn't particularly like the avocado egg rolls but I think that's preference. They were cooked well. They just didn't make sense to my palate. I also didn't care for the sauce and I didn't feel it matched the egg rolls. Other than that, the food and beer was good and our waitress was great."
James M.,"Tucson, AZ",228,78,66,4.0,7/6/2017,"I went to BJ's for lunch today with my brother. We were surprised at how big the menu was and how extensive the beer selections were at the bar. Since it was a little early to have a beer I will only give a review of the food. We each have something different I had your brand-new chicken sandwich that was being served for the first time  today and my brother had three choice selective vegetarian plate.  Since I can't eat certain foods and  certain type of condiments, I had to make some slight changes to this chicken sandwich which they had no problem with making a change. Instead of french fries I had fruit and instead of Dijon mayonnaise I just had plain Dijon mustard. My brothers three courses were couscous, carrots in garlic butter and sweet potato fries. Both were delicious and I highly recommend their food. We will be going back at night with Kathy and sampling their beers and looking at the rest of their menu to decide what other great food items we should have to eat. I noticed that they had a Irish red ale that was beer brewed on site there is one of my favorite types of ale."
Ben H.,"Tucson, AZ",207,70,239,4.0,6/8/2017,There are a few times that a meal at a restaurant stands up and gives you the satisfaction of going out to eat. Tonight's pork chop was nothing short of perfection. The pork chop was excellently prepared and served to delight
Brian D.,"Tucson, AZ",14,42,137,4.0,6/16/2017,"We arrive 4:30 pm. Was greet and seated.  Waiter came and took our orders,food came right on time. No long wait......m Friday night and our water refills kept been refills.  Good server! Food was good,had hamburger with brisket bbq. My wife had taco salmon. Download there app and it is much easy. All smiles..... Have not been to restroom, would be five stars?  Keep be merry and have a good day!"
Nikky P.,"Glendale, AZ",210,291,287,4.0,3/17/2017,"On my las visit I had a pick up order. Thy are usually amazing at checking the order piece by piece, which the  woman did. After I left I got a phone call from the girl who had put my order together apologizing profusely that she had missed one item. I was taking the food to a business meeting and had to come back to the restaurant to get the missing food which was honestly very annoying since it cut into my time for the scheduled meeting. When I arrive, she had complimentary desert, as well as the missing item. I asked if they would be willing to provide a gift card for my inconvenience. The girl got the manger and the honored the gift card. I really had no intention of getting anyone in trouble, and I still think this location is great. I was very impressed but their customer service and willingness to accommodate my request for the gift card. Thank you"
Trisdon M.,"Tucson, AZ",45,138,348,2.0,4/12/2017,"Not the best BJs I've been to I'm afraid... The bartender was very friendly as was the host staff but the food was beyond subpar. I ordered my usual BJs entrée, the Salmon Quinoa bowl, and it was incredibly bland and dry as a bone. I had to ask for a side of sauce to help me get it down. Truthfully the driest piece of fish I've had to date. I would've sent it back but I already had to send back one of my drinks. I ordered ""sangria"" without reading the menu and noting that they put fireball and cinnamon stick in theirs' (not a cinnamon fan at all). The bartender was very understanding and I ordered a replacement drink which wasn't great, but it was drinkable.  We finished the meal with a monkey bread pizookie (it was Tuesday so $3 pizookie night) and it was also dry and overcooked. Between the two of us we maybe got half of it down... Honestly the worst experience I've had at a BJs, which happens to be one of my favorite chains. The staff is great but I'd suggest additional training behind the bar and definitely in the kitchen. They seem to have a tendancy to overcook things... 2 stars."
Christine B.,"El Paso, TX",11,180,217,3.0,3/29/2017,"BJ's is known for their numerous beers and all their TVs around the restaurant. I've heard they take reservations, but every time I meet up with a larger party with ""reservations,"" it still takes a bit of time to get seated.  I always prefer to sit in the bar area as it is open seating and service is usually faster. The menu seems to change on a regular basis, but on several occasions, I have been able to order simple items off-menu. If you can make it there for happy hour, the prices aren't too bad. There are actually decent food and drink items offered on HH that make it worth your while."
Barbara E.,"Tucson, AZ",13,57,58,4.0,12/13/2016,"It's been a while since I've been here.  Sat at the bar for happy hour and I asked the bartender what she recommended based on beers that I like and she recommended the Oasis Amber.  It tasted a tad bit lighter than your average amber beer but it was really good.. Very crisp tasting. I ordered the chicken wings and calamari.  The calamari was a lil bland but it was a decent amount. The wings were tasty and the ranch wasn't watery like other places I've been too, thank goodness.. Prices are very reasonable for happy hour and the service was pretty good.  We'll be back."
Pamela C.,"Tucson, AZ",3,22,61,3.0,10/27/2016,"Used to come here more often but hadn't been back in a while. We decided to dine here the other night and I was swiftly reminded why I am not really a big fan of this place. Very nice setting, modern feel, plenty of HDTV's, plenty of space yet, somehow everything feels so impersonal. Its seems like the restaurant is run so corporate, that the entire dinning experience is made to feel somewhat robotic. Cant quite put my finger on it. Even though you are greeted promptly, brought to your table with friendly gestures, and given a fair bit of attention by the servers... I never really felt like any of it was particularly sincere. Seems like everyone there is just in it for the money. I know that EVERYONE who currently holds a job is essentially ""just in it for the money"" however, when this particular ambience bleeds into the food.... we have a problem.  In my opinion the entire place feels like it has no soul, particularly the food. I'm always left feeling like I paid too much for something I did not enjoy and I hate that. Should have gone to Texas Roadhouse that night."
Tammy S.,"Tucson, AZ",4,7,2,5.0,9/15/2017,"Amazing service and delicious food. Our waitress, Jade, was spectacular. We asked for a recommendation and, yep, her suggestion of the BBQ brisket burger was spot on. We shared the burger and left full and happy. Personally, we think BJ's has the Tucson Red Robin beat. We will be returning for more of the same soon."
Heidi H.,"Green Valley, AZ",0,7,,5.0,8/27/2017,"We stopped here for dinner before going to Down The Rabbit Hole which is down the street. I cannot wait to come back. Service was great, very friendly from the hostess at the front door to our waiter. Daniel, our waiter was awesome. He brought us samples of the beer and flavors of soda they make in house. We were running late for The Rabbit Hole and he was very accommodating, just friendly service. The food was delicious. Menu was huge, as I said I'm looking forward to going back and trying other things."
Bob B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,52,,2.0,9/6/2017,"This experience may have been affected by our late arrival, about 9 pm. While everything had good flavor, nothing was at serving temperature. I have always found their clam chowder to be very good, but this night it was barely lukewarm, and a half serving compared to past visits. We ordered an appetizer mixed platter, and all were cold or barely lukewarm. The waitperson never came back to complete our order, though we had enough with the appetizer platter. Soup came out quickly, but everything else was slow."
Corrie W.,"Tucson, AZ",45,58,15,4.0,7/29/2016,"We were thinking about going to Yard House for dinner tonight, but there was a ridiculous wait and we didn't want to sit on the patio in the rain, so we headed up the road and went to BJs. We've been there several times, the last with a small group for my husband's birthday back in November. The service is always consistent, even when they're busy, and the food is good. My favorite is the Parmesan crusted chicken with the white cheddar mashed potatoes. . it's like crack. Mmmm.  Tonight, we started with a root beer (DH) and an iced tea and water for me, and got the potato skins for a starter. Yum! We got a ton of them, and they came out hot and surprisingly fast. And they brought ranch and sour cream. Nice.  We each had burgers - the guacamole bacon for DH and the bacon burger for me. DH said the guac-bacon burger packed a bit of a kick. The bacon burger was good but not particularly memorable. The thin and crispy fries were tasty, though.  I can't remember the name of our waiter, but he was GREAT. Warm, friendly and personable, he was really a hem. He told us it was his first day, but if he hadn't mentioned it neither of us would have guessed it. He made our dinner a real pleasure."
M. R.,"Parker, AZ",0,14,10,4.0,5/21/2017,"We had a party of 11 last night celebrating my nephews graduation from Pima College Fire Academy.   Service was good,friendly staff,and food was good and healthy servings.   Although not everyone received the food at the same time, worse, the guest of honor didn't receive his till most of us were almost finished.   Waiter apologized and alerted Elier Escarcega,the manager who also apologized for the situation and offered desert for all,which some of us did.  Also very good deserts. The way Elier handled the unfortunate delay, made up for the disappointment.  Very good!!! I would definitely visit a BJ'S in the future!"
Gilbert T.,"Tucson, AZ",7,250,62,3.0,7/19/2017,"Food is great, however the portions are small and everything here is pretty pricey.  Not saying the food is bad, but it's bar food for the most part and it shouldn't be $15 for a meal, it should be more like $10.  Service is great and they do have a great selection of beers on tap.  They also have a great happy hour and specials happening.  Sign up for their email since they give get one entree free quite a bit.  Overall, a great place to eat if you get their specials, but if not be prepared to pay."
Joshua M.,"Tucson, AZ",29,66,228,3.0,8/12/2016,It's alright...the menu is large and you pretty much can get anything your heart and stomach desires. The service was great. The beer was good. Nothing too special or stands out when it comes to their food and their beer.
Mike V.,"Alto, MI",0,1,,5.0,11/11/2017,"We went to BJ's for the first time. BJ's was celebrating Veterans day on Friday & Saturday. BJ's offered $12.95 off your meal. The Happy hour is 3 to 7 Mon.-Fri. & all day Sun. Drink prices very reasonable & 1/2 off apps. Beth was our server & she really took her time with us & we really like that no ""feed ya & street ya here"". The Menu is a Book anything & everything. Beth gave us a lot of suggestions, after about an hour we finally decided on what to get.  I had the Pork-chops they were delicious, my Wife had the mini deep dish Pizza, we shared each others dish & there was plenty of left-overs. We sat in the Bar area by the Kitchen & watched the Servers running back & forth with these wonderful plates of food. First time in a long time we were very impressed with a restaurant. We will be back Sun for the NFL package. BJ's will be our go to place while snowbirding in Tucson."
Mike N.,"Tucson, AZ",9,85,18,3.0,3/7/2017,"Wife was begging me for onion rings and suggested bjs. We hadn't been there for a while so I said ok. Friday night crowd was packed. Finally got a table in the bar area. Ordered two $12 burgers. They gave her half the fries I got, bread was cold and dry. Told the waitress but didn't press the issue. I don't send food back. Oh I forgot we went there for onion rings and they don't serve them. Fries were great, service ok, $40 for two burgers with dry bread is $40 too much. Food should be fresh. No excuses accepted.  Tried it again. Some of what we ordered was ok some was not. Asparagus was way too thick, tough and undercooked. Chicken was only warm, plate was warm only. Overall food was just ok. Service ok. Nothing special about the food here.  Went for Sunday brunch a few days ago. I got a black and blue burger. The wife had cheery glazed salmon. Hers was very nice although the portion of salmon was small. My burger was so small I thought they brought me a slider. Bun was cold again and not grilled or toasted.  Quality overall was good. Taste was outstanding. Service was good but we had to ask for silverware. Quantity of food overall was not good however. And the overall price without drinks was $45. Too much for just 2 people. The appetizer we got was crispy wings with the root beer flavored BBQ sauce = fantastic ! Overall the experience was 3 stars."
Itzel L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,18,4.0,3/26/2017,If you come here on the weekends for date night make sure you call ahead it can get pretty busy really fast our food was good but it took a while for it to come out. The waiters were very courteous and came to check on us several times.
Tracy S.,"Tucson, AZ",17,111,188,3.0,8/18/2015,"Usually good, but not so great this time.  Ordered buffalo pizza to share. Again, usually delicious, nice balance of flavors, great texture, but not this time. Pizza came to us not as hot as fresh should feel. Also the cheese on it was leathery and not as moist and deliciously cheesy as it usually is.  Carnitas fries were good. If you're anti-cilantro like I am, make sure you order it without.  Tried Smores pizookie, DELICIOUS. Toasted marshmallows on top added the right amount of gentle crisp and slight bitterness of the toasted part. Peanut butter cookie and chocolate bottom were just amazing. I'd definitely go back for that. Thank you BJs for creating it.  Service, for a Monday night, sub par. Apparently there were no rolls of napkins/silverware so after our appetizers arrived we couldn't eat with utensils yet. Didn't seem that busy but not usual BJs quality. I'd normally give BJs a 4, but today was a 3."
Tiffany S.,"Tucson, AZ",641,277,665,2.0,2/27/2016,"For the price they charge for the alcoholic drinks you would think it would be a lot better, my drink seem to be extremely watered down and not very flavorful the sound of the ingredients would've made for a great drink but for some reason it failed.  And to speak of my micro mini pizza for 1295 you would think that it would've been enough to share between two people it was actually the size of a Pizza Hut personal pizza and not as good as a Pizza Hut pizza either and I don't care for Pizza Hut too much so that speaks volumes. My friend opted for their hot wings 1395 you think you would get a lot I believe you got eight wings he asked for them to be super spicy which is the only reason why I gave them two stars because they did provide him with super hot wings but you are lukewarm he ate them because he was hungry, do I plan to return to the establishment in the future not anytime soon, and if so I think I'll try the one on Oracle I've had better luck with their food and drinks at that location."
Summer B.,"Tucson, AZ",68,31,11,5.0,1/7/2017,"This is one of my go-to's in town.  I recently discovered they have a membership program, which is great.  I get free appetizers and discounts on my meals now.  It's the perfect place to go for a large party. They have no problem accommodating 10 or more. BJs serves various styles of cuisine. So, there's something for everyone. The food is always tastey and decently priced. The atmosphere is great. Nice, low lighting and lots of tvs if you want to watch the game.  However, its not distracting if you are with friends or family. Wait staff is always friendly. The booths are spacious."
Jermayne C.,"Phoenix, AZ",53,14,5,4.0,7/10/2017,The service out did the food today. Our initial order wasn't up to par. So they went head a made us another pie. The manager was very apologetic and our waiter was very diligent and friendly and the other food came out in a timely manner. The manager gave us a gift card for the inconvenience. The was just ok but the staff was friendly enough for us to go back and give them another chance
Zachary R.,"Tucson, AZ",23,153,84,3.0,5/9/2016,"During the couple times I've been here I always walk away thinking, ""I remember it being better."" My view of the food is that it's pretty average but priced a little high. The food alone would not be enough of a reason for me to ever return. I do like several of their different beers, but also a little pricey. Still tasty though. I like this place enough to go once a year if I have a friend who wants to go. I think that says it all."
Alicia D.,"Tucson, AZ",54,25,24,3.0,4/8/2017,"Came here for a date night and we ordered a Brewhouse Classic Pizza and I had an Alabama Sunset and my boyfriend got a Snakebite. The pizza was amazing, I could have ordered two and one to go. Olivia L. was our server and she had great customer service! However, John the bartender SUCKS. Who would have known this place sells $9 Capri suns called Alabama Sunset?"
Colin K.,"Mashpee, MA",1,19,,4.0,9/22/2016,"My wife and I were staying in Tucson and decided to check out this place. We both had flights of their beer and split boneless wings, a flat bread pizza, and had the brussel sprouts. A good place to watch the football game, they had a happy hour event going on - shareable appetizers were half off during NFL games. The food was good and the beer was decent. Wait staff and bartender were friendly and attentive.  Only negative was they served our appetizer and entree at the same time, but we just got off the plane and were starving, so didn't bother us a bit."
Darryl N.,"Tucson, AZ",36,210,248,4.0,7/19/2015,"Our go to family get together place.  Standardized FOOD and BREW in a clean and good service location.  Lots of seating choices, and fills quickly.  Call ahead, especially if you have a group.  Sport on the TV's throughout, lots on the menu and professional staff.   It is pretty chill once you are seated, and there are plenty of choices, a little upscale in brew pubs, focusing on food with seasonal brew choices.   Family focused and I prefer the smother reds, come on Father's Day for your pint glass.  Check the website for specials via email or reward club."
R C.,"Chassell, MI",0,3,4,2.0,7/4/2017,"This is a great place for an outing with a group of all ages as the menu is expansive. Unfortunately, there was a silver piece in my salad. Looks like the sealed cover you would take off a squeeze bottle. I didn't have the chance to let the server know as I was never asked how my food was and my plate wasn't cleared by the time we left. I certainly lost my appetite as you can see what was left behind in the photo."
Jiayi L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,16,1.0,12/6/2016,"The ribeye here is very very bad and so undercook. The waitress took it back twice and then when the steak is finally medium rare, we are already full. They don't even cook a new steak for us, they brought the original steak to the kitchen for twice. How could they let their customers eat this? Nobody can eat this. The jambalaya tastes weird and too spicy. They put too much raw green onion on top and too much chili powder. The service is not good as well. You have to walk to your waitress instead of she walks to us."
Viola R.,"Tucson, AZ",18,11,4,1.0,12/4/2016,"Our server was nice, but the order the food came out was terrible. The kids got their meals. Then 10 minutes later my niece got her salad. 30 minutes later no sign of my shrimp tacos. In short, the bill may arrive before I actually get my food. Don't go here.  It's not worth it. In a follow-up, the took my meal off my bill & packed my food to go, they apologized profusely & gave me a $25.00 gift card. I still recommend that u don't go here. Go to local places."
Rick H.,"Bellingham, WA",0,8,,3.0,6/28/2017,"The Jeremiah Red was good and the baby back ribs appetizer was fantastic.  The ice cream deserts we're yummy but the should be baked in glass or stainless steel, not aluminum.  The brisket/bacon burger was mediocre,. The bun too bready and the burger not messy enough.  The sweet potato fries were too salty and undercooked."
David Rey S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",167,117,269,3.0,1/7/2016,"Annoyingly large menu - way too much to sift through. DIRTY. Bartenders clear away prior customers food and mess and don't even bother wiping down the bar. Thus, totally surprised when the food was great.  I went with the Twisted BLT salad (excellent) and the Californian Flat Bread.  Seems to have a good following - crowded on a Thursday night with a mixed crowd. Good atmosphere.  The dirty bar mess would have me looking to try something else on my next visit to Tucson."
Bleep S.,"Tucson, AZ",273,788,1032,4.0,7/1/2016,"Corporate cuisine, but not bad. The beer on tap gets 5 stars. The ahi tuna salad was fresh and delicious. Comfortable surroundings. Very good service.  They're happy to give a large party separate checks.  This is a big plus in our family."
