Terence L.,"Tucson, AZ",5,34,1,1.0,9/23/2010,"BJ's kind of blows...   Or sucks depending on your perspective/preference.  I haven't been to a BJ's in years, and I probably should have kept it that way.  When the first one opened up on Oracle, I recall a conversation with a friend about why anyone would name a restaurant BJ's.  For those of you with virginal minds, BJ is in fact acronym for a sexual act of an oral variety.  Hence my aforementioned preposition that BJ's sucks.  Why would I apply such an unseemly metaphor in my assertion?   Because it does.  I went this past Saturday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  It happened to coincide with the Wildcat's big football game against Iowa, so the cavernous and sparkling brand-new building was packed.  Indeed, everything in the place was gleaming, (including my food).  I think the place is a little bit over a month old.  Oh, they have a freaking revolving door.  Who in the hell puts a revolving door in front of a restaurant?  I should have revolved my ass right on out the second I walked into that door.  Alas, I could never leave my friend hanging on her birthday.  *sigh* Our server was nice and friendly enough, but the service overall was somewhat tepid in the efficiency department.  Granted, however, our party numbered ten and the place was pretty crazy with the game and all.  But the check-in periods from our server at our table seemed entirely too long.  Here's an idea of how it went:  five or more minutes from ordering my beer to it arriving at my table, 10-15 minutes from having our appetizer brought out to having our server take our entree order, 15+ minutes from two in my party  to have to order another drink.   Now onto my food.  I ordered the Miso Salmon.  Yeah I know, why order fish from a chain restaurant?  And in the middle of the desert of all places?  For some reason, the description of it in the menu struck my fancy.  Anyway, how do express in words how I thought of this dish?  Well, let's begin with its appearance.  In my 30+ reviews on Yelp, I cannot recall if I've ever written in any length about how a dish looked like.  I feel absolutely compelled to so at this time.  It's hard to describe, but the best I can do is just to say that the Miso Salmon looked oddly fake.  The color and sheen of it threw me off the second the plate hit the table.   It kind of resembled those plastic display-model dishes of food you see at Japanese restaurants, like at Yoshimatsu.  All of the dishes at BJ's, judging by my friends' orders, were arranged in almost perfect beauty.  My dish looked pretty as well, with the vegetables strewn around the salmon in perfect harmony, which itself was on top of a bed of rice.  While visually appealing in artistic terms, it just didn't look real.  Put another way, it looked quite artificial.   Perhaps the cook's training at BJ's is focused on the visual arts rather than the culinary arts.  Perhaps the beauty is an illusion cast upon diners to mask its substance.  Speaking of which, the Miso Salmon was certainly edible, but enjoyable it was not.  I might have liked the dish if it weren't for the fact that the fish might have been a day past its optimal freshness.  Indeed, I think some my pickup lines were fresher than my fish at BJ's.  And if you're a single woman residing in the Tucson-area, you know that's not a good thing.  The miso sauce that the salmon was prepared in was not too bad, which is a shame that fish forced me to assign one rather than perhaps two stars.  The beer wasn't bad, but it wasn't orgasmically memorable either.  Remember that Brewhouse is part of this place's name.   To end this review, allow me to elaborate on the price:  it's as high or higher than Paris Hilton on cocaine.  If one were to order what I did that night, three pints of brew, one piece of appetizer, and entree of Miso Salmon, one would be set back in excess of $40.   Throw in tip for the two-hour long service, and one can expect to drop a cool Ulysses S. Grant. If it weren't for the fact that I was celebrating a friend's birthday that night, methinks that it would have been better spent if I someone at BJ's repeatedly punched me in the stomach till I puked and then took my wallet, as empty as it normally is.  Okay, so I never vomited from eating there, and I was able to keep my wallet (minus the cash), so that's probably hitting below the belt of BJ's. Did I ever mention what BJ stands for?"
Peg P.,"Tucson, AZ",63,442,976,4.0,9/7/2010,"Our first visit to this new BJ's and we left safisfied and full of good food. This one will definitely go on our list of frequently visted restaurants. I had the turkey club sandwich with slender fries ($9.95) and it was prepared perfectly and was presented in generous portions and nice and warm. My friend had the Field of Greens Salad ($9.95) with balsamic vinegar dressing on the side and a glass of light Switch Lager ($3.00). The salad had a great variety of greens along with pimento, glazed pecans, and fresh fetta cheese (the only way to have fetta!), all presented attractively in a heart-shaped white dish. It was very filling, very generous in size, and was enjoyed as a complete meal.  The restaurant, around noon, was chocked full of people of all ages and while it had the hum of a busy and happy crowd of folks enjoying lunch, it was relaxing and easy to just be there. Lots of TVs on the wall for sports viewing. Large areas that could easily accommodate banquets or large  groups. Outdoor eating is available as well as a web-generated pick-up service. If you order from their lunch menu, which we did not, you can bring down the price of your meal, of course. Our servers were polite and attentive and while it took about 20 minutes from the time we sat until we were served, I still like this place very much.  We want to return and try their famous pizzas and more of their vast variety of beers!"
Betsy Z.,"Tucson, AZ",8,39,,3.0,8/23/2013,"BJs is a nice chain restaurant.  It is large, but always seems to be crowded.  My husband and I went on a Sunday evening and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table .  Not a big deal, just surprising.  The menu is large.  I think that everyone could find something they like.  My husband and I both ordered healthier-option meals and were happy with our choices.  Since we ordered light, we didn't feel too bad splitting a pzookie for dessert - warm cookie with melting ice cream on top.  Yum!"
Tammy T.,"Tempe, AZ",1,2,1,1.0,10/9/2010,"Just had the worst experience ever! We went to BJ's for my Mom's birthday and ended up waiting an hour for a table, and another hour for our food. To top if off, our waitress ( I think her name is Paige, not sure b/c she never introduced herself, it's just what it says on my bill) never really came to check on our table during the long waiting time.  She was chatting with the table next to us and completely ignored us. Finally the manager came over and told us that the deep-dish pizza my sister ordered was backing up our whole order because they had too many orders in the kitchen for the pizza station. So, they brought out the rest of our food and my mom's chicken was cold, my fiance never received his wedge salad and had the wrong fries, and my brother's flat-bread pizza was cold.  Although the manager offered us free dessert and to not charge us for my sister's pizza, we wanted to leave ASAP since by the time we were done with dinner we had been there for about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Our server checked on the table next to us, then ignored us, so we caught the manger's eye again and asked for our check. After we paid the bill, our server didn't say a word when dropping off the final receipt even though my brother said ""thank you"". Never ever in my life had I had such horrible service. The food was mediocre and worst of all my Mom's birthday night was ruined."
Eve S.,"Tucson, AZ",19,102,,4.0,5/27/2011,"For a chain this place is rather good actually. The options are plentiful and my food has been tasty. They do seem to have issues with consistency on making a medium hamburger which bothers my boyfriend. Sometimes it's right on, sometimes too well.  The broccoli cheddar soup rocks my world."
Brittany A.,"Tucson, AZ",17,36,,3.0,10/11/2013,"This is our go-to place when all the other places in town have insane waits because BJ's always gets us seated pretty quickly. Even on a Saturday night, the most we've had to wait is about 20 minutes. The food is consistently good. We've ordered different dishes and apps and they've all been pretty yummy. The service is hit or miss. The first visit, the waitress got my order wrong. When I corrected her, she argued with me saying that I must have told her the wrong thing when I initially ordered (I didn't).  They served my fiance his food while I waited for mine to be cooked. I didn't want his to get cold so I told him to eat. He finished before my food arrived. Subsequent visits have been better. Refills were prompt, the servers were nice but not overbearing, and it was decent."
Abigail F.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,1,,2.0,2/8/2015,"We went to this location this evening for a birthday celebration for a friend, there were quite a few of us. It took the waitress over 15 minutes to get to our table to take our drink orders. We also had two waiters, it complicated things. For example we wanted two people to be on one check (they were on opposite sides of the table and so the person paying the bill got two checks instead of one. They rarely came by our table so refills were always needed, it took over a half hour to get a refill for one person that was sitting at our table since they kept forgetting to get it (multiple wait staff members). The food was good although some of it tasted as though it had been sitting for awhile which is always unpleasant. Overall I would say it was fine but the Oracle location is much better."
Rebecca G.,"Wichita Falls, TX",9,11,7,5.0,7/7/2013,"Love love love this place. It has been by far one of our fav places here in Tucson. The service has always been great with friendly wait staff, and managers. If we have had an issue with anything it was fixed without a question, or complaint. The food always has amazing flavor, and there is always something new for us to try."
Chris F.,"Tucson, AZ",20,9,,3.0,8/20/2010,"This week's search for a bi-weekly ""board meeting"" arena in south central Tucson took us to the newest BJ's location. Even though it was over 100 outside, we opted to sit out on the patio for immediate seating. It turned out to be a great choice as the shade and misters outside offered ample protection from the elements. The woman who seated us was pleasant and even ran down the daily specials for us. Soon after, the waiter arrived (ran down the specials again) and took drink orders. I opted to go with the hand-crafted orange cream soda for three main reasons: (1) I like just about anything orange, (2) I like creamsicles, and (3) I couldn't order a beer in the middle of a work day. Regardless, the color and taste of the beverage did not disappoint (nor did the free refills!) For lunch, my two companions order the unlimited soup and salad combo. According to them, the house salads left something to be desired, but the soups were hearty and tasty. I opted for the ceasar salad and half grilled chicken sandwich. The ceasar salad easily met my expectations with creamy dressing and croûtons that were neither too hard nor too soggy. The sandwich was pleasant with a nice variety of veggies and sauce that added a little spice. The wedge cut fries were delicious. Overall, BJ's is getting a less than stellar review from me due to the less than attentive service. I can assure you, though, that it would have been significantly lower if I had ordered unlimited food. My companions were only offered a new selection once (pathetic in my eyes). This could have been due to the lunch time rush, but it affected my enjoyment nevertheless. I actually look forward to returning, however, and sampling all that their extensive beer menu has to offer. If it's anything like the orange cream soda, I know I'll be pleased with my decision to attend this brewery on an off-work-hours beer journey."
Dr. Rhonda B.,"Canton, OH",94,29,,4.0,8/9/2013,"Enjoyable casual dining and an excellent menu overall. Tasty, affordable appetizers. LOVE the house root beer. Even at the third visit, trying Italian to BBQ, I have yet to have a bad meal. Superb waitstaff - also a plus."
Andrea H.,"San Francisco, CA",387,424,6065,3.0,11/22/2010,"First, this is a chain. It acts like a chain and tastes like a chain.  If that doesn't bother you, well, that's rad and you will sincerely enjoy BJ's. The happy hour is pretty weak-- it's only $1 off well drinks and beer.  Personally, I'd rather dine at a non-chain brewery like Barrio.  We were told that the wait would be 45 min. on a Friday (it ended up being only 30 min.), so make reservations on the weekends for dinner.  I had the Thai lettuce wraps as a meal (it's an appetizer) and they were fresh, tasty, but without flair.  The (very) deep dish pizza at the end of my table looked filling and tasty and their was no complaints from the group who ordered burgers.  The men at my table enjoyed the freshly brewed beers.  I appreciated the quick and considerate service."
Johnny W.,"Vail, AZ",34,40,,4.0,2/6/2011,"This review is on behalf of the' Whine and Dine Club of Coyote Creek"" -- There were fifteen of us in the party. We made prior arrangements with the manager for separate checks etc-so they should have been prepared for our size etc-- The group was overall pleased with the meal however we caveat that this is not a fine dining restaurant but instead a ""brew house"" albeit a pub thus our review took this into our comments. The portion size was generous --too much for some- Beer was tasty --  The wait staff although fully aware of our party size flubbed up some orders and incorrectly tabbed some checks-- In total we all said we would return again- Our recommendation is don't go here for fine dining- do go for the brew and sports bar quality food- and plan to split a plate in most instances--"
Ray C.,"Denver, CO",25,190,113,5.0,12/22/2012,Had a fabulous Sesame Chicken Salad and it was a little bit TOO pricey!  $12.95 for a plate of Sesame Chicken Salad. I could find much cheaper at another place for the same salad.  The waitness was very good to us and refilled our glasses of water often.
Madeline G.,"Fullerton, CA",84,646,,3.0,11/25/2012,"Like any other BJs. Familiar, decent food. Nothing spectacular. Good lunch specials. Great service, but this location can get packed!"
Ebony W.,"Fairfax, VA",11,18,16,1.0,3/25/2012,"I've  given BJ's more than one chance to wow my family and I, but they've continuously let me down. You wait forever for your food and then, it's cold or it isn't right. We waited for an hour and they brought us out all cold food, we've gone and they are out of food. Tonight I decided to get food to go and that was a bad idea! I was really hankering for my dessert, checked the bag and they put the wrong desert in my bag! I live to far away to turn back and fuss about my dessert. I also ordered a potato no green onions, looked at the potato and continued home. What could possibly be wrong with a baked potato .... Took a deep breath, my potato looks great..... Bit into it and taste like it marinated in green onions. They must have picked them off right before giving it to me.... I waited for 30 to 40 minutes just to get my food. Normally I'm not a complainer but that was their last chance to serve me or my family.    Highly Disappointed...High Price + Bad food = Never Again!"
Joe N.,"Long Island, NY",1,20,10,4.0,1/22/2013,"Good food. Mahi Mahi tacos were some of the best I've had yet. A bit pricey, not crazy but not cheap. The pizza was ok , I enjoyed it but its not the N.Y. Pizza I'm into. I would eat here again and most likely get those yummy Tacos again."
Justin S.,"Tucson, AZ",151,16,174,4.0,10/22/2012,This place is happening... Every time I have been here they have been pretty busy and it's no wonder with their enormous beer selection and such a huge food menu I can't imagine that one would not be able to find something that they didn't like. I have personally only gotten appetizers (the calamari is awesome) and a few of their pizzas which were incredible. The wait and bar staff have always been very friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu.
Je R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,1.0,8/1/2015,"right away the hostess asks if we're a member of the premier rewards program. i just want a seat,  not a commitment.  the service is still strangely slow here even after yardhouse opened down the street and took a lot of business.  waited a while to place drink orders.  beer didn't arrive until food did.  i ordered avocado spring rolls and they tasted weird. my hefeweizen tasted like vinyl. there was a drug dealer lurking out back waiting for someone to come out.  my daughters kale brussel sprout salad looked good.  but won't be back for another 1.5 years probably.  came on sat. 8/1/15 about 2pm."
Christopher S.,"Tucson, AZ",48,32,27,1.0,11/26/2011,"I have been here many times and have been satisfied, but of late the service has been horrible and the food mediocre.  I don't know what happened to the prompt service.  They either are understaffed or they are not training their servers properly.  I hope it gets better cause it is a cool place to go."
Karen Y.,"London, United Kingdom",2,3,1,4.0,6/15/2014,"I love the appetizers especially the stuffed mushrooms. We had calamares, and the shrimp with leafy vegetable. I had hawaiian mahi mahi it was ok, I think it would taste better if the fish was fresh.  We also ordered pizzookie and it was yummy but it was a little too sweet for our taste plus the icecream on top,  but overall we love the food, defintely will come back for more. We love the ambiance too!"
