David W.,"Stevensville, MT",3,39,,4.0,2/14/2016,Great craft beer.  We like the light meals for lunch.  Prices are a little high but the service is usually good.  We have not tried the happy hot.
Lorissa B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,9,5,5.0,5/2/2014,Such brewhouse. Great waitress. So delicious. Much fancy decor. Wow.  Tl;dr: will definitely return
Jerry G.,"Tucson, AZ",19,546,162,2.0,8/18/2014,We have been here on a couple of occasions and have not been impressed.  The food is only OK and the service is always slow.  I will say the restaurant is clean and so is the restroom.
Stephen K.,"Alexandria, VA",181,378,235,4.0,3/18/2013,"Happy Hour specials here are the best...but get there early because this place gets packed! Food quality is superb as always at any BJs.  Prices, especially at Happy Hour, are hard to beat.   I'm really surprised to see all the negative comments about this BJs.  What is it with Tucson?  If it's that bad, then why was the line out the door?  And if the line is out the door, be a little bit forgiving on wait time.   I am really confused as to how BJs gets a 3 star rating, and yet some of the really nasty local places get 4 or 5?  I'm sorry, I will support local places any day...but let's not inflate their ratings.  Silver Saddle sucks...and that's supposed to be Tucson's best steakhouse?  BJ's service and food quality was much, much better. Please... Travel a bit people...and be honest with your ratings."
Mark N.,"Fullerton, CA",4,45,2,5.0,7/6/2015,Went to this location for the first time the other day and oh my goodness it was great!!!! Our server LIZZETTE was wonderful! Very sweet and attentive and always made sure our glasses were full. The manager JAY was AWESOME! Came over to our table to make sure everything was great. Very nice and very social. Jay made our experience just spectacular! Definitely coming back!!! LOVE this location!
E W.,"Tucson, AZ",0,17,,1.0,5/29/2016,"My lunch of bison burger was very disappointing. It was served cold, and I asked for it to be reheated. This was done but took a very long time by which time my friends had finished eating. This time it was warm and anyway the burger was very small, certainly not worth $11.95. I will never return. Beer was OK but pricey."
Robert L.,"Globe, AZ",0,1,,2.0,8/13/2016,"I've been going to the Broadway Bj's Brewhouse since they opened, and they are hit and miss.   I moved about a year ago and don't get back very often. I was visiting my family and wanted to go and try it again. I wish I hadn't. I ordered mozzarella sticks which came out cold and then I ordered their Late night burger and asked for no chili verde. When it came out I was away from the table. I came back and looked a the meal and it looked terrible. It was covered in Chili Verde and I couldn't even see any burger meat. The waitress (who was very nice) was busy and didn't come back for awhile. Several servers passed the table and could see that I wasn't eating the meal and didn't say anything. I attempted to get ahold of a manager and they didn't come over. When the waitress came back I showed her the burger. I told her that this wasn't how I asked for and she said I did ask for it the other way. She asked if I wanted something else but my family was almost done so I said no. A manager did come over and apologize but it was around the time we were getting ready to leave.  I will not go back to this Bj's Brewhouse again."
lawrence f.,"Tucson, AZ",3,45,3,4.0,12/5/2015,"Big Fan. First of all,The best bartender in the state of Arizona: Shannon. She works the bar five days a week and hands down is the best .The friendliest, liveliest,and most professional bartender i've ever meet in a mid range ,unpretentious establishment. And the food is very decent.... though a little high on salt and fat but hey ,it's a brew house. The beer selection is fantastic:  30 beers on tap including their own very good beers. You can't go wrong here. Enjoy. Something for everyone."
Roscoe M.,"Tucson, AZ",16,6,,2.0,5/31/2014,"I've never really understood why folks flock to BJ's when there are so many local options that blow them out of the water.  I like that they have their own beers on tap, but the problem is that each time I've tried one if their beers, I felt underwhelmed and just like, 'Eh, it was a beer.' The food is decent--think upscale Applebee's or Cheesecake Factory's slightly hipper, more expensive cousin.  For the price paid, I haven't left thinking I got a good deal or that the quality of the food matched the price I've paid. The service is fantastic, however, and the reason for any stars.  Each time I've felt the wait staff went above and beyond to make sure my experience was top notch. Ill still go if a friend insists, but probably not of my own volition."
Kyle S.,"Tucson, AZ",2,92,,2.0,3/14/2014,"Haiku review: Meat with side of meat. A more upscale Applebees. Crappy in-house brews. The folks call me and ask if me and the special lady friend want to get dinner with them before they go to Las Vegas to and visit my Idiot brother. Well long story short we end up here.  I honestly haven't any idea if they had to wait as when we arrived they had mostly killed the appetizers. Which, DaFuq is with serving a horseradish sauce with lettuce wraps sure they call it a spicy mustard sauce but who are you fooling it isn't even yellow? There also were some fried artichoke hearts which were good but in the lower third of fried artichoke bits I have managed to shove in my mouth throughout my travels. The sauce was like someone mixed 1 part lemon juice to 2-3 parts ranch... but the super overcooked piece of fried calamari hiding amongst the crispy plant matter was a real wake up to my pallet. Its flavor really complimented its bicycle inner tube-esque texture. Now I will never claim to never eat animal bits but, Jesus Tap Dancing Christ there are only TWO vegetarian options and absolutely no viable vegan options. Your choices are a veggie pizza or some pasta with a very mediocre red sauce.  So I finally decided on a turkey club after I realized everyones hunger filled eyes were digging into me after the 5th lap thru the menu looking for something that I would both  eat and try to enjoy. The turkey club was a middle of the road club sandwich that would have been worse had I not added avocado. There is way too much bacon and turkey to get any kind of balance of flavors. The skinny fries were fine. Special lady friend at least found a scallop tomato asparagus dish that didn't have any red flags of allergy warnings (deathly allergic to quinoa) when it arrived it was fine not horrible not exceptional just fine. However it was along the lines of thats it?. Mom and Dad both got the honey crisp salads, apparently this is their go to dish at this place. I also feel I need to point out that this place has service problems drinks taking forever to refill, a five min gap between dishes arriving at the table, not bringing the salad dressing. Bottom line: I can honestly say that unless the goal is to go out with friends/coworkers/acquaintances for some lackluster beers I will not return, sorry Mom and Dad we will not join you at BJ's."
Colt B.,"Tucson, AZ",7,24,,1.0,10/12/2015,"I don't know why I keep giving this place a second chance. I got a burger thinking it was safe, the bun was toasted but somehow refrigerator cold. The burger didn't cover the entire bun and was thin and crispy. The meat tastes slightly like it had been left out too long. The crispy thin cut fries weren't crispy they were soggy and undercooked."
Suzy M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,45,,2.0,10/6/2015,"How in the heck can you run out of wings..well these guys did. Oops someone forgot or misjudged what to order? Food was good, and hot. Ordered chips and cheese sauce but very little chips(chip recession?)."
Logan B.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",0,1,1,1.0,2/16/2014,"This was literally horrible... First, I walked in and the atmosphere was horrible. The waiters and waitresses were rude and off putting, and they got all our orders wrong. I asked for a lemonade and they gave me a diet coke... The food was awful and seemed like it was just leftovers warmed up... If you want to go to BJ's rethink this one!!!!!!!!!!"
Cam W.,"Rochester, NY",11,62,7,3.0,8/2/2015,"The wide selection of tasty beers on tap and enormous TV make this a good place to catch a ballgame at the bar. I haven't sampled any of the food but the menu is large and the options are plentiful. The bartenders are nice guys, usually ready to chat and and explain the beer options when asked. They are big fans of the upsell, and I get it... not bothersome really, but I'm pretty sure most people who have already said twice that they won't be ordering food don't appreciate being asked a third time."
Nali M.,"Kauai, HI",683,560,950,2.0,3/21/2012,"I keep going back, and I'm definitely starting to see a trend here.  the food is great, an the lunch specials have excellent prices. it's the service that could use a complete make over. took out their lunch special ham and cheese with tomato soup. I usually order a full sandwich but the lady that took my order didn't ask whether I wanted a half or full. got back to my car to discover it was only a half. walked back inside and the manager who was standing behind the take out counter blatantly ignored me. they didn't apologize for the misunderstanding either. the only good thing is that I didn't have to pay for the other sandwich-- oops, i mean half a sandwich. they even got the order wrong again after i went back to fix it.  didn't go back in the second time to correct the problem. it wouldn't have been worth the time/trouble.  get it together, bj's."
Eric A.,"Pleasanton, CA",12,8,,2.0,3/8/2014,"I was very disappointed. They gave the wrong appetizer. They gave an empty ketchup container. The veggies were cold and the salmon subpar. The pen for my bill didn't even work.  The manager did try to fix the situation, but even the free pazooki left me feeling sick.  I'm sure most of the time BJs is an average (not great) experience, and they just messed up tonight. I won't be going again, however."
Katy L.,"Tucson, AZ",36,16,14,4.0,8/27/2015,We started off with asking if they could still do the stuffed baked potato since it seemed to end at lunch. The server was kind enough to say we could have it and made it no big deal. My fiancé started with cheddar broccoli soup which by her standard was a bit too cheesy. I ordered the portobello mushroom burger veg style which comes with three pieces of portobello instead of burger patty. My fiancé ordered the chicken broccoli and Alfredo stuffed potato. The food didn't take more than 15 minutes to arrive and looks awesome!!! I love how my burger came on a kitchen style pan. Being someone who works in a kitchen I could appreciate it! Everything was so delicious and piping hot! I would absolutely come back for this again. The only draw back was that our waiter wasn't able to check back on us to see how we liked it because I wanted to tell him how delicious it was! To his credit he seemed really busy and when he did come over he was always there to refill our drinks which is huge for us. Our servers name was mark and he was awesome!!!
Willanne W.,"Vail, AZ",40,144,123,2.0,2/22/2014,"We ate here the other night at my friend's suggestion.  I doubt I'll go back. I had the Chicken A la Fresca.  It was a salt bomb!  The chicken (what couldn't have been more than 2 or 3 ounces) breast meat was pre-sliced very thin (Hey, I do know how to cut my own meat) and served with a sauce that was kind of congealed and incredibly salty.  The veggies were soggy, like the had been sitting for a while and just reheated to be served -- or maybe they are boiled in a bag or something.  The veggies were touted to be prepared ratatouille style but they didn't come anywhere close to that.   It was a pretty lousy meal for the $$ and didn't look anything like how it was pictured on the menu. My friend had a wedge salad that was drowned in dressing and a personal pan pizza  which might have had 6 pepperoni slices on it.   What do people see in this place??"
Jess M.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",122,6,,3.0,7/4/2015,"I love the chain but I was a little disappointed with this particular location. Menu was dirty, and the ahi on the seared ahi salad was gross. Ended up eating around it."
Khush P.,"Edison, NJ",0,3,,1.0,4/10/2016,"Very disappointed with the food...we ordered the avocado rolls and they were ok, my husband ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos and they were ok and I ordered the honey glazed salmon with rice and it was just bland...I would not recommend this place for dinner at all...and very pricey!!!"
