Tim K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,5.0,8/15/2015,"I keep coming back even though I don't live nearby!  I've tried a variety of dishes and I've NEVER been disappointed!  My favorite is the jambalaya... I'm the son of a cajun, so I ask for it extra spicy!  ;)  Just had their new North Beach MahiMahi and shrimp.  Bravo!  And the beer... Great variety!  Servers and bar tenders are some of the friendliest and helpful I've ever encountered!"
Charles S.,"Tucson, AZ",90,22,,4.0,7/11/2014,"I took my fiance for a date. It was kind of a special night, and we liked the atmosphere and the service. Our server made time for us even though the place was packed.  Our appetizers were really good. The avocado egg rolls were the highlight of the meal. My fiance's entree was some chicken dish. It was amazing. My entree, on the other hand, was a burger that is in the same league as Wendys, but way more expensive. The portions were big, and we were able to have our left overs for lunch the next day."
Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",180,502,33,3.0,8/31/2011,"My wife and I went on a Friday night for a late ""snack"" (just so you know, to me beer is a snack). They tell us the wait will be 15 minutes. We tell them we just want to go in the bar. We are told it's open seating and are welcome to see if there are any open tables. Miraculously, we found an empty table.  As you can imagine, the place was pretty busy. We are greeted in short order by a server but we have to tell her we are not ready yet. I already know what I want to drink but my wife always like to look at the drink menu to what wild concoctions she may find. She settles on the pomegranate margarita and it's, of course, beer for me. Tip: try the Ska Imperial Pale Ale, but only one. Their pretty strong... even for me.  To go with our drinks we also order Artichoke Dip to munch on. The drinks arrive and we sip, chat and people watch while we wait for our food to come out. The dip arrives. I take my first bite. It's ICE COLD in the middle. We inform the server and she is mortified. She immediately takes it back to the kitchen. I will give credit here. When she brought it back to us, it seemed we got a fresh dish and the other one was not just reheated. After all this, the dip is just OK. It tastes strongly of cream cheese and I don't find much artichoke. I liked my beer choice and my wife says her margarita is ""fine"". Chains are, if nothing else, consistent, but BJ's fell down on this visit. Three stars puts this place more in line with where it ought to be... at least in my rating system. I must have been feeling generous in my other review."
Shannon L.,"Tucson, AZ",51,27,,5.0,6/16/2015,BJ's never disappoints.  It's a great place to bring a group because their menu is large enough to make everyone happy.  They have a great beer selection and amazing Pazookie cookie desserts!
Jill N.,"Tucson, AZ",47,106,27,5.0,2/22/2015,"Always good here.. Consistent, service is on point. Food is served properly and on time. Their Clam Chowder is awesome in the sourdough loaf."
Randy C.,"Tucson, AZ",23,27,,5.0,6/14/2013,"Bjs is always a good option when I cant decide on dinner because they have a large menu. The only bad thing is they can get busy which will cause them to be a little slow. Also I was upset to see they didn't have weekend brunch at this location, in Los Angeles their brunch is one of my favorite reasons to eat there Liked: Great food Disliked: Slow, No brunch"
Suzan S.,"Tucson, AZ",45,13,,2.0,10/25/2014,"This place has completely gone downhill. Service was terrible, and the food was disgusting.  The cheese on the pizza was the cheap, metal-tasting cheese you get at amusement park food stands, barely melted. The last time I ate there, I got a pasta dish that was bland, no flavor.  This is a Golden Corral in a nice building.  I basically feel like the cooks are nuking frozen entrees in the back.  Done giving this place a chance, adios.  Pumpkin ale was pretty good, so I'll give it two stars."
David C.,"Apache Junction, AZ",63,91,11,5.0,7/16/2014,"Great lunch, great service!  What more can you ask for!   Previous review is totally irrelevant, as I mistakenly have BJ's a review of Starbucks.  Thanks to the nice gal who alerted me to my error. :)"
K P.,"Chandler, AZ",5,84,,4.0,3/29/2014,"The hostess who seated us deserves the credit for improving my opinion of this location.  While walking to the table my husband stopped ""cold"" to watch one of the games.  After I urged him to keep walking, she said she would tune the t.v. directly in front of us to the same channel.  Nice!   Our server was somewhat a space cadet when asked whether or not it was happy hour.  Poor girl.  She started talking, making no sense at all - while checking her arm for a watch and the wall for a clock.  The sun was in no danger of setting and after telling her the time, she continued to ramble.  When she left our table in search of the answer, we all burst into laughter.  When she returned to us it was as though a clone had taken her place.  She was completely coherent and ended up providing very good service."
Racheal W.,"Tucson, AZ",3,5,,5.0,5/26/2015,"So delicious! I tried the flight with Oasis amber complimenting my Hawaiian mahi mahi and was in heaven ^_^ the pm porter was a dessert, great finishing touch"
M B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,6,7,5.0,4/11/2016,"I took my family here is a first time customer and it was extremely pleased. Not only were the staff friendly, they were knowledgeable and timely/attentive. There is a lot to choose from on their menu and even a section for those who want to count calories. The food was terrific and the portion sizes were large. They also offer military discount. I would definitely recommend this place and we plan on going back there within the week."
Baltazar V.,"Garden Grove, CA",5,5,,5.0,4/19/2015,"Food was fantastic, I had myself some mozzarella sticks which were prepared to perfection. Afterwards I had the jalapeño burger which was delicious off the charts amazing. The waiter was extremely helpful and my Long Island was prepared and brought to me quickly which is always a plus. Best bj around."
Shavonne R.,"Chicago, IL",0,9,,5.0,4/5/2015,"After having a few horrible customer service experiences this weekend, I really wanted to take the time to compliment BJs who got it right! After ordering a pizza, the waiter drops it on the floor right in front of the table.  Without us saying a word the manager comes and offers us complementary soup and salad to take the edge off the wait. Way to be proactive and show appreciation and consideration for your customers! For that (and the yummy food) you have earned a loyal customer."
Jim S.,"Tucson, AZ",23,123,87,3.0,1/2/2014,"I kinda have mixed feelings.  The food is really good, though a bit expensive.  The really problem tends to be a service issue.  I am usually disappointed in the slow inattentive service.  On this occasion, the service was so slow that the entrees came to the table before even the appetizers.  The delivering, picking up, and returning the check is always a painful process."
Jennifer D.,"Tucson, AZ",369,526,93,3.0,5/28/2011,"This is great place for a quick bite to eat.  We usually go to BJ's if I am not in the mood to cook dinner.   Being from Chicago the pizza really isn't Chicago style to me at all, or I would have given them four stars. Nothing beat Chicago pizza in the city of Chicago. They have a great lunch menu, their soup and salad combo is pretty good, the tomato soup is the best! As for the desert the Pazookie is the BEST thing on the menu, although I just saw that they have a red velvet one that I am going to have to try."
Wren K.,"Vail, AZ",138,10,8,4.0,11/8/2011,"I love this place, I love the atmosphere its casual but nice. The food is great, and the IPA, love love love it.  You can go here for a nice dinner or a relaxing lunch, or just to sit and talk with friends. Bj's comes to mind whenever trying to decide of someplace to go."
C M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,46,3,4.0,4/20/2015,"Always a pleasure coming to BJ's Brewhouse.  We always have great service.  Food is great, desert is great and beer selection is on point!  Would def recomend BJ's to everyone!"
Melanie B.,"Chandler, AZ",0,31,8,5.0,2/8/2015,"Great service! The guy was very nice, food amazing as usual. Really good drinks, ""a drink like that"" was definitely my favorite. Fast service even though it was busy and only a short 5 minute wait. Bjs is a little pricey but worth it."
Brian H.,"Tucson, AZ",594,42,73,5.0,5/11/2015,One of my family's personal favorites it's got a great atmosphere they also have a great lunch special and all-you-can-eat soup and salad and there's five different soups and five different salads for only 7.50$ it's a great deal they also have really good beer
Colin E.,"Springfield, VA",8,18,100,5.0,1/22/2014,Seared ahi salad is fantastic if you're looking for something lighter.
