Kate H.,"Tucson, AZ",2,28,1,2.0,11/13/2012,"My mother mentioned to me that she heard BJ's was an excellent chain so we decided to go here for my birthday a few days ago. I'm not really one to try new places but my family can be rather picky so we chose this place because of their huge array of choices. I definitely should have looked at the reviews on here before coming. The waiting time between ordering and receiving food was absolutely, unbelievably bad. After reading the reviews here I guess it must be a common problem but I was astonished it took nearly TWO hours to be seated, order, receive the food and then order and receive a small dessert. There is definitely a huge disconnect between the kitchen and the waiters; although our waiter was very friendly and almost a little too outgoing after the 5th ""Oh, it'll be a few more minutes!"" it gets old. Oh, and sorry BJ's, but  it does NOT take more than half an hour to put two cookies in a metal pan, heat them up, and put some ice cream on top of them. When we had received our food it was sub-par at best; hamburgers and their buns were overcooked, angel hair pasta was a ball of dough (God bless my family who ate it, I tried it and nearly spit it out) because it was overcooked, the chicken burnt in spots, etc. I could go on but I was so disappointed with this place we had to talk to the manager and explain that there really is no excuse for this kind of service. Whatever manager was working that night definitely went out of his way though since he refunded my entire party of six's meals, all drinks, and two appetizers. Because of that I'm bumping this place up to two-stars but honestly it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. I'm sure the bar is probably better but after this experience I don't ever want to come here again."
Claudia A.,"Norwalk, CA",26,26,22,1.0,7/9/2014,"The food was ok for typical chain restaurants. The service...almost non existent! And for that reason, a 1-star rating."
Anthony B.,"Tucson, AZ",24,143,5,2.0,10/30/2012,"Third Time eating here and I always end up leaving saying the same thing. The food was eh.....ok  the service was eh.....ok  The atmosphere was .....eh  The shrimp on my thai shrimp lettuce wraps were tiny  my dinning partners burger looked like it had be folded in quarters then put on the bun. and His fries were cold. Overall I may end up here by loss of the never ending  ""where should we eat"" vote. But it will not be my first choice this place never wows me with service food or atmosphere."
Amanda M.,"Sahuarita, AZ",100,117,458,3.0,10/24/2013,They have such a big menu. Lots of choices but a bit overwhelming. I liked the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. The burger was a good size but even with the jalapenos not much flavor. The service started out good but after we got our meal we didn't see him much. We were there on our lunch breaks so by the time he came back we didn't get to try desert because we had to leave. I will try it again as there are so many things that looked yummy.
Anne P.,"Tucson, AZ",0,43,2,3.0,1/24/2015,"BJ's is a great, average restaurant that is good for business lunches and watching sports. The menu is full of all kinds of food, so you can be sure to find something. It kind of reminds me of an Applebees or a TGI Fridays. Nothing special, but still good."
Susie I.,"Tucson, AZ",29,5,,1.0,8/23/2016,"I have had great meals here... but, if you wanted to partake of the green flash beer pairings.. you saved your money and your tummy. Pretty sure this was the biggest waste of money...ever.   Ahi poke salad with a light lager, I really liked. Having to ask to get everyone served at a 4 top table, not cool.  Every single time! 8 beers! They also leave your tasting glasses and then bring them back, fresh from the dishwasher.  Hot to the touch and then they pour the beer in them. Ridiculous! Blt was a wilted salad with bacon and tomatoes.  Worse dressing ever! Deep dish pizza was 1 slice of pizza that was thick and tasted like frozen pizza. Pizzokie thing, was in some cardboard tray.  Warm cookie dough, raw with a semi cooked top with ice cream and more warm beer. $40 a person for the worst meal and killing the beer with hot glasses and forgetting to pour one more at the table.  They were great to call 5 mins after to check on how we paid though. I loved  BJ's  but now I have a warm nasty green flash beer in my mouth. Thanks for taking $160 from us for the worst meal ever."
Gabriela F.,"Tucson, AZ",94,89,10,4.0,9/27/2013,"I like going to BJs. We frequent both locations here in Tucson, and although the parking situation at this one sucks, the food is always good. Last night I went for a friend's birthday dinner. There were 12 of us at the table, and the service was a bit slow, but once the food came, we forgot all about it and chowed down. I had the balsamic glazed chicken and would definitely order it again.  They have a large selection of beers, including their own BJs beers that they brew. I always get the home made sodas though, usually cream soda. They also have the best root beer, and an orange cream. You can't leave without having a pizookie so save room! if you have a group, definitely get the sampler. If you just get one, we like oreo the best. It's a chocolate cookie and vanilla ice cream with mousse that tastes just like an oreo filling but even better."
Ruben Q.,"Hicksville, NY",632,280,504,3.0,4/8/2013,"if you like apple bees then you will love this place, food was so,so.  but they do have a vast selection of brews that apple bees does not have...  customer service little slow,  but in all fairness they were very busy...."
Ashley L.,"Tucson, AZ",2,3,,2.0,8/29/2014,"Not a fan. Went for dinner tonight and was denied a drink because of the way my ID was shaped. The ""manager"" came over and was not friendly and the food was mediocre at best. Not worth the wait and money. I suggest heading down the street to one of the other restaurants in the area."
Kelly M.,"Tucson, AZ",5,8,,4.0,7/14/2014,"This BJ's is busy,  but not crowded. Service was great and drinks were well mixed. I definitely recommend this location.  Every co-worker that I interacted with was nice. Our server went out of his way to make me feel special on my birthday. The atmosphere was laid back and not too loud."
Joanne L.,"Albuquerque, NM",37,154,42,4.0,3/22/2011,"A group of 6 of us recently went to BJ'S on a whim and wow i am glad we did.....  We called 30 minutes prior to arriving at the Restaurant and they put us on the wait list so when we got there we waited less then 10 minutes and we were seated...  We were seated in the middle of the Restaurant at a table and our group felt slightly cramped so we asked the waitress if we could be moved to a table outside.. she happily moved us no problem at all.  DRINKS: we all ordered different drinks us ladies had cocktails and the guys ordered beers... everyone was happy with there drinks and we didn't wait long at all BUT i must say the drinks are pricey my cocktails were $9.50 each our drink tab was as much as what we paid for the food!!  Appetizers: My Husband and I got the Avocado rolls and they were YUMMY so fresh and we loved the sauce that came with them.  My friend got soup and said it was amazing and the other couple with us got calamari they also said it was very very good!! Positive remarks all around we were all impressed...  Entree: I ordered the Balsamic Chicken which was delicious very tasty and alot of it I struggled to even eat 3/4 off my plate.. my husband and friend both got pizza's I cant remember what ones they got but they both loved them I tried a slice of my husbands and it was great! The other people at our table ordered A sandwich, Tacos and a salad everyone said there food was excellent not 1 bad comment was made...  Bill: for 2 of us for 2 cocktails,2 beers,1 appetizer and 2 entrees our bill came to $70 we felt this was slightly pricey but when we deducted the drinks from the bill ($30) it came to $40 i think next time a beer each will do!!  for the 6 of us our bill came to approx $180  Our experience at BJ'S was fantastic and we will be returning I would recommend this place highly"
Elsbeth P.,"Tucson, AZ",7,136,,3.0,8/22/2012,"The Good: - Their beer selection is pretty ridiculous, in a good way.  You can even order samples/flights.  Offering tastes/samples is always a good indicator in my book. - The pizza and giant baked potatoes are delicious.   - If you don't want to wait for a table, the bar service is good.   The Bad: - The wait times are atrocious, and for no reason.  Yes, they're popular but when we were given our little buzzy pager thing and told ""30 minutes"", I counted at LEAST ten empty tables.  This is just poor management by doing a bad job of staffing. - The service itself is pretty slow.  The servers are stretched really thin and if you're in the back part of the restaurant, be prepared to wait twice as long as everyone else because they're running around so much.  Not their fault- again, poor management.   - The menu reads like a phone book.  Heads up. If you're willing to wait a little bit for some REALLY good food and beer, I really recommend it, just leave your service expectations at the door ."
John T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,4.0,1/11/2015,Their Happy Hour appetizers are a hit. Great value and added my fav Brewhouse Blonde on special. This place is always a good bet. Food quality is very good
Igor E.,"Tucson, AZ",0,6,,2.0,1/7/2015,"Was hungry and this was the closest food establishment.  Nice interior, understaffed personnel, bland food. Reasonable prices, I guess.  Not going back again."
Becky B.,"Tucson, AZ",0,51,,3.0,10/12/2014,"Have been to this BJs several times. We always receive friendly quick service. Food is usually very good. BJs is a chain, so the food doesn't taste from scratch, by any means, but has been consistently good in my experiences."
Kate H.,"Tucson, AZ",68,10,,5.0,5/17/2014,"Atmosphere: A Food: A Service: A+ This was my family's first time eating at a BJ's.  My 5-year-old got a certificate from his school that was good for a free kid's meal, so we decided to check it out. What other reviewers have said about this being Cheesecake Factory-esque is true, except that it feels a lot more laid back.  The lunch menu looked pretty solid, but we were there on a Saturday, so no lunch for us! My husband and I and our two kids had a great meal.  Service was phenomenal, despite the fact that we were seated next to a large party who arrived just a bit before we did (usually death for service).  For example, my husband got the bottomless homemade root beer but mentioned to the waiter that he'd want a cream soda for the next round.  Fast forward 15 minutes when he was nearing the bottom of his mug, and the waiter brought over a fresh mug and was setting it down on the table pretty much at the exact moment that he finished! Our kids' food arrived a couple of minutes before ours, which I always love.  It wasn't like 5 minutes before, it was really probably about 90 seconds--just enough time to get them both set up with ketchup and get the crayons and kids menus gathered up so that we were ready to dig straight into our food when it arrived.  (Speaking of which--from the time we placed our order to the time the food arrived?  About ten minutes.  Nice work, kitchen!) But the best part was when, near the end of the meal, we presented the manager with our son's coupon.  He (our son) was so darn excited about it, and the manager brought him a little BJ's pin to wear, told him how great it was, and then comp'd not only his meal, but also his brother's, and a dessert for the table!  My son was so proud of himself coming out of that restaurant that he could not stop showing off his new pin the whole drive home.  As we were getting ready to leave, the waiter came back with to-go cups filled with another round of their homemade sodas. The food was yummy, the atmosphere was fun, but the little thoughtful extras like having the manager personally congratulate my son for his big achievement (he's a developmentally delayed child who met several language goals at school this year), the kids' food, the refills, the to-go cups, and comping not just the one kid's meal, but two (plus a dessert!) left me so impressed I pretty much came straight home to crank out this review.  We will definitely be back!"
Julia S.,"San Jose, CA",164,289,148,4.0,6/8/2012,"(+) - santa fe salad - steak (rib eye?) (-) - red velvet pizookie I always wondered why all the other restaurants are so empty for dinner, it's cause everyone is at BJ's! Both times I came here for dinner there were tons of people (but still plenty of tables so no wait) 1st time here I got the Santa Fe salad which was amazing! I was scarred from the shitty salad I got at Chili's so I was expecting the worst but it turned out to be extremely delicious. Everything was fresh and the chicken tasted great, loved the seasoning.  2nd time I got some kind of steak with a side of vegetables. Steak was surprisingly good, and at a decent price. Vegetables tasted slightly undercooked and overly buttery. We also ordered a red velvet pizookie which was a huge disappointment. Definitely not as good as I remember it when I had it a few years ago, did it always taste so cookie dough-y? Would have liked it to be firmer. Entrees are good here, pizookie not so much."
Adrienne M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,11,,1.0,5/9/2014,"Food is greasy and lackluster. I got some kind of ""berry cobbler"" that was dressed, I would assume mistakenly, with garlic salt instead of sugar. When I mentioned it to the server she shrugged and didn't seem too interested. She asked if I didn't want it but my drunk dinner companion had already eaten most if it by the time she had strolled by again. Yuck. That was one of the most disgusting things I have tasted in years. Will avoid BJs in the future."
Jean B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,3,,2.0,8/22/2012,"We ate here on a whim for an early dinner.  I've had BJ's before in another city and it was good.  Unfortunately, today's meal was mediocre at best.  We were seated after a short wait, which wouldn't have been bad, except that there were plenty of open tables.  Our waitress was decent, but not helpful when the food didn't turn out good. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, and the manager even came out and told us he knew it was taking a while, but didn't offer anything to address the issue, such as a small appetizer, salad or even just bread.  Even the kids in the booth behind us, screaming for their food, didn't tip them off that they should do something to help all the customers. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone and it was underwhelming.  It had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time, the cooked spinach was dried out on top and when I showed it to the waitress, she just brought out a new plate of UNCOOKED spinach.  The pasta was also dried out from sitting too long. My companion ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was fried to the point of being chewy and tough.  The ""white cheddar mashed potatoes"" tasted as if they were made from an instant mix. Finally we ordered a the Red Velvet Pizzookie.  The cookie tasted more like raw cake batter with a few white chocolate chips.  The ice cream was bland.  We ended up not even eating half of it. Despite all the issues with the food, which they were clearly aware of, they didn't offer any discount or compensation, so we ended up paying over $50 for a boring and tasteless dinner.  We will definitely not being coming back here for any meals."
Erica P.,"Tucson, AZ",1,1,,1.0,11/7/2015,"Please tell me why your answering machine says reservations for parties of seven or more when you call the person tells you if you have seven you can only call ahead.  So we waited for 55 minutes for a table for 7, completely ridiculous.  I watched them sit a party of 5 and party of 2 at table tops multiple times that could've been pushed together.  It was ridiculous that our engagement party had to wait this long.  Once we were finally seated it was then a waiting game for the waiter.  I have no problem when a place is busy but what is the point of taking reservations if you don't honor them.  And why are you contradicting the policy displayed to customers,  great management. ......"
