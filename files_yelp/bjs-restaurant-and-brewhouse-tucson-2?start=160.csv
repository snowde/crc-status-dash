Kim C.,"Tucson, AZ",25,83,65,4.0,5/5/2012,Good place to go for good food and drinks. They make their own beers and pizzas.  We come here once in awhile to get a good bite to eat. I had a burger with straw fries. I can't remember which one it was but it was mouth-watering. Customer service is always outstanding here and it is packed most of the time.
Chrissy K.,"Tucson, AZ",14,93,40,2.0,5/27/2014,"I've heard a lot about BJ's, and based on everyone's enthusiasm, I kind of expected it to be like, good. Not really. I didn't realize it would be so chain restauranty (i.e. canned menu with food so boring I felt I would have been better off microwaving myself a quesadilla). My dish was tiny and bland (scallops + rice + asparagus). The highlight of the meal was the pizookie, and come on... you can't mess up a cookie."
Gregory P.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",35,28,,2.0,3/17/2014,"The whole fam ate here for Valentine's Day. We waited for about 25 minutes to be seated. I had the California chicken sandwich. It wasn't anything special. The thin cut fries were pretty good, however. I have had comparable meals at places like Denny's, so I see no need in coming back here and paying close to 80 bucks (4 people)."
Ellen B.,"Tucson, AZ",572,145,379,3.0,10/5/2015,Slow to get order correct. Meal is cold on the table before they get all components to you.  Poorly responsive service. Likely won't be back. Staff is not interested in getting things done correctly.
Crystal B.,"Tucson, AZ",37,26,19,5.0,5/25/2015,"We had a great time here on the hubby's birthday! Fun atmosphere, great service, and some of the best damned nachos ever! We went in to try the Tatonka stout we've been hearing so much about. I don't even particularly care for dark beer at all, but what a pleasant surprise! It was so good. Very smooth, very drinkable beer....none of that heavy, hoppy taste typical of most dark beers. I actually drank two of them. We decided to try an appetizer, and I can't remember the exact name of it, but they were just the best nachos ever! Pulled pork, onions, cheese, green chili sauce...omg my mouth is watering at the memory. Green chili sauce is another thing I'm not a big fan of but this green chili sauce was amazing. Our server was awesome too. Super friendly and polite, fast...she really helped make it a great visit. What more could we ask for from a server?  Can't say enough nice things about her. Or about the rest of it. Beer GOOD. Nachos GOOD. Server GOOD. We left happy."
Ivette O.,"Tucson, AZ",42,145,57,3.0,2/28/2012,"I love their beer selections, the food not so much.  Now, I don't drink alot of beer nor would I consider myself a connoisseur of all hoppy, but they certainly have a wide selection of darks, lights, even some fruity beer.  As for the food-their french fries are good, but they are no Eegees fries. The sandwiches are mediocre and they always seem to under-cook the meat or it is only lukewarm when it arrives at the table.  Will I continue to visit? Yes, if invited to something there, but doubtfully on my own accord."
Chris M.,"Mosaic, Fairfax, VA",1,3,,5.0,9/27/2014,"We came in at 600 on a Saturday with a party of seven and were sat almost immediately. Service was great (Jessica S, just turned 21 lol) and the manager Shilo helped to make our experience great.  I would highly recommend for a quick bite with delicious beers to boot."
K M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,86,,2.0,11/9/2011,"Based on two visits. You walk into a nice, well-designed, active place, many people gathered - so it must be good, right? Well, not really.  The waitstaff --  in a similar fashion as Buffalo Wild Wings -- seems clueless & inexperienced.  Ya know, ""everybody's first restaurant job.""  Service is slow, and waitstaff has not seemed to develop that 'rhythm' that a good waitperson will have during their shift. The food was -- meh not bad, not good.  Kinda bland."
Sitha I.,"Huntington Beach, CA",143,277,53,3.0,7/12/2012,"For restaurant of this type, I must say BJ's is the best. The food quality is always good. Portions are ginormous; always sharing portions. Lots of different options and its just plain GOOD. Never have I had something that I didn't  like. If you don't know what to order, get a pizza! My favorite is the Chicken Parmesan. All their appetizers are good. Right now, I'm in love with their wings! I think it was 10 wings for 10 bucks but well worth it.  My bff told me about this raspberry beer, its amazing!!!!!! not sure if its seasonal and I'm not sure what its quite called but I'm sure if you say ""Pink Beer"" they will know what you mean."
Lauren K.,"Tucson, AZ",81,338,81,2.0,10/1/2011,"The food is just ""ok"", nothing more.  The handcrafted sodas are the best thing on their menu, and worth paying the extra money for.  Except for when the service is terrible and you can't get a refill to save your life, which is always the case here.  I've never been to a chain restaurant that has such slow, inattentive service so consistently.  The only thing that happens quickly here is the speed of your food being served to you, which is waaaay too fast sometimes.  It's basically overpriced fast food with waiter service.  I'll go back if someone suggests it, but I won't ever be the one to ask to go here."
Liz W.,"Tucson, AZ",142,214,211,3.0,7/9/2012,"Decent food, large menu to choose from.  Plus side there are Gluten-Free menu items. I personally would avoid buying alcoholic drinks here because they are over priced.  I usually order online and take my food to go, quite helpful :)"
Jessica A.,"Minneapolis, MN",1200,710,870,4.0,12/26/2011,"I wish that BJ's would expand in the MidWest. Please come to Minnesota -- I miss your Pizookie! Colleague and I dined here the other night. Super busy with all the holiday traffic, but we were able to score a high top in the bar area with no wait.  Calamari - - YUM! Italian market Salad - - pretty darn good! Colleague had the tilapia -- she said it was tasty! Coffee -- surprisingly VERY good! White choc macadamia mini pizookie -- YUUUUUMMMM! Friendly service + good food = happy customers :)"
Nancy W.,"Hinsdale, IL",2,58,,5.0,3/19/2012,"I love this place.  Saturday evening 6:30 so expected a wait.  25 minutes, but well worth it.  Big menu and loads of choices reminding me a little of cheesecake factory.  All five of us agreed food we ordered was excellent as was the dessert. Service by Jesseica #62 was perfect.  She was really on the ball...fast and very efficient.   Ambience and comfort top notch.   Loved it and hope to return many times."
Kayla E.,"Tucson, AZ",2,7,5,5.0,7/6/2014,I come in here with my fiance at least twice a month. And every time they give us the best food and service you can find in Tucson. Our waitress Olga is precious. I give this place five stars.
Michael S.,"Sedalia, OH",1,8,2,2.0,12/26/2013,Service was excellent but half the table hated their meals. Portion sizes were also all over the place. Lemon Parmesan chicken was disliked by two diners; lemon sauce was overpowering. Mediterranean pizza was just disgusting.
Mary B.,"Tucson, AZ",8,345,50,4.0,4/8/2012,"When it is time to get out of the AZ sun and time for a brew, then the Brewhouse is the place to go for all sorts of choices....speaking beer choices. And just as I had in the past, I enjoyed a meal....gluten- free pizza needs to improve, but the salads are good."
Jennifer B.,"Huntsville, AL",13,36,,3.0,11/12/2011,"Dang, people love BJ's! Went on a Friday night and there was a 25 minute wait.  This location opened about a year ago, and its popularity has not waned!  The wait wasn't so bad because atmosphere is fun and the space is open.   Husband got a huge (HUGE) baked potato with chili and their pale ale.  I ordered their gluten free pizza.  Todd liked their beer, but the food was just alright and the presentation left something to be desired.  The food isn't spectacular (def go to Renee's for GF pizza!), but BJ's kinda hit the spot for what we wanted. One question, though - how can their menu be so huge and the chefs still know all the items?!"
Missy K.,"Tucson, AZ",56,58,21,4.0,5/31/2012,"I LOVE BJ's First off im always a bit annoyed by a certain host that talks to you like he's memorized his intro script way to well and wants you to know he's memorized it... Lol! I appreciate his effort but a simple greeting and I will show you to your table is adequate!  The wait staff is always friendly here at the location of Craycroft and Broadway and they are almost always Busy.  The restaurant is clean and has a great ambiance.   I will have to say that the menu is overly crowded and I'm impressed with the beer selection. Prices could come down a bit for some of the items that aren't entirely as spectacular as their prices say they should be.  My favs:  Tomato, matzo, and balsamic salad... It's like $2 and a great starter salad Meditterranean Pizza.... yUMmmmmm!!!! The crust is excellent.  Chocolate chip pizzooki... Need I say more!?  The kids love ordering their own food off the menu. The outdoor patio is in a bad location, right off the parking lot and adjacent to the always busy Broadway st.  It's almost always too windy when we sit out there... And smells like exhaust.  But we keep coming back. Despite the cons this place delivers.... Again and again!"
Cristina U.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,2,,2.0,7/15/2014,"We ordered online and did the curbside service to pick up last night. Although the employee who brought us our food was courteous and provided excellent customer service, there were issues with our food. The two pastas I ordered for my children included ingredients I asked them to leave out, they forgot to include my husband's salad in the order (which they did call to let us know 10 minutes later but we were almost back to the hotel by then) and given that we were from out of town, having no silverware put in with the order made things especially frustrating. We will not be returning to this location the next time we are in town"
Colin G.,"Marina, CA",29,376,12,1.0,5/23/2011,"I guess that, after BJ's opened up their first location here, thus bringing the official beer index in town down a few notches, they said to themselves, ""How can we make it even more mediocre?"" And, voila: BJ's on Broadway. Cards on the table: I was really pissed off that they demolished the old El Paso BBQ place and built a whole new building. Not that I loved the architecture of that place or anything, but I'm all about reusing space and all against unnecessarily wasting materials and filling our local landfills up with the stuff that didn't happen to fit BJ's facade branding requirements. I was pushed to decide on where I wanted to go for a birthday dinner and, I don't know what possessed me, but I thought this would be a good option: it was close to who we were meeting, they have a full menu and they have beer. Now, I know better than to think of this as good beer and had no illusions of it being so before coming but, from what I've had at the northern location, this one's beer just sucks. It may be that, for a time, they were brewing the beer for the first location in Chandler and trucking it down, so maybe I had had that. After all, I'm not exactly a regular at the Oracle one. So, yeah, the house beer sucks. Fine. But why does the food have to be so mediocre? I mean, it's like if Mc Donald's opened a restaurant: it's not spit-on-your-hand bad, but it's the sort of food that makes you look up after that first bite, regretting what you ordered, looking at others and trying to scratch out some food envy and mark out who you want to try to share with. But no one's happy. And so it was. The food sucks too. But then the service sucks. I swear I recalled our waiter from a car dealership years ago (no, seriously) but maybe it was just my perception of the whole spiel. That's my general issue with service at chain restaurants: it's friendly, but slow and disingenuous. I mean, they don't give a shit that you're in there, and I can understand and even respect that. The manager is the only one who cares, but he or she will be in another job within a year. But, yeah, my birthday dinner... Luckily, we had had a ""real"" birthday dinner prior to this that was satisfying, intimate and delicious, so I wasn't devastated. But I can't really explain why I came here. I can only implore you, the Yelp reader, to not repeat my mistake. Eventually places like this, who are attempting to cash in on ""craft"" beer by thoroughly bastardizing and standardizing it, will close and something much better will emerge. Until then, don't support the Rock Bottoms, Rams, Gordon Biersch's, Granite City's, and BJ's of the world. You may not like every beer at the local places, but that's actually a good thing, as they're not trying to be safe but, instead, creative and ingenuitous."
