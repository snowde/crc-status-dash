T C.,"Antelope, CA",38,16,2,1.0,4/21/2013,"We came to BJ's for a graduation lunch.  Many of the California locations we dined with have been amazing, so we were optimistic.  After we ordered our food, we sat there for 2 hours before everything arrived to our table.  The place was not busy, yet our waiter would vanish for 20 minutes at a time.  We complained to the manager when he visited our table and he simply said ""ok.""  He did not offer us anything to accommodate our nose-diving experience, not even a few friendly words or apologies."
Jennifer D.,"Tucson, AZ",202,238,42,3.0,2/4/2012,"On Friday my office of about 10+ people went to BJs.  We were seated promptly and the waitstaff was very friendly (we did call ahead as well).   The beers are one of my favorite things at BJs.  I love the Jeremiah Red and Berry Cider mixed beer.  It was delicious!   Although, I was not impressed with the food.  I got a honey crispy chicken salad and it was just mediocre.  I have been there before and had multiple items, but this was far from impressive and it was supposed to be cheaper on the lunch menu, but my bill was over $18.   I'll go there again, but I will never have the salad again."
Ingrid T.,"Tucson, AZ",121,196,7,3.0,2/6/2012,Not great not awful.  The menu is overwhelming and I wasn't impressed.  The food again wasn't awful just not flavorful.  The place was clean however my meal was less than satisfactory just really plain.  The prices didn't seem to match the quality of the food. I doubt we will go again but if that is where I am meeting a group I suppose I'll go. The fried artichokes were good.  But again pretty bland.
Elyse P.,"Tucson, AZ",50,168,46,4.0,1/19/2012,"I'm a fan of BJs. I've been to the other Tucson location, and one in Ohio, and they're very consistent. I love the chopped salad (I get it with romaine, though ... because I like to tell myself it's more nutritious). The artichoke dip and the pear cider were yum, too. But the portions were smaller than I remembered (it's been awhile so I can't say if it was bad luck or if that's how it is now).  I am embarrassed to admit that I have not parktaken in a Pizookie, but I hear they are incredible.  The service is always very good. Overall, I enjoy BJs and will be back."
Bethany Z.,"Tucson, AZ",0,1,,1.0,9/13/2013,"Well when it comes to Gluten Free restaurants BJ's used to be our favorite, but after tonight's experience we will NOT be returning. We ordered a milk shake (not on the menu) and were charged over $15!!! Having Celiac disease I don't indulge eating out often,but this experience and poor customer service on managements part have solidified us not returning. When asked how they can justify $15.30 for milkshake the managers response was""well that is high""!!! All that being said our server Jennifer was very sweet and felt bad she had to deal with the situation. All in all just terrible management and poor resolution. BJ's is no longer listed on list of Gluten Free recommendations in Tucson purely on customer service."
Chelsea P.,"Tucson, AZ",43,43,,4.0,2/4/2011,"Went to BJ's on Wednesday night, with a girlfriend. There were tables open (it was very early in the evening), but we chose to eat at a booth in the bar area.  We were immediately greeted by a waitress who knew her beer! I ordered one of the seasonal beers that she recommended, and I loved it! My friend ordered from their regular menu, and was not disappointed either. The lovely waitress also asked us for ID, which made me feel young and beautiful. Or, at least young.  For dinner, my friend and I shared the Avocado Egg-rolls and a mini pizza. The egg-rolls were delicious - so fresh and different! The pizza we ordered was spinach artichoke. Like the creamy dip that everyone loves? But on a pizza!  It was delicious. Heavy, and certainly very fattening, but delicious! (It is possible to make semi-healthy choices at BJs. I've had salads there before, and they are delicious. So the fattening part... that was just my choice.)  Our bill was very reasonable, thanks to happy hour prices. All in all, we were both full and happy!"
Michelle C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",254,152,31,3.0,1/10/2011,"I'm always so surprised how packed restaurants are down here, when supposedly we are in a ""down economy"" etc. ... well hit up BJ's and it will feel like the opposite of that. I came here with a group of about 12 with reservations for 7:30pm. Since ""we were late"" ... by about 15 minutes they said it could be about a 25 min. wait. --- which actually doesn't even make sense but whatever. I was looking around at all the unhappy people waiting and thought to myself that 25 minutes looked like about an hour.  An hour later, they say they are just waiting for the group to leave to give up the table. Meanwhile, I find some old friends in the bar area, ditch my work peeps and pull up a chair and give up on the main table for now.   Great service in the bar - very attentive cocktail server and the full menu is offered (until 11 - then its pizza and wings only) so I just called my sis and she came and met me in the bar area for some dinner. The work group of 12 finally gets seated, while I'm on my second drink and my salad in the bar. Party of 12 eats, and after a digruntled ""you ditched us!"" they go across the street to the Cactus Moon... I stay in the bar area with my good service, w/ friends & the sis. We probably hung out there until about 11:00PM... and the restaurant was still packed! The bar area had dwindled a bit, but overall this place might be a little too busy for my taste.  The food is good - I had a house salad and a monster veggie baked potato, and it was   - but I will never come here for dinner reservations - just head straight to the bar!!!"
Michael H.,"Tucson, AZ",5,30,5,4.0,4/17/2013,"I feel guilty going to a chain but this one delivers each and every time. Service is crisp, Beers are a cut above, and the food always surprises, in a good sense. It's my default choice for Lunch."
Tyler E.,"Fort Huachuca, AZ",2,12,,5.0,9/8/2013,One word. Pizookie. This dessert is mind blowing. While eating this I swear I saw my future and it is good. If everybody tried this there would be no evil in the world. Go
Edd P.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,5.0,5/11/2015,Went on Mothers Day. No wait. Excellent food. Wait staff very friendly. The corn and bacon fritters for starters were amazing. Hubby had breakfast and loved it. Excellent Bloody Mary at s great price. My chicken club sandwich was delicious.
Ben M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,5,,3.0,5/8/2014,"BJs is a very good place to eat.  This location wasn't the best I've been to,  but still good."
Anton E.,"Tucson, AZ",219,35,3,5.0,12/17/2013,"I have been here a few times and not once have I been disappointed.   I eat out a LOT a few times a month and Bj's is in my top 2!! I LOVE the mushroom appetizer and everything is amazing!! I wish they had Vegan options but do not mind eating vegetarian, which they could use a few more of those too, even so i still give them 5 stars!! The staff is kind and bubbly and the manager even came by to welcome my girls night out group! LOVE this place and can't wait to get back for those mushrooms I have been craving since I left!!"
Michael B.,"Toluca Lake, CA",165,43,5,1.0,10/9/2010,"Rather than write a lengthy review, let's just cut right to the juicy details.  - Waited 60 minutes for a table (not a big deal as we were quoted that time).  - Sat down and waited 10 minutes to be greeted by our server.  - Dirty dishes on the table that took another 10 minutes to clear, and then they didn't even wipe the table off.  - 30 minutes after ordering...no food.  - 45 minutes after ordering...no food.  - 60 minutes after ordering...no food.  - 61 minutes after ordering a manager comes out to tell us that their pizza oven is backed up, but our other food is coming out right now. She promised to take the pizza off our bill and comp dessert.   - 65 minutes after ordering our food arrives. The chicken on the Balsamic Chicken Salad was cold, the salad was wilted, wrong fries on two orders, cold mac and cheese and nail hard bread on two sandwiches.  - 30 minutes after receiving our food not one plate had been cleared and our server stopped coming over the table.  - 10 minutes later we asked the manager for our check.  - 5 minutes later the check is delivered by another server.  - 5 minutes later the original server brings our check back and doesn't even say thank you, nor look us in the eyes.  So after 2.5 hours, we left without celebrating my mother-in-laws birthday, no dessert and not even a thank you for the patronage. Just a terribly disappointing experience."
Christy W.,"Tucson, AZ",141,27,,3.0,12/31/2011,"This place has a very expansive menu, almost too large for my liking.  They have everything!  We took our daughters here for Christmas eve dinner, and everyone was pleased with their entrees.  My only complaint was that the mozzarella tomato side salad was just about 4 bites total-way too tiny for the price. My daughter, forever the beef lover, indulged in a prime rib, and she was about as happy when they set her plate down as she is on actual Christmas morning.  Mashed potatoes-amazing!  Pizookie-to die for!  Pasta-perfect!  Handcrafted orange sodas-delish!  Total bill-ouch!  Without alcohol, the four of us paid over $80.....just mind your checkbook, but enjoy!  The food and atmosphere is great.  A bit too sporty for me, but overall, a nice experience."
Jeffry G.,"Tucson, AZ",64,42,3,4.0,12/28/2013,"Our food was good; the server had a friendly disposition and was unsettlingly smiley. He was decent - not as attentive as I would like, but he tried hard. It's a good restaurant with good people, so I'll be back!"
Denise L.,"Aptos, CA",3,12,,2.0,8/31/2014,"I have spent many hours and many dollars at BJ's Brewery in San Jose, CA and have always had great food and wonderful service.  My experience with the restaurant in Tucson on Broadway was less than stellar.  Although the waitress was pleasant it certainly did not make up for the snarky attitude of the manager and the food was just mediocre.  I can think of lots of other places to enjoy a good dinner and drinks that are just minutes away from this establishment.  I suggest you try them instead."
Erin F.,"Evansville, IN",42,75,13,4.0,11/5/2013,"Their seasonal Pumpkin Ale...sorry boyfriend, I have a new love! This is pumpkin spice latte in beer form. Perfect...all three glasses! Food is always great too, so many choices. Guess I'll have to go back and try another entree...and another seasonal beer!"
Spyder P.,"Martinez, CA",0,32,2,2.0,11/11/2013,"Service is excellent!  However, just order drinks and don't eat the food.  It's nasty....over cooked, soggy, mushy, dry and burnt!"
Tiffany S.,"Baltimore, MD",91,305,159,3.0,8/5/2013,"Great location, very convenient. This is a great place for families and groups. The menu is extensive enough to please a crowd. There is good beer. And it's hard to say no to a pizookie."
Deb B.,"Tucson, AZ",32,72,34,4.0,7/28/2013,"Had I written this review a week ago it would have been five stars because everything I'd tried there up to that point had been FANTASTIC.  Alas, their fish and chips is pretty horrible.  Stick with the burgers (the Black and Bleu and Chili Burgers are killer!), pizza and scrumptious calzones and you'll be a fan for life."
