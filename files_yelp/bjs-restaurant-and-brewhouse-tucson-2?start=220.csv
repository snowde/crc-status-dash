Samantha D.,"Pooler, GA",0,43,,5.0,7/5/2014,"We are on a road trip and have only eaten at a BJs once before in Florida. Since  the local places we wanted to try were closed for the fourth we decided to come here. It's a chain restaurant but its still really good. The pizza is always great, and I had a chicken sandwich with chili peppers that was so good. But what made this experience even better was the service. Our meal came out maybe a whole 5 minutes before our daughter's pizza. We were fine with it, no big deal. However the waiter wasn't happy and comp'd her meal and threw in a free dessert. The manager even came over and apologized. We are easy going peeps so we didn't care. But the fact that they were proactive about it was amazing. I wish I could carry them with me to every restaurant because the service was exceptional and hard to find these days. Oh and the pizookie......YOU HAVE TO MAKE ROOM FOR A PIZOOKIE!"
Cherie J.,"Tucson, AZ",1,6,,3.0,8/19/2014,I went on a weekday night with a few friends. We were able to get a table in the bar area right away. The avocado rolls were amazing but my chicken pita tacos weren't great. The chicken was dry and had very little flavor. Our server was very nice. It seemed a bit pricy for the quality but I'd be willing to try again because the people were great.
Alyn N.,"Tucson, AZ",0,13,,1.0,7/24/2013,"We would frequent BJs a lot when we lived in NV.  It was always nice to have BJs as a back up plan in case you go out with a large party.  They have a HUGE menu and everyone can find something to appeal to them.  We tried the BJs in Tucson three times.  We kept thinking that we must have just gone on an off day, but every single time the food was just bad.  It just was not fresh food at all, and when you like to get salads fresh is important!  My husband dis-liked everything he tried there, and so did I all three times.  And we were trying the same things we used to enjoy at the NV BJs, so I don't know what is wrong at this location.  That all said, the service was still very good, and cleanliness was about the same as in NV (average to slightly below average on the cleanliness, which always kind of bothered me so I am not too sad that we no longer have a BJs to go to)."
Carol S.,"Tucson, AZ",1,41,,2.0,9/20/2013,We had dinner here several times before it occurred to us that we were never served a hot meal -- everything was always served lukewarm even though the restaurant was not busy.
Aaron G.,"Monterey, CA",106,53,6,2.0,5/14/2011,"This location for BJ's has given me a few good laughs since it opened. The first time I went here, the service was the single worst thing I've experienced in my life at an established chain restaurant. Food was old, stale, sitting under a heat lamp and dried out until tasteless. And their servers were incompetent at best, weren't even familiar with their own beer menu (They tried to tell me they didn't carry Rogue's Dead Guy Ale, even after I pointed it out to them on their menu, took a manager to finally figure out that they did carry it).  This time around the service got a lot better, but I keep feeling like my food is sitting under a heat lamp for a half hour before it comes to me. I think it was the fact that my Sante Fe Spring Rolls were lukewarm when they arrived, kind of gross.  I think the funniest thing that happened to me was this last time I was there: I ordered a Union Jack IPA (mainly because their indigenous beer menu is OK at best) and 10 minutes later, some random waitress comes up to our table and says ""Who ordered the Union Jack?""  I raised my hand, then she attempts to hand me what appears to be a screwdriver or some other type of orange juice based cocktail. I said ""no, no, I ordered the Union Jack IPA""  She said ""Wait, what did you order?""  ""Union Jack IPA"" (then looks confused and again attempts to hand me the cocktail)  ""No, I ordered a beer...that is definitely not a beer""  (Walks away without a word)  About 20 minutes later, after I actually got the beer I ordered, I still see this waitress walking around the restaurant with the same drink in hand, trying desperately to pawn this thing off on someone. It was so sad, I couldn't be upset, so I just laughed.  I guess the point I'm trying to make here is, go to the other Tucson location of BJ's, they actually know what the hell they're doing there."
Bobby L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,14,,3.0,10/16/2010,"There was a 20 minute wait for a table (7pm on a Friday night) but we went right to the bar and got a table immediately.  Service was attentive but not especially quick.   We had two of their own brews and they were both excellent. For dinner we had a burger and chicken fried steak - fries were great with the burger, the mashed potatoes with the steak were lukewarm but the vegetables were excellent.   Overall the experience was a good one, and with the kitchen open late (unlike most places in Tucson), we will be back."
Susan R.,"Minneapolis, MN",74,74,6,1.0,3/10/2011,"First off it's lame that you can't have happy hour prices if you're not in the bar. I'm sitting a couple of feet from the bar, but I have to pay more...not cool. My husband had their Tatonka Stout which was putrid and my Oasis Amber was flat. They give the impression their beers are brewed on site, but I see now according to their site it's not. Why even call it a brewhouse if nothing is brewed in house? We decided to overlook the beer situation and order, we heard the pizza was pretty good so we ordered a deep dish pizza. We choose NOT to order their spinach & artichoke pizza because it had cream cheese on it which didn't sound too appetizing, so we decided to make our own and choose the three topping version with artichokes, spinach & red pepper. When the pizza came it had tomatoes on it. I asked the girl who served it to us why did the pizza come out with tomatoes instead of red pepper? She quickly said that ""tomatoes come standard on all pizzas"" and quickly rushed off. We started eating and realized that the pizza had cream cheese on it. Our server, Diego came back to see how things were and we him that we thought their kitchen made a mistake. He said that when you order spinach & artichokes they spread their spinach & artichoke dip on the pizza! We assumed that we would be getting fresh ingredients on our pizza, seriously WHO puts dip on a pizza!?! At this point the missing red peppers were the least of our concern. We should have known it wouldn't be good when the menu states their deep dish pizza is ready in 15 minutes. The pizza was barely cooked & I could touch the deep dish pan after it had been served. Real deep dish pizza pans usually can't be touched until AFTER dinner. So in a nutshell their deep dish pizza is warmed pre-made crap.  Our server knew we weren't happy with our meal, but there was little sympathy and no offering to make it up to us. After having the worst deep dish pizza I've ever had in my life I can easily say with out a doubt that I will never go there again."
Joanne H.,"Denver, CO",1,10,2,5.0,5/9/2014,"We went to BJ's last night for my husbands birthday dinner and it was fantastic! The menu has lots of different options no matter the type of mood you are in. I had pizza, my brother, husband, and mom all had burgers, and my dad had a pasta dish. Our server, Clinton, did a wonderful job serving, was very upbeat and made the experience even better. The only thing that was not top notch was that my dad's entrée came out and it wasn't very hot. He mentioned it as more of an afterthought to Clinton as he liked the dish it just wasn't very hot. Clinton had the manager come over and between Clinton and the manager they more than made everything right by bringing free dessert to try. I told the manager I loved him for the pizookie and strawberry benet. Did I mention I'm pregnant? I felt like it was my birthday :) We had a great time, and we will most definitely be back!"
Angela A.,"Ely, United Kingdom",16,6,3,2.0,7/14/2011,"The bar is a work of beauty! However the service is a work in progress.... everytime I go it seems service Is lacking or slow. The food is good, but Don't go if you have a time constraint.."
Jodi J.,"Tucson, AZ",53,59,3,4.0,12/11/2011,Love their tomato soup and the special seasonal brews. The every day brews are about average though. The wait staff has always been very nice to me when I show up for a late night dinner. Love that they are open late.
Joe F.,"St Charles, MO",7,80,1,4.0,7/29/2011,"I am an AB guy so BJ's beer is not that great to me.  But service and food are great, half price mini pizzas 10pm till close and other good happy hour deals."
William E.,"Tucson, AZ",0,11,,1.0,4/8/2012,"I generally like their beer and they do their food thing well enough. I am writing this because although the wait staff obviously has a script ""Can I get you a **** today to get you started?"", they are clearly not instructed to avoid the condescending sing-song waiter voice and to avoid the 'we' word--as in 'how are we doing today?  Are we ready to order?""  I wonder if the waitress doesn't actually know how she is doing and wants me to tell her.  Is planning on ordering something along with us?  This has happened to me more than once and will keep me from going back.  Today it was waitress #268 in case someone from the restaurant needs to know."
Bryant K.,"Tucson, AZ",54,5,,3.0,12/3/2011,My wife observed that the staff does not appear to enjoy working here. Food was average today. Soup only warm. The odd part is everything we requested had to be asked for again. The staff is not running on all 8 today.
Liz G.,"Tucson, AZ",9,133,,2.0,10/21/2011,"First off, I don't usually like chain restaurant/bars like this.  The food is overpriced, terrible for you, and the drinks are even more expensive.  But BJ's wasn't too bad.  I wouldn't have anything except for the appetizers to eat, unless you are incredibly hungry.  The ap's, especially the avocado eggrolls are OK.  The bar is what makes this a place I keep coming back to.  That, and the fact that I can drive home from here without getting on any major streets.  The tv's over the bar are spectacular, and the beer selection is huge.  I would actually give BJ's 2 and 1/2 stars if it were possible."
M K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,4.0,10/27/2013,"Im not a huge chain fan so I was reluctant to have high expectations.  wow, what a surprise.  The atmosphere was great, food really delicious and the service was out of this world. Thanks for a really enjoyable dinner.  We will be back AND recommend to our friends!"
Jack T.,"Tucson, AZ",39,27,,1.0,1/11/2011,Really like the food here however I went here today and could not believe my service.  My wife and were seated quickly only to wait for about 15 minutes for the person who initially sat us to ask if we had ordered drinks yet.  When we told her we had not been helped yet she took our drink order and about 5 minutes later they came out.  Now an additional 10 minutes went by before our server came out and said he would be right with us.  And yes another 5 minutes we wait before we can order.  we have been waiting well in excess of 30 minutes before we even get to order.  Needless to say at this point we elected not to eat at this fine establishment.  It is one thing if a restaurant is very busy and the servers are just trying to keep up and it is another when you are just not seen!!!
Carol K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,21,,4.0,11/27/2011,"After reading the negative reviews I was worried about going there for lunch today.  I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent service by our waitress Hillary and the delicious meals my husband , daughter and I had. We opted for the "" less than 575 calorie meals"". I had the chicken which was delicious and well prepared. They had the tilapia which they said was delicious. The dishes came with rice pilaf and a savory ratatouille . All in all the entire experience was very good and we will order the same things on our next visit.  The restaurant was clean and it was easy to have conversation as the noise level was not disturbing."
Jennifer S.,"Tucson, AZ",3,8,,1.0,12/3/2012,"This is probably the WORST restaurant I have ever been to. WIth the exception of 1-2 servers, EVERY single server I've had there is terrible! They are very slow to greet once we've sat down, and we actually got up and left for the fact that we sat and waited for so long. The food is not that great, either. And we were made to wait to sit for about 5-10 minutes even though the whole restaurant was practically empty! We only went there because we had some coupons. Do yourself a favor and don't ever go to BJ's, try Claim Jumper or even Chili's-which are plus/minus a mile away from BJ's."
Vicky C.,"Sacramento, CA",10,96,45,2.0,1/11/2011,"Came at 10:30pm after a wildcats game.  Yes it's a chain but I expect that... Wanted soup or something quick.  Well, quick they r not...the bar was full and there was only 1 waitress... Food was coming out slow and they were trying to serve it to the wrong tables almost every order even ours- food is good but Luke warm at best"
Stacie K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,3.0,1/11/2012,"So I was pretty darn disappointed when this place first opened up.  But being so close to the base, it's rather tough to avoid.  I managed for a while, but ended up there again with no hint of my first experience, despite being part of large parties a couple more times.  The food is good, although I stick to the lunch deals for a decent price, and the service is good now.  Nothing outstanding, but as the rating says, ""A-OK."""
