Toni H.,"Tucson, AZ",3,2,,3.0,6/6/2011,"I love burgers! Its rare that I meet a burger that I can't finish. I went for lunch with a friend. It was nice out so we say on the patio. There was no server for the patio but the hostess quickly accommodated. I had the Cuban and it was good, not amazing, but I enjoyed it and it was filling. The fries were awesome, definitely have the wedges, soo tasty. Enjoyed the  Piranha pale ale. Got my buzz, filled my gut, and didn't go broke doing it. $30 for 2 people to eat and each have a pint. Classy, comfortable, affordable, but the menu could use some additions."
Benny K.,"Tucson, AZ",545,15,7,5.0,10/31/2010,"After years of waiting for a place to go that is high class with an at home feel, I have found my utopia. The food, the staff, the atmosphere, and everything in between make this my #1 go to restaurant for any occasion."

Sandy D.,"Tucson, AZ",0,5,,5.0,10/27/2013,This has to be my FAVORITE Restraunt ever. They have the BEST Salmon Ceasar Salad.  And I love there shrimp pasta.  So yummy.  They are friendly and service is pretty fast.  You can even call ahead in order to get a table faster on a Friday or Saturday night.  I like that feature.  I think everyone should try it at least once.
Harry M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,12,,3.0,7/8/2011,"I have been to BJ's a number of times and really do enjoy some of the house beer's but not all of them are great.  The prices as others have said are expensive.  This used to be a nice ""hometown"" place on oracle and now they have changed.   Mostly the food is good but sometimes you do get bad service or the kitchen gets backed up.  It is sad that a great place has come down to the ""average"" chain style restaurant.    The atmosphere is decent but sometimes it does get a little loud when a very large crowd shows up.  Most of the servers are very nice and pleasant to deal with.  Remember be nice to the server they are doing a job that some people degrade as low..Just remember they are handling your food."
Jennifer J.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,4.0,4/10/2011,"I've been to this BI's multiple times and have always had a good experience. Their prices are a bit expensive, so I stick to their happy hour times. They have a midday happy hour and a late night happy hour (you'll have to call for times, because I can't remember them off the top of my head.) During their happy hour they have $1 off cocktails (and the bar tenders are really great! We downloaded a drink maker app, and they were more than willing and even excited to make thaw random odd drinks we found!) Their beers are also on sale, I don't remember the price. They have some appetizers for $3, and their personal pizzas are 1/2 off (so about $5-$6, normally $10-$12, I wouldn't pay full price for the personal pizzas but at happy hour, they are definitely worth it!) My favorite us he Mediterranean, and my husband loves their buffalo pizza. Their plain pepperoni is good too. Like their $3 appetizers, which includes deep fried artichokes, yumm!  Overall, I like their food and drinks, but wouldn't pay full price for any of their food outside of happy hour. The service is good, I haven't had a bad experience with a server yet."
Robert B.,"Newport News, VA",8,143,,3.0,8/24/2010,"Good pizza and a great beer selection, including some of their own brand.  Pleasant, efficient service.  Very large, somewhat impersonal interior with big-screen TVs all around give it a bit of a corporate chain sports-bar feel (it is a part of a chain), but it is well-lit, not too loud for conversation, and pleasant enough.  Good place for an enjoyable evening with friends, or watch a game, but not a romantic or intimate dinner spot.  Why not four stars?  I origninally went that way, but compared to some other places I rated four and five stars, it's just not quite there--I prefer smaller, local craft breweries."
Rebecca C.,"Tucson, AZ",55,29,19,4.0,8/26/2011,"heh heh heh, BJ's.  I loooooooooove BJ's!  okay, had to get that out of my system...great microbrew for mommy...great microbrewed root beer for the kids and one very important word which I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY IN SCRABBLE DAMMITT!!!!, ""PIZOOOOOOOOKIE""  okay, seriously...need I say more...just go there.  the only reason I didn't give it five stars is service can be hit or miss, but my food has ALWAYS been fantabuliciousness!!!!!"
Heather M.,"Tucson, AZ",66,159,67,3.0,7/6/2011,"I just don't get it. This place is always busy.  What is the attraction here? Granted, they have a huge menu, but the selection is boring and the quality is average.  Whoever dreamed up this concept must think it's better to do a lot of things not so well rather than doing fewer things very well. I've tried to like this place. I really have. I've been many times to try different things - sandwiches, burgers, baked potatoes, fish tacos, etc. Once upon a time I thought I hit a winner with the fish tacos, but as of late they've had that not-so-fresh fishy taste. I can't say I've ever had anything yucky. It's just not yummy. Nothing memorable that draws me back. The one redeeming product is their Berry Burst hard cider. It is pretty tasty. I also have friends who like the beer. Alcohol is really the only reason we come anymore. Even so, food and drinks are way overpriced for the quality. Maybe if they had super service it would make up for some of the other shortcomings but this area is just average as well. I guess I can't really expect much more than average from a chain."
Kathee K.,"Tucson, AZ",5,24,,4.0,6/6/2011,"After a long day I wanted, no NEEDED a pizza. It had to be gluten free so off I went to BJ's on Broadway. It was dinnertime and the place was quite busy, but I went to the TOGO register where I was greeted cheerfully by Jonathan. He was friendly and knowledgeable about celiac's and gluten. I ordered the pizza then went to sit at the bar for a drink. The barkeep was NOT gluten savvy & made little to no attempt to locate a safe beverage for me. I assured her I'd had some sort of house cider (gf) every time I visited. Nope. Wasn't happening. I moved back to the seat in the TOGO area. Jonathan, after hearing my certainty about a GF house cider, went on a quest for info. Several employees were asked but with no favorable results. That wasn't going to stop Jonathan though. Going well beyond the call of duty, he discovered indeed the house cider WAS gf! In fact, while I wasn't too psyched about having redbridge beer, the choice of 2 house ciders was problem solved. And oooohhhhh it was yummy. It was unfortunate it took so long for a drink to be placed in front of me, because my pizza was ready LONG before I was finished with the cider. The pizza was wonderful (as always)... and Jonathan was amazing, friendly, polite and literally my hero. BJ, give that man a raise! Then clone him! Spectacular! He's one of those people who I'd travel to be waited on by. What a pleasure. Sorry, they lose a star because of the bar involvement, (or lack thereof). Yeah Jonathan!"
Ana C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,58,3,4.0,1/27/2012,try the beer sampler and wings...and the spicy pasta with the peas or a pazooki-yum!
