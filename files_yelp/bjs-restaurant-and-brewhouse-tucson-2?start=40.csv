Andrew A.,"Tucson, AZ",91,101,,2.0,6/19/2016,"Once again we've landed here on restaurant chain island.  A place where the ambiance is welcoming, the menus are beautiful , and the food....well whatever. I'm not going to get into the long and short of why Tucson needs another chain restaurant like we need another Mattress Firm, but we are really coming into our own here and I just don't see how places like these are selling any food.   Nearly any night of the week you can find the parking lot at these places filled to the street with un inspired diners who likely drove right by the King Fisher and Feast to end up eating a personal pan pizza at BJs.  The problem is us.  Perhaps the inexpensive grub and shiny new brass poles lining the bar area are what the middle class American truly desires. Why just the other day I was in the middle of s conversation that had to do with whatever it is I'm ranting about.  And a young woman who I love dearly commented that she'd rather go to a Denny's than Prep and Pastry .  She knows that she will enjoy the American Slam (or whatever) at the former while she just doesn't know what she'll end up with at the latter.  Not her fault.  She will still have a positive dining experience.  But had she driven a little further, waited in line a little longer and taken a chance.....she may have had the meal of her life! Take a chance people. Life is too short to have an ok meal.  Try something new and see what we are all writing about!  There's excellence in this town....come and have lunch with us."
Meghan M.,"Tucson, AZ",24,1,,5.0,4/30/2017,There beer is great! I have been there at least 5 times and the food has been really good. Huge menu selection. Chicken pizza was awesome! Also has full bar selection.
Matt H.,"Tucson, AZ",55,93,71,5.0,3/24/2017,I've always liked this place. The beer is cool and the food is great. I always order the jambalaya. It's my fav!
Heather L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,3.0,9/7/2017,"Went to eat tonight and had the server Olivia. We ordered three apps only. Apps got delivered by food runners and we continued to not see our server for an actual hour. My friend ran out of tea and when our server came by she grabbed the tea to refill returned and she did not come to check us out the rest of the night. We watched her check out her other two tables on the other side and waved, I ended up having to catch her for our check which also took her another 12 minutes to return to us. The food was great but service was lacking. Disappointing because this was my first time I did not enjoy my entire experience here."
Ormond G.,"Corvallis, OR",1,21,,4.0,4/9/2017,"Friendly service, food was better than average, great selection, fair prices."
LG G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,46,79,3.0,3/7/2017,My husband and I thought we give this place a try...AGAIN... I don't know for some reason this place I think is missing something. But we did enjoy the ribs and healthy tacos it's just a little overpriced for the quality and quantity.
Whitney M.,"Tucson, AZ",2,17,24,4.0,2/17/2017,"This place was awesome for kids.  My son is 18 months, and the kids' meals have lots of choices (including some healthy ones!) and they even brought him extra fruit and garlic knots.  And the grown-ups' food was pretty good too. ;) But for lunch with kids, this is a great place, and the servers were super nice."
Aly K.,"Tucson, AZ",10,70,15,3.0,6/1/2016,"I went here for the first time the other day with my boyfriend. The atmosphere was very nice and appealing. The hostess was very nice and conversed with us while we waited to be seated. I found the food to be a bit expensive, but for the amount of food that you actually get, I really can't complain. It was pretty tasty, so there wasn't any issue with the food.  My only concern was the waiting service. I should rephrase, just our server. She was very nice, please don't get me wrong, but impatient. We barely looked at the menu before she asked if we were ready. But she was sweet and answered all the questions we had after we ordered."
Mana M.,"Tucson, AZ",57,27,7,3.0,8/16/2017,Use to go often but they have really went down hill the past year. Took my mom there and the middle of her chicken dish was raw. They did take it back however my mom ended up sick that night from contamination. Their chowder is like a thick gravy. absolutely gross. Even their Burgers have gone down hill. If we go (Honestly have not been back in months) we would only get a pizza because that is hard to mess up.
Michel M.,"Tucson, AZ",2,19,1,1.0,5/20/2016,"My $16 ziti dish was swimming in a 1/8-inch of yellow grease. Terrible, tasteless plate. Maybe BJ's does something well but not this pasta dish. Not going back."
Marcelo R.,"Tucson, AZ",2,13,11,2.0,1/20/2017,I don't like a restaurant where service push me. Food was ok. I ate seared ahi salad. Picture in the menu has more fish than real plate.
Dennis J.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,1.0,8/2/2017,"Ate at  this restaurant for the first time today. Food was OK. Server was pleasant. However I ordered a beer with my order. I never got the beer. I asked for it twice, never got it. A brewery that doesn't deliver a beer????  I also asked for mayo twice for my sandwich. Got it after I ate my sandwich. Never had our water glasses refilled. No beer and no water. I don't write many reviews, but this was unacceptable. We will not eat there again."
Wendy S.,"Tucson, AZ",10,85,204,5.0,6/17/2015,"We've been here 3 times and enjoyed the laid-back and cozy atmosphere. They have a great selection of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. I really love  the handcrafted draft root beer. I had 3 glasses of root beer once and had to stop myself from overdosing in sugary goodness. So far, we have tried the Santa Fe Salad, hummus plate, garlic chicken pesto tavern-cut pizza, salted caramel pizookie, and peanut butter s'mores pizookie. They were all very good!"
Christine R.,"Tucson, AZ",2,3,1,5.0,1/5/2017,Bjs brew house is the Bomb.  Food is always consistent and the service is impeccable my husband and I come here at least twice a week every week and we just love this place
John R.,"Tucson, AZ",21,154,,4.0,2/26/2016,"This place has grown on me much like a benign tumor.  I didn't care for it at first, but after a while, you accept it  and realize it isn't worth getting rid of it. Their menu is broad and vast.  Some items better than others.  For instance: - The steaks, though slightly salty (which I like) are really decent and lean - The chili, which many people seem to like, I thought could use some spices and more flavor - The bread bowls are a great concept and good value but, again, take some of the salt from the steak and put it in your soups and chili - The homemade sodas are a big hit, I think these are the coolest (literally, served in an icy mug) - The pazookies are tremendous - I think it's worth it just coming for dessert to get a homemade soda and a pazookie The service is a mixed bag.  I've had good 2/3ds of the time, but when it's bad, it is cardboard and forgetful.  When it's good, it is timely and friendly. What is a 5 of 5 is the ambience.  It's a touch of Great Gatsby meets sports lounge.  The restrooms are super chic and clean as well.  I like the gigantic revolving door as well when you enter. Perhaps the brightest point - I haven't had bad hostess situations here.  Truly remarkable in a town notorious for crappy hostesses.  They've got this dialed in. Overall, like the place a lot."
Daniel S.,"Miami, FL",0,102,,2.0,1/24/2017,"Had to wait an hour for our food on my birthday. Needless to say, the whole experience was soured because we were not given any sort of apology. The food was mediocre at best, and not just because we were in a bad mood. Overpriced, lukewarm, pasta that had obviously been sitting before being served. Everything on the menu looks amazing, but underwhelming and small when it comes out. Maybe we'll give it another try after asking others what menu items are consistently good."
Beth L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,4.0,4/14/2017,"We typically don't go to BJ'S because it's so far from our home, but my daughter had received a reward certificate from her school and she really wanted to use it. Cindy was our server and she was beyond friendly and helpful. We handed her our daughter's certificate, and we're very promptly greeted by the manager, Jay, who took the time to introduce himself to our table. He treated my children so wonderfully, and praised my daughter for the hard work she had done at school. We had a lovely dinner and were treated to a dessert for my daughter. The service was amazing, the drink and food were decent (hence 4 instead of 5), and we will definitely come back again. Thank you to Jay and Cindy for treating us so wonderfully."
Karen M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,2.0,6/30/2017,"It's hit or miss. Overall I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  Tonight was a miss.  I had tomato bisque, and shrimp  and asparagus penne.  I was pleased that bj's is putting calorie counts on the menu, and then totally puzzled.  A ""bowl"" of soup that's about 10 spoonfuls spread on a shallow plate is 560 calories, while a plate of pasta enough for two, plus a roll, has 730?  Yes, the soup was greasy - in a really, really tasty way, I have to admit -  but if 560 calories is correct, I was basically drinking oil with some tomato sauce mixed in; normal tomato soup is about 150 calories a cup.  That might be right, I could actually see flecks of oil separating from the soup, but I bet it could have been made with a bit more flavor and less fat, for $7 is should have been.  OTOH, the penne was ridiculously under-estimated, there was at least half a pound of pasta on that plate, I'd estimate 1000 calories, maybe more, not including the sauce or the roll.   In addition to being unable to rely on the nutritional information given, the penne was seriously bleh.  It was overcooked, there was a soggy rogue crouton hiding in it, and when I pay $16.50 for a plate of ""shrimp pasta"", I'd like to see more than five. My husband had the ribs and was unimpressed - again, it's hit or miss, the last time they were very good\, this time dry and not meaty.  And his tortilla soup had a big lump of potato in it - not horrible, but not supposed to be there either. Finally, our friends had a coupon for a free meal that the waiter forgot to add in, and it took nearly 20 minutes to get it sorted out and corrected.  My take-away:  don't go on a busy night, don't count on the calorie count, and (from another visit) definitely don't order take-away, the portions are smaller and inconsistent, and the food may be sitting there for hours or not ready when you arrive, regardless of lead time."
Aaron H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,13,,5.0,6/18/2017,Pazookies are worth the extra time on the treadmill. Usually not a long wait and great menu. Will return.
Ariel N.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,2.0,6/9/2017,"The food is good, but I always get terrible service. I'm leaving this review sitting in BJ's and have been waiting 15 minutes for a server to initially acknowledge me."
