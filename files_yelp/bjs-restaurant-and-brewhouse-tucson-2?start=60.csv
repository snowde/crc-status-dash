Hotrod R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,12,2.0,11/23/2016,"Waitress was nice, but she would always disappear. (Not to other customers, to the back)  So much so that when we asked for the check(after waiting 10 min) we flagged down another employee to send out a search party. 5 min later she surfaced (I thought I was going to have to order breakfast) All around service was slow"
Michele J.,"Tucson, AZ",319,178,98,5.0,1/24/2015,"Excellent service! I cannot rave enough! We sat at the bar and had an amazing bartender/server - Thomas - who is very friendly and on the ball, without hounding or pressuring.  I had the half rack of baby back ribs - fall off the bone delish with asparagus and brussle sprouts and Kevin had the Asian noodle salad with roasted tofu. I like to order hot water with lemon slices, which they provided at no charge. Thomas suggested combining their Berry Burst Cider with another beer, so Kevin did half and half with their Nutty Brewnette. Malty and sweet balanced with a tart cherry finish, it was outstanding. We watched the UA game - they have a huge screen and many TVs around the restaurant. We enjoyed the food and casual atmosphere - we will be back!"
Kelly L.,"Tucson, AZ",65,365,98,3.0,1/3/2015,"decent for a chain restaurant.  like many, the menu is too large and it gets annoying to try to read through the 20 pages to decide on what to eat.  They do have a smaller portion/lower cal menu which was great - made selection easier since this menu only has a handful of options.  I had the shrimp tacos from this menu and really enjoyed them.  I was full when done but not overly so, which was perfect. There was a wait (there usually is) and a hostess brought around small slices of pizza for everyone waiting which I thought was really nice  of them.  They have those buzzy things that they give you to know when your table is ready.  They said the wait would be about 20 minutes for a table for 2 and they were right - it buzzed me right at 20 minutes.  The service staff was really friendly and kept our drinks filled throughout the meal.  The seating is spread out enough that you don't feel like you're hearing everyone elses conversations and they have plenty of TV's around the room to occupy you if you run out of things to talk about with your dinner companion :-)"
Halley K.,"Tucson, AZ",7,41,9,4.0,6/27/2016,"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile , and this weekend I finally have ! Walking in, you can tell it's kind of fancy. Its beautiful to say the least. My friend and I ordered the peach sunset tea, and I honestly thought it would taste better. It had a strong unappealing after taste even with a bunch of sweetener. We ordered the spinach mushroom appatiser and oh my goodness.. That stuff is amazing. For our meals my friend ordered the chicken Alfredo noodle plate and I ordered the deep dish ravioli. Food came out quick, and hot. Both our meals were great and hearty. We could only eat half and take the rest home because we were already full! I would definitely eat here again. Probably just not as much as I'd like because it is pretty expensive; for just my friend and I our bill was like 42$."
J K.,"Everett, WA",0,2,,5.0,2/2/2017,"Food is good, beer selection is great. Lizzette , our bartender and server was awesome as well as the rest of the staff. Always consistent and fun. I'd recommend it to anyone that wants good food, drinks and especially service."
Brianne H.,"Vail, AZ",17,52,39,4.0,2/13/2016,"BJ's has a fantastic happy hour. It's the number one reason I come here. Not only does it run until 7, but they give a 50% discount on all appetizers, flatbreads, and mini pizzas. There's a lot of items to choose from. They also have beer specials. Sure they're a chain brewery, but their beer is still very good. I'm a fan of the blonde. My husband likes the pale and the red. Some of the seasonals are also great.  I've never gotten a table from the hostess and ordered a full dinner, so I can't review that part of their food and service. When I come here I always sit in the bar area and order an appetizer or two for a small dinner. The bar area (including the tables) is open seating, and it's usually easy to find somewhere to sit. Service is usually fast. My favorite app is the avocado egg rolls (which don't actually contain eggs). The sweet tamarind dipping sauce sets them off perfectly. I'm also a big fan of the potato skins. The mini Pepperoni Extreme is also great.  Parking can be a bit of a challenge at dinner time, but there are plenty of spaces farther away if you're willing to walk. It's conveniently located in the central east side. I'll keep stopping here when I'm in the area!"
Mark G.,"Tucson, AZ",7,23,33,5.0,2/21/2016,"Not often do you go to an established lunch and dinner place and say let's try brunch but hands down one of the best in the city for brunch. The pancakes, the french toast and the potatoes were all so tasty and don't forget the 4.00 dollar mimosa. Great food and service and because they don't tell the world they do brunch its not rushed or over packed but they will get to that one day I'm sure of it."
Julie S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",195,67,251,5.0,9/27/2015,"We have eating here all weekend because of soccer tournaments in town , this Turley  is the best BJs around , service outstanding .team members backing each other up and fast service on food .  Today they ran out of chicken wings and they took off what my son Order to make up for it for not having it . Joe our sever was amazing about everything , funny , always knew when we needed refills , even brought out two glasses Of water fore each of us cause he knew we had been outside all day  The food was great , couldn't have ask for it better , spot on, with temperatures, seasoning and the looks ..  My Husbsnd even went back in to tell the manger how impress he was , we eat at BJ's all the time from Puyallup Wa, to Airzona and all stops In between . At twice a week . So this was great to see . Some of the other BJs should take a visit to this one . Come in and see for yourself , prices not high , middle of the road and food for the pickiest eaters , great variety big portion"
Erik G.,"Huachuca City, AZ",0,7,,2.0,9/20/2016,"The restaurant is really nice. Great atmosphere!  Unfortunately, their food is disappointing. I've been there four times now. I've been unsatisfied three out of the four times. The only thing I did like was soup, and who knows what can they get got that out of. Worst of all is the food is way over priced.  My check is contributing to the rent for prime location, and the black button up shirts the staff wears."
Antoine H.,"Tucson, AZ",33,19,,4.0,3/29/2017,"The ahi salad is exceptional.  The service is good but the meals take some time to get.  The rewards program is great - they are constantly sending me discount coupons and buy one get  one free coupons.  Racquel has been my server and does a great job.  Nice place for lunch, but plan on an hour for your meal."
Kim C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,1.0,10/16/2016,"Don't ever be a call ahead during the day. Night staff- amazing. Large party after a charity walk- all servers btw. Our two servers acted annoyed from the beginning. Tried to order from the server taking my friends order next to me, was told the other server was my server so he couldn't take my order. Cut to the end- every time any one asks for anything it seems to pain the servers- water, drink refills, etc. then my debit card goes missing and the server asks me to ask my fellow guests because ""they must have taken it because I don't have it""... talked to the super sweet manager after coming back- but I've never been given so much attitude from servers in my life."
William B.,"Tucson, AZ",172,732,203,4.0,6/8/2014,"BJ's is one of those places I never think about going to, but when I drive by I'm like ""Hey let's go."" It's a strange place which seems to cater to a large senior/military crowd (at this location at least, since it's not far from the base) and offers discounts and some kind of loyalty program.  The service seems fine, as this is the third time I've been to this particular location. You are greeted and seated and set up with stuff. None of it is fantastic by any means but not bad in any way. The lunch specials are quite a deal. I came away full from a caesar salad and half a classic turkey sandwich with some wedge fries. Very tasty. In the past I've had the half flatbread pizza and liked that too. I've never had drinks at this location, just water or tea, but they do make good beers at the other BJ's.  There are places I'd much rather go in town but this one seems predictable and quality and that works for me- you know what you're going to get."
Rhonda Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,33,,5.0,7/4/2016,We had an excellent meal here! The ribs were phenomenal and the sirloin was seasoned well. We also had the salted caramel pazookie for dessert and that was delicious! We will definitely be back here!
A P.,"Tucson, AZ",2,350,,2.0,5/16/2016,"Oh dear... the last 3 times I've been here something's gone wrong. 2 of those 3 times they messed up my order and gave me the wrong food.  And the very last time I went here, there was a long hair mixed in with my food.  Nasty!  Definitely lost my appetite after getting someone's hair in my food. Not sure what's going on but 3 out of 3 times means something is going pretty wrong at this place. I won't be going here for a while, guarantee that."
Charles Z.,"Strasburg, PA",16,4,,5.0,1/26/2017,"After a misunderstanding regarding the Happy Hour stipulations, the assistant GM addressed our concerns, resolved the matter beyond my satisfaction, and invited me & my co-workers back in order to meet us.  Upon our return visit, we were given fantastic customer service and extended Happy Hour.  Great menu selection & great craft beers."
Carianne C.,"Tucson, AZ",13,158,13,2.0,11/1/2015,"I just wanted a salad and a glass of wine. I wanted something simple near home where I would not have to dress up. We ended up at bjs. To be healthy, I ordered the kale and brussels sprouts salad (add chicken). Can you squeeze a little more sugar into a salad? Seriously. Blueberries, grapes, dried cranberries, sugared pecans, and strawberry vinaigrette. Hardly any chicken to be found. Or Brussels sprouts. I really wanted a healthy option, but this kinda sucked.  Ok, whatever, what do you expect from a chain restaurant? The service was awkward. Bill dropped before plates cleared (personal peeve). Ech, meh. no need to return."
Peter H.,"Glendale, AZ",0,8,,5.0,7/22/2017,one of the best restaurants in town. try the greek pizza i think its called. it has blue cheese and olives. it is literally the best pizza ive ever had
Darin O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,7,4,1.0,1/8/2017,"Well, this was my FIRST TIME at BJ's, and honestly could not have been MORE disappointed.  We went on Saturday night after a matinee movie, and it was fairly full....I am sure due to the football games on.  However, we decided to sit in the bar area, as to avoid the wait for a table.  Yes, there was a wait, and TONS of open tables...which as a former GM of a restaurant, I could see was due to either A. Understaffing...or B.  just not moving people through at the HOST station.  To clarify, I AM TYPICALLY a lay down and VERY patient customer, and having been in the ""biz"" even yesterday I was as well.  We had to seat ourselves, and ASK for a booth to be cleaned.  Then, we sat down, and when the server came over to say hello, the woman I was with asked her to wipe off the table, as the dishes had been removed ONLY.   She ""grumped about it, and came back and wiped it down.  That was the beginning of the end of our experience.  I had to ask about any specials.  Nothing was explained.  She was rude, and paid ZERO attention to us.  We ordered drinks, and 3 appetizers to share as they were HALF OFF due to the NFL game.  That part was AWESOME!  We ordered the Avocado Eggrolls, a Sausage & Cheese Mini deep dish, and the Rootbeer glazed wings.  Wings were good, but WAY overcooked.  I like them crispy, but that should be a question that the servers asks. I dont know how they got that way, but they were about a 7 on a scale of 1-10.   Avocado eggrolls, were horrible.  Period.  Nothing but avocado and eggroll.  Nothing else.  No flavor, no fillings, nothing.  Lastly, the deep dish.  Came to table cold and got really cold fast.  Undercooked, and NOT at all what I would consider deep dish.  If I had paid FULL price for these apps, I would have sent all back.  We never ever saw a Manager, or even someone who Looks like a Manager.  We arrived at 530, left at 715,....and still noone..   I agree with many of the other reviews.  sterile.  No personal attention.  Nothing to make it memorable.  I would have given it NO stars, but there was one girl working in the bar area..blond hair/glasses, who was really sweet, and greeted me when I walked in.  That was it.  To add insult to injury, server left our dirty plates on the table the entire time, and dropped off the check without a word.  THEN, had the audacity to pick up the tab after I paid for it, WHILE WE WERE STILL SITTING THERE!  Didnt know they had a membership program. No training here, no evidence of management, no nothing.  I could turn this place around, but I dont think they could afford me!  :) 0-1 star is best I could give it.   It will be interesting to see if anyone responds to this..."
Jack M.,"Vail, AZ",0,2,,4.0,1/7/2017,Arrived 20 minutes early and even though there were very few people seated we had to wait until our reservation time to be seated.  Food was good however we were overcharged for happy hour items.
Gene T.,"Tucson, AZ",52,298,409,1.0,3/20/2015,"Why did I order anything. Ordered a burger and side salad. The salad was drenched with dressing. They did bring a different kind of salad (not the same nice salad ad before) with dressing in the side. The burger was tasteless. Bacon raw. Bun greasy. Just bad. Sent it back. The server did not say anything. Gave me the bill and apologized forgiving so many dimes for change.  I paid for the food I did not eat. Paid $12 for something I never ate.  There were no apologies, no small discount, no reference to the uneaten bad food what-so-ever."
