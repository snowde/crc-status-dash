Drew P.,"Tucson, AZ",52,225,225,3.0,2/25/2015,"So, I like bjs despite my 3 star rating. The reason they get 3 stars is the food is hit or miss. They can't cook the correct temp on a steak if they tried 20 times. I have ordered steak 4 times medium rare it cones out medium well to done. The night manager isn't helpful. Although, the servers are always nice. Which really helps.  The avacado rolls are so good and the wings are really yummy. I tired the Cajun pasta needed spice bad. Now, the cheese mashed is 2 die 4! Most of time is so good ;)"
Chrissy B.,"Portland, OR",0,30,11,1.0,5/15/2016,"Are you kidding me! Worst experience ever! I called ahead for large group seating. The reservation didn't matter ... We still has to wait an exuberant amount of time. They didn't seat us for 8 ... And in a booth no less. Hello? Large group, booth??? After the painful wait to switch seats to accommodate our entire party. Also I was given a broken high chair. It took another painful amount of time to get drinks ordered... Then some more waiting for our food.... Drinks were never refilled...bottom line the list could go on.... But you get the idea. Even for a larger party... Lunch should not have taken this long. Especially, when the place wasn't packed! Our food was good... but the service was seriously the WORST I have ever experienced in my life. Very disappointing. Our lunch turned into a wasted 3 hours. Thanks BJs!"
Arminthia V.,"Baytown, TX",2,21,2,3.0,12/5/2015,I def enjoyed this place.  Great for beer. The food was pretty good.  The food is a bit pricey for the amount that they give.  The waitress we had was very sweet and patient.  Will be back for drinks.
Jordan O.,"Tucson, AZ",22,52,19,4.0,4/3/2016,"As most may know from my eatery experiences and reviews I tend not to trend to the chain places. So why is BJs an easy spot to come back to? BJs isn't the only wide variety of beers on tap and updated sports bar decor, but indeed it is a very conveniently placed restaurant allowing the most food deprived individuals to get their meals and drinks served fast. The down side of 4 stars is my Sriracha chicken mac and cheese didn't pack as much heat as it probably should have, it was lightly portioned for a dinner Hardy meal, and the service was mediocre- but for a fast place to eat at 10pm after a long day BJs is an easy go-to. Bon appetite!"
Jennifer C.,"Saint Louis, MO",112,421,790,4.0,3/28/2014,"Blackened Salmon w/lemon Chardonnay butter a definite must have when you visit.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the sauce you want to ""sop"" up with a biscuit (figuratively).  Anywho...don't miss out on this dish.  I also had the pleasure of trying some of the Santa Fe Spring Rolls and Spinach Artichoke dip...they were not a disappointment.  Looking forward to my next visit."
Yuwei C.,"San Diego, CA",28,43,28,2.0,1/21/2015,"Nice roomy areas to socialize with large groups of people. However, the food is really not very good. My fish tacos were bland and the taco shell was limp and flavorless. The guacamole and salsa were very average. Other times I've come I've gotten salad or burgers. I'd recommend sticking with burgers and fries, which are decent. The salads were generic- similar to something you'd get at a fast-food restaurant.  All in all I'd come back for a drink but never again for food."
Saba B.,"Tucson, AZ",371,431,79,3.0,2/20/2015,"The half-flatbread and salad is a good deal, and BJs does its mall-outskirts, reliably-generic family-friendly, revolving-door late lunch pretty well. The late happy hour is a bit confusing, but maybe they're aiming at the après-mall crowd. High praise at BJs is ""reliably satisfying."""
Shijie F.,"Sunnyvale, CA",220,256,334,4.0,2/26/2014,"BJ's, like the Cheesecake Factory, has an enormous menu that makes decision-making extraordinarily hard. This is a sit-down restaurant slash sports bar slash brewery of some sort. I have been here both for lunch and for dinner. I personally prefer coming here for lunch, mostly because it is less crowded and food is slightly cheaper (also smaller in portion as a result). During my most recent visit, I had chicken limone on angel hair pasta, which was a full-price item, but it appeared very small for the price. My co-workers got the lunch specials, which were so unsubstantial that they could have come out of the kids' menu. Food tasted good nonetheless. Anyhow, if you are counting calories and still want good food, BJ's is an unlikely good lunch spot for you."
Yves J.,"Plant City, FL",30,180,6,3.0,2/28/2016,The service was great as usual. The prices are always good. The hamburger was dry. In fact both my burger and my wife's burger was dry. They were skimpy on the guacamole.  I was really looking forward to that burger.  Everyone else's meal was good.
Colette W.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,14,,2.0,10/21/2016,"I saw an ad online  for $10 off of $35.00 so, I printed it out and we headed  over to BJ's.  We ordered the calamari for an app and it was not very good at all, tasteless and rubbery. We were seated outside and the two tables next to us had the used glasses just sitting there the entire time we were eating. Extremely unappetizing, to say the least. Our entrees showed up, I had the New Orleans Jambalaya with chicken, shrimp and andouille  sausage and it was overly spiced, not too hot but, just way too many competing spices, it was a very confusing experience for my palate. Plus, there was about 3 bite sized  pieces of andouille sausage in the whole meal. That was just weird. The ratio of chicken and shrimp to sausage was just so off that it ruined the whole meal. My hubby had the rib eye steak and we had to ask for steak sauce because it tasted like plastic. My partner is a true carnivore so, for him to leave a half eaten steak on his plate, well, it just says it all.  The waitress was very good with filling our beverages when we needed. Although she was not warm or engaging and that is a bummer when you want to have a memorable dinning experience. We will not be coming back here. I have no idea how this restaurant gets as  many good reviews as it does. That's quite the mystery."
Tex F.,"Dallas, TX",0,25,1,5.0,8/4/2015,"Not one complaint.   Upper class joint with middle class prices.  Beer and pizza's are awesome.  Friendly staff, clean place."
Preston J.,"Tucson, AZ",3,33,13,4.0,3/26/2016,Loved my lettuce wraps and my tomatoe mozzarella salad. Service was good. I will be going back.
Jim B.,"Tucson, AZ",13,52,29,2.0,11/7/2014,"Eat here all the time. Had the flatbread pizza which was very good. The calamari was really bad and I had the waitress take the plate away. She didn't seem care much. Overall, the worst experience I ever had here in what has always been good with really good customer service.  Better luck next time I hope Jim"
Anna U.,"Tucson, AZ",3,18,11,4.0,3/5/2016,My daughter got a reading award for a free dessert so we came here to redeem. The manager Jay came over and shook our hands and spoke so sweet to my baby. He really took the time to care which makes him top notch in my book... I'm sure he is just as caring to his employees which is awesome.
Brian H.,"Westside, Buffalo, NY",142,127,252,3.0,12/4/2013,"I tried two of their house beers which were both excellent. I'm willing to bet they're all strong offerings. I also ordered a new menu item I noticed - the fish and chips. What's better with a pint than fish and chips? I was sold. When the food showed up the fries were great and even came with malt vinegar. However, the fish was over fried. I mentioned it to the extremely friendly and helpful waiter who quickly took it away. I explained that I didn't need another, but I wanted to point it out for the benefit of the next customer although I was immediately offered another.  When the check arrived I kind of argued with the waiter as it had been completely removed. It was a new item and they were glad for the feedback. He wouldn't take no for an answer! The fish deserves a second try, but the beer and the service were awesome. I'd consider this a safe bet for a few beers and some food with friends."
Marcie T.,"Tucson, AZ",4,15,2,4.0,3/16/2016,The service was good the place was clean the chocolate ale was fantastic our food was very tasty   I cannot wait to try their Sunday brunch
Scott C.,"Charlotte, NC",0,37,6,4.0,12/7/2014,This place is excellent. The people who work here are very nice. No problem coming solo they welcome you.  Beer is cold and food is very good. They deserve 5 stars but I give too many of them out.
Christina R.,"Tucson, AZ",172,116,72,3.0,8/20/2013,"This place is okey dokey. I only seem to go here when I'm meeting a group of people, and someone else decides BJ's is the place to be. At my latest trip to BJ's, I met up with a group of about 10.  When the last 3 of us arrived, there wasn't enough room for us at the table (awkwaaaaard) so the server said we could adjoin our table with the empty one next to us...but then walked away.  There was another server standing by this coveted table, but she wasn't moving it, so a couple people in our party got up to help.  However, she then said she needed that table for another party. (clearly, there was some sort of miscommunication between her and the server who told us we could use it).  But alas, after standing around awkwardly for about 5 minutes, she said we could have the table and she'd set the other party up elsewhere.  The food and drink is almost as spectacular as our entrance that night, but not quite. I will say the coconut on the Thai Shrimp Wraps is a delectable surprise! But my Chicken Club sandwich and fries was simply mehhh. My boyfriend and one of our other friends had a beer flight and I was super impressed that the server could just look at the beers and tell what they were! However, the Hopstorm IPA wasn't my cup of tea.  The IPA flavor (that is a TERRIBLE way to describe beer, I know)  I hoped and dreamed for just wasn't there. Side note: one of my friends always makes fun of me for liking IPAs (rude) but he liked this once because, as he said, ""it didn't taste like an IPA."" Next time, I'll stick with a mojito!"
Kathy N.,"Tucson, AZ",235,375,643,2.0,3/16/2013,I've been to BJ's before and am not really impressed but a few in our party last night wanted to have dinner there before we hit a show last night so we arrived at 8pm and managed to find a table in the crowded restaurant. The UA had lost against UCLA in the PAC-12 championship just moments before so the packed house started to clear a bit.  Our party of 5 stayed with the beer menu and sandwiches/burgers. My french dip was just ok. Not exactly piled high with beef and the horseradish served along with it was B.O.R.I.N.G. No spice or flavor to it at all. I enjoy stouts and porters but found the Tatonka Stout to be too smooth and lacking in any flavor on my palate. Service was nothing to write home about as clearing our dinner plates so we could talk and enjoy the last of our drinks seemed to be a foreign concept.  BJ's seems to draw a good crowd so maybe it's me????
Ashley A.,"Everett, WA",46,25,5,5.0,2/27/2016,"We drove by and decided to stop and try  this place out, they had a great tap list and a thick menu! A lot of choices we both enjoyed our meals and drinks! Staff  was attentive and knowledgeable!"
