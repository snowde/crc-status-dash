Mo O.,"Tucson, AZ",129,38,60,5.0,12/10/2017,"Came here on a busy football Sunday day. They were very accommodating. Our server, Baja, was great! He check on us regularly and apologized for the delay in our drinks and food before we even had a chance to even get ""mad"" about it. Like i said it was a busy day so the kitchens and bar were backed up, but he was able to keep our minds off of it completely. He even offered us a complimentary mini pizookie at the end, for seemingly no reason which was so kind of him! He seriously was one of the best servers i had  As for the food, i highly recommend their broccoli cheddar soup. I also decided to try their Pink Cadillac Martini today instead of one of their brews and i was not disappointed. My other half got the Paradise Mule and loved that as well!"
Jonathan T.,"Tucson, AZ",2,23,37,3.0,8/26/2017,"Just your average restaurant. I was not wowed by the food or any one staff member.  I got an $8.00 lunch special of unlimited soups and salads. I ordered the Cesar salad, cheddar broccoli soup, and their clam chowder. The clam chowder was not very good. The cheddar broccoli soup was very good however the  salad tasted very fresh.  When I got there I let my waiter know that I was on an hour lunch. There was no sense of urgency on our visit and I was almost late back to work. Normally I would not comment to this but it was not very busy on the day we visited and so I found it strange they could not accommodate our 1 hour lunch.  Overall 3/5 stars. I may return if I am in the area for the soup and salad lunch deal.  I will not go out of my way to attend for lunch. I might give dinner a shot sometime."
Tracy S.,"Tucson, AZ",17,111,188,4.0,7/13/2017,"Good! Came here to watch game 7, sat in open seating to wait for a friend and got seated at a table in that area that had a good view of the big tv.  Got jambalaya which is delicious! Just spicy enough, so if you like really spicy food, you might need to ask for more spice. Otherwise, good flavors, chicken was moist and not dry!!! Yum! Rice was perfectly cooked, shrimp is small but also not dry. Good! Got traditional wings, they're drizzled with sauce instead of being tossed and covered in sauce. Good! Hot sauce is kinda watery though..? Husband got sliders and wedge fries. Looks good, had a fry myself, tender and moist and crispy and just good.  Despite being busy and having to wait a wee bit longer for food, it's good! 07/12/17 Came here for dinner, our waitress had some issues with their tablet ordering device, no biggie, just slight wait.  Sign up for their VIP thing! We get bogo entree coupons pretty often!  This time tried the quinoa bowl with salmon. I didn't read the ingredient list but it's quinoa + rice topped with sautéed mushrooms, spinach, tomato, onion. Mushrooms taste like mushrooms, spinach was fresh and earthy, tomatoes packed a lot of flavor, onions were not super detectable to me. I'm more of a bland eater so these ingredients that had I think minimal seasoning was really good for me. I could taste the different ingredients! I ate half + some of our order of wings and was good. Kept the other half for another meal the next day.  Tried their sunset peach tea and it's quite good! Just light peach flavoring and very refreshing."
Anthony P.,"Tucson, AZ",2,50,4,3.0,12/26/2017,Come here if you have a bunch of people who don't know what they want to eat. Service is good. Beer is mediocre. Price was just ok. Kinda high for dishes other than burgers. They messed up the wife's burger but corrected it quickly.  Probably a place I definitely would not crave or become a regular
Branden H.,"Tucson, AZ",42,5,,1.0,12/12/2017,"We ordered this for lunch today. Went on line placed the order. Everything was good. Then we got our food. (We are a couple blocks down the road. So it should be hot right?) It was cold, fries were over cooked and cold. The chilli was in inedible. It had so much cheese you could not taste anything but cheese. Salad was sad looking barely covered the bottom of the container. Was not a good experience. Will not make that mistake twice. One guy had to go and get Wendy's."
Gib M.,"Tucson, AZ",158,76,154,4.0,7/16/2017,"Really have enjoyed their slow roasted meats. We had the pork chop one time and now the prime rib. Both were very well seasoned and juicy. One of the best we've had out. The prime rib comes with soup or salad, 2 sides, and a pizookie. Lots of food."
Mikaela H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",8,83,85,4.0,7/10/2017,"I have loved bjs for a long time now because I love apps and bjs has a lot of choices.  With that being said I don't eat at bjs for their service or quality of food because half the time I do eat here the service is slow and mediocre and the food is equal to an apple bees and a little disappointing but I always come back.  However ! Yesterday we ate at this location because I'm in town visiting my mom and here was a group of 30 of us wanting to eat after an event. I called 20 minutes before we came and they had all our tables ready right when we walked in. this was an early Sunday evening. So that was awesome!!  Our server , I really wish I remembered her name but she was awesome! Constantly at our table checking on us, we got our food faster than I ever have at a bjs and there was so many of us!!! And the food was really good! My stuffed mushrooms that I order every time was so perfect and fresh. Last time I went to another location they looked like sad little shriveled mushrooms.. There was too many of us to talk about everything we ordered but a few people in our group got steaks and prime rib, I personally wouldn't usually order that a chain restaurant like bjs but they loved them and were very satisfied!!  I did try for the first time the monkey bread pazooki and OH MY GOD. It was the best thing I have ever eaten.  Over all for the first time ever I was actually impressed and satisfied with a trip to bjs !!!"
Deb P.,"Tucson, AZ",27,2,,5.0,11/21/2017,"I love this place, especially at the holidays when they have special craft brews.  My husband is ill with Alzheimer's and has digestive issues.  The staff is always accommodating to his needs. We especially enjoyed our enthusiastic and friendly waiter, Daniel, today."
Kyla T.,"Tucson, AZ",109,51,74,4.0,4/23/2017,"Stopped by here with friends for some drinks after dinner. We sat at the bar. The bartender was nice enough to change the television to the basketball game that we wanted to watch. I got a strawberry margarita, which was delicious! My friends got beer. The atmosphere was busy, but not too loud so we were still able to chat. Overall we had good service and a nice time catching up."
Tom L.,"Angwin, CA",19,5,,5.0,11/16/2017,Delicious food. The CLASSIC RIB-EYE is unforgettable!
Olivia W.,"Tucson, AZ",2,23,4,1.0,12/10/2017,"Friendly service, but that's about all I can say. Ordered take out, I don't know what I expected, but I didn't expect to eat a microwaved chicken breast and a $30 large pizza. Next time opting for late night Taco Bell or Pizza Hut- a fresher choice."
Robert S.,"Mesa, AZ",1,10,29,3.0,3/15/2017,"Very loud and a bit slow on service. The manager did apologize... Our server was doubling as a host and that made it awkward to ask for anything. I ordered the California chicken club. It was easy to eat, but still fairly greasy. Very old fries came with the dish."
Stephen G.,"Oracle, AZ",0,3,,4.0,11/23/2017,Good job with burgers..but burger ordered rare to medium rare came out well done. Nice beer selection.
Joaquin C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",98,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Ordered food from this place online it took them Two hours to deliver it. They said the order did not came with an address which is BS, they did not even put the effort in contacting me to ask for address. Besides that the food was cold. Horrible experience wouldn't recommend ordering from there"
Madelynn F.,"Tucson, AZ",44,71,16,4.0,6/10/2017,Love the pazookies!!!! Sooo good and so many different flavors. They have the regular size and a mini. They have weekday specials so I always check those out. I love their cream sodas. The root beer wings are really good too.
Sara R.,"Tucson, AZ",69,90,3184,5.0,9/30/2016,We did call ahead seating for a party of 7. We were sat as we walked in. Our drinks were brought to the table within a few minutes. We ordered three appetizers before the meal. Two came out at the same time and the last one came minutes later. Our main entrees arrived as ordered. Our server kept the drinks full the whole time. The food was hot and tasted great. Our server David was friendly and quick. He kept everyone happy and gave us service with a smile. It was a great experience. The only problem we had was being to full to eat a pazookie.
John M.,"Peoria, AZ",4,215,161,4.0,10/22/2016,"I have not been to a BJ for some time,  and was quite surprised.  we had a ravioli dish that was just yummy, (so about a week after visiting this location on our trip to Tucson AZ we went to the location at the 101/northern in Glendale) and was informed they no longer have it.  we were totally bummed.   our server was very efficient and paid close attention to our table,   we were so please I gave him a 30% tip,  he made our visit very nice.  I am total sorry I couldn't remember his name to give him a thumbs up.  but I am sure he know he does good and he earned his tip"
Steve G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,219,10,2.0,2/18/2017,"BJ's now serving breakfast? Somebody at BJ's ought to do their homework. 9.3% of the U.S. Population has diabetes. 0% of this BJ's has sugar free syrup for their pancakes. Not only did they serve me without the option of sugar free syrup or jam, the eggs I ordered came overcooked. I lost my desire to enjoy what I ordered. I ate three bites On the positive side... Great servers and found the nice BJ's app. UODATE: I received a blah blah blah canned boilerplate response after my review. Tacky. I can only surmise quality control and good customer service aren't important to this business."
Marco C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,30,1,5.0,11/25/2017,Favortie restaurant in Tucson. I have been going here for years.  The food is great the staff is friendly and the beer is cold.  I love their beers and like that every quater they add some new brews to their list.  I also like that their beer is cold.  Great place great service great workers.
Ashley J.,"Tucson, AZ",67,310,214,4.0,7/17/2016,"Came for the pizookie and the pizookie trio did not disappoint. The ""pro"" is that instead of 1 pizookie flavor, you get to have 3. Variety is the spice of life, right? More is always better! BUT, the ""con"" is about the amount of center ""goo"" of the cookie. You know what I'm talking about,right? The part that was just a little undercooked so its all gooey? To me, that's the BEST part of the pizookie. The problem with the trio is that they're smaller than the normal pizookie. Each of the mini trio flavors only had a single bite of ""goo"" in the middle. In comparison, normal pizookie has about 4-5 bites worth of ""goo."" So you're missing out on some of the BEST part of the pizookie by going with the trio. I know what I'm talking about. I'm obviously a connoisseur. Yes, a pizookie connoisseur.  ; )"
Tiffany M.,"Tucson, AZ",78,116,64,4.0,12/12/2016,"I enjoy going to BJs, just don't go as often because of the price of the food.  On this last trip my family shared the chicken wings and calamari as appetizers. The chicken wings were pretty standard: decent sized, buffalo sauce - exactly what you'd expect. The calamari was delicious and did not last very long. The addition of putting lemon juice on top of it really made the dish and produced an addictive appetizer. Definitely a favorite here.  I wasn't expecting my parmesan chicken to be so huge. The potatoes were delicious, steamed broccoli was pretty standard, but I absolutely did not have room for all the chicken. Not a complaint, just pure observation here. The chicken itself was decent. I loved the crust, just didn't have room after all the calamari, potatoes and broccoli I ate. Good stuff.  Our waitress was attentive and met all our needs. I was a bit shocked at the price of the tab, but I was paying for five people as a treat to my family - a new level of ""adulting"" that I'm evidently not quite ready to take up.  Our wait was a bit long, and we had to wait outside because there were several other parties waiting. Luckily, the Tucson winter wasn't too bad, but two small benches seem silly in a busy restaurant to accommodate demand. My biggest complaint would be how dark the facility was. Although I had no problems, my dad couldn't read the menu and I chuckled when I saw another table take out their flashlight feature on their cell phones to read. If we weren't the only table who thought of it, I think it needs to be addressed. The lighting is dark and intimate, but the tube-shaped lights limit visibility to anybody outside the sphere of light offered by your current fixtures. The menu is also overwhelmingly large. My only suggestion would be to perhaps have a separate drink menu from the food menu, so we're not flipping through what can only be described as a 15-page menu back and forth to make a decision. I know this is beyond this location's capabilities, but it's just a suggestion for corporate.  Great food, good service. I've been here before and will likely come again. I really miss their chicken marsala, but their range of food never disappoints."
J. S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,95,65,4.0,7/22/2017,"We celebrated a birthday & promotion at the same time here and we  it! Our server was on point, even on a Friday night during peak hours... From the atmosphere, to the food, and to the drinks we had a great time! The prices were well worth it. Good looking out BJ's!"
J J.,"Tucson, AZ",7,18,,3.0,7/29/2017,"Stopped in for lunch on Thursday and were seated in Bar area! Our Server was not the most informative, didn't seem familiar with menu offerings or just didn't feel like servicing customers? She was not very personable! Food was good, place keeps busy, nice atmosphere! Seems to attract seniors and those on lunch break!"
Ali M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,2.0,7/12/2017,"Popped in on a weekday afternoon, husband and I were both off early, and it was just before 4:00pm. Figured we could grab a quick happy hour snack/early dinner. We sat ourselves in the cocktail area after talking to the hostess.  Now I know sitting in a bar/cocktail area can lend to iffy experiences, but this cocktail area appeared to be very well staffed. The restaurant was not busy, though it did start to pick up slightly around 5:00.  Things seemed to be kind of off from the start, I chalked it up to the group a couple tables down from us that seemed to perhaps be employees? (all were in street clothes) but various ""working"" employees seemed to keep visiting the table for extended periods of time. Including someone who looked ""managerial"" though I never saw him again after the group left.  It was very noticeable the amount of tables who at various times were looking around for their servers... Everything just seemed to take way too long with our server. After we sat, I got up to use the restroom, came back and waited a few more minutes before we were greeted/drink order taken...so that is what, at the very least 5 minutes? Then it took about 5-10 minutes for the drinks (two waters) to arrive and our food order to be taken.  The food came in a standard amount of time for a selection of appetizers (which is all we ordered, what with it being happy hour), but then we didn't really see our server again. He would walk by, and not refill our empty beverages, and stop to talk to the table of what I think may have been employees, but we had to stop other servers twice to ask for water. (lots of ice in the glasses) I think he checked in once while we were eating, to his credit.  The group left about midway through our time, but alas their absence didn't improve the service... After we had finished and had been sitting for awhile, he stopped by and asked if we wanted a pazookie. We declined, and then proceeded to wait about 10-15 minutes before the bill was dropped off. After waiting another 10 minutes (I was keeping time at this point because what the hell.) we got up and asked the hostess and the server chatting with the hostess, if they could run the card. The server went to find ours and our server brought the receipt back to the hostess stand...apologizing saying he didn't see the card ready in the bill holder...but I'm assuming that's because he was chatting away at the end of the bar with another server.  He proceeded to blatantly watch me as I went to sign the receipt, so I went ahead and asked if he was going to watch and he said ""oh no, I'm just waiting to take it back""...so glad he decided to start being on top of it at that particular moment...when it really counts... The food is mediocre and very standard, so you would think a chain like this would hold something like service to a higher standard..."
Michelle B.,"Tucson, AZ",44,133,207,5.0,5/3/2016,"Good atmosphere. Delicious food.  I highly recommend the avocado eggroll appetizer.  They currently have a lemon-blueberry pzookie special, and it was so delicious. I almost wish that I had not eaten anything other than this!"
A O.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,5.0,6/10/2017,"The service was great, the food was great, the atmosphere was great, what more can I say well done and thank you BJs"
Maxwell M.,"San Diego, CA",86,434,155,4.0,9/12/2016,Have some very creative food options. Their bison burger was stunning! Their beer brewed is house is very average. Their red and stout are their best beers!
Tricia L.,"Central Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ",7,4,,5.0,9/17/2017,"I came here after visiting Colossal Cave Mountain Park. The service in the beginning was great, until the food came. My party of 3, we had the prime rib special and the bison burger. We told the server to split our prime rib, with extra plates for everything. When the food came they did not split ANYTHING. When we asked for plates and condiments it took a total of 15 minutes, which I had already begun sharing from the one plate. Our server was more concerned with a loud party that sat behind us. The prime rib was good, however the sides of French fries were over cooked and too crunchy for someone with permanent braces like myself to handle without breaking the titanium I have in my mouth. The Brussels sprouts that I was very excited for were charcoaled and burnt. When I ordered new fries they were still over cooked and I didn't even bother to complain again. The service was completely awful and the server barely interacted or helped with anything. The food was good, the burger is a must get! However when ordering our pizookie, the server noticed me writing this review, and the manager covered part of our meal, apologized for the poor service and food, and rewarded us with a $20 gift card. Completely turned our experience around. I found it a little sad that the only reason we stared to get better service was once they realized I was writing a review, but I was very happy with the turn around."
Taylor S.,"Tucson, AZ",17,101,165,3.0,4/7/2017,"I wish I could give BJ's a better review... I really do. Because I picked it, it was nice inside, and the service was fantastic. The food on the other hand, was incredibly forgettable. So forgettable, that I forgot I even ate here a few months ago. I had the barbacoa chicken, that I had high hopes for. Only to find out it was  a piece of grilled chicken, rolled around in taco flavored seasoning on a bed of rice with bits of tomato, black beans, and more taco flavored seasoning. It could have easily have been a frozen dinner from Safeway. The truth is, the restauramt has great curb appeal to draw in customers, but the food doesn't deliver. Not for the money they're charging. There are better places in town to get American style pub fare. Sorry, BJ's."
Megan C.,"Tucson, AZ",13,113,41,5.0,8/13/2016,"I've been going to BJ's for years and always have a great experience. Their waitstaff is always excellent, and the food always turns out great! I think a salad may have arrived late once. Other than that, great experience.   I have tried a variety of different entrees and have a few favorites. Their balsamic glazed chicken is absolutely delicious. It strikes the perfect balance of greens, potatoes, and chicken. I always have leftovers! Same goes for the parmesan-crusted chicken. This is a restaurant with an extensive menu. It even has page numbers to guide you. Luckily, there are a variety of options, so anyone in a group can be happy eating here. They have an extensive collection of beers and specialty cocktails. I really like that they have seasonal items, so I often try something new that's only around for a limited time. Recently, I tried a beer cocktail with peach and juice added to it. Delicious! I've never had a bad drink here. The highlight is dessert. The pizookies are amazing! They have a few classic options and seasonal choices for pizookies as well. I loved the pumpkin white chocolate one last fall. Years ago, they had a red velvet one, which I wish they would bring back! That was probably my favorite, but you can't go wrong."
Claryssa A.,"Tucson, AZ",14,14,26,2.0,4/27/2017,"Just last night I came to celebrate a sister's birthday. We were a pretty large group for the most part. The waitress did a wonderful job accomodating for our large party and she was the only one tending to us. We waited a while to order waiting for the rest of the group to show up. Once we were ready  I ordered the Seared Ahi Salad. I've had it many times before. And it's one of my favorite light dishes there. We waited about 30 mins for our meal which seems reasonable for a big party. The #1 thing that really turned me off was when I recieved my food. The Ahi was clearly old and I said something about it to make it very clear I was unsatisfied. The manager assisting with handing out the food assured me that it was ""definitely fresh"". I played along with it but it was clearly not the best looking. I started eating my salad i tasted my first bit of ahi and immediately spit it out in front of everyone. I was right it was old. It was slimmy and absolutely unacceptable. I was baffled that the cook even released that dish as the Ahi was very bad. I asked the waitress if she could bring me actual fresh Ahi. She did. I got the fresh serving of Ahi and I was even more stunned to see the difference just enforced my thoughts that I was served bad fish. That is what really ticked me off. How could you send something like that out to a customer? And then to tell them its fresh? I showed the waitress the difference and even she agreed that it looked gross but still tried to defend the manager saying it wasn't his falt.  In my eyes it is very much a fault and  you should know this food better than I do and if it doesn't look right it shouldn't be served to a customer. I really didnt want to make such a huge scene as we were there to celebrate a birthday and I was not about to ruin that moment but the food was disgusting. Even though I recieved a fresh serving of ahi after that one bite of the old slimmy ahi I was grossed out."
Sean M.,"Oro Valley, AZ",0,9,,4.0,4/25/2017,"BJs is the chain you've come to know and expect. They have a overwhelmingly large amount of menu options, but I tend to go for their happy hour which I would definitely recommend. They have 1/2 price share plates and mini pizzas from 3-7 on weekdays and I believe it's a dollar off their house drafts. I've always enjoyed their own branded beers. This location in particular has an extremely friendly and attentive wait staff."
Sarah S.,"Tucson, AZ",200,133,4,1.0,12/27/2016,"It's been over 2 months since my horrible visit. Still no call or email from their company, management, or staff. I got a comment on my yelp page from their manager about a month ago (weeks after my visit), asking me to stop in and talk to him. No apologies, no phone number, nothing. I think this guy really believed I was gonna go out of my way, to the other side of town to talk to him. Sorry, that's shit customer service. Why should I inconvenience myself when I already feel shafted by my experience at his establishment? Clearly he doesn't care all that much about customers. But that's cool, I'll spend my hard earned money elsewhere."
Jerry G.,"Tucson, AZ",19,546,162,3.0,6/24/2016,"Stopped by here last night with some friends for dinner after work. I got the Bacon Guacamole Burger.  The guacamole had some rock hard pieces of avocado, so eater be ware.  Over all the meal OK, the burger was cooked rare just like I wanted and the string fries were tasty.  Everyone seemed to like their meal.  At the start the server was not around much, but as the night wore on she became more attentive."
Jinny H.,"San Antonio, TX",76,164,460,5.0,9/19/2015,"I went to BJ's to watch the football game with a few of my friends. We knew that other places, like Applebee's or any other restaurant on campus (ex. Frog and Firkin) would be super crowded, so we sought out another place that wouldn't be too packed. I'm glad that we chose to go to BJ's. It wasn't crowded at all and we could focus on the game and have conversations without having to shout. We sat in the bar area, so there were lots of TV screens. The bar atmosphere was awesome as well, with the bottles organized in a very neat manner.  The service and the management here was amazing. The server checked in quite often, and was very attentive. When I walked into the restaurant, a waiter immediately asked me if I was looking for a group of people, and walked me to them. Although there was a good amount of people within the restaurant, he made sure to make us feel cared for. I had one of the best services that I've experienced. I got a cider and a salad, both of which were delicious. The cider wasn't strong at all; it was fruity and sweet, just the way that I wanted it. I believe it's one of the more popular kinds of cider that they have, and I can see why. I would recommend it. As for the salad, I got the Asian salad with the dressing on the side. The salad was huge - I couldn't finish it all, but I enjoyed every bite of it.  Lastly, I want to comment on the restaurant's cleanliness. I know that I sometimes take restaurants and their level of cleanliness for granted, but I've gone to some restaurants where their service and food is fine, but their restaurant is unclean. BJ's was spotless, both in the restaurant and in the bathroom. I was impressed, actually, by how clean it was. So... 5 stars pretty much sums this place up. Great service, great food, great atmosphere."
Don L.,"Tucson, AZ",1,28,32,3.0,10/16/2016,"I've been to BJ's twice and liked it both times. The service and the food are pretty good and it's a fun place to go to. Avoid the pizza (not too bad, but any full pizzeria in town serves much better.) BJ's is not a pizzeria. They had a new menu item today: Spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles... Excellent. If you order this dish make sure that you have them add sliced avocado. The BJ's app is fun to use."
Mrs S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,41,,5.0,4/8/2017,"I honestly had never heard of BJs before moving to the area, and now my husband and I eat here whenever it's my turn to pick a dinner spot. The food selection offers something for everyone in the family.  I also should add that although it's a busy restaurant the service is excellent! Ok last but most important you have to order the pizookie or you will never know what comfort dessert is all about!"
Taylor B.,"Tucson, AZ",166,76,84,5.0,7/25/2015,"I see no reason not to give it 5 stars! My wife and I both really wanted a good burger! My wife got the Brisket Bacon Burger(picture below) and I got the Crispy Jalapeño Burger! They bot were amazing, I added bacon to mine for $1 and it made it even better.  I got the skinny fries and my wife got he wedges, after seeing the skinny fries I thought I got dropped off but they were actually more tasty than the wedge fries! We don't usually get dessert but we got a pizzoki! It was amazing!  Service was great, we loved our server. She was very polite and personable. We will come back for sure!"
Gina C.,"Honolulu, HI",0,14,2,4.0,7/22/2016,"Just went here for the first time the other night for their happy hour. 1/2 off appetizers and pizzas and drink specials as well. We got the California pizza, boneless chicken wings and $2 beers × 4 - the bill came out to $20, not bad. While I enjoyed the pizza (thin and light) the chicken was super salty. It reminded me of frozen chicken  from any grocery store."
Gabriel R.,"Tucson, AZ",1,3,1,2.0,12/27/2016,Three tables got there food before me anhd the waiter crappy server boi #stepyogameup
