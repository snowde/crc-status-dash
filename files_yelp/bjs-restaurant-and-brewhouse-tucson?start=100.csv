Emir A.,"Tucson, AZ",2,41,2,4.0,9/18/2014,"Usually very happy with this place, great steak friendly service but does take a long time for the food to come out to the table"
Cheryl M.,"Huntingburg, IN",194,439,302,3.0,1/9/2012,"I like BJ's but don't love it. I wouldn't mind coming here for a football game to do some beer tasting, but as for the food, I think its just average. Not superb but not completely distasteful.  Our service is usually always good which is nice. Honestly when you give me a huge restaurant with a menu that takes me an hour to get through, I usually shy away. The menu is so big and the portions are huge, so if that's for you, this place may be a 5. For me however, it brings my ratings down. Like I said, I'll come back for football!"
Ron R.,"Tucson, AZ",56,184,2,4.0,6/22/2012,"Hold on!! The salads here rock!! The Santa Fe blackened chicken salad was actually a hearty meal!  I'm usually a high carb, pasta, pizza kind of guy so salads aren't really my thing.  I was totally surprised!  It just looks really hard to look tough with a salad in front of you. My Yelp reputation is at stake here!  I was drinking a beer so I think I'm good;)"
Vanessa Y.,"Orlando, FL",28,9,2,5.0,7/10/2014,"I've really got to give BJ's 5 stars because of the plethora of options they have on their menu. Every Sunday evening my husband and I toss ideas as to what we want for dinner, whether it's Italian, American, or Mercian, BJ's has it. I've always been extremely pleased with every meal I've gotten there and I am particularly obsessed with their fries! They are so crisp it could eat them all. I highly recommend going to BJ's and if you do, you have to try their pizookies!"
Caryn S.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,19,,3.0,3/6/2013,"Traveling with 3 children and 8 adults, we for sure wanted firm reservations for a Saturday night dinner, but when we got there at 6:30, we had to wait for a party of 20 to clear out. 40 minute delay with 3 hungry children? Not pretty. We had studied the menu and asked to order drinks and food at once, which couldn't be done because another table ahead of us was waiting to order their food. So drinks first. Then the kids' meals (a nice gesture, but then they were done eating before we even started).  I ordered the Mediterranean pasta, which was supposed to include Kalamata olives and capers (not a one on the plate) and sun dried tomatoes (two pieces). No bread served with the pasta; doesn't that seem odd? Don't count on taking anything home either. Portions aren't that large. We'll try someplace else next time."
C H.,"Del Rey Oaks, CA",5,64,24,4.0,5/25/2015,"2nd visit this month and 2nd great visit.  Lillie in the bar is amazing! Casual and comfortable, while friendly and knowledgeable.  Happy hours 3p-7p every day (even weekends) will bring us back often. :)"
Christina C.,"Tucson, AZ",27,123,38,5.0,9/16/2011,"I have always loved BJ's from the moment I stepped in. Service is good, pizza always well cooked. When I order my usual Burger it is always well-done the way I LIKE IT. Portions of food is generous for the price in my opinion. Broccoli cheese soup is very good, lots of broccoli and they top it off with extra graded cheese. Jambalaya has a little spice/kick to it and lots of shrimp. Save room for dessert!  Chocolate Chip Pizooki is amaaaazing :) It comes out nice and warm topped with vanilla ice cream and whip cream if you desire."
Stewart C.,"Tucson, AZ",8,35,,1.0,1/16/2012,"Yikes...  This is the second time I've been in and for sure the last.  Went there with a buddy and his parents for a dinner and to watch the fiesta bowl.  Got a kinda cool booth, I'll give them that.  My menu had multiple bloody fingerprints on it, yeah blood, no mistaking it.  I gave it to the waitress and made a point to her that somebody REALLY needed to clean it.  Doubt it happened but whatever, I didn't want to start the meal with some talk about blood and a manager coming over and apoligizing... I can get over it. I ordered a Bud, the waitress really wanted me to get one of their beers almost to the point of annoying. The food was pretty lame and took almost 25 min between app and entree... that's a heck of a fire time.  We had some fried articokes or something to start. So boring I can barely rememeber them.  I had a Jalapeno burger and so did my buddies dad, a new item of theirs apparently.  My buddies dad had to send his back cause the meat was actually raw! Cold! and mine was scortched... uh weird!  His mods were all wrong too.  The manager was acutally first to the table for checkbacks and she handled the whole thing well except it took almost 20 min to get another burger at MR... should of been a priority back there.  We took it togo.  My buddies mom and him got lettace cups that they described as ""obnoxious"" and ""way better at PF Changs!""  The waitress said sorry and ""enjoy what you can.""... Check Please!"
Karl S.,"Anchorage, AK",79,658,530,3.0,5/24/2012,"It's a chain brewpub. Decent beers. Decent food (The avocado rolls arevery good.). Service good. But, I'd rather spend my money in local establishments."
Sam W.,"Tucson, AZ",3,7,,3.0,6/1/2014,"Food is excellent, their Pizookie is a must try. Have yet to have a beer that I liked. They have baked potatoes the size of a football. Go for the food but order their imported beer."
Anthony H.,"Tucson, AZ",3,30,2,4.0,8/3/2011,"I like BJ's.  There menu is large and has many options.  From a baked potato as a meal, to their delicious pizza, huge salads, and creative appetizers.  Also, I have head this is the best place to get a pazookie.  I feel overwhelmed when looking at the menu since there are so many (too many) options.   Service is usally pretty good.  We have had a few bad experiences there, not many.  The place is always packed but seating wait is no longer than 1/2 hour.  The place is really nicely decorated and the atmoshpere is pretty neat. What I like about this place is their beer selection. Brewed locally, they have house beers that apply to any taste. Lightswitch Lager, Brewhouse Blonde, Harvest Hefeweisen, Piranha Pale Ale, Jeremiah Red, Nutty Brewnette, P.M. Porter, Tatonka Stout, and a seasonal beer for every season.  They really have every shade you can be thirsty for.  None of it is the best in any category I have tried, but it is not bad for enjoying with a better than average meal.  Plus, they have these 1/2 gallon ""growlers"" (like glass jugs"" that you can fill with the beer of your choice to take home."
G H.,"Tucson, AZ",0,2,,5.0,6/2/2014,"Just had my daughters Birthday,Graduation dinner.I would like to say BJ'S did a Fantastic job.The Food was great the service was great.The servers were very attentive to all our needs.The management went out of thier way to make this a Great Event.                                    Thank You All Very Much                                   The Herrera family"
Peter H.,"Tucson, AZ",39,69,1,4.0,2/20/2014,"We have had lunch here several times, and enjoyed it. One word if you can get there prior to noon you'll get seated promptly and served quickly. Good food & atmosphere. Their new Black & Blue House berger is out of this world."
Ambrosia R.,"Chicago, IL",39,124,5,4.0,12/13/2010,"I've been here a few times, and been moderately impressed with the food each time.  My husband and I are fairly picky about pizza, since it's one of the dishes we regularly make at home, but BJ's pizza holds up extremely well - their chicken-pesto appetizer pizza in particular is tasty.  Also, I love the avocado egg rolls - just the sort of creative fusion of flavors that I like to see in a restaurant. Professional drinker that I am, I tried their brew sampler the first time we went.  It was a bit of a mixed bag; the blonde and stout offerings were both surprisingly bland with little complexity of flavor.  On the other hand, their Piranha Pale Ale was beyond reproach - crisp and refreshing and featuring an herby finish that to this day I can't quite identify.  It was easily one of my favorite pales that I've ever tried.  I also tried one of their cocktails on a different trip - a raspberry lemon drop, if memory serves - and while I liked the idea, the execution really lacked pizzazz.  I'm certain I could come up with something better, given the ingredients and some time to experiment. On the whole, I'd recommend the place for lunch over dinner:  the service was rather slower during dinner hour, and the light coming in through the windows at lunch helped the atmosphere of the place quite a bit.  But I'll almost definitely go back again.  Still have most of the cocktail menu to try, after all..."
Roy P.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,1,,4.0,3/6/2014,It was great beer and outstanding appetizers! Especially the chicken wings were perfect.  The roast beef sandwich was also a winner. We  will be back !
Steven G.,"Tucson, AZ",40,93,7,5.0,7/13/2011,"I love BJ's!! (hehe) I've never had a problem here and I actually just went here because I just recently turned 21. Their service is pretty good and their food is amazing. I highly recommend any of the pastas which are even great for sharing because they come in such large portions. They also have a great drinks menu and I would recommend one of their own brewed beers but I don't remember the name. (It's the one thats similar to Blue Moon in taste).  More about the service, my waitress was very nice and one of my friends even got another pizza because something was wrong with their first one which is unheard of in many places.  My favorite dish is definitely the Cajun Pasta with Shrimp, its actually my go-to entree at BJs.  Food: 5/5 Drinks: 5/5 Service: 5/5 P.S. free pazookie on your birthday? definitely deserves a 5 star :p"
Ben D.,"Ashburn, VA",0,2,,1.0,4/25/2015,Went to Bj's tonight...not very busy. Ordered a pizza and it came out lukewarm. Bartender sent it back to be heated up. Manager was there and was told about the situation and disappeared into the kitchen to check . The pizza came back out room temperature AGAIN...never saw or spoke to the manager (hiding in the kitchen I guess).  Bartender offered free dessert but we just wanted hot pizza...took the leftovers and heated it up in the toaster oven...bartender tried but manager was useless
Rachael J.,"Portland, OR",20,232,3,4.0,10/14/2010,"This location must be hit or miss. I guess today I had a hit!  Went at lunch time on a Thurs and the place was packed. Actually had to wait about 5-10 mins. My server was very attentive. I had multiple refills and she was happy to answer our questions and make substitutions (which seems to drive so many servers bonkers). I had no problem finding an affordable lunch option. for $12.50 including tip I had an iced tea and a lunched sized salad which was much better than I expected and I left full and satisfied. I think people may come to BJ's with their expectations a bit too high. I gave it a 4/5 star rating taking into account that this is not, nor will ever be a fine-dining establishment. This is essentially a nicer Applebee's with a good beer selection on tap. They have a large menu with lots of your standard American bar food options as well as a good selection of salads, samplers and gluten-free options. Prices are a bit higher (though not unreasonable in my opinion) than many other chain restaurants of this caliber but I thought it was worth it to have a more extensive menu and decent beer."
Maile C.,"San Diego, CA",1,56,,3.0,4/13/2015,"Friendly service, meh food.  Clam chowder had the largest clams I'd ever seen, which made up for the odd taste.  Plain house salad maybe out of a bag.  Might be a good place for folks who like to watch sports."
Paulina N.,"Tucson, AZ",163,72,58,3.0,7/17/2012,"The food is usually good. However, the service is always lacking no matter what time of day or day of the week. I wish there was more I could say, but I'm never really impressed with this place. Especially this location."
