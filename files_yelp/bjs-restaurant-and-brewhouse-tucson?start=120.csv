Nick B.,"Tucson, AZ",1,12,3,4.0,7/28/2013,Love the crested chicken Parmesan. Service is hot or miss but atmosphere is good for dates for two or larger parties.
Kim H.,"Lakewood, CO",5,50,7,4.0,3/31/2010,"My review is primarily because of the service - excellent all the way around.  We were greated with a genuine hello by the hostess when we entered and our server made great eye contact (and even knealt down at the table to meet my kids at eye level.)  She was very attentive and didn't act rushed even though we could tell she was busy.   The food was basic bar fair, nothing spectacular but everything was hot and the items the server suggested were good.   I know this is a chain, but I would recommend it as dependable for families."
Ray C.,"Denver, CO",25,190,113,3.0,2/18/2013,"At this time of my visit, I had my sesame chicken salad and it was just OK.  Because of the chicken was COLD..  It was supposed to be hot and fresh..   Again it depends on the chef on that evening."
Kevin G.,"Tucson, AZ",0,14,2,1.0,11/17/2015,"I suppose you can't ask too much of a chain restaurant.  But I felt the need to share this experience.  Went in for a quick unplanned bite to eat with a good friend after work the other night.  We each ordered one drink and some food.  I wasn't too hungry, so just settled for a simple side salad and a side baked potato; it was all I really wanted that night.  I was very annoyed that my regular-to-small sized, undercooked and mushy on the outside, hard inside potato that had also sat so long that it was all yellow inside... was $8!  That was as much as my Manhattan that I upgraded to a more top shelf rye.  This is not a fancy steakhouse.  And I did not get some one-pounder baked potato stuffed with all sorts of high quality fixings.  I had a really bad side potato that I put a small amount of butter and sour cream in, some green onion, and avoided the really really greasy unappetizing bacon that came with.  If I had known I would have been spending $14 for a small side salad and a potato, I would have just ordered an entree for the same price.  I would assume the entree potatoes on the menu were not what I received."
E K.,"Loomis, CA",2,73,14,3.0,1/30/2013,Pros: food was delicious Cons: service was awful! We went in with a group and they couldnt get or keep the orders straight. They had 3 waiters/waitresses taking our orders no wonder they were confused. A friend ordered a fancy drink. When she got it it wasnt the drink she ordered. When she was 3/4 of the way through it the server came by with the correct drink she was supposed to get and demanded that she needed to take the old one back to the bar. Bad service in general.
Arielle Z.,"El G.H.E.K.O, Tucson, AZ",0,21,3,5.0,11/8/2014,"Awesome restaurant! The cream soda is so so good! i ordered the unlimited soup and salad, and the broccoli cheddar soup is stellar, probably the best I've ever had! Salads were great, fresh, and unique! Service itself was great, but the only thing greater than all of that was the prices! Just under 8 dollars for unlimited soup & salad! Will most definitely be returning to BJ's!"
Sandy S.,"San Diego, CA",15,43,20,3.0,8/26/2013,"Sliders were good. Thai chicken salad had almost no mango, could not taste the salad dressing or find anything but lettuce and some avocado. Very low value. For 11.50 i expect a really nice salad. Manage did not seem to bothered by it. Lots of places to eat with better food for the money. JMHO!"
Kayla B.,"Tucson, AZ",66,67,1,2.0,1/13/2012,"I don't think i will be going back any time soon. The service was terrible to be quite honest. The waiter seemed in over his head and did not know what he was doing. our waters were constantly unattended , the appetizer took 45 minutes to get to the table. The people next to us got there meals before we even got our appetizer and they were seated after us. The server also screwed up the specials, drink specials, the bills, and what drinks we ordered. We were nice enough about it but I know I wont be going to BJ's for quite some time."
Stu M.,"Folsom, CA",3,6,1,1.0,12/9/2013,"Cold pizza, bad service, no wonder it's never busy (unlike most BJ's)! Does corporate ever read these reviews?"
Jen P.,"Portland, OR",0,30,,4.0,3/26/2013,"We did have to wait 30 mins (but on a Friday after work, come on who wouldnt expect that) and once seated recieved a half off coupon for a pizza! nice touch BJs!!! Beer was yummy, calamari as an app was delicious (not greasy) and the turkey burger with fries was a great way to wrap up a rough week. Our server, Octavio?, was friendly but not pushy while being patient as we were deep in conversation.  We will be back for our half off pizza and hope to catch their rocking happy hour at the bar sometime too!  PS apparently you can call ahead which we will utilize next time ;)"
David L.,"Woodstock, GA",4,18,8,4.0,9/15/2009,"I am a big fan of brewhouses and this was very nice surprise.  I am visiting Tucson and was surprised to find that this is a chain.  They are non-existent on the east coast.  The restaurant itself is large with a very open lay out and high ceilings.  The settings is typical of restaurant/breweries.  The waitstaff was friendly and service was excellent.  We had a new server who was with his trainer.   The Beer: BJ's offers the typical 'Sampler' of their brews - 6 styles at 5ozs each for $9.  As far as styles goes nothing special here: Blond, Hefewiezen,  Pale Ale, Red Ale, Porter, Stout.  I found all of the drinkable except the Pale Ale which is heavily hopped (I don't care for Pale Ales in general so take that into consideration).  The Hefewiezen was surprising light and crisp with a citrus flavor. The Surprise: BerryBurst Cider - apparently they also brew their own cider and this is sweet and fruity and delicious. The Food: I had an open faced meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes and onion crisps, which was very tasty and for the price more than enough food.  Overall 4 stars for quality of food, beverages, service and price.  If you want a casual atmosphere and beers and dinner with friends with out the price then this is a great choice."
Lorie A.,"Tucson, AZ",49,39,50,2.0,7/6/2010,"the best part of the meal was the order of kettle chips. Sadly, the meal went down hill from there.  I ordered a california burger that came on toast (?) The server said that it did say that in the menu, but honestly the light was so low and poorly placed I must have missed it. The very gracious server did offer to switch it to a bun, which I took him up on, and I was pleased that very hot, seemingly fresh fries came back with the burger. But that burger :(  Ordered as medium, it was over-well and dry. And the ""California"" on it was tasteless: green chile, avocado, chipotle mayo? It tasted bland with no mingling of flavors. Seasoned wedge fries were good, though.   We also got the mini 'pizcookie"" sampler. Overcooked tube cookies baked to a rock in the bottom of a tin pan. Topped with a scoop of ice cream it was edible, but only half the cookies could be removed even when mooshed in with the ice cream.  With a price of $8 for a speciality pomegranate drink and $8 for a coconut and lime martini, you'd think that there was at least a slight buzz of happy hour on me. Nope.  I've never spent so much on such weak drinks.   maybe their strong point is the beer? but there are too many other local brew houses with menus that aren't meant to stay in the shadows."
Kathy C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,7,,4.0,12/31/2012,"We stopped here on Friday afternoon around 1:30 ish for lunch.  We sat in the bar and was served quickly.  We ordered from the lunch menu.  I ordered the MahiMahi Fish Tacos and my son ordered pizza and a ceasar salad.  I ordered iced tea to drink, my son had water.  We both enjoyed our lunches, but decided we'd try something else on our next visit, as they didn't stand out to us.  I would come back again, the menu had lots of options for lunch specials."
Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,27,1,2.0,8/9/2012,Way overpriced and way tasteless.     Never had such a bland calzone in my life.  Didn't even know that was possible!!!    I will not be returning.   2nd star only because the waitress was nice.
Jacque S.,"Albuquerque, NM",26,90,30,4.0,7/3/2011,"Every time my husband and I go to BJs we always walk out extremely happy. We love the atmosphere and enjoy sitting at the bar. Their bar not only has their own brewed beers, which are all excellent, but a large variety of other draft beers as well. Every time we go we always eat something different and really enjoy it. Their chocolate pazookie is to die for! Also, they food is very well priced. I do not have one bad thing to say about the restaurant and I will eat there again and again."
RaeRae C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,3.0,1/28/2013,"Last Tuesday my sister and I arrived at the establishment around 4PM, she was craving the cookie thing they had so we thought we'd stop by at a less hectic time. The restaurant was relatively empty. We stood in the lobby area for a good 3 minutes before someone noticed and seated us. We did not get our menus until another while has passed. But I can count the clock all I want. The main point is, the restaurant was slow, there was no reason why the service has to mirror the rate of which customers are coming. If it weren't for the delicious half-melted cookie topped with ice-cream, as well as my whiny younger sibling, I would not have waited for our waiter when she finally made her way over."
Danielle R.,"Phoenix, AZ",229,231,19,4.0,4/29/2012,"Never have eaten a meal here. I'm writing a review on the Pizookie! They are awesome and a must try. My friends and I will go here just for the Pizookie. Soft, warm, large cookie with ice cream. Can't ask for more."
Preston B.,"Miami, FL",14,39,1,3.0,3/2/2012,This place is kinda hit or miss. Sometimes its alright and sometimes its just downright gross. The service is pretty bad and again sometimes the food is good. I love the bar and the beer set up and all the bartenders are super friendly. Good place to go if nothing else sounds good or youre craving a pazookie.
Rose C.,"Carson City, NV",0,117,9,3.0,1/27/2010,"We went with a large family group and it turned out OK. Which is saying a lot these days. The menu is very extensive and has some unique things on it. I had the ""knife and fork"" Pot Roast Sandwich and it was really yummy. I've had the Meatloaf sandwich at our Reno, NV venue and it was good too. Everyone else agreed their entrees were ""good"". Anyway, the service was a little slow and we had to flag the server down a couple of times but overall a pretty safe bet for comfort food."
Holly S.,"Orlando, FL",0,9,1,4.0,3/23/2012,"Went here for lunch, got the double deluxe burger added avocado and chipotle mayo it was a huge burger and so delicious left very satisfied, will return to eat here again, next time will ask if I can get this burger in a single patty versus the two it's made with!!"
