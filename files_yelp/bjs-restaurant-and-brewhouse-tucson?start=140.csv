CJ F.,"Tucson, AZ",10,35,11,4.0,12/11/2011,"It was good. Food was good. Hard cider on the menu. I like the atmosphere (Except the TVs all being on sports, is it a sports bar? I didn't think it was.) We will go back. After reading other reviews, I'm definitely trying the cookie dessert next time."
Kaboom J.,"Tucson, AZ",2,16,,1.0,10/2/2010,"Worst experience ever! Horrible service, food was awful, painfully over priced, way too loud, we were there for 2 agonizing hours. 2! Never to return, wish I could give negative stars"
Bob H.,"Tucson, AZ",1,11,1,5.0,3/24/2015,"had the best apps , the new brusssel sprouts w/spicy cream sauce were damn good real good awful good. corn fritters also way better than we thought they could be. kudos on Shannon d for the over the top service again. still don't know why they got rid of the simple turkey sandwich, but the new tavern slice pizza was a good addition"
Mark B.,"Tucson, AZ",98,156,71,4.0,7/29/2011,I have never had a bad meal or bad service at this location. Great place for family get togethers. Main complaint is that the menu is too big and it is tough to decide what to order.
Joe B.,"Austin, TX",0,15,,4.0,3/11/2014,"Great fish tacos! Good IPA. Fabulous waitress, Tess, who not only recommended a great appetizer (fried artichoke), but also recommended an outstanding hike on a nearby trial! Friendly, professional, and knowledgable - if everyone else on the staff here is as together as Tess, my hat's off to whoever is doing the training.  What a great introduction to Tucson hospitality'"
Steven L.,"Tucson, AZ",2,39,,3.0,7/20/2011,"Not bad, not bad at all. It's a chain restaurant though I don't believe they exist on the east coast so I'm only familiar with them through my two lunch experiences in Tucson. I've been to both the Oracle Rd. and the Broadway locations. Both were about on par with each other in terms of service and food.  They have your typical Americana fare, bar food, pastas, and the like. They serve some micro brews and their bar is OK at drink making.  Both times I've gone here were Saturdays for lunch and both times were full house. Only one section off to the side had few diners in it.  It's a family style place, but much better than your typical Applebee's, Chili's, etc. Give this place a go for something easy if you and your friends can't decide on any local places."
Melissa W.,"Green Valley, AZ",120,52,32,4.0,6/16/2011,They have hard cider! Food is great too. I'd describe it as upscale bar food.
Ashley A.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,4.0,12/13/2013,"I've tried many entrees at BJ's and have never been disappointed. Good pizza, burgers, and a good happy hour as well. My favorite thing is their Cajun Pasta. Also, I LOVE their Berry Burst Cider."
Carianne C.,"Tucson, AZ",13,158,13,2.0,1/18/2011,"I come here often because it is close to my office.  Today at lunch I was underwhelmed, mostly due to sloppy presentation.  The ketchup bottle that was brought to the table was dirty and almost empty.  The roasted beef dip sandwhich was good as usual, but the plate was greasy underneath when I moved it - ew.  The barbeque sauce that I requested for my french fries tasted rancid."
Russ R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,16,,3.0,10/14/2014,"I like the food and service.  Two problems....I go here every Sunday for about 5 hours to watch football. The atmosphere for sports is unique in that there aren't the usual screaming maniacs like in other sports bars. They have a great, huge 4-screen monitor right over the bar. They manage to get 4 different games on these screens, but there are 3 or 4 others in the bar area that should have the other games, but they're always set to the same 4 as the big screen. This shouldn't be that tough to figure out. Also, the A/C is set so low that I've seen at least 3 parties just leave or leave early if they were dressed in shorts and short sleeves. It is always FREEZING!!! I always wear heavy jeans and take my thickest coat, even when it's 100 degrees outside.  I don't understand the philosophy with this.  I know every degree of A/C in my 2500 sq ft house costs me about $50-$75 per month. I can only imagine what it must be for this huge building. How do you justify running away customers while burning big bucks by turning a  really nice environment into a meat locker? Crazy."
Tracy K.,"Leavenworth, KS",1,152,27,4.0,2/8/2013,"Grata place to meet friends, have a good craft beer and pizza. Lots of TVs to watch sports in the bar.  They even put the Kansas game on for me...although not not the big screen... Arizona was playing too."
Christopher S.,"Richmond Hill, GA",23,91,,3.0,12/14/2010,BJ's has an excellent variety of quality beers.  I think its a good place to spend time while waiting for the crowd to arrive at Pearl since that club is right across the street.  They could be more accomidating with the TV's and sports but that's not their aim.
Mindy S.,"Tucson, AZ",25,170,29,4.0,9/25/2010,"I hate chain restaurants, but this one is actually pretty decent. They have a HUGE menu, and great lunch specials, not to mention a good beer selection. They're open pretty late, and service is generally fast and friendly. Oh, and GIANT baked potatoes!"
Jen W.,"Tucson, AZ",70,498,27,4.0,6/25/2012,"I heard someone earlier in the week talking about a gluten-free pizza cookie with ice cream at BJ's.  I decided to meet up with my friend there.  BJ's is a bit upper-priced, but the portions are plentiful.  My friend got jambalaya, and I got the Santa Fe Chicken Salad without tortilla strips.  I felt like I had a clean meal in a relaxing atmosphere.  I paid about $20 for my meal.  Overall, the tap sodas, beers, appetizers, and prices are not the best in the city, but I find it much better than Cheesecake Factory for a similar experience (take groups, celebrate something, food for enough pickier eaters, alcohol available)..."
Yvonne P.,"Tucson, AZ",0,20,,2.0,3/17/2013,"Extremely slow service... Even on a slow night! Took forever for our appetizers to come out, and our entrees, oh and desert as well!"
Justin R.,"San Francisco, CA",4,34,,4.0,3/1/2010,"BJs is very affordable and delicious brewery food.  Unlike Gentle Bens, BJs is more classy and has much better food.  Their pizza is very good and the beer is affordable.  There is never a wait and the food is always above par."
Jeffrey A.,"Tucson, AZ",1,9,,2.0,8/13/2011,"Well, I always love checking out new breweries either here in town or when I travel.  I have been fortunate enough to get to experience some great beers all over the country and world.  Unfortunately, this place does not appear on that list.  Well, lets start with the redeeming qualities.  The food has been pretty decent for the price point.  I don't think it's great but, it hasn't left me turned off.  All things considered, I think one would be pretty contented with the food.  I have had the burgers which were pretty good and a chicken sandwich that I really did enjoy.  The problem with this place, which I might add that calls itself a brewery, is that the beer is hardly passable.  I tried a sampler to get a feel for all their beers and I was severely disappointed.  The only beer that I considered drinkable was their red.  I love wheat beers but their wheat smelled like hot dogs to me.  Seriously, hot dogs.  I couldn't even get through it.  I was even more disappointed when I found out they aren't even brewing on site, so the brewery label is a misnomer.  Fibbers I say.  They actually brew in a central location in Phoenix and truck it out to their locations.  I wouldn't necessarily mind that but I hate being lied to.  All in all they rate a 2 because the food was good but the beer was abismal.  IF you like the beer here then good for you but I, for the life of me, can't see how anyone could.  The beer is definitely not YUM.  It's anti-YUM"
Frank U.,"San Francisco, CA",3,60,7,3.0,1/12/2012,"I usually like to budget but it was a friend's night out so I couldn't say ""NO"" when BJ's was suggested. Lets face it no one likes to be the debby downer. For one entree, and a third of a dessert plus tip I payed $17... Eh... Is all I can say, by no means was the food bad, but for the portion size, and the overall quality I'd rather take my change somewhere else. One thing that they can boast are their pizookies. Those little chocolate chip cookies (which come in varying flavors) serves as a throne that the ice cream sits on and it melts away both in your mouth and on the cookies, and sometimes on your face as you shovel it in as fast as you can. One of my favorite fat kid fixes. For a chain it isn't bad but that's all that there is to be said."
Laura F.,"Madison, WI",1,47,,2.0,8/7/2010,"Just tried this place - very disappointed. The prices were ridiculous ($12 for a cobb salad?) and the food was, quite literally, inedible. For a ""brewhouse"" (the beer is obviously not brewed here) the beer was overpriced and tasted only marginally better than a High Life. Our food (one small calzone and one cobb salad) took 50 minutes to materialize after we ordered. The server was great, though - I felt very bad that she had to deal with such a terribly managed restaurant. Bad ingredients, bad food, bad beer, high prices. What a gem."
John S.,"Tucson, AZ",0,15,,3.0,2/22/2010,"A reliable restaurant.  The menu is extensive.   While the food is not spectacular, I have never been disappointed.  The Pizookie (freshly baked cookie in a mini pizza pan and scoop of ice cream) makes for a nice dessert. The beer is better at Nimbus and Thunder Canyon."
