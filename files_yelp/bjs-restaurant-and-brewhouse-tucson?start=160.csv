Maria R.,"Tucson, AZ",0,8,,2.0,6/23/2013,"We decided to have lunch at BJ's because we had a received a gift card.  We ordered some appetizers, I ordered a calzone, my husband ordered a fish entree.  When I received my calzone it was missing the ricotta cheese.  Manager offered to replace it but we were almost done with lunch and it took quite a bit of time to get our entrees so I declined and picked out a dessert instead.  I was pretty stoked because they had white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie.  So we ordered the 3 mini pizookie dessert with peanut butter, chocolate chip, and white chocolate macadamia nut - a little something for everyone.  It took a really really long time to come out  (3 yr old had time to go to the bathroom 3x) and when it did instead of my white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie, what they had made was a white chocolate raspberry pizookie.  I was so disappointed.  The server offered to get another but since it had taken too long to get the first one and our children were already antsy we declined.  Overall service and food were mediocre.  We will not be back."
Feast Mode X.,"Addison, TX",2,105,,2.0,8/9/2010,"i went here for lunch recently, the broadway and craycroft branch. had the grilled ham and cheese with tomato bisque.  it just wasn't very good.   the sandwich was too hard and crusty in texture, with not enough cheese, and made it really difficult and messy to eat.  it was cut in vertical pieces so i could dip in the soup, which was too thick with cheese.  the sandwich could have been yummy if it was a little thinner and more delicate, maybe battered with panko and lightly fried?  it needs a light, crispy texture more than a hard, crusty one.  and the tomato bisque needs more flavor and needs to be less viscous.  i wanted more of a mom cooked comfort food feel to it, but it tasted like bruschetta sauce.  the vanilla creme we ordered also did not come in frosted glasses as advertised and was not what we were expecting.  we were expecting some whipped cream and more of a float taste and texture, but it tasted just like cream soda and just seemed like they added some syrup to club soda.  not bad, but not that great either, a little underwhelming. it was very crowded, and we were told there were no tables inside and the hostess led us outside, then back in because they were clearing tables and she said something opened up inside.  i cut them some slack because they just opened and are getting the bugs worked out.  service was prompt and friendly, however.  at the oracle branch, the avocado spring rolls and potstickers are the best thing.  one thing that makes me question quality control is the sheer size of their menus.  it is insane, and must make the chef's job a nightmare.  a solid 10 pages chock full of various types of dishes from multiple cuisine origins.  they need to trim it down to the dishes that are really good.  must be hell for the kitchen staff, and i certainly don't envy their job."
