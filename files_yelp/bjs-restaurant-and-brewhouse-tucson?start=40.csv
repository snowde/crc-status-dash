Stan J.,"Tucson, AZ",0,17,,3.0,3/6/2017,"THEY CHANGED THE FRIES ! This is one of our regular places for lunch. Good selection of their own and other's IPAs. Although, Beer is a little pricey at $6 a pint. Love their  buttermilk fried chicken lunch or the Parmesan crusted chicken. Fish tacos are also good. Nice atmosphere and great wait staff ( big shout out to Shannon and Brittany). However I'm marking BJs down because THEY CHANGED THE FRIES !  They had the best thin and crispy fires ANYWHERE ( move over Mickey D) and I would order them instead of vegetables with the chicken that already came with mashed. LYUM! Some corporate genius, apparently without thinking about asking their customers'  opinions, decided it was simpler and cheaper to just revert to serving only the pedestrian and mushy variety of fries you can get anywhere else. Dumb move!!  We won't  be back as often now. So, if you want to restore your customer satisfaction rating, and our business, Please bring the crispy fries back"
Rayne M.,"Tucson, AZ",33,54,79,4.0,4/15/2015,"I had gone to BJs a few times before and not thought it was anything special, but a friend and I decided to stop in after work and I was pleasantly surprised!     The food wasn't anything special but it was inexpensive compared to some places and better than I remembered! The pasta was well sauced and the noodles just right, the spice in mine was not overwhelming but still had a nice kick. I didn't order any alcohol but the soda was perfectly soda like haha.     The pazookies are amazing as always and they have added a few flavors since I last went in! I got the cookies and creme mini which was a perfect size for one person since they are very rich!     Service was very friendly and the resturant was nice and clean! I will return!"
Anthony S.,"Tucson, AZ",10,174,74,3.0,5/18/2014,"Is it a chain? Yes! Is it the best Beer you ever had? No! But it's well made, it's clean and free of off flavors, and still a big step up from the big 2! Some of the specialty beers are actually very tasty! Goliath Imperial Red is a big beast, and if you're a hop lover like me, you'll appreciate it! Food IMHO is actually quite good compared to other chains! The pizza though pricey is tasty! The Bison Burger is a winner! So take it for what it is, and again don't take my word for it, try it yourself!"
Mina M.,"Tucson, AZ",0,10,7,1.0,7/18/2016,I don't like to post negative reviews but I gave them second chance and disappointed again food was gross just like they bring someone else leftover!!! Appetizer was cold and dry and my husbands ordered spaghetti and meatball We also found penne pasta some chicken and salad in the plate  totally yuk but we didn't want to complain n just kept drinking staying happy till our sweet waitress came to our table to ask if we r ok n she noticed penne n chicken in my husbands plate but instead apologizing start laughing n ask us if we want to order dessert or need the check!!! Very unprofessional I'll never go back
Jay W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,4,,4.0,5/2/2017,"I went here with my mother and her friend on a Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy, which was good. After a slight delay our waiter arrived and we ended up getting good food and a free dessert because they were a little late getting to us. My rib eye was perfectly cooked as I requested and very tender and tasty. I had a Caesar salad which was good and we all shared the strawberry beignet they gave us for free due to the initial delay. I really liked the waiter Chad I think (His parents had just moved to Hawaii) and he really did a great job also. I'd go back here again."
Amanda P.,"Tucson, AZ",136,131,43,5.0,10/25/2015,I love this place I love the coupons I love the beer I love the food I love the waitstaff and it's the perfect place to go on a first date hang out with friends or any kind of event that is special to someone near you. The food is great they have gluten-free options as well for food choices and I really appreciate the fact that they are upscale
Christi T.,"Charleston, SC",301,164,265,4.0,11/24/2014,"Had my first bison burger at BJ's and I'm happy to say that it was a great one too. It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and seasoned well. The bison burger that they offer is a barbecue style with a tangy barbecue sauce and a side of slaw dressed with a tangy vinaigrette that accompanies the burger perfectly.  I have always really liked BJ's, they have a great atmosphere and cozy ambience. The service has always been really well as the servers seem to be well trained and very knowledgable about the restaurant and what they have to offer.  The wait for food is never too long either. Just long enough to enjoy a drink from their bar."
Jesskuh L.,"Tucson, AZ",1,6,,4.0,4/14/2017,"Get the bacon guacamole burger! I come here all the time. I love this place. The only complaint I have is that it takes 45+ minutes to get your food and when I order take out it's ready in 10-15. Also, sometimes the hostess doesn't want to give me a booth when it's usually just me and my mom but if I ask nicely they will usually let me have one."
Davina R.,"Tucson, AZ",43,6,2,5.0,9/17/2016,We love this place!!! The burgers are the best in my opinion. The avocado egg rolls are awesome. The monkey beard Pizookie omg!!!!
Tori B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,2.0,6/25/2017,"Went in with a big group about a month ago and had a male server. I don't eat any pork for religious and family reasons so I asked if the meatballs in the spaghetti were made with sausage (as a server, I'm familiar with the fact meatballs are usually beef and Italian sausage); with my concern, I asked our server what kind(s) of meat the meatballs had- he looked at me as if that was a dumb question and said that they were 100% beef. I asked that he'd make sure with the kitchen that they were and I expressed my reasoning behind asking, but he reassured me that he already knew they were all beef... so I ordered that meal. I went online to check the menu before ordering food two days ago when I went in to grab lunch and came across the spaghetti and meatballs with it saying the meatballs are beef AND Italian sausage. If you go in, make sure you have your server actually ask the kitchen what's in the food if you have allergies/religious concerns because clearly the staff members aren't educated enough on the menu and definitely not courteous enough to double check."
Bofus T.,"Marana, AZ",0,3,,5.0,9/26/2016,"First, it's tough to go wrong, but that being said, avocado egg rolls + ahi salad + Jeremiah Red = a meal fit for a king.  Quality food, and very service oriented!"
Richard R.,"Tucson, AZ",30,12,28,4.0,3/26/2016,BJ's always has great food and service. My wife and I shared the BBQ Buffalo burger for lunch and it was just the right amount of food. We also had the monkey bread and ice cream for dessert. Tasted just like her homemade monkey bread
Nat I.,"Glendale, AZ",0,2,,1.0,9/19/2016,"For some reason I decided to ""treat myself"" by coming here and spending $50. i ordered the sirloin, it was dry and bland and  the dish looked like something that would be served in a hospital cafeteria. nothing on this menu is worth the price. nothing on this menu is worth putting in your mouth. wow I really hate this place."
Alma C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,64,16,1.0,1/10/2017,We got sat right away and our food took 30 min to come out. There was hardly any customers around 6:00pm. And when we finally got our food that's when other people showed up. And our waitress was not keeping up with our refills.  All we had was some salad ribs and lettuce wraps. Not going back. Crapy service unless you are the only table that they have.
Teresa C.,"Tucson, AZ",96,96,298,4.0,5/6/2016,BJ'S never disappoints. Their food and service is very consistent. Their pizza and pasta are my favorites here and of course their famous pazookie! I don't like their soups but great choice of beers.
Mariana D.,"Tucson, AZ",6,45,2,4.0,6/4/2016,"Food here is great! The only reason I do not give them 5 stars is because of their service. It took more than 5 minutes for a server to come to our table, but once she took care of us the service was good. The deep dish pizza is outstanding, as well as their pizzokie dessert. They also have a great variety of beers and cocktails."
Carlos D.,"Tucson, AZ",23,4,,5.0,7/11/2016,"They brought out the wrong soup. They said ""ok you can have it while we get the one you ordered."" The manager came a few minutes later and took the soup. Seems petty and a waste of food. The manager took care  of it on our bill and we are happy."
TB C.,"Vail, AZ",13,21,,5.0,5/31/2016,"Always a great meal, with excellent service and as always rather lackluster hostess service. Please, Tucson managers - TRAIN your host staff! Families, especially with babies and young children, large groups, seat together in a loud section. Couples, especially those with veterans, seat in a quiet section - away from the kitchen! By scattering babies, children and large parties all over the restaurant it becomes impossible to hear each other at the table! Since restaurateurs insist on decorating in hard surfaces, this compounds the problem."
Heather K.,"Tucson, AZ",0,4,,3.0,5/17/2015,"Went there yesterday with a friend, my son and a friend of his. We started with 3 appetizers the calamari(my son loves), the new corn and bacon bites (my choice) the bacon aoli was great and avocado egg rolls(they needed something crunchy inside). For the entrée my friend got shrimp scampi she said it was good, my son's friend got chicken alfredo also good, my son got steak with mash potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus still had the hard (end) tips not broken off. The plate needed more color. I got the fish and chips which I only at half of. The batter was tasteless and didn't stick to the fish. It also was very greasy.   We ended with a Pizzoki. We had the tri-sample which we picked peanut butter,  chocolate chip and whit chocolate chip with macadamia nut. The peanut butter was the best. We thought. I will be back but not for fish and chips."
Marnel C.,"Tucson, AZ",143,20,31,1.0,1/19/2015,"Don't waste your money here! Frozen food and 'junk lettuce' salads! If you want a beer and/or dessert, check it out.. But for ""Real"" food, go somewhere else!"
