Dieu C.,"Tucson, AZ",345,198,155,5.0,8/30/2013,"What is good? Everything. Both food & service. You can never go wrong with BJ's. I have always been a firm believer that you should generally stick to ordering only what a restaurant is known for, such as getting pizza (instead of pasta) at a pizzeria or pho (instead of a rice dish) at a pho restaurant. BJ's is well known for their deep dish pizzas and brewing their own beer.  The last thing I would want to do is to offend anyone, but who orders steak at BJ's? If you ask me, it is quite uncommon. My little sister, being the steak novice that she was, decided to order ribeye despite my dissuasions.  No one hates being wrong more than I do...and boy was I in for a surprise! Who ended up eating most of the steak and came back the next two days for ribeye? ME.  Call me crazy, but I like the ribeye here way more than Morton's. It is tender, juicy, well marinated, and a mouthful of yummy. Anddd you get it for the bargain price of twenty bucks! My other most recent discovery at BJ's was their gourmet mac n cheese under the Small Bites section. BEST THING EVER. The mac n cheese is extra cheesy, has large bacon pieces throughout, and Goldfish chip crumbs baked on top to add an extra crunch kick.  And of course, you never leave BJ's without ordering a Pizookie, which is always an absolute must for me. If you can't finish full size or your buddy doesn't have stomach space to share, you can get the smaller portion. Random note: It recently dawned on me what ""Pizookie"" means...PIZZA COOKIE! Get it? :)"
Brian H.,"Tucson, AZ",21,15,,4.0,4/8/2016,"Great food and the craft beer is always good. To me, the service always leaves something to be desired. Sometimes, it seems to take a little while for drink refills or check ins. It's never bad service, just leaves me wanting a little more."
Cyndi F.,"Tucson, AZ",144,7,,1.0,1/15/2016,"After a hard work week.   Three for dinner.  We beat the rush hour by five minutes.   Appetizer (mozzarella cheese sticks) took over 30 minutes to arrive.   The mixed drinks ($10.00+) lacked alcohol.    Service was slow and while entrees were large in size, flavor was cafeteria like.    Waitress brought out check BEFORE she brought our dessert.   (Tacky).   We are STILL WAITING on our dessert.  10 minutes and counting."
Randy S.,"Bloomington, IN",175,27,8,4.0,3/10/2016,Had delicious food while watching March Madness.  Great fun atmosphere and the food was pretty good.  The atmosphere is the highlight.
Joan G.,"Gold Canyon, AZ",69,179,11,4.0,9/8/2015,"I am a fan of this restaurant and the Tucson location was no different. Great service, AMAZING pizzookie's and good food. If you don't know what a pizzokie is, it is a cookie fresh baked and warm and served with ice cream and amazing! They have great burgers and deep dish pizza's. My favorite is the 5 meat pizza and the chrispy jalapeno burger. THey  have a rewards program that you can use your card or now they also have a phone app that you can use. You earn points and can get money off after so many points."
Andrew A.,"Tucson, AZ",91,101,,2.0,10/31/2014,Here is an example of why chain restaurants are so popular but so bad.  Huge menu so you can feed even the most finicky of kids.....but I've been there many times at different locations and the food is never above average.
Kevin B.,"Chapmansboro, TN",70,18,,5.0,2/15/2016,"Great food selection including expanded selection for diabetics, great brew selection, fast service.  Totally recommend."
Larry L.,"Tucson, AZ",1,21,10,4.0,3/28/2016,This was a very nice location that is on par with other establishments of this chain. The server was very nice and kept up with refills. The food came out quickly and was pretty good. The place was pretty empty for 5:30 on a Monday but it just meant that our service was quicker. Overall a nice place to get a bite to eat if you are in the area.
Ivannie C.,"Tucson, AZ",110,1,,1.0,6/14/2015,Horrible service! Waitress would pass by and ignore us and rush us to leave even though it was 8p.m.  She would go to talk with her friend at a table was very unprofessional.  Definitely don't want to go back.
Roger T.,"Tucson, AZ",407,250,614,4.0,5/12/2013,"It was a random Tuesday afternoon, I was feeling hungry...as usual...then I thought of a new place to try. Bam! It hit me, I always drove by this restaurant and told myself I would try it one day! First thing that caught my eye was the beautiful building which is pretty eye catching! Well whoever designed this place did a good job because it worked at catching someone's attention!  To begin with I started my appetizer with their ""Thai shrimp lettuce wraps""....one word...mouthgasm! I'm a Thai guy myself and so my standards for Thai style and food are pretty high, however I must say I was quite impressed! The plate consisted of 4 lettuce leafs each with diced grilled shrimps, carrots, onions and mango salsa. You get this delicious taste of the slightly sweet glazed sauce with a hint of spice in it, in which all us Thai people love spice! Only complaint would be I wish I had more, just because it was so good but I knew this is just the appetizer! So calm yourself down Roger, let's make it to the main dish!  After several debates with my stomach I decided to not order another appetizer dish, instead I went ahead and ordered a deep dish ""Mediterranean Pizza"". Why Pizza you ask? Well from hearing from family and friends, I've heard they made pretty good pizza and I still search for the best pizza  in town. The Mediterranean pizza consisted of grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis. Mouth watering? Yes! It was pretty darn tasty! The taste of the sun-dried tomatoes just nearly knocked me off my seat and I swear I didn't have a drink!  Overall I was satisfied, impressed here. I would definitely return again and recommend this place to new customers!"
NikO D.,"Tucson, AZ",79,112,71,4.0,12/23/2013,"I love their lunch specials! I got the 1/2 sandwich & soup/salad combo. I ordered the Tomato & Mozzarella Salad w/ Balsamic dressing, and the Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich (w/ the bleu cheese dressing on the side). Everything was delicious. Except the bleu cheese dressing....sweet blue cheese dressing? No thank you.  Salad was really good! (See my photo). All for just $7.95! I have had some of their other sandwiches, pizzas, salads and appetizers, most of which were delicious. I don't like their iced tea, yet I always make the mistake of ordering it! It didn't have a strong flavor, and it always tastes like it had been sitting out for a while. :( However, they have Rootbeer on tap....and it is DELICIOUS!! :) Customer service at this location is usually pretty good. Sometimes when it is busy, service can be slow, but they are always friendly. Sometimes they have really good seasonal beer on tap... :)"
Kirstin B.,"Tucson, AZ",80,119,59,3.0,9/15/2013,"The best thing BJs has going for them is their beer menu.  Lots of variety and don't forget to check out their mixed beers on page 2 of the beer list.  I tried the Black Velvet (berry beer + porter) today and it was tasty. Their food is fine. Nothing terrible, nothing stellar.  We come here when the local places are closed on Sunday.  Portions are good and price isn't unreasonable. In short, if you come enjoy the beer and use their food to sponge it up so you can have a second."
Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1009,2186,6388,4.0,5/1/2014,"At least once or twice while in town for the gem shows in late January, the family demands a dinner more in line with what we consider comfort food.  I may prefer to gorge on Indian, Mexican and Vietnamese cuisine, and my family goes along willingly. Still, I know with me working most of the day and leaving them at the hotel to play, they need something that is fun to eat.  BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse fills the bill. The place is large and bustling.  Mixed group of people at dinner time, with the happy hour folks mingling around the bar, and those of us in for a meal scattered around either along the bright windows, or deeper inside where it feels cool and dark.  While fairly typical of the latest variant of the modern roadhouse, it does it very well.  I get to drink a few interesting local craft beers, and my son gets his favorite drink of all time - root beer.  Once he tasted it he was mellow the rest of the night.  I took a sip. Smooth, light, sweet, and chill.  It was okay that he had nearly a pitcher of it.  He would remember it for a lifetime. BJ's seemed to be about pizza and beer, and we saw no reason to stray far from their wheelhouse on the first visit.  2010 was our first sit down, and I still remember the deep dish pies as overwhelmingly thick and overloaded with terrific flavor and texture.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza was enough for 6 people, and the Flatbread Roasted Veggie and Goat Cheese a crispy, glorious treat.  We ordered both of these for the 3 of us, and ended up taking most of it back to the hotel for the next day. The following visit, we had a simpler design; one Flatbread Pizza, One Crispy Jalapeno Burger, Wedge Salad and Gourmet Mac & Cheese for the young man.  All very good, and less to take back with us.  We were a happy clan, especially after trying a Pizookie, their signature dessert.  If you love cookie dough, this is for you - baked cookie dough topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and a square of Dark Chocolate.  It is one delicious hot mess.   Sitting back here on the East Coast as I write this, I can still recall the total satisfaction from the experiences at BJ's.  It makes me dream of returning next year for more of the same pleasures."
Miriam C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,8,2,5.0,1/8/2015,"I am continuously impressed with the service and the overall 'ness' of this place. The beers are all even keel, so if you looking for interesting microbrews, this might not be it. But they have a good lineup. The food at this place is a step above chills/Applebee's, and the kitchen does an excellent job. I've never waited here (even for takeout) for over 25 mins. Ever. Even on a fri night. The service is super excellent."
Jennifer Y.,"Monterey, CA",21,79,23,5.0,7/2/2015,Super yummy feel good food. Staff is great and we like coming here. Pazooki is always a must.
Mark S.,"Tucson, AZ",189,81,117,4.0,6/22/2014,I had the house sirloin with horseradish mash potatoes and cesar salad. Tyler was my sever and is outstanding sever being very prompt and efficient. The sirloin was hot and cooked perfectly. I thought the horseradish mash potatoes were delicious and flavorful.  I hear they have a rewards program and really good lunch specials.
Maude O.,"Kaneohe, HI",0,5,2,5.0,2/4/2015,The food and service by IanM was terrific! Topped off my meal off with a caramel pizookie. Yummy! My first time there and definitely not my last whenever I go to Tuscon!
Mike H.,"Show Low, AZ",3,113,31,4.0,8/12/2014,"I don't normally review chains, but this location stands out. The bartender was friendly and capable, the place is spotless, and the patrons are nice, as well.  I had the Mac and Cheese, and the Cornbread Aioli appetizers, and it was just enough for a nice lunch. The light lager was tasty, and it was a very enjoyable way to spend 2 hours. I'll be back.  It all adds up to 4 stars."
K O.,"Tucson, AZ",1,24,2,4.0,6/7/2015,"Friendly service, large variety of food, and a cheap lunch menu! The bruschetta bites and mini pizzas are super yummy. :)"
Ben A.,"Maricopa, AZ",1,3,,5.0,10/2/2015,Had a slight mishap with an over cooked steak but our server Isaac made sure everything was perfect and still turned it in to an amazing dining experience. He's a huge asset to the restaurant and you'd be lucky to get him as a server. Thanks BJ's for a fun night out.
