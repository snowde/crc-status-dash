Kiara F.,"Tucson, AZ",62,6,19,1.0,3/12/2015,"I went there for my birthday and the wait was too long, it took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come. Once we ordered, it took over thirty minutes. We complained and they compensated for the food with appetizers. But just as the appetizers came, the food came. And the food was...... okay. It wasn't that good to me and it wasn't a god experience."
Gilbert T.,"Tucson, AZ",7,250,62,4.0,5/10/2015,"This place is really clean and beautiful.  I love eating at places that feel like they have been taken care of.  The food itself was pretty good.  Again, not the best, but it was still an enjoyable meal.  The wife and I ordered a pizza, which was kinda pricey.  The service was not horrible, was not the best in that the server did not refill our drinks as fast as I would like.  Overall, it's a nice place near the Tucson Mall if you want a good pizza and nice ambiance."
Patrick S.,"Tucson, AZ",65,120,151,4.0,3/21/2014,"Anyplace with a good choice of draft brews is top notch in my book!  I happened to be at the soft opening because my dad was invited and have been going back ever since.  I've mostly sat in the bar area, and have never had a bad experience.  I like the food here, but have mostly enjoyed the offerings from the taps.  The only reason I took away a star is because it's a chain.  I usually like to go local."
Brandon S.,"Tucson, AZ",330,12,8,5.0,5/25/2015,I've been here a few times and it is a present dinning in experience every time food is great! I love he lighting and that's its a bit dim and just feels comfortable
Madison H.,"Tucson, AZ",316,14,5,3.0,3/24/2016,"Not entirely satisfied with my last experience here.. Came on Tuesday afternoon for lunch with some friends, the place was packed when I walked in which I understand because this place is amazing which is why I'm so disappointed. Our service was good, she was prompt and never let our drinks go empty. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, as I do every single time I go. Normally I am ready for more after one plate because of how delicious it is! Tuesday was a different story. The skin on the chicken was so thick and tough I couldn't even cut it with the knife I had, and one of the breasts had a weird color to it as well so I decided that it wasn't meant to be that day, it was unlike any chicken breast I have ever had in my life. I ate the mashed potatoes because they're simply amazing but the chicken went back barely touched. I will go back to Bjs and hope for the entrees to be the way they have been, and the gluten free cookies are to die for. Overall I give them 5 stars, but my last experience barely earned 3."
Tiffany S.,"Baltimore, MD",91,305,159,3.0,8/5/2013,"Yes, it ""chainy"", but in this case it has all the best things about a chain and none of the bad things. It is always consistent, and good. The service is always great.  First off, I love the decor. It has a blend of upscale and down home that makes it feel like you're going out but not straying to far. Sometimes that's nice, ya know?  The beer is better than average, after all it a brewery! I love the seasonal blends, lightswitch and hefe. They also participate in local events, which makes it feel a little more local than the average chain. The menu is one of those massive lists of all sorts of crowd pleasing things. The pizza is good (sweet pig is my fav). The fries are fresh and the burgers decent."
Stephanie M.,"Sacramento, CA",32,102,132,5.0,9/15/2013,"My husband and I frequent this place for date nights. We order the avocado egg rolls with a great white pizza every time and there's a reason why we do. It's frackin' delicious! We also occasionally get a glass of Jeremiah red, very good fruity beer. Recently we ordered out and got the cheeseburger pizza and oh my lord... Let me tell you, it might just be our regular. It's literally a burger and the bun is the pizza dough. Heart attack central! Love this place.  I don't know anyone who hasn't been to BJ's so I guess my review is more of a recommendation, try the Great White or Cheeseburger pizza with a glass of Jeremiah Red!"
Pam N.,"Powell, TN",0,4,,3.0,10/30/2014,Food was very good as usual. Unfortunately the server we had was less then attentive. Failed to bring me another beverage when I ordered one. Was more interested in socializing with other staff then taking care of the patrons. Too bad.
Jeff S.,"Chandler, AZ",6,7,,5.0,4/17/2015,"I can't get enough of this place! The servers are amazing! The food is great. The beer is wonderful, and I love the root beer. I have not ordered anything on their menu that wasn't delicious. Go now, and have a great meal."
Chanel G.,"Tucson, AZ",68,186,17,3.0,12/2/2014,"BJ's isn't anything special but it's not anything horrible either. The mac and cheese is pretty good. I had the parmesan crusted chicken sandwich on the lunch menu. It wasn't anything spectacular but it wasn't half bad. I would opt for the wedge cut fries next time though, not a fan of the thin cut. What I really like about BJs is their huge tv they have for watching Wildcat games. They have a couple house brews that aren't terrible and then a couple of other drafts. Plus, the service is always super friendly."
Ed M.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",43,127,21,3.0,11/5/2014,"Nice spot for a quick lunch.   Burger was good as were the fries.  This restaurant has high top tables in the bar area as well as booths and tables for a more quiet conversation.   Nice enough to have a quick business lunch or meal with an old friend.  It's a brewhouse, so it is geared for drinking beer and has a bit of a sports bar atmosphere.  Think of a classier version of Buffalo Wild Wings.   Slightly more upscale."
Monica E.,"San Diego, CA",1395,604,7339,3.0,6/15/2011,"We had a bottle of Sterling Chardonnay with fried artichoke, calamari, sliders and burger melt with wedge fries. Dan is a wonderful bartender -- very attentive and kind.  But this is just another chain. There is nothing spectacular. Everything was good -- well, except the fried artichoke, which tasted like a bundle of fried batter.  The wedge fries were better than I expected. They tasted less like fries and more like potatoes -- much lighter and more flavorful. Everything else was pretty standard.  Only complaint: There were some sketchy folks at the bar. One just stared. And I asked another guy if the seats were taken and he said, ""Doesn't look like it. But there are phantoms."" WHAT?!"
Robert F.,"Tucson, AZ",3,1,2,4.0,3/2/2015,Good food.  Exellent hot wings. But the beer is the hi light. Tatonka and Jeremiah Red .
Scott V.,"Tucson, AZ",2,2,,4.0,12/28/2014,Pricing was a little high but pretty typical for chain restaurants. Food was good and service was great.
John D.,"Tucson, AZ",25,60,3,4.0,3/13/2013,"This is not the kind of place you want to venture into on a Friday or Saturday night and expect to be seated and served quickly. If you want to give BJs a shot--and you should!--try to go during the week when it's a little less hectic. Otherwise it's going to be a miserable experience that isn't worth the wait.  Okay, so this isn't starting off as a very complimentary review, but I swear it's getting there. If you're heading into any kind of chain restaurant like this one you have to temper your expectations. You've been to a restaurant like this before and it was good enough to come back to but it's not going to be your first choice if someone is looking for a real ""taste of Tucson.""  You know how this goes:  You start with getting an alcoholic beverage because you notice they make their own beer. It's almost $7 a glass but you don't drink all the time so why not live a little? You order the Snakebite and before you can figure out how the two different beers stay out of each other's way inside the glass, you've already drank half of it. Now you have to order. There's so many choices on the menus--burgers, sandwiches, pasta, pizza--that instead of sending the waiter away for ""one more minute"" for the twelfth time you just order a burger that has jalapenos on it. Burgers are delicious, you say, and jalapenos on burgers are even better. The appetizer you forgot your ordered arrives fairly quickly and it's fried artichokes. They're delicious because come on, they're fried. By the time the burger arrives you're so far into your first (and only) pint that you consume the whole thing and then think about how good it was afterward. You tip the waiter more than you probably would have normally--but he was attentive and awesome and deserves it--and head on your way.  In short, BJs delivers if that's the kind of establishment you're looking for. Just don't go looking for it on a Friday night and expect to be in and out within a reasonable amount of time. Go on the weekday and enjoy yourself more."
Jay J.,"Somerville, MA",154,282,26,3.0,11/13/2012,"Coming to Tucson for a few months on and off, I was excited to find that the area has quite a few breweries and brewpubs. My doctor hasn't diagnosed it yet, but I'm positive I have OCD when it comes to visiting such establishments, especially ones that I have not been to before. All the symptoms are there, I swear. After some quick internetting, BJ's came up as a contender. Since I was already nearby that night, I decided it was due time to check this place out. While parking I couldn't help but notice how big the building was and how many cars were parked in the lot. Walking in is a bit overwhelming, in a massive sports-bar kind of way. The place reminds me of a Chili's or Applebee's in its design.  I bellied up to the bar during a NFL game with Team A and Team B playing on the big screen and ordered my first beer, the Tatonka stout. It was spicy, sweet, and delicious. Not having had lunch that day, I quickly ordered some food to fight off the immediate buzz it gave me. Being as ravenous and carnivorous as I was, I ordered the five meat hand tossed pizza on the bartendress' recommendation as well as the mac and cheese with crush Cheez-Its on top and ham inside. Both were duly inhaled and I settled on my next beer choice, the seasonal IPA. Slightly dry, it was fruity and balanced. How good was it? I drank it all. Overall, the the beers were tasty and the food was decent. The service was excellent as well. My only gripe is that the place is not my kind of joint being a really large sports-bar with a massive menu. I found out while I was there that it was a chain, which explains the menu with pictures in it. Would I go back? Maybe. But first I have to burn through this list of other brewpubs in Tucson."
Aviva S.,"Tucson, AZ",20,30,1,2.0,9/13/2013,"it is an ok restaurant. I think this restaurant does need restaurant impossible. The servos is very slow.  They do scerew your bill up lot. It takes them a long time to get you your drink even if its water. Living in a dessert you need water but when your thirsty its too late and your already dehydrated. The noise level is very high you can't have a conversation with the person a cross from you. You have to almost yell, also you say what did you say a lot."
Chris G.,"Tucson, AZ",4,31,17,4.0,4/28/2014,"Good beer, I enjoy their Jeremiah red.  Great. Happy hour specials and good food.  Food was good, had the pot stickers and they were good.  Bartender was friendly and attentive good place for happy hour"
Sylvia M.,"Tucson, AZ",882,196,69,5.0,11/28/2012,DELICIOUS salads and a full menu late night? How did I get so lucky! The service is always spot on during late night too which is pretty rare.
Amanda B.,"Tucson, AZ",141,407,56,2.0,1/11/2012,"Well, BJ's is officially off my list for at least a year. This last time in, service was terrible.  We received some of our drinks right away.  Half of our waters were missing and they brought the wrong beer.  Twenty minutes later our waiter decided to take our order. Twenty more minutes later waiter decided to ask if we want more drinks.  After saying yes, he does not clear the emptys.  This annoys me.  If you have a free hand, take the empty glass.  Ten minutes later says sorry the appetizer is running behind will be soon.  Another ten minutes pass.  Time check, been here an hour and the appetizer is finally coming out.  Ten minutes later food arrives.   For the price and quality of this chain, it is not worth spending close to two hours for a week night dinner.   And they did not even comp the appetizer.  Done."
