Krystin T.,"Seattle, WA",101,400,,3.0,12/30/2017,"My husband and I ended up meeting a friend here not long ago. We'd been trying to go somewhere else but that place was a 45-mimute wait, so we ended up ar BJ's because it's always a good standby.  I actually find the food tasty, which it seems some other reviewers don't. I've never had anything I thought was bad; this time I had the basic burger with a veggie patty + cheese. It and the accompanying fries were great. My husband had the fried chicken salad and seemed to enjoy it. Our friend ordered the hot wings and complained that they were not, in fact, hot. We also shared some cheese curds which were fine to me but as our friend pointed out, they weren't hot and melty like they are at some places. My main issue, if you can call it that, was the service. Our server was pleasant but nothing made it to us especially quickly. My husband and our friend also ordered calimari which just...never came. I had to ask twice for water and condiments. Appetizers (the cheese curds) came out after our entrees. Nothing horrendous but just not the most amazing service one could have."
Jack S.,"Kent, WA",0,1,,5.0,11/17/2017,"Great food, drinks and atmosphere, but probably the best part was the bartender on duty, Joey. He was professional, courteous and just an all around cool dude.  He made sure we got our food and drinks promptly and when he discovered that we had the wrong drink made (by a different bartender) he immediately corrected it after apologizing sincerely. Great service! My wife and I would come back just for him! Next time you're here at the bar, ask for Joey!"
Ashley C.,"Kent, WA",230,23,22,4.0,11/10/2017,Just stopped by for a drink but great service and a super packed menu!  We loved or waitress- she was attentive and very fast!  Our Prosecco came in cute bottles and was really delicious!
Nina M.,"Seattle, WA",54,53,91,3.0,9/24/2017,"I like to get deep dish pizza on Monday's because it's half off.  The service is subpar. Our waitress was flustered because of her other tables so when she came to tend to us her patience was low and it came off rude. I mean I get it, sometimes people have a rough day, but it shouldn't get taken out on other customers.  I've eaten here a few times, but if service is bad and food is okay, there isn't much drawing me to come back here where there are so many other food options to choose from"
Chris S.,"Federal Way, WA",2,8,1,4.0,12/29/2017,"Service was great, but when we ordered the Triple Chocolate Pizookie it was very disappointing. Here is what is in the menu and here is what we got. Try harder next time."
Chris V.,"Seattle, WA",17,255,599,3.0,10/29/2017,"Just not impressed with this location in Redmond. Getting a table seemed like a disorganized affair to begin with but we had a lovely waitress that made up for my initial experience. It's a very nice restaurant and very comfortable for a nice dinner. They weren't in a rush to push us through even though they were busy so that was nice but the burgers were just OK. The sweet potato fries were good, as well as, the parmesan chicken too. I very much enjoyed the deep fried jalapeños on my burger but the burger wasn't anything special. If they offered the deep fried jalapeños as an appetizer, I would be all over it. We had a nice comfortable booth for a nice visit with family but I wouldn't go back just for the food. I think the Tukwila location's food is a little better. I may try it again someday but I'm in no rush to return to this location."
Wen W.,"Seattle, WA",317,233,335,4.0,4/19/2017,"BJ's Brewery House really stands out to me because of their book menu! Unless you know what you really want, you'll be drowned in those pages. I love the portions here, for they're huge portions for you to eat.  For work lunch today, I ordered Mahi Mahi and Shrimp from the low-calorie menu. The sauce was amazing, and my seafood was delicious! The meal was fresh, light, and perfect for lunch. The only thing I'd have to critique is the slippery way of the the sauce being smeared on the plate. However, I still enjoyed the meal very much.  When you are at BJ's , you cannot go wrong with Pizookie! Two minis were ordered: Oreo cookies and salted caramel. Hello! The Pizookie minis were so yummy! The cookies were warm, and the ice-cream melted right off!"
Kellen W.,"Cheney, WA",103,55,38,4.0,1/7/2018,"Through all my experiences here, overall the food is good but the service can be hit or miss. If you have never been to a BJ's, it is a much classier and higher quality restaurant than something like Red Robbin, but I wouldn't think of it as a high class restaurant. Being a Brewhouse, they have their own beers available - and from what I've had they are all pretty good, nothing I would complain about. They have a pretty wide range of food available on their menu, everything from burgers, sandwiches, salads, Mediterranean tacos, and chicken rice pilaf. With the range of food there is definitely something for everybody, and they do have a lighter portion of the menu. We have enjoyed visiting during their lunch hours because of their specials and lunch combos. And of course, it's pretty hard to beat their dessert. If you have never had a pizzookie before, it's something you must try. It's a large, slightly undercooked cookie of your choice, served in a pan and topped with ice cream. Probably one of my favorite desserts of all time. We have had some problems in the past with their service. I don't think it has to do with how busy they are, because we have had servers even at lunch where it can be hard just to find them and get water filled among other things. However that hasn't stopped us from going back, and it's something that easy to pick because of their wide menu selection. The biggest downside to their restaurant is that it's at the South Center mall, so parking can be a real pain."
Taylor Z.,"Austin, TX",549,248,1108,3.0,6/25/2017,"The atmosphere is good, the food is alright. I would stick with the burgers, they are the hardest to mess up. The prices are really high here, especially for the pasta and some of the other stuff. You can't expect too much from a chain place after all. I think the only reason to come here is the beer and some bar food while watching the game."
Misty F.,"Kent, WA",34,8,64,2.0,1/1/2018,Horrible service... ordered chicken bacon pizza no bacon very dry not enough sauce.. ordered crab artichoke dip omg can I say gross never will be back again .. we wanted to try but not impressed
Jessica S.,"Seattle, WA",189,223,183,4.0,11/24/2017,"I came here on a Sunday night, and was pretty bummed when they told me the wait was just over an hour. Once we finally sat down, we waited another hour for our food to actually arrive. I don't know if the food here is worth a two hour wait, but it was really good. I had a burger, which was decent. However, the desert is to die for. I had one of the pizza cookies with ice cream and oh my gosh it was heaven in my mouth."
Nadine Y.,"Berkeley, CA",323,267,1733,2.0,4/6/2017,"Came here with some friends and we had to put our name down to get a table. Unfortunately our name never got called and when we tried to talk to the host about this she claimed we never put our name in which disappointed us. We had to wait an extra 20 minutes and finally got a table.  Our server was okay although there were times when our server disappeared and was no where to be found. Although the good thing was that this place made sure we got our water filled a lot.  Food was honestly okay here. I got the Peruvian Salmon Quinoa and the salmon tasted dry. We ordered the Calamari, but when we tried to eat it we noticed it wasn't fully cooked. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken and that was pretty good though! The chicken was actually moist!  In the end I just don't think I would come back here because of the food and the service."
Camille V.,"Tacoma, WA",91,249,1,1.0,10/28/2017,"Update - 10/28/18 - I spoke to the general manager, Jennifer, who was extremely apologetic and explained what's been going on at the restaurant. She compensated us for our troubles, so we will go back sometime and hopefully have a better experience. Jennifer clearly knows what she is doing and is striving to get her team on board. While I won't change this one star review, I hope the next one will be more than one star!  ------------------------------------ Last Saturday, I walked in with my husband and two children, ages 15 months and 5 years. We were meeting my cousins from out of town, with their two kids, one of which was in a wheelchair. Eight people total. I didn't know that the restaurant could take reservations ahead of time, which is fine. The young woman said we would need to just wait 15 to 20 minutes for a table. Great! Thirty minutes later, we are still waiting. There is an empty room, towards the back, with barely anyone in there. Finally we get called, and as we sit down, we find out that they called the wrong name and we have to get up and go back to the lobby. My son was near tears, he was so hungry and frustrated. I did my best to be nice and not too annoyed. Forty-five minutes in, we are told that the table they are waiting on is just finishing dessert and paying their check. Any minute now. We inquire if there are any other tables, we are told no. Just that one. My 15 month old is starting to lose it and they bring her a plate of food - a roll and some fruit. One hour later, we are still. waiting. I get up and tell the hostess that myself, my husband and our two kids are leaving as we have been waiting over an hour for a table, and still nothing. She is very apologetic, but I'm beyond caring as my kids are starving and tired, and we have put up with this situation for longer than we should have.  My cousins decided to stay and wait for a table of four. I understand it was a Saturday, a busy time, but the fact that they didn't offer us any sort of compensation, that there was only ONE table for our group, I found that really hard to believe. Especially as we left, that back room was still close to empty. We will not go back."
Kelly W.,"La Habra, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/29/2017,I ordered curbside service and after 10 minutes the server finally came out. No dressing on my salad which I specified 2 extra under the special requests section at time of check out . And after getting back to the office which is 2 min away my food has been cold  and burned like it had been waiting for 20 or so min! Probably won't order curbside again! This was horrible ! Talked to Jennifer the manager which was so helpful and solved the problem! Will be back to Bj's soon !
Natalie M.,"Maple Valley, WA",9,36,28,4.0,7/4/2017,"Here is why I am a fan: -Awesome vegetarian and lighter options. You can get any burger with a delicious veggie patty, which is not a Boca brand patty. They have cauliflower tacos off of the lighter menu, and they are phenomenal! I only wish you had the option of getting three tacos instead of two, because man, they are good.  -BEST side salad available at any chain restaurant. It has a variety of fresh greens, croutons, and thinly sliced parmesan. Even their balsamic vinaigrette is amazing. When you get a side salad at Red Robin, it is crouton-less and has wilted iceberg lettuce. It is so much easier to eat healthier when the healthy options are this satisfying.  -Excellent non alcoholic beverages, especially their in-house root beer.  -We came here for my birthday, and I got a monkey-bread Pizooki (sp?). It was kind of like a Cinnabon a la mode. Definitely worth the splurge.  Keep up the good work, BJs! I am sad that they got rid of the super thin crispy fries, but that is my only qualm. BJ's is doing doing the chain thing right, if you ask me."
Val K.,"Kent, WA",0,20,3,4.0,12/17/2017,"We had a company Christmas party in their patio section that was reserved just for us. There were heaters to keep us warm, and it was nice because it was away from the main area at the restaurant so our party could have some privacy and be as loud as we wanted. We had the buffet style dinner since there were about 20 of us. All of the food was delicious and was just about ready for us when all of us had arrived. The Caesar salad was fresh, the deep dish pizzas were sooo good, and my favorite was the crusted chicken Parmesan that was so Delicious. The servers were great even though all of us had our own alcohol tab. You could tell they have been around a few large parties before. All in all, not a bad spot to have a larger group dinner. I was pleasantly surprised ."
Stacey P.,"Renton, WA",50,387,11,2.0,7/20/2017,"Once upon a time I really love this restaurant. I loved it so much I joined the loyalty program.  I thought that they had great drinks, delightful service, and some of the most delicious pizza.  These days though that is in the past.  The greeters have no interest in making eye contact with guests and often just tell me to go to the bar instead of offering me a table even when it's not busy. The service is very hit and miss with most of the time being pretty terrible.  The menu is constantly changing. Every time I find something that I really like it I often see it removed next time I visit. Their deep dish pizzas which were once delicious are now often with very few toppings and cook too long.   Let me give you a recent example. I brought my mother here from out of town.  As usual the greeter at the front told us to go sit in the bar. We found a small table and sat there and waited for 10 minutes before anyone talked with us.   Our waitress never made eye contact with my mother the entire time.  She would not listen to my mother and often times I would have to order on behalf of my mother so that  she can get a drink refill. She never refilled her water without asking. She never checked on our table.  We often just saw her standing by the bar talking to the bartender. When the food came out it was all right. Wasn't really the highlight of my mothers trip. My mother was very offended and shocked about how she was treated as she had never been treated this way at any restaurant before.   It is very disappointing to see how BJ's has evolved over the years. Where once it was a really great restaurant it's no longer really worth anyone's time or money when there are so many other options available to choose from."
Joel L.,"San Francisco, CA",280,42,177,3.0,6/25/2017,"""The place with beer next to the airport"" If you want to grab a beer with some friends before your flight out of Seattle, you really can't go wrong here. If you actually want some good food, then you have the wrong place. They make their own beers and they have a few other options to choose from. I had the oasis and it was refreshing. It looks like they have a decent happy hour too, just not when I was there. Food wise, there was the standard selection of bar food ranging from tacos, to pizza, burgers, and even ribs. All the food looked kind of bland. Tasted bland too, but wasn't horrible by any means.   Atmosphere was chill. Tons of open seats in a pretty large area. Wide range of people, from families with small children, to teenagers and adults. Kind of what you can expect from a place at the mall. Service was quick and attentive. I came in and 4:45 and wanted to leave by 6:00. We already paid and were out the door by 5:45. Overall, I wanted a booth, a beer, and a decent meal near the airport. Got what I came for. Nothing more, nothing less. Prices were reasonable too. Solid 3 star place. Protip: if you're not a fan of rare meat, be sure to let the server know your preferences in advance as they might not ask you up front."
Elisabeth P.,"Olympia, WA",171,499,1200,4.0,1/23/2017,"I had dinner here one night and it was one of only a handful of times I've been to a BJs since I found out I have Celiac. One of the best things about BJs and gluten is that they do their cookie desserts gluten free! Such a treat!  The atmosphere of this restaurant stays true to others in this chain. Lots of the classic big booths on the sides and tables in the middle of the rooms. I enjoy the low lighting, brick, and interesting artwork they always are designed with. I was greeted and shown to a seat on a not so busy weekday afternoon. My server came over right away and wasn't sure what I could have on the menu. The manager came over and was very helpful. Their list of official gluten free items is actually rather limited. The manager was great about seeing if her kitchen could accommodate other menu items I was interested in by simply leaving out an ingredient that would then make it gf.   I went with the southwest chicken salad which had a nice kick to it and wasn't unbelievable but overall was a pretty solid salad. Then I moved on to the star of the show, their gf pizookie covered with ice cream ... sooo delicious. Probably due to their limited menu I won't be having dinner at a BJs too often, but it's definitely my dessert scene! Food came out quickly and there was plenty of food. My server was great and super friendly and price of most of the bj menu items are quite affordable. Overall this restaurant was a good representation of others I've been to in this chain."
Glenn P.,"Burien, WA",15,327,107,2.0,5/23/2017,"We went for a friends' birthday - and it's not really the type of place you can really just stop in for a quick bite. While the selection of beer is decent, they don't offer many cider choices. The pizza is probably the best thing they have on the menu - speaking of which, has become like 'Cheesecake Factory - It has to be at least 12 pages! But sheesh... the prices are on the pricey side.  A tiny pizza, maybe 7"" round is $13  A large will set you back $30. I opted for a burger, which I requested to be cooked medium rare - but was served one that was medium well.  I think this is just what their timers are set to, because that's what was initially offered.  Only regular fries offered as a side.  I forget if it even mentions any side options. I won't be back unless I have to go again."
Nicole P.,"Kirkland, WA",148,3,,5.0,12/15/2017,First time into BJs in Tukwila. Sojin was amazing as our server. Super attentive and funny! Made my tinder date much more entertaining. Will definitely be back- but with a different date!
Amit D.,"Seattle, WA",134,31,37,2.0,10/7/2017,"We received absolutely horrible service in this restaurant. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the food quality. We immediately got the table to seat, they were courteous enough to ask our table preference. From this point onwards, we waited for 20 minutes for someone to come and take drink/food order! The waitress  knew that we are waiting. She was attending  other guests, but was completely ignoring us. Same thing happened when we requested for cheque. I highly recommend to ignore this place!!"
Kimberley C.,"Renton, WA",1,26,74,5.0,5/7/2017,"Their food never disappoints me! Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both loved it!  I ordered the jalapeño burger and he ordered the portobello burger. We split each in half and shared with each other. Both burgers had perfect balance! The jalapeños weren't overpowering the flavor of the burger (jalapeño burger) and the pesto was so good (portobello burger)! The buns were good as well! Right amount of crunch and softness. I haven't had their burgers before so it made me happy to know that their burgers are actually good.  For dessert I ordered the Oreo birthday pizookie for my boyfriend. So delicious! If you haven't had a pizookie before then you're missing out.  Last but not least, the service. It was on point! Our server was courteous, personable, and took the extra mile to really make sure we were taken care of."
Maria N.,"Seattle, WA",305,18,24,3.0,3/21/2017,"FOOD: 4/5 PIZOOKIES ARE LIFE.  Dessert here is a must, pizookies are deep dish baked cookies with ice cream on top. They are too good it's dangerous. Food here never disappoints, this is the only BJ's restaurant i know of in the Seattle Area. I would recommend the Parmesan Crusted Chicken or Pulled Pork Sandwhich. They up there prices a bit so everything was from the range of $13 and up.  AMBIANCE/SERVICE: 4/5 They are usually super helpful and you can get a free pizookie here on your birthday. My only complaint is that it's more expensive than i think it's worth so that's why I give it 3 stars."
Viktorea W.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,2.0,12/10/2017,For my first time to this location I was highly disappointed I did not receive my meal in a timely manner and when I finally did receive my meal it was cold I had to go out of my way to ask for fresh fries when they should have already been warm for just coming out. Not only was the food not the least bit satisfaction my server Crane S. Could not have been any Ruder when I tried to explain to him what was wrong with my meal he threw his hands on the air and said I will get my manager. The manager was friendly and handled the situation accordingly and professional probably to only reason I will be back.
Emily J.,"SeaTac, WA",95,168,233,4.0,4/21/2017,"Our first visit to BJs. We enjoyed the chicken club flat bread appetizer. The cider berry was berry good. We then ordered the Lemon Parmesan Chicken and Portobello Fries. All was well, as usual my hubby and I split the plate. Now I don't know if the hair I ate was from the extra plate or the food. But needless to say it was not good.  Sam our server was so nice and made it right. He was kind and professional and took great care of us.  The only reason my review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the long facial hair in my food.  We will return and try again. Thank you Sam and Management for making it right and being so kind about it. Things happen and because of the way it was handled I will be back to be a patron of your establishment again."
Makerita L.,"Federal Way, WA",86,78,287,5.0,8/4/2017,"Love my first time here, the food was delicious and fulfilling. Semi fancy if you want to impress someone. We went here for lunch and ordered some sandwiches, they were alright. Our server was attentive and helpful. A good place to go to if you need a different taste of food and just relax. I would have to go here again to do a better detail review because this is based on my first time there. Yes I would return again and recommend it to anyone. Hope this help, good luck."
Geanne Rose Q.,"Seattle, WA",0,5,1,2.0,9/30/2017,I've dine in at BJ's plenty of times and had no problem until today. My sister order me the gourmet five meat pizza to go and I couldn't believe my eyes when I opened the box. The pizza literally looks like they took leftover slices from other pizzas instead of baking the right amount of 6 even slices!!!! $17.25 for this pizza and it looks like a pizza from Pizza Hut at the airport!!! I don't think I'll ever eat here in awhile and never order take out from BJ's ever again!!!
Gavin C.,"Arlington, WA",96,203,113,5.0,9/12/2016,"So happy when I go to BJ,s. This  place is always clean and the menu is huge. So many different options to choose from.  We received prompt service and was allowed ample time to look through the menu. I ordered the deep dish pizza, my daughter had the Jumbalya, and my wife had the avocado bacon sandwich. Everything was cooked perfect.  The server was kind enough to give us a Togo cup of cream soda. Nice touch BJ's, we'll be back/"
Trevor M.,"San Diego, CA",48,15,7,5.0,11/11/2017,Came in here for their free veterans day meal. They were very busy but still found room for us at the bar. Had a delicious lunch deal with the half chicken club and bowl of chili.
Misty N.,"Federal Way, WA",1,20,5,5.0,11/9/2017,Went here with my girlfriend on a Sunday and had amazing Brussels Sprouts!!! They are a new fav!!! I love BJS!
Mila D.,"Palmdale, CA",23,86,1,1.0,9/11/2017,"I was here August 28, 2017 around 6pm. Yet another BJ's who CANNOT make a proper cocktail to save their life.  I have worked in the food industry as a bartender and server for 10 years. So let's just say I know a thing or two.  Service was good. Food was good. It's just disappointing when you are spending the last night of your trip with your family coming from Los Angeles to get a Long Island Iced Tea that tasted far from it. I don't know what is going on with these people here. But my sister and her co-worker had experienced the same thing on their previous visits.  It was really a disheartening experience because even though the server offered to have the bartender remake it, my confidence was lost. I took a look over and can tell you this guy has very little experience bartending.  So much for having a nice dinner with the family. Yes not having my long island iced tea ruined my experience. Too bad because I really liked BJ's. I'm not sure I'll be back.  They need to re-train their bartender. It was a short petite size latin in his mid-20s. Perhaps a server who was recently promoted but needs solid training how to make a drink. You don't just fill the cup with ice and pour the spirits in till it fills up. YES IT WAS THAT BAD!"
Gabby P.,"Renton, WA",38,36,13,3.0,8/11/2017,"BJs has prompt service and a good atmosphere. The menu is expansive; comparable to cheesecake factory. I ordered the prime rib dip. I would not suggest ordering this sandwich. It was overly greasy and the beef had big pieces of fat on it. The fries were tasty. As far as appetizers go, I would suggest the calamari with marrinara or mozzarella sticks."
Brandon S.,"Issaquah, WA",64,8,12,1.0,6/13/2017,"Good: Good food & Cold beer  Bad: Horrible service. Jeffery B claims they're out of vanilla ice cream.  We ask if they have chocolate, he responds, ""Yes, but I don't like to scoop ice cream."" Forgot pizza boxes, twice. He only brought one. We had to grab the second box from the bar."
Katie A.,"Des Moines, WA",66,2,,1.0,11/1/2017,"My friends and I have had a terrible experience at Bjs, first off it took the waitress longer than usual to take our order. Second when she did take our order she forgot drinks. Normally I wouldn't complain because you can't blame a business off one waitress but the food also came out cold and dry. It was a terrible experience overall. There were tables of people that filled up after we came, famines, dates they all had the same waitress and got their food before us and we're gone before us. There was a party or like 18 people next to us and they also had quicker service than us. There was 6 of us. Waitress : Jaime R."
Ronald Z.,"Seattle, WA",23,1,,3.0,11/11/2017,"The service is slow. Mistakes made on order. Server was overworked and overwhelmed due to a gaggle of teenagers and a birthday party. After we got utensils, the food was ok!"
Em K.,"Seattle, WA",88,218,115,4.0,6/2/2017,"I'm a fan of his restaurant! They take American food and pull out the best of the deliciousness! For example, you love pizza, INCREASE the cheese, you like buffalo wings, TAKE THE BONES OUT, you like past, SERVE IT WITH A DELICIOUS UNiQUE SAUCE and JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CHEESE!  I've been here twice and have been very happy both times. This is a pub dinner type of place, good for watching a game!"
Araya U.,"Seattle, WA",189,108,194,3.0,3/27/2016,"It's Southcenter so.... I never go in with expectations anyway. There was no host or hostess at the door to seat us, and despite the very empty restaurant, the waiter who finally came to seat us told us it'd be a 5-10 minute wait. I glanced over his shoulder though and noticed the also empty bar, so we bypassed the wait and went to the bar. The waiter at the bar was attentive though, and our food came out relatively quickly. We had a classic deep dish pizza - it had a great, soft dough, which I liked. The Santa Fe egg rolls, which we kind of picked on whim, were also quite good. Even though the initial appearance was a bit disappointing, the service once we were seated was okay, and the food, while not life changing, was on the better end for a fast food-ish chain. Definitely a good choice for anyone who isn't looking to wait a million years for sub-par pasta at the Olive Garden or the Cheesecake Factory across the street."
Shana M.,"Seattle, WA",0,23,,1.0,6/28/2017,"Well that was a complete fail on their part. It took them 30 minutes to deliver our sushime appetizer. It's raw fish, how long does it take to prepare raw fish? I watched our waiter walk past it four times. His name was Shawn H if you get him as a waiter I feel really, really sorry for you. I have never not tipped ever but for him I made an exception. Shawn H (with the man bun) ruined our date night and had the audacity to not apologize or even get us refills. The manager did take the very late appatizer off the bill but the rest of the horrible service guaranteed that this post would happen."
Anita V.,"Auburn, WA",60,29,52,5.0,12/21/2016,"Is there ever a time where I didn't love BJs? Fav dish here is the 5 meat deep dish pizza. Perfect ratios of every type of meat. Ultra gooey cheese. I've had the quinoa and salmon (forgot the name) but it's the healthy alternative that satisfies while still getting the 'eating out' quality. There's a fancy grilled cheese that's ultra tasty and sweet alcoholic beverages galore. Also, beer on tap to pair with their satisfying pastas and burgers. Whenever a friend is from out of town this is my first pick.  Pro tip: try out the avocado egg roll or potato skin appetizer, super delish if you have the space for a 3 course experience.  2nd tip: monkey bread and chocolate chip pizooke are my favs.  This location in particular consistently has great customer service!! :)"
