Vivian W.,"Renton, WA",230,191,481,3.0,6/6/2015,"Came here on a Thursday afternoon with a group of people from work. The restaurant had a patio section on the outside with a roof, which was where we all sat. It was a very sunny and warm day so it felt really nice to be sitting outside. We were greeted immediately and got our drink orders in. It was happy hour so almost everyone got something off of the happy hour drink list. I got the BJ's mojito. It tasted really good...if I was looking for a minty lemonade. They could definitely spiked it up a bit more with the booze. I also ordered the lettuce chicken wrap. It was not so good. The chicken did not taste like chicken. They felt like something out of a tin can and just glazed over with soy sauce. It is in NO comparison to CPK's lettuce wrap :( Finally, I shared a Pizooki sampler with my co-worker. We got the original chocolate chip, cookies n cream, and white chocolate macadamia nuts. I really enjoyed the white choco mac nuts one! It had a perfect balance between the sweetness of the cookie and the creaminess of the ice cream. The cookies n cream one was very good as well, but a little too sweet for my taste. HOWEVER, one of our cookies had only half a scoop of ice cream on it! WTH?!"
Jessica H.,"Seattle, WA",189,88,25,1.0,1/9/2015,"By far the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. My expectations were not high either. I really just came for a beer and burger, simple enough.  To start, we checked in and were told it would be a 15-20 wait. Which I was fine with as I was starving and the thought of going back out to the mall to find something else and possibly wait any longer sounded terrible. I give my name and wait...and wait. Fast forward to 25 minutes later and they are calling a name, which sounds like mine but is not. I go up and speak with the hostess who has written my name down incorrectly and presumably was seating other people before our party because of this. Slightly annoyed but willing to just get a beer and call it a wash, we sit down. We order drinks and wait...a long time. Having been a server I could tell she had too many tables and was sympathetic to this.  Then, I am proceeded to be given the most watered down beer I have ever had in my life. Thinking this was a fluke I ordered samples of their other BJs beers..stout..red you name it which too were watered down...crazy!! Then I order a mens room on my dime because I have had that many mens rooms and theres no way you can screw that up. I was wrong. So. Watered. Down.  I could go into the food situation but I really have no more energy mentally or emotionally to accurately describe the level of dissatisfaction I felt while dining here. I will not return even if someone paid, I would strongly suggest somewhere else."
Nhu H.,"Seattle, WA",5,41,67,3.0,6/12/2015,"I only gave this place a 3 stars bc my waiter was rude and literally took forever to get whatever we asked for. It was really busy at the time and I had to get somewhere and my food took around half an hour to get to my table, I was pretty disappointed at that but the food was soo good and I guess the prices aren't that bad either."
Alison V.,"Albany, NY",316,793,336,2.0,2/23/2012,"Oh BJ's, the only thing good about you is the name.  Well and some of your selection of food.  I've been here twice in the past few weeks. The first time I was meeting a friend.  I ordered one of their own beers.  It was disappointing.  I feel like if you're advertising yourself as a brewhouse, you should brew decent beer.  I got a fried buffalo chicken wonton plate for $3 or so and it was delicious.  My friend showed up and we got some avocado egg rolls.  They were ok, but nothing impressive.  The pizzas we both ordered were mediocre, but not worth what I paid for them at all.  The server was clearly rushed and brought my dining companion the wrong drink.  We sat there for a bit (it was a weekday afternoon and they weren't very busy) and the server abandoned us shortly after we finished our food, dropping off the bill and letting us know she was leaving.   I came back again the other day with another friend.  This time I was smart and did not order BJ's brand beer.  We got an appetizer plate that had a sampling of items.  We replaced the spring rolls with extra mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were lukewarm and the dipping marinara sauce was overly sweet.  There was also avocado egg rolls again which were ok.  The other item on the plate was spinach dip, which my friend mostly ate, but the chips for dipping were super salty.  The server working the bar that day was better, which was nice, but it still wasn't that great of service. Overall, for how expensive this place is, I'm not a fan.  I feel like if I'm paying $20 for an appetizer platter it should be impressive.  If I'm paying a lot for a pizza, it shouldn't taste like I cooked it out of the freezer myself.  I've definitely experienced better probably won't be stopping in anytime soon again."
Jose S.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,,1.0,9/13/2016,Was there Sunday the 11th and service was horrible. The server i think was hispanic with a bigger build didnt know how to attend my family properly. We sat down and took him maybe like 20 mins just to see what we wanted to eat.  Not going there anytime soon . Gonna tell people about this expierance
Es K.,"Kent, WA",0,22,,1.0,1/16/2016,"This review is for curbside service. Placed an order online to be picked up curbside at 1:30pm. Didn't leave the parking lot until 2:15pm. Once I arrived, I called the number on the sign. The first time, no one picked up and the call was dropped. Then someone finally answered and told me they'd transfer me to take out and I was put on hold for 10 minutes. Hung up and called again a few times before someone answered and finally she said she'd be out with the food. Another ten minutes pass and half my order isn't even ready. If you can't commit to a service listed on your website, don't offer it. All I got was an insincere ""I'm sorry it took a while..."""
Kenny H.,"Kent, WA",0,5,,3.0,12/12/2016,"Ill update my review since they refunded me for my bill. thank you but still only 3 stars. that was by far the poorest customer service I've ever had dealing with the manager that night. we will consider one more try and see if things have changed. also about the server I previously wrote about I hope someone talked to her, if your going to be on your cell phone talking about completely inappropriate things or not go outside no customer is going to feel comfortable hearing those things from a person that could possibly be handling your food."
Gus C.,"Las Vegas, NV",26,69,8,2.0,1/12/2016,"Came here asking about the specials.  Bartender says no specials.  I state it's Tuesday.  He states there is a wine special on Tuesdays half off.   The wine is fairly warm and taste a little off.  This place is a typical Franchise, with poor service and attitude staff.  And then it comes back to me.  Was here over a year ago and we waited over an hour for seats, and had to point out a free table to get seated.  The food was decent but did not come back due to that incident, and here I again, unimpressed."
Maria S.,"Antelope, CA",3,4,,1.0,12/21/2015,"Terrible, unfriendly server.  Do waste your time.  My daughter ordered a clam chowder in French bread bowl, they mistakenly put chili.  They brought back clam chowder in a French bread bowl come to find they had scooped the chili out and used the same French bread bowl for her clam chowder.  Asked the server about Indiana he gave us attitude and said oh do you want me to take it off?  Then my husband asked for the manager and explained what happen.  He really didn't care either and he just said sorry and took it off the bill.  Anyway we have not had such rude service in a long long time."
Courtnie C.,"Tukwila, WA",150,1,,5.0,6/16/2016,Love having lunch here!!! Started coming because of the chicken tortilla soup but now it's because of mark!!! Go in during the day and sit at the bar!!! Mark will take great care of you!!!
Sarah M.,"Issaquah, WA",260,1036,,3.0,11/23/2013,"My coworker and I came here for lunch one day - I had been to the Redmond location for dessert but had never ordered food here. I definitely don't think that this place was as bad as people say it is. The food was actually pretty decent - I think that the service was the weak link of the meal.  Our food came quickly enough but our server was just super apathetic. Maybe he was having a bad day.  My friend recommended the soup and sandwich combo - so I had the chicken noodle soup and the grilled chicken club. I was surprised at how many noodles there were in the soup. Usually, a cup of soup only has some broth and a couple of noodles here or there but this one was packed. That being said, it was kind of salty.  The grilled chicken club was also really good. It was greasy and garlicky which was awesome and terrible at the same time. Just the right amount of food for me.  This place is probably one of the better options in Southcenter. I haven't been to many places but it definitely looked nicer than some of the places that I walked past."
Graidey M.,"Saint Louis, MO",7,13,11,4.0,2/15/2015,"So far the service is great. The beer is a little watered down but hey it was a fun experience being my first time there. We started off in the bar because we had a 25 min wait that actually turned in to about 45 min but hey it was valentine's day so I'm not to worried about it (we first went to olive garden and they had a 1.5 hour wait). After out table was called we moved to our table and the new server was very nice. What was even better she was fully updated on what drinks we had already ordered and asked if I wanted another. Also she knew what appetizers we ordered (from the bar that hadn't come yet) and said that they would be coming shortly.   My food was great I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich (I'm on the hunt for the perfect on that I don't have to make) and I must say it was great the pork was tender and the bread was really soft and delightful. I did order a side of extra BBQ sauce just incase it didn't have enough and the sandwich was a little short on BBQ but not by much the extra side of BBQ sauce did the trick. All and all we ordered 5 drinks, an appetizer, 2 main dishes and a dessert and tipped, our bill came to about 95$ and I am totally okay with that given the service and amount of food. I give BJ'S 4 out of 5 stars but only because the beer was a little watered down."
Justin B.,"Bremerton, WA",65,50,1,3.0,1/20/2016,Food choices were original and the menu was large. The prices were ok and the food quality was somewhere in the middle. I would go again just to try something different.
Juanita O.,"Everett, WA",9,9,,1.0,11/4/2016,"Waiter was nice but super slow.  Never came back to fill up my ice tea - asked a passing waitress.  After food came, again, never came back to see if it was ok.  Food was awful! I had a salad that looked like it was just dumped out of bag - no taste.  My husband had fish tacos which were teeny tiny and tasted worse!  Ate here once before and don't remember it being this bad.  Won't come back for sure...just takes one bad experience!"
Julie D.,"Bayside, NY",142,201,132,3.0,2/17/2016,"While visiting in Washington with family, we decided to grab dinner at BJ's after doing some shopping and before heading to the airport. We weren't incredibly hungry so we opted for sharing. Our cousin and I decided to share a ""make your own"" flat pizza. It was basically a large pita. We asked for it with mozzarella, black olives, and pepperoni. I also asked for sauce because apparently in Washington that's not a given (something we realized after eating at several places during our visit!) The pizza was good enough. It was a bit under cooked so I did miss the crisp it could have had. There was also a bit more grease than I would have liked. We actually ended up ordering a second one since we expected it to be filling enough for the two of us but it wasn't. The second one was crispier but tasted like it used different cheeses and the toppings were more sparse. My husband got the spring rolls and brussel sprouts with siracha sauce as his dinner. He seemed to enjoy both as the sprouts were gone in a matter of  minutes and he polished off his spring rolls later in the night before boarding the plane! Overall, seems like a nice place to settle down at after a long day of shopping at the very large Westfield mall."
Jessica R.,"Kent, WA",0,10,,3.0,5/22/2016,I went there for dinner with my friends on Saturday night. Restaurant was very busy and packed. After 25minutes wait we got the table and we order our food which took forever to arrived. Just for the water it took 15 and around 45 minutes for food to arrive. Food was great but wait is to long.
Curtis S.,"Snohomish, WA",0,26,,5.0,4/30/2016,"The service was absolutely fantastic, they were very courteous and conscious of my three year old that came with my wife and I. The beer is awesome. We love to the atmosphere and how courteous our server was. On a side note Cherry Chipotle salmon some of the best I've ever had and in my opinion a wonderful representation of Northwest salmon. My only concern is that there is not a BJ's up north where I live in Marysville or the lynnwood Everett area."
Susan W.,"WA, WA",125,620,1484,4.0,4/20/2014,"Met a girlfriend here for lunch last week. I had been about 2 years before & remembered that they had great lunch specials.  I went for the half wedge salad, half sandwich & fries combo. I had grilled chicken club sandwich & the jojo fries. Everything was wonderful. Actually took my sandwich & some of the fries home & just ate the salad & some fries there.  My friend had the BBQ combo lunch. A BBQ pork slider, a BBQ chicken breast, cole slaw & fries. She opted for the shoestring variety. I didn't think they were quite hot enough & preferred my jojo fries.  She took home her chicken breast & some of her fries.  Service was pretty good. Sat in a nice big booth in the bar.  Park in the garage near JC Penneys."
William T.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,5.0,5/14/2017,had an awesome time taking my mother out for mothers day. good food and excellent service from robert this afternoon. will definitely return soon and ask for his section.
Chris B.,"Federal Way, WA",63,18,33,2.0,12/6/2013,I may give this place another try for happy hour or lunch. The cream soda is very good and I like that you can try all the flavors with the purchase of one.  My friend ordered the gluten free pizza with pineapple and Canadian bacon. I've had many GF pizzas and this was probably the best I've had.  I ordered French dip and was very disappointed. It looks much better than it taste. Served at room temp and several bites ending with a mouth filled with gristle :-(. Missing the mark on such a simple dish is why I'm only giving 2 stars.  While our waitress was very friendly she broke my cardinal rule...she walked up saying nothing took the pizza pan and my side of ranch that was clearly on my side of the table. Of course I had a mouth full of food and could say nothing but look down at my remaining fries and wonder what I was to do next.  I hope my next visit will be more pleasant.
