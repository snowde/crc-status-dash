Jesenia R.,"Puyallup, WA",1,7,2,4.0,2/21/2017,"The only thing I ever went for was their desserts and California club flat bread pizza. The last time I went, it was no longer on the menu so I got something that was good but not memorable. What a bummer since I hate deviating from my favorites so now there's not much of a reason to go except for the salted caramel pizookie (super sweet but I could not put my spoon down). I'm so stubborn about what I get that my best friends, parents, and exes know what to get me without even asking. Good service though."
Hanna H.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,3,1.0,12/18/2016,"If I could rate this restaurant lower I would. First off we made reservations and still had to wait 15 mins for our table. Two people in our party had to wait an hour for their meals after everyone else got theirs. When they finally got their burgers, the meat was completely red and uncooked!!!! Lastly, we saw two employees came out of the bathroom when there was ABSOLUTELY NO HOT WATER!!!!!!"
Tyrell T.,"Klamath Falls, OR",73,4,,4.0,4/9/2017,"Had a wonderful meal and experience. Would go back again & tell my friends about it. Waitress was friendly, and the servers were funny."
Korry P.,"Sammamish, WA",69,174,16,2.0,12/6/2016,The service is always slow. I would stop going here but my daughter loves the deserts. The food could be better. The staff is trying but its been a few years now and nothings changed. Will continue to go but only about every three months. Can't handle the slowness of the kitchen.
Jenny D.,"Seattle, WA",219,67,100,3.0,8/7/2015,"I came here with my family, including my baby brother. I think the food is an average food chain rating. Like you know what to expect. I got chicken parm with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It was decent but I felt like anyone could make it. The mashed potatoes were good, maybe because I was craving them haha!  The extra star is because I finally tried a pizookie and it tasted yummy! I like to bake cookies so it gave me a really good idea to make them at home!  I think this place is okay if you're already at the mall and you're hungry, but i think I can find better food someplace else!"
Keith H.,"Plumas Lake, CA",39,88,21,1.0,4/6/2016,"This was the worst experience I ever had at BJ's by far. The calamari appetizer took over a half hour and the restaurant was very slow. There was no excuse. The worst part was that it was really over cooked and cold. I didn't eat it. I ordered the salmon and quinoa. The salmon tasted like a salt lick, it was so over salted I had trouble swallowing it. I suffered through it because I was hungry.  This location needs a serious cleaning up of cooks. Get some people who can follow a recipe and proper cooking times and seasoning measurements.  Horrible! The service was slow and drinks took forever. The manager was good when she offered to remake the calamari."
Brittany M.,"The Colony, TX",56,24,20,5.0,1/16/2017,"Sojin is the best server, he already knows what we want to order (we're regulars) we always sit at the bar and he remembers us. He's got the best personality out of all the waiters and waitresses we have had, just found out today that we can request him. Can't wait to have him the next 400 times we're here hahah.  ALSO since you can request him I highly recommend it he's amazing and you won't regret it."
Sara D.,"Seattle, WA",14,8,1,5.0,1/6/2017,Those artichokes tho.... amiright? Sojin in the bar is the best. Awesome recommendations for food and drinks. Went on a limb with his advice and was pleasantly surprised! Will definitely come back and hope to the sweet lord above he is working!
James S.,"Seattle, WA",608,40,4,1.0,3/28/2016,"Came here with my family on Saturday night about 10pm. Waitress recommended a cocktail to the girls that of coarse was 9.95 each, i had a root beer. I ordered appetizers wings,calamari,cheese sticks that were all cold!! When i told the waitress she said i waited by the fryer for them... A Lie!! Then the manager apologized and said yes they were all cold.. I asked for my bill it was 65.00.. No comp at all......"
Angie L.,"Renton, WA",0,28,5,2.0,7/27/2016,"First time at bjs and I'm not impressed. Got the shrimp tacos and the tortilla wrap tastes and smells like it came straight out of the plastic packaging. Avoid that dish. I could have made a better one at home. Lesson learned, don't get tacos from a non-Mexican place. Service was okay. Not super fast but not atrocious."
Michele M.,"Federal Way, WA",2,14,5,1.0,4/22/2017,TERRIBLE SERVICE! Was not greeted upon entering.  Servers literally walked past us and didn't take our order until maybe 15 mins later? Servers all just standing and talking with each other.  Looking in our direction but still no help.  Food is less than ok.  Hard to fuck up a pizookie.  SMH
Kevin S.,"Seattle, WA",542,71,,1.0,1/24/2017,This is the worst BJ's in their chain terrible service terrible bartender argumentative staff and very always slow service will never stop by here again
Nikki Y.,"North Bend, WA",0,33,2,2.0,3/22/2016,"I went here with a friend while we were waiting for a movie. We had more than an hour to spare and thought we'd have plenty of time. *spoiler alert* We were wrong.  Service was very slow, even to get our drinks, but food took more than an hour. They initially said they were catching up after a large group, but then blamed the delay on the fact that I ordered a Boca burger because, apparently, those vegetarian patties take 40+ minutes to cook - who knew!? By the time our food was ready, we had to ask for it to go... but while my burger was hot, the fries were cold, like they had plated them when I first made the order and never bothered to heat them back up.  When the check came, after this ordeal, they had my bill mixed up with my friends - so I ended up paying for her pricey cocktail. It was too much of a hassle to try to fix.  Everyone knew that there was an issue with our experience, the manager even came over the apologize, but made no effort to make things better."
Alyxandra L.,"Renton, WA",1,8,6,5.0,2/12/2016,"5 stars purely based on the food!  Usually when you order a burger, it's pretty much always well done.  We ordered our burger rare. And it is perfectly RARE! Holy cow! Brown on the outside pink all the way through but still cooked on the inside! My boyfriend described it as ""exceptional"" and that's hard to do!  I got the Caesar salad and broccoli cheddar in a bread bowl.  DEVINE!  I will be coming back for sure.  Also the Long Island-- party in a glass Rootbeer-- fantastic"
Nicolle T.,"Renton, WA",82,2,,5.0,7/27/2017,"Sojin was our server and he was beyond amazing! Funny, personable and attentive! Our food was delicious and Sojin made the experience so much more than just yummy food. And those pizookies though!!!! Great experience!!!"
Coco S.,"Herriman, UT",3,128,308,3.0,3/20/2016,"My sisters and I were stuck at the Westfield Southcenter mall after a flight into Seattle while our mom drove up from Oregon, so we killed some of our time having lunch here. They were great to hold our bags for us up front, and they were very polite, but the service was super slow. We had to ask for condiments multiple times and it seemed like there were some issues with communication among staff. The food was good though as usual, so overall not a bad experience."
George B.,"Burlington, KY",0,3,,2.0,2/1/2017,Walked in and sat down at the bar. I was one of only four people seated at the bar. There three girls behind the bar. Two were just hanging out and talking to other co-workers and the other had her back to me. Then someone else sat down at the bar and the one with her back to me turned and welcomed that person and took his order. She looked at me and smiled so I figured she would come to me next. Nope! She went over and started typing on the kiosk and stood there conversing with the other girls. After about another five minutes another girl comes over introduces herself and the others working behind the bar. She gets me my drink and the other girls were still hanging out doing absolutely nothing. The bar area is not even busy and it's dinner hour here. Could that be a clue? I decided not to eat here because of this issue.  This has to the worst service I've received at a BJ's Brewhouse around the country. I am from out of the state and will not return to this location again. I wish I hadn't even seen the sign walking from the hotel.
Jalice M.,"Seattle, WA",3,58,2,2.0,6/6/2016,"Sooo not impressed with the quality of food.  Especially given the prices. Under the appetizers menu it lists ""sliders with fries"" but they still charged me extra for the fries.  The sliders themselves were malformed and didn't hold together, like a 4 yr old had been helping mommy in the kitchen that day.  So even with the mini - buns there were still many bites of nothing but soggy bread.  The avocado eggrolls sounded so good on the menu.... mmm creamcheese and avocado. WRONG. It turned out to be an overcooked, overspiced mess.  Neither plate (can't call these small appetizers meals) were worth the $11.50 each we paid for them.  Never going back."
Emily Y.,"Houston, TX",128,47,36,2.0,12/4/2016,"They sat a group of us in a corner behind a pillar.  It was difficult to get anyone's attention.  We waited long in every step of process of getting our meal.  We shared one waiter amongst 6 other tables; and therefore, he was obviously stressed and impatient to speed off catering another table at all times.  Luckily, after a few drinks, that didn't bother us as much.  We ordered ribs, New Chicken Philly pizza, buffalo wings, and calamari.  Honestly, I don't remember much how they tasted.  We would probably just come here for drinks and some appetizers next time."
Rykiel E.,"Seattle, WA",161,165,335,3.0,3/26/2015,"I've been here a few times and it's not the best place to eat at. Pasta is average, burgers are greasy. Even for happy hour, the food isn't really that great. I do enjoy their fries and spinach/artichoke dip to munch on with the drinks at the bar, but everything else was sub-par. Their drinks, on the other hand, are great! Tasty flavored mojitos and really strong margaritas (I had to ask for extra limes just to finish mine)! If you're a fan of fruity alcohol or hard cider, DEFINITELY try the berry burst cider. It's my favorite drink on tap at BJ's! They also have a bunch of mixed beer/cider drinks which i enjoy trying. So far I like the jerry (something) cider. I recently tried their pear cider mixed with an amber ale and its a new favorite.  pizookies are also fun! Anything is good a la mode.  Come here for the drinks, grab a snack, get a dessert.... Skip the meal if you want a pleasant experience lol."
