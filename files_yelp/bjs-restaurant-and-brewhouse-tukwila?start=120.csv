Pete S.,"Seattle, WA",24,194,3,4.0,12/9/2016,I just like the fact that I can have a mini personal pizza and a 4 sampler of beer. If there was nothing else on the menu I would still come for this. No 5 stars for being out of porter and stout at 2 PM on a Thursday? Cheers.
Roanne C.,"Seattle, WA",789,144,1188,2.0,3/17/2015,"I never really enjoy going here. The service is really mediocre no matter what day, time or how many is in your party. The only time I ever go here is for group celebrations, not because of the food, but because they can accomodate for large gatherings.  In my opinion, the food here is waaay too greasy, but then again you get what you pay for. The burger buns look like somebody slathered tablespoons of oil on them; it leaves residue on your fingers when you're holding onto your burger. The fries are never as hot as the burger, or the other way around. The pastas, or pizzas for me is always a safe choice when dining. My favorites would have to be the Cajun Pasta and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. They also have their pizookies down to the tee. You can order any one of them and it would taste delish.  Unless you're craving for a pizookie, I would suggest dining elsewhere to make your time worthwhile. There are a ton of other restaurants to choose from at and around Southcenter Mall, just make sure you explore your options first."
Lindsey R.,"Poulsbo, WA",1,32,9,4.0,12/29/2015,"Good atmosphere, quick seating on a weeknight at the bar.  Very very very large menu, a lot of beer selection and almost too many food options.  A little loud for conversation or taking a phone call but overall it's a bar.. food is ok, good in theory but it seems like they try too hard. Almost overdone trying to be fancier. Some food just needs to be allowed to be, not dressed up and added to.  The berry burst cider is awesome and the variety of available beer is very good"
David R.,"Bothell, WA",34,3,,1.0,1/16/2017,"had about an hour to kill in between our son's baskeball games and stopped in here to get a quick bite to eat. Was dead and probably at about 20% capacity so we thought ""perfect, we'll be in and out of here in an hour with problem"" Hostess tells us it will 15-20 minutes for a table. I point to all the empty tables and she tells me ""nobody is working those areas right now."" What does that even mean? I mean this place was deader than dead, you'd think they'd be begging for some business at this time of the day. We walked out and went next door to the Moctezuma's Mexican Restaurant which was also about 20% full and they seated us right away. Will never go to BJ's again, unreal experience!"
Cody K.,"Bremerton, WA",58,1,,4.0,1/29/2017,Just went in for a quick lunch and had Sojin as our server. He attended to us quickly and even helped out with specific dietary needs that I needed to adhere to. He was friendly and fast! Keep it up!
Kellie D.,"Seattle, WA",54,48,,4.0,7/19/2016,"4 stars basically for price. Had to complain a couple of times last visit. Fries cold, potato skins burnt, drinks extremely watered down and dull. Server lacked any common sense or skill. Wait times are mind numbing for food. I like the Rewards program though since you can generally get something discounted. Pzoooie menu for dessert isn't big. They have maybe 6 flavors. Appetizers are extremely overpriced for some reason. But the burgers never disappoint. I would take them over mall food any day of the week. If you have an issue though you'll have to complain a million times to get them to fix it. They comped my meal last time which was nice but all I really wanted was fresh hot fries not cold stale ones.  Worlds biggest menu. I swear by it. Dozens of brews, beers and fruity fun favorites. I reccomend the bjs brew house burger and an Alabama sunset drink. Perfect combo to round out the night. Open late on weekends til 12 ish perfect for after Movie beer or snack. Huge tvs everywhere, fancy bathrooms, all sports all the time. The homemade root beer is addicting. Bottomless refills for sodas, teas and floats. With steaks, burgers, pasta and comfort food theirs something for everyone"
Faye L.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,12,5.0,4/19/2016,I love the clam chowder very much! With the bread bowl you can not imagine how it is delicious!  Steak are good too. Highly recommend!
Smaly K.,"Tacoma, WA",110,418,1541,4.0,5/4/2015,"I've tried many things at BJ's, and everything seems to be pretty good, although I feel like the food here isn't as great as the Tacoma location.  My favorite is still the Cajun Pasta.  And I do love their shoestring fries."
Gentle V.,"Seattle, WA",60,190,521,2.0,2/14/2015,"Overall, BJs is an average restaurant and will do if you're in a real bind. I give it a 2.5/3 star Yelp rating.  This place reminds me of The Ram, Claim Jumper, or other chain restaurants. I've been here a couple of times, but most recently for a Thursday Happy Hour. My friend and I needed drinks before we watched a movie at AMC, and we thought BJs might be the place. **ORDER LIST DETAILS (on the HH menu): --Chicken Potstickers ($5-$6): Four small, steamed potstickers and a pile of shredded carrots as garnish. The potsticker had a good, meaty flavor profile, but the carrots seemed unnecessary on the plate. --California Chicken flatbread ($4): Two small squared pizzas that were a slight step up from a frozen appetizer purchased at a supermarket. --BJ and Strawberry Mojito (~$4):  Too sweet --Lemon Drop Martini ($5): Too bitter, with none of the sweet tartness needed to make this drink soar. There was no sense of balance between the lemon and vodka. Other considerations: PROS: - Convenient location in Southcenter Mall with easy parking options - Happy Hour is Mon - Thurs until 7 PM and it's relatively cheap ($4-$7/ item) CONS: -Food was edible, but the quality could have been better. - Bar area is not big in size, so you have to wait for a table sometimes when it's crowded. - There wasn't anything unique about my experience here, which is too bad.   - Customer service is hit or miss, but more of a miss overall. However, I'm hopeful that my experience may be different for regular dinner outside of HH.  I may give it a try if I'm not being too picky next time."
Mariah E.,"Seattle, WA",332,161,281,4.0,4/5/2016,"BJ's is a nice place to eat and chill, and catch up with folks. It's a casual feel and I love their pasta!!! Their pizookie... omg, yum?!?!?!"
R R.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,,2.0,7/8/2017,"Went in on a Friday night around 10. It wasn't that busy and we were able to find a table in the bar area right away. It took about 5 minutes to get a server to come to us and basically throw menus on the table as he rushed away. We were ready for at least some drinks...maybe ask if we want drinks before walking away? When the server finally came back around we ordered drinks, an appetizer, and meals. They were out of the beer I wanted so I ordered something else. Drinks came out and they were cold and really good. Our meals came before the appetizer, though. They asked us if we still wanted it, we said yes, and they said they would take it off our bill...no big deal it happens. But we finished our meals and still no appetizer!! We ordered a second round of drinks and the server brought me what I originally had ordered (what he said they were out of) which was a nice gesture because I really did want to try that beer. The server kept apologizing about the appetizer and we told him we didn't want it anymore (the point of an appetizer is to enjoy it over drinks while you wait for dinner). Anyway the appetizer finally came out and we sent it back. They asked us if we wanted to take it home but we had a movie to catch. Checks came out and there was an additional 20% off for the inconvenience which is greatly appreciated. However, I had 3 beers on my check and I only ordered 2! At that time we were in a hurry to get out of there. When we finally got the server's attention he seemed bothered at the situation. Excuse me, but it's not our fault you can't review your checks before dropping them off at your table. We hadn't been to BJ's in a while and this experience didn't make me miss it. The food we did get to eat was very good....still wishing I had my appetizer though."
Caitlyn K.,"Bellingham, WA",1,8,4,5.0,7/3/2016,"I honestly can't remember the last time I had such good time with friends and such great service! Our group (4 adults and an infant) went for dinner on a Sunday and were seated in under 10 minutes with no reservations. Cynthia was an amazing server, she had great recommendations for both food and beer. Brought extra dipping sauce multiple times, refilled water quickly and generally checked in. We never felt pushed or rushed. Even the server assistants were great, the two guys addressed an issue (out of a beer ordered for a flight) in a super friendly and timely manner. Food wise we ordered two deep dish pizzas and two pizookis. It was longer for the pizzas due to cooking time but Cynthia let us know the status so we weren't worried or left waiting. Overall they had good portions, we had some leftovers but not too much. PROS Cynthia was awesome and rolled with the punches Delicious food Quick service, in both seating and food CONS None this trip, has been loud previously but the booth was nice and easy to talk in"
Dante H.,"Sacramento, CA",6,22,18,5.0,10/29/2016,Our waiter James has been great and when we had a issue with the order we didn't have someone giving us attitude but a smile. The manager even came over and made us feel good and promised to take care of us. One thing I didn't mention was the issue was our fault ordering the wrong burger off the menu (pulled pork burger instead of beef brisket burger) they corrected it fast. Bj's ftw. Thank you for the excellent se
Sandy H.,"Kent, WA",0,2,,2.0,6/26/2017,"It was Sunday and one of the hottest days of the year. My hubby and I decided to go out to eat. As we walked in, it didn't seem busy at all which was great. We sat down got our menus and it probably took us about 6 or 7 mins to decided what we wanted. We ordered two appetizers, potato skins and Ahi Poke, the Ahi Poke came out. I had the Ahi Poke before there and it was delicious but this one, I was disappointed, it did not taste like the one I had before. It was not flavorful, the dressing tasted a little sour. I ate it because I was hungry. But never again, will I order it. It took 18 mins for my hubbys appetizer to come out. How did I know this, I took a picture of my Ahi Poke and looked at the time stamped. :( A minute later our entrees came out. The point of an appetizer is to eat it before our entrees. Then give us a few mins break. He ordered the Jambalaya, it was NOT worth $18!  I ordered the shrimp and arugula pita taco about $11. It was alright, I felt like I could of made something better. I overheard another server telling a customer that because it has been slow all day they sent a few employees home. Even though it was slow, the service shouldnt have to be slow. Total was $59 I don't think I'll come here again unless a friend wants to come here."
Kristina K.,"Kent, WA",120,223,36,5.0,2/16/2016,"BJ's has the best happy hour, the most amazing pizza and exceptional service. Not to mention the wide array of beer options and food choices! I bring friends and family here often as it's one of the best restaurants in the area!"
Nathan T.,"Phoenix, AZ",152,5,,5.0,12/13/2016,"Hey guys so my girlfriend, her family, her friends, and I all went to BJ's last Friday for my girlfriend's Birthday celebration. We had a blast there was a total of around 10 of us and our waiter (Sojin) was so kind. He just made the experience that much better. He got everything right when it comes to our food and always had something nice to say to us. We had a complicated bill as I didn't want my girlfriend to pay but Sojin handled nicely. He just made the experience at BJ's that much better. He served us with great customer service. Totally recommend BJ's"
Teresa M.,"Kent, WA",41,428,119,3.0,3/8/2015,"I had flashbacks of The Cheesecake Factory for a minute. My very best friend, spiral bound booklet, rears its ugly head again. Luckily I knew I just wanted an appy and didn't bother flipping through the whole thing.  We sat in the bar section where it was pretty dead. The bartender was friendly enough and I enjoyed the berry cider they had on tap. The flat bread was actually better than I thought it would be for such an average establishment. Nothing to write home about, but it's not bad."
Matthew S.,"Warrensburg, MO",6,104,88,4.0,11/21/2016,Took 20 minutes to get drinks and so far waiting a hour for our entrees but so worth the wait. Amazing food.
Toe-knee N.,"Renton, WA",317,11,,3.0,1/27/2016,"I come here fairly often due to it being close to where I live.  In terms of food.  It's one of the better restaurants I like to go to every now and then.  They have a lot of different selections to  choose from ranging pizza,  pasta, burgers and so on. Their wings are pretty good even though they don't have a variety like buffalo wild wings but the quality definitely tops the competition. I also love the fact that they carry my favorite hot sauce (cholula). BJ's was also one of the few places where I could count my macros when I was doing a strict diet because not only that they had nutritional facts but they had a lower calorie menu as well.  My only complaint is the service.  I would say 8 out 10 times the service is horrible.  Food takes forever to come out.  Do not go here if you're on a hurry. When they are good they are great.  I use to work in the restaurant industry.  I understand there are times that it gets busy or if you're understaffed however I go here often to know that is not the case.  Either it's poor management or training.  It would of gotten an extra star if it wasn't for the service."
Marianne G.,"Renton, WA",9,2,,1.0,7/24/2016,"If you're looking to order online and have your food ready when you get there, don't count on it. First off, the curbside parking spots that were distinctly marked as such were all taken by people that obviously weren't ordering to go so I had to go find a parking spot and had the hassle of taking my infant child out of the car and carry his car seat inside. I get inside and have to wait for a person to come to the counter. My order obviously wasn't even started as I had to wait 35 minutes for my order that I had requested to be picked up at a certain time. The pizza quality wasn't very good and I was given enough sauce for my wings for just one. I was thoroughly disappointed with the food and with the experience. Needless to say, I won't be going back."
