Chris J.,"Auburn, WA",61,60,16,1.0,1/18/2016,"Started good, and ended terrible. Who waits an hour for food? I blew my top when a server tells a coworker, ""I guess I should stop watching the game, and do my job"" near our table. When asking a server to speak to the manager, she gave me a nasty look and proceeds to walk away telling me it's obvious they were busy! Besides wanting to drag the butch out by her hair, I was ready to rearrange the entire restaurant. I was furious. Our food arrived shortly after the manager arrived. It was luke warm and cold! It sat for more than 20 minutes, as I stuck my finger down the middle of the burger.  Look, I get it. Servers assume when a young family with 2 kids comes in, they might not tip very well. It was clearly obvious, as an older couple arrived after us, and finished their meals before ours arrived. Needless to say, I am a great tipper, and I always take care of our servers when they give good service. I even gave our server a $5 tip, even though we never touched our food, and left starving. Dinner for me was Taco Bell. At least they can pump out a hot gut rot meal in less than 2 minutes out of a drive thru. My suggestion? Avoid BJ's, especially if you have kids. Perhaps next time, this location can make us drink out of separate water fountains, and utilize restrooms to segregate the poor families from the elegant tippers. I seriously felt disgusted after our visit. I assumed I would have a happy ending by visiting BJ's..."
Tyler H.,"Ogden, UT",1,4,,1.0,4/23/2017,Had a bad experience this places has gone down in the past few years. Service and food was a disappointment.
Joanne C.,"Auburn, WA",36,23,6,2.0,10/20/2016,"Not to happy with this restaurant this time around.   Service was good,  waitress was friendly and quick.   However my Brewhouse burger was the worst.   It was greasy,  I needed extra napkins in order to wipe the shine from my hands,  my bun was soaked in grade,  my guess is they do it that way to ads flavor?  Get it crunchy?   Well I couldn't even taste the blue cheese it was so greasy.   Then my fries were not fresh,  it was obvious they'd been sitting under a heat lamp.   Then I asked for ranch and I was thoroughly disappointed,  it tasted like cheap,  low fat store bought ranch.   Not returning."
Amy R.,"Tacoma, WA",27,19,,3.0,11/19/2016,"Food is great except my Cesar salad. Service could be better, our waitress keeps forgetting to refill our drinks. Waitress is really nice."
Renee G.,"Kent, WA",37,12,45,5.0,2/18/2017,"Last night we went to BJ's for dinner!  My husband just discovered he has quite a few allergies to high fructose corn syrup, gluten, milk, onion and garlic not to mention a few others!  Anyway yesterday was not a good day for him but by the evening and very little food he was starving!  When we got to the restaurant we were seated right away and we immediately told our server of his allergies!  She brought over the manager and together they discussed and decided on an option for him!  Our order was placed and then we waited for our meal!  When it got there both dishes looked really good and my husband was so hungry and excited to try something completely new to him now because of his allergies!  Upon cutting up his chicken he discovered onions in his dish....luckily it was before he had any of the dish!  We told our server who brought the manager over and she took the dish back and they made him a new one!  Awhile later a new dish came out for him and he again was so excited to try it!  He said it was very good and the server and manager both came to check on him!  They also told us they were going to comp our meals because of the mistake and long wait!  Now that's customer service and I'm sure we will be going back!  Thank you BJ's"
Brenda L.,"Renton, WA",0,9,,2.0,10/26/2016,"I used to love this place. The beer rocks. But tonight was my last visit. Ordered a flatbread and it will literally raw. The dough wasn't even cooked. The manger came over and basically just said ""I'm sorry."" Well still a waste of my money, so unfortunately I'm done with this place."
Maréo M.,"Spokane, WA",130,8,4,4.0,1/5/2016,"BJ's is a great casual restaurant for dinner or lunch. Might be a bit loud and crowded but what do you expect it's a brewery/bar restaurant. Food was great. Had the baby back ribs with a side of their thin cut fries. Very tasty and filling. Good portion size for the price. For dessert, a chocolate chip Pazookie which is so damn good every time. Great place but 4 stars for having to wait quite a while, and our server seemed to be hung over or something. Will be back of course."
Camryn G.,"Renton, WA",0,4,,3.0,4/18/2017,"The food is usually great, orders in house are right 9 times out of 10. However, ordering meals for pickup/to go is a joke. I have placed orders for my office numerous times and not once has it been correct. If you order through the online system, they claim it never went through. Even if you have a confirmation number. So you arrive to pick up the food and end up waiting another half hour (at the minimum) for them to prepare everything. If you order it over the phone, something gets dropped. So again, you wait for the order to get prepared while the rest of your food gets cold. Again, the food is great and we will continue to place our lunch orders but it would be nice if the process was smoother."
Shawndee G.,"Seattle, WA",16,3,,1.0,9/16/2016,Ordered potstickers first hubby or oredr chili (Luke warm) and old school tomatoes basil flat bread. Chili first flat second and then potstickers after I asked where the were at. Flat bread was the worst ever not crispy and potstickers came out after everything. Disappointed....to say the least
Grace L.,"Anchorage, AK",1,112,20,2.0,9/5/2016,"Large hamburger and wedge fries looked great, but burger meat had zero flavor. Ate a few wedges then BAM got a mouth of rotten/moldy potato. Cmon guys!! Won't be back!"
Mike S.,"Aurora, CO",1,11,,5.0,10/28/2016,I had lunch last Thursday and I couldn't be happier with the level of service as well as the quality of food.  The only thing that would have made my lunch better would have been if they still offered the cheeseburger pizza. All around a fantastic experience.
Kevin S.,"Goose Creek, SC",15,74,32,4.0,1/4/2016,"Always a good time at this restaurant.  If you like Root Beer (or sodas in general) you will enjoy their handcrafted selection.  I suppose there's alcohol too but that's not my bag.  The pot roast is delectable but not a huge portion so skip it if you want a massive meal.   The definitive star of the menu, hands down, is the parmesan crusted chicken.  If you don't want any guesswork and want a delicious plate, this is the choice.  Period."
Katarina H.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,1,,1.0,1/6/2017,"If i could give this place 0 stars I would. We had a party of 9 for a friends birthday so of course you have to be a little understanding with your waitress, but we didn't even receive water until 20 min. after we've been seated. Half the restaurant wasn't even full and I saw a ton of waitstaff just hanging around. Another waitress stopped by to ask if we had been helped and looked horrified that no one had came yet and rushed off to grab the waitress that was suppose to be at our table. The waitress finally came in and took our order after another 20 min. went by. We then waited 45 min. until our food came and it was cold. She never came and checked in on us once. The manager had to go get her to come get our dessert orders, which by then I was so over it. When the checks came, she was very rude and snobby that we all wanted separate checks(i understand splitting them is hard but a little professionalism would've been nice) and when she was giving my friend change, she kind of tossed it in front of him. I have never seen such bad service here before but I will not be returning."
Camilla M.,"Federal Way, WA",58,130,544,4.0,2/5/2016,"Gotta love this place. Appetizers and dinner is always good for the price! The pizza is delicious considering this isn't an Italian specialty restaurant. The beer sampling option is excellent and availability of seating is always good as well as Quick service. If you haven't already, definitely check this place out with your family one evening or hithe bar to watch a game they have TVs"
Julie S.,"Seattle, WA",10,4,,1.0,9/10/2016,Came in for lunch. The food was good. The service was ridiculously slow & basically TERRIBLE!  It took over 30 minutes to get our food. No one even  bothered to check on us. And after we finally got our meals no one bothered to see if it was OK.  This includes the manager who brought our meals but offered no apologies.  We will not be ba
AlyxandraMonique S.,"Seattle, WA",232,177,614,3.0,10/21/2015,"The main entrees at BJ's aren't amazing, but the Pizookies are definitely to die for! I come here mainly for the Pizookie or if I am with my friends and need to kill some time. I suggest sitting at the bar when eating here because it gets pretty packed on the weekends.  I don't really like the food here because the quality and presentation is almost the same as Red Robins or Applebee's. The bartenders, hosts, waiters and waitresses are always very friendly even when there is a lot of people. You can definitely bring smaller children here or even big parties because the restaurant is ideal for that type of age group and party sizes.  If you aren't sure as to which Pizookie to order, I suggest ordering the Trio. The Trio comes in three different flavors of your choice in smaller portions.  Note: Parking gets crazy busy at Southcenter, so parking may be difficult."
Monique C.,"Federal Way, WA",49,1,,2.0,10/12/2016,"By far the worst service I've had in a long time....20min to be greeted by a server, 10 min for a beer, over priced lack luster food, overall a bad experience all around."
Alex L.,"Kent, WA",117,46,9,1.0,6/10/2016,"Last night was the worst experience I had with BJs. A few friends and I came here for dinner to celebrate a graduation and we order some appetizers and pizza. While talking to some friends we realize how long of a wait it was for our food. The pizza came out before the appetizers! First, the pizza was cold as if it sat there for quite some time. Then the appetizers came out and it was deep fried calamari so that usually doesn't take long to make, but it was so cold and soggy that it was nasty. We return back our food and ask for fresh pizzas and calamari. The manager apologize and then our food came out within 10 mins. We had to ask the manager to comp our food for the inconvenience they caused us. I felt bad for our server because she did great and that's what the 1 star is for. The food is what lacks    at this location."
Lindsey D.,"Kent, WA",116,4,5,5.0,3/5/2017,"Sojin is the BEST! prefect service, fast, attentive and fun. The food was delicious and the service was excellent."
Danny T.,"Issaquah, WA",46,4,,1.0,9/17/2016,"We waited over 90 minutes for our table when we were told it would only take 45 min.  When we were finally seated, the patio was nearly empty!  It took another 20 minutes before we got our waters and I had to ask for our silverware too!  In all, we spent over 3 hours from start to finish.  I do not recommend this place unless you have a half day for dinner."
