Sami M.,"Covington, WA",89,12,,5.0,10/5/2016,Went in yesterday with some friends. We had a waiter named Ryan. He was the best server we fm have ever had at this location. He checked on us multiple times and we very friendly. Just wanted to say thanks for the awesome service.
J B.,"The Colony, TX",4,58,2,5.0,1/26/2017,"I goto BJs probably twice a week, and have been to many different locations. This one is in the top 3 for sure. The wait staff is awesome. I don't think I've had one bad server at this location. The top ones in my opinion in no particular order is Kayla, Sojin, and Manuel. These people provide stellar service every time."
Christian L.,"Orem, UT",131,16,2,3.0,6/18/2016,"My BJ'S experience was 100% average. The food was fine. The restaurant was fine. Our waitress was fine. Everything was just fine. Everywhere else around like Cheesecake Factory and Olive Garden was incredibly crowded and had about an hour wait. Even though it was a Saturday night at 6PM, we were able to get seated as soon as we walked in. It was a little pricy but other than that it was just completely fine."
Teressa L.,"Newcastle, WA",87,543,467,4.0,10/20/2014,"We dropped in for lunch on a Sat.  It wasn't too busy yet.  But the servers weren't quite sure who had what tables and we ended up waiting for drinks b/c apparently our server is now moved over, and we got the bartender.  First time visit it worked out ok b/c the menu is large and we needed the time to look it over.  However, the entire visit the food runner was going to wrong tables...so that switch screwed everything up for awhile.  Server was friendly and helpful to our questions.  We got some boneless wings, shrimp tacos and a club sandwich to share.  All were very good.  The 'spicy' wings were fine for my son and had a good taste.  The sandwich was huge and two of us split it.  The shrimp tacos were fantastic!!  Just enough food on the plate.   For a general everything menu we were pleased with the food and would come back to try more.  It all had good taste and came out warm.   Prices were about average for most places these days.  Our 3 meals and lots of rootbeer were still under $60.   I can see how this place would get super busy and service go downhill quickly.  Like I said, for us, it worked out we didn't care about quick that day.   We did buy a growler to go and the contents were super good!!!"
Rob S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,9,,4.0,3/4/2016,"House beers are average at best. I tried their Nutty Brewnette and while I found it drinkable the beer was not filtered which caused the flavors to overlap. I got a half California sandwich with the avocado and house salad. It was delightful and exactly what I was looking for. The cucumbers in the salad were diced which added originality and something different to a pretty bland dish. And the sandwich was large considering it was only a half,  the chicken was also strips rather than one large piece.  I believe that allowed for more of the juices to flow within the sandwich making it more moist.  I would recommend but stay away from the house beers."
Reginald N.,"Kent, WA",144,59,247,3.0,2/20/2013,"Just had lunch at BJs and thought I'd offer another perspective to the disappointed.  Having worked in the restaurant industry (Cucina! Cucina! and Bahama Breeze), I consider myself pretty understanding with delays and wait time, esp if the food is worth it.  Especially in the Southcenter area, how many times can you do Olive Garden, Red Robin or Applebees?!  I find it interesting that patrons will wait for over 30 minutes and not say anything rt away for fear of someone 'ruining' their food. Honestly I return to BJs for their PIZOOKIE'S and Snacks and Small Bites.  The Cookie's and Cream Pizookie is so good!  And the Red Velvet was tasty, too!  You can even do the Trio and select 3 different pizookies.  Their small bites are like happy hr selections available anytime.  New $2.95 BRATWURST SLIDERS were excellent!  Try the wontons or the fresh mozz and tomato salad, too. As for the subpar service, I can only speak for myself but whether I sat in the bar with a friend or dined in with my nephew and nieces, we have had nothing but pretty good service.  Especially when I brought my nephew and nieces, our server was friendly and engaged them (which I appreciate).  I would probably come more often if the Happy hour value was more competitive!!!  Just $2 off for HH apps?!  Why not half off? (pls note, BJs) I just don't find myself at the mall on the regular but if you're looking for some affordable selections (compared to Joey's or Dukes), try BJs and see for yourself.  Not everyone has a bad experience."
Katie O.,"Federal Way, WA",35,3,,4.0,11/1/2015,Food is GREAT reason for the 4 stars Summary of service:  We felt forgotten and devalued for what we spent. This location needs more staff or something because the two waiters I saw running around avoided eye contact when we were trying to get their attention. Worth trying since food is great and that's the point of eating out.
Ruby P.,"Kent, WA",2,189,43,5.0,9/26/2015,"the balsamic glazed chicken and mashed potatoes  the avocado spring rolls are the only things i come there for. but the star of the show are the PZOOKIES, can't ever go wrong and no matter how much other places have cookies n ice-cream , they can't ever ever compare to the deliciousness of these...   service sucks tho.. the 5 stars are more for the pzookies..."
Elizabeth N.,"Kent, WA",42,30,131,3.0,8/25/2015,"I would only come here if I didn't know where else to eat and if it's lunch hour because they have a pretty good deal. It's just basic mediocre food so nothing special here. I like to get a salad that comes with half a sandwich and fries during the lunch hour. Fills me up for a decent price! Tbh, you should just skip the main courses and go straight to the pizookie. You'll be happier with that."
Kelley S.,"Renton, WA",0,37,34,4.0,11/9/2014,"BJ's is a great spot to grab a bite to eat and watch the game before a movie. I wouldn't go here for an anniversary dinner but I still enjoy the meal every time. I ordered (and loved!) the cherry chipotle salmon with asparagus and a margarita. The dinner was so delicious, I'm going to look online for recipes to try to replicate the glaze. The margarita was a great size but pretty weak on the tequila and heavy on the mixer. For $9.50 I was hoping to get a bit of a buzz.  My boyfriend ordered the brew house burger and enjoyed it. He says the beer list is a solid selection of home brewed beer. Brandon was our server and he was very attentive and sweet. I like that they have a lite menu :)"
Daniel F.,"Lake Stevens, WA",6,40,1,1.0,7/12/2015,"Just ordered using curbside service and when i pulled in and called the number on sign like directed from my confirmation email stating my order was placed, the young lady said that they never got it, so i went in and a rude guy stated i needed to go to take out ordering side and that they  always have that problem.  So i then had to sit to have my pizza made and cooked, which then gets worse for 15 dollars i got about a 3 dollar value, i would of rather of bought a frozen pizza which would have been better... this place really sucked in my opinion Thanks"
Patrick B.,"Kent, WA",45,206,130,5.0,10/1/2015,"BJ's has fast become one of my go to favorites when it comes to good American food. The restaurant is large and the entire thing is set up like a sports bar but there are two definitive areas. The family dining area and the bar. The staff has always been super friendly and very attentive at every BJ's we've gone to and the food is superb.  From the appetizers to the entrees and dessert. They may be a brewery first and foremost but they know how to hire some chefs! Some of the best calamari appetizers we've had anywhere and if you visit during happy hour, you can load up on multiple appetizers to share and get to sample everything.  They do brew their own beer and I have tried a lot of them but if you don't like anything they make, they do offer a few other brews which is a nice contrast to other brew pubs that only serve what they make.  I've ordered a lot of different items here from their pizza to ribs to steak. I love their rib eye with a loaded baked potato but sometimes, they get steaks with a very high fat content. I like a well marbled steak but near 50% fat is a little too much so I have to try other menu items on occasion to avoid that happening.  The place is friendly and inviting and there are TV's all over the place so that you can watch whatever sporting event is on at any given time and they don't charge an arm and a leg so you won't walk out feeling like you've been robbed.  I will remain a BJ's fan for as long as they keep up the good work. Thanks for reading."
Heather M.,"Olympia, WA",28,12,3,5.0,7/25/2016,"Sojin was a very knowledgable server!! When asked which Cab Sav wine to order, I received the best one!! Thank you for attentive service, delicious food! We will be back!!"
Jose M.,"Kent, WA",15,131,101,4.0,9/12/2015,"The food was great but service was slooow! It took our waitress a good 15 minutes before we got our drink orders taken. Then it took at least that long to bring the drinks to the table. We got our appetizers but no plates. We got tired of waiting for her to come by so I got the bussers attention and he brought them. Mine was dirty but I wiped it off and put my bones on it. We had burgers and pizza, both were very good and great huge portions. We finished up with a pazookie, I think that's what it's called. It's a big fresh baked cookie with a ball of ice cream on it. Very nice! So big scores for the food, the service not so much."
Scott P.,"Southeast, Las Vegas, NV",68,46,5,2.0,8/18/2016,"Well I have to say the food is pretty good. However the service was terrible and is way overpriced. Not too many of the servers there are very friendly. I went with a group for happy hour. The main problem was that when you order off the happy hour menu they don't like you. And the be honest, at those prices this menu did not make me very happy. My drink was still $9 and the boneless wings were $8. This is higher than most places regular price. And after we had two drinks and finished eating the server brought out checks and refused to bring another drink. Well it's the last time I will eat there."
Mitchell L.,"Redmond, WA",1,72,1,2.0,3/6/2017,"Went in with family for lunch on a Saturday. When we sat down it was pretty empty. We ordered and our food took a little bit of time. I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich with fries. When it came out, it was clear it had been sitting for a while. The cheese wasn't gooey, it was like melted cheese that had been cooling of for several minutes. Another person ordered soup, similar issue, it was cold. He had them take it back, and it took 5-10 minutes to get a new soup. This one was better, but also not hot. The food tasted ok, but getting lukewarm cold is always a disappointment."
Philicia S.,"Seattle, WA",194,595,517,2.0,1/26/2013,"Not the best food, its okay. Flat breads and pizza are fresh and great as well as the pizookies but everything else doesnt taste as fresh to me.  Pretty in there, loud atmosphere.  Service is slow everytime I come in but I know its because the servers have way too much tables that they could handle and I know its not their fault, that goes to management.  I go for the variety of beers, pizza and dessert. Mmm! pretty strong pina colada too!"
Kathleen O.,"Redmond, WA",0,7,,3.0,5/22/2016,"So.. 20-30 min wait to be seated, which I guess is pretty average for places like this and when you have a party of 5. Waiter was very friendly, and our orders were taken pretty quickly as well once seated. However.. The waiter forgot a water, Sierra Mist, and the 4 of us got our food, and finished it, before one of our friends even got her pizza. They literally had to make a new pizza because her first pizza literally disappeared.. The manager who came and figured out the whole situation was super accommodating and friendly though, and comped our friends pizza and even offered us dessert on the house. Really appreciated how the manager went out of her way to make our dinner better. Overall an average experience."
Rubina P.,"Renton, WA",12,104,95,4.0,11/11/2015,"This place is really good! The service is pretty decent, and I've never had any major issues . I will say that one time I came here and they overcooked all of our fries. Also, I was planning on eating here with some friends on a busy night. So we called ahead 30 mins. We ended up showing up about 40 mins later and they still had us wait for a table. Not long though. I understand yall are busy but..."
Amanda L.,"Renton, WA",17,19,3,5.0,6/4/2016,"Been here twice and had great experiences with both! Our waiter, Sojin, was very fun and friendly and our food arrived in a timely manner and tasted wonderful!"
