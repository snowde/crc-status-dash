Gloria H.,"Gig Harbor, WA",0,15,,2.0,7/30/2017,"Flew into SeaTac wanted a good, juicy burger not what I received. We arrive wanted to sit outdoors all but two were empty. Asked hostess to be seated outside she told us it would be 20 min wait. We asked why, She said the tables were dirty. Well the guy standing, who works there, and her continued to carry on a conversation. We couldn't believe it. We seat ourselves in the bar order a a BJ's Brew burger with bacon and cheese it arrives way under cooked and with no sauces at all, nor were we asked nor was any dropped off. I take a bite it is so so salty with no burger taste and red inside.  He brings us mayo and burger sauce after we ask for it drops it off then disappears. He then shows up 10 minutes later to ask if want another drink. It is obvious there is one bite out of my burger then asks if it's tasting good. I said this is not your best burger, spins on his heels and looks back and says oh I'll tell the kitchen and leaves! Never offered to take my burger and get another one that was at least cooked. Comes back again another 10 min later and asks if we want another drink we say no. He then asks if we want a box to take it home!!! Seriously it's barely cooked, salty and dry and you ask if I want to take it home!! No I want you to throw it away, you idiot! Brings us our bill and as he leaves says I took the burger off and walks away. Terrible, terrible service.  No excuse at all!"
John S.,"Denver, CO",22,24,1,4.0,3/22/2016,"I come here all the time with my wife,  and sometimes with inlaws. BJs never disappoints this crowd. While yes it a chain, the service has always been good, and the food has always been prompt. If I had to find something to complain about, I would say that, as far as American food goes, this place could diversafy their menu a bit a more."
Tyler L.,"Renton, WA",1,9,,4.0,7/19/2016,"I had dinner here Friday night.  The place was really busy when we got there around 8pm so we sat at the bar.  THere were two bartenders working, one seemed to make drinks for the other servers and the other took care of the guest at the bar.  Our bartender was like the shortest bartender ever and her name was Sammi.  She was a riot.  Took crap and doled it right back out to everyone.  Really funny and witty.  Kept our drinks filled up too, even though we had to push them across the bar so she could reach them.  Seriously,  she is a hobbit.  Food was ok but the cole slaw sucks.  Would have probably given 5 stars if they had just thrown the slaw away before bringing the food.  Also would not put MMA on the TV's but had PBR bull riding on?  Oh well.   Sammi is worth the trip."
Marques J.,"Graham, WA",20,56,17,5.0,7/11/2015,"My fiance and her mom had the ""pink Cadillac"" and it was quite amazing. Recommended to us by our fabulous waitress Misty. She did a great job at not getting annoyed by their indecisiveness and getting our order right ""great service deserves great tips"""
Annie B.,"Seattle, WA",22,10,5,5.0,7/14/2016,"A girlfriend and I came by for lunch and some mild day-drinking today and Sojin was prompt and courteous. He kept the drinks flowing and made sure we always had everything we needed. The food was good, the drinks were great and the service was fantastic. Thanks Sojin!"
Ebonee R.,"Mt. Baker, Seattle, WA",0,2,,4.0,6/23/2016,Came here last weekend to celebrate my aunt's graduation.  Great improvement from the last time we were there.  The food was good and Sojin was our server and he was amazing.  Very on top of everything and attentive to our needs.  We ordered an appetizer that didn't turn out the way we thought it would  and he immediately took it back and was very apologetic and understanding.  Next time we come back I hope he is our server again.
Arica S.,"Manhattan, NY",287,81,23,5.0,6/23/2015,"So I've been here twice and Ron (my bartender both times), is THE MAN. I threw him a test and asked him to make a chocolate martini with very broad direction. He nailed it. Sweeeeet!  All my drinks from him have been great. Very cool and attentive. I like his energy. If I were to pick a color, I'd say blue. He's cool and calm. LOL. Anyways, I went out on a limb and ordered the honey-sriracha brussel sprouts. Ron said they were good. I was hesitant. I went all in and they were SO GOOD.  'GODDAMN, GODDAMN!!' ~ Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction Yeah, that good. Well...then again drugs are a different type of high.........I digress. Everything I order at BJ's is really good, comes out fairly quickly, and the service is always on point. As for the drunkies (a.k.a. older men, intoxicated but still...mmm...'thirsty') eh...not so much. Then again I kinda walked into that stuff. I'm alone, pretty girl, sitting at the bar...eh...easy bait. Little do they know I'm a piranha.  *clamps teeth together*   :D  So anyways love this place. Keep doin' whatcha doin mane!"
Ashley N.,"Seattle, WA",42,6,,1.0,3/12/2016,Didn't even sit down. Had a dinner party tonight and what a mess. We reserved for a really big party but there was no coordination between the servers. One of the servers was extremely rude after one server told us we could use the booths when our party overflowed. Yes I know it's frustrating since our party was 10+ people but he had no customer service skills. Some of the party just left because we were so upset. Last time going there.
Erin W.,"Shoreline, WA",0,15,,3.0,12/29/2016,"I'm not usually a big fan of chain restaurants, but the selection was great for a family that couldn't agree on what we wanted! The ambiance was good, but the service was slow and so-so."
Carrie T.,"Kent, WA",1,195,4,4.0,11/30/2016,"I've been here a few times for dinner and/or happy hour.  So this is a general overview review, the servers and hostesses have all been very friendly and attentive. We are greeted as soon as we come in. The time spent getting seated, ordering, getting our food, servers checking on us and time allowed to eat, enjoy and chat with friends and then wrapping things up have all been just fine! I never felt rushed, I never had to look for someone. It is a standard ""American fare"" with burgers, fish, salads, soups pastas etc. so no surprises there. I like that they do switch the menu around so I see some usual dishes and then I see some seasonal or new ones.  The menu is a ""book"". Tonight I lost my place! There are some ""lighter"" dishes which is good and plenty of appetizers which are pretty large in portion and can be a meal too if you add soup or salad.  it's a brewhouse so lots of beers but also glad they have cocktails, wines and sangrias to choose from as I am not a big fan of beer (yeh....ok....I am not...)  I think the quality of the food is good for the price.  The price is about average in comparison to similar restaurants though I think there are little more ""healthier"" and have more vegetarian dishes to choose from  compared to like Rams or Red Robins.  I shall be back!"
Jami B.,"Federal Way, WA",6,9,,2.0,2/14/2016,"So this review is both based on service and food. Let's start with the good. I was looking for a pizza place other than domino's or pizza Hut or the other standard places. We had heard the pizza here was great. Went online and placed our order. The process was quick and easy and we choose to pick up.our food at 11:15. The pizza itself was AMAZING!!! My partner is definitely a pizza aficionado and she adored it. We got the pepperoni extreme. The sauce was great! We also adored the julienned pepperonis. They were great. What made it for us though was the dough. It was soft and ligjt. Sometimes with deep dish you get hard and crusty dough. Definitely not the case here. It's going to be our go to pizza place now!! If this review was only on food, you would have a five star review.  The service was were there this place needs big time work. I'm new to the area and was just looking for a place that was open late. The website said nothing about it being only available to a certain time. Let us do everything and never gave us any notices about takeout being closed. Get to the place and the hostess takes 7 - 9 minutes to even come up front and acknowledge I'm there. Have about 5 servers go by and just give me nasty looks and not ask if I need anything. Finally the lady comes up. When I tell her I'm there for takeout she gets SUPER NASTY! First words out of here mouth are, in a nasty, nasty tone, our takeout closes at ten. Don't place orders after that. I explain that   here and I had no clue and the website didn't advise me so. She then says well don't   again, not jokingly. Then takes her another about 15 mins to.find my order and ring me up. If she would.have just went and got my order and POLITELY mentioned they closed take out at 10, would have been totally satisified. Will I be back? Maybe it will be better inside but this experience was a major turn off! Better training and management needed for sure!"
Anita C.,"Renton, WA",165,42,138,3.0,4/28/2015,"Food are pretty good, services are friendly. Restaurant background is nice. Best for 21+ years old!"
Mohanad A.,"Kent, WA",2,1,2,1.0,1/22/2017,"The customer service in this place was bizarre and not on a good way, once we settled in, we waited for 25 minutes and no one came to serve us, not even drinks. Once we complained to them, we had a new server and the plates that were given were wet. This wasn't a pleasant experience. We have came several times here before, and the customer service was better, the employees had a smile on their faces and they were constantly in and out of things. Now it completely flopped."
Daniel S.,"Sedona, AZ",0,2,,1.0,7/11/2017,"Visiting from phowenix on business. I like our BJ'S on Northern and thought I would see how the two compare. Will there was no comparison tonight. I ate at the bar. I'm dieting  so i ordered the superfood salad with cajun shrimp minus the blue berries , jicama, and sweet corn in addition I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. Bartender didn't write down a thing. When the salad came out there qwas no shrimp on the salad. I told the Bartender she said it would be righr out. I had to ask for the salt an pepper. When the lettuce wraps arrived I reminded the bartender that I still did not have the shrimp. She said it was coming an I would not be charged. I finished the salad and the lettuce wraps still no shrimp. The bartender asked if she could remove my dishes and I reminded her I never received my shrimp. She asked if I still wanted them. I said no.  I did not leave a tip. My bill was $25.19. What would you have done besides not going to BJ's?"
B B.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,138,23,3.0,4/15/2016,"I've been to BJs in Portland a few times and to this location twice. Same beer. This location is very nicely decorated, music isn't real loud, so that's nice. I don't want my experience to sound like a concert hall. The beer selection is pretty fair. Didn't count the taps though. They had 11 core beers and probably about a dozen guest taps. I found a few I liked. I glanced at the food menu, but didn't order anything since I wasn't hungry. The food prices are definitely those of a nice restaurant. In other words, don't come here expecting to spend under $10 on a plate. There might be some, but the majority of things I looked at were at least that much. Most items were more. Usually I have wraps, sandwiches, or mushroom swiss burgers. They did not have anything I wanted. While they had burgers, it was clear their focus is pizza. I found the beer to be somewhat expensive. A few for $5.95, most were $6.25, which I think is high considering beer is *cheap* to make. The only beers I will spend that much on are German or Belgians from their origin. All of these were standard beers. Place was clean, ages were all over the place. I would say mostly 30s and 40s. Most people were dressed business casual, but it was only about 7 at night, not late, so I wasn't expecting the late night party crowd. Two ladies were bartenders. I didn't catch their names. A young blonde girl with a pony tail and a black girl. The blonde rushed me a little, seemed more interested in getting me a beer than samples, although she did so without incident. If I'm spending over $6 on a beer, you bet I want to know what I'm drinking. I'm not just going to pick something to have a drink. I don't work that way. The black girl was alright, a little more serious, not so much playful. She offered another drink, but I was done at that point. I would go back if I was with someone and we wanted a nice place to go, but I probably wouldn't go back by myself. The beer is a little pricey for me considering nothing was spectacular. Not sure if I would have dinner there since nothing on the menu jumped out at me."
Rita T.,"Seattle, WA",0,20,,1.0,6/16/2016,"Okay. What is with the restaurants at the mall with the loud music? You are a restaurant, not a night club. I hadn't been to this place in while. Normally the pizza is really good. I ordered a mini California Supreme and it was still a bit doughy on the inside. Our server was nice, but not very attentive. I ordered a club soda with muddled limes and it came back with lemon. I got the attention of what looked like a manager walking by and she got me a new drink. After our food arrived we pretty much never saw our server again. It would have been nice to get a refill on my drink. I didn't bother to complain while I was there because my friend and I were trying to make it to a movie. I think I'll just hit up pizza at the food court next time I want pizza before a movie."
Mike B.,"Redondo Beach, CA",6,17,,3.0,7/2/2016,Good food excellent beer. Nice atmosphere at the bar. Service is standard excellent selection of brews. But why do they serve tap water? You can't even be bothered to filter the chlorine? Lame. Deduction.
Holli M.,"Renton, WA",74,180,438,2.0,6/14/2015,We always order the chicken bacon ranch pizza and it is delish. However today we arrived before 12. Lots of open tables but it took about 20 minutes to place our order. We were about to leave. Slow service. We also ordered the lettuce wraps and they were just ok would not order it again.
Jerry M.,"Puyallup, WA",0,37,,3.0,11/21/2016,Sold and consistant. Huge variety of good food. Sorta like Cheesecake factory. Good service. Reasonable prices. OK cocktails.
