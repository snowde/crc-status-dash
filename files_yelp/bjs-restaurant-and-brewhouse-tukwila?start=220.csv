Lorrainia C.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,11/10/2016,"If I could give negative stars I would. We used to love this place but in the last couple of months it has gone way down in every aspect. We just visited this last weekend with some friends and the only positive thing I can say about our visit was the host station. They were very friendly and seated us within 15 minutes. That was where the service stopped! We were seated at a broken table, we didn't even see our waiter for at least 20 minutes. There were other tables around that we could have been moved to but were basically told too bad. Our drinks didn't come for another 20 minutes and it wasn't even our complete order, the last of our drinks came well after our meals. We had to ask 5 times to get water, which also came after our meals. Our appetizers came after salads and before drinks. The appetizers were cold so clearly had been ready for a while. Of course during all this time waiting, we never saw our waiter. He didn't deliver anything to our table nor did he check up on us. Our entrees also arrived cold. About 2 minutes after we received our entrees, our waiter arrives finally only to give us our check. We had only just begun to eat them, clearly not finished with them. This is our the second bad experience in as many trips to BJ's. We will take our business across the way to Moctezuma's from now on where the food is always good, hot and the service is spot on.  I tried reaching out to the management of BJ's the next day, it's been 5 days and I have yet to get a response. After my recent experience, I am not surprised! BJ's you just lost regular customers. Perhaps this place needs to consider new management, clearly the current staff is not performing well."
Megan S.,"Seattle, WA",66,4,,1.0,10/18/2015,"This was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  We came here because nothing else was open at 10 at the mall. We ordered drinks 2 mimosas and 1 Bloody Mary. They were ok, the mimosas didn't have much champagne so that was lame. We ordered as soon as we sat down, and it took an hour to get our food. Once the food came out it was cold and we had to send everything back. They offered to remake everything, so we sat and waited and that was talk so long we told them to forget about it and we paid for our drinks and left."
Yo M.,"Lynnwood, WA",183,27,,1.0,11/19/2016,"The only thing I like about the place,they have college football on...beside that,I'm very disappointed with the food.i order bj rivers medium rare and they overcooked it.they forgot my asparagus.i rather eat at Dennys than here."
Rebecca W.,"Edmonds, WA",54,64,92,4.0,1/27/2014,"Update  Dinner was tasty and the white chocolate macadamia cookie was delicious. They forgot our appetizer and the waitress was very professional about it, she gave us a free appetizer. It's not bad for a night out for dinner, however we did go late at night so it wasn't super packed so can't speak for the busy times. Staff was always nice and attentive. We tried their new item the fried chicken strips the meat was really juicy and my type of fried chicken. Meaning it wasn't so fried that u felt my arteries constrict with fat. The corn was a nice complement to it. But wasn't too impressed with their mash potatoes. The pasta was good too, got the grilled chicken cream pasta. Wasn't too impressed with it but it's price and taste and portion is very reasonable. Lastly their flat bread. We always try to try a different flat bread we come and at different restaurants, we are a huge fan of flat bread however this time we weren't too impressed with their blue cheese steak flatbread, their flat bread is good but the California flat bread they offer is better than the steak one in my opinion. That is because the blue cheese overpowers everything. If you love blue cheese then this is the flat bread for you. I like blue cheese but definitely don't love it."
Alexis M.,"Kent, WA",10,44,58,3.0,3/2/2014,I really love the food here! A lot of things are great! I love the chicken Parmesan an dyne balsamic chicken. My favorite thing is the pazooki! That dessert is my best friend. I could have one everyday.  But the thing I do not care for is the seating. They added in extra seating which makes for more customers but I hate when I can hear someone else's conversation. Seating right next to people is not something I want to do.
Paul S.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,5,10,3.0,8/6/2016,Stay away from the LATE NIGHT BURGER. Imagine a cheeseburger topped with green salsa verde. Exactly.
Chantal B.,"Graham, WA",62,1,,4.0,10/9/2016,"A couple issues with my order, but fixed quickly and easily with no hassle. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken is the most delicious thing I've ever ordered at any restaurant! Staff was very friendly and helpful."
Sandra L.,"Auburn, WA",73,3,,1.0,10/12/2015,"Just had dinner there and would never go back. Worst wait staff I have seen in a long time. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated as second class citizens.mthenstaff were more interested in socializing with each other than seeing to needs of customers. Had to ask for more water and then they only served one of us. We ordered a bottle of wine and it was just dropped at our table, not poured out at all. Ordered salad and pizza to share....not asked if we wanted them separate or together....it all came at once...with no serving utensils. Food was mediocre at best with a means that tries too hard."
Linnea T.,"Seattle, WA",87,482,343,3.0,11/9/2014,"My last visit was worthy of only 2 stars, but I'm giving 3 overall as I have always loved BJ's, long before it came to South center, but this location has started having some issues with service quality and keeping enough staff. The signature dishes have also changed; they don't taste horrible but they look a little sad in presentation. This location was great when it first opened, so I'm hoping they've just been in a rut for the past few months. The food is still worth a visit and good for game viewing, just don't go when you're in a rush."
Sally T.,"Kent, WA",6,30,13,2.0,9/18/2014,"This place is always a hit or miss. Just yesterday my boyfriend and I were on a late night date due to our work schedules. Since it was a Tuesday night, the place was not that busy. When we walked in, nobody was there to seat us and their phone was ringing. We waited nearly 10 minutes. And still nobody came to the front to seat us. We had to walk up to an employee and asked to be seated. Really? (Remember it's a Tuesday night and there was only 8 tables occupied from what I remembered). Not only did we have to asked be seated, the waiter then brings us around a corner and seated us literally next to a really rowdy group. I looked around and the whole row behind me was empty. I really didn't understand why she couldn't seat us a few tables back where my boyfriend and I can actually have a conversation. The group was so loud, and disturbing (making racist comments and being immature). It made me uncomfortable and was hoping our waitress will come along soon so we can asked to be moved to a more private seat.  But she took a very long time and I lost my appetite by then, and asked for the check after our drinks. She had asked what was wrong and I told her that the rowdy group's conversation was really disturbing and made both of us uncomfortable. She apologized but then said my bad experience could've been avoidable if I would have asked to be seated somewhere else. I almost looked stupefied. Thanks captain obvious because I totally wasn't waiting for you but because you took so long I didn't have the chance to ask you to move us elsewhere."
Richard T.,"Bellevue, WA",151,416,15,4.0,5/20/2013,"First time for me trying the BJ's restaurant chain and I have to say it was a good experience. First of all the decor is nice and has a good modern feel to the whole establishment with the proper lighting. Second the food is really nice and tasty, My gf and I decided to share two appetizers for our meal since we weren't too hungry and it was an adequate amount for the both of us. We ordered the California Club flat bread pizza and also got their traditional chicken wings. The flat bread was some of the best I have ever had and it had many toppings. The wings was great with a spicy hot sauce for dipping which I enjoyed. The both of us also ordered their hand crafted sodas which were way better than your traditional sodas. Service could have been better as our waitress was busy with quite a few other tables and we had to wait awhile to place our food orders. Otherwise service was decent for the rest of our meal with them refilling our waters and checking up on us.  One other weird fact was that we were told that they had run out of burgers for the night since a couple people in our group had ordered them. What kind of restaurant chain runs out of burgers?? LOL.  Overall I wouldn't mind coming here again and trying some of their other menu items as they serve nice sized portions for their meals and is comparable in price to the Cheesecake Factory across the street."
Jarett B.,"Tacoma, WA",64,27,6,3.0,12/27/2015,Good service.  The main entrees are pretty good too. But short cuts on appetizers and condiments. Ranch dressing was thoroughly watered down and the wedge salad is mostly the core of the lettuce.  They must be using the green parts for the burger and the Leftovers for the salads.
Chris C.,"Seattle, WA",15,90,,1.0,1/13/2015,"My brain immediately starts to boil when I go to restaurant and they say ""it'll be 15 or 20 minutes"" yet I can see a fleet of empty tables inside, which is what happened on New Year's Day here. But ok, maybe they're short-handed.  And clearly the nice hostess had the day off, since we got the snarky, kind of rude hostess. After about half an hour or so they seated us. Did they seat us at one of the empty tables? No, they took us to their porch, which was like 700 degrees and tried to put us literally next to a woman with a baby.  I don't mind babies, everyone was a baby, but I do mind being asked to sit *literally* on top of the baby's diaper bag. I was like ""uh, can we sit there?"" which was like 3 feet away and the lady rewarded me with a massive sigh. So we're sitting in this super noisy porch, which is 700 degrees and my fat bald head is under a heat lamp, so I'm like ""can we sit inside?"" And she's like ""you'll have to wait longer"" and I'm like ""what about those empty tables I am looking at with my rapidly-getting-less-satisfied eyes?"" And she walks away without saying anything. Literally.  So already, what the fuck. So I'm sitting there all mad, and my wife is getting mad because I'm mad (when I get mad, she gets mad at me, because she has a higher threshold for being treated like shit by a b-grade chain restaurant hostess) and my son is like ""I'm taking notes for therapy later"" -- he didn't say that, he just was instagramming really intently, but I could tell from his body language. I'm looking at the long and uninspired menu and finally, fifteen minutes later, just as the waitress approaches I'm like ""fuck this let's go"" So we get up. The waitress was like ""whoa, what's wrong"" which was pretty cool, and I was like ""this seating arrangement is not working,"" and she's like ""if you want to wait longer you can sit inside"" and I""m like ""what about those actual empty tables I am looking at right now with my never-going-to-enter-this-fucked-up-establishment-again eyes?""  And again, I don't even know how this is possible, but it's a pretty good trick, she refuses to acknowledge that there are 10+ empty tables mere feet away from us, So we left and went to Joey's next door, which I thought was going to be crazy expensive but actually was probably only 20% more.  My advice: This place is great if you feel really guilty for something you did and want to be treated like shit. Otherwise, go anywhere else."
Shangrila P.,"Kent, WA",44,18,,1.0,10/1/2014,"The 1-star is based on the poor service.  If it was for the quality of food, I'd give it 4 stars.  The timelines mentioned below are not exaggerated at all.     My friend and I sat in the bar area at 9pm thinking it was happy hour but we were an hour too early. We ended up ordering from the regular menu but it took about 15 mins until our waiter came to take our order. We finally got our food at 10pm and both of our entrées were lukewarm to cold. The waiter didn't bring out one of my side dishes so I had to ask but it also came cold so he had it remade. Granted, he did offer to make us fresh entrées as well, but we already waited 45 minutes for our food so we ate what we had. (And we HATE eating cold food, especially when we are paying almost $20 each for it.)   I ordered the parm chicken which had good flavor but it was cold and felt like I was eating leftovers.  My friend ordered a well done steak which was SUPER dry and hard.  It looked like the lung of a someone that's been smoking cigarettes for 80 years.  (I know you're going to think it's because she ordered it well-done, but we know how a properly cooked steak should be and this wasn't it.)  She even specifically told the waiter she didn't want it burned on the outside and have it be like cardboard.  She just wanted no pink in the middle. (She didn't request this in a snobby, picky-eater way.  She very politely explained what she meant.) The waiter sent the manager over and he apologized for forgetting the side dish and later had the waiter offer us a free dessert after our meal. We surprisingly declined because it was almost 11pm.  We would've preferred even a partial credit to our check or a gift card with a note, ""I'm sorry we suck at service like we usually do but come back again and experience our sucky service with hot food the next time around.)  ...but that didn't happen. The bar was only half full and the main dining room only had about 8 people by the time our food came. Employees were standing around chatting and we could hear loud talking and laughing from the kitchen. It made us feel like they weren't giving their customers enough attention.   I do like BJ's food but the service has never really been great. (Our waiter wasn't rude, just not up to par.)  Their service would honestly hold me back from eating here more often.  The wait staff doesn't really check on you and they are slow at fulfilling requests.  (He offered to give me a box for my food and it took him 15 mins to come back with it.)  We left very disappointed, which is unfortunate since me and my friend don't get together that often.  We should have went to Cheesecake Factory or Bahama Breeze."
Maria C.,"Kent, WA",1,23,22,1.0,9/22/2015,"We came here for dinner  on sunday,  we were a party of 5 it was very slow not bussy at all like other sundays and the server was the worst  the couple of times that he came to the table we didnt see a smile on his face . Whats wrong with this people looks like they never did customer service before they dont ever know the meaning of it .  So no matter if bussy or slow service is still sucks . We had to ask for water even the table nex to us had emty cups .we were not even done eating yeat , when he bring the check without knowing or asking if we wanted  dessserts. Food is good but by the time it comes to your table its kind of cold already."
Melissa T.,"Fremont, CA",285,689,138,2.0,4/7/2013,"Being freshly single and new to the area, I accepted a date even though he suggested it take place at a mall. I do not like malls. I dislike dates at malls even more. I am not 15, but whatever. I played ball. When he suggested we meet at BJ's my thoughts of cheapness and malls and not being 15 melded together into a giant ""meh"" as I rolled up. But I will rate the experience of the restaurant as best I can rather than the date. So yeah. BJ's Tukwila, here we go. Our server was pretty ticked off that we did not want to order a super-sized portion of everything carb-smothered from our 95 page menu the second we sat down. And so began his hissy fit stomp-off as he circled round us every 10 minutes for the rest of our visit. It was super fun like that. He actually slammed the door to the kitchen (I saw, because we were seated near the bar).  Once we finally placed our food order, he was visibly displeased and my date felt guilty and ordered an extra drink to compensate which seemed silly but whatever. It's BJ's. I'm sorry if you aren't making enough in tips. Mall restaurants tend not to pay that great; especially not when you're a jerk. So anyhow. You get the idea. The actual food and beverages consumed was on par with what you'd expect. Service needed an attitude check. I'm sure not every server there behaves like this, and it was just our unlucky night. I don't think I'd return."
Kim V.,"Placerville, CA",60,211,86,2.0,8/29/2015,"Definitely not a fan of this restaurant, or at least this location. The service was slow, the food was wrong and cooked very poorly. Half of our table got their drinks before the other half was given the chance to order. I ordered mahi tacos that were a total mess: soggy tortillas and filling was all over the plate. The 6 tortilla chips it came with were translucent with oil (gross). My coworker ordered pasta that was so overcooked that it fell apart when she tried to pick it up with her fork. Several people in our party had their food mixed up (some with food allergies that couldn't eat what was brought out). The worst thing, however, was that after we ordered food, we placed an additional order for someone who was coming later, and they brought out the food for the later person before they brought out the food for person who was sitting there waiting for theirs.... I don't see myself coming back. 2 stars only because the location was convenient and there was enough seating for our bigger group."
Marie T.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,12/13/2014,"Waited 10 minutes for a table, walked us by 10 open booths and stuck us in the garage bay. Floor and table are filthy. Asked for a different table and told this was our only option because we had a baby and stroller. Good news, after my sour looks they finally washed and cleared a table inside the restaurant (right by the bathroom, so not really). However,  we were warned that the service might be spotty because someone had to come out of their section to wait on us. So far so good, beer is okay and the company is great! Ordered the bison burger with lots of special instructions so we shall see. Only a couple of issues with my meal ( no dressing for the salad,  didn't hold the bbq sauce on the burger, etc.) But tastes good.  My dining companions report dry chicken pesto sandwich (hint: order extra pesto, cause it is yummers). The double deluxe falls apart pretty fast and isn't worth the effort (maybe the pizza would be a good option).  We hear the Redmond location is better so if we give them another shot, that will be the place. P.s.  The only bathroom stall that had toilet paper you couldn't reach unless you were Stretch Armstrong. Aye caramba!"
Katinka R.,"Lynnwood, WA",8,173,,3.0,2/4/2016,"We came for lunch before dropping my parents off at the airport. We arrived just as they were opening for the day and we were probably the first table seated. We ordered within 5 minutes of arriving, but the food took almost half and hour to arrive. It was good, prepared correctly and the portions were really big. But the wait time was a bit frustrating... especially before a flight. I felt we had to rush thru the meal. I took my food with me in a box, but my parents were going to the airport so lots of the food was left behind due to timing issues and not wanting to hoark down our meals. I will come back again, but probably would find another place to eat if time mattered."
Malisa C.,"Auburn, WA",5,31,2,2.0,11/12/2014,"I came here last night with 5 other people for dinner before our movie & it was quite busy. Knowing how busy it was going to be, we called in ahead of time for a reservation. When we got to the place, I guess they have our table away, which was alright because we didn't even have to wait that long. I'd say about 15 minutes. Anyways, we got seated at our table, ordered our drinks and figured out what we wanted to order. Then all of a sudden, an employee comes rushing to our table and asks us how we ended up at this table because apparently, this table and the one next to it was reserved for another party that would be there soon. They asked us if we could move to another table and we did. Not going to lie, it was a bit embarrassing. However, our waitress was really friendly. We just didn't see much of her that night since it was really busy. We got our food 20 minutes later but some of us got pasta and couldn't eat because we didn't have forks. So that was another 5 minutes. Food was fine - nothing mind blowing.  Also, to get the discount movie ticket for amc, you don't just give them your bjs receipt. Make sure you ask you waiter about this & they're supposed to give you a gold movie ticket. Unfortunately, we couldn't get them because I didn't know. But after our movie, we came back for free pizzookies & that was yummy.  The food is fine and the waiters are nice but things can get a little hectic when it's busy."
