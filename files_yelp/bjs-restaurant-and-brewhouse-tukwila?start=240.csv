Tod O.,"San Diego, CA",36,5,,3.0,9/11/2016,Took close to an hour to get mac & cheese for the children. At the same time never cleared a single plate entire time we were here.  Ordered Shirley temples for the children came back with just soda water not a good first impression. I took the manager aside and described our experience. He decided to comp the entire bill and give us a second chance at trying this restaurant
Stephanie J.,"Renton, WA",116,58,221,2.0,8/26/2015,"Came here last night for a birthday party. Would of gave this place another star if only my boyfriend's burger didn't take an hour to come out. The mac and cheese was really bland, the fried calamari was fried with old oil and it wasn't even crunchy. On a good note, the chicken lettuce wraps were bomb. The BJ brew house burger was just too greasy. Our waiter, Michael, looked like he was having a bad day at first but, he turned out to be pretty cool. He explained and apologized about the burger, and even took it off our bill! In the end, the service is great but the food is not how I remembered it to be."
Michelle R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,23,2,1.0,9/3/2016,"Went there today for lunch. Found immediate seating in the bar area. A nice lady waitress came over to gets our drinks and appetizer order. She brought drinks out right away, appetizer came out shortly after. When she delivered the appetizer I asked her if we could order. She said that she was not our server but she would send him over. So we have been sat for 20 minutes and haven't seen our server once. He finally comes over, doesn't introduce himself and says ""what would you like to have""? Food came quickly and was good. We had to ask another waitress to get us a box and the bill. Service was absolutely horrible and hopefully he will recognize that with the 10% tip we left."
Stephanie S.,"Sacramento, CA",211,201,772,1.0,10/4/2015,"I usually enjoy my experience at Bj's but this was the worst experience I've had. I'm visiting family from California and since the wait was too long at Cheesecake Factory we decided to go here instead. We definitely regret it. It took awhile for our waitress to come and get our order after getting our appetizers. I noticed that the couple near us also complained and the man looked angry. Once we put in our order it took about 45 minutes to get our food and my pasta came out with the wrong type of pasta. Our waitress came by and mentioned that the manager will come by and see us since we mentioned to her that our order took forever. 10 minutes pass and the manager (Michael) finally comes by. I told him that my order didn't have the pasta I requested or even the pasta that usually comes with the order and he says ""oh we don't have that pasta and the pasta you're eating now is how I usually like mine."" Uhmmm for one, I'm not you. Also, I didn't ask how you liked your pasta. It's how I like my pasta. I'm paying for it. How is he even a manger there. Very rude and didn't even offer to change out my dish. I will never go back to that Bj's anytime I'm in town and will let everyone I know to never go to that Bj's."
Maria B.,"Seattle, WA",158,329,34,3.0,12/23/2014,"Our server was SO friendly and helpful and they had great beer. Our pizza was cold when it came to our table and it took quite some time to get to us once we placed our order. Would be open to going here again, but won't be at the top of our list."
Sammy C.,"Garden Grove, CA",199,1,,1.0,9/30/2016,"The New Orleans Jambalaya just sucks. 3/10 Rating. Customer service sucks. The guy is watching the game while he's working, which is all good, but when I call him over, he says hold on for a second and goes on looking at the game.  When I finally get up to go out, he comes over. Doesnt even say sorry for the wait, and says what I would like. I said the Jambalaya and when the food came out, it was cold. Anyways, maybe a better experience with another waiter/waitress but this made my Friday a shitty ending."
Audrey N.,"Seattle, WA",127,138,321,2.0,4/11/2013,"You're prolly wondering why 2 stars... BJ's was never good to me :( literally the only thing I enjoy here is the root beer float and calamari. from time to time the pizookie can be my sweet tooth craving fix, their appetizers are better than the actual meals... other than that, their entrees are tasteless to me. Their scampi pasta was like plain pasta tossed in w some veggies, sprinkled some green things and topped it off w a couple shrimp and bread sticks... all of that, yet I still feel like I ate just plain pasta. Other time I came here, I had a pizza. It was the BJ's fave or something... it was first on the menu and I was disappointed. It was such a soft pizza like I'm eating straight up dough. The crust was the most disappointing part, because there was no crust. hahah.  It was rly just super plain and sad.  If I were you, I'd just order a bunch of appetizers. Their chips and salsa is always good and simple. Calamari is always good and the Santa Fe rolls are amazing. Service is slow. Everytime I go here, there's never anyone at the front to assist all these people that're swarming in."
Rona L.,"Federal Way, WA",227,663,2435,2.0,2/17/2011,"HORRIBLE SERVICE from the server in the bar.  She was rude and couldn't (or wouldn't) even remember simple things - like more water, etc.   The food was okay, but I wasn't particularly hungry that night either. I'm not in a rush to come back, but if I ever do...I'll sit in the restaurant."
Allison P.,"Seattle, WA",86,491,204,3.0,8/13/2013,"Pretty decent restaurant and brewery. The menu is huge!!!! Like super huge! They have everything you could want. I had the lunch specials. Half sandwich, salad and fries for under $10!  Nice outside covered patio.  Service was kind of slow but not bad.  Lots of options also for kids menu."
Greta S.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",44,26,40,5.0,7/31/2015,"Sonya was absolutely amazing! Kudos to her service and personable attentiveness. She has an awesome sense of humor, personality and ability to multi-task! We drove from Redmond because we don't like the service there. This visit was awesome!  We will be requesting Sonja next time for sure! Give the girl a raise or some star points or some other form or incentive for her above and beyond level or service!"
Marisa F.,"Kent, WA",0,5,,4.0,9/1/2016,"I ate here last night and the greeter was extremely rude. We walked in and he was talking to another hostess, completely ignoring us. I said ""hello"" thinking he might not have noticed we were there and he told my boyfriend and I to ""hold on"" so he could finish his conversation (which didn't seem very important) 5 minutes later after standing in the lobby waiting for him to finish his conversation, he finally sat us down after telling us the person he was talking to wasn't feeling well. I also work in customer service and your personal conversations are definitely not as important as your guest, it is extremely unprofessional. Our waitress (I think her name was Esther?) was Awesome. She was very sweet and did everything to the best of her ability. Their pizookies are awesome!"
FoodieLover M.,"Seattle, WA",119,59,59,2.0,9/19/2015,"Short wait with the phone call ahead of time to get on the waitlist. The food on the other hand, over seasoned and salty. This was for several dishes: Wings, balsamic chicken and other entrees."
Will M.,"Renton, WA",84,62,25,2.0,7/11/2015,"Odd that many of the more complimentary reviews also mention ordering alcohol? The burger was ok-not cooked to order. I was seated quickly but was largely forgotten until my food was nearly gone. I was never offered a refill on my drink or desert. I hate places that take high, mall foot traffic for granted and don't deliver. Not a repeat!"
Kee C.,"Federal Way, WA",94,10,1,1.0,7/8/2015,"Waited with my elderly mom with my wife and 2.5 year old daughter for a table.   Although the restaurant was about 50% empty, we walked all the way around the restaurant to what normally is outdoor seating. This all while the hostess turned around twice while my mother, with the assistance of her cane and my arm, struggled to keep up.  Really disappointed in that not only was there no empathy in regards to seating a disabled guest, the location of the table is EXTREMELY loud.   *SIGH*"
Dave S.,"Darby, PA",24,23,,2.0,9/13/2015,"I visited while in town for work and it was ""ok""  but wasn't a very satisfying experience. We walked in, no one was at front, then the hostess got there and seated us, then was one of those nobody knew we were in their section deals, then the beer my co-worker was out but they didn't know that when we ordered it, the replacement drink took a while, steak was ordered medium rare, was dry, had a side item that never arrived, and so on. We spent much of the meal advocating to get we ordered lol. They were very nice and the beer is good and we probably just caught them on a rough day but based on the experience I'd not go out of my way to return. I'd go back but not go out of my way."
Roxane M.,"Bellevue, WA",22,4,,1.0,8/24/2015,"We were at the mall yesterday sunday, and we decided to have dinner at Bj's at southcenter, we were a group of 8 with 5 adults and 3 kids, I kindly ask if there is any table for 5 adults and 3 kids, and the place look empty and no one was waiting in the lobby, she didn't even check the sitting area, she just bluntly said, We have 45 minutes wait for 8 people, were short staff and there is reservation for 10 people, REALLY 45 min wait for EMPTY RESTAURANT...!!! That's ridiculous we walked away and went to Duke's Chowder, which they sitted us within 5 minutes, the table had water and menus, very friendly too... We will never go to Bj's every... Horrible customer service... I dont recommend"
Peggy R.,"Lynnwood, WA",255,420,93,5.0,7/23/2014,"We came here for a family lunch for my aunt's birthday on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't too crowded, and the atmosphere was pleasant. We were a party of 5, and our table was a bit too small for us. They tried to move us, but all the larger tables were taken. We were flexible and said it was okay. They offered us a free dessert for our flexibility - that was totally cool because we didn't ask for anything and were totally willing to stay where we were. But, that's a great example of excellent customer service.  I ordered the French Dip with skinny fries and my son ordered shrimp tacos; also with skinny fries. In addition, my cousin ordered potato skins. My French Dip was amazing with caramelized onions and a horseradish spread on the side - the bread was super fresh and all the flavors melded together in a mouthgasming explosion. My son loved his tacos, and said they were enough to fill him up; which is an amazing thing as he's a 12 year old bottomless pit. I think BJ's is one of the best places to go in Southcenter, the prices are reasonable, the food is good and the service rocks!!"
Peaches A.,"Pasadena, CA",2,126,138,4.0,8/22/2015,"I've left reviews for BJ's restaurants at different locations before and this visit to this location was more of the same. I don't really go to my local BJ's near my home, because I like to save it for when I travel for work. I enjoy getting dinner from here while traveling because they have a decent menu and the ability to easily order online and pick it up. The parking at this location is a royal pain the ass with it being in a very large and busy shopping mall complex. The restaurant does have a separate entrance for take out pick up so it makes picking up your meal very fast and easy. This time around I got the Barbacoa chicken with a side caesar salad. The chicken was tasty and good but a rather small portion with two smaller pieces. The caesar was good, which I have had restaurants give very small portions and crappy side salads when they are to go. This side salad was a good portion size and rather good. The employee that helped me was welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed. I'm sure next time I'm Seattle for work."
Anthony S.,"Seattle, WA",379,451,221,3.0,6/20/2011,"I gave up on BJ's years ago due to the very bland pizza. But now their beer selection is much better, making up for the boring pizza. Beyond pizza, the menu is typical causal chain brewpub fair.  Big menu.  Big portions.  Yada yada yada."
Tim M.,"Seattle, WA",183,186,13,4.0,9/28/2014,"My first time to BJ's today and I really loved the look of the place, it was clean, comfortable and modern.  I would give the wait staff 2-3 stars, but the food was good, prepared correctly and delivered quickly, and it was delicious.  The burger was juicy and I decided before I dug in to put my napkin on my shirt and sure enough, it was good that I did.  I was juicy and dripping everywhere (that's a GOOD thing).  I liked the sauce they seemed to talk up on the menu.  I have no major issues, but the waitress was not very friendly to me, but was to my friend.  She re-filled his iced-tea without asking, but I had to ask for her to....  They could have had a 5-star review from me, except for her."
