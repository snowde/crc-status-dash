Leigh P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",44,239,106,2.0,7/8/2014,I was very disappointed in my experience here. The service was lacking and the food was terrible. I showed up right when they opened for lunch and the waiter was confused from the get go.  I ordered their lighter fare chicken lunch and it was so doused in vinegar that I couldn't taste any other flavors.  I will not be returning to this restaurant.
Dennis G.,"Cumming, GA",14,12,,5.0,8/3/2015,"Great bartender (Brandon), fast service and BJ's food is consistently fantastic.  Had the new Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken and was thoroughly impressed with the flavor combination.  Of course you have to order the BLT salad as that is a staple there."
Keith H.,"Seattle, WA",0,19,,1.0,1/8/2017,"What's the food like?  I wouldn't know.  What's the service like - the worst in the business!  Arrived at noon today, we were one of 3 tables of people... the server had to take our drink order (coffee, coke, water) twice to still get it wrong.  Ordered our food and 30 minutes later asked for refills - nope never got those.  Requested again... nope still nothing.  Can you bring over our server?  Nope.  Manager?  Nope.  Hey it's been 55 minutes and we still have no food... oh you'll fetch my server, great.  Ok over an hour... I'm done, thanks for absolutely nothing not even a refill... and am I met with an apology?  No, the server runs over and says I need to be patient it'll just be a few more minutes... sorry lady, after an hour if you can't manage a couple burgers I will just skip lunch, my movie is starting.  Sad, pathetic, and where exactly was that manager we requested 15 minutes before giving up?  Apparently brewing coffee that WE NEVER GOT.  Take your business elsewhere!"
Carol H.,"Auburn, WA",1322,220,1604,3.0,9/20/2014,"We enjoyed dining outside last night but was surprised they didn't ask before they seated us.  It was somewhat loud and there were a few annoying bugs.  I'm glad they have new ""Enlightened Entrees"" since the last time we were here.  We didn't have to wait long for our food and it was tasty.  There's a pretty good beer selection, too bad happy hour deals are only in the bar.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  BJ's isn't close by for us but it's an option we consider when we are in Tukwila."
Brian A.,"Rock Hill, SC",68,462,48,4.0,8/25/2012,"When my burger arrived, I looked around to see if everybody was as shocked as I was.  I wasn't sure if this was some sort of contest I had gotten myself into.  The burger wasn't only huge, but it looked like the burger they serve people on commercials. The burger had jalapenos and bacon on it...and boy was it juicy and delicious.  The crispy fries were a nice addition. BJ's has a nicer sports bar feel to it.  There are multiple televisions with various sports on them.  A ginormous screen centered behind the bar seems to be tuned to the most relevant game at the time.  The clientele seems to be a mesh of locals and out-of-towners, and the service from behind the bar couldn't have been better. I had a great meal and met a couple friendly people.  Now if I can only figure out why the guy a couple stools over from me kept yelling ""Bazinga"" every 10 minutes, I'd be set. Try:  The house made Red Ale Avoid:  Thinking about your arteries"
J L.,"Downtown, Honolulu, HI",0,18,,4.0,7/9/2016,"Came here on the recommendation of a friend.  We tried the Asian Chopped Salad and the new deep dish California Supreme.  They were both excellent!!  The salad was very hearty with chicken, snap peas, red bell pepper and a nice vinaigrette.  The pizza was awesome!! Cheesy, with spinach, and generous pepperoni slices with a soft, yet crispy crust...  To die for!  Winnas!!  Must come again!  Too bad they're not in Hawaii!"
Carl P.,"Seattle, WA",15,1,1,4.0,12/31/2014,"Right as I entered the restaurant I was greeted by a very kind greeter and was seated immediately. my waiter and server were top notch and we're at the top of their game with refills of my Strawberry Lemonade (my favorite drink of theirs). I chose to have their Grilled Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo which came with two sticks of garlic bread which was toasted perfectly! The actual pasta itself tasted absolutely amazing! However, there were multiple instances in which I had pretty uncooked noodles in my pasta which wasn't the greatest, but that is hard to avoid, I do it all the time when I make pasta at home! For Desert I had their Baked Beignet which I had for my first time! I honestly have to say that it was by far one of the best Desserts I have ever eaten! Overall very satisfying visit, and it didn't break the bank either which is always a plus."
Danny -.,"Renton, WA",0,13,,2.0,3/15/2016,"I go to BJs fairly often and love their food, but this location is slowly turning me off the brand. The BJs chain has awesome food, and this location is no different, but my last 3 times at this location, the service has been brutal, and the food has become seemingly more and more disappointing.  I'm only going to mention my most recent visit, as it left me with a bad taste after years of loving this place. I went with my friend and we met at that restaurant fairly late at night. When we arrived, I'd say there were maybe 9 tables with about 20 patrons total so by no means was it busy. We walk in and there is no one at the host station. We contemplate sitting in the bar area to seat ourselves, but neither of us are fans of the bar areas at restaurants. So we wait what felt like an eternity, but was really about 7 minutes before a girl finally notices that we exist. She walks up to us, doesn't say anything, and just kind of glares at us expecting us to say something. A fairly sour greeting I should say. We ask for a table and her reply is ""ok, let me find you one."" She walks away to the basically empty restaurant, comes back after 2 minutes and says ""follow me."" Finally, we are seated. So we sit there looking over the menus, and I see a couple servers walking by us multiple times. We wait... And wait... And about another 10 minutes go by and finally a server who walked by us multiple times and definitely saw us there comes up for our drink order. We tell him we are ready to order (as we are already tired of waiting around) and he says ok hold on. He walks away, comes back after a few minutes (no drinks in hand) and takes our orders. After taking our order, he comes back with drinks finally a couple minutes later.  So as if it wasn't bad enough, it only gets worse from here. We noticed a table near us with two people who looked bored out of their minds. They hadn't eaten yet clearly, and at one point our server walked by and they stopped him and asked how much longer it would be for the food as they have been waiting over 30 minutes. Upon hearing that conversation I realized we really probably just should have walked away when no host came up at the start.  So more than 40 minutes goes by and no food. Finally our server runs over, drops off our food, and starts walking away without saying a word. We needed refills and had no silverware or napkins so I have to uncomfortably loudly yell for him to come back. He quickly brings us napkins, however he seemed to clearly forget the refills as we never saw him again until after we finished our food. Speaking of the food, as always, it was delicious, which is why my review is a 2 star instead of 1 star, HOWEVER, the portions of food are significantly smaller than in the past, which is another thing that's disappointing. Usually I'm so full I can't decide if I can stomach a Pizookie after. This time, I was still starving after finishing my food, but so sick of waiting and this awful service that I just decided to pay my bill and leave and grab a milkshake at McDonald's for dessert.  Anyway, there's my review. I genuinely hope BJs management goes on Yelp and reads reviews and can use this to better train their staff and better serve their customers."
Liz C.,"Seattle, WA",42,33,,2.0,7/21/2016,"The last time I went here the service was terrible. My friend and I were seated and it  started okay. The food was okay, some of it cold and it didn't have very much flavor. But what bothered me the most was the service. Our waiter never came back to the table, though I could see him texting off to the side. They didn't give me silverware, flagging down someone was impossible even though it wasn't very crowded."
Melissa S.,"Seattle, WA",25,133,58,2.0,3/8/2014,"Disappointmentville.   Our group of three ordered two turkey burgers and a turkey-bacon sandwich.  After 20 minutes we see a nearby table that ordered after us get their food.  After 15 more minutes the manager came out to explain that a different server accidentally took one of the burgers and that they had to remake it.  Our food would be another 10 minutes.   My turkey burger was definitely not worth waiting 45 minutes for.  The burgers had sad, limpy lettuce and tomato.  Mine had a hair in it.  The turkey patty was mealy and cold. Ick. The shoestring fries were edible and the wedge fries were similar to what you'd fine in the Safeway deli.  The turkey sandwich was nothing to write home about.   The manager was apologetic but did not offer to comp a meal or give us a free dessert.  I really expected a scoop of ice cream or SOMETHING, but I don't think this restaurant cares about return business or customer satisfaction.   When our server brought the bill she suggested we sign up for the loyalty program.  Yeah right!"
Olystacy B.,"Olympia, WA",90,725,369,3.0,6/17/2014,"6 of us stopped by for an late/lunch early dinner around 3 pm last Saturday.  The restaurant was half full but there were several of us in line waiting to be seated. It took 20 minutes to be seated, which was a little off putting. We couldnt figure out why they wouldnt have scheduled more staff on a Saturday and a Saturday with many watching the World Cup.  The bar was full of soccer fans.  Seems like whoever was responsible for scheduling/staffing was behind the 8 ball. Anyway, service was very slow and disjointed.  We had to wait to get our water, our drinks, and acknowledgement of us even sitting at the table took about 10 minutes. Food was excellent and our server was friendly albeit disorganized.  We had to repeat our order to him 3 times because he wasn't writing it down. WHY do servers do this? Why not just write it down and get it right the first time?  It doesnt impress me that you have a 50/50 memory - impress me by getting right the first time and not having to ask me numerous times to confirm you have a short memory? Food took a long time to come out and then came out in different increments which is always annoying.  One of the kids had to wait about 10  minutes after  everyone else had received their food. Side salads were very small for the price. Deep dish pizza was outstanding with great flavor and crispy buttery crust., pretty steep prices though. All told we were there for an hour and forty five minutes for what should have been a quick bite to eat on a Saturday afternoon between typical busy times.  The manager (I assume - don't know) came by and apologized for the very long wait but didn't comp anything off the bill. I am undecided - I don't know if we would go back.  It was good but I dont know if it was good enough to go  back, pay steep prices for not so great service."
Christine K.,"Ewa Beach, HI",91,264,179,3.0,8/9/2014,Standard bar food. Nothing to rave about but not bad either. I could eat it if it was someone else's first choice for a meal.
Julie S.,"Lacey, WA",0,6,1,1.0,12/6/2015,"The only star I'm giving for this review is for food. The food was awesome, as it always is at BJ's locations. However, the good ends there. I've NEVER had worse service at a restaurant in my entire life.  After being seated for 15 minutes with no service, we approached the hostess asking for a server to please take our drink order. Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received our drinks. Then, another 10 minutes went by before the server finally came over to take our food orders. That's 40 MINUTES before our food orders were taken!!  I decided to ask for the manager and politely explain the situation, and she seemed pretty annoyed and not apologetic. When we received our check at the end of the meal, we discovered we were charged for an EXTRA entree we didn't even order. When we questioned the extra charge, the manager acted further annoyed with us. I've never had such shockingly terrible service at a business. And hopefully I never will again."
Kiley G.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,38,3,1.0,9/7/2014,"I wish I could give negative stars for the Sunday morning management. Our server Brandy was great, but the manager and Chris literally hid around the kitchen wall when I was trying to talk to them. I saw a table full of people leave when he took their football game off the tv(they were the first people in the restaurant). He also took my game completely off all the Tvs.  Put post-it's on the Tvs and people will sit where their games are!! Take a ""Sunday Ticket"" class. Needless to say this place blows."
Kathy L.,"Green Valley, AZ",8,28,4,4.0,7/2/2016,"First off our server,Jeffrey, was funny and very helpful. Great job! My caprese salad was so delicious!  My husband had a bread soup bowl and caesar that he said was very good."
Marie M.,"Renton, WA",0,54,2,2.0,8/11/2014,"Our server was very awkward, making us uncomfortable. Not knowing the menu gives a safe assumption that you're new, which is completely fine. What wasn't fine was that NO ONE was helping her. There was another server that walked by plenty of times, I tried to grab his attention and be wouldn't even look at our table. That's rude to not only us, but your coworker. My boyfriend got the wrong plate, same meal but with a different side. Instead of bringinh out the side a lady informed us that he got someone else's food, his plate was in the window so, ""I'll let you eat that green bean but I have to take the plate back"" did you replate the meat and give it to the other person? The food was good but from someone who works in a restaurant, the lack of teamwork and communication was embarrassing."
KLouise B.,"Edgewood, WA",0,5,,1.0,6/26/2016,"Will never go there again. The hostess was rude and snappy. We weren't the right color. We were sat at 4:30 and didn't get our dinners until 6pm, served one at a time , not together.The server never came back to our table  to check on us unless we signaled for him. A party of 30 was sat after us and got their food well before us. Horrible. Don't  waste your time. Less than one star."
Clint W.,"Seattle, WA",310,862,9,3.0,1/14/2012,"This wasn't what I expected at all.   It was wide open, with an upscale sports bar feel to it.   We plopped down for a couple of drinks and app's during HH.   Service was prompt, the drinks a little on the weak side, and so so food.  The spring rolls were really tasty but the chips and salsa were meh.   I still haven't tried a pizookie, which is what everyone raves about.   I guess eventually I'll get there."
Woodrow K.,"Jacksonville, FL",12,16,1,2.0,11/25/2015,"Good food, good drinks, sitting at bar for 5 min now waiting for acknowledgment from barkeep. I'm one of 3 people sitting at the bar. Seriously!"
Lowann H.,"Seattle, WA",29,46,90,4.0,4/13/2014,Good late dinner with the Jeremiah Red beer. Along with beef sliders and California club flatbread. The service is fast and the menu leaves you plenty of choice for all types of craving.
