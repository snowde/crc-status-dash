Nija C.,"Spring, TX",36,25,52,2.0,1/8/2015,"After waiting only five minutes, I was hopeful for my food experience at the Bjs at Southcenter. We sat down to a wonderful waitress, who greeted us with a grin, and eagerly got us out strawberry lemonades to start. Unfortunately, that was the only good part of our meal. Once our two brew house burgers came to our table THIRTY MINUTES later we were greeted not by a steaming plate, but instead limp fries and a PINK burger (our waitress omitted to ask us how we like our burgers cooked). The burger tasted like old grease and the lettuce was a little old. Super sad I couldn't give a glowing review, but for the price of $10 per ""gourmet"" burger, I'd say just slide over to dukes chowder house and have a great cup of chowder that'll be sure to put a grin on your face"
Tan Lo S.,"Seattle, WA",127,475,904,3.0,4/12/2012,"Every time I come here, it's not the BEST food, but it's not horrible either. I can't believe I have never reviewed this place. But BJ's is known for their brew, so that's why a lot of the time that I do come here, one of the guys always wants beer. This place is big, but not huge. sometimes, the tables are close together where people often stare at you, and/or it's SUPER LOUD. But our server was great. I love having good jokes with the waiter and he was just that... he was funny & played along with our jokes. He was actually good. He told jokes, checked in often, and was friendly. Didn't go out of his way for things, but honestly he was a damn good waiter.  I can't remember which drink I got. It was some kind of Sangria that was supposed to be made by one of the BJ's workers. But it was SO weak. It's supposed to be one of the ""stronger"" drinks but it was whack! I tasted some wine, but that was it. NOT strong at all. It was more fruity than anything. I wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered their wonton and mini bruschetta. I actually really enjoyed their wontons & bread. It was small, worth the cheap prices and tasty. I also tasted the stuffed mushrooms which were sooo goood! I enjoyed that. I've had their tomato and cheese salad, I think. And that was good too. Normally, I always get the chicken fried steak here. I think it's good, but not the best. At times, dry & bland, but the gravy makes it taste all better.  I rate this place 3/5 stars because of the food, overall. I mean, they have good brew but other drinks suck. And their small bites were good.  I'll keep coming back... or not. Haha"
Lexadyna N.,"Federal Way, WA",3,3,3,1.0,4/28/2015,"I came in late last night, 40 minutes before closing time so I could understand why workers may be irritable but I was just craving a small pizookie that I could easily finish in 10 minutes so I thought whatever why not. We walk in and wait by the hostess station for 10 minutes until our *HORRIBLE* server KELVIN ""greets"" us. From beginning to end he was rude. I get that you guys were closing soon but if someone had greeted us sooner, taken our orders sooner, then OBVIOUSLY we would've been done, SOONER. I only planned to be there for 15 minutes and they still had two other groups of people seated and eating!  Like cmon, I'm a server, I get it. But in my opinion you have no room to bitch and moan when you get off at midnight and I get off at 4 am and still try to give my customers great service.  Like maybe you should find another job if you don't know how to deal with customers :) that's all I'm saying."
Shekinah S.,"Saint Paul, MN",212,789,283,3.0,11/6/2011,"We ventured to Southcenter Mall for the first time in years to meet my boyfriend's family for lunch.  Holy crap this place has changed!  Practically unrecognizable, so many new stores, structures and restaurants.    First impression: there's an awful lot of kids in this brewhouse.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon.  Our server was friendly and attentive, though one other girl kept bringing us food for another table and there was one mixup with our order.  The menu is huge, reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory, though upon closer inspection much of the menu is devoted to drinks.  In addition to beer, BJs also makes their own cream soda, orange (cream?) soda, and rootbeer.  I tried my BF's rootbeer and it was quite tasty.  His cousin loved the cream soda as well. We started out with the avocado rolls as an appetizer.  They were a hit but I didn't try them because they were ruined by the inclusion of cream cheese.  Our table's orders included pasta, a burger, sandwiches, and a salad.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and either finished it or took home leftovers.  My Toscano pasta was just OK.  The mix of ingredients sounded promising (tomatoes, feta, red onions, parmesan) but it was rather bland and the pasta was overcooked.  The chicken was good though with a nice amount of char.  My BF's Cajun pasta with shrimp was much more flavorful.  I tried both the shoestring and wedge fries and they were both really good.   I doubt I'll ever be back to BJs but wouldn't rule it out if I had to eat at the mall again. I didn't have very high expectations for mall/chain food and it delivered about what I expected but with slightly better service. And I'll finish by stating the obvious: terrible name."
Shea S.,"Seattle, WA",1,8,,1.0,9/7/2014,DO NOT GO HERE TO WATCH FOOTBALL!  The manager here does a very poor job managing the TVs on gameday and changed channels multiple times throughout the day (when we left 3 TVs were showing a CFL game). We had to move multiple times and many customers left due to frustration with the complete lack of organization.  On top of that the service was slow and the food was bad. The boneless chicken wings were worse than the frozen packs you buy at the grocery store.  Definitely not going back here.
Joel D.,"Seattle, WA",144,106,23,3.0,5/16/2015,Decent prices and selection- the staff was very kind and courteous and accommodating
Mark G.,"Seattle, WA",181,100,204,2.0,12/3/2014,I've been here a few times for work lunches.  This place is good for seating a large amount of people but that is about it.  The service is not very good and the food is very mediocre.  I've had the pizza here (not very good) as well as the chicken tacos lunch special (not enough food).
Ellissa M.,"Federal Way, WA",18,9,4,2.0,2/12/2015,"Came here with my boyfriend after we both got off work to grab a late lunch. It was about 3:30 and pretty slow. We got drinks in a decent amount of time then ordered our steaks. Finished our first round of drinks, started on our second, food still not out. So we're both sitting there real curious what happened to our medium rare and medium steaks since at this point it's been 25 minutes when we ask what's up with our food, new bartender says she'll have our bartender go check on it since she just came on.  Our bartender said they were platting our food up now. A few minutes our steaks came out.  My fork had some dried food that survived the dishwasher on it, I stated such, was offered no new silverware, cut into steak, it was fine. Taste wise, Eehhhh but we were starving as we both had just got off work. So we are our food. Bartender let us know she was getting off and would be closing out with us. Sure, we will close out.  Here's my issue. I work in the service industry, was wearing my work clothes when I came in. When you let my drink be empty for 5 minutes before you ask if we want another, no no. My food taking 35 minutes, especially since it was a medium and a medium rare steak, uhm... No again. No apologies were offered at all or any explanation, which would have made it acceptable. On top of that, letting me know you're closing me out, nope. Should've asked me and given me the option, which I would've closed out anyway like we were told to do, letting me know that's what you're doing, not okay.  I haven't been into BJ's for about a month before this, service was always on point before. Not sure what was going on today, maybe my appearance was not the usual dressy black clothes, just jeans and a work t-shirt and my boyfriend in construction clothes, but the service should have been the same.  I'm honestly kind of like damn, that sucks. Usually it's much better. As I told my boyfriend, who wondered why I chose this place verses all our other choices, since he had never been. Maybe just an off day. Let's hope so."
Stefanie F.,"Redmond, WA",176,130,68,1.0,10/21/2013,"I don't understand why people were so excited about this chain coming to Seattle.  The dessert they are famous for is at best  ""average"", The service at this location and the newst one in Redmond, WA is TERRIBLE. I would never go back. The management is also incapable of resolving issues.  FIRST after waiting 30 min for table, our waiter forgot one of our guests meals, then when it finally came out it was completely wrong order. Then when they tried to fix it a second time it was still incorrect. So we complained to the manager who offered us a free dessert to apologize but we ended up waiting another hour only to find out the waiter never put that order either. The total amount of time spent here was almost 3 hours to not even get a meal. The manager never offered to comp the meal or follow through to make sure we were taken care of. The atmosphere is typical commercialized. Very loud and crowded."
Anna P.,"Auburn, WA",1,18,31,5.0,8/11/2015,I've been going to BJs for a long time and I always come there for their chicken wings. I don't think I've had anything better! I love how it's crispy and they drizzle the buffalo sauce right over it. I found out that they updated their chicken wings selection and I was thrilled to have the option of having half garlic Parmesan chicken wings and half classic. I loooooved it! I also ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta which was really good. Broccoli was cooked perfectly.
Nicholas R.,"Renton, WA",98,8,2,4.0,9/8/2014,"I love BJ's! My girlfriend and I come here all the time. It's good to take advantage of the rewards program, the redeemable points add up quickly! I have never been disappointed with any entree nor any appetizer. I love the avocado egg rolls, the stuffed mushrooms, the Tuscan chicken limone, and lots of other items. The hostesses and servers are usually pretty nice, but sometimes (rarely) it feels like they just want to go home, which is understandable considering how busy this place can be. The only other negative I can think of is the fact that if you want pineapple juice you get a really small cup filled to the brim with ice and no free refills. I love this restaurant!"
Alanna M.,"Seattle, WA",2250,649,1953,1.0,7/4/2013,"This place makes McDonald's feel like fine dining.  The food is terrible.  My son said he wished Chef Ramsay was there to fix the food -- even my 5 year old has standards. The meat on the burgers were dry and weren't even formed into a nice round patty.  More like a blob of gobble-y blob.  There was cheese the size of a booger.  The pasta was spicy but no other flavor.  Even the service blew like a bad BJ -- from getting a table, to getting our food took forever & it was 2 in the afternoon."
Rafael Z.,"Seattle, WA",257,237,46,3.0,3/21/2014,"Came here for the first time with my girlfriend because she raved on how good the burgers were. Got in at about 6pm and waited for 15-20 mins. Got seated and the waiter was training another waiter so i assumed the service was going to be by the book which it was. Our waters were filled every so often and kept getting asked if we needed anything and so forth. I ordered the Double Deluxe Burger and a house salad. The food was alright nothing very spectacular for my taste buds but the burger was overall good. The potatoe wedges were a nice option instead of your usual skinny fries which still are an option. The pricing is very similar to Applebees/Red Robin but the decor is much much nicer. I would come here again, hopefully the service stays consistent."
Rachel P.,"Renton, WA",91,730,18,3.0,5/28/2012,"Went for lunch today, it was a very ""ok"" experience.  Service hit a lag between ordering and getting food.  Salads came out right before other parts of lunch, which is annoying.  Prices were good and waiter did an OK job keeping water and iced tea filled.   I did notice that our waiter had tables spanning the whole restaurant (like opposite sides of the giant space) and that didn't make any sense... I likely won't be back, we only went for my grandma's birthday dinner and I rarely have a need for this type of ""generic American restaurant""."
Caroline L.,"Seattle, WA",269,67,113,2.0,1/5/2015,"Came here as a last resort because the restaurant we originally wanted to go to was closed. Boyfriend and I sat in the bar section cause we didn't want to wait 15 minutes to get seated. Waitress informed that it was happy hour cause there was a football game going on, which was nice even though their HH food menu is very limited. We order the chicken wings and a mini deep dish pizza off the HH. The wings were good but you only get like 5 pieces, which is not worth it. I got the chicken bacon ranch pizza which was good but kind of soggy cause ranch was drenched on top.. We also ordered the cajun pasta off the regular menu. It was okay. We had to use some tobasco to bring some spice into the dish. The pasta was cold too and the bread sticks it came with was ROCK hard. Disappointed so I asked for new breadsticks, which our waitress got us fresh ones right away.  I've been to this location many times, its a hit or miss, depending on what food you get. Also remember that it is hard to get the waiter's attention in the bar section."
Trisha F.,"Seattle, WA",263,397,801,3.0,8/20/2011,"After combing the mall for over an hour, a friend and I were downtrodden, hungry, and looking to get in some much needed gossip. Enter BJs. We were seated right away, despite it looking pretty crowded and being behind a few parties. They moved us to a booth on request, and the service was prompt and thoughtful, and best of all- speedy. Ordered two flatbread pizzas (margherita and pesto chicken) and two salads (caesar and house) along with long island iced teas. Granted, I am a lush; given, I drink a fair amount. These long islands were average priced (9.50 a piece) and tasty, but sadly lacking in liquor. I choose a long island because it is chock full of the good stuff, and if I am paying 10 bucks a glass mostly full of ice, I want it to pack a punch.  Although the food was great and service stellar, BJs loses major points with this gal for scrimping on the good stuff.  Almost redeemed a star when friend's salad arrived and we got our entrees before we had to remind server about my salad, which she immediately comped for us. Way to go, BJs, but I'm still mad about the drinks."
Rebecca E.,"Atlanta, GA",115,106,496,3.0,9/21/2013,"The star rating is for weekends. You can go here and get great service during the week and have an awesome pizza and the bartender or server is attentive. Then...the weekend happens. Our pizza was a weird mix of items. It was supposed to be a buffalo chicken pizza but we found some BBQ sauce and sausage on it. We know better than to go here on a weekend and will continue to stay away.  If you want to request a server, Corey is awesome. He checks in on ya and has great suggestions but doesn't act like an annoying cheerleader type server."
Jason S.,"Poulsbo, WA",43,86,55,2.0,10/22/2013,"BJ's left me unimpressed.  The food was mediocre and the beer okay.  The service we received was less than desirable. The two beers I tried, the Nutty Brewnette and the Hopstorm IPA.  Both beers lacked anything memorable.  The Nutty Brewnette is supposed to be a brown ale but lacked any significant hints of the nutty flavor described.  The Hopstorm IPA was just not ""hoppy"" as I like IPAs to be. For dinner, I ordered the Crispy Jalapeño Burger.  I was average at best.  The meat was obviously frozen and then thawed which caused the burger to lack any juiciness.  The jalapeños were those tangy ones that sit in a jar of vinegar instead of being spicy like you'd notice in fresh ones.  It is nothing to rave about. As for the service, I really wish owners would stress how much of a difference a smile can (or lack of one) can make.  Our server was either tired or grumpy or both.  She lacked the attention to detail required to notice that there were four of us and only two sets of utensils.  She didn't know anything about the restaurant's participation in the Washington Beer Lovers club.  The only time she was somewhat friendly was when she dropped the check off. Overall, BJ's seems to get quite a lot of business.  Most of the crowd seemed to be teenagers enjoying their homecoming night.  I would let the teens have this one and recommend adults find better food and better beer elsewhere."
Traci J.,"Seattle, WA",87,317,46,3.0,3/16/2014,"No more house made chips. Bummer.  Perusing the menu is almost as daunting as the Cheesecake Factory.  It was a toss up between the angel hair pasta and the chicken club sandwich.  The sandwich won out so that I could have my two tastes.  Served on garlic toasted bread, a couple slices of thin cut bacon and enough chicken breast to cover all parts of the bread. No rearranging necessary.  Leaf lettuce, swiss, avocado, roma tomatoes and a slather of mayo.  Although I was fairly full eating half the sandwich and a handful of fries, I shoved the rest down the gullet since it wouldn't be good later.  My friend said the french dip was delicious with the horseradish sauce and tasty au jus. Although we were the first guests seated this morning, the kitchen was a little slow in getting the food out.  Not a destination restaurant, but a good choice while shopping at the mall."
Karl J.,"Spokane, WA",28,3,,5.0,2/12/2015,"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, and great staff made this a great stop on our vacation. Come here and ask for Jennifer. She was a great server!"
