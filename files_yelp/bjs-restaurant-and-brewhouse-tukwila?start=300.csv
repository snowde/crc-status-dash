Jordan S.,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",0,2,,5.0,2/12/2015,"We asked for the best server in the house and Jennifer happened to overhear us and she said yes that would be me and dang was she right on!!! Offered fantastic selections got us the best drinks, made sure we where taken care of like royalty! We loved you and your so down to earth and made us feel like the only people in the place. Keep it great and take care of everyone just the same way you did for us!!!!"
Elyn Z.,"Seattle, WA",149,49,,4.0,4/24/2013,"The Yelp reviews for BJ's at Southcenter are somewhat critical  regarding long wait times so we had some misgivings. But, we decided to take a chance. Enter Jonathan our courteous and efficient waiter. Within minutes he had taken our order and within another 10-15 minutes we had our meal.  We could not fault the service and the food was quite good. Jonathan said that BJ's had just completed some renovations and changes that would allow for quicker service. Whatever they did, it seems to be working.  No complaints here."
Brenda B.,"Kent, WA",0,21,1,5.0,5/17/2014,"LOVE this location!!!  I have gone to BJ's in four different states, and this location (I have been to 8 different locations) and this is my favorite one!!! Great Beer, Great Food, Great Staff! Downside - mall parking - m'eh. Growlers to go - how can you go wrong?!?"
Sheryl R.,"Federal Way, WA",0,1,,5.0,4/16/2016,Sojin was the best waiter that i've ever had at BJ's we'll come back to the South Center location in a heartbeat.
Troy T.,"Seattle, WA",0,18,,1.0,11/2/2014,"Whoa, what a mistake thinking that this was going to be an enjoyable experience.  I must have been blinded by the decorations but it was all too apparent that they are not investing in the staff nor the quality of the food.  Let me get my crayons out for you and be very short to the point - poor service, bland food, rude to non-existent knowledge by the staff of the menu.  One word -avoid.  And just to be fair, this is my third visit in two months - previous two times for a business lunch meeting.  So I have given this place a fair shake in opportunities."
April G.,"Seattle, WA",18,4,,4.0,7/17/2015,"Great food,  very busy but staff was friendly and made sure we were taken care of. Prices were good as well."
John N.,"Las Vegas, NV",3,147,,1.0,6/5/2016,"We went on 5/31/16 about 6pm. Our server  was Jennifer. We walked in, she asked if we had been there before, we said no. We told her we had never been to a BJ's. She walked us over near some tables and let us choose. When she came back we ordered, but after we got our food noticed that there were Happy Hour specials. She really should have told us this. But guess instead she would rather bump the check amount up in hopes of more tip. Not crowded at all in the place. I got the chicken club sandwich. Chicken was SUPER thin and very dry. Had to ask for extra mayo just to choke it down. Not a good sandwich. The potato wedges that I got were fat yet still way over cooked and so dry that ketchup couldn't save them. My friend got the burger and fries. He asked for the burger to be cooked medium, it was burnt. Not just well done, actually burnt all the way around. He got the thin fries, I forget what they call them, they were like eating little sticks. Dry, hard, tasteless.Oh and the margaritas were $8.25. Not worth it."
Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,4.0,4/30/2013,"We've eaten here dozens of times but I've never bothered to Yelp it... hmmm. I suspect it's because we often eat here on the way home from the airport; I work in my company's Washington, DC, office one week out of every six to eight weeks, and given that there's nothing gluten-free offered on the plane, I'm usually tired AND starving when I get to baggage claim. We are usually hitting BJ's after the dinner rush since my plane lands at 9:30 pm Friday nights. That means we avoid the usual very long waits for a table most of the time, but we've come often enough at dinnertime for me to testify to the waits... ugly. Go shopping! I am a big fan of the giant stuffed baked potatoes (butter, bacon, and cheddar cheese only for me). I also like the balsamic-glazed chicken. My husband likes most of it but tends to stick to their giant salads. My son keeps trying the tiny corndogs and keeps not liking them LOL though he does like the smiley-face fries.  ALL of their french fry options have gluten. Be aware. Service is often half-assed here. We've had long waits for food, mistakes on food, and even mistakes on beverages. That costs them a half to a solid star for me... I'll give them the fourth star now because everything's been correct the last two times we've been. The chain is opening a branch in Redmond soon and since that's much closer to us, I suspect our days of driving to Tukwila to eat here are over, though we probably will continue to do the late-Friday thing when I get home from DC. By the way, the desserts we've had here have all been disappointing and too expensive. Stick to the root beer (it's got sugar) and go get ice cream or frozen yogurt in the mall. It will be better, and you will save $5."
Jenn K.,"Seattle, WA",69,15,1,3.0,4/3/2014,"Service is hit or miss, some of the servers are phenomenal, some are meh.  Food is hit or miss. Some things are gross some are delicious. Weird! I like the traditional wings, margarita pizza, and spaghetti. PS the Pizookie is TO DIE FOR...I get half chocolate chip half red velvet and it seriously is amaze balls. This is the main reason I come here. It can be SUPER slow and take FOREVER to get food...even when its not busy. Just get a drink (or two) and brace yourself for a long wait. Make sure you go with someone you like to talk to!"
Jacob M.,"Seattle, WA",0,7,1,3.0,6/26/2015,"It's just OK, the waiter was nice and the food was average at best. My one complaint was that while the restaraunt appeared to be about half full (maybe less) our party of only three had to wait 20 minutes for a table."
Wayne D.,"Renton, WA",147,64,23,4.0,2/17/2015,"Food here is good, happy hour is m-f 3-7pm. Might suggest staying away from the chili. It's not bad, just really full like a 1lb burger ground up in a bowl. Lunch is great also pretty good. Try the Nutty Brewnette beer on tap, yummy!"
Sarah R.,"Seattle, WA",79,320,37,3.0,2/26/2012,"Yes, it's a big chain restaurant attached to a mall. No, it's not terrible. The menu is extensive, the pizza is good, the booths are comfortable, & the service has always been good when I have been there. This is the type of place anyone could find at least something to eat. I really enjoy the avocado eggrolls. Yum!"
Clay B.,"Kent, WA",79,104,359,4.0,1/24/2014,I have been here many times for the lunch specials as well as dinner. The lunch special soup and salad is a great offer. The choices of soup are really good too. The chicken tortilla being at the top. They also have chowder and chili and of course house or cesar salad. It is an all you can eat so you you can try a few different ones. Then for dinner the pizzas are spectacular. The service is normally good we havent had a lot of problems. A definite good choice before or after shopping.
Kellie L.,"Kent, WA",281,382,570,3.0,2/15/2013,"This is for service only, since sadly, I cannot remember what I ordered.  We came here for a special occasion with a group of about 20... The wait staff were friendly and prompt and I don't remember needing anything filled. The one issue that we had was our table at one end of our group, was SO CLOSE to the table behind them, that they couldn't get out. The WHOLE time we were there. I alerted the manager, he said 'it sure is'... I dont remember him doing anything about it... BUT.. at least he was aware.  I don't find the food here to be great, it is just like Red Robin or Applebee's. Nothing stands out."
Alex N.,"Boise, ID",50,208,1,1.0,5/25/2013,This place gets worse every time I go there. I think there might be some problems in the back of the house because every server there seems miserable and it's rare that the service is above mediocre. The food sucks and it seems as though the tap lines rarely get cleaned (the beer tastes dank). Pretty piss poor for a place that prides itself on it's beer... Avoid if you can but if you can't best of luck!
T H.,"Tukwila, WA",1,70,7,1.0,10/5/2013,"HOLY MOLY, stay away from this place. Our server was absolutely incompetent, spent more time talking to his co-workers than actually taking my groups order. After taking drink orders, which came to us 15 minutes to receive, it took 20 minutes to come back and take an order for appetizers. Eventually , we had another server come in and say he was taking over for the first server.  To top it off, food was Blah. Go somewhere else."
Ruben H.,"Bellevue, WA",208,301,49,3.0,4/5/2013,"This place was a nice surprise, food was pretty good, kinda shocked to see you can order a pizza over a 100 ways but nice to know either way.  The wait for deep dish wasn't short but we were occupied trying to guess what narcotic our waiter had been using.....he was barely conscious and morbidly obese to the point he nearly waddled into children passing by.  I think we'll order to go next time."
Amela J.,"Seattle, WA",321,26,16,3.0,10/28/2014,"I have been to BJ's a number of times. The food's good, I usually get a burger and their crispy thin fries, I also really enjoy their pasta. The pizookies are a must if you come here! The only thing lacking is service, I usually go here later in the evening when it's not too busy and their service is so slow! Once, my friends are I were the only ones in the restaurant and they still took forever."
Jason S.,"Springville, NY",6,28,30,4.0,11/17/2014,"""A typical"" spin on American cuisine...great beer choices, always a seasonal on tap. Good family atmosphere w/ a friendly bar area for a solo outing or  friends. Good times, good food. A good, solid o'l stand by pub."
Ryan O.,"Boston, MA",18,170,2,2.0,1/22/2014,"Based on my other reviews...obviously I am a fan of fast and efficient service to meet the ambiance of the restaurant.  A colleague and I stopped here for a ""quick"" lunch this weeks and were very disappointed with certain aspects of our visit.  For me, it was the wait at the front.  The restaurant was maybe half full and you could clearly see that with all the open tables...however, the very friendly young ladies at the front said it would be about a 10 minute wait - which it was at least that long.  Apparently they were very short staffed that day, because even when we did order - a salad and a sandwich, the wait was at least 20 minutes before the food came (and this is a generous calculation of time). The food was fine, the service was adequate...but the timing was just so long for a work day lunch...they really need to speed things up before I would go back."
