Ashley S.,"Renton, WA",1,17,3,5.0,3/12/2015,"The pizzoki is yummy! And the service is awesome, very friendly and they got us seated quickly, pretty much everytime I go, it's awesome service.... Try they're root beer :)"
Raoul R.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,2,3.0,5/21/2015,"The food was delicious, their drinks were a little over priced but cold. Beer selection is great. Stay for their happy hour it's worth it! The reason for the 3/5 rating is definitely their service. I've been to this location more than once and always sit at the bar. The bartender is prompt and gets you what you order but that's it. No smile, no friendly talk, no personality, they almost looked bothered you sat at their bar top.. My advice, train your bartenders on the qualities of exceptional customer service which includes smiling and the occasional ""how's your day today?"" - anywhere I go I can get my drink poured and placed in front of me. But what are you (talking to management) going to do to ensure your customers return? It starts with your staff..."
Melissa A.,"Seattle, WA",26,71,,2.0,4/13/2013,"There is no reason our dinner should have taken three hours, especially in a place that was barely half full. From the time we sat down and the waiter came but to ask for drinks was about 1/2 an hour then we had to wait for him to come back and take our order. THEN an even longer wait to get our food. There were only five of us in our party spits not like we had a terribly huge order either. Asking for water took three tries from three different people. I'm not quite sure where our waiter would disappear to when he wasn't waiting on our table because he wasn't busy at any of the other tables.  Not planning on going back anytime soon, or ever."
Amy M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",99,453,407,4.0,9/9/2009,I discovered BJ's after living in SoCal for a year & a half and I was thrilled to see there was one up here now.  The menu here in Seattle has a much larger selection that the ones in Orange County and I was tempted to try something that wasn't pizza but BJ's knows how to scratch my BBQ Chicken Pizza itch just right! I love it and sometimes I think I should try making it at home but then I think why bother? I will just go to BJ's! We also got the lettuce shrimp wraps that my friend said were pretty tasty - I thought they looked pretty.  For some reason I found myself noticing that everyone working there kind of moved in slo-mo. Like they were just out for a Sunday afternoon drive. I wasn't in a hurry and the place wasn't very busy but it made me wonder what it is like when it does get busy.  I will definitely eat there again!
Jocelyn E.,"Sammamish, WA",117,270,,1.0,1/27/2013,"They say to never say never, but seriously, I'm never coming here again. The service is half-assed better than previous visits, but only because they're more persistent  - not because they're actually providing good service.  A friend ordered a glass of wine and the waitress came back with a beer.  She had an attitude about it too.  ""What, is beer not okay?""  Seriously?!  Here's an idea: Maybe you should bring the patrons what they ask for, and not what you think they should have.  Or maybe, just maybe, because you screwed up, you should offer to give the guy the beer and hurry off to get him the wine he ordered.  Just saying.  If it wasn't for the fact that we had a big group and she was guaranteed a tip, I would've taken that beer straight out of her tip. And left her nothing. But really, the service wasn't the biggest issue.  The problem would have been the food poisoning that both my husband and I got.  Nothing like hugging the porcelain bowl all night long.  Thankfully, our infant son was in another room and can sleep through the night, because there was no way either one of us was in good enough condition to tend to him. How do I know it was my dinner that gave me the food poisoning?  Because it's the only meal both of us had eaten together in 2 days.   Yes, no more BJ's for me.  Bad service and food poisoning in one visit would be the final straw."
Razel M.,"Seattle, WA",149,256,44,2.0,3/25/2013,"I've never really had a problem with BJ's. I mean sure, it's a chain restaurant, and they don't really have a specialty aside from their beer. But it was the kind of place you could go for fairly decent food where everyone would find something they liked. And there are pizookies, of course. My experience today kinda ruined all that for me. We went for a coworker's birthday lunch. Usually for these things, 1.5 hours is enough. Well, not at BJ's. Long story short, we waited so long for our food that some of us had to ask for it boxed up because we had meetings to go to. Thank goodness I had a small (non amazing) bruschetta appetizer to tide me over until my meeting ended. Then I ate my food and was even more upset because what the hell, it wasn't worth the wait. I had got the Tuscan Limone Chicken pasta, which was supposed to have a lemon butter sauce. There was no lemon in the sauce -- and the pasta was overcooked, and seemed that they had rushed it so much that they didn't even drain it properly. My sauce was watery with a very slight hint of butter. One of my coworkers ended up with the same watery pasta, so she ended up eating the shrimp off her scampi and tossing the rest. I hate when I pay so much for food that I can cook better at home. I hate when I pay for food that leaves me so unsatisfied I end up searching high and low the rest of the afternoon for other food that would erase the literal bad taste in my mouth and make me feel satiated.  And, as someone who works in the service industry, I hate when service-oriented places like restaurants don't take responsibility. The rest of our party had ended up waiting hella long for their bills to come out and were told, ""Oh sorry, it's because you asked for separate checks."" No word of apology about the food taking hella time to come out, no apology for the state of the food when it came, and tried to pass on the blame to the customer. That was the last straw for me. Because of pizookies (which, oh, I didn't even have time to eat today), and the good root beer, and previous okay experiences, BJ's gets to keep 2 stars. But I won't be going back."
Mychal L.,"Seattle, WA",0,3,,1.0,11/2/2014,"When I think of pizza I think evenly spread toppings with cheese and a nice crust. Which is what I thought I was getting. Not even close. I got a bj's favorite and when I got it back it looked like someone dropped it before they put it in the oven and cooked it anyway. All the toppings pushed to one side, barely any cheese and the pizza wasn't even cut. Never going back. The service was horrible. I walked in the guy took my money and said ""it's almost done, I'm going to smoke"""
Aj C.,"Seattle, WA",73,1,,3.0,2/3/2015,The food was good and their beer is good but the servers are not well trained. Went there Sunday night to watch the Seahawks game and right after i got home I got double charged and I only gave 4 dollars tip and they made it 8 dollars.
Amity S.,"Anaheim, CA",1,17,,2.0,9/7/2013,"Star rating based purely off the quality of the food!!  The food overall was delicious, I love this restaurant and enjoy the variety of food and drinks.  Now on the other hand our waitress for our party of five was extremely unpleasant. We constantly had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, she never checked up on us to the point where we had to stop other servers for assistance, never once did she respond to our countless thank you's, and to top it all off she never even looked up at us when we spoke to her. Great food yet crappy customer service!  Watch out for Victoria!"
Mel G.,"Cedar City, UT",62,322,15,2.0,10/9/2013,"Came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner and they accommodated the big group very well on a busy night.  The menu was already set for us, pizza and a salad buffet kind of thing.  I am gluten free so it really stunk for me as I could only eat some toppings with my salad, the salad was not that fantastic either.  Just iceberg and some sprinkling of veggies.  My husband and everyone else though said the pizza was delicious and I could see the pieces were huge.  Looks like a good bang for your buck."
Alex H.,"Kent, WA",356,258,183,4.0,11/25/2013,"I used to work in the mall so being a regular here was an absolute must especially stoping by for lunch on game days. Safe to say I've had almost everything here on the menu. And very beer too.  Let's start with the beer (my favorite part).  If you are a beer enthusiast than this brewery delivers some of my favorites. Especially that Jeremiah's red which is a Irish style strong ale. Doesn't matter if you're into IPAs, porters, stouts or even lagers they have some good stuff.  Even seasonal beers that'll get you hop'n. See what I did there? Now the food. Nothing there really screams ""must have!"" But don't expect to be able to successfully watch your calories eating here either. Even their salads are hefty. Burgers are huge. And pizza is mediocre. Pretty average for an American restaurant. Service is hit or miss here. It kind of depends on whose the manager that day and how they feel. Overall, decent place to watch the game."
Kevin C.,"Renton, WA",79,231,22,3.0,5/7/2013,"Food is alright. Drinks are good though, but I just can't rave about it. Kinda wish there were more choices nearby."
Maggie E.,"Puyallup, WA",2,9,,3.0,3/18/2015,"Our service was slow and 2 of the orders came out wrong and had to be sent back. It seemed like waited for forever for our food and than it was frustrating when it came out wrong. The waitress was extremely nice and doing her best to get what we wanted, but just took forever."
Sofia P.,"Kent, WA",49,5,2,1.0,10/11/2014,"My first time coming here and most likely my last. Bathrooms were unkept, I had to ask for silverware long after I received my apps. When my dinner arrived I had to ask her to take plates away as she could see there was hardly room on the table  my dinner came with fries, again had to ask for ketchup and still waited. Food was boring and plain."
Mathew M.,"Seattle, WA",1,6,,4.0,7/12/2013,"All right. Previous experience was vastly different than this one.  The wait staff proved rapid and competent. I never had a single problem with any request I'd made and everything was both swift and smoother than glass. The food this time (for the record, I had the burger melt, same as before) was immaculate. Presentation was great and the taste was amazing. A burger melt may be tough to screw up but even tougher to perfect, and I was shocked to learn given my prior experience here that BJ's had finally done the latter. I'd definitely recommend this place now that significant changes were made (though the restroom stalls were once again missing the gentle caress of Scott tissue...) My opinion has been reversed, but seriously, guys: toilet paper!  (PS: Try the garlic aioli as a dip for your fries. Your mind will be absolutely blown.)"
C C.,"San Diego, CA",12,74,,2.0,10/15/2012,"So I ate here recently and I ordered off the lunch special: Chicken fried steak with mash potatos and a whole lot of corn. You know what? It's my favorite dish! I've ordered it before and remembered that I like it. So you're probably wondering why I gave it 2 starts instead of 3 or 4..  The service. This guy who was waiting on us was SO eager to get us out! I understand that it's always nice to have a quick turnover when it comes to waiting tables.. the more people you serve the more tips. I get that. I used to wait tables too, but I would never ever rush my customers like this guy did! As soon as we got our meal he set our bill down and asked if we would like dessert!! Hello? We haven't even dug into our meal and you're giving us our bill and asking us if we want dessert?  I just thought he was rude. It didn't stop there. After we finished our lunch, we actually did want dessert and we ordered 3 Triple Chocolate Pizookie Made with Ghirardelli and he gave us 3 BJ's Famous Pizookie instead! We told him that's not what we ordered! He didn't take it back, he was annoyed and frazzled and instead he gave us a BOWL of the chocolate ice cream that's on the Triple Chocolate Pizookie. He didn't even offer an apology. I'd love to come back to this BJ's for the food, but that service was really bad."
kris r.,"Kent, WA",31,18,44,4.0,3/10/2013,"Not too bad of a place for lunch. I usually avoid during Saturday nights here.  As for food, I think it's a little overpriced for the amount or portion you would get. I can eat and my pork was only less than three bites and I think that's a problem.  I did enjoy their Calamari though and it's one of the best although I know it's frozen Calamari and not fresh, so they must thaw it out perfectly.  I like the setting of the place and the seats doesn't feel cramped or too close to another table.  The server was good and attentive but not too overly annoying which is good.  Again, this is my own review and my own experience and I always encourage you to check it out yourself to have your own experience."
Ruiza A.,"Kent, WA",269,90,326,2.0,11/5/2012,"Wow the ""Review Highlights"" are spot on!! They have A LOT of items on the menu, but can't ignore these stand out ones. Love these items as well: Avocado Egg rolls $9.95,  DEEP DISH Pizza (not the flatbreads)..They have whole wheat available as well! Mini Deep Dish Pizzas start at $10.75. They have small, medium and large sizes. Large priced at $24.25 Pizookie $5.95 If i love these dishes then why the 2 star? Just the same reason fellow yelpers below were complaining about... HORRIBLE SERVICE EVERY TIME I go! =( Even ordering to-go experience wasn't good. Maybe I'm unlucky? But then a couple of friends and my sister have told me about their bad experiences/service from BJs. I don't know..too many times just killed it for me..No sense of urgency, no anticipating guests needs, reading the table properly and no genuine care from our servers when we dined in. My sister was standing for over 10minutes at their to-go station and no one helped her when a lot of the staff were just standing together laughing and chit chatting not putting the customer first.  no matter how good the food is in front of me, eating it mad/pissed/disappointed doesn't make it any better..This really ruins it for me, especially if i'm paying a little bit more than normal, i should be expecting good service at least. I hope they change management or they see these reviews so they can do some retraining on that location.. Things to take note of:  *They serve glutten free items *They take online ordering as well for to go & they have to-go parking spots to pull up to."
Heather J.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",192,643,278,4.0,12/17/2012,"Still pretty good, incredible service, waiter very attentive and very knowledgeable about beer options. Tons of beer options makes it hard to chose, many from others as well. Plus a full bar. Open til midnight on a friday. Parking lot can be a little crazy, but if you can get past that its worth a stop in. Not too loud, not too many drunk people. Good for having a conversation with friends while drinking some beer. Still an incredible amount of menu items I want to try. My only complaint is that the floor seems so slick, I worry that I will fall down and hurt myself, luckily I didn't, but you might want to pay attention to your shoe selection. I wish they would open up another location closer to me. Strangely not too many regular bar options in this area, but this worked out better than expected."
Lorin L.,"Northgate, Seattle, WA",78,14,38,1.0,9/27/2014,"Worst BJ's I've been too.... But I'll just keep it simple with 3 things  1. Came into BJ's from calling them in advance and they were confused and gave us two different times when I called in 5 minutes before  2. My sister asked for some water while we had to wait and 3 waitresses looked at us confused and hesitant on whether or not they could provide us with some water ?.... So we waited after they had to converse with one another and finally they came to a conclusion on how they can get us some water. Good job, it only took 3 of them to figure it out lol  3. My seat was dirty with food from the previous customers so I asked her for a napkin to clean it (after I said I would cause I felt bad if she did since I usually don't like waiters going out of their way to do things like that even though it is their job) I had to repeat myself 3 times for her to semi understand what I was trying to say so I just said can I have a napkin? Then she came back with one napkin saying ""This was the only napkin I could find."" LOLOLOL I mean please there's no way... There's only One napkin available to you, but anyways I cleaned the mess myself and didn't even order yet and went through this random mess. I always come to BJ's but this location seems to be the worst one so far /:"
