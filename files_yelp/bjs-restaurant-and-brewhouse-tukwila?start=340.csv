Sean F.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I'm not sure about the rest of the huge menu, but the black and blue burger was very dry and missed the black and blue components."
Nicole C.,"Auburn, WA",0,17,,4.0,3/17/2015,"If you're looking for top-notch food, then BJ's is not the place to go. If you are looking for a nice place with a huge menu selection and some pretty good micro brews, then BJ's will probably meet your expectations. I've been to BJ's with many of my friends, all of who have very different tastes and everyone was able to find something that they enjoyed. This is a great place if you are with a large group of people and everyone wants something different. This place does get crowded, especially on Friday and Saturday nights because it is in the mall. Be prepared to wait awhile if you show up during those times."
Jamie A.,"Anchorage, AK",3,10,3,4.0,11/8/2014,Excellent pizza and beer. Service was on the spot once we got a table. Waitress was young but very pleasant and efficient which helped me to chill out. The wait was horrendously long at approx. 6:00 ish pm. We must have waited at least 45 mins. to an hour and the hostesses kept telling us 20-25 mins ea. time we checked in like twice. My suggestion is go to dinner at like 4:00 pm ish otherwise make reservations ahead of time and don't be starving like because everything may bug you while you are waiting.
Jannae V.,"Renton, WA",8,66,24,3.0,11/18/2014,"I would have to give this place a 3, not a total downer but not my ""go to"" place to eat at Southcenter (that's Duke's). The food is pretty blah, nothing to write home about but not appalling. I frequent the bar on lunches during the work week, get the all you can eat soup and salad combo, they have a damn good tomato bisque that I enjoy. For the most part their wait staff is friendly. Not a bad joint."
Linda L.,"Bellevue, WA",80,297,189,2.0,5/16/2013,"Summary: Ok, but nothing to write home about  I was here a few Saturdays back with three others. It was busy, waitress was good and humored us, but service was a little slow. Noise level was pretty high, with large TV screens dotted everywhere.  I had the gluten free pizza with bacon, which was not bad considering it was the first gluten pizza I've eaten. A. ordered a steak, which was supposed to be medium rare, but was well done. It tasted odd in texture, and was not very well seasoned. When I say odd, I mean it tasted like the steak was boiled, then charred on the outside. A. described it as tasting like a burger. His folks shared a deep pan pizza, which they enjoyed.  This is one of the hurry-up-with-your-food kind of place. I hate that. Doubt I will be back."
Myduyen N.,"Seattle, WA",92,132,80,1.0,4/24/2014,"We used to come here often for dinner but the constant bad service makes us not want to go back. The only reason why we even went to dinner last night is because my friend wanted to go here.  My family and I got there early to get a table in case it was busy. I gave the hostess my name and how many people are in our party. A little after that I guess the computer was not working. No one announced anything but yet other parties were seated. We were there before those other parties, one of which was a larger party than ours.  I waited a few minutes then went back up to ask the hostess how long it would be. All she said was that the computers were down. She had a piece of paper where she put names down but did not even bother to ask me for my name to put it down. She completely ignored me and faced the other way until I left. No apologies or anything! Our server was nice to tell us that the computers were down and the food might take longer since they have to manually write the orders. I appreciate that but she was not writing down correctly! I ordered my son orange juice and she came back with apple juice. I asked for my burger to be well down and it was pink inside. Of course she was nowhere to be found. We didn't get our refills and my husband had to flag her down to get our checks.  I don't think I would ever go back here because each time the experience is worse."
Nam N.,"Renton, WA",677,802,135,3.0,6/13/2013,"the food - always consistent. the menu choice is extensive. the portions - enough to feed a small family. the baked potato is probably my favorite thing to eat here. the service - is rather inconsistent though.  Depends on where you sit and what time you sit service can lack greatly.   It's about the same taste and quality and service as a Cheesecake Factory.  A hit or miss - but because the food is consistent enough, there's reason to come back and enjoy a couple of fresh beers on tap, watch a couple of sports and enjoy the company of friends."
Crystal D.,"South Village, Manhattan, NY",2,3,2,5.0,1/22/2015,"Love the BBQ chicken specialty pan pizza.  And it's awesome that a restaurant is leveraging smart phone tech: I can order ahead, pay from my table, love."
Marley S.,"Honolulu, HI",63,45,267,3.0,9/4/2013,"has a big menu, but nothing amazing. The service is good. I'm sure it's way better when it's not super crowded. We went for a Pre-Season Seahawks game, so it was beyond busy (you know we're ranked #1 going into the regular season, right??) What's nice is they have ""small plates"" so we could try a few things which was nice. We had some wontons that were AWESOME! I didn't care fort he thai ones, but the buffalo ones are really good!!!"
Marivic K.,"Des Moines, WA",0,5,,5.0,12/20/2014,"This is my favorite Southcenter restaurant. Home of the yummy fresh from the oven Pizookie, and there's Happy Hour during all NFL games! BTW, the best server in the world is Karina! Thanks for such awesome service!"
Jessica M.,"Seattle, WA",0,20,,3.0,1/17/2015,"We walked  in and the front desk was having a gossiping session and whispering in eachothers ears, completely ignoring us. It was pretty rude so we expected our service to be similar. Instead our waitress Brittney was very sweet and timely. And our food was very good as well. The prices arent bad for such a fancy place. I would have given 5 stars if the front desk was more professional."
Ashley W.,"Seattle, WA",70,40,4,4.0,11/22/2014,"Have been here many times. Never had an issue with service. The staff is always friendly and tentative. Usually come for the pizza, appetizers, and alcohol!!  Don't forget a pizooki!!  I am sad the red velvet pizooki was taken off the menu. One more mini complaint the restaurant should replace all the two seater booths, I refuse to be seated there. How they thought two people could comfortably sit there and have enough space for their food and drinks is beyond me. Anytime I've seen someone sat there they look pissed off. Major design fail."
DLynn Q.,"Renton, WA",53,8,3,3.0,8/18/2013,"BJs has always been a favorite of mine when it comes to the menu. I just had the shrimp lettuce wraps and they're DELICIOUS..... But lately, getting my food has been more than 30 minutes wait time and the couple that came in later got theirs in 10 minutes.... I tip the waitstaff great but I'd expect my order take no longer than 20 minutes at the very least! Overall, great food and prefer my waitress Jessica.  Only1daisy"
Lucas R.,"Seattle, WA",170,479,81,4.0,6/7/2013,"Pretty typical BJs...fun place to catch a game, great beer selection, menu so huge it is overwhelming, and fast lunch service. This place is pretty large so they can usually handle the lunch and dinner rush without too long of a wait.  I like the new flatbread black and bleu pizza a lot and appreciate that we can get fast, friendly service for a lunch that only takes about 30 minutes, usually."
Patricia C.,"Seattle, WA",348,90,,3.0,6/13/2012,"I'll give this place an A-OK.  I love the food and this is one of the places I go to for my Ahi Poke fixes since there's only a handful in Seattle that serves Poke!!  HOWEVER......  There is this one server/runner/busser there that knocked down a few points for me/my group. I believe her name is Tabitha? SHE WAS HORRIBLE!!!!  Being a graduate in the Hospitality field and having six years of experience in the industry I would say that she definitely doesn't belong in it. It wasn't that she was slow or had our orders mixed up but it was her lousy attitude that ruined the experience for me and for all.  There is nothing more I loathe than people with poor attitudes in this industry. The hospitality industry is not something anyone can do, although many try and I understand there are personalities out there that can not be satisfied, even with the best of disposition.  But I mean she wasn't even courteous or cordial at all. I can't even sum up the words or describe how she represented BJ's because it was just flat out horrible. To say the least she was a C_ NT!!! My group of friends didn't even do anything or say anything wrong to her she was just nasty right off the bat!  So YELPERS here's a tip: if you get Tabitha as your server I would recommend that you ask for another server and save yourself from having a bad experience so you can enjoy your pizookie in the the end! =)"
Vanna P.,"Renton, WA",16,102,231,1.0,4/24/2014,"Didn't have the greatest experience last night. My friend and I planned to meet at 6pm for dinner and her and her husband and baby got there a little before and put in their names to wait for a table. They were the first ones there waiting at the time and then 3 more parties came in after them. For some reason the computer system went down and they had to do things manually so they started writing the parties names down on paper. When I got there around 6, I noticed parties being seated and my friend said all those parties came after them, so she went to talk to the hostess who was rude and basically ignored her. Finally, we were seated, the waitress came by and took our orders and by that time the computer system was fine again. We waited for our food forever, noticing the parties that came after us that were seated before us were already done with their food and paying and leaving. To top it all off our waitress didn't really check on us/refill water and when we were waiting for our check she was no where to be found. Needless to say, we won't be back for a long time."
James H.,"North Las Vegas, NV",74,47,15,5.0,10/5/2012,"Hey guys this is the first time I have ever enjoyed a meal for FIVE STARS at a eat joint in my life.  i asked them to make me something special because they didn't  have anything on the list, and came back with something slammin!!!! Yesser i'll be back for this place. When they arrive don't even bother looking at the menu, just let them know what you in the mood for, they will point out something on the menu, and ask if you want something different, just say yes, and TIP!!!  you cheap &%(*"
Jennifer F.,"Federal Way, WA",128,13,,5.0,12/5/2014,"My company treated us out to BJ's and I have to say I am sooo happy we came here. It was my first time and honestly I was impressed. I mean we sat outside on the deck, it was raining but we were warm because they had heaters overhead that kept the seats nice and toasty. The food was SOOOO good too. I got chicken parmesan, calamari with a sample taster that had a variety of finger foods. It was sooo delish. As for my service, the service was great. The waiter was really nice. I think he was new because he didn't know the menu well but his effort to help us showed, and that to me is all that matters. I AM PLANNING ON GOING BACK!!!"
Shawna B.,"Seattle, WA",1,43,,4.0,10/18/2013,"I've been here three times before writing a review. The first time the food was great but my server was a little weird, kept acting out of it & dazed/confused. Recommended things we SHOULDN'T get because it was close to closing or he thought they were made nasty at this location. Odd. Everything we ordered though was good, & he was generally nice, so no problems. The second time was a great experience, good food, nice waitress, very clean, almost all the sports games are on different flat screen HD TVs around the place. Third time was a hit, our waitress was great---found my phone that I accidentally left on the table & ran it out to me, & recommended some specials to us. Food was again pretty damn good. I would recommend this place if you're in Southcenter & tired of Olive Garden & Cheesecake Factory was a long wait. It's very nice inside, a mix between a sports bar & an upscale place. Reasonably prices, about $12.99-22.00 for a dinner entree. Steaks are very yummy here."
Jenny H.,"Seattle, WA",101,134,148,2.0,4/14/2013,"I use to love coming to Bj's when it had first opened. The food was always great and even when it was busy, I never use to wait over 30 minutes for my meal. Recently it's changed. I had dinner here last night and would have say it was the worse experience I have had here. It was busy so I knew the service was going to be slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow. As my friend and I got our table, we ordered 2 small plates first to start off the night. As we sat, 3 other couples came and were seated around us. Tell me why they got their appetizers before my friend and I got ours? Oh because our waiter hardly ever came to check on us.  Though our waiter was nice and friendly, we felt as though we weren't given any attention at all. We finally ordered our meals and got our small plates which were good. Now the wait begins. The three couples that got seated way after us all recieved their food. My friend and I looked at each other and was like ""wtffffff?"" and of course our waiter saw what happened. We were going to tell him to cancel our meals because we had other plans but he rushed back out with our plates and told us ""sorry to have made you wait. THe deep fried onions that goes on your plate is still being cooked right now and I will bring it out once it's done."" Deep fried onions?? Ain't that the first and fastest thing to be cooked on the chicken balsalmic dish? I ordered the Tuscan chicken limone and I have to say, my dish just didn't taste right. Plus you can tell that it's been sitting under the heater for some time because the sauce had dried up on the plate and on my pasta. I had it sent back and replaced with the chicken alfredo. I can totally tell that my waiter was getting annoyed of me. Maybe I should have said something like ""IT'S BEEN ALMOST AN HOUR AND WE'RE STILL WAITING ON OUR FOOD."" When I receieved my dish, many of the noodles were still hard! I pretty much lost my appetite and took all of it to go.  I may be venting too much about my meal but if you're going to serve and cater to the customers, do it right. I didn't want to be the annoying rude customers so I bit my tongue, paid for the meals and left. I don't think I will be returning since this isn't the first time service and the food has been like this."
