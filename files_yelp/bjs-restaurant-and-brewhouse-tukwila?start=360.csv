Sarah F.,"San Diego, CA",293,559,191,2.0,4/14/2011,"I don't know about this place... I only go there to get drinks with people or food if it's late and not much else is open Pros? -Lots of beer selections -Specials such as a free pizookies with movie tickets or 2 free salads and a dessert with a medium pizza for $1 more (these are constantly changing and not upfront knowledge though...) -The make-your-own deep dish pizzas are pretty good -Lime-in-the-coconut martini is delicious Cons? -Most of the food is fatty and overpriced -Service seriously depends. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not very good, and once the guy was so terrible I couldn't believe it. He bothered us about 8 times asking what we wanted in the first 3 minutes we were there, then didn't come back, took my friends order (who said no tomato since I'm allergic and they wanted to share with me) and then again didn't come back for a long time. We hailed him down because the salad was covered in tomatoes. He said ""errr.. okay"" and came back 10 seconds later after obviously just picking off the top tomatoes. When I said there were still lots of tomatoes he went ""oh"" and walked off. Where's my non-tomato salad? Where's my customer service?"
Cristian R.,"Seattle, WA",26,30,70,4.0,10/6/2013,"Just fell in love with a Nutty Brewnette at BJs.  Nice body, good head, overall a very tasty beer.  It went very well with the potstickers and California Club flatbread. The potstickers were very tasty. The flatbread was just average, and a very small portion...guess that's what you get at happy hour prices."
J.j. F.,"Snoqualmie, WA",52,18,7,1.0,5/25/2014,"Normally I stick to the pizza, but today I thought I would venture out. Huge mistake, I had the worst Cobb salad in my life. It was shredded lettuce with diced tomatoes and feta cheese. I felt like they ran out of the ingredients and substituted taco toppings. This experience makes me not want to return. On a positive note, service was good."
Jaymee M.,"Everett, WA",84,528,,2.0,11/19/2012,"Oh Bj's, I want to like you, really I do. Yesterday was the worst experience ever. We came in with a party of 6. Yes, it was busy but we were still seated right away. Right off the bat the waiter was very flustered. I think that he had too many tables or something. He took our drink orders, which was a few beers, a lemon aide for the kid and 2 root beers. Nothing complicated. 10 Min's later, he comes back with most everything but the kid drink. I asked him to please bring it when he came back because well, it's a very hungry, tired 3 year old. 15 Min's he comes back with it and to take our orders. 45 Min's later food comes, One dish was cold and the server drops a burger. No apologies, nothing. That was the last straw for me. You could at least say sorry, offer a dessert, something. 45 MINS and then that?! Come on. We had not even had a chance to eat when the server was back over dropping the bill off and asking if we wanted dessert. Um........can we start eating the food you just brought us?  We will not be back. It seems every time we do come here it takes FOREVER and the food is just sub par. Yes, they have a lot of variety, but that doesn't make up for the crap service that you get."
Samantha E.,"Puyallup, WA",2,47,3,5.0,9/21/2014,"We went here for the first time yesterday, and the people couldn't have been nicer. They are very welcoming and the food was AMAZING. We got buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks for appetizers which were amazing. Then I got a pan pepperoni pizza which was beyond yummy. I just loved the place. Very clean and has the cutest decorating. One of the waiters (who wasn't ours) over heard that it was our first time and came over to check on us and asked us about our visit. Was just really nice that he went out of his way to do that. Waiter was awesome too!!!"
Kristina L.,"Seattle, WA",32,259,9,3.0,3/26/2013,"BJ's has always been an average restaurant.  What sets them apart from other places is they have a big beer selection.  Since I am not a beer drinker, I don't get to take advantage. Last time I had their deep dish pizza.  I was surprised it was so good.  I've also had several of their salads which were all about average.   Service is hit and miss. I've had some servers be super helpful and kept my drinks refilled and just about the other half were sort of like space cadets :) BJ's is definately worth checking out and it's always less busy than the Cheesecake Factory, LOL.  They sell Pepsi products."
Julia W.,"Seattle, WA",91,653,336,3.0,4/25/2011,"I've been going to BJ's for almost 2 years (when they first opened in WA until now). I used to frequent the Tacoma, WA location as I had friends who lived nearest to that location. When it opened in Tukwila it saved me about another 25 miles down I-5. The thing I used to like about BJ's was that they had a decent happy hour (half-off pizzas, some $ off drinks and it was extended until 7pm). The last time I was there (a few months ago), it seems the happy hour menu has been trimmed down. As someone who does go out socially frequently with different sets of friends or family, happy hour is something that I do look for when I go out. It helps cut down on the cost of food/drinks as well as offers a better chance to have the restaurant full and not half-empty. BJ's is still a decent place to hang out and not wait for a table (it's never super busy) but the prices are a little on the spendy side for some entrees (I usually get their soup/salad combo). The food itself is good but the service is usually poor (a waitress is overwhelmed or just doesn't care). They have big screen TV's so it's a definite 'substitute' for a sports bar and can be used as such but average bill is $20+/pp."
Michelle L.,"Bellevue, WA",126,173,10,5.0,2/8/2013,"hehehehe...i'm a sucker for chain restaurants. i'm a sucker for any food that is DELICIOUS, SIMPLE, AND FATTENING. therefore, bj's restaurant totally hits the spot every time!  i'm inlove with the deep dish pizzas, particularly Bj's Favorite pizza, the spinach and artichoke dip, and OF COURSE, the pizookies (deep dish baked cookies with ice cream on top...cookies n cream FTW).  service has always been good every time ive gone. there isn't much that i need to complain about service really. in the past i was always sad that there are only locations in Tacoma and Tukwila! however, i live near the redmond town center and i've discovered that they are building a new location right there! i am beyond excited!  good food and good service deserves a thumbs up in my book for sure!"
Al C.,"Seattle, WA",19,112,16,2.0,7/30/2013,"STOP - I'll repeat again - BEFORE you go here, read this review: We had never been and went completely open minded. There are so many better alternatives, this place is a waste. Over priced, EXTREMELY vast menu allows for multiple items not perfected, merely served. I had sandwich, wifey had burger. BOTH of which were bad based on the price. Isn't that shocking? I feel like 2 dishes that should be a shoe in for ANY restaurant should be these 2. Possible alternatives:  Joey's (shows how bad BJs is when I recommend Joey's) Red Robin Cheesecake Factory Applebees (again, shows how bad it is)"
Carrie N.,"Renton, WA",2,9,2,2.0,9/21/2013,"I normally love this place - but the service this time was horrendous. The wait to be seated was understandable for a Saturday night, but our service was truly awful. We had ridiculous waits between seeing our server, our food was mediocre at best when it finally showed (we could barely get our deep dish pizza out of the pan and it was half burned) plus it took a solid 30 minutes for our pizookie to show up. It had obviously been made fresh at the end of that 30 minutes, so where was our original pizookie? And why did it take 20 minutes after we gave our server our pizookie order for her to check and see if we had gotten it? Obviously not, because it wasn't sitting in front of us!!! And apparently their software just crashed so we also have to sit here and wait for our check. To be honest, I'm not feeling the love tonight. I'll definitely think twice before I come back - I'll have to wait a while to forget this experience. Edit: they did finally comp our drinks (2 teas & 1 beer) after we waited another 20 minutes to get our check. Honestly, it helped but didn't make up for the rest of the crappy service....better than nothing though."
Nathan D.,"Seattle, WA",13,12,,4.0,6/28/2012,"I can't deny it. In fact I WON'T deny it. I can't help giggling every time I see the name of this restaurant, but at least now I have had the experience of finally eating there after years of passing it by.  My friend and I went as a sort of going away dinner for her, and we were initially pleased to see that they had decent prices considering the area. We ended up getting two appetizers, an entree, and dessert without breaking the bank. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, I enjoyed the fact that they weren't just stuffed with parmesan cheese and salt. The mac n cheese was dang tasty too, the addition of chunks of bacon certainly helped.  We also got the buffalo chicken pizza, which as one reviewer said wasn't particularly overflowing with toppings compared to how much bread there was. Still, it was good, tasted like wings on a pizza. And who doesn't love things smothered with ranch dressing.  We finished the meal with a red velvet ""pizookie"", their sort of signature pizza-cookie dessert thing. Oh God. It. Was. Heavenly. Gobs of vanilla ice cream melting over a hot pan of red velvet cookie with cream cheese frosting bits? Yes please.  While the food was great, I am dinging one star due to a rather bored and non-engaging waiter along with the almost impposible to get refills.  Definitely a good option compared to many of the other places in the Southcenter area, will keep on my list of good restaurants in the area."
Meri D.,"Seattle, WA",30,90,,2.0,11/8/2012,"Meh, meh, meh... I've been to this place a handful of times, and I always leave wondering why I chose BJ's in the first place.  Oh yeah now I remember...I've got friends who have the misfortune of living south of Seattle, so when we want to get together, we generally choose to meet in the Southcenter vicinity. Most of the restaurants around there, besides being chains, either don't offer happy hour or end their HH before 7 pm. Hence, we always find ourselves at BJ's. BJ's isn't bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. Their beers aren't memorable, and neither is the food. The last time I was there with a girl friend of mine, we got awkwardly hit on by some weirdo. Did BJ's become a meat market for the south end without me getting the memo? It just feels so contrived for that sort of thing, but then I looked around and realized we may have been the last to know. This is obviously not BJ's fault, but being practically ignored by the servers and waiting 35 minutes for shrimp lettuce wraps IS their issue. Oh, and since when does $1 off drinks and $2 off overpriced appetizers constitute happy hour specials? I guess I've just been spoiled living in Seattle within walking distance to some amazing places. Anyways, I wish someone would recommend a good local place that has reasonable happy hour times to meet friends south of Seattle. Until then, I suppose I shall suck it up and conform to the masses...or maybe I'll just find some new friends!!!"
Jupiter C.,"Seattle, WA",41,54,7,3.0,5/7/2013,"I'm bumping BJ's up a little. I ate there again and this time had a very capable waitress. The kitchen, unfortunately, still couldn't get their act together. It took 20 minutes to get an order of cold mozzarella sticks. We sent them back, and ordered other items that came out okay - still on the cold side though. A manager did come by to talk to us and I let her know that while we loved our server, we were still unimpressed with the kitchen. She gave us a free dessert, but she also made excuses about the kitchen ""having problems"" and them ""working on it."" I've been in food service, so while I understand her, I also know that the average customer doesn't care WHY the food sucks. I'd love to have an experience here where I actually pay for everything. But if they keep messing up, they'll have to keep comping my food."
Daren D.,"Seattle, WA",684,1691,1042,4.0,2/3/2010,"Ooo, shnazzy place; especially in the evening. Came here to hang out with my little cousin & others a bit before she heads off to the Marines (which made me rather happy & proud since I used to babysit the brat when she was a kid). This is one of those places where the interior ""stands out"" well during the evening, thanks to lighting. Cool dark, bold, and a slight feel of upscale with it's deep colors and contrasting touches. The offset color wood floors are very nice. The men's room is cool; even gots some vintage babes getting their workouts on and same era race car pictures. I was in a super laid back mood so didn't spend much time perusing like i usually do. ""Yes, I'll get the veggie burger."" That was good. + a water. Service seemed pleasant and friendly; smiled. It wasn't that long of a table we had, but I would've liked for her to walk to my end for my order (and questions), especially since i had to raise my voice. I think everything we had was pretty good, the mood seemed casual and fun, so... yeah. I really digged that corner Pacman-style booth's design. That's my table if i ever plan a small outing. Great place for dinner."
Denise O.,"Federal Way, WA",0,20,36,2.0,8/16/2015,"I feel like this place is overpriced and service is so-so. We called ahead of time to make a reservation, and were told they don't do that. They do 'call aheads' so when we show up we are seated faster. We called around 6 on a Sunday, & told them we would be there at 8. No problems there. When we show up & let her know we called she then informed us that 'your name only stays on the list for 20 minutes'. Would have been nice if the gal on the phone told us about that. So we waited about 15 minutes. When we go to order someone in my party wanted to leave off some things on his burger. And she got confused and started making jokes about what he wanted. Sorry but it's your job to accommodate guests, not pick on them. Food was mediocre. Kinda greasy. Bland. My pizza tasted like a mini 'pizza hut' pizza I could get for $5 at Target. Side sauces we got were really watered down. Didn't get drink refills. Asked for a cup of ice 3 times before it got to the table. Everyone seems frazzled and too busy to take care of you. Though she did give my sister a free pizookie because it was her birthday!"
Jeanne N.,"Tacoma, WA",29,19,8,2.0,8/12/2014,"Stopped into BJ's after the Mariners Game for a bite & a beverage. Put my hand down on the booth bench and a (small) shard of glass went into my finger!  OUCH!  They gave us a new booth, a bandaid & about half way through our eats, a manager came over & apologized & offered to pay for my meal.  I  was glad he did that because I was beginning to wonder WTF - - I mean, I was BLEEDING! I ordered an appetizer called Frito Nachos & it was pretty much what it sounds like: nachos made with Fritos. Too much cheese & too little Fritos & chili made about half of it too soupy to eat. But at that point it was free, so what the hey. I also had a scrumptious ""No Guilt Cosmo"" to drink that  was so good I wondered if they used the sugar ingredients instead of the sugar-free. It was good though & I didn't ask if it was really ""Guilt Free"" because we had other problems of a service nature by that time.  My son ordered a sandwich & asked to substitute a Ceasar salad for the house salad that came with it. The server said sure & a Ceasar salad arrived in short order. When they brought out his sandwich a while later, there sat a house salad along side it. The server apologized & said he was getting both salads.  Awesome, right? Not one to look a gift salad in the mouth, he asked for some honey mustard dressing to go with it.   In the mean time, my husband's sandwich arrived along with steak fries. He asked the server if she could bring him some tarter sauce for his fries when she brought out the dressing for our son.  So we dug in, more or less. Problem was neither the dressing or tarter sauce arrived. My husband, who was already annoyed about his wife being wounded by the shard of glass was not happy. The server finally stopped by to see how we were doing, and he reminded her about the missing condiments. She apologized and went to get them. We thought that was where she was going but it wasn't a quick trip.  By the time she came back, he had eaten a lot of the naked fries. She asked him if he would like more fries that would be ""warm"" to have with the tarter sauce (so she realized the fries were probably cold by this time) but he declined. He was, like I said, annoyed.  Not our best trip to BJ's. This location is probably off our go-to list for now, but we will still go to the Puyallup & Tacoma locations."
Kat L.,"Seattle, WA",133,365,537,3.0,4/30/2010,"I came here one night after shopping at soutcenter under reccomendations from freinds that their pazooki are the best thing I will ever eat in my life. What is a pazooki you ask.  It's bascially a cookie with ice cream on top (oreo, white choclate macadamion nut, peanut butter, double choclate, and oat meal rasin).  Pazooki's are yummy no doubt.  But they come in an easy bake oven pan and looks and tasted like somethign I cooked in my easy bake oven when I was a child, and for that I am not impressed.  (but do get the peanut butter yum lol) We also ordred a large pizza, half sweet pig (ham, pineapple, and tomato) and half buffo chicken (chicken, buffolu sauce, ranch, celery and other stuff).  The sweet pig was delecious, the buffilo chicken was not.  The chicken was dry, the cause didn't have much flavor on it, and was not alot. We also ordered a gourmet mac and cheese and spicnach artichoke dip.  The dip can kind of a sour ting to it and there were alot of burnt chips along with bottom of the bag chips, so it was very dissapointing.  Their cocktail What A Peach is delecious, if you're an alchol wimp like me you will LOVE it. All in all, I will be back if I am craving ice cream ontop of a cookie, but if I am at soutcenter and want pizza I will head to CPK."
Kelley M.,"Renton, WA",0,3,,2.0,11/9/2015,What a disapppintment! Ordered a combo lunch of soup & sandwich. Tomato bisque looked like something at an all-you-can-eat buffet that sat in the pot all day: greasy & over cooked. Exchanged for Tortilla soup which was like salt-lick. Way too salty! Sandwich was Cali club..& ok. Others in my party had similar disappointments with their orders being messed up or incomplete. Staff was helpful but the food was lacking.
Jon A.,"Auburn, WA",4,8,10,4.0,8/24/2012,"I was unfamiliar with this Restaurant chain until I visited the Southcenter location. Honestly, why aren't there more of these locally? Great menu and excellent tastes all-around. Their menu has a flash of comfort food mixed with select Italian entrees, gourmet burgers and a specialty dessert that has me looking at my car keys and planning my trip.  The bar area is a great place for men and women alike but because this BJ's is attached to Southcenter, it becomes a hideaway of sorts. Every devoted husband starts losing focus after our wives stare and tries on the same shoe for longer than 15 minutes. Honestly, just buy it and move on. Anyways, BJ's has its own brewed beers and flat screens which means we can escape the shopping madness, watch a couple games, try some seasonal beers and enjoy some appetizers. If we're lucky, the high percentage of alcohol in some of their specialty beers will soften the sting of our significant others shopping spree."
Chris L.,"Seattle, WA",104,62,126,2.0,2/11/2012,"Bj's is like Red Robin with better alcohol. It's the kind of place parents love because they can have a halfway decent meal (or a large number of cocktails) while their kiddos throw stuff and color (although I have two words for you, parents: kaiten sushi. Perseverance, too, although that's now three words. I trained the kiddo on good food early and now he requires crayon-pack-and-kids-menu fix only infrequently). The food? Meh. Notable was their inability to serve any food without dousing it in sugar, from the glaze on the steak to the syrupy chicken lettuce wrap filling. Steak was overly gristly and well under mid rare: better than overdone, but still, it's steak - it ain't that hard to not do wrong. Our server was helpful and tried to be attentive even though he was deep in the weeds. The runner that brought our plates never took any dirty ones away, leaving that to the already-overworked server.  If you are at Southcenter with kiddos and have already given up, go ahead and eat here. Everyone else - these are not the sliders you are looking for."
