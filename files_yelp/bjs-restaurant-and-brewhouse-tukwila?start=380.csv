Tom O.,"Renton, WA",37,20,5,4.0,8/21/2014,"I had the lunch BBQ plate. It had a pulled pork slider, BBQ chicken breast, potato wedges, and cole slaw. It was very good. BBQ sauce was tangy and the chicken was moist. Not bad."
Andrew K.,"Kirkland, WA",18,44,,1.0,6/17/2012,"My first 1-star review, if the prices were lower I would have maybe given a 2-star review but the food was just plain awful, service was ok. Now I know how Gordon Ramsey feels during episodes of Kitchen Nightmare, we may see BJ's there soon enough. I've actually been here a couple of times when they first opened and remember the food was at the level of Cheesecake factory and they do have yummy sodas like the Orange Twist, etc. However, came here yesterday to celebrate Father's Day with my parents, and boy was it just plain awful. The Food: Full Rack of Ribs with Salad & Baked Potato  - The ribs were so dry and not well cooked that I could barely cut the ribs with a  steak knife. Asked for some BBQ sauce but the taste was too off, also way too salty. Basic salad with some croutons (Like what you would get from a salad kit from Safeway) and just got a regular baked potato, no butter, etc. Turkey Club with Thin Fries It was like eating a salt-lick, nuff said... Medium Sweet Pig Pizza: This was the worst of the worst, even way below the standards of Pizza Hut or Dominoes. It was essentially 98% dough, 2% cheese and toppings. There were barely any toppings for a $20 pizza, some small dobs of tomato sauce, very thinly sliced pieces of ham and bits of pineapple. It was like eating a very oily, greasy piece of bread, just plain horrible. The Service: They were not busy but a bit too slow, waited 15 minutes to get BBQ sauce for my dry ribs. we only got one re-fill. Still left a 15% tip because it will be the last cent BJ's will ever get from me. Overall, they need to remove the restaurant out of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse... And no, we didn't complain to management, we just had a lot of left-overs. I'll leave the yelling to Gordon Ramsey. + I remember them being quite busy when they first opened, but now you don't need to call ahead anymore to get a table + Come here for the nice sodas - Horrible Food - Slow Service Tip: STAY AWAY! Cheese Cake Factory is a much better alternative."
Ron B.,"Seattle, WA",12,35,3,2.0,6/23/2014,"The pizza was good and the pazooki dessert was excellent. The service:  horrible.  Had to ask for napkins,  utensils, plates,  had to order appetizer twice. Ordered fish tacos and got one fish and one shrmp.  Fish taco not good,  shrimp was good. 2nd time I've been here,  food and beer have been okay,  service bad both times"
Wayne M.,"Seattle, WA",110,120,3,1.0,3/23/2014,"I've had the best experiences at there restaurants until today. Spent an hour waiting on our food. When it finally comes, obviously he forgot about us because everyone after us got there food. Mine was cold and the order was completely wrong.  He said he will fix it. But an extra 15 minutes go by and nothing. So I paid and walked off. Totally unsatisfied.  Will never return again"
Anthony Z.,"Olympia, WA",0,8,4,4.0,8/11/2013,"So I came across this place when I decided to stop for dinner before dropping a friend off at the Airport.  I order the classic burger and it was extremely delicious, the staff was really friendly and went above and beyond to take care of me and my friend.  I then decided to go back the next day since it was my birthday and needed something to do.  I ordered the Balsamic chicken glazed and it was out of this world, it was presented beautifully and the service was quick.  The negatives about this place I would say is the cluttered parking outside as well as being really noisy inside but above all else I would recommend this place to anyone."
Laura C.,"Auburn, WA",0,3,,4.0,11/20/2015,"We were there a few weeks ago and I sent my steak back to be cooked a bit more.  Nothing wrong with it, I just wanted it a bit more done.  The manager came to our table to apologize and comped my meal.  I wasn't upset about it, but he insisted.  I made sure he knew it was in no way the waitress's fault, or the kitchen staff - medium well is a little vague!   We've never had a bad meal here, but this is the kind of customer service all restaurants should have.  (The only reason it's not five stars is the music is insanely loud.)"
Lindsey S.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,2,5.0,9/14/2014,"Bjs always delivers. We came in really hungry, planning on ordering a lot anyways. We decided on a medium pizza and a salad to start. Our waitress, Nicolletta, informed us on the two for $22 deal! This definitely won us over. A great deal! Two salads, a medium pizza, and a pizookie to top it off!! It was the perfect deal for us!! Anyways Nicolletta was awesome and was the perfect amount of catering to us and letting us be. Really great service."
Josh G.,"Olympia, WA",17,89,45,2.0,10/21/2012,"Having watched kitchen nightmares for some time now, and I think we all know what excessively large menus mean. When you try to appeal to everyone and the kitchen sink your food quality is going to go down. This doesn't seem to affect large chain restaurants as much as smaller mom and pop places, but I still think it has some effect on this place. As for my food, I ordered a jalapeno burger, and aside from the unusually vast amounts of red onions it was pretty good, and the prices are pretty much that of red robin. If you get fries, make sure they're the crispy thin ones! In regards to the service, not impressed at all with the waiter that handled our table. The only time I ever saw him was when he took our orders, and walked by to drop off the bill. Our appetizers, and dinner all was dropped off by a different waitress who never even asked if we needed anything else. How thoughtful..."
Dena R.,"Renton, WA",189,196,2,4.0,4/17/2014,Open space and natural light.  Friendly staff.  Nice salad options.  Great place to meet friends.
Yuka S.,"First Hill, Seattle, WA",34,16,14,1.0,1/18/2015,"The service was horrible. Food was also horrible. We ordered the California chicken club, and the Parmesan crusted chicken. The sandwich was soggy, the fries were cold and chewy, and the Parmesan crusted chicken was way too oily and had too much butter flavor. Our server didn't come often when we wanted to order so I gave up ordering my drink. When they served the food, they brought the wrong food first and didn't even bring forks and knives. I could even tell the sandwich was sitting in the kitchen for a while. When I tried to ask for something, he didn't even stop - so rude. For the quality of food and service, I think they are over charging. Moreover, the floor was slippery and the bathroom was really dirty too. We will never go back there again."
D B.,"Veradale, WA",0,8,,1.0,5/25/2016,"if this is a brew house, why did the waiter never ask if I wanted another beer (which I did)?  flat bread was soggy upon arrival and was told ""that's the way ours is."" sent it back.  not good, food and service."
Anne D.,"Seattle, WA",77,512,930,4.0,10/24/2010,"Best sliders in town hands down! They make them so perfect. I tell ya, I was not disappointed.  I've been here for happy hour. I came here with a fam member. We had a friendly and helpful server. I don't know French. So when I saw ""Framboise"" on the menu I wasn't sure how to pronounce it. In my head I wanted to say ""FRAM-boise"" like Boise, ID. I was incorrect. She said it was ""FRAM-bwaah"". She was all smiles and she made great food recommendations.  Another perk about happy hour is that if you can't finish your food, they give you a to-go box. Some restaurants, like McCormicks, won't let you take your happy hour food home."
Tony T.,"Woodland Hills, CA",156,226,203,2.0,9/19/2012,"Maybe I'm biased because I live in Los Angeles and I always go to the BJ's out there, but this one was just Meh...alright.  Nothing special, nothing I would look forward to returning to and in no way will I be back.  I ordered the half baked potato with grilled chicken and the Cesar salad combo.  It was just okay.  The potato was not cooked well, it wasn't hot from the oven, it felt like it had been sitting around the backroom waiting for some unsuspecting soul like me to order it and take it out of its misery.   I would say go at your own risk"
Jeff F.,"Seattle, WA",12,214,104,4.0,1/7/2010,"American Food & Beer.  For your fatties. I've been here a couple times, and have been satisfied with the food & beer. THE FOOD = TASTY * I was surprised how tasty the Shrimp Wraps and Tuscan Tomato were.   * BJ's Angus burger was good, but not on the same level as Red Robin a few blocks away. * The Deep Dish Mediterranean Pizza (Grilled chicken, basil pesto, roasted garlic, Kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and sliced peperoncinis.) is great, and a great option for those who aren't in the mood for the typical pepperoni/supreme thing. * The Pizookie, rich soft cookie + rich ice cream paired perfectly together, is a must have.  I tagged an extra star for the Pizookie.... THE BEER = DECENT * I have never had an amber or blonde that I didn't like...  BJ's brews are good, I've tried their amber, blonde, and brown ale; and all were delicious. CUSTOMER SERVICE = HIT & MISS * Some were attentive, some not...   ENVIRONMENT = SPORTS BAR * Good for large & loud parties. LOCAL COMPETITION * The Ram is the only other local chain that competes with BJ's.  Both have beer, American food, and sports TV.  BJ's has good pizza, I don't think The Ram currently has any pizza. BTW: There are currently ""Party for 2 for $20"" coupons available at their web site.  Those have also been sent out with the bunches of ads we typically get in snail mail."
Burre C.,"Tacoma, WA",310,14,15,4.0,12/18/2012,Mini tacos amazing. Mini pizzas just as good. Happy hour is till 7
Toni D.,"Orlando, FL",607,534,615,4.0,9/18/2011,"Great date place. Or place to hang out and watch sports games. Food is pretty good too. I tried the marinated chicken breasts coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli, and topped with a lemon Chardonnay butter sauce.  Which was so good! I wished I had taken a look at the dessert menu. The warm cookies with the scoop of icecream look delicious!"
Guy M.,"Everett, WA",12,5,,1.0,3/2/2014,Food was bland.. store was way too big. Our food came out burnt.  we were comped one meal. I also saw the manager comp at least 3 other checks.. loved the Bjs in Newport and Vegas. But AVOID THIS ONE.
Steve D.,"Vancouver, WA",3,31,6,5.0,9/27/2014,"BJ's never disappoints. Another excellent meal at the chain of restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and it was delicious! I tried their seasonal octoberfest lager and it was amazing. Light copper color, malty sweet up front then finished dry with slight hop bitterness. A must try while it's available."
Sam M.,"Renton, WA",1,61,,3.0,8/17/2014,"This is an updated to my last review.  I met a friend for dinner tonight and like my visit on July 7 I asked for a table outside for two.  Like the last time I was told they couldn't seat us because they were expecting a large group of 16. I brought up the fact they told me the last time I ate there and there were no large groups and I told them I saw a lot of empty tables. We were eventually seated and I really don't know what the issue in seating us was considering all the tables along the wall were empty and to me it looked like there still was plenty of seating. Unfortunately, the group of 16 was seated in the tables next to me and my friend.  I can only describe them as very loud and obnoxious women who must not have ever eaten in a restaurant or their parents didn't have the common sense to teach them how to act in a restaurant as well as dress appropriately.  They shouted to each other and everything they saw like a ""OH WOW"".  They were so loud my friend and I had a hard time talking.   In all my visits to BJs, the one thing I have found irritating is that the server never asks if we'd like anything else before they bring our check.  We always get our check when we plan on ordering more food, dessert or another drink.  My friends and I have  yet to come out with only one check.  Usually multiple checks.  One time my friend came out with at least nine checks because each time she ordered something, the server would close out her check.  I usually come out with two and one time I came out with three."
Susan A.,"Bonney Lake, WA",21,49,16,4.0,9/7/2014,"Our server, Jonathan D. gave us excellent service.  He was helpful with encouraging us to sign up online while we were here (for Te rewards program) so we could take advantage of receiving our free pizookie during this visit.  We ordered the 14"" pizza with 5 cheese, chicken and mushrooms.  It was a little dry.  The peanut butter pizookie was very good.  We will definitely be back!"
