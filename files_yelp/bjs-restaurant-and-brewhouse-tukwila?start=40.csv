Cameron C.,"Carrollton, VA",41,69,,4.0,9/11/2017,"I had the Crisp Jalapeno Burger with a turkey which was very good. The waitress was very helpful and nice. The pricing was also good. Overall would go again, they have a great selection at decent prices."
Frank S.,"Houston, TX",1,198,162,3.0,6/9/2017,"Enjoyed a quick lunch.  Had the chicken wings and a house salad.  I tried the root beer sauce and it was good. I ordered it on the side along with buffalo sauce.  My server was Christina. She was decent but not outstanding.  She didn't really know that there was chocolate inside of the caramel cookie for dessert, neither was she familiar with the type of ice cream they serve. I think that all servers should taste the food where they work and become very knowledgeable of the menu. After all, it's their profession.  I'll return because I kind of like the place."
S M.,"Seattle, WA",0,260,,2.0,10/4/2017,"Its a chain so what do you expect? The beer selection is good and the food solidly mediocre, but what shocked and annoyed me is the fact that the bartender would not let me order two drinks without the other person present claiming it to be a ""State Law"" (which it may be in Utah) so I couldn't order a beer and a wine, but I could order a beer and a shot...Completely asinine, and the only establishment I have ever been to in Seattle to make such a claim."
Eva D.,"Seattle, WA",52,3,1,2.0,3/15/2017,"I placed an order through ROTR and then called BJ's the day of at around 10:30 am to clarify what types of serving dishes I might need so that I could prepare for the delivery. The manager i spoke with was very friendly and helpful with the information I needed. When I hung up the phone I told my coworker that I could not wait to do a Yelp review of them becauseof his friendliness and because I love BJ's. Sadly that is not how this is review is going to go... My order was to be delivered between 11:15 - 11:30 and at exactly 11:23 am I recieved a call from ROTR that my order was going to be late because the restauarant was backed up and they were running behind. Strange, because they open at 11 and when I spoke with the manager at 10:30, he mentioned nothing about them being behind, he said they were working on my order.... So what happened???  The portions were inconsistant, salmon was WAY over cooked and the vegetables were dry and blah looking. Overall an incredibly lackluster experience which impacts me because the order was placed for a professional meeting and needed professional execution which I was unable to provide because of BJ's service perfomance.  Upon delivery we learned that BJ's has a strong reputation for running late with catering orders.  We will not be using them again."
Kathy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",64,157,446,5.0,8/16/2016,"I never give 5 stars, but thanks to Manuel and his great service and smile as well as the bomb azz avocado rolls, well deserved. ""Insert clapping hands emoji here"". Had to take a trip out to Seattle for few appointments and I was craving avocado. Last time I was at BJ's back home in L.A I was pretty drunk as it was my cousins suggestion due to lakers game and was well worth it and I've been craving the rolls. Price is higher in Washington state probably due to the prices of the veggies and fruit $11.95 but still the same good taste! When I'm back in this area I'll be sure to stop by again and thank you again Manuel For your great hospitality and suggestion for the mushroom caps!"
Ana M.,"Kent, WA",139,99,42,5.0,10/28/2016,"I forgot our servers name, but he had dark hair and blue eyes and was very friendly. He was a bit slow with the service but I think he had the whole section to himself so it was understandable. I ordered the jambalaya. It was off the charts delicious. The shrimp and sausage and spicy taste was delicious and I would recommend that dish to anyone who likes authentic New Orleans jambalaya. My boyfriend ordered a BBQ burger with bacon and he said it was delicious. My favorite part about his dish was the thin cut fries. The decor was tasteful and the bathrooms were clean. Some people, like the lady who dropped our food off, seemed as if she didn't want to be there, but hey everybody has bad days. We will definitely be back!"
Dustin A.,"Bothell, WA",3,26,22,2.0,3/26/2017,"To start out, the food tasted fine. Holy Jesus our service was a struggle. To the waiters credit I think he was trying but he misfired a few times. Table of 6 and we just ordered entrees and some drinks. We got 3 of the 6 entrees within decent time for how busy the place was but one of the entrees (mine) was wrong. Honest mistake because the waiter got the wrong button, I was told 15min tops for the correction. Half hour went by and nothing until the waiter brought me a salad and soup on the house. Great idea but then took an extra 15 minutes to get dressing for the salad and had to be asked twice. They struggled hard tonight but the food matches the price. I think they could have done a bit more on the bill for us though."
Jamal F.,"Seattle, WA",3,3,,2.0,6/11/2017,"After visiting this location 2 previous times, and receiving mediocre food and service, I was enticed back by a gift card I was given. I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya, including under-seasoned rice and cold shrimp, while my girlfriend ordered the difficult to handle, extra greasy, Swiss Portobello burger.  The service we received took about 20 minutes to ask us for drinks after we sat down, and we finished our meal and waited for the check for about 30 minutes while there wasn't a waiter in sight for us to flag down in this not-particularly-crowded restaurant. The food wasn't terrible, the service wasn't terrible, but all in all it was not an enjoyable experience and I don't think I will be returning anytime soon."
Bri J.,"Federal Way, WA",66,142,18,3.0,10/8/2016,"Average experience at a pub style restaurant. I ordered the siraracha chicken bacon mac and cheese. It was yummy, and the siraracha was a nice kick to the mac and cheese. Portion was plentiful enough for good leftovers.  Our server was clever and kind, where she came by and dropped a hint of Pizookie to keep us thinking about it, even though we didn't order it.  I'd definitely go back and try more, as they have quite a menu of options."
Michael E.,"Albuquerque, NM",5,23,12,1.0,12/7/2017,"Waitress was awesome but did not follow through, ordered appetizers and got with food and was cold, yes we got them for free, but thats not what we wanted, we flew in and on plane for 5 hrs..and picked this place.. BJ's not good my friends at least not today.. sorry guys"
Aisha A.,"Concord, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/20/2017,"We came to BJ's around 3:30 or 4:00. We ordered our food at 4:30. The service was absolutely slow & terrible. We waited for our food for up to an hour& some of us had to wait longer. We had kids & they were complaining about how hungry they were. WE SPENT 4 HOURS!!!! One of my family members complained & the manger was very loud & immature. She made excuses & she kept screaming ""what do you want me to do?"". She said the services was slow cause of football, but we came an hour before football. She kept making excuses. As a manger you are suppose to be professional & own up to your mistake & apology to the customer. The customer is always right. I love BJ's but this is the worst BJ's ever. I recommend BJ's but not this one."
Amy T.,"Maple Valley, WA",55,5,1,1.0,9/11/2017,"Server couldn't get anything right. From one of our pizzas coming 20 minutes after the table was done eating (that was compensated) to the wrong size of desserts that took 20 minutes to prepare. We have been here for 2 hours, mostly waiting for so-so food. Won't be back to this one."
Manny A.,"Seattle, WA",56,7,1,2.0,9/16/2017,"Let me say that this restaurant isn't what it used to be. The food may be alright and the pizookies will always be amazingly delicious but the quality of service has definitely gone down hill. Last time I went I was there for the Tuesday special on their pizookies and I ended waiting almost an hour for only one. Within that time I could've gone to the store and bought some cookie dough and some ice cream, made homemade pizookies, drive back to the restaurant and still have remaining wait time for the pizookies I originally ordered. Luckily, the waiter was nice enough to apologize for the wait and out the drinks in the house but you would expect that on a weekday, service would be faster as opposed to the weekend dinner rush."
Anna S.,"Medford, OR",138,12,9,4.0,8/14/2016,"This an honest review with respect to the waiter. We ordered appetizers and beer samplers. We came in and our waiter was very friendly, then his mood seemed to changed and we thought we had upset him. After 10 mins or so, he came back to make sure we were fine. He did his job, we just hoped he could have been more attentive and outgoing.  Food: The Avocado Egg Rolls were very good, especially with the sweet sauce. We also ordered Flat Bread Nachos, they were ok, not the best. Better nachos can be made at home. They needed a side salsa or sauce to add more flavor and spice. The ambiance and decor was nice. A great place to dine at with friends and family. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and had a good time at BJ'S."
Josie L.,"Tacoma, WA",96,2,,1.0,8/5/2017,"Normally I am a huge fan of BJs. But tonight I had the worst service of my life. Came here with my sister around 9/10 pm after she got off work. First, my meal came out at the same time as our appetizer. So after finishing the appetizer, my meal was cold so I only ate half of it. No one asked how my meal was. Then, my sisters meal was soggy. We had to ask for them to refill our waters more than once. Then, our bill was messed up twice so they had to fix it. After I gave them my card, they said it was scratched so it wouldn't work. I didn't have another form of payment, so I asked the manager if he could just type in the card numbers in the computer. He said he normally could but because of the type of card I had it could be fraudulent. So my sister had to pay for my meal. Not sure what he would have done if I was on my own and that was my only form of payment?? Then we waited 45 minutes for my sisters dessert to come out, and had to ask twice if it was still coming. All that being said, I still am a fan of BJs, but will not be coming to this location ever again. I should add that our waitress was very nice and the majority of what happened had nothing to do with her."
Jim B.,"Renton, WA",93,175,89,4.0,1/16/2017,Had a nice experience here today with my 12 year old chicken wing enthusiast.  Very friendly staff all around.  I go to a lot of restaurants and clearly BJ's has a corporate focus on customer service.  Many people stopped by our table including the General Manager to make sure everything was OK.  Pretty impressive.  I got a mini one topping pizza and side salad lunch combo that was just right for me.  The pizza was small but it was deep dish so it did the trick.  Pretty standard pizza though.  Had to go with bacon for my one topping.  My kid got the calamari and the hottest wings they make and she reported a thumbs up to me on both.  I like TV's and there's a lot of them in this place.  This is for sure a sports themed bar/restaurant so I imagine it would be fun to watch a game here.
Richard M.,"Auburn, WA",1,26,8,1.0,9/1/2017,"Called in my To Go order over an hour in advance. Arrived at the appointed time only to be ignored for 10+ minutes. Went to the bar to ask for help and waited 5+ more minutes. To my shock, my order wasn't ready and if fact they seemed confused. First and last time here. As I write this review, I'm now 25 minutes and counting and still no food."
Martin L.,"Olympia, WA",0,6,,5.0,2/3/2017,"When we arrived my wife was a little hypo-glycemic, the entry staff got her seated and brought her an orange juice. The quality of service from then on did not flag.  I felt they looked after us well, very well, and the food was of good to high quality."
Rhi S.,"Seattle, WA",410,255,672,4.0,11/11/2015,"We came around 4:30-4:45ish today (Wednesday) and were seated right away. Service was pretty on point this evening. We were greeted and our orders were taken right away. Our appetizers too less than 10 min to come out and our food less than 15. I had the bacon guac burger and my boyfriend had the bbq pulled pork sandwich. I thought my food was delicious until I tried his.. I looooved his sandwich! They checked in on us, brought us water and overall gave us good service. We each got a mini pazookie*. It's been a long time since I've had one and turns out I didn't really like it. The outside is cooked but it's completely uncooked inside. I figure it's supposed to be like that but just wasn't for my taste. Plus, at this point I had to drink water after every couple bites and my glass ended up empty and for the first time in the evening no one walking by would notice until our waiter finally came back and we asked him. Everything else I ate tonight was delicious though!"
Anna T.,"Seattle, WA",206,87,78,5.0,6/2/2017,"It's rare for me to give 5 stars to large food chain restaurants because it's hard for me to ever get good service or good quality food. But when I came here for some food during the NBA finals, I had a amazing experience. I didn't have any expectations at all because it's not like this is my first time here. However, our waiter Andre made all the difference. He was kind, friendly, quick and prompt. I've never had a waiter check on me so many times in a restaurant like this. We got everything we wanted and asked for. He always made sure that we did.  There was also a different waitress that was helping a huge table next to us and see seemed very fun and enthusiastic. So I would give service a thumbs up!  Each day (or most days of the week) they have specials. We came on a Thursday and the special was half a slab of ribs, 2 sides, 1 salad, and 1 smal pizookie for only about 14 dollars!!! That's a lot of food for 14 dollars man! I also got the late night burger and it was huge and filling.  Everything we had was hitting the spot."
