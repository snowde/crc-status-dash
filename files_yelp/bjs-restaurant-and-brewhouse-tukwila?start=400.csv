Tom C.,"South San Francisco, CA",44,514,30,4.0,8/20/2012,"Another California restaurant that made it's way to WA - Yay!!! Good food, good atmosphere and pretty decent prices. The BBQ beef sandwich is awesome, probably my favorite. I don't care for their pizza much, but the pazookie dessert makes up for it!!"
Isabelle S.,"Seattle, WA",0,8,,1.0,6/22/2014,"Been here numerous times. The food is always pretty good, but even that can't make up for the terrible service. The waiters/waitresses always seem so disinterested and rude. Once I had one of the waitresses complain to me about not leaving her a tip. I was actually planning on leaving one until she made that comment. So unprofessional. If I ever find myself wanting Bj's, I'll order to go."
Alicia B.,"Tacoma, WA",38,17,9,5.0,5/26/2014,Love this location! The food is delicious and the staff is always so nice. Just had my birthday dinner here and our waitress Janine H was a sweetheart! She was super polite! We will definitely return!
Shirley C.,"Seattle, WA",19,100,,1.0,8/23/2011,"I'm actually a huge fan of this restaurant. I usually don't get a bad order or bad hostess. But some reason, I did last Friday. The boyfriend & I decided to eat here for dinner on a casual Friday night. When we arrived, the hostess wasn't as friendly as she could have been, but we didn't think anything of it. She seated us outside next to a huge birthday party table. We requested to be seated inside away from the birthday party. She got passive-aggressive on me and told me it would be no different if I sat inside because there was a birthday party. Yes, one birthday party inside the restaurant with plenty of empty seating compared to the compact space outside with a birthday party.  Anyhow, she moved us directly right next to the party. I was extremely upset and pissed off that she completely ignored my prior request of why I didn't want to sit outside in the first place.  Of course I am going to be asked to be moved again. She raised her voice and told me that it would be several minutes. I said, ""sure"" even though I saw plenty of open booths and nobody was waiting for a table. Also, she made the boyfriend & i carry our own drinks and menus to the booth. She made me feel extremely uncomfortable to eat here. She would walk by several times to sneer at us. At the end of the night, she would purposely ignore us as we walked out. Talk about customer service? As much as I was a fan of BJ's, I don't think I will be coming back at all. Until they teach their workers what customer service is!"
Emmalee S.,"Kennewick, WA",25,85,,5.0,9/10/2011,"I don't think I have ever had a better waiter at any restaurant. Ever.  Being new to town, we hadn't ventured out much. My best friend saw we had a BJ's and insisted on taking us out for food and drinks. I was nervous because at first glance, this place looks a little on the spendy side (but it's not too bad...about $9 for a burger and fries). Our waiter was prompt and extremely nice. He helped us pick our drinks and told us what was good to eat (we got bbq pizza and the sample appetizer... both very good and filled all 3 of us). Ok, you are probably thinking ""Well that's pretty normal"". The drink help was great and he did suggest some great food but he also directed us to a bar to go to after we ate and got the score of the football game for my man."
Ava S.,"Bothell, WA",9,31,,1.0,4/23/2012,"I ordered a small pizza for myself and man, was it ever gross!! They added meat to it, which I didn't ask for, the sauce was cold and only on about 1/3 of the pizza, and there was basically no cheese. My pizza was disgusting. I didn't even finish it. Just pushed it aside.  The only reason I give them one star and not 0 is because my husband said he liked his food alright. He ordered chicken fried steak. I started to eat his veggies, then stopped because they were quite literally dripping in butter. GROSS. I say this place is nasty nast. Me thinks no next time."
Todd S.,"Richland, WA",0,3,1,1.0,8/21/2014,"We went there hungry after a day of travel across the state. And at first it seemed like a great idea. Mostly because it was food and it had a wide selection, and somewhat of a Gluten free menu. We were seated and the waitresses introduced herself, and took our drink orders and we got our drinks perfectly fine, and all was well until these two business men came and sat across the isle. The waitress came and took our order then stood and FLIRTED with these two people across the isle. To put this into perspective the NBA finals game was going on and we were seated at the start of the game. And by the time we got our food the third quarter was almost over. It was terrible. By the time we actually got our food we weren't anymore. And after the wait the manager came and apologized about the wait! The food was good. But it live up to its name and was a Blow Job.."
Blake S.,"Champaign, IL",11,12,8,4.0,5/11/2014,"The wife and I stopped by here while shopping and we were pleasantly surprised. The beer selection was pretty great (all their own brews) and the menu was impressive. We left happy and with our thirst quenched and our waiter was fantastic. My only issue was time, it seemed to take FOREVER!"
Kayla H.,"Seattle, WA",201,767,129,4.0,9/21/2011,My grandma and I had lunch here yesterday. It was a nice day so we sat on the patio.  We eat had the blonde beer which was good. I like their beers. We ordered a medium Mediterranean deep dish pizza and it was really good!!  We were too full for dessert but I HIGHLY recommend the pizookies. They are the BOMB!
Ariel L.,"Seattle, WA",2,13,1,2.0,7/3/2015,"Food & service here used to be good. Now they changed the Cajun Pasta recipe. Too watery & only small chunks of chicken instead of strips like it used to be. Also no bread. But I think price went up actually. Wth? ANNNNNNNND I'm sorry but these waitresses that work here need to stop flirting & standing around. Have waited for the longest just to pay and leave. Almost 30mins & then another time was almost another 30mins for 2 desserts. Second time the waitress already gave us our bills, she was fine & attentive at first until we paid & tipped $10 then disappeared after we ordered our desserts. Both times, it was not busy at all. Also hate when they come & gives us our checks WHILE we're still eating or removing plates off our tables while we're still talking. That's fine because I know some people don't like dirty plates in front of them but I'm one of those people who hate when people cross over me while I'm still talking. Like it can wait. I don't mind plates there. It's just rude that you're reaching over me. Hate that! Don't think I'll be coming here anymore. At least not tipping these desperate for attention waitresses"
Margarita M.,"Houston, TX",0,22,1,5.0,5/27/2015,"Friendly staff.  Quick sitting.  Immediate service.  My water glass was filled several times and without my needing to ask.  They were playing the basketball game we wanted to see.  The good was delicious, too."
Jeff H.,"Bellevue, WA",545,1238,136,3.0,4/12/2010,"I created my own pizza and the result was tasty! The menu is HUGE so even if there's a picky eater in your crew, they will have no problem finding tasty eats here. I feel BJ's has four star quality food, especially for the area, and is a good value for your money, but I have to dock them a star for speed of service.  MULTIPLE servers walked by our booth before someone finally asked if we'd been helped after sitting there for 15 minutes.  It's a shame the service was so passive and unaware, because I really like the decor and vibe of the place. They had multiple sporting events going, and I got the impression it would be a lively place to watch a game."
Jenny K.,"Bellevue, WA",716,684,363,3.0,11/10/2011,"I have been going to BJ's forever. There were lots of them in So Cal where I grew up, and I have fond memories of getting their pazookie dessert. When they recently built locations in Tacoma and Tukwila, I went many times for dinner in small and large groups. Most recently I went earlier this week to grab beers with a friend. We got the pumpkin ale and it's one of the best beers I've ever had. Right amount of pumpkin spices and hops. After our first beers, we decided to order the nachos.  What I noticed when I ate them was a trend that I no longer like how their food tastes. In the last couple years I've had sandwiches, tacos, pizzas and now nachos. Everything tastes mediocre and nauseating. Nothing seems fresh or original, just greasy, greasy, greasy! The nachos sounded like they would be delicious, per the description: piranha ale chili, sour cream, green onions, cheese, salsa, jalapenos, etc. But you couldn't really taste the chili because it was buried under too many SALTY chips and greasy cheese. We realized halfway through that there was no sour cream on them, which would've made a difference. The salsa though was phenomenal and was our favorite part of the nachos. On this night, we had a server who was AWESOME. Friendly, appeared when we needed her and gave us plenty of time to chat and hang out without making us feel pressure to order anything or leave. I will be back for more pumpkin ale soon, but will stay away from the nachos. The pizzas there are your best bet, by far."
Yee V.,"Seattle, WA",84,121,45,3.0,5/17/2010,"I don't get to dine here often because when I come, they tell me it's going to be a 30 minute wait.... well, last night we decided to wait. Seemed like forever, but we got seated.. Our buzzer didn't go off, but the hostess announced over the intercom that our table of 5 was ready to be seated. We actually got a table before a family that came in before us? hmmmm... no biggie, they actually ended up sitting behind us and actually got their food first...  My first experience of BJ's was in Nor Cal, we stopped by BJ's at like 10 or 11 at night after driving two hours from a car show in the Bay Area. I placed third, it was definitely time to celebrate!! HAHA! JK Well, my friends here decided we should have some late night dinner because we don't get to see each other often. Done deal, we're at BJ's. I don't remember what I ate or how it tasted because I was so tired. But I didn't have anything to complain about. They seated us quickly and got us served. It was pretty empty however. Last night's experience was a bit different. We waited about 25 minutes or so for our table and then probably another 25 to get our food. During our wait for the table, I walked inside to use the bathroom. I noticed a few tables that were not seated, awkward? Why not just seat us in them? Well, I noticed a very large party dining inside as well, probably about 20 people. I'm assuming, they didn't seat us because they wanted this table to get their food first. No biggie. We ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and Grilled chicken pasta. I'd say I like the Parmesan crusted chicken more than the pasta. The pasta came a little dry, but our waiter easily got us some extra white sauce when we asked!! Very nice and helped to gobble the pasta down.  The restaurant is nice. Ambiance is mellow. I guess it has a sports bar style to it, though I didn't notice it at first. I'd come back again possibly, though I wouldn't be the one to suggest it."
Trisha M.,"Carson, CA",73,8,,2.0,1/31/2014,"Great food. Great drinks. I'd give another star, but the service from our server Mark M.  was just not there. We saw him for our drink order, food order, and for the check. Couldn't flag him down for a drink refill, beer refill, or for more marinara sauce. I get it, he was probably anxious and anticipatory regarding his tip from the table of 12 he was serving. But, regardless of the number of people in the table you're serving, customer service should not lack, nor should you disregard the smaller table of two in your section."
Vida H.,"Seattle, WA",5,23,2,4.0,9/19/2012,"I really like the steak salad here. I'm hooked. The drinks are ok, I like to order the TOP SHELF margarita, its good but even better depending on the bartender.  I had my birthday party here a couple of years ago. They served all the pizza I wanted all night for about $500. They were friendly and made that night enjoyable. Since...they are under new owners or management, I referred a friend for her party and it wasnt as enjoyable due to the staff. So I'm not sure if I would have another party but I'll be back for the steak salad."
Mimi W.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,16,1.0,5/12/2015,"If I can give no stars I would but since I have to give one to write review they get it.... Now This isnt My First Time Here Having A Problem with bad Customer Service... My 1st Time Here I Waited Over 20 Minutes To Be Seated While People That Came After Me We're Helped The Hosts Pretty Much Acted Like I Was Not Sitting There I Asked For A Manager Questioning Why Is It That Everyone That Came After Me Was Seated But I Was Put On Hold For Over 20min.(highly upset cause I was on my lunch break) She apologized gave me a booth had a server came and took my order *the burger was good* the waiter at the time was great* comped my lunch but still paid the amount of burger as tip to the waiter... I don't like to get racial but that's what the case was, every Caucasian that walked through those doors were seated but I sat there long enough for my lunch to be over. I came in yesterday for lunch with my husband and service was good waitress and hosts on point maybe cause they just oped and no one was really in there. We decided to come back today for some burgers during happy hour we got there at approximately 3:03pm ordered two burgers on with no onions and the other with no pickles (I'm allergic to pickles) & husband can't do onions of corse the waiter *E.J.* in a rush to go home puts in the order wrong and the waitress *Britney* brings out my burger with pickles and my husband's with a nice amount of onions smh we tell her the orders were wrong instead of having the cook make new burgers she brings the same burger that had pickles in it back 1min later smh. I could of did that my self but with me having allergies I needed them to make a new one. Ugh so frustrating all in all the manager come out apologizes and comps the food THEY FAIL TO REALIZE NO ONE NEEDS A COMP JUST NEED THE FOOD DONE RIGHT AND IN A TIMELY MATTER cause now it's 4:25pm and we re running late for an appointment witch could of been avoided if they had it right from the start"
Brent C.,"Chehalis, WA",94,72,5,3.0,10/26/2011,"First off, a great place to probably watch a game as long as you don't want to hear the commentators.  Good size menu, but I do think the menu either looks bigger on-line than in person.  A nice thing is that the nutritional facts in the back of the menu though. The bacon cheeseburger was good but nothing special really.  The bun was different and pretty good, the meat was decent but kind of flavorless and the wasn't as crispy as I was hoping.  But the veggies were fresh and everything was warm a gooey like it should.  the wedge fries were good too. The personal pizzas look good too however they are a little on the small side.   Overall the food looked pretty good and the brews that I tried were great.  They make a pretty good seasonal pumpkin ale if you are into that sort of thing. The prices were a little on the high side for a TGI McFunsters but the food was decent and the atmosphere was good.  Service was a spotty and kind of slow though."
Paul C.,"Seattle, WA",218,184,13,1.0,5/12/2011,"This is going to be a long review, so bear with me. WORST service ever. It must be this location because I've been to other BJ's where the service has been great. Not here. :( First off, when I went it wasn't crowded and pretty empty, yet it took the host 5 minutes to seat us. It's not that hard. Look for an empty section that doesn't overwhelm the staff and seat us. Strike one. Next, my friends and I wait for about 10m for the waitress to arrive for drink orders. Mind you, by that time, we're all ready to order. We place our food and drink orders and the waitress leaves and doesn't come back with drinks for another 10 minutes. My friend had a very flat and unsweet soda. Tasted like Perrier. Took forever to get any attention from the waitress or staff. While we're waiting, we see the booth in front of us has the manager talking to them because the waitress fouled up their order big time. A sign of things to come?? Strike two. I also noticed the group who sat before us, had their food out come fairly quick so I was expecting the same. Not a chance. They had 6 people in their party and we had 3. It took about 30 minutes for our food to come out. The food was good, but the horrible service made us want to scarf the food down and leave, never to return. Strike three. I can understand if the restaurant is at full capacity, but the waitress only had about 3 tables to wait on. If anything, she should do a round every once in a while to check up on things. She only did once and that was towards the end of our meal. Also, it took forever for us to get the check and when it was time to pay, my friend had to walk into the kitchen to look for the waitress to deliver the card. Strike four? lol This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in any restaurant. What should have been a 30-45 minute affair, took us nearly two hours. Suffice to say, I will never be coming back here."
Laurie S.,"Kent, WA",27,259,19,4.0,6/1/2012,"Pretty good place to grab a beer, watch some sports and have a pizza.  Laid back.  Decent prices.  The beer is brewed by them and is very tasty.  They have a beer for every taste just about.  I've had everything from their pizza to their pasta to their stuffed baked potatoes.  Come hungry! My husband & I had our rehearsal dinner here a few years back. Very reasonably priced and everyone had a great time. If you go...save room for the pizookie. Trust me. It's well worth it."
