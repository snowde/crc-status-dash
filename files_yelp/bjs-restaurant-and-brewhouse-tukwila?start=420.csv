Dave F.,"Santa Monica, CA",301,1475,174,3.0,2/7/2010,"Interesting name for a restaurant! Make sure the visualization portion of the brain is shut down and you'll enjoy. This place has the ambiance of a sports bar turned restaurant. It's a bit of both with lots of big screen TV's but a nice quiet restaurant area.  The food wasn't bad for a chain and the service was better than most SouthCenter places. The menu is a bit like a Cheesecake Factory with lots of pics, lots of genres but not quite as overwhelming. The Happy Hour specials looked like a great deal and this may be their best meal. All in all, we had a reasonable sized, good value for our dollar. I'd try it again!"
M S.,"Auburn, WA",0,21,,4.0,6/22/2015,"Love this place! I love how you can order online before even arriving as well as being able to pay through my mobile phone. If you sign up for their rewards they send great coupons, and food is always amazing"
Serge Z.,"Federal Way, WA",1,10,,1.0,6/16/2014,"Is it possible to leave less than one star? This was a terrible experience. Y first and last time going. We had to wait an hour to get our food, and no, they were not busy. Our server and 3 others were standing around. The food was cold when we got it. The server dropped sauce all over one from the party. Not enough silverware for all in party. Terrible!"
R. A. D.,"South San Francisco, CA",32,71,107,4.0,1/30/2014,"Barely a wait, although I wouldn't expect a wait for lunch in the middle of the week.  Once seated, the service was quick and prompt.  The food came out just as quickly. Our waiter was very nice but somewhat a little TOO laid back.  Either way. Speedy service, yummy food, and just the right proportions for a lunch time meal before I catch a flight back to SF, awesome!"
Erica W.,"Bothell, WA",91,369,485,4.0,7/26/2011,"Mac N Cheese = Bee's Knees!! Happy hour menu was great. Husband had the personal pizza and he said it was one of the best ones he's had. Too bad there isn't a BJs in our neck of the woods...On the other hand, maybe that's not a bad thing. ha!"
Sergiu P.,"Federal Way, WA",0,5,,3.0,4/26/2015,This place is ok. Would go back for beer. On my last visit did not feel welcome. Got charged for substitution on my pizza ( protein for protein and I got less expensive choice ). At least should of been informed by our server.
Sharon C.,"Seattle, WA",148,251,79,3.0,3/21/2013,"I tried the gluten free pizza here a few days ago and it was pretty good! However, again, the service wasn't too great. Everything just took really long. Patience was my friend and I's middle name but it almost felt like the larger party was much more important to take care of. Either way, I still had a great time and i'm happy to have tried the gf pizza!"
Garret A.,"Seattle, WA",46,78,10,4.0,2/4/2011,"Always great. I prefer this place over cheesecake factory any day.  Lots of great beers, awesome pizza, very diverse menu. Great hour, mini pizzas and a beer for under 10 buck is awesome. My one recommendation is that you have to try a pizookie for desert. Its my second favorite desert served anywhere in the city. First favorite for those that are wondering is Bananas Foster served table side at the metropolitan.  Really happy that there is a BJ's here in Seattle finally as I was a fan for a long time before in California.  This review spans over probably eating here about 15 times, I am sure I will be back 15 more times in 2011.  Thanks."
Arthur Z.,"Irvine, CA",28,63,27,3.0,3/22/2012,"I come here for the beer. The food is decent, and I enjoy it somewhat.  Very American style on the menu. Staff seems tired sometimes, so there may be a wait due to slower service.  Coming with friends for drinks is definitely your best bet here.  I haven't had any awful experience, but haven't had the greatest experience either. So, I'm safe to come by for a drink and a small bite with friends after work."
Elizabeth O.,"Renton, WA",8,4,,2.0,5/9/2015,"I give it two stars rather than one because I didn't see any rats crawling around the baseboards. We opted for this over Moctezuma because Moctezuma had a 75 minute wait, while BJ's was only  a 5 minute wait. YEAH, RIGHT. I mean, it was a 5 minute wait to get seated, plus an hour wait to get our food. My husband got a pizza, I got a french dip, one of our dinner partners got a salad, and the other dinner partner got nachos. OK, let's size this up: salad is quick and easy, nachos are quick and easy, french dip is quick and easy, and pizza takes a while. Considering that the pizza should have been the hold-up, my husband's pizza was dry and less than fresh. The bread on my french dip was sweet, which galled me every time I took a bite of what should be an entirely savory sandwich. They left off the cheese ... of everything. Not only did my swiss and roast beef french dip have no swiss, the nachos were almost devoid of cheese. Again, nachos devoid of cheese. No beans, no meat, no cheese. Just salsa, sour cream, and olives. The salad got a good review, however. Good for them. They stuck some meat on some lettuce and didn't screw it up. Sure, we could have sent stuff back, but that would have tacked on another hour. The pizookie was good, but I was so tired at that point (this having turned into an almost two hour affair) that I was rushing to finish it so I could get home to bed before I fell asleep on the table. Anyway, never again. Never, ever again."
Lelani C.,"North Bend, WA",24,28,14,5.0,1/28/2014,The raspberry beer is so yummy! ! Absolutely Amazing and I would go there again just for the beer!  The beacon cheeseburger was good.
Tiffany T.,"Renton, WA",4,30,,2.0,7/17/2011,"I am blown away about how popular this restaurant is. Every time I go there, I regret it. Unforuntley it's always here for a girls night. Now I can't speak for everything because I've only tried a few things but the first time I had some sort of pasta and it was horrible. It had NO flavor what so ever. I could have stayed home and made a TV dinner pasta! Then on another experience I had the fish and chips. Again no flavor. Do they not have pepper back there or anything? I gave them 2 stars because I tried their deep fried avocado rolls and those were good. The service is like any other restaurant I've been too. Not bad, but could be better. All and all, I think this place is overrated."
Lydia S.,"Beacon Hill, Seattle, WA",0,26,2,1.0,1/14/2015,"Food is not good, pretty bland. drinks ok. Waitress didn't give any utensils when asked for a fork I literally got a fork with no napkin or knives. That was the second request"
Barry Z.,"Lake Stevens, WA",436,118,5,3.0,12/28/2012,A-Ok Great service and good beers and food. Just a large chain restaurant attached to a mall. Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either.
Jason D.,"San Jose, CA",0,113,1,1.0,5/6/2011,"Allegedly we're dealing with a sportsbar that takes beer quality a little more seriously than most chain macro-sportsbars. OK, this could work. Besides their own brews, really nice list of Belgian beers in the bottle. So there's a game 7 of an NHL playoff series in progress, and it's not being shown. Some of the TV's are showing -- get this -- an NFL draft preview show, all stuido guys talking, with of course no sound. Ask waitstaff and barstaff, and none of them have heard of the Bruins or Canadiens (seriously?). It's a sportsbar? They say, ""uh, we'll put it on if we find it."" Yep, sure. Waiter keeps not bringing things -- 3 trips for him to remember a water. And then, the best. One of these carefully-selected Belgian beers, served way too cold (the brewer's instructions on the bottle said 8-12C, and it was about 5 or 6) and with no glass. Now, honestly, drinking an icy cold beer from a bottle is what I'd expect from a sportsbar, but why'd you tease me with this BS about being beer connoisseurs and having this great list? Food was sub-par too. Epic fail."
Jen P.,"Kent, WA",33,32,22,5.0,1/6/2014,Good service and good food each time. I've been in a small party and a very large party with service being very consistent. Prices are reasonable and some of my favorites are just appetizers! Try the potstickers and boneless wings.
A W.,"New Berlin, WI",0,12,2,5.0,3/2/2015,Came here 1 month ago and had criticized the service.   Now that has changed with the service going from 3 to 5 with our server Cynthia being outstanding.   The food was as expected 5 of 5 and having the discussions with the current management Jenny the service has reached the expectations.
Shelby W.,"Renton, WA",793,109,53,3.0,3/3/2013,I've been here a couple of times in the past and I've never seen it this busy. Surprisingly we found a small corner table in the back of the bar. When we sat down I saw the rest of someone's pizza which I'm glad I did. It was very small and barely any toppings on it. There was a good chance that I would've ordered it as well. Also surprising that they have a small plates and bites section on the menu with most item under $5 if you're not that hungry or just don't want to spend much $$$. I ordered the BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger which was pretty good. I also ordered the thick cut fries (jojo's) that came with it instead of the shoestring ones and they were good as well. I tried some of my friends tamato mozzarella salad and it tasty and very fresh. I've read some pretty bad reviews of this place but my experience turned out quite well.
Brad H.,"Kirkland, WA",234,971,114,4.0,7/29/2011,"I had two mini appetizers here and have no complaints about the food.  The prices are decent for a sit down establishment and the menu variety is great.  The staff was friendly; however, not very aware of the tables they were serving.  It took a considerable amount of time to be seated, despite looking into a large dining room that was mostly empty.  There was no communication from the staff about what was taking a while to be seated.  The staff overall has the attitude of we are just doing our jobs and could really care less about going above and beyond.  Overall though no complaints about the food, if the service would be more attentive and friendly here, this place would be stellar."
Dae Y.,"Seattle, WA",182,548,18,3.0,3/16/2011,"To my female companion whose idea it was to come here...thank you for introducing me to BJ's! They get a 5 for the background music:  Jane's Addiction, The Smiths, The Police...very cool. Think of a hybrid of Joey Restaurants and Cheesecake Factory.  The framing around the bar is nice looking.  Very high Ceilings in the restaurant. The men's room is nice.  Soothing low light. The same dining music piped in. Nice high flow hot water.  Paper towels were more like paper, than towels.  My companion said I was being a Snotty Sally about my pickyness on the paper towels. So I had the Tomato soup and grilled ham 'n cheese.  Interesting presentation cuz they cut up the sandwich into equal sized sticks.  I thought it was just for presentation, but after the meal I realized it made perfect sense for dipping! Soup was perfect temperature cuz I could dip and shove it in my mouth w/o cooling it.  Made for quicker, less messy eating. Overall, a good hearty meal.  But i wouldn't come down here all the way from Seattle for BJ's as a single destination."
