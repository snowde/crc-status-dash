Eunice F.,"Honolulu, HI",304,414,245,3.0,8/16/2013,"we just sat at the bar and had a few drinks and appetizers. Decent options for happy hour and food was pretty consistent for a chain restaurant. we just had the chicken wings, chicken lettuce wraps and pizza and all the food tasted mediocre, pretty good but nothing special."
Jarad S.,"Newcastle, WA",5,18,2,1.0,1/13/2013,"I used to go to this place a lot. As of now I can't even think why I did. Went here last night and ordered some beer appetizers to start off...After waiting 25 minutes for some brushcetta we asked about our beers and she had totally forgotten. Whatever, she's just a little flustered maybe even though it wasn't that busy. We then order our meals and it literally takes 50 minutes till she comes and apologizes for the wait and gives us a free small caesar salad. The couple next to us had been sitting for 15 minutes and hadn't even received any menus, so they left.  A few minutes later they bring out my deep dish medium pizza - which, by the way isn't even deep dish anymore it is essentially pan pizza...they don't even use the black pans anymore. I told her that I ordered a deep dish and not a hand tossed and she said that is just how they make their pizzas now and had no idea why so essentially it's just a lot of dry fluffy dough. Then, I realize the pizza is completely the wrong order with none of the toppings I asked for. By the time I finally get my pizza my friends are done with their food so it's pretty pointless now...yet again, another issue - they didn't put sauce on it! I asked my waitress and she brought me a rameken of marina to dip my pizza in I guess? It tasted like DiGiorno frozen pizza and marinara sauce, and she brought it to me COLD! Pizza with no sauce and cold marinara to dip it in? Gross. I had my friends try and they agreed it was terrible. I've had their deep dish pizzas when they used to make them the good way but I will NEVER be going back with my family or friends and will tell everyone I know to steer away from this establishment."
Beth M.,"Waddell, AZ",319,31,187,2.0,5/22/2013,"BJ's in Tacoma can be hit or miss but I've rarely had a bad experience in Southcenter.  I had to write about this one. I can't rate it as A-OK cause it wasn't an A-OK experience so I had to go with two stars. We came during an afternoon lull.  No wait.  They seated us outside.  It was a bit chilly, but we had jackets.   Our waiter appeared to have a couple of tables. He took a drink order.  I order iced tea and requested sweetener.  (Why don't waitstaff just automatically bring it when they bring ice tea to a table?)   He brought the water for the others and my iced tea.  No sweetener.  I asked again.  I was very thirsty but I'm not wanting to drink unsweetened iced tea.  We waited.  He served another table their food, walked past us and we tried to flag him down again he told us to ""hold it"" and rolled his eyes as he walked all the way down, got them ketchup and walked all the way back.  Then came asking if we were ready for apps.  I said I wanted the sweetener and then we'd talk food.  He said okay tossing his head back for another eye roll. stopped at the other two tables, started to take an order and at that point I lost it.  I went for a manager.  Told them the situation.  By then I'd my iced tea had been sitting 10 minutes.  I'm usually fairly easy going but this one got me.  I requested another waitperson.  Lauren did fine for us the rest of the meal.   We did get some glares from the original waiter.  I found it interesting that after those other tables cleared out we did not see him again."
Jules H.,"Seattle, WA",2,26,1,1.0,5/16/2013,"Blech, there's a reason I've never gone into BJs and today solidified why. My visiting Midwestern coworkers didn't get enough to eat at Blue C and wanted to get these cookie-pizza dessert things down the way at BJs. Sure I'll go with and have a drink but I actually consider sushi a dinner.  We get in the lobby (which had a foul odor) and ask for a table for 5. It's only 5:30 on a Thurs shouldn't be a problem. Well someone will be right with you says the surly and stoned looking hostess that looked like she rolled out of bed and had to come to work. Waitress took a group of 2 to our intended table. Hostess loudly vents her frustration ""She was supposed to take the 5!!"" Nice communication.  Get to our table and ordered some drinks. Our waitress was cold, unfriendly and about 16 years old. My colleague asks about an off menu item she normally orders back east. Waitress repeatedly argues she's never heard of such a thing and you can order these three giant things instead to make up that smaller dish. Ummmm if you still serve the parts why not make up the mixed basket? We put in our orders, a mixture of appetizers, main dishes and desserts.  I head to the restroom and finally discover why the whole restaurant has a funk of dirty restroom smell. There's puke on the floor outside the women's room. Classy. Appetite lost.  Return and find my colleague had asked the manager about the off menu dish. Manager admits she didn't know it and neither did the line cooks but if one did on another day they'd gladly make it, but they don't know what it is. Ok well that was a more appropriate answer, waitress hope you took notes! After an unusually long amount of time the food shows up. All of it. At once. The appetizer that should have come long before my colleague's main dish. Colleague's main dish totally screwed up (she requested no chicken, whole chicken breast on top), other colleague's not-off menu replacement appetizer, and third colleague's dessert. Colleague #1 sent back the appetizer since she couldn't actually eat it with her main dish already there. Colleague #2 had to wait until all of this was gone to order dessert. Colleague #3 finished his dessert. All very odd timing. Why did our waitress not ask about timing of the courses?  Do you want the appetizer with the meal or before? Is a standard question.  If I wasn't enjoying myself hanging out with the colleagues I see once a year in person I would have run away from the stink of this restaurant. Seriously the lobby of your establishment shouldn't smell of sewer. There should not be puke on the floor. Happy hour is longer than the other establishments at the mall but now I know why! No adult with standards would actually want to eat there!! Save your money. Go to the food court upstairs."
Michael M.,"Renton, WA",102,13,1,2.0,3/24/2011,"A group of co-workers and I met at BJ's in Southcenter last night for drinks and appetizers to celebrate a birthday.  We were able to reserve a corner booth in advance, which was a good thing, as people filtered in and out throughout the evening.   Our waiter was very attentive, making sure everyone in the group had their food and/or beverage choice delivered promptly.  He also made sure to keep everyone's bill separate, which was a good move on his part.    The only blemish to the evening was near the end, when there were about four of us remaining.  We all received our closing bills, then the manager approached us, stating that she was ""covering about $30 worth of food on our bill"".  This led us to believe that some of our co-workers had pulled a dine-n-dash move, and we offered to pay the difference, splitting it between us.   She then went on to explain that it wasn't out fault - it was due to a ""computer error"".  Apparently not everything ordered made it it to their system, and didn't end up being charged appropriately to each person's bill.   If it wasn't our fault, why bring it up?  We all felt like idiots, initially blaming our co-workers for being the ones who ate and ran.  If it's an ""in-house issue"", why should it be a concern to your customers?   If anything, this lets us know that they have a flawed system, and your chances of getting some meals/drinks for free are pretty good if you show up with a large group!"
Omar M.,"Kirkland, WA",22,31,10,5.0,11/3/2013,Pizoooookie it is.. been here many times love the food. Service is a bit slow but its ok
Lisa H.,"Seattle, WA",136,129,88,4.0,2/2/2011,"For whatever reason when I am at Southcenter I ALWAYS end up at BJ's. I had never heard of this restaurant until I came to shop at the newly remodeled Southcenter. At first I wasn't very impressed, it seemed like just another Cheesecake Factory with a huge menu and fufu drinks (or maybe Cheesecake copied them IDK). My waiter/waitress has been friendly every time I have come in so I wasn't totally turned off by the place.  But after giving it 2 more chances I could see why people liked this place. It was like the adult version of those huge chain restaurants. They had their own brew of beer, which I found to be a plus. And I also noticed one really great thing, NO KIDS!! Yes it was a restaurant just filled with adults.  I didn't have to worry that talking to my friends was going to be interrupted by a screaming bratty 2 year old. Don't get me wrong I appreciate the family dining experience, but sometimes it's just nice to have adult time. And it's not that it isn't family friendly, just that I think a lot of families will pick other places to go. I HOPE! ;) Also they have a really great lunch deal and you can get a good lunch for under $10. Their happy hour seems to be pretty good too.  I guess my bottom line is that when I am at Southcenter, wanting to eat and not be surrounded by kids, I will pick BJ's."
Jo A.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,5,2,5.0,5/10/2012,"BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse 'had me at hello.'  Here's the story, my husband and I, tired from shopping at Southcenter Mall, decided to try BJ's before driving home.  We entered the crowded restaurant, and were seated almost immediately.  The hostess took us to a large booth (the only one available) and we sat down. She said our server, Michael, would be with us shortly and left us alone.  Ten minutes passed, and no one came by.  We looked at the menu, talked about what we would order, and waited another five minutes.  Finally, Michael came over and asked us how long had we been waiting?   I said, ""About twenty minutes. (I tacked on five minutes for 'wait trauma').  He apologized profusely and said that they would do something about that.   I said no problem, it wasn't a big deal.  But he said it is a big deal and we'll do something about it. Michael couldn't have been nicer as he explained the menu.  We decided on the Avocado Egg Rolls and Housemade Italian Mini Meatballs for appetizers. For dinner, we ordered the barbequed pulled pork. I went to the restroom, and when I returned our appetizers were there.  They were delicious!  The wontons were crispy, and the blend of avocado, cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, pine nuts, chipotle pepper and spices in the wrap couldn't have been better.  Next, I sampled the mini meatballs tossed in Marsala marinara sauce and it too, was delicious.  While we were waiting for our dinner, a man came over and said he heard that we had a long wait time; he was sorry for that and wanted to make it up to us by comping our appetizers.  I immediately calculated that would be around $15.00 taken off our bill.  We thanked the man (the manager?) and when he left, I said I thought that kind of service had gone the way of the Dodo bird. Our pulled pork sandwich came and I was not disappointed in that either: Their special sauce was tasty as well as their signature coleslaw. After we had eaten, Michael asked if we ""saved room"" for dessert. Yes, we had---we had 'saved' the price of two appetizers.  We ordered one Apple Berry Burst Crumble that was touted as being a delicious blend of apples and berries with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. When the Apple berry Burst Crumble arrived, Michael set it down, asked us if we wanted anything else and thanked us for coming.  We told him how much we enjoyed our food and he gave us the bill and left. The dessert was---how many times can I write delicious?---well, whose counting?  It was delicious. When we go up to leave we knew that we would return and it wouldn't be just when we were shopping in the mall;  BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse would be a destination all by itself."
Julia R.,"Rohnert Park, CA",147,405,371,4.0,8/4/2013,"Definitely worth a visit for happy hour from 9 pm till closing. They have a cider among their regular beer offerings, and the mini pizzas are a great value during HH! Atmosphere is sports bar all the way, and they have this awesome thing called a pizookie that I highly recommend you try. This location is right off the freeway, on the mall property. Can get super busy on weekends, but even then you can still usually get a seat in the lounge area."
Jim T.,"Issaquah, WA",26,124,,3.0,2/27/2013,"Went with the pan pizza this time and was disappointed. Think Pizza Hut. Flavor was okay, but crust not. Will try thin next time. Did have the flatbread once before and it was excellent. Enjoyed the limited release imperial red ale."
Mandy C.,"Fremont, Seattle, WA",393,355,199,4.0,12/30/2010,"If I had a choice between Joey's and Bj's, I'd definitely choose BJ's any day. Yes yes, I'm comparing, but who's to blame? SHAY the waiter is AMAZING. On top of that , he surprised me with a Pizookie for my graduation dinner! The phone service is a little shitty, and when I asked for a reserved table for ten, the girl on the phone told me I couldn't make reservations because there weren't enough tables and gave me no other option.  ......So screw her. We went in anyways, and ended up getting a table within 20 minutes...... But Shay made it alllllll better. Thank god for better waiters than hostess'."
C A.,"San Francisco, CA",16,302,327,3.0,10/27/2010,"I had the Southwestern salad w/ Blackened Salmon and it was really good. The portions are huge but if you are gonna try something new, try their loaded potato! It is HUGE! Haha! it was refreshingly fun to see such a huge potato for a person to try to eat. My coworker recommends the 'pizookie' .. i saw a picture of this dessert and it even tastes good in the pictures!! =) Google it! Well the only downside was that this place is at a mall and i am not a big fan of mall chain restaurants... The place also felt like a big supporter of oversized American fat-ism due to portion size, non-organic, fried nature of things... yes i got the salad but that even felt a little...non-San Francisco! haha!=) apples and oranges? Anyways, definitely good times w/ friends though!=)"
Joshua S.,"Seattle, WA",15,141,8,4.0,7/5/2011,"Great bar area, lots of TVs.  Menu is HUGE!  Moby Dick is thinner. Pizza rocks!  Burgers too. Never had a bad meal here.  Servers are pretty good too. I always hit this joint when I'm in town."
Senthil V.,"Pleasanton, CA",81,149,20,4.0,6/13/2011,"Have been to BJ's in more than one place (Seattle, Portland, Etc.), they have never disappointed me.  Some of their custom made veggie burgers are phenomenal. The in house brewed beers are quite a wholesome, Am not a lover of dark beer but they also had a good variety of pale ones. The menu is huge to choose from and the waiters/waitress are usually friendly and let u pick the best (or a combination). I guess I really like this place and will go here repeatedly.  Price: Fits your pocket !!"
Justin P.,"Seattle, WA",14,5,,4.0,10/9/2013,Great Service and food! Pazooki oh yeah!
Rich M.,"Anacortes, WA",1,5,,1.0,1/31/2015,"One of the worst experiences. Waited 20-25 minutes with open tables. First thing, they were out of boneless wings. Second, the kids pizza was overcooked and looked gross. Service was slow. Not coming back."
Jared R.,"Issaquah, WA",10,29,9,3.0,7/8/2013,I was here on 4/6/13. I must say the Irish Root beer is pretty damn tasty if you like Jameson in your Root beer :)
Lala L.,"Seattle, WA",21,59,5,2.0,2/19/2011,"Ehh.  It's a mix of a TGI Fridays and a Cheesecake Factory. Nothing really great, and not much to write about. In fact, we've been there several times (more for the drinks) and I cannot remember anything we've actually eaten.  And then there's that whole Southcenter-you may have your car broken into-drama with random gang -thing. Ever seen a someone eat a Pizookie hardcore? Go at your own risk."
Meghan P.,"Mukilteo, WA",113,128,38,3.0,11/4/2012,"The food here was really good. I had the California Chicken sandwich, a salad, and tried an avocado egg roll. All of them were really good and I would order them again. The reason it gets 3 stars (a low 3, mind you) is for the service, which was horrible. First off, it wasn't that busy when we walked in and they told us it would be about 5 minutes until we could be seated. No worries. We'll wait. 20 minutes later they finally sat us. 30 seconds after sitting down, the waitress asked if we were ready. The menu here is like a book, so we asked for more time. We didn't see her or our drinks for what seemed like forever. Finally, she came back to take our order and when she brought my salad, I had no silverware with which to eat it. I tried to flag down a different waiter, since she was nowhere to be seen, and was blatantly ignored. I finally caught someone's attention and managed to get silverware, but c'mon. Really?? The other thing which was annoying and turned me off to the experience was when she brought us our drink refills. She brought them to the table and left them, leaving empty handed. So all our empty glasses sat on the table with us the whole meal. By the time we left, there were 5 empty glasses on the table... There were only 2 of us present.  At one point she even cleared our plates, reaching over the glasses, and still didn't take them.  Next time, I'll just order takeout. Get the food, skip the service."
Brenda R.,"Seattle, WA",20,69,20,4.0,6/5/2011,"Tasty beers on tap?  Check.  Yummy deep dish pizzas?  Check.  Warm, fresh-outta-the-oven Pizookies with cold ice cream on top?  Check.  Laid back atmosphere and great prices?  Check! I've been going to BJ's for several years now, since they first became popular in San Bruno, CA (right next door to San Francisco).  I have to say, I LOVE BJ's.  What's not to love about this place?  They have great food, a huge menu with TONS of selections, delicious beers on tap, and great prices!  Most of the BJ's Restaurants I've fared are also conveniently attached to malls!  What's not to love about that?  Needless to say, I was stoked when I moved to Washington and found out a BJ's Restaurant was within reasonable driving distance from where I live. BJ's Restaurants dress code is casual, so my typical jeans and t-shirt attire fit right in.  I like that the restaurant is clean, modern, and has flat screen TVs everywhere, so that one can enjoy the game.  I've been to this location three times so far, and have yet to have a bad experience.  All of the servers and hosts/hostesses have been wonderful. My favorites: + Their Harvest Hefeweizen from tap - DELICIOUS BEER!!!! + The triple chocolate Pizooki made with Ghirardelli chocolate YUM!!! + Any of the deep dish pizzas + Margherita Fresca flatbread pizza + Seared ahi (under 'Snacks and Small Bites') + Ahi Poke appetizer Not-so-favorite(s): - Their avocado egg rolls (under Appetizers).  Better at Cheesecake Factory With beer, pizza, and Pizookies on their menu, you bet your bums I'm a loyal BJ's customer!"
