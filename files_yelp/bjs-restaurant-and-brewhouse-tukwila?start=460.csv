Prashant V.,"Kent, WA",14,5,,2.0,10/29/2013,"We went on a Friday night, great environment & all but the wait was ridiculously long! When we went in the customer service was bad, waited 30+mins for food & it tasted bland. Spend your Friday nights somewhere else with your family!"
Andrew Y.,"Seattle, WA",19,42,,5.0,10/3/2013,I watched the Seahawks-Texans game here.  Service was quick and friendly.  And the pizza and beer I had tasted good!
Sherry S.,"Seattle, WA",13,82,528,2.0,11/19/2010,"Setting:  This place was a lot smaller than I thought it was and I was surprised to see tables so close to each other. The place was fairly cold with a very loud atmosphere.  Service:  It was just okay. We didn't have the friendliest server but she wasn't the worst. She was just more... awkward? The service wasn't fast but it wasn't too slow either. Food:  Mango mojito - Pretty good, not too strong, not too weak. It had just enough kick in it.  Calamari - Probably the best thing we ordered. The breading on it was perfect and it had just the right crisp to it.  Quesadillas - Meh.... they were just okay to me. A little on the salty side.  Angel hair toscana - This wasn't good at all. It had no flavor and was absolutely dry. I had to ask for a side of alfredo to toss over it.  Texas style chicken fried steak - Reading the description of this on the menu made it sound absolutely DELICIOUS... but WRONG! It definitely was not. It was very lacking in flavor and just tasted like eating breaded meat with no flavor.  I was hoping I was have a better experience here but nah.... I probably wouldn't come back."
Rhiannon D.,"Seattle, WA",6,28,,1.0,7/9/2013,"I used to love BJ's.  The binget is SO good, and the honey mustard salad was my go to.  The last probably 5-6 times I have been to BJ's the service has been beyond terrible.  Our food takes so long to come out that its cold by the time we get it (I usually get a salad, but the chicken strips on it are disgusting by the time we get it and my boyfriends food is always cold), half the time the server never comes back to check on us or refill our drinks.  One time I went with my sister and we said we wanted separate checks and the server just split the bill randomly! Put 2 sodas on one bill, and 2 meals on the other.  It was so messed up, and when we asked for a correction, he brought us the whole bill split in to 2 equal parts.  Whenever anyone suggests going here, I always pass, and always will."
John K.,"Springboro, OH",4,11,,4.0,10/15/2012,"Far better than average service.  The menu is filled with a multitude of options.  Food was slightly above average - especially the deserts!  Treat yourself to a ""piz-ookie"" after your meal!"
J B.,"King, WA",2,55,,3.0,11/14/2013,"Service was bad here last time I went on 6/8/12.  Our group waited 40 minutes before we were even given a chance to put a drink order in.  We were comped for it, but it was still redick. Food was still nothing to write home about and pizooki is always an awesome treat."
Shelby S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,52,1,2.0,8/27/2013,"Great root beer. Large menu. However, I've never had excellent service here. Most recently we waited almost an hour for a table (when promised 15 minutes) only to find they hadn't written our name down. Poor service when finally seated, servers changed three times without our knowledge and food took 45 minutes+ for only three desserts. Management did not accommodate our situation when brought to attention. Most likely won't be back."
Joseph C.,"Seattle, WA",194,21,32,4.0,10/21/2012,Many fantastic foods to choose from on the menu and tastefully handcrafted beers in a lively environment!
Melissa W.,"Seatac, WA",30,10,1,1.0,5/7/2014,"This place had a lot of things bad. When we were first seated, after waiting 25 min, we sat down long enough to order drinks, then the manager asked if we would moved to a booth. She did this because she was trying to make 2 people that were having an unhappy experience. Also, the manager said she would buy our appetizer if we moved.  So we move and get a complete idiot for a waiter. He couldn't hear us. We had to yell so would either comprehend or hear us, not sure which. Got our soup and salad before the app. When got the app it was supposed to be potato skins...more like Chips. We decided to leave even though our food was almost ready. Did not want to wait for bad service anymore. Good Bloody Mary though...still not worth going back."
CJ R.,"Mountain View, CA",37,38,,3.0,12/8/2013,Average food. Average Service. Decent Beer...but a lot better then cheesecake factory and other things that surround this place
Matt R.,"Seattle, WA",2,45,3,5.0,7/12/2013,"BJ's catered an event I attended last month. I have never been to the restaurant, but the food was Awesome and I'll definitely go to their restaurant sometime soon."
Wendy B.,"Marysville, WA",1,4,,2.0,9/22/2013,"We ate here last night, and it was pretty disappointing. First of all we were seated outside, which would normally be fine, except 1) it is literally right next to the parking lot and besides the cars who like to bump their tunes loud enough to make the table vibrate, there is some kind of disturbing sewer type smell that wafts in every once in a while which is not very appetizing, and 2) we were seated right next to a huge table of about 15 screaming junior high school girls whose parents were (smartly) seated at another huge table next to them (but not quite as close as we were).  We couldn't hear each other unless we were yelling over all the noise.  You may think I'm just talking about the noise you expect when you go into a Red Robin, but, believe me, this was Red Robin times 20. Our waitress, unfortunately, was also their waitress, and was much more occupied with keeping up with all of them than getting our drinks and food and checking on us.  We ordered our drinks right away, but did not get them for about 20 minutes.  We had gotten water and dinner salads before our drinks ever arrived.  The waitress did tell us a couple of times that she was just waiting on the bar, and they were backed up, but seriously!!  Once we finally got the drinks, she never checked on us to see if we wanted refills, but honestly we had decided not to get them anyway cause we couldn't take another half hour of screaming teenagers. The food was so-so.  I liked the flavor of my Tuscan Chicken Limone, but when it arrived, the grease pool swimming in the cream sauce was a bit disturbing.  My husband got the Jambalaya, and said it was just alright as well.  Our waitress did check with us once to see if our food was okay, but managed to do this as she was serving and clearing the other table, and was clearly just looking for the nod and nothing else.  Did she not notice the bone dry beer glass that had been sitting on the table for at least 15 minutes? We did have somewhere to be, but could not get our waitress or find her for at least 20 minutes (and our credit card was sitting at the end of the table as a bit of a clue), so had to flag down another server.  She took our card and said ""no worries,"" but then our waitress magically showed up about 5 minutes later with our bill.  We had to tell her that we'd given the card to another server, so then she had to go find it.  Finally the manager (I think) came over with our bill and card, and apologized about the service.  I talked to her a bit, and was nice, but let her know what happened.  Gee it was nice she came over to apologize for something she didn't do, but when she handed us the bill, it was still FULL price.  She didn't even comp us a drink or a freaking side salad. I am not unsympathetic to the waitress having to handle such a huge table, but honestly they should have gotten someone else to handle the smaller tables.  I'm pretty sure we won't go back."
Melissa F.,"Seattle, WA",81,13,,2.0,4/19/2013,"I have been here on three different occasions. The first was actually really good. The last two times though the service has been really bad. My boyfriend ordered his burger medium well but it came out raw on the inside. They took it back and gave him a burnt one the next time, not to mention it took over an hour to get our food initially. Needless to say they gave us his meal for free and said sorry but overall the experience was not good at all. Even after the discount the meal for just myself and another adult was $65. Way overpriced for the food and experience. The Cobb salad at Wendy's is better and 1/4 of the price."
Sasha D.,"Issaquah, WA",0,8,,2.0,9/27/2014,"Tonight waiting to get in was miserable.  It was unorganized,  peoples buzzers weren't going off,  people were waiting outside but missing their call because no one would announce to those of us outside where we had to be due to lack of room inside.  Finally got seated and the service was so slow,  waiter was never around to refill drinks,  didnt get our salads that came with our meals and unfortunately the food was not very warm when we got it.  Definitely not worth the wait tonight,  probably won't go back. Worst of all,  the mariners were playing an important game and they didn't have it on any of the tvs in the dining area"
m F.,"Tacoma, WA",8,18,,2.0,4/22/2012,"Food: Mediocre---they hype their chili like its some slow cooked masterpiece made with one of their finest brews. I'm pretty sure it's a 1.99 mega-can of off-brand chili from the Cash&Carry. The only thing that appeased me was that it was on the bottom of my 10.00 nacho plate, not topping them or it would have been sent back. The nachos were meh--tasted like nachos! The week prior I had gone for lunch and they didn't put bacon on my Turkey Cobb sandwich. I guess judging from other reviews that when anything is missing or wrongly served, they just bring you a side of what you're missing rather than take the dish back. lame. Anyway I got a dish of cold limp bacon brought to me, not some spectacular ""applewood bacon"" as described. Service: Not bad Pricing: They try to draw you in with lunch special and happy hour prices but outside of that time frame it's a rip-off with everything being 5.00 more than its worth Atmosphere: The Southcenter spot needs to be steam cleaned and disinfected twice. The Outdoor room is so gross, the tables are always sticky and the chair legs are covered in gross food filth. like a long used high-chair that has never been cleaned after suffering through toddlerhood"
Samantha G.,"Seattle, WA",766,1021,1894,3.0,5/3/2010,"I'm going to be honest: this is not my first choice to dine at. However I had fun going with a group of friends. I split the jambalaya pasta and chicken pesto pizza with 2 people and I wasn't too impressed. I mean they were edible but it didn't make me feel like I wanted to hog the dishes to myself. Other than drinks, the only thing I would come here for is the pizookie. It is seriously the ideal ""fatty girl"" dessert IMO. That's all I'll be ordering the next time I go."
Thigh C.,"Seattle, WA",73,337,7,5.0,3/20/2010,"Interior - Roomy with a touch of coziness - 5 stars. The moment I came in, I was like... wow, this place is nice and huge! It's so clean - I'm impressed. Drinks - cocktails and mojito - 5 stars. Service - I'm tempted to make it 4 stars because our server is kind a all over the place but we kind a tolerated it. Food - 5 stars for sports bar. I'm not expecting 'wow' food here but everything is decent. Margherita pizza is really good. Their menu is actually like a book, so thick.  Definitely, going back again."
Cindy T.,"Seattle, WA",236,218,765,4.0,8/8/2010,"I love BJ's, I wish that they had a location up in the North area! I had a birthday dinner here once, when it just opened up recently. At that time, according to them they did not take reservations for my group. I really enjoyed their food their last time before, and know that the place was big enough to hold a large group, so I chose it again. Thus, my group of around 12 people had to wait...in the seating area for about half an hour to get a table. Which sucks, because I guess now they do take reservations!?  Anyway, food was tasty, everyone had a great time. My only complaint is that the service is a bit slow. Although they did accommodate everyone appropriately, we were there for a few hours...(too long, in my opinion).  My most recent visit was not too long ago, with another large group gathering. This time, service was extremely slow again...two waiters had to cater our table, and getting our food felt forever. Yet, another couple hours at the restaurant. The great thing though, is the refillable root beer! We surely all tried to drink as many, and the servers were at least kind enough to always refill our drinks when asked. My tip, is to try avoiding busy hours (esp. dinner time, later in night) when waiting time can take long. Large groups are great here, but be prepared to be staying a least a minimum of a couple hours there. Service can sometimes be slow..(why I gave 4/5 stars) but its usually worth the wait. Also...don't forget to try the (refillable) root beer, and a pizooke! (Free, if its your birthday!)"
Jennifer G.,"Seattle, WA",144,175,4,3.0,4/23/2010,"Meh. BJ's is hit and miss.  Some days I get a great server, spot-on food and a convenient, well-placed table, and other days I'm stuck asking, ""What did you say?"" as I drink my beer and eat a pork sandwich that isn't going to sit well in an hour, keeping an eye out for my suddenly-missing waiter so I can get a refill. However, the beer is really good (try the Irish Red - it's my favorite) and when BJ's staff is on, they're on.  Just call ahead if you're coming in on a Friday or Saturday night, and be prepared for noise."
Scott D.,"Beaverton, OR",54,177,17,2.0,11/17/2012,"Took the gf here for lunch one day.  We were both pretty hungry and ordered steaks.  The steaks weren't that good and her steak was very undercooked.  The service was decent from what I can remember but there was something that really annoyed me about the server, I just can't recall."
