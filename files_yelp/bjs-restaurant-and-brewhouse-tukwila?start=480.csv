Lea D.,"Seattle, WA",16,21,14,5.0,12/9/2010,This place is awesome! My family went here for a graduation dinner party. My husband and I shared a medium Mediterranean pizza-soooooooooo good and huge! 2 pieces and I was stuffed. It's deep dish pizza with  tons of yummy toppings like kalamata olives and artichoke hearts! Then for dessert the entire party shared a huge pazooki! Holy crap this thing was large and amazing!!it's a huge cookie- we had half chocolate chip and half Oreo. It was so warm and gooey with ice cream on top! Even my husband whose not really a sweets fan was in love!  The restaurant itself was spaceous with nice dim lighting and huge tv screens over the bar area.  We had a really nice time I hope to be back soon!
Brian B.,"Edmonds, WA",0,6,,5.0,10/14/2014,"Been there over a dozen times and I will say its becoming my local favorite spot. Michael the Manager has been fantastic, really focuses on good customer Service. Been a few times where the Hostess dropped the ball or the server was clueless, but hey, we all make mistakes.  On the flip side we have had some fantastic servers there as well. Food is always good and they space out the appetizers from the main course just right. All in all great place to eat"

Richard W.,"Renton, WA",189,19,16,2.0,1/4/2013,"Ok, well, start off with the good, the food tasted wonderful! With that said, it was a pretty slow night at the restaurant (full when we got there, but within 30 minutes it was only about 2/3 full, maybe 1/2). I like to believe when the restaurant slows down on a busy night the service should speed up.  NOT this time! Were there for ALMOST two hours. We had four people at our table. First greeting was timely, drink order taking, timely as well, but then we wait at least an hour for our food to come out of the kitchen!  That's crazy! On top of that slowness (granted one item was a well done steak, so that takes a while) three of the four dishes were cold, the one that wasn't cold was the steak, likely because it took the longest to prepare so the other three sat under an inadequate heat lamp. Another issue, two of the four orders were incorrect, one of those a misunderstanding (mine) and another completely wrong. Then had to wait about 20 minutes for a birthday desert cookie to arrive at the table, then another 10-15 for the boxes/tab to show up."
Joseph J.,"Port Orchard, WA",1,95,,2.0,6/14/2014,"Went here instead of Elliot Bay Brewery.   Oops.   Ordered avocado spring rolls and pepperoni pan pizza.   Everyone else got sandwiches/burgers w/ fries.  After a while the burgers and pizza arrived.   Avocado spring rolls?   Oops.  They forgot.  ""but we can take it off your bill.""  You can take it off my bill?  Thanks!    The pepperoni pan pizza was similar to what I remember my daughter getting years ago for free at Pizza Hut as part of a school promotion: i.e. nothing special.   I ended up going forward with the avocado spring rolls because the pizza was so small.  Oops.  It was avocado and not much else - avocado overkill.  So overall, fairly disappointed in this corporate chain for the masses - designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  The burgers are alright I guess.  The service and food are low quality - or at least inconsistent.  Won't be going back.  Why 2 stars?  The beer wasn't bad - but not sure if it was a perfect pint."
Brian U.,"Seattle, WA",1,8,3,2.0,1/26/2010,Upon seeing a review that claimed that BJs has the best Chicago Style Pizza in the Seattle area I had to check it out. It's good pizza but it is by no means as authentic or delicious as Kylie's Pizza in Fremont. BJ's pizza tastes exactly like Pizza Hut Pizza but in deep dish form.  It is not Chicago Style. There is almost no sauce on the pizza and there is definitely none on the top of the pizza which is a defining characteristic of Chicago Style.  Would I go again? Probably but I'd go for the variety of beer. I'd get a pizza but I'd know I wasn't getting authentic Chi-Style.
Andrew L.,"Renton, WA",147,96,10,3.0,10/28/2012,"went here last night for dinner, Order Cajin pasta with shrimp. The order came out and there is no shrimp in it. Food took a unusually long time come out. Also friend at the tablet ordered a salad with their meal and that didn't come. waitress took full responsibility for the errors.  That aside, meal was sub par to what im used to from here."
MrMrs G.,"Milton, WA",0,19,3,2.0,8/2/2015,"We went here tonight for dinner.  We did call ahead seating about 30 minutes prior to arriving and were seated within 10 minutes of arriving, so that wasn't bad.  When we walked into the restaurant we noticed a lot of empty tables, even though they were telling people it was going to be a one-hour wait.  And we also noticed that almost every table we walked by was waiting for food, hardly anybody had food on their table, never a good sign I guess.  We waited a long time to place our order and then a very long time to get our food (not easy when you are dining with two young kids).  Finally our food arrived, but we soon realized that some of it was no good.  My daughter's corn dog bites were raw cornbread inside (how can you mess up deef-fried mini corn dogs?!).  My husband's quinoa and chicken dish was bland and boring.  My sister's hamburger was dry.  We complained to our waiter about the undercooked corn dog bites, and he clearly didn't care, but he did go get the manager.  The manager was a man of few words and just said sorry, do you want more?  We said no, that we couldn't wait any longer because our kids were already losing it from having to wait so long for the food in the first place.  He didn't offer anything else, so we told him we wanted the kid's meal removed from our bill.  He agreed and then disappeared and never came back.  We had to flag down our waiter to finally get our bill (which had had the kid's meal removed, thank goodness), and he asked us several times if we wanted dessert because he clearly wasn't listening the first time we said no (because all we really wanted was dinner that was cooked and tasted good).  We won't be going back to a BJ's again because we've had similar issues with the one in Tacoma as well.  It's too pricey of a restaurant to not have better service and more consistent food."
Kazuo O.,"Seattle, WA",81,408,137,4.0,8/8/2010,"Came here for my Birthday on a Sat night and had a party of 9.  Be prepared to wait even if you have a small group because this place was packed.   They had a special where you get a salad, a med pizza and pizookie (dessert) for two for only $20.  Everything tasted good and the Pizookie is a must have.  I guess Pizookie stands for (pizza + cookie), ice cream over a hot soft cookie, so good.  Their hand crafted black cherry soda was on point and you get as many refills as you like :)    I"
Kelly H.,"Tacoma, WA",46,8,,1.0,8/14/2013,"WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER  For a party of 8, we were there for 3.5 hours to get our drinks, food, and dessert. A tad ridiculous. it took an hour for our entrees to come out. Let alone the server forgot to take an order for one of the members in our party, but yet his order managed to come out first. The server and manager apologized an hour after our food wasnt on the table besides a few appetizers (fortunately, we ordered those). they said that they were expediting our food order ahead of everyone else, but yet there was another party of 8 that still managed to get their entrees before us and they were seated substantially later. They said free desserts on the house but that took at least another 30 minutes and once again people who ordered after us received their dessert before us. A person ordered a ""classic baked potato and salad"" but they gave him a classic cheeseburger. We had to repeatly ask for condiments like Ketchup/sriracha. The bills were divided incorrectly and she had to double check on drink orders. It seemed that the whole restaurant was dysfunctional from the server, kitchen, and management. I definitely won't be going back.  Bottom line: my group agreed that we would have been better off going to Applebee's or Red Robin."
Kiki M.,"Seattle, WA",145,449,6,3.0,7/15/2009,"Okay, so this is a chain restaurant and the name makes me giggle every time I utter it but the food is palatable and the signature beer they serve is quite tasty. BJ's is this enormous building attached to Southcenter mall. Despite its mass which could be filled with corny decorations, it is simple. There is a bar that has happy hour from 3:00 to 7:00 every day and a late night happy hour Sunday through Thursdays. Happy hour specials include $1 off all draft beer, $2 off appetizers, and half off mini pizzas.  I've been to BJ's a few times now and I attempt to try something new each visit. That isn't a hard goal to achieve because the menu is the size of the Bible. Food choices range from pizza (all deep dish), salads, burgers, sandwiches, and pasta. There is even a separate drink menu as thick as the one for food. Plenty of mixed drinks, BJ's speciality brewed beer and favorites like Bud Light and Stella.  The beers are excellent. I've had a sampler and was impressed with each selection. My favorite was their version of an Irish Red. It was smooth and bit you at the end with the hops and I must not fail to mention it had a higher than normal alcohol content.  Foodwise I have only been disappointed once. I ordered a calzone and while the crust was delicious the inside which consisted of vegetables was lacking. There was more dough than vegetables. Another time I had a pasta with tomatoes, garlic, and basil which was good considering the source. My most favorite dish I've had at BJ's is the avocado egg rolls. Avocados are wrapped in egg rolls paper and deep fried. Oh my god. I haven't met anything deep fried I didn't like and this is no exception. A sweet dipping sauce accompanies the egg rolls which heightens the flavor. Excuse me while I clean up the drool from my keyboard. Just thinking about those damn things makes my mouth water. All you food snobs need to check yourselves before you wreck yourselves and try BJ's. We all get cravings for huge obscene chain restaurants. When it hits, get your ass to BJ's."
Nick L.,"Federal Way, WA",61,43,80,2.0,9/8/2012,"No wonder the place is empty at 6 pm on a Saturday, the service is really lacking, missing orders and food missing items like sauce, and food coming out wrong."
Austin M.,"Renton, WA",1,1,,5.0,8/30/2014,Deep-dish pizza's are to die for! Service is sometimes slow but well worth the wait. I always order the cheeseburger pizza which sounds bizarre but is delicious!
Kristin C.,"Issaquah, WA",312,689,30,4.0,9/26/2009,"The food is a 5 star, but the service is more like a 2, so 4 seems fair. It's been awhile since 5th grade, but I think that's how averages work.  I hate how far away this location is. But whenever I am at South Center, or going mini golfing at Family Fun Center, we like to stop in here for lunch or dinner. I used to eat at BJ's in Fresno, CA and I always found it mediocre. I tried the pizza, and the baked potato, and burgers. They were all good, but nothing really impressed me enough to order it again.  When I came to this location for the first time though I ordered the french dip sandwich with the shoestring fries. It was love at first bite. The french dip was amazing. Obviously not the best I have ever had, but good enough that I like to order it whenever I come here. And the shoestring fries were AMAZING. They are some of my favorite fries anywhere.  The real reason to come here though. The Pizookie. Oh, you don't know what a Pizookie is? You better go to BJ's to find out.... NOW! Hurry up, go. I'll wait.  Did you have it? Wasn't it amazing? I love a fresh, warm, gooey cookie covered in ice cream. My favorite is the Ghiradelli. With chocolate cookie with chocolate chips, covered in chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce and a Ghiradelli chocolate on top. Yum!  They have a good beer selection to, a mix of their own brews, and popular beers like Blue Moon or Manny's. They have a lot of rotating handles too, which is nice.  This place can get busy on weekend nights, obviously. Either don't go friday or saturday night, or be prepared to wait.  Also, don't go hoping to watch the Sounders game, because they are very anti-supporting local teams. They have 10 tvs, and like 3 of them were showing one NCAA football game, but that wasn't enough so they changed the 1 tv showing the Sounders game to more NCAA football. Lovely. I know this is a chain, but you still need to be supporting local teams, especially when you have so many tv's showing the same sports game already. Plus, management told us ""oh, we didn't think anyone was watching the game"" Even though we were never asked if we were, and it was obvious that we were because why else would we be sitting in our booth at an odd angle to watch a tv that is outside and open the blinds on the window? lame."
Adam Z.,"Edmonds, WA",27,43,4,5.0,9/13/2011,"I'll start by saying this; BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants/bars. We go here a lot for lunch and after work. They have their own micro beers that are $3 from like noon till 7pm with a seasonal and a rotating tap. They also have all sorts of other beers but I really like the Piranha that BJ's makes. It's an amber but it's a little hoppy like an IPA. Also during March Madness, or I guess anytime, they have 6 giant TV screens in the bar for all the sports watching you can handle. Anyways, they have a killer lunch menu. What I get 80% of the time is the half sandwich and soup/salad combo. Comes with soup/salad first then a pretty good size sandwich and with a bunch of fries for $8. Prettaaaa, Prettaaa, Pretty good deal. The servers are super nice and the bartenders are great as well."
Marcie C.,"Renton, WA",10,224,5,2.0,2/16/2010,"We stopped here for lunch on Valentine's Day to fuel up after shopping at Southcenter (along with a billion other people, I swear). We were in the mood for pizza and thought we'd give them a shot. We were seated in the outdoor-like area (kinda like a green house). Our table and chairs had water spilled all over them, so they had to wipe it down for us. Our waitress was not reall ""on the ball"" and seemed to forget a lot of stuff. We both ordered small pizzas. I had the Sweet Pig (Hawaiian) and it tasted like it was missing some essential spices. Just kinda blah. And the ham was like luncheon meat. And there wasn't a lot of cheese. The pizza didn't really sit well with me after I ate it. The good things were the rootbeer was mighty tasty. So was the cookie thing for dessert and the crust on my pizza. And they had the olympics on."
Kristine A.,"Renton, WA",97,43,2,2.0,11/9/2011,"Maybe it's just me, but everytime I go here they ALWAYS mess up on my order. Pizookies are the reason why I go here."
Nancy B.,"Hudson, OH",137,446,1662,5.0,7/29/2009,"Take Out Review: How many places can you order a BJ online for $10 at 10:30 PM?  BJ Burger that is :-)! The car side service ends at 9 PM, but the helpful takeout staff did a great job of packaging everything by my special requests (entered online).  Since this is a 30 min drive from home I asked for the burger and dressings to be segregated and it worked out great! Hubby had the sourdough cheddar bacon cheese burger.  The patty is VERY large, tasty with good char.  The bread is better than Jack in the Box, but the same sourdough toast problem... juicy burger + soft bread = race to the sog! Wedge salad came with a nice blue cheese dressing, lots of back crumbles, diced tomato chunks, red onion slivers and blue cheese crumbles. The meatloaf dinner is HUGE... easily 3 meals worth of meat slices and mounding mashed potato goodness. Can't wait to try them in person text time!"
James R.,"Orting, WA",0,2,,3.0,8/10/2014,"Awesome food, I love the bjs restaurant chain. Idk if tonight was particularly busy or what but it seemed like from the minute we sat down we had to compete to have our waiters attention. My girlfriend and I skipped the 10 min wait to be seated and sat in the bar area and had to wave down a waitress to inform her we existed..... Which I understand.... And our waiter came immediately up to us. But after every order it seem like it took forever for us to get our drinks, food, main course...... He apologized everytime he came back to us.... But we could see our drink order be placed and made, then sit at the bar for 5 minutes before it was brought to us.... Kind of annoying. Foods/drinks are great, service not so much..... Maybe it was a bad night but walking a drink 10ft from a bar to a table doesn't seem very difficult....."
Jon L.,"Renton, WA",139,269,53,3.0,5/27/2012,"Selection is great.  Food is so so.  And the service is okay at best.  Your average American restaurant.  The location plays a winning role, attached to Westfield Center"
