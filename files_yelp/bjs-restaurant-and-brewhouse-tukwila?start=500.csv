Allie S.,"Bellevue, WA",388,447,36,4.0,6/17/2009,"I went out for BJ's with my cousin today. Teehee. Sorry, I'm immature. We had about a 20-minute wait 'til we could get seated, because they were slammed. No problem, it was a nice day to sit outside and enjoy the good weather... so, menus in hand, we chillaxed outside and concluded what we wanted to eat. We settled on the mini size of the buffalo chicken pizza (no onions) with a side Caesar salad. I also had one of their homebrewed cream sodas. I love Caesar salads, and this is one of the best tasting dressings I've had from a restaurant in a long time -- it's not ""authentic,"" but it's damn tasty. The croutons are perfectly seasoned for my taste. The pizza itself reminded me of a ""personal pan pizza"" from Pizza Hut -- a favorite of mine -- the same greasy fluffy crusty delight, but topped with some of my favorite things ever: buffalo chicken with celery and ranch [I prefer blue cheese but my little cousin wanted ranch and the default is ranch, so I went with it. But if you're buying me buffalo wings in the future please note I want blue cheese :)]. The mini and a side salad were enough to fill two relatively hungry girls quite well. I look forward to returning to try some of their stuffed potatoes..."
Benjon P.,"Seattle, WA",42,61,1,3.0,8/13/2012,"had a great experience here!  the burger melt was delicious, and i had two pitchers one was the golden ale they had on special, tasted like blue moon and the other was a really light one which was just ok for me. i also tried the beignet for dessert, while it was tasty, it was a little overpriced for me.  great service, great ambience, i'll be back again!"
Jordan S.,"Seattle, WA",19,123,27,1.0,5/8/2011,"I hate doing this, but I must. They've pissed me off and are 0 for 2 now. So, here we go... Basically; service sucks hard, food sucks hard, and prices suck the hardest of all. First time I was here I start off with a BJ's porter. When it got to me about fifteen minutes later, it tasted flat. Like it was getting down to the end of the keg or something I dunno, but it was gross. I replaced my beer another fifteen minutes later with one that seemed just fine. After ordering food, blackened salmon for me, I decided to order another drink just in case it was going to take forever again. It did. I got it just as I finished my first. So now the food comes and I'm given a piece of fish thats seriously no bigger than the coaster my beer was on. Very disappointed in the reflection of the price in the meal. Second time we go its to watch the Canucks play. Theres basketball on every TV except one and I ask if we can sit in that section since its almost empty. The girl says no. Who the hell says no to a customer??? I should have walked out then. So we sit down and I, after about ten minutes, get one of the million TVs playing BB changed to hockey. The plan was to chill and just snack on appetizers as we watch the game. But as I found out that was quickly out the window. The appetizers are all damn near the price of the entrees! So we decide to get meals instead. I got a small calzone, and I shoulda just brought a hot pocket for them to microwave for me. Generic, small, and with no sides. It was a glorified $10 hot pocket.  Two friends got a pizza and it came out with NO TOPPINGS! Then the server just says oops and brings out a plate full of pepperoni and crap. I'm thinking, ""Yeah cause thats how you make a pizza normally"". I woulda sent it back but they just dealt with it. Your time is much better spent at Joey's across the way. At least when you go there you get what you pay for (killer drinks and food) and you get to look at pretty girls the whole time."
Richard B.,"Ketchum, ID",7,20,,4.0,1/25/2010,"I'd meant to try this place ever since it opened, since it's name is rampant with sexual innuendo and I hadn't heard of it before this place opened. Who's BJ anyway?  Decided to meet here with some friends for the playoff game a couple of weeks ago and was impressed with the upscale look of the interior and the huge screen above the bar. Huge! It is a new place after all, and it doesn't scrimp on electronics.  They make their own beer which is cheaper than any of their other tap beers and it's pretty good...at least the red that I had. Strong too...7% I think. They also have a very large selection of Belgian ales and other beers on tap that really surprised me! Had no idea this place offered such a beer selection.  As another reviewer mentioned, the menu IS like a bible. Long, with a lot of choices. I had a hamburger on sourdough. Not too impressed with the burger. Kind of bleh, but okay. We had some potato skins too, which weren't great and not very hot. We sat at the bar and service from the Bartender was pretty good. Especially since it was a playoff game day and he certainly didn't leave me lacking for beer!  I'm giving it 4 stars for the upscale sports bar interior, the extensive beer selection, and pretty good service. I AM a fan.  Not sure about the food yet. The hamburger and skins weren't that great, but we'll see at the next visit.  Great place BJ.  Say.....did you really think through that name?"
Doug T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",169,181,29,4.0,5/13/2009,"For a very good appetizer try the spinach and artichoke with a combo tortilla  chips and  garlic bread vs. just tortilla chips.  Not on the regular menu but can be manually punched in by the waitress.  Worked for the three of us plus was just the right amount  with our favorite BJ's beers. For the entree we ordered a large pepporoni deep dish pizza with bacon.  A little on the salty side but favored by Erik T with a couple of slices to spare for a midnight ""snack"". For desert we tried the new or at least new to us oreo pizzookie which was really good.  Of course, as the father, I had to try it first to make sure the restaurant wasn't poisioning us.  Needless to say  we were not poisoned but I got first dibs with my lame excuse."
Michael K.,"Inverness, FL",11,23,27,4.0,7/8/2012,I would return. Had pasta rotini with blackened chicken. Sauce had broc bits and not too creamy. Nice flavor and texture. Location at Westfield mall Clwr fl. I went on a Sunday and it was fairly busy. Service was pretty good.
Chen wei L.,"San Francisco, CA",29,4,,4.0,7/6/2012,The food was good. Service is ok. Price is good for the quantity and the quality of the food.
Kevin S.,"Kent, WA",6,19,6,4.0,11/10/2011,"My wife and I eat here often. Good food, reasonably priced (especially the weekday lunch specials), good service. The atmosphere is nice; not too dark not too bright, not too big or too small, and you feel comfortable in jeans or slacks. I'd have given it 5 stars but their menu is like a Websters dictionary."
Mimi L.,"San Jose, CA",53,74,,5.0,4/12/2010,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area!  The pizzas here are soo amazingly good!  My favorites so far are the sweet pig (which is basically a hawaiian with seasoned tomatoes) and great white (which is kind of like a chicken alfredo pizza).  I've also tried the southwestern but didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  You can also create your own pizza by choosing your own toppings which is really awesome because you can custom it to whatever you like! I've tried a few other menu items, but everything else I tried was very mediocre, so everytime I come back I just get one of the pizzas because they are consistently good.  I want to try more of their menu, but I'm always tempted to order pizza because of my bad experience with the other food there. The service here is decent, it's not extraordinary but I don't really have any complaints either.  One thing that is absolutely amazing is their dessert though... the pizookie is a fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top and it seriously is the best dessert I've ever had... there are times I come here just because I crave the pizookie so much!  And if you watch a movie at AMC Southcenter on the same day, save your ticket stub and show it to your waiter and you can get a free pizookie with your meal! So this is definitely a place that I keep going back to... especially if I'm seeing a movie!  Their pizza and pizookie give them 5 stars! :)"
Bill N.,"Auburn, WA",35,263,,3.0,3/18/2012,"We were at the mall for an afternoon movie and we saw the sign for their $5.95 special lunch. I thought it sounded cheaper than the food court.   They only had 2 things for $5.95- quesadillas or tacos.   I went with the chicken quesadillas and Jess had the tacos.  When they came out, they did not look like the pictures in the menu.  Much smaller and I didn't get any sour cream.  Joe didn't want either of those so he went with a $12 jalapeno hamburger.  It was excellent but it was $12.  plus drinks,.... and tip......it ended up a lot more expensive than the food court."
John J.,"Bellevue, WA",42,47,,1.0,3/24/2013,"Went here for my son's birthday.  It's been his favorite place to go for his birthday for years.  Tonight: How disappointing. The place was fairly busy as we arrived, though that busyness tapered off after about an hour.  The booth where we sat was our customary booth - things were really looking good for us as we settled in, ordered our apps and drinks, and watched some March Madness coverage. Things began to fall apart when the appetizers arrived and we realized that no appetizer plates had been brought out.  We asked for them, and the young gent bounced off as if eager to get them for us.  We gnoshed on our teasers for about 5 minutes before we noticed he'd not returned.  Irony:  As my son finished the last potato skin, our server showed up with 5 plates... which she absent-mindedly set next to the three empty appetizer plates - unable to recognize that they were no longer needed. Order taken, we sat and watched our games a bit longer.  The server returned and placed my side salad directly in front of me.  Asked if I needed anything else, and sauntered off before I could point out that I had no silverware.  Raised index fingers and excuse mes didn't stop the next 5 servers who passed by.  One of them eventually stopped, looked at my table, then kept on going as if unable to recognize that a) I really needed help, and b) that something was missing.  Another stood in the server station watching me as I looked to my plate full or Caesar Salad and began picking at it with my bare fingers.  He, like the others, disappeared without fixing the problem.  Eventually, our flight attendant/server returned and asked if all was well... as if my still full plate of salad wasn't indication enough... and I asked politely for a roll of silverware.  She said, ""Sure thing!""  And poofed again.  10 minutes passed.  A short Hispanic woman walked by with a tray full of silverware and started loading up the empty tables with fresh settings.  I had to go and try, through her broken English, to explain that I needed 5 settings worth.  Just as I got the rolls I required and returned to my table, the server appeared with 5 more rolls of silverware and a comment, ""Oh?  Decided not to eat it with your fingers?  Glad you got that sorted out."" And took off again. As I predicted, the food arrived moments after my first hunger-driven bite of now wilted and soggy salad.  Drink refills were slow to follow.  We ended up staying nearly 2 hours to finish our meal and get out.  Note:  Our formerly absent server was anxious to bring our check, make sure we paid our bill quickly, and attentive to ensure we cleared out quickly so she could get the table ready for someone new. Side notes:   - The manager was standing in the station next to our table as we complained about the service.  He heard me, looked up, frowned, and then stalked off.  No apology.  No attempt to make it right.  And nothing taken off the check. - We mentioned my son's birthday to the server.  No mention was made of his special occasion the rest of the meal.  When presented with our check, we were offered the ""upsell"" on dessert, but not the complimentary birthday comp that usually is a no-brainer at BJ's.  My son was actually angry that she'd forgotten - asked me not to make a big deal about it though. - The bathrooms were filthy.  Clearly they had not been attended to in hours. - As I walked out, I took note of the light fixtures.  All of them had caked on dust bunnies on the tops... especially on the cables hanging them from the ceilings.  This had me questioning the cleanliness of the entire restaurant. We've decided we won't be returning to the Tukwila restaurant any time soon.  We may try one of their other locations, because we like the food and the hand-crafted root beer.  But for now, Tukwila is a no-go."
Michael J.,"Seattle, WA",75,175,71,5.0,3/17/2010,"I was at this place on 3-13-10.  To be honest with you, this place deserves more than 5 stars. This place is huge, clean, & classy. One of the best sports bar & restaurants in king county IMO.  The hosts there aren't great, but hey they do their job, so that's basically all you can ask right? They are accommodating & adequate.  Our waiter was Mrs. Lopez. She provided great service to me & my guests, & was everything we could ask for from a waitress. Very courteous, quick with getting food & drinks to us, & attentive.  BJ's @ Southcenter has booths you can be seated in when you are in the main dining area. The bar area has pacman booths, regular booths, mini tables, or the bar itself where you can be seated at. I chose the mini tables, which were a great choice for the bar area. The bar area also has a massive HDTV display, & theres no way you can miss a game from anywhere you're seated. Not to mention there are plenty of flat screens in the main dining area that always have a game/sports on.  The restrooms, are clean & don't smell, & aren't cluttered with garbage, etc everywhere.  The food itself is great. I had the half pound angus burger, & man did it taste good! I would also recommend that people try the chicken pot stickers. Both are tasty, & very good. The drinks are pricey but very good.  Also take note they are quick with getting your food to you quick, & still hot. Can't ask for more than that.  It can get pricey at this place, but the service, food, & environment I experienced made it well worth spending my money at. I left satisfied, & I'd recommend this place to anyone."
Mike M.,"Tacoma, WA",21,73,111,1.0,6/21/2012,Been here an hour and still no food awesome. Probably the slowest place that I have ever been. The waitress was over stressed. Doubt that I will be back. Red Robin is the same and it is cheaper with faster service.
Kel M.,"Seattle, WA",25,101,212,3.0,6/10/2012,"A busy sports bar/restaurant atmosphere with good food and service.  Everyone should try their pizookie dessert at least once-- a rich dessert, but sooo good."
Kelsey K.,"Renton, WA",52,9,,1.0,12/14/2013,"BJ's has good food, no doubt, but their service is absolutely ridiculous. My fiancé and I sat down, ordered an appetizer and our waitress started rushing us to order our meal. Finally we did, waited about 20 minutes, I start eating my chicken limone pasta only to realize that there is no sauce on my pasta! We couldn't track down our waitress, and finally found another server who said she would grab a side of the sauce for me. Finally our waitress came by and we told her about the no sauce, she was incredibly unapologetic and brushed us off. Five minutes later I received my sauce and as I was mixing it in and realized I had about two pieces of spinach--despite the menu stating it was on a ""bed of spinach"". My fiancé was completely done with his meal, I hadn't even started! I finally track downy waitress and ask for a manager. The manager finally came over, I told her my pasta plight, and without an apology asked of she wanted them to remake it. I laughed. I told her no, and she said ""we'd really like it if you stayed"". Sorry, no, we paid for our appetizer and pizza and went to Chipotle for dinner. The manager and waitress did not care about their service at all, and I definitely won't be returning anytime soon."
megan W.,"Bellevue, WA",10,6,,5.0,10/15/2011,"My brother works here, so I have to review, one of my favorite dishes is the Southwestern pizza, I lalways start out with the avocado egg rolls which amazing!! I finish with warm googeyness, yes Im talking about the pazookie, i looove the red velvet. Stop by on a weekday, and ask for Quinn!"
Gretchlyn K.,"Seattle, WA",4,24,,4.0,5/7/2014,"I been here twice in one week. The food is a hit and miss. I absolutely love their stuffed mushrooms, that is the main reason I wanted to go today. The steak I had the first time I came, it was way tooo salty. The pulled pork sandwich I had was absolutely fabulous, it was ohhh so good, makes me want to go back soon. The service is very attentive, and so far is my favorite out of all the Southcenter resteraunts, although I want to try Blue C Sushi and Joey before I make a final decision."
Sam F.,"Kirkland, WA",1,5,,5.0,11/17/2012,"Been eating at many BJ's restaurants over the years and I've always loved the food and beer here. Vast menu and lots of choices for all diets. It may not be super NW style here and that's why I think it's gotten some iffy reviews. The beer is just fine and their guest tap is usually awesome. The pizza and pizookie is to die for. And if the service isn't too good, deal with it, the food is worth the trouble."
All S.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,3.0,3/24/2014,"Worst customer service ever. We came in and there were no utensils on our table. We waited forever before we got our drinks. It took forever to get our food. We were served our food and still didn't have our utensils, we had to ask for them. Food was alright. Waitress was super clueless."
Roger M.,"Spanaway, WA",1,14,,2.0,6/27/2015,Went today for dinner. Our waiter Jonathon took our drink order and brought them quickly.  He took our order right away.  Then it started to go down hill.  It took a long time for our order to come out.   After we got our food our waiter came over after several minutes and asked if everything tasted ok.  Then he disappeared   I did notice he enjoyed standing by the bar just talking to other employees.  He did walk by our table three times but did not stop.  I needed more tea and my son wanted another soda.  After we were done. We had to find him to get our check.  When he brought the credit card receipt back for signature. This pen did not work. So I said well the waiter doesn't work it is only fitting his pen doesn't either. So. He did not get a tip nor signature.  This was sad because we eat at the South Hill location 2 or 3 times a month and get great service.  This location gets two stars only because the food was good.
