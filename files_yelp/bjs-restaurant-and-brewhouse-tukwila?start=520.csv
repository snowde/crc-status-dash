Linda K.,"Seattle, WA",8,61,11,2.0,3/6/2010,Here with a big group. We did everything right pre ordered food and all. After 1 hour still no food. Turns out they didn't actually put the order in until about 40 minutes after we arrived!  The organizer seniorita of the group took the manager aside and we got 50% discount which is why these guys got two stars.
Mike F.,"Tacoma, WA",0,34,,4.0,5/26/2014,"Have been there twice in the last couple of weeks. I have had salmon both times and it has been fine for a reasonable price. My family has eaten a balsamic chicken which they really liked and a burger. Met my cousins family who also liked their food and they handled our party of eight fine. No complaints, nice looking place."
Melanie W.,"Renton, WA",33,7,,3.0,5/3/2010,"For what it is it's fine. What it is is a big American restaurant in a mall parking lot with a large menu of average-priced food. It has no specialty it has no distinct ambience, it's just a generic restaurant with generic food that everyone can enjoy. I went with a couple friends who eat there often.  If you're invited by friends or have a picky eater who only likes restaurants like these, it's a nice place to go, but if you're looking for somewhere fun and inventive I would try anywhere else."
Rey M.,"Seattle, WA",6,64,,4.0,2/7/2009,"A month back me and my wife came down to BJs. We had a great time. I couldn't stop talking about how good the pizza was.The following 3 weeks I've been pestering my wife to come back to BJs for a second go. I fell in love with there Chicago style deep crust pizza. Since my initial visit I started seeing all these shows on the tube in regards to Chicago dining and guess what, its always talking about there pizzas. Well we finally made it back this evening. This time with the kids.  BJs is a great establishment, plenty of seating and a huge bar. Did I mention that it has this huge TV showcasing 6 different sporting events in one screen. All the TV's in the restaurant can be seen from any booth or table through out. Its nice to be able to come here with your family and still able to catch glimpse of different sporting events. Not having it being limited to only the bar.  The menu had plenty to choose from. As far as appetizers go, there was nothing that I haven't seen before. Your typical artichoke dip, buffalo wings, some variety of an egg roll.... But what was different is that they had a bake potato section. Believe me, some of the sizes of these potatoes coming out of the kitchen were huge. You cant help but notice it when a waiter passes by your table ready to serve one. We finally ordered one on our second go. Delicious.  We have yet to try anything else from the menu besides the pizza and different appetizers but rest assure, the pizza alone warrants a visit. Around my area this is the only place that serves Chicago Style pizza that I can think of. I know of a few near downtown. Also they have a great selection of drinks here. They brew there own beer and have 7 to choose from. Lastly let me mention there Pizookie. Its short for Pizza Cookie. As they do it in Chicago, its a cookie baked in a small pan then served fresh out of the oven hot with a nice serving of ice cream to top it off. Oh its sooooo good! Make sure you save room for dessert.  Overall this is a nice place to either take a group of friends, family or your significant other and enjoy a wonderful meal. The price is not that bad. For a dinner with us and our 2 kids, we spent just a little above 50$. And that's with drinks. The menu has plenty to choose from. The wait is never long. The staff was great and service was very prompt. The drinks that they brew here directly is nice. Let me leave my review and just say: Order the Pizza!"
Betty D.,"Dublin, CA",177,246,395,4.0,12/4/2008,"They have a whole variety of stuff for under $6 if you order off the lunch menu perfect for one person. My boss shut down our office...yes just for me...and took us here for my going away party. We had about 20 people and were in and out in about less than two hours. Service was up to par for a big party. It was pretty busy too since it was lunch time. Always had good service here. To start off: Chicken wings. Pretty tasty. Santa Fe Spring Rolls and their crispy thin pizza appetizer is pretty good. I like the fresh basil with Italian sausage. Prefect size for lunch!  Clam chowder was rich and creamy and delicious!  For an entree try the PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKEN served with mashed potatoes.  GRILLED CHICKEN PASTA with rotelle noodles with their rich cream sauce and steamed brocolli. I usually ask for a side of their sauce because they don't put a lot on the pasta and i like my pasta's creamy...even though my stomach will argue with me. And for dessert you have to try the TRIPLE CHOCOLATE PIZOOKIE® FEATURING GHIRARDELLI! It is to die for and melts in your mouth. I'm not a sweets person but this is totally delish. Gauranteed or your money back!!...well, from me. hahaha."
Meredith M.,"Minneapolis, MN",79,36,2,4.0,2/28/2010,"This is based on delivery, I ordered through South King County Restaurant Delivery Guide - 2GoServices. I was reading through the 2GoServices restaurants available for delivery to my hotel and then also comparing those restaurants to Yelp reviews (thanks Yelp!) I settled on BJ's, (teehee), because they had the most selection that I could trust having never been there before. Well, the delivery was great...the packaging kept my cold food cold and hot food hot. My house salad was crunchy and had a nice roll with it, too.  I also had the rotini pasta w/sauce and it was cheesy and zesty with nicely grilled chicken and crunchy, bright green steamed broccoli, very yummy! The delivery person was great, but I think he was from the 2GOServices, but came right up to my hotel room door.  If you're looking for delivery from 2GoServices and you're in the SeaTac area, yes it does take an hour, but the food is hot and served pleasantly!"
Carollynn Z.,"Poulsbo, WA",17,8,6,1.0,4/13/2012,"I would give it a 0.5 if I could but the lowest available is 1. This is the second worst restaurant experience I have ever had; a close second to my worst restaurant experience where the waiter was on drugs and the chef was drunk. At least the food was good at BJ's when it finally got to use 1 1/2 hours later and the waiter was nice just totally overwhelmed. We were with a large group and had a reservation. The restaurant knew that our party would have 40 to 50 people. We had one waiter with a little bit of extra help. It took about 90 minutes to get our food, and another 90 minutes before we got our bills. Some people in our party were there for 3 1/2 hours total.  Although the waiter seemed totally inept, I think it was more to do with procedures, training and inefficiencies. The protocols for taking orders and getting our checks seemed very cumbersome and not user friendly to the wait staff. Here are some other things that seemed due to poor training and management issues: 1. There were a lot of waiters around but our large group only had the one waiter and a little help from some other waiters at times. Poor planning for a large group. 2. Waiters were scurrying back and forth from the kitchen/bar with only one or two dishes. They never seemed to carry more than one order at a time. 3. Combine number 2 with the fact that we were in a very long room with only one door at one end, the wait staff had to make a long trek from wherever they had to go to get food and drink to tables at the far end of the room. Those waiters spent 85% of their time walking and 15% of their time actually helping the diners. 4. Several of us at the table did not have utensils or napkins. One of us asked a passing waiter, not our own waiter, to get us all some forks, napkins, etc. The waiter came back with only one set for 7 people. We had to request service for the rest of us and it took another trip to make that happen.  5. We sat for at least 30 minutes before we even got water. And another 30 minutes before we got our drinks.  6. When the checks finally got to us, there were multiple mistakes and an automatic 17% gratuity added in.  The only good thing was that the food was hot and tasty when it got too us. Or maybe we were so hungry by that time we would have eaten anything."
Johnnie L.,"Renton, WA",88,60,53,2.0,12/16/2009,Went here for the late night happy hour. The place was pretty nice overall with a large bar. Wasn't that busy but the service was great. The food on the other hand was just ok. Thier late night happy hour menu was very limited to just mini pizzas and $2 off appetizers. Might give it another try for drinks and watching games. They have a huge screens. So I went back another time just to give it another try. The food was not very good. We had tried over 6 different things and nothing stands out. I more than likely will not be back.
Philip L.,"Seattle, WA",3,13,2,3.0,8/30/2009,"So one of my buddies was heading off to med school, and a few us got together to have BJ's for the first time......sorry, couldn't resist! When I walked in, it reminded of many other brew houses that I have been to numerous times. Being a fan of hearty American cuisine with ice cold signature beers, I was excited for the meal. After we had all arrived and had a good long solid conversation, the waiter finally decided to ask us for our orders. The ensuing wait for the drinks and food was another long wait. I was rather surprised because this was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was pretty quiet. The waiter then followed up his already subpar performance by mixing up our beers and spilling some on the table. I'm usually a stickler on service so this might be a slight overreaction on my part, but I appreciate a basic level. The food and beer was actually pretty good. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger pizza (yes, I felt like splurging for a day) and it really tasted like a bacon cheeseburger on a Chicago-style deep dish pizza. The flavor was outstanding and the amount of food was definitely worth the price. Although my palate felt like an oil slicked road by the end of the meal, I couldn't have really expected otherwise. Overall, the experience wasn't great, but the food was pretty good. I'm not sure if I will go back simply because I appreciate outstanding service, but if you are getting tired of going to your normal brewhouse, it might be worth it to give BJ's a try."
Veronica A.,"Port Orchard, WA",9,141,29,4.0,11/11/2009,"As for BJ's...I'd give them 3 stars as far as their food..but I'm giving them 4 stars this time around all because of one waitress. Her name is Maria! She by far is one of my top servers on my list! Very sweet and attentive!!!! She wasn't one of those ""bitchy"" servers that throw things on your table, or ask you if you need anything when in reality they don't really feel like serving you...or the ones that dont care to smile or make eye contact. This server was wonderful! She always made sure we were taken care of. 5 stars for you Maria!!! EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!!!! As for the food. Bleh. I like their jambalaya...and of course their pazookis you can never go wrong! They just melt in your mouth. Their chicken wings...NOT A FAN! they fry their chicken wings and just drizzle the buffalo sauce partially on the wings. Loaded baked potatoes are okay. Talk about all those carbs! Their deep dish pizzas are good and very filling. Sandwiches are okay. Parking blows at the mall."
Trisha F.,"Kent, WA",5,12,5,4.0,1/27/2012,My husband and I love coming here. On this lovely night we decided to share a plate of the Texas chicken fried steak :( :( DON'T EVER order this EVER!! Unless you love salt. Maybe it was a bad night for Mr. Chef because he couldn't even pull off steamed veggies without it tasting like pure salt... This made me very sad. Now for the bright side..... Our waitress Madeline was absolutely AMAZING! The cutest little thing with a great personality and very attentive. They took our steak off of bill and gave me a much needed and refreshing salad on the house. Soo with that said we still are fans of this place but will NEVER order that again and u shouldn't either.
Brandon G.,"Seattle, WA",124,51,,5.0,3/14/2009,"This place gets a 5 star boost from me.  They have a great happy hour - 2 dollars off apps, dollar off drafts and 1/2 off their mini deep dish pizzas.  We went there with a group on a Friday for happy hour and the bar was full.  The manager accommodated us by giving us a table and extended to us the happy hour.  Server was attentive and friendly.  The pizza's were fantastic - deep dish, perfectly crispy on the outside (super greasy though) and quite airy and porous for a deep dish making it not too heavy on the crust side.  Wish they didn't put tomatoes on every pizza though.  Some other good ones include the avocado egg rolls and potstickers.  Avoid the wings.  They have a great selection of 42 beers on tap but I was more impressed by the Belgian bottled selection which is a real gem. Cheers!"
Richard B.,"Duvall, WA",56,62,6,5.0,11/24/2011,"If you ask and expect great service and know what you want, this place is awesome! Sham is an excellent server."
Amanda D.,"Seattle, WA",15,13,,5.0,4/20/2012,"Bj's house hefeweizen is my FAVORITE BEER in the world!! I go to Bj's just for that beer. Also - Get to know the bar manager. He's super nice, and he throws ""beer tasting"" dinners once in a while, with about 5 courses and tons of beer for $60 a person.....its really a fantastic deal considering how drunk and full you get! This place is a 5-star must go!"
Katie H.,"Federal Way, WA",93,18,18,4.0,2/6/2010,"I really like this place. I've been a couple times, the first time I sat at the bar and had appetizers and drinks. Our bartender Christian was the best and took great care of us the whole night. I had the avocado egg rolls and they were delicious! The second time I went I opted to get the egg rolls again for an appetizer and split a club sandwich with my husband. It was all really good. I also had to try the pear (hard)cider because I had never had it before. It was really good but REALLY sweet, nice for one glass but I prefer to drink something a little less sweet if I'm going to have more than one.  I will probably be back soon. I think next time I will choose to go later at night and just sit at the bar. When we were seated out in the restaurant it was really busy and took a while for our server to get back to us. It was clear that he was really busy and he always made a point to let us know he would be available shortly. So if you go on a weekend during the day expect a crowd. Good service Good fun! I will be back soon."
Rachel B.,"Seattle, WA",5,33,2,4.0,4/14/2011,"Delicious food, especially the pizza! Pleasant atmosphere. I ordered a mojito, and it was good, but they specialize in many different kinds of beer and lager. I suppose, you'd have to like beer to fully appreciate the restaurant, but if you're going for food alone, it's still an enjoyable experience. Pricing is average. Won't break your wallet. It's in a convenient location."
Travis W.,"Federal Way, WA",77,60,16,4.0,4/5/2011,"I Like this place. Lots of good beer on tap, great pizza and appetizers. They usually have several games playing on the TVs. The servers and bartenders have always been great. Worth the stop."
Nancy H.,"Seattle, WA",83,248,163,3.0,8/19/2009,"What goes with beer? Really rich fatty food... I had a good time here. The rootbeer was amazing. Probably the best tasting root beer next to sarsasparilla that I've had! Appetizers are tasty. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with my dish: the California burger. It was more like a sandwich and gave me a headache. Also, a warning...their deep dish pizza is not authentic deep dish...it's a bumpy fat crust baked in a deep dish pan. Fortunately, they have a vast (and I mean Cheesecake Factory style) menu so there will be many opportunities for hits or misses. Good for: root beer, artichoke cheese dip"
Rob B.,"Redmond, WA",339,125,,2.0,7/31/2008,"Alright, so I was there during their week of training. Take that with a grain of salt... First off, the appetizers need work. The Santa-Fe Spring Rolls? AWESOME! The rest? ... meh. MEH I SAY! Now, they brew a bunch of beer, which is awesome and worth a star. They are all pretty tasty, and I don't even like beer. Plus, they have a million beers on tap.  We got some entrees that needed some work. A table-mate of ours got the BBQ sandwich. The fries that they served with it were these weird shriveled things that needed some work. The sandwich itself was too sweet and had that flavor of bottled BBQ. Sad! Another tablemate got one of their famous pizzas. They are all 'deep dish', which just means thick crust to these people. The sauce had a canned flavor, the chicken wasn't bad, but the dough itself, while made in-house it seemed, was super young with virtually no flavor. All and all, the pizza disappointed the hell out of me. The red onions weren't even cooked... My entree was a cobb salad. The best part of the salad was the actual bacon they put on it. The lettuce was a super small cut, hard to eat. Too much dressing (also tasted bought from a bottle), the avocado was turning colors, and the turkey was deli style force-formed. No egg, no 'non-traditional' additions like mushrooms or tomatoes or greenbeans. This was the most boring cobb-salad I have ever had. I don't even think it had blue cheese on it. In short, a star for their surprisingly delicious beer. Everything else blew chunks."
Michael B.,"Seattle, WA",26,75,9,4.0,9/18/2008,"Yea, its corporate.  Yea, its typical american fare.  Yea, its new.  Mind you I haven't been there on a busy night, when everything is crankin and mistakes are sure to be made, but I have been there twice, and both experiences have been really good.  Belly up to the bar with Far(r)en, who in a nonchelant way, will hook you up with some good brews, and honest news about the food.  Decor is nice, kinda typical upscale sportsbar.  Clean (really new place), big TV's with sports channels at all times (maybe put on Animal Planet for the kids sometime???)  and large comfy looking tables.    The beer is good!  Not GREAT, but good.  Favorites so far have been the stout and the red.  Its imperial stout, so not real bitter, but a good blend of coffee, chocolate, malt and a little more malt, with a smooth, creamy finish.  The red is nice, with a good balance of hops, wheat and malt, slightly sweet and clean finish. The other reason I like those two....over 8% alky content.  YEAAA BOYEEE!!  Most of thier beers finish clean, and have a similar quality, in that they are not lingering.  Good with food, but I'm not sure if I would choose their beer to just drink on its own.  But, for $3 a pint, I'll quaff one with lunch any day.   So far, I have only had lunch, which is a KILLER deal on weekdays.  Half sandwich (many choices), salad or BOWL of soup (3 choices), AND fries!!  How much would you pay for this amazing combo??  $12.95??  $9.95??  How about $6.95 my friends?!?  And how about $5.95 for a mini deep dish pizza with one topping AND a salad?!?!  MAMMA MIA!!   There are lots of other lunch specials too, ranging from six bucks up.   I had the california club sandwich, seved on fluffly, garlic bread style sourdough, lightly grilled, and stuffed with a grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado and some fancy sauce that eludes my memory.  I chose the skinny fries (warm, not hot) and a BOWL of the chili.  The sandwich was delish, the chili was very tasty with a nice level of spice (2*) and the fries were decent, but much better if they were piping hot.  But they probly were sitting in a bowl under a heat lamp for a while.  Sorry guys, I know the industry far to well.   The pizza was surprisingly good.  I'm a traditional, NY style pizza guy, and I really haven't found that crust that WOW's me in Seattle.  This deep dish crust was light and buttery, with a little cheese caramelized around the edges.  I had the BBQ chicken style for an extra charge, with red onions, roasted tomatoes, grilled chicken bits, BBQ sauce and fresh cilantro (LOVE IT).  I ate every bit with glee.  Even the wedge salad was good!  A big crisp wedge of iceberg, with blue chz dressing AND crumbles, diced tomatoes, red onion bits and crumbled bacon.  For 6 bucks (plus upcharge for BBQ chicken), cannot complain at all!!  I'd eat the pizza again, which says alot coming from this pizza snob's mouth.   The prices are ok for normal hours.  I'd suggest doing lunch or happy hours to check the place out, and decide for yourself if its worth it coming for dinner.  Me, I'll be there every monday, at the bar for lunch.  See ya there!"
