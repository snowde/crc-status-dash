AJ M.,"Seattle, WA",17,138,125,1.0,10/25/2010,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! DISAPPOINTING. Greeted and seated immediately by friendly hostesses.  Environment:  Loud atmosphere. Difficult to have any kind of conversation.  CLEANLINESS: Fair.  Overall okay, preoccupied tables still stood cluttered and dirty.  QUALITY OF SERVICE and ACCURACY OF ORDER: Extremely slow and poor!  Are hand in hand on this one. You have a better chance of winning the mega-millions lottery then either of these. We were greeted by our waiter ""Shay."" After that the courteous, friendly help and accuracy were gone. We ordered our drinks (Root beer) and some flat bread. He acknowledged the order. Flat bread never showed up. (A later excuse was given he did not hear us order it.) Two children's meals were ordered (a cheese burger and a hamburger). Both medium. We ensured this was heard and acknowledged. Ketchup on the side. (no condiments were on the tables.) Also ordered were the Pot roast and a BBQ Chicken Salad. Both burgers arrived - WELL DONE. The cheese burger - NO Cheese. Shay was flagged down, where he took the burger away and returned sometime later with the same burger and a piece of broken, unmelted cheese on it. The buns were dry and overcooked. Sticky rice - overcooked exterior and beyond al dente dry center. Ketchup requested, yet again. (I think the tomatoes were just being harvested as we did not see it and borrowed it from another occupied table.)  The BBQ Chicken Salad - bring a magnifying glass as it will be quite a chore searching out the small and few chicken pieces.  The pot roast. Well, the bottom of the plate had dried on food particles both seen and felt. The meal consisted of a large center portion of mashed potatoes, surrounded by very few vegetables. (3 of the 7 were very small baby carrots.) The meat and gravy itself was extremely salty.  We actually received another round of root beers as he, Shay, rapidly passed by.  The Blue Cheese dressing tasted as if it was spoiled.  OVERALL SERVICE:  At any time a request was made with Shay, to include our first order, he would walk away while we were still ordering.  With our plates placed at the serving end of our table, making what I thought would be an obvious sign, was not. After he passed by twice I asked for our bill, THREE TIMES, in between would you like dessert, another drink and I don't know what the 3rd mumbled thing said was. I reminded him the ketchup never arrived either and he began stammering some type of excuse and mid-sentence shuffled off toward the kitchen. Another 5 minutes passed when ""Kim"" the On-Duty manager arrived stating Shay had told her something was wrong but he had no idea what it was. I told her we would pay the entire bill and explain everything. She was professional and listened intently."
Otis D.,"Issaquah, WA",3,106,,2.0,11/6/2008,"I remeber BJ's really well from my SoCal days.  Mostly O.K. beers although the one in Brea had some really great brewers specials outside the regular line up.  Was hoping to catch up with an old friend. But I guess being mega-chain-i-fied isn't working.  Well I take that back, it is working  because it's a huge space that was totally full.  Good that they have some solid guest taps since the sampler set I got of the house brews only had 1 that I would want to drink a pint. As for the food, we tried a few appetizers since it was happy hour and they all really screamed, ""I came off the FSA truck to the freezer to the fryer to you.  I hope you enjoy the mass-produced experience.""  The hot wings in particular were a crime.  My blackened chicken sandwich was exactly as I remembered and that was the highlight of the evening.  But it was more for nostalgia than it being a blow away entree. I would probably still go here but only because I'm already at south center and I'd stick to the pizza (which is pretty damn good deep dish style) or sandwiches and the guest beers."
Claire B.,"Federal Way, WA",11,5,1,3.0,11/15/2013,"This place is ok for me, my only fave is their jambalaya, customer service basically just depends. But I prefer take out to avoid the long wait when it gets busy."
Sean B.,"Tacoma, WA",14,62,,4.0,11/12/2008,"My feelings on BJ's are quite mixed. I was initially thrilled the first time I went here - the root beer was amazing! Of course, having just dropped $500 on some amazingly cute new clothes I guess there was no way the day could be perfect. Our super friendly server brings out my personal pizza that I had ordered. Thank god I decided to cut in with a knife and fork. My cheesy, bready goodness was filled with pepperoni. So, I flag down our server who semi-graciously takes it back. Meanwhile my friends take to eating. Maybe it was just the lunch rush but by the time my new pizza was out my friends already had their bills. Needless to say, I was a bit peeved at this point and told them I really didn't want to make my friends sit here and watch me eat, and I'd rather not have it. So a few minutes later the manger comes over, she's super friendly, profusely apologizes and gives me a $20 gift card along with my meal for free. BJ's would have a pretty nasty review from me if not for their amazing customer recovery and what I later discovered was an excellent pizza."
Kelsey F.,"Bothell, WA",95,228,,4.0,9/11/2008,"Dining partner wanted to hit BJ's for dinner in a bad sort of way, and being the good person I am I finally relented.  I mean, hey, that means another yelp review for me, right? BJ's is like Gordon Biersch - part restaurant, part brewpub, part chain.  Where I feel BJ's wins out over Gordon Biersch is the variety of brews - not only do they have seven regular beers (plus a seasonal beer, currently an Oktoberfest brew, as would be the norm for this time of year) but they also have hard cider and some sodas - rootbeer, cream soda, and a cherry soda if I remember correctly.  (I know the first two are right.)  On top of all of that is a massive list of ""outside"" beers they serve...and when I mean massive, I mean massive.  They're out to compete with Tap House, apparently. Our server was a noob, so he was being followed by a second server who was training him.  He seemed a little eager to please and probably came back a few too many times asking how things were going, but both dining partner and I were in sympathetic moods and remember all too clearly what it's like being the ""new person on the staff"", so we let it go. We were stoked to get a big, semi-circle booth - with just two people, you'd expect that to be saved for a larger party, but boy were we excited to be able to sit closer to each other.  You know, to talk.  Sheesh.  ;) Dining partner had the seven beer sampler, which had all but the seasonal brew in 5oz pours.  That's a lotta beer, folks, and we felt this to be more generous than other places, so bonus points to them.  I wanted to try the hard berry cider, so I got a 5oz pour of that plus a cream soda because finding places that make their own cream soda is impossible.  Plus they said that there was hints of butterscotch.  I dare you to turn THAT down. The beers weren't bad - the blonde was definitely awesome.  The cider was really good, nice and tart and refreshing.  (And surprisingly clear.)  The cream soda, though, won for both dining partner and I - holy crap that was some good cream soda.  No weird, artifical flavoring...just good, cool, crisp butterscotch flavored cream soda-ness.   Yum. Dining partner ordered the spinach and artichoke deep dish pizza (small), I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta.  The pizza looked good and dining partner seemed pleased - I would've sampled, but I haven't been able to eat much lately and I was faced with Mt. St. Pasta.  The scampi pasta was angel hair pasta with olive oil, garlic, tomatos, and parmesan cheese.  And surprisingly, a ton of shrimp scampis!  Usually you get, like, five shrimps but there was TONS! Pasta wasn't bad, though I'd like a little more salt, but I'm a salt fiend. Mine also came with two pieces of toasted garlic bread, which was SO good. We did not save room for dessert, but wound up splitting a small bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce on it, which was a good way to end the evening. We never felt rushed, we had a great view of the giant TVs in the bar (the better to watch sports on), and we left with leftovers and happy thoughts.  We WILL be returning to this place.  For more cream soda."
kimmie n.,"Renton, WA",0,1,,1.0,7/15/2010,"BJs was an okay restaurant before today.. The food did not excite me but the Pizookie is the only reason why i return.  My girlfriends and I decided to go here for a birthday dessert.   it wasn't too busy and we got seated right away.  So 15 minutes pass by.... no one comes by the table.. we see other tables being served but nobody on our side.  No other servers made eye contact.  No water. nothing.  SERIOUSLY?!  we looked around, waited another 5 minutes. NOPE, OVER.   as we were leaving the place, we happen to see a woman (possibly manager) and hostess standing up in the front.  we were letting them know that we've been waiting for at least 10 minutes and NOBODY made an effort to stop by.  the woman apoligized in a sarcastic voice and said she can fix that.  the hostess rolled her eyes.  we, nicely, said no thanks and left..  i dont care if you're having a bad day, leave it to yourself!  i hate this place now.. show some damn respect!"
Jennilee B.,"Seattle, WA",162,191,5,4.0,11/6/2010,"Their Pizooki is amazing! It's a cookie baked in a pizza pan and topped with ice cream. It's so good that it's really the only reason I don't mind eating at this franchise. Well, that I guess and their thin and crispy fries- which by the way comes to your table piping hot. They're happy hour isn't bad either- you might want to try going during the late evening- it gets pretty busy during the early evening after work rush. So, try the Pizooki, you're taste buds will be very happy you did!"
B B.,"Renton, WA",5,58,,3.0,6/17/2011,Had there bjz favorite deep dish pizza and it was ok.  Nothing special the crust was pretty crispy and garlicy good stuff the rest of the pizza kind of tasted like pizza hut deep pan no wow factor.  Good portion good service good timeing so i give this place a average 3 stars.
Pablo G.,"Seattle, WA",48,157,3,1.0,6/4/2011,"I usually avoid the food court at the mall... But after eating here I just might reconsider... Service was good, the place is good too, unfortunately the food was bad"
Sam L.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",678,482,1418,3.0,3/6/2013,"I was with a group of people. Our party had eleven people. The menu has extensive choices of beer, drinks and food. Our one server capably handled us and your separate tickets cheerfully. This is a rather large establishment in the Southcenter complex of stores and restaurants. Parking was difficult to find even though it's an enormously huge lot. or lots. Rows and rows of cars and bunches of cars jockeying for the few available spaces. Especially the ones that are somewhat close in, avoiding having to walk a mile or so to your destination. Back to the restaurant, as I said it's a large space filled with hard surfaces and lots of people. So it's loud. There's a generous mix of different types of people ranging from the very young to the very old and all those in between. The prices are moderate. The food is actually rather good. As I said previously the menu is extensive. It's difficult to have an extensive menu and do it all well. Kudos to them here. I'd go back but maybe at a slower time. I don't mind walking. It's not being able to find my car that I don't like. LOL."
Aram M.,"Seattle, WA",2,59,5,2.0,7/3/2011,"I don't think I will be going to this place ever again.  Service: 8/10 Food Quality: 8/10 Alcohol: 0/10 Guys, stick to their beer. If you order anything else, it may not have alcohol in it at all. They rip you off on cocktails badly. On couple of occasion ordered Long Island and got some sweet lemonade instead. My last time there I ordered Gin&Tonic and there was plenty of tonic and ice but not enough tanqueray."
Darian D.,"College Place, WA",89,83,,5.0,6/27/2013,"Seriously, this restaurant has a moderate rating of 3/5 on Yelp, I went here yesterday with my brother and two of our friends and we all loved it, the service was good and the food was delicious and it was more reasonably priced than what I've expected it to be, I really enjoyed coming here and think this restaurant deserves a much higher rating on Yelp, I only wish they could come to Eastern Washington State."
Richard C.,"Seattle, WA",0,19,19,5.0,10/28/2009,Excellent Italian Market Salad:-)) Great deep-pan pizza:-)) Sweet pizookee dessert:-)) Like that huge wall-size TV panel:-)) Friendly wait-service too :-))
John R.,"Seattle, WA",0,42,,2.0,10/19/2013,"Nice ambiance, lot's of TV's but it's cold in the lounge.  When it's cold outside, wouldn't last long in there.  Next door, Joey's Nice and Warm."
Robert Jr E.,"Signal Hill, CA",216,216,,5.0,1/4/2009,"In Seattle for Worlds ASA tournament and after a long day playing tournament, team decided to there for dinner. We had such a great time! Aside from the waiters being so attentive, the manager herself was at our disposal. Made sure we were taken care of... The food here is great, the drinks are great, more importantly the service and ambience made our experience enjoyable!"
nate j.,"Renton, WA",53,257,66,3.0,1/25/2009,"OK for first time experience but not stellar. Seated in what seemed to be a reasonable wait time (10-15 mins) on a Saturday night.    The place is nicely decorated and low lighting have a nice vibe going on.   The menu is big.  The server even described it as being as big as the bible.  It took a while to read through and decide what we wanted.  I think they offer a wide variety of foods from pizza, to pasta, salads, sandwiches, and loads of appetizers.  Think TGI Fridays, Red Robin, RAM Brewery, etc.  and that'd pretty much be what JB's is sort of like, but no sports memorabilia or other crap plastered to the walls and ceilings. The service was generally OK but the first round of mixed drinks came out staggered one at a time.  One of our party didn't get his drink as they were out of a key ingredient, but it wasn't until our first round was done that they came by to explain why the drink wasn't ready yet.  The beer was absolutely a fine representation of each of the different styles (I had the seven 5oz. sampler) none was too memorable, except the hefeweizen. Appetizers (potato skins and pot stickers) were good but they weren't like the best I'd ever had.  They weren't the worst either.  Like Randy Jackson says ""it's aaahh-iiight, dawg."" The diners at our table had a chicken parm, fish-n-chips, ribs, and a pizza.  I believe all were pleased with their choices and no complaints there. Parking is free and even on a busy Saturday, we were able to find a spot fairly easily.  Best advice is to avoid the urge to hunt for a spot up close and instead wind your way to the upper floors of the parking garage. Bottom line: we might be back, but with so many other new offerings around the new and improved Southcenter, we may be more inclined to keep trying other new places before we return here. As for price, I selected moderate.  Dinner for two, two drinks each, and appetizer plus tax and tip was over $70."
Otto R.,"Puyallup, WA",204,456,209,4.0,12/10/2008,"Its a above average mall chain style eatery. Our work took us down there for a buffet style meal, with pizzas, pasta, and salad. The deep dish pizzas were my favorite. Of the four pizza choices, my favorite was the BBQ chicken pizza.  The BBQ was tangy and sweet, that is how I like my BBQ. The Spinach and Artichoke pizza was also really good. The other pizza was kind of like a meat lovers, loaded with different types of meat.  it was nice. The pasta was kind of a basic spaghetti,  but the noodles were fairly good. A decent place at the mall for pizza and pasta.  Its better than olive garden heh."
Koko M.,"Seattle, WA",8,2,2,1.0,5/12/2011,"This was the worst dining expeirence ever! Two times in a row. You would think after the first time we would not of come back. But we thought maybe it was just the super young waitress who delayed our order. It took 20 minutes just to get two waters and a Sprite.  The second time we went was when the boss was in town. He took out the whole office. There was 12 of us. Again it took 20 minutes just to get water. And about 30 minutes for the bar drinks. After the first 45 minutes we were able to place our order. The food took so long to get out of the kitchen that the manager brought us unsolicited free appetizers. They were mediocre to say the least. Usually free food at a restaurant is awesome. Right? Not really at BJ's. It was more like damage control on the managers part. Nice try, but no cigar. So the CEO of our company takes us all out to dinner, and he is the one that the waiter can't seem to get the order right on. One of our party members had to personally walk up to one of the staff members and explain that the most important person at the table needs to be taken care of correctly. They still messed up his order. Threes times in total  to try and amend  it. So the icing on the cake is 6 out of the party of 11 got sick from the food. Possibley more, they just haven't spoken up yet. So in summary, the service sucks, the food doesn't taste good and it made us sick. don't go here unless you are going to get drunk at the bar and watch the 10 foot big screen TV. You won't even be able to tell the food poising from your hangover."
Sharon K.,"Dallas, TX",56,251,105,4.0,12/14/2008,"I went to BJ's for the first time on Friday with a big group of people.  I have to say that overall it was a great experience and the food was awesome! My friend called and set a reservation for 10 (they said they'll take reservations if there are 10 or more) for Friday evening.  The restaurant manager personally seated our group and was very friendly, telling some of the guys in the group about the different kinds of beer they had.  Our server(s) got our orders in a timely manner and checked on us regularly.   My side of the table got the buffalo chicken pizza along with the great white pizza.  I LOVED these pizzas!  They're deep dish and they're not stingy with the toppings.  I preferred the buffalo chicken b/c it had more flavor.  But of course, I topped it all off with Tabasco sauce haha  I tried a bite of my friend's jambalaya - perfect for people who love spicy food.   For dessert, we got the famous pizookie.  There were four different choices but I ate mostly the white chocolate macadamia and chocolate chunk.  The ice cream was very creamy and smooth.  YUM! The cost of the food was reasonable, considering the quality of food.   I left full and happy!"
Mikea R.,"Seattle, WA",71,18,,2.0,3/18/2011,I ordered buffalo wings for my appetizer and they were served cold. The waitress gladly took them back and brought me out a fresh new order which were hot and crispy. For my main course I ordered a hamburger. The burger was super bland and just not good. But my drink was awesome!!! The service was good but the food was crappy!!
