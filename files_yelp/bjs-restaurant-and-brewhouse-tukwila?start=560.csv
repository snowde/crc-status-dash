Maya D.,"Renton, WA",0,2,,2.0,11/11/2013,"I go to BJs very often, no matter what day of the week you go, weather its weekend or weekdays, empty or full still it takes sooooo long for the food to arrive, i hate the wait time, i wish they can provide much faster service :-("
Jennifer H.,"Seattle, WA",2,4,,5.0,8/27/2008,"With Bj's southcenter being the first one in washington, i didnt know what the heck the place was. But after trying their pizza, I'm in looooooooooooooooove.  Pizzas are delicious. Even all the other foods are BOMB DIGGITY. I've had many of my friends which are pizza haters become pizza lovers at Bj's. Their 6 inch deep dish pizza with the perfect crust beats any other pizza place. i PROMISE! Their pizookie is also very yummy. I'm not a big fan of desert. However, the pizookie is something I have to get. Enough about the food, its time to talk about the service. Although parking is a pain in the butt sometimes, this place has absoultely fantasticly uberiffic service. From the beginning to end, they are trained to be respectful, friendly, and very comforting (especialy the hosts!!!!) I hope everyone decides to go check this place out."
Melissa G.,"Renton, WA",17,31,3,5.0,1/20/2009,"I have got to say, Wow - I love this place.  BJs is the kind of place that has a relaxing but fun environment, delicious food, great beer, good happy hour, and polite-real-great servers. It really is the kind of place to go with friends or family, kick back some beers, and let the good times roll.  The music is usually playing some good tunes, this way its okay to talk a little loud with out the people next to you ease dropping in your conversation- like smaller places.  Some of my favorite dishes are the balsamic chicken (better then Moms home made chicken), the great white pizza (who would have thought Alfredo sauce on pizza would be so good), & any place with a great french dip sandwich is 5 stars in my book.  Most of the BJs beer is very good. I personally loved the Nutty Brewnette and I am not usually a dark beer kind of person. The pumpkin ale was also very yummy and the piranha pale ale.  The service was great as well. The staff seems to be genuine, real, fun, nice, and knowledgeable (of their place of work). Its always nice to go to a restaurant where the servers, hosts, and managers always remember you and are sure that you have enjoyed your self.  Wonderful place and I'll keep coming back."
Meghan M.,"Renton, WA",52,10,,5.0,6/15/2011,"I'm not amazed by burgers very often but their bacon cheeseburger was amazing!! Had the blonde brew, thought it was good too. My girlfriend had the red and really liked it. Have a HUGE menu and some great cocktails as well. Great place to go."
Kjell S.,"Renton, WA",19,86,50,3.0,11/30/2010,"Went here on Saturday, and I had to bump it down a star when I encountered a righteous comment from another reviewer. Please do NOT tell me this is deep dish pizza. Do I look stupid? I probably do. But don't assume I am. Although I might be. I think I'm dumb. Maybe just happy (Nirvana). It really isn't bad pizza, but it just had huge crust. And from what I've learned, deep dish is deep because of sauce. I read in another review that it is glorified pizza hut pizza. And that is spot on. But Pizza Hut pizza is good and so is this. But this is NOT CHICAGO STYLE. BJ's is a mediocre chain with some restaurants outperforming others, and also is a chain that has good pizza with big crust, pizza that shouldn't be called deep dish. Also the toppings on the pizza I ordered were not what the menu read. That is simple stuff."
Yiling W.,"Seattle, WA",39,497,145,4.0,10/5/2008,"I think I've been back here every Friday for the last three weeks... The BJ's Porter is delicious, mozzarella sticks are always good, and the pasta dishes (especially the one with pine nuts) are pretty good too. Some rave about the pizookie (giant pizza cookie with ice cream on top), though I'm not a cookie monster myself. Call ahead on a busy night to ensure prompter seating. The staff are friendly and generally pretty knowledgable about their wide beer selection. If faced with a choice of fries, the wedge-cut are far superior to the thinner ones. The bathrooms are clean, there's an outdoor area for summer nights, and also a separate entrance if you're there for takeout."
Dustin H.,"Lynnwood, WA",6,5,,5.0,2/26/2011,"This place has a GREAT selection of good food.  Reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory as far as the selection goes.  The wait staff is very knowledgeable and they brew their own beer.... since I don't drink alcohol, I indulge in their brewed cream soda and root-beer.  Definitely try this place.  Family friendly."
Michaela S.,"Olympia, WA",0,7,,1.0,6/23/2013,"We were very disappointed. My husbands burger tasted of old grease, my daughter's flatbread looked and tasted like something from the freezer and my salmon was a few thin pieces with totally overcook vegetables. Overpriced for this kind of poor quality. We will not be back."
Robert L.,"Renton, WA",14,102,3,4.0,1/8/2010,"like the cheesecake factory, it has a bible for a menu, and like the ram it brews it's own awesome beers.  i'm usually not the biggest fan of chain restaurants, but this place is noteworthy. the food is good and it's a casual environment to just kick back and pound some beers. what i LOVE about their encyclopedia sized menu (Volume J to be exact) is that they have beer pairings with their food, so if you're not the most knowledgeable of beers, they can break it down for you :)  my first adventure: my buddy and i split a pizza and wings, it was awesome, the pizzas are deep dish style, and they do it right! light and fluffy on the inside, cripsy on the outside, with minimal grease.  we went in october when their seasonal beer was a pumpkin ale (my fav), so essentially this particular dining experience was a perfect bromance date. adventure the second: a little over a year later the same dude and i go back, and again, we split a pizza (Mediterranean) and this time got nachos, and me being the piggy i am, ordered a bowl of chili too.  you don't even have to ask, of course i got their seasonal beer! Grand Cru (not nearly has mind blowing as pumpkin ale).  what separates this outing from the first is that everything we ordered tasted pretty bland, i mean, it was good, just not great. if i had a few more beers in my system it would have tasted great.  but skip the chili, it tasted as if it was from a can, wasn't even very hot either :( so this time around, it got a 3/5, and doing the proper math, this is how i summed up my overall 4/5 stars you see above (oh yea, i went to kollege)  overall: i will be going back in the future because i likes beer, and i like their ""gourmet"" bar food, i also wanna try some else there besides pizza"
Steve W.,"Seattle, WA",80,59,27,4.0,7/8/2011,"This place is SO good. I could NOT give 5 starts because my last visit was terrible and they did not offer a free drink or any kind of ""perk"" except ""we are sorry"".. However, 90% of the time AMAZING food, THE BEST drinks. Fix the service issue and a 5 star top pick for me this will become."
Barnali B.,"Kent, WA",3,3,,5.0,4/23/2013,"We are a big fan of BJ's since we moved here in 2008. However, our last visit was the  best of all. Well, in a way.  My food was very delayed and by the time mine arrived my family was done with their dinner ! The manager apologized several times and the reason for the delay was , they were out of nachos and were frying a fresh batch. When it arrived finally, it was super delicious. Fish Tacos, with side of warm nachos and delish sauces. And I was happiest when the check was on the table. I was not billed for my entree! That was sure a great gesture. Good ambiance, Great food, greater service (even if not fast enough) . What more could you ask from a restaurant?"
Denise D.,"Seattle, WA",0,93,,3.0,4/7/2013,"The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because we actually had a really decent waitress. Now let's start at the beginning: gone is the time/era where young people employed and in a working environment actually convey a greeting and manners. This was surely in effect with the hostess located behind the front counter (this is the person who greets people) and this was also in effect for the other hostess (this is the person who takes you to your table) who led us to our table. Hostess number 1, neither observed nor spoke to us being in the restaurant for at least 5 minutes. She was heavily engrossed in her computer system. A quick, hi there how are you and I'll be with you in a few moments would have been really nice. Yeah...that didn't happen. Hostess #2 had zero personality and conveyed this. She led us to the outer area, which was empty but which had a huge ladder in place; it wasn't the most welcome of atmospheres/environment and we didn't care for the area. Actually all of the restaurant was empty since it was open only for a little whilte. We did not like this area and asked if we could be moved inside. She did not care for this request and simply said ok and walked back inside. Wow, if it was just me and not my husband and myself, I would have walked all of the way out. We also observed another couple come in with the same young lady and while you tried to seat them in the same area, they weren't having it either and she was just as friendly with them. First impressions are huge and these 2 young ladies are doing a huge disservice to this restaurant with their personalities or lack of. Enter our waitress, very nice, very helpful. My husband ordered the asian wrap and the house made rootbeer. I ordered the turkey club and a side of avocado with iced tea. The drinks came promptly. The rootbeer was heavy with vanilla and that's a shame because it took away from the flavor of rootbeer. The time for us to receive our meals, considering the emptiness of the restaurant was about 15 to 20 minutes. After almost finishing, our waitress asked if we would like dessert. My husband ordered the beignet with ice cream and strawberries. Ok the wait for this 20 minutes plus. This is the 2nd time for us coming into this place. The first time was a long time ago, it wasn't so great but we thought we'd give it a try, to see if maybe it had improved.Well.....ok not much. Food is ok, nothing to say at a later date...hey remember that really good meal we had at BJ's? Nope not happening. The people working here....management, you have some work to do. I say this with some knowledge as both my husband and I are managers and we realize how important it is to have effective, good people working for you. We won't be back for awhile and I will remind my husband of why, in case we consider this place again."
Niki T.,"Port Angeles, WA",0,22,,3.0,4/5/2013,"They are just average. I've been here twice and they have a good menu with lots of selection, maybe too much on the menu. The drinks are good, the service is excellent, and maybe that is why I've gone back...because they always treat customers well. I can't say the service is fast, but I don't feel rushed here. Definitely come for happy hour and apps. It is a little pricey for what I usually pay."
Bruce C.,"Kent, WA",1,16,,2.0,2/4/2010,"Always nice service, but last night something must have gone wrong in the back of the house. We were given dirty dishes and silverware. A floater in my wife's beer, and then a hair found half way through eating the nachoes. Might have been the perfect storm of coincidental bad stuff, but I don't think we'll be going back."
Cindy S.,"Kirkland, WA",0,25,,1.0,1/6/2013,"Hey lost us.. For telling us they won't have the famous deep dish. However u can get it at most other BJ. We complained and got the run around so call a friend in LA, that's district manager, who suggested we need to demand to bring back deep dish to Seattle"
L W.,"Kent, WA",11,8,3,5.0,3/4/2013,"My fiance and I visited bj's on a busy Friday in Feb. I was having a pretty rotten day, and there was a small misunderstanding with my food. What should have been a very simple fix, felt like a very emotional issue for me that evening... I nearly had an anxiety attack right in the middle of the dining room... Lucky for me, the manager handled the situation beautifully . He was attentive and understanding and never once made me feel like my ""issue"" was too little for his attention. Essentially, even in a big busy chain restaurant I felt as though I was treated with individual care, respect, and compassion! After a little smoothing out of the kinks I was able to get some delicious food, and they even took the liberty of sending us a free pizookie. Next time I think I would like to visit Bj's when they are slightly less busy, but the service and management are great!"
Mike G.,"Kent, WA",1,24,20,2.0,7/3/2010,"We've been to BJ's twice. It's located on the south side of the Southcenter mall. I like the look of the place and the beer is good, but the food is just OK, which is a general consensus from the entire family. I order the pulled pork. Here is the description: ""BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: Slow-roasted pork tossed in our smoky BBQ ranch sauce made with BJ's Jeremiah Red® Ale and topped with crispy onion strings, all on a grilled bun. Served with our signature coleslaw."" I liked the addition of the crispy onion strings but wasn't impressed by the BBQ sauce. I only had two problems with the sandwich (aside from the BBQ sauce) 1. The pork was chopped (hunks of pork), not pulled (thin shreds of pork) 2. No mention of what appears to be thousand island sauce (AKA: special sauce), which I am in no way a fan of.  If you're going to include a major ingredient like sauce, mention it in the description. The wife the Mediterranean pizza, which again, was just OK. The kids had mini corn dogs and spaghetti with meat sauce. I guess the spaghetti was fine but the other daughter didn't really like the corn dogs. I tried them and I'd have to say that I've had better (since I tend to get the leftovers :-) ). The service was a little slow the first time we went, but that was when they first opened so we understood. The second time, we had fine service, although the waiter was a little soft spoken. I like their ""deck"". It has what I'd refer to as glass garage door which allows it to be rolled up on warm days but rolled down when the weather is a little chilly. This gives you the opportunity to have that outside experience w/o the worries of the fickle Washington weather. As for the beer, the wife had a Harvest Hefeweizen and had the P.P Porter (Guinness like) . The porter was fine but after I tasted it I remembered I liked their stout better. The wife also remembered she liked the their pale ale better. Oh well.  I don't think we'd go back for the food but I'd be up for a beer on the deck."
Aaron E.,"Seattle, WA",334,473,6,5.0,5/18/2009,"Hehehehe.  Yes, the name is funny =) Yeah, so BJ's is still awesome!  That pillowy, cheesy, goodness!  Ooooohhhh!!!!  Toppings are still generous, they still go light on the sauce and they still make my favorite pizza!  Thick, golden brown crust that melts in your mouth... check! Amazing combinations of fresh veggies and hearty meat?  Check!  Delicious cocktails?  Check.  Just as good as I remember!  Over the weekend when we came in we did have the worst service in the history of.... well, the history of the world.  It got to the point where it was comical how bad it all was.  What to do about the terrible experience? Let the manager know, who greatly apologized and made sure we left happy (and we certainly did).  Really, it's okay to complain here if you're not happy.  The fact that the manager and host were so accomodating about our bad service (and the fact that the pizza was amazing) made me one happy customer!  Will I let that one bad experience stop me from coming back?  Absolutely not.    Rumor has it they might open a location a little bit closer to Seattle.... and I will be their first customer."
Lacey S.,"Hayward, CA",1,21,,5.0,9/26/2012,We were there Monday night when the Seahawks beat the packers and had a GREAT waiter!! Were seated right away....the waitress filled our drinks without us asking...gave us the 2 for 20 and movie tickets for 15 more dollars! It was a great deal! Pizza was great and the Chicken tortilla soup was the best my husband has ever had....Would definately go back!!
Mitchell D.,"Cibolo, TX",12,5,1,3.0,11/18/2012,"First time at BJ's.  It has a large menu, but nothing seemed to pop out at me, including a variety of pizza's that I wasn't in the mood for.  I had a late lunch so I wasn't too hungry anyway.  I ended with the slider's (appetizer menu) and shoestring fries, both were good, especially the fries.  The menu includes a large section of nutrition information.  I also ordered the (multi-colored) chips and salsa, which I thought were good with a large plate full of them.  The salsa was different with a little smokey taste, but good nonetheless that I kept coming back to them.  I tried a new seasonal beer on the menu, though I can't remember it's name, and it was okay.  Re-reading the beer menu now I would have definitely chosen BJ's Nit Wit, which is more of what I was looking for in the first place.  Service was attentive but not distracting.  Overall, a good choice with the games on in the background.  I'll go back sometime when I'm hungrier and to try their large beer selection for sure."
