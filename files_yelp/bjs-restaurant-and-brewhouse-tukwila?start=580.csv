Tay H.,"Bellevue, WA",336,459,8,4.0,6/18/2011,"pretty nice and clean. food wasn't extraordinary but it came out relatively fast for a restaurant of this size. service was also pretty friendly and checked up on us every ten minutes or so. the pulled pork sandwich was really good. perfect size, lots of meat, not too much sauce."
Judith B.,"Bonney Lake, WA",15,1,,1.0,10/23/2009,"Recommended by a co-worker we went with relativly high expectations and were spectacularly Underwhelmed. The service was terrible, our waitress practically accused us of lieing - whatever happened to the customer is always right?!? Our order was wrong three times and the pacing of the service was terrible - we won't go back..."
Tina G.,"Seattle, WA",0,31,,5.0,7/7/2010,Love their happy hour. Probably the only time it is most appreciated. Besides that it is just another place to go. Their wings and puffy pizzas are great.
T J.,"Kent, WA",3,48,16,4.0,3/11/2012,"Love their beer. Always good food. I had the chopped salad & was very pleased, but I most often get the mediterranean pizza because it's delicious! The pizookies are delicious too. Good atmosphere & good service."
Kalvin H.,"Kent, WA",0,23,,3.0,2/2/2012,"Very good appetizers but de unless you're coming here for its sports bar aspect, you're better off looking elsewhere."
ali y.,"Renton, WA",1,87,22,1.0,3/22/2012,Well we were there for 2.5 hours. Food was great. Service was AWEFULL. The menu was awesome prices were great. But honestly if I have to ask the manager to get a refill on the water after it was sitting there empty for a half an hour not worth going to again. 2.5 hours for a meal with appetizers?!?
Ria D.,"Seattle, WA",24,13,,4.0,8/19/2008,Me & my friend were at the mall and we got hungry...so we started looking for places to eat. I haven't been to BJ's since I moved from california. So we both decided to eat there.  We were seated immediately. No wait time...YAY!! The waitress that we got was really nice. She provided us with excellent customer service. The food itself was really good. We ordered from the lunch menu. I got the california chicken sandwich with a side of fries and salad. I will tell you it was yummy :) We also bought some drinks. Yes drinks  :) That was really good too. I forgot what it was called...strawberry something :) I plan to go back there again soon :)
Tara B.,"Seattle, WA",0,12,,2.0,2/17/2013,"I've been to this location about 7 times in the last 3 years and I can say after my experience yesterday I will not be going back.  First off, our waiter was disheveled,  and was sweating profusely - gross considering you're serving my food.  We ordered food and it took nearly 35 minutes until we got it at our table - cold! The plates that were provided for the pizza were also dirty and had old food all over them.  I asked for a clean plate and my friend watched the waiter go find a towel and wipe my plate and proceed to hand it back to us - EW! Back to the food...my husband and I ordered a pizza (which we've ordered in the past and loved!) and it showed up, cold, on a white plate (usually was in the fun deep dish pan) and had barely any toppings like we used to get in the past.  I'm not sure if this was a ""Saturday Rush"" situation but regardless, cold food, dirty plates, blah pizza, and a sweaty waiter makes me never want to come back. And to top it all off, I visited the restroom and it had no toilet paper in any stall and no soap...can't wait for the waiters to serve my food! Not!"
mike d.,"Spanaway, WA",0,8,1,4.0,4/25/2010,"tacoma mall location, stopped by around 5pm on a wednesday. Got right in and got an order of hot wings, they were great ,hot and crispy. We also got the beer sampler, 7-5oz glasses of different types,very tasty. I got the chicken on french roll with skinney fries & a salad. Nice portions, fresh and hot. The service was great that day, spent $50.00 for two lunches, beer & wings."
Just Y.,"Edmonds, WA",59,523,173,3.0,11/14/2010,"(2.5 stars) Summarized: Generic mall brewery where the average intake on a single dish is around 1000 calories.  Attractive interior, bordering a little too much on the dark wood cave, but otherwise pleasant and warm to sit it; the addition of a zillion TVs helps a lot.  We were surprised that the average age of the 1/3 full dining floor was close to 45, but that might explain why the piped in music was all from 1984.   Their brews were OK: not the best the Pacific Northwest has to offer, but not as wretched as some smaller establishments using ""we-brew"" as a gimmick.   I was somewhat disappointed that there was no brew information posted on their completely laminated menu (at least nutritional information was), which further pushed this place for me into the gimmick column.  I was also surprised that the primary focus of the textbook friendly server was to push food - like deep fried cheese - instead of beer or unique menu items.  If you're into Server Clue-Ins, we could over hear a few different server conversations on many tables, and all of them seemed to have revolving favorite dishes that coincidentally reflected whatever each table ordered.  The food though, meh.  This place would be out of business if the deep fryer ever died, as they make use of it on seemingly everything, including salads."
Annie B.,"Kent, WA",47,192,1,2.0,5/9/2011,"Been here a few times and service is a hit/miss. Went the other night on Cinco de Mayo and they werent packed at all. Service was a miss this night. Between my friend and I, we tried to order three different types of drinks and they were out of one (or more) ingredients of each of those so we both had to end of ordering something else which is just a nuisance. And, the server didnt bother or even offer to comp one drink or anything which I would think would be decent customer service. Our server only came back to ask us if we wanted anything else two times over a 3-hour period then dropped us off the bill. I had wanted to order food but since our server didnt come back, that wasnt an option. I left no tip."
Foodie M.,"Seattle, WA",6,28,,3.0,5/27/2009,"On 5/20 a small group of us went to watch the NBA playoffs at BJs.  The bar is typically packed, but it was unusually dead that afternoon - most likely due to the holiday weekend.  We ordered several different appetizers and thought that the food would arrive quickly, especially because there were more employees than customers in the restaurant.  Unfortunately we received our food over thirty minutes after we first placed our order with the waitress.  Although the wait time was a little disappointing, the food was excellent!  The fresh basil with italian flatbread pizza is one of my favorite dishes.  The crust is light and flakey and topped with a great combination of three different cheeses, sausage, tomatoes and fresh basil.  The potato skins were well baked with the perfect amount of cheese and bacon.  The buffalo wings were nice and crispy and also came with an extra side of hot sauce and ranch dressing.  The spinach and artichoke dip was deliciously cheesy, however, it would have been better if they served it with pita bread instead of tortilla chips. I've been to BJ's multiple times and the food is consistently delicous! The service wasn't the best this time around, but I will definitely be back."
Angela G.,"Kent, WA",8,16,,1.0,7/26/2011,"WORST SERVICE EVER.... First WE had to Seat ourselves, then when we finally got MENU'S, we were so hungry we ordered our drinks my friends Pepsi, came back FLAT, tasting HORRIBLE, by the time we got our drinks we just wanted food, when we finally got our food AFTER 30 min. I only got HALF my food WITH OUT everything I ordered... and I DIDN'T order something complex... SUPER simple, AND we could NEVER get our waitress attention, she would ask a one answer question but wouldn't stay long enough for us to ask for my water, or another drink, or more soda.... We finally got a very nice waitress who when we said we are JUST starving, and want our food. She went to try and figure out WHY are food was not out to us. AND they had MAYBE three tables with 2-3 people at them.. So it wasn't that BUSY. I do have to say, when the manager came over and we explained, what had happened she was speechless, she seemed VERY nice, and did everything she could do, and the waitress that was helpful did stop by on her way out and said to ask for her if we did come back and she would make sure to take care of us!!! That was the ONLY light of hope for our trip to visit this restaurant."
Doug A.,"Auburn, WA",2,12,,4.0,6/2/2009,"I've eaten and drank here numerous times and they have an awesome beer selection, decent happy hour, and good food.  I definately prefer the setting here to Joey's next door, its got a nice layout, cool bar, and doesnt try to hard to be special.  If we are in the mall and want to eat or drink we will still choose BJ's typically as well as Dukes, Bahama Breeze, Newport Bay, or Cheescake Factory sometimes."
Bettina B.,"Auburn, WA",11,178,2,4.0,3/15/2011,"I've been to BJ's plenty of times!! I've had lots of different things on the menu but I do really enjoy the Avocado eggrolls!! Im pretty sure I've gotten them every time I've been here!! Of course a great selection of beers..and you can pretty much never go wrong with a HUGE beer selection. I really do love the variety of food they have on the menu, and everything I've tried has always been really good. The desserts...mmmm good stuff!! I had the brownie whatever its called...and mmm if you havent tried ot please do so the next time you come here!! I also tried the Black Cherry Soda...man thats very tasty!! I loved it!! This place does get busy...but for obvious reasons...and FYI NO my car was not broken into by some random gang thing!! ha ha ha h aha!! The staff here are very friendly...I've never had a problems at all. I look forward to my next visit to BJ's...a day when Im not hanging over obviously!! ;)"
Randy R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,66,,2.0,5/22/2011,"went on sunday night.too cold inside and too noisy.not too busy,but wait time was long.ordered dinner-the mashed potates came cold,very fancy looking.apparently not the quantity or quality of the food -it's the looks of the plate.small portion for high price.good ambiance though. main draw is open late and the bar."
joe t.,"Seattle, WA",1,42,,2.0,1/17/2011,"This place has gone downhill. Their beer sux and is served warm apparently. The food is so obviously frantically thrown together with ZERO care for how it tastes. How can a deep dish pizza only take 10 minutes to get to your table?? Anywhere else a deep dish takes 20 to 30 minutes. My nieces chikn strip lunch came out with scalding hot chicken and ice cap cold french fries....Hmmmm...wonder why? Come on now BJs, when you actually try you put out some very good food, today you def get a D- for effort."
Uyen H.,"Renton, WA",20,31,111,1.0,12/11/2010,"my boyfriend and i went here recently and we order clam chowder and it came out cold, we also order some pasta and it came out cold and dry, so disappointed."
Justina S.,"Seattle, WA",43,146,8,2.0,7/28/2010,"sorry, but i am not a fan of this bj's ... the only bj that i am fan of is ............... ben & jerrys icecream! lol get your mind out of the gutter!! the only thing is there beers! yummy .. also the waiters are rude."
B B.,"Seattle, WA",1,78,,2.0,1/6/2010,"Well, it just started out so badly. My friend and I asked a waitress about happy hour, which she said was still going on, and we then sat in the bar waiting for the happiest hour of th eday. The bar waitress arrived and we asked about the HH specials to which she informed us that HH did not exist on Saturdays. ""Oh, OK, that's fine. We were told it did..."" we said nonchalantly. She immediately left to get the manager-we weren't even upset, but the next thing made us so. The manager comes out and speaks to us in a very condescending tone, ""Um, so, yeeeaah, there's no HH on Saturdays."" Giving us the old stink eye. IT was like they expected us to freak out and treated us like we had. WE humbly ate there, food was good but the experience of the high-strung waitress and rude manager ruined it."
