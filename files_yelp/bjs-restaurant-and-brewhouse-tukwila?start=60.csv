Conner A.,"Irvine, CA",79,8,2,4.0,10/31/2017,I came in hesitant but this location is actually pretty good. I only give it 4 stars because it seems understaffed. Feel bad for the bartenders.
Terry S.,"Londonderry, NH",0,11,3,1.0,12/8/2016,"I sat at the bar on a Thursday evening it was totally dead.  It took 40 minutes to get a cold pizza.  I nicely informed the bar tender that it was cold she said they would make a new pizza.  15 minutes later she brought out the old pizza burned.  I told her no thank you and cashed out. I will never go back.  Horrible service, horrible experience.   By the way, Yelp requires at least one star to post a comment.  This really should be a negative 2 stars.  Don't waste your time or money."
Christopher P.,"Bothell, WA",21,29,,2.0,2/19/2017,"2 stars simply because the Management in this location has not a good handle on seating their guests and the hostess is not accommodating at all, would say borderline rude. In addition when asking after 40 minutes what happened (we were told 20min waiting) you get the answer that people making phone calls and come in.... Not sure what system BJ is using but it needs a serious review as we were not the only ones complaining about seating. Another couple with a baby was seated at a high table without baby chair possibility.... you get to wonder Once the seating debacle was over the service was good and the food what you come to expect hence why I rated this experience 2 stars."
Noralia S.,"Yakima, WA",0,4,2,1.0,8/23/2017,The worst service Ever!!! I have lipstick on my glass of wine. But who cares not the bartender that could only take my order and my money.  They really need to hire people with some kind of people skills.  No hello no how was your food or can I get you anything else.  The worst. Thanks for a crapy experience .
Courtney Y.,"Seattle, WA",30,23,18,1.0,10/27/2016,"Not even worth a star because before even going in I was met with terrible management. Yelling and quite honestly speaking in a degrading manner, rather than being a positive, customer first manager. I was so in absolute shock that I couldn't respond quickly, not that it mattered-he wouldn't stop raising his voice/talking, so I wouldn't have been able to say a word in edgewise-wise. I used to frequent this establishment with friends but now I doubt I will even want to enter through the mall entrance near it. Lost myself and the group I was with, along with my many friends that ALSO frequented this restaurant. Disgusting, absolutely disgusting management. This is my worst review to date."
Thao N.,"Seattle, WA",1683,441,245,4.0,4/12/2016,"BJ's is easy to meet up when a dinner is ought be be planned with friends because the mall that it's located in the centrally located between where all my south end friends live. It's also a safe choice because they have a huge selection on the menu. Happy hour used to be awesome here, but it has recently changed and the things I used to order on the menu isn't there anymore so I just order menu dishes and split it since everything is huge portion.  The Pazooki is to die for at the end of my meal no matter how full I am because I can't seem to find it anywhere else. It's a hot soft cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top and there's a variety of cookies that you can choose from. Also, take advantage if you come on your birthday because you get a free mini Pazooki with a candle lite up. Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Christian F.,"Sequim, WA",13,6,2,4.0,9/23/2016,"Nice atmosphere. I'm sitting here waiting for my food, drinking a beer and man I wish I had ordered the spaghetti. The guy next to me ordered it and it smells freaking amazing!  The menu has an overwhelming amount of options. Prices seem average. Service is good. The beer list is quite large as well."
Denise A.,"Shelton, WA",0,3,4,2.0,12/17/2017,"My friend had taken me here last night for the first time and I was very excited. But for some reason , some of the staff weren't so great. There was someone  cleaning the revolving door at the entrance so it took us a minute to figure out  if the place was still open or not since there were not many people inside .  It was about 10pm when we got there so we thought "" hm weird , thought they opened till midnight "". But my friend all of the sudden saw customers inside still eating , so he figured  they were still open. We were in the middle of still deciding wether to come in or not when the staff who was cleaning the door  glared at us then gave us the "" shrug"" almost like she was upset. It was so weird . Then I saw her say something to the hostess then they both glared at us . My friend and I were so confused because at this point it was just really awkward . So when we finally went through the revolving door  and were inside the restaurant , we kindly tried to explain to her why we were looking inside from the outside because we thought they were closed. But she went on and gave us an attitude saying "" YEAH WE ARE STILL OPEN"" not even making eye contact as she proceeded to clean the door Again.  So we kinda just smiled and walked up to hostess feeling even more weird . When we got up to the hostess , it was just a very weird vibe. You know when you're in a place and people treat you crappy and make you feel u wanted  ? Yes, it felt like that . My friend and I were so confused at this point because we couldn't figure out what we did wrong for them to treat us this way right on the spot. We didn't get a "" welcome or a Hi Hello there"". But at this point we didn't really care anymore because our expectations were already low. So my friend  told her table for two please . Then She told us "" if you're over 21(which we are) , u guys can sit at the bar. Go straight and it'll be on ur left hand side "" in the most unwelcoming approach ever  . So we just didn't say anything and followed what she told us to do. When we finally sat down , my friend and I finally discussed about the whole situation. We were still very confused, there was no need for those unwelcoming Rude vibes we got  when we walked in. But thankfully our server was sooo KINDD. She was very very pleasant , gosh I wish I remembered her name. She made up for all those BS. So I thank her very much! So for all the people planning on going here after 10pm, goooodddd luck lol"
Christopher C.,"Seattle, WA",9,1,,1.0,4/27/2017,"Got seated right away, but then waited 20 minutes with no sight of a server. Ended up just leaving. We told two of the hostesses, but they really didn't seem to care."
Jessica C.,"Seattle, WA",100,171,123,3.0,6/17/2016,"I feel pretty ambivalent about BJ's. I feel like every time I come in, they manage to screw something up lol. But I like the variety of food that is on the menu, perfect for an indecisive individual, like myself... which is probably why I haven't ditched.  BBQ wings, avocado rolls and calamari are a must for appetizers. I love that the wings pack a crunch to them and the bbq sauce was sweet. I'm a little butthurt that they took the side/appetizer mac and cheese off the menu =( I've tried their salmon dishes before which I liked. I also enjoy their clam chowder. Ahi tuna salad was a bit salty and overwhelming.  Last night I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese which came with a side of fries. The sandwich was kinda salty due to the buffalo sauce on the chicken and my fries came out like 20 minutes after my sandwich did -___-  Now that I think about it, I think I might enjoy their appetizers much more than their entrees."
Vicky M.,"Portland, OR",1124,177,168,4.0,6/24/2015,"I don't know why this place has such a low rating, I love this place! It's a great place to come and catch a game and eat some good food.  I also secretly love coming here for the pizookies ;) Their pizzas are good too!! Salads, wings and spinach artichoke dips are good, Overall I like this place, never really had a problem with it.  And I'll keep coming here for my pizookies!"
Evan S.,"West Seattle, Seattle, WA",27,2,,1.0,8/2/2017,"Our service on Monday night was horrible. Our waiter had a poor personality, seemed like he could careless. He first told us he was ready for our order and to just keep talking while he put it into his device, but then kept asking us to repeat our orders because he couldn't keep up.  We had to ask for drinks several times, a couple times had to ask a different waiter to refill our drinks. He forgot to bring an appetizer until we reminded him at the very end of the meal.  He never checked in on us to make sure everything was fine. There were only three in our party and it wasn't even busy. And there were more than plenty of waitstaff.  It's a shame that because of him I don't plan on going back for a long time. The menu is really good and there's even a cute guy that works there and was friendly and helpful. But the service we got makes me not want to return."
Caitlyn C.,"Kent, WA",75,15,,3.0,10/12/2017,well for starters we were quoted 20-25 minutes and there was one other couple in front of us. we watched a ton of people leave but we waited patiently. we were greeted within 5 minutes and ordered appetizers. they didn't come out for 15-20 minutes and they were cold like they sat in the window for ever. also i told him i wanted my salad with my meal and it came out even before our app. how annoying. the wings i had were good. we also had a pazookie which was delicious as well.
Matthew H.,"Seattle, WA",160,6,4,2.0,10/1/2016,"I went to the Tukwila location to celebrate my 32nd birthday with friends and the service was poor, the waiter for the table didn't check in with us to ask us how we were doing, didn't offer to refill the drinks, didn't let us know when the food was going to be out. not very friendly. When he came to grab the checks he just snatched them up didn't ask if I wanted to change or anything. Didn't say thank you.  I spoke to a manager. I didn't even see a name tag. I explained everything to the manager what happened and he basically stood there, listened and apologized. He didn't off to do anything to help for the inconvenience. Total was like 10 people on separate checks.  The table number if it helps was number 711. Oh, and the waiter didn't give everyone a copy of their receipt unless they paid by card and they didn't even ask if I was a rewards member.  After today I don't think I will be going back to that location. I would like some type of follow up from upper management to regard this. I don't want it to go to an endless black hole and not hear anything back."
Molly L.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,90,17,1.0,5/4/2017,"I ordered to go at 5pm. It's 5:37pm now and I am still waiting. I finally got my food, went back to work to eat it and the ""special sauce"" or whatever that was supposed to be on the burger is missing and it looks a mess. So I'll be rush eating a dry burger before I have to run back out to the sales floor. I feel like I wasted my time. Although- the guys working in the to go area are very nice. Also, I couldn't eat much of my burger, there was a bitter, burned taste :("
Tara B.,"Bellingham, WA",123,63,81,5.0,8/29/2016,"I loved this place, the only brief hiccup was while we were waiting to be seated. There were four or five staff members standing with their back to us chatting while we were waiting for a table. When we got to our table everything was smooth sailing. We were with two people who had dined here before so they were able to recommend some awesome dishes. We ordered two flights of beer, two specialty drinks, and two deep dish pizzas to share. This place is very family friendly, we have a 7 month old, and it was nice to feel like she wasn't a burden, There was even conversation surrounding her. I cannot stress enough how wonderful it is to have your child recognized and welcomed in a restaurant, kudos to our server who made us feel like we could dine there.  My flight included a beer they no longer had and another server asked me what I would like instead (after bringing the other five I ordered) I thought this was awesome,they took the responsibility upon them to make sure I had what I needed. I also got to try a beer i never would have ordered otherwise. We had so much fun dining here. I would go back in a heartbeat."
Joaquin D.,"Federal Way, WA",4,14,9,1.0,7/4/2016,"First timer in BJ's and I'm not too happy with their first impression. It must be the soccer game going on because the service was horrible.  I've waited in a restaurant before but this is by far the worst. I could've shopped in the mall and came back and still wouldn't have my food.  And when I got the food, I wasn't impressed. The deep dish ravioli wasn't pleasant. The cheese in the ravioli was so dry I finished my water with 4 bites of the ravioli. Which I should've conserved. Because my waiter never stopped by the table to check on my group for drinks or questions. So basically the whole group was sharing water at this point.  To top off the meal. We got our checks and we paid it in three ways because we were a party of 6 that were paired up. Anyways, he repeated the meals to us so he could split it. But when we got the checks it was all sorts of messed up besides one check. We then let the waiter know, and he ""fixed"" it. Or we thought. He still billed me for my friends dessert. I didn't want anymore problems so I just paid his dessert.  Thought it was the end, but it wasn't. The one couple that has the correct receipt paid theirs. And found out they paid $40 less than they were supposed to. They thought they were blessed, until the other couple paid theirs, and found out that they paid the first couple's bill.  Basically, horrible service with alright ravioli."
Conni M.,"Seattle, WA",4,86,5,4.0,5/4/2017,"The bar was full but we were told we could have Happy Hour in the restaurant. The server said we could read the board in the bar for HH offerings. Uh, ok. She then asked if she could get me some iced tea or a soda. She certainly read me wrong as I ordered a Sapphire Martini, straight up. We were rescued when the people we were meeting found us and had a different table with a different server. They had already ordered appetizers - chips and (great) salsa and amazing Siracha Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts were halved and braised and crispy with a Balsamic reduction. Delicious! I had the boneless chicken with the root beer glaze and loved them. Also one of the best beet salads ever, although it was a bit overdressed. Someone ordered a full rack of ribs that came with cheesy potatoes and they said they were juicy and falling off the bone good. Another got a Mediterranean deep dish pizza and thought it was really good. Someone else ordered a steak and it was cooked perfectly. And, finally, someone ordered the sliders with fries, which were disappointing and not very good. If you usually request tartar sauce with your fries you might want to skip it here. Theirs is like a thick Thousand Island dressing. We will be back because of the beer selection... and the great berry cider. But maybe we'll try BJ's in Redmond instead."
Michelle M.,"Olympia, WA",32,22,,1.0,6/18/2017,"Third strike, you're out BJs!  Terrible, slow, or just non existent service the last three visits. My husband and I stopped in today and stood there for a few minutes while at least 3 employees milled about. We decided to go ahead and seat ourselves in the bar.  Again, no acknowledgment! That's okay though, we walked next door to your neighbor, Moctezuma's and was not only greeted immediately and seated, we were served some delicious food in a very timely manner. And hey, guess what? They looked just as busy as your restaurant, so no excuse there! Looks like Moctezuma will be our first choice when in the area from now on!"
Bryan B.,"Seattle, WA",78,322,779,3.0,8/17/2015,"BJ's is an above average chain joint. Love that they brew their own beer and have a decent selection.  I had a burger topped with brisket and bacon and it was killer. Just needed some BBQ sauce on top, which I got from the server. It definitely completed the burger.  Calamari for an appetizer was solid and the wedge fries were also pretty good. Didn't have the pizza this time, but you can never go wrong with their deep dish."
