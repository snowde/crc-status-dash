Travis D.,"Maple Valley, WA",1,40,,2.0,11/29/2010,"I have been to this BJ's about 4 times, the food is just OK, service is usually pretty bad. Went last night and service was the best I've experienced there. That bumbed my review up to 2 stars. It is never my choice to go there unless some other people are going and I just go along. There are plenty of other better options in the area (Cheesecake Factory, Claim Jumpers, Olive Garden) that I would rather go to."
Tara C.,"Seattle, WA",2,15,,1.0,9/8/2009,"The first time I went to BJs was when it first opened. The food was decent  enough (the menu is giant, so if you are going with a large group of people, everyone is bound to find something they would eat) but the service was terrible. I figured that I should give them a break since the restaurant had just opened. Almost a year later, I thought they would have things figured out so I decided to try it again--total mistake. We were seated in a booth by the window, and then completely forgotten. There were only 4 or 5 other tables seated in the restaurant, and a seemingly full wait staff... but no one noticed that we were sitting there. No water or drink offerings, no silverware, and we only had menus because the hostess brought them when she sat us. After waiting for 30+ minutes and several failed attempts to get the attention of the wait staff, we left. We let the hostess know on the way out that we were leaving because the service was lacking, and all she did was shrug her shoulders."
Christine B.,"Eatonville, WA",1,20,,2.0,5/20/2013,"The decor is nice, but the restaurant overall is very, very, loud. I was with a party of 8 and none of us were thrilled with our food. I ordered the Garden Medley Salad without feta, which was described on the menu as ""Crisp romaine lettuce, artichoke hearts, fire-roasted red peppers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and our balsamic vinaigrette dressing."" It was a pile of not-crisp romaine, with the rest of the vegetables  chopped beyond recognition and spread around the edge of the plate as an afterthought. The dressing was not good- it tasted like low end bottled vinaigrette. It was not a $10 entree salad by any stretch.  My BF ordered steamed vegetables, which came slathered in butter. When he asked for them to be made without butter, he was told there was no butter on them. When I explained he just wanted them steamed- no butter, or olive oil, or whatever it was, they denied there being any added oils, though it was obvious that there was grease on the plate. On a positive note- my cocktails were good. If I was to ever go back there, it would be for the bar, not the food."
Chris C.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,2.0,6/27/2011,It's a nice environment. The beers are good. I would have to say I can make a better steak with my eye's closed! It was very bland. Can't think of anything more to say.
Ann D.,"Maple Valley, WA",1,10,,4.0,4/22/2011,Headed there with my 2 teenagers.  There was something on the menu that appealed to all our tastes.  Waitperson was very friendly but the food took a long time to make despite it was on a Monday and the place was not very busy.
sean d.,"Seattle, WA",3,13,,1.0,9/29/2012,"Horrible,horrible,horrible!! My fiancee and I went down to have a couple of drinks and grab a pizza just to end off the night. Well it went down hill as soon as we got into the place. Both of us were seated up by the bar at a table and waited for service for about 15 minutes. Finally got service and it took another 15 to get our drinks and mind you the bar was not packed at all. Took another 15 for our waitress to come back and take our order. We ordered two small salads and a sharable pizza. Twenty minutes later we received our salads and our pizza at the same time. Salads were ok but nothing special and then came the pizza. My fiancee grabbed a slice and I did too but with mine I received two giant strands of hair with it. Gross! After that I wasn't all that hungry and hadn't seen the waitress in a long time. Ten minutes later I got ahold of her and she took it away. The manager came over and said sorry and that was it. Twenty minutes later another pie came out but we just wanted to leave and go home. Took a while to get it boxed up and out of there."
Aaron L.,"Burien, WA",1,6,,4.0,3/11/2011,"BJ's is a great spot. They have a large menu with lots of different options so no matter what youre in the mood for you can find it there. Portions are good sized and service is always pretty good for a pretty busy place. I have had one bad appetizer (burnt potatoe skins) at thats the only food complaint I have. The only downside of this place is it's location. Southcenter is always crazy and parking is a nightmare. The location lends it to always being relatively busy but they do a pretty good job of getting people in and out quickly. Overall, it ranks pretty highly on my list of places to eat."
Ashley M.,"Tacoma, WA",0,3,,2.0,2/25/2013,"As much as I may love their food (when it's worth ordering), their quality of food changes every time I go there. Don't bother making special requests, they never make it properly the first time. The last time I was there for lunch I ordered one of their sandwiches. The one I most often order is supposed to be toasted, and when they brought it out the bread was disgustingly stale, sopping wet with dressing, and not toasted. They are close to where I work, and if it were not for convenience, I would never go there again. Also, I hate calling a restaurant that offers to go and curbside service who never answer their phones. Today when I called, it took calling four times and 20 minutes to get them to answer. When I explained to the hostess that I had been trying to call, she said she was sorry and was not paying attention. I'm done with their poor service and inconsistent food. Just plain unacceptable."
Kelsea E.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,12,,5.0,8/7/2008,"Recently dined there with my husband and young child.  Fantastic service, we were seated immediately by the very friendly hostess', our service was prompt and accomodating.   Choose, with fantastic results, the sante fe spring rolls as our appetizer (AWESOME CHOICE) the parmasean encrusted chicken breast and meatloaf for the entree's with, of course, PIZZOKIE!!!!! This restaurant won't disappoint you!!!!! Great service, great food, family friendly atmosphere, good prices for HUGE portions, what else could you ask for?! Oh whats that? The 110"" plasma screen behind the full bar (with their 7 brewed beers) and the multiple 50"" plasmas placed throughout the restaurant. This is definitely a bar that's good to hang with the guys, or bring your family around."
Tina K.,"Seattle, WA",14,30,18,1.0,1/14/2009,"Are you the chef with thin strands of long blonde hair?  Well buddy, I had a little taste of it in my slider!!!  We were very reasonable customers and didn't show hostility.  The manager on the other hand took that to her advantage and did not compensate us and MADE us pay for our beer.  I will never go back to BJ's, again not b/c of the hair, but for the mere fact that the manager did not go the extra mile to have us return for a better dining experience.  Go try the pumpkin ale, but make sure the foam on top is actually from the ale.  *Gagging*  ""Ok, let's go to Blue C Sushi!!!!"""
Hien L.,"Kent, WA",149,15,28,5.0,2/5/2009,very very nice restaurant at westfield southcenter mall. great food at a great prices.
Malea X.,"Seattle, WA",0,405,7,3.0,7/20/2009,"ok, i've been here a couple more times an they actually have servers now.  same ol' bj's fare - pretty darn good and not terribly pricey.  they have new lunch specials now for really good prices."
Gretchen B.,"Seattle, WA",26,143,,3.0,11/18/2008,"Now let me start by saying...this is a mall, chain, restaurant.  This isn't a fine dining four stars, but a mall four stars.  I spend lots of time at shopping malls and I have to say that of all the mall food.  BJ's is my favorite.  I have been here several times, even once or twice alone while I was working, and that alone (no pun intended) says alot.  The food here is very good.  I love their lunch special pizza and a salad.  This is deep dish pizza with crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside crust with a large topping assortment to choose from.  It is very filling and very very good.  I also like their pasta dishes, which unlike most chains are floating in grease and oil.  The shrimp scampi is quite good, angel hair pasta, light amount of sauce and lots of medium sized shrimp.  Now I am not saying you should get in your car and head down to Southcenter for your next meal, but if you find yourself hungry at the mall, this is a very good place to try."
Guy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",401,219,137,3.0,8/6/2008,"Being from california, I know what BJ's is and I am very familiar with their menu and such. Seeing as this was the first one to open in the state of washington, I wanted to take my friends out so that they could try it. The food was really great. I always get the Santa Fe salad. Its really good. It tasted just like it should. However since it was their first week being open, they were still working some kinks out. For example. one of my friends didn't get his food until all of us had almost finished. I am not one to complain but I thought that was a bit ridiculous. Then when we asked to talk to the manager, it took him quite some time to get over to us. He told us he apologizes and that the servers are just trying to take care of the bigger parties. Not a good excuse if you ask me. He ended up comping out meal which is what he should do. Hopefully their service will get better as time goes by."
Steve B.,"San Francisco, CA",5,95,2,5.0,7/3/2009,"So, this place isn't 5 star fancy, but for pub food this is as good as it gets.  I went in at about 3:30 in the afternoon, just in time for their happy hour.  All mini pizzas are half price.  I had a three topping pan pizza for like $4.75 - and it was great!  Mix that with a waiter who was constantly refilling my iced tea on this 90 degree day and I'm a happy camper.  I'll be returning for sure, braving the flying bullets in the Southcenter parking lot.  Oh well, good food is worth it!"
Chris W.,"Renton, WA",2,19,,5.0,5/26/2009,"I'm a homebrewer and have tried many of Seattle's finest, but have to say that some of BJ's brews are the best in the area.  The deep dish pizzas are incredible and I think BJ's has been able to produce a quality product despite being a chain.  I love the out of the way places, but this place keeps me coming back for the great food/beer.  I love sushi but thought it was funny that someone wrote a bad review and then talked about going to Sushi, lol.   Only in Seattle...."
Miko N.,"Renton, WA",58,11,,1.0,6/26/2009,"The food was nasty! We were a group of six, four adults, a 12 year old and 7 year old. They placed us in the ""family"" section next to a large table full of very loud kids. So, we let the girls play with their DS since we kept saying ""what did you say? I can't hear you."" I ordered the prime rib dip, my husband the BBQ beef sandwich, our family BBQ chicken pizza and chicken fried steak. The girls ordered Kraft mac and cheese and chicken tenders. Anything with BBQ sauce was gross. My husband described it as tasting like it had rubbing alcohol in it. Same sauce for the BBQ chicken pizza, so that was disgusting. My prime rib dip had no flavor and the au jus sauce tasted watered down. The chicken fried steak was not too bad, but didn't come with much sauce. Fries were alright; and kind of warm. Chicken tenders were ok and came with weird things that I believe were made out of potato. It was the form of a smiley face and were cold. The mac and cheese was gross. The one thing we did like was the service. We had a great waiter."
