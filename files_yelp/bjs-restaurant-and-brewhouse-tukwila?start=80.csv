Clara S.,"Seattle, WA",0,6,1,1.0,8/29/2016,"It takes A LOT for me to write a bad review, I usually opt to just not return to the restaurant. I've been to BJ's a good amount of times at different locations and a proud rewards customer. Six of us went for dinner at 7pm on a Monday and were seated at the outside dinning area. It was not very busy as a little less than half of the restaurant was filled. After taking our drink orders (5 drinks) the waitress came back in a few minutes to take our dinner orders. We ordered 6 entrees and 1 appetizer. When the waitress came back with our drinks we asked her if she could get someone to tell the constructions workers who decided to smoke in front of the restaurant to move. She looked at us and said ""oh."" And then she walked away with our orders. The construction guys never moved nor were they told to move by any staff member and they came back to smoke in the same area once more during our dinner. Our dinner came more than 60 minutes after we put in our order, including the appetizer! I think that defeats the point of an appetizer...I had a stuff mushroom as it was my friend that ordered it, it was lukewarm. The waitress came back to tell us twice our food was being ""plated/almost ready."" When our entrees FINALLY came out more than an hour later (this is not exaggerated, I started timing once it passed 40 or so minutes) my two friends who had fries, had cold fries. We were all too hungry to send it back. After our table decided to get pazookies hoping it wouldn't take as long...we were wrong...our pazookies took 30 minutes! We only ordered 3 of them.  I watched the other tables, there was a party of 7 and a party of 10 that all came after my table and they all had their food in what seemed like a timely manner. 4 other tables with a party of about 4 came, ate, and left all within the timeframe our table of 6 was still there...I honestly didn't get it.  I went to the front as we left to take a picture with my friends who I haven't seen in a long time and to also see if I could speak to someone about our experience this evening. There was no staff member to be found! We stood at the front for 10 minutes, looked around and gave up because honestly I got so tired of waiting. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. I will never come back to the Southcenter location."
Theresa B.,"Humble, TX",0,6,,4.0,6/21/2017,"I really enjoy visiting this restaurant and pub when visiting Auburn. The pizza is thin and crispy with delicious toppings,  love the Mac n cheese and ice cold beer. The service is great and they have a variety of sports on the TV.  We enjoyed appetisers of mozzarella cheese sticks with yummy marinaria and. The jalipeno poppers.  Yummy too!  Fun, relaxed atmosphere."
Alex S.,"Seattle, WA",2,71,1,2.0,11/27/2016,"This is a classic modern-brass-bar-style mall restaurant, similar to the many others on which corporate restaurant stereotypes are based. You'll find no surprises here, and for that reason I award one extra star. This restaurant will likely meet your expectations. It met mine. For example, when I ordered a burger they asked how I wanted it cooked, and I replied ""medium."" This is just a formality, they don't actually cook burgers to order, so I was not surprised when my burger came out far over cooked, fully dry well-done with no hint of pink. This sucks, but it should not surprise you, as it should be obvious that BJ's doesn't have real chefs custom-grilling food in the back.  If you like flashy decorations, $7 beers, and extremely over-sweetened margaritas, you'll love it here."
Jessica S.,"Kent, WA",0,4,,5.0,3/14/2017,I come here all the time and LOVE the service and the food is always great! Christian is the BEST server I've had there. He seriously made our visit there the best one so far! Can't wait to go back for more beer and fun!
Haley A.,"Maple Valley, WA",0,6,,1.0,6/20/2017,"Service from the kitchen was terrible.  We waited almost an hour to get our Pizza.  I think they forgot about it. A friend that was with us ordered dessert and they never brought it out. Overall super slow service and they weren't even paying attention to us. We asked where our food was twice and they didn't appear to do anything about it. The third time, they finally went back to the kitchen and checked on it.  A waiter and bartender whispered about it in hushed voices and then our food came out about 10 minutes later.  We never got an explanation or apology. Food tasted Ok, but we were super hungry by the time we got it."
Adam W.,"Kent, WA",0,8,,3.0,6/19/2017,"The food here is fairly good, but the South center location never feels clean. Today my table had dried food on it and the menus were sticky.  A used napkin was in the seat and the floor underneath really needed a mopping."
Keren E.,"Belltown, Seattle, WA",1,5,1,3.0,11/12/2016,"Tasty food and very nice servers but absolutely filthy and disgusting ladies room. You know what they say: if they let the customer see a disgusting restroom, imagine what they DON'T let you see! This is not a case where they just don't clean mid-day, this is just very poor cleaning in general. Dirty floor grout, cobwebs and dust bunnies between the restroom partitions, smeared God-knows-what on the partitions, etc. YUCK!!!!!!"
Rodney N.,"Kent, WA",132,20,1,2.0,3/5/2017,"This was my 3rd and final time to give this place a chance. Another failure. Long wait to get seated when there were hundreds of empty seats. Inattentive server. No pepper, catsup or butter for my eggs and pancakes. Requested the Mariners game be put on, was told it was happening but never did. Bison burger was delicious though."
Chris S.,"Bellevue, WA",104,36,26,1.0,1/22/2017,"I said I wouldn't write a review but seeing that a fellow Southcenter service industry worker gave his perspective, I'm compelled to chime in also, to confirm that some of the steps taken and not taken by their customer service team is unacceptable.  I'm a very understanding and forgiving person especially because I've been in the industry for 10 years. I know how things work and why some delays may happen at times and how to recover from them. I always give service workers the benefit of the doubt. The host team and manager at the host desk deserved none because even when their joke of a ""reservation system"" is so flawed, no one apologized for the inadequate way they handle reservations, acknowledged us for the loooong wait we endured just to get a table or even thanked us for being so patient. We had already been waiting so long that we decided to just commit to eating here rather than finding a new spot. For what it's worth, the host team was just a handful of (seemingly inexperienced) young girls doing what they're told to do (I've been there) but they turned to a clueless manager who still was unable to address any of our concerns appropriately or effectively for help. The only redeeming quality was our server Desmond who was very attentive and genuine. He did everything right as his role as our server. EVERYONE ELSE from the host team to management to the expo and the kitchen staff failed us. I understand some things the server has no control over so we took care of him because he apologized profusely, and took steps in trying his best to correct the situation. He let us know a manager would come by to touch base with us and that never happened. I would have loved to have spoken to a manager. I hate writing bad reviews but today was such a bad experience that really did not have to be so."
Amanda N.,"Seattle, WA",66,409,32,3.0,11/24/2015,"The wait list to get a table was long when I entered, so we headed to the bar section and got a table right away. Why wait when you can get seated right away. You can still order everything off the menu in the bar. Food was a typical american bar food I thought, nothing special. Waited a bit for the food to come out so it explains why my food wasn't hot. Drinks were good. There's a to go area for pick up if you don't want to dine in. Parking available since it's connected to the mall. Pics on instagram @amanda.n_"
Kevin M.,"Des Moines, WA",23,95,196,4.0,11/21/2015,"This place is fabulous. The location, the area, the parking, the ambiance and view, and the services are wonderful.  The food is good, not great. The shots are wonderful and the mixes and house cocktails are very delicious.  Only concern about 1 dessert which was the beignet with ice cream. It was very dense and it was like eating a regular doughnut. They should've just called it a donut instead of a beignet.  But overall I would comeback to this restaurant."
Adry J.,"Seattle, WA",0,1,,1.0,10/27/2016,"The only reason i got to Bj's is because i really like the SEARED AHI SALAD, but unfortunately the last couple of time i have been having a really bad experience.... Here is what is say in the description of this salad : Baby field greens (which it was none)  Napa cabbage (it has like a brownish color)   romaine and red bell peppers (tons of bell peppers)  tossed with rice wine vinaigrette.  With tomatoes ( literally the tomato cut in half) avocado (old avocado color brown) pickled cucumber (just two pieces and with a funny color) cilantro, ( none) wasabi( even though i say i dont want they put alot of it crisp wonton strips (6 of them)  and green onions ( instead big chunks of white onion) Tuna ( 5 pieces of thin and small tuna and not fresh at all really strong fishy taste) All this happens in the southcenter Tukwila location im scared to order next time i think they will going to give me all the left overs of the other salads because that was the look that this salad has really bad presentation"
Sarah J.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,,2.0,9/8/2017,"I tried to give this southcenter BJ's a third try, and after this night I will never come back. Came here with my boyfriend at 8pm on a Monday night, and wasn't greeted nor seated for 7 minutes. It was not busy at all, there was no one else waiting. When we finally got seated our waitress didn't come to our table until 8:30. I can't remember her name; she's white and wore glasses. When she took our order she said, ""so what do you want?"" She was rude and unattentive. I understand if you're having a bad day, but if you're still on the clock then set aside your attitude. The food didn't come out until 9:30; an hour and 30 minutes since we first walked in. It was alright, though nothing special. Basic, blan, salty, definitely not worth your $$."
Diane S.,"Lancaster, CA",18,20,,1.0,7/17/2017,"This was a disappointing dining experience.  Our server seemed 'out of it' the entire time.  She took everyone's order... stopped in the middle to leave to get makeup out of her eye then came back and forgot to take my husbands order until we reminded her.  We all ordered our dinner items and he ordered the soup and salad.. which, might I add is not in the appetizers section.  A food runner comes out 5 minutes later with his soup and salad... so glad we went to dinner as a family for him to eat alone awkwardly as we all tried to pass the time. He didn't send it back because let's be honest, they would have put it under a heat lamp.  It took another 20 minutes for the rest of our food so not only did my husband have to wait after he was done eating for our food to come out, but he also had to wait until we were all done eating.  The server checked on us right after we got our food and then would walk past our table several times not even to refill our drinks.  I saw the manager check on several tables, but would literally walk past ours without so much as any acknowledgement.  The server honestly didn't deserve the less than 15% tip I left.   It is important to note that it was NOT a busy evening."
Ann W.,"Auburn, WA",0,1,,1.0,8/29/2017,"I used to love BJ's food and especially their shoestring fries!!  But the last 5 times we've gone there in the past 7 months have been well below par. The service was horrible...it takes 5 minutes to get a menu and water, then another 25 minutes for food.  Twice they brought the wrong item and had to wait another 20 min.  Now they got rid of the shoestring fries, so basically they've failed on every level.  A pizookie is the only thing they have going for them, but the service is so bad, it's not worth it."
Jaimie H.,"Renton, WA",19,15,18,3.0,8/19/2016,"Not surprised at how low quality customer service they had to offer, walked in and wasn't greeted and wasn't seated for a while (note:they weren't even busy) and when we were noticed they were very rude! Food on the other hand was delicious, I order ahi tuna salad for $15.25!"
Doris J.,"Federal Way, WA",309,92,156,3.0,12/2/2015,I like this place. I don't go often but when I do I always end up liking it. Their deep dish pizzas are really good but I'm just more of a thin crust NYC style pizza person. I do really like their bbq chicken pizza though.  Their happy hour is really good especially the appetizers. I don't kow why but their fresh mozzerella and tomato salad is really good... I know it's nothing special but everytime I get it I like it. Their stuffed mushrooms are also yummy.  One thing I really do love is their parmesan crusted chicken. It has this amazing tangy white sauce.  I do love their pizookies!! it's a good place to grab a bite and beers with friends.
DeeRonn B.,"Tustin, CA",284,2,,5.0,1/14/2017,"California native visiting the area for the weekend. My party decided on BJs and had the server Sojin. The service was amazing, his personality was very down to earth and it's refreshing to have a server making jokes with you and creating a friendly atmosphere. I gave him my word that I would write a positive review in his favor, while complimenting on the great food BJs always has to offer. I'm pleased with my experience and will stop by again if I'm ever in the area."
Lindsey M.,"Renton, WA",39,9,1,3.0,9/16/2016,"I'll start by saying that my 3 star rating is strictly for the food quality/price. I can't speak for the service as a whole, as my first time at this location was about a week ago and we had a horrible server. The only thing that saved our visit this evening for our 4 year anniversary was our server, Sojin. If reviews were based solely on one staff member, I would be giving 5 stars. Actually, the only reason I'm writing a review is to recognize him. Being as I have been a server/bartender for over 15 years myself, I pick up almost instantly if the service is going to be good or bad. As soon as he greeted us I knew we would be taken care of. Awesome and REAL personality, proper timing, prompt on orders, refills, clearing, and checking up on us and his entire section. Now, the food is definitely a different story. Although the menu is quite large, most of the food is less than mediocre and over priced. I ordered a steak tonight, medium temperature, that came out more than well done-it was hard as a rock. Cold mashed potatoes and shriveled up asparagus. I was hesitant to allow the guy delivering the food to make me a new one as we had already waited 45 minutes and a steak is not a fast re-cook item but he walked away and made that decision anyway. It's fine, I get it, stuff happens and I understand that more than the usual guest. Where they really lost me was bringing me another well done steak 20 minutes later. By this point (I'm 9 months pregnant) I really didn't give a damn and ate it anyway. Pretty sad when a cook, whom I assume is at least somewhat experienced, can't even get a re-cook item close to correct.    Thank you, Sojin, for making our night less irritating all around!"
Huong L.,"Renton, WA",114,407,943,3.0,10/30/2015,"Came here for the Pizookie and did not disappoint. Got the the sampler which was smaller portion of a big Pizookie but got to try 3 different types. Got the salted caramel, the peanut butter, white chocolate macadamia. My favorite was the macadamia one, followed by the peanut butter. Sadly the salted caramel was the least favorite because it was not salty and it was mostly chocolate and caramel which made it a little too rich for my taste. Service was not that great either, had to wave our server down a couple of times to come give us water."
