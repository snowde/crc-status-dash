Jack S.,"Frisco, TX",10,112,5,4.0,9/13/2017,"Havent always been impressed, but i visited last week and had a perfectly cooked sirloin.  It was awsome.  Looking forward to going back."
Emily M.,"Grand Prairie, TX",23,120,88,3.0,8/23/2016,"Bjs is pretty hit or miss for me.   Its never bad,  but never spectacular either.   Beer selection is amazing and the bar doesn't disappoint.  The menu is insane and huge.   Its overwhelming and difficult to peruse.   If you ever find something you LOVE,  it will be gone from the menu next time you go.   Pazookies are pretty darn good,  they should bring back the smores one,  oh and the pizza dip!!  Service is generally slow so be prepared to spend some time here.  Sitting in the bar doesn't remedy this.  DO NOT go here for a quick lunch."
Luis S.,"Irving, TX",46,76,67,4.0,4/4/2017,Not a beer guy myself. Atleast not until the past few months or so. I ordered a sampler and tried all their ciders. I loved the one that tasted like black cherry. I had thier ziti. It was spot on! It had meat as I think it should! Service was alright. I won't b running back but I would return.
Alan W.,"Austin, TX",0,14,,1.0,11/12/2017,"This place SUCKS. Five of us went on a Friday night and food, beer and service ALL SUCKED. Rude waitress with poor attitude (Elisha S) was clearly not interested in providing service. We had burgers, pizza, salad, beer, cheese curds and none were really acceptable, despite been ridiculously expensive. Sloppy and crappy food paired with lousy service cross this place off our list of places to go a second time. No excuse for this level of incompetence in a bar or restaurant -- even in Tyler, Texas. Need to get their act together or get out of hospitality business."
Steve M.,"Tyler, TX",0,20,,4.0,11/8/2017,Food and service always good. This trip (9/24/17) wife had her default Asian Chicken Salad and I tried (and liked) the BBQ salad.
Eric T.,"Fort Worth, TX",686,810,2065,3.0,7/11/2015,"I've heard about the BJ's chain for quite some time, so I decided that during my brief trip into Tyler, I would try it out. In trying this brand for the first time, I left the location neither overwhelmed nor underwhelmed. It was sort of a ""meh"" experience.  THE GOOD: Customer service was really good. The hostess informed me that she would seat me with her best server, of which I agreed that the server was cool & attentive, for the most part. There was one moment where it took her nearly 8 minutes to bring me a glass of ice water due to me biting into a pepper, yet I let it go when I noticed that she had a large table of 8 guests that required 8 drinks + my water on a tray. Yes, I was empathetic toward her current situation. The decor of BJ's was nice. Certainly a place that I would bring my wife to, considering that the artwork looked really good, in addition to the color scheme throughout the venue. Not your typical bar restaurant, that's for sure. THE SO-SO: I'm a major IPA draft brew drinker, and I know a good one when I taste it. The IPA that I had on this evening was so-so: hoppy, yes. But the expected bite: not the best, yet not terrible either. It just didn't leave me excited to order another one. If I like a brew, I usually order 2-3. For tonight, it was one, which is a rarity for me. To top that off, I also enjoy Hefeweizen brews (thank you, Gordon Biersch), which is a German wheat-type of brew. To say the least, the Hefeweizen served at this location was not very good. In fact, it totally sucked. I was grateful for my server in giving me a sample of it first. I couldn't even finish half of the sample, considering that I felt a headache coming on. Yeah, that bad. I'm pretty sure the little man in the freezer had an off-day when it came to tapping the beer kegs today. SMH. The entree of the California flat bread was not bad. I was hungry, so I was not terribly picky about it. But one thing that I noticed was that the flat bread was more chewy as opposed to crunchy. Flat breads usually have a texture to that of a saltine cracker. This flat bread tasted more like a Domino's Pizza thin-crust pizza that was left on the kitchen's heat lamp for 15 minutes. I appreciated the server for not charging me for avocado slices on my flat bread, yet even with that, I thought that it was ""meh."" But again, I was hungry, and didn't have that ""I need a Snickers Bar moment"" by being overly too critical. Altogether, I would have to give either this BJs or another one a second try to have a full appreciation of what they offer. For this evening, it wasn't the best, yet not the worst either. It was just ""meh."""
Brittani B.,"Keller, TX",0,34,10,3.0,5/14/2017,"I came here for Mother's Day. We were supposed to go to Texas Roadhouse, but the wait was 2 hours long. So, that won't work. I saw that there was a BJ's brewhouse nearby, and I got excited because I used to work at the Cheesecake Factory, and I know that the companies are similar!! So I called and asked how long the wait was.. only about 20 minutes!!! Wooo!! So we get here, and we get out at a small table barely able to seat us (we are a group of 5 adults and 2 children). Not that big of a deal I guess... but they have plenty of empty tables (some including the big round tops) that are available. We ended up moving ourselves over there. Okay so our waitress was overall not that great. She'd take forever to come ask us if we needed anything. We had to flag her down, which is embarrassing because we don't want to be those guest. She also wouldn't pick up our empty appetizer plates after we were done, they were taking up all of our space too. We had to ask her to take them, to which she replied she was helping another table and she'd help us when our food came. Oh hold on, she just took my baked potato away from me after I had just taken a bite out of it. Just because we were ordering dessert doesn't mean I was finished with my main course. In fact lady, we weren't even done eating when you came and asked if we wanted dessert, don't y'all normally wait until we are done? Ugh... luckily I don't live around here so at least I'll be back in south lake eating at the other location. I won't have to worry about this happening again."
Roshan B.,"Tyler, TX",1,18,,5.0,4/28/2017,Hands down my Favorite place to go for pizza. Love the deep dish! And honestly every kind is great!  Pazookies are amazing! Chocolate chunk and cookies n cream are my favorite!! Their drinks are also great. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants all around!!
Joe H.,"Greeley, CO",9,283,25,5.0,2/21/2015,"Oh My God. (or OMG if you prefer). Italian Market Pizza is likely the best pizza I've had in the most recent years of my life. So Good... Beers are awesome. They have probably 40 taps for beers (check their website for info), but they also have about a dozen more taps with their own brewed beers. I had a pint each of the blond, Piranha Pale, and the hefeweizen.  All were good.  I've found my new favorite place in Tyler."
Rachel R.,"Dallas, TX",722,938,2737,4.0,10/19/2014,"I have eaten at BJ's before and have come here often to order a pizookie. This time, though we  came around 11:15am and had lunch.  We started off with the chips and salsa, which were surprisingly really tasty. I liked that the chips were thicker and the salsa had a great taste to it.  I ordered it the chicken club with thin and crispy french fries. The portion was huge and I could not finish all the fries and I was lucky to finish my sandwich. The chicken club was really good. I would definitely order it agian. I loved that it was on garlic texas toast. Yum! My only complaint would be that the avacado was too ripe. I had to scrape it off... Our server was less than enthused to be waiting on our table. She was not friendly and not very quick or attentive.   Overall, this was a delicious lunch. I would suggest coming in. If you come for lunch, it is not very busy!"
Traphena L.,"Tyler, TX",15,123,27,4.0,12/28/2016,"BJs is one of those lazy restaurant choices. If you are like me and have a hard time choosing a place to eat, just go to BJs because they have everything on their menu. I've had the pizza, burgers (of course), chicken, jambalaya, chicken sandwich, and they are all good! The waiter or waitress is always is good about helping you choose when you are stuck. I can't leave out the pizookies, that's one of the main reasons to go. I only get the chocolate chip one and it's by far the best in my opinion. It's always served hot, which I love. BJs is the way to go for any type of craving."
Daniel W.,"Quitman, TX",0,51,1,3.0,11/29/2016,"Came for a decent, relatively inexpensive meal. Maybe we should've browsed the menu a little more because we discovered when our bill showed up that the medium pizza, that had mediocre flavor, was over $20!! The service was ok but we had to ask the server every, single time we wanted something removed from our table, and it was a very small, two-person table. The salad didn't come out prior to the meal and when asked for lemon for the Caesar Salad and fish, it didn't get brought until the meal was 1/2 way completed. We'd come back, but sadly we were not impressed at all."
Earl D.,"Tyler, TX",9,16,,5.0,10/31/2016,This is a nice addition to Tyler's restaurants. The food is good and the selection at the bar is very good.
Robyn M.,"Athens, TX",241,516,381,4.0,5/4/2016,"I got the Portobello & Swiss Burger All-Vegetarian Version, which is both vegetarian-friendly & delicious. I would get that one again. They also have an app for this place where you can keep track of any deals, & rack up points for every dollar spent on the food (not including alcoholic beverages or tips), & you can get a discount after you reach 100 points. I think the restrooms were well-maintained, & had at least 2 stalls. I hope to come back to this place!"
Colt W.,"Tyler, TX",15,27,,5.0,1/9/2017,This is a good place to hang out. It's nice to come here. The root beer is really good. No ice! Haha. Good food nice people.
Richard R.,"Tyler, TX",0,22,1,2.0,6/17/2017,"The food is over rated. The wait staff are always friendly and timely. I've eaten here on several occasions and it's always the same. The steaks are average and the pizzas, sandwiches and sides are just OK. Nothing here stands out and makes them notable. The only time I eat here is when others who have no standards insist."
Briana C.,"Tyler, TX",2,16,3,2.0,5/25/2017,"We like coming to BJ's for dessert but tonight we went for dinner and dessert. We waited a whole 30 minutes to be seated. I know the servers saw us waiting and no one came to even tell us that they didn't have enough people to or they will be with us shortly. BJ's wasn't packed at all. I was pretty upset with tonight, I don't think we will be going back for a while."
Marggi W.,"Tyler, TX",0,6,,5.0,12/22/2016,"I love the atmosphere, the food, and the Jeremiah Red.  They also have a gluten free menu and   take their responsibility to the gluten free very seriously.  Our service was great and the manager was very alert and hands on. We will definitely go again."
Maddie T.,"Waco, TX",151,12,1,5.0,9/16/2016,This is the best experience I've had so far at BJ's! Our server Maria M was fabulous! I got the happy hour Cab Sav- a Dark Horse for $5! What a steal! I had two before happy hour was over... So yummy! Boyfriend got the first picture they had on the menu - an After Hours Burger. Man that thing looked yummy. He took a tiny bit home because of the large portion. Great value! I got the Lemon Thyme chicken with no butter as I have a dairy allergy. It was SO. YUMMY. I had to force myself to put my fork down. Overall a really great visit to BJ's!!
M B.,"Tyler, TX",3,19,,5.0,2/2/2016,"I always find friendly people here, no matter when I come in or where I sit. The bartender with blonde hair going to school for RX tech was the friendliest person!  Everything I order has always been great, and their menu is so varied! I like that they have a patio, too."
Debbie B.,"Tyler, TX",31,20,1,4.0,7/29/2016,"The recipes they have are great. I like the atmosphere if I'm with a group of friends, it's fun. The wait staff are trained very well, they are friendly and fast. The restaurant appears to be clean considering how many people walk through everday"
Soo L.,"Franklin Lakes, NJ",0,24,5,4.0,4/1/2016,Considering it's a chain restaurant I thought it was above average. They have alot of options from healthy to serious grub food. Our server Samantha was the best! Super attentive and super nice. It's rare to have a server that actually likes to serve. She was so friendly and so on point! GREAT Job!!!
Rachel H.,"Tyler, TX",1,7,1,5.0,7/6/2016,I visited BJ's with my husband last night and I was very pleased with the food and service. Our server was friendly and always brought us drink refills promptly. I ordered the sirloin and it was probably the most tender I've ever had! It was cooked to perfection and the seasoning tasted delicious. I signed up for BJs Rewards and received a mini pizookie of my choice for free.
Cheryl G.,"Tyler, TX",12,105,244,5.0,5/28/2015,"Ate dinner here last night. It was awesome! I love that they have lighter entrees for those of us watching our calories and regular great stuff for everybody else. I have only had one experience at this restaurant when I was not pleased about a year ago and when I spoke with the manager he was quick to make it right as best he could. I returned several times since then. My family and I love this place. This is a good quality restaurant with great food, employees etc... The manager is great. Great beer, awesome food, always get what I order as ordered. Order the bison burger or the salmon, the pizza is phenomenal. My kids love it too! No complaints. Give it a try."
Jennifer H.,"League City, TX",67,24,9,4.0,5/30/2016,"We ended up here because it was open, so I will give them an extra star for not being closed at 9 p.m.  We also enjoy a pitcher of the PM Porter. The food is always pretty good. I like the pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are good."
Andrea A.,"Gilmer, TX",0,2,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Today was my first experience at this place. It took forever I'm talking 30 minutes easy that I waited on my burger. When it arrived you could tell it had been sitting maybe 20 minutes,it was the guacamole bacon cheese burger with no bacon. Just imagine white cheese sitting on a burger for 20 minutes. The guacamole was room temperature,the fries taste like wax and the patty was like rubber. The manager offered me a complimentary cup of soup on a very hot day. I requested he remove the burger from the tab. If zero stars were available I would've given that. Horrible experience with this place."
Brandon C.,"Flint, TX",0,25,,5.0,4/12/2016,"I love this place.  I've been here with my wife a few times.  Its a bit expensive, but still great food!"
Ali M.,"Tyler, TX",1,25,3,5.0,12/9/2015,I love love looove BJ's...they have so many options I can never decide what to get when I go there and every dish I've ever gotten there has been great. Also great service and atmosphere!!
Tony S.,"Marble Falls, TX",411,164,43,5.0,9/30/2015,"My experience here was definitely 5 stars. The food was great, service was great and the place was clean. Manager even came up to Che k in on us to make sure everything was good. No complaints!"
Review S.,"Tyler, TX",3,170,4,3.0,12/22/2015,"While I enjoyed the atmosphere and the wonderful beer selection, the food was just OK.  Maybe I'm just not ordering the right thing.  Tried their Mahi Mahi and it was waaaaaaay overcooked, rubbery and tasteless.  Next trip was a so-so salad and really good wings.  Their private label beers are great and the atmosphere, while very much a sports bar, is definitely upscale."
S. Karina M.,"Tyler, TX",1,9,,2.0,8/16/2014,"Food is good. Drinks (of the spirited sorts) are inconsistently made. Service is slow and pretty rough. If the service was better and more consistent we would frequent BJs more often. The pazookies are the bomb but not worth the shady service. The last two times we were there, we found long hairs in one of our dishes. We also ended up sitting our booths for over 2 hours both times due to the slow service.  We used to frequent the BJs in Cedar Park a lot and they were great. Here, not so much."
Julio C R.,"Garden Grove, CA",94,40,4,5.0,12/15/2015,"Tasty mushroom Swiss burger and happy hour wine. Never a bad meal here, whether in Texas or California. Service was good and attentive. Potato wedges over the fries any day."
Stacy C.,"Tucson, AZ",0,9,,2.0,5/24/2015,"Terribly run place that's atypical of a BJs Restaurant.    This is the second time that I have run into this problem.  After sitting for 10 minutes without anyone bothering to take our drink order, we walked out.  I attempted to call the manager and was routed to someone else first.  The host staff were very young and either haven't been trained or don't care about customer service.  The manager apologized and offered me a gift card but I refused.  I just wanted them to be aware of their lack of training or care less attitude.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the Tyler area to go to, which is what we did."
Thomas C.,"Lufkin, TX",1,8,1,5.0,2/3/2016,We've come here several times and it is always a pleasure. Tonight was exceptional. My wife had the arugala and Portobello mushroom salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. We will be back!
John W.,"Wood, TX",3,10,,4.0,11/24/2015,Service can be questionable at times but the vast menus and awesome beers bridge the gap! Deep dish pizza..... Yep!
Kayla D.,"King of Prussia, PA",1,8,,1.0,1/19/2015,"If I could give zero stars I would. Ended up leaving because we sat at our table for 20 mins and not a single waiter came to even take our drinks . Once I went up to the hostess and let her know, she gave me a nasty attitude and said someone would be over. No one came within 5 mins, we walked out and will NEVER give them our business."
Cecilia H.,"Tyler, TX",112,30,8,5.0,7/13/2015,"Just about everything is good here!! Pizzas are a favorite, California is my favorite. The pizzookies are delicious. Burgers are great! California and jalapeño aware the best! For appetizers, the tacos are small but good. If you get the buffalo wontons, you might want to double your order. Their crispy fries aristo die for! The soups and pasta are their weakness. So just stay away from those and you're solid! The Jeremiah red is one of the most popular and tasty beers. For the girls, there's a strawberry drink that's creamy and comes with a pine apple on the side, that's $10 but awesome!!"
Christine V.,"Tyler, TX",74,48,51,4.0,11/4/2012,This place is alright...  I have gotten very good service and yummy food.  The menu annoys me because it's a freaking NOVEL (but i do not subtract points because of that). The entrees and salads are usually very good. The pizza crust and toppings are very good however their portioning of the two needs a little work.  The best part about this place is the beer... such a variety and their brews are great and the porter goes well with their yumyum pazookies!  Great place for a group of people because it is bound to have something to satisfy everyone!
Paul S.,"Longview, TX",8,29,3,5.0,1/19/2015,"Love this place, especially for a chain. Always friendly bartenders. Wonderful selection of craft beers. I personally love their brew, Jeremiah Red. Pizza is wonderful too."
Jeannie H.,"Winnsboro, TX",0,9,1,1.0,1/18/2015,Not impressed. I just can't figure out what the hype is. Like the hype on In and out Burgers. It will be a one time experience.
