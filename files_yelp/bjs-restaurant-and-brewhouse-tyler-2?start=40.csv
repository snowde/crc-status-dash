Mark G.,"Kilgore, TX",24,243,13,3.0,11/26/2013,"Man! I really want to upgrade the star rating but I can't. The place has an atmosphere that makes me want to come back. And I will but, the service was not good. I had 3 beers and the first 2 went dry long before I got a refill. If I had Diet Coke, those were refilled immediately. But this is a 'brew' house. Beer is supposed to flow, right? We met some close friends in a relaxing atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed the app and our dinner. I did like the beer solicited by the waiter. If only he had as good as the hops. Will I go back? Yes, of course but the service needs to pick it up a level."
Neil C.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,50,13,4.0,6/30/2015,"BJ'S is pretty standard everywhere... wrong this location is great, the staff is nice, the vibe is great, you got sports coming from all the possible angles, beer is decent, and food is great. They made me feel like if I was in California, not a bad thing at all."
Gregg R.,"Tyler, TX",0,16,2,5.0,7/26/2015,Awesome beer selection.  Good food and great atmosphere. I like the new Enlightened Menu.
Jen G.,"Kilgore, TX",20,203,72,4.0,11/26/2013,"Nice dinner place.  We met friends for a celebration dinner. I had the Southwest salad. It was okay for a salad. I also ordered root beer because I heard it was good. Mine was flat, but the waiter did warn me in advance they were having some carbonation issues. The atmosphere was nice. We enjoyed talking with our friends in a fairly quiet space. We will go back."
Jedidiah S.,"Longview, TX",0,3,,2.0,7/7/2015,I guess I should know better than to go into an establishment such as this and expect anything other than bar food quality! I ordered the couscous with mahi and shrimp. The menu image is nothing like what came to the table. Delivered was a mahi and shrimp soup. I could have gotten a better meal at Chipotle...in the same parking lot for half the price! On the upside the wait staff was courteous and attentive with no complaints there.
Kim R.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",108,69,21,4.0,3/3/2014,"Little bit above the chains and restaurants around town. Nice decor and bar. Had some  burgers, nothing that memorable. Their pizza sounded good and nice size menu.  Quiet but I'm sure the crowd picks up on Friday and Saturday. Of course pleasant southern service.  Check it out."
Altovise L.,"Schertz, TX",50,39,10,4.0,10/16/2014,The BJ's brewed beers are delicious. Hearty portions of food. The pork chops are amazing!
Brittany P.,"Tyler, TX",213,7,2,4.0,8/2/2015,"If I want to go somewhere that I know has a variety of drinks this is the place I would go! So many different kinds of beer from light to dark, and mixed drinks. A little pricy but totally worth it! A huge variety of food!"
John M.,"Bullard, TX",0,8,,4.0,2/20/2016,"My wife and I frequently eat at BJ's and we both like their food, service and ambiance.  The kitchen does a nice job, is consistent from day to day, and a meal at BJ'S is always a pleasant experience. Wait times are generally short and, the one time the wait exceeded 15 minutes, they served free Pizza while we waited. The menus is sufficiently varied that there is something to fit just about any taste. Wish they would add fajitas to the menu."
Kim D.,"Tyler, TX",58,34,3,4.0,3/3/2011,"My husband and I have now been to BJ's twice since they opened this week, most recently today. Both times, we were happy with our meals and service. They have a great selection of beers, especially for Tyler--many of which are brewed in-house. Their lunch specials are very reasonable (it was $30 for the two of us, pre-tip, including 3 beers).  Their menu has a good selection of American food -- pizzas, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, soup, steak, etc. Everything that we've had was good. So far we've tried pizza, various soups, salad, and sandwiches, and didn't have anything that we didn't like. Everything was fresh, and the waitstaff was friendly and helpful. They are located in the parking lot of the Tyler mall, and have a nice outdoor patio. There is a full bar inside, along with ample seating and big booths.  I would definitely recommend giving them a try. I would give them 5 stars, but I think their non-lunch prices are a touch high for the area. Other than that, though, they are great."
Marcy H.,"Longview, TX",0,14,,2.0,9/10/2014,Food is very overpriced for quality.  Everything I have ordered is typical chain restaurant flavor.  Slow service  as well.  Such a shame because it has a very nice atmosphere.   My son does like the root beer but they were out of it when we were there Sunday.
Brent R.,"Searcy, AR",2,31,15,4.0,10/10/2014,Really good food and a couple of their microbrew craft beers really hit the spot with me. I've had decent service every time as well; if I were to point out anything it would be that it's a tad too expensive but with the level of U.S. inflation it's not too bad.
Bob W.,"Tyler, TX",3,18,,2.0,12/28/2015,"Food is ok, selection is awesome though.  They changed their happy hours prices so won't go their anymore for that.  Used to be $4 you call its.  Now it's $1 off.  So $7.25+ for well drinks.  Prob not.  BJ's please change your happy hour back.  Thanks!"
Bill S.,"Dallas, TX",81,348,33,4.0,11/19/2012,Praise the Lord that Tyler has a BJ's.  I have to go to Tyler every month or two for work and I almost always end up at the bar here for happy hour and dinner.  I always get great service and the bartender(I wish I remembered her name) always remembers what I like to drink even if it's been a few months since my last visit.   I would imagine they have one of the best beer selections in the area and during happy hour all drafts are $1 off.  They also have appetizer and mini-pizzas at a discount during happy hour as well.
Melody T.,"Las Colinas, TX",608,639,2746,5.0,1/14/2013,Went here with one of my girlfriends and we were at the bar and we had the most amazing Bar girl...I think her name was Tiffany (black girl) She was super nice and very attentive! BJ's is already my fav spot...but this visit Tiffany did a great job serving us!
Mike P.,"Decatur, TX",0,37,,2.0,11/14/2015,"My last trip there was not great, the steak wasn't right or very good. Tried them again, and the food was good but the service was not.  I'm not real big on being treated like an inconvenience when I go into a restaurant.  There's other places that will be more than happy to have me spend money with them."
Robert S.,"Hawkins, TX",12,141,5,4.0,10/13/2012,"I like their new menu additions.  I met a friend and his wife here the other night for dinner and drinks.  I had their deep dish meatlovers pizza.  Nice crust, loaded with toppings.  And I had plenty to carry home.  My friend's wife had the shrimp jambalaya which she said was good but a little spicy.  Oooo, just like I like it!!  And my friend had the new Angus Chicken Fried Steak.  Ample two patty serving, and it was meat to the end of the crust, not foolery with a 1/2"" or more of empty crust.  looked good.  Our drinks were good, she had margaritas, he had Oktoberfest, and I had Oktoberfest and Tatonka.  The Oktoberfest was good and hoppy with ample carbonation and the Tatonka was thick and rich.  Ummm, ummm.  The only problem that night was that BJ's staff violated the Texas Dram laws and grossly overserved us. The next afternoon, I was back in Tyler and nursing a severe ""headache"" and ""sour stomach.""  Remembering my friend's CFS, I thought, ""That is just what I need.""  And it was.  The double patty was filling, and the meat inside was tender.  The crust could have been seasoned a bit more, but there was salt and pepper on the table.  And the cream gravy was very good.  Only complaint was that the mixed vegetables were frozen, but I didn't come back for the mixed vegetables.  And no beer this time!!! But all in all, very good visits.  Just as I've had in all more other visits here."
Laura M.,"McKinney, TX",12,26,5,1.0,6/2/2015,Was served lunch menu ordered the flatbread pizza with salad the lettuce looked bad I picked out 9 pieces of either brown lettuce or lettuce with black slimy lettuce disgusting I told bartender and he picked up the bad lettuce and put in trash later I asked did you tell manager about the lettuce he said yes but manager did nothing his name was Collin I will gladly pay for good food but they should of taken $1-2 off the price I feel that would of been fair of course when I was leaving I told bartender I think they should of taken something off since I couldn't eat the salad then his reply was I will check after I paid or he would get me salad with good lettuce well you should serve good lettuce to begin with I went tuesday June 2 at 12:30 what a disappointment
Nini L.,"Tyler, TX",0,34,,2.0,4/7/2016,"What did cod ever do to you, dear cook at BJs?! The ""lightly battered in blonde beer"" fish and chips came out like brown, deep fried grease sponges that one would expect at the carnival in the mall parking lot.  The beer was good, but not good enough to make me mindlessly consume the food.  We also tried the avocado spring rolls, which were basically undercooked Pilsbury crescent rolls stuffed with browning avocado and a lonely shred of a carrot... But the dipping sauce was sugary greatness, so we ate those, while watching other tables of very casually dressed individuals get down on various sundays and cheesecakes.  This is a place where I hope no one eats too often... Or perhaps we witnessed the gateway restaurant to Red Lobster.   That said, the server was very nice and we did get one half of one of the fish and chips taken off the bill.  The bill before the tip and after the reduction was $45, so next time we'll just go to the carnival."
Jeremy M.,"Plano, TX",0,24,,4.0,1/20/2014,"Barely gets that 4th star. I have traveled to Tyler for work for about 9 years now and, eating out every meal, have eaten at most of the restaurants there.  I have eaten here at least a dozen times. The menu is expansive, but stick with basics to be safe.  Some things are not good.  Fish and chips was horrible, seriously.  Only order it as a prank. Now to the good.  Open late, one of the few places I can eat at after a long evening drive to Tyler.  Real beers, with plenty of variety.  Full bar if you don't like beer. Burgers are consistently good, as are salads.  I usually have a burger and wedge salad.  Add a few beers to that, and I leave for the hotel happy."
