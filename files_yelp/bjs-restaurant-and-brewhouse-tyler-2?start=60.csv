Colonel H.,"Manassas, VA",0,104,1,5.0,2/16/2015,"BJ's has showed tremendous improvement!  We experienced outstanding food and service (from Cassie and Rebecca) during our recent two visits.  Once we dined in the bar area and most recently in a very busy main section.  Both times the service, which used to be very, very slow and nonattentive, was now outstanding -- friendly and fast.  The Mediterranean style chicken tacos are great."
Stephen W.,"Columbia, TN",148,36,12,2.0,12/27/2013,"First time at BJ's.  The avocado egg rolls weren't overly flavorful. They just tasted like fried avocados that came with an extremely sugary sauce.  The beer was not too bad. The nutty brown had a great flavor profile and the Irish red was smooth and delicious.  I had a gluten free pizza. Kudos to the crust for being pretty edible. I know it's hard to do, but the sauce wasn't very good and they forgot to put roasted garlic on.  The service could use some work. Christopher was trying, but doesn't quite understand the steps of service. This could be a lack of training on the restaurants part, which I fully understand. Let alone the large gaps in time between table visits, we had empty glasses and plates sitting around and after he came to ask us if the food was alright I had to prompt him as he walked away to take the empty glasses and things to free up space. So, more attention to pre-bussing and checking in would definitely be a welcome aspect of the experience."
Kenny K.,"Tyler, TX",24,4,43,5.0,10/26/2012,Great food at not too bad of prices! Beer is superb. I had the parmesan crusted chicken and it was phenomenal. Definitely recommend it.
Erica H.,"Tyler, TX",2,65,,5.0,7/10/2015,Love all the salads and the lighter options to choose from. Always a good spot for lunch.
Al B.,"Shreveport, LA",64,62,19,4.0,4/9/2014,"Great brew! Food was good too! Friendly service.... just nothing to complain about. Try the exclusive brews, they're good."
Kristie A.,"Dallas, TX",947,761,2843,3.0,6/13/2011,"It's a chain.  In Tyler.  A busy place since it's fairly new, I assume.  I didn't eat at this location, but they had Piraat so kudos to them.  We were initially sitting outside in the heat, and a lovely manager or some such moved us into the bar area.  There were about 15 of us and service was really good.  The few people who ate seemed to enjoy their food.  I remember the Mesquite location and not being impressed, though.  So I give this place an A-OK for the awesome beer selection."
Elizabeth J.,"Houston, TX",5,85,7,4.0,3/28/2015,"We love us some BJ's. You HAVE to get a pazookie when you go, you can never be too full for a pazookie at the end of a meal! I like the trio because then you can try 3 different kinds! All time favorite is the chocolate chip of course. The pulled pork sandwich is probably our favorite thing on the menu main course wise."
David E.,"Longview, TX",0,2,,1.0,2/13/2013,My  wife found a clump of hair in the melted cheese of her sandwich. We will never go back there again.
Joel C.,"Alpena, MI",3,7,2,4.0,5/11/2014,Went here for mothers day. Had to call ahead because they were really busy. Had a server named winter and she was great. Recommended great food and drinks for the table. I'm from Michigan and I'm a bartender that serves craft beers all day long. I tried their nitro porter and their stout. Both were pretty mid level 3/5 stars. But for Texas craft beer it was great. Food was awesome and so was the service. Tip: order the pizookie before you are done with the meal. They are made fresh and take time to bake.
Lori L.,"Gladewater, TX",62,28,5,5.0,3/18/2011,"Yummy food!  This just opened in Tyler so there is still a bit of a wait.  We started out with chips and salsa. (wasn't too impressed, since we live in texmex country). We waited a bit for our food and the manager brought it out and told us since we waited a while we get free dessert.. Score!  I didn't even think it had been that long!  I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and onion strings. It had two chicken fried steaks on it. Huge meal, the gravy was fantastic and tasted like they use real cream. My hubby ordered balsamic chicken on a field of greens with onion strings. I don't even like balsamic and I loved this meal!  His had two chicken breast and mashed potatoes with white cheddar in it.  So we both have enough food for a second meal. Mine cost $10, his $12. So if you consider that will feed us twice it's not too bad. They are definitely big enough to share!! Will eat there again and again!!  We tried the root beer they brew there and it was good."
Todd S.,"Tyler, TX",58,298,211,3.0,9/26/2011,"Good pizza if you like Chicago style. My wife always seems to order the pot roast. Excellent selection of micro brews, however bring your savings account, as the beers run $5 per pint. Boo!.  Not a good bar to watch sports, the TV's are against one wall only. Overall good menu, and I have not ordered anything that I was unhappy with."
Maggie H.,"Allen, TX",1,27,10,2.0,1/19/2014,"We came into Bj around 6pm on Sunday...So all the tv were on and found of football and loud music was almost too much. The bartender was probably preoccupied with the game to make my drink???  The food was average, my burger did not have any flavor and the fries were cold. I think the staff were all more interested in watching Tv ....This was a complete waste of money..I don't recommend this place"
Steven H.,"Allen, TX",0,69,20,2.0,1/20/2014,"Had a Burger and Beer at dinner last night. Loud, sports on tv. Service was slow. Food was flavorless. Very disappointed."
Shawna E.,"Paris, TX",10,38,7,1.0,12/2/2012,Never received the appetizer we ordered and pizzas were not near as good as I have had at other BJ' s restaurants....very disappointed!
Cory K.,"Whitehouse, TX",7,9,3,5.0,2/28/2013,"Everything I have had here has been really great. Save room for dessert, because the Pizookie is worth it. Especially the triple chocolate made with ghirardelli chocolate."
Amy S.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,3/14/2015,Not sure what's been going on here lately. We used to love BJ's but the service and food quality has really gone down in the past year. I've gotten a salad to go numerous times lately and it's been cold and they forgot the dressing! Lovely. Dry salad. The last time we tried take out it took over an hour. For to go food. No thanks. Not going back.
Mike N.,"Round Rock, TX",8,10,,1.0,7/10/2012,"Sit down, order dinner, a few beers and wait for MLB ALL-STAR game to start.  Ask manager to turn on the sound once the game begins.  He tells me he's not allowed, the powers to be only allow sound during ""events like the Super Bowl"".  I laugh, ask him what he thinks the MLB ALL-STAR game is, and he justs shrugs.  Clearly, just an assistant manager since he has no power (or balls).  I leave and get to new bar.  (Buffalo Wild Wings).   Pull out receipt from BJ's and laugh my ass off.  ""Come out and watch MLB games in HD on multiple screens"" just don't ask to HEAR them.  BJ's just opened two new locations in Austin where I live.  They will not be seeing me again. Everyone was nice, just dumb.  Figure it out. Mike N."
Kristen C.,"CORONA DL MAR, CA",38,2,,5.0,11/23/2013,"Amazing pizza, great beer, and tasty pazookies. We almost didn't eat here because of the other reviews, but we found the service fast and attentive. We'll be back!"
Suzanne A.,"Richardson, TX",1,17,14,2.0,10/5/2013,Got seated right away in nice size booth. Waitress Took order 10 minutes later but it took FOREVER to get our food. The fact that the food was good is the only reason I keep coming back. Service has a ton of room for improvement.
Carol H.,"Georgetown, TX",0,46,1,4.0,6/8/2012,"I had the fish tacos here (grilled mahi mahi) and they were excellent, possibly the best fish tacos I've ever had. Hubby had the hamburger and it was very good. Only complaint was that beers were all $6 or more, which is a bit pricy, even though they were all 16 oz. I would have been fine with a 12 oz. beer, but there didn't seem to be a choice. Overall, it was a very good dining experience."
