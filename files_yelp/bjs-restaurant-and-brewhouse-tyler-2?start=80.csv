steve d.,"Dallas, TX",4,95,,2.0,4/22/2013,"This is the typical prepackaged corporate fare, over processed and loaded with additives and sodium.  Tastes about as good as that type of food can, which is not very good.  Service was fine for a spot like this.  Felt very thirsty and MSG'ed later that day.  Worked out and had severe leg cramps for the first time in about 10 years.   Nice location and nice building but I will go into a dump if the food is good and freshly made."
Roho s.,"Whitehouse, TX",0,14,1,1.0,8/18/2011,"very nice building good atmosphere. food seemed frozen and heated up, apetizers and meal arrived at same time.  beer was nothing special. Served luke warm.  would say not worth trying.  It seems as though a lot of restaurants spend all there effort on decorating and advertising and just ignore the food."
Jared Z.,"San Mateo, CA",190,218,32,3.0,11/21/2011,"The food was fine, a very impressive beer selection, both their own stuff on tap and a selection of good bottles including some Belgians, impressive for Tyler. I'll come back for beer probably not for food."
Daniel M.,"Houston, TX",6,18,,4.0,3/26/2011,"I ate here with a really hot girl, a.k.a. my wife. Their pizzas are great, especially the Sweet Pig, which is sweet ham, pineapple, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. The barbecue chicken is pretty good also."
Bill K.,"Denton, TX",19,19,8,5.0,6/17/2011,"Pizza done right!  I take that back...EVERYTHING done right!  Great pizza, beer, and the French Dip Sandwich is TheBomb.Com!!!  My favorite beer is the Jeremiah Red...a rich, sweety, malty beer with a great balanced flavor."
Chris R.,"Tyler, TX",35,58,32,4.0,5/29/2011,"The restaurant was full, but we were seated right away at about 7:45 on a Wednesday night. Not a beer drinker, but the cream soda is good (and the son says thumbs up to the root beer as well). Avocado egg-rolls were a great appetizer. Mediterranean pizza was tasty but will wreck your breath for the remainder of the night! Service was attentive and pleasant. Price was reasonable."
Le B.,"Austin, TX",0,151,15,4.0,5/25/2011,"The beer is really good and I am just glad to have a brewery in Tyler.  The menu is huge, which takes away from the pub feel and moves it toward a much for TGIFridays vibe.  I always find it really noisy, and I usually have at least one kid of my own with me.  The food is decent.  The apps and small bites are the best things on the menu, though I thought the flatbread pizza was decent too."
Brenda H.,"Tyler, TX",0,22,,4.0,11/16/2011,We ate here on 11/15/2011. Had the Barbecue Chopped Chicken Salad-it was delicious! A very large salad that you can share with another person. Also had a Cosmopolitan - again delicious and there was actually alcohol in the drink (unlike some other restaurants). I will be back!
Ravnica I.,"Austin, TX",0,13,1,4.0,11/7/2013,"Tons for food for when you dont know what you dont know what to eat. Local brew on tab, even more on tap that is not local. Food has good portions, So far everything is decent. Better than most bar food. Good lunch specials. This location so far lives up to the reviews to other locations."
eric r.,"Longview, TX",0,12,,4.0,4/29/2011,"Cool place to eat, good atmosphere. Could be a wait but if you call ahead it won't take as long. Pretty good service also and if u like trying different beers then this is the place, I got the beet sampler of all the breast they make. It's a little pricey but I think its worth it."
katie t.,"Tyler, TX",275,3,1,5.0,5/4/2011,"My hubby & I have been there twice. They have great food and amazing service. We went the last time for my hubby's birthday. The brought my food out first with my husband soon behind. We were totally fine with it but the manager came out right away and apologized for the delay, which we honestly didn't even notice, and gave my hubby's dunner to us for free. Not to mention gave him a free birthday dessert as well!  Great place. I will be going back for sure."
