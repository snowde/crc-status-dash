Amy S.,"East Hartford, CT",27,17,5,5.0,12/3/2017,We had the Mediterranean tacos and they were outstanding! Also ordered the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was tasty and served with thin tortilla chips! The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Definitely will be back!
Lilith F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,9,21,1.0,12/2/2017,"I used to love this place. However, the manager is a power tripping jerk. It's part of the rewards programs perks that you can gift some of your points to another person. There are many websites, and groups where people share their rewards with others. I am part of many such groups.  I had gone to this establishment, and cashed in many of my gifted points on 6 different occasions without issue.  On the last trip, the manager shamed my son for cashing in loyalty points rather than paying him in cash for the order. He then cancelled my sons loyalty account, as well as mine, and my husbands.  The manager felt that since WE didn't earn the points, he had the right to take them away. He didn't. Those points were EARNED by many other people across the US who were kind enough to share them.  By deleting the points, he was saying that the hundreds of dollars these people had been spending to earn those points didn't matter.  I see what he did as theft.  He took EARNED points (used like gift cards) that weren't his, and three them away.  All while PUBLICLY SHAMING a teenage boy for being poor enough to have to rely on points to pay."
Kathleen L.,"Seminole, FL",28,31,29,2.0,10/29/2017,"The restaurant is set up to be inviting and roomy. The server really loves her job so it made our visit really nice. The food took a long time to come considering it was lunch hour on a work day. I had a disappointing bison burger. The bun was stale and dry, the frozen burger was definitely rare although ordered medium. There was approximately a 1/2 tsp of hatch peppers and two pieces of onion. Really disappointing. Although The server rocked, the system of having runners was lacking. Eight minutes for a coffee reheat and water refill?  Five minutes for the sour cream to come for for the baked potato (which had been requested when order was placed)?   I will give the establishment a second try to be fair but will not order the burger, tortilla soup (salty) or baked potato.  Will probably go with an appetizer or flat bread."
Eva R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",291,253,618,4.0,1/8/2018,"Came here for lunch during the holidays. The restaurant is huge but was pretty busy. I had the BJ's favorite mini pizza, which is perfect for one person. The pizza was thick and delicious! For dessert, we shared a pizookie trio. The peanut butter pizookie was amazing. It was cooked to that perfect doughy consistency and melted in my mouth. We also had the salted caramel pizookie and the classic. The salted caramel was delicious as well. Overall, a great place to grab lunch in the South Hills area."
Kara B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",38,73,24,5.0,1/8/2018,"I can't say enough good things about BJ's! First off, the menu is literally 20 pages. They have everything from burgers to pad Thai! They have a ton of beers to choose from, and the Blonde Ale is the best one in my opinion! Our waitress was SO nice and really treated me and my friends well! I will definitely return!"
Tina B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",132,323,607,4.0,10/22/2017,"Every time I've tried to eat here, there has been an extremely long wait. I finally came here with a few of my girlfriends and we were lucky to score a table at the bar when the wait for a table in the dining room was over an hour long.  The space is pretty nice. They have so many options (both food and drinks) to choose from so it can be a little overwhelming if you've never been here before. And that's exactly how I felt. At the end of the day, I ordered a flight of beer to sample their beer selection and our table shared a large deep dish pizza. I really liked everything I tried! The beers were good and went really well with the pizza. The crust on the pizza was crispy and buttery, which was perfect to me.  There is a long wait here for a reason. The atmosphere is fun, the food and drinks are good, and the menu is huge so there is something for everyone to like!"
Phil G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",72,276,1268,4.0,5/28/2017,"Ok, I've been back a few times since my first review and I have to say that on balance my wife and I like this place. There is a large menu and we've been going through it. Aside from the flat bread pizza appetizer, I don't think we've ordered the same thing twice. The atmosphere really helps. There is a buzz going on that just makes you glad to be there. We always enjoy a couple beers here too. Somehow we find the place comfortable! A great thing to do if there is a 20+ minute wait is to get a beer at the bar and wait there. You won't even realize you're waiting! Another nice thing is paying with their app - you don't even have to wait for the waitress to bring the check!"
Mindy T.,"Imperial, PA",0,15,,5.0,1/6/2018,"This place has thee most AHHHHHMAZING burgers!!! This is the only place we will go to get a good burger and we don't really live close but it's worth the drive. Just wish it was a little bit bigger, must go there!! Wish I could give more stars! Put one in a Robinson it would make a killing out here!"
Steph H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,53,5,3.0,9/7/2017,"BJ's is a fun dinner spot, but I have a hard time getting over the cost for what you get. First off let me say our server Megan was AMAZING and hilarious. We got there 2 minutes before Happy Hour ended so she made sure to hurry up and get in our appetizers and beer for happy hour price. She was attentive and answered my million questions I had about the food.  The beers are always Ok here. I am not amazed by any that I've had. For an appetizer we had chicken pot stickers which were yummy because typically those are hard to find. Almost all the appetizers here will run you about $9-$11 dollars which is pretty crazy for a small appetizer. For dinner I had the turkey dip. So good! Again this is not something you typically see. Their menu is very diverse so you should have no problem finding something you like. My husband had the Buffalo chicken pizza which was good but not great. The atmosphere is fun and you should enjoy yourself here. However be expecting to have an $80 chain restaurant type meal for two."
Lori B.,"Canonsburg, PA",8,179,453,4.0,11/13/2017,"We have been to this location twice in the past 2 weeks. Love it. Plenty of parking and we have been lucky enough to not have to wait either time.  We went on Sundays both times. The service has been fantastic and the food has been stellar. If you are a beer drinker this is the place you should check out, so many different ones to choose from. They have a very lengthy menu.  There is definitely something for everyone on there.  We have tried the cheese curds twice (perfect little morsels of cheese, deep fried to perfection), the honey siracha Brussel sprouts (fan freakin tastic deep fried Brussel sprouts), turkey dip sandwich (thanksgiving stuffed in a hoagie roll complete with a chicken broth dip) sweet potato fries (nice change from regular fries) southern comfort fried chicken sandwich (juicy tender chicken breast sandwich) fish and chips (4 huge pieces of fried fish with a side of fries) hickory brisket burger (juicy, full of flavor, bbq goodness), peanut butter and triple chocolate pizookies( who doesn't want a ginormous cookie topped with ice cream and drizzle with sauce??) The food has really been stellar at this restaurant and the portion sizes are very generous.  Love it, will most definitely be back. 10% military discount. Thank you!"
Rebecca P.,"Brentwood, PA",34,3,,5.0,12/21/2017,Food and service was excellent. Don't place all your order at once or you will get your salad first and then your appetizers and entrees at the same time. The servers have no way of timing your food for you. Other than that everything was delicious.
Kristy N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",229,113,34,1.0,1/7/2018,"There is no excuse in the world for giving a party of three a 40 min wait time estimate and then the actual time being seated is 85 min. Oh and did I mention I made my reservation before arriving on their ""Preferred Waitlist"" through their app? No apologies, no trying to update us on how much longer it really was going to be (always ""Your at the top of the list!"" ""Not much longer now!"") with a surly and annoyed attitude to boot.  I understand why people continue to eat here because of the ""restaurant desert"" that the Pittsburgh South Hill is but there is no mediocre food in the world that is worth that kind of wait. While the draft selection is large and the waitstaff is consistently nice, the front of house host staff could have cared less about our waiting for over an hour and seemed annoyed to be so busy. As to the food, imagine yourself at any casual chain restaurant: Houlihan's, Red Robin, Applebee's... now you got a pretty good take on the food: it's nothing special. IF we go back it will be because we're in a bind or hosting guests with suburban tastes and a lack of food imagination. Yawn."
Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469,4.0,1/30/2017,"my bf and I decided to stop in after visiting Whole Foods. He suggested grabbing some prepared food from there for dinner. I declined and said I'd rather go to a real place to eat lol. (no hate though.)  I called to reserve but couldn't reach them. I also tried the Open Table and No Wait app with no luck. Finalllllly I went online and noticed you could reserve a spot from online IFFFF you signed up for rewards program. (all of this just to reserve a spot lol) The website gives you no est. time so we eventually went there. They had no info of us even reserving a spot. lol what a fail. The wait was an hour, so we headed over to South Hills Village to shop & browse while we waited. we decided on drinks and apps. I went with the avocado eggrolls. They were fabulous! Gosh I wish I had their recipe. My bf went with wings. You get 10 wings for about $10.50. not the best deal but whatever. You can also choose boneless (1lb for same price). We went with the buffalo sauce. The wings were excellent.  Since I signed up online for rewards program, I was given a free pizookie, which is a dessert such as cookie, brownie or monkey bread in a dish with ice cream. I went with monkey bread and it was delicious.  For drinks, we went with a mojito. It was very fresh and tasted great. Our server was Chelsea and she did an ok job. The atmosphere was cool and food was good. We will be back for sure.. maybe even the North Hills location (McCandless Crossing) Their rewards program gives you 1 point for every dollar spent (before taxes and tip of course). For signing up you get a free pizookie. At 75 pts you get $5 off food and eventually prizes are $10 and $25 off of food. If you plan on eating here more than once, might as well sign up for rewards.  I hope they find a better way to make reservations such as someone answering the phone, no wait app, open table app ect. I know BJ's has their own app, but aint nobody got time for another app on their phone lol"
Molly R.,"Fort Myers, FL",668,299,1133,3.0,6/18/2017,"My parents RAVE about BJ's. I'm not always a huge fan of chains, but I did like this place. The building is huge, and has a lot of seating.  The bar is seat yourself.  We grabbed a booth in the bar easily during the dinner rush. The menu is massive, so prepare to be a bit overwhelmed.  We started with a brussel sprouts appetizer.  Almost half of the sprouts were charred and over cooked. The sprouts that were cooked well were delicious.  We didn't say anything because they were very busy.  Our server was very attentive, and always there to help us! Next, a few of us had caesar salads.  It was a bit overdressed for me.  The dressing was very potent, and the salad was soggy. Finally, we had pizzas all around the table.  Gluten free and regular.  I can only speak to the gluten free pizza.  It did the trick, but it wasn't the best GF pizza that I've ever had. They also have GF buns. I'll certainly try this place again, but wasn't overly impressed. Again, the service was EXCELLENT!"
Mike M.,"McKees Rocks, PA",2,45,10,5.0,7/17/2017,First time to this place and what a place it was...   We started off with the fire roasted sarachi drizzled brussel sprouts. Very good don't know what the seasoning was they covered them in but I was delicious... then we ordered the x-large deep dish pizza which was very good although it was not worth the $26.00... you can get the same thing from Pizza Hut for $10.00....  But the main reason we went there was so we could try the beers... and once again I can't complain about the beer although only had the one.. Jeremiahs Red. The wife on the other hand had a mixed berry cider which was also very good... both made by BJ's...  A little bit on the pricey side but we will be back
Joshua W.,"Bridgeville, PA",1,5,46,5.0,9/24/2017,"Huge menu with several different food categories to choose from. Great beer selection including BJ's exclusive, local favorites, and common options. All the prices are surprisingly reasonable. I've been to a BJ's in San Bruno, CA a few times and this one in the South Hills certainly stacks up to one of the originals."
Logan P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",105,1,,1.0,12/19/2017,Our waitress was very unattentive! She ignored us most of the time of us being at the restaurant. We constantly had to repeat ourselves. Super annoying! She kept trying to push dessert on us even after we said no multiple times. I don't appreciate having to try and find my waitress because she can't keep our waters full. Not only was the waitress unattentive but we also had 8 other staff members bringing our items and when we requested something they would relay the message to her and we would wait FOREVER for our drinks. Food was great.... Bonefish Grill is better!
Caitie Z.,"Wexford, PA",7,65,74,3.0,5/9/2017,"Several of my friends have raved about BJ's and it has been on my list to try for an extended amount of time. Finally, I had the opportunity and I would say for the food and experience I had, it was literally ""A-OK"". Why?  My friends were waiting for me when I arrived. The waiter was quick to notice my arrival and instantly came over to ask for my drink order. He proceeded to ask if we were ready to order and of course, I needed some time to decide what my dinner was going to be. Well, it took him another 20-25 minutes to return and ask a second time. This was the case all night. The waiter was very nice but the service was slow and the place wasn't as busy (especially with a Pens game on) as my friends are used to (who are regulars).  Despite being advised to try the Chicken Tortilla Soup from a friend, I took the advice of the waiter and tried the Broccoli Cheddar Soup, pairing it with a Caesar Salad for the soup/salad combo. I can say that this soup is not something I will order again. The color alone was off-putting and it was lacking broccoli and excessive with cheese. The salad was heavily dressed but for a Caesar, I am satisfied with that. My friend offered me a slice of the pepperoni supreme and I took him up on it - thick, bubbly, and tasty! I would definitely try pizza again (especially with their Monday night deal). This place contains adequate seating with booths, tables, and a nice sized bar. TVs are located on every wall, making it easy to check the score of the game at any point. I thought that the atmosphere was quite loud, especially if it wasn't as full as it typically is. There is adequate parking in front of the restaurant and more can be found in the shopping center if need be.  I truly believe I can have a better experience when I return to BJ's. There are so many options on the menu, including beer that they brew themselves, and I am willing to try other items they offer. I believe this place has the capability to redeem itself in the future."
Matt B.,"Washington, PA",5,34,,5.0,8/24/2017,"I'm not a giant fan of chains, especially places like this where it is always busy and everyone is either frazzled or waiting for food. But the staff at the SHV BJ's Brewhouse keep things under control with ease and calmness. We've been to the location countless times before and there is rarely an issue. My favorite is the California chicken club sandwich, but the deep-dish pizza is always quite good, especially when it's half off on Mondays. But this place has a giant menu. Very little of it is health food, but you sort of know that when you walk in. They have lots of great beer on tap and even house-made sodas. Their signature dessert, the pizookie is also worth a look. I got a free one for signing up for their loyalty program and haven't looked back since. The reason I chose to leave a review today is because there was a problem with our order. A friend and I had some substitutions. Manager Audrey  came out and immediately made things right and held a conversation with us like we'd all been friends for years. The bill was properly adjusted and our replacement food was out in no time. Because of Audrey's friendly and professional attitude, we didn't even mind waiting a little longer. Props also go out to waitress Tawnya, who handled the situation calmly and professionally too.  It's a 5-star review because I've been to many restaurants where when a problem occurs, the staff handles everything in a lousy way. But the people at this BJ's want you to walk out happy. And you do."
Kevin V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,7,1,5.0,12/30/2017,"Awesome top to bottom! Usually something about an establishment pisses me off, but this far exceeded expectations. Big and detailed menu. Great service. Will come again"
Kellie U.,"McKeesport, PA",46,35,50,4.0,5/4/2017,"My husband and I stopped by BJ's for lunch one day, and I'm so glade we did!! The place was packed, but we didn't have to wait too long. The waitresses and managers were very polite. We had several managers check on us throughout our time there. They have a pretty big menu, so it was hard to decide what to order. I opted for the Gourmet Five Meat pizza. It comes with meatballs, pepperoni, oven roasted ham, smoked bacon, Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. I had them hold the meatballs on mine. When I tell you this pizza was EVERYTHING!!! It was so good! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. After I enjoyed my pizza I had a root beer float...it was okay. I cant wait to go back!!"
Cara G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,76,55,1.0,2/28/2017,"Really - this should have 1.5 stars, but I can't figure out how to make that happen.  Wow, I thought this place had a ton of potential, but it didn't deliver at all. Almost everything that could go wrong did. Orders were wrong or missing altogether, completely inattentive servers, non-existent manager, long wait for everything!  They don't take reservations. So our very large table (family event) had to wait a while (hour). No big deal. We got drinks at the bar and all was well.  The wait was the most pleasant portion of the meal. I liked the cider - crisp and just a little sweet, but very drinkable.  It is the only thing that would round this up to 1.5... When we were finally seated, someone came over and got our drinks.  We waited a while longer and finally were able to place our orders for appetizers and the rest of our food - and a request for napkins & silverware.  Following another long wait, the apps came.  Our ""queso"" dip (really just nacho cheese) wasn't very warm and neither were the chips, but it was fine and at this point, we were so hungry it didn't matter (it had been about an hour wait to sit down).  We still didn't have napkins or silverware and had to flag down multiple servers in our attempts to get these essentials. They finally bring those out after the salads (and our 4 request/reminder).  Now came another long wait (hour)... eventually, runners started bringing out our food, one by one.  Almost everyone had their food (except for one of my cousins - more about that later) and had started eating.  I flipped open my veggie burger.  And there is bacon on it.  I've been a vegetarian for about 3 years now and definitely didn't order bacon with my veggie burger.  I did however order avocado, which I never received.  I decided to eat a fry since I obviously was going to need to talk to someone about my burger - the fries are cold. My cousin next to me had ordered fries as well, but didn't get them at all - so I shared my giant portion of fries with him.  I never received any condiments (ketchup, mustard, etc) nor was I able to ask for these as the servers appeared to be actively avoiding our table.  After waiting and being ignored by multiple members of the wait staff, I decide to make a bad decision and try to remove the bacon from my burger - so off goes the cheese as it has melted together - and I hope that's enough to keep me from getting sick (I'm a vegetarian for health reasons).   Across the table from me, my cousin (who I mention before) ended up waiting 40 minutes for his food after the rest of the table received theirs.  That only appeared because we finally were able to flag down our waitress.  I was able to mention my issue with the bacon to her - her reaction was that it wasn't that big of a deal (vague ""oh, I'm sorry"" was all I originally got), but eventually decided the right thing to do would be to comp my meal.  They did offer to make me another one, but I just didn't want to wait another 45 minutes or so, since the first one took so long!   I never was able to speak with a manager nor was one offered (to be fair, I didn't explicitly ask for one either). I just wanted to be done. It's a shame - my family only gets together about once a month and we spent most of the time talking about how bad the service was at this location of BJ's."
Paul E.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,2,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Wow! Came out here to visit my sis from California and just had the worst service ever! No napkins given to us at the bar, I had to send back the spinach artichoke dip since it came burnt and chew and half way filled, and I ordered a pizookie to cash in rewards point on my BJ's app it was never brought to us. I didn't want to stay any  longer with bad service so we just left without it! Such a disappointment. I frequent Bj's in California and what a let down out here!"
John H.,"Cecil, PA",6,76,20,4.0,3/11/2017,"Well we finally made it through the doors of BJ's! It looks bigger inside than I expected. We sat at the bar since it was pretty much wide open there. They make their own beer and of course I had to try their hefeweizen. It definitely passed the test. On to the food. My wife had a personal sized pizza and said it was the best pizza she ever had. That says a lot because she never says that, so it has that going for it. I had the brewhouse burger. I was kinda miffed because I failed to notice that it didn't come with cheese. Not a big deal but it made the burger boring.  The bartenders were nice and refilled drinks when they were empty. Overall it was pretty good, nothing fancy but a decent place to eat. Just be aware that this place gets packed especially in weekends!"
Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",354,768,3120,3.0,8/9/2016,"For those of you tired of going to the North Hills BJ's has now opened a second location on the grounds of the South Hills Village mall near Jared's. When I arrived I was greeted warmly and i got to meet the manager. The place was wide open so I could seat either at their craft draft bar or at a table. I opted for a table. The waitress and her assistance went over their points program where you install their mobile app you get VIP treatment. According to the brochure the app allows you to get on their preferred waitlist, order ahead of time, receive special offers, pay directly from the app, and earn points. Since they just opened on 8-8-16 I was told that if I download their app I was entitled to a free mini pizooke which is really a type of warmed cookie covered by a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So I did this and created an account. They explained to me their history and then told me they were especially known for their pizza and craft brewery.  I decided to order a lunch special which they call lemon thyme chicken. It comes on a bed of rice and some vegetables including tomatoes and brussel sprouts. They even give you a tablespoon along with your regular utensils. When I got it I noticed it was lukewarm so I had it sent back and got a whole new entree. It was very good and quite filling. The place has free Wi Fi but for some reason I was having a little difficulty with it. Nevertheless I ordered my pizooke where you have a choice a caramel cookie, chocolate chip or peanut butter and covered with ice cream. Since it was a mini it was a generous portion size for me and more than enough. The cookie literally melted in your mouth since it was heated. The ice cream is your standard vanilla. Nothing overly exciting about it. They do have an extensive menu and a listing of all the craft beers on the wall for you to choose from.I do like the fact that they offer more of a variety than a competeter in the mall. I also noticed as I was leaving the place was filling up fairly quickly. It may be because they are new but they do offer some variation to what this mall needs in terms of restaurants. I was grateful for a new place to go next time I visit. Please note that it is not located in the mall itself but towards the right side in the parking lot. I would imagine it is similar to the one currently open in McCandless."
Kori A.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,4,,5.0,1/1/2018,"The menu is enormous and everything we've gotten has been absolutely delicious. Nice layout. Good beers. Everyone from the hostess when we walked in to the managers checking in were nice in a genuine, not simply out of obligation, way. I think we've found our new regular spot."
AJA J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",229,280,22,3.0,1/18/2017,"The salad was decent and my beer was good, but for one person and those two items my bill came in at almost $30, including tax and tip. With so many incredible options in and around the city that's really a bit too high for an experience like this, in my opinion.  That's not to say BJ's isn't without merit. The menu is huge, so if you're coming with a big party, all taste buds are likely to be accommodated. Bonus for a robust ""light"" menu as well.  Our group numbered well over 10 people at any given time during the evening, and was served in just over two hours, including multiple waves of orders. So, kudos for quick service. In short, if you're looking for an average but quality experience you are likely to find it here, no judgement!"
David A.,"Canonsburg, PA",7,3,1,3.0,9/24/2017,"So stooped for something to eat and a cold beer. I ordered a Coors Light it tasted so good I ordered another and was told my first one was the last one they had, huh?!?  I'll update after I eat::  food was great had flatbread and wings the root beer glaze was fantastic"
Shaylyn J.,"Westfield, MA",374,5,1,4.0,11/11/2017,"We went around 9 pm so there wasn't a wait at all. It's a pretty large restaurant so there's plenty of seating. Drinks and food were good, and the staff was friendly. The only con was that my burger had some pink and I asked for no pink but it was still manageable to eat and not bad enough that i felt like i had to send it back. Overall I would definitely come here again!"
Erik H.,"Washington, PA",2,45,99,3.0,7/31/2017,"Friday night we hit up BJ's Brew House. Sometimes you just need a beer. We arrived around 6PM and put our name in. We were told it would be about an hour wait. No problem. We headed to the bar and ended up standing and having a beer until a seat had opened up at the bar. We ended up just staying at the bar and eating as we were both hungry and generally just wanted to unwind. I had the Tatonka Stout which was a really nice beer. BJ's brews a pretty solid dark beer that's actually not overly bitter, but still has some flavor.  For an appetizer we shared some of the boneless wings. Theirs are actually pretty good and not over cooked. Sometimes restaurants just fry the life out of them.  By then we were on our second round of beers, and I had their other dark beer the the Nutty Brewnette which is pretty damn refreshing for a dark ale.  We ended up sharing a medium BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza. Everything on the pizza was great. Crust tasted good, veggies were fresh, wasn't greasy at all, but it was dry. Dry as a bone. It was desperately in need of some sauce. It wasn't as good as the pizza we'd had there when they first opened, but it was okay. We ended up having another drink and headed home after that. Would I return to BJ's for a drink and food? Sure. We had a good time. I'd just make sure I asked for a little extra sauce on the pizza next time. By the time we were leaving, about an hour and a half after we'd got there I'd received a text stating our table was ready. So if you plan to check it out, plan to wait."
Arvind T.,"Houston, TX",3,6,,1.0,7/19/2017,Bjs in Houston was one of our favorite places to eat so we decided to go here for a family celebration. We were two of us with our am year old baby.  After we were seated our server introduced herself n took our order. It took her 40 mins to bring our appetizers. We decided to ignore that part as the food was delicious. We didn't get our main course for almost hour. Can u even imagine our frustration. My baby got all cranky and fussy as his food was also not served. He was hungry. We planned our visit as such so we all could eat together and it wasn't the most busy in there.  Super disappointed.  Bad service.
Bao T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",176,45,159,4.0,12/29/2016,"A friend and I decided to try this place on a Wednesday night for her late birthday celebration. We came in around 5 o'clock and the wait was 50 minutes for a table of two... Crazy! Good thing the mall is right by this restaurant so we decided to kill time in there. When we came back they still had us wait an extra 20 minutes! I understand it's the holiday but I wish they have a better system of making a reservation ahead. (FYI they only take reservations of a party of 6 or more)  Besides the long wait, the food was great! I had the roasted salmon with quinoa and it was delicious. My friend tried the mahi-mahi tacos and she liked that a lot too.  I'll have to come back on a better day when they're not super busy. Because the food was not bad at all and there's a few other things I would want to try in the menu!"
Marie C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",4,32,8,5.0,6/25/2017,I love the Peruvian quinoa bowl. It is beyond delicious. I get it with shrimp. There are a lot of shrimp on this dish. There are other proteins to choose from but shrimp is my favorite.  My hubby always gets the pasta. It comes in the tins and baked. I wish I would have taken a picture before we destroyed the food.  The menu is quite eclectic and sure to please everyone.
Funtime P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",42,307,1031,3.0,10/27/2016,This is by the South Hills village mall. It's a nice large location with open seating and a bar and modern industrial design. I had a coupon and ate here twice my service was good. It was packed but my food wait wasn't unusually long. The food is decent to good depending on what you order. I had shrimp parmesan which was just OK and BJ'S favorite deep dish pizza with meatballs and vegetables which was good! I had the monkey bread with ice cream which was good but too crispy. I want the outside of the bread to be crispy and the inside to be soft. I also tried the white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie with ice cream. It was good but the cookie stuck to the pan.  I would eat here again. The menu is huge and they have lots of beer!
Kevin W.,"Bridgeville, PA",0,10,,3.0,10/29/2017,"I would give them a 3.5 if I could. The service was good. I had the ahi tuna salad and it was good, not great. My wife had the soup and salad. Soup was tomato bisque, good. Salad was wedge, ok. I sampled a few of their own beers and found it difficult to find one I really liked. What was outstanding were the wings with the root beer glaze! I would return again just for them and order a bottled beer that I already like. There seemed to be a lot of tasty looking selections on the menu, would try dining there again."
Kat V.,"Coraopolis, PA",99,178,28,4.0,9/29/2016,"My favorite Asian salad was always at BJ's when I lived in Southern California and I hadn't found one I love in the Pittsburgh area, so I was excited when I found out BJ's was coming to Pittsburgh. I know that's not what you think someone would recommend from a pizza place, but the chicken in it is so well prepared and the dressing and mandarin orange slices make it pretty perfect. The salad and pizookie were still wonderful, as was the rest of the food our party ordered. I'm sure their pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers are all still really good here. If it were closer, I'm sure I'd go more frequently.  The cider they make was very good, as were the beers ordered in our party.  There's no sign that faces the street, but BJ's is the red building up and to the left of Bonefish as you're looking at the buildings from 19.  It's a small restaurant, so signing up for their app (which gives you a free mini pizookie your first trip and other rewards) allows you to get in line before you get there, which is probably a good idea if you go at a normal meal time."
Meghan O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,9,2,5.0,9/16/2017,"We have been to BJ's three times now as it has quickly become one of our favorites. The food is excellent; from the burgers & fries, to the Parmesan crusted chicken, the wings are some of my favorite, too!! Their beers are delightful! We have always had the absolute best service from friendly hosts(esses) to waiters!! We will definitely keep coming back here."
Judi B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",16,6,4,4.0,10/4/2017,"I have been to the  McCandless restaurant in the past with my first visit to the Upper Saint Clair location yesterday. They have a large varied menu and if your a craft beer drinker, they have a nice selection. We went at an off time and it was not busy.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful and when  she left to go on break, was followed by someone with the same level of attention and friendliness. We both agreed it was good chain restaurant food! Everything was cooked perfectly with good size portions  I struggled with a rating of 3-4 but will say as chains go, we both will return!"
Robert U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",130,696,131,4.0,9/10/2016,"It's good.  If you've been to any other BJs, you will recognize the inside of this one, which is just fine.  First, their beers are very good. Next, the menu is a vast book, kind of like of Cheesecake Factory did a THI Fridays. There are lots of starters. I suggest the avocado egg rolls. Excellent (but heavy)! Their entree salads are good. Their pizzas are very good. The floor is well staffed and the service is good."
Natalie L.,"Upper Saint Clair, PA",98,14,15,2.0,2/27/2017,"BJ's is your typical mall, chain restaurant but with their own beer. There is typically a wait since most shoppers are stopping in on their way through the mall. There is an extensive menu so the good news is that you'll find something for even the pickiest of eaters. Best part - kids get a cup of fruit and garlic roll for free. We have gone 2-3 times and, each time, I feel my sodium intake has gone through the roof. The food is incredibly salty! If you're used to food cooked with a lot of salt, you probably won't mind. But if you're someone who steers away from a high-sodium diet, you'll probably feel it.  I probably won't actively go to BJs again, and if I do I'll stick to a salad."
