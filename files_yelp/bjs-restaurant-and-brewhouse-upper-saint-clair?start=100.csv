Amanda T.,"Downingtown, PA",0,5,1,5.0,8/13/2016,They opened on Monday and so far everything was great! The service was good and so was the food! I had the kale and brussel sprouts salad with chicken and my boy friend had the California chicken. Definitely will be back back!
Kristie R.,"Houston, PA",0,13,12,5.0,9/7/2016,"This area was in a desperate need for a place like this.  It's a chain without the cliche chain feel.  The food was really good.  Fried artichokes are a must! And their thin fries were perfect.  Our server, Chelsea rocked and went the extra mile for us.  The gm came to our table and was so welcoming. To top it off, they had guys with giant umbrellas outside walking people to their cars. Quality place, quality staff, will def be back!"
Lydia K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,22,19,1.0,12/10/2016,"Back again because I like the food choices.  I must say service is still terrible.  It wasn't busy it was 11:00 pm. Bartenders last night 12/9 can't get any worse.  I'm speechless...well maybe not let me elaborate.  Before we sat down I told them there was a mess (food, etc) under bar stools but they did nothing about it. The guy started off ok but disappeared for a half hour after taking my drink order & half my food order and not my friends...the other bartender didn't bother to check on us she stayed at the other end of the bar.  Had to call her down to finish getting waited on.  When he finally returned he stayed at the other end of the bar talking to people and never checked on us for more drinks till last call so you know what...no more drinks and no tip!  Tips are earned and should not be expected!  Polite is good but inattentive when not busy is unacceptable."
Meghan K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,8,,3.0,9/2/2016,"First let me say that the selection and the food is great! But the service needs work. With this location being new they may just have a few kinks to work out, but both times we have gone we waited at least 15 minutes before being acknowledged by waitstaff and taking our drink order. I watched a few tables near us actually get up and leave. Also both times are appetizers came out after our meals. I am not going to write BJs off just yet because as I said earlier the food is good and the food and drink menu is huge! Hopefully the service will get better with time."
Ronnie T.,"Canonsburg, PA",100,2,,1.0,9/1/2016,"Went here about 2 weeks ago, manger came over and talk to us like we were children. (I was with myself and two others) Very unprofessional for a new opening restaurant in the area. I can't say anything bad about the food. Just the fact that that happened would really make me think twice about returning."
Manish J.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,7,2,1.0,10/25/2016,"I am not going back here for sure. Went with family on Friday night, there was 45 minutes wait. The food was okay, beers were terrible. A server spilled food all over my wife's purse and her work clothes. Nobody even asked us if we would like them to take care of dry cleaning the clothes. It was raining, so my wife brought her umbrella along and forgot it at the table. We called next day afternoon, and the manager said they don't have it and can't do anything about it. Looks like they don't care about stuff their customers left behind by mistake. Or they hire people that like to steal things their customers left behind by mistake."
Liz S.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,27,,4.0,11/18/2016,Sat at the bar. All the bartenders were very attentive. Their own beer is fantastic! The bartender got my food order incorrect but he quickly fixed it. Overall great experience will definitely come back
John H.,"Monroeville, PA",1,4,,1.0,11/4/2016,"Absolutely horrible, service is terrible and food a 2 out of 10.  This is my third visit, keep hoping for a positive enjoyable experience, never again.  The waitress gave us silverware 3 times, no clue what she was doing!  The jambalaya salad was nothing more than chili pepper dumped on the shrimp, horrible.  My son had a medium steak, yes I know this is not a steak house, however it was leather, my dog wouldn't eat it.  We got the check before desert, call me crazy but bad food and a server with no clue for $110.00.....your right I am crazy for trying 3 times, never again."
Caroline S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,15,,2.0,9/10/2016,"Beer is great...food, so so. We ordered cheese sticks and calamari and they brought us one set and another set about 10 minutes later!?!?!  Spaghetti and meatballs is a little spicy but good. The pizza, which they are known for, is mediocre. Both the flat bread and the deep dish seem undercooked.  Service needs lots of work. And be careful in the bar area, something is up with a very slippery floor."
Jordan J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,11,,2.0,9/1/2016,"I have never eaten at a BJs, and was especially excited for their Deep Dish, since Pittsburgh is known for their local Pizza, but has very few Deep Dish options. Online takeout was fast and easy. That was about the end of the positives. After reading reviews, I ordered a medium Deep Dish with Extra sauce because I read it can be dry. They either forgot the extra sauce or the original has none. It was no more than a dab of tomato sauce on each slice. It also had very little cheese. What was left tasted like a dry, flavorless Pizza Hut Pan. I've been to Chicago/NYC several times, and this is no way a traditional Deep Dish by any means. It shouldn't even be labeled as such. Burgh's Pizza makes a Deep Dish that is far superior and is a short drive away. Disappointed. Won't be ordering again."
Marilou R.,"Tybee Island, GA",0,3,,1.0,9/20/2016,"One star is generous for this place. It was new and clean. That's where it ends. Our waitress was not familiar with the menu and left mid meal. I had to ask 2 other waiters to find my soup order. Even though menu is extensive we had the basics. Caesar salad was made with ice burg (who does that?) the clam chowder was pastie and overly salted. The signature ""new sandwich"" was simply a variety of meat on soggy bread. No flavor and dry. Very underwhelmed. Lastly, after our original waitress left, we were pretty much on our own & even had to request to pay our check. I probably won't be back because in addition to the service and poor quality food it was overpriced."
Amanda B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,5,,4.0,9/7/2016,"Food and beer was reasonably priced and very good. We had called ahead to put our names in for a table and they had no record of us calling. They still sat us in 15 minutes when the wait was probably at least an hour. Other than that issue which I'm sure will get worked out once the restaurant has been open longer, this place is great."
Randy R.,"Gibsonia, PA",0,9,,1.0,8/21/2016,Never go here. Service is terrible. Took 3 hrs. Wrong meal. Finally just wanted to leave. Bill was wrong and took 30+ min. Have tried two different restaurants. Same.
Letty L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",26,51,1,4.0,11/10/2016,"I first experienced BJ's at their Chandler, AZ location when we were living in neighboring Ahwatukee.  I liked it then and I like it now.  I love their ""house"" beers and I don't have to argue with my family because there is truly something for everyone.  Want a fish taco?  Fine.  Want a steak?  Fine.  Want a pizza, Fine..... I personally eat the avocado egg rolls as my dinner because you get two huge ones that seem to be stuffed with an entire Avocado each and they have a nice spice to them.  I miss fresh Avocados from my years in Phoenix area.  The ones you buy at Market District or Trader Joes suck.  Apparently all the good ones go to BJ's because their Avocados are Southwest-worthy.  Right now the restaurant is packed from ""eating with the elderly"" time through closing because it is a new and different restaurant in the South Hills so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  If you are a 4 or under party, the bar area is walk-in with tables.  Gotta love PA, the kids can sit in the bar area!  Good for us!  As far as the quality of the food - if you like Houlihans, you will like BJ's.  Similar broad-spectrum menus and quality of food."
