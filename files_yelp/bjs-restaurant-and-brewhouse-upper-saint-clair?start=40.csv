Chad K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,55,,3.0,9/5/2016,Like everyone else there was good and parts about this place.  First the good.  Ordered the BBQ brisket burger and it was delicious!!! The server was very attentive.  My friend ordered the Ahi tuna Salad and said it was really good as well.   The bad was the beer. Now I will admit I'm more critical than most with beer since I'm more of a beer nerd.  I was excited to try their home brews but those every was terrible especially the Porter.  None of them had any taste.  The Porter literally tasted like colored water.  One of the only times I can remember not being able to finish a beer. It was quite disappointing since this was a brew house.  I will go back and try it again as maybe the problem will be fixed as they just opened up.
Tammy M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,8,4,5.0,9/17/2017,"Loved everything we ordered...salmon, pizza and dessert! Our server, Shawn was incredible!  Ask for him when you go there!  Can't wait to go back!"
DJ J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1512,869,407,3.0,12/20/2016,"Stopped in to give it a try.  Sat in the bar area.   Was looking for Sean K. since he seems to like BJ's! Service was good but our meal took longer than you would expect. Did not time it, but was more like a fancy restaurant. Had the Shrimp tacos that have chipotle mayo and some sort of dressing with Napa cabbage, red onions and supposedly cilantro. It come with an avocado cream sauce, fire roasted tomato sals and tortilla chips.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, warm and tender but there was little taste to the sauce or the taco.  Was looking for some of the cilantro flavor and it was none existent.  The tortilla chips were pretty good but was not a fan of the fire-roasted tomato salsa since it just tasted like smoke.  The avocado cream was OK but I wish it had a little richer avocado flavor.   My associate had the Jambalaya and said it was very good and something he had on a previous visit."
Val V.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,2,4,1.0,9/11/2017,"I've been to this BJ's a LOT of times. While their service has always been very nice and there's a wide variety of choice on the menus, I would NOT suggest coming here. Let me explain: in the past year every time I have eaten at this particular BJ's I have gotten food poisoning afterwards. It's happened on more than one occasional. In fact, I can probably name 8 friends from the top of my head who have had the same problem with this restaurant. I'm not sure if it's the meat or maybe the water, but I've made the decision to stop dining there. If you're willing to risk food poisoning, eat there (but I would be cautious with what you order)."
Shawn M.,"Mount Lebanon, PA",0,7,,4.0,11/13/2017,"Very good pizza in a cool setting. The challenge is that this place can be extremely crowded even during off hours. And, it can be a little pricey for what you get. But there's no denying that their pizza is excellent."
Andrew Z.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/27/2016,"Wow! I moved out of Bethel Park a few years ago and came back into town to visit for the holidays. At my dad's recommendation, we checked this place out. Boy we're we disappointed! Let me count the ways: - Shortly after we received our drinks, as we were looking through the menu, my stepmother spilled a little bit of her drink. When she asked the waitress for a napkin, motioning towards the few drops that had spilled on her menu, the waitress declined to bring them, saying that it was no big deal. So my stepmother sat there with a wet lap.  - When our appetizer (chips with sriracha cheese) came, the cheese was so cold that there was a layer congealed on the top. Since we'd still not been brought napkins or silverware or plates, we ate it hunched over the middle of the table.  - My dad is lactose intolerant, and he even had a brief conversation with the waitress in which she explained that she didn't eat cheese either. As such, he ordered his burger with no cheese. But even despite this conversation his burger arrived covered in cheddar. The runner (notably NOT our waitress, who at this point we had not seen in some time) apologized and said that they would have a new one out in a few minutes. When we finally caught the waitress, she told us that she had pressed the wrong button on the screen. - I ordered the vegetarian pita, and the pita was so dry that it broke into tiny pieces as soon as I picked it up. So that became a fork meal. - My stepmother's mushroom salad came with no dressing whatsoever. Her burger was cold and the fries were burnt to the consistency of potato chips--and no warmer! - My stepmother and I were completely finished eating by the time my dad got his burger, and yet all of the plates remained on our table until shortly before the waitress brought the check. It was at this point that she asked how everything was, and I explained a few of our issues. - When she finally brought the check, the waitress engaged us in a long conversation (by far the most time she had spent at our table all night) about how she had to make her car payments, etc.--clearly to ""suck up"" and try to recoup some of her tip. She also told us that she had removed the pita and chips from the bill...but in reviewing it I discovered that she had even mixed that up, and in fact she'd removed the chips and the salad. Better than nothing, I guess! I absolutely understand that kitchens get busy and people make mistakes, but the fact that literally every dish we received was problematic strikes me as a little overboard. Despite this fact, because my dad and stepmother are great people, we tipped 20%. But I can say with certainty that none of us will visit this place again. Although I doubt that matters much, because BJ's is very clearly a quantity-over-quality type of establishment!"
Erin K.,"Imperial, PA",46,6,10,4.0,4/9/2017,"This was my second visit to BJ's. The menu has a little something for everyone including wings, salads, pasta, burgers, and some ""lighter"" selections. Everything we ordered was good, although nothing to write home about. Overall it's a great place to grab some food and a beer for a quick date or a night out with friends."
Adam W.,"Venetia, PA",0,3,,1.0,12/21/2017,"While grabbing lunch here with a client, I had a waitress accidentally drop a tray of waters next to me with a glass falling on my shoulder and table.  The waitress was extremely apologetic and tried to do everything she could to make the situation better.  The reason for the poor rating has nothing to do with the service or the wait staff.  The reason is due to the manager that was on the floor.  She came over and after my client joked with the waitress about getting a free round of drinks for me having to sit there with a cold shirt for the entire meal.  The manager said she would take care of things and in the end gave us a $9.95 cookie for free.  Not only do I feel this is insulting but it shows how out of touch and cheap the management is.  I do not wish to get a call from the manager on duty or the GM, but when you have a customer ring up a $165 bill, $10 off the top is not much and shows that you are more concerned with your bottom line for every transaction than actually being sorry for a mistake that is your restaurants fault."
Pat H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,2,1,5.0,12/16/2016,"Love Happy Hour at the bar with great beer/cocktails, heavy apps and super service.  Look forward to special events coming up after the holidays!"
Meghan B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",183,474,736,4.0,6/27/2017,"Came to this location twice so far and have visited the franchise three times. I must say, for a chain, the food is good and they have a lot of fresh options, in addition to the fried foods and pizzas. Their pizza is delicious- I enjoy the small Hawaiian personal size pizza, it reminds me of a fancier version of school pizzas. Their ranch is also really good, which is important to my boyfriend and I since we love ranch dressing. Their boneless wings are delicious, however we didn't love their signature root beer glaze- it was way too sweet for us. Brendan had a burger here the past two times he visited and he liked it both times. I opted for a salad the most recent time- it had quinoa and blueberries and kale, among other delicious healthy ingredients. It was so good! I was really impressed with the freshness of it. Their appetizers are yummy- I love the fried portabella mushrooms, as well as the roasted Brussels with sriracha. Service has always been great and the beer selection is really impressive. I would love to come here for a game sometime or happy hour."
Hebah E.,"Moon, PA",2,31,6,3.0,5/13/2017,Their call ahead feature sucks but the prime rib was excellent and the pizza is deep dish and delish! They actually put stewed tomatoes on it which makes it nice and juicy. The chicken tortilla soup was thick and not the best. Apps aren't that good. But entrees are actually!
J L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",25,31,5,2.0,8/6/2017,"I felt like I was being punk'd. My friend wanted to take me to her favorite restaurant. Now I think it will be a long time before either of us returns. Granted it was busy Sat. night. They  brought her drink 5 mins before mine. The runners brought her salad but totally the wrong the for me and I had to wait for them to bring out my salad and fries. Fries were borderline warm and hard and I had to wait for the mayo I asked for, By the time I got that they were a loss.  The waitress had a good excuse for not bringing the mayo tho as she was so busy fixing our salad orders.  I ordered a santa-fe salad with dressing on the side as I have food allergies. The salad came an unlisted seasoning powder all over the salad. I had to send it back. It was also missing the avocado and had very little cheese.  I was already a little peeved as I could not eat any of meat add ons and they insisted on charging full price. I had them bring the meat separate so that my friend could add it to her salad and it's a good thing they did. Her salad was missing the chicken that was to be on it. She ordered the asian chopped salad that was not chopped. Along with missing chicken, it also was missing almonds, mandarin oranges and dressing! Close to 2 hrs and a talk with the manager resulted in new salads, (mine still had very little cheese or avocado) and new fries which were not much better hot as they were greasy and had a funny coating on them.  As a side note: I disliked the ambiance. It was loud loud loud and so crowded that the twice I had people knock into be trying to pass."
Jaime H.,"Bethesda, MD",93,21,5,4.0,6/20/2017,"My mom friends and I love this place! It's late hours are super convenient. Though the staff seems to all be unaware of the late night specials that scroll through the electronic signage and have argued with us several times! We are like...it literally say it, RIGHT THERE. The drink and food selection is huge. I recommend the avocado egg rolls, if you have a days worth of calories to spare, lol!"
Kevin P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",67,32,15,4.0,11/3/2016,"This place is your typical microbrewery restaurant small chain type place. They feature their beer as well as others. Some of the Pros: - Excellent beer selection. - A Variety of items to choose from on the menu. - Reasonably priced. - Large seating area. - Friendly staff (that I dealt with) Some Cons: - With this being a new location and new staff, they seemed to be still learning the menu and drinks. (Should know both fully before completely opening). - Music selection while eating was poor.  Other than that it was a great experience. I got the brisket burger and it was really good with alot of flavor and their endless fries (I do not eat fries often) are really good, but they are salty. We also got the Sriracha queso with chips and let me tell you, that for $5.XX it was well worth it for 2 people and they have endless chips also. The queso was very good and just a hint of spice. We will be a return customer."
Alexis Z.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,52,8,1.0,10/27/2016,"First Visit:  Good and bad!  First the good: Food was delicious, servers were very nice and bubbly. We ordered the ribs (had a good bit of meat on them, and good sauce), the pasta with blackened chicken (very flavorful), baked potatoes (cooked well and came with sour cream, butter, scallions). Many options for everyone on the menu and even some options I haven't seen at other restaurants before!  Second the bad: The servers did not check on us much, the food took about 45 minutes to come out once we finally got to order, which shouldn't have taken that long because we came after the dinner rush to avoid that specifically. The app you can download gives you good rewards but only if you pay using the app, which we would never put our card info in to an app. The rewards should be for any regular paying customer.. Not happy about that.  Would recommend! Food was worth it& menu selection was great.  Second Visit:  Wait was not long. The beers were good but service was bad. This is the second time the service has been crappy. The waitress never checked in, she would disappear when asked for something. Had to wait about 20 minutes every time we wanted ranch, beer, anything really. My brisket burger came without the burger the first time, looked great though and the waitress let me keep the brisket sand which. When she brought out my actual sandwich, I was confused as to what was on the burger. The brisket looked nothing like what was on the previous sandwich and was actually gross looking, they were not the same brisket. I ended up scraping it off my sandwich and using the other brisket. We will be back because of beer and to try other food selections, but don't expect good service here apparently!  Third Visit:  Three strikes and you're out, won't be returning. My experiences seem to get worse each time, we have given this place three tries now. Wait was long, which is fine. Finally got seated and waited forever for anyone to come to our table. Our waitress was a blonde and very unprofessional and not experienced at all. She took forever to bring even our waters out. The service is always horrible and they are not nice either.. usually the food is alright, but I was very disappointed with my fatty burger. She charged our bill all wrong and split it wrong as well. She brought the wrong beer out after saying one was available and then told us we were wrong about her saying that and that she never said it was available. She got extremely defensive and was rude about it.  Don't recommend.. I'm all for giving places lots of patience and multiple tries, but this place has failed me every time I come. Won't be back."
Julie E.,"Carnegie, Pittsburgh, PA",140,5,,5.0,5/23/2017,Great spot in the south hills to grab drinks and dinner without having to travel to the city. The prices are great and the portions are good. Always a full house so it makes for a good and energetic atmosphere. Also a great place to watch a game. I love that there are health alternatives and vegetarian options. Good location with ample parking and plenty of food and beer choices.
Tori F.,"Castle Shannon, PA",60,4,2,5.0,6/11/2017,Went to BJ's for my daughter's birthday and had a great time!  Food was great and the service was wonderful. Manager Jon brought over dessert for my daughter. Definitely going back!
Brad H.,"Jefferson Hills, PA",18,102,68,5.0,11/15/2016,Fun atmosphere inside which made for a good first experience.  Great beer selection and the pizza is great.  Had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was perfect.  my wife had the bbq chicken pizza which was also delicious.  Will definitely return to try some of the other menu options.
Jessica C.,"Bridgeville, PA",24,36,,5.0,6/7/2017,"We are regulars here.  Everything we've tried is absolutely delicious!  The absolute best menu item is their deep dish pizza.  It's surprisingly light, and comes in a ton of different varieties.  The spinach and artichoke dip is good, and a decent sized portion.  And you can't forget about the pizookie dessert! (Warm cookie with ice cream, comes in a bunch of different combinations)"
Rosemary W.,"Monessen, PA",10,3,,5.0,7/21/2017,"On July 20th,we took our daughter and granddaughter to BJ's for our grandaughter's 16th birthday. We've never been here before,so we were excited to try it. Well...Audrey happened to be our server. I must say...Audrey was the best server we've had in a very long time. By the time we left,we felt as tho we not only had a fabulous meal..but we made a friend! She is a huge asset to your company! When we return,it will definitely be because of Audrey. Thanks Audrey!!"
