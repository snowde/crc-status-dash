Nancy W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",14,17,12,4.0,11/12/2016,"As promised, I came back because of the managers amazing response to our less than great visit.   I was here yesterday at 2:30, and the service seems to have improved! It was packed because they were giving veterans dinners for free.  We still got a table for 4 right away.   I got the lunch special with the half California club, friess and a salad for $7.98. Someone else got the deep dish pizza, and another got spaghetti and meatballs.   We did have a long wait for food, about 45 minutes.  My food wasn't warm at all, hence the 4 stars, but it was still very good.   I tried the spaghetti and it was delicious.   My friend with the deep dish said the crust was to die for.  We also tried their hand crafted black cherry soda, which was very good and had free refills.   Try the seasonal snickerdoodle pizookie, it was amazing!  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  I'll go back again."
Rugger W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,45,,2.0,8/21/2016,"We have been here twice since the restaurant opened.  There were high points and low points to each visit.  On the positive side, the pizzas (both thin and thick) are quite good in our opinion.  On both occasions, we had brussel sprouts that were nice too.  Unfortunately, there were some drawbacks.  On the first visit, multiple beers were unavailable due to temperature issues.  It's great that they want to maintain standards, but it was nonetheless disappointing since it is a brewhouse and a driving factor to try their establishment.  What a let down.   While on the first visit, our exceptional server (Marissa) mentioned their app which included a waitlist feature.  I downloaded and utilized it for the second trip.  When our info. was entered at 6:28, the app indicated an approximate 40 minute wait.  My wife and I proceeded to check in as instructed with the hostess at approx. 6:55 and were told that we would be seated in approximately 20 minutes.  This, of course, seemed reasonable - especially hearing the party in front of us (also a group of two) were quoted an 80 minute wait time.  Long story short, the waitlist app feature was worthless.  We were not seated until after 8:00.  In fact, the couple in front of us with a quoted wait time of 80 minutes had a table before us! While the food was good, the front of the house management - specifically related to the waitlist - was below expectations.  I don't know if we will or will not frequent the establishment in the future."
Dwight F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",6,3,,2.0,11/18/2016,"The honeymoon is over at this newly opened BJ'S.  Our last 2 visits were disappointing. I don't drink so, in fairness, maybe it's better to get liquored up before eating the food.   The jambalaya seemed as if it had been cooked hours before we ordered it. Everything in it was soft and mid-evolution into an eventual gray gelatinous mass. I wasn't duped by the shovel full  of dry seasoning heaped on the top of it all at the last minute.  Tonight I ordered the kale and mushy, grey roasted brussel sprout salad with a previously frozen, now burnt salmon jerkey plank. I ordered the grilled rather than the blackened salmon, but it was charred and was like eating  salmon  taxidermy. My wife's burger too was well done a few minutes before they removed it from the grill.  I did savor my drink of water though --- I had to as refills were scarce. Sorry BJ's"
Jason H.,"Bethel Park, PA",1,30,,1.0,8/13/2016,"I have heard good things but unfortunately, after waiting for an hour we left hungry.  I did call ahead seating and arrived 10 minutes later to let the hostess know we arrived.  She said it would be 15 minutes.  After a half hour, I was told 15 more minutes, 20 minutes later I was told another 15 minutes.  At this point we had a one year old and a four year old that needed dinner and left for Primanti's.   The frustrating part is that it was not overly crowded and everyone else was getting seated.  I am convinced the hostess did not mark us down as having arrived until the second time I talked to her.  It was nice that they brought around samples (which were amazing), but there are definitely some bugs to be worked out of the process."
Susan H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,3,8,5.0,11/8/2016,"The service was impeccable!  The salad I ordered was overdressed even after I asked for it to be lightly dressed. The waitress immediately offered to have it remade. It wasn't very long, but my husband had already finished his entrée by the time it returned. The manager, without requesting him, arrived at our table and apologized for the salad (which was fine the second time around) and the fact that we didn't share our meals together. He offered us dessert on the house! That's how customer service should be! And the food was delicious!!!"
Stephanie C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",137,2,,5.0,6/16/2017,"Our food was awesome and the service couldn't have been any better. Mike, our waiter, was very friendly and helpful. He made it an extra great experience.  While we were dining the manager Ray checked on us to make sure our food and service was good. He was super friendly. I wish all restaurants had employees like them.  We will absolutely be back, & soon!"
Michael D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",95,4,1,5.0,12/11/2016,"Not a fan of chain restaurants and went here with low expectations.  The beer flight and meals were a bit of kick ass.  Much better than anticipated.  Our server, Tawnya, was also very friendly.  Will definitely go again."
Tom M.,"Canonsburg, PA",1,19,,2.0,9/1/2016,"Went here earlier this week and it was okay. Not great...okay. Prices are reasonable. Service (particularly the bar) was a bit slow and maybe you can chalk that up to being new. I had the Jambalaya which would have been good except it was terribly over spices. I like spicy....this was terribly overspiced. My companion had the shrimp and penne which he said was okay. Again, not great or good....ok.  On the positive the wine prices were pretty good especially by the bottle....and some good IPA's.  Very open place which makes it very loud. I am in no need to rush back here."
Kayshauna P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",77,12,5,5.0,3/22/2017,This place was awesome! I really loved the fact that you can order mozzarella tomato caprese instead of a regular salad. I had the Peanut chicken  Asian noodles and my husband had the ribs. Everything was amazing! The waitress was patient and gave great advise on which beers to try. My husband really liked the in-house brewed Hippy Dippy Beer. Really great food and service.
John M.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,2,,5.0,9/19/2017,"We have become frequent customers of BJs near South Hills Village.  Our experiences have been exceptional from the moment we enter the restaurant.  The food has always been served in a timely manner and appropriately prepared.  We especially want to compliment Audrey of the management team, who has always been professional as well as kind and is concerned with our restaurant experience.  My girlfriend and I were impressed when Audrey remembered our names after our first visit.  Our bartender, Luke, was extremely knowledgeable regarding wines, and mixed drinks as well as being personable and attentive to our needs.  We will continue to patronize BJs as it has become our favorite restaurant."
Nicole B.,"Hollywood, CA",3,31,141,3.0,9/9/2016,"Great layout, tasty looking menu, creative drinks, friendly staff, but but needs just a little fine tuning on operation. Bj's has been open at this location for aprox a month and I think it will be extremely popular once they're rolling. Experience: We received prompt seating at 4pm in a nice, large booth facing all of the sports games (which was perfect). Our server was friendly and sweet. We ordered the artichoke appetizer and soup salad combos. We requested our food to be ""coursed"": app first, then salad, then soup after salad so that the soup wouldn't get cold while we were eating everything else (this has happened to me before and so I was specific about it). *This didn't happen.  The app came out extremely hot and so we had to wait for it to cool. We didn't mind that, but then our soup and salads arrived together....and we weren't finished with the app and the soup was warm, not hot, which meant it went cold by the time we were finished with our salads...which is why I asked for it to be timed out. Nobody wants to eat cold clam chowder. The timing of the food was disappointing. *Side note: They need to check the silverware before wrapping it. Food: The artichoke app was slightly briny but ok. House salad was delicious with fresh greens and veggies and I really like the balsamic dressing (ask for it on the side). The Caesar salad was way over dressed. I'm not exaggerating, we didn't finish it. The clam chowder had nice flavor and we would order it again. However, I would want it to be a good temp instead of warm to cold. *Tip: No bread, crackers, or anything served with it, so you may want to order it in a bread bowl if you're looking for that. The Smores Pizookie came out perfect. I like that they offer a Pizookie Trio so that you can try more than one kind if you choose.  They have daily deals and the servers should offer those when giving you the menu's. It makes you wonder if the staff gets to do menu tasting so that they can let you know what's their favorites are or what's popu We'll be back because we see the potential and know they just opened and it takes time to perfect things. I am detailed in this review in hopes that they will make adjustments because I really like the place. Not to be harsh. I would give it 3 1/2 stars and my relative said 3 stars.  Another user wrote that if you check in on Yelp that you get a free Pizookie or App...I checked in, but didn't get that notification/ offer...disappointing :(."
Dot F.,"Clairton, PA",1,3,,5.0,5/22/2017,Had a relaxing night out here with friends. Great atmosphere and even better food. Ordered pizza and several appetizers from the menu. Hats off to John the restaurant manager from LA. Welcome to Pittsburgh and thank you for your OUTSTANDING SERVICE!! Go Steelers!
Emily D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",34,108,19,5.0,8/26/2016,"I wasn't even aware of this restaurant opening until my friend told me about it, but I'm so glad she did. First off, the atmosphere is very nice and it has a nice casual feel to it. They have a huge menu of food options! I got the Mediterranean chicken pita and it was delicious. The potato skins are so good! Usually, I just take the cheese, bacon, scallions, etc off the top and skip the potato. At BJ's they double crisp the potatoes....AMAZING! The pizookie is incredible! If you're on a diet, it's totally worth breaking it for day! The staff is very friendly and it's a very clean establishment! I definitely will be returning! I love how close it is as well! It's right in the parking lot of South Hills Village mall."
Stevie Z.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",24,15,5,5.0,9/2/2016,"I recently went to Bjs Restaurants to try it out and I absolutely loved it. I sat at the bar to watch the game and the bartender Emily greeted me promptly and sincerely. I tried one of their beers that she recommended, I think it was called the Pirhana and it was delicious. The food was great and came out quickly. Emily made sure I was happy the entire time and I was. It was a great first experience at this restaurant and I definitely plan on coming back."
John F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,53,2,3.0,3/12/2017,"It's a nice interior and a decent brew selection, home brewed beers, cider, and sodas (Rootbeer!!) pretty good service and the food is A-ok. This receives a 3 star because it's a generic chain. It's not that I don't recommend it but if you're looking for a burger, beer, mahi mahi tacos, giant salads, or some decent entree - this place is on caliber with Cadillac Ranch. If you dig that kind of place - you'll love it here!"
Claire E.,"Pittsburgh, PA",91,1,,5.0,8/31/2017,"I've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Yes, it's still a chain, and I typically don't go to chain restaurants. Why would you with all the other choices in Pittsburgh? I was so pleasantly surprised when I went for the first time though. Their pizza is awesome, tacos are great and my fiancé even had a pasta dish that was really good! Their beer is good and I like the other crafts they have on tap too. Someone is making good selections to have on draft. I was shocked to see such a low rating for this place! If you hate waiting for a table, make a reservation like you would have to do anywhere else in pittsburgh! Or get the app and get in line when you leave your house. Definitely try it if you haven't been! Only thing I would change is a little better service. It's not bad, but it isn't stellar either."
Shawn R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,49,1,3.0,3/6/2017,"I went in October and ordered Octoberfest only to be told they are sold out. I know this is going to sound small minded of me but aren't you a ""brewhouse?"" I got a regular brand beer and it was good. Food was great, salad fresh and waiter was very nice. I recently went back and had the same results, but no sold out beer which was nice.  *BEWARE of the flooring. Both times I went with different groups and the floor has this slippery texture."
Mish R.,"Bethel Park, PA",48,9,2,1.0,10/14/2016,"Definitely not going to visit any time soon again.  I called ahead to get in the wait list since the lady time we tried to get in the door it was a 2 hr wait.  Tonight,  I called was quoted 50 minutes.   We arrive 45 minutes into the 50 minutes wait and was told it was going to be another 50 minute wait.    Needless to say,  we left.   With a toddler,  that is not good.  This is not what call ahead means.   I don't think my family will go back.    On another note,  my husband went to go look at the beer wall to get an idea of what we were going to get.   As I walked over to him,  I about fell in my butt!  The floor was so slippery.   This is  not good for any body.    They need to utilize no wait."
Jonathan B.,"Bethel Park, PA",1,10,,2.0,12/23/2016,"I will say there food is decent, it is what you would expect for a national chain. There beer is very good, both in quality and variety. However, we have been here 3 times since they have opened, and the service is horribly slow, each time. They also are not a participating location for a number of the offers that they app offers.  This place has potential, I know it is a relatively new location, but the staff needs some serious additional training or enforcement by the manager.  I'm not writing this location off, but I hope they get the service figured out.  Also beware, the floors are crazy slippery, and that is when they are dry,"
Manuel T.,"Canonsburg, PA",0,4,,1.0,2/25/2017,"This was the 4th time we've been to BJ's and this place continues to disappoint.  Previous visits have been passable or just so-so.  Tonight can only be called terrible.   Here's why... First, there is an exceedingly long wait just to get seated.  Tonight took about an hour and a half and using their app to get a place in line is useless.  The BJ's app only puts your name on a list at the door but does not secure a spot in the queue as does restaurant's that use the NoWait app. The long wait might be understandable if BJ's was a unique place to go but it's not.  There are several craft brew places that serve food around the South Hills with new ones opening all the time.  There are a lot of choices available out here offering the same repertoire of food and drink. Secondly, the time it takes to get your food after ordering is ridiculously long.  Our order wasn't complicated.  We didn't order appetizers or adult beverages, only the entrees.  It took approximately 45 minutes to get an order of Fish Tacos and Fish and Chips.  The waiter was apologetic about the delay and sent the manager to the table.  We hadn't complained about the wait but the waiter realized it was excessive.  Maybe chewing the ice cubes from our drinks while tapping our fingers on the table was a clue? When our food did arrive, it was lukewarm at best.  The wilted lettuce garnish leads me to believe it had sat under a warming lamp for a while.  I was highly unimpressed.  To make up for the delay in getting served, we were offered a comp dessert, their ""Pizookie.""  We weren't expecting that and thanked them.   And we started waiting AGAIN! Finally, after waiting another 15 minutes for the ""Pizookies"" to arrive, and they never did, we got up and left.  I don't get how it takes that long to put a scoop of ice cream on a cookie.  I guess I'll never find anything out. Thankfully, we could pay the check electronically.  I would not have wanted to see how long it took to get our bill but I'm sure that is the one thing you'll get quickly. So with the long delays in getting your food, it's no wonder why it takes so long just to get seated.  These delays essentially blew the rest of the evening as we were there much longer than we could have imagined for what was ""bar food"" where the quality is concerned.   We won't be going back and if you are on a schedule, as going to dinner and a movie, go somewhere else or you'll be really late..."
