Elizabeth M.,"Ross Township, PA",164,191,55,2.0,11/15/2016,"A BJs recently opened in McCandless Crossing near our home. We've gone a few times because we really enjoy the food, however the service is always so horrible. We recently went to the BJs in the South Hills and I was interested in seeing if our experience would be different. It wasn't. The service was super slow and inattentive. We never got our appetizer. Had to ask for a refill from the bar several times and soft drinks/water cups ran dry without refills. They brought out the wrong flavor boneless wings, then charged us for both when we asked to keep the mistake wings since they would just be wasted anyway. We asked to speak with a manager after the waitress told us she wasn't allowed to take it off the bill, and the manager was very short with us. She did take the charge off our bill, but you could tell she just didn't want to deal with us. As a chain restaurant, you'd think they'd have the management and service down pat, but that just isn't the case with BJs. We've now been to two of these restaurants and both had the same poor service. Since this has been our experience across two restaurants and perhaps 6 visits, this issue is a management issue, not a server issue. They are either too short staffed for the number of tables they have or aren't giving their servers adequate training. Don't come here unless you have lots of time to kill and plenty of patience."
Erin G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,25,43,5.0,2/8/2017,I would normally have a picture of my food (chicken quinoa bowl) but I devoured it too fast. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The bartender was friendly and attentive even though she was busy. Great place!
Ralph F.,"Portland, OR",20,4,,5.0,3/8/2017,"For a first trip in as an out of towner, I really enjoyed my experience. I sat at the bar, and having Amy take care of me was awesome. She is obviously super knowledgeable, from beers to food, super helpful with her co-workers, and clearly cares about her guest's visit. When I am back in town I will be sure to come in again!"
Hollie K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,9,,3.0,8/7/2017,"The atmosphere is fun, but the food is sub-par. Service varies from good to decent. Great beer selection."
Toni D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,2.0,6/24/2017,Wait was very long even with call ahead. Appetizer came same time dinner. Food was just okay.
Katie S.,"Oakdale, PA",64,98,1,5.0,1/9/2017,"Great selection of drinks. Bar service really depends on who you get, some are great and others you can tell do not want to be there. Food is also amazing."
Jason P.,"Canonsburg, PA",39,13,1,1.0,11/8/2016,"Sigh. Took my daughter today for her 21st birthday. I have literally never seen such a disregard for customer service in my life. The disinterested millennial waitress actually seemed annoyed that we were there. I mentioned that it was my daughter's birthday, mainly to harass my daughter, and I might as well asked the millennial to swallow razor blades. The food was a a step better but just a step.  The sodas were flat. My daughter had the grilled cheese and soup. Meh. I had the jambalaya which was horrifically over spiced, not over spicy but Cajun-ed to hell and back. I thought to complain, and I hate being that guy, but the thought of trying to interact with the millennial seemed so painful, we just paid and left. Thank God, Doctor Strange was just about to start and we could at least eat popcorn to sati"
Ralph H.,"Bridgeville, PA",43,116,28,2.0,10/6/2016,Make a reservation and still wait an hour past reservation time. Overpriced ordinary food. Drinks were overpriced. Everything is overpriced. Spend your money elsewhere.
Chandra Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,4,,4.0,1/15/2017,Yea the food was really good. We ordered many chicken dishes and deep dish pizza too. And ambience was also so nice. But 1 thing I noticed which is not major is the crowd and noise. I felt little discomfort while having a chat with my family. Other than that rest all was superb.
Ed N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,14,,4.0,12/3/2016,Good food.  Pizza is very good but the sauce is a little bland.  It's very popular so be prepared to wait.
Brian S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,1,,3.0,1/2/2017,Enormous menu that the servers don't understand. Equal with the drinks. Food and drink can be good but you have to get lucky.
Mark C.,"Oakdale, PA",0,23,,2.0,5/2/2017,I wish I could give this place 4 stars because the beer and food deserve it. The disinterested bartenders and total lack of customer service deserve 2 stars. They appear to be more interested in congregating near the service area then waiting on paying customers.  They lack personality and people skills and are better suited for a service only bar then one with actual patrons who want to grab a drink and have a meal. Not sure we will ever return.
Rick H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,6,,3.0,12/17/2016,"First visit to the new bjs at south hills village, the call ahead seating apparently has no affect as we waited an hour after calling in 2hrs  edited our arrival time.  Food quality was good, although some of the portions were a little misleading in the menu.  The biggest deduction was for safety, as all of the floors were a complete ice-rink!  And it was just as bad when we left as it was when we arrived!"
Nicole H.,"Carnegie, PA",48,12,,2.0,11/27/2016,"Not sure I will ever go back here. I had a bad experience. It took a long time to get sat and once we were sat, no one acknowledged us. Our waitress forgot about us the whole time and we didn't receive great food or service. The two stars are for the delicious cocktails I had at the bar."
Lindsay S.,"Alexandria, VA",3,77,,2.0,3/16/2017,Equivalent to any chain with mass produced over salted food. Not horrific but no different than a TGIF or Applebee's
Kara S.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,56,1,1.0,9/2/2016,Wish I could comment on the food but had family in town and wanted to try this place out and take them somewhere near our home since we were going after a long day at work. Waited over an hour and 45 minutes and still no table ready. Maybe would have continued to wait but there definitely wasn't a lot of food coming out of the kitchen and the staff seemed to be too busy socializing to get the place in order. Probably going to avoid this place for a while!
Dan H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,11,2,3.0,11/9/2016,This is a ok restaurant. The service is par and so is the food. The portion size is big which is a plus. The design of the place is very nice and modern looking. Overall not a bad place but there are definitely better.
Jo Ann T.,"Nashport, OH",0,2,3,1.0,11/2/2016,"The starter salads served were great, but my friend was served her salad five minutes before my salad came to the table. The bison burger was disappointing. The slaw served with it was terrible. The waitress had little patience with my elderly friend. I have dined at the BJ's in Columbus, Ohio and it is always wonderful. I'm very disappointed with the service and the food and will not be back."
D. Max W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",71,12,,1.0,10/18/2016,"I went there with my wife tonight. We order iced tea, brussel sprouts. And a thin pizza. The sprouts were delivered by someone who was not our server.  We got the sprouts before anything else, and by anything else I mean water, iced tea, any thing. I asked to speak to the manager who was standing right behind our table, and no such luck. What ever he was doing must have been earth end important because he never came. The tea finally came but I had to tell the waitress that i no longer wished to dine at that establishment. I felt bad for the waitress as I'm sure it was not her fault but we never set food in that business again."
Kim B.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,45,3,1.0,10/6/2016,Why give BJ's a Star? Other day went for lunch and I didn't like menu. Im not particularly picky but the prices and smallness of dishes wasn't worth it. So I stared at menu wondering ? I'll just try 1 thing& I had calamari . I love Calamari but BJ's was like they dipped gum bands in batter- tough & they must be frozen tasted that way. I never ate her before and won't be back! I left and had a great lunch at bonefish at least there it's fresh!
