Danae L.,"Fremont, CA",360,430,79,4.0,12/4/2017,"Called in on 12/03 at 7 PM for a party of 25. The host explained that there is a large group about to leave and we could swoop the area if arrived ASAP. Our entire party arrived within half an hour but the area was still occupied. The host explained that they've been here since 5 PM and the bill is paid so they should be leaving any minute. Unfortunately we ended up waiting an entire hour. I saw a few tables open up, but for whatever reason the staff wanted us to wait for the specific corner.  Service was quick and smooth. Special thanks for the birthday shoutout for our friend."
Sam T.,"San Leandro, CA",67,79,11,1.0,11/20/2017,"Terrible pizza today ... First of, service was very slow.  Ordered online hoping that we can get the order in time during our lunch hour.  Nope that didn't help.   BJ was having 1/2 off on Monday for large pizzas.  I believe they compensate by halving the toppings on the pizzas because there were rarely any toppings."
Jose I.,"Dixon, CA",1,29,2,1.0,10/23/2017,"I won't suggest you not to visit this well known restaurant, but without a doubt I need to ask you to check the utensils before taking them to your mouth.   The last two times my family and I have visited BJ's, we have had the disgusting experience of finding utensils with food residues on it.  No water stains, but food residues on more than one utensil.  First time was so disgusting I couldn't post the photos; pieces of onions on the utensils.  The second time, yesterday, the waitress asked the manager to come to us.  The manager listened to our complaint, and limited himself to apologize.  I got the impression he was more concerned about preventing others from seeing the old food residues on the utensils.   What shocked us the most was the way he dismissed the whole situation.  He told me: ""Feel free to go or to stay"". That was when I decided to post the utensils photo.  Of course, he didn't know I took photos. Thank you for reading my review, and don't forget to watch out for BJ's lack of hygiene."
Samantha L.,"Vacaville, CA",0,4,,4.0,1/9/2018,"My husband and I each ordered a dinner meal. Mine came out before his, and we waited 20+ minutes before asking where his food was, thinking maybe since it was busy that it was just taking a while. My drink also sat without a refill during this time.The waiter forgot to put my husband's order in the computer. 40 minutes after putting our initial order in, we still didn't have his meal. We decided to just pack my food up and take it as a loss, but the manager came over and offered to comp our meals. The wait was frustrating, but it was handled well."
Amber D.,"Suisun City, CA",0,8,2,5.0,1/10/2018,"Love this place...best bloody Mary's and appetizers. Always something new on the menu, great cooks, and host...etc."
Avtar S.,"Woodland, CA",28,98,112,2.0,7/23/2017,This was one of my worst visits to BJs. I had to wait an hour for food even though it wasn't busy and then the service was so so. I gave my rewards card and the server forgot to load my points. Food was okay. I got the A Drink Like That which always tastes amazing. No Pizookie today bc they took so long getting food. I expect a lot better as I frequent BJs a lot.  Update : came in on a Sunday. Took 40 mins to get food and it came in 2 at a time. By the time one thing came the others had already eaten. Unacceptable slow service when it's not even that busy. Manager didn't even care when we complained to him and walked off like it's not a big deal at all. No urgency from manager!!! Won't come to this location again.
Joven S.,"Fairfield, CA",19,111,311,3.0,6/17/2017,"What can I say, it's BJ's. Been here on many occasions, from get togethers, birthdays, and just for a meal. Overall the restaurant is always busy. The tables and restrooms are usually clean. Depending on how busy the place is, the wait can be between 5-30 minutes. Service for the most part is average, which is why I only gave 3 stars. The staff and servers are friendly, but the level of service can fluctuate everytime.  Now to the food. Usually go with their soup and salad combo. The chicken tortilla soup is probably my favorite thing here. I tried their seared ahi tuna salad. The ingredients are good, but their ginger soy vinaigrette is hit or miss. The last time I tried it, it was way too salty. Stuffed mushroom appetizer is good but not mind blowing, and I've also had their wedge salad which was good.  I'm sure I'll be back at BJ's again. The food is decent, it's fairly close to home, but they could definitely work on their service. If they could increase the quality of service in a consistent way, I would give them 4 stars."
Ken Y.,"Vacaville, CA",0,19,,4.0,1/4/2018,Consistently good food and service. A little noisy but a good choice if you're in the mood for food during the week.
Kent E.,"Concord, CA",7,3,,1.0,12/24/2017,"Stopped here for the first time on a road trip. The menu pages stuck together, my flatware had food on it, and the food was awful."
Viclaire S.,"Fairfield, CA",266,342,1916,2.0,1/22/2017,"I give this place a 2 because, darn, I want to give it more, but each time I return, it keeps declining in service.  I do appreciate the variety of beers, food, desserts they have, but the service needs some help.  We were seated right away, both myself and my husband wanted the unlimited soup and salad.  Unaware that it only pertains to the WEEKDAYS, we ordered, even pointing it on the menu to the server while ordering.  I know, we probably should have read the menu more however, I feel the server has a responsibility to give us a heads up.  How we found out?  Read below.   When she finally came, she asked if we wanted anything else or dessert.  This is how we found out about the soup/salad:  My husband wanted another chicken tortilla soup and she says it is only available for weekdays.  HMMM.  Mind you, this was very late in our meal, meaning- we were not checked on throughout our meal. We told her no and then it took awhile for her to bring our check AND did not clear our table.  We had 2 empty bowls and 2 plates the ENTIRE time.   What annoyed me the most was that she smiled and acted like she did a great job.  Not once did she apologized for taking too long, and not clarifying the unlimited soup/salads. I can't say I won't be back here again.  Chances are, I will.  But it won't be as often and it could be.  I hope management can turn it around here."
Amber M.,"Fairfield, CA",2,55,78,1.0,7/22/2017,"It's always hit or miss with BJ's. Thursday was a MISS.  Arrived for early lunch at 10:50am and waited for doors to open at 11:00am.  We were second to be seated.  By 11:15am 8 tables sitting with me menus and no drinks.  We were all sat side by side, back to back in a huge restaurant.  The music was even louder than it usually is, it seemed.  It was clear this wasn't starting off well.  I ordered a unlimited soup and salad.  It arrived at 11:45am.  Every table was looking around and talking out loud questioning the service and wait time.  The tortilla soup was room temperature (which made me nervous).  It was covered in chips-- I asked for NO chips on top. I had to scoop them off to a napkin and after five or six spoonfuls the soup was gone.  I ordered a refill and that one arrived with no chips, and with avocado, cilantro, and cheese on top and was piping hot.  Who got the first one together? The server who realized we'd been waiting for ever?  The table beside had already given the server a hard time and I saw another getting ready.  We wanted to just pay, leave, and go home and eat something.  It's so obvious where BJ's goes wrong and lacks inefficiency.  Sometimes you get a good server and sometimes you don't.  A good management team would rectify that. There is no excuse for the wait time when staff exceeds the customer ratio, for the excessive music volume, and inconsistent food items."
Jim S.,"Fairfield, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/10/2018,awesome customer service! Big fan of making sure we aren't running low on water. Very attentive!
Juliette M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,26,5,1.0,12/16/2017,"(let me just say if you are going to eat here , your going to have to wait at least an hour for you food busy or not, it's ridiculous ) I've been coming here for a while and honestly it gets worse and worse each visit. Tonight was probably the worse because of our rude stuck up waitress. Her negative vibe just made the night awkward for me and my guests. Not only was our waitress bad but the food took MORE then an hour to arrive we were in that restaurant for 2 hours! When we were trying to get our check to leave the waitress was no where in sight. I think this is that last time I will be eating here. Food is ok"
Emily J.,"Concord, CA",379,1293,166,2.0,6/25/2017,"After a morning of outlet shopping my mom and I decided to pop in here for a bite to eat. We had been previously and I tend to give BJs a solid three stars.  On this day, they were particularly busy, probably due to it being end of the school year/grad season. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait and we didn't wait nearly that long, which was great. Until we waited for what felt like forever after being seated.  We were there for at least 10 minutes before our server was able to get to us. In his defense, he seemed to be juggling a lot of tables, including at least one big 12+ group. We waited another 10 minutes or so for our iced tea and lemonade.  Then we waited some more...  And some more...  30+ minutes later our server, who we hadn't seen since we ordered, finally pops by to let us know that my grilled shrimp tacos were taken to the wrong table by mistake. He said that they were redoing my dish right then and it shouldn't be much longer. Another 15 minutes pass and our dishes finally arrived.  Right as we started to finally eat, a manager came by to check on us. She was super apologetic and offered a free pizookie to try to make it up to us. A nice gesture, although I didn't really want her to stick around and chat because we were quite hungry at that point. The food itself was alright. Unfortunately, it seemed that my mom's burger and fries spent some time under a heat lamp waiting on the take two of my food.  We did take them up on the free pizookie offer, and got a mini salted caramel. Unfortunately, it lacked the salted caramel flavor and half the cookie stuck to the little pan. Meh."
Sac M.,"Sacramento, CA",39,180,426,2.0,8/11/2017,Updated review from recent visit  Bjs is one of my favorite restaurants and is usually consistent I've been to a few locations and always received good food and good service however not this time service was decent  but unfortunately the pizza I ordered was horrible it came out very sloppy Doughy and full of cheese the pizza seemed very under cooked I've never seen a bjs pizza look like this it was falling apart and we could barely hold it  I wanted to send it back and get a refund but our server was nice so we ate it while being unsatisfied leaving very disappointed this experience left a bad taste in my mouth not sure what was cooking on or who the cook was this night but I wasn't at all happy this location is going down hill  Food selection : half bjs favorite half California
Matt T.,"Vacaville, CA",0,20,13,1.0,12/23/2017,Terrible service! Be prepared to wait at lest 45 minutes for an appetizer you probably won't get until your actual main dish comes out. Poorly supervised.
Chris H.,"Sacramento, CA",5,57,33,4.0,8/21/2017,Service by Allison H was great. She was friendly and on top of everything. Drinks were good my strawberry mojito was amazing.  I drive from Woodland just to come and eat here.
Noelle D.,"Vacaville, CA",70,29,57,1.0,2/19/2017,"I should have learned after ordering one of my favorite meals here, Chicken Alfredo and receiving it uncooked and cold not once, not twice but three times and tonight a fourth. Yes, I should have learned my lesson after the first one but I didn't. Literally every time I've ordered this it's been uncooked and cold.  Stick to a salad or pizookie to be safe if your coming here and do not order the Chicken Alfredo! Very disappointing. I"
Patricia C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,6,1,5.0,12/10/2017,"So what started to be the WORST DINNER ever turned out to be the best THANKS TO BREEANN !! GOOD SAVE GIRL!!! Because of your super positive vibe and quick response to us being unattended for almost 20 minutes !!! Yeah you read it right 20 minutes!! Without anyone saying hello , have you been helped etc. I did approach the general manager and was almost about to FLIP MY LID when Frank walked me back to my table in disbelief assuring me he would take care of us. BREEANN stepped In took our order and we were eating in 15 minutes !! Honestly if it wasn't for Frank and Breeanns professionalism we had oils have  left. We need more people like this"
Erica L.,"San Jose, CA",102,7,3,1.0,10/26/2017,"I walked into this place wanting to enjoy a meal but first had to go to the women's restroom to change my baby. The second I walk into this restroom the horrid smell of fills my nose completely so I walk back out (baby in hand) to ask the two young girls to please go into the bathroom. They both look at me as if to question why I'm even asking in the first place! They're in the restroom only seconds because they both come out with puzzled looks on their faces and ask me what's wrong. I follow with an obvious the restroom reeks and can they please freshen it up but for some ridiculous reason they answer with ""they don't THINK they have anything."" And continue to stare at me like I'm in the wrong for asking them to do this unthinkable task! Never coming here again just for these reasons alone. I'll take the trip to the next place nearest.  nasty a**es"
Lin D.,"Vacaville, CA",12,26,3,5.0,11/12/2017,"We've been going there for years. Nice casual dining. Can get loud, but that's just the atmosphere. We like the pizza, salad options, and dessert :) they have a nice selection of adult beverages too"
Clemmie K.,"Stockton, CA",6,54,,5.0,9/6/2017,"PHENOMENAL meal at the Vacaville BJS Monday night! And the restaurant was FULL, with waiting line, and our meals came quickly.  And the restaurant floors and table/benches were very clean. We all ordered very different dishes and all of them were top notch!  Veggies were fresh, not overcooked.  Fish and Chips were probably the BEST I've ever had.  The ""enlightened"" Lemon Thyme Chicken with red peppers, Brussel sprouts, onions and brown rice was OVER THE TOP awesome.  The Chicken breast was tender and flavorful!  The Shrimp pasta was also incredibly delicious as was the Spaghetti and meatballs.  The servings (except the pasta) were HUGE.  Our waitress and other staff were friendly, attentive and efficient.  It astounds (and impresses) me how a LARGE chain, totally PACKED with a waiting line, can deliver four meals simultaneously, all very different, and ALL cooked perfectly.  We WILL be visiting this restaurant again. Compliments to all their chefs, cooks, servers, and cleaning staff!"
Matt B.,"Vacaville, CA",0,31,6,5.0,11/12/2017,Best. Restaurant. In. Vacaville. We're not exactly known for our fine dining here but all things considered BJs is a pretty good time. There's a huge variety of things to chose from on the menu so everyone can get something they like. The bar is huge and has a great selection.  The service here is always good. Sometimes even great.
Kim O.,"Morongo Valley, CA",62,143,99,4.0,7/1/2016,"I've always been a fan of this chain. They have delicious pizookies and a huge menu with a lot of options. If you visit, download their free app so you can earn points towards a discount or a free pizookie We used to come a lot for their happy hour. They used to offer great drink prices and had good deals on a happy hour meal menu. I wish they'd bring this menu back; their current happy hour isn't nearly as good."
Russ M.,"Fairfield, CA",2,23,13,1.0,11/6/2017,"Came in for my birthday dinner with the family. It took about a half hour longer than quoted to be seated. No worries. Plenty of time to chat & catch up. Our server (I don't remember her name) was very nice & seemed to take our orders intently, however when our food came out there were a few items missing. My Mother & my sister's meals didn't arrive until 25 minutes after everyone else received theirs, meaning they were left to watch everyone else eat. Also the rack of ribs that my brother clearly told her we were going to split (and she repeated back to him) never made it to our table. My ribeye steak (ordered medium) came out well done & was rather tasteless. I ate only half if it because it was very unappetizing. Very disappointing. I would rather be leaving a much happier review, but this was my experience on this night. I think next year I'll choose a different place."
Shannan R.,"Vacaville, CA",6,18,7,2.0,8/8/2017,Made reservations for our daughters 26 birthday. Been here about 45 so far we've gotten a beer!  This service is the worse.
Amanda L.,"San Mateo, CA",83,224,145,3.0,11/23/2016,"3 stars! The bf and I came in to have some dinner on a cold, rainy night. Mostly the reason we came here was because we wanted to watch the Warriors game and treat ourselves, woohoo!  We waited about 20 minutes (watch out for when it gets busy, not much standing room while you wait, esp. when it's raining outside...).  Our server Kevin was super cool, we ordered a calamari right off the bat, then ordered a clam chowder in sourdough bread bowl (for me) and jambalaya (for bf). Kevin was super friendly, helped us with our choices, and provided us with the pizzokie menu, yay! The calamari was pretty standard, no big deal, I always appreciate that they offer the marinara or the Ranch-ish dressing, nomm.  I recommend the sourdough bread bowl, because so far, every BJ's I have gone to has NOT let me down! Always a great flavor of some garlic and the right amount of savor. The clam chowder was yummy, not overly salty and just the right amount as well to fit into the bowl. It was filled with lots of seafood goodies, so at least they didn't skimp out! :)  The jambalaya was kind of a miss, overly spiced and needed a little more rice pilaf to balance out the KICK IN THE FACE flavor. Maybe our chef just over spiced?  Oh, and need I say anything about the pizookie? It was SO YUM. Just one was enough for the two of us. We enjoyed the cookies n cream flavor, and the cookie was very rich.  Overall, 3 to 3.5 stars."
RC S.,"Lemoore, CA",2,3,1,1.0,12/18/2016,"Eating here now.  Let's start with the silverware: we were seated and didn't get the silverware until after the soup and appetizers were given and had to wait until we can get the server to come back to us.  The Calamari had no discernible flavor; the medium rare ribeye camelback medium(not a huge deal); the mashed potato was extremely dry; the steamed Broccoli was also dry (I asked the waitress if the broccoli was in fact steamed, but she said they were ""microwaved"");  This is extremely disappointing."
Lucas D.,"La Mesa, CA",36,1,,1.0,11/11/2017,"If i could put a lower rating i most definitely would. I probably should have learned the first time after having the runs all day after eating here the first time but me and my wife went there yesterday and yet again we both felt like absolute crap afterwards my wife felt sick later that night and i also felt sick, i am currently pooping my brains out as i write this review please do not eat here"
J.C. D.,"Vacaville, CA",1,12,6,5.0,11/6/2017,"I come here from time to time. They have delicious plates and great brew. I'm a fan of the Blonde and Irish Red. They go well with their pizzas. I also enjoy there avocado rolls and Chicken Alfredo. Service is great, there's never been an issue. I've been a fan of this place since it opened and will continue to be."
Sandy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",98,17,7,3.0,10/20/2017,"It's BJ's: predictably mediocre at best. I always order  the black and blue burger and they always over  cook it. Every time. Even if I ask for it still mooing. He wait staff remind me of actors working towards achieving stardom by waiting tables...but this is Vacaville, not LA. Sigh...where else are you going to eat after 8pm in this town? nowhere! So I know I'll be back because I have no choice lol."
Dan G.,"Vacaville, CA",13,15,7,1.0,7/12/2017,Came here with girlfriend. My girlfriend asked to pay with cash and rest on card. Server reiterated and said she was doing that. Brought back a receipt showing 30 paid on card when our tab was 30 and we gave 20 cash. Had to track down the server 10 min later and said she charged the full card. Girl hesitated and was like oh I made a mistake and when my girlfriend asked for her 20 dollars back she pulled it out of her pocket... hmmm M
Victoria S.,"Templeton, CA",75,19,20,4.0,4/13/2017,"Our first visit was good. Server was personable and helped with ordering from the huge menu. Calamari is delicious. Second experience was ok. Server started out being accommodating and helpful but then the place got too busy for him to be personable. Food coming out was slow, and ordering a second beer was slow. Salad was way over dressed and the ribs seemed to be spicier than last time. Once the kids were done it seemed he wanted to clear plates so I asked for a box. He brought a box and our check. Didn't ask about dessert, which we wanted. He just seemed too busy the whole service. I think it's a good chain but they complicate their own service with a huge menu and too many tables per server. Stout beer is really good.... Maybe order to-go next time."
Paul J.,"Vacaville, CA",0,2,,3.0,11/2/2017,"My waitress was great, super helpful. They forgot the mac n cheese, but got it out quickly after a gentle reminder. Food was delicious!"
Robyn L.,"Vacaville, CA",33,4,,1.0,10/28/2017,"I took my kids here for my birthday. Made the mistake of ordering the calamari as an appetizer. It was overcooked, greasy, and very tough. My daughter got one of the kids meals, which you can't really mess up macaroni and cheese. I got some chicken entree and my son got steak. The food was overly salty, greasy, and difficult to eat. We ended up leaving most of it behind. Definitely learned my lesson never to eat here again."
Arledge D.,"Lake Buena Vista, FL",3,10,,4.0,10/14/2017,Love this joint.  Good food and great service.  A lot of choices.  Have not had a dish I didn't like.  Good place to bring the kids.  Also a good place to watch sports.  Prices are decent.  Would recommend this if you have family members that like different types of foods.  Their deserts are not bad either...Selection is limited but good.
Iris J.,"Fairfield, CA",0,2,,5.0,3/16/2017,"I dine here often but tonight Our server was an order taker. Checked on us once, but Anthony our food runner person was phenomenal!! He delivered our salads. Began a conversation about the beer we ordered and mentioned that there was a brewery in winters we should visit! Very personable! He also delivered our entrees and came right back with the additional items we needed! He was a gem. Much better than our waitress. Made us feel like we were at home. He should be a server. Very professional. If he were serving  I'd ask to sit in his section!!! Keep up the great job Anthony!!!!"
Dandyd S.,"Antelope, CA",28,154,23,3.0,9/25/2017,"Enjoyed just about everything from the server to the food.  Everything was well seasoned, nothing bland.  But three out of four of us ordered a dish that came with French fries.  They were nice and crispy.  The knock is that there is no ketchup on the table.  No table had ketchup on it.  What kind of brew pub doesn't automatically have ketchup out?  The person who delivered the food didn't ask if we wanted anything else.  We were half way through our meals when we received ranch dressing and ketchup.  Red Robin is next door, and if we were in the mood for burgers it would be a tough decision to decide where to go as BJs always seems to have a long wait time."
Nicole S.,"Vacaville, CA",48,123,14,5.0,3/10/2017,Love BJ every time I go! I craved there roasted Brussel sprouts and there burgers!  I also am in love with the fact the support local brewery's in our area even though they are a corporation themselves. I'm a huge supporter of anything local.  I will say they do not do well with large groups and I would call for a reservation just to make sure you don't have a wait! But all in all it's a great place to go out for a bite and a great drink in Vacaville.
Kayla C.,"Fairfield, CA",89,17,21,4.0,4/7/2017,"Went here with a friend last night! It was super busy, but lucky for us it was just a seat for two and they had a table open just for two right then and there :-) so we didn't have to wait to be seated. The lady who sat us and our host, Taylor, was very kind! Although we had to wait quite awhile for our main entrees and pizookie to come out, it was a reasonable wait considering the fact that they were busy. We both had the salted caramel pizookie and it was to die for!!!!! And this was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't disappointed :-)"
