Samuel M.,"Santa Rosa, CA",27,29,74,4.0,4/26/2015,"i really always enjoy BJs brewhouse. This particular location is nice, as far as the atmosphere the service is a 5 out of 5 I would say i think the food here may be a bit overcooked though which does get frustrating but overall i give this location 4 stars"
Josephine A.,"Vacaville, CA",0,5,,2.0,11/10/2016,New menu is not that great. I miss the Balsamic Chicken. Last time we were there it took a very long time to get our food and then my sons food was forgotten. By the time his food came we were ready to go. The manager was great and ended up taking good care of us.
Rebecca A.,"Valley Springs, CA",0,12,1,2.0,4/27/2016,Sorry we chose this place the wedge salad had brown edges and the calamari was cold it's unfortunate because bjs in elkgrove ca is great Guess management should take a close looks at things
Vedran V.,"Dixon, CA",129,341,153,2.0,1/22/2014,"First of all....Brewhouse? Where is the brewhouse? The tanks are there but no beer is actually brewed here...The closest BJ's that brews beer is in Reno. So to start off I am already deducting one star for this very reason from my review. We are at 4 stars now.  Ambiance is classic sports pub/bar/restaurant...loud and flashy with dozens of flat screens flickering. There is a dining room to the left and a bar area to the right of the entrance as at any other BJs I've been to. Waitress came over to take orders...As there was a ""specials"" menu on the table I ordered the seasonal Double IPA they advertise. Guess what? The gal came back and said they were out. Next I tried my luck with the Belgian special release....no luck there either. So what it comes down to is two beers they advertise at EVERY table are not available. Another star down. We are at 3 stars now. Eventually I settled for Arrogant Bastard as any  of the other brews they had on tap were not appealing and I tried all BJs own beers in the past anyway.  The funny thing was the service staff is so misinformed about the ""BREWHOUSE"" menu that they don't even know what is on tap. Co-worker asked for Kona Longboard and the gal was ""We don't carry that!""..even though they do and it is clearly listed on the beer menu. Another star down. So now we're at two. Finally the food..The food is okay. Not super-great, not super-bad. Just average. Had mini chicken tacos and they tasted aight. The service besides being slow and misinformed was not horrible. Half star up... So we are at 2 1/2....But Yelp doesn't do 2 1/2. BJ's for me is not 3 stars...so 2 will have to do. Better luck next time."
Ryan H.,"Escondido, CA",159,63,74,5.0,3/20/2015,We had the BJs special deep dish pizza. The atmosphere was good. Lots of families. My wife had the Thai shrimp wraps that were very good. Our server Cameron was very friendly and gave us excellent service! For desert we had the famous PIZOOKIE.
Den C.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/12/2014,"I've been to this location a handful of times now and keep returning because of the good food and the Pizookie.  A night out with the husband or the ladies?  This is a great spot.  Kids or big party? I'd recommend.     The menu is reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory with pages and pages of choices.   It is a challenge to pick from as the options are almost endless.  I always can't decide.  The calamari is scrumptious.  I can eat that with a cocktail and be totally satisfied.   The Shrimp Scampi Pasta and Angel Hair Classico with Scallops are delicioso!   We were quite surprised by the amount of seafood they put in thier servings.  No skimping here.  Deep dish pizzas...yum.  Ahi tuna salad...amazing!  Skip the shrimp tacos as the tortillas are dry. Drinks: The Nutty Brewnette and Piranha Ale are given thumbs up by the husband.  The Strawberry Splash is now my favorite:  Vodka, Ameretto, pina colada mix and strawberry slurry...wish I was on a beach with that in my hand.   Now...on to the Pizookie.   That giant cookie sundae puts me in chocolate heaven.  The original and the Smores one (if they haven't ran out) are the best.   I dream of these.  I've tried most variations and return to the basics. Service:  it's a hit and miss.   I've had great service and some slow service but I can forgive that because I always walk out with a full belly and good times. *****Update 2016.  Service on most days are not good.  My favorite pastas have become tasteless, and the smores pizookie is no longer.  I'd just come here for the pizza."
Abby C.,"Fairfield, CA",1,18,,1.0,3/7/2016,"1 star for the calamari that's it. I haven't been here for ages due to a bad experience but gave this place the benefit of the doubt... huge mistake! For a salad and calamari, waited freakin' 45 minutes and they're not even that busy."
Dean C.,"Napa, CA",20,17,6,5.0,3/23/2016,Our server Corey was awesome!  I ordered an IPA and he brought me a sample of a another beer he thought I would like without me even asking about other beers. He was right the other beer was great.  He was friendly and lively. The food and drinks were good too.
John C.,"Saratoga, CA",10,67,186,4.0,10/28/2014,"Drop in for a causal lunch. Honestly, I didn't expect much from a chain restaurant. But to my surprise the food is quite decent and service is good. Greeted by a cute girl at the door is a good start. Couple of drinks right after ordering is cool. Then the crispy southern fried chicken completes my very simple but good lunch time."
Fer R.,"Oakley, CA",237,341,1803,5.0,3/27/2013,"On a Sunday wanting an early grub session after shopping at the outlets with Wendy K. is great but having to wait to be seated sucks. It comes with the territory though and as other Yelpers have said, everyone wants to eat here! And parking does suck! We parked in BFE but Wendy K got Rockstar parking! Lucky b***h!! lol To the bar! We ordered our drinks and waited in the lobby sitting with them. We were given a buzzer and waited patiently. Two drinks downed by now...ugh I hate waiting! Finally got our table for 8 and our waitress greeted us professionally and with that million dollar smile! Samantha was her name. Wendy K and I both loved that she was so personable and very happy to wait on us. Not like it was this tedious job or anything. The PIRANHA NACHOS ($9.95) were FANTASTIC and HUGE!!! Everything nacho lovers like on their nachos was on them! Totally filling enough for a meal in itself! Scampi pasta was cooked perfectly. I got alot of shrimp! Totally worth paying $15.95 for! Hubby had the tacos, chicken I think. They were devoured so they must have been good! I know he stole a few of my shrimp and threw them onto his tacos LOL!! For dessert the kids got the PIZOOKIE!!! You can't go to BJ's and not leave without having one! They got the oreo pizookie this time. They sure ""licked"" their plates clean! Again, lemme state that Samantha our waitress was the bomb, whatever we needed she was on it! She made the entire stay at BJ's a delightful one. Her cheery demeanor was contagious! Please keep her around BJ's!!"
Shante G.,"Vallejo, CA",167,41,76,1.0,2/7/2016,"If I could give a zero star I would!!!!! OMG!!!! I got the Chicken Parmesan with Mash Potatoes and Broccoli, it was DRY AND DISGUSTING...!!!! The waitress we had Nicole is not good with customer service and she didn't seem like she wanted to be at work! I will NEVER EVER IN MY LIFE COME BACK HERE & I will not recommend this place to any of my friends or family!!! Everything my family got was DISGUSTING!!!! They need a new cool or cook it fresh! Taste like it came out of the microwave"
Matt R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,47,21,2.0,8/28/2014,"WARNING. WARNING WARNING This is an update after eating the food.. As in indicated previously about lack of constancy,  this update and picture are proof and identifies a LACK IN THEIR QUALITY CONTROL.. There simply is none.  The Pazuki is burned and discussing.  The size is about 30 percent of what it should be. However My daughter indicates that her tortilla soup is the best...Please see picture of Pazuki. I've been here many times (average 15-20 / yr. ).. Nice atmosphere, staff are pleasant.  I have 3 issues that keeps occurring. 1) Lack of constancy.  2 dishes i like are jambaliah and shrimp scampi. You can order either one on different days and it is totally different, sometimes so different that i send it back.. WARNING. If you send it back, it's not going to get better, my advice is to order something basic like a burger.  Difference is okay as long as the basic flavors are still there. 2) When using the take out, the person on taking the order has a most difficult time.  This was not always the case, see one of my previous reviews.  In the past 6-8 months it takes 5-10 minutes to get it ordered. 3) The online ordering menu DOES NOT have all the dishes, so unless you know the menu, you wont get all items.   ADITIONALLY, the web design has changed and has become VERY difficult to navigate.   A AEARCH FUNCTION would be extremely helpful"
Beatrice P.,"Sacramento, CA",23,102,13,5.0,1/16/2016,"Always love going to BJ's for their happy hour! Our server Devin did a great job, and went above and beyond to make us happy. This is one of the only restaurants I frequent, since I moved to Vacaville."
Becky N.,"Fairfield, CA",7,257,18,2.0,10/9/2015,Service alright. The food was poor. None of them was up to our standards. I like the layout of this place though.
Dexter F.,"Fairfield, CA",0,4,,4.0,9/22/2016,"Nice atmosphere very good food and excellent service. They accidentally gave us the wrong drinks and gave us free appetizers to apologize. We have been back several times and always have a good experience. I am not a big fan of ""chain"" restaurants but. I have to say this is the exception to that rule."
Justin A.,"San Diego, CA",99,991,134,2.0,5/31/2013,"Beer Stop 33 --- I doubt you can classify as BJ's as a beer stop, but oh well. I was staying at the Residence Inn for a few days, and when I saw the sign ""brewhouse"" I got immediately excited.  The beers are awful! They all taste like a science experiment gone bad. Oh well."
Ashiana K.,"Vacaville, CA",102,196,394,5.0,11/18/2013,"A party of three went to BJ's for some dinner and dessert one night.  In this visit, what stands out more than the food was our server.  Our server, Cameron (hope I spelled his name right) was the MOST amazing server I've ever had at the Vacaville BJ's. Not only was he super friendly but he was completely honest about the menu. He shared with us that the new & improved menu that would be released on November 12th which included the holiday pizookies. I truly enjoyed his personality, skills, and customer service. I look forward to him being my server again!"
Allain L.,"Vallejo, CA",70,41,41,5.0,2/6/2016,Great service; food was delicious. Had a classic burger with cheddar and the wedge-cut seasoned fries. And for after dinner...  a cookies and cream pizookie! Absolutely amazing.
Leeann G.,"Fairfield, CA",2,19,28,4.0,10/20/2014,"Great service everytime I come here, & oh so delicious food! I always order the shrimp scampi pasta which is loaded with shrimp, al dente angel hair pasta & packed with buttery garlic goodness. They honestly hook it up everytime! I eat half of it & save the other for a good sized meal for later. This also leaves some room for their famous heaven on earth pizookies, but if you're too full for one you can order one to go ;) My boyfriends favorite is the Barbeque Pulled Pork sandwich, which also used to be my favorite. The pulled pork is uber juicy, tender & flavorful, and the bun is toasted on the outside but soft on the inside. It usually comes with coleslaw but my bf always gets fries instead."
Sally P.,"Winters, CA",143,101,705,4.0,8/5/2015,"Thank you BJ's for finding my lost credit card!  They said they get about 5 a day!  I was here last night for dinner with a pal, the dinner was great, the service was great.  I would give 5 stars, except for the noise level!  I love you BJ's!"
