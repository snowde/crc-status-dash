Pamela D.,"Vacaville, CA",465,29,14,5.0,6/20/2017,I love BJs food! So good! Its almost always busy so there's normally a wait but its worth it. Love the rewards/points program.
Alfred F.,"Oakland, CA",106,8,1,4.0,5/9/2017,"BJ's has the very best Burger I have ever had the flavor takes over your mouth. The service is great and speedy. I recommend BJ's to anyone looking for a romantic date, delicious meal, or even dinner with the family."
Teri M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,8,5,1.0,11/23/2016,Worst service & food. Our Ribeye had no flavor & we were never asked how our food was & if we needed anything. We had 3 different people dropping off food & they literally dropped it & ran. Stick to Tahoe Joes & Outback!!!
Violet H.,"Fairfield, CA",107,55,6,3.0,7/2/2016,"We have seen an unfortunate steady decline in the quality of the food and the general experience each time we come, over the last few months. The service was great for our visits earlier on, and has shifted to a variable range of crappy to decent service. I get a really simple order, and while it's rarely messed up it's just not particularly good nor worth the cost. My husband, who doesn't complain about pretty much anything expressed that he no longer has interest in going to this BJs. Tonight specifically... Cold fries, waiting too long for a check, boring over priced food. And the server sat at our table with us. That's weird and made me a little uncomfortable. My husband adds, ""it gets more meh every time we go."" Also, see the picture of the soup. How gross does this look? The principles of emulsification are pretty simple. Apparently it didn't taste *bad* but certainly not good enough to eat any more than what is shown in the picture. *we don't drink alcohol so we cannot comment on that aspect*"
Tim W.,"Suisun City, CA",33,8,,1.0,1/28/2017,"I'm not the kind of person to complain and make a scene about bad service and tonight was no different, but I left the restraunt so irritated that I think they deserve my bad review.  The waitress was excellent, no complaints there.  I ordered a rib-eye steak, Lilian ordered their glazed salmon and my grandson had mac n cheese.  I have never had a bad rib-eye anywhere until tonight.  It looked delicious and was a generous portion for 25 bucks but it was very chewy and bland.  No flavor at all.  I wasn't going to complain because the appetizers were delicious and so was my baked potato but the waitress asked me what was wrong when she notice my steak on my plate.  I told her the problem with it and she apologized and said she will talk to the manager and get 50% taken off the price.  This made me happy.  10 minutes later she returned to my table and told me the manager would give me a free cookie for desert but no discount!  WHAT!  How does that make up for a 25 dollar steak that I didn't even eat!  I was insulted by that and it changed my whole mood.  In all honesty, I've never been a fan of BJ's anyway, I always order something different because I haven't found anything I really like that much.  This is the last time I go there.  If the manager had made some attempt to make things right my oppinion of the restaraunt would be different.  This manager didn't even take the time to talk to me.  Maybe I wasn't spending enough.  Then, when I paid my bill the waitress forgot to scan my app for my rewards, (this happens almost everytime) even though I asked her too before she went to get my check.   The total for 2 adult meals and a childs meal was 76 dollars.  3 bucks for drinks and almost 20 bucks for the appetizer."
Noel P.,"Roseville, CA",147,169,573,4.0,10/13/2015,"This is a pretty decent place to meet anyone - large or small groups.  Their menu is varied from pizzas, salads, burgers, fish, steaks (including ribs), sandwiches, desserts.  They also have a large selection of craft beers and interesting cocktails and ciders.   I've been 2 times now - both times were work gatherings (thanks Boss!).  I would recommend getting a reservation particularly around peak hours (lunch & dinner).  This place is clean and welcoming.  The decor is charming and not too obnoxious - as I vaguely even remember it at all - so that must mean it wasn't distracting. Wait staff has always been very friendly, accommodating, and appropriately attentive. So far I've had the Asian Chicken Salad which was very good (from what I remember). It was large and very filling.  It had all the right proportions of greens, meats, extras - and the dressing was very nice. Yesterday I ordered the Fish 'n Chips. And I will say they are very good.  The dish came with probably 4 pieces of fish which was a nice plump white fish perfectly cooked. The batter was crispy and thin (the way I like it).  It was, however, salty and that could have been the tartar sauce - which I wasn't a big fan of since they tried to ""doctor"" it up.  Keep it simple folks!  I was impressed that it was served with Malt Vinegar - is there any other way to eat fish 'n chips?  Seriously??  The fries were wedge cut potatoes and very good! I would have like to have a small side of coleslaw - but the dish doesn't come with it - hmmm. Everyone at our table got something slightly different and it all looked good.  From the soup in the sourdough bread bowl, the artisan pizza, the fettuccine Alfredo, and burgers!  We also ordered a combination sample appetizer and it was very good.  There was some sort of avocado egg rolls (my favorite), hot artichoke dip, chips, breaded cheese sticks, and ? something else.  Everyone loved it! I would go back to any BJ's with confidence that the meal and experience will be wonderful. Note: I would never recommend going to a BJ's for an ""intimate"" dinner.  It's just too loud."
Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,617,3.0,2/17/2015,"I recently visited this BJ's location for the first time in a couple of years. Despite being fairly busy, we were greeted and seated rather quickly. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs, despite juggling several other guests. I'm not a big fan of the food here, but our meal wasn't too bad. I still prefer their desserts than their appetizers and meals. Overall, my experience here wasn't bad at all. I'm just giving this place a 3 out of 5 because I'm not impressed with their food."
Tom P.,"Vacaville, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/8/2017,"Very poor planning on management, over half the tables empty and a 30-45 min wait. If they can't figure out that people eat out on Friday nights time to replace some managers"
Vanessa P.,"Fairfield, CA",197,139,249,5.0,11/19/2015,"How can you not love BJ's?! The ambience is good, food is tasty and their drinks are amazing!  (Try their brussel sprouts! You won't be disappointed!!!)"
Lila C.,"San Francisco, CA",59,50,436,4.0,2/25/2016,They have very good salad!  The service is sweet and friendly.  Environment is cool and fun.
Jason N.,"Fairfield, CA",75,76,20,2.0,2/13/2016,Twice I have left here rather disappointed. This time I received my food rather burnt and dry to the point I had to send it back and asked that it be removed from my ticket. Once I do that I do not like to get food back from the kitchen so I am left in an awkward position of sharing food or just not eating. The waiter was apologetic and manager was kind enough to offer something to replace the meal since he didn't want me to continue to sit there in the awkward position. Not gonna ding the wait even though something should have been said to the cooks before my food was brought out to me. This latest screw up falls on the cooks in the kitchen...
Mel K.,"Fairfield, CA",36,26,4,1.0,6/9/2016,"I went here for a going away dinner for one of my soon-to-be deploying friends... It was a rather large group of maybe 15-20, we booked ahead... Service was terribly slow me the waitress kept disappearing. We sat at the table for an HOUR before our orders were taken... Then ANOTHER HOUR to get our food, which came out COLD. Midway between getting our food our waitress turned into a waiter. We couldn't even get WATER. At the end of it we all just asked for boxes and our checks... Which took another 30mins after the waiter/waitress kept coming out with one check at a time.  We asked to speak to the Manager who only made excuses for the poor service stating that we had a large table. At the end we all paid and left minimal tips... We didn't even ask for our Military discounts... Large groups + Service = HORRIBLE!!!"
Allyssa P.,"Elk Grove, CA",174,145,376,4.0,2/2/2016,"what do you have for dinner when you don't know what you want? BJ'S, they have a fairly good variety & great deals with their rewards program! my boyfriend & I stopped by on our way home from the city & were quickly seated. we were STARVING and started with the sliders. I then had the top sirloin for my entree with a side of cheddar mash potatoes and grilled asparagus. I've never had their sirloin & I wasn't expecting much but it was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. the mash potatoes have always been my favorite side dish but they tasted plastic-y & old and the grilled asparagus were unpleasantly charred.  our server was new and he did a fairly good job, I wish I remembered his name. lol BJ's is a stable for my boyfriend and I & we hardly expect much considering the one in our town gives awful service, so we were pretty happy with our late night dinner."
Tony S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,50,1,5.0,4/10/2017,"Great place, very good food, nice service.  Their happy hour features minimal choices, but they are tasty.  Pricey beers and pricey appetizers though.   Also, this place is usually packed on Fridays-Sunday, so exercise patience."
Lydia H.,"Dixon, CA",135,316,352,5.0,8/21/2015,Great place for a date night or get together with friends. Use their mobile ap to pay and get 20% off... good deal
Alex A.,"Fairfield, CA",54,2,1,1.0,7/1/2016,Found two random gift cards from Christmas and decided this night was the perfect nice to use it. Decided to get take out because the wait is always long. Didn't wait too long but when we looked at the food we saw this. I'll let the pictures speak for itself.
Karla M.,"Esparto, CA",0,5,,2.0,8/21/2017,I went on a Monday thinking it wasn't going to be too busy but it was. The wait time was pretty long. I ordered a pizza and I didn't even get a plate or cheese. The food was good but the service no so great.
Alyssa F.,"Vacaville, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/4/2016,"I've given BJs a shot multiple times simply for the fact that it's ""one of those"" restaurants that's a big chain so it must be decent. Each time I've gone the food has been sub par at best and overpriced. They take themselves way too seriously for such mediocre food. I ordered a burger and it was cold and dry with a tiny handful of soggy cold fries for tab that totaled $40.00. Bjs lost me as customer. Chilis is more consistent in the gross chain food race."
Mr. Critical W.,"Suisun City, CA",0,26,,1.0,11/7/2016,"I went today after watching way too many pizza reviews on YouTube by MUNCHIES.  That guy knows his stuff~! I made the mistake of trying ""deep dish"" pizza here as Mondays?  Likely because ALL of them are 1/2 price!  Woo-Hoo!  Oh, no.  Wait.  I had to have that offer triple verified and approved by a manager before honored?!!  Better read this first. I called at 11:05AM and the order time on my receipt says 11:08AM.  I ordered the Bacon Chicken Ranch and a BJ's Favorite, both well done.  The host said it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I gave them a little extra, due to ordering well done?  I got out of there, after waiting and paying a bit after 12 noon.   The chain is notorious for wait times.  Maybe they had to call Corporate to see if they were really 1/2 off/!! The cashier and few staff I met were chipper and friendly early into their work day on a slow Monday late morning.  Precious little parking which I guess was because all the staff took it. These pizzas are OBVIOUSLY PAN pizzas and nowhere NEAR  ""deep dish;"" FAIL!  One pizza was cooked well done, the other, absolutely NOT.  On both, the toppings started 2+"" in toward the center and the edges were rounded.  Deep dish, if anything folks.  You DO make food for a living, right?   The cheese on the underdone pizza, of course, was smarmy.  The dough on both were s.o.g.g.y., but much more, of course, on the under cooked one.   Toppings?  Folks, if you're going to LIST toppings, include them in a large enough amount to identify them.  It's like were afraid someone was going to be allergic to the non-meat toppings (onions, green peppers, tomatoes, etc), so they put only a 1/2 teaspoon of them on.  The pepperoni was wafer thin and NOT overwhelmingly tangy, so it is definitely a money saving measure.  The Italian sausage and seasoned chicken is frozen pizza grade [Ha!  You thought I was going to say ""quality?""!].  The small amount of seasoned tomatoes are simply strained from bruschetta , with the good oil/seasonings likely going into some other dish on the menu. The chicken was diced in hard bits...can we say left over makin's from the previous night?   The bacon was authentic, fried and diced up....not from a bag of Hormels/Costco Bacon bits and not dehydrated.  The few points earned are quickly lost by the complete absence of the touted hand-made house meatballs. I KNEW I'd done been had, when I braced me muscular arms for the heft of two, LARGE DEEP DISH pizzas and the boxes almost hit the ceiling, they were so... light...like, just lifting cardboard! Had I paid the full price of $25+ for each of these, they'd be sitting on the manager's desk right now.   I'm so put off that I won't fall for any other offerings even if they're 100% off Tuesdays."
Amber L.,"Fairfield, CA",21,34,,2.0,1/12/2017,"This place can be hit or miss.  I keep giving it another chance but it keeps disappointing me.  Over the holidays my family decided to celebrate my brothers birthday.  Service for drinks was slow but it was somewhat busy (not packed).  After we ordered it took forever to get our food.  Our waitress kept coming back telling us our food was almost up. Finally the food comes but they told my mother, who ordered ribs, they dropped her plate and they are making another ASAP. The entire table finished their meal.   My mother was very upset and just wanted to leave.  My husband talked to someone who said they would check on it. About 15 more mins go by and the ribs finally showed up.   The manager did comp the ribs.   This is just one of many examples of poor service.  I did give it two stars since once you finally get your food it's pretty good. That being said, I doubt I will be returning"
