Brittany R.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",2,9,1,1.0,11/20/2016,Worst experience ever. Leave it to bjs to ruin my friends birthday and a shitty waitress. But Angelo was great. He deserves a raise or a promotion or something.
Zac H.,"Napa, CA",0,17,1,4.0,2/22/2016,"Would have been a 5 star rating except water is a rare commodity here. If I have to ask for refill you are cutting into your tip and not doing your job Mr. Waiter. Thats being said the food had phenominal cosmoc powers and there was a LOT of it. The fish tacos are HUGE, the chips they came with were disappointing as they were still dripping with hot oil. Wife had a plate full of normal dry rub chicken wings but they were better than the crap wings at Buffalo Wild Wings. Finished up with the cookies n cream pazookie because we didnt go full retard on dinner. I will be going back for just the fish tacos. And the pazookie. And burying it all with their house stout. Good times.  It was crowded as hell on a friday night but a party of 2 doesnt wait long. I imagine the wait is worth it. Knew there was going to be a wait because we had to park by the Petco, but again totally OK by me. I had the pizzas here about 10 years ago but I'm not sure I can now ever get past the fish tacos. Go get 'em tiger."
Michelle L.,"Sacramento, CA",795,718,4372,3.0,5/28/2015,"Came to BJ's to watch the Warriors game and Happy Hour was until 7pm so that was a plus. Sat ourselves in the bar area near the big screen and the specials were great. $4 for BJ's craft beers (went with the hef), as well as the happy hour-sized version of the California Club Flatbread (x2), and boneless wings. $5 for BJ's mojitos (tried regular and wildberry). $6 for a mini deep dish pizza as well...and a pizookie, of course. Classic White Chocolate Macadamia Nut really hit the spot!  All of the food and drinks came out really quickly and everything tasted good. When the server had to take dinner break and have someone else take care of us, the transition was smooth. Overall a great deal, and decently located near the freeway."
Cesar P.,"Fairfield, CA",59,6,1,2.0,1/13/2017,Last night was a day to celebrate a birthday but BJ'S was a big disappointment. Not only was the food late but it didn't have that fresh taste. It definitely sat under the heating lamps in the kitchen for a while.     We had a 7:30 pm reservation and by the time we had all had our food served it was 9 pm. The waitress was trying her best to help but couldn't keep up with the various tables she was tending. If they were understaffed I'm sure they would understand if they were under payed by the customers.
Mary C.,"Vacaville, CA",22,1,,4.0,2/18/2017,"Great food and great service (this time). Went for dinner on a Friday night. I've been there other times with not so great service, but the waiter, Arthur, was awesome! I had the barbecue salmon at Arthur's suggestion and it was delicious! And a good amount for the price! Usually when you order salmon at a restaurant you get the skimpiest little fillet, but this had enough that I could take home leftovers! Everyone in my group was equally satisfied. (Didn't think to take pictures till afterword...)"
Holly R.,"Seaside, CA",54,9,7,4.0,2/17/2017,"We really like BJ's for lunch or early dinner. It gets a little too crowded for us around normal dinner time with the wait sometimes being over an hour. The calamari appetizer is tasty. The draft sodas are excellent. My favorite thing to get is the unlimited soup and salad. They also have the perfect, crispy shoestring fries. Always a dependable choice when you're looking for a consistently good meal."
Anne R.,"Hercules, CA",5000,829,322,3.0,3/3/2016,"Ive always been a fan of BJs because there food is decent, there service is decent, so much food and different drinks to choose from and fairly priced. I normally go the Concord location because it is closer to me but when I am in the Vacaville area I will come here. On a busy weekend there will be a wait but you get seated in less than 30 minutes if you have a smaller group. If you have a large group you might want to call ahead and make reservations to make sure you aren't waiting forever. The service here is relatively good but sometimes you do get the occasional crappy service who forgets to being utensils, enough napkins or even water to your table. The atmosphere is on the loud side, so don't come here if you want a romantic setting. If you could care less about a romantic setting, this is the place for you."
Rick N.,"Fairfield, CA",0,4,,1.0,7/29/2017,"This was a terrible experience , 7/24,  at BJs.     Sat for over 15 min before server came, food took half hour to come out , our drinks ran out and server didn't refill until she brought the change from the bill. food was not up to par for BJs, Whats happening to this place. I always get good service in the bar area , I forgot The both guy's names but Brian was one of the good servers.Not sure when or if I'll go back"
Gary R.,"Sausalito, CA",42,8,2,2.0,7/27/2015,"We arrived at about 6 pm on a Monday evening . We had to work our way up to the host/hostess stand as the restaurant was about 50 percent full but the staff was unable to keep up with the crowd arriving after work and so there was about a two minute wait for a table even though there were many tables clearly empty and ready for everyone waiting.  We told the hostess we would just sit at the bar, since we didn't want to wait.  When we walked to the bar it was about 80 percent full, but there were no seats available. The seats that were not occupied by paying customers were occupied by purses and people's legs, like at a busy airport terminal. The staff seemed to make no effort to accommodate new guests, even after we complained to the hostess.  We were seated at a table on the wall opposite the bar, on the other side of the restaurant. Our table was about eight inches from the table next to us. It felt like we were at a Japanese steakhouse.  When our server arrived we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome. We ordered two happy hour drinks but we were informed that happy hour was only in the bar area.  That is GARBAGE!  How can a restaurant charge more for the exact same drink just because you are sitting a couple feet too far from a half full unseatable bar area.  We expressed our frustration and we were told many customers say the same thing. Our appetizer was offered to the wrong table. Thankfully they said it wasn't theirs, so we eventually got it.  Our food arrived and after being auctioned off at the table it was very flavorful, albeit over cooked and dry.  We ordered wine and as it was delivered our server was apparently friends with people at the table next to us. So, after a minute of catching up, we got our server's proper attention. I really had wanted this to be a great experience. With the happy hour and the 'enlightened' menu, this could have been a regular restaurant for us. Unfortunately, this was a huge miss.  If we had seen a manager in our section, visiting tables and interacting with customers, instead of standing by the entrance to the kitchen or leaning against the hostess stand, maybe we could have addressed our concerns.  Management, I invite you to address my concerns and let me know if I should ever come back."
Courtney M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,6,,1.0,10/19/2016,"I have now had two terrible visits with this bjs.  Visit #1 First off, it took an entire 2 hours for us to get out of that place. Let me explain. There were only 2 of us and I was the only one that ordered an entree plate. We only got water my entre and then a pizzookie for each of us. It took 40 minutes for those 2 pizookis to come out after I was finished eating my panini. Not to mention this entire 40 mins our waitress only came out once about half way through to let us know it'll be up any sec... 20 mins is no where close to a few seconds! She did not communicate with us that the oven was down and that's why it took so long. We could have just passed on the pizookis!  Visit #2  We got seated right away in a hidden away table... the next 15 minutes we saw about 10 waiters and none of them even acknowledged us. Who knows where our waitress was??? Also this was on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy. Finally we decided to just get up and leave... we got much better service at outback steak house! As we walked out we let the front desk host people know we were leaving and the reason behind it. THEY JUST STARED AT US! no sorry or anything they just smiled and said okay. So good riddance to BJs! No lie I'll probably come back for the pizookis every now and then"
Samantha A.,"Suisun City, CA",0,17,1,1.0,3/25/2017,"Weve been seated for over an hour, still have not received our entrees, yet people who were sat after us have already eaten there entire meals and left yet here we are still sitting and waiting, with three kids! Its 8:40pm and my children are starving so are we but the service here is effing crap. Probably wont return, if your going to run an establishment at least do it correctly and be staffed more on hand, our waitress is really nice but that doesnt male up for this extremely long wait for food. The manager was also not helpful what so ever, at this point McDonalds wouldve been a better plan. If i could give NO stars I would. Thanks BJs for wasting our entire Saturday night =)"
Marissa D.,"Fairfield, CA",470,140,231,5.0,8/20/2015,"I've never left this place unsatisfied.  They have everything from juicy burgers to your favorite pasta dishes.  Definitely come hungry, because their portions are large and filling.  They also have a big portion of the menu dedicated to dishes 590 calories or under.  I usually find myself ordering from that section, and not even because I'm being calorie conscious, but because the food is so delicious!!  But watch out for their infamous pizookies!!  I've tried every single flavor, and thoroughly enjoyed every single bite.  Below is a list of a few of my favorites from here: Appetizers: Macaroni and cheese, Sriracha brussel sprouts Dishes: Lemon Thyme Chicken, sante fe salad, bacon cheeseburger Dessert: White macadamia nut pizzokie with vanilla ice cream   This is everyone's favorite go-to birthday dinner spot, because they accomodate nicely for big parties.  They also have a bar, and they're always broadcasting the major sporting events on their big screens throughout the entire venue.  No doubt I'll be back!"
Kati B.,"Salinas, CA",44,37,7,1.0,9/24/2016,"Food was good. Service was slow. Rude waitress ruined the whole thing. When a table full of uniformed military personnel ask for the military discount- do not roll your eyes and go complain to your manager. Also! Do not take a card in the midst of this, add random things to the tab- than the mil disc and ring up the customers card before they could even see their tab. Our bill went from $62 to $72. Thanks. No tip for you! Hope the hissy fit was worth it."
John S.,"Corona, CA",0,50,74,5.0,6/29/2017,I placed an order by phone app for pick up. I came in and paid for the order . Waited 20 minutes after I paid . My server and I reviewed my order of no cheese for a sandwich . I was in town on vacation . I trusted my order was right and left . The restaurant was very busy. I returned to my hotel and noticed my sandwich had extra cheese. I ate the sandwich without the bread . I immediately called and spoke to the manager who apologized and asked how he can make it right . I asked for a poozkie for my kids and without hesitation he said honored my request . The manager and server were very apologetic and professional. Both of them had great customer service and went beyond to ensure I was happy with the service and food. This location deserves a A+ for customer service today for their accountability of a snafu and making it right !
Patricia M.,"Vacaville, CA",85,7,1,5.0,1/11/2017,Great food and environment. Service was good as well. Our server did a great job making sure we had everything we needed.
Angelique. L.,"Antioch, CA",0,8,7,2.0,8/18/2016,"Although we had really good service from our waitress, our dessert to go was disappointing. Waiting almost 30 mins for our take out order left us wondering if they forgot or even put the order in. Then after getting home we opened the bag to an extremely burned cookie that wasn't even eatable due to taste and it being rock hard. Waste of time & money, such a bummer."
Amy M.,"Rio Vista, CA",5,192,,3.0,3/18/2016,"The first time we came here was back in December 2015 and we had a great experience.  After that, it was a hit or a miss.  What we have found consistently was staff forget the utensils.  On one visit, we sat at the table with the food going cold as we tried to catch the eye of a passing waiter -- anyone -- just to request utensils.  And when we finally find a waiter, he or she has to walk somewhere far ""back there"" to get one for us.  Yes, this would include when your dessert comes out, too.  Hmm.  Corporate needs to do a walk through on this location because there is obvious inefficiency. Oh, yes, the food.  No problem with the food.  Lots of choices.  Love the desserts.  Tried almost all of them so far.  And if you have a Rewards card, you can get some $$$ off (e.g. $10 off).  Anyway, we like BJ's, so we'll return, but the next time, if we don't get the utensils, it will reflect on the Tip."
Robert S.,"Shingletown, CA",97,31,28,5.0,7/29/2015,One of the best places to get a deep dish pizza. BJ's Favorite with add diced pepperoni and artichokes. Every BJ's that I've been and order the pizza I like has always been consistent. Stephanie M. Was our server and she was very polite and attentive.  For dessert I ordered the Strawberry Beignet and it was excellent. Definitely would order it again. Yummy!!
Dan R.,"Vacaville, CA",250,38,62,3.0,2/3/2016,"I gave BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse 3-stars because they offer a selection of healthy choices on the menu and wine is 1/2 price on Tuesday. However, I thought about giving them 2-stars because the overall dining experience is usually mediocre. During my last visit, there was heavy dust on the woodwork beside my table. I ordered a bottle of wine and it was delivered open with two glasses without being served. The honey sriracha brussel sprouts are usually crispy but they were not very crispy on this visit. I ordered a sirloin steak medium-rare and it was overcooked medium. I used a $25 gift certificate and it was deducted from my check but then it was added back in when I tried to pay with the mobile app. No one thanked us or said goodbye as we exited the restaurant. I do not expect fine dining at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse but they always seem to fall short in one way or another."
Gerben P.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/29/2017,Horrible experience. They didn't bring my friends order out. Manager came and gave us his unsincere apologies. Never going back to this one.
