Scott B.,"Vacaville, CA",2,28,1,5.0,8/31/2016,"Really good food, Midwestern comfort food at its best.  The beans rock!  Take out is quick and efficient, car-side.  Professional staff, good service, busy place!"
Sherry K.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",5,13,2,1.0,3/13/2017,"Total disaster. Somewhat busy Thursday night last week, 2 adults and 2 children.  About 20 minutes to get water/drinks then placed order.  All food orders were incorrect when arrived and sent all 4 meals back.  One hour later second version arrived, one was not edible.  Three of us ate, fourth person waited 20 minutes for drink refill.  Server said he was sorry but he apparently wasn't checking orders before they were sent to table.  After third no show of server and given the food mess ups I finally asked for Manager.   That night's manager arrived at table, said he would not charge us but NOT ONCE did he ever apologize for our two hour waste of time.  It is not about the money for me, its about an apology and ""please give us a second chance"".  This manager needs to go.  Tried the BJ's in Concord 4 nights later and its hard to believe the two are the same brand, totally different experience.  Will never return to Vacaville B J's again!   General manager was not there and night manager spent maybe 20 seconds at our table, he was obviously not interested."
Heather H.,"Winters, CA",0,7,,4.0,6/14/2017,"We had a party of 10 and were seated promptly at our reservation time of 7pm.  I'll make this short but sweet - the food was good, not the best I ever had, but good.  The waitress was even better.  We loved having Janette as our waitress.  She was extremely attentive and met all of our needs and then some.  I was very happy to give her an extra tip.  I wish more waiters and waitresses were like Janette!"
Shannon V.,"Fairfield, CA",76,90,23,1.0,11/5/2016,"Came here tonight with my boyfriend to eat and watch the Nebraska game which is On Abc. A prime channel which does Not get overlapped lol. Wont be coming back because weve been here over 20 mins bothering our poor server gentleman to just be able to watch the game! Sad customer service.  The manager wouldn't even come over and apologize or say anything to the customers that have been asking for a certain game. My boyfriend couldn't even enjoy his evening because of this bs. The food was good, but the lack of even trying to let us watch the game was remarkable. The service from the server was very good! He was very nice. It wasn't his fault!"
Maile T.,"Fairfield, CA",96,38,74,4.0,4/3/2016,"Updating my review and a lot has changed. Service has gotten a lot better and the waiting game to be seated isn't too bad either. Other than that, the food is delicious!"
Tricia L.,"Chico, CA",2,95,79,1.0,10/1/2016,"Saturday night seems like a bad idea to go here, at least tonight October 1st. They're either short staffed waitstaff or short staffed in the kitchen."
Mark A.,"Vacaville, CA",5,6,1,5.0,7/24/2016,"When it comes to eating a delicious meal, go to this restaurant chain! If you do not know what to order, just go with the avocado egg roll appetizer and for the main course, order the bjs favorite pizza. The service is reasonable but there is an app that can be downloaded to order in advance. All in all, I am happy with this restaurant chain and highly recommend it!"
Kim D.,"Fairfield, CA",761,337,2691,4.0,11/10/2013,"Good place to hit up in Vacaville if you're meeting a group of friends or wanna grab a bite/drink. My old friends and I always go here for get-togethers on the weekends or just to catch up with each other and eat pizookies!  Pizookies, pizza, and beer are definitely the must-haves at this restaurant. Before you even decide on what entree you want, make sure to save a menu and not eat too much to the point where you're too full for dessert.. cause believe me, you'll totally regret it when you see other tables around you indulging in all the different types of pizookies. From red velvet, to raspberry white chocolate almond, to Ghiradelli's triple chocolate, to even gluten-free chocolate chip! Okay, but forreal besides pizookies, BJ's offers a wide variety of options for appetizers and entrees. Almost so many that it's hard to decide.  Our favorite appetizers to order are the fried calamari and the avocado egg rolls. If you can't choose, try out their sampler appetizer (avocado egg rolls, santa fe spring rolls, spinach & artichoke dip, and mozzarella sticks)! As for the main meal, if you're with a group, a good choice would be trying out one of their pizzas like the classic great white (chicken alfredo) or the bbq chicken. They also let you order half of one and half of another type if there's two toppings that you want, instead of having to order 2 pizzas which is great. There are also flatbread pizza appetizers, delicious burgers, and lots of low-calorie 'enlightened' options that are still quite flavorful such as the bbq bison burger and hawaiian mahi-mahi over pineapple fried rice. Yum!"
Gary F.,"Walnut Creek, CA",11,90,18,2.0,9/21/2016,"Slowwwwww service... Every time I go, I forget how slow it is. And everything is high calorie content .."
Lyndsay S.,"San Diego, CA",40,175,38,1.0,2/20/2016,"Great variety, hit or miss service (mostly miss for the service I encountered on my last visit).  It took forever, they got my order wrong twice, and our appetizer never arrived.  We did get management to take off that part, but when it came time to use my reward points it was damn near impossible.  Our waitress was too busy trying to flirt and look cute to pay any attention to our drinks, and well, she clearly didn't like her job or us.  It was one of the few times I haven't left a tip in my life.  She clearly didn't earn it.  Haven't been back since this visit 6-7 months ago because it was so bad.  And they weren't even busy that night."
Alene H.,"San Pablo, CA",0,15,,5.0,8/17/2016,Customer service was great! We had a slight mishap and the manager on duty Thomas was right there. He made us feel special. Thank you Thomas!
Dee A.,"Richmond, CA",0,7,,2.0,7/26/2016,"Went in around 12 on a Monday and the place was crowded. Our waitress was nice, but the food was horrible. My lady ordered the ribeye steak meal and the steak has the taste of strong charbroile all the way through it, also her broccoli she ordered was raw, not cold, not undecooked but straight RAW. After showing and asking a random waiter to get her steamed like broccoli, we ate our meals only for the broccoli to never show up. I also ordered buffalo wings only for them to come with old, wilted, unpleasant looking celery."
Kai-Rey L.,"Los Altos, CA",3,47,,2.0,12/5/2015,"Average food, ridiculous pricing relative to what you are getting, decent beer, really slow service.  There isn't really much to say other than this Bj's is like every other one you have been to... The food honestly isn't bad as long as you stick to easy dishes (pizza, pasta, burgers) when you begin to venture into ahi tuna salad/jambalaya territory you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  The waiter was nice, but the service was just really slow... the kitchen must not be organized very well because it took close to 1 hour for food to finally come out from the time we put in our orders.  You can find much better value for your dollar else where, but if you are lazy and don't mind getting ripped off purchasing average food be my guest.  Pizzokies/Beer are really one of the only reasons to come."
Thomas D.,"San Rafael, CA",60,15,,3.0,8/28/2016,"Reliably OK, never great or terrible."
Jeff P.,"Vacaville, CA",405,341,250,4.0,1/24/2016,Their food is really good here wish my diet wasn't so strict or I would open up and eat and try a lot of their various dishes
Savy B.,"Fairfield, CA",2,64,7,2.0,2/25/2017,"So the only reason I gave 2 stars is because our waitress, Mona (Ramona, I think). She was amazing & definitely deserves a raise or something! We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. When the hostess took us to our table, she picked up a highchair on the way for our 1 year old that was covered in broccoli from the last child that used it...she walked away before I could ask her to wipe it down. I mean, shouldn't it be MANDATORY that the highchairs are scrubbed after each child uses it?? Those things get filthy after one use! Anyway, no one even acknowledged us for over 20 minutes as we sat there. I finally waved down a random person, who happened to be Mona, who's section was clear on the other side of the restaurant, but offered to wait on us anyway! She was on top of everything, very friendly, & even had her manager take off our appetizer for our inconvenience. Her service definitely deserves 5 stars, but I'm rating the entire restaurant as a whole. The food was mediocre (except for the potstickers, they are always delicious!) & expensive. All of the surrounding patrons looked annoyed & all the employees looked uninterested & bored, even with a packed restaurant. I've been coming to this BJ's for years & it has truly gone downhill. I definitely recommend NOT going during prime times."
Mariah C.,"Fairfield, CA",173,10,24,5.0,10/17/2016,"I went to lunch with my grandma and we loved the calamari and the ahi poke! I ordered the endless soup and salad and she had a hot ham and cheese lunch sandwich. Our server Jason was great as well! I really liked that before he split checks for his big party he asked the rest of his tables if we needed anything before he disappeared for a while. Awesome service, thanks Jason C!"
Dillan A.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",35,22,9,5.0,7/18/2015,"I love BJ Great food and great customer service, Me and my family on the way to San Francisco we stop by PJ in Vacaville what was a good choice The waiter was very nice and very helpful and they have a great customer service five star"
Kasey R.,"Sonoma, CA",143,22,4,1.0,8/17/2017,"Absolutely disgusting food. I'm sorry, I hate to be rude, but if you're going to microwave the food at least heat it up all the way. I got chicken gyozas to start and they were ice cold, fresh out of the freezer, on the bottom. Ick. And then I got the quinoa bowl with shrimps and I won't be surprised if I get food poisoning from that. The shrimps looked hardly edible and the dish had horrible flavor. There were chunks of tomatoes that came straight from a can. Gross. The food is just awful. And then I saw on yelp that a lot of other people experienced cold food. No surprise. They should really get that microwave fixed. The service was also terrible to. I was there by myself and I also work at a restaurant so I'm very patient and kind to any staff member, my waitress was RUDE. It took five minutes to even be acknowledged by any hostess and she finally came over and just said ""opening seating over there"" and then threw my menu on the table. I never got offered water, never asked how my food was, and didn't even say anything when she dropped the bill. Also took 45 minutes for my food to come out of the microwave, nobody else was in there. Horrible establishment. Don't ever go here"
