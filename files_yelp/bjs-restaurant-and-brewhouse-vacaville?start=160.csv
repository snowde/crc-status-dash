Dee A.,"Little Falls, NJ",4,83,13,2.0,8/31/2016,"Food at BJs is always good. Service was slow. Sat at the bar and the bartender seemed miserable. Guys that sat after me were getting their food before me. The bartender had to feel me trying to get her attention but she just ignored me, finally I flagged down a server that was clearly annoyed but did help me get my food. The restaurant was not busy there is no reason for 45 min ticket times. I order the Poke... How long does it take for RAW FISH? Even after the server served me, the bartender never acknowledged that my food was delayed or that I had to ask someone else to get it. I normally tip 15% for mediocre service but I couldn't bring myself to do it... 10%. Disappointed and not coming back."
Brenae T.,"Fairfield, CA",172,7,10,4.0,10/3/2016,Pretty much the regular spot where I can get what my heart desires. I love that they have a broad menu of different types of food so it can fit whatever mood I'm in to eat. Great spot for drinks and to watch the games.
Manny B.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,7,,1.0,9/2/2016,"Everytime we order curb side, the order is wrong.  I literally only asked for blue cheese, lettuce, and tomato and they cannot handle it. There are only 4 components on the burger and they always mess up one of them.  I called and asked to talk to the manager at 1130 pm sept 2nd and was told he was too busy to talk to us.  Done with this place, not worth $13 a burger."
Davon F.,"Vallejo, CA",59,98,55,3.0,10/1/2015,Normally I love this place from the food to the service. However we came today for a birthday and told them twice and they never came to my table sang or gave a free dessert. It was almost empty while we were there so it's not like it was super busy. This was huge disappointment. But I will suggest getting the avocado egg rolls and the chicken Crusted parmesan. The Mediterranean pizza is a great choice as well.
Michele S.,"Vacaville, CA",169,84,2,3.0,9/1/2016,"The food is really good, but I've been here a handful of times and only one of those times did I have a good experience with the service. One time when we went we were waiting for 30 minutes to be seated when there were several tables open, that just hadn't been cleaned of from the previous diners. It's not somewhere I ever choose to go when I am deciding on where to eat, the service is just too lack luster especially for the price you are paying."
Taylor H.,"Tucson, AZ",156,4,7,1.0,3/1/2017,"Been twice in the last two weeks, won't be returning. My husband and I decided to go out to eat last minute on Valentine's Day. I called BJ's to check the call ahead seating wait - we were told 30 minutes and put our name on. When we got there (within the 30 min) we were told it would be another 30 minutes.... so what's the point of call ahead seating?? Luckily, a table opened up in the bar area and we took that (no waiting for bar).  My food was good (Parmesan crusted chicken), my husband ordered a steak and it was flavorless. Our waitress forgot to apply a coupon we had, but we brushed it off because we knew she was busy. We returned the next week with a friend and the whole experience was bad.  When our hostess sat us, I asked her what the happy hour hours were. She informed us we couldn't order happy hour in the main dining area, only in the bar area. I said that's fine, but I'd like to know the hours. She says, ""Well I'm under 21 so I don't know.""  .............. WHAT????? You work here, it's your job to know that. That's the dumbest answer I've ever heard. When our waitress came I asked her what the happy hours were, she said she didn't know. Again, I was stunned at people not knowing their job. I asked her to find out so she goes over to the bar area and comes back to let us know. Do the employees really not know what they're doing, or are they trained to say ""I don't know"" so people are discouraged from walking up to the bar and bringing it to the table for the happy hour price? (We also tried to sit in the bar area to get happy hour price but no tables were open.)  Throughout our time there, the waitress wasn't attentive, she kept disappearing, we had to always ask for our drinks to be refilled, and everything took a long time, we were there for quite a while. My food came out over cooked.  I asked the waitress if that was standard (I knew it wasn't). She responds with, well it really just depends on who the cook is each night.  I sent it back and when she brought it back, it wasn't right again. The manager came over to speak with me and I asked if there was a standard way to cook things. He told me the food gets prepped earlier in the day and maybe it's gotten messed up by now. I told him I won't order that item again (Parmesan crusted chicken) because I don't want to play the guessing game of how it's going to come out. He took my meal off of our ticket which I was grateful for, but the experience as a whole has turned me off from this restaurant."
Geraldine S.,"Chicago, IL",77,61,90,2.0,7/2/2014,"I was trying to find a place to eat with my mom and my boyfriend and none of us could make up our minds. General consensus was let's go somewhere where they have it all! BJs is exactly that.  There's the usual pizza (deep dish is a must), sandwiches, pasta, salads, tons of small plates and you can't forget their famous pizookie! We ordered a Mediterrean pizza, some wings and Santa Fe spring rolls. Wings were a little too crispy but still good, Pizza was delicious.  My main complaint was the service. We were seated promptly, however our waiter was a bit too pushy, We all felt rushed eating our meal. I understand being attentive to customers but if you see them having a conversation don't keep coming over with questions or ask if we need the check. Even after telling her we needed some time she kept coming over!! Totally ruined my experience, after the great food all we could remember was how unpleasant our waiter was..."
Donato J.,"Pittsburg, CA",18,181,125,3.0,12/19/2014,"Staff was nice, but service was slow: i was barely checked on and had to wait for water. Waitress literally came around and asked ""how is everything"" even though we didn't have any food on the table yet. She caught her mistake and said ""oh... the food should be out shortly."" I thought the menu had a lot of unique items and we were excited about the idea of trying unique types of foods. However, the results were also disappointing. I can't say that the food was particularly delicious. The ""lasagna deep dish"" was basically a big ravioli and was one of the nastiest things I've had. We also tried their carnitas french fries... the fries were okay but the mix of the two didn't work for me. We also tried the stuffed avocados which were good just because they were avocados and everything is great with it. But I probably won't order it again.  Chicken wings were pretty good and were probably the best thing of the 4 we ordered. however, I'm not sure it's enough of a reason to come back."
Cortney H.,"Fairfield, CA",73,44,12,4.0,7/28/2016,"Taylor was an awesome server, he was in a, and I quote, ""magnificent"" mood and it showed! My deep dish Ziti was amazing and my boyfriend loved his cherry glazed salmon. Its a bit expensive but we will be back!"
Lizzy G.,"Oakland, CA",0,145,14,4.0,12/7/2015,"The kid and I stopped here for a late Sunday lunch. I wanted soup and maybe salad, while he's a pizza/burger/chicken tenders kid. The place was packed but we were seated quickly. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and helpful--everything I look for in wait staff.  My kid loved his pizza and orange cream float. My chicken tortilla soup was great. I liked the Brussels sprouts, but they were on the salty side since they're tossed with some sort of seasoning.  It's a bit expensive for a regular lunch place, but I'll definitely go back! All-in-all, a positive experience."
Lisa W.,"Oregon City, OR",13,37,,2.0,9/5/2015,"My husband and I went in for a few beers and a snack at about nine PM tonight and sat in the bar side.  The service was very slow taking our drink order and getting out drinks.  When the drinks did arrive - a Red Ale and the Temple of Stone IPA - they were quite flat - especially the IPA.  My husband pointed this out to the server and his observations were blown off by the server.  As we drank our flat beer - we noticed that the beer was leaving film marks on the side of the pint glass.  This is a sure sign that the glassware washer is not set up right or the restaurant is using cheap soap/rinse agent. We ordered wings and then we ordered a Lagunitas IPA and a glass of water (my husband switched to water since he was annoyed at the beer).  This was the third ""flat"" beer they served us! So my husband asked to see the duty manager - he checked the beers and confirmed that the CO2 was off for the Red Ale and the Lagunitas - and he said the Temple of Stone keg was off and he was going to call the distributor in the morning.  He replaced the Lagunitas with one poured with the correctly adjusted CO2 - but this place is far from a ""brew house"" since we ended up being served three out of three beers with the wrong level of CO2 and in poorly washed glassware."
Erik S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",5,15,1,3.0,7/3/2016,"Oh BJ's... How I have a love hate relationship with this establishment.  Food is good.  I've only have 2 times out of the hundred where I had an issue with the food. The service is usually the issue.  It seems like they don't understand the concept of what an appetizer is.  Appetizers come BEFORE the main meal.  I thought ordered an app before I even ordered my food and drinks was an indication of that.  I don't know who's fault that is, either the server or the chef, but it is very frustrating.  My wife and I have given up ordering appetizers from there anymore since the food comes out before it, or they just forget it."
A G.,"Vacaville, CA",1,39,,1.0,1/30/2017,"My husband chose BJ's to celebrate his birthday with our family. We arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately which was great. We told the hostess at the front counter and the gentleman that seated us that it was my husband's birthday and we also told the waiter when we were placing the order.  The waiter took our drink and appetizer orders right away and our meal orders five minutes later. He brought our drinks quickly and then that's pretty much the end of any kind of attentive service. Our drinks were dry most of the time and we had to keep flagging him down to get him to refill them. One of the times I asked for a refill and he came back 20 minutes later and asked us if we wanted any more drinks and I had to remind him of my original request. This was the least of the problem. It was 50 minutes later and they brought my husband's side salad but no appetizers had shown up so I asked him to look into it. Another 10 minutes passed and the appetizers showed up. The calamari was overcooked and the chicken potstickers were flat out cold. He apologized and said he would have them redo them. We were there for over an hour before our dinner showed up. I had ordered a Cobb salad and took one bite and the lettuce was so limp and soggy it was slimy. I sent that back and asked them to take it off the bill. An hour and a half after we were seated, two waiters showed up with all three of our appetizers again but looked at the table and asked if we had already had our appetizers. I explained that we had sent back the potstickers but at this late hour I would like them removed from the bill. At 645 we placed orders for Pizookies thinking we would get ahead of the game. At 7:15 another server showed up with another order of calamari. Are you kidding me? At 7:20 dessert showed up. The cookies are much thinner than I remember and it was like mining for cookies trying to get them out of the pan. Still delicious but much skimpier. The entire dinner took over two hours for four of us. As I watched my husband order dessert, I realized that there had been no acknowledgment of his birthday nor anything done about it. They told me at the door leaving that normally they do a small pizooki. It wouldn't have done any good to say anything at that point because our server was pretty much nonexistent throughout the meal unless we flagged him down. It wasn't until I was reviewing the bill that we realized the french fries my son ordered were never delivered either.  My kids love the dessert but my husband and I will be hard-pressed to return to this restaurant. It was a complete disappointment. I came home and had to look for something for dinner."
Priscilla R.,"Vallejo, CA",3,34,,1.0,7/3/2016,Ordered curbside for lunch to save some time and it took 20 minutes for them to ring me up. Why do they have only one person at the register during lunch time? Never again.
Alexis M.,"Fairfield, CA",1,33,19,2.0,7/15/2016,"My biggest mistake is trusting restaurants and their steaks... I ask for the medium well sirloin and they come out with a steak so tough they might as well have brought out a rubber tire on a plate. Not to mention how dry it was. I waited for the server to come back and check up on the food and how it all is so in the meantime I try my best to enjoy the food. The server walks back and forth, waiting on the other tables, not even looking our way. After my fiancé finished his plate clean, the server decides to finally come over and check up. ""How was everything? Did you want me to take anything out your way?"" I responded saying, ""yeah well the steak was really dry..."" He had the nerve to say, ""oh what? You should have told me! We could have done something about it."" Really...?  it's whatever. At least the pizookies are good. I guess."
Sybille R.,"Oakland, CA",10,58,28,2.0,5/30/2015,"I went there yesterday with my husband and was very disappointed. I was there a few times before with family and it was always good and fairly easy to find options as a pescetarian. Now since I transitioned to being vegan I was curious to see what I can eat there. Honestly, besides fries and a few other sides nothing (unless I do the ""and can I get this salad without cheese?"" or ""can you leave the chicken off the salad?"") Restaurants like BJ's need to put much more variety on their menu! It's a 20 pages long menu, but I couldn't find a single clearly vegan main dish. Please cater to a wider population than just the meat-eaters and cheese-addicts and mayo lovers! The service from the waitress itself was good, that's why I give two stars. Of course she was clueless on questions like if the pizza dough is vegan and what ingredients the frying batter contains. Unless they change some things on the menu, I will stay out of here."
Hannah B.,"Vallejo, CA",6,2,,1.0,6/19/2016,"Wait time is ridiculous,  we were told we couldn't make reservations but here they are giving others an opportunity to reserve a seat ahead of time"
Kat S.,"American Canyon, CA",43,129,647,5.0,4/12/2016,"Once again.delicious food..I do not know why.

Jacqueline J.,"San Francisco, CA",173,117,553,4.0,4/3/2016,One of the best Bjs I've been too. The appetizer ahi poki was perfect and the Brussels sprouts salad was perfect. The food was delicious and our waiter Zach was really on it and made sure we got everything we needed and was satisfied. If I'm in the area I will be back to eat here.
Ashley T.,"Vacaville, CA",2,15,1,2.0,3/17/2016,"When BJ's first opened in Vacaville it was one of my favorite restaurants. The beer and pizooki's are amazing! However, they don't seem to take the same care and preparation in their food anymore. One visit our pizza dough was still raw. Recently my boyfriend and I went for just appetizers and beer. The avocado egg rolls were barely warm on the inside, the boneless chicken looked and tasted like flat chicken nuggets dipped in sauce and then microwaved, and our sauce cups were half full. It took about 10 minutes before we received more sauce and by then we were grossed out with our food. Like I said...the beer is good."
