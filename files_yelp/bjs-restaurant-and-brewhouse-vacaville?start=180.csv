Christie Lynn D.,"Vacaville, CA",182,34,1,5.0,3/24/2016,"Sally and Devin were totally awesome and did a tremendous job.  Definitely our fav place to visit and to enjoy the great service and food.  Excellent coffee, too.  Thx!!"
Shay W.,"Upland, CA",9,29,8,4.0,11/12/2015,"I placed an online order tonight for curbside pickup. Custom pizza with cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms, pepperoni, and chicken sausage. Everything seemed well until I got home and discovered there was no cheese on the pizza. It also had stray onions on the pizza which I am allergic to. I don't order out often and decided to go with a more high end pizzeria that costs more thinking that I would get better quality. This is unacceptable BJ's.  L. B. Update: I called to speak with the manager and my order was replaced. The pizza itself was good. However, instead of the chicken sausage, I had regular sausage. Also, I did find an onion on my slice I was eating. Overall, the quality was good and I feel the management did make a sincere effort to correct the problem. And they did ask me to check it before I left (I had curbside, it was dark outside and I did not have time to wait for a new one). Still not five stars because of the inaccuracies, but we'll call this one even.  L.B."
Damian S.,"Memphis, TN",0,19,,5.0,7/11/2016,"Good food and drinks of all kinds..  Tv's beer and good times. The seating is great for sporting events, and large parties.."
Lala K.,"Honolulu, HI",318,178,727,4.0,6/5/2014,"Once again their Bloody Mary was awesome... Awesome just like our server, Antonio. He was friendly, attentive, and would check up on is periodically. We didn't have to wait too long for our food. Im fact the timing was perfect between our appetizers and main meal. I love the fact that they can accommodate large parties and this restaurant is kid friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to any one in the area looking for a place to eat!"
May A.,"Roseville, CA",718,939,13962,2.0,3/4/2012,"waaay too many people! Came here on a Saturday evening... never again! The wait ended up to be almost an hour-and-a-half long! We were given a time frame of 35-40 minutes... so we waited that long but still not yet called when came time...  we figured having waited that long already that our name would be called sooner or later... it ended up much later. Well, we were finally seated after over an hour! wow! never ever had to wait that long at any restaurant. Anyway, I think even people who called in for reservations had a bit of a wait... not good time management. Anyway, I had the grilled pork chops... I had this meal before in the Roseville location and it was delicious! This restaurant was smaller than the one in Roseville... full house! This is only my second time eating at a BJ's restaurant... my husband's first. He looked at the menu and said ""wow! this menu is like a Bible!"" LoL! Review #0074"
Ahman M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,44,10,1.0,11/11/2015,"So this was the 1st time I walked into BJ's since it came to Vacaville and what happened blew my mind. So let me tell you. A friend had come to town and we decided on BJ's and we got in, in 5 mins which tells you that it was not that busy and NO while we were seated there was no line at the door and seats still open. So we got service and she took my drink order and said she'd come back for my food order. She brought my drinks fast and took our order, that was the last thing that went right.  I order coffee, no spoon to stir my coffee, common sense, right? So I asked for a spoon and we waited, 10 mins later no spoon, She comes back and it's been 10 mins more and no spoon and no silverware. WOW right? Nope, she comes back 10 mins later to say she will see where our order is, 10 mins later it finally comes. She puts it down and leaves. Guess what? No silverware. So I have eaten already and ordered dessert ( Not that good) and my friend ordered a stake med/well, well we got med/rare and we were not happy. Did I mention it took another 5 to bring silverware. By the time she brought the silverware she just asks me do I need a spoon for coffee.  Now, we are mad and ask for the manager and got a supervisor. And he was pleasant, but didn't offer ANY suggestions on how to rectify the issue. My friend was pissed and I was not having any of it. I said I'll pay for the drinks and my dessert and we left. Pissed. So I took her to Freebirds and she loved it. 5 STARS! for them. Over all we almost spent a whole hour waiting for food and bad service. My friend has been to BJ's before and said this wasn't the normal. On the other hand, my 1st impression was horrible. So I guess it will be years before I go again. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. Good service is good service, i'm not harsh unless you make me."
Colin C.,"Alexandria, VA",195,573,10,4.0,2/26/2015,"For a chain I'm a big fan. Keep in mind that it's nothing super unique and more like Cheesecake Factory than anything else. Along those lines, it has a huge menu but focuses on pizza and burgers which I like. They have some entrees of course but they aren't trying to do every single type of food out there.  The place is very large and can accommodate large parties well, but does get busy. Servers are good and the prices are pretty standard.  They have a large bar and a ton of beer on tap. They even have their own brews and can do flights and pitchers of all the different types they make.  Food-wise the pizza was great with tons of different types and sizes all the way down to mini. The apps were great too, stuffed mushrooms and all the different fried ones were cooked very well."
Maniacal N.,"San Jose, CA",49,66,1,3.0,5/10/2015,"They actually forgot the pizza sauce on my pizza.  I was like... ""seriously?"" The waiter offered me a free dessert but that wasn't good enough so I talked to manager on duty and he gave me the pizza for free (like he should!)."
Jack W.,"Alameda, CA",50,24,,3.0,7/27/2015,"I used to frequent the BJ's in San Mateo, and when my job took me to Concord I knew what to expect - meh. The food is mostly hit and miss, and the beer is fine, and make the most of the half-price wine on Tuesday.  Try the Turkey Club (not on the menu any more, but they will make it), you can't miss with burger, but the fries and almost always over cooked, or cold.  What makes it work for me is the service, in particular at the bar where I'll sit for lunch. Natalie is a great hostess behind the bar, and makes up for any of the food shortcomings."
Ralph A.,"Oakland, CA",0,48,4,4.0,4/8/2017,"BJ's continues to amaze us with both the high quality food and abundant choices. Easy parking and easy on and off the freeway are also pluses. At this visit, however, we received way less than their usual service from their waitperson --Heather. She was slow, totally inattententive and her poor service really affected our meal. After working thru our entree's about 1/2 way, we were finally able to attract her attention to request the status of our missing appetizers. She disappeared and did not return with any status. They finally showed up about 10 mins after and we had finished our entries. We had to again ""find"" heather to request a coffee fill up. She never did check in how we were doing or if we needed anything although she passed by on several occasions. It was impossible to attract her attention. Obtaining the bill resulted in the same delay. She was not observant and appeared ""non-caring"". In all honesty this is not the usual for BJ's as we usually receive top notch service from all the wait staff coupled with awesome food and beverages. Heather does not meet their standards of customer service (not anybodies). We will be back but hope not to ever be in this persons section again. BJ's lost a star from this person poor service."
Rukhsana M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,1,4.0,11/29/2016,For being busy I would say our server did ger best. She had a lot of tables. We walked in on a Monday evening around 5:50pm and it was not too busy. By the time we got our appetizer....more people started coming in. For being a Monday night it was very busy by the time we got out dinner. I would give it a 5 star...but the New Orleans Jumbalaya was not good and just seemed to be too much seasoning and cooked to fast and not all the way.
Alex A.,"Vacaville, CA",37,22,19,2.0,1/1/2016,"BJ's in Vacaville is definitely going downhill. Slow service, pizza was luke warm, took forever to get salads, french fries had been sitting out for awhile before coming to the table, and there was a long disgusting hair baked into my bbq chicken pizza. This has definitely been the worst so far, but starting to become the norm when we visit. Too bad!"
Sharman B.,"Fairfield, CA",25,30,17,5.0,4/1/2016,"Excellent food and great choices; the menu is as thick as a book. I love their craft brews and their appetizers are great too. Most of the times I'm there it's crowded, but it's worth the wait. Pastas, salads, pizzas, and more to your heart's content."
Chris W.,"Lake Merritt, Oakland, CA",325,6,1,5.0,4/23/2016,"So I usually don't write reviews, but I was eating here a few nights ago with my kiddos (great food by the way) but anyways I left my wallet behind! So I'm walking away talking about how a love affair actually caused the economy crash with my wife, and this girl named Jenna runs up with my wallet! Thank the dear Lordy in heaven for this young lady! I offer her a thanks of 20 bucks, and she turns it down saying ""anyone would have done the same."" Real life saver this girl. Thank you!"
Kristine G.,"Vacaville, CA",76,34,13,5.0,5/19/2015,"My family's 3rd time eating brunch here at BJs.  We raved about it to my brother, sis-in-law and parents so they decided to join us today for brunch.   FIRST IMPRESSION:  opens at 10am.  We got there by 10:05 and seated by 10:10.  Perfect!  No wait at all.  Mike, our waiter was pleasant with greeting us and taking our drink orders.  Drinks came out fast and we got to place our orders (we were a party of 10, 7 adults and 3 kids).  We waited 45 minutes for our food!  Family (6 adults) next to us, who was seated AFTER us, got their food and finished their meal before we even got ours.  My hubby had to hunt down a waiter (just a random one as we didn't see mike again after he took our order) to let them know we were still waiting for our food.  DISLIKES:  my two boys finished their orange juice and my hubby and mom finished their coffees and we HAD TO FIND our waiter to ask for refills.  Didn't like that he didn't come by to check up on us while we were waiting for food....or to give a little courtesy update as to why food was taking so long.   LIKES:  as soon as my hubby brought it to another waiters attention (and then mike walked by my hubby and the other waiter so he got to hear from my hubby as well) our food came out within a matter of 10 min.  The manager, Jacob, came out and apologized to the table.  He apologized for the long wait and proceeded to explain to us that there were troubles in the kitchen area.  Our meals were complimentary since we had to wait for so long.  I appreciate a restaurant who takes the time to apologize to their customers and make it up to them as well WITHOUT asking us, what we want them to do for us.  Thank you Jacob for taking care of us!   I still give this company a 5 star rating because this is the only time after years of going to this establishment that we had this kind of service today.  The food was still excellent, and Jacob redeemed their customer service.  A few months ago, we celebrated my husbands birthday dinner here with a few friends and family and the staff was very accommodating to my needs and requests.  Still worth my time returning here."
Carmik T.,"Gilbert, AZ",67,382,737,4.0,3/30/2015,"Called ahead to let them know we had a party of 17 coming about 6PM. They don't take reservations?? It's on a ""first come : first serve bases"". So that means when you arrive your added then to the list & that is when your wait time starts. A few in our party got there prior to 6PM and so our wait time was only about 25 minutes: not to bad.  Seemed the staff were very good at quickly getting our tables together & accommodating our large party.  Our service was very good. Amanda was our main server ""excellent"" and all the employees that assisted along with her did a wonderful job in getting our drink orders & food to the table in a timely manner. Only one complaint that was had was a Porter beer that was forgotten & that same patron had a meal with room temp ( kinda cold) fries. That was quickly made up for by bringing her beer out promptly & a side order of fresh hot fries! BJ's Restaurants & Brew House's have so much of a variety of food to choose from on their menu & service at all the locations we've been to- has always been great. Seems they know how to train their service staff well too! BTW- would have given them 5 stars, but with the ""call ahead"" situation & the hospitality member ( male) we spoke with -not explaining to us their reservation policy/ requirements ( parties up to 6?) was super confusing!! Also, by ""he"" not handling or wanting to work with our request, that's why we rated it a 4. It all did work out- but this issue maybe something to address & resolved in the future with BJ's Corporate or Management possibly? Large parties generally bring in large $dollars$!!"
Cindy M.,"Santa Cruz, CA",688,437,34,2.0,8/22/2013,"Service has gotten much worse since the last time I came here. I went to BJ's yesterday night and was practically ignored by the waitress and hostess~and the restaurant didn't even seem all that busy. We came in for dinner and got our little buzzer, the buzzer went off after two minutes and we went in to get our seat. The hostess ignored us for a few minutes while we stood at the booth area and waited.  ""Julie! Table of three!"" ""Michael table of 2!"" And still no ""Cindy, table of three!"" If my table isn't ready...why did my buzzer go off?? Finally, after another five-ish minutes, we were called to our table. We ordered and got our food after waiting 15 minutes for it to cook. Oh, and before they brought us our food they brought us someone else's food...geez, what was wrong with this place last night? Okay anyways, since I'm a much slower eater, I didn't finish my meal until after my friends did. We all ordered our dessert (I ordered like five minutes after they did) and it came after 20 minutes...except they didn't bring mine. My friends finished their dessert (because there was ice cream on it, they couldn't wait for me) and we were waiting another ten minutes before mine came. You would think that they should have brought them all out at the same time right? Even if mine would have taken longer to cook, they should have held off on the other two dishes so I'm not awkwardly watching them eat and vice versa when my dessert finally came.  Here's the icing on the cake though...our waitress thought it would be a good idea to give us our bills even though my dessert wasn't here yet. Why would I pay before I get my food? Honestly, what's the hurry? When she came back to our table to get the payments we told her we weren't ready to pay...SERIOUSLY...WHY would I pay BEFORE I get my food???"
Barrett W.,"Vacaville, CA",5,3,1,4.0,7/6/2015,"Our family loves BJ's! Any special event we come here! Not the least expensive place but you are paying for the great atmosphere , excellent service , and the memories !"
Miranda M.,"Wetumpka, AL",21,58,79,4.0,4/9/2016,"Had a classic burger with bacon and fries, bf got a hickory brisket burger and fries. Food was good came out hot. If you come here must try the orange cream soda, it is amazing! Our waitress, Jessica, was nice and kept the drinks filled. My only complaint was that it seemed to take a bit for the food to come out, considering we only ordered burgers and fries. But it was busy in here today, so overall a good experience."
Stephanie D.,"Napa, CA",0,9,2,2.0,5/14/2016,Sadly disappointed in my BJs baked potato. No longer mondo-tatos! Cheaper to buy a bag of russets & they'd be the same size!
