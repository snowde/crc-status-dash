Malika A.,"Dublin, CA",0,80,57,1.0,9/14/2015,"First, our hostess seated 6 people in a circle booth that was a little cramped. Then, our waitress was slow to get to us, and they weren't very busy. We were there for a birthday, and we told the waitress that, and she still didn't give our birthday girl a free dessert. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came out cold. It had fried onion strips on top that were soggy and cold. My fries were also cold and stale. Needless to say, I sent it back. When the bill came it wasn't taken off the bill. We had to ask the waitress to do so. Not once during our meal did she ask how our food was. Just because the service was lacking here, I will not give up on all BJs, but I probably won't come to this one again."
Jabez J.,"Oakland, CA",21,115,48,2.0,8/31/2014,"In the past we have truly enjoyed this place but for some reason they had an off day from the waitress that we had initially to the food. We were being taken out to dinner and the person wanted Outback Steakhouse but we assured them that BJs would be better.  Everyone was disappointed and we paid over $100 for the food. Our first waitress seemed highly distracted in which we later discovered that she was due to go home in about thirty minutes. Our second waitress was great. The food was bland and lacked flavor (i.e spinach and artichoke dip and peach and pecan cobbler), the loaded mashed potatoes were not loaded only had cheese and the waitress had to bring the other things to actually make it loaded from bacon and sour cream to chives, the ribs were dry and the roasted brussels sprouts were extremely hard.  Now why would the salads which should come with the meals come by itself and before the appetizers? Is that normal? Well it happened. The other dishes (i.e buffalo wings) and drinks were ok.  We ordered two desserts and was disappointed with them as well as stated above.  We profusely apologized for choosing BJs over Outback but still hope that this was merely a fluke. Based upon this experience unable to recommend this location."
Kevin E.,"Newport News, VA",9,22,31,4.0,3/24/2015,Awesome spot! Friendly staff!  Great food!  Best Garlic Parmesan wings I've ever had !
Patrick D.,"Belmont, CA",0,2,,4.0,3/3/2016,One of my favorite places to eat . They have a huge variety to choose from and they are able to accommodate my girlfriend with no salt . Love it
Amanda L.,"San Francisco, CA",313,288,899,4.0,8/1/2013,Came in around 2. Surprisingly still a lot of people eating or coming in to eat that late lunch. Luckily we noticed the lunch specials because I had never been to BJs for lunch before. I got the Unlimited Soup and Salad lunch special: Chicken Tortilla soup and Caesar salad. My boyfriend got the Half Sandwich Half Soup lunch special: Clam Chowder soup and Grilled Chicken Club sandwich with Crispy Thin fries.  We were satisfied with everything. They bring out a bowl of tortilla chips and avocado for the soup first and then pour the rest of the Chicken Tortilla soup into the bowl. I really liked that because the tortilla chips were crunchy for as long as possible. Great touch! The Caesar salad was good. Big portions for both....I couldn't ask for refills even though they were unlimited :( I was so full! My boyfriend's sandwich and soup were good. The Clam Chowder is surprisingly delicious! It's a creamy but light soup and I actually prefer that over thick and heavy clam chowders. The sandwich was great. Greasy (but yummy) and toasted bread and the sandwich was very filling even though it was only a half. Fries were good--we love our fries crispy. Great service as well! Great meal for 2 for under $20!
Tay O.,"San Diego, CA",68,44,8,3.0,4/14/2016,"I just have never been too impressed with BJ's. It's really very loud, and dark (maybe that's a cool thing for a date?). It's a chain. The food is not healthy, but it's also not really super interesting or original or delicious. I mean, I guess don't get me wrong. I am really glad that it's in vacaville. It's just not super exciting. To me, it's the kind of place I'd go if everyone else wants to go there, but it will never be the first on my list. I would never pick it of my own volition. As far as restaurants go, Vacaville really just does not have a super ton to offer. It's getting better. But really, for the most part, its a lot of BJ's, Chevy's, Chili's Olive Garden, chain sort of places. And frankly, I'd always rather eat at home and cook for myself then go to any of those. But, that's just me. Some people really love it. I know people who go to BJ's weekly or monthly. So I am going to go with a solid three stars. It's very average, with nothing spectacular."
Vic T.,"Vacaville, CA",31,90,41,5.0,1/5/2016,"Still love this place, can't say enough.  Room for all, great bar, TV's, loud, fun, great food, great employees!"
Patti R.,"Sacramento, CA",105,549,113,4.0,5/30/2015,"Very friendly and nice staff at this location. Quick service and the food is as good as all the other BJ's locations.  This is a nice place to stop if you've been shopping at the outlets all day, or just looking for a nice place to beat the heat."
Marylouise R.,"Hercules, CA",171,266,1163,4.0,7/15/2013,"Went here for lunch on a Thursday.  We got seated quickly, parking was easy and a great menu to choose from.  I ended up sharing a 2 item BBQ plate with the hubby... The ribs were good!  Meat came right off the bone, the chicken was also great... Tender.  My niece got the chicken, bacon, ranch pizza and loved it.   The best part was the dessert... Pizookis!  We got the sampler that came with 3 mini pizookis all topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We tried the Oreo, red velvet, and chocolate chip one, all so good! I'm going back just for dessert!"
Brenda M.,"Salinas, CA",0,18,,5.0,2/12/2016,"My husband took me here for my birthday earlier this week, this was a first time visit for us.  I loved the atmosphere. Our waitress was fast, friendly and very on point with our table and our needs.  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes with a cream gravy and man, was it delicious! Our waitress even brought me a pizookie with a candle and sang Happy Birthday to me! :-)  Everything tasted great and I really enjoyed coming here!"
Paige P.,"Fairfield, CA",0,15,3,1.0,7/27/2015,"I came here during my lunch break to pick up food for my coworkers and myself. I was told that the food was ready when I arrived, but it still took Clay (the server) a long time to bring my order out. When I got back to work I noticed that the pizookie that I ordered was burnt and the chicken from my entree tasted as if someone dumped a large heap of salt all over it. My coworker ordered a sandwich and said that it was the worst sandwich that she ever had. I will absolutely not come back to this establishment ever again."
Desiree N.,"Sacramento, CA",236,209,838,4.0,8/6/2013,Lunch was quite nice and inexpensive.  I recommend the Miso Salmon (but make sure your vegetables are hot).  The Framboise Lambic was quite nice but almost $10.00 a glass. The service was good and the atmosphere was quite nice.  I would definitely return.
Terri L.,"San Jose, CA",200,262,225,3.0,12/23/2012,"Came with some friends for a much needed reunion. This is my 2nd time coming here! I was kind of excited to come and try it out again and pick something other than a mini veggie pizza that I ordered last time. Make sure to call ahead. My friend called ahead before we arrived and got a table within 5 minutes of a 20 minute wait. Awesome! I ordered two things: a Watermelon and Feta Salad and a Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread Appetizer. The Watermelon and Feta Salad did not look like the picture I saw online. It lacked a lot of watermelon. And the feta cheese was VERY salty. I took a bunch of the salty cheese off my salad. Gross! At least the vinaigrette was tasty. The Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread also did not look that great like in the picture on the menu. I mean, I know food often does not look like the picture, but come on! There was barely any goat cheese on my pizza. :( It didn't have much in the way of roasted veggies either... But it did have a lot of basil pesto sauce on top. But holy moly! The Pizookie was so GOOD! Warm chocolate chunk cookie with cool ice cream? That was the best part of dinner! I'll only come back for a Pizookie. It was so amazingly delicious! The food was great, but it needs to have more in the way of presentation. I really don't want to pay $12 for food that is lacking."
Mercy D.,"East Bay, CA",285,370,664,4.0,9/13/2012,I discovered they now have GLUTEN FREE PIZZA THIN CRUST and it's pretty Frickin' mazing - tons better than the gf pizza from other places I've tried like Extreme!!!! (Warning: Not the the same cold though) They have a full bar (my new fave drink is the pomegranate mojito) and a nice list of beers to choose from.  Also plenty of TV screens for those days that hold multiple sports events. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand they have GLUTEN FREE PIZZOOKIE! Need I say more? Four stars because their service could be a hit or miss; sometimes service is AWEsome and flawless but other times not so great and could be a little slow...
Douglas Y.,"Sacramento, CA",569,893,2281,3.0,11/1/2012,"Standard BJ's friendly staff but always a long wait for your food. We have only come at lunch time, but I cant imagine anything would be different at dinner."
D A.,"Fairfield, CA",22,68,25,3.0,11/1/2015,"Past 2 visits were not that great.  Slow service,  no utensils etc. Food came out at all different times,  salmon had sat in the window for a long time and dried out the asparagus.  Unimpressed."
Fred P.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",22,41,97,1.0,4/17/2015,"Not a very good experience this time. After the 35 minute wait to be seated, then approximately 10 minute wait for the server, the food came out wrong. No coffee refill requests makes for a cold experience. I'll give them another try before I write this place off."
T.007 -.,"Fairfield, CA",1,16,4,5.0,12/27/2014,Another fantastic night! Keep up the good work BJ's!! Thank you Stephanie for the great service  Highly impressed with this restaurant.
Rachel W.,"Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong",315,516,347,4.0,1/26/2013,"My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit and we always have a good time! I remember when BJs was only in SoCal and I couldn't wait for it to move up here and I'm so glad it did.  As mentioned, the pizzas and pizookies are lovely. It's not a place to go for a salad- they're delish, but 12 freaking dollars?! For the same caloric content as a bomb pizza. DO IT! The appetizers are yum - I'm a big fan of the spin dip. So many beers, the sampler is a good bet. Their wine is overpriced but the pours are great. The service is usually pretty good, too. My girlfriend and I stayed for four hours one night, had three different servers, but they never seemed annoyed with us or tried to rush us out. Love it."
Daniel T.,"Fairfield, CA",196,1,,1.0,2/4/2016,If only 0 stars was an option. Me and a few co workers came in after work to get a bite to eat. The service got worst from there. I ordered my meal and they complety forgot about me. I waited and then when they finally gave me my food almost 30 minutes later it was the same burger they left on the line. She offered to get a new one if i wanted. The burger was cold so i asked to make another one. I waited again and she brought me my check for my soda before my food got back to the table. Complety disrespectful.
