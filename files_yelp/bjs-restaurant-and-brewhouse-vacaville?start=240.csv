Lori P.,"Fairfield, CA",1,49,4,3.0,11/21/2015,"I went with a couple friends for an early dinner. We placed our order and it took a good 40 minutes for our pizza to show up and when it did, it was cold and prepared incorrectly. There had been a shift change so our original waitress was replaced with a waiter. When he was told that there was a problem, he handled it very professionally and was so nice he more than made up for the problem. When the second pizza was delivered it was hot and delicious."
Kay C.,"Fairfield, CA",22,62,7,1.0,9/14/2015,"I used to love this place. Granted I haven't been in a long time. Parents and I came in for lunch today, they've changed up the menu and I can't say I like it! The three of us had a hard time finding something to eat. They've transitioned to fancy trendy foods, away from the simple delicious food. I won't be back, even for a pizookie."
Carolyn M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,5,,3.0,1/13/2016,"This is one of our favorite back -up restaurants in town.  The only thing that irritates me is about their curbside service.  I hate it when I have an order to go and all the curbside pick up spaces are full.  I can understand if they were taken up by other customers waiting for the order but all the cars were empty. I did report it inside, but there was not much they could do.  Can't they ticket them?"
Rob H.,"Vacaville, CA",1,71,2,3.0,10/9/2015,"Unexceptional food and beer.  I tried their Hefe and the deep dish raviolis while my wife tried the broccoli cheese soup.  My kids ordered a pizza and none of the food flavors were memorable.  The place was crowded on Thursday night, but that might be because Vacaville doesn't have any really robust brew pubs and not because the food was great.  I am in no hurry to return."
Malivia O. S.,"Vacaville, CA",42,6,,4.0,12/3/2015,A nice variety menu with lots of options. The food is always good and I absolutely love their pozookies.
David B.,"Dixon, CA",862,585,12302,4.0,4/1/2014,"I think this one is kinda standard.  They were pretty reasonable about the coupon, but I'm sorry to say that I think most BJ's (restaurants, that is) are hard to find faults with."
Michelle L.,"Elk Grove, CA",198,36,18,3.0,10/25/2015,Huge selection of food and drinks for a decent price. Cocktails are hit or miss. Food is mediocre and usually takes close to a hour before it hits the table.
Juleee V.,"Fairfield, CA",0,22,12,1.0,10/24/2015,"Right off the bat they are getting a one star review as 3 employees were standing at the stand by door and watched me struggle opening door and brining in someone in a wheelchair. Hideous!! Kudos to great server, Jackie."
David J.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",2,1,,5.0,6/25/2015,"This place is AWESOME!! Great pizza, great burgers and great service.  The Pizookie is a must as well."
Zzzz B.,"Richmond, CA",24,15,2,3.0,10/14/2014,I went here with my lady and son we ordered drinks. Food was cool the appetizer was the favorite for me. After reading many of the customer service  issues I can clearly see why. The waiter was mediocre at best but could certainly use some training.
Emily C.,"San Francisco, CA",26,143,77,3.0,3/2/2015,"Run of the mill chain restaurant. Nothing super special about it, but I can't really say anything bad either. The service was fine. The waiters are attentive and friendly. I found the food to be overpriced. $13 for my fish & chips and $13 for the parmesan crusted chicken. The bill was over $35 for two people. Yikes. I could go over to Red Robin next door and get a big burger for under $10. Overall, I probably won't come back because of the average food and not so great pricing."
anthony h.,"Fairfield, CA",5,64,2,1.0,2/2/2014,18 minutes on hold to place a curbside order before we had to hang up and call to get their attention.  Then we get there and they don't come out and after 10 minutes of waiting we just went in to get the food. Even then we had to wait - just inside.  Kind of defeats the purpose of getting quick food to go.   We've been here and ate inside in the past as well.  Took 45 minutes to get our food (place was empty) and the appetizer came out at almost the same time as our dinners.  This should have been a sign not to come here again.   Avoid this place if you want good service.
Jerry A.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",47,33,,5.0,7/20/2015,"I'm usually not a big fan of these types of places but a bunch of us went to BJ's last night. Got the seared Ahi salad and tried the shrimp scampi angel hair pasta. Excellent. The lettuce wraps were awesome too. The highlight of this experience though was our waiter. My god, this guy has to be the best server in the Vacaville area. I was really impressed with ""Tyler"" and trust me, if you read my other reviews, I'm not easily impressed. This guy was on the ball, attentive, fast, thorough, friendly and super efficient. If you go to BJ's ask for Tyler. IMO, one of the best servers I've ever experienced."
Jasmin A.,"Winters, CA",3,28,28,5.0,3/28/2014,"Came to Bjs this afternoon for my dad's 55th birthday & We had a wonderful time. our server Tyler was wonderful!! My dad was unsure about having lunch here because we have had bad service in the past, but he was very happy with everything today, Thanks Tyler!!!!  Our food was delicious!  Both mom & dad had the chicken pasta (? Can't remember the name of the dish) and they both finished it all! My husband had a mini personal pizza with a side salad & I had the boneless wings with the garlic Parmesan sauce. & a salad as well. omg, delicious!! Everything was wonderful & we'll definitely be back!"
Robert R.,"Fairfield, CA",6,79,141,5.0,10/7/2015,been here two times already...service was awesome...appetizers were great and the entrees very good as well. tried several different beers they were okay best section to sit in is by the bar...plenty of tvs for sports.
Joshua B.,"Woodland, CA",80,9,,1.0,11/7/2015,"My last visit here with 3 other friends was very poor. We were seated very quickly but it took an ungodly amount of time for our server to get to our table for our beers, food, and just overall checkups. Sometimes I get that you can be understaffed but our server continued to visit surrounding tables around us, yet left ours alone. Hosts were very friendly and nice but we just all felt like we didn't even have a server at our table."
Beth P.,"Vacaville, CA",4,16,,4.0,10/28/2015,Good fun but always a wait to get a table as they only accept reservations for groups.  It is very loud so don't plan a dinner where you need to talk with more than the people right next to you.  The food is good and service is usually good too.
Gus D.,"Fairfield, CA",17,6,2,5.0,9/22/2014,I really recommend this is the best food in town and the best service  we love it have great time with all the games on tv or a great drinks. Love the family fun to relax 5 stars
Linda M.,"Vacaville, CA",1,6,,5.0,11/24/2015,"Always good food and good service. I was a bit disappointed to see that they have removed the shrimp lettuce wraos. They were always my favorite. I settle for the chicken wraps, which were also yummy."
Timothy C.,"Petaluma, CA",110,473,384,2.0,1/20/2014,"I've eaten here a bunch, and usuallyit's ""okay"" food, nothing super great, and is it just me, do they have the EXACT same menu as a ""cheesecake factory""? Maybe they are owned by the same company?? Anyways... this last time we came we had a horrible experience... The waitress sucked, came by once, next time we saw a waitress was when we were told ours went home (no drink refills, rude on ordering). When the food came, my plate literally got ""thrown"" down in front of me (I'll assume it was ""dropped"", but we all know what assuming does)... The meal I had was a buffalo burger, when it got to me the meat was literally crumbling apart (couldn't maintain it's ""patty"") and it was cooked solidly through... like dark brown and I ordered Med rare... very odd and off night here, actually it was shitty. The only nice thing was the manager coming over and apologizing for the burger and getting a new one out pretty quick...  You'll go here and enjoy it, we just had an off night, but it was consistently bad for being ""off""... Ehhhh"
