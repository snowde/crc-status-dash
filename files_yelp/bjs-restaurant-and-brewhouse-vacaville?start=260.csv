Steve T.,"Vacaville, CA",0,4,,3.0,3/6/2014,Went there last night with another family so we had a larger than normal group. The staff was friendly. The atmosphere was very nice. Televisions in good spots. Very good lighting. Good amount of space. The only down side was that it seemed to be a long wait for things. I would order a beer before I finished the one I had and I would then wait. I'd finish off the one I had and then didn't have anything to drink for a bit. I don't think it was our waitress' fault.  The food was excellent!!!  Tried the traditional wings and loved them. The fish and chips were good too. The wife got a personal size pizza and it was very good as well. Enough to feed two. Kids ate their food too. Which is rare.  All in all. I would go back.
Eric B.,"Waikoloa Village, HI",0,8,,3.0,5/28/2016,Good but not great food. Service is generally good but can be spotty.
Sandyann G.,"Livermore, CA",124,332,677,3.0,12/13/2011,"We arrived at BJ's kind of late on a Thursday night to a packed parking lot so I was surprised to be seated immediately.  This place is huge inside and they have a menu to match. The menu is quite extensive and I think I repeated my daughters comment that it reminded us of another chain.  When I run into this kind of information overload I head straight to the soup and salad section.  I had an Asian Chicken salad which was fresh with all of the right ingredients.  My daughter had a bowl of the tortilla soup.  That was an experience worthy of a review all on its own.  It took two people to bring her soup.  One carried a white bowl with some tortilla strips piled in the bottom.  She thought the soup was really white and the strips on top.  Nope. The second person flourished the 'creamer' dish and poured the actual soup into her bowl.  Really?  Is BJ's that fancy?  I might have been under dressed. My Friend Erin S. had the Jalapeno burger which came with fries...very cold fries.  I think she liked the burger and would have liked the fries too if they had been served while still faintly warm.  Our server was extremely happy and friendly.  He gave us a Pizookie, some kind of cookie with ice cream on top, just for being newbie's to BJ's.  I don't think I'm overstating by saying we were happy it came gratis."
Meryem E.,"Berkeley, CA",156,80,28,1.0,12/26/2013,"I'm usually not a fan of big chain restaurants. The reason being is they're all bark and no bite meaning they hype shit up and fail to deliver authenticity, food quality and decent customer service.  Hubby n I stopped in for lunch.. The hostess was more concerned about answering the phone than greeting us and when she did it was a plain ""how can I help you"" really though? Fast forward, we ordered the chicken buffalo deep dish pizza and that's when we realized we made the biggest mistake. It was a total joke and when I brought it to our server's attention all he said was ""that's what a deep dish is supposed to look and taste like"" as if I don't know. Now, i can tell you what an authentic deep dish pizza by simply pointing out Zachary's in Oakland. Check it for your self mistah!!!  Needless to say our lunch was an epic fail from the jump."
Kalie M.,"Fairfield, CA",207,10,,4.0,10/4/2015,Great food but not the best service. The last several times I've gone in I've had to wait extended periods before our waitress' would even check in on Us Or take our order. In my experience the male waiters are much more attentive than the females.
Elaine P.,"Saint Helena, CA",30,15,5,5.0,5/24/2016,"The server Ramona was great.  I would definitely ask for her and Anthony also.  He recommended the Salmon quinoa, which was really good.  Outstanding friendly service.  I also loved the Bloody Orange Pom Sangria.  The avocado egg roll I didn't care for because the roll was too thick, but I loved the avocados in it and the dipping sauce.  Can't wait to come back!"
Victoria P.,"Vacaville, CA",2,9,2,3.0,11/3/2015,"Had lunch on Saturday, always look forward to the pizookie. We got the trio, pumpkin, salted Carmel, and the chocolate chip. The only one that was good was the pumpkin! The other too were slightly burnt and did not taste good. :("
Lorna C.,"San Diego, CA",49,117,41,2.0,3/9/2015,This place is always packed! So I know people love it. I am not impressed by the food. It seems like more of a Apple Bees or Chili's quality food. I really expected more. I've been here plenty of times in hopes that my mind will change but it never does. I do have to say the root beer is amazing and the samore's pazookie is the bomb. I would definitely come just for dessert. The service is meh! Nothing over the top and it seems like we're always looking for our server. I wish I remembered the name of our last server because she was the best one so far. So if you want good food...go somewhere else. If your just here for the bar and small bites...maybe. And if you just want dessert...go for it.
Debbie C.,"Felton, CA",41,12,11,5.0,7/14/2014,This is a great place. Extensive menu with great choices. The people who work here  are are really nice. My family and I dine here often .  There is something for everyone.
Alexander E.,"San Pablo, CA",355,636,830,4.0,10/26/2011,"I've heard of BJ's for a while now and I finally had a chance to try the restaurant.  The easiest comparison I can think of is The Cheesecake Factory, both in price and portion.  As expected, there was a crowd of people in the waiting area and outside with the provided pagers.  However, the real surprise was having to only wait about ten minutes for our table on a Friday night around 8pm. The place is huge and has a spacious interior with a full bar, plenty of TVs everywhere, and great brick decor.  We were seated in a small booth and given our menus and put in a drink order.  The menus are beyond intimidating and resembling a small book rather than a restaurant menu.  The place has pages and pages of plates horrible for your health with most items in the 1500-2000+ calorie range. I simply can't let myself order such a ridiculous heart clogging plate so I went with their healthy options.  I do wish they had a larger selection of plates, with only about five or six options.  I was hesitant with ordering my Maui Glazed Pork Chop over the Vegetarian Mini PIzza, but the waitress said the pork chop was a bigger entree. The food didn't take long to arrive -- ten to fifteen minutes.  My plate looked delicious with the pork chop looking especially succulent.  The pork chop was accompanied with roasted red potatoes, steamed green beans, along with grilled onions.  The pork chop was incredibly tender and had plenty of flavor with its sweet and tangy glaze without being overpowering.   The meal was appropriate in size, but perhaps sharing an appetizer would of been ideal.  Additionally, the price was incredibly reasonable, about $11 or $12 for my plate.  All in all, I'd like to come back to BJ's during their happy hour as I saw a bunch of specials and I'd definitely recommend it to those that have not tried BJ's."
Cydney K.,"Santee, CA",0,20,16,5.0,7/26/2015,Cory was a great waiter. Get the brussels sprouts. I would suggest mixing them with the shoestring fries and extra sauce!!!
Derek B.,"Sacramento, CA",95,17,1,1.0,2/10/2014,"1. The address was incorrect online, your GPS will not take you there.  2. They ran out of croutons for our salad 3. We ordered boneless wings, we got half boneless & half bone in 4. They charged us for 2 orders of wings because the waitress put the order in again and did not remove the 1st Overall the worst experience at a BJs. I'll stick to the one in my hometown."
Richie V.,"Vallejo, CA",0,10,,5.0,9/24/2015,"Always good food, beers, service. Crowded fri-sun.  1 hr plus wait time, due to everyone socializing and enjoying the restaurant and atmosphere."
John V.,"SeaTac, WA",3,4,,1.0,8/15/2015,I received a email stating that happy hour is in effect during NFL games and they would not honor the email even when I showed it to the waitress
Janina M.,"Little Rock, AR",302,333,338,3.0,10/21/2011,"It's either hit or miss whenever we eat here.   The most recent experience was this Wednesday.  My family was there for a birthday and we had a group of 9 + 2 babies.  My husband called ahead at 5pm for a 7pm dinner.  I was the first one of the group to show up after running errands, at 645pm and checked in.  The hostess said it would be at least 15-20 minutes before our table was ready.  I looked over to the side of BJ's where they seat large groups and it was not even half full. Our waitress told us that she was originally food running all night until they told her 5 minutes before we were seated that she had to wait on our group.   It didn't seem like she had much waitressing experience.  She never refilled our drinks, constantly forgot small requests we made (side condiments, extra napkins, etc), and only checked up on us once.  We had more help from a different waitress who was in the same area than our own. The food here is generally good except for this visit. My husband and I ordered a pizza to share.  It's the first time we've ordered it (we usually opt for soup and sandwich or other entree) and I don't think we'll ever order their pizza again.  What's with the pizza being luke warm?  There was a section that wasn't warm at all.  It was almost like it had been sitting out for awhile after it finished baking. The pizookie was delicious as always.  Maybe we'll make BJ's a place we go to for dessert only."
Sherly M.,"Walnut Creek, CA",101,62,82,4.0,5/6/2015,"I visit BJ's periodically. I've even downloaded the app to try their order ahead and premier wait list options. I'm not fully convinced by either and yesterday when I went with my BF we ended up scoping out the bar area for another seating option because after checking in the host said it would have been another 15-20 min. So overall a 50 minute wait considering the app said 35 min from time of checkin. So I'm not a fan. Luckily, we found a booth at the bar and sat OURSELVES right away. Service was decent; however two beers took quite a bit of time. I enjoy the avocado egg rolls, calamari, and even some of the burgers. And of course the pizookies, which btw I noticed they have a new peanut butter s'mores ....possibly next time!"
Candice R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,13,,4.0,2/4/2015,My husband and I like coming here and watching sports events in the bar area. They have a wide variety of food. We always get the avocado eggrolls for appetizer though. So good.
Sherichia R.,"Vallejo, CA",8,20,11,3.0,5/16/2015,The food is satisfy but the service needs a little work. The hosts are perfect but the waiters and waitresses need a little tuning up. I mean does it hurt to smile? And when they take your order they always have that look in their face like they want you to hurry up or they would rather be somewhere else. Now I've been to bj's plenty of times and this wasn't a one time incident. It's happened a couple of times. Don't get me wrong there are a handful of servers that are amazing but the past couple of times I wished I went somewhere else. My family owns a restaurant and so I know the troubles these servers go through. Even though the food is great of the device isn't up to par people will turn away.
Steven H.,"Oakland, CA",112,123,21,2.0,3/14/2016,food is ok it just takes forever to come out. would have been 3 stars but my pizookie was burnt.
Joni H.,"Anchorage, AK",10,23,13,1.0,9/25/2013,"Ugh.  I don't know why I do it. I let friends talk me into coming in here twice after the last fiasco.  The waitresses both times were very friendly, but I still had major issues. 1st time back-I ordered some type of Asian-inspired salad. It was good. There was a produce sticker in my salad. I didn't realize it til halfway through. Thoroughly grossed out. If they can't be bothered to remove stickers, from their produce, do they even check it over before serving to people? 2nd time back- I was with 3 friends.  The 2 who ordered the Ahi salad were fine. I had a burger and a friend of mine had buffalo wings. His came out boneless, they were supposed to be bone-in. The server realized that the kitchen had made a mistake, they were remade. My burger came out cold and passed well done. It was supposed to be medium (if I could safely eat rare hamburger, I would.) I cut into it, was disappointed, the server realized the kitchen had made another mistake, and mine was remade as well. If just one of the mistakes had been made at our table, I might be ok with it... but no. If there are issues with 50% of the food that comes from the kitchen, someone needs to fix something. This place has so much potential. It has great menu options, tasty beer, and football, but they just can't seem to get their act together.  BJ's, I'm swearing you off again until some outside source can convince me you've hired people who are actually competent."
