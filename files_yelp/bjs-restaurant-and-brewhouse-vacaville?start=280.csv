Yesenia R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,4,7,4.0,7/23/2015,"The food here is delicious, my personal favorite is the deep dish pizza. (The all meat one...I can't think of the name now) I've also tried the Bj's brew house burger also a good pick. My first experience was with a server named Tyler...all I have to say is Tyler received a $25 tip from me, he was awesome! My next experience was with a server named Danielle she was ok definitely wasn't as friendly but thankfully she went on break and they changed or server to a sweet girl named Bianca. For dessert the salted caramel and chocolate chip pizookie is a must try. Overall love this place and definitely recommend coming here!!"
Richard R.,"Elk Grove, CA",26,3,,2.0,8/31/2015,"On my last trip on Wednesday August 26th my girlfriemd and I ordered the same meal,  bj brewhouse burger, I had the skinny fries and she had the wedge cut. The problem was both burgers were extremely greasy and under cooked resulting in both of us getting food poisoning for 2 1/2 days. Not sure if anyone else had the same results. Time frame was 13:00 - 1400. Thank you for your time."
Kevin K.,"Menlo Park, CA",114,44,25,1.0,10/30/2013,"I came in with 3 friends. Meeting with 6 others at the bar area for a friend's birthday celebration. I purchased 9 drinks for my party, and then 30 minutes later went to purchase 6 drinks for my party. The bartender asked ""are you sure? Your group has had a lot to drink, you guys are pretty loud"" as a group of 3 behind us wearing plastic red fireman caps, drunk, cursing, dropping glasses, have friends who are half naked with them, being very loud and rude. I feel are doing more than being as the bartender described ""loud"", the group behind us was spoken to at all.  Will not be returning due to the service I received."
Kay S.,"Riverside, CA",15,15,4,5.0,6/2/2015,Went here for a business meeting at 2pm in the afternoon and they were great!  LOVED the flatbread pizza and the avacado spring rolls.  Will definitely be back!
Lucas V.,"Vacaville, CA",11,42,5,2.0,4/16/2015,"Every time we come here the service is HORRIBLE! Sometimes we wait 20 minutes after being seated to have someone come check in on us. The food is alright, we stopped coming here and just go to red robin or Applebee's because the service is way better."
Paradise I.,"Fairfield, CA",2,7,1,5.0,5/27/2015,"I have to eat here at least twice a month! The calamari is my favorite and the chicken pasta, the pizza is ok I wasn't a fan of the pizza but it could have been the pizza I tried."
Tammy P.,"Fairfield, CA",211,111,183,5.0,10/9/2013,"BJs in Vacaville never fails to amaze me. I like coming here. Even when it's crowded, we are always seated within a reasonable amount of time.  We have yet to have a bad experience with our waiter or waitress. They are always courteous and very helpful when it comes to picking out entrées and beer.   By the way, I also love the variety of beer they serve here and the food is always on point. My favorite appetizer is the southwestern egg rolls. Yummy I've never been to their happy hour but someday I will get the courage to come join in on the festivities. It looks fun on that side of the bar!"
Judith F.,"Vacaville, CA",53,59,82,4.0,4/3/2014,"I like Bj's. They have a variety of food to choose from. I really like their burgers, sandwiches, pizza and clam chowder. I don't care much for their pastas. If you're there try the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It is great. They also have great drinks."
Amanda C.,"Temecula, CA",148,423,33,3.0,8/2/2013,"I've been to this location a handful of times back when I lived in Vacaville or went to visit old friends.  If you're going to come here, I'd highly recommend having a wide open afternoon and/or evening. It takes forever from start to finish. Also, if you're planning on having a decent conversation with anyone, you're going to have to talk REALLY LOUDLY because you can't hear anything over the loudness of everyone around you. It's still worth waiting to get a Pizookie, which is like one of the best creations....ever."
Keith W.,"Clearlake, CA",0,21,,3.0,12/29/2014,The food is good I get take out now and then its there loud music all the patrons are yelling to get over the music I will not bring family or friends there you can't have a conversation.
Tracey P.,"Fairfield, CA",0,17,,2.0,7/19/2015,"Horrible Horrible horrible.....3rd time in a row that it was not good so decided to yelp it.  The server was rude and not attentive at all,  mind you we were there at 4 pm and she had one other table.  My daughter and I had the sliders, the mean was almost burnt, the fries (my favorite skinny fries) were over cooked.  I asked for diet pepsi, she brought me pepsi, I asked for diet again, she got mad...We used to go there fairly often because the food was so good but no so much anymore.  Not sure what has happened but it is to expensive to keep giving them chances.  Unless I am going for Pazookie, I will not be hitting BJ's anymore...sad face"
James J.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,12,3,3.0,12/23/2014,"The service is not always the best, but I do enjoy the food! Sometimes I get a waiter or waitress who has an attitude or just doesn't seem to happy to be doing their job. Regardless of how they actually are feeling, they should always be providing the utmost customer service, and sometimes I just don't feel like that is the case. But their food never disappoints. I love their deep dish pizza--BJ's Favorites is my favorite too. I also find the Ahi Poke to be very delicious. If all of the employees could match the quality of the food they serve, then I would consider this to be one of the best chain restaurants in existence."
Lisarae M.,"Rio Vista, CA",140,2,1,5.0,5/2/2015,Wonderful wonderful service.  Our waiter (Scott) was just seriously on top of it at all times...and this was during a busy Sat lunchtime!  Great Kale and Brussels Sprouts salad with shrimp!
Nicol M.,"Fairfield, CA",21,80,47,3.0,2/8/2015,"All the pizzas were undercooked and not hot,  as well as the desserts. They were nice to reduce some of the bill though. It is extremely noisy. Service was nice."
Diane L.,"Vallejo, CA",84,68,12,1.0,4/2/2015,"I usually enjoy BJ's Brewery in other areas (Woodland Hills, Livermore, etc) and made a special point to take a out of town friend who enjoys beer for a meal here. We traveled 20 miles specifically for this restaurant. Before we left I uploaded and used their app to get ""priority seating"". By the apps approximation our table would be ready in 40 minutes (Friday evening, so that's fine). We left in time to arrive 5 minutes before that time. When we got there, I was told it would be another 25 minutes.  And we would be in line with everyone else (non-app users). It turned out to be an additional 40 minutes. So, the app was useless and I had to remind the hostess we were there at least two times. Which stressed me out.  So, we are finally seated and I tell a manager(?) what happened and he seemed sympathetic but said it's their computer program and WiFi. He did nothing to make the situation better. When our server came by she said she'd be right back. She was back 15 minutes later and asked us if we needed anything else - because she thought we were done eating!!!! Once she realized what happened she apologized and took our orders. I ordered a steak, with a Caesar salad. My husband ordered a burger. The food took another 15 minutes. The salad came out first. Then literally 2 minutes later our food came out. I let the server know our salad just arrived and she said sorry and left. What?! My rib-eye was undercooked on one side and medium well on the other. It was incredibly tough to cut. The roasted asparagus was impossible to eat because the ends were like wood. The whole experience was awful. And no one would help us make the situation better. I don't yell at staff, but maybe I should start. Because being calm but direct got me nowhere with this uncaring staff and their careless attitude. I will not be going back to this location. There are way to many better options in the area to put up with this deplorable customer service."
Zeynep A.,"Woodland, CA",7,18,1,4.0,3/12/2015,"I have been to this BJ's a couple times now and always for lunch and my overall experience has been very pleasant. The menu is not very unique but very tasty. We had chicken tenders and a flat bread pizza and both were delicious. I was especially surprised by how juicy the chicken tenders were. The service was good, quick and attentive. Lunch menu prices are great as well. I plan to be back"
Kim T.,"Sacramento, CA",32,270,,1.0,5/30/2013,"I usually don't mind coming to BJ's with a larger group of people or for an appetizer--there's tons to choose from, something for each kind of diet or drink preference. The food is pretty good and consistent at all the locations usually. They have a nice selection of small plates so you can try a few things. Their beers have improved quite a bit from maybe 5 years back but it's sad that the staff isn't more in the know about the basics of their beers. We made reservations for our large group and showed up 5 minutes early, that's when they informed us there was no reservation. We had called the reservation in more than 24 hours in advance. They weren't apologetic about it at all and the funny thing was that this was the SECOND time this has happened at this location for our large group reservation. Not a huge deal as far as getting a table, only about a ten minute wait. We waited on a few people in our group so we waited a few minutes to order. If we knew it would be another half an hour before anyone asked us about ordering again, we wouldn't have waited. Our server seemed to vanish into the back each time she left our table.  By the time our server took our order, the lunch rush was gone and our server was still never anywhere to be found. She was very friendly when she did show up and was on the ball to drop our tab off, but that's it. Our drinks took forever to receive, we waited almost an hour for food and were at BJ's for two hours because of how slow everything was. If there was some issue going on in the kitchen, communication would have been all we required. Instead, we were left for very long periods of time and even the guy who looked like he was probably the manager was walking around and never said anything to our table (or any others for that matter) or asked how things were going. We were all searching for our server so we had to have looked like maybe we required some attention. As this visit was frustrating for everyone, we will definitely find another spot for our work gathering next time. With so many options out there, it really is crucial to have servers who are on their game or at least honest enough to share that there might be a delay. There was no reason that today's lunch should have turned out to be one of the worst from the time we walked in the door. A little customer service truly goes a long way."
Anthony H.,"Fairfield, CA",135,15,28,4.0,3/6/2014,"I love the BJ's Baked Beignets!! It had strawberries, whipped cream, a hint of ice cream as well as the pastry. Also, I had the salmon dinner. The Orange cream soda is a must."
A B.,"Fairfield, CA",0,10,1,2.0,11/14/2015,"Unfortunately I won't be returning to BJ'S for some time, if at all.  It was once one of my favorite places to grab a decent bite to eat, a delicious beer and some light hearted ambiance.   When I go to a restaurant I expect the food to be cooked to order, fresh, and it should resemble the menu description.  Tonight was a disappointment. I ordered the salmon with quinoa. I have had the dish 3-4 times since it was added to the menu. The fish was over cooked, the aparagus were chopped stems with two tips included in the bowl, yuck! The portion was comparable to the lunch size serving and quinoa was lacking flavor. The other dish we ordered was the ribeye steak. It should have been cooked medium , warm pink center!? But was basically rare. They offered to take the dishes back, fill it with another order, ect. The waitress told me they go through cooks all the time. Oh, so that's why there is so much inconsistency when it comes to the food!!!! This was not even a busy Friday night....or maybe the word is out that the Friday night cooks can't cook. I'll spend my $75.00 in an establishment that can make there menu items taste worth the money paid. The beer and wine were the best tasting menu items on this night!!"
Sarah R.,"Vacaville, CA",230,6,1,5.0,6/25/2015,I love BJS it is wonderful food to choose from and the fries is great. It's such a pretty atmosphere there.
