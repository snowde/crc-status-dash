C M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,5,,1.0,5/15/2015,"I normally love BJ's. I ordered take-out from the vacaville location tonight and not only did they get my order wrong, but the food is just dry and overcooked and disgusting. I so rarely write negative reviews but this was too horrid to go unaddressed."
P R.,"Fairfield, CA",29,24,25,5.0,10/17/2014,"We had excellent service here last night when we came to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Jacob, the manager, really took good care of us, always on top of things and constantly communicated with us while we were waiting. They even gave us some free appetizers to start with when it took longer to get a table together. (Due to the game) The food was prepared well, I had the glazed salmon, the portion is large and it tasted great!"
Glo ..,"Elk Grove, CA",0,20,8,5.0,6/12/2015,"Came here on a Friday to have lunch and a beer. Sat at the bar area. I had their lunch BBQ platter. It came with a pork slider, chicken breast, fries and Cole slaw. Every bite was delicious. Waitress (jillian) was also on point. Definitely will be back whenever I'm in town."
Ivy R.,"Martinez, CA",137,1779,4674,2.0,1/12/2009,"Not that good. Really not that good. I have had better food at Chili's. Unfortunately I was unable to drink....my opinion may have been different if I was able to have a beer.  The avocado egg rolls were pretty good. The dipping sauce was good too. I had a California Grilled Chicken Sandwich. ""Tender marinated chicken breast, grilled and topped with avocado, roasted green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing on grilled sourdough bread."" (taken from the website)  The bread was soggy and it wasn't warm. Then to top it off my fries were cold and kind of hard. Like they get when sitting in your car too long. Thankfully I didn't have to pay, this was a sales lunch. The service was excellent but I'm usually nice to servers whether I have a bad experience or not.  I wasn't impressed and could have walked across the parking lot to TGI Fridays and could have had the same types of food and service."
Jeff M.,"Winters, CA",53,10,1,2.0,6/2/2015,We have not been in a while and today's visit was like our last. The service was bad we sat there for over 10 minutes before our server came over he took our order and it took a while to bring us our drinks refills we had to track him down than I timed how long to bring my refill 7 minutes and my son asked for ranch dressing my son got tired of waiting so he almost ate his pizza before they finally got his ranch. Our server was polite although. The food was good
Ryan S.,"Spokane, WA",113,250,40,5.0,10/16/2013,"It's a BJ's, everything was good.  It was packed, football and baseball was on, so they had TV's on both for people to watch.  Their seared ahi salad was really good, and pretty much the only thing under 500 calories.  Great place."
Heather N.,"Redding, CA",17,39,3,3.0,8/11/2014,"Mediocre pizza. Boring kids menu (seriously no pizza?!). Average food. Service was really slow - took 30 minutes to get the kids' ""pizookie"". At least their meals came out faster than ours, but wow. We won't be back to this location."
Erin H.,"Santa Clara, CA",111,233,282,4.0,12/4/2011,"My mother and i were doing our shopping around the area and it was already past 1PM. We weren't feeling the usual Olive Garden and other places close by, so we drove further down to see what else they have to offer. I remember in the past that my mother has never been to a BJ's restaurant and coincidentally there was BJ's right ahead of us. Perfect. My mother asked what are BJ's specialties and I told her that they are known for their deep dish pizzas and pizookies. Since it was just the two of us and getting a personal size pizza isn't as fun as ordering a large deep dish to share with a group, we settled on ordering the lunch entrees. We both ordered the Chicken a la Fresca and it was spectacular. However, the rice was on the salty side, but the chicken was grilled to perfection. My mother and I agreed that the ratatouille was the highlight - nicely made, especially the zucchinis. Of course, you can't leave without having a pizookie. Our entree was only approximately 500 calories, so there was absolutely no excuse to be guilty about a little indulgence at the end (regardless, there should be no excuse in skipping the pizookie, period). We chose to share the Red Velvet pizookie and it was a major sugar rush (in a good way). I could've sworn the other pizookies I've had in the past were a bit thicker than what we had. My mother's first overall experience was great and she was satisfied. I don't think my father has gone to a BJ's also, and I will place my entire bettings that he will fall in love with the various beer section."
Peter L.,"Vacaville, CA",318,192,338,2.0,9/12/2009,"We usually love BJs, but my most recent experience was tarnished by disinterested staff and careless attitudes. In fact, my daughter and I left before we even ordered.  I gave three stars because the service and food is usually good.  In an area saturated by eating establishments, it's easy to pass BJs by for another choice. Nothing sends a customer to the competition faster than a disinterested staff and careless attitude."
Rob B.,"Vacaville, CA",0,11,2,5.0,3/9/2016,"Friendly service, amazing food! We got the pizza and jambalaya, both of which I recommend. Our server told us what not to order which was nice. I like that they have private label beers, I had their IPA which was really tasty"
Melissa B.,"Davis, CA",40,108,34,5.0,10/21/2013,"Im never disappointed in this place. Yes, it's always packed, and the parking is horrible because it's in the same lot as a Chevy's and I think a Red Robin, but the food is great for the price.  We called ahead and asked if they had a corkage fee if we brought our own bottle of wine. They said it was $7 but when we arrived, we had to wait 20 or so minutes at the bar and the bartender corked it for us for free (maybe because we also ordered one mixed drink? not sure). Lovely! They are currently doing a special 2 for $20 deal in which you get a salad or soup each for two people, a medium pizza to share (ANY of their pizzas!), and any pizookie to share for dessert. I love this deal. Ive gone twice so far since they started promoting it and hope I can go again before it ends. You dont need a coupon, and I believe they stop it somewhere around Nov 13th or so. Just ask your server if they are still doing this promotion, and you will have leftover pizza for lunch for sure!"
Rick J.,"Vacaville, CA",3,13,18,3.0,4/29/2015,"You may want to reserve a table especially for Friday or Saturday night. After 8:30 you can normally be seated right away. Watch out how you order your steak though, don't ask for medium cause you may just get well done! Other, that services is pretty good and the ambiance is always nice!!!"
Jim C.,"Vacaville, CA",45,35,15,5.0,7/26/2013,"This is by far the best restaurant in Vacaville.  Fantastic americana style food.   Great atmosphere and good servers.  They have a large menu that takes some time to peruse.  Several great beers on tap, an awesome home-made root beer, and the best desert around: the pazooki (freshly baked cookie under a scoop of ice cream)! I haven't yet had anything less than excellent food here!   There is often a long wait for tables, though.  Eating here between 6 and 8 pm is difficult due to the wait.  They have a bar area, but the small tables there are almost fought over as they are not staff seated."
Brandon M.,"Oakland, CA",363,128,132,1.0,3/3/2013,Girls at the front were nice and the place looks great BUT overall service was TERRIBLE and to top it off I got food poisoning. I have been on the toilet all day and I'm puking my brains out. Do NOT eat the calamari!!
Matt C.,"Oakland, CA",157,63,23,4.0,10/26/2013,I love this place!!! There food is REALLY good and reasonable!!! If you check there web page or FB wall... they have some really great specials!!! Great place to take a group and have a nice dinner out.
Oby D.,"Vacaville, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Honestly this place is a joke. Second time where I had barely any service and took long for our food. When the food came out, the food was cold. Servers were terrible never check up on us or anything until we have to say something. I rather go to Mcdonalds where my food is actually warm and come out faster."
Susan M.,"Roseville, CA",0,45,,2.0,3/4/2014,"Do NOT understand the success of this chain. Ordered dinner salad: soggy lettuce, puddle of water on plate, blue cheese dressing had no resemblance to anything related to blue cheese....then the custom pizza. My friends and I prefer Amici's across the highway. Thought we would give BJ's a try...never again. Cold, flavorless despite the toppings we chose. If looking for a good pizza the only place in town is Amici's. I will give compliments to the server = pleasant and attentive."
Darryl H.,"Vacaville, CA",56,50,4,4.0,3/3/2014,"Been here quite a bit for sodas, usually sit at the bar and watch their big-screen TV.  I like going here after hitting the gym, nice place to wind down and relax. Most of the employees are  friendly and helpful.  Have only eaten here a few times, some of the food i've had was excellent, other things were only so-so.   I like the lighting at BJ's, it's bright enough so that you can see what you're doing but low enough so that it has a mellow feel.  Overall, the restaurant, including the restroom, is clean and at a good temperature."
Sara S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,38,10,3.0,2/25/2016,"We like the food and beers, but lately service has gone so down hill...Wait time to see our waitress was 20min another waitress saw we were ready to walk out when she took our drink order!!!  Food not so fresh either,  my son got majorly sick after eating his hamburger."
Leah T.,"Vallejo, CA",0,21,2,1.0,9/5/2015,"I normally like bjs resturants ,this location I will never dine at again. On a Saturday night about 8 ish or so my family and I Decided to dine at this location. Long story short the dark haired female waitress we had was not well trained on reading patrons that she comes in contact with. We like to have fun and crack harmless  jokes to ourselves as like anybody does when with friends and family. After 2 shots she decided that we would no longer be able to consume anymore. He judgment was way off and I must say we tip VERY well. Did not get to our food that night we talked with the manager and decided to leave once our food was brought out. What establishment does not enjoy their customers having smiles, and enjoying the product. ...this one"
