Phyllis B.,"Fairfield, CA",1,10,,2.0,4/3/2015,"Waif Service good, food service awful!!! We waited for 30 minutes for or dinner and 20 minutes for our dessert less than average food  :("
Dustin R.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,134,21,3.0,8/15/2011,Since I was home for such a short while I decided to take my mom and little sister out to BJ's for dinner. The parking lot was pretty full but we luckily found a spot fairly quickly. We waited for 15 minutes and were seated with a very friendly waitress.  We ordered: Avocado spring: Tasted good but nothing really screamed outstanding. Ours were grease free which was a nice change from the vast majority of appetizers found elsewhere. Kids meal ribs: Younger sister enjoyed it with the in house root beer and mashed potatoes. Chicken fettuccine: Mom loved it. Chicken BBQ Pizza: Full of flavor and was a nice thick pizza. Cookies n' Creme Pizookie: Good ending to dinner. Came out warm and the ice cream was a tasty Oreo filling flavor.  I spent $60 total on the entire meal which is getting close to the pricier side but really not all that bad for the three of us. Our waitress did a great job and was very nice to my sister. I will come again. 3.5/ 5
Jimmy K.,"Greer, SC",37,10,68,3.0,10/19/2013,"Holy crap, that was awful.  This 3-star review is for THIS VISIT ONLY. It's 3 stars because although this time was an epic fail, usually things are pretty damn good on other visits.  My meal was late. I mean really late. Another's meal was even later, and wrong. Twice! Another's meal was supposed to be mild and came out spicy. Our server was doing her very best to wrangle the situation in between us and the kitchen. She was a gem. The kitchen, however, needs to be fired. Seriously. As an aside, we've never had a bad time there before, so I know this was just an anomaly. Well, more like a cataclysm. Oddly enough, I'm pretty amicable about dining out, having worked in fast food and other restaurants before. I know how much work goes into a service. But today... It kept getting later and later and later. Finally my food arrived, but the diner across from me was still waiting. And all she ordered was a stupid calzone. When it arrived, it was wrong. Sent it back. Waited another 25 minutes and it finally arrived after everyone else was finished. AND IT WAS WRONG AGAIN! She called the server over and said ""I'm done"" and handed it to her. Meanwhile, another's soup was too spicy after she asked for mild. The server was frustrated too, but she was very attentive and concerned. Also the manager came by and apologized. Here's where I shocked myself: I spoke up. I mean, REALLY spoke up. Like I said, I usually don't make waves, but today was ridiculous. My opinionated outburst even prompted a very pleased response from my significant other, since I never do that. Usually it's her job. I guess I was paying more attention than we both thought. That and the fact that I wanted to bring bit up to the staff before they forgot. Anyway, the manager came back and apologized profusely, admitted they failed today, comped our entire bill (except alcohol), and gave out about 10 gift cards."
Karly S.,"Vallejo, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/30/2016,Worst service for getting a beer the bartender was so slow with drinks n  she had an attitude bad service. They either should get more bartenders or get rid of her .  Never again
Melanie C.,"Phoenix, AZ",172,7,4,3.0,12/19/2014,Came in for a date night with the hubs. Our waitress was absolutely amazing and kind .the avocado egg rolls were not the best a little cold but the wedge salad was delish and huge.
Tina B.,"Vacaville, CA",62,8,,1.0,1/13/2015,"Ordered online and when we got there to pick it up they said someone called and cancelled our order. Uh, no we didn't. They said someone called and said the wanted to cancel an online order and instead of verifying the order they just cancelled the only one they saw. Then she said if you want to wait we will make it right now, it'll only take 10 minutes. 25 minutes later our meal came out and no surprise here, it was wrong. 45 minutes now after my original pick-up time the offer a free soda while we wait.  A free Soda?! Never will I go back to this shit show."
Alysse E.,"San Antonio, TX",49,61,55,4.0,7/31/2013,Unlimited Soup and Salad for Lunch is the best deal!!!  Tomato Basil Soup is wonderful!!
Martha M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,22,,4.0,2/16/2016,"Went on February 15th, was seated right away.. The food as always is good, but different atmosphere than what we are used to in our home town of Sacramento.  I had $25.00 credit I wanted to use since I am Rewards member, but the waitress didn't bother to ask us if we wanted to use, so paid full meal.  I will go again, but only in Sacramento area"
Kaycee R.,"Yuba City, CA",2,17,,5.0,2/8/2015,One of my favorite places to go in town I just moved here so I don't really know many local places to try. I love the peanut butter pazookie and the deep dish pizza. My boyfriend has tried almost all the beers here and has liked them all. They make there own root beer too which is really good in there icy chilled glass. They can get really busy but they almost always have good service.
Meghan L.,"San Francisco, CA",15,281,288,4.0,5/17/2011,It's a BJ's restaurant. Nothing Amazing.  It's clean. Food is decent. Staff is Friendly.  Can't Complain.
Jonathan B.,"Berkeley, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/27/2014,"I'm a teenager and they give me a lids cup everytime I come here. It is like a kick in the nuts to my self esteem, REALLY BJS I AM 5'7 AND A DEEPER VOICE THAN THE REST OF MY FAMILY.  Foods not even that good."
Andrew H.,"Castro Valley, CA",41,50,41,4.0,8/5/2013,"The gf and i had a really nice meal here last night, our server was Jacob, wore a green apron so either he was new, or something else was up. But he was a champ almost our entire meal. Made one or two small mistakes but as soon as he realized he fixed them quickly. Food was alright, kitchen wasnt on their A game, but it wasnt bad. Ordered the brushetta - it was ehh, the wings (hot and bbq) - yummy, and the mahi/shrimp tacos with extra chipa and avacado cream sauce - pretty good.  Overall, pleasurable expierence here at this location!"
Andrew W.,"San Francisco, CA",438,431,823,3.0,5/3/2011,"Been to this BJ so many times. Service just depends on how busy they are. Usually I come on a Friday night or on the weekend and it is packed. Wait time is 30 minutes or more, which isn't too bad if Pet-Co is open. The servers are fairly attentive although I rarely get my water refilled. I always get the same dish-- the burger melt and end with a pizookie.  What I recommend:  -- Burger Melt on a French roll -- Pizookie Trio or just the regular Pizookie"
Kali H.,"Dayton, OH",2,58,,4.0,1/15/2014,"We loved coming here for lunch or dinner. My favorite meal was the ""Field of Greens"" salad and possibly a chocolate chip pizookie afterwards.   I took off a star because service can be downright slow and God awful if you go on a busy night. One would say ""Well they're jam packed no wonder service is slow"". And you'd be right but waiting an hour and a half for food for a table of five is a bit much.  Oh and if you have a LARGE PARTY tell them separate checks from the get go because they will not separate when you're trying to settle up. It creates a gigantic headache for everyone involved including the waiter/waitress. Cheers!"
Delores W.,"Vacaville, CA",49,22,6,1.0,4/25/2014,Online Order- I was very excited to see BJ delivers. Normally food is great but this online order took 2 hours and 45 mins to get to our home. The French Dip- bread black- still smells from the burn bread. the southern chicken came with no  gravy?  Very surprised that BJ's would let leave looking the way it was received.
Megan B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,6,,4.0,1/5/2016,We have done take-out twice from here... YUM! The BBQ Chicken salad was fabulous. Generous portion sizes.
Denise D.,"Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",416,378,137,4.0,5/31/2010,"I enjoyed my first visit to BJ's (any BJ'S- we don't have them where I live) on Saturday. My friend and I very much enjoyed the beers (I had a Nutty Brunette, she had the tasters) and we were pleased with the selection of appetizers. We ended up with the ahi poke and it was amazing. We also liked our bartenders-- they were very friendly and funny with us. (One laughed out loud when my friend spoke of the woman who stole her ex: ""She was so stupid, she didn't know the sun was a star."") I hesitate giving my experience 5 stars simply because we didn't order entrees. But I'd definitely go back!"
Shirley M. J.,"Folsom, CA",178,1058,6484,2.0,3/27/2013,"I want to buy some beer, but the ABC didn't give BJ's the appropriate liquor license!  Rats!  NO BEER to take home in my growler!"
Angela D.,"Fairfield, CA",75,212,554,4.0,5/3/2011,"I have been to BJ's many times and have always been satisfied. The wait time to get in can be pretty long, depending on the time and day, but now that they offer ""call ahead"", that helps.  We started with the Santa Fe Spring Rolls. It's one of my favorites! For my meal I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken... yum. And then for dessert we were so pleasantly surprised that they now have a Red Velvet Pizookie ...... O-M-G! It was pretty yummy!  I will definitely be back to BJ's again!"
