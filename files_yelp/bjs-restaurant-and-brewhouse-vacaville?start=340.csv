Matthew G.,"Vacaville, CA",186,108,63,4.0,7/16/2014,"Service is always good, prices are just right and food has never been disappointing.  This is BJ's.  Located pretty much everywhere, good ol' BJ's is always reliable.  Nothing special but great for a group event, which we have a lot for work.  Always crowded, kinda loud.  It's all right."
Roxana G.,"Vacaville, CA",38,16,1,4.0,8/29/2014,"The food is all pretty good. Service is good, prices are not so bad. My problem is that it's always busy.. Even if you call ahead for seating, it still takes a long time, plus the hostesses are usually clueless (no offense). I would not go on a weekend with my children, way too busy. There are so many yummy things to pick from in menu., can't go wrong."
Elle J.,"Concord, CA",31,159,17,4.0,2/26/2013,"A friend of mine suggested we go here and I was pleasantly surprised. I drank the agave Margarita on the rocks, and it was strong and good. The bar tenders were fast even on this really busy evening. My only complaint is they were out of buzzers the night we went, so we put our name on the list went to the bar to have a drink, and then they 'said' they called our name over the loud speaker but when we didn't hear they gave our table away. We finally went to check on what was taking so long to be sat and found out they gave the table to someone else. They quickly found us new seating, so all was fine, but there has to be a better way to let people in the bar know they're table is ready. We started with the chips and salsa, which were meh... I'm a fan of fresh pico de gallo style salsa and this was a more smokey cooked kind of salsa. I probably wouldn't order it again. I had the BBQ chicken salad on the servers recommendation and loved it! I don't know how they season the chicken but it was delicious, and the salad had the perfect ratio of chicken, to lettuce, to extras, to dressing. It was delicious to the last bite! My friend had the california BLT or something like that and enjoyed the meal, although his fries looked a little meh. I would definitely come here again! For a chain restaurant I say this place beats several of the competitors with ease!"
Aileen D.,"Vallejo, CA",199,61,67,4.0,9/28/2010,"I am a huge fan of BJ's! Great atmosphere for some good food and good sports. Since it's football season now, every Sunday during the games, there's Happy Hour (1/2 off mini pizzas, $1 off beers i believe, and a couple more savings for appetizers and cocktails i think) I prefer sitting near the bar because of the six different TVs in the area.  The service was pretty good and the food was even better. My bf and I usually share a Cajun pasta with shrimp (my personal fave) and a mini Great White pizza (his fave).  If you can, ask if they're serving cantaloupe martinis because last time i was there the bartender made one and it was really good!! OH AND DONT FORGET TO SAVE ROOM FOR A PIZOOKIE!"
Jenna G.,"Boulder, CO",0,5,,4.0,1/17/2015,"Came here for my birthday last night and our waitress was awesome. They bring you appetizers while you're waiting to be seated and the food comes out very quickly. Their pizza and avocado egg rolls are delish. We've also liked the Cajun pasta, baked potatoes, fries and pizookies. I only hold back one star because it's a bit pricey and the beer isn't fantastic ( but still worth trying and a break from the limited taps of many local restaurants). If you can ever make it to one of the actual BJ's breweries (Reno, Boulder, etc), the atmosphere is great."
Mosheem K.,"Vacaville, CA",39,175,160,4.0,2/7/2013,Anyone who gives this place a low rating is just a pure hater or they are upset at how busy this place always is. I went here on a Wednesday night and had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.   The reviews about the pizzas are correct- they are amazing. I have a new favorite entree- The Cajun Pasta with shrimp! It is very delicious and the portion is so huge that I had to pack half of it to-go. Their clam chowder is also a big hit! Especially when you get it inside the sourdough bowl.  My only complaint about this place is that they do not accept reservations or calling ahead.
R C.,"Fairfield, CA",32,47,103,4.0,8/16/2013,"Always a good spot for a sports bar themed restaurant. Kid friendly since it's usually loud. Only 4 stars since they don't have reservations, only call ahead waiting."
Janet H.,"San Francisco, CA",821,1087,218,3.0,8/10/2010,"I normally don't like Yelping chain restaurants, but I just had to, because we had the sweetest waitress ever. She was so patient with us, despite our party of 15... literally a party, since we were celebrating my friend's 21st birthday. Unfortunately, I cannot recall her name, but she happily split our checks for our convenience... even when people split 2 dishes between 3 people! Despite our attentive waitress, however, our food took forever to come (well, it's expected), and one of the dishes was missing... but mistakes happen. Now, the food was mediocre. The chicken balsamic vinagrette was pretty good. Came with onion rings and cheedar mashed potatoes, which were both tasted flavorful. On the other hand... the Grilled chicken over pasta tasted like nothing... most bland meal ever. Even I can cook better than that. Cajun pasta was spicy-good, but eh... I don't recommend getting pasta here. Overall, I'd give BJ's 2 stars, but because of our waitress, she managed to bump my review to 3."
Jared L.,"Longmont, CO",30,27,5,4.0,4/15/2014,The wait here has always been a short one and the restaurant is nice and clean.  The variety of food on the menu is great and there is a wide range of prices which is like.  I got a Bacon cheese burger with fries for $7.95 and it was enough food for me. The beer they have is good.  Its not top quality Micro beer like Russian River Company or Lagunitas  but good non the less.  This was my 3rd visit and I will defiantly be coming back.
Luiza F.,"New York, NY",153,13,,1.0,11/17/2012,"If I could give negative stars I would. Worst service ever. Hostess can't make a simple reservation and doesn't even assume the mistake she made. It was my mom's bday, she made reservations and after an hour wait they wanted to split us to sit down bc THEY messed up on the reservation. This place is overpriced and the service is worst than a terrible ""BJ""!!!"
Sandy H.,"Vacaville, CA",0,7,,4.0,12/24/2015,"Each time I go, I discover something new to enjoy. Service is friendly and food is delicious. But if you're going expecting to be able to have quiet conversations with your dinner companions, you may need to choose another option. Quiet conversation can be difficult depending on how busy the restaurant is - it can be very loud and difficult to hear without really talking loud."
Hannah B.,"Wright-Patterson AFB, OH",0,2,,5.0,11/30/2013,I've been here a handful of times. Although at times extremely busy I've always been able to grab a seat or table in the bar with no wait.  The beer is delicious! And the happy hour is from 3-6 pm with $4 beers and a good appetizer selection.
Brittany W.,"San Francisco, CA",89,13,5,4.0,9/12/2014,"Went here on a Friday for lunch. Service was good from heather, and the food was pleasant. I had the enlightened chicken tacos. There wasn't a wait, and the food came out within 10 minutes of ordering. I would come again."
Jason F.,"Vacaville, CA",168,11,10,1.0,5/7/2014,This place is way to busy for the average menu that they have.  I don't find Nothing special about it that I look forward to eat.  I much rather go across the parking lot to Red Robin where there is no wait.
Jennifer R.,"Vacaville, CA",1,12,,1.0,3/22/2014,"If I could give this a 0 star rating I would, unfortunately,   doesn't have that option.   DON'T GO TO THE BJ'S IN VACAVILLE, CA!!! The BJ's in Vacaville, Ca is way too overcrowded, and not enough staff on hand to serve customers.  I only went to the BJ's in Vacaville twice when I used to live there, and on both accounts, I had the worst experiences with customer service and fine dining.   The first time I went was back in 2008.  I ordered a giant baked potato meal and a side salad with blue cheese dressing.  When the salad arrived, I got a vinaigrette dressing instead of blue cheese.  I told the waiter that I asked for blue cheese dressing.  He took my salad back to the kitchen and returned 3 to 5 minutes later with my salad.  I took a bite, and could taste blue cheese dressing mixed with the vinaigrette that was on there from before.  Just awful!  Didn't even have the decency of giving me a whole new salad, but made matters worse by combining two completely different tasting salad dressings.  Just awful!  When my baked potato came, it wasn't even light and fluffy when I carved into it.  It was clumpy and chalky; like as if someone warmed it up in a microwave, and didn't put it in long enough. I waited a full year before I gathered up enough courage to go back to BJ's.  I thought, ""Well, it's been a year... Maybe the management and staff has changed during this time.""  I was wrong! In 2009 I went with my boyfriend at the time.  We opened the door to the front, and there was a female staff member on the phone with a customer.  She didn't acknowledge our presents by giving us a nod letting us know that she'll be right with us.  Nothing.  She was on the phone for nearly 10 minutes.  Then after her conversation, she hung her phone up and left the podium to talk to someone that was waiting in a chair by the door.  She seemed like she knew the person or was friends with that person, because she conversed with that individual for another 5 minutes.  So far, me and my boyfriend were waiting for almost 15 minutes at the front door with no acknowledgment that we wanted to eat at their restaurant! After the front desk lady was done conversing with the person in the chair by the door, she left in a hurry to the main dinning room.   At this point my boyfriend and I were like WTF?  Is this really happening?  She didn't acknowledge us, didn't take down a name, didn't ask us how many in our party, didn't tell us that it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait for a table, didn't even say sorry for the wait how may I help you?  Basic common courtesy 101.  She just zoomed down the hallway to the main dining part of the restaurant, and no one came back to fill in for her absence at the front podium.   My boyfriend and I waited an additional 5 minutes for someone to come back to the front podium to help us out, but nobody showed up! My boyfriend and I waited 20 minutes up at the front with NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT that we wanted a table to eat at.  NOTHING!  Usually, a person that waits that long at the front gets a buzzing coaster that would have gone off by that time!  We said screw this, and left! I talked to a guy from work that lives in the Vacaville area about a week ago (this is March 2014.  Present day time.) about my two experiences with the BJ's in Vacaville, and he said that it's pretty much the same as it was when you were there 5 years ago.  He told me that when he was there last, the waiters and waitresses never came by to refill their table's glasses. And you know what, it took me 3 MORE years from that crappy service that I had at the one in Vacaville to even want to go to another BJ's!  When the one in the Arden Fair Mall opened up in Sacramento, Ca. I got up the courage to go to that one and try it out.  And you know what?  Their service and food IS AWESOME!  So then I decided to try the one in Roseville, Ca. and you know what?  Their service and food IS AWESOME AS WELL!  So, it's not the chain that's the problem, it's the BJ's that's in Vacaville that's the problem!   My advice to the BJ's that run the corporate office:  Fire the manager and staff working at the one in Vacaville!  They don't know what customer service is if you threw it in their face!"
Hagow C.,"South San Francisco, CA",34,179,,3.0,3/8/2014,"Came here for a retirement party. BJ's said they do not like to serve big parties and suggested we go for the buffet. Didn't know they even had a buffet. so for $21/pp including tax and tip, we had green salad, chicken pasta, tomato flavored pasta, thick greasy pizza, bread and ice tea. They don't replenish the food unless you ask them to. Food was so-so. I wouldn't come back on my own nor would i take friends here. 3 stars might be pushing it."
Deanna F.,"Fairfield, CA",135,13,1,1.0,10/18/2014,"This was supposed to be a nice lunch for friends renewing their vows. Reservations were made in advance. We still had to wait. Once we sat down we had three waiters/waitresses at the table but then they disappeared! It was 20 minutes before we ordered drinks, another 15 minutes before they came then another 15 minutes before we ordered food! Food was ok. My salad was limp. My daughters corn dogs seemed a bit over cooked. However my husband liked his pizza. This was a special event. The kitchen had us waiting while they washed more dishes for our cake. The cake had been dropped off early so I told them ahead of time what was needed. The place was not busy so this was unnecessary. I won't go back unless I really have to."
Anne-marie F.,"Vacaville, CA",59,3,,3.0,11/21/2015,"So I recently visited the restaurant on a Friday night Usual busy night. So my friends were already waiting for the table by the time they reached there and they said it would be like 20-30 min. An hour passes by and many people have been seated before us that showed up later then is, to be clear it was just 4 of us and we had the pagers like everyone else. We also waited close by the counter in case they call us. We went up to the hostess with too much makeup on and asked how much longer and she said that she had called us 3 times with no answer, but not only did our pager not go off, we did not here he call our names, I distinctly remember the only 4 party table being called was for someone named cristy. With quick exchange of looks between the hostesses, one decides to finally seat us to a table. As far as that goes, the server was very quick and helpful throughout the rest of our visit. Food was delicious and we left a decent tip for her. I won't stop going to eat there but the hostesses need to step up their game here."
Kevin C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,18,,3.0,11/19/2015,"Food is good.  They have a large and complex menu that's very time consuming to figure out what you want.  The service has been ok.  The place is an absolute zoo after 5pm and the wait times can be lengthy.  It's loud too, but I think that's supposed to be the atmosphere here"
Michelle R.,"San Francisco, CA",85,146,6,4.0,9/5/2012,"Their ""Nit-Wit"" summer special is SO refreshing! It's very light, with a slight hint of orange citrus and coriander, but not overly spiced. I asked for a watermelon-wheat, but they didn't have it on their ""guest list"" or whatever they call it, and our waitress suggested the Nit-Wit instead. The food is typical of a brewery, burgers. sandwiches, salads, pizzas, pastas, chef specials etc..and I believe they are owned by the cheesecake factory, so they're pretty good.   Try their Pizookie dessert..SOOOOO good! You can pick what cookie flavor you want, and they bake it in this dish, then top it with your choice of ice cream.  We got the white chocolate macadamia cookie, topped with vanilla ice cream. YUM! PERFECT for summer."
