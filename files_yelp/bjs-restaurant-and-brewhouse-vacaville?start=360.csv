Cal R.,"Vacaville, CA",5,16,,2.0,12/22/2011,"Typical holiday restaurant management, here we are group of 6 for lunch, called ahead and still waiting for salad an hour later.  BJs please look at the calendar!!!! Although the soup and sandwich soup part is great, the sandwich must come at some point.  Crispy skinny fries,  not so crispy! Yet another Vacaville chain restaurant that people seem to love, not sure why???"
Tori E.,"Dixon, CA",28,40,20,4.0,6/27/2014,"BJs is one of my go-to spots when I want an easy meal that I know I'll like. I've tried quite a few things and I've never been disappointed. I don't drink beer, but my friends say the beer is good, and they offer beer flights which is nice for a chain. The service as always been consistent even when it's busy. They have quite a few gluten free options, including a gluten free PIZOOKIE! Get it, you won't be disappointed."
Blakeley B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",134,23,41,5.0,7/30/2014,This place is beyond amazing! I would drive down from chico just for a date night dinner. I recently had there takeout service and it was extremely fast! 15 mins for 4 full meals and drinks! The food was so perfect!
Debbie F.,"Davis, CA",56,32,8,4.0,7/27/2014,"Bjs is always a great dinner choice, especially for birthdays because of the free pizookie! The avocado egg rolls are the best appetizer to start with and the balsamic glazed chicken is absolutely delicious. Usually there's a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it."
Keith A.,"Fairfield, CA",60,31,23,1.0,12/22/2012,What a waste of time. Took them a half hour to tell me they don't carry the NBA ticket at this BJs. Unfortunately I already order food. If they told me up front I would have just left. Mabe it's just the Vacaville's BJ's but I will not be coming here when I can get the same at home.
Megan I.,"Vacaville, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/15/2014,What happened to human kindness?left BJs in Vacaville with a thank you and no response from the hostess and for that matter the server who waited on me bad bad customer service I won't be back.
Jeff K.,"Fairfield, CA",110,83,356,4.0,11/2/2010,"For appetizer my wife and I split the Ahi Poke with fried wonton wrappers.  It was surprisingly good compared to poke I've eaten in Hawaii. As far as real food, don't order anything else besides the deep dish pizza.  I was so tempted to order the turkey burger on whole wheat bun, but my inner fatboy took over.  I'm so glad it did.  I order the BJ's Favorite Pizza which has ""The Works! Oven-baked meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes.""  I know it's not like any you'll get in Chicago, but it so was delicious.  My wife ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but she said mine was better.  I want to come back and try some of the other pizzas and a pizookie (Pizza/Cookie).  I was so full I couldn't even attempt to eat dessert.  What can I say, I love BJs."
Jason J.,"Fairfield, CA",0,9,1,4.0,9/10/2014,"I had an exquisite ribeye at BJ's last night! In fact my entire dinner was tremendous. Plump delicious baked potato and roasted asparagus. Their homemade root beer and cream sodas were a nice compliment to my meal as well. I saw a review on here that said they can't cook a steak, well I strongly disagree. That was the best steak I've had in a while.  Also try the fried artichoke hearts and the fish n chips!"
Joey G.,"Davis, CA",3,2,,1.0,3/15/2014,"Today was my first time at BJ's. We had to wait 25 minutes before a table was available which was not unexpected for a Saturday evening. We were hopeful that this was a good indication that the food was worth waiting for. Unfortunately, the food was downright awful. The fish and chips and french fries were definitely fried in old oil that imparted a bitter after-taste to an extremely greasy and bland tasting fish. The absence of flavor extended to the burgers and fettuccini alfredo. The alfredo was a boring and clumpy mess. This was a disaster and definitely a waste of our time and money. We could not bring ourselves to finish any of the food so we're going to rush over and grab a burger from our favorite fast food chain so that we can try to erase the lingering unpleasant and unsatisfactory experience."
Holly M.,"Vacaville, CA",15,134,64,4.0,1/30/2012,"Love the sports bar atmosphere. Wide menu selection, great food and friendly staff. Always a treat to come here!"
Josh W.,"Suisun City, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/19/2014,"Horrible experience. I ordered a steak medium rare with a salad. I received it rare, cut in half, and with no silverware. Not to mention I never received my salad. The steak was ok, I don't mind rare steak but not on a 1"" thick rib eye. I ordered a second round of drinks and my beer came with a complementary hair in it. I've drank at many a rawnchy dive bar and never had this problem. I was not impressed with the food or the service which sucked because I only really went there for the pazooki but after drinking half a hair I pretty much lost my sweet tooth."
Mary E.,"Martinez, CA",3,120,4,3.0,1/24/2013,"I've been to this location a couple times and service is definitely hit and miss.  For happy hour on a busy, hot summer evening I had great service, tasty cocktails and appetizers.  However more recently I went in for dinner on a week night and the restaurant was half empty yet the hostess made us stand around waiting to be seated.  There was no one else waiting and plenty of open seats okay whatever.  Took about 5 mins before my name was called in the meantime there were 3-4 employees gathered around the hostess desk talking and at times appearing as if they were trying to figure out confusion amongst themselves or where to seat people.   Finally seated, read the whole menu once or twice before a waitress came over.  This particular night we were not interested in drinking beer or cocktails and just stuck with water which seemed to disappoint the waitress since they are drilled to push the alcohol sales.  Water glasses were empty for a bit a couple times and wait time to pay the bill was also slow.   Menu is large with many options but one thing that always annoys me is they don't allow lunch sized servings of salads at the dinner hour.  Most people do not want to take home leftover salad in a doggie bag.  So if you're not wanting a large portion meal avoid the dinner salads stick to the side salads, small bites and appetizers.  The entrees are also all large servings and the pizzas and calzones are tasty. Overall the food was good so definitely 3 stars there.  It's nothing special, typical chain restaurant.  Good for lunch specials and happy hours but skip for dinner and cross your fingers you're there on a night when servers are on their A-game.  Plenty of better chain options in the area."
Erin S.,"Concord, CA",290,494,643,3.0,8/19/2011,"This place has surprisingly good beer. It's a chain so I didn't expect much. But I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed their Jeremiah Red & Nutty Brewnette (a nut brown...get it?). Their food, meh.  Maybe I should have tried something a bit more exciting than a turkey burger, but after combing through the ridiculously large menu for 10 minutes, I was overwhelmed & just wanted to order. We started with the ahi poke, which was good & fresh. Pretty much everything else on the appetizer menu was deep fried. I guess that shouldn't be much of a surprise for this type of a chain restaurant.  The place was pretty packed on a Wednesday night, which leads me to believe you'll have to wait for a table just about anytime you visit. Looks like quite the place to be in Vacaville!  There is a BJ's near my house & I would give it a try.  But maybe just for the beer & some deep fried apps."
Monica W.,"Oakland, CA",0,23,,5.0,9/26/2014,"This restaurant was exceedingly good. The food was very good, the service was very good. I would recommend this restaurant.  Great Job, BJ's!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
Gary C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,1,,5.0,9/20/2015,"I've been going to BJs for a while, so I am always looking for something new.  The bartender recommended the Rootbeer Ribs.  They were amazing. So tender and flavorful.  And they paired perfectly with the Berryessa House IPA, which we have been requesting for a long time.  I highly recommend both."
Matt H.,"Suisun City, CA",16,13,1,4.0,6/12/2014,"Call ahead seating is the way to go.  Every time I've been here has been a pretty good experience.  Good food, plenty of beers to choose from.  But, the downfall is the liquor selection.  But, I guess you are at a Brewhouse..."
Trishia P.,"Fairfield, CA",250,544,352,3.0,4/28/2012,"My mind has been changed.... Over the years I've disliked BJ restaurants (in LA, SD, HB and VV) because all their service sucked! I mean like really sucked....they would drop my food and take forever to remake it, take forever to come bring food or take my order and overall neglect my table. However, the last few times I went the service has improved. Cookies and cream pizookie is delicious, HH ain't bad."
Briana C.,"Fairfield, CA",81,113,33,4.0,3/24/2014,"I love their Fresh Atlantic Salmon. I substitute the seasonal steamed veggies for sautéed spinach. Delicious! I'm also a huge fan of the hand crafted root beer. It's so flavorful with a hint of vanilla. For appetizers, I suggest the fried calamari or hot wings. & dessert, who could pass up a pizookie! I recommend calling ahead to be put on the waiting list, I don't believe they take reservations."
Shikha S.,"San Jose, CA",151,139,109,4.0,4/9/2014,This is our family's staple place for an easy Friday night out. We enjoy the food (large variety on the menu) and the service. We have yet to be disappointed by this BJs. Def. recommend it for a family dinner out that is fun and casual.
Lupe P.,"Antioch, CA",9,32,5,1.0,1/18/2015,"Super nasty!!!. I ordered a chicken fettuccine Alfredo with extra extra sauce. No where on my plate did I see extra sauce. It was super dry, the chicken tasted like rubber. The noodles were over cooked. My plate was overall nasty. Only took 3 bites from it, & that was just because I felt bad that I was wasting the plate. But I gave up after trying to ""enjoy"" it. My boyfriend ordered an individual pizza that turned out to be overly baked, it felt like we were biting into chips instead of a pizza. The pizza was burnt, didn't taste like it had extra sauce or extra cheese.  It was flat out disgusting. We had gone with a party of 20 for a birthday dinner,& the waitresses didn't take our order until 45 minutes after we had been seated, my waitress forgot my drink every single time she would come around, I didn't end up getting my drink until probably 10 minutes before receiving my food that we waited on for an hour after ordering . Service was the worst I've ever experienced at a BJs. For sure not giving this BJs another try."
