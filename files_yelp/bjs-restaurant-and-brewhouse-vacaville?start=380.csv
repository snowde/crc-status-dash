Jennifer P.,"Fairfield, CA",0,13,1,5.0,8/25/2014,Love the variety of beer and appetizers. Waitresses are always nice. Only had one bad experience but even that wasn't bad. They had put onions on my food after I said I was allergic. They remade it no problem and even offered to give me a free appetizer while I waited for the food to be remade so honestly no complaints. Love to go here after work and chill with friends.
Nicole C.,"Discovery Bay, CA",502,523,674,1.0,6/19/2011,"By far the worst BJ's that I have ever dropped money at. The food, is generally the same across the board at these places, as it is a chain so this review is based on ""service"" or lack thereof.  Decided to go here on a Saturday, did a call ahead at 7pm while we were down the street shopping at the outlets. The little girl on the phone told me that the wait was about 40 minutes long and to show up within that time.  So we showed up at around 35 minutes after we did our ""call ahead"" reservation. There were a lot of people waiting, which is fine. We got up to the hostess station and she handed us one of those buzzer's and told us it would be an additional 15 minutes.  Ok, fine. I can understand that. 25 minutes after we were waiting outside, and (waiting an additional 25 minutes with two toddlers in a crowded area where they are unable to run around) is not cool considering we called ahead.  The Emo looking seating hostess told me that they were clearing our table and getting it set up, so the rest of our party came into the restaurant to wait. ANOTHER 25 freaking minutes passes and the kids are starving and restless I go and tell the seating hostess that it does not take 25 freaking minutes to clear a table and set it and if the wait was going to end up being an hour and 40 minutes they should have just told us that when we called because we could have most definitely gone elsewhere OR driven home, ordered a pizza and eaten at home all within the time we were waiting for a damn table.  So another 10 minutes goes by and we get seated. The ""wonderful"" seating hostess tried to say that they had a party of 40 there that they had to clear up. I told her she was full of it because when we got there an hour before there was no one on the far side of the restaurant and the tables were all clean and set up for guests. Her ""story"" did not make any sense.  Being in a service industry, I would suggest that the management of this ""establishment"" tell his workers to be HONEST about wait times and then not try to shovel BS stories to keep people from getting upset. All that does it make people even more mad."
Lena K.,"Petaluma, CA",27,7,,2.0,3/18/2012,"I have been to this restaurant twice since moving to Davis, CA.  My first visit was satisfactory, but not great.  The restaurant was really cold throughout the meal, even though we weren't seated by the door.  The server was friendly and I liked that they give you free tastes of beer before you decide to buy one.  Their Oktoberfest beer was nice, not much to it though.  I ordered a personal deep dish pizza and it was fine, typical sports bar/brewery fare. The send time I visited the restaurant was for my friends birthday.  We were waiting for a few people when we first sat down so I think the wait staff was not expecting to serve us right away.  However, when we were ready to order drinks it was difficult to find our server.  After ordering drinks we waited even longer for the server to come to our table so we could order our food.  This was a different server but friendly enough.  The food came fairly quickly and everything was correct. I ordered a deep dish pizza again, the meat one, on whole wheat.  It was pretty good, but again, typical sports bar fare.  I tried the seasonal Abbey brew and it was very watery, so I shared the Jeremiah Red with my friend, which was better.  My friend received the complimentary birthday Pizookie, which was tasty and a nice touch, and some other people in our party ordered dessert.  One dessert was brought out quickly but another one was forgotten.  We sat at the table for probably 10 minutes before we were able to flag down someone and have the dessert brought out.  Finally our server came by to give the check and offered to split the checks, a nice touch also. Lastly, I brought home some of the deep dish pizza and noticed that the box says ""still the best pizza"" on the side.  Sorry BJ's, but have you heard of Old Chicago Pizza in Petaluma (sonoma county)?  That is by far the best deep dish pizza I have ever had and I think you can learn something from them as far as pizza goes. Bottom line: friendly wait staff, average american pizza, watery to ""alright"" beer, cold temperature, often slow service, wouldn't chose this restaurant for my birthday celebration even if the pizookie is tasty."
Ian C.,"Napa, CA",52,60,30,4.0,4/18/2010,"A great place to grab dinner with a group of friends. Lively atmosphere, large crowd of people on the weekends. I suggest you call ahead to get your name on the waiting list. They have televisions throughout the restaurant which have all the sport games on. They stock a full bar and BJ's has their own line of beer and house made root-beer. The food isn't bad and the portions are big. I have been content with all of the items I've tried off the menu. The service is friendly and normally good. The restaurant could be a bit cleaner, sometimes I will find a napkin or bits of food in the corner of the booth. I normally order a grilled burger melt with the crispy-thin fries, excellent french fries. You have to make sure to save room for their famous pizookie. Basically a pizookie is a hot out of the oven cookie topped with ice cream. I normally share a party platter with the table, it's a mixture of cookie flavors the size of a large pizza. My favorite flavors are white chocolate macadamia nut and oreo. They serve food and drinks in the bar up until midnight. I enjoy any place that serves customers later then the majority. Overall a great place to hang out with friends and eat decent food."
Abe L.,"Vacaville, CA",2,53,5,4.0,9/12/2013,"It's a chain, don't expect too much, but if you are into that kind of places, you might enjoy it. Not my kind of tea. All the things on the menu are for beer lovers but way too many calories for my taste."
Donna F.,"Vallejo, CA",140,94,70,5.0,10/20/2011,"You gotta ask for Corey!! We had the greatest service  He's very attentive and super friendly. Three of us shared the Great White Pizza, BBQ chopped chicken salad, jambalaya and of course the White Chocolate Macadamia pizookie.  After our meal, he even gave us great advice about a pumpkin maze/winter wonderland to visit.   Corey, if you're reading this, you totally rock!"
John M.,"Richmond, CA",938,1196,1156,3.0,1/25/2010,"Dudes' night out, so me & the buds went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. Being in Vacaville, there aren't many really, truly great dining options. BJ's looked interesting in that beer & pub grub is something dudes always like, but BJ's proved to be no exception to the abundant mediocrity available in Vacaville. Bj's offers a decent variety of its own beer on tap that would seem to talk the talk of a craft/ micro brew, but the flavors just don't walk the walk. I had their brown ale, stout, & porter, in that order. One of the other dudes also started with the brown ale. He commented that there was a hint of urine in the flavor profile, seriously he said ""urine."" I noticed that my brown ale smelled like the iron in hemoglobin, seriously it had that ferrous blood smell. Not a good start when the first round smells like blood & tastes like piss. We both, naturally, sent ours back & moved onto the stout. Both the stout & the porter basically tasted like they should but in an indistinct, less flavorful, Budweiser kind-of-way. Maybe the flavor is dialed down to appeal more to the masses who actually enjoy Budweiser. The food was ok. We had nachos, chicken sliders, pulled pork sliders, & seasoned fries. Big servings all around for appetizer dishes. The nachos had heaping amounts of toppings & were pretty good. The chicken sliders were bland. The pulled pork sliders had decent flavor but still a bit bland compared to really good pulled pork. The seasoned fries were ok & were gobbled down quickly thanks to beer induced munchiness. All other things considered, BJ's might have rated 2 stars but the service was outstanding. The place was packed & it was very busy, but the entire staff was friendly, attentive, & on top of things. Truly some of the better service I've seen in a while. The service staff deserves a compliment & a good tip."
Daniel D.,"Concord, CA",827,462,315,3.0,3/27/2012,"I came here on a Friday afternnoon around lunch time. The parking lot was pretty packed and it was pretty busy inside as well. My GF and I only came to have a pizookie as dessert.  First impression was that our hostess was really weird and awkward. Our server was slow. She seemed overwelmed which is why it took us almost 45 minutes to get our pizookie and pay. As you might see, it wasn't very impressive. I don't know if I'd come here for a meal but it's rare for me to be in Vacaville. In general, BJ's has decent food and it's really just hit or miss when it comes to the service. I'm assuming that it was just a busy, lunch hour.  The pizookie itself was delish. It didn't seem like it was piping hot and fresh but it was fine because we were hungry."
Sean K.,"Lodi, CA",49,76,5,4.0,7/5/2011,"Avocado egg rolls, and the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon. Don't thinking I've tried anything else here. Lucked out the first time I had it, and fell in love with it.  When they are busy, grab a table in the bar area. There is a ton of tables"
Matt L.,"Fairfield, CA",6,11,8,1.0,12/27/2013,They said a 30 minute wait and my family and I ended up waiting 1 hour and 25 minutes. They brought out a complimentary pizza slice. Cool. Don't say one thing and expect me to expect something else. Won't be coming back. If you like being lied to I suggest you don't come here either. Horrible
Krysteen R.,"Los Banos, CA",161,34,16,4.0,5/19/2014,I know it's just another chain restaurant but I really had a nice dinner here with my bf the other night. Everyone was friendly and our server was knowledgeable of the menu and very attentive to our needs without being overbearing. The standouts of our meal was the fried artichoke appetizer and my Peachy Keen Sangria!
Joshua H.,"Portland, OR",0,33,1,1.0,11/6/2013,"Sitting at the bar with 3 parties, all have waited double as orders are messed up. Food and beer get 3 stars, bartender is friendly but what the hell is with the service and communication here????"
Pom H.,"Travis Air Force Base, CA",24,7,,5.0,4/19/2014,"The Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps was superb.  I'm Thai and I generally cook Thai food. This just taste almost authentic. A little more fish sauce and fresh chili pepper it would taste like ""home.""  Their beer is fresh obviously coming directly from their brew. I got their Imperial Stout & it was so smooth, rich, full bodied, complex with a hint of cocoa sweetness. Great service, very pleasant interior design, cool atmosphere and attractive waitresses. Coming back the next day for brunch."
Meli H.,"Bloomington, IN",0,17,1,4.0,5/13/2014,"We love this place! I originally expected a BW3's type place, but BJ's is definitely a notch above. The menu has something for everyone and we've never ordered anything we did not enjoy! Even with a party of nine over the holidays, everyone was happy :)"
Jamie S.,"Vacaville, CA",27,53,13,4.0,8/21/2013,"I always love bjs the food is amazing. My favorite appetizer is their mini burcetta their good by themselves but the sause that comes with puts it over the top! The staff is soso usally lookin over workd and tired, I dont blame them though the place is huge and packed. Best part of the night my sister left her phone and the staff saved it for her, asked her questions to make sure it was hers and we got it back safe and sound."
Michael D.,"Sacramento, CA",0,9,,5.0,7/19/2014,Great menu. Good food. I had the  pork chops. Excellent!
Doug G.,"Kodak, TN",10,98,,5.0,12/13/2013,The Thai chicken salad was very good.  My wife had a pizza and we loved it also.  The service was spot on.  We will be going back again.
Bryndel T.,"Napa, CA",11,1,,1.0,10/25/2013,The hostes told us 15-25min wait . We waited over an hour to be seated. When we were seated it took 15 min to even get acknowledge. The group of people next to us who was seated after us had drinks and appetizers before our server even uad notice us. The drinks took a long time and our calamari was cold an not good . They brought my food out 15min before everybody else at the table . So since I was finished before everybody I ordered a dessert. Not only did I not get it the waitress told me they gave it away and would take another 15min . After being in the restaurants for over 2 hrs  I had enough. I will never go to this place again !!!! One star isn't even deserved
Charla A.,"Sacramento, CA",564,240,92,2.0,7/24/2011,"I don't know it is about BJ's that everyone continues to have their birthday dinners there... it's overpriced, super loud, and not even crackin'.  Went here for my bf's first time.. was excited for him, even told the waitress but she didn't seem to care *heartbreak hotel*  got the pizza.. was okay. got a sandwich .. that was okay too.  I am looking forward to trying Yardhouse."
Matt H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",23,22,,3.0,5/4/2014,"Avocado egg rolls get a five star. Most of the other appetizers are just kind of ok, typical bar food. Can't really tell you how the main dishes are because it's a brewery (kind of)...I go there to drink, not get filled up on food. But the main reason you should be going here is for beer, right? Well tell me BJ's, how come every time I come here and try to order beer your servers tell me, 'We don't have that right now. We're out of stock of that beer too. Oh yeah, I'll check but I think we're out of that one too.' I end up drinking beer the servers push on me that I really didn't want. Even your own brewed beer you guys manage to run out of frequently! That shouldn't be happening. Servers have been good...not bad, not great."
