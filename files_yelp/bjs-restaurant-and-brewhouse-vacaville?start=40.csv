Dale D.,"Vacaville, CA",8,16,,2.0,12/1/2017,"Food was ok, but the service was horrible.   Entree served before salad!    No attention to even refill water glasses..  server preoccupied, obviously not with the customer"
Darrell P.,"Dana Point, CA",951,822,15121,4.0,1/31/2016,"My friend, NB, called me up Friday afternoon, asked if I wanted to get together...""Happy Hour? Well, twist my arm!"" It has been a while since we last visited, figured it was time to catch up and ""talk story."" This is the first time I've been to this particular BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse since moving from SoCal/South Orange County. I used to frequent their Lake Forest location @ the Laguna Hills Mall quite often, good times, and service was always great. Met NB just around 4:45pm, there were a few open spots in the bar area which is on a, ""First come, first serve,"" basis. Not to mention it's the Happy Hour ""Fun Zone!"" (i.e. - Only the bar area qualifies for the HH Specials) - ""Well, hell... 'Twist my arm, again."" Happy Hour Specials -  The bar had no open stools so NB and I grabbed a table directly across from it.  Photo -  We looked over the drink menu and I thumbed through it looking for something I saw the other week @ Buffalo Wild Wings, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer."" (5.9% alcohol)  Patrice our waitress, stellar. She was very friendly, good energy, upbeat, and trés helpful... 'Not to mention, patient. NB was split between the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Egg Rolls, two very tempting appetizers. Like me, NB is from Hawaii, I added, ""DO NOT expect it to be like da kine we get back on da aina, the poke here is haolified, dressed up with extra sh'tuff... Kinda like a hooker on Kuhio Avenue."" (Well, at least that's what I've heard... Oh, and Business avenue too.) So, the Avocado Egg Roll Appetizers it was! Me, pizza of course! 'Unless there's sushi, then it's sushi... 'AND pizza!! If they could find a way to make a pizza/sushi fusion dish, that would be awesome! They could call it ""P'ushi!"" I could eat p'ushi all night... 'And it's always good the next morning too! The mini deep dish pizzas are  1/2 off for Happy Hour, great deal. I decided on the Gourmet Five Meat Pizza w/added jalapeños & garlic, for good measure.  Patrice stopped by our table to take our drink orders as NB and I were deciding on what to eat. I asked her if BJ's carried, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer?"" Unfortunately, as I presumed, the answer was no... 'BUT they did have BJ's very own, ""Irish Root Beer."" Menu -  'With a description like that, I was sold! Shortly after placing our order, Patrice came by and apologized but she was being moved to cover another section of the bar and that Zahs was going to be covering our table. I have to admit, a part of me was bummed to see Patrice go, she rocked!  The order: Avocado Egg Rolls (HH Price: $8.95) - Okay; good portions Photo -  Mini Gourmet 5 Meat Deep Dish Pizza (HH Price: $6.63) - Tasty; generous toppings; good HH value Photo -  Irish Root Beers x2 (HH Price: $7.50 x2) - Hot damn!; great; good HH value Photo -  Grand total w/tip: $40 Overall, the food was good. Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed in the Avocado Egg Roll appetizers. I was hoping for more than oversized, meatless taquitos. However, in this case the guacamole IS the filling. I know it's a crowd favorite but I just found it to be okay. NB, on the other hand, kinda dug it. (Shrugs) I expected nice size chunks of avocado, not this mushy, green purée.  Photo -  Now, for the $$, the HH Special on BJ's mini pizzas are pretty hard to beat. I prefer my food to have a bit of kick, added jalapeños and garlic, please... 'No linguicia on the menu, not too many places carry Portuguese Sausage. I requested extra sauce as well but do no think it found its way on the pizza, not a deal breaker. I enjoyed the pizza much more than the appetizer. Photo -  Now, the Irish Root Beer was pretty damn awesome!... It could've used a tad more Jameson, Baileys, and Butterscotch Schnapps but nonetheless it was DEEE'LICIOUS! After a couple of sips, I told NB to wait a moment before finishing the drink. I was able to flag down Zahs, ""May I have two shots of bar cream?"" Irish Root Beer + One shot of bar cream = One fine adult root beer float (For the kid in all of us!) Photo -  3  1/2 stars (Rounding up) Make it Great! - Big Aloha! Food: 3 Ambiance: 3+ Service: 4 Value: 4"
Miranda L.,"Sacramento, CA",259,5,2,1.0,6/25/2017,I placed an order for take out with special instructions to not cook in butter nor add seasoning. My chicken was doused in butter and my asparagus was overly seasoned with salt and pepper. I feel like they should have made sure the order was correct or showed it to me before bagging it. I usually enjoy eating at this restaurant only when dining in. I'm very disappointed with this experience.
James W.,"Vacaville, CA",5,55,322,5.0,8/16/2016,"Nice location.  Lots of parking. Very nice ambience.  The staff all smile like they are happy to serve you and happy to work there!  Service is seconds away. I had the tortilla soup after work on a MOnday--bowl was $ 6.25 and only 280 calories.  That meant I could have a beer.  Opted for a pint of PM Porter, 5.5 % alcohol and cost only $ 6.25. Didn't get my waitress's name, but she was great!  See my pics. Very highly recommend!"
Steve B.,"McCordsville, IN",5,8,2,1.0,5/18/2017,"I can't believe the experience I just had in this place.  We sat down at about 6:40, and granted, it was busy.  Our waiter took our order at about 6:45.  Brought our drinks a couple of minutes later.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  After 25 minutes of nothing, I asked a greeter if she could send someone, anyone over to our table.  After 40 minutes, we got our first drink refills, and we were told that our order had been ""completely lost"".  No explanation, not even a ""Sorry"".  I asked for the manager to come over.  After about 10-15 more minutes.  Finally the manager came over and said ""Sorry folks.  The kitchen lost your order.  I can have them start over.""  We had to be somewhere, so we didn't have time to wait.  He then ""generously"" offered to let us have our drinks for free.  Really!? Nothing else.  No sincere apology, no offers to make it right, nothing.   We were there for an hour and got no food at all.  Really terrible service and no one even seemed to really care.   I like the food here, but rest assured, we will never go back to that location."
June P.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/7/2017,"This place has gone to shit! Cold spongy pizza. Tasted and looked like it was a frozen pizza thrown into a microwave. When we got the pizza, the cheese wasn't even melted. Either the servers can't take orders correctly or the cooks can't read but we got toppings we didn't want. You would think the manager would come and apologize for the terrible service but nope. What manager? I don't know what happened to this place but I am never coming back."
David R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,18,,2.0,7/31/2017,"Eating at BJ's in Vacaville can be summed up in Elisabeth Kübler-Ross's 5 Stages of Grief. Denial - ""BJ's will be better this time"" ""The service last time was a fluke, no way will be there for 3 hours again!"" ""The hour and half wait it took my server to bring my check last time wasn't so bad"", ""They have a $10 off coupon on their app!"". At this point you have convinced your friends/family to go to Bj's. Anger - It's happened again, you gave BJ's the benefit of the doubt, now you've been there for 3 hours. Your Friends and Family are angry at you because ""YOU WERE THE ONE WANTED TO GO TO BJ'S!"", and ""This is why we don't come here anymore"". Bargaining - The guilt of choosing BJ's for Dinner makes you lose your appetite at this point, your friends hate you, your wife wants to divorce you, your 7 year old Daughter wants to move out. You try and win them over by offering a Pizookie or telling them ""We won't come here anymore""(even though we both know it's a lie.), ""You can choose where we eat next time, just stop hating me!"". Depression - Everyone hates you because you brought them to a 21st century concentration camp known as BJ's. Your dinner party is ignoring you as they sit staring into their phones at the table. Now that your server has cashed you out, the shackles have been lifted you're free to leave. Tonight you will sleep cold, and lonely for you have chose poorly. Acceptance - You've accepted that you thought BJ's had changed but you were wrong they will NEVER change! You Need to be the one to change!"
Sonja P.,"Benicia, CA",158,110,182,2.0,2/26/2017,"Alright the food is a bit better here than any others I've been to around the Bay Area.  The waiters/waitresses are really nice and are attentive.  However, the hostess and whoever the runner is to seat people are never really nice.  These are the people who  set the welcome scene but these snobs just don't even give any type of salutation nor eye contact.  Why patronize any establishment that does not make you feel welcome?"
Nicole A.,"Vacaville, CA",60,13,1,1.0,10/2/2017,"The worst service. Be prepared to wait at least an hour. We waited 30 min for chips and guacamole. When the food finally came, it was cold and soggy. I let the waitress know only to have us talk to the manager which I wasn't looking forward to doing since I saw the way he was treating the hosts when we came in. Wasn't even looking for a comp, but if the food is $15 and inedible, you have to say something... he was rude about it which was to be expected  seriously not worth the wait. Done going to this place after being treated that way."
Alan N.,"Vacaville, CA",0,53,,3.0,12/2/2017,Nothing fancy or mind blowing.  Good food and okay prices.  I will eat here again but it's not one of my Top Ten favorites.
Julie H.,"Travis Air Force Base, CA",21,5,2,1.0,9/1/2017,Our first experience was not good. Extremely long wait and we were charged for items that were supposed to be free. Tried them again today and were once again charged for more than we ordered. My husband ordered 2 drinks and we were charged for 3. Of course we didn't realize it until we got home but the first time they said they couldn't do anything about it since the sale was already done. We won't be going back.
S C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,19,5,1.0,7/30/2016,"Wow very dissatisfied,  not what I'm used too here . Rushed through service. Corey was terrible server hope you do not get his table."
Miranda S.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/4/2017,My friend and I really like BJs so we came here on Friday Aug 25 for my birthday dinner. We are not from this area and were just visiting my friends family. When we arrived that night the first host with light brown hair that was coordinating was extremely friendly and tried her best to accommodate us. The girl  with dark brown hair and a massive attitude that was seating us finally came back to the host stand.  The first girl told us she would be seating us right now so we stood up. The dark haired brunette girl looked at us. Didn't speak and literally started walking away. We assumed that meant follow her. She literally raced her way over to the table she was taking us to and left us behind. Before we even got to the table she threw the menus down and walked back to the host stand. Thank you?  My friend and I used to be hosts at a different restaurant. We know AT THE LEAST say hi. If they were busy at the host stand I would understand but we were the only ones up there.  The server was friendly. We did like her. We saw she had a lot of tables so we didnt want to be difficult and ask for a lot. The part that annoyed me was she ended up offering us a free pizookie we didnt ask for. So we just said okay. She never came back with it and just handed us the check. The server was fine we assumed she was just busy and forgetful but please don't offer something and then never come back.
JoNeal H.,"Redding, CA",16,18,10,5.0,8/19/2017,Great food! Pazookies are amazing! I got some Thai rice noodle dish. It was really good. Hubby got the prime rib and loved it!
Diomedes L.,"Roseville, CA",229,182,2464,4.0,11/1/2015,"Ah a quick lunner With my sister after practicing at her home, she invited me to go out for lunch/dinner.   As usual BJ franchise, it's a sports and grill bar.  We were very surprised  to get seated right away.  On the normal, they register your name and give a pager, and the usual wait would be at least 5-10 min.  I had times that you wait 45-50 mins.  That's how crowded and popular it is here.  This location is also at Vacaville , so you have the shoppers and travelers eat here.  Sunday's are usually packed (or so I think) but I guess we got lucky. I had the 14 ounce top sirloin with rice pilaf and broccoli.  It was pretty good. And prior to that my sister order some buffalo wings for appetizer.  That was very tasty.   The only thing I can address to this is our server took a bit awhile to get us our order and then took awhile to get our food / drinks .   But all in all it was a good"
Sam M.,"Dixon, CA",6,10,,4.0,9/7/2017,"My wife had a late doctor's appointment, so we stopped by for dinner on the way home. My wife is on a special diet, and typically gets stuck ordering a salad or bunless burger. She asked our waitress (Nicole B) if they could do a deep dish pizza without the crust. She checked and said absolutely. When our food came out, her pizza came with the crust. My wife said she would just take the toppings off, but Nicole wouldn't hear of it. She made them make it as she had instructed. This was the first time, in a long timr, we were really happy with the service and attentiveness we received.  Thank you Nicole B for the great service!"
Sam M.,"Tacoma, WA",3,174,301,4.0,8/22/2016,"Good food, good service, plenty of seating, clean bathrooms, multiple Tv's playing sports channels. They do have a full bar area as well."
Alyssa F.,"Vacaville, CA",49,7,,1.0,11/22/2017,"Honestly this places service has gone completely downhill. Had to wait over 20min for someone to take my DRINK order let alone introduce us at all, waited even longer to order food which took another 30 minutes AND THE FOOD WAS COLD. NEVER ONCE GOT THE HINT TO REFILL MY DRINK UNTIL I GOT A BUSSERS ATTENTION. Managers need to start retraining or letting go of the servers who can't handle 5 tables- let alone serve decent food."
Jon N.,"Vacaville, CA",71,3,,1.0,8/19/2017,"This was the worst experience I have ever had at this venue. First, we were not provided any silverware. Next, our server vanished and didn't return for an hour. Finally, we were cheated out of money when the incompetent waiter over charged us. Never, ever, returning."
Curtis F.,"Vacaville, CA",246,2,,5.0,5/13/2017,Bjs in Vacaville is always a fun spot to meet with friends. Food is bomb. Beer is even better!
