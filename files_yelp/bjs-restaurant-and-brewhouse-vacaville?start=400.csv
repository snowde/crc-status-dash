Mellissa D.,"Vacaville, CA",227,49,48,4.0,8/9/2014,"Today we are here for a pre-birthday lunch for my hubby.  BJ's is above average brew house food. I like that they offer a healthy menu, but let's be honest here, you aren't here for the baked salmon....you are here for the avocado egg rolls, the deep dish pizza, and the beer. They brew their own beer, root beer and cream soda! One of my favorite drinks from the bar is the Irish Root Beer. It's life changing hahaha. Their menu is constantly changing and adding fun, seasonal offerings. It's really hard to get to the main menu because the appetizers are so good.  Today, we tried the watermelon mojito, the carne asada fries, and the fritos nachos from the seasonal menu. The mojito was too sweet, but had fresh watermelon in it, which was nice. The asada fries were our favorite and I hope they make it to the regular menu forever. The fritos nachos were good, but I thought it could have used a little bit more chips for all the toppings, as well as a lot less sour cream on top. We also had their Tatonka stout which is a little sweeter and toastier than a Guinness. Their Berry Burst Cider is excellent and refreshing. It's gluten free for those that need to watch out for that like me. BJs also offers gluten free pizza and an entire gluten free menu. The pizza is one of the better gluten free pizzas I've had, as long as the crust is crispy and not undercooked. The pizookie is the real reason everyone comes here. They are all amazing and they even have a gluten free chocolate chip pizookie. Save room for it!!!! Service is almost always great. We have had, in the past, a couple bad experiences, but management has bent over backwards to make it right. It's pretty loud so don't go there expecting to have a quiet conversation. There are several  TVs with a variety if sports games on at all times. Overall a good spot for a casual meal and drink."

Dianne J.,"Phenix City, AL",1,37,7,1.0,5/8/2011,"This is for their TO-GO service. I'm very disappointed because I love BJ's food but we recently had a baby and had no choice but to avoid dining in since our little one gets so fussy. We really wanted to eat there so we decided to try their to-go online ordering. I'm very impressed that they have online ordering since I hate talking on the phone BUT just because you can't see, hear or wait on me doesn't mean that a paying customer deserves crappy food. My husband and I ordered the same things that we always do and found everything to be sub-par. The kid's mac and cheese was extremely bland. The vegetables in the Atlantic salmon dish were very undercooked. They are normally very soft but this time they were crunchy. My husband's usual custom pizza was missing it's basil pesto, which normally is cooked underneath the cheese. The waitress brought it to the chef and he just squirted it on top of the pizza. It looked like squirts of green poo here and there. When she returned the pizza she told my husband that she didn't know what else to do. Considering the fact that it was $2.00 extra (for an already $20 medium pizza) we were very disappointed. When we got home and tried it, it was no better than it looked. As my husband says ""it looks like a green elf pooped on it."" I hate to bash BJ's but they would never give this kind of service in-restaurant so why would to-go be any different?"
Angelina O.,"Antioch, CA",158,119,84,2.0,8/6/2013,"Had dinner tonight and everything started w/ a nice hostess seating us, waitress comes up promptly and takes our drink order and we ended up ordering ceasar salad and pepperoni & mushroom deep dish pizza. It comes up looking less than acceptable, hardly any toppings, burnt cheese all on the top of the pizza crust & just didn't look the best. So because my husband was payin $30 I told the waitress how the pizza looked. She says she will talk to the manager to see what could be done...waitress comes back and says meal can't be comped but we will give you a little discount...after this her service just wasn't good, we had to ask for refills, took forever to take away the dirty dishes . After she got us a togo box, she drops the check and walks away no thank you, have a good night,  nothing! !!! Bj's in brentwood is the best.  I won't go back to this location again."
Judi K.,"San Francisco, CA",93,200,69,4.0,6/14/2009,"Fastfood chains, but they brew their own beer and root beer! That's an extra star from me.  The pizza we had were the deep dish ones, BBQ chicken and BJ's special.  Not bad, but the crust is definitely not the buttery kind. I miss UNO's.  But BJ's GREAT for groups! There were 12 of us after the graduation party. So we ordered 2 medium pizzas, 1 santa fe salad, spinach dip, nachos, and the avacado spring roll. Total bill came to be $119 with tax and tip! Worth it.  Think of it like the cheese cake factory with out the cheesecakes."
Daniel H.,"Concord, CA",262,226,15,3.0,11/28/2009,"This is a decent chain restaurant, with some decent nutritious choices, as well as some amazingly horrible dishes, calorie-wise. The main problem is the wait. If you don't call ahead, you're faced with a 25-50 minute wait at least. The upside to that is, the restaurant often offers complimentary pizza slices to the crowd in front  It's very loud, and very crowded. However, the food is decent and worth the wait, unless you're allergic to gluten. In that case, you probably should go elsewhere, as there's only one or two choices on the menu for you. The best part is the pizookie dessert. It is the size of their mini pizza, and comes in four different flavors. Their triple chocolate pizookie is ridiculously good, and they offer a sampler pizookie now that is great for those who can't make up their minds. Better than most chain restaurants, and definitely better than the TGI Friday's across the parking lot!"
Sueanne P.,"Davis, CA",6,31,,3.0,2/17/2011,"Hmm I'm not sure how to rate this place. I seriously left feeling indifferent. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The pictures on the site makes it look SUPER good! I spent the night before just gazing at all the pictures, imagining what I'd order. The calamari was crispy and light. It's served with a side of marinara sauce and ranch (go for the ranch =) ). The western deep dish pizza was, sad to say, too doughy and the toppings were scarce. If you've read my other reviews, yes this is another dish that needs, no requires!, some spice. If you get a deep dish, try asking them to cook it a little longer than usual, so the crust is especially crispy. By the time the fries came, I was pretty full, but they were really pillowy and crisp.  I didn't get any dessert, but I will for sure next time because it smelled super good! Major plus is the variety. I think anyone can find something they like on the menu. OH and the decor was really cool and the service is friendly."
Kori M.,"Daytona Beach, FL",79,296,167,4.0,12/11/2013,"The food here is very good and there is a LOT to choose from. The menu is huge. They also have a great lunch menu.  The prices are a bit on the higher side and in the evenings, there is normally a bit of a wait....but that is a good sign. The bleu cheese burger is awazing!"
D C.,"Dublin, CA",12,76,76,3.0,1/8/2012,"Stopped into bj's restaurant while heading home from a weekend in Tahoe. We were rushing to get back and got seated quickly. After telling our waitress we were in a rush, she said she'd do her best to get our order right away. I got a turkey burger with fries and my cousin got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. The turkey burger was very juicy and topped with lots of avocado.  My cousin's BBQ pulled pork sandwich was a little salty, and the BBQ sauce wasn't sweet enough to complement the pork. Although the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was disappointing, their homemade orange cream soda was great! I give it 3 stars because they got our order out quickly and the service was good, but disappointed with one of two dishes."
Cedric T.,"Vacaville, CA",73,6,3,4.0,6/6/2014,"Good choice on food, a lot to choose from. Waiters are nice and are patient. Only bad part is the t.v's are kinda small and far away but when you're with family, it's a great restaurant to dine at."
Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",743,2526,266,3.0,11/1/2011,"Haven't been back to this branch in years, but lunch with my friend last week was pretty good!  I'm appreciating the general trend towards healthier eating in many restaurant chains right now and BJ's is no exception.  I gave the Chicken a la Fresca on the ""Enlightened Entrees"" a go and it wasn't bad - chicken was solid and the portion was plenty.  Our waitress did a nice job too and I was impressed that one of the other staff came to offer a taste of New Belgium's Hoptober Golden Ale after I found out that they no longer had their Oktoberfest around."
Rosanne D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",60,89,21,2.0,11/10/2011,"Came in for lunch last Saturday while shopping with the girls & Mom near the Vacaville outlets--seemed like a place where there was something for everyone...unfortunately that something was lackluster food and ambivalent service.  I am not sure why I bothered expecting more.  Seriously?  This is a chain restaurant that acts like it. The place was bombastically loud and crazy busy.  One might think, ""they are busy, they must be doing something right?""  Well that totally disregards the fact that there isn't much in the way of sophisticated dining or much of a ""local"" food movement in this particular area.  It is the land of sub par, industrial complex food.  If you don't mind being a number,  mindlessly eating plasticky undoubtedly microwaved food,  served by femme-bot MTV spring break wannabes sporting bizzare make up, this is the place for you.  The fact that they publish the inexplicable number of calories for each dish is commendable, but certainly caused me to have even more doubts about their food. How can you possibly pack 1200 calories into a salad, unless you glaze each piece of lettuce with lard?  The one slightly redeeming aspect to my BJ's experience was the gluten free pie-zookie.  That was nice, EXCEPT for the fact that the vanilla ice cream was clearly over processed and had a vaguely chemical aftertaste.  Oh well...no surprises here."
Bob L.,"Vacaville, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/9/2013,"My wife and I thought we would beat the Friday night  crowd and go to BJ's at 5:00.  New York strip was full of fat, burnt solid black on the outside, and bloody in the middle. She ordered it medium well, her mistake  she should have asked for it raw, but the COOK would probably have screwed that up too! The fries were cold and very dry. It appears they were left over from lunch!  Mahi tacos had an off taste, and nasty sauce all over them! It took twenty five minutes for our food to arrive.  You would think when the waitress sees your plate Is full, and youre asking for the check that a light would go off. Oh well that's $65.00  bucks I WON'T EVER SPEND THERE AGAIN!"
Jim D.,"Oakland, CA",584,702,412,2.0,12/14/2008,"If it were not for the football screens I would not have waited at BJ's (Good name, catchy). Order the avocado roll which was roll and stuffed with a terayaki sauce $9.50. When our avocados worth that much? Are you kidding, it was not a crab avocado sushi roll. Ordered the Santa Fe salad with the blackened salmon as the main entree $12.50. The Santa Fe seasoning tending to drown out the blackened salmon so my taste buds were totally confused. Plus they put corn in my salad, that is soooo trailer trashy. Not even Home Buffet does that. I should have ordered the garden medley for the salad. Never trust a waitress who does not eat prawns or fish. She probably did not know what it should really taste like. Next time it is a beer and a burger at the open bar watching the screens showing football. Thats it, no waiting for me."
Paul M.,"San Francisco, CA",44,6,,2.0,2/25/2015,"It is shame I need to write a bad review. When I originally arrived I was greeted warmly and directed to take a seat in the cocktail lounge since I was a single diner. After retrieving my own menu, I ordered a beer and began to page through the vast menu. I ordered a flatbread and corn fritter appetizer. The corn fritter was burned and had with very little aioli. The flatbread was as expected. The shame is truly the service. The place was adequately staffed for a Wed night but the servers can't get their act together. After two different servers asked me within a minute of each other if I was ready to order when I clearly just sat down you would think they would take my order when ready. Nope, had the menu closed and took them a good 10 minutes to come and take my order. While I was eating I got the obligatory walk by to see if I needed anything. But when I was obviously finished with my meal and ready to order dessert (plates pushed away, dessert menu opened) the staff just walked by and my server stood at the next table chatting while I waited another 15 minutes for the other server to be directed to my table.   Pretty sad service for a Wed night. I won't be back."
Juan A.,"Lansing, MI",64,298,134,5.0,10/30/2011,This has to be my all time favorite late night restaurant!! I love every single one of their dishes and their beers are just great!! If you don't know where to go to eat or drink and you are close by don't think about it twice; you can never go wrong with BJ's
Jessica W.,"Vallejo, CA",0,91,7,1.0,9/12/2014,"I have been to BJ's in a few different locations (Concord being the best experience so far) and this was by far the worst experience we had. We were seated almost immediately but in the very first table next to the hostess booth. It took forever to get our drinks and appetizer. We mentioned to the staff it was my sons first birthday, being a restaurant they usually have something fun to do, especially for my little guys 1st! No, nothing. we told them and they said cool want a (dessert)? We said sure, waited 25 minutes then finally got up and left our waiter made eye contact then HAD to speak to us and asked ""oh they never brought it out? I am sorry, have a good night!"" really? Could have offered to get it for us yourself..i don't know, because you are the waiter! Horrible service however, the hostess (s) was very nice."
Joe H.,"Berkeley, CA",322,33,3,5.0,10/11/2011,"I am absolutely giving BJ's five stars. Here's why: I love BJ's. Full bar, fun environment, diverse crowd, and GOOD FOOD... Omg LOVE their food. Been here countless times. I went recently with some friends, and we ordered an appetizer, a pizza, and a few drinks. After waiting about 30-40 minutes without receiving anything, I asked the waitress, ""Heyyyy, how bout that appetizer?"" She apologized and brought it out no more than 5 minutes later, clarifying upon delivery that it would NOT be on our tab due to the delay. Sweeeeet! We also ordered a half Great White and half BJ's Favorite pizza. When they brought the pizza out, it was a bit tepid and I swear a quarter of the pizza was nothing but dough and sauce... After the appetizer debacle, I was weary of bringing this to our waitress' attention (I hate seeming bitchy or like I'm trying to get free food), so one of my friends did. She sent the manager over at that point, who was extremely professional and responsive. He said that he knew we got a ""great white that wasn't that great,"" and because of it he was going to comp the entire PIZZA TOO. What the... Totally unexpected. I'm not giving BJ's five stars because they gave us free dinner. I'm giving BJ's five stars because despite the fact that this ONE time our food took too long, and wasn't stellar quality, they made good on it and we left happy. That speaks volumes. Big ups to BJ's."
Jennifer B.,"Oakland, CA",55,112,9,2.0,2/26/2011,"I only come here when I am forced.  For some reason my brother enjoys it, but I have never had an enjoyable experience.     On a Friday night, it is PACKED.  So either make reservations or plan on spending at least an hour waiting.  I am vegan so my options are very limited.  But, just because I am vegan doesn't mean that my dishes should be BLAND.  I ordered the veggie pizza and it came out with hardly any veggies on it.  Seriously, it just wasn't even worth the money for pizza crust.  My husband got the spaghetti with marinara sauce and he also commented on how bland it was. The hostesses are kind of lame.  I understand it gets busy but that doesn't give you a right to be rude.  That's your job, so you should learn to put a smile on your face and suck it up.   On the other hand our server was AWESOME.  He is the only thing that kept me from giving this place 1 star."
Erica Z.,"Visalia, CA",75,100,76,4.0,7/15/2013,"We came with a group of seven on a Saturday evening around 6:30. I expected a long wait but we were seated in about 5 minutes. I believe our waitress was named  Shobhan. She was great!! I knew she was super busy but it didn't affect her service to us. Also, I really appreciated that she didn't mind that a couple of our group were a few minutes late. I try not do that at restaurants out of respect for the wait staff but this time was a little out of my hands. As for the food and drink: my husband and I shared the choose 8 beer sampler. We liked most everything we tried, blondes to stouts ;-) For dinner I had the chili cheese burger. I LOVED IT!!!! The patty itself was tasty and it was accompanied by plenty of chili. I choose the thin cut fries as my side and really liked those. My hubby choose the jalapeño burger. He liked that a lot too, but I'll leave the review for that up to him :-) All in all, good service and a good meal!!"
