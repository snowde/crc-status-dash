Arren R.,"Vacaville, CA",8,7,,1.0,2/14/2014,Although you can get a decent meal there is a long wait for it. The service is horrible and I wouldn't recommend this place if you are hungry and expect service in a timely manner
Scott M.,"El Sobrante, CA",2,14,,1.0,1/10/2015,"I have been to a number of BJ's throughout the Bay Area and I have to say I had one of the worst experiences I have had in a restaurant period at this location. I have never really had issues with service at any other BJ's but for some reason the service here is atrocious. We went on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. It was relatively busy but I wouldn't say they were slammed. In our section there were a couple of waitresses but for some reason neither of them would acknowledge us. We sat and sat and Sat hoping that one of them would stop by our table but neither of them did. They seated a couple after us who got serviced before us and was seated right behind our table. When the waitress proceeded to take their order I flagged her down and asked her if she would take our order and get us some water. Her response to me was that it wasn't her section. When she came back with the other tables waters and spoke to her again and she begrudgingly took our order. We had been sitting for 20 MINUTES at this point. The waitress really acted like we were bothering her. When we got our food another 30 mins later, the food we usually get from other BJ's didn't taste or look anything we had got from there before. I honestly like BJ's as a restaurant and I frequent the one in Concord a lot because it is near my job. I will NEVER go back to this location again  unless I am feeling depressed about myself and would like to feel like a second class citizen."
Laura C.,"Napa, CA",0,8,2,1.0,3/25/2013,"Ordered take out--sliders and the pulled pork sandwich, plus two sodas. I went in to get it and almost fainted when they told me how much it was. Twenty-eight bucks?!? Really!??! Okay, so it must be good, right? Uh. No. Well, maybe it is good, but I don't think they finished our order. I had to return to the counter twice. First, they forgot one of our order of fries. Then I realized they'd forgotten my coleslaw and returned again.  For my trouble, they offered me a drink. But I had already ordered two ginormous (really, do we all need that much soda??) drinks, so that was useless. And it costs them, what, 5 cents? I was, well, insulted by this paltry attempt to give me a ""good customer experience.""  The pork sandwich was simply pulled pork on a soggy bun. I think it was supposed to have other stuff on it. My husband was to the point of not caring, so if they forgot something on his sliders, he didn't mention it. I also noticed he only ate one of them, and I also threw out half of my sandwich.  This is my second experience at BJs and the first, at the Roseville location, was equally unremarkable. Actually, now that I think back, I think I found one of the appetizers so gross I wouldn't eat it.  In general: Quantity over quality seems to be the rule of the day, and their service is somewhere between mediocre and disastrous."
Heather A.,"Redding, CA",15,124,25,4.0,4/11/2013,"Love BJ's!!! This experience was awesome!!! Totally yummy & got our entire order correct, which has often not happened at BJ's.... Great experience!!!!"
Manda W.,"Pacheco, CA",265,21,74,5.0,8/9/2010,"I have been a fan of BJ's since the one at Sun Valley Mall in Concord opened but have yet to try the one in Vacaville. Until now that is. Make sure when you go to this location ask if Joanna N. is working. She has to be the most friendliest and down to earth server I have ever met. She has a very bubbly personailty and she is very cute so you can't miss her !!  The food was great as always and we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get seated, which is good for this place. The wait can easily be anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Totally worth it though. Love this place !!"
Bing D.,"San Francisco, CA",153,472,65,4.0,3/17/2013,"i've found that i have to park around the side or over across at the other restaurants parking spaces.  its just that busy. So everytime i've come here.  ITS SO BUSY I have to wait.  I HATE WAITING! The food is great.  Like at ALL BJ'S BREWHOUSES! The wait here is horrible.  Its just so darn busy on the weekends. I love the pizookies.  The hamburgers.  THEIR ROOT BEER IS A MUST TRY!!!! They make pizza.  They have stir fried everything. THis is very general because I forgot what else we ordered because LIKE I SAID, ITS SO BUSY!!!!  I was too focused on how long it took.   It isn't their fault they're busy...they're good."
Angelica M.,"Oakland, CA",331,139,24,4.0,3/22/2013,We always come here at the end of our Vball season and there's always something that goes wrong with our experience. Examples: the mgmt never changed the channel on the tv. Hockey during march madness just plain crazy!!!!! My friend's chips never arrived with her tacos. They made a mini pizookie when we order a large one.  But they did change my thin crust pizza to a deep dish after I made the mistake and ordered thin crust.
Susan M.,"Somerset, NJ",1,33,1,1.0,7/14/2014,Make sure you clarify with your server what type of wine you want or they'll charge you $10 a glass for what seemed like the most expensive one on the list. Very disappointed upon seeing the cost of our bill.
Terry M.,"Fairfield, CA",212,24,,5.0,2/23/2011,"I was first introduced to BJ's Chicago Style pizza at one of the original BJ's on the beach at Laguna Beach. I was hooked. Only problem, there weren't any others around. Then they built one in Brea, CA where the company headquarters I worked for was and I find it was the first Brewhouse version and it was just awesome. Living in Northern California, we now have one in Vacaville that I can go to anytime I want, and I want to often. I love BJ's BBQ Chicken Pizza. It's off-the-chart good. All their pizza's are delicious. I've tried many of their salads and have ordered often. The Sourdough Burger is sooooo good and those seasoned fries never last because I have to eat them first. I'm only one third of the way through the menu because I have to repeat items because I love them. And, one of my favorite desserts anywhere is the apple crisp with ice cream. . . OMG. Another true favorite is their fish tacos. I think they have the best fish tacos I have ever experienced and I've tried many. Since I have been to the Vacaville BJ's at least 20+ times, I have always had excellent service, excellent food and and enjoyable experience. I've also ordered take out many times with equal excellence. Bravo BJ's! Bravo Vacaville BJ's!"
Pamela W.,"Vacaville, CA",7,192,63,4.0,5/28/2013,"Sesame salad for lunch was great! Service lacking... Hubby and I had to ask for the 2 for $20 special last week- which is a soup or salad for both, share a med. pizza and share a pizookie. Pizza no longer served in the deep dish pan and it was doughy and sparse toppings! Disappointing! Go for lunch!"
S d.,"Vacaville, CA",0,38,,1.0,3/14/2014,"Appetizers arrived cold and after a long wait, within a minute several waiters arrived with both salads and entrees.  This is a shift manager issue,  Staff working hard, but there was no coordination.  The entrées were returned until we could finish our salads.  Were told entrees would be fresh made when brought out.  Did not appear so.  If you are going there for a special occasion; please pass. I hope this comment is seen; Yelp usually hides my comments...."
Patty R.,"Los Osos, CA",125,101,17,5.0,4/9/2013,We have not yet had a bad meal or bad service here. All the waitresses are on top of their table...drinks never empty.  I love the Irish root beer cocktail.   Fresh sweet and sour mix in the margaritas.  Had the southern fried chicken tonight.  Very good. We are pleased with the consistency we experience here!
Richard F.,"Rio Vista, CA",23,4,,2.0,1/10/2011,"The wait was atrocious. They quoted us ""a few minutes"" on the phone, but took a party of 13 an hour and a half to be seated for dinner. The food was great but the long wait (unexpected) is hard to overcome. Bottom line: Confirm your reservation."
Mz P.,"Chico, CA",0,35,11,5.0,2/6/2015,"We were given great service from Joshua O. We always stop at this place, when we come back from visiting family in San Francisco. The turkey burger with salad, that I ordered was delicious! My husband ordered the Thai chicken salad and loved it. Will definitely come back again!"
Jamie W.,"Sacramento, CA",181,12,7,4.0,5/30/2013,"pretty much everything I eat here is pretty good. Except one time when I had the giant stuffed potato the chicken one, I forget the actual menu item name. It's usually pretty good, but this time it wasn't. I guess you can't always expect perfection though... The Pazookie is the best!"
Nathan T.,"Union City, CA",269,247,434,5.0,3/30/2011,"Big ass portions. For the price, it's the best deal ever. I came up for a birthday thing, and I ended up ordering the Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta. It was cooked really well. I think I could have used a tad bit more sauce, but it still tasted great. I got the Root Beer that they brew in-house and it really is a whole lot different from the kind you get at the store. It's super creamy and delicious. I can't really say that the taste is different, but I guarantee that you'll find the texture to be different. Someone in our group ordered the Dark Cherry, and that was terrible. I'm not a fan of cough syrup, so I really disliked that drink.  Our waiter was very pleasant, and we ended up getting three complimentary personal pizookies in addition to the huge pizookie we ordered.  I also really love the environment. It's comparable to that of the Cheesecake Factory environment. Also, they have a crapton of TV's that always show sports games, so you can pretty much watch any game from any seat in the house."
Angie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",80,23,1,1.0,9/30/2013,"The hostess had no idea how to input my rewards. The waitress didn't even know the menu and my food was cold, my husbands pizza was hot. Bring a jacket cause the entire restaurant is freezing cold."
Ry T.,"San Francisco, CA",582,1509,1898,3.0,6/13/2010,"3.5 stars for the food but service was more like 4 stars.  We decided to drive south to eat here after sitting for over 2 hrs. for an indoor morning UC Davis commencement ceremony (I love graduations) and then another hour for pictures with the college grad and friends outside the ARC Pavilion.  The 13 of us were able to get a nice table in a corner after calling ahead. I was surprised to see how busy they still were at 2-3PM on a weekday. We were told by one of the May college grads who lives in Vacaville that the place is busy all the time.  I had their refillable clam chowder (it was good but salty) and Caesar salad (you get refills on both) which had a tad too much dressing but was good (no anchovies) :(  Lovely sister had the meatloaf lunch sandwich which was huge. It had a thick slice of meatloaf over French bread, topped with a scoop of mashed potato and smothered with way too much sauce. I couldn't believe she was eating that, and obviously couldn't finish.  Hubby had their crispy chicken sandwich which he said was 'good and different"". Our waiter was one of the nicest waiters I've ever encountered at a chain restaurant. He checked often with us and at the end even asked to let him know if there was more he could do for us and congratulated the graduate a couple of times. This guy deserves a promotion or recruitment to a fine dining restaurant."
Brian V.,"San Francisco, CA",90,250,230,4.0,4/25/2010,"Before I got that tag signifying elite hotboy status, I vowed I would never review chains.  I felt it a tad bit silly to be reviewing different chevron gas stations or macdos.  At the end of the day, we all know what chain and franchises bring to the table, yet, I am softening my stance a bit I had some appetizers yesterday at BJ's that were so wadDUUUP. There is no need to weave a tale about BJ's.  It is your quintessential Applebees/Chili's on steroids.  It is funny how dim lights can create a sense of elegance.  We ordered the string french fries, mac and cheese, mozzarella salad, kettle chips and avocado spring rolls.  Because I am going out of the norm in reviewing an establishment like this, I feel it does not deserve a tale of its own.  In its place will be a very precise, boring blurb. 1.  string french fries: very good, very thin and crispy. 2.  mac and cheese: i am a fan of mac n cheese however, it is something i feel should be smooth in consistency and texture.  BJ's deviated from the regular mac n cheese pasta for fusilli pasta which i was not a fan of.   3.  avocado spring rolls: classic dish...so simple yet so good...the honey something sauce is wadDUUP 4.  kettle chips: unique homemade chips....soft and thick potatoes served with aoli sauce and i think a blue ranch sauce 5.  mozzarella salad: first time i had fresh mozzarella balls...i am in love with it...best dish aside from the avacado springrolls, each dish was a new 2.95 bite sized special.  they are actually pretty generous in quality...i left full."
Denise B.,"San Francisco, CA",78,763,163,3.0,5/12/2010,"Well what would you know, I was back here recently with a bunch of now-former co-workers, celebrating the end of my internship and impending graduation. Whenever there's a retirement or other occasion, they seem to pick either Chevy's or BJ's to celebrate. I'm not a Chevy's fan, so I was glad we went here. The most memorable part of our meal was that someone in the back of the restaurant collapsed, and we got to see the chiseled fire department make a very daring rescue. Mmm. Other than that, BJ's remained... well, what you'd expect from here. The happy hour specials were ok ($1 off beers and cocktails), but our server was spacey and kept insisting we had to go order them up at the bar to get the discount. Finally she relented and got the discounted ones for us herself. She was also kind of hover-y and didn't seem too thrilled that we weren't ordering more food and booze, as well as that the table wasn't full thanks to some last-minute no-shows. That said, there was something on the menu (food and alcohol-wise) that made everyone happy in terms of personal tastes, budget, and caloric value, which confirmed my suspicion that BJ's is not a bad choice for a large group of potentially picky eaters, even though it might not be most people's first choice for a nice night out. Oh, and the other intern and I got free pizookies for being the guests of honor. Yum!"
