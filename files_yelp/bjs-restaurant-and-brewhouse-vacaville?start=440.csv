Ximeng W.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,123,596,4.0,12/27/2010,Perfect place for a get together with their Happy Hour Menu. Decent American food. But BOMB pizzookie.  I would come back just for the pizzokie.
Trice P.,"Vacaville, CA",9,53,81,3.0,9/10/2010,"Had dinner on a Wednesday night around 6:30 and was seated with no wait.  I know during the weekends it's another story. Would recomment the Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer.  Our entrees were Derek's Favorite Meatloaf sandwich and the prime rib.  Both were good, but would have been better without so much sauce.  For dessert, the apple crisp was good and would have been good to share for four people; two of us scarfed it down (pushed it to the limit). We had two servers and they were both pretty friendly.  The restaurant itself is kind of dark; lady in the booth next to us was using the light from her iPhone to read the menu. Because we live in Vacaville, we would definitely go here again.  But, wouldn't drive out of our way to come here if we lived somewhere else."
Marlon T.,"Reno, NV",1083,2364,1516,4.0,1/9/2009,"Come here for the pizza and the 7 beer sampler! If you come here, you have to try to the deep-dish pizza (whatever type you life) and/or the 7 beer sampler. For dessert, you absolutely must get a pizzookie. This is all you need for a good time at BJ's! (Sorry if you're no at least 21 years old) I am a fan of this place, I've been here multiple times, mainly for birthday parties. I feel that it is fairly priced and you get your monies worth. There's not that much to complain about this place. I've always gotten a table quick and the employees have always been nice, attentive, and courteous. The food isn't the best but it is good. I'd come here again for the beer. I would say this place is very similar to The Cheesecake Factory except replace the cheesecake with beer since they brew beer at BJ's. BJ's would be a nice place to go after a day shopping at the outlets nearby. Come as a couple or as a big group, this place is suitable."
Ian H.,"Eureka, CA",12,4,25,5.0,10/12/2013,25 people waiting outside means they are doing something very well. Secret! Call ahead wait list..
Stephanie G.,"Vacaville, CA",115,65,158,3.0,2/26/2011,"FYI, if the expected wait is over 50 min, I HIGHLY suggest keeping an eye out for the tables/booths at the bar area as they are first come first serve basis. This is what my husband and I did last night as we put our name down with the hostess but soon found out we were able to get a table at the bar area BEFORE our buzzer went off. This place seems like the ""hot spot"" for Solano County as this place is always busy. Which don't get me wrong is great for business but sucks for people who don't want to wait 50+ minutes for a table of 3.  During my last visit, my husband ordered a spinach & artichoke deep dish pizza which was DELICIOUS!!! Highly recommend for those who aren't in the mood for meat but want something filling. And of course we had to have a chocolate chip pizookie. I mean come on this is BJs, who are known for their own brand root beers, deep dish pizzas and pizookies!!! If you are a little adventurous, I also recommend their macadamia nut pizookie which is awesome! Or if you can't decide, then get the ""pizookie sampler"" where you get three (3) different flavored mini pizookies of your choice. It's also a great option for those who want to share!"
Trudy B.,"Dixon, CA",66,12,,1.0,6/7/2014,"I usually have a good lunch experience at Bjs , the service was slow and  the appetizer showed up after the meal . so we had them box up the lettuce rolls for dinner, Big mistake if you read the menu on the lettuce roll there is  suppose to be some crunchy tortilla strips, however ,when the server combines them with  the chicken  and the sit in the refrigerator for 3 hours it turns int the most disgusting looking mush you have ever seen , it is always so loud in BJ's you can never hear  your guest or friends talk unless you raise your voice ,I think this was the straw that broke the camels back. I would starve before I go back there. save my voice my ears and my stomach."
Sarah Lee G.,"Vacaville, CA",67,13,2,5.0,4/19/2011,"Every time I've gone to this BJ's in Vacaville, CA I've always received excellent food and service! This time around I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken for my main course and it was more than plenty to fill me up and save some for lunch the next day! Yum!  I also tried the Captains Mug drink and it is sooo yummie! It is their self brewed root beer with Captain Morgans & RB Schnapps! OMG one of my favorite new drinks!!!"
Nick P.,"Woodland, CA",29,243,5,3.0,3/14/2011,"For my money, this is the most inoffensive of the Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag style places, mostly because they serve lots of beer. It does check all the boxes (kickin' extreme fajitas, crazy junk all over the walls, 2000 calorie salads, etc), but the food is decent and affordable and, did I mention lots of beer? Cause they have lots and lots and lots of beer. Granted, they won't be able to satisfy snooty nosed beer connoisseurs, but it's certainly better than the Gargantuar Bud Lights being swilled over at Applebee's, so I'll take it (assuming I can't be bothered to find something better of course)."
Kyla M.,"Vacaville, CA",24,1,,2.0,10/9/2014,"I have been to this BJ's for about 5 times in the past year and NEVER have I experienced good service here ever. ALL the servers are rude and bitchy. Every single time, the servers are never friendly and rather rude. One time I came with my friends and they complained about their daiquiri not having enough alcohol. I know it wasn't the server's fault and their complaint may have been stupid imo, but the way the server answered to them was very insulting. He responded to my friends as if they were dumb and ignorant. I would've been on the server's side, but the way he handled the complaint was very unprofessional and didn't even offer to fix it or get information from the bartender or what. It wasn't even a busy night. He never offered anything and just gave us an ""I-don't-know-you-guys-are-stupid"" sarcastic kinda look. Their food is decent, you get a wide range of selections. I love their pizookie. I ordered their boneless wings last time and I didn't like it. Applebee's boneless wings are WAY better."
Jonathan A.,"Suisun City, CA",73,6,,3.0,8/21/2010,"I had the fish tacos. They weren't too shabby, but I feel like I could definitely get something better at a place like Rubio's.  The waitress was nice, but service wasn't the best. The wait seemed a little long, and we were antsy by the time the food came to the table. Two of us got our food at the same time, but the third person at our table had to wait about 5 minutes longer for her order...which was kind of annoying because we usually wait for everyone to get their food before eating. For dessert I got the white chocolate macadamia pizookie. It was good! The white chocolate macadamia cookie was nice and warm, and the two cold scoops of vanilla ice cream on top made for an amazing combination. Unfortunately, we had to wait just as long for the desserts as well. All in all it's a decent place with decent food and great pizookies, but I guess we might have been there on a busier day because service was pretty slow."
Jorge A N.,"Sacramento, CA",1,50,68,2.0,4/1/2013,"I don't know what to think of this restaurant, its not set up as a child friendly place. The commercials make it look family friendly. When you walk in, you might feel under dressed if you are wearing shorts or jeans. But it is a casual place. We ordered the 2 for 20. The medium deep dish great white. It was chicken and tomatoes with garlic sauce. The pizza cheese was not melted all the way, It also had NO taste, it was just dry bread. The pizza was not even hot when it arrived. The meal comes with choice of soup our salad for each of you. And a pizza, you get either a thin pizza 14in or a deep dish 12in. No drinks included. This is our second trip and its just an expensive cool place to hang out."
Maileilimalei A.,"Vacaville, CA",19,2,,4.0,9/17/2012,"Love that I can come here for clam chowder when ever I want! Big clam chowder fan(; Actually haven't been here in a while, just felt like writing a review. Miss going here. I want me some clam chowder, and of course you can't forget the PIZOOKIE!! :D The service is a hit or miss at times but I can understand they are busy. Other than that their food and pizookie is yuuuummmmmyy."
La C.,"San Francisco, CA",82,1052,45,2.0,6/1/2012,"I wanted to love it but barely liked it.  I tried the peach margarita and it was just too sweet.  I had the soup and salad combo and was disappointed too, the chicken noodle had no flavor and the salad was tasty but super small portion wise.  The buffalo wings were ok too.  I think for the prices they charge the food needs to be better quality.  Boo!"
Bill E.,"Kansas City, KS",3,20,,4.0,4/27/2013,"After squeezing them to buy some glasses they came through.  Good food, great service and a great house hefe!"
Elle D.,"Sacramento, CA",89,29,3,3.0,4/21/2011,"This used to be the kick-it spot back in the day.  Great good, drinks and pizookies galore. My favorite dish is the Balsamic Glazed Chicken.  I hadn't been back in a while but came here for dinner with my boyfriend about 2 weeks ago. And I was a little bummed because during my absence, the size of their drinks shrank and the price went up. WHAT?! WHY?!?  Margaritas used to be $7.95 and were served in the big glasses that water also comes in...and now they're something like $8.95 and come in this skinny, pathetic little glass. Boo! Don't think I'll be back very often to drink anymore."
Pavel D.,"Vacaville, CA",51,22,,2.0,9/28/2012,I wish I could give Bj's more stars. But 2 times in a row the kitchen decides to take 30 to cook my entree. The kitchen is so slow during dinner. Lunch is cheap and food comes quick . The service is usually good but the food usually takes too long
Kimberly M.,"Vallejo, CA",25,25,111,3.0,1/11/2009,"just came back from this place it was really nice and the atmosphere wasn't that bad either. I would really come back to this place for the good brew's and for the huge pizza's  it was pretty full that night which kinda worried me because I heard that the wait can be kinda irritating but thankfully we only had to wait like 3 to 5 minutes. so when we got to our seats my friends and I already kinda knew what we wanted because we looked on their website before hand. so we didn't waste time that much looking at the menu but their was more pictures in the menu then the website haha. so I was really really hungry tonight like I didn't eat anything all day today so man was I soo ready for the Great white. This pizza was really delicious, it was a white pizza so it had a cream sauce instead of marinara sauce. I believe it was alfredo sauce and it also had roasted garlic bits and mushrooms and chunks of tomatoes which was really good. The pizza crust was really good as well it wasn't too hard or too chewy it was just right.  I also ordered the Angus beef pot roast sandwich which was also really good as well. it was a slice of garlic bread toped with the pot roast which was super tender and moist. Then on top of the roast was a good scoop of garlic mashed potatoes and gravy with a side of steamed veggies.  it was so delicious. It seriously cured my hunger. After dinner it was the all incredible pizookie. for free because it was my friends birthday so which made the bill even better haha =]  so all in all it was a pretty good experience the bar was fully stocked and for some reason I really liked the openness of the whole room so my friends and I didn't have to watch our volume haha. Our waitress seemed like she was ready to get off so I was kind of hesitant to ask her a question about the menu but other then that I had a really good time. this would be a good place to take a couple of the guys and girls to have a beer or two and have their pizza."
Jasmin A.,"Vallejo, CA",218,42,8,3.0,4/27/2010,"Come here for the beer..... that's it. Oh, oh yea! and stay for a Pizookie. The food itself is just eh, okay. Burgers are alright, but their massive Stuffed Potatoes are pretty good.  Its definitely a great place for a large dinner/lunch party, but I don't recommend this place for date night - its too loud and there are TVs all over the place playing every sports event happening all over the world... well, not quite but they might as well be.  HIGH HEEL WEARERS - BEWARE: the floors, though immaculately clean, are SUPER slippery, especially in the front, reception area. I've had a couple of close calls on my way to the Ladies' room."
Aja N.,"Santa Cruz, CA",2948,533,435,4.0,11/24/2013,"Best place to eat in Vacaville! It's consistent, reasonably priced and really good!! I can be busy, but you can usually eat in the bar lounge."
Briana W.,"Oakland, CA",111,241,93,3.0,4/12/2012,"Mmmm... Orange Cream Soda is so good here! They brew it there! I got the pulled pork sandwich, it was a bit too salty. Service was great, fast and friendly because we were on a time crunch."
