Carol P.,"Sacramento, CA",3063,824,879,2.0,8/28/2007,"I ate at the BJ's in Elk Grove, and I fell in love with their Chicago-style pizza.  The price was decent and the crust was thick, flakey, and buttery.  So I was totally looking forward to having a slice (or two or three) on the way back to Sac from a day of biking in the bay area.  We started off our meal with the ""together at last"" appetizer: hot artichoke dip and bruschetta.  Do your stomach a favor, and just order extra bread at the beginning.  I could have lived on this bread alone.  Pan fried to perfection and excellent with both the fresh tomato bruschetta and rich artichoke dip.   Service was good, although I wonder if it was because we were the only ones sitting at the bar (a rarity at any chain restaurant).  Actually, every staff member I came across was very polite and professional.  Our bartender kept giving me samples of their specialty beers on tap until I found one that I liked (the hefeweizen).  They do sell a ""sampler"" but as my bartender pointed out, ""you just want to get drunk for free"".  How observant.  Good selection of beers to go with the big menu selection. Oh, yeah, the pizza...not good.  It wasn't anything like I remembered.  The crust was a thick soggy mess.  I don't think the dough was baked through all the way.  But we didn't complain.  I guess the fact that we were so hungry and I got free beer (so to speak), that we let it slide.     Sorry, BJ's in Vacaville, I just don't think I'll be back."
Francisco R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,38,6,2.0,7/10/2011,"PRO: If you like beer, they have that. But so does every other bar, lots of tvs for sports, big enough for large parties CON: Expensive (for bar food), lacks taste or uniqueness. But I come from a lively bar scene in Chicago. This place doesnt provide anything but a place to meet. Which is alright, but id rather go somewhere else for food."
Mark S.,"Woodland, CA",7,188,171,2.0,8/17/2010,"BJ's has great potential but it misses the mark in every way. Ostensibly, it's a brew pub but the atmosphere isn't brew pub-like and most of the beers fall short of those of real brew pubs in the area. The food mediocre and rarely comes out of the kitchen as it was ordered. The only bright spots at BJ's are the friendly bar tenders and servers in the bar area and some of the regular customers."
patrick s.,"Fairfield, CA",0,189,17,4.0,2/28/2013,shrimp scampie...OMG!!! my daughters got the grilled chicken over pasta and spaghetti with meat sauce. waitress was very attentive and refilled our drinks without us asking.  i will be back definitely. my girls are already asking to go back.
Peggy S.,"Dixon, CA",0,7,,2.0,11/11/2014,"Two stars due to the fact that service was really really really SLOW! Food was good, just don't be in a hurry. Service SUCKS!!!!"
Kristine C.,"Salinas, CA",120,36,22,1.0,12/27/2011,Poorly staffed during a dinner rush. Had to flag someone down after waiting so long just for the drink order. Server we started out with turned into a different server who was already taking care of the other half of this particular seating area. Some of the food that was ordered never came out. The fire alarm went off for awhile. Overall bad experience.
Dale K.,"American Canyon, CA",18,48,1,4.0,5/17/2012,"Came here for a light dinner at about 7:00.  We managed to snag the last table; it was quite crowded, but the tables cleared often. We started off with avocado egg rolls - amazing!!  I'm not usually a fan of warm avocado, but these rolls were to die for.  The sweet-sour dipping sauce was perfect.   Then hubby and I shared the Santa Fe salad, his portion with grilled chicken, mine with blackened salmon.  More avocado, tangy dressing, yummy chicken and fish.  The  salmon portion was huge;  I took it to work for breakfast. He had the house-made black cherry soda (yummy, but sweet) and I had the Jeremiah Red beer.  Excellent beer, not bitter. All in all a pretty good restaurant experience.  Service was a bit slow, which was acknowledged; I knocked a star off my review. We'll definitely stop in again and I'll probably just have the ribs.  The watermelon/feta salad looked so good, but there was just no room. Parking can be problematic and I bet the weekends can be a zoo.  They have house-brewed root beer and cream soda, along with lots of other non-alcoholic drinks for the teetotalers out there. We were very pleased and will go back.  It's near the Outlet Shops, so it's quite convenient if you're in Vacaville."
Charles S.,"Suisun City, CA",21,52,17,4.0,1/22/2010,"After much thought, I have decided to go with a four star on this review for a few reasons... Service is good... Food is good and prices are good. BEER IS BAD!!! Every and I mean EVERY beer has too much sweetness to it. This is probably why they offer other brands on tap and in the bottle. I deduct the 5th star because they dare call this a brewhouse."
Phan H.,"San Francisco, CA",236,590,1,4.0,9/23/2012,"The service is always great when I come here. The people are always nice. One busy nights (Friday/Saturday) do expect a long wait, especially if you have a large party. This is a chain and with all chains you can pretty much expect the same type of menu, and the food barely changes with location. The pizzas are good, but I love the pastas. The beers are probably the biggest draw of this place as they have a huge selection to choose from. A bit on the pricey side, but the place is a tad upscale."
Martha T.,"Fairfield, CA",24,60,43,1.0,12/14/2011,We waited for over a hour and a half for our food! We never got it we got up and left! We went here for my girlfriends birthday and I had to run to red robins to get a birthday cake I waited 3mins there wish we went there for food instead! That was our second time there we won't be going back did I mention we traveled from Vallejo to go to B.J.'s.
Jeremy S.,"Fairfield, CA",2,13,,1.0,10/4/2009,"So we went to get a tasty deep dish pizza for lunch today.  All was well until we actually got the pizza.  It LOOKED tasty, and the ONE BITE I had was tasty.  The problem was as my Wife  was cutting a piece up for our Daughter she found a half  melted plastic bread bag tie.  The manager came over and actually said ""I haven't seen that in a long time, we usually find stuff in salads not the pizza""  WHAT?! then he said ""you want me to get another pizza for you?"" ""Ill go ahead and take the pizza off your bill"" then he walked away.  Like WE did something wrong?  Obviously we left immediately.  I guess he will have to ""comp"" our iced tea and root beer too.  Total Dick head!  I can't believe he said all that, and didn't even apologize!  We won't be going back because of him....and their dirty ass kitchen. Dang! I wish I took a picture of the plastic thing that could have killed my kid!"
Stephen J.,"Westminster, CA",0,15,,5.0,10/11/2014,We were a big group with a bunch of kids.   Not the easiest group to deal with. Jordan  did a great job.   Overall a great experience and great food.
Wayne B.,"Fairfield, CA",68,128,652,5.0,8/8/2010,"I was really not expecting much here. We were craving Chicken Fried Steak and Mac and Cheese. This place had both, so we tried it out.  The Chicken Fried Steak was good, not the best I've had, but worthy of a return visit. We wound up not getting the Mac and Cheese, because we figured that, with the White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, it would be cheese overkill. The potatoes were the best mashed potatoes I've ever had at a restaurant. I would return just for them.  The Blonde beer was good, and the Totonka Imperial Stout was better than average.   They also had a drink called the Captain's Mug which is Captain Morgain Spiced Rum, Rootbeer Schnapps, and BJ's Root Beer.  Superb! The Triple Chocolate Pizzookie was absolutely incredible, one of the best deserts I've ever had, and again, worthy of return just for that.  The menu is HUGE. Almost anyone could find something they like here.  If I could do 4.5 stars, I would, because the beer and steak were good, but not ""as good as it gets."" But the potatoes and desert are. I'll be back..."
Joseph R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,10,,5.0,4/15/2013,"Food is amazing! Lots of variety, great service, nice environment!"
T L.,"Winters, CA",0,11,18,5.0,4/7/2013,"Spicy Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.   OMG!!   Love them. They are fresh, crunchy, just a touch spicy.  I could eat the whole shareable platter, but then I'd have no room for my individual Pizza (regular crust, black olive, mushroom and GARLIC.    Also very yummy."
Sara A.,"Plano, TX",93,93,89,2.0,5/24/2012,"Food was great but service was horrendous! Three of us came for lunch on a Sunday. Took quite some time (over 20 minutes) to be acknowledged after being seated. Had to ask for drink refills three separate times. Bill was brought to us right after we ordered desert before ever being finished with service! This is a huge no-no in restaurant service and an unforgivable error. About 15 minutes after being served our bill, desert came out. Waiter actually stopped by to collect bill before we ever received desert. Management needs to have a serious conversation with their servers."
Jackie S.,"Milpitas, CA",416,1463,2091,3.0,7/29/2007,"I've been to BJ's so many times when I worked at Vacaville. It was the main hang out place for our department. The food is decent for a chain restaurant. I love the Avocado Egg Rolls as the avocado and cream cheese makes this appetizer so smooth and rich tasting. I've tried the Seasame Chicken Salad which isn't that authentic tasting. I would not order the salad again. The Sante Fe Salad was better with the avocado and tortilla chips. The salad had similar flavors to the Halibut Fish Taco dish. I really like the Halibut Fish Tacos. You receive tacos, red and black corn tortilla chips, avocado cream sauce and a fire-roasted tomato salsa. The taco is really good as the halibut is in a panko-crust. Yum!! The taco is also stuffed with cabbage, cartos, cilantro, and red onions. I wish there were more tacos since two seems a bit on the skimpy side. For dessert, you have to get the Pizookie. Your choice of chocolate, white chocolate macademia nut, peanut butter, or oatmeal cookie is freshly baked and topped with vanilla ice cream. You can also get a half of tow different cookie batters. The white chocolate macademia nut is soo delicious! The cookie is sweet and the ice cream makes the dessert so much better. It's definitely worth the $5. Next time I want to get half oatmeal and half white chocolate."
Doria M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,23,7,5.0,1/8/2011,"We try to dine at BJ's several times a month.  It's wonderful.  The service is great, the employees are friendly and welcoming.   All their food is good but my favorites are their salads and the huge stuffed potatoes. Very, Very good."
Ann C.,"Vacaville, CA",0,13,,5.0,5/11/2013,Best pizza I have ever had in my life!!! Sweetest staff!! The only downside is the wait on a weekend in the evening but I can see why everybody loves it there. It's worth it!
Malivia S.,"Vacaville, CA",9,35,1,4.0,10/16/2012,Thumbs up to BJ's I've been there three times so far they are always packed so that's a good sign the wait isn't too bad the service is good and the food is tasty I especially like their pizookie so yummy I will return :-)
