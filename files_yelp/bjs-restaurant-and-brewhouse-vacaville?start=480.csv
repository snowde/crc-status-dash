Lame O.,"Fairfield, CA",1,82,11,4.0,2/23/2012,"Went to eat at happy hour and it was pretty busy by the time we left @ around 6.  A couple bucks off of appear really isn't that great of a deal, but the five dollar mini pizzas were reasonable.  The one with portabella mushrooms and balsamic vinegar was delicious with a pint of beer.  The calamari and potstickers were also good, but the spinach dip/chips and southwest eggrolls were just ok."
Zac O.,"Fairfield, CA",30,141,34,3.0,7/2/2009,"Beer Good, Food Ehhhh Expensive mediocre food is not the way I like to spend my money. All Hype and Illusion. I went with a party of 15 or more and Had coffee spilled down my brothers back, Ranch dripped on my girls sweater and a used bottle of beer served to my other bro. Our food was served at different intervals and my niece didnt eat because her food still wasnt done when half the table had dessert. Manager gave us half off, but we still blew close to 200 dollars for Shite"
Kev B.,"Woodland, CA",1034,60,223,4.0,4/21/2013,"I like this place but the wait is always long, it's just popular, so what's one to expect... But the Ale selection is the bomb !!! Great food too !!! Fun service and Big Screen TV's great for watching the Sports games. Check it out !!!"
Peri C.,"Novato, CA",0,14,1,1.0,1/14/2014,"Hostess is young & rude.  Told her a table for two.  She took our name & no another word. She simply turned around & started talking with her friends/co-workers.  Nothing about the length of wait, or to have a seat, or our name would be called momentarily.  I stood at the podium & just got the back of her head.  Not a good start.  We'll see how the rest of the evening goes."
Jessica G.,"Fairfield, CA",10,115,,5.0,2/19/2010,"One of my life goals is to find the best Americanized Chinese Chicken Salad. For the past three years, no one has taken this off of the top spot. I can't say I've ordered anything else, quite frankly I don't recall anything else. But oh, that Chinese Chicken Salad. The service is usually pretty swell too, and waiters seem to be attractive as well, which is a plus."
Nicole N.,"Petaluma, CA",1,4,,2.0,1/26/2014,"I am a big fan of BJ's but had a less than ideal experience at the Nut Tree location. We ordered an appetizer and dinner. The server forgot to put in our app order. After she put in the order we ended up getting the app minutes before our dinner. My sister ordered a side of fries with her dinner and those were forgotten. When we reminded tge server of tjat order she responded that they run out of fries often and she'd get them out soon. I ordered the seared ahi salad and was completely disgusted about what came out on the plate. My lettuce was wilted and the veggies smelled rotten. I never send food back. I did this day!  The server didn't check on us much so by the time she came over for me to send back the salad, my sister was done eating so no point of me ordering new food. The server seemed annoyed at me and could care less. Not the first not so great experience at BJ's."
James L.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",0,21,,5.0,1/5/2013,"Awesome food- everything we've tried has been great... Pizza, fish tacos, burgers, fries, chicken tortilla soup, et al. And the ""Pizookie"" desserts are awesome!  It's always packed!  (And sign up for their premier rewards for good deals.)"
Ardella O.,"San Leandro, CA",69,203,124,4.0,10/27/2011,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining in at BJ's for the second time with a friend that I hadn't seen in years. Although we had to wait for 30 minutes, it was well worth it. Our waitress, I believe her name was Jenny, was attentive and extremely friendly to myself and my friend. I was especially surprised that the service was outstanding, given that it was a Friday night. I'll definitely be returning to dine in."
Jen M.,"Fairfield, CA",1,11,3,5.0,2/24/2013,"Bj's is always awesome. My kids love it, we never wait, food is great, service even better!!! Ohhh and the stout ten stars!!!!!"
TransformerMan C.,"Fairfield, CA",0,38,47,3.0,10/26/2013,"10/23/13    Back for an expected good and tasty lunch! I've never been disappointed, except his visit.  My wife got a salad that was 30% rotten, but the server handled it by giving her a regular salad. Who checks the meals when they go out? Serving spoiled salad greens is bad business.  The rest of her meal was only average. Mine was okay.  We expect a better experience next time."
Caitlin G.,"San Diego, CA",6,27,,4.0,7/3/2009,"Ok here goes. 1.) Pizookies are the shit. the end. 2.) Service is usually good, but there has been a couple times where its been kinda terrible. 3. ) The cajun pasta (with chicken) is.... *drools*.... amazing. (I love me some shrimp, but dont get it with shrimp, its too overwhelmingly fishy).  4.) Spicy spaghetti really is spicy! YUM! 5.) Dear lord, the bbq chicken chopped salad, heavenly. I think its my favorite salad ever. 6.) If you dont make reservations, you WILL be waiting a long time if its on a thursday-sunday. There has been 2 times where I have had my name put on the list as soon as I walk through the door, and they totally forgot about me. RUDE! But I am extremely forgiving. I would definately from now on make reservations so that they wont be so damn forgetful next time!"
David L.,"San Francisco, CA",69,40,40,1.0,4/21/2009,"-It was my friend's birthday and we made a reservation for a party of about 40-50 people (This reservation was made more than a week in advance). -A deal was made with the restaurant for a ""buffet style"" dinner consisting of unlimited amounts of 4 different types of pizza, 3 different types of appetizers, and free sodas.  -The cost was a flat rate of $20 per person.  In the end, I felt scammed out of my money. Our food came out very slowly and when any food would finally be brought to our designated buffet table, our party of 40+ people consumed it in seconds. It should have been obvious that a party of 40+ people can't survive off of two pizzas and a measly tray of buffalo wings! When we asked the waiters why our food was coming out so slowly, they told us that it was the managements decision to bring the food out at such a slow pace... This was the most aggravating part of the whole dinner... We had 40+ hungry people paying $20 each and they were starving us by purposely not bringing out food! Conclusion: NEVER get pawned into a ""buffet style"" or catered meal at BJs. If anything, avoid the whole place all together. Their pizza is filled with uncooked doughy bread and frozen ingredients anyways."
Ash B.,"Vacaville, CA",37,34,11,5.0,8/28/2011,"Awesome place! Great atmosphere, service and food! Definitely recommend their fried artichokes for an appetizer and whole wheat pizza for the main course. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!"
Casey H.,"Vacaville, CA",11,57,7,2.0,8/18/2013,"Yeah I can definitely say I've been here a few times in the past, although I recently went for part of my job. First off took almost 10 minutes for a server to approach us and ask if we even wanted drinks. At the Bar area I asked the waiter what Hefeweizen  he would suggest, he honestly looked at me like a deer in the headlights look finally, I just asked what Hefeweizen's they had on tap. He read me off two beers and I chose the wingnut I think it was. I thought it was interesting that it took another 5 minutes for a food runner (not the waiter) to bring me my drink. The waiter then took another 5 minutes to come by to ask if we had time to look over the menu, of course we have we have been here for over 15 minutes by now. I ordered a 9"" deep dish pizza and the girlfriend got the buffalo burger. Granted I know deep dish pizza should take a while to bake and thats ok, so 25 minutes later (yes I was watching the time) a food runner comes out with my pizza and her burger. My so called deep dish pizza was more like a thick pan crust pizza I was not very thrilled to say the least, that was by no means a deep dish pizza. So I will cut this short at this point, I would seriously rate this place 1 star but the beer was good enough to raise it a star."
Kristine D.,"Fairfield, CA",61,340,159,3.0,1/7/2012,expensive stuff. ok food. really good cider. service is ok. nothing exempkary.
Amanda M.,"Vacaville, CA",51,245,42,3.0,1/30/2012,"This place is very hit and miss. Sometimes you get a really good waiter and seated right away, sometimes you get a waiter that is there for the paycheck and you wait awhile. Food is usually pretty good and beer is alright for a chain brewhouse. If you go during dinner forget about finding a parking space cause it won't happen. This place is pricey and if your meal is done correctly then it's worth the wait. I don't go out of my way to eat here."
Maria F.,"Vacaville, CA",13,11,10,4.0,8/17/2011,"Normally when I go to BJ's the service sucks except for a server named Antonio. It's been a month since our visit, and I remember his name. I was impressed. Antonio was very attentive, professional... Basically had excellent customer service. I wish I could have him all the time. Only reason I'm knocking off a star is because the past experiences of waiters, OTHER THAN ANTONIO!"
Theresia D.,"Oakland, CA",291,369,264,4.0,4/10/2009,"At least a 30 min wait everytime I come here....no jokes either! I swear this place always has people waiting to get a table, even in the bar area! Well last nights event was Cherlyn's bday dinner. We got there around 8:30pm but didn't sit at the table until around 9:15pm maybe later, I couldn't remember because I think I was sleep walking to the table! Our servers were so nice and really attentive, which was very pleasing to me since we were a party of 20!!! They actually brought us all waters immediately and took our drink and appetizer order and came right back within 5 mins to take our dinner order........man that food came out so fast! But hey I am mos def not complaining! I enjoyed:  GRILLED CHICKEN PASTA Rotelle noodles with our rich cream sauce, steamed broccoli and your choice of grilled or blackened chicken breast.  Came with your choice of soup or salad (House, cesar, or even wedge) and 2 pieces of garlic bread. It was so good but i stuffed up on my cesar salad so I got to take the rest home for today's lunch! All in all it was great company, great food, FANTASTIC service (wish I knew their names......oh I think one lady's name was Jackie)!!!"
Tikal G.,"Solano, CA",27,4,,4.0,4/10/2010,"It's a good place to go with a group of friends. It's a chain so it loses some of it's charm in that sense but it does alot of things right. They have good beer and a nice variety. All of their appetizers are good, every single one of them. Lots of different kind of pizza's that are all pretty much good as well. They have great desert (any kind of pizokie) Can't really imagine taking a date there not very intimate but it's a great environment to hang out with a group of friends anywhere from 2 to 20."
Moon C.,"Vacaville, CA",6,23,25,3.0,10/11/2011,"Mediterranean pizza is GREAT.. cob salad, turkey sandwich good also. The wait is always too damn long though...and service is less than great...I usually dont go here...pazookis are heaven though."
