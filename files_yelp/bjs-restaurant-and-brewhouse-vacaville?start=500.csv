Jamie L.,"Oakland, CA",340,688,472,4.0,4/20/2009,"Never been here until yesterday. The wait wasn't too long especially for a hot Sunday and the feeling that there was too little staff to cater to the people coming in. My pre-entertainment walking to the building was a mom yelling at her teenage daughter in the parking lot. I've been there, glad I wasn't in her daughter's shoes anymore.  The inside of BJ's is huge and totally in tune with the sports environment with a TV in every direction. I was disappointed that they changed the basketball game to racing. Ugh. Playoffs are my favorite. Although the Giants game was on so it wasn't too bad.  I like the fact that BJ's has a pairing section for their beers, which is really important to me because I never know if a beer would go with the food I am eating. I ordered the Harvest Hefeweizen for the BJ's Cobb Salad. My sister ordered the Onion Strings for the appetizer. The rest of my family ordered sandwiches and salads, and my sweet daughter ordered her pizza.  I don't care what the reviews say here, our service was quick. The food did take awhile, but after seeing what was on our plate I can see the delay. Their Cobb Salad was delicious! Every bite there was dressing and an assortment of croutons, turkey, or bacon in each bite. Nothing was dry and everything tasted exactly the way I wanted it to. Their Hefeweizen was a great pairing and was yummy, especially with that banana aftertaste (no joke).  I was content and satisfied when I left; I so wouldn't mind coming here, especially with decent prices for the great portion of food that is always a deal to me."
roderick s.,"SOMA, San Francisco, CA",3,101,2,3.0,12/4/2011,"First time at BJ's and we got seated right away. They dont take reservations but you can call in (?). Their menu is huge for food and beers. Anyways, we I ordered the jambalaya and it was alright. The kids ordered the (you built in) pizza with chicken, bacon and pepperoni.  I think if this is their  deep dish it wasnt good. I had chicago style pizza and nowhere close with this. We also ordered 2 other chicken dishes and it was ok. This place looks like real busy so call in.But their pozzokies ( chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream) was very good."
Lisa P.,"Rockland, MA",2,20,,1.0,8/10/2013,"Went to BJ's for a late lunch today with my daughter. I wanted to try something new so I got the bison burger.  Very small patty and a red cabbage and carrot mix on the side, no fries though.  It was skimpy for the price.  My daughter got a grilled chicken club with fries,  it was just okay,  skimpy on the chicken in the sandwich.  Would not go there again with so many other choices in the area."
Lena H.,"Redding, CA",0,45,4,1.0,9/29/2012,"Food is generic and precooked processed food. Salad is iceberg and precut carrots, bland dressings.  California chicken sandwich only contains a few slivers of Ortega chiles, not a actual chile.  For the price at least you get a whole chile and better flavor at Carl's Jr."
Mark W.,"Arden-Arcade, Sacramento, CA",2,8,3,4.0,6/16/2012,The burger was big and delicious and the wedge cut fries were excellent. Don't forget to try the pizzookie!
Don B.,"American Canyon, CA",9,64,14,4.0,12/17/2009,Love the calzone. Love the sweet pig pizza. Could care less about the sports bar atmosphere. But it is basically a sports bar. TVs everywhere.  Their own-brewed root beer is not good. Don't get it.  Overall I do enjoy eating here.
Dee L.,"Oakland, CA",129,201,311,3.0,12/14/2009,"3.5 Stars Took my daughter here after her ballet recital and we split the mozzerella sticks and my boyfriend let us have some potato skins. Very tasty. I got the parmesan chicken and my daughter got a pizza and my boyfriend got the burger. All were very tasty. The atmosphere was very nice. It was a rainy Saturday afternoon but still packed. They have alot of TV's but they were only playing basketball on 1:( It seemed they had tons of servers running around... Everyone was very  nice, our server disappeared for awhile but like I said they were very busy. No wait time to be seated. Will definitely be back. They had a good wine selection too!"
Jon W.,"San Leandro, CA",484,161,166,4.0,8/24/2009,"BJs does not suck.  Which is actually a contridiction in terms. Ive been here a few Sundays for dinner and its reliable good food.  Service is descent.  Seating can be a long wait at peak hours, but do yourself a favor and sit in the bar area which has booths and tables. The pizza is good.  The potatoes gi-normous.  The chicken salad was fresh n tasty.  The ribs were awesome last night, but gotta admit they were prolly freshly done.  Ive had a dry, old batch before at a different location.  The lasagna too runny and not so good.  Bottomless drinks saves you some bux.   And the beer, well thats always good."
Alice E.,"San Francisco, CA",146,407,28,1.0,10/17/2010,"1 Star for the food... read on -  Wait and service as slow as a snail. Arrived at 4:45pm, place was 1/3rd full.. The wait for a table of 6, still took 20 minutes. Odd since I saw so many empty tables. Anyways, after being seated, our server came and took our orders. Another 30 minutes our food comes out.. My group ordered:  Bruschetta, chicken salad, Caesar salad, 2 apple crisps, and pork sliders. We asked the waitress to bring the food out whenever rdy. Food was tasty, although it took a tad long to come out when the restaurant wasn't at full capacity.. Scary to imagine how long it takes when they are slammed at full capacity. Food was good tho.. no complaints there.  My biggest gripe is that I wanted to leave my credit card with the server so I could make sure no one else in my party would pay, since I wanted to treat. The hostess said I should wait too give the card to the server myself, but I couldn't find her... so she asked me to wait at the front desk for the server to come back around. So I reluctantly wait for what felt like 15 minutes, in reality prob 3-4 minutes.. and still my waitress was still no where to be found. I asked the hostess again, if the my waitress was coming and she said oh, well I never went to get her. OK... I then told her that ideally I would like to go back to my table and enjoy the company of my friends, and she THEN says ok let me get her. EH, you should've done that from the beginning.. (%$%&DSGYDH!) Before she leaves her safe zone behind the front counter, I tell her to not bother with my request. Actually my exact words were ""You know what never mind, I will deal with it myself."" I walk away at that point. Of course the whole table is wondering where I went, and one even noticed me hovering at the front desk. Yeah so that didn't go over well. I guess this is my biggest gripe, and the waiting for a table when the restaurant being empty didn't help, and the slow kitchen. I guess if you want to come for food, then by all means.. but have your patient hat on, because the staff, although easy on the eyes, really don't know whats going on."
David L.,"Fairfield, CA",880,94,135,3.0,1/14/2009,"This is the first BJs I had ever been to. Now that I have been to others, I see that the service here isn't prompt and friendly as the others I have been. Namely the one in Natomas has great service. With that said... The pizookie is still delicious. The lettuce wraps amazing. And the pizza hot and scrumptious.  Let us not forget their very own root beer which is a delight. So if you don't live near the one in Natomas, this is a good BJs to try out."
Nikki N.,"Vallejo, CA",37,411,,4.0,11/7/2008,"This is not a place for those who are dieting or watching what they are eating. Variety and large portions are served.  Love their grilled chicken pasta and Parmesan crusted chicken! If you don't feel like being a Fatty McFatty, come during lunch where smaller portions are served. There is definitely a wait if you come in on a Friday or Saturday night but the food is worth it!  We came here tonight but our food did take an awfully long time.  It would have been nice if our waitress checked on us. Hopefully that won't happen again."
Ron M.,"Fairfield, CA",1,6,3,5.0,2/28/2014,Great customer service!!! Really busy but the service makes up for the wait. They made my experience dining there from a negative and into a very positive one. Great place to eat and they actually know customer service! Rare for a chain restaurant.
Quita H.,"Fairfield, CA",79,14,21,1.0,3/26/2013,"Yesterday was our first visit to BJ's, we thought we'd try something new.... When we got there the wait time 25mins, not bad. We sat at our table ordered our drinks and 15mins later the waitress comes to take our order, I order the Crisp Potato Skins Platter (that was good), Mac n Cheese for my daughter, by the way it took over 30 mins for her to get, we also ordered the Top Sirloin with the Baked Potato, now where is goes from bad to worst, my steak wasn't even warm, the baked potato was cold and had half cooked bacon on it with some over cooked bacon mixed together, you can really see all the raw bacon and it was loaded, then we also order the Italian Chicken Parmigiana which was loaded with grease, everything on the plate was greasy and the plate looked dirty. I requested to have both adults plates returned, the manager asked if she could make our food over we said no. The manager said that the Italian Chicken Parmigiana never comes out like that, but really didn't comment on the raw bacon that she saw on my plate or the cold food I had received, not really apologetic. The waitress came back to see if we wanted to reorder, I told her no, she asked if the manager offered free dessert or anything, I advised no. I told that I will pay for the kids meal, our drinks & potato platter. NEVER AGAIN, WILL I GO TO BJ's, if I do it won't be in Vacaville."
Judy L.,"San Francisco, CA",371,887,9,3.0,11/11/2008,Only go for the cookie and ice cream - and the fries. The nachos were pretty good.  The beer... well... I've had much better samplers before. Only two of the 6 were decent.
Emilie T.,"Tracy, CA",0,23,,2.0,4/15/2013,"I really like BJ's...but today was the second time I've experienced poor customer service from one of the employees.  I am disappointed and almost at the point of not going again. I attempted to reserve space for a dinner party next month.  The special events coordinator first stated that I needed to take a look at the menu to decide what I wanted and he would then assist.  When I commented that I had already decided and I just needed some clarification and to reserve, he then said he didn't have anything available for this week.  Hmmm, why not ask when I wanted to reserve? I proceeded to tell him I was interested in a day next month.  I was then told that a calendar wasn't set up for next month but he would do so as we were talking.  He also began explaining that I would have to sign a contract and would still have to pay for the entire estimated amount of people event if that amount was not in attendance--that was fine...sounded as if he was trying to discourage me from moving forward with my inquiry.  THEN, when I told him the exact date and time, he said he had nothing available.  Nothing but a joke!  I just wasted 20 minutes on the phone when he could have just asked the appropriate questions from the beginning.  Seems like a matter of laziness. I will be hosting my dinner party elsewhere--so sad that nice establishments like these hire folks who do not understand the meaning of customer service. BTW, the food is really good.  Just go to another location if you can help it."
Holly T.,"Hayward, CA",208,38,13,4.0,8/18/2011,"I love getting drinks, appetizers, and a delicious pazookie cookie as dessert. This is my go-to spot for life's little celebrations. New job? Birthday? Just finished a race? Go to BJ's!"
Jac T.,"Oakland, CA",413,290,24,4.0,7/26/2009,"The food is good...nothing out of the ordinary that you can't find at any other ""American"" brewery/food place... The only REAL reason I go here is for the PIZOOKIES!!!! absolutely orgasmica"
Sarah H.,"Clovis, NM",31,23,10,5.0,12/31/2013,"I always enjoy coming to BJ's because I'm in love with the avocado spring rolls. Just filling enough, and they use a ton of wonderful avocados. It pays to call ahead, so you won't wait as long. We had an awesome waitress named Ally who made sure we were enjoying everything, and was helpful all through dinner. She was also super nice to my kids, and asked their names. The beer pitchers are about $16, but totally worth it. BJ's has amazing beer. My husband got the spaghetti and meat balls, and he ate his fill with leftovers to take home. My only complaint is the outrageous price they charge for margaritas, a whopping $ 9.25! Seriously?! The beer pitcher got my husband and I almost 3 full glasses each..anyway, BJ's also sells kegs of beer, which we've gotten. Yum. So all in all, fabulous dinner minus the pricey margaritas. We all took home some food, and my husband got a mini pizookie (warm cookie with ice cream on top) with a candle for his birthday!"
Carol B.,"Benicia, CA",21,51,5,4.0,8/30/2008,"Stop for lunch. In between Restoration Hardware, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, and Eddie Bauer, I have to stop for a Turkey Cobb Sandwich, a wedge instead of fries, and a large iced tea (no lemon) at BJ's. It's the perfect sandwich piled high with shredded turkey and avocado and the roll is toastalicious. It's the only thing on the menu that I can review since it's the only thing I ever order. It's just the perfect mid-shopping lunch and I love it. The service today was less than stellar -- thus only four stars."
Vero V.,"Concord, CA",29,109,7,2.0,10/11/2010,This place is exactly what youd expect. Food was acceptable but not much better then whats available at Applebees or other similar restaurant. The beer selection was also only okay since there house heff didnt even taste what a heff is supposed to taste like. Thanks to the waitress for the warning.  The best thing available at this place? The Pizzookie!
