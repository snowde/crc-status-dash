Peggy N.,"Antioch, CA",240,324,3,5.0,10/31/2008,"For a roadhouse (not a high end dining experience) you are so worth five stars! I danced earlier in the day and was ready for some hearty grub and a good cocktail.  We found all that and more, here! The Berry Cider was refreshing and the long islands were exactly how I like them! Everyone in our party departed with a full belly, a to go container and a buzz - what more can you ask for?"
Lucius M.,"Vallejo, CA",47,247,15,3.0,12/31/2010,"A bit classier than the typical brewhouse, but the food is just afterage.  The place would seem to be a good place for imtimate gatherings as well as larger groups.  The number of beers that they have on tap is not overwhelming, but certainly there's enough variety to meet most peoples' needs."
Fabiola M.,"Winters, CA",2,21,6,2.0,10/19/2013,"Okay service, okay food. Menu hasn't changed in years and its a little over priced. Too crowded, there are better places out there."
Eugenia G.,"San Francisco, CA",30,196,30,2.0,6/14/2009,"BJ's is BJ's. I'm mostly doing a review on my few experiences of this particular site's service. My boyfriend and I came here one time during lunch hour on a Saturday. There was obviously a line, as buzzers were given. My bf and I stood inside in hopes of grabbing a seat at the bar section.  As we stood there, I watched the slowness of the restaurant. I counted a total of FIVE tables that had to be waited. Of the five, one of the tables had FOUR workers visit it, grabbing only a plate or two, and a couple napkins and cups (mind you, they weren't stacking the cups, which of course would sound more efficient) Anyway, finally, the bussers start bussing, but take a million light years to complete.  When we were FINALLY seated, our server SPILLS our drinks, one being a strawberry lemonade (can you say STICKY?!?!). Only ONE worker ran over and handed us napkins as I tried to dry myself off. A busser nearby didn't give a crap and was oblivious to what had happened. I mean I felt bad for our server, but if you can't hold your drinks on the tray, just set the tray on the table! At the end of our meal, we decided to order a pazookie. Our server said it'll be on the house since he spilled our drinks on us. pfft. Yeah, sure. It was given as birthday pazookie and those things are free anyway."
Bob V.,"Vacaville, CA",0,22,,3.0,4/3/2012,Like the lunch specials. Service was slow. Food was good and not to pricey. Their beers are ok but nothing to rave about. I'll go back .
Jennifer W.,"Milpitas, CA",329,223,214,3.0,2/19/2011,"the first time i came here for dinner -- it was DELICIOUS! i guess it was because they weren't rushing to make all the food at once.   i came here with a group of 50+ people.  we got here around 930pm --eeek their kitchen was closing but we made reservation already.  so we had to order our food within 15mins before the kitchen closed.  we literally took over one whole side of the restaurant! it was so hectic! i don't blame them. we were a huge group and getting everyone's order and handling the bill was a big disaster! our water never came and we asked like 4 times.  by the 5th time we were given our water -_-  so they totally missed our table to order.  so i went up to order from a different waitress. o_O who knew there were different waiter/waitress for the whole party -___- so i ordered the SMALL BBQ chicken pizza because that's all my friend and i can finish.  but then my friend didn't know that i ordered the small and she went ahead and ordered the med because she was told that the small wouldn't fill 2 ppl up o_O anyways, when i asked them if anybody ordered a small bbq chicken pizza, the waitress said no. WHO KNEW THAT THERE WERE  DIFFERENT WAITRESS/WAITERS!!! -___- next thing we knew -- we got a small and a med size bbq chicken pizza -__- total was $42 for both of us T_T the small pizza came out cold. ugh whatever.  our party's bill came out to be $877 omg. talk about hungry people that night!"
TurtleClub H.,"Vallejo, CA",6,27,,5.0,10/18/2011,"Are you ready for some Football!!! Love their clam chowder, lettuce wraps, french dip, thin cut fries... but most of all, the friends we've made there!!!"
Christine E.,"Santa Clara, CA",390,488,18,4.0,8/24/2008,"I've always enjoyed coming to BJ's for group dinners.  Gotta love the complimentary valet parking (although they don't have it at this site). Come here for happy hour!  Half off mini pizzas, $2 off appetizers, $1 off beers/cider...and well drinks for $2.75.  Consult with them to double check! Beer sampler is pretty generous, more generous than Rock Bottom Brewery. Oh, and you can't NOT have the pizooookie!"
Margarita V.,"Richmond, CA",340,180,490,4.0,7/2/2008,I'm a fan of their drinks and their sandwiches... oh! and their giant cookie! Oh my! Oh my!... Sometimes they have you waiting a loooong time for your food tho... so that kinda has you drinking more because you can get your drinks at the bar... Expect to end up a little tipsy if you decide to go here for dinner! haha.
Tessi M.,"Suisun City, CA",45,8,,3.0,11/28/2011,"I've been here 3 times and every time was a different experience. First time BLAH, bad service. Second time Good, food and service was aight!!! Third time...Was EFFIN AWESOME!! Had a 8 beer sampler ----Whew was drunk by the fourth!! Everyone was super friendly and the Macadamian nut Pizookie was the shizznits!!"
Melissa T.,"Kalamazoo, MI",0,10,,5.0,9/16/2013,Enjoyed a very yummy dinner with great service. The Pizookie was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Seriously. Worth every penny!
Sue P.,"Roseville, CA",2,39,2,1.0,6/14/2013,Very disappointed with their deep dish pepperoni pizza.  Hardly any pepperoni. Tasted mostly sauce and tomatoes.
Bee D.,"Vallejo, CA",386,541,1513,5.0,4/17/2008,"I'm surprised at the low marks.  Me personally, I love this place.  Sure, I have to wait sometimes, but let me let you in on a little secret.  You can sit at the booths and tables up in the bar area and get great service, full menu available.  So while I wait for my name to be called, I scope out the bar area.  If a table opens up, I just jump on it. The service has always been awesome, but maybe I've just been blessed with amazing servers.  It doesn't hurt that I am super cool and treat everyone really nice (JK). Love the Avacado Egg Rolls, screaming good.  Love the sliders, just remember that they don't come with Mayo, you have to ask for it.  The stuffed potato would fill up anyone!  When you look up ginormous in the dictionary, there is a picture of one of their potatoes. And they offer a cool little beer sampler which is fun for people who aren't big time beer drinkers and see what they offer."
Joan C.,"Fairfield, CA",9,6,,4.0,1/23/2012,"Dinner for four was very enjoyable. Menu has been expanded since I was last here - very good lite menu. Unless you come early (5-5:30), call ahead because it is busy!"
Erica H.,"Suisun City, CA",2,24,,1.0,7/4/2010,"It's not worth it.  You'll have to wait 2 hours to be seated.  It's so loud you have to yell to have  a conversation.  It'll take you 2 hours to get though your meal because the service is so slow.  It's way over priced.  The food isn't that great, actually a lot of it isn't even that good.  I'd rather eat at Chili's.  Who has time to spend 4 hours on dinner?"
Brianna S.,"Tuxedo Park, NY",140,456,840,5.0,4/18/2008,"I'd never been here before and apparently it's because I was living under a rock. I came on a weekday and ordered a personal sized pizza, The Big White or something like that. It was good and I was happy. The service was sweet!! I will definetly be coming back again sometime soon."
Cecilia H.,"Capay, CA",9,24,,4.0,3/6/2012,"Went to happy hour last Tuesday with friends and boy was I happy!!!! 1/2 price wine, are you kidding me? The app's were good deals too. I haven't left so happy on many dinner visits, perhaps I need to rethink my day part strategy. Happy Hour I'll be back."
ryan t.,"Rohnert Park, CA",6,43,,3.0,5/17/2011,"I've back here 2 times since i wrote my last review. reading back on my last review, I have no clue what I was thinking giving them 4 stars.  -Their pizza is mediocre .  -The sandwiches and burgers are nothing special. -The menu is just way to big. That's not always a bad thing but when everything (with the exception of pizza) can be found on a coco's dinner menu....it's just not an exciting menu. ***please note:  I'm not comparing quality of coco's to bjs. just the items on the menu.*** I was tore between 2 or 3 stars. And honestly, I still am. I liked the fries, onion strings, root beer and pizookie. The service is decent, a little on the pushy/rushed side, but decent. The atmosphere is still fun and lively...... It's just that the dishes as a whole are nothing special. Other then it being decent, I still havent found any reason in particular that I would want to come back here. Nothing really stands out here. alright, 3 stars.... just because there is nothing really  bad about the place... It's just o.k. to me."
Shawn B.,"Fairfield, CA",0,71,,2.0,5/11/2013,"Group of four for lunch. All ordered different burgers and sliders. Absolutely disgusting. The sliders smelled funny and the burgers had a weird texture! Felt sorry for the waitress having to endure bringing us warm to cold burgers with fries that have been sitting around and then ask  "" how is everything"". If i was a chef, i'd be embarrassed to allow this kind of crap to come out of my kitchen!! WOW"
Devin A.,"Hampton, VA",1,60,3,4.0,6/18/2013,"Good food, but this place is ALWAYS packed. Mixed reviews on servers, generally good though. Almost always have to wait for a seat."
