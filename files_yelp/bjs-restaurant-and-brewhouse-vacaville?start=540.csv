Brit P.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,,3.0,1/1/2012,"Quick Review: The outside and inside appearance was nice My family and I dined as a party of 4 on a Saturday evening; we were seated right away The hostess wasn't hospitable, and seemed like she didn't want to seat us (or just didn't want to be at work on New Year's Eve). She slapped down three sets of silverware when we were seated, like she had some kind of problem. Our waitress, however (I need to remember names) was very pleasant and we gave her a nice tip ;) The food was delicious (try the Santa Fe salad) The wait time for the food was a little long and the chicken in my salad was a little cold All-in-all: It was okay"
Victoria P.,"Fairfield, CA",32,99,1,2.0,9/23/2014,"Oh BJ's...why are your servers so hit and miss?  Your food is actually some of the best pub food around, but your servers...what is is it, do you not pay them? Do you flog them?  Why are they so miserable and so slooooooowwwww?  It was at least 15 minutes from the time we sat down until we got our glasses of water, at lunchtime, during a weekday, when the restaurant was not really full by any means...and after seeing other parties who were seated AFTER us get their water (with lemon wedges) I got up and asked our waiter who was near the bar to please bring us our water.  It was not like he had been to our table three times already.   Our waiter brought us our water.  He slammed the glasses down so hard they almost spilled, and oh yeah, no lemon, but whatever.  BJ's Managers...do you read these Yelp posts?  I wonder.  The service was pretty pathetic for the rest of the meal.   I once worked as a waitress, I know it is hard work, but honestly, we didn't do anything to warrant this guy's piss poor attitude."
Mike F.,"Vacaville, CA",51,47,3,5.0,5/30/2013,"Love this place. Been coming here sence they opened. Awsome afordable lunch menu that's great for groups. The jambalaya is really good. My girl loves the flat bread pizza's from the lunch menu. The beer sampler is nice if your not sure what you want. It's all their in house brewed beers from light to dark ( I like to go backwards from dark to light). I seem to get the same waiter alot - Josh, he's the best!"
Erin S.,"Santa Rosa, CA",351,550,100,3.0,7/25/2010,"BJ's isn't a bad restaurant. Its just not a brewery to me. Maybe I just like the histpry and idea of breweries only serving to there geographical area. BJ's is everywhere and there is always a wait. Last time I was here they even served samples while you were waiting, which was a really nice touch. Their Jeremiah Red was my favorite, but nothing inspired me."
Bruce W.,"Fairfield, CA",10,144,1,2.0,4/13/2011,"Their food is consistently boring and bland. I've eaten a bunch of things on the menu and while the pizza is good (and amazingly unhealthy), nothing else is good. The Cajun chicken pasta is close to good, but with those ingredients how could it not. It's a cream sauce with not much cajun. I always dread when the wifey or friends want to come here."
K. Onda Guera ?.,"Vallejo, CA",27,99,59,4.0,11/13/2010,"Absolutely the best Bloody Mary's ever!  Everything I have ever had has been good, but hands down, the Pizookie is the reason I go there!"
Kirstie A.,"San Bruno, CA",0,41,,4.0,7/5/2011,Came here for lunch while part of my family was paintballing near by. There were 7 of us and the wait wasn't bad (15 min). Our waitress was nice and the food was good. Like always at BJs the pizza was great!
Showtime Productions C.,"Suisun City, CA",1,7,,1.0,6/6/2012,"My wife and I went to this BJ's for the first time tonight and it was a very bad experience. After waiting for our names to be called, the wait time was about 25 minutes, that was ok. Once we sat at the table about 15 minutes later a waiter came and he took our drink order, two tropical teas only to get regular teas,  and a Calamari appetizer order and said he would be back to take our main order. This is when the problems started. After another 10 minute wait our drinks came and then he took our main order. We ordered a Pork Chop Dinner with a chicken Soup and a Creole Tilapia. Another 15 minutes went by and the Calamari Apps came to the table. My wife and I ate the appetizer because we had been waiting now from the start over 45 minutes for our first taste of food. Another 20 minutes go by and our main dishes came to the table. Both plates looked as if they had been almost dropped as the food on both plates were all shoved to one side. I was a little upset and wanted to say something, but the waiter was nowhere to be found. During this time frame for the next 30 minutes, no soup was ever brought out and none of our drinks were refilled. Finally the waiter came back to the table to see if we needed anything, and I explained that we never got our soup and that been waiting for a refill as well. He said he would go get a refill and said nothing about the soup. This is when it got even more worse. after another 15 minute wait, the waiter shows up to the table with one refill, not two, but one refill. and then sets down our soup. The soup was 20 minutes after we had already finished our main dinner. The dinner cost us $44.18 and it was not worth one penny of the bill. The service was terrible and the food was late, cold and a mess on the plate. Not sure what else to say about our first experience other then it was one of the worst dinning out experiences that we have shared together."
Christina H.,"Sacramento, CA",127,266,68,3.0,11/11/2008,"I am not a fan of this restaurant at any location but I gave in to going here because it wasn't worth the fight. It wasn't busy as we were there for an early dinner so we were seated right away. The menu is huge...too huge. While I like variety, I am not a good decision maker so this makes it hard for me. There is just something about the atmosphere at this restaurant that doesn't set well with me.  I opted for the parmesan chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli with a dinner salad (to be shared). The significant other ordered the meatball sandwich with wedge fries. I got water but later decided I wanted to try the pumpkin ale they were showcasing. It was not to be had as our waitress was nowhere to be found. By the time she came back around I had changed my mind. The food didn't take long to come out and my parmesan chicken was decent. The mashed potatoes were the consistency of powdered potatoes and tasted like glue. The lettuce in the salad was watered down which is never good. The meatball sandwich was surprisingly very good and huge! The sauce they use was very flavorful as was the meat and the garlic roll. The potato wedges were crispy and well seasoned.  I give 4 stars for the meatball sandwich, 2 stars for my meal and two stars for the atmosphere and service."
Bryan R.,"San Ramon, CA",377,259,3024,2.0,7/14/2007,"BJ's, a 10 second review... Was looking forward to BJ's considering the sudden influx of restaurants in Vacaville as of late. Was so sick of eating the same old  s*** every day so whenever something new pops up, I'm there.  BJ's definitely has ""the look"" though the food itself is just so-so. Beer is pretty decent, pizza is good but that's about it. I've experimented with several different dishes but nothing quite compares to the pizza. Then again, you've got beer & you've got pizza, so what more do you need?"
Brian W.,"Mirrormont, WA",0,4,,2.0,9/24/2012,"Not overly impressed. Eat here alot and the service is slow and orders are almost always wrong and incomplete. Simple requests like substitute red onions for cucumbers seem beyond the capacities of the kitchen to handle. The pizookies are gross, just really gross."
Glenn C.,"San Francisco, CA",34,1,,1.0,3/12/2010,"BJ's is a chain and the food reflects it. Variety does not make for a great dinner, it just means there is a lot more crap to choose from. Making a ""retro blue cheese wedge salad"" does not make this place chic or upscale-- it just means they know their patrons like a nice chunk of iceberg lettuce. We usually go for drinks in the bar, for that it is ok but every now and then I drink too much and order food. Bad idea. I had the chicken with vermicelli. Please. Is it Italian, is it American???? It  is mostly just bland. A little seasoning might be nice. A friend had the burger-- just because they make it big does not make it good. Yuck. Dry, overcooked. Vacaville is full of chains, you could get a better meal at Chili's if you like that sort of place. Plus all the people who seem to really like BJ's look like Ed Hardy threw up on them. Typical Vacaville night on the town. You can do better folks! Oh yeah, and while we were there a belligerent drunk almost started a fight with his friends. Nice."
derrick i.,"Vacaville, CA",268,141,5,3.0,1/20/2010,"i wish gave half stars because this is really a 3.5 star rating... look out all you red lobsters and chevys.  you've been put on notice applebees and TGIFridays (RIP).  move it along Johnny Carinos and Mimis Cafe... Dennys, what the crap are you even doing here?!  SCRAM! there's a new upper-middleclass dining experience in town, and his name (restaurants are in the masculine, no?) is BJs... (also, by ""new"" i mean, a couple of years old...) i've been to BJs a handful of times now, and my perception of this place has gone from ""FTMeh..."" to ""Solid.""  and all my FTMeh experiences were back when this restaurant first opened so it would appear that they've worked out the kinks... their pizza is solid, there's better pizza but there's most definitely lesser pizza out there.  i've recently moved into trying thier sandwiches and they are quite good (i recommend their cuban burger.  it's delish!) one thing you may not know about this place, they do one of those mini-buffets if you have a party there and it's a SUPER good opportunity to try a bunch of things.   oh, and they make their own root beer... and it's AWESOME.  root beer for the doubleyou."
Linda C.,"San Leandro, CA",144,441,1,3.0,4/26/2007,"This must be a new place because the last time I was in vacaville it was nowhere to be seen! Anyways, this place is pretty standard for your chain restaurant/brewery.  Nice plasma screens showing different sports games all around the place - damn, warriors lost :( - the decor was pretty standard, wood with sports stuff all around, but I did REALLY like the mirrors that they had around the room and in the bathroom, they were just really pretty :)  Anyways, the food, pretty standard.  I had the jambalaya but it wasn't spicy enough but the bartender did pour a pretty good grey goose martini a tad bit on the expensive side though, especially in vacaville...the only complaint I really had about my drink was the fact that there was pieces of ice floating around in it.  Granted, it was only like two pieces, but still....a martini should be clear with no ice only chilled!  Again, not a big deal but sue me, I'm a purist....or something, ok fine I'm just picky :)  Three for standard fare, nice decor, relatively good service, and awesome mirrors!"
Kat H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",291,487,123,2.0,11/2/2007,"Thursday night in Vacaville = thumbs down. We were on our way back from a road trip and planned to meet up with our friends--they suggested BJ's--I don't know if they usually like this kind of food, I don't like chains. It was 7pm and parking was impossible (someone stole our spot even) and then the wait to be seated for 4 people was 30 minutes.  Found seats at the bar but it wasn't wiped down for about 30 minutes and the bartenders were too busy to be attentive to us.  Let me just say that I hate polyester fabric napkins--I would rather have toilet paper. They don't absorb anything and they slip off your lap. Anyway, this place uses them. After we finally ordered our food, the service was better; the food came and the bartender checked on us and refilled our drinks and asked about dessert. The food was okay--average stuff at average prices. The noise level was high and you couldn't hear past the person you were sitting next to. I was ready to get out of there after the 1.5 hours! Next time I'm going to pick the place."
Mike M.,"Vacaville, CA",50,33,16,4.0,2/20/2011,BJ's is a fun place.  I had a mini pizza and a seasonal beer.  Both were very tasty.  This particular location is usually pretty busy so we had to wait about 20 minutes.  Service is always great and the prices are very reasonable.  Kinda noisy on a Satruday night but it was not unbearable.
Rosan D.,"Castro Valley, CA",9,42,,4.0,1/7/2011,"I always love going to BJ's whether it's for lunch, dinner, or happy hour.  They have happy hour, and while it isn't the best one, the deal's are still pretty decent; 1/2 off mini pizzas is a pretty good deal considering their pizza's are delicious.  The bartenders always get my drinks right, I haven't had any issues of there either not being enough alcohol or too much, they have it up to par every time.  While the wait is sometimes long, there's a good chance you can sit at the bar and enjoy a beverage while waiting for your table to be ready."
Dave J.,"Folsom, CA",33,83,13,2.0,2/11/2013,"I've been to this BJ's twice, both times for lunch. To be fair, they are swamped at lunch time (unlike Red Robin across the parking lot from them). Unfortunately, both times, the service was slow. The first time, the service was passable, but not even close to great. The second time, my colleague and I sat there for 15 minutes before our waitress even came over. She finally took our order and then we waited for 45 minutes with no food. The waitress kept saying our food would be up soon, but it never showed, The manager came over and apologized and comped the meal, but it was painfully slow. It was hands down the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. To this day, i don't think it was the server's fault, though. I never got an explanation as to what happened, but she kept saying the food was coming, making me think SHE didn't forget so it must have been some kitchen SNAFU. I haven't gone back to that BJ's since, though."
Darrell S.,"Buckeye, AZ",210,306,3,4.0,10/26/2011,"I go here every time I get in town, or can find one.  The food is always good.  Always a line out the door.  The Jeremiah Red is the best beer there, in my op."
Mrs. W.,"Fremont, CA",61,22,,1.0,1/4/2012,"If there was a way to give this place a ZERO  star rating - I would.  Some friends and I stopped in on a Thursday evening in November for a quick dinner.  We were on our way to Tahoe for a long weekend.  I have a couple of food allergies - so I spoke to the server and asked her to check with the chef regarding the 2 items I'm allergic to.  She agreed to do that - but when she came back with my soup my allergy food was CLEARLY one of the ingredients.  When I asked her about it - she said ""I couldn't check because the soup comes from a can.""  WHAT?  She can't LOOK at the ingredients on the can - or ask the chef to do so?   The rest of my party already had their food - so I ate a side salad and asked her to return the soup.  No apology from the server.  No supervisor or manager came over to talk to us about this.   I had to ask the server to remove the soup from our bill.  On our way out, we tried to speak to the restaurant manager about it - but he just shrugged the entire incident off like it was no big deal.  I wasn't trying to get ""free"" or ""comped"" food from this place - I just wanted them to reassure me that they take food allergies seriously and that they'd make sure their people are properly trained.  Food allergies can be a life or death situation for people.  Of course mistakes can be made - but those who work in the food service industry need to do their job and not disregard a request as simple as checking ingredients.  ESPECIALLY a chain restaurant like BJ's.  I'll never go back there.  They are a deadly incident waiting to happen."
