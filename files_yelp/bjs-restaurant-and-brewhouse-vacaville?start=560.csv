Rosemari Z.,"Sacramento, CA",25,4,1,3.0,3/28/2011,Food is great. Service is just horrible. Out of the several times I've been there only got good service twice. Rather go to Sacramento location.
Barbara W.,"Vacaville, CA",7,36,,4.0,3/27/2013,"As always this place is busy, even on Monday eve. We got in just before 630 pm and was seated almost immediately. We ordered steak, fish tacos & a roast beef sandwich:all were tastey. Service was good as was the beer/rootbeer /cider we ordered to go w/ our meals. Glad we have a BJ's in Vacaville. Just be prepared to wait if you're there after 630."
Rebecca R.,"Vacaville, CA",69,6,2,3.0,5/30/2011,Food is good but pricey! Service is a hit or miss! Ask for Julian or kaley! They are great
Kaitlyn P.,"Santa Clara, CA",31,46,,4.0,2/23/2010,"Make sure you get a reservation when you visit this place. It's the only BJ in town so it can get quite busy! Overall, I always get the best service and food whenever I come here."
Duaine F.,"Norton, KS",0,19,17,4.0,6/5/2010,"Ten (10) of us ate at BJ's today. I must give it four stars mostly because the waitress, Nichole, placed them in a superior category. I very seldom give 5 stars. Everything must be exceptional. I must, however, rate Nichole as a 5 star waitress.  We had to wait to be seated because there were numerous graduating parties which were not a problem. The moment we were seated our drink orders were taken. The drinks were delivered in a timely fashion. Exactly the right time was given to peruse the menu and make our decisions. Nichole was very efficient in taking our orders and getting drinks and meals to the correct people with no hitches.  I ordered the unlimited soup (clam chowder) and Caesar salad. Both the soup and salad I must point out were delicious. The waitress was quick to point out that I had unlimited soup refills. I did make use of that offer. I have ordered this before and as then was greatly pleased. This time I found out that I could have a different kind of soup for the other bowls.  Nichole had drink refills to the tables before a glass was empty, took away dirty dishes, etc. I know some of this is in the job description, but many don't do it.  I probably enjoyed my meal even more since my son and his family was treating me."
Eric D.,"Cornelius, NC",104,376,685,4.0,8/16/2008,"BJ's is a typical, in some ways, Micro Brewery/ Restaurant.  It differs from RAM, Rock Bottom Brewery, and etc. because I liked this one.   Atmosphere - Busy, stripmall-ish restaurant w/an open and spacious feel.   Service - Angela was prompt and helpful. Food - To start, I had a pint of their Blonde ale.  This was chosen after the server provided a couple of samples, as I had a hard time choosing.  I then proceeded with a house salad that was a little basic, nothing exciting.  For the main dish I went w/Balsamic Chicken w/garlic potatoes and shoestring onions on a bed of mixed greens.  It was surprisingly very good because as opposed to other places of this ilk, BJ's used fresh chicken!!!  For dessert (I always get dessert) I had their signature Pizookie.  The server again helped as I could not decide and allowed me to get half oatmeal raisin, half chocolate chip.  The Pizookie was served warm w/two scoops of ice-cream.  Although very good, next time I would do two different halves as the oatmeal cookie's flavor over powered the chocolate chip flavor. Overall - A nice experience for the quality and for the money @ $22.65, plus tip.  I will definitely visit here again."
Kirsten H.,"Union City, CA",23,55,1,4.0,11/3/2008,"After coming here a couple times and being deterred by their long wait, me and my bf finally made it in here. We did our standard appetizers and drinks thingy that we do on friday nights. The bruchetta was good (not authentic Italian, but good) with a ton of bread and topping, the popstickers had good sauce and the potato skins with okay. My bf liked the red ale and the beer sampler ( 4 mini beers for around 6.00).  I was fond of their ""strawberry confusion"" drink, but my purple hooter and lemon drop did not live up to my expectations. Our waitress was pretty good and checked up on us for refills and new orders which was good, because we were their for awhile!  Definately a step above other chains, and worth the bit more in price. I will be back to sample the rest of the food!"
Taryy B.,"Fairfield, CA",59,1,1,3.0,5/6/2011,Take so dam long. Haven't ate yet. Ordered 45 mind ago...update: we found out they lost our order so the manager gave us everything for free. Bad day became a great day.
Kevin D.,"Vacaville, CA",39,157,57,3.0,11/27/2010,Not bad for a chain. Beer is good. Pizza is great. Some of the culinary creations are good too.
Juana S.,"San Pablo, CA",398,307,1057,3.0,3/4/2008,"FRIDAY NIGHT: It was pack we sat in the bar area, it only took someone to come and get our drink and food order about 30 minutes I was so annoyed not only that to get our food and drinks took another 30 minutes so not the best place to go on a crowded Friday night but if you are feeling patient go for it the ""Blonde"" bee is awesome SUNDAY AFTERNOON:  I brought my parents and siblings along with my toddler the waitress was nice there was no wait for a table, the down fall is that all the tables are so close to each other so my son wants to get down from his high chair so I'm having to excuse my self to our fellow neighbors, the pasta was not that great kind of bland I like the pizza better so around this time of course more family type of scene."
Angela C.,"Benicia, CA",106,311,96,3.0,8/11/2008,"Typical bar/grill type feel with lots of noise and TV screens all around. It's always very busy on weekends with semi-long waits. The cool thing is that they usually take you in in about half the time they say it will be. So, your 1hr wait is more likely to be 30-45 mins (in my experience). The food is good but can sometimes be a bit slow to get out. I like the variety on the menu. They have a good assortment for just about everyone - meat eaters, vegetarians, etc. I got the spinach/artichoke pizza and it was really yummy. I think I would have preferred a smaller crust, though. Servers are always friendly and accommodating.  It's a good place to bring a group of friends on a Fri/Sat night."
Richard A.,"Fresno, CA",4,8,11,5.0,4/22/2011,Best bjs ive been to so far......been to ones in LA & Fresno.......great food ......decent prices......for newbies try artichoke and spinach pizza or california burger......avocado egg rolls best thing on the menu......
Jenn T.,"San Jose, CA",7,115,9,5.0,7/29/2008,I love the staff here. I've been to 2 other bj's in the southbay and this place was so much better. the staff was nicer and the service was quicker. i'd totally come back here for cocktails and pazookie. yummmm
Misty M.,"Sacramento, CA",13,2,,1.0,12/8/2012,"It was a very unfortunate experience at the BJs in Vacaville. I am a big BJs fan but the Vacaville team truly needs some work. Ordered avocado egg rolls which came out quick followed by our side salads for 3. After we finsished those we waited 40 minutes for 2 tortilla soups and a chicken wanton small plate. The waiter was a nice guy but he handled the situation all wrong. Was not very apologetic and blamed the back of the house for not having our food ready. He even commented that ""he yelled at them."" We weren't impressed by that. We paid our full bill and left. No compensation offered and no efforts to turn our experience around. Not looking for any freebies just would have liked to see management out on the floor and acknowledge less that than satisfied customers and offered an apology."
jennay v.,"Vallejo, CA",9,26,,4.0,7/22/2008,Four great big stars for dessert!  The Chocolate Chunk Pizookie comes out warm with a healthy scoop ice cream.   I can't put my spoon down. Plus - Skinny fries!   Minus - The fetuccini was a bit too al dente for me and all the alfredo sauce was on the bottom... how'd that happen. Plus - The chicken on the fetuccini was tasty Minus - The wait to get our food was sooo long AND it wasn't really that busy.  Good thing my pizookie came out in a timely manner or I was going to have to get ugly.
Margie N.,"Graton, CA",18,14,3,3.0,12/31/2010,"It was what we expected... Food was okay, but we only ordered apps... The red ale was good and as described... The pale ale was very good and the finish of Cascade hops was delicious! A superb ale in my book. Was BJ's above ordinary? No... Would I go back? Yes... Would I recommend it? Yes... Matt was a nice, attentive server."
Janette D.,"Fairfield, CA",2,23,,3.0,2/13/2009,"The food here is good. My girlfriends and I ordered the sampler appetizer which was pretty yummy. I had the Parmesan chicken it was good, but did not care for the sauce on the chicken. I must say the service has gotten a bit better. Our waitress was nice and she checked on us frequently.  Parking is a pain especially if your going on a Friday night or Saturday night."
J R.,"Orlando, FL",3,18,1,4.0,10/1/2010,"The food is good and the ambiance is pretty good! The sports bar area needs more tables which face the TVs or perhaps they need more TVs! Overall the food prices, service and quality is great!"
Eli M.,"Vallejo, CA",238,222,77,4.0,3/26/2010,"decided to check it out last weekend since we never been to this location. waited an hour, quickly served, great food and good times.  i would go again also try the tasters if you arent sure what beer to have! there are so many choices and the tasters are $1.50  each so it is cheap to have a good time!"
Sarah L.,"Danville, CA",11,127,1,3.0,7/12/2009,I had the deep dish pizza with sausage and mushroom and field of greens salad Pros: I really enjoy the crust on their pizza!  The salad was fresh with lots of toppings - I especially enjoyed the candied pecans Cons: The mushrooms were a bit undercooked.  There was too much dressing on the salad - the raspberry walnut vinaigrette was a bit too strong I always enjoy their deep dish pizza.  Huge menu - lots of choices!  I wish there was one closer to where I live
