Eric K.,"Dublin, CA",45,1116,9,1.0,4/6/2008,"No.... its for sure... this place sucks.... Ok... get there at 12:50... ""30 min wait"".... 45 mins later.. we get seated... then we have to ask for the lunch special menu... ok.. then it takes forever for the lady to come back around.... order...and I think we waited another 30 minutes for our food.... what the heck? So I get my cobb salad... or so I thought... the bleu cheese was LAME, the  bacon was like the leftover knuckles of something that used to be meat, the egg was disgusting... and worse of all.. I thought I ordered salad, but it was more along the consistency of coleslaw... over dressed, over shredded... and just mush.  My brother mentioned that his salad had the same base(of mush) with only slightly different toppings obviously added on after the fact. Oh... and our drinks sat forever without being refilled, the dishes from the appetizers didn't get removed till they were clearing the table from our main courses... and the pizza sat on our table for a good 5 minutes before someone decided to bring a spatula thing so that we could get it out of the pan. I really don't mind BJ's... but I'm not eating at BJ's Brewery or whatever you wanna call it."
robert b.,"San Francisco, CA",220,183,7,3.0,3/25/2008,"This place is a great chain franchise.The quality of the food is pretty tasty. The beer's on draft are the main reason one would go here, but the pizza they serve is good as well.  My favorite here is tie Cj's Ribs and the roast chicken. Both of which are juicy and done the right way. Only problem I have is that I can never finish what I order here, typically havint to take it home.  At the end that poozokie is freaking amazing. A hot cookie in a pan with ice cream, where have you been my entire life. give me a poozokie..."
Sunie K.,"Oakland, CA",150,45,1,4.0,2/12/2010,"I love the spicy spaghetti, it's the only thing I get! Also, you should try the beer sampler. Service is usually ok, not the best, but nothing to complain about."
Danny S.,"Oceanside, CA",1,6,5,3.0,9/28/2010,Food was pretty good. Had the pulled pork sandwich and the strawberry lemonade was On POINT! Waiter was not so attentive but he was working another table with like 10 ppl so I let it slide. I'll go back for game day for sure.
Jermaine B.,"Vacaville, CA",35,37,,4.0,1/28/2010,"Overall this place is not bad, considering Vacaville is pretty limited in terms of dining options,and overall decent bar/pub experiences. The food is pretty good, although it is surely nothing to write home about.  The service is up to par, in addition to having some pretty cute or hot waitresses.  The beer....honestly is not that bad... Can't really complain, considering the wide variety to satisfy your palette (from blonde to stout).  Along with having a  specialty or seasonal beer depending on the time of year...my fave is the Grand Cru"
Nancy R.,"San Francisco, CA",278,237,9,4.0,1/20/2009,"GREAT waiter service, very attentive, great food, great beer, SO YUMMY. Much better than the location at Del Amo Fashion Center :P Check it out if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."
Ashanna B.,"Vacaville, CA",65,37,34,4.0,11/28/2009,I've eaten at BJ's about 5 times now and I have to say that the managers/owners are definitely doing something right! It's wonderful. From the atmosphere to the appetizers to the quality of service from the staff... It's probably the best place for a casual restaurant in the area... Ask for Shannon ( she's really nice). Cheers!
Lacey K.,"Vacaville, CA",42,61,18,3.0,1/22/2009,This is the only Bj's I have been to so I don't know if it is a chain issue but the service here in Vacaville is super SLOW! Make sure you have plenty of time and are in no hurry. The food here is good I have eaten here many of time with friends and coworkers. My newest favorite is the Tomato Basil thin crust pizza a girl friend and I got it for an appetizer and it was wonderful I was tempted to get another for my dinner...lol I didn't I decided on a shrimp pasta that was also wonder full. If you have time take the exit off of 80 and try it out.
J D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,25,7,3.0,2/11/2012,"Been there a bunch of times with family when I'm in town. Had great service this last visit, one of the 1st times we had a server that was on top our drinks and gave us updates on our food order. I would give five starts but the manager was kind of a prick. I was ordering my meal (we had a party of five) and as I was ordering a bus boy ran by and nailed the side of my head, so hard that I had to stop ordering and re gather my self, the waitress was very understanding but the bus boy was like ""oops and just keep running"" totally an asshole move. I got up and went to the bathroom to gather myself and put a bit of water in my hair so I did look like I just woke up. The manager was outside the bathroom and I waited patiently for him and he would just look up and then look down, so I finally just walked and said ""you are the manager right?"" and of course he said yes, I told him what happen and said that I know you are busy but that was unacceptable, I wasn't even asking for anything free just an ""I'm sorry or I'll talk to him or who was it please point them out"".  But he was just like ""ok,ok,ok"", like I was bugging him. Just another middle aged, balding, over weight restaurant chain manager. It is sad, because again I wasn't causing a scene or asking for anything free, and he was a total prick. I will discontinue visiting the restaurant, which is also sad due to them building a new on in my home town (only about 30 miles away) as we speak and I routinely take my 25 employees out to lunch, at least twice a week if not more, and BJ's will not be on that list once it opens."
Mandi K.,"Fairfield, CA",374,186,553,2.0,9/21/2008,The food has gotten worse. My boyfriend got sick from eating the chicken sandwich. Mini pizza for 10 bucks?...not worth it
Ashley W.,"Benicia, CA",87,270,36,5.0,8/5/2009,"I love this place!  The atmosphere is awesome and the food is too.  The service has always been great everytime I go there.  The ONLY downfall is that there is normally a long wait.  I can't wait until they are done building the one in Concord, that's going to be my spot for sure!"
Rocio S.,"Long Beach, CA",0,28,,4.0,1/16/2011,"I've been here a couple of times and I really like this location. The wait here can be kinda ridiculous sometimes, so if you're heading out here on a popular day, like a weekend, I would suggest calling before hand and asking what the wait time is or getting on the wait list. Besides that, the food is great, when is is not? The service is great too, compared to other BJ's I've been too. I've only had one time where I had a problem, where there was a hair in my alfredo fettucini, but they were nice about it. They didn't ask questions, apologized a little too much, comped my food and asked if I wanted a replacement free of charge. I was kinda disgusted and lost my appetite so I politely declined, but I've been to other restaurants where they have treated me or someone in my party like dirt when we find something wrong with our food. Here they were very nice and apologetic about it."
Patricia C.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/24/2012,"By far this was the worst dining experience I've ever had. My friends and I frequent BJ's often and after the experience from yesterday I can honestly say I have my doubts of this place.  At approximately 1pm on 4/12 we arrive to BJ's (group of 4) we asked to be seated at a booth, the lady that was seating us rolled her eyes to the other hostess. Okay, we didn't say anything, I'm sure our request was an inconvenience. We get seated and order our drinks and appetizers. We wait and finally get our ice teas and they are brought without lemon or sugar. We ask and wait again. Our appetizer platter is brought to our table and the person who brought it asks if we need plates (irrelevant question to ask when a group of 4 people are sharing a large appetizer platter.) Our lunch plates our served to us and the person just walked away...we didn't even get a chance to ask for ketchup or anything else. We try to get our servers attention but she ignored us (I understand that you can get busy but we were pretty much neglected) finally we flag another person down and ask for ketchup and mustard...by that time some of our food had got cold, our drinks were not refilled and our server had not bothered to check on us.  The bill is brought and we paid and still left a reasonable tip of 25% (we understand people have bad days). As we were getting up to leave and walking towards the door the waitress shouts ""Ladies you didn't pay your bill"" I have never had anything like that happen to me ever!! We kindly go back to the table where she is (she was at our table) and show her we did pay the bill. She did not even apologize, just turned and walked away. I have never been so humiliated in public like I was yesterday at BJ's in Vacaville. We ask to speak to a manager (because at this point...your establishment should know how bad we as paying customers were treated.) The manager pretty much just replied ""OK"" and said it was probably all a misunderstanding but didn't even seem sincere. I really am not one to complain but I feel the need to let you know how we were treated. I am hoping you take this feedback seriously and bring it to your staff's attention as I would not want this to happen to another customer."
Danielle V.,"Columbus, MS",0,10,,4.0,12/2/2009,"It's always nice to have a little brewery in your town... the booze is pretty much the main reason I go.  They have a pretty wide selection of apps/food to choose from, so you can please pretty much anyone.  I am a fan of their great white pizza and their CA chicken sandwich.   I will say that the service is sub-par... definitely try to limit your party size, if possible... the more people in a party, the more ridiculously horrible the service gets.   But again, my friends and I are fans because the beer is pretty darn decent, so we deal."
Roseabelle M.,"Dublin, CA",65,91,5,4.0,6/13/2009,"Its about time Vacaville got a cool joint to hang out at. . .even though it is a chain. The menu reminds me of a cross between E-bar and the Cheesecake Factory. Lots of choices. I got the lettuce wraps. . .they were WAY to spicey for me, but that's okay, my Mojito cooled my mouth down perfectly. Perfect place for me and my sisters to have a girls' lunch and catch up."
Josh D.,"Hayward, CA",1,15,,4.0,3/28/2010,"Okay, so this is going to be a mixed review, my girlfriend loved it. she had the huge loaded potato, and i got rushed into some pasta that i def. regret ordering. i had the Cajun pasta which was dry, and very bland. the service was pretty good. our waiter was good on the drinks and friendly. i would give this place another try. the pizza looked good. and i would like to try the beer too. i would def. recommend this place!"
Vince O.,"Bay Area, CA",173,37,42,2.0,4/3/2009,... maybe 1 or 2 good servers outta maybe 25... few and far between... inexperience and untrained staff all around... went there when they first opened and expected horrible service and got it... went back 6 months later...and had the exact same experience...?!? wtf?...  I even wrote to their corporate offices in Costa Mesa and the west coast sales V.P. gave me a $50.00 giftcard to try it again.... used the card and haven't been back since... go somewhere else if you think about having a impromptu special event there...cheers.
Rise G.,"San Francisco, CA",3,241,13,3.0,4/25/2009,Very accomidating to bigger groups.  We didn't have to wait too long for a table for seven people on a Saturday afternoon.  The service was ok.  My california chicken sandwich and wedge fries were pretty good.  The salads others got were very large and looked good.  The berry cider is probably my new favorite cider.  I live so far away so I am sad that I won't be able to get it soon enough.
Robert D.,"San Jose, CA",5,44,,4.0,7/23/2011,griled salmon is the best and the service is very   chardoney is.awesome
Jnzl D.,"Emeryville, CA",31,68,2,4.0,12/3/2008,"I have one word...PIZOOKIE!!!!!! Oh yeah, you can mix and match the flavors, my personal fave is the Oreo....ohhhh I'm drooling just thinking about it. The regular deep dish pizza is delicioso as well. The rest of the food....just eh. I'd order beer and pizza and top it off with pizookie.  The wait always sucks..but the pizookie is worth it :)"
