EDGAR G.,"Downey, CA",0,20,,1.0,8/24/2017,"I'm sorry, but this is the worst BJ's I've eaten at. The only good thing here was the service and the beer . The 3 appetizers we had were subpar. The meals were below average in quality. My rib eye was super salty to the point I had to scrape the salt off the steak. The asparagus was just as salty to the point I had to leave half of the serving.  We had to pass on desert fearing the same outcome. I hope BJ's reads this review with the hope they address these issues."
Henry V.,"Oakland, CA",253,13,212,1.0,8/12/2017,"Most likely not coming back to this location again. We were seated and it took about 10 minutes for a waiter to come greet us. After, the appetizer was served it took awhile to get utensils. All the order eventually came out except mine which took 10+ minutes. Once it came out they forgot about my fries and bacon... Please work on the service here. Thanks"
Gregory F.,"Vacaville, CA",197,2,4,2.0,12/4/2016,"Its been a while since I've eaten over here. Now I know why, my girl and I wanted to eat a good diner and have some drinks after having a rough night so we decided to come here. My girl had the jambalaya and I had the steak and i felt it wasn't worth what I paid for. I don't think i will be returning here any time soon. I really wish i could say the food was on point, but it wasn't. I'm giving a two stars since the server was pretty good and made sure he tired to accommodate us as well as all the other tables he had by himself."
Red W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/23/2017,Poor service! So so food. The wait after we got our table just to get water was 25 minutes. Really?
Lori R.,"Trego, MT",1488,526,588,5.0,9/4/2015,"Been always wanting to try BJ's Brewhouse before and funny there is one in my own home town but I travel out of town to give it a try and it was a great experience.  First off we were meeting friends that we haven't seen in awhile and they chose here to meet at noon on a Thursday afternoon and we arrived about 11:45. We were a party of 6 and were sat in a large booth. Seat immediately which was nice.  Our server took our drink order and offered us if we wanted any appetizers and we declined since the meals looked pretty big.  I chose to have two appetizers for my meal one was a fairly new item that they were promoting was Brussels sprouts sautéed in honey with Sriracha cream sauce and the Bacon Mac n Cheese. My hubby chose the shrimp scampi pasta. And our companions chose a Blue cheese burger, fried artichoke hearts, pulled BBQ pork sandwich and a cheeseburger.  First off my Brussel sprouts were amazing just the right amount of sauté and sauce on them not too spicy. The Mac n Cheese was the twisty noodles it was served in a small dish since it was an appetizer portion that came with two pieces of toast, which was too much carbs. The Mac n Cheese was flavorful with bacon but not creamy by any means. My husband said his shrimp dish was very good and it was a very large portion. All the other diners in our group were very satisfied with their food and our server was excellent.  I guess I will have to give the BJ's in our town a try as I really liked the food, service and atmosphere."
Brenda M.,"Vacaville, CA",28,17,8,5.0,8/3/2017,"Went in on Tuesday night to have a girls night/reunion got seated right away and immediately came our server Jannette. She was amazing and had a great personality! I'm a very picky eater and I love mashed potatoes but I noticed theirs say it's ""white cheddar mashed potatoes"". I'm not a fan of most cheeses, one of which is cheddar, I had never tried white cheddar so I asked her if there was any way of just making the mashed potatoes without the cheese. She went the extra mile when she told me they were really good and couldn't taste the cheese much and asked if I wanted a sample before I ordered. Personally I've never really been given a sample of food at a restaurant so I pictured a spoonful of it. To my surprise she brought it in a small bowl and I loved them! I thought it was so sweet of her to let me try it before I committed! She was super attentive! Unfortunately she did leave in the middle of our meal without a notice to us so we were pretty bummed when a different server came. Wish we would have known because we really wanted a bigger tip just for her.  Definitely makes me want to go back on a Tuesday night now that I know it's wine down Tuesday and wine is all 50% off bottle or glass!!"
Richard B.,"Sacramento, CA",66,119,206,5.0,1/18/2016,"Came here on a Saturday evening, bjs was pretty packed. There was a wait for tables about 10-20 minutes and 10-15 people waiting in the take out order section. It was completely full. Me and my girlfriend luckily found a spot in the bar section and were able to get service in less than 3 minutes. BJs is an extremely versatile restaurant. It's great for watching sports, they have 5 large (60inch+) top quality  tvs in their bar area alone. Then there are more tvs dispersed throughout the restaurant to the point where you can view a TV from any point in the restaurant. BJs is also great for families, friends, groups, or just a bro lookin to grab a brew, very versatile, anybody and everybody comes here. The selection of food here is deep. They got steaks, burgers, salads, pasta, just to name a few. The menu is like 20 pages no lie... Eh maybe a tiny bit exaggerated. Let's talk about some of the go to items. Appetizers = fried calamari, fried to perfection and comes with ranch and marinara sauce that makes for a great starter.  The bbq brisket burger was extremely delicious, if you like bbq burgers, you'll love that. And for the rest of their extensive menu, i would say it's all above average, which is a compliment in my book. PIZOOOKIEEEEE!!!! If you have never heard of the bjs pizookie, somethin must be wrong you. This ice cream cookie combo will make your mouth melt. Top 3 pizookies according to my statistics are A) Original, chocolate chip cookie + vanilla ice cream, no you're boring. B) Salted Caramel, salted caramel is trending in life. C) Ghirardelli Triple chocolate. Moral of the story: pizookie is life. The service at this BJs was top notch. Taylor was our waiter and he's extremely friendly and attentive. There are two types of service, there's ""what do you want?"" and there's ""how can I help you?"" The service here was the latter, I'm impressed. Kindness is not a weakness and nice guys don't finish last. See you next time BJs."
Doug M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2017,"I ordered a grill cheese sandwich with fries.   The waitress (Brianna) brought my sandwich and then said the fries would be out soon.   Luckily I didn't wait for the fries, as my sandwich would have been cold.    I was hungry and started eating my sandwich and she brought me my fries 10 minutes later after I finished my sandwich!    She then asked me if I wanted her to box them up - REALLY!!!   No apology."
Alaska R.,"Vacaville, CA",1,3,1,1.0,6/29/2017,Went there for the first time been living in vacaville 4 years nice town right ?? Went to dinner with my family of 5 left around 9pm and left my new ray ban sunglasses on the table !! called at 7am spoke to a manager and my glasses wer never turned in. The worst part of it all is I asked him if he could at least ask my waiter (which I knew her name or the buster that night which I described him ) but he assured no one would steal them SO WHERE ARE MY SUNGLASSES?? he could care less very disappointed
Melissa W.,"Marysville, CA",75,19,2,4.0,7/13/2017,"Everything was really good! I had an amazing salad and my son had the clam chowder. Service was great, the food was great!"
Kimberly H.,"Vacaville, CA",16,87,40,2.0,7/9/2017,"I love this place, but the cooking staff was off their game today. Our family of 4 walked in and we were instantly seated. There were only a few parties inside and we were helped by our amazing server who made this experience tolerable. We sent our orders in, and, our server kept checking on us, because she knew we were waiting for a very long time. She even came to our table and apologized, telling us that we had been waiting for 35 minutes. Parties around us who were seated after us received their food ahead of us. My Mediterranean pizza, which is one of my favorite items, was cold! My parents ordered the pancake combo. We've ordered that entree in the past and have enjoyed it every time. We're used to their fluffy, delicious pancakes! Today, however, the pancakes were so thin and my mom's bacon was overcooked. The manager even stopped by our table to give his apologizes, and they gave us a free churro dessert (which was the only redeeming food we had). Like I said, I love this place and appreciated the service we received from our server, but the food was unacceptable. Something must have been off in the kitchen. To be fair, in the many years I've been coming here, this was the first bad experience. It happens. I'm sure I'll be back again in the next month or so, and it's a better food experience."
Courtney L P.,"Sacramento, CA",4,30,5,1.0,3/25/2017,Everything was over cooked but we couldn't even send it back because our waiter won't even give us the time of day.
Jeff W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,18,3,2.0,11/5/2016,"This has been one of my go to spots for a good beer and some decent meals. On my last visit I was very disappointed in the service and the food. My meal was served without the side that was to accompany the dish. The server said the side would be right out....it never came out. After I ate my entire sandwich and reminded my server I still did not have the rest of my meal she went and got it for me. I understand that things happen, but the fact that the food was ordered by one employee, delivered to the table by another, and the fact I had to ask a third server about the issue shows very poor communication between employees.  I spoke to the manager about the issue and I was greatful that he comped my meal. I will return and try this place again, but it may be a while."
Sara K.,"Jacksonville, NC",54,6,,1.0,3/20/2017,"FOOD POISONING!!!!!!!!! Went to BJ's Sunday around 2:30pm. To make this short, waited an hour for appetizers to be brought out, which were ordered immediately and then had to wait another 10 minutes for plates. 30 minutes to receive a beer, Didn't ever receive a soup that was ordered, sandwich that comes with avocado was not served with avocado and also had rotting limp brown lettuce. Chicken was on the verge of looking just barely cooked and serve-able. Waited 10 minutes for sides of ranch that were ordered with meals to be brought out. Extra entrees were brought to our table that weren't even ordered by our party. To top it all off that night we were all sick to our stomachs. Food poisoning in its greatest form!!! This bjs is so disorganized and disgusting. Need to fire the kitchen staff and start fresh. Will not be returning to this location for a long time!"
Elizabeth M.,"South San Francisco, CA",20,107,180,2.0,3/11/2016,"I really don't understand why a certain server hates me so much. The last two times she has made it very clear that she doesn't care for me or my party and I'm quite confused about it.  She's walked past our table plenty of times without saying a word and when she does talk to us she keeps it to a low, minimum hush. I swear I'm not a terrible customer. I say please and thank you. I smile and I tip just like I would like to be tipped. So I really don't get it. I haven't seen her interact with other customers but damn, I hope she treats them better than me.  Food is uniform at BJ's so I can't complain about that. The pazookies are always a winner. Happy Hours will save you a good chunk of change if you fill up on appetizers."
Evan A.,"Benicia, CA",530,77,424,4.0,2/25/2016,"I had been to BJ's before, but this was my first time eating at this location. From what I had remembered, BJ's has always only been mediocre. I was never going to BJ's for anything other than a pizookie. Maybe they changed their menu or I had just been ordering the wrong thing, cause everything I had this time was pretty exceptional. We were there as a party of 5 on a Tuesday evening around 6:30PM. It was surprisingly pretty busy, but we were seated within 5-10 mins. Just enough time for us to grab a quick drink at the bar! We ordered some avocado eggrolls and mozarella sticks to start with. Both were absolutely delicious! The avocado was super fresh and creamy, and the dipping sauce it came with was amazing! Some of us were even dipping our cheese sticks in it! The cheese sticks were also fryed to perfection. Very cheesy and just enough cruchy. Pretty much everything I could ask for when it comes to mozarella sticks. For my entree I decided to go with the deep dish baked ziti. They could have done a little better on this, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. I would have liked maybe a little bit more cheese, but they did really well with the penne noodles and the various meats (pepperoni, sausage, etc) they threw in with it. There were also some random spaghetti noodles in the dish which was kind of weird, but I don't feel like it altered the flavor of the dish in anyway. I also ordered the honey sriracha brussel sprouts. Fried brussel sprouts with a creamy honey sriracha sauce?! What more could you ask for?? The best part was the crunchyness of the brussel sprouts dipped in the sauce which was just the right amount of sweet and spicy! They could have used a little more sauce either in the dish or on the side, but I would still definitely order these again! For dessert we shared a pizookie sampler with a chocolate chunk, peanut butter, and salted caramel pizookie. They took a little while to bring these out after we ordered them due to the kitchen being slammed with lots of pizzas and pizookies according to our waitress. We were so excited when they finally came, we dug in right away. They were all good, but the salted caramel one was definitely my favorite! It would have been nice if they noted that there were chocolate chips with the salted caramel one, cause I might have just ordered my own! I wanted the salted caramel one but was also craving chocolate, so since I didn't know the salted caramel one came with chocolate, I agreed to share the sampler to guarantee me some chocolate."
Austin T.,"Downey, CA",291,3,,5.0,3/13/2017,"Food was great and had the best service ever! Ally was such a great waiter. She was super fast with refilling our drinks , cleaning the table , and very attentive to all our needs. Next time you guys are here ask for her!"
Trina R.,"Vacaville, CA",0,32,4,5.0,7/4/2017,"The food gets 5 stars but the service isn't as great. Every time we go for some odd reason - some server breaks plates, we're next to huge loud annoying big parties and on 2 occasions kids have thrown up right next to our table. Last time, one server spilled a drink all over our table. I think the shitty service is worth the hassle though for the food. All the drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are good and the food is always fresh and tasty."
Henry A.,"Fairfield, CA",2,15,,5.0,7/26/2017,Ordered a chicken-fried steak hamburger without the bun. They made it to order and it was delicious. When i tried to pay i realized i had a deleted credit card on my mobile app and manager allowed me to take care of it at home as i left my wallet at home. I am a regular so that might have been a factor
Yolanda J.,"San Francisco, CA",1,9,3,1.0,10/23/2016,Food very cold.Manager said he would personally cook and bring back. Did he do that no the guy from in the back brought food back to table after waiting 55 minutes to eat and he made sure the food was hot. I would not recommend this place for attentive service or warm food. And you have to look for your server. Once they drop food they are gone. Manager nice but no follow through. And guess what it is after 9 on Sunday not crowded at all. Do not come here to expect good service
