Andrea T.,"Baltimore, MD",0,33,,4.0,5/15/2009,"Okay, I know it's a chain, but I like it. Their food is tasty and their beer hits the spot. It is a little noisy here and a wait can be long. If you call ahead, you can get your name on the list before you get there!!"
Erin W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/14/2009,"I'm a huge fan of BJ's.  Go there for just lunch with the family or for get togethers and birthday's.  Never had a complaint.  My family and I dined in last Saturday, waited an hour to sit in a dirty table all the way back in the corner where they store xtra chairs..noticed that hostess was sitting everyone at dirty tables, the buser would clear the plates etc. but never once was any of the tables washed that people were being seated at..  Not saying I will not eat there again, but when I sit I will definitely request my table to be cleaned....!!!!"
Stan C.,"Vacaville, CA",10,3,,4.0,4/27/2011,yes this place is good but not allways that good for the 25 to 45 min wait to eat ....but the mico brews is great ...go for the beer and the cookie with ice cream
MaryGrace V.,"Pittsburg, CA",137,200,164,3.0,3/4/2008,"Hmm, the hard berry cider and the pazzoookie is your best choice!  Great place usually to have a birthday dinner 'cuz of the bar, but I don't think they take reservations and their lines are always super long.  So get there early or else you'll starve!"
Aileen M.,"Fairfield, CA",0,27,,2.0,2/8/2009,"We went there as a group about 12 of us and had a bad experience.  We called ahead of time and made reservations. They gave us only 2 tables which did not fit 12 people adequately. We asked to attach another table and they basically ignored us. We took another table and attached it ourselves.  My friend had brought her toddler son and he was grumpy so she took him outside to get some fresh air. When she came back to her surprise her pizza had been taken. She only ate 2 slices. No one asked if she was done, they took it. We complained to the manager who gave her a new pizza to go but that was real bad service. Also they changed waitress on us 3 times. You would assume that if a waitress was scheduled to take her 15 break they would not give her a table with 12 people.  Also when our food came they yelled out ""who had the _____"" they did not know who's food belonged to who ....and the waitress asked one of my friends to reach out for her food LOL..REAL BAD SERVICE if you are in a large group. Better service when its 2-4 people. It's a nice restaurant but they don't seem to know how to handle large crowds."
Anna H.,"West Covina, CA",41,174,,4.0,4/30/2008,The food here is decent.  Majority of the entrees on the menu are good but there are a few that are totally off the wall.  The pizza is good but nothing to write home about especially not for that price.  Almost $10 for a little personal pizza?  You on crack?!!  The service is hit or miss here at times but it's tolerable.  The thing to have is the pizookie though.  I can come here and not eat and just get the pizookie and I would be happy.  The chicken ceasar sandwich is good and their fries are delicious.  I haven't been here in a long time so I think I'm due for a trip back.  Minus one star for not having rbk's though. Seriously wtf.
Lauren L.,"Vacaville, CA",0,24,,2.0,9/4/2010,Food is mediocre. Service is quick.  Lines are obscenely long.  It's just another chain restaurant catering to bland food and bad beer.
darrin l.,"Berkeley, CA",0,32,,3.0,6/3/2012,"bj's has a decent selection for everybody in the family no matter what age.  layout of restaurant makes it open without being noisy and with plenty of natural light.  the service we had was excellent but cannot say the same for the food.  the dishes we had included fried calamari, small bbq chicken pizza, one of their specialty burgers and scampi in angel hair pasta.  they rated ok, nothing more.  the lunch time sunday we went the place was full despite many other dining options within a one-mile radius."
LIANA R.,"McChord AFB, WA",100,15,,4.0,10/1/2009,"I gave this place a 4 because service is always a little slow due to its always busy. The food is great. We had 2 pizzas, brushetta, spinach/artichoke dip, wings, nachos.  We had so much left over to take home. Also if it's your b-day you get a free pizookie so Yum!"
Ashley M.,"Fairfield, CA",6,13,,5.0,5/22/2009,"Whenever i am going to the vacaville outlets i always have to stop at BJ's one of my favorite restaurants! Tonight the wait was 30 minutes, but it was well worth it! It went by fast. I would recommend starting off with the wedge salad, which is a wedge piece of iceberg lettuce with chopped tomatoes, onions and bacon. the dressing is blue cheese. with pieces of crumbled blue cheese. then i would recommend the sourdough bread bowl with clam chowder. Its like you are at pier 39! Amazing food!!!!"
Edward P.,"Fairfield, CA",13,13,,3.0,2/17/2009,"This place is not a bad place to hang out if you're in Vacaville.  The food is OK, not great, not dreadful.  I'm sure some things are better than others, but plan on eating your standard fodder of grease if you get an appetizer or entree.  I got the Blackened Chicken Sandwich and being one who likes things on the spicy side, the chicken lacked that, nor did I see any evidence that it was indeed ""blackened.""  It was very filling, but unfortunately I couldn't finish it because it was making me feel queasy.  Probably too much grease!  The salad was fine and their thin crust pizzas was decent, too.  So I wasn't that impressed with the food, but the beer on the other hand was very good.  I got the sampler and mostly everything they poured was terrific.  I especially liked their Tatonka Stout and their Nutty Brewnette which is a brown ale.  Some other notable stand-outs: Jeremiah Red, and Piranha Pale Ale.  I didn't care for the Hefeweizen.  The ambiance of the place is a little noisy and there's TV's everywhere!  I don't mind a game on in the background, but there were so many TV's that I found myself (and others at our table) being more glued to them than the conversation at the table (guys, don't take a girl here on a date because you're likely to lose points when you constantly gaze over at the game on TV).  Overall, the food is not so great, but the beer is great and probably not a bad place to go for some brews and watch a game."
Brenda W.,"Vacaville, CA",0,22,,4.0,10/3/2009,"Pizzas, beer, and pizookie are all good here.  The wait time is always terrible, and the service is slow because it's always packed.  The wait time keeps us from coming here more."
Lester A.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",114,345,4,3.0,12/11/2007,"i liked this place more before when i ate at the one in Riverside once a year with friends.  i always thought the food was good especially the pizza.  i like the setup and service always seemed pretty good.  Now that it's in vacaville it's nice to have a little more variety instead of deciding to go to chili's or applebees.  I've been able to try more food and can't say I've been disappointed.  i really like the fish tacos and a few of their sandwiches.  pizookie is always a favorite and it's a cool place to go for beers, if u can find room at the bar."
Alvin V.,"Sacramento, CA",0,10,,2.0,2/24/2008,"It was my first time here, i ordered a strawberry lemonade and an old fashion pot roast entree. The strawberry lemonade was delicious but each glass didn't last long, 3/4 of the glass was ice and the rest is strawberry lemonade. I had 3 refills. My entree is 12.95 and it was just mash potatoes and strips of meat which i think is suppose to be pot roast but it just looked like meat covered in sauce =/. 12.95 dish didn't even fill me up.. My strawberry lemonade made me more full than the entree..2 stars for the lemonade."
Meg M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,1,,4.0,3/2/2009,"Well I must say that it is pretty surprising to see so many reviews that the service is less than satisfying I will have to pass that memo on to my managers, I am a server here and have been for about two years. I read a review just recently that said they were told they couldn't get a seperate check, well as a server that is not really our decision, it is a rule made by the manager that we are not supposed to seperate checks for parties of ten or more, but it is ultimately at the servers discretion. I will say that this is not the best place to go with a large party because the Posi System BJ's works with is not the most server friendly. As far as the food goes, as I said earlier that I have worked there for two years, I have yet to get sick of the food. Also seeing as how I have the behind the scene scoop I will say that the kitchen and cooks are very clean and the food is VERY much safe to eat"
Adam M.,"Oakland, CA",2,14,,2.0,12/4/2008,"Meh... This place is alright. I've gotten mostly bad service and the food isn't incredible. The pizookie is a saving grace for this place, and the beer assortment is alright. Could be better though, def. not my first place for cookie cutter restaurants though."
J K.,"Emeryville, CA",0,21,,4.0,9/15/2008,"We had lunch at this place over the weekend and I actually thought this place would be like all the other chain restaurant out there.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.  Great ambiance, good vibe and good food.  We ordered 3 dishes and shared the thin crust basil pizza, sliders with fries and the santa fe salad with the shrimp.  We enjoyed all three dishes.  Draw back ..... it takes a while for them to get the food out but since the food was good, I can over look the delay."
Hawthorne W.,"Fairfield, CA",0,1,,2.0,7/14/2012,"i came here with a group of 10.  the restaurant was pretty empty, we decided to come at an off hour for this reason.  even so, we STILL had to wait for about 10 minutes.  we get seated and were immediately greeted by our server, who was awesome.  he got our drinks and then informed us that he had to cover for someone else and that we would get a new waitress.  right off the bat, there were issues.  she put our drinks down and didn't bother getting our appetizers for another 15 minutes.  after we ordered, it was complete chaos.  i initially had a soft drink and decided i wanted water because it was flat.  not only did i have to ask 3 times for a water, but 2 people joined us after everyone else had ordered and it took awhile before she acknowledged we had 2 new people in the party.  finally the food came.  every plate came out at a different time.  THEN THE CHECKS!!  oh my god.  she asked if we wanted separate checks.  we said yes.  she comes out 10 minutes later with one ticket and a pen and tells us to separate it ourselves using numbers.  (ex:  this person puts a 1 by their drink, appetizer, entree, this person puts a 2 by their drink, app, entree, etc.)  i thought that was bad enough, but i just got a text from a friend who ordered a sandwich to-go for her husband, and she informed me that her husband's chicken club sandwich had no chicken on it.  i'm done with this place.  the only reason it got 2 stars is because the initial server was wonderful, and my food wasn't horrible."
