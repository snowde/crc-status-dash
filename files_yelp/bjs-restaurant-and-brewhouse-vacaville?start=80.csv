Kirsten V.,"Vacaville, CA",28,44,24,4.0,4/10/2017,Extensive menu selections. Nice array of beers. Food is decent with some healthier choices. Our server was amazing and the best we've ever had there. She was very attentive and the food came quickly. Likely helped that it was a Monday.
John C.,"Tehachapi, CA",1,13,6,2.0,10/12/2017,"So it takes a lot for me to complain about service but this was my worst restaurant experience so far. First it took over 10 minutes four our drinks to come out, which was just water. Then we ordered our food and that took an upwards of 30 minutes. My wife ordered unlimited soup and salad and when the server brought my food he looks at my wife and asked "" oh you didn't get your salad preppy yet?"" He brings her food and she asked for no onions on the salad but twice he brought a salad with onions to her. Next after eating her first bowl she found a hair in the second Bowl. Every time we started to ask for something our server would take off and get the first thing we asked for without sticking around to hear our other requests. He would of saved at least 4 back and fourth trips if he just stuck around to listen. After finishing our meal I only had one refill on my tea, not one for my water and my wife didn't get a refill on her water either. The waiter later asked if he could get refills after we asked for the manager and complained about the service and hair found in our food. The manager couldn't care less about listening to what we had to say and seemed really unapologetic. The first thing out of his mouth was what  can I fix instead of asking what the problem is in the first place. The only reason this isn't a one star is because the food that they got right was pretty good."
Jamie C.,"West Sacramento, CA",0,8,,1.0,7/23/2017,Mediterranean pizza taste like a salt lick. Yuck! I have never tasted so much salt on a pizza in my life. Really really bad!    Woke up at 5 am to non stop diarrhea. It has been horrible. My stomach is hurting so much.
Tobin O.,"Vacaville, CA",0,48,16,2.0,4/2/2016,"I gave this two stars because the ordering process through the app was fairly easy and our food was on time. I appreciated how easy the entire process was to do a take out order.  Unfortunately the rest of the experience wasn't so great. Check out the picture I uploaded of our fried chicken. It was completely dried out and hard, and the corn was cold and tasteless. I am not a picky eater and typically like everything but this chicken was so dry that I had to take swigs of water after every bite.  Also our curbside takeout ended up with us going inside because we were put on hold for about 5 minutes when we called the number on the side. Not a big deal but still Not preferred. Really wish the food was better...$30 down the drain."
Austin B.,"Lafayette, CA",42,8,5,5.0,6/20/2017,This place has good desserts wonderful main courses and an assortment of wonderful drinks to choose from. The menu is amazing.
Shaunda H.,"Fairfield, CA",235,18,33,3.0,3/23/2017,This place really sucked tonight! Our food was cold and the wait was extremely long for food.  No apology for the wait. Have check and no pazooki yet either.
Eric S.,"Davis, CA",1553,275,8619,4.0,3/2/2015,"We come to BJ's for an early dinner after running some errands in Vacaville. It was not busy what so ever, so it it was pretty quiet.  Our server Lindsey G was great. She was very helpful with my dinner. I am not a big veggie fan, but I am starting to eat more of them, I asked her if they could just give me steamed carrots, She said when they serve the steamed veggies it was usually just the pre packed veggie, But she said she would do whatever she could to just get me carrots. When my steak came out, I had all steamed carrots. Which made me totally happy.  I cant wait until I go back for dinner again. I'm definitely going to ask for her again"
Morayo A.,"Sacramento, CA",0,7,4,3.0,6/11/2017,"The food was good and the service was as well. There was no wait when the three of us arrived and we were seated promptly. The only problem, which was BEYOND ANNOYING, was the fact that there was ONE server for our area and we were seated next to a party of 8 and another party of 10 arrived as we were finishing up and were seated right behind us. We had to wait over 10 minutes to get our bill, after we had finished eating and then another 15 minutes to get out bill picked up. Super super SUPER ANNOYING and a huge waste of time. BJ's, PLEASE STAFF YOUR RESTAURANT APPROPRIATELY!!!!! 20 minutes, which is an underestimate, of dead time is ridiculous.!!!!!!!!!! Watching my server take orders for a party of 10,  while I write this and continue to wait for my card to be ran is beyond frustrating!"
Manuel G.,"Suisun City, CA",1,5,,1.0,3/24/2017,If I could rate it a zero I would but at least the water I order came cold. But after an hour of waiting for an order I placed.  I had to give up and leave.
Jason C.,"Santa Rosa, CA",26,26,,3.0,12/7/2016,"I've been back to BJ's a couple of times since my initial visit where things went terribly wrong and I can say that I've had much better experiences since then.  It seems that this is a great place, in particular, to grab a drink and a bite but not have to fight the crowds of downtown - and if you want, you can also catch the game on one of their many screens. Not my first choice by any means, but certainly an upgrade to an Applebees, or the like."
Jerron B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",21,31,1,4.0,2/14/2017,"My wife and I have been here more times than I can count. It's always our, ""where do you want to go?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" type of place. I really like the Hopstorm IPA. Everything I've had off the menu has been good. The place is a little pricey, and is busy every hour they are open. I've never been when it wasn't packed. The service is always pretty good considering how busy they are. I would definitely recommend it."
Lisa H.,"Redwood City, CA",118,77,1,4.0,6/18/2017,"I'm a fan! Delicious vegetarian appetizers - avocado egg rolls and my favorite, the roasted brussel sprouts with sriracha aioli. The pizookie desserts are delicious. They have a very extensive menu that I have yet to delve into, but there is clearly something for everyone."
Navie K.,"Yuba City, CA",2,17,2,1.0,9/25/2017,"Came here as a group of 6, after visiting Six Flags, wait time was 40mins, after waiting for an hour and 10mins we finally get a table. We knew what we wanted so we ordered ASAP, took our food about 30mins, told me mine would take just another moment, but it came about 15 mins later when the rest of the group was done. We got no refills on water or our drinks, until we asked for like the 3rd time. We ordered the Buffalo pizza, and Vegetarian/BBQ , the pizza was good. I got the deep dish ziti, phenomenal as usual! We ordered for a Oreo Pizookie, which was taking days, told the lady, forget it, can we get the bill and go. Tells us she would need to get the manager, and is gone for like another 15mins, finally we asked someone else to get us the manager, then she comes running back to tell the manager what's going on. The manager didn't even come and talk to us, or ask us what was going on, then we ask her to split the bill, ends up giving us the wrong change, then we call the manager again. Part 2 of not asking us of what went wrong, or even bothered coming to us. The lady gives our correct change. Honestly the WORST service I've gotten. That one star is for the food! I really believe if you call the manager to your table they should come talk to you and see what's going on, especially the second time around."
Greg L.,"Fairfield, CA",39,5,8,2.0,7/4/2017,"My adult daughter's really like this place and always choose to go here for graduations and birthdays etc. The last few times we've gone this year there is always at least one food problem. The problems are varied like cold food, missing ingredient or chicken when beef was ordered. It happens so frequently we always joke about it at the table when we're looking at our menus. I really like the deep dish pizzas and the pizookies."
Angelique M.,"Vacaville, CA",0,9,6,4.0,5/28/2017,"This place is pretty good, the flatbreads are always so good! And the pazokies (if that's how you spell it).       The waitress Kortney is so sweet!! She's done her job right, always on point :) will be back soon."
Michelle R.,"Fairfield, CA",0,14,,1.0,2/2/2017,"I am not one to complain or have high expectations at chain restaurants and I have resisted writing a review as I prefer to give places the benefit of the doubt, but the last time we went will BE the last time. We have been going here for years but finally reached our breaking point with the service. It has without fail, been terrible service with every waiter/waitress we have had over the last year or so. Things that happen every time:  -Dirty silverware -Food always comes either all at once (appetizers and entrees) or out of order (main dish then salad/appetizers) -Waiters/Waitresses always rush you to order and leave -They never take away any dirty dishes to help clear the table Now for some details on our last visit: As per usual, our waiter rushed us but we expected that. He had very long hair that was in his face the whole time and not pinned back like women have to have. We ordered an appetizer and each a main dish. The waiter came out and told us that the main dish will be coming out before the appetizer.  He then brings out our food. I had ordered no aioli (allergy reason only) and avocado on the side (to share with the person I was there with). I touched my sandwich and then realized there was no avocado on the side. I asked him for the avocado on the side, so he TAKES MY SANDWICH away from me and says he grabbed the wrong one AFTER I TOUCHED IT (so sorry for whoever he gave it to! yuck!). About 5-7 minutes later he tells me they made my new one with aioli - normally I wouldn't care but like I said, it's a severe allergy issue for me. So I waited another 10 minutes (about 15-20 minutes total) and my sandwich finally came.  Meanwhile, the person I was with had already finished his food. He had asked for ketchup in the midst of everything, but the water brought him a completely empty one (amazed he didn't notice how light the bottle was). Our appetizer dishes were never taken from the table and our water was never topped off.  The waiter DID offer us a complimentary pizookie - which was nice - but it took another 20 minutes to come out and was so incredibly burnt that we couldn't eat it. It was black on the bottom and completely rock hard on the top.  After receiving little to no attention from our waiter, I finally asked someone else for our check so we could leave - we were there (just the two of us) for 2 hours. It was unreal.  In addition, the fire alarm went off while we were there and that went on for quite some time. No explanation or anything was given to the people dining there...it was very strange.  I hope this place gets better servers soon because the menu is great - just not worth the hassle anymore."
Leanne J.,"Hayward, CA",0,6,,1.0,6/13/2017,"We really like the B J's in Newark so when we were in Vacaville we felt it would be great to go there after our grandson's graduation.  I ordered the fish & chips which I have had several times. Well it was the wrong choice this time. They came way over cooked!  I sent them back. It was a good 20 min or so and I had to ask our waiter about my dinner,, ""they said it should be right out"".  Guess what it wasn't! By this time the manager came over and said they ran out of fish and the rest was frozen. By this time the rest of the family had all finished their meals.  I told the manager to just take it off the bill. Of course he gave the superficial apologies.  Nothing else was offered or said.  The icing on the cake...the waiter tried to SELL us desert! I am very disappointed in this fiasco of a meal!"
T W S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/30/2017,"On Nov. 6, 2017, my daughter and I went to BJ's for dinner.  The restaurant was not that busy and we were seated immediately. The server took our drink order right away but was a bit slow bringing them to the table. When she left the beverages, she said she'd be right back to take our dinner order.  About ten minutes later, she returned.  We placed our dinner order and proceeded to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  45 minutes later . . . still no food.  We watched other tables get their food, other patrons who arrived after us dine and leave.  And still we had no dinner.  And our server never came back to check in or even near enough for us to inquire about our food.  So we got up to leave and she suddenly appeared, telling us that the kitchen had made a mistake & our food would be out shortly.  We politely declined and started to leave.  The manager stopped us on our way out, told us that the lack of service was unacceptable and took our contact information to ""make it right"".  Well, it is now Nov. 30, 2017, and we've never heard a word from the manager or anyone else from BJ's.  This is completely unacceptable, and we will never again go to BJ's in Vacaville.  Especially since this wasn't the first time their service was less-than-adequate.  This was definitely the WORST!!!!!"
Clydie T.,"Vallejo, CA",5,4,9,4.0,2/19/2017,"Love the food and service!!! My family and I have been coming here for years , and each time is very nice... Recommend if you're looking for a great inexpensive place with good food.."
Ammara I.,"Vacaville, CA",0,36,,4.0,9/14/2017,This place had improved from the last time we came in. They now have more staff and are always busy. Their food and desserts are always good!
