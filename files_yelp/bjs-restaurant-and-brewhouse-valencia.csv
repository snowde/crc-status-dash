Rhea R.,"Pacoima, Los Angeles, CA",0,18,3,3.0,1/1/2018,"Not the best, just okay. I came on a Monday afternoon, maybe around 2:30PM. My boyfriend and I were greeted immediately and got sat down. We were sitting at our table for about 5 minutes before our server came to us. Placing the order was easy, and Daniel was very nice. We ordered the mozzarella sticks for our appetizers. For our entrees, I ordered the spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered a burger. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. However, Daniel forgot to give us our utensils at the beginning of our visit. So I got the spaghetti which was served with a spoon and had no fork. I had to wait about 5 minutes to get someone's attention so I can ask for a fork.  Food was good, service was good. 3/5 stars."
Robert T.,"Santa Barbara, CA",29,36,20,2.0,12/31/2017,"Wife and I came for lunch today. Restaurant was no more than half full. After being seated for 10 minutes, a waitress finally came to take our order. We ordered 2 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 salads. 5 minutes later, another staff member came to say the prior one was now on break, and he's getting our drinks. 15 minutes from sit down to beverages is unacceptable. My wife and I laughed that our appetizers likely wouldn't come. Worse, they came with our salads. What's the point of an appetizer if it comes with your entree? Very frustrating! Salads were decent, but the service was poor. Even when we were exiting we walked right by our server, and he didn't even acknowledge our existence... which speaks to the quality of service. It'll be a while before we come back."
Richard R.,"Corona, CA",88,87,12,1.0,11/27/2017,"1) They wouldn't take a reservation for 8 people but when we got there, there was a table for like 25 people (no joke) that hadn't even shown up until we were almost done. 2) We lucked out and got two booths that were back to back in the bar. The waiter, for some reason, kept acting like we weren't together and took our drink and food orders separately - which yep, meant one table was halfway done before the other table got their food. 3) You may be thinking that maybe he didn't know we were together? Nope, both tables made sure to tell him that it was my cousins birthday and when the second table told him he said, ""yeah I heard"" and then never brought the free pizookie out.  4) My $17 seared tuna salad, which came out last after everyone else's food, was obviously pre-seared and put in the fridge...because it was ice cold all the way through. So, I don't know what took so long getting it out, tbh.  Overall just a really disappointing experience but whatever, we went to Six Flags after, had a blast, and I washed down my crappy salad with a damn good funnel cake."
JoAnna S.,"Simi Valley, CA",42,91,105,5.0,11/10/2017,B.J.s is still the Best restaurant ever. It seems everyone I go to the bathrooms are clean and the food is delicious!! Our waitress Ashley was very personable and charming. She had several regular customers coming in and sitting down and talking to her. She was very professional and always had a smile on her face.  The food was very good and had a very nice presentation.  The atmosphere was wonderful with people of all ages and life styles. It is a sports upper class restaurant. It was not too loud but just right in the restaurant! Love love love B.J.s!! The best part is they honor our Veterans. They gave every veteran any meal that was $12.95 or less a free meal on Friday and on Veterans Day which is Saturday. They are all American!
Shawna R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",77,227,435,4.0,11/1/2017,"My default restaurant, when you don't know where to go or can't decided where to eat.. go here, they can satisfy your craving and they have pizookie. My sister and I come here often, I take my friends and my family and everyone seems to walk away happy and full.  Food: I love there lunch menu, it's all the food in half sizes. If you come here for dinner, be hungry or be ready to take home a box of food. Salads, pizza, pasta, tacos.. there all good here. Even the dessert, I always end up with a pizookie with ice cream.  Great place, will be back."
Derek D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",139,1,,5.0,11/24/2017,"I'm about to get one of my front teeth pulled, but that's beside the point... In the late 1990's, during the development of this particular establishment, a precious metal more valuable than gold and more powerful than kryptonite was unearthed. Unaware of the inherent power of this precious element, the modest construction workers discarded the stone into a nearby California brush fire, ultimately kilning the rock into a glowing molten mass. Five years later, the Pepsi Cola company filmed a commercial starring William H. Macy on location at Six Flags Magic Mountain... It is said that Mr. William Macy rediscovered these precious stones himself during an interval of spiritual enlightenment and molded the rock into the plates and bowls they use specifically at this BJ's restaurant to this day. Legit?? I think so... But I'll leave that decision up to you. The servers and bartenders at this BJ's continue to carry on the legacy of William H. Macy, and will gladly engage themselves in casual conversation of his personal history if you ask them. I frequent this restaurant often to be reminded of this. Tip: Before you leave, look towards the palm tree on your left. Jesus will see you and give you a wink of approval. Once you tip your hat towards the North star, you will see fireworks on the horizon. That's when you know the coast is clear. Your Pizookie will be waiting for you in the dirty fish tank when you get home.  Hurry up... They're onto us."
Eileen D.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,249,750,4.0,3/31/2017,"Benn coming to this spot ever since we moved to Valencia. It's something very close to our hearts since we used to frequent the Burbank location when we used to live in SFV.  But, there are differences at this particular location that we really like. The crowd is a much mature, less rowdy and more classy people than the one in Burbank. We also never had a problem finding a seat by the bar, and eventhough they can get really busy in the weekends, we've never had to wait long for a table. Parking is never a big hassle and the waitstaff are much more pleasant and classier.  At the many times I've been here, I've only had one not so pleasant experience with the service, so that is a good thing I suppose. They have daily specials, like $10 burgers on Wednesdays, $18.99 for a whole slab of ribs plus 2 sides and mini pizookie, etc. Most of the items in the menu are delicious, just the Sante Fe salad was disappointing. They have many options for eats and drinks that it's hard to decide at times but my usuals are the avocado rolls, any of the pizzas and the spritzers. This is a great spot for happy hour and for the whole family, too."
James H.,"Las Vegas, NV",22,151,268,4.0,6/5/2017,"1st time staying in Santa Clarita - Valencia. This place is adjacent to the Westfield mall so there is plenty of dining & shopping options, especially if you stay at the Hyatt Regency across the street! Tonights fare was the Ahi salad. Not bad and neither was the service. About 10-15 minutes for the food to land in front of me. 2nd salad of the day for me! Eating healthy!! No surprises with the food or service. Reasonably priced to boot. Wandered in after 8 pm and there were not that many people and no wait to get seated. Super busy intersection to cross to get here."
Destinee G.,"Simi Valley, CA",56,1,2,1.0,11/4/2017,The service here is terrible and my water has floaties in it ?!?! It's like dirt and shit maybe pepper
Joe S.,"Newhall, Newhall, CA",0,5,,4.0,1/8/2018,"I always enjoy coming here. Whether it's by myself sitting at the bar for lunch, or with my family for a reasonable priced dinner. Staff and bartenders are always friendly. Beer and food are reasonably priced and tasty. TVs are everywhere to enjoy the game. My favorites are the Jeremiah red and of course the macadamia nut pizzokie."
Traci S.,"Springville, CA",13,46,5,4.0,12/4/2017,I love the fresh clean food here! The Mediterranean Chicken Tacos are so good!  My husband said his prime rib dip was good but not the best he's had   We will return!
April N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",59,24,3,1.0,12/31/2017,"So we went here about 12/26 around 11:45 or noon. It was NOT busy from the looks of the place. So we walk in and the guy ant the front desk counter greeted us, that's about the only that happened that should have happened. Again it was NOT busy, there was NO waiting , NO one in front of us after about five minutes of him just looking at us we'er seated. Why he just didn't sit us when we walked in is anyone's guess.  After being seated we wait another 5min -10min before a server comes over to our table. She ask us had anyone helped us. we told her no then she says ""oh it's cause HER area is pretty full"". A) who is HER B)that's not my problem C) by you telling us this was it suppose excuse the fact that we've been sitting here for 10min ? At this point I'm annoyed.  So she takes our entire order since we been sitting there so long. Appetizers: Memphis spice wings & potatoes skins main dish: pizza. Not a big order not a hard order right ? So after about 20min i start to get a little irritated as all we revived thus far was our drinks no appetizers!!! Mind you again it's dead in here no busy at all. The server comes by asking us is ""we were okay"". I tell her no at this point we been here about 30min with no appetizers. Her response ""yaaaaa you guys have been here a while"". Then she just stands there and I have to literally ask her to go check on our starters. She agrees to do so and I processed to watch her take another tables order then goto the bar. I'm ready to walk out. She finally makes her was to the kitchen. A minute later here comes not just the appetizers plus the pizza. I'm beyond annoyed we ordered starters for a reason so they could cone out first. If you ever been to BJ they have the smallest table for parties of two so the tables full at this point. The whole experience makes me never wanna go back & I won't. The one in Burbank has extremely better service."
Mike O.,"Santa Clarita, CA",611,616,1097,3.0,1/20/2017,"Been to BJ's tons of times, thought I would write a brief review.  The service here like all is kind of hit and miss...they seem to try but sometimes the wait staff just doesn't feel it. Food is American and okay, some stuff that is okay some stuff is just ordinary."
Elia B.,"Atascadero, CA",15,117,233,4.0,5/4/2017,"Walked in and placed my order to go.  Took 15 minutes.  They did mess up my pizza... instead of doing light sauce and no tomato chunks, they left it all off. No sauce no tomato chunks, so it was really dry and salty.  The pot stickers and avocado rolls were amazing!!!"
John Y.,"Valencia, CA",0,11,,1.0,12/10/2017,"1. Slow service. I went on Saturday night and I don't know if they were understaffed or what, but it took a very long time for our server to take our order and for our food to come. Once our food came, we didn't have any silverware or napkins and nobody came to check up on us. I had to get up and flag someone down to bring us setups while our food was sitting and getting cold. 2. Both the chicken and the bread for my sandwich were incredibly dry. I had to take a drink with each bite just to be able to swallow it. Unfortunately it took forever to get my drink refilled.  3. My wife had the spaghetti last night and she got sick late last night and has been incredibly sick all day today--like unable-to-get-out-of-bed-except-to-dry-heave-every-30 minutes-sick. I know that this is a serious statement to make and it's not something I would make up and just throw out there if it weren't true. While I was at work today, I was discussing my experience with some of my co-workers. The consensus was ""Well, duh--everyone knows not to go there. That place is awful."" I guess I hadn't gotten the memo, but now the message has been received loud and clear."
Jeff M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",103,19,1,1.0,11/21/2017,"I was actually going to write a great review and then I ran into Becky the bartender. I literally left a full drink at the bar because she was so rude. Never again, I promise."
Alex C.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",14,12,,1.0,11/16/2017,"You know what to expect with a chain restaurant like this but I'd caution you if you're coming in with a larger group for lunch.Our order was mixed up and screwed up the group that came in after us was given their food before us,checks before us."
Edgar E.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",47,4,,4.0,12/7/2017,"Bj's is one of the top restaurants i go to when i have the time to. my girlfriend and myself love the calamari from here and everything is priced just right! The appetizers, main dishes, and desserts are all great!"
Christine J.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",28,12,17,1.0,7/7/2017,"My husband doesn't EVER put pepper on his fries, but apparently he'll have to now at BJ's! They fry their french fries in the same oil that they fry their churros in. I confirmed it with the manager. The fries taste like churros...they're sweet and taste like cinnamon! We didn't order a churro, so why would we want that flavor?! Disgusting. Every time we come here SOMETHING is wrong. It makes me so mad that I love their salad so much, but have to endure something going wrong every single time we visit BJ's!!!!!!"
Heather H.,"Porter Ranch, Porter Ranch, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/19/2017,"BJS use to be good. Went here and there was barely anyone customer's there with a bunch of open tables. We were then asked by the host to wait 10 minutes, no problem we can wait. Then they forgot about us and proceeded to seat people that came in after us first. Then we ordered an appetizer right when we sat. Appetizer took a long time and when it did come out, it wasn't even warm. We told our server and the manager came by to take our appetizer off.  I joked with my husband, watch they aren't even going to bring us a new appetizer. Well the joke became a reality, no new appetizer! We still wanted the appetizer; we're still hungry! As a server, you should ask if you want a remake!"
Rayna W.,"Baldwin, NY",0,12,2,5.0,11/16/2017,BJ's is a cult favorite. Love the food and the service. People are always friendly and attentive. If anything is ever wrong the manager comes over and fixes the issue no problem. I've never had an issue to bad that couldn't be fixed. I appreciate the time the managers and the staff work to make the customers happy. I'll for sure be back for my favorite chocolate chip dessert !
Nancy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,11,10,4.0,11/18/2017,"Very nice place with great menu choice, but can be overcrowded on weekends and wait time can be more than 40 minutes. Wonderful selection of breeds and I loved their deep dish pizza."
Kyra P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,4,2.0,11/17/2017,"I'm disappointed in this restaurant. I came here tonight for dinner and to be honest it's not what it used to be. I got a drink the first one was good, the second one tasted horrible... it's okay though, it happens. Then when the bill finally comes my boyfriend asked for four $5s in exchange for a $20.  The bill comes back and the waitress had taken all the money and not given us anything back. My friend confronted her and she was gonna give it to another table- idk if they are just TOO busy and not enough people or what. Also I had come here maybe a month ago to meet with my brother and his girlfriend and ordered simple lettuce wraps- I had one bite and asked them to take them back because the chicken was bad. It's too bad I really liked this place. I'm giving them 2 starts instead of 1 because I love the strawberry splash. It's the only reason why I go here."
Yogie V.,"Canyon Country, CA",95,5,,5.0,11/14/2017,"We ate lunch here today and was very pleased with all the servers specially Angie.  She always checked on us, what we needed and if everything was ok. We went home and 5 hours later, my husband noticed that his Citi card that he used here was missing. I called BJs to check if we left the card there. It was there safely kept by manager Mark . I commend these trustworthy and honest staff! Thank you so very much! Keep up the  awesome job!"
Chris I.,"Santa Clarita, CA",26,69,15,5.0,10/26/2017,"Mmmm love the food at bjs and the service is excellent! The staff is very friendly and they always take great care of me. I love to sit at the bar, Jill is always very nice and makes the best suggestions on the menu! One of my favorite places to eat!"
Alijah M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,1.0,10/31/2017,"Worst experience ever!!! Just left a horrible dinner with my husband. First we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the avocado was old and black. I ordered the house sirloin steak and requested it be cooked medium well. When I got my plate my steak was dry and well over cooked. The inside was completely black and burnt. After requesting a new steak I nearly sat there for 30 mins waiting being told ""it's coming"". My husband and I were finally fed up and decided to leave without the steak. On top of it the waiter was slow and not accommodating at all after we had mentioned the horrible service we were having. This is by far the worst experience I've had at a restaurant and will not be returning."
Dael P.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/7/2017,"I normally like BJs but today we got the worst server EVER. She started complaining about being seated too many tables to the host as she is taking our drink order, as I'm ordering my drink she made a point of telling me how much she disliked my choice because ""grapefruit is gross""... and asked if I had actually read the menu... food took for ever to come out and she never checked on our table and I had to ask multiple times for a refill. Spoke to a ""supervisor"" who said we are just busy and I've been here since 3pm. The worst was when the server came back to the table and asked why we complained because she has an awesome personality"
Alex K.,"West Hollywood, CA",201,256,257,4.0,11/20/2016,"Mission: Needed to find a lunch place for the guys after a long day shooting trip.  After shooting for several hours, me and the guys decided it was time for burgers and beers. Since there was no service at the range we drove to the main Blvd pulled over and all talked about where to eat ( we had multiple cars) Someone mentioned BJ's and I never had it So let's go. Every one agreed and we drove out. I got lucky and found parking right away. But 2 other cars, we driving in circles looking for parking. Eventually they parked and we walked in, got a table outside and looked at their menus.  Why is it like a book, why are there pages and pages of food.  Anyways, I noticed they had clam chowder and ordered that in a bowl. Also ordered the sliders. Others in my group really liked their food, the had buffalo burger, bacon Guak burger, chicken club and wings. Everyone said it was good. I thought it was ok, there are canned soups that you can microwave that taste better there are frozen sliders that you can mw that taste better. For $30 w/o alcohol I expected more.  The food was ok, the beers were great, we had red something and lots of them, hence the forgetting of the name. I'm leaving 4 stars because the atmosphere is great, the beers are delicious, the college games on TV were winning and the waiter and staff were friendly and very accommodating. If I would be dining alone, I would prolly rate a 2 Mission Successful"
Mandy S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",32,9,1,5.0,10/24/2017,"I recently moved to the area and this location is very close to my home and work, so I've come here multiple times for both dinner and lunch. I have not been disappointed! I usually order to go, but the one time I dined in was pleasant and we had good service. The to go experience is great - the app is amazing and makes things very easy, my order has been correct every time, and it's so easy to pick up the orders right when you walk in the door instead of having to go to the bar. Very pleased so far."
Rebecca M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,5.0,12/21/2017,This is my favorite restaurant ever.  When I die I want my ashes put there.  Im like Norm at Cheers.  Everyone knows me and brings me my favorite beer before I ask.  My husband and I eat here atleast once a week.  Lots to choose from on the menu and it is all good.  Highly recommend their beer dinners where you get to try different beers paired with food.
Henry J.,"Valencia, CA",72,36,6,5.0,6/15/2017,"This review is for our server tonight, Marcus L. We've been coming here off and on for at least 10 years, and more often over the last few months after moving in across the street. Marcus has by far been the best and most attentive server we've ever had at this store. The food was pretty darned good for a chain, as well. Caveat:  Now that the bill has come, 18.25 for a Sidecar (that came on the rocks in a brandy glass)... seriously? Even Carthay Circle at Disneyland inly charges $14"
Eddie G.,"Canyon Country, CA",4,1,,1.0,10/13/2017,"Horrible service. Went for my bday lunch, server took about 30 minutes to take our lunch order. Bottom line we had to take our order to go."
Ryan K.,"Bakersfield, CA",91,2,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Damn.. what to say? All I wanted was pizookie for my wife and I to share. So we ordered online but accidentally hit the wrong pick up time.(no big deal right, I'll just call and ask them to change the pick up time) butttt nope. Called and told them, waited a solid 5 minutes just to get a hold of the take out person. Asked to change to pick up time for later and they replied, ""Sorry they're just going to make it and we can keep it in the heat box till you get here."" And I thought, wow that sounds weird; going to keep it in the hot box for an hour... and we'll sure enough. Picked it up, everything was cool there. Brought it home and what do you know, damn thing was burnt. No one likes burned pizookie. If anyone reads this, go to Oreganos! Their pizookie is amazing!!"
Chris M.,"Sylmar, CA",179,375,1303,4.0,10/8/2016,"Always a good experience when eating at any B.J's restaurant, and even though things didn't go completely my way I was still a happy camper. We ordered our appetizers and entrees together and then our waitress took our drink order, o.k. We got the drinks and our meals but my appetizer never came, apparently she forgot to put the order in, again it was o.k. Food was good as always and the waitress even had her manager comp a free dessert for her mistake, classy move B.J's. Again I enjoy my times here, food is good, service is good and prices are very fair even if I don't get my eggrolls,Aloha"
Fidel C.,"Newhall, CA",0,32,132,4.0,6/11/2017,Can't really go wrong with pizza and brews. Every time I've come in the service is good the food is better than I expected. That's worth 4 stars. They got great outdoor seating for the summer. And pizzookies one of the best dresser desserts ever
Tamara S.,"Henderson, NV",38,51,9,5.0,6/10/2017,"Came here with my husband since we are new in town and we had excellent service !! Our waiter was Bryan-Brian ( not sure on spelling ) but he was extremely helpful and accommodating. My husband loves their IPAs he got the stone one this time. I just stuck to Stella because duh I'm a girly girl. Also got their siracha dry rub wings and Barcelona pita tacos. Definitely amazing. We will be back! And hopefully you'll get as lucky as us and get Bryan for your waiter!!!  It's not always about the food making the experience great , it's the customer service !!!!  P.s the avocado egg rolls are perfect"
Bob H.,"Culver City, CA",0,12,,1.0,10/17/2017,worse place to eat if your not in a hurry. the manager was glaring at us the last 15 minutes of our meal and waiter was pushing us to leave after 45 mins total eating time. never mind we where ignored 90 percent of out meal and i had to literally flag the waiter down any time i wanted another drink.  i find it also very rude that the hostess and manager sat whispering to each other in view of our table. stay away these guys cant handle being busy.
V S.,"Sparks, NV",0,8,,5.0,12/11/2017,Great time and food was delicious!  Great service from our server Andrew ... we were a large group of 12 on a busy Friday night but he took care of us very well!  He was even able to provide great customer service by separating out our orders!  Great food and service!
Keli R.,"Valencia, CA",610,119,322,3.0,8/16/2016,Danielle is fantastic she answered the phone and was extremely polite and helped answer all my questions. Better review tomorrow after dinner. We go here all the time for dinner and drinks and no issues. They pay attention to our allergies and respect our special requests. We celebrates birthdays here and always have fun. Revised the next night. Came in and had 5 people at the hostess stand. All looking in the computer at my call ahead and none of the could figure out where we were going in the restaurant until one hung up the phone and directed them all. Very very weird to have 5 people lost in space. Then we got sat in Amanda's section at the worst table in the place and she was so sweet that she moved us to a booth and gave us another server in the process. Kinda bummed she was super sweet but hopefully the new server is good?!?
Bay L.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/9/2017,"The food is good, but everytime i frequent bjs my order gets messed up. Once my 2 sons finished their meals before i even got mine. Twice our appetizer came agtet our meals even though it was ordered begote our meal. Once i was eating paper in my food because they left the paper on the cheese on my burger. And once my appetizer was burnt.very badly run location"
