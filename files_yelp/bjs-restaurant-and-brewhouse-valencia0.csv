Tiffany W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,36,7,5.0,5/25/2016,"I go here with my mistress from time to time. It is great. It sets to the mood for what will happen later. Good food = Happy life. Don't cheap out and go to Larson's Grill, BJ's has the best service and food ever!"
Emily G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",130,568,334,4.0,6/6/2014,"I love BJ's food and drinks! I've never had anything bad at this location, though my Caesar salad yesterday was a tad heavy on the dressing and cheese. I usually get their turkey club sandwich or pasta. Their California Club pizza appetizer is becoming a fast favorite of mine too though, it's big enough for a whole meal! Their avocado rolls, thin fries, and pizookies are also on my list of favorite BJ food items. Their drinks here are always pretty bomb and strong too. If you're not into their specialty brewed beers, try their Berry Cider!  I've never really had a problem with any of the servers here, but I'm friends with a lot of waitresses (not here but elsewhere) so I always try to be understanding and patient.  My dad loves coming to BJ's whenever we meet up in town for lunch or dinner, so I will most definitely be back!"
Bridget K.,"Valencia, CA",0,1,,5.0,6/13/2016,"I am new to santa clarita and have been trying out all the local favorites and hands down bjs is a winner, absolutely love this restaurant great food great service .

Martine L.,"Valencia, CA",7,44,41,4.0,7/18/2015,Awesome place. Nice atmosphere. Food was great. Definitely coming back. It's not too far from our house. Had the cherry chipotle salmon. Was fantastic!! Thanks.
Rescue A.,"Lomita, CA",185,160,4343,2.0,1/26/2014,"Service needs to focus in customers, especially at the door. The hostess station should not be left unattended. Representatives should make sure customers are attended to first and no one (no party) is left waiting. Young representatives seemed more interested in greeting each other in front of customers than demonstrating service. This was my first impression upon entering. I've been to BJs and not felt it hard to find the host/hostess as I did on thus particular visit. Once seated, table service went as one would expect: pleasant and reasonable timing for taking order and  attention. Stopped here for the pizza!"
Francis Y.,"Glendale, CA",121,55,95,3.0,6/26/2015,Service here is a coin toss. Sometimes food comes out quick and sometimes it takes a long time. One particular visit my friends and I ordered dinner. We all had our food except one guy whose main course arrived right when everyone was done with their meal. The waitress didn't even say sorry. It wasn't a busy night and the dish was a burger. The food and beer is decent.
Liz C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",9,25,5,2.0,2/10/2015,"First of all. I usually love BJ's restaurants. However, this trip kind of sealed the deal on leaving a not so positive review. The last few times I've been to this particular location service and food have been lacking. Went on Sunday (2/8) for a family dinner. Here is a list of things that went wrong: *Did not receive any utensils or napkins - even after our appetizer arrived. *A pitcher of beer took about 10min. *Had to finally ask for napkins and utensils after our main course arrived. *Husbands steak was very chewy. He didn't even finish it. Told the waiter and he said they had been having a problem with it all day.... So maybe suggest we order something else??? Says he's going to speak to his manager and took forever. Finally after about 15 min he comes back and says they will offer free dessert. The kid wants dessert so we get the dessert. And that takes about another 15min to arrive. Its a ice cream and a cookie, I know it doesn't take that long, we've had them before. Its not that busy on a Sunday night. *Service was slow and it wasn't that busy. *Our server was a male. A female server came by and picked up our check and disappeared with my card for about 20 minutes! I finally went up to the host and asked if they could help. But of course they couldn't because I had no idea who took the check! When she finally returned and I questioned her she said she had already given it to our server.... Ok, so where is he so that I can sign and get out of here!? She says he working with a large party... ok, fine... since I don't really have a choice in the matter. We spent more than 2 hours here and we shouldn't have spent more than an hour. We didn't order complicated meals, We didn't take forever ordering. We didn't sit and talk endlessly once our food was done... Well we did but only because we were waiting for our dessert and then the check and then for them to come back with the final bill... I think it will be a long while before I visit this location again."
Jun R.,"Valencia, CA",110,160,493,4.0,5/31/2015,"We usually come here for dinner and get the appetizer sampler, pizza, margarita and beer sampler. Now, for lunch, we ordered the BJ deep dish pizza with the avocado roll and chocolate chip pizookie. The deep dish pizza was just above average pizza. But the avocado roll was amazingly good especially with the sweet dipping sauce which gave it a contrasting taste. I reserved the best for last, the chocolate chip pizookie comes with vanilla ice cream and it's a must have when you visit BJ's. It's probably bad for you but it's soooo good!  Just double your workout after.  We sat on the bar table so the service was a little slow."
Antoinette B.,"San Fernando, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/5/2016,"My two friends and I dined here last Saturday night. Not too long of a wait. Unfortunately, that was the last good thing about our experience that night. Our waitress was not very attentive to us. We ordered three items to share. All were bland tasting, and just not up to standard cooking. We had to track her down twice, one to take our order, and the next to get our bill. When we left, we visited the restroom. The plumbing was not working well, at all. We informed the people at the desk and they said they were on it. I was at this location a few years ago, and the food was much better. I don't think we will be visiting this one again."
Cesar C.,"Sylmar, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/7/2016,This BJ's is a good example of why I keep coming back the service provided by the staff and the food lives up to its expectation not to mention the brews thank you BJ'S
Andrea J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/4/2016,"Not the best experience. Ate in and wanted to order an additional takeout soup and salad to take home at the end. Instead, we got the takeout order before our food came. Service was not particularly great. Got home and found barely any salad which looked nothing like the picture on the menu it had a few pieces of spinach, couldn't find blue cheese and there was no dressing on it. This was not enough to be a side salad much less a full order of salad. In the past we have enjoyed other BJ's locations but this was disappointing at best."
Scott R.,"Valencia, CA",12,12,,4.0,6/5/2016,I mostly enjoy the environment here but the food is pretty good too. Lot's of variety - the menu is a novelette. BBQ pizza is my favorite with any of their home brews.
Megan S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",138,2,,5.0,5/4/2016,Melinda was an amazing server! She made sure we got our food on time and offered some great selections we didn't see ourselves. Will continue to come!
Inda C.,"Granada Hills, CA",4,28,12,5.0,7/7/2015,"Hand-crafted sodas with no high fructose corn syrup are delicious! And free refills?! Calamari app could use more seasoning but the breading was light and the meat was very tender. Good selection of  ""enlightened"" food choices (lower calories). Cherry chipotle salmon was delicious. Mediterranean chicken pita tacos were filling and tasted great. Both dishes right around 600 calories. Our server Troy was wonderful!"
Lori C.,"San Francisco, CA",98,133,50,1.0,11/25/2014,My poor interaction with the hostess on a slow Monday afternoon was enough to make me turn around and leave only a few minutes after being seated. Do yourself a favor and listen to the Yelp reviews. Go to Chipotle across the street instead unless you're trying to deal with salty ass high schoolers.
H T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,1,1.0,4/6/2016,"Not satisfied at all with the customer service here. If I could give 0 stars I would. Our server barely even checked on us and when they brought out our food, they were missing one of the orders. At first, I thought that maybe the order was still being made but 10 minutes later, it was obvious that they forgot about it. The server took forever coming back to check up on us and when they finalllllly came by our table, we informed them of the problem and it took another 10-15 minutes to get the food. Really? Shouldn't you know what we ordered and if we've received everything? But it's okay, I guess they didn't because they hardly checked on our table. =) The food wasn't great but at least they didn't charge us for the food that took forever to receive.. Very disappointed. My first and last time going to BJ's."
Allison A.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/24/2016,"I went here for my sister birthday and the waiter was EXTREMELY RUDE!!!! She talked backed to us and had an attitude so when we decided not to give her a tip, she went to her friend which worked there and talked poorly about us when I confronted them they laughed in our face and left IN FRONT OF THE MANGER, the manger wasn't really helpful, they gave us a 15 dollar gift card when we asked for an apology which we never got."
Tanya A.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/24/2016,"Poor customer service. Don't trust their  reservations even if you double check with the hostess in advance. Waiter was extremely rude. Caught worker talking poorly about my table and when confronted with the issue they were quite. The manger was kind, however, they did not handle the situation well. We only receive $15 gift card when we wanted an apology from the waiter. She was tall, white, blonde with a bod cut."
Mai-Lynn T.,"Oxnard, CA",13,11,1,2.0,4/5/2016,"Service is generally sub-par, even worse if you're sat at the bar (unintentional rhyme). When sat at the bar area, I've seen my waiter walk past my table at least 3 times without even a nod of acknowledgement or even menus. So I wouldn't really recommend their bar area if the host offers it.  I mean the food is good, not great, but good. It's about what you expect from a chain restaurant. I've had the food come over feeling room temperature though... After I mentioned it to my waitress, the table behind me said the same thing. So definitely not a one time fluke on me. I've had the manager walk past me without bothering to make eye contact. All in all, it's a chain restaurant with an impersonal experience. Take that as you will. You'll probably still eat here anyways because you've had it in another city."
Nicole M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/21/2015,"BJ's will forever be my all-time favorite place to eat. It pains me to read negative reviews! It is a restaurant though and unfortunately, there are going to be bad days.  Luckily the ONLY bad thing lately for me has been the changes in their menu, but Im going to assume corporate is behind the changes. BRING BACK THE CORN FRITTERS AND MINI BRUSCHETTA! PLEEEEASE.  back to my review: Food is just great, so many options and though I normally order the same grilled chicken pasta, any time I have ventured out and tried something new, I'm always satisfied. The service is great and even when it is terribly busy, the waiters do great at keeping communication with you. The hostesses need to smile a little bit more, but I can't imagine how stressful it is on those busy nights!  love. love. love."
