Jose O.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",5,7,3,1.0,3/24/2017,"Came to BJ with my family. Service was ok, but what ever you do don't ask for a glass of water. The water taste like if they went outside and got it from a puddle."
Jeff B.,"Los Angeles, CA",617,799,7321,3.0,9/11/2014,"(Dined 09/04/14 TH @ 12:30pm): Fellatios must be on a ""special menu"" because I sure as hell didn't see it on my lunch menu! All kidding aside, this BJ's in the Westfield Valencia Town Center has been a go-to spot for many Princess Cruises employees not only because of the 10% employee discount, but it was conveniently close to the offices, the food was generally good, and for those days when a game was on after work we'd hit up the happy hour. On this particular day, a good colleague and friend took me out for lunch on my penultimate day with the company. Having gone here numerous times during my tenure with the company, unfortunately, I chose a not-so-exemplary experience: Oktoberfest Seasonal Beer ($5.95) - Light, clean, crispy and a nice color. However, the marketer in me wished it was served in its promotional Oktoberfest glass for better branding of this limited brew. Not a hard concept, people; do you need me as a consultant!?    Lunch Special: BJ's Classic One Topping Pizza & Salad ($6.75) - Touted as their signature deep dish pizza (I ordered sausage), the presentation reminded me of the Pizza Hut high school lunches I had decades ago - FAIL! And, it seemed flattened and actually tasted like the frozen variety - DOUBLE FAIL!   The side salad was fine and had the right amount of Italian dressing; it served its purpose of the greenery I sorely needed in my diet.    Service - The place wasn't packed like it usually was so we were seated immediately inside with two views for the both of us. We were waited on by a nice gentleman who generally was diligent with us: we got our drinks quickly, water glasses which were regualrly filled, food arrived within 10 minutes, and he checked in on us. Only nit-picky knock was that we had to ask for the check (trust me, if we didn't have to go back to work we could've hung out for hours). Easy peasy. Parking (free) - You're in the mall so plenty of spaces. There were some out-front parking but those usually got snagged quickly. Our office was in walking distance so no issues for us. Just walk it, people! Atmosphere, décor, ambience - Your basic big-box quasi open-air werehouse-style building with high exposed industrial ceilings and plenty of windows and glass walls that allowed natual lighting in easily; in the evening the electic lights were turned on. There was a decent-sized full bar, the inside dining area was spacious and massive with both cushioned booths and standard tables while the front outside dining area was partially covered with outdoor furniture and heating lamps when appropriate. There were some promotional items that hung from the walls...stuff you'd expect in a sports bar. There were bucco TVs while background music also played. Attire - Totally casual, so I would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops if I weren't at work. Overall, BJ's in Valencia has been good to me over the years with their nicely-priced lunch specials, beer and cider selection, ample seating and the occasional attractive female worker. Historically, the service would be slower than I'd like if I ""needed"" to get back to the office. Ultimately, it was still all about the Pizookie and the Berry Burst cider - their hallmark menu items. I found fairly good value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total paid experience for my share was around $14.00 before discount and tip). Although my colleague paid for me (thanks Martin!), they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX! 3.5 STARS"
Markie B.,"Irvine, CA",51,25,13,2.0,12/27/2016,"This got a 2 stars because the food is good, but the service is terrible. We went after 10 at night, not even that busy. We only saw our waiter 4 times: to order drinks, order food, send salad back for a hair in it, and for our check.... and it took 10 minutes just to get the check.  Used to be better quality, not sure where the work ethic went, but I didn't even receive an apology for the hair, no manager stopped by, server brought our check on a plate and walked away. I had even asked for condiments for my food and never received, and couldn't ask again because we didn't even see him until the check was brought and food was done. Poor job BJs."
Celes H.,"South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",221,4,,1.0,3/1/2017,Worst bj's needs new staff and new manager. They are very rude . Corporate needs to rehire ASAP!
Brenda J L.,"San Fernando, CA",3,20,71,5.0,8/21/2016,Love this place. Everytime we come we are greated like at home. The manager FERNANDO is AMAZING!!!  He comes to our table whenever he gets a chance throughout our stay and not only checks on us but makes conversation and ALWAYS includes our kids. That's what makes us HAPPY and makes us come back again and again. THANK YOU FERNANDO and ur great staff for the amazing hospitality!!!!
Ash M.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",7,202,134,1.0,10/10/2015,"2nd time to this location and it was the most horrible experience. Worse customer service ever !! Got a table for 6 waiting was about 35 minutes, I specifically told the front counter girl taking reservations please make sure we get a big table for our party. We get this girl taking us to our table without Greeting us, saying hello, without a smile on her face she looked so evil and mean person. Matter fact she didn't even say her name she said fallow me please. She takes us to this small table which is for 4 people, we look at her all of us and said are you serious? Or your making a mistake their is no way on earth we could fit 6 people on this small circle table with all the foods and drinks we are going to be ordering. She then gave us the worse attitude and walked us to another table which was a straight table but still 2 chairs were half way out of the table, I got frustrated and told her look we need a big fucking table for 6 not kids table of 6. She finally attached another table which was what we needed from beginning to have all chairs fit properly and not breathing on each other!!!  She had the worse customer service ever, I spoke to the manager regards her lack of service. Then saw her talking shit to her fellow co workers about the situation and crying.  Our foods were all incorrect, drinks major delay to bring them out. We are dropping good $300-$400 with shots, drinks, appetizers, our main dishes so we would expect to have good service, but no this place is horrible. They bring our main entrées with 2 of our guest missing their plates still. After 5 minutes we are all eating and they still don't have their food we ask what's going on with their meals why so late apart normally they should all come out same time. Manager said we made a mistake on 2 orders, and one of the orders we dropped it on the way.  After almost being done with our meals they finally  bring the 2 missing dishes. Worse customer service. They shouldn't be in business at all. Never going back to this location"
Marwin M.,"Littlerock, CA",0,7,,2.0,2/14/2017,"So out of the 3 BJ's I go to this one had recently had the worst decline in service by far!  The portions add much smaller than at any other, the small Pizza that I order each time came looking as flat as the ones from Little Caesars and to make it even more unbelievable it wasn't even a small looked more like a mini because it was brought in on a small plate, we ended up ordering a Pizookie to split and the waiter brought us a mini one instead and claimed it was the regular size, as if we couldn't tell that the two spoons he brought almost covered over the whole pan?!"
Esper G.,"Indio, CA",0,94,,1.0,4/13/2017,I would give it no stars but can't do it. Did the online ordering.  Got a table in the bar.   Got a beer served quickly. Waited 20 minutes for anything else to happen. Brought up the online ordering and the wait time.  Staff said they were on it. Left after 30 minutes.   Reached out to BJ Brewery.  No response. Not worth the hassle.  I used to like the place but it is just hit and miss.
Natasha C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",60,7,,1.0,3/4/2017,"Yikes!!! Very disappointed in last night's experience. Came in with a party of 8 for post work happy hour, but there was no room in the bar for us and we were sat in the back section of the restaurant.  Cannot recall our server's name, he was a young Asian gentleman. A few of our guests had to leave the table momentarily, leaving 5 of us and the server who said he would bring water for now. Okay, fine. But continuing to walk by our table without another word after our party had assembled completely, menus closed, ready to order? Come on man!  The server quickly rushed through the order taking process, and that's where it went downhill. One of our guests asked if happy hour also included the dining room, and the server said, ""no, it applies to the bar only"". Understood, just thought we would check. But then he added, ""you're more than welcome to all move to the bar if there's room but I don't know how long you'd have to wait for people to get up. And that's fine if you want to do that, because I'm not really feeling this today.""  You're ""not really feeling this today""?!? The comment left our table of hospitality professionals baffled.  Drinks came intermittently, as did the food. Had to ask for refills, had to ask for split plates and napkins. We are aware that our employer has a discount program with BJ's, and we brought it to the server's attention come check time. We were told, ""you guys should've told me sooner because the checks are already split and it would apply to one of those checks only, and anyway I'll have to get my manager.""  Dumbfounded once again, we decided nothing was worth keeping us here and we needed to pay and leave.  Clearly service is not a strong suit at this restaurant, and that's sad; with the competition now at the Valencia Town Center, Cheesecake Factory and soon Saddle Ranch, you have to realize that consumers have options, and they won't choose you. Shame on BJ's management for their poor hiring choice and level of service."
Bryna M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,63,13,3.0,12/17/2016,"BJ's is pretty good for the most part. I enjoy their seared ahi salad and some of their beer choices. However, I was disappointed to learn today that their ""buy a hero a beer"" program is only for EMT's, firefighters, and police officers. What about veterans and soldiers? Are they not heroes too? I had to take a star off because as a veterans wife I was pretty disappointed that I couldn't buy my hero a beer through the program. Anyway, thank you to all the first responders, active duty, and veterans you are ALL heroes."
Denise Placencio Divorce Atty P.,"Woodland Hills, CA",187,50,4,1.0,12/11/2016,Horrible horrible service once again.  People think that their chain restaurants will survive on name only and they won't.   The restaurant had no wait and the servers are all walking around doing nothing.  Took 10 minutes to get our water and drinks.  The food isn't even out yet.  With the opening of Cheesecake Factory right down the road places like this better step up their game.  It's 1:02 in the afternoon on Sunday and we are not the only ones receiving poor service.
Vincent K.,"Anaheim, CA",63,16,3,5.0,8/28/2016,"Wow the service and drinks were fabulous!  I do not know why it's only 2.5/5 stars, Eric and Mario were awesome last night I took my girlfriend out for her 21st Bday with her mom and fam, they made our stay enjoying and filled with laughs, drinks were on point and they got my girlfriend a little nuts haha. I would recommend this place to anybody keep up the good work as I will be back to try more drinks and food out!"
Robert A.,"Ventura, CA",46,163,,4.0,6/2/2016,"PROs, CONs, and summary. Went here with my family and other friends recently. PROs--Good food.  The fluffy pizza from BJs is better than many restaurants that specialize only in pizza.  I love the pizza here.  The homemade brew is good too, they have their mixture down to a science, it is better than many breweries I've been to the past year or so.  Everybody in my group seemed to enjoy their food and their cocktails.  Restroom was clean too, which is a big deal for me as I don't want to get Hepatitis B from a nasty restroom.  The overall area this location is in is great.  There's shopping and nice stores, and the grounds of this shopping center are clean. CONs--Parking sucks.  There's a carport that gets full quickly, and you'll have to hike to the restaurant.  The wait staff was rather impersonal, and not very friendly.  Yes, they did their jobs, but I was hesitant to ask for things as they seemed surly.  Food took much too long to come out too.   Would I go back?  Yes.  I like BJs food and drinks.   ***As a side note for people who come here with families, it's my understanding that this is a family restaurant.  If people don't like families coming here, how about going to a 21 and over establishment?***"
Ronald M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1904,533,1462,4.0,11/26/2015,"My wife and I enjoy the food here, a very good menu selection. Friendly and timely service even when crowded. What more can you ask?"
Maui G.,"Newhall, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/11/2017,"THE worst Friday dinner experience tonight. Where do I begin. We decided to sit at a bar booth as it was available. Waited about 10 mins for someone to come to our table, nothing...We finally flagged down ""our server"" to request some menus. We each ordered a beer, appetizer, and I ordered the bbq chop chicken salad (requesting no beans and no cilantro)....half way through drinking the beer, I went to take a sip and some large unexplainable object stuck to the rim, not sure what it was. Possibly leftover food or almost like a piece of napkin from the cup not being washed properly? Ick. Advised the server who apologized and brought me another. Ok...then the appetizer came...no plates to eat them on (chicken lettuce wraps-KINDA TOUGH w/o making a mess)...had to ask for those too...Finally, my salad came WITH beans. I almost ate it b/c I was sick of bothering him with anymore issues...but unfortunately, the lettuce tasted like old expired ""Ready Pak"" pre-made salad package you get at the supermarket lol. Just gross. I couldn't do it. We advised server who again apologized, and we also asked for check. Got check; he took off the salad, but charged us for the suspect beer. Idk Although it wasn't his fault, it would have been more hospitable of him to comp that in my opinion with a customer going home w/o dinner now? Sigh...All and all, just bad. I use to like Bj's. The quality has def gone down. We won't be coming back...."
Marty I.,"Valencia, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/10/2017,"This placed used to have okay food and average service. Now the food is only fit for a trash can. Asked fries to be crisp with the fish and chip order but when my food arrived it was hard to decide which was made the day before and reheated in a microwave.  Soggy and barely warm and the fish had an off smell about it.  The fried artichoke was so f""&$ing salty they took it off the bill. If I was blind I would have thought I was eating straight up SALT DEEP FRIED BATTER and it was also almost warm.  Do yourself a huge favor and save your time and money.... go to Del Taco!!!"
Sara K.,"Canyon Country, CA",24,35,50,4.0,1/10/2017,We love this place! Sometimes it gets busy on the weekends but usually it's pretty fast. The beer and food is delish and  I like all the choices you have for beer and appetizers. I give it a 4 star because parking kind of sux. They can't help that. On the plus side it's convenient to other stuff. You can eat and drink and then shop. Always a good time.
Christina T.,"Granada Hills, CA",2,9,9,1.0,1/7/2017,"Horrible service. Worst BJ's I've ever been to. Walked in with my sister and was told there was no wait, but the person who worked as the ""seater"" wasn't there. So, the girl in the front with the glasses told us they'll be right there, waited a bit and two groups with two people walked in after us. The last group of two guys got seated right away while my sister and I were sitting there waiting. Walked up to ask the girl with glasses when we'll be seated and she didn't even pay attention to me. Completely ignored me and the man that was talking to her. So I walked right out. Guess girls that work at BJ's are desperate to give out bjs. Wish I caught her name, but for now, she's the girl with glasses. Watch out."
Tim H.,"Colorado Springs, CO",30,368,89,4.0,9/10/2015,"My wife-unit really likes BJ's, especially the drinks.  I like them too and we both like the wide selection of well-made food. We eat at the BJ's in Colorado Springs often, so visiting this place is like seeing an old friend when we've had a stressful day. I'm not all that thrilled with the parking situation here, but we were able to park on the street and walk a bit.  Didn't need to resort to parking structure, but they have one. As is typical in California, it was a little louder than I would like."
Victoria C.,"San Pedro, CA",198,94,76,3.0,12/14/2016,"BJ's is a good place to go for great celebrations or to grab a drink and watch a sports game. I remember when I use to LOVE going to BJ's, but i definitely feel that the quality of food has declined over the years... or maybe my taste just got better. lol. The one thing I will always LOVE from here is the white chocolate macadamia pazookie! Service wise, this place is pretty hit or miss."
