Joseph Y.,"Chatsworth, CA",4999,701,684,4.0,4/28/2014,"BJ's is a solid place for lunch, dinner and drinks. It's a well rounded place to go for a business lunch, birthday celebration or to watch your favorite sports game. The quality of food is above average and prices are on par with equivalent restaurants such as Cheesecake factory.  Service is great, but during busy times can have you waiting for up to 30 minutes. They have great outdoor seating facing the Town Center and heat lamps if necessary. They also have partial outdoor seating, where you are in a glass enclosure. Their beer is excellent! I love all of their in house brews. Too bad I stopped drinking because their sampler (small amount of all their beer lines) is great for beer lovers."
Jay M.,"Cathedral City, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2017,"If I could give no stars I would. Absolute worst experience I've ever had at a BJ'S restaurant. My sever Sabrina was rude and forgot about every order, also the manager was no help at all. The manager just laughed at us and took forever to give us our checks after the we explained our horrible experience.  The appetizers were cold by the time they came out and our drinks were warm as well. I don't recommend coming to this BJ'S location."
Fun C.,"San Diego, CA",255,366,795,2.0,6/17/2015,"I know why they only have 2.5 's Good food POOR service - not friendly or accommodating I sat at a table in the bar at 6:55p. Waiter (Kyle 830) shows up at 7:07p and denies my request for a happy hour beer, stating that it's too late. I told him I had been waiting, but he shrugged his shoulders and didn't even try to help somehow. My bison burger was ordered ""rare"" and came out well done. Tasty, but not a quality $11 burger. I still tipped 18%, because this post will do more harm than the loss of $1 to the server."
Spencer S.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",100,66,,4.0,10/10/2016,I do not mind a good night out at our local BJ's. They always have great food and the service is pretty good as well. Many memories made in this restaurant. It's not the best but it's still a great place to go eat.
Heather Z.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",135,183,102,4.0,7/3/2015,"Been here twice & the food was good ! I've heard mixed reviews on this place so when I was in the area & I was hungry I decided to try it out. Both time were both pretty pleasant. When it's busy the wait times aren't that bad, service is friendly & always checking to make sure you have what you need. The menu itself is pretty big & I had a hard time choosing what I wanted both times ! The pastas are pretty good ! I forgot what it's called but it was like a cajun pasta with shrimp & their jambalaya is to really good as well ! Our appetizer the second time I went was kind of disappointing. We shared the calamari & it was bland, lacking in salt, no flavor, just felt like I was chewing on breaded rubber.  The appetizer is my only complaint. Other than that the food is good & I'd come back here with friends any time !"
Nina S.,"Valencia, CA",1,16,,3.0,7/24/2017,"Not the best experience here. Almost missed our movie waiting for a pizookie. The staff was friendly enough but we're not very attentive. This place needs to get their time management in order, will not be returning to this location any time soon."
Bryan K.,"Newhall, Newhall, CA",0,2,,3.0,7/29/2017,Love their food but the last few trips have been subpar on the assertive. Not sure if they have had lots of turnover or just not staged properly. Hope they figure it out soon.
Jordan S.,"Valencia, CA",140,155,3,2.0,2/29/2016,"This place is so MESSY it gives me anxiety. I swear the staff is messy and Bj's attracts the messiest people too.  Every single staff member is so inconsistent that I practically work here because I have no problem walking into the kitchen for food returns and getting my refills behind the cubicles as I please. The staff is nice, but their service of attendance is awful. I don't blame them too much, because I've seen the disgusting behavior their manager treats them with.  The food is also not great at all. I have no problem paying $15 bucks for a salad, but I do have a problem when it comes soggy and tastes like it was prepackaged and drenched in pure liquid fat. The same goes with the burgers... Dry meat and super oily buns. If only their sodas had proper carbonation. It's like drinking syrup.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place shuts down within the next 2 years, as it only truly gets business from the mall and the location next to the movie theaters. Can we also talk about how DATED that ""big screen"" is at the bar too? 15 years old/older or what? Do people actually watch the ""game"" on that? *laughs* I will be back in the future as it's inevitable. It's 1/5 places in SCV that are decent and that aren't totally inedible.  The bathrooms are also cleaner than the main floor, but the trash cans are never emptied and are always over flowing onto the ground.  Been coming for 15 years and within the past 5, it has been slowly but surely rolling down the hill. It's only a matter of time until the ball hits the lake."
Hannah R.,"Valencia, CA",3,61,67,2.0,7/1/2016,"My boyfriend's family took me here for the first time a few days ago. I've lived in Santa Clarita for six years and I'd never gone into the great mystery that was BJ's in all that time. I had a wonderful time with them, but if I had been there by myself I wouldn't have cared for it at all. The service was okay. Nothing mind-blowing. She was nice but not the best waitress I've ever had in my life. The look of the place is very casual and it's comfy. Not the upscale kind of place people in Santa Clarita want, but it's the kind of place they're used to by now.  The food was okay. I got the quesadilla and while I liked it, again it wasn't anything mind-blowing. It was overall kind of mediocre. Compared to all the great things I've heard about it, it's definitely less impressive than I thought. My boyfriend loved the steak, so maybe it's worth going for that, but as for my meal it was just okay. I'm not sure if I'll come here again. I would if I went with the same people because I know I'd have a good time, but I wouldn't bring anyone here just for kicks. I'd pick Islands or Johnny Rockets instead."
Colin E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",137,28,18,2.0,5/14/2016,Went with some friends for a pizookie and garlic knots and we did not get the garlic knots until we were leaving. The service was par until this happened waiter was friendly and parking is far walking over all 4/10. The waiter was very nice and friendly he saved this review a star his name was Mario.
Ray G.,"Saugus, CA",0,13,,1.0,10/16/2016,"I was told their pizza was very similar to Numero Uno, which I like a lot, so I order a pizza on-line with extra cheese, Pepperoni and Sausage. It was ready when I got there and I brought it home. When I got home and opened the box there was NO cheese, a tiny amount of sauce, and a normal amount of Pepperoni. No Sausage. The amount paid reflected the number of ingredients. I realize that I should have looked at the pizza when I picked it up and most places show it to you automatically when you pick it up, but I would have never expected a pizza without cheese. Never again."
R M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,24,5,4.0,1/11/2017,"No complaints about the food, its always good! The wait to get inside is kind of frustrating at times, but i've learned to call ahead and they always seem to seat me and my family fairly quickly... The waiters are well mannered, haven't had any issues. I literally go there because my kids like the food and I love the lemon pepper wings, almost all of their food is good..."
Tiffany C.,"Seattle, WA",563,140,163,3.0,4/30/2016,"Pizookies. That's what I come here for. You can choose from multiple cookie types/flavors and ice cream flavors, and get multiple scoops of ice cream, or you can opt for the mini pizookie trio sampler (I usually get this). I love that the cookie bases are crunchy on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. The cold ice cream scoops pair nicely with the warm cookies, in the process melting the ice cream and creating a creamy ""sauce."" It sounds like a very simple dish but it tastes amazing. As for the savory food, I've tried some dishes like the burgers and the steak but they all seem rather average, though the portions are quite big. When I dine at a restaurant, I'd rather eat something that tastes like something I can't get at a fast food joint or something that I can't make for myself at home.  This place has indoor and outdoor seating and is quite spacious. It is located at the Valencia Town Center, where there is plenty of parking. The service is efficient and friendly."
Marianne Z.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",5,12,,5.0,11/13/2016,"After a movie last Sunday, my husband and I went to BJ's for a late lunch with his brother and sister-in-law.  They ordered a few awesome appetizers and my husband and I shared some guacamole and a French Dip sandwich.  It was delicious and plentiful.  They each had a specialty beer (I was the 'designated' driver so none for me.)  The menu was enormous and page after page filled with every kind of food you can imagine!  We sat in the bar area and tv's were everywhere.  A great place to go for a Sunday game day!"
Juan B.,"Castaic, CA",114,24,25,5.0,4/2/2016,Great place to sit down and socialize! They actually had the El Classico game on and we're really attentive.  Shout out to Curtis as he was always attentive and asked if we needed anything else frequently! He was also the one that put the game on for us!
April S.,"Visalia, CA",0,30,,2.0,6/11/2016,"The service was good. The food was bad. I've been to BJ's in other towns and been happier with the food, which is why we chose to eat here. Our table ordered a variety of items for lunch. Everything was room temperature and bland. I won't be back."
P D.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,33,,1.0,6/7/2017,"Normally I wait a couple days before writing a review to let my feelings settle, but not this time.   Tonight, we came to BJ's with family and friends to celebrate a graduation.  We were seated at approximately 6:40 PM and drink orders taken.  Ten minutes later server returns, with no drinks and takes our orders.  Twenty minutes later, still no drinks, so we ask, server say nothing and disappears for ten minutes, finally returning with our drinks.  Over an hour passes and still no food.  One member of our party asks our server when we will get our food and he replies, ""you'll get it when it comes out"".  Unbelievable.  Over ninety minutes pass when our food finally arrives, one person with our group ordered a small pizza, she never got it.  Every time we asked our server where her pizza is, he replied that it was still in the oven.  For 90 minutes?? The server said they ran out of small pizzas, so they gave her a large and charged her for a medium!  She ended up paying more for something she didn't want in the first place.   The son (he's 5) of another one our friends had macaroni and cheese, he was the last person to receive his dinner, one hour and forty five minutes later.  When we asked our server, he mumbled something about a mix up in the kitchen.  How can you mess up mac and cheese? In addition to the extremely long wait for our food, our server never bothered to refill any of our drinks.  I had ice tea, which was warm, plus he never bothered to bring sugar.  We asked for water twice, 15 minutes later it arrived.  Plus, we asked our server for silverware, he never brought it, we had to flag down another server to get it for us plus he left the menus on the table the entire time we were there.  Couple the atrocious service with the extremely long wait for our food and we had one of the worst dining experiences we've had in a long time.  I understand being a server is a difficult job, but this service was so bad, I didn't think twice about not leaving a tip. You can be assured that this will be our last time coming to this or any other BJ's restaurant.  In fact, I will be contacting their corporate headquarters to let them know of our horrible experience."
Jennifer A.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",32,43,4,1.0,10/16/2016,"I've been to this location a few times and am always reluctant because of poor experiences. I thought today could be different but I was wrong! I arrived with my children around 12:00pm. We were greeted by a kind hostess who sat us down right way in a booth very close to the entrance. My children and I waited about 15 minutes- definitely more than the standard wait time during busy service (at the time of arrival it was semi-busy but not slammed)- not one staff member acknowledged our table. I counted at least a dozen different team members that passed by our table- including a man who may have been the manager on duty- and no one said hello or I'll be with you in a few minutes or anything (let alone drink orders)! I purposely waited what I believed was 15 minutes to see if we would be acknowledged and of course, we were not. At this point we walked out and dined elsewhere. BJ'a has the advantage as one of the limited franchised family restaurants in Santa Clarita so I can see why they continue to stand- it certainly isn't successful for its service and high quality of food (unless food has improved in the last year- had an unfortunate experience with their food too). No more pizookies in Santa Clarita for me!"
Wesley M.,"Valencia, CA",0,8,,5.0,9/23/2016,"OMG.  We had to wait over 25 minutes to sit down. Then another 5 for our waiter. And you won't believe this, another 8 to get our drinks.  I could have died twice.  Don't get me started on how long our food took.....yep, another 25 minutes.   Add that up and it equals me being one big pussy........ Cat.   Oh yah, I couldn't believe that no one parked my car and carried me to the front door as well.   Just for that, shame on you, shame on you.  Oh, did I mention the food was so bad that I had seconds.  Also, it didn't help that our waiter was cute too.   Damn him for being cute.  That really made our experience a nightmare."
Holly J.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,16,18,1.0,6/1/2016,"Shortly after foods came to the table, the server brought us bill and asked if we need togo boxes. We said ""no we're still working"" but after 15 minutes later or so, he came back 2-3 more times and asked (again) if we need togo box. Our group felt very rushed to finish our meal by his service attitude and he was very annoying. Don't come to this restaurant unless you want to ruin your day. Bjs has always been like this in any locations and this will be my last visit ever. Dear Activist investors, you will drop it like a hot brick. Who cares whether this company has 1.10 billion market capitalization? They don't even uphold the fundamental of ""fundamental factor"" as a company."
