Brian S.,"Hemet, CA",0,2,,2.0,6/18/2017,"My wife and kids took me to the Santa Clarita version of BJs on Saturday night June 18th since we were having a family weekend in that area at Six Flags, hotel stay and all. The area was beautiful, right near the Westfield Mall and in a gorgeous neighborhood. We arrived around 8:30pm and were seated in 10 minutes when they told us it would 30. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and everything was going great. I ordered the sriracha boneless wings and we could have used a drink refill during this time, but we didn't get one. Then the entrees started to role out, they brought my wife's, both of my kids and then the waitress comes back 5 minutes later to check if everything was OK, and noticed she never brought me my Baked Zitti. About 5 minutes after that the manager tells me the ""chef"" said it was coming right out. Another 5 minutes pass and the waitress offers me a soup, and at this point my family is almost done eating the meal they practically let get cold while waiting to eat with me. Once my  penne pasta with some cheese and light sauce (virtually no flavor or meat) arrives, I was well passed caring about being at this restaurant. Once they screwed up my food, our waitress was M.I.A. on giving anyone at our table service. Whether it was embarrassment or not caring she never came around. I had to hunt her down for the check, the manager never tried to make up for bringing my food out after my whole family finished their food so I left her a smaller than average tip that she didn't deserve and then we headed somewhere else for dessert. Yes it was that bad even the Bazooki wasn't going to save them. Next time I'm in the area I'll be spending my hard earned money at The Cheesecake Factory or the olive garden which are both on the same street. Customer service shouldn't be a chore if you work at a food establishment."
Kathleen M.,"Rocklin, CA",2,4,,1.0,10/29/2016,"I have given this BJs location three chances to redeem themselves. Unfortunately, they did not step up. Service is terrible! You are either overlooked by servers, or your food is forgotten. I have experienced all three on all three occasions. I am a frequent BJs customer, and travel nation wide. By far the worst BJs, unfortunately it's in my hometown."
Jackie C.,"Canyon Country, CA",71,4,,1.0,6/10/2017,I went there last night with a friend. First when we walked in there was a string pungent smell that was not agreeable...but my friend wanted to have a few drinks at the bar so we stayed. I ordered two drinks and they had to be the worst watered down drinks I have had. I do not recommend coming to this place. It has gotten progressively worse with time.
Matthew M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,16,3,5.0,4/23/2016,We came in and we were taken care of ! Eric the bartender and Fernando the manager was awesome ! The whole staff is awesome and always a good time ! Gonna come back just for that !
Peter H.,"Los Angeles, CA",513,527,3716,2.0,10/26/2013,"Service is slow.  Kitchen is slow.  Food is eh.  I think they should shut this place down and put up a Cheesecake Factory, Texas Roadhouse or Carraba's.   This restaurant is not a good anchor and needs to change."
Yessenia R.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/22/2017,"I can't even count how many times I've given this place a chance because it's so popular, but you are just asking to have bad service. As a server I'm very understanding but every time I visit this location it's a nightmare.. Get your pazookie somewhere else, the drive will probably be shorter than the time it will take this place to bring it to you."
Roxie N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,29,4,1.0,3/22/2017,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! If I could give no stars I would. I've never walked out of a restaurant because the service was so horrible, but thanks to BJ's in SCV I can unhappily say that I have. I took my family to eat there (party of 6) after church on Sunday around 12:30(there was no wait). We had tickets to see a movie later that afternoon, but we had a few hours until then so we didn't think it would be a problem. We arrived at 12:30, ordered our food very shortly there after, and waiting until 2PM and never received our food. We asked the waitress after an hour of waiting what was taking so long, she said ""just 5 more minutes"" we waited another 15 minutes and then got up and left without ever having gotten our food. At that point we were going to be late for our movie, so we had to choose between not getting food or missing our movie. Our party was GLAD to leave by that point. People ought to be able to complete their meal in an hour and a half, instead we sat there hungry with nothing to show for. EXTREMELY UNHAPPY with my service here. I will not be returning to this location, will likely not return to any BJ's franchise ever, and I'll make sure to tell all my friends in the valley what a horrible restaurant this is. I was the one who recommended this restaurant to my family, and I'm embarrassed that I did, I won't make that mistake again!"
Mary J. M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",22,201,128,3.0,3/20/2016,"Although there is not too much here for a vegan to enjoy... They do have a wonderful happy hour... Good prices but drinks here ALWAYS come pretty sweet. Not a fan of the super sweet cocktails... I 100% of the time have to order an extra shot on the side to mix in so its drinkable. ( and no, I don't have to do that anyplace else... This is the only place I have to do that)"
Bryan T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",86,26,20,5.0,4/14/2015,"My wife and I came here for lunch on 4-14-15...our server was Joey...let me tell you about the best server here at BJ's in Valencia... Joey is a great server, knows the product and nice as well!! He isn't that overwhelming type of server that you get sometimes.  We ordered the BJ's BBQ Lunch Platter and the Pizza and Salad combo, all was great, tasted wonderful and no problems.  The manager came up and asked how everything is doing, we told him that Joey is a great server, very knowledgable and customer service oriented!! If you come here for lunch or dinner...make sure you sit in Joey's section!!!"
Kevin H.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/13/2017,"Bjs is always a hit or miss, but recently my friends and I have been enjoying the happy house and no complaints! Good times at bjs in scv"
Ryan G.,"Las Vegas, NV",14,192,17,2.0,11/30/2015,"The food was fine - it tasted like any other BJ's. The service was very poor though. We had a large group that came in for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Trying to book the group was a pain since we got multiple directions on what to do. We initially called and were told we needed to come in to speak with the manager. We live 45 minutes away so we planned an evening to come down for dinner, and get everything booked. Once we were seated we brought up the reservation and had to bounce around a few clueless people until a manager came over and told us we just had to call and could do everything over the phone. The night we came in the food and drinks were taken care of, but there were multiple other issues. The food was setup buffet style and our guests told they could go serve themselves, but several dishes on the buffet table were missing utensils. We had to ask several people until someone finally brought the tools needed. Since it was a rehearsal dinner there was one point where someone was attempting to make a speech. The only person standing and was holding a paper she was reading from. This was the moment one of the waitresses chose to ask the speaker (mid speech) where she should drop off two sodas. I don't know why she expected the person standing to know who ordered a couple of sodas, and why she felt she had to stop a person clearly in the middle of a speech as opposed to anyone else around. It was absolutely rude. At one point a full glass of ice water spilled all over the floor in between two tables. Our server was standing right there, watched it happen, asked if everyone was okay, and then disappeared. I ended up having to go to the server station and taking a handful of cloth napkins to lay on the floor because our server never same back with a towel, or any offer of assistance for us dry the floor. I know it was a big group, and accommodating for time or accuracy I am fully understanding of. The issues we had demonstrated a lack of coordination and consideration for our group which was extremely irritating."
Carol N.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,1.0,3/24/2017,From the moment we entered we were not acknowledged. Waited....Then I had to give the hostess my request multiple times. After which she still got it wrong. Our food took forever to come out. The table next to us with three guests same as our party ordered ate and left while we still waited for a barbecue pizza (that had no barbecue sauce)and a pasta dish. Our waitress was cordial but never smiled. We ordered a dessert that took so long I just wanted to cancel my order and leave. It took forever and then asking for the coupon discount and the check to come took another 20-30 minutes!! Terrible service!
R M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,24,,1.0,5/6/2017,"Service over the years we've been coming here has been getting slower and much worse.  Usually the food is ok.  The beer is good and we've had some great meals but more recently some not so good.  Service has become so slow though its pathetic.  Most recently we dined in the bar area (on a weekday at 5pm so fairly early).  That area did have a decent amount of people but only one server for the whole area and to top it off the guy was not friendly at all!    That seems to be the case there now and days when we go there...not enough servers.  Too cheap to staff more??  Not sure why they do this but it takes FOREVER  to even get you order in, FOREVER to get your food and FOREVER to get the check!  Plan on spending at least 2 hours there before your able to leave.    Lately the food (at least some of it) has been cold but when that happens we do not hesitate to send it back.  They even totally forgot to bring out my son's dinner on a recent visit and when they finally did everyone else was already done!! I've given them enough chances to get it right but we are done with this place.  There are way too many good restaurants in the SCV to have to deal with this mess!"
Byron P.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",153,287,44,3.0,11/15/2014,"Many years ago, I used to come to BJs every weekend, hang out in the bar and see old friends. It was easily the best guarantee for a fun time. There were cool patrons, cool staff and great food. Then it got corporate and I stopped coming. All the staff changed. Customer service plummeted. Managers were too suit and tie, not enough khakis & polos, if you know what I mean. Food, however, was always pretty good. We decided to give it another shot on Veteran's Day, simply because they were one of many local restaurants offering something free to veterans. I think that is totally awesome and well deserved, even if it is something very small like this. I am extremely pro-America and pro-troops, but I digress. Anyway, BJs offered a free plate up to a $9 value. I've always known the pizza here is amazing but I asked our server if it was worth trying a new, different entree (thyme chicken) or just order a new pizza (Bacon Chicken Ranch) I haven't had before. He recommended the pizza so I ordered a mini (individual pizza, 4 slices). It had tomatoes, Bacon, chicken, red onions and cheese with ranch dressing drizzled on top. We also had the Fritos nachos (complementary, but not so good) and chicken tortilla soup. Soup was very good and, as usual, the pizza was excellent. I'm glad our server made that call. He provided excellent, friendly service and was very patient and engaging with our daughter too. I can't remember his name but he was a young guy with the most unexpected, deep voice ever. That should narrow it down. Nice work dude. However, I can't say the same about the rest of the experience. The menus were sticky (gross) and there were dirty cloth napkins underneath our table. That makes me wonder how well they actually clean the tables between parties and things in general. I mean, at this point in my book, BJs is a class above TGIF, which isn't saying much. It's a good thing I like the food, otherwise three stars is reaching."
Curtis C.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,5,,1.0,10/4/2016,"Service was astonishingly poor. Incorrect drinks, no refilling of water, and to top it off being rudely told by the server in the middle of our meal (without any prompting) that we can't split our check (there were 7 people eating and drinking) because it would take her 20 to 30 minutes to deal with. Thank goodness she made sure to tell us how we could go about figuring out who owed what though - ""You can just write out on the back of the receipt which card is paying for what or use cash."""
Patrick V.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",2,21,1,2.0,7/7/2017,"Normally, I would give BJs a 3 to 4 star rating. The food is pretty good, the beer is tasty and well crafted. Service is usually solid. I love the BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad. However, last Monday, I brought my family to grab a bite before a movie. We sat in the bar area to catch Happy Hour. Unfortunately, we sat next to a group of about 5 BJs employees who were enjoying themselves quite a bit, presumably after their lunch shifts. They were drinking a fair bit and getting loud. I don't really care about that too much, but I was surprised by the cussing and the volume at which the cussing was broadcast to the entire restaurant. Now, I'm no prude. I can swear with the best of 'em. But since my kids were at the next table, I would have thought that they would have toned it down. Alas, alcohol does impair judgement. I am sure my kids know all the words that they were using, but still... As employees, STILL IN UNIFORM, they represent the company, and should conduct themselves appropriately. I will still enjoy BJs in the future, but thought that management should be aware."
Sandy P.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,8,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Not only did it take almost an hour for food, but service sucked. The worst part is that at some point during our meal someone stole my wallet !!!!  Not only that they made a PURCHASE AT BEST BUY WHILE WE WERE STILL THERE EATING!!!!!!! Stay far away from this place. Told all of this to management  and they do not give a crap. I guess they keep you there and give bad service so that whoever steals your wallet can buy something before you have look for the wallet to pay."
Yellow R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,50,66,4.0,6/13/2015,"Great location for reasonable pub food. After a movie at the Edwards Theater. BJ's Brewhouse is a comfortable walk from the theater. Reservations are recommended, if dining during prime time. There is valet parking for $5.00. Extensive menu of food and drink, and caloric intakes are posted in the menu for the fit and dieting group.  The outside dining can be pleasant on a mild temp day, particularly when there is a lively, noisy crowd inside. I enjoyed the Cherry Chipolte Glazed Salmon with Roasted Asparagus with Orzo. The rest of  the party enjoyed the Deep Dish Cheese Artichoke Pizza. The French Dip was good too. The French Fries were tasty and totally devoured. Service by Holly. our waitress was very good. I also appreciated that the $10.00 coupon was accepted from my smart phone. Looking forward to another visit."
James H.,"Valencia, CA",38,61,,5.0,7/6/2016,"As chain restaurants go, this is one of the best. It's no fancy steak-and-wine restaurant, but it has inexpensive, consistent, delicious food and beer, all with friendly and quick service. Plus, there's far more to the menu than just pizza. You won't be disappointed, unless your expectations are unreasonable."
Tara V.,"Valencia, CA",6,19,5,1.0,12/28/2016,"Two of our party of four ordered the top sirloin steak (medium well) and they were sooooo dry!!!! We mentioned it to our waiter and he said, ""Yeah, it's a new cook and it's going to be about a month before he gets better.""   What?????!!! Then another person checked on us, we told him and he said that's what you get when you order medium well.   No apologies at all!!!!"
