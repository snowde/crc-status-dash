C D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,49,67,5.0,1/23/2016,"We always like coming to this place because of the friendliness of the staff, service, and the food. Especially today since one of our dishes was free! No fault of ours though and no we did not complain either. First, the hostess with the mostest was friendly, we asked for a booth and since we can seat by the bar side we pretty much had our pick. Our server was Kyle and super nice guy. He always had a smile from start until he gave us our check. The food I've always enjoyed no matter what. Today we had the cherry chipotle glazed salmon with cuscus and asparagus, a turkey avocado burger, and a flat bread with the salad plus some type of cider...can't remember the name. Oh yeah we also had the artichoke dip with chips.  The food was great! No complains. Here's when the free turkey burger came. After waiting for our food for about 15 mins, Kyle came to our table and explained that the turkey burger was the only food that was still being prepared because they had a problem with their grill. So with our permission he took the rest of our order out to us sans the burger. This was after he came several times more before to check up on us. After another 5-10 mins the burger came out and it was fresh and hot off the grill! A few minutes later, the GM Mr. Dimitri came to our table and apologized for the delay and that he would comp the burger which we told him he didn't have too. But he insisted. He was truly very sincere! That was real customer service plus after all this, Kyle came back again and asked if the GM came out to talk to us.  Over all our experience here has always been good ones. Thanks Kyle and Mr. Dimitri!!!!!"
Chris P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",18,12,1,1.0,8/13/2016,"The wait time is horrendous!  Food was below average and to top it off, they served my daughter spoiled milk."
Mike R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,4/7/2017,Ordered soup salad combo for lunch on slow day. Waitress managed to get original order and 1 refill out in just over an hour. She disappeared for half an hour and we had to hunt staff down to get drink refills. Save the headache and go to Lucilles or Cheesecake Factory if you're eating around the mall.
Matthew M.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/5/2016,"The management here must have changed cause i love it here, i pretty consistantly eat in the bar area and have gotten great service everytime"
Probie-One Five -.,"Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA",94,38,62,1.0,12/20/2015,"PISS poor service. Can't even believe it.  If you finally get to order, you MIGHT get your food ... then again, you might not. Be willing to wait a half hour between each of your items. Just CRAZY."
Victor J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",60,105,130,3.0,1/5/2016,"I'm having their Italiano Vegetable Penne!  This includes Bell peppers, Onions, Garlic, and seasoned tomatoes tossed with marinara and finished with parmesan cheese and fresh Bas.  A glass of house Merlot and a side of chips."
Sam I.,"Canyon Country, CA",9,16,11,5.0,8/7/2016,"Best place for appetizers and beer!!! They have the best draft beers in Santa Clarita hands down, always a great time when I am here with friends. Great place for family and friends"
JANNETTE S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,13,,1.0,8/15/2015,"BAD BAD BAD SERVICE!!!  3 strikes you're out!!! I've been there 3 times in the last couple of months and the service sucks! I'm not sure who to blame, the waiters or kitchen.  With so many options in SANTA CLARITA BJS should be ashamed of themselves."
Amy G.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,29,8,1.0,8/7/2015,"Never again.  Service is way too inconsistent. My husband and I went last week, and it was good. So we went back today with a friend and it was BAD.  Troy was terrible! He never came to check on us to make sure our order was complete, or see if we needed anything. I had to grab him to ask for a refill on my drink, the Brussels sprouts that my husband did not receive, and the extra ranch dressing my friend requested."
Kathryn P.,"Castaic, CA",50,50,35,4.0,11/16/2014,Had a very good lunch time experience with my family. We all enjoyed are meals and our server was very pleasant.  My oldest son swears that they used to have ribs on the kids menu but now they don't. The chocolate peanut butter smores pazookie is evil!!! We destroyed it within seconds!
Christian E.,"Canyon Country, CA",118,25,2,1.0,2/14/2017,"Went in over the weekend with my family. Although typically the food is real good, this tine around it was horrible. Tasteless to the say the least! And to put a cherry on top of it, our server was rude through out most of the time we were there. As we sat and ate our plain food, not once did she come to refill my fiancée's iced tea. We'd ask for certain items and she wouldn't either bring them, or waited until we were done. As I would look around and oay attention to everyone else she was serving, it appeared as though they were having the same issues. At least with their service. Been to this BJ's many times before and I hate to have to write a bad review this time around, but that's just how bad we had it. Usually the place is amazing and the food is usually very well made. Oh, the only time the server began to actually show interest in us was at the end when we got our bill and was waiting for her tip. Biggest smiles at that point!"
Mimi D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/7/2016,the jambalaya is my favorite dish from here. The service though wasn't that great. Our waitress wasn't in the best mood and hardly ever came to check on our table. And the best part they are open late night.
Brandon S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,3,1.0,8/11/2016,"This place shouldn't even get one star because they are so stingy with their promotions. We are paying customers and came for their promotion and they denied us saying that they couldn't accept their own offer. I don't know what a promotion means if they don't allow you to use it. Also not once did they give us refills on our water and when we asked they said okay and never came back to our table. The food was mediocre at best and was not cooked correctly. If you are blind, deaf and dumb this place is for you."
Kim S.,"Saugus, CA",5,58,4,1.0,7/22/2016,Why do people still want to go to a restaurant that serves mediocre (at best) pizza that takes ONE HOUR to serve????
Matt D.,"Valencia, CA",23,197,21,4.0,11/14/2015,"The food quality is good, and the menu is huge. Lots of different items ordered at our table of 10 and everyone seemed to enjoy everything.  Our server Nicholas (Nick) was super. He was friendly, helpful, and super nice."
RoxanneRikki R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",81,132,47,1.0,5/4/2016,i thought I'd give this restaurant another shot but after my second time ordering the same mistake happened again and now I have to wait AGAIN! first time I ordered there was a discrepancy with the online pricing vs location pricing. but I had to call the second time bc on the chicken tenders the sauce was dumped on them making it soggy and gross. they had their take out girl come to my house but I waited an hour and a half later for the second item to come that I didn't even eat it. this time I specified on my order but again the SAUCE WAS DUMPED ON THE TENDERS YET AGAIN! they read everything else on my ticket cept BBQ SAUCE ON SIDE. this happened one to many times and here I am sitting in the lobby waiting for the correct item. TOTAL INCONVENIENCE!!! so while I wait for the correct item to be done my other items are not fresh.
E.J. T.,"Valencia, CA",8,28,14,4.0,6/23/2016,"Ok, so I have been extremely underwhelmed by BJ's for quite some time. BUT today I was pleasantly surprised. I normally only come when my children beg for pizookie. Which was the case today... But my food was excellent today, hot and quick. Waitress was attentive... I am so happy because I really do enjoy their food... When it comes out right and it's hot. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that I have to factor in the past fails... For today I can say I will be back soon!"
Mike D.,"Porter Ranch, CA",0,36,,1.0,11/19/2016,"This is the worst BJ's location. Wrong orders, slow service... Can I get some ketchup please! Took an hour and a half for lunch for 4. Couldn't get the table wiped down and servers were standing around texting. Let the Manager on duty know we had a bad experience and she handed me a card and contact this person. She had a stack of these cards so she must harms them frequently. Oh... And the Ketchup? Had go ask another table to use there's! Woodland hills and Burbank locations are great."
Ja Young Y.,"Santa Clarita, CA",139,36,36,4.0,9/20/2015,"I love BJs and the service at this location is okay. Giving it four stars because the food was super good and we left feeling super full and happy! my friends and I sat at the bar area because we did not want to wait an hour for dinner/dessert. Didnt take too long to place our order/get our order but our waiter did not come by too often so we often had to ask other waiters to bring us something. It was a busy night so we understood not a big deal.. The only thing meh about my experience was they ran out of vanilla ice cream for the pizzokie so they offered us chocolate ice cream instead. we thought that wouldnt be bad but NOPE! if BJ's runs out of vanilla ice cream and they said they'll give you chocolate ice cream instead, do NOT order it (unless you loveeeeee sweet stuff!) There is a reason WHY they use vanilla ice cream. The chocolate ice cream was just overwhelmingly sweet and I couldnt take another bite. Overall, our food was great, our beers were great and we had a good time at BJ's!"
Carol D.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/11/2016,"I try very hard to give any restaurant a ""they are just having a bad night"" pass or two, but I can no longer sit silent about this Bj's location.  This restaurant is consistently substandard.  The problems are across the board, poor food quality, poor service, and poor management.  For example, if you don't mine your order being wrong, your meal arriving before your drinks, or your meal arriving even before your flatware and napkins are on the table, or when they get your order correct, the rest of your parties meals are cold this is the restaurant for you.   If you want to eat at Bj's, lower your expectations, cross your fingers and take your chances.   We can only hope this restaurant will soon go the way of Applebee's and TGI Friday's as soon as possible and a REAL restaurant, hopefully not another substandard chain, will come in and take its place."
