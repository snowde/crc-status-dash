Nancy A.,"Burbank, CA",3,6,1,5.0,9/10/2015,Best customer service!  Always so quick to cater to your every needs  The food is always good and doesn't loose its quality!  Right in front of the gym so that's the only dangerous part of this place  they do have a healthy section to their menu and it looks delicious might have to try it some time!
Bob M.,"Peoria, AZ",62,82,47,4.0,7/19/2015,"I'll be honest; after reading all of the negative reviews about the quality of food declining and slow service I was skeptical about having dinner here tonight. We must have come at a good time.  My wife and I were seated immediately and we had our drinks within 5 minutes.  Our server, Pat, gave us a few minutes to go over the menu then he was back to take our order.  My wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I ordered the thin-crust tavern style pizza.  Both of our dishes arrived in 10 minutes.  We both enjoyed our meal. As for the service.  Our server was Pat. He was polite, attentive and quick to respond. We had a very pleasant experience and will definitely stop in again the next time we are passing through!"
Mila W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",28,10,3,2.0,6/23/2015,"I like eating here... But lately the food hasn't been fresh.  I usually get the tomato and mozzarella salad.  The last two times it wasn't so good, to the point that it made me sick when I got home :(  They definitely need to work on their customer service. Especially when u come in... Usually 3-4 people standing there just staring at u... They don't greet u like most places. Basically u gotta greet them and tell them how many in your party cuz they won't ask."
Kiani S.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",197,3,2,1.0,1/5/2016,"My friends and I went in the other night to grab a bite and the customer service was absolutely horrible! The waitress that was assigned to our table was sarcastic, rude, and snobby.   We sat down and put our drink orders in and when she brought them over she managed to spill one of the drinks on the table. She didn't even bother to apologize, just smirked and walked away. We figured it happens so we left that alone.   Then we put our food orders in and waited for what felt like forever. After an hour of waiting for our meals I asked her nicely if she could check in the food to see when it would be coming and her repose ""duh well they have to cook it."" followed by a sarcastic giggle. Hm, ooookay. Another 20 minutes goes by and the people that came after us have all gotten their food and left. When we finally received the food not only was it cold all the wings were undercooked. An hour and twenty minute wait and the food wasn't fully prepared?    We were all annoyed at that point and decided that we would just order pazookies to go but of course our lovely waitress was no where to be found. So we called for another server and asked if he could send her over. Another 10 minutes goes by and she finally appears, we put the orders in hoping they would be prepared quicker than the food. While waiting we see her speaking with a few of the other waitresses and she was pointing at us and giggling.. I'm sorry but that is something you just don't do. After being there for 2 1/2 hours and having to deal with such horrible service, we got our pazookies, paid for the cold- uncooked food and left..  We called immediately after we left to speak with a manger and of course they credited us for our bill but I don't even think any of us would go back."
Michael M.,"Chula Vista, CA",182,9,,1.0,6/18/2016,"Walked in at 10:55pm, with a party of 6.  Was told there was an hour and half wait.  The restaurant was busy but not full and there was nobody waiting. When my son asked an hour and a half? The blonde hostess answered rudely ""yes! An hour and a half!"" We should have yelped it first and I would have seen there was a 2 star review. If it wasn't for the name, it would be closed down for their horrible attitudes."
Rose M.,"Lancaster, CA",22,11,,5.0,8/6/2015,"I've been eating at this BJ's for several years now, on a regular basis. I'm generally pleased with the food, the service, and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I use my Rewards card to get free dessert, or a five or ten dollar discount on my bill, after building up enough points to redeem.  Last year I contacted the manager to express my dissatisfaction with the temperature in the restaurant; no matter what time of year it was, the place was always freezing cold! I'm happy to say that he returned my emails, explained that they were having issues with climate control, but that they had resolved those issues. I agree; the temperature is much more comfortable now! It's nice to contact a manager and actually have your concerns be taken seriously, and then (even better), resolved!!!! Five stars!!!"
Nikki Y.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,22,1,1.0,4/10/2016,"Good food but worst service. My family & I came here for a Sunday lunch.  We had to wait 40minutes for our orders. We even finished all the appetizers & still no food. I ordered a Chicken Alfredo & there was no chicken. I told the server and she asked me if I was sure. I had to mix the pasta and look for the chicken infront of her. I was going to attach a picture of my food to show how obvious it is when there's a chicken. Next, I ordered pizookie for dessert beforehand & it took another 40minutes for them to serve it. We had to go somewhere else and decided to have the pizookie to go and she asked me again if I was sure? Because they have to re-make the pizookie? Umm. that's the reason why I am ordering it to-go so it's faster. But no, she makes us wait again."
Jacob M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",7,6,,5.0,10/9/2016,"I absolutely love this place, I'm usually at this location every once in a while when I get the chance to hang out with them. They have a variety of food choices including BBQ pulled pork, hickory brisket bacon cheeseburger, pizza, and much more. My main choice is the ribs with a baked potato side and mashed potatoes. I myself work at a BBQ place and this food is superb when it comes to BBQ. Now I am gluten free because of an allergy, but bj's has some choices in gluten free foods including the thin crust pizza and the pizookie. The manager Fernando at this location is spot on with the way he manages his employees. I enjoy always having him there whenever I come to visit and appreciate his effort into getting the best service for me and my friends. Overall it's a great location if you are a local here in Santa Clarita."
Cindy S.,"Valencia, CA",68,2,,4.0,7/9/2016,"I have to give BJ's Valencia a follow up review. In response to my initial complaint, the Manager, has taken the time to explain the situation and has also rectified the problem.  We are happy that this has been brought to their attention and they are going to try and make sure that the staff is on top of their game now and in the future as well.  Thank you Dimitri for resolving our particular problem and we will see you soon!!   CLS"
M R.,"Altadena, CA",0,14,,1.0,7/9/2016,"This place is mediocre at best!!! It was lunchtime, it wast busy there was no excuse for bad service.. I had to ask for my drink twice and still didn't get it. The tip that was left was for the cooks only.. not for the service.."
Sandra S.,"Valencia, CA",4,7,,5.0,6/14/2016,"My family and I go to BJs quite often because of the variety and great quality of food. But they also have great customer service. The manager, Fernando, is so friendly and makes you feel like part of the family. Our waiter this past Friday, Troy, was efficient, friendly and patient. We were a party of 9, including 3 kids, and he made sure all of us were happy, and we were. Just love this place - especially the Pizookie!"
H B.,"Valencia, CA",4,100,26,4.0,7/31/2015,"The stars are for the managers Fernando,and Mark, the bartender Bennett, and the waiter Billy. The food has always been prepared as ordered, and the soups are bubbly hot. Tuesday's are all wines half off in the bar, just try to get in the bar Tuesday's. Parking is usually in one of the structures, as curbside in a mall is far and few. Don't get in a rush as the servers are inundated with tables, just relax and enjoy the moment, life is short Billy and Kyle never forget what we have, super servers."
Ali J.,"Valencia, CA",0,22,1,1.0,11/18/2016,"Really Disappointed.... We originally went to the new Cheesecake Factory, wait wasn't bad, about 30 minutes, it was more about the wait to be greeted after seating we noticed, so we ultimately decided to save time and head over to BJS. We got seated right away, greeted within a reasonable time ordered 2 salads and onion rings, he asked if we wanted the onion rings right away, we said YES!!! as we all laughed. We never saw the onion rings, he never mentioned them, to be honest, we only saw Trent 3x, when he took the order, when he dropped the order, when he finally stopped shooting the shit in the kitchen and brought out the check! It's 1:30pm on a Thursday, not a holiday, kids aren't on break, there's really no excuse to provide service like that, especially when you have up and coming restaurants near by, you should probably really try to step up your game!"
Raymee N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,114,1,2.0,10/28/2015,"Only good thing was the service. I generally enjoy BJ's (minds out of gutters, please). But not this one for some reason. Happy hour drinks were probably the weakest I've ever had. And I've a had A LOT of happy hour drinks. Ordered 7&7s....99% of the drink was the non-alcoholic 7. The last one I ordered before switching to beer I could swear was only 7up. Most expensive sodas ever!  Very disappointing.  If you are going to get the ""happy hour sized"" appetizers (spinach & artichoke dip, for example) and you are not by yourself- I'd say don't. Get the regular sized, or you will wish you had order two. TIIIII-NY!!  Ordered the chili in a bread bowl and wished I had skipped the bread bowl. Chili was decent, bread bowl was slightly burnt and more like a giant crouton. Not the soft, eat-with-the-chili bread I was hoping for.   Not a fan of this location.  I'm not the type to send food/drinks back or complain. I just take it as it comes. So, I write this hoping I don't get the ""why didn't you send it back or ask to speak to a manager?"" message from a manager.  Basically blaming the customer for their less than mediocre experience.  That's all."
Emmanuel J.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Worse fucking Restaurant ever!!!!! I came in today at 11:45am , I older my food at 12:05, and my food never came , and it was already 1:20pm , I just payed for the drinks , I left upset with my wife;( I don't recommend that restaurant."
John S.,"Chatsworth, CA",0,12,1,5.0,5/13/2016,"Came here the other day to meet a few friends for some drinks and a quick bite.  I must say the ribs and the deep dish pizza were amazingly delicious and to top it off with thier pazookie hit the spot! Staff were friendly and attentive, which made the night even better.  Good spot out there in Valencia!!"
Lydia P.,"Valencia, CA",73,163,82,3.0,4/19/2016,"The service was great but the food was just ok. I had the cherry glazed salmon and the sauce tasted like the syrup you buy at the local grocery store.. sort of runny and too sweet (not in a good way but more like too much sugar). whatIever it was, it wasn't great. The steak was asked to be cooked medium rare.. came out medium well. Overall, it's a mediocre casual dining."
Jackie Z.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,11,4,1.0,9/6/2015,"Horrible service and food!!! We went there on a slow day for lunch and we had to ask three times for our drinks to be refilled...wtf?!?  My sister's lunch cheese deep dish pizza looked disgusting (Chuck E. Cheese pizza looks better than what they served)...my ""unlimited"" soup and salad was not so unlimited since my server never came back to see what else I wanted to get.  I asked for unsweetened iced tea, and my refill was their passion iced tea! The location is great, but that's about it. If I could get ""Zero"" stars, I would...a one star is generous! We won't be going back...EVER!!!"
Jenn J.,"Valencia, CA",0,10,,1.0,12/18/2016,"Terrible service, terrible food. It took 30 mintes to get a pizza and burger. I ordered a burger with a gluten free bun and my meat patty was thrown on a plate and my bun came in a plastic bag still frozen in the middle. A manager took it back to the kitchen to make it look more like a burger and brought it back with the burger cold. My wilted coleslaw was disguised with extra cayenne pepper to make it look fresher when they brought back the old plate of cold food fresh from the kitchen. Disgusting food, disgusting presentation and way overpriced for such garbage. If I could score negative points, I would."
