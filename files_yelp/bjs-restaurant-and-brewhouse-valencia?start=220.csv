Steve B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",6,105,3,1.0,11/23/2014,"BJ's is really disappointing. Went today and after waiting for a table, was brought to a table that although it was set for the next customer, it was still filthy.  I had to force them to clean it. The menus were also not clean and even the silverware was not clean.  Ugh. They didn't have kids menu's for some reason, but they did make horrible paper copies of it that were so dark that it was illegible. How anyone would have the gall to actually hand that out as a menu is beyond me.   The food came out (chicken tenders, corn dogs, fries and a mini pepperoni pizza) and looked like it had come from the frozen food from the section in the grocery store you never buy from.  It was bland and tasteless just like all the employees.  I noticed no one ever smiled.   The is my last time coming here.  Awful experience."
Tereza B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,14,3,1.0,10/2/2016,The worst place I have ever been in my life we order jambalaya it came 1 hour after . They told us it because of chicken was burned so they had to make another chicken really ????? We didn't ate jambalaya because we was about to leave and then they brought it. Never will be back.
Angela B.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,28,,2.0,11/13/2016,"I haven't written many reviews and never a negative one.  Dined here 2 weeks ago with my husband and 9 year old son and have nothing  but positive things to say about that experience.  Sat in the bar and everything was top notch.  Fast forward to this evening.  Our son likes going there because he his big into Pokemon and there are Poke stops nearby.  Figured it would be on the busier side so did online check in.  Was told about 15 minutes.  That's reasonable at 6:30 on a Sunday night.  45 minutes later, I double check with the host stand and am told ""Oh it'll be a while longer"".  Ok...whatever.  We get seated not long after.  Server comes and introduces herself fairly quickly and asks for drink orders.  My husband and I both order a beer and our son, a soda.  We also order mozzarella sticks.  She brings the drinks and asks if we're ready to order.  We would've liked to enjoy our appetizer first but we order.  I inform her that I have a severe tomato allergy to which she replies ""I'll make a note of that"".  Ordered the special...Rib Eye and parmesan shrimp.  It comes with a salad and pizooki.  Salads come out...no sign of the mozarella sticks.  Salad has tomato.  She looked genuinely shocked when my husband points this out.  Not in a ""Oh crap I'm so sorry"" shocked but an ""Oh crap I forgot to note it"" shocked.  Whatever...it happens.  Mozzarella sticks finally come out...ice cold.  Dinner comes out.  My parmesan shrimp is covered in tomato...which is spilling onto the steak.  Again, when pointed out our server seemed highly annoyed and says ""um, don't eat it.  Do you want fried shrimp instead?""  I'm cool with that and say sure.  Never offered to replace the steak.  Whatever.  We're finished and ask for boxes.  She brings those and basically throws them and the check on the table.  Pizzoki never comes and frankly by this time, I am done.  Not only were we charged for my meal but also charged for the extra shrimp she brought out.  Really?  I hate confrontation so did not speak to a manager.  I may one day give them another chance."
C R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,13,1,1.0,11/8/2015,"BJs is a restaurant that traditionally caters to large and small groups alike. Tonight was a gathering of three families after a cheerleading performance - we were a party of 10. Unfortunately, this outing became what I am calling the tale of the ""Table of Fail"". This was the trifecta of food, drink and service fail. It begins by being seated without menus, napkins and utensils. Iced tea served without sweeteners. Drinks ordered from the bar that were never delivered (cause was that our waitress was new and didn't know to enter bar orders into their system). When the drinks finally arrived, after 45 minutes, they tasted terrible. Lack of follow up left the table without soft drink refills for an eternity. Food orders arrived after an unusually long wait, but not all at once. Orders arrived in 4 waves and some orders were incomplete. Fries delivered on only one kids meal, while the other kids had to wait longer for theirs. No ketchup on the table and none brought with the fries. Three guests ordered deep dish pizzas, none of them had more than a mere suggestion of pizza sauce on them, rendering them dry and tasteless. Of the 10 meals ordered, only 2 of them were correct and edible. At one point, one of our party actively got up from the table to find a manager to clue him in on the activities at the ""Table of Fail"". Fernando the manager pledged to address the issues, but the service actually worsened after his intervention. Later, when we got him to the table, he proceeded to throw the waitress under the bus by saying she did not alert him to how bad things were going at our table. We reminded him that we told him personally how bad it was. It took a few minutes of vigorous debate for Fernando to just erase the bill entirely.  It's over 2 hours of our lives we'd like to get back. Going forward, BJs will be cast to the lowest level of regard for another visit. Advice to others is to severely lower their expectations of food, drink and service levels. Allow for an eternity. I hope others experience better."
Michelle S.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",4,36,8,3.0,11/24/2014,"Service in bar was wonderful, special requests were performed with a smile. Manager visible on floor was super attentive.  Restroom was HORRIFIC. As a server, I almost wanted to perform the restroom check myself. Cleanliness is an impression you cannot afford to miss."
Ginger P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,153,14,4.0,1/19/2014,"Things are looking up here.  We both had the bison burgers and they were delicious.  Hard to believe this is a low-cal, low-fat dinner!  The meat was seasoned perfectly.  The slaw on the side was zesty as well - so we did not miss the fries....much. We had a terrific server who stayed on top of our beverages and kept things moving without making us feel rushed.   Had a similar experience a couple weeks earlier. Excellent Thai lettuce shrimp wraps!So good and under 500 calories.  The flavors were spot on.  Service good too. So, maybe they have a new manager or they are paying more attention to their service.  Things are definitely much better. We're fans again. We'll be back."
Ivan P.,"Valencia, CA",45,102,4,3.0,2/10/2016,"This place is somewhat hit or miss for me. When I go with a large group of more than 10 people, the food is great. Possibly because all we get is the pizzas. When I go with my gf to have a nice quiet Sunday lunch, the food is always subpar. The service is ok and the location is actually quite nice if you sit down outside so you can people watch while you eat. My recommendation is to come here for a nice sit down pizza place with some decent beer. Other than that, it's just OK."
Andrew L.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1100,178,145,1.0,9/29/2015,BJ's in Valencia continues to go further downhill.  Service is terrible. Staff deliver food to the wrong table. Food takes forever and is not that good.
Joey M.,"Canyon Country, CA",145,19,1,4.0,3/29/2016,"Bj's is a pretty good place its not like the food is fantastic but i like that they have a wide variety of things to try, I think their pasta dishes are the best things they have but the ahi poke is also pretty tasty for a starter."
Louis S.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,14,2,1.0,8/1/2013,Terrible service!! One main course dish came out 10 mins early.  The waitress was over worked and was not able to be attentive. Then the desserts were not cooked properly.  I spoke with the manager and he simply didn't care. This floors were also dirty and our table was not clean. This is quite possibly the worst restaurant in the area. AVOID!
J B.,"Valencia, CA",0,4,,4.0,4/16/2016,"I would give this place 5 stars but they lack in service... There food is amazing but there service sucks. They either never have enough people working or they are just slow. Every single time I go there to eat, the food takes forever to come out or they bring the dinner first before the appetizer. (If you order one)  The girls and some of the guys are friendly in the front but they always seem like they don't care about the customers.  Other then that...the food is great!"
Judiosonly G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,,1.0,9/10/2016,"We had a nice waitress and things were cool in the beginning. We were out celebrating and service just went downhill. Another server brought some of the dishes over and we were calling out to our table, but he still managed to give our dishes to the next table. One guy started playing with it so I switched my sirloin to a ribeye so that I knew they didn't give me the same dish. I also ate my dinner alone which was kind of shitty. I didn't get any kind of apology and I know it wasn't the waitress who messed up, but the other server didn't say anything to fix the problem. I have always been a fan of BJ'S and we always come here and order in from here but the level of customer service has decreased. I don't know if it's training or new employees, but you may want to pick another place besides BJs."
Elizabeth Y.,"Honolulu, HI",0,2,,1.0,10/3/2016,Terrible service. Had to wait 20 minutes for a table even though restaurant was empty. Out of most specialty sodas. Boneless wings had to be returned because they were too salty. A simple cheese pizza was incorrect and had a long wait for food. Resturant wasn't even busy. Took 4 tries to get the check correct. Actually had to go into the kitchen to find the manager. Stay away.
Anali C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,50,,2.0,11/3/2015,"Two stars because there are some decent items on the menu. However, their prices are too high for the quality of food that they offer. Also, their service is absolutely horrible. Every single time we visit, we experience the worst service that makes us wonder why we even return in the first place. The worst part is they get away with it because they're a chain restaurant.  This place isn't worth your money. End of story."
Danny V.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,36,14,1.0,8/31/2014,"Decided to go here earlier this afternoon with my girl to have appetizers and a couple of beers before going home. We dropped in were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was very blah with us and was not very informative or courteous about our questions we had about the food that we were ordering. We ordered 10 boneless wings, artichoke dip, and a flatbread pizza. We waited for a very long time like almost a half hour for our appetizer, FOR APPETIZERS PEOPLE! So besides the poor customer service, you have to wait a long time for food.  One the food came, I was shocked to see that our wings were tiny in size, like one of the ""ten"" pieces was the size of a nickel, no joke. The artichoke dip was bland, nothing special, and the flatbread pizza was mediocre at best. We didn't get offered refills on our beer until we were done eating. At this point I was done with this place. Management needs to step it up and learn how to train their staff to be a bit more friendly and lively. I will not be returning at all. Over all cost for 2 draft beers, 10 tiny pieces of boneless chicken wings, artichoke dip, flatbread pizza was $50! Definitely not worth the money at all."
Conor B.,"Chatsworth, CA",163,1350,106,4.0,8/19/2013,"I've been here twice and both times it has been a great experience. Even with a large group. The restaurant it kept very clean which is great. The waiters are also very friendly and personable. Not to mention, they're very patient when the group is a bit disorganized when it comes to ordering.  However, sometimes it can take a bit for orders to come out. But then again, that I guess should be expected when you have a larger table."
Amy M.,"Granada Hills, CA",3,63,47,2.0,10/9/2015,The reason why I left two stars is because the waiter was rude the hostess who set us down was very rude sure to get a table for six people she got us a table for two people she expected us to share a table also the food came out cold one of the food came out late they had the whole thing wrong waiters are very slow I'm very unsatisfied for a chain restaurant to be like this
Kyle S.,"Los Angeles, CA",243,2,,5.0,5/30/2016,"I've been coming to BJs since I was a kid and absolutely hands down have the best service every time, and the quality service is only bested by its delicious food. The interior of the restaurant is constantly improving and the bar has become one of the best looking bars in the area with excellent servers like Stevie, I definitely enjoy my Friday nights at the bar, my Sunday lunches with the family, and my late night pazzookies. I am always greeted by the excellent manager Fernando and the great team they have built here, I will continue coming to this restaurant and look forward to seeing the continuous growth. Thank you BJs for all the great meals"
Claudia E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,14,,1.0,4/16/2015,"We are usually fans of the BJ restaurants, we enjoy the lunch specials they offer. This location however, does not provide good customer service. It has been a negative experience more often than not, unfortunately.  Either the server doesn't know the new changes to the menu and the manager will make excuses for that. Which was the case for our last visit. So instead of the food arriving as ordered it was prepared on the wrong bread and had mayo. The waitress did not return to see if we needed drink refills or if the meal was fine, so by the time she came for the check, the food was cold and we were not in the mood to wait for another meal.  We love the deep dish pizza and pizookie so maybe if you place an order for pick up, you can avoid the lack of customer service."
Laryssah P.,"Valencia, CA",49,17,,1.0,12/11/2015,"Let me just say that the hostess is extremely rude here. I called before arriving and was quoted 20-25 minutes, with which I asked them to put my name down, but upon arrival I was told 45 minutes and that the wait time had started upon arrival. That made absolutely no sense seeing as everywhere else you go it's when you have your name down on the list. The hostess kept telling me I was wrong and didn't even care that we were mid informed or tried to provide any form of customer service. I had not been to BJ's in a little while but given it was such a negative experience, just by walking in the front door, I won't be back."
