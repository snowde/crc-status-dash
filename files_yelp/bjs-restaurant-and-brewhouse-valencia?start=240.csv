Marivy M.,"Canyon Country, CA",2,3,,2.0,4/4/2016,I enjoy coming to Bj's environment is great.  Except I came in for my boyfriend's birthday made a reservation around 3pm for 8pm of 10-13 people. When we arrive at 8pm with a reservation they tell me there is no reservation!! Having all of us waiting in the hall for 30 minutes until we got seated. What was the point for a reservation?! Was so disappointed how unorganized they were I would have gave a 4 star.
Chris M.,"Valencia, CA",50,171,91,3.0,11/13/2015,"Ordered takeout for dinner tonight & wanted to give BJ's a try. The location was a bit hidden next to Larsens Steakhouse.  The deepdish pizza was okay, not quite what I expected.  My wife had the Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich, which she said was fairly average in taste.  We also ordered BJ's Baked Beignet for desert. I noticed when I got home that the desert lacked the syrup sauce that the picture showed it having. All I really had was tree Beignet, the icecream & the cherries I ordered.  So needless to say the desert was a disappointment. For my first time trying BJ's I was not really impressed."
Jeff S.,"Artesia, CA",586,18,76,1.0,7/18/2014,"The food was fine, similar quality to other BJs Restaurants, but the service here is unbelievably slow.  I have been here three times for lunch and every single time, the service has been absolutely terrible. The first time I went with a group of coworkers on our lunch break, which is about one hour, a fairly reasonable amount of time for us to order and get our food. It took a while for the waiter to come even get our drinks, then after we finished ordering, we waited about 25 minutes before asking where our food was. We got some of our food in another 10 to 15 minutes, then the waiter told us he didn't know where the rest of our food was and he would make sure they get started on cooking it right away. This was already past 45 minutes into our lunch break and we had to get back for a meeting. They ended up charging us for the food that did arrive, but we couldn't wait for them to get us our food. We had to leave someone there to pick up the rest of our food, which was on the house (as it should have been), and which they packaged to go. Turns out, it took them another 25 minutes to get all the food out and packed. Ridiculous, but we hoped it was just a freak day. The next time I went during lunch, we ordered our drinks right away, then waited 15 minutes for the drinks to come out and to order. We ordered our food finally, but the food did not come out for 30 minutes. All we ordered were a couple of salads, one small pizza, one burger, and one jambalaya. The pizza and burger weren't even that hot. Needless to say, since it was past 45 minutes, we were only able to eat a couple of bites before we had to leave. It took forever for our waiter to come give us our check, collect our check, and we got refills just once throughout the whole experience. The third and final time I came here for lunch, my coworkers and I decided to order ahead online to save time. We ordered one salad and one large pizza and one strawberry lemonade. We arrived when we said we would, were seated, and the waiter told us that if we ordered online, the food would start to cook as soon as we arrived and should be out soon, within 15 minutes. We thought that this would be a great experience that would redeem the previous two experiences.  We were so wrong. It took the waiter 15 minutes to get us waters and my one strawberry lemonade. Then it took another extra 15 minutes for the pizza to come out, not piping hot. In total, it took over 30 minutes from when we sat down for the food, which we had ordered online, to come to our table, not even hot.  We luckily had enough time to eat our fill of the food, and even managed to get one refill on the strawberry lemonade, which came out faster than the original strawberry lemonade did.  I asked for the check, but it was taking a long time (eventually took him 10 minutes to get the check to me), so I decided to pay online and tip low for the excruciatingly slow service. I asked also for a box for the left over food and that also took 10 minutes to come out.  All in all, I barely got back in time, and my coworkers and I vowed never to go back to that BJs ever again. Also, I must mention the cleanliness of the utensils. This was mentioned in another review here, but I wanted to reiterate that diners at this BJ's location should CHECK YOUR UTENSILS BEFORE EATING. Luckily, I checked my utensils, and found that the fork was filthy, with crusted food left behind from something. I went through three DIRTY sets of utensils before finally finding one set that was clean. I took pictures of one of them, which I will try to upload onto Yelp. It was disgusting, and really made me doubt the cleanliness of the set of utensils I was using, even though they looked clean. WATCH OUT! It breaks my heart that this BJs is so bad. I suspect it might be that they are understaffed or the waiters are undertrained. It's also possible that the layout of the restaurant is such that it takes a long time for them to get to customers, but I guarantee that we were not the only customers who were not happy. During my third visit, I saw the people at a table next to me send back two dishes they had just received.  I personally love pizza and BJs, but I will never come back to this BJs."
Tyler B.,"Castaic, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/4/2017,"Well, seeing as you are reading this review, you probably want to know how BJ's is, before you go there.  That's why I'm here.  As a local of Santa Clarita Valley, I like to believe I know where the good spots in town are.  BJ's and their lovely staff have continuously excelled in their service to our community.  Today, I write to share my experience with my lovely server, Melinda.  Because the establishment is so fine, there may be a wait to be seated, especially on a Saturday night.  After a relatively short wait, I was sat down and was greeted by Melinda, who took great care in ensuring I felt at home here.  With such a fantastic smile and engaging attitude, I knew that my time here would be above standard.  Moments later, I was enjoying a fantastic chocolate martini, along with the honey sriracha brusselsprouts.  I implore you, please visit this fine establishment, and hope that Melinda is the one who takes care of you.  You will not regret it!"
McKenna F.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,164,41,1.0,8/31/2015,"Zero. Zero stars. This BJs is absolutely awful. Growing up in Valencia, I have never once had a good server at BJs. I've never had good food. (Besides the pizookie, but it's a warm cookie with ice cream, how can you mess that up?) Everything tastes like it just came off the truck and was thrown into a fryer to make it warm.  One time I went with my 2 friends. I think we sat in the bar area for a good 15 minutes before anyone came by the table. I ordered a vodka tonic. Easy. My go-to is a gin & tonic but I changed it this once. He brings it out, much later, and it's probably a dash of vodka and all gin. I hateeee sending things back. But I was gonna pay extra money for this drink, and a good waiter would take it back without blinking. It took him a good TWENTY minutes to even appear, and by this time we all decided to chance our food order and go to Lazy Dog.  He comes back around and I mentioned to him that my drink tasted like there was no vodka in it. The server looked at me, looked at my drink, grabbed it and walked away. Went over to the bartender and maybe 3 or 4 other servers and proceeded to have them smell it. All of them. Pointed at me and kept smelling it. The bartender dramatically threw it out and made another one. Guess what I got this time? Vodka, no tonic. I cannot stand their attitudes there. They're extremely rude and service is awful. Whenever my friends say ""let's go to BJs"" I convince them out of it. Never."
Amber ..,"Saugus, CA",0,34,9,1.0,1/13/2017,"Went in with a party of sixteen for a birthday and the service was HORRIBLE. Our server was rude and wouldn't split the check for us.  He let us know we were his last table and he ""couldn't wait to go home and crash."" We were his only table so I'm not sure why he was missing the entire time. Half  of our table had been servers before, currently serve at a restaurant, or manage at a restaraunt. We know that it could be difficult to split checks but we also know it's possible. Two of the orders were wrong, and most of the food was cold. I was never even brought out my food. The server returned three times to check if I've gotten my food and I never did. I finally told him i no longer even wanted my food, and he asked if I wanted a soup or salad AFTER the table had already finished eating. He brought our bill, gave us a pen, and told us we could split our bill four ways if we wrote on the receipt telling him how to split it. I asked to speak to a manager to let her know that about our experience. She told me that our server lied to her and told her my order was entered as a ""rush order"" because I had gotten there late and ordered after everyone else, when really he had forgotten to put it in. The manager apologized and gave me a gift card. Although this was nice I'm not sure how it makes up for our bill of almost 300.00 of cold food."
Leilany Q.,"Sylmar, CA",1,8,,5.0,2/25/2016,Went on a sister date the other night and I had a blast the atmosphere was great the service was amazing and the food was to die for
Staci P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,26,,2.0,7/8/2014,"Every time I have come here I feel like I tell myself the same thing, ""Never again."" Sadly the service is incredibly slow, the front of the house is non existent, the price points are way off and the food is average. I wish there were more redeeming qualities, but there aren't. There are no prices on the drink menu which is a giant turn off in general and most of the employees do not seem to enjoy their job. I'm a creature of convenience so I'll pay money for good service and good product, but I just feel like this place is a ripoff for what you get. Also, getting separate checks in a bar should not be a difficult thing."
Jack M.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,,3.0,8/24/2016,Food and beers are usually good  but this location is almost always terribly understaffed.   The servers do as good as they can with so many tables but it just seems like they're not able to be everywhere at once. Management needs to step it up...
Denise D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",12,15,,2.0,8/3/2015,"The service here is continuing to improve.  It used to suck.  The food has always been great but tonight, their angel hair Classico tasted like past-a-roni that was over cooked and half the flavor was left out.   Not worth the money I paid for it.  I'll stick to something else next time."
Brenda D.,"Pacoima, CA",131,94,56,5.0,10/30/2015,Came here for a quick bite and drinks with the boyfriend. I usually order the BJ's favorite pizza (delicious btw) but i wanted to change it up. I ordered a bison burger and oh my god...so freaking yummy. Our waiter and service was great and the drinks were awesome too. Love the huge tv's and how big it is inside. definitely recommend.
Kimberly Cameron V.,"Canoga Park, CA",66,180,29,4.0,7/22/2013,"Kim Cameron, Valencia, CA Cajun Shrimp Pasta - BOMB!! Loved it!!! I am usually happy with my food at BJ's, but not always (hence the 4/5 stars). For example, my friend ordered the NY Steak and it was a little too fatty for his taste. I will definitely be going back for that shrimp pasta though!!!! Yummmmmy! And the Pizookies are amazing!!!!"
Beneficence N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,37,10,4.0,11/29/2015,"I don't have anything bad to say. I went here, the service was great. We had a male waiter. He was maybe in his 40's great waiter. & the food was good too. .. I see all the bad reviews & I can't relate!"
Alex H.,"Valencia, CA",118,115,179,5.0,2/2/2015,I love the bar at Bjs the bartender john Galicia is the man!  Make you sure you sit at the bar for the best service! Mmmm the best blondes too
Karen F.,"Valencia, CA",21,5,,1.0,8/13/2016,"Sat. Aug. 13th, my husband and I decided to try BJ's AGAIN, for dinner.We thought after the last time about 8-9 months ago, maybe things would change. Wishful thinking, no changed, just worse than the last visit. Our waitress, I believe her name is Danielle, was quite busy, but she tried. We ordered a very simple meal, my husband asked for a Turkey Burger, with only tomato, raw onion only, and dry, I ordered a simple Wedge Salad, with Ranch Dressing, tomato, and bacon. Well, now after waiting, 25 minutes to get a table, we waited  almost 40 minutes for our food. She did tell us after awhile, that they were very busy. Well we finally got our order, and it was not good at all. My husband's Turkey Burger, was  very dried out, with an awful dry roll, no tomato, and my wedge salad, had a drop of dressing, could not find the bacon, and it was on a plate, that when I tried to cut it up, was falling off the plate. We asked the waitress to please bring some more dressing and bacon, and tomatoes for my husbands burger, what does she do, goes and take an order from a nearby table of 4. We were able to flag down the Manager on duty, did not get his name, kinda tall stocky man, told him our problem, he went got the plate, dressing and a ramekin with practically raw bacon. Told our server, manage did not return, and we told the waitress , she said do not worry about it, and we did not get a bill. For sure I will never go back, they do not have a good track record with us."
Tracy M.,"Valencia, CA",9,31,9,2.0,11/19/2015,This location is ridiculous! This is the second time we have ordered from them and again our pick up order was messed up! It really can't be that hard to follow instructions when someone places an order. Will not be returning!
Teresa G.,"Benicia, CA",35,34,50,4.0,7/21/2015,We came in at about 10PM on a Sunday night. The service was good. We had a very attentive waiter to which I did not get his name. The food was just ok. The calamari was way too 'crispy' and didn't even take up half the serving dish. I should've taken a pic of that. The pizza was good and the S'more Pizooki was great as usual!
Len R.,"Port Hueneme, CA",45,22,,1.0,4/11/2015,"We ordered 2 orders of blacken shrimp tacos.  One was to be mild and one extra hot.  They arrived and the server had no idea which was which.   Tomato bisque came cold not once, but TWICE.  First time it came without a spoon.  Deep dish pizza was gooey and I found out it comes frozen with the sauce already on the pizza.   The sauce migrates to the dough and it's gooey. Never offered to refill the water or the soda. We only went back as the last time we went they ran out of baked potatoes and the food was not hot and they send us a ""gift card"". I give them credit for being able to offer poor food & poor service and people come back."
Kenneth H.,"Clermont, FL",21,5,,5.0,2/7/2016,Had lunch here Friday with my good friend! Best clam chowder anywhere!! Had the all you can eat soup and salad lunch for $8.25. Really can't beat this deal! Great service and not stingy with refills!!
Richard V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,11,,4.0,8/9/2016,"I have been to this chain many times in my life and it is one of the few chain restaurants that I really enjoy. The prices aren't too bad, the food is pretty good and the service is pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the beer, but some of it is alright. The pizookis are great and I love hosting parties here. Much better and cheaper than Cheesecake Factory, which I would say is its closest comparison that I can think of."
