Pamela V.,"Canyon Country, CA",85,49,2,2.0,4/30/2014,"I was here on april 28th, 2014.. my birthday... went last year.. went this year, hopefully won't go again for my birthday. First off, we got sat in an aisle with a large group which they handled well when we asked to move, but we ended up with a very snotty server, who spent the entire evening cutting people off.. when i asked for a straw for my chilled glass i was informed that it's not supposed to have one but he will get me one and i was  handed a bright orange child flexy straw...and it gets better! So food comes and some of it's cold, like my fries? cold.. my burger is warm so i deal. Other people mention that some of their stuff was cold, obviously the server was waiting on something.. ok ok.. not his fault.. we move on. Towards the end of the meal, we decide to get desserts to go, the triple chocolate pazookie was why we went anyways.. i eat one every year or i did. my friend informs the server all the desserts are to go but he's already trying to take orders.. so she says it again and he turns to her and goes ""yes,. i heard you"" in a tone that even i was thinking ""wtf""... so we give our orders.. and it gets handles.. but... it... gets... better.... because that wasn't bad.. that was like 3 stars, maybe 4 still..... but we get home and people start complaining about the desserts being undercooked.. one of the Beignets. is over cooked.. one is slighty under.. and one is raw.. not undercooked.. raw. We have photos.. it's dough.  We played with it, we made a video and i think someone posted it.. ill post photos if people want to see them. and my triple chocolate pazookie was cookie dough still.. but it was ok. So they call the restaurant and let them know, not because we wanted a free meal but because they should know things aren't coming out of the kitchen correct and what does the manager tell us? Your friend should be fine. yes we know.. she should be fine.. umm that's not just the point? It took a couple minutes of declining to have them drive another Beignet to us, (the first one was raw, why would we want another?)...before it was even acknowledged that maybe the kitchen was having a problem and even then, nobody was happy. Happy birthday to me i guess? i'm the one that wanted to come here. At least the rest of my party was good."
MT R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,16,5,2.0,6/12/2016,"Sitting for 15 minutes and only got water from our waitress after I went to the hostess station.  Now it's been over 40 minutes and our food is nowhere to be seen, no refill on a simple coke and no waitress either.  Not coming back."
C. C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",9,154,13,1.0,11/3/2015,"The service was so incredibly bad from the moment we walked in the door, we never sat down to eat. We waited at the front, at 11:50am for nearly 15 minutes... with workers standing there right in front of us. Not ONE person greeted us or asked if we had been helped. At first we thought it was sort of amusing but after a few minutes, we realized how little we mattered to the staff that were there. They (all three) were standing around, making jokes and putting more energy in their goofing around rather than seating the patrons that came in. The manager at this restaurant obviously doesn't know what they are doing because this place has had terrible service for years, if you read the yelp reviews you will see this is a trend for this place, yet no one at the corporate office thinks it is important to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!  It is this type of establishment that makes Santa Clarita a joke on the food map in So Cal. Everyone outside the community says ""What is wrong with SCV? you have tons of money out there, but you have no good places to eat!"" It's because we continue to support CRAPPY chains like this! People, STOP eating here and they will go. Look at TGIF's... took a while but now maybe we might get a good place there for once!  I refuse to go to this place again, ever. Even if it's a work function, I will pass. I need to stand up for what is right and AGAINST what is so very wrong.  -Signed... sick and tired of it!"
Yelp D.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4,24,4,3.0,8/2/2014,"If you're going to eat after watching a movie at the theatre, this is the place to be (sometimes). The pizza is good and the place is really slick. Always bring your friends and try coming here to watch the game (lots of TVs). Since I'm a doge I can't drink or wait in line for a long time, so this isn't really my most favorite place. The wait on Friday nights reminds me of a Michael Bay movie because you never know when it's going to end. This place is sometimes worth it but I think you're better off going across the street to Lazy Doge.  ~Yelp Doge~"
Matt S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,8,,2.0,12/27/2015,"Wow - bad bad.  Took the family here for brunch and it was horrible.  We've enjoyed this place before but DONT GO FOR BRUNCH.  Manager comped half our meal (8 people) and we ate less than half.  Sangria was so sweet it was undrinkable.  Cold food brought out in 3 waves 5 minutes apart:  so cold it was inedible.  Rubbery sausage, soggy scrambled eggs, over cooked omelette, excluded cilantro came with tacos anyway. Worst part was that the food was so late and terrible that it literally brought our family celebration to a screeching halt.  It was so awkwardly bad.  Like a fart in church."
Amy B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,14,1,1.0,11/16/2015,"I don't know what happened to this place.  Food is normally good but service is going downhill. Had a terrible server while sitting on the patio.  Everything came late. Drinks, Appz, Food (one entrée never actually showed) EVERYTHING! The manager came over to apologize, said he would make adjustments to our bill and never returned.  It was like something out of the twilight zone. We were starting to wonder if we were on hidden camera. Not sure why they can't get it together anymore."
Emily C.,"Burbank, CA",19,41,19,1.0,11/10/2015,"Worst food I've ever pay for. Very very slow service, it took them forever to serve our food. How is this place having customers ??? Never again.. The one start is on the Pinot Grigio."
Yamilette C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,7,,4.0,10/30/2015,I am fan of this place i love their atlantic salmon the staff is very friendly always have my food ready on time! I recommend this plate to anyone to likes salmon make sure if u do its grilled !
Georgina T.,"Glendale, CA",5,20,6,4.0,6/27/2014,"I went to bjs yesterday and had a great time!  I sat at the bar with my friend first and Amber and Tim were very attentive and were knowledgable of the drink menu. Amber helped me pick out the Strawberry splash, a perfect summer drink. So then my buzzer went off and I was seated. My server, Sheila, was so sweet and recommended an appetizer and the chicken parmesian. The food was just great.  Everything was wonderful. Excellent customer service!"
Krysta A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/13/2017,"I ordered online prior to opening. ---Side note: I've worked at a restaurant for 7 years so I understand there's a lot of prep in the morning, but nonetheless, we have always managed to get guests online orders prepared right on time, even prior to opening. (Mind you my restaurant location is right next to many production studios so we had 15-20 person orders to fulfill prior to opening on a regular basis). ---I even lagged walking in to pick up my food around 10 mins because I knew my food wouldn't be ready on time. The two stars is for being greeted and offered water although I declined. The dirty floor rugs were placed on the waiting area seats and the host removed them so I could sit. (But I know how dirty those rugs were and I was not about to sit on those seats, especially since she didn't bother to wipe off all the dirt and dust they left over). As I waited for an additional 15 minutes one of the male employees kept talking to the host about some personal issues and sprinkled in a ton of curse words all while I was standing right in front of them. We're all humans and we all go through issues, but be mindful of the place and time you choose to comfortably lay your problems and curse words all over the table. My food finally came out, and me having worked at a restaurant for so long, I still managed to leave a tip which I'm regretting. Please, work on management and order process. The online order aspect in this case was pretty much useless."
M C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,3,1.0,10/24/2015,Food took forever. Never got checked on. Server was super slow and not helpful. Worst service I've ever gotten at this place.
Allie F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,42,1,2.0,1/13/2016,"Although the food is pretty good, the service here is very inconsistent. We have gone to BJs and had pretty decent service and then have gone to where the waiter/waitress was MIA the entire meal! We have had very friendly waiters/waitresses and then had very rude waiters/waitresses. It's very hot and cold! The only reason we keep coming back is because it's great if you want to watch a game and chill but don't expect much out of their servers!"
Sheri R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",15,45,12,5.0,7/12/2015,"Business lunch with Teresa C. as our waitress---Teresa was attentive and cheerful, even though we sat there for almost her entire shift!"
Angelica R.,"San Fernando, Los Angeles, CA",3,111,38,2.0,10/11/2015,What's terrible customer service this business has. I honestly wouldn't come and give them my time or money again. The girl was awfully rude and her excuse was that she was having a bad day. Well it's not our fault. It was suppose to be a nice family dinner but honestly it was a disappointment. The food was not even good. Everything was wrong. Supper slow business never again.
Shane H.,"Bakersfield, CA",22,44,13,5.0,8/11/2014,"Came here for a Saturday lunch. Was seated promptly and serviced just as fast. The food was good too. I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta dish and split spring rolls with a friend. AND THE PIZOOKIES. If you get nothing else while here, get a Pizookie. Any of them. Our waiter was also really helpful.  Good service and good food!"
Robert D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,48,,1.0,3/18/2014,OMG!! What is up with the sub size portions? I would have checked into Jenny Craig if I wanted to lose weight.  If management thinks they can get away with this approach they just lost the business of five adults who visited this place last night.  The service was sub par.  Even the waiter mentioned that they got a 'new thing' going on.   I ordered a bison burger and it came as it they pulled it out of the frozen section of   Vons supermarket.  No flavor and the side was ridiculous. I do not know what was supposed to come with but definitely not something I should expect from this outfit.  Rest of the family felt the same way about their food. We got the check before we got our desert- go figure? Came hungry left hungry.  This does not deserve a one star  but a F-  Worst  $80 we ever spent.
Sarah S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",88,46,13,2.0,3/10/2012,"Let me start by saying that the food is great, which is the only reason I gave them any stars at all.  If I was scoring on service alone I would given the lowest score possible.  I've eaten at BJ's in Santa Clarita enough times to say that the service is consistently horrible.  I've finally come to the conclusion that even though the food is fantastic it's not worth eating there because of the service.  I've gone on a busy Saturday night and on a weekday during lunch.  It doesn't matter when you go, the bad service is consistent.  I feel that it is safe to say that BJ's in Santa Clarita has the worst service at any restaurant in Santa Clarita, or anywhere for that matter.  I want to note that this is specific to Santa Clarita because the one in Burbank has great service.   The waiters/waitresses and managers are typically unfriendly and on occasion rude.  I can't think of a time where they've brought my food out in a timely manner.  Every time I've gone there someone in my party's food is not delivered with everyone else's.  I've been served cold food numerous times or the wrong order.  Usually they don't refill your drinks.  The bartenders are usually friendly; however it's impossible to order anything even when you are sitting right in front of them.  I could go on and on.  I am surprised that corporate hasn't come in and regulated on management to fix their service problem. On the upside, the food is great.  Pizzoki's are probably the best dessert ever, their deep dish pizza has a really great flavor, their skinny french fries are yummy, and they have healthy options.  I think you're safe ordering anything off the menu and you won't be disappointed (with the food that is and as long as it is hot).   I suggest going to BJ's in Burbank if you want to try the food and going someplace else around the mall for location.  The Tilted Kilt is less than a block from BJ's and they have great service and food.  Lazy Dog (other side of the mall) has a similar atmosphere to BJ's with great food and service."
Samantha F.,"Canyon Country, CA",77,18,16,2.0,9/19/2015,"It took us from 8:30pm till 11:00pm to get everything. We missed half of one of our orders, the pazooki came out cold and took almost 25 mins to come out. A friend joined us for beer and it took 10 mins for his beer and shot. Ridiculously slow and they weren't busy enough to have that kind of wait."
Dustin C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",246,19,20,5.0,5/27/2015,"Always a fun environment, amazing food, a great team of servers!  Pay no attention to the negative reviews, service can at times be a little slow because these servers have HUGE sections.  9 to 10 table sections on average. Watch some games, have some amazing beers, awesome food, pizookie to cap things off, you can't go wrong!"
Nicole B.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,4,,2.0,9/13/2015,"Service will kill any restaurant. This BJ'S has bad bad service. Doesn't matter if the food is good, when the service is poor!"
