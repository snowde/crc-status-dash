Alexandra A.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,20,13,5.0,7/26/2015,Love the incitement an food! First time here but will definitely will be back an recommend to anyone!!
Jonathan R.,"Valencia, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/24/2016,Waited for 20 min after being seated for the server to approach us and take our drink order. No apologies behaved  as if it was business as usual. When we were giving her our order another server approaches our waiter and talks to her for a few min. She then turns to us without an apology for the interruption. Horrible customer service.
Alanna W.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,4,1,1.0,10/18/2015,"Mediocre food and terrible service! Second time in a row I have experienced the same problem at this location. We came tonight for dinner around 4 the restaurant was half empty and seemed pretty slow. We got sat right away but had to get moved twice because we couldn't see the game. We let our server, a young blonde, know we were moving over 2 tables over and her response was that she couldn't help us anymore. We informed another server that we hadn't been helped yet and he asked the blonde to help us and she refused again. 10 minutes later we finally get greeted by a dark haired waitress and she takes our drink order but says she will not be our server. Another 15 minutes go by and we still have no drinks, the manager comes by and apologizes for the confusion and takes our drink order again. We finally get our drinks 10 minutes after that and a server who didn't seem to care much that we had now been waiting 45 minutes just to get our drinks. We had to ask twice for silverware they forgot to bring. The food took another 35 minutes. The manager did not come back to check on us. We will not be back to this location. There's plenty of other restaurants in their area they really need to step it up."
Joey P.,"Valencia, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/30/2015,"Went in on Saturday 11/28 for my mom's birthday, server told us we were his only table and he would take great care of us. Things they no longer serve are still on the menu and when my brother ordered one of them, waiter came back  10 minutes later only to tell him they no longer have said item. Recommended something else and that was sent back. All food came out except for my order which he totally forgot to even punch in the system. Whole night was a mess with several orders being sent back or not even being brought out at all. Should have been way more on top of it especially since we were his only table. Depressing way to end my mom's bday. Won't be going back."
C H.,"NEWHALL, CA",6,56,,1.0,5/6/2014,"Last visit was in late April. It might be my last ever. I was always willing to give this place my business, sometimes because of lack of choice at the mall area. Past experiences would have to rate 3 to 4 stars. Not any more. Last two visits have been mediocre at best. Slow service with a bad attitude, cold food, undercooked desserts (difficult to do I know, but somehow they find a way). Corporate needs to get this location back on track. It's gone downhill since the other ""shops"" locations opened. Lucille's, Lazy Dog and Wokano offer better food, service and value. BJ's could and should be a competitor. Corporate...are you listening??"
Leroy L.,"North Hills, CA",110,11,,1.0,3/20/2014,"I wish I had gone to Carls Jr or McDonalds. The food was not any better than any fast-food restaurant. Our food came out at different times. At least 15 minutes apart. By the time the last person got their food, half of the party finished their meal. Had to ask the waiter for the bacon and ranch dressing that was suppose to come with a meal. The pizza came out cold. The salad looked and tasted like it came from a Ready-to-eat bag from the supermarket. So unbelievably horrible horrible experience. Nothing redeeming from the whole experience. We had so many issues, one of us did not even bother eating and boxed their dinner instead. Horrible experience. Avoid this place like the plague. Addendum: Wow! And they messed up our bill. Couldn't find the manager to correct it so the waiter just crossed out what was wrong with a pen. Agh! I'm so pissed. Addendum 2: There was a bill in our party that was around $90 and was suppose to be split. Instead they charged each person $90. WTH?"
Charlene C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1498,929,5247,1.0,12/28/2011,"1st Experience: 11/25/11 = Pleasant  Four orders of Unlimited Soup & Salad lunch special Male server was very friendly and on top of things.  In and out in less than 40 minutes  Husband had at least 5 bowls of soup and 2 salads.   At first I was kind of surprised with the low ratings... but NOW I know why. ============================================= TODAY I came with the same group of people and it was our 2nd time dining in at this particular BJs together. We left very unsatisfied and still hungry!   Checked in at 11:10am  Checked out at 12:08pm IN A NUTSHELL:  ============================================== SLOW service. We pretty much sat there for ONE HOUR and all we got was 3 small salads and a flat bread pizza. Clam chowder was COLD and chicken noodle soup had HAIR in it. The Unlimited Soup & Salad... turned out to be LIMITED SALAD & NO SOUP! LONG STORY:  ============================================== This is what occurred during this unpleasant hour... Host greeted us right away & sat us down. 2 other parties in the entire restaurant at this time. ORDERED: Three orders of unlimited soup and salad and one order of flat bread pizza. (Party of 4) 12 minutes of waiting until the first salad came out. Caesar salads were pretty bare and needed more dressing. (We all had the phones out and were keeping track of the time) After everyone ate their salads, we all sat there for 25 minutes staring at each other. Where is the soup? Can we get another round of salads?? During this whole time, we never saw our female server, ""B_____t"". She basically took our drink orders and disappeared. The only time she resurfaced when we were all sitting there with no food on the table and took the empty salad plates away. At this point, my meal didn't even come out yet.  I just sat there for a good 40 minutes with no food. Another party sat next to us and they received all their food before we did. My 1/2 flat bread pizza came out at 11:50am, which I scarfed down. (I was hungry at this point) When we got our first round of soup, my husband's clam chowder was cold. He asked the food runner if he could take it back and bring a hot bowl of soup and another salad (WHICH NEVER CAME OUT). My sister only ate a few spoonfuls before finding  a hair in her chicken noodle soup.   We just wanted to get out of there and go somewhere else to eat. This was taking WAY TOO LONG for soup & salad. (The last time we were here, it was a lot busier and we were in and out pretty quick). My husband told her, he wanted to cancel his order and informed her about the hair in my sister's soup. Our female server told us she was going to get the manager.  WAITING...... WAITING......... No one ever came to our table. She just dropped off our bill and ran away without saying a word.  At this point, the husband had to take the jacket off..... We had to go to the front desk to ask for the manager, because we shouldn't have to pay the full price if all they ate were 3 small salads.  Other than me, everyone else was still hungry! Called the manager and without eye contact  to any of us, he took the other meals off the bill, we only paid for drinks and the flat bread pizza.  *****We ended up across the street to eat at CHIPOTLE!!!!!*****   CONCLUSION: ========================================= I'm a regular customer at the BJ's in Montebello & Arcadia and have never had service this bad before. Sorry, I love BJ's, but won't be back to THIS one after this experience."
Jordan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,19,15,3.0,2/2/2014,"Luxurious and spacious, this brewhouse stall made me feel as if I was in a far away land. The warm golden stone wall decor makes one think of ancient Egypt, and concocts imaginary images of exploring and defecating in King Tut's tomb. I hadn't had this much fun since I rented National Treasure on DVD starring Nicholas Cage in 2004."
D R.,"Valencia, CA",0,1,,4.0,6/15/2016,I'm a regular at this restaurant and my favorite server is Sara. I think her last name is Sheppard. She's always pleasant with a great personality. If you dine there I  definitely recommend asking for her section.
Alejandra P.,"Long Beach, CA",51,34,19,4.0,7/6/2015,"We went to Hurricane Harbor before coming here, so we arrived around 4:30pm on a Thursday. It wasn't busy and they sat us right away. We got a section all to ourselves. The waitress was really nice and everything started off quick. Only problem which to me it was like -_- i hate being sat really close to other people, if its super busy and packed then i have to deal with it but when theres a WHOLE section that is empty and the hostess decides to sit a couple right next to us its like REALLY? -_- but besides that the food was great, the drinks were great and considering that it was just 2 couples the waitress was attending everything went smooth and fine :)"
Magid H.,"Palmdale, CA",15,60,2,2.0,12/15/2013,"Wow were do I start?  Well our waitress did accommodate our table of 12 all having separate tickets even though they have a ""limit"" of 3 separate tickets per table. After some explanation from me the manager agreed. Drink service was so slow it was next to impossible to get any kind of buzz. Food service was also incredibly slow. The fried food was fine. I was hankering for a good pizza so we got a large BJ special and really it was no better than frozen. Maybe worse as it was obvious it had set for awhile before being brought to us as it was almost cold. Had I been paying for the pizza I would have sent it back as most of the toppings were also undercooked.  Lastly I had valeted my car. When I go out to get it the guy ""POINTS""  and says that's where my car is then he stands there expecting a tip for nothing. Not in this lifetime sunshine. You earn a tip you don't expect it."
Brittany S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,5,,1.0,9/14/2015,"Worst service ever!!! Went on a Sunday night, not too many people. Waited 20 minutes. Waited an hour for our food. Wanted the $20 appetizer platter and got half of everything it was supposed to come with. My pizza was undercooked. Called over a manager and he was not understanding. I'll have to sacrifice not having pazookies anymore, never coming back."
Keiran G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",25,2,,1.0,6/5/2016,"Update, we once again came back f9r the pizookis, and we've been waiting 20 min for our drinks with no interaction from the waitress. I'll say it again, the service sucks and the food is okay. Pizookis are their only savior."
Linda K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",30,47,9,5.0,6/13/2015,"This restaurant chain has the best tasting pizza dough EVER!  I LOVE their pizza. I love it so much that although the rest of their menu looks awesome, I rarely order anything else. This particular location has trouble with its young staff regarding customer service, but the manager is attentative and tries to correct the problem. Go for the large pizza and take some home. You will regret it if you don't!"
Eddie C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,103,78,5.0,9/6/2012,"Now I've patroned several different BJ's restaurants over the years and I thought it was pertinent to write a small review regarding this particular BJ's. Whether it be a dinner for 2 or dinner for a large party of over 8, overall BJ's in general is a pretty good place to have dinner.  Good food, good atmosphere, good service. The BJ's in Valencia has consistently been the best BJ's I've ever been to compared to all other BJ's restaurants.  Not sure exactly what it is but it's just a feel good kinda place, no matter what the occasion. I highly recommend it!"
Lexi S.,"Valencia, CA",0,9,93,5.0,9/5/2015,"I love the consistency I receive with the food and drinks here! The other day I came in to use my reward points (they have a special rewards program that tracks how much you spend and rewards you with cash to redeem) and was unable to do so. I ordered the 2 for 25- the food came out quickly, service was great, and everything was delicious. No complaints. I was told my points could not be applied to my bill. I was frustrated because I called ahead to ask ( they have a call ahead list too) and complained to the manager. I filled out the survey they email you after your visit to review your experience. I received a response and all my points back on my card to use when I wish. I appreciate that their team took the time to respond and make me a happy customer! I will return this week to celebrate my birthday! Thank you!"
Julie N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",160,7,4,1.0,11/25/2013,I would never go back to this BJ's. I've been to one before and it wasn't this terrible! It took over an hour to get my burger. The food isn't even that great. The glasses and utensils were not clean and the Pepsi tasted really weird.  Service was so-so.
Dean M.,"Redondo Beach, CA",130,104,6,1.0,11/10/2013,"Worst food I've had at any restaurant in years and the service was crap as well She left empty app plates on our table the entire time we were there even after serving our awful main courses  Speaking of them I asked for a Cobb salad (the only thing I felt they couldn't mess up) with blue cheese dressing and I got a Cobb with NO dressing at all, I'm saying nothing.  My girls burger had so much cayenne pepper on it that it was unedible.  All you tasted was pepper  Shit hole. This is my 3rd bad run with a bjs and I even begged before we went here to go elsewhere but was vetoed.  I will never walk into one of these chains again"
Esther V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",15,37,28,1.0,6/14/2015,"Just had early dinner at BJ's with the family. Not very happy. They took 15 minutes to set our table, and when they finally took us to it, it didn't even have silverware. Our waiter took about 15 mins to even acknowledge us. Then they got our order wrong twice and we got dirty dishes. The food was decent but the service was terrible. Our waiter was trying when he saw me on yelp."
Lara M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2,9,,3.0,6/25/2015,"my GF's & I went here a couple weeks ago and our waiter Brandon was the only saving grace for this place. Brandon was so energetic, friendly, and super compromising to our needs. The food is another issue. it was bland, not worth their prices, and just wasn't tasty at all... BJ's really needs to shorten their menu in order to serve better food.  I would only go back to BJ's again if Brandon was working."
