Pat H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",17,53,9,5.0,2/10/2015,"We stopped in for lunch. It was a beautiful day so we sat on the Outdoor/Outdoor patio. We were seated right away by the hostess. The menu has a special lunch section and I ordered a lunch combo - half sandwich (Chicken Club), fries and Caesar Salad and my husband had the lunch BBQ platter with fries.  Our server arrived to take our drink orders and we also ordered lunch at that time. The service from Teresa was excellent and our food came out in the proper order and in a timely manner. She returned several times to check on us. We also had some questions about our rewards points and the upcoming Beer dinner - she was very gracious and got all our questions answered. We love BJ's for a relaxing meal under the sun or the stars."
Renee B.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,8,1,2.0,9/13/2015,"Came with 8 other ppl on a Sunday night. Sat on patio and ,,, waited,,, and ,,,waited and oh ""hallelujah""!!! Service at last. Ordered appetizers , took 20 plus minutes. We have been here for over an hour and finally got food. Terrible dining experience. Not returning here any time soon. Waitress never checked back to see how everything was. I blame the management for this."
Ashley D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",605,118,100,4.0,4/10/2014,"The service and food here was awesome! I came here with a few friends and my boyfriend after a long day at Six Flags and honestly our server was on point.  I ordered the BJ's berry alcoholic drink and I didn't like it so with no questions asked my server recommended and gave me a brand new drink, the strawberry splash. DELICIOUS! My boyfriend ordered the 20 oz. rib eye with mashed potatoes and rice. The rice was a little dry but the meat and potatoes were full of flavor!  I ordered the ahi poke plate and spinach stuffed mushrooms and both plates were fantastic! I could not stop eating. I didn't even want to share. I can't wait to come back again to have that again!"
Heather S.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",214,15,1,1.0,9/25/2013,"My family and I went to BJs for my birthday last Monday night. Ugh big mistake. Super slow service (which is not great with a 4 and 2 year old), the pizza came out burnt (hello doesn't anyone look at the food before it comes out?) the pizzokie took forever and they didn't sign or do anything fun for the birthday (which my kids were looking forward too) and the slowest waitress ever so no drink refills etc. Note to self, BJs is not the place to celebrate birthdays or frankly come with the kids at all."
Kristie R.,"Valencia, CA",0,2,,2.0,9/11/2014,"Delicious food. Sucky service.  I still eat here every now and then to enjoy some awesome pizza and dessert, but the service really stinks. The only time I have had a pleasant server was about a month ago. I can't remember her name but she was very sweet and patient."
Daddy J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,1.0,9/8/2015,"Worst restaurant experience in a LONG time. I asked the waitress if they were short staffed and she said yes. We got our appetizers before our drinks. It was pathetic. I will never go there again, I ended up going to the bar myself to get a second round of drinks because I knew they would be another 30 minutes if I'd ordered through the waitress. I would like to give this place zero stars if I could. Who cares what the food is like really when you spend all night waiting for service."
Corey G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,9,,3.0,9/5/2015,Food is pretty good but the service always seems to be slow. The micro-brew beer isn't anything that great either. Very down-the-middle restaurant.
Chef R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",10,9,5,2.0,12/13/2013,"This place has an issue with speed of service. It feels like they are understaffed and the kitchen is unable to get any food out under 30 minutes.  This would be fully understandable for pizzas, I am talking about appetizers and salads.  I had frequented other BJ's locations where this was no issue at all. Food quality and service friendliness however are very good. I am sure more guests would consider dining here for example before going to see a movie- but this is usually an all night event."
brett h.,"Newhall, CA",8,5,,5.0,10/18/2013,"Do you want to feel like a flock of unicorns are racing across your tongue? Of course you do, who doesn't? And yes, unicorns travel in flocks, not herds, keep up we're gonna be moving pretty quick here. On this site in 1987, Henry Kissinger wrestled Margaret Thatcher in a pool of jello, so right off the bat you know this place is magical. That energy lingers today, and is fully utilized by the staff of failed Marvel comic superheroes.  Why failed superheroes? You see, the Illuminati use the bar as a monthly gathering. After discovering the secret powers of the hostesses and servers, they decided to keep them from fully realizing their abilities. The Illuminati require cold beer, good food, and fast friendly service, which can only be provided by the staff at this exact location. So they can't be out saving the world, or performing slightly more mundane tasks. Your kitten can stay stuck in that tree. Fuck your kitten. Pro tip: When they ask if you need anything else, respond with ""The Koala clucks three times,"" to which the server will reply ""Bob Saget, Ace high."" You'll get a complimentary blank stare from your fellow restauranteurs and a wink from the chef. Your surprise will be waiting for you in your car."
H. W.,"Valencia, CA",2,117,18,3.0,11/21/2013,"Bennett we miss and love you, and wish you a speedy recovery. Half price wine Tuesdays are good, wait staff is understaffed and run their butts off. 4/21/15 We returned tonight after a hiatus, Bennett was there tending bar, with a fantastic staff of servers. The place was almost empty, sans the bar which was only 3/4 full at happy hour? The spinach/artichoke dip was smoking hot and good. The salad fresh and tasty, the calamari was perfect and the tomato soup hot and full if flavor. We never saw anyone from management. The servers are always under the gun because the kitchen is no bigger than a broom closet. One would think that opening a restaurant would require an adequate, spacious kitchen to prepare meals, not here. Loose the brewing vats and expand the working area before you have no business at all."
Malena A.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,181,94,2.0,12/16/2014,"I went to BJ's for a work holiday party last Friday for lunch. The service was INCREDIBLY SLOW. It probably took 15-20 minutes for the waitress to come greet us and take our drink order in the bar. And another 5 minutes for the drinks to come out. I had the new lasagna dish which was pretty good, but I didn't care for the weird, crispy  garlic bread. It was just hard to enjoy because we felt pretty ignored, and the place was not packed. We had to ask again for some things that weren't brought out the first time. The thing that upset me the most was that the waitress kept calling me ""hon"" and ""honey"" which I find very patronizing. It was especially embarrassing because I was with my boss and co-workers and she only said this to me. I am younger than my co-workers, but not that much younger (I'm 32). This ruined the experience for me."
Mike W.,"Valencia, CA",335,44,8,2.0,11/15/2013,"Bjs is bjs...  It's been the same food for the last 15 years...   This particular review is about the reverse happy hour...  So I guess well drinks and some martinis are 5 dollars for happy hour...  That seems like a great deal... Until you watch them pour...  It's half an ounce on every pour....  I guess since the drinks are about half off, the drinks are cut in half as well...  Bjs used to have pumpkin beer until Thanksgiving....  Now apparently they have it until they run out...  Lame...  It's your best selling beer....  Service in the bar for late night happy hour is awful.... It's packed because all the other stores are closing in the area... So how many people do they staff for the whole bar area... 1 poor waitress is stuck doing the whole section..."
Susie C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",21,7,,1.0,3/14/2015,"DO NOT GO. I have been here countless times, and usually I am satisfied but this past visit was bare minimum if that. The moment we walked in the service was terrible. My boyfriend and I came in at 9pm, after rush with not a lot of tables filled. We were told it would be a 5 minute wait. As we were waiting, another group of 2 came and were given buzzers and were sat before us. I went back to the counter to make sure that they knew we were there and after 5 more minutes we were finally sat. Sheena was our first server and she was awful. She came and introduced herself and took our drink and appetizer orders. After 10 minutes, another server brought us our drinks and took our food order. Did not catch this one's name, but she was a little better than Sheena, or so we thought. After 30 minutes, we finally got our appetizers with no follow up from our servers. While eating our appetizers, Sheena brought us our food and dropped it off and walked away without even saying anything - and I mean dropped, not set it down. As we finished our appetizers, I realized that my salad did not have a fork, and we had no silverware or napkins. It took 10 minutes of us just sitting and looking around for the second server to come and ask us what was wrong, and then she took 5 more minutes to give it to us. Also at this time, my drink needed a refill. She said she would get it. After 5 minutes, she came and said she was working on it. After 15 minutes, I finally got it. We were almost done eating when our second server came and asked us if we wanted dessert, and I responded that we didn't know yet.. That was the last time we saw our server. We finished eating, and waited 20 minutes for a check that never came. I finally went up to the take out place and asked if we could pay there. The girl there was super apologetic and got us our bill right away. I wish we would have saved the $60 and went somewhere with SOME service because there was ABSOLUTELY NONE here. I will NEVER come to this BJs again and will continue to tell people how awful this restaurant is."
Tammany F.,"Lancaster, CA",132,164,,2.0,12/26/2015,"It's the 24th mid day and the place is not crowded at all. We are at the front of the store and at least 5 servers/host and hostesses were gabbing and totally inappropriately. Finally a guy asks us how many we told him and mind you again, the place was not crowded and yet, it took him about ten minutes to get us placed. We asked the gabbers uh, when will we be seated? they were like really! you dare to interrupt us. Finally, we get seated and we get a waitress who actually did her job from start to finish and her name was Mel. If it had not been for her, I am sure it would have been a lets just leave moment. They seriously need to bring in secret eaters to report just how poor the front house is. Now to the food,,, The chicken strip tasted like they were frost bite frozen and not at all edible. The pizza was mediocre and the only thing tasty at all was the Mozzarella sticks. Not the way to spend your money."
Michael H.,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CA",0,8,,2.0,4/29/2016,Not the best experience. Recently moved to the area and figured we would go to a place we knew by name. Visited twice and neither visit was very good. First time was a weekday after lunch rush and the 'host' told us bar seating was open seating without even asking if we wanted a table. Ok. Second visit was a Friday night during the dinner hour. Now I get busy times but staff accordingly. We elected to sit at a bar table to avoid waiting but were basically ignored by at least 1/2 dozen wait staff before I finally asked someone passing by who it was who worked our table. Our food order was wrong and while the food deliverer was very quick and gracious about correcting it our waiter was less than enthusiastic about the error being made. All in all I doubt we'll be back any time soon.
Martin F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,186,89,2.0,11/9/2014,"Always always slow and terrible service. This is probably the most consistent thing in this restaurant. Each time i return i am hoping to see some improvement, but nothing. Even when they aren't packed the service is subpar."
Greg H.,"Castaic, CA",0,11,2,3.0,7/29/2013,"Are you interested in waiting for a table for over an hour? Are you interested in waiting another hour to get your food after ordering? Are you interested in waiting 20 min per round of beer/drink from an understaffed bar? Well, then welcome to BJ's. Always packed, always slow.  If you have kids with you, prepare for banishment in their outdoor/indoor seating area that adds 15-20 min to the times above.  The food is very good and there in lies the problem.  People want a nice place to hang out with family and friends.  BJs offers a nice atmosphere, good food, good drinks, and very poor service.  They KNOW you will wait.  The waiters/waitresses are clearly overworked and have too many tables.  This does not matter to BJ's management  (which is a Where's Waldo of someone over 25). Nor does complaining to the manager about slow service and/or slow food delivery. I used to think it was because when the place was packed the food came out slower. No. We went at about 25% capacity and the food preparation was actually slower. (Side note: Even though there were plenty of seats inside on this particular visit, we were still banished to the indoor/outdoor seating area). This is a great place to watch a sporting event, the crowd really gets into the game.  The bar area could be larger for this reason, but they have space issues. Food is good and the prices are OK, but not fantastic.  Drinks are good when you can actually get them.  Plan ahead if you are there to have a couple of cocktails with your food and watch the game. Order ahead of time from your server when you actually see them, which is rare. I have gotten accustomed to just flagging down ANY server to fulfill my requests. I have gotten better service using this method, although I am aware that I might actually be contributing to the very issues that I have with the service. Maybe someone is doing that to MY server and that is why I never see them? We usually eat here as a family (date nights are reserved for more intimate locals).  So, if you have kids, you know that going out with your kids is like a ticking time bomb.  The older they get, the more time you have before that bomb goes off, but there is a time limit to their patience/attention span and your sanity.   Here are some tips: They offer call ahead service. It places you on the waiting list. Use this.  The number is (661) 288-1299.  It is not a reservation, so call before you leave to go. You still have to check in. This saves you about half the normal wait time. Do not assume you will see your server on a regular basis. Order drinks and appetizers as soon as they greet you.  This will make the inevitable wait for more drinks and your entrée much more bearable. Ask for your check as soon as you can and know you are done.  I have had 30 min go by before I saw my server back with my credit card before I could leave.  Apparently they take their break times pretty serious there. If you go with kids (5 and younger) order their food IMMEDIATELY."
Runnerlover F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",48,122,57,3.0,3/13/2015,I have always been a fan of BJ's but most recently I went and the took their spicy spaghetti dish off their menu and that is the reason I went just for that dish. It was very disappointing but of course the chocolate chip Pizookie was delicious and love their berry house cider!!!! So I hope they bring back the spicy tomato spaghetti !!! Please
Maribel F.,"Farmington, CT",3,26,,5.0,1/5/2015,I am definitely a fan of this place for the dessert. Their known for their pizookie! My family comes here all the time. If we come with my sister we are a family of 6 and the wait is pretty long and that is because a lot of people come here. We understand that and it does not impact our dining out experience. From what I've seen the wait seems to be shorter for couples since there are more of those tables. My husband orders the salmon fish dish which he loves. If you have any issues with the service just let a hostess or waiter known and from my experience they react right away. I highly recommend this place. I also really LOVE their mozzarella appetizer. My boys don't really get anything special just chicken with fries but they love coming here for the mozzarella cheese stick & the desert.
Manny E.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",8,17,1,2.0,4/6/2015,The food is just terrible! I've been here several times and I've never had anything good.. Except.. The pazzookie! Which is why I'm giving the 2 stars!
