Mary M.,"Valencia, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/27/2016,It's Easter Sunday. Made a reservation for 20 at 10:30. It was partially empty when we came in. One waiter for our party and for other customers too. It is 12:30 pm. We all finally got our food. Cold over cooked. Poor waiter not his fault management should of had staff to handle the reservations will never come back. Food wasn't that good either.
Ilan J.,"Santa Clarita, CA",51,207,4,5.0,3/4/2015,well they added nutritinal stuff.  Service was great.  Food was wonderful so props to them
Richard S.,"Melbourne, Australia",0,17,2,3.0,4/13/2016,"This was our first time here so our first impression. The facility was pleasant and clean, staff were pleasant, food was served reasonably quickly. Unfortunately, the two entrees, a meat lovers calzone type thing and the single serve deep dish pizza were very mediocre. They just lacked any pizzazz. Where is a Pizza Uno when you need one? The Caesars Salad was okay and the salted caramel cookie dessert was the best thing we had. The thin cut fries were okay too. It wasn't so awful that we'll never come back but won't go out of our way either."
Jennifer P.,"Valencia, CA",109,14,,3.0,3/21/2015,Great food as long as you don't mind waiting for it. Service wasn't good never got a refill on my drink. The only way I'll go back is if I'm craving a pizookie.
Bien T.,"Valencia, CA",241,15,9,1.0,11/10/2014,"First of all.. My family came in 6:15pm . The hosts said its gonna be about 20-25 minutes wait. We finally got called at 7:02pm..We got into our table 4 different servers pass us for about 5 minutes, and finally i ask one of them who is our server? The waiter said ahhh i will help you guys. I don't wanna be rude but come on now i have to stop the waiter to serve us..OMG. after 20 minutes we got our food is was good but service is HORRIBLE!!!! I was looking for our server to get the check so that we could get the hell out of this restaurant, The waiter took 5 minutes just to give my change which i still tip him 15%... I don't think we will be coming to this establishment anymore ... Too bad i love their Pizza and some foods. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
Kasey D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,5,,3.0,7/10/2015,Our waitress talia was great! We were sat outside in the covered section and it got super loud during lunch which was ok since we have a 9 month old. I am a clean freak and sanitize the table before we sit and my napkin was BLACK. That was disappointing. My salad was hot and pizza was crispy (I got the lunch special with a Caesar salad and mini pizza). Usually BJs never disappoints but it was off on this particular day!
Michelle B.,"New York, NY",28,2,,1.0,11/12/2015,"The absolute worst experience ever!  We celebrated my son's 13th birthday at Six Flags Magic Mountain and planned on capping off the day with dinner and a pizookie at his favorite restaurant - BJs.  (We frequently eat at the one in Laguna Hills.)  Since it was after 7 and a school night, our party ordered our food and drinks as soon as the server greeted us. After 40 minutes of waiting for food, we asked a server (not ours) what was going on with the kitchen because we heard him apologize to at least 3 tables around us for the long wait and brought them complimentary pizookies to eat while they continued to wait for their dinners. He said the restaurant is busy, understaffed and only had one Manager on duty. (We didn't quite understand how the number of Managers on Duty was relevant unless that meant with no Manager in the kitchen, the kitchen couldn't make a pizza within an hour.) He said he would check on our food and 20 minutes later never came back with an update. During this time, our server also said he would check on our food and never came back.  After 75 minutes with no food on the table (not even the kids' mac n cheese!) our party of 6 walked out of the restaurant.  I will never go back to the Valencia location regardless of how much my son begs me to.  We are looking forward to celebrating his birthday dinner properly, with excellent service and reasonable cook times, tomorrow night at our ""usual location"" in Laguna Hills.  The Manager and entire kitchen staff on duty last night should be fired."
Jasmin B.,"Castaic, CA",7,5,2,4.0,5/22/2015,Tonight we had great service! Amanda was our server and was great! Usually we have poor and slow service but tonight it was great! Food was awesome too!
Sergio R.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",103,35,19,3.0,10/11/2013,"Ok so I live nearby and it's a cool place to catch a late night dinner after the movies since its just across the street. The service is pretty good. Been there a lot and I have nothing bad to say about their service. On weeknights though, it gets pretty busy. The food there is pretty good. I always get medium vegetarian pizza and split it with my girlfriend and a cup of chowder which is pretty good as well. Also the chili cheese burger is pretty amazing. Overall it's a solid 3 for me. Nothing special about this place but it ain't bad."
Rav K.,"Sacramento, CA",144,20,12,1.0,9/24/2014,Worst service and the worst food ever! The name BJs should be removed and changed to crappy uncooked food! Warning do not go!!
Keith B.,"Pasadena, CA",5,102,4,2.0,9/20/2014,"This place needs to step it up.  It's not 1996 anymore were decent good and beer will get you by alone.   And seriously it's college football Saturday, turn up the sound of the games.  Duh. I don't want to hear background music.  It's FREEZING in here.  Get some outlets to charge phones and devices.  Bj's is going the way of the corporate world and getting beat badly."
SoCal C.,"Southern California, CA",3,106,19,1.0,3/12/2013,"Food Poisoning for Two, with a side of A Ruined Night at the Movies... The beer glasses had chunks of food stuck to the insides, which we found once we had already consumed most of our beer.  The bar area was dirty and floors were sticky.   The service was equally poor.  We finished our salads and the plates were clearly ready to be picked up, yet our server AND the person delivering our entrees both had empty hands each time they left our table and neither took the empty and dirty plates.  In fact, we stacked our plates to make a point and our server still did not take them even when he brought our check.  So, after paying the check, I left it sitting on the plates.   Needless to say, our night was ruined as we both ended up with food poisoning last night, and today we feel like someone kicked us on the stomach.   It is obvious food safety is not a priority for BJ's."
Camille Y.,"Canyon Country, CA",1,30,2,2.0,7/17/2015,"Food was good, but their portion size has decreased tremendously!! The prices are still the same but the amount of food is way smaller, it's really noticeable. Probably won't be going back if I'm really hungry"
Tim B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",469,164,27,5.0,6/13/2015,Movie tickets sold here for $8.50 when you eat or drink. What a great idea. Will make me come here more often! Get liquored up and see a movie.
Hugh I.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/27/2016,"Went for lunch, waited for 25 minutes and no server came to wait on us though there were four standing idle near the front door. Left n got apologies as we exited the front door. Expected better service, this was unusual for this restaurant to have such poor service. Staff could use more training in serving customers, including  covering those not in their area. There are other restaurants with better service, so I won't be back soon."
Eric C.,"Valencia, CA",19,62,,2.0,3/6/2013,"I don't have a problem with the food. I don't have a problem with the prices. I do, however, have a problem with servers who attempt to force a higher tip by playing games with giving change. My girlfriend and I went in on a quiet Monday evening, and our total bill was $20.34. I generally pay cash, and this time I didn't have enough singles to leave my usual 20%, which would have been $4. Our server wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't so upset that I wouldn't leave 20%. I put $30 in the folder, and when it came back, there was two $5's inside,instead of the $9.66 there should have been. Rather than risk getting a lower tip, our server just ate the change, and tried to force me to leave a 25% tip. As I said, he wasn't good enough for that. Well, in this case, he got somewhere in the neighborhood of 15%, since between us, we had three singles. I won that one, but I should never have been forced to do it in the first place. If you want a 25% tip...earn it. Bring fresh coffee without being asked, and don't make a customer ask for a soda refill. Seems simple...but not everyone gets it."
Leilani S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,106,4,5.0,12/29/2015,"Visited tonight (Tuesday) around 6:45 PM. Dinner for two. Walked in and was told by a very confused and frantic looking girl that it would be a 30 minute wait. What the hell. We put down our name and told her we would be in the bar section because we wanted to watch the Kings game anyways. We luckily found a bar table and flagged down a busboy to clean it. Very nice gentleman cleaned it quickly. We sat and waited less than five minutes for our server. Young, blonde, bearded. Took our drink order, and brought my strawberry lemonade and their BJ's IPA out very quickly. We ordered and got our food in a great amount of time. Let me tell you right now, their pizza is the BEST. I knew this before this particular visit, but still. It was about $48 for a pint of beer, a strawberry lemonade, 2 small pizzas and a ahi poke appetizer. Our server was extremely nice and quick. Ended up tipping him $12 when the check came, and since we stayed another 30 minutes until the game was over, another $5. Oh, and the beer ended up being pretty good for house brewed stuff! Will return!!"
Ashley R.,"Canyon Country, CA",7,1,1,5.0,2/11/2015,"When I came in it was busy so I sat at the bar.  This nice gentleman  by the name of Jon, galicia was quick to take my order.  Very welcoming and friendly .  Had a nice charm about him.  I ordered  the Jerry burst.  Since I've heard good things about it.  This drink was very refreshing. A bit of cider  and beer. The spring rolls are yummy and the pizza is to die for. All around great service.  Will be back soon."
Mary T.,"Orange, CA",0,8,1,1.0,1/23/2016,"If I could I would rate it a zero. The grill was broken and no one could order meat, service was terrible, the server was mad and it took about 45 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich and it was still bad.The mac'n cheese was cold and when it came back it was not cheesey.water even was even bad friend even had a server take her plate when she wasn't done eating. Seriously it shouldn't take 50minutes to get a water. The only thing that was great was the pizookie. We even had some water spill on a friend."
Marianne A.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,57,,2.0,10/27/2015,"From the business - written on Yelp page - BJ's specialties ""... A team that lives to make sure you walk away happy.  To us, going out is sacred. We're on a mission to deliver a great time in a place that's as welcoming as the people who work here. With our roots in the fast-paced, quality-conscious world of Southern California, we believe that your experience at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse should always exceed your expectations -and always be worth going out for."" Saturday afternoon 10/24/15 about 3:15pm and we were trying to get in and out before a movie across the street. The restaurant was not even remotely busy. There was almost nobody eating in the bar seating area either so we grabbed a booth and then watched and waited while a group of waitstaff hung around and talked to each other at the far end of the bar. There was a waiter circulating around between a couple of high tops but neither he nor anybody else ever looked in our direction. Thought about leaving but as uncrowded as it was, we thought chances were good of getting in and out in time so we stayed. Finally, after at least fifteen minutes, waiter Kyle 830 wandered over. No ""thanks for waiting"" or ""sorry for the wait"" - he dropped two menus off and asked if we wanted a sample of pumpkin ale. We said no thanks, ordered drinks. Kyle came back with my diet pepsi and dropped two sets of silverware/napkins on the table - said nothing, and walked away again. Nothing like ""I'll be right back to take your order""- just disappeared. He finally returned with Tim's drink from the bar after carrying it around for a few minutes while he was taking a check to a different table and checking on another- set it down and walked away from us again, STILL not having taken our food order or saying he would be back in a minute or whatever. We watched him take dirty plates away from another table, take a check to a different table . . . easily ten or more minutes before I finally caught his eye from a distance and sort of raised an eyebrow and smiled at him. He still didn't come over- and when he finally did, it was just totally weird to have someone walk up with a pad and pen and just look at us and smirk at us, write down our order, say ok and walk away. He brought out our food and dropped it off, still aloof- never approached us after that and wouldn't even look in our direction -not for refills, not to ask if everything was ok, nothing- even though he was at the booth right next to ours and the high top right near us several times. Glasses were empty, we had finished eating and had stacked our plates and he was nowhere in sight. He finally came back to ask if we wanted dessert but still didn't offer refills. We didn't want dessert because not really enough time before movie plus which by then we just wanted to get out of there. We asked for the check and he brought it and set it down without a word- took awhile to return to pick it up without a word- took longer than it should've to run the card and bring the check back- then he just set it down and walked away again. No thanks for coming in or have a good afternoon- just totally frosty, going through the motions. Kyle, you would've gotten double the tip if you had been remotely friendly to us. We tip 20% on the total including tax for just routine (even slow) service with nothing extra or special- and then throw an extra $1 or sometimes $2 on top of that when the waitstaff adds to the experience and makes it fun. This was the first time we've ever even considered leaving nothing at all. We left you $4 on $34 only because our orders came out correctly- that was the one single thing you did well. The low tip wasn't because of all of the waiting to order drinks and then food, it wasn't even that we didn't get refills because you weren't around- it's that you were so unfriendly and almost pretentious during our every single interaction with you, right from the start and all the way through.  Although it wasn't jamming and crowded, we still knew we weren't your only table and didn't give you any attitude at all, even for the wait when you first came over to us. We always try to think if someone might be having a rough day and were trying to be chilled and nice. It didn't seem like you were shy because you were talking and laughing with customers at other tables, also checking in on them without being flagged down. It was like you wanted us to go away- you showed almost open hostility towards us and neither of us can figure out why. Yeah, I absolutely sniffed out loud at the end when you just set the card and check down, turned around and walked away- I don't think we've ever had anyone just set a check down, turn their back and walk away without a thanks or have a good night or whatever. I see from other reviews that our experience with this certain waiter wasn't just a one-off occurrence. Far more choices for eating out besides BJ's. Eating at home would've even been a way nicer experience than this was."
