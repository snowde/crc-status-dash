Holland V.,"Valencia, CA",4,29,4,1.0,9/24/2012,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!  We had a birthday dinner at the BJ's in Valencia and they effectively ruined the party.  We had almost 20 people in our party and sat on the patio so there would be enough room.  We asked to split our bills into smaller groups to make it easier to keep track of who owed what--especially considering several of us were purchasing drinks, which gets expensive.  We were told that we could not split our bill, even though we made it clear that we would still pay the added gratuity for the large party.  The most they would do for us was split our bill between the two tables in our party.  We had a table of four and the rest were seated at another table.   Throughout our meal, our server was nowhere to be found.  The few times he did come to serve us, he made it clear that he was irritated with the size of our party.  By the time our bills came, the table of four was way under-charged for their meals/drinks and the larger table was way over charged.  Trying to sort out who owed what and where their charges even were was a nightmare.  And as we broke the bills down, we found that there were items on our bills that we didn't even order.  We explained this to both the server and the manager and neither one would help us.  They treated us like we had been rude, out of control patrons.  They wouldn't change the bill and they flat out argued with us about the charges.  We spent so much time trying to sort it out that one of the people in our party just put the extra charges on his bill so we could leave.   in the end, we spent a grand total of three hours there--one and a half of which was dedicated purely to trying to sort out the bill.  It was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant."
Wendy S.,"Long Beach, CA",13,39,2,1.0,10/4/2014,It would be hard to find a smaller $5 salad out there anywhere in the universe. Seriously 5 bites and it's done. A side salad that size should be $2.95 or for $5 triple the size.
Virginia B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,26,85,4.0,1/1/2015,"Variety of foods to pick from. We enjoy the salads, pizza, pasta, meat dishes and of course the pizookie! Drinks are also tasty. Great family place to enjoy a meal."
Nami C.,"Orange County, CA",72,176,,1.0,6/9/2014,came here after watching maleficent at the theatre nice location~ but...service was bad food was nasty. (felt sick after) waitress was so high on weed that it was noticeable...i dont get how her manager didnt notice...she was all over the place...took forever just to get a beer.. brought extra utensils for no reason when it was only 2 of us....she didnt make any sense.. i regret not checking the yelp reviews before coming to this place... wont be coming back.
Allison T.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",38,16,6,4.0,10/7/2013,"Not much too say, everyone in the SCV eats here no matter what. Haven't been here without running into someone I know. When I do eat at BJs, I always sit at the bar (servers I've had can be slow and not the friendliest). The bartenders are awesome though. Eric and Geoff are the only reasons I come here! So awesome and keep their cool no matter how packed it gets. Good food, great bartenders.  PS order the 2 for $20 lunch special. Soup/salad, deep dish pizza and pizzookie. Great deal, can't go wrong."
Carl B.,"Valencia, CA",8,37,7,5.0,12/21/2014,Been going to this one for years. Great service and great food. Beer is really good. Kid friendly restaurant . My son loves their kids spaghetti. This place gets busy on weekends. One of favorite pizza.
Walker S.,"San Diego, CA",13600,511,2167,5.0,9/1/2014,Good service and food at a unique location.  We used the parking garage and walked a short block.  Service was truly exceptional (25% tip) with delicious food.  Highly recommended.
Vina C.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,27,,4.0,1/17/2016,"We love to go to BJ's for lunch.  They have a good variety of items on the menu, from seared ahi tuna salad to pizza.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is courteous.  The only downside for us is that the service is a little slow sometimes and we only have a 45 minute lunch break.  Overall, it's a comfortable and casual environment, and the food is really good."
B S.,"Quartz Hill, CA",11,114,74,2.0,1/19/2013,I end up here lot due to the proximity. The service is lack luster and the food is not very great at all. I get a burger sometimes and it's just ok. Ok at best really.
Catherine R.,"Ventura, CA",5,22,,2.0,8/19/2014,"I went to BJs with a friend on a monday after work for happy hour. It was not busy and yet it took Billy our waiter ten minutes to take our drink orders. He was slow the whole night.  Additionally, when we sat down he tossed the menus on the table as he was walking away and said ill be back. Billy acted like he hated us and couldn't be bothered i almost felt like maybe he knew me and i did something bad to him thats how uninterested he was. Overall it was by far the worst service I've ever had at a BJs or period now that I think about it. The only reason I'm not saying ill never go there again is because 1.  I love the food. 2.  While Billy was on break a nice personable young man named Eric helped us and he was great."
Karen V.,"Valencia, CA",16,59,43,1.0,7/18/2012,"BAD SERVICE!  I have been trying to give this place a chance to redeem themselves with their service.  They fail every time.  In the past two months, I have been eating dinner there every two weeks or so...and every time the service SUCKS. This very last time they messed up my order big time! I ordered the Mahi Mahi and asked for no red bell peppers in the fried rice mixture. Well...my dinner came out and there was no red bell pepper, errr, there was actually nothing in the fried rice mixture but rice. They left out the pineapple, green onions, sesame seeds, etc. REALLY?? The waitress put in another order and this took another 15 minutes. My friend finished his dinner while I was waiting for mine. NO MANAGER came over to say anything...they truly don't give a shit. They are too busy having a mini party up at the hostess kiosk.  I know, I know...I should have asked to talk to a Manager....but by then...I was done with this place.  Maybe Corporate cares?? Probably not."
Jessica R.,"San Jose, CA",4,15,2,1.0,9/7/2014,"Only giving this one star because I have to. By far the WORST service I've ever had at any restaurant. My family and I went out for brunch at 11AM, it was still very quiet. It took 50 minutes to get our coffee. The cooks were all sitting on break talking at a table near by. We ordered some mimosas, it took them 20 minutes to tell is that they were out of champagne (why they are out on a Sunday is confusing to me). We decided to order other drinks and these took 30 minutes to come! We placed our meal orders, when they came only ONE of the five plates were correct! Simple things such as eggs done over easy vs scrambled and sausage vs ham were missed. Why offer different options if it's going to be made incorrectly? When I spoke to the manager about our experience he didn't seem to care. Very disappointing."
Michael L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,,3.0,8/18/2014,"I am sad to give this location three stars as I have been a fan of BJ's since they built the first one in our area.   The good: Their beer is awesome as always; tons of TV's to watch your game; place is huge and it's easy to accomodate a large group.   The bad: Generally, once you get beyond simple bar food the quality has really gone down.  Also, the bar is just a mess, I don't know if there is some kind of bad corporate mojo, or the bartenders are bad as a whole, but you can't get a simple mixed drink here anymore. I've been to the Burbank and Woodland hills locations and I find the bartending much better, so it's isolated to this location.  Also, the vastness of the space (with the addition of the enclosed patio now) makes service problematic.  I don't blame the servers for this.  What they need is an additional ""service bar"" for the servers in another area.  Right now they are walking 100 plus feet through a crowd and then standing in line at a jammed bar.  It just doesn't work.  Try getting a drink on the patio on a Sunday night--easily 20 minutes! Anyway, still a good place to go and watch a game.  Stick to beer and barfood and you'll be OK."
Ryan R.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",42,53,16,2.0,7/27/2014,Meh hits it about right. I ordered the Bleu Cheese burger and every other BJs I have been to this is a hit. Here though it was lacking bleu cheese and wasn't cooked properly. Not top of that it was packed so the service was almost nonexistent.
Kalvin R.,"Walnut Creek, CA",220,250,54,4.0,7/15/2014,"Ouch, you guys from Valencia are tough 2.5 Stars that's just wrong. I'm from Northern Ca and this establishment has it all. Was able to have a nice meal lots of drinks and watched the final of the World Cup. Everyone was friendly food was good the crowd was fun the price was fair I give it a 4"
Benjamin S.,"Newhall, CA",445,475,35,1.0,7/9/2012,"In the words of every coach I've ever had, ""Oh no no no, you're doing it ALL wrong!"" BJ's is one of my favorite family restaurants to go to, always has been. Even back in Eugene, Oregon during college I'd get take-out two times a week. Since moving to Valencia I've used BJ's as a regular go to spot for some good grub n brews. However, the past several times its been a major let down. Thursday night was an all time bad.  Our server, some impolite long haired short girl working in the bar area. She was about as friendly as a commodant from a soviet death camp. I ordered water to start, which I normally do before getting some beers in the ole' blood-stream; that made her relatively unhappy.  Then I moved on to appetizers. I ordered the 1/2 buffalo chicken 1/2 parm' nuggets and a side of wedge fries. The wedge fries were delicious, the chicken was cold. You could tell it sat in the window while she was running frantically back and fourth to tables. I served tables for 3 years, she wasn't efficient AT ALL.  Took me three attempts to get a refill on my beer. Then when she found out the food was cold she didn't even say anything but, ""Well, do you still want it?"" No? Wtf? Why would I want cold chicken. I mean, yes, I still want to eat chicken, but not that hypothermia chicken.  It was a mess, my friend and I opted out of dinner because she just made us both uncomfortable. I would have told a manager if I could have found one, apparently they were walking around somewhere. I'm use to a manager coming and seeing me directly every time I eat at a BJ's, but for whatever reason this time it didn't happen. Of course, the one time I actually needed one.  All together a disappointment, and a surprising one considering how much I love BJ's."
Jay O.,"Los Angeles, CA",17,101,20,1.0,12/14/2012,Come here after having a great time at the tilted kilt...me and my friends sat at the bar waiting to be served..as we sat there a disgusting odor filled the bar area.. It was nasty... I tried to ignore it.. We finally order I got the Margherita flat bread pizza and my friend got the Avocado rolls..I bite into my flat bread and it was cold (very upset) it was getting really late and I just wanted a nice hot meal..the bartender takes the food back and it arrives hot (yay) .. All together the food was just ok My friend who ordered the avocado rolls wanted the regular plate not the happy hour.. They mess up the first time thinking her food was cold and take it (she told the bartender she wanted the regular size not the happy hour size) he comes back with her food but its the same happy hour size.. We both look at each other confused.. We didn't want to argue since it was late as it was (however the avocado rolls tasted good) It will be a while till I come back
Cortney B.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,75,71,1.0,8/31/2014,"I've been a loyal customer of  BJ's for over ten years. I have to say this is one of the worst establishments I have been too. My waitress Danielle was rude and when I was inquiring about menu options she was not informative at all. She hardly came to check up on us and filled up are glass of water once. Plus it took close to 30 min to get our appetizers and they were cold. Lastly, she needs to learn how to check IDs properly for drinks because she can get into serious trouble and cost the company their liquor license. Sad to say management needs to review who they hire to serve customers."
Nozomi S.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,4,3,4.0,11/22/2013,"So, so good. Always so good. The chili tonight was spot-on, despite the lack of bread bowls. And the draft cream soda was like drinking liquid candy, in the best way possible. It's always lightly carbonated, just enough to give that tingle. If I could live with that taste on my tongue for the rest of my life, I would.  Be kind to the staff! They are a little understaffed on weekend nights, so try the weekdays, or lunch, if you can. If you're not demanding, though, the staff can keep you satisfied any day of the week."
Michael D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",2152,1759,2038,4.0,11/5/2012,"The influx of families and children can wreak havoc on any dining establishment. Toddlers running around and tweens sighing in protest is enough to drive any parent crazy so the last thing you want to worry about is the restaurant itself. Going out with the family is a treat so I don't like to risk trying new things with the kids. We came here because we knew that every other place was a super long wait but BJs took us in about 15 minutes and with the crowd they had, it was remarkable. We had 8 people in our group and the kids made it a challenge. We ordered the food and it took some time to get to us but I have to admit, they delivered. I ordered the fish and chips I was pretty impressed. The plate was $12.95 and it came with 4 fish strips and fries. Loved the fact that the server brought out the malt vinegar and extra tartar sauce. I stole some of my wife's grilled chicken pasta and it was good too. The location and the speed of service renders this place good on my scale. We will come back next time we want a change from the usual kiddie spots that they young ones like to frequent."
