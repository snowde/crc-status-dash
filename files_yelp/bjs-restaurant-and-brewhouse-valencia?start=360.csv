Diane S.,"Valencia, CA",0,4,,1.0,1/31/2016,"I have not been to BJ's in years because when I used to go, the service was always poor.  We went for a quick celebration for my son's birthday, as he wanted to go.  The food was standard...nothing special, nothing bad.  The waitress was awful  She seemed as if we were an inconvenience for her to be there.  She barely acknowledged us when we sat down, not even a smile, hi how are.  When we finally (after a close to 45 minute wait) got our food, we asked for napkins to which she literally dropped the napkins and silverware on one of my son's friends arm which was on the table, quite literally dropped them and walked away.  After dinner, she asked my son if he wanted the birthday Pizookie, which he said yes.  Then he and his friends made bets on how long it would take.  Literally, 22 minutes later is when she brought it over, almost throwing it on the table in front of him and walked away.  During those last 22 minutes, not once did she acknowledge we were there.  She blamed the wait saying the computers were down, which is load of bs since both my son worked at a restaurant for a short time and said that's what they always used as their excuse, as well as we were right by the computer station where her and other servers were at putting in orders.  If it wasn't for having so much fun with my son and his friends, I would have said a lot more there.  Final result, I will be staying away from BJ's for a long time again.  There are too many other places that have better service, nicer people in the SCV!"
Carla T.,"Valencia, CA",36,18,,3.0,6/26/2014,"Always fantastic food and selection but VERY VERY VERY LOUD.  Do NOT go on a date here --- you will not enjoy your conversation.  But other than that, its a very fun place to be at, especially if a Sports Game is on and your favorite team is playing.  There is always a wait - from 20 mins OR MORE.  Parking is a bit of a walk too.  Prices are reasonable."
Reyhaneh H.,"Valencia, CA",51,1,,1.0,7/18/2015,I felt disrespected. I was out with my friends and we didn't have that much to drink and we ordered another drink and the manager came to us and said he had to cut us off because the waiters didn't think we should have any onther drink. Lets get one think straight we were not drunk at all. We will not be back here again.
Mario M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",95,2,1,5.0,2/14/2015,"Ok...sit at the friggin bar.  John, Erick, Amber,and  Stevie, and Bennett are awesome."
Bob F.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,18,,2.0,10/20/2015,"I usually enjoy this BJ's but this trip was marred by an unwelcoming encounter with manager Fernando. He is only cordial to his ""regulars"" which include employees of Princess Cruise lines who got seated before us after coming in after us and announcing they worked for the cruise line. He instructed the host to seat them first. We were eventually seated by another host but learned that there would be one additional member of our party and needed a larger table. Fernando came over and rudely replied ""Well how many are there?"" which ended up being a party of 6. I guess my plans can never change and bring additional guests to BJ's so not to inconvenience the management. After finishing lunch, 2 of my party went into the bar while the rest went shopping. I'm surprised that I visited a place twice in one day when initially treated so rudely. I usually like going to BJ's and will not let a manager with questionable priorities ruin my image of your restaurant. The servers in both the dining area and the bar area were awesome. Maybe when I return I will be able to give a better rating."
Hannah V.,"Ventura, CA",3,60,7,3.0,7/16/2013,"Pizookie is always 5 stars! BJs service is mehhhh as usual, similar service at any BJs I've been to. Cobb salad was really good. Their chicken tortilla soup is awesome as well!"
Carol R.,"Canyon Country, CA",66,10,1,1.0,2/16/2014,"Crappy service has always been their shining star, but today, this place outdid itself in the food area. After eating lunch, we ordered dessert, which took 20 minutes, (because our waitress went on break and didn't say a word and her replacement stopped by 15 minutes later to ""check on us""). When it arrived, special requests for ice cream to be served on the side of two orders were ignored and my baked beignets had two non-dessert items integrated into them - sliced chives/green onions and red peppers! Either the dishwasher was on strike or the food preparer was very sloppy.  That said, the waiter (when he finally returned) took off the dessert at my request, but never offered an apology, acting more like this was standard operating procedure. There was no visit to our table by management to say they were sorry, or that they were surprised that it happened or that it would never happen again. Helped make my mind up - I don't need to ever go there again.  Don't bother going there. Find another place that knows the definition of clean dishes, the concept that dessert should be sweet and how to make people happy instead of just tolerant."
Paulette E.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,8,,1.0,6/17/2012,"I went there with to celebrate my birthday with my family.  I had the worst experience ever.  The waiter was very rude and in a hurry.  My son asked him what they had for drinks, and the waiter simply answered we have pepsi product.  Then my son ordered a lemonade, and the waiter brought him a pink lemonade which my son hates.  I had their steak salad and asked the waiter to have the vinaigrette on the side.  the waiter brought everybody's food out except my salad.  I had to wait 10 minutes for my salad.  By then I was starving and nervous of the whole thing.  My salad came with the vinaigrette mixed in and the steak was red, the waiter neglected to ask me how I liked it cooked, which would have been well done.   BJ's had ruined my birthday.  I will never go back there again."
Cmm P.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",566,34,29,2.0,3/15/2014,"Little disappointed. Went their last nite w my bff and service sucked terribly. Ate and drank at the bar. Ordered the bruccetta w my fruity beverage of choice. Drink was good, bruchetta was a waste. It was 4 bites in total. My gf ordered a desert and it took literally 30 min. Waitress tried to claim she was hustling in the back to get it for us but she was flirting behind the bar w the wait staff. Kinda disappointed. For shame bjs."
J B.,"Morgan Hill, CA",12,399,38,2.0,6/18/2012,The B Js in San Jose is better.  the wait for food is  very long and when it does come out it is cold. The place I clean and in a good loction. I will go back to the one in San Jose.
Angie S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",63,22,14,2.0,3/23/2012,"I love BJs, but I give 2 stars for horrible service. The pizza is always great. I purposely go during happy hour to get a good discount. When you go with your date, the service is okay, but for parties it's awful! Our party walked in around 6:30pm and we wanted to take advantage of the happy hour, so we talked to the manager who said ""yeah, you guys are good. You'll still get the happy hour discount"" Well, they took forever to ask for our order and when it was time to pay, they wouldn't let us take the happy hour discount because we ordered past 7. What's with that? They rarely came to refill our drinks, took forever with our checks. Overall, don't go here for parties or big group outings. The waiters don't really try since there's a fixed tip amount."
Andy R.,"Nipomo, CA",22,271,26,1.0,5/11/2012,"Dear management,  please pay attention to your customers. We went in for lunch at 1:05 today a d left after 15 minutes. No water, no waiter or anything. Most of your servers were yucking it up at the front. This is a service business, yuh?  Customers appear to be a speed bump in your young staffs mind. Avoid, avoid, avoid this place. We walked out at 1:20. Place was not busy"
Abby L.,"Carson, CA",348,8,81,2.0,1/29/2012,"No matter how many times I have gotten HORRIBLE service here, I keep coming back! I don't know if it's out of convenience or I'm addicted to pizookies, BUT after last night... NEVER again. 1 star for service... but I'll bump it up one more star because pizookies have never failed me. Here is a letter I wrote to their corporate office that sums up what happened: ------- To Whom It May Concern: I am writing, not to complain about our dining experience-- in fact, it was the best service we have had at the Valencia establishment in a while. Our server named Miko was attentive and helpful, and QUICK. Despite it being a Saturday night, and busy, and packed, we have no complaints about the food or service. However, I do have some concerns about the ""front"" of the house with the young gentleman and other employees who stand in the front, and who is in charge of passing out pagers and the waiting list. While I understand that it is a Saturday night, he should not say the average ""wait time"" is 20-30 minutes when clearly, almost every party waits close to an hour. Be up front and honest about ""wait times"" because it can really change a customer's night, especially when they have things planned. Furthermore, my biggest complaint is that we arrived before other larger parties (of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 people)-- and note: it was just my boyfriend and myself. These larger parties were given priority to get seated before us. When we asked the employees in charge of the wait list why these people who came AFTER us were being seated first, they told us they wanted to maximize table space, and were just waiting for a smaller table of ""2"" to open up. Frustrated, we continued to wait while others were seated before us. This is unacceptable, because I believed that the ""wait list"" was on a first come-first serve basis. This location's strategy to maximize ""table space"" was frustrating and humiliating to watch as we sat and waited... and waited... and waited, while others were given priority over us. Lastly, upon arriving at our small ""table for 2"" to eat, other patrons in the restaurant that were only a party of 2 were being seated at tables meant for 4 people, or booths-- a complete opposite of what the front of the house/management had told us about ""waiting for a table for 2"". I often come to Valencia to visit my boyfriend, and we choose BJ's to eat at because we like the food, and try to overlook the bad service or experiences, but after last night, we will no longer go to this specific establishment in Valencia, or even promote the ""positive"" qualities the Valencia location has to offer to our friends and families who often come to this restaurant. Please address how management ""manages"" things, because we feel it was very unprofessional, and a horrible experience for myself, and possibly other customers who dined last night. :("
Ivory S.,"Valencia, CA",0,5,6,3.0,5/30/2014,"Pricey. A little small, you can hear other people's convos for sure but I have to say, their gluten free pizza A+!"
Scott J.,"Los Angeles, CA",214,123,42,2.0,3/17/2014,Service was a bit rude. The good however was not that great. Our fried artichoke appetizer was good but the main food was just plain gross. I had the roast beef dip that was not hot or even warm. My daughters BBQ chicken pizza was undercooked the cheese was barely melted. My other daughter had the new salad with kale and Brussel sprouts it was gross. All the soft dirks were flat we kept sending them back but decided to stop because the waitress was getting irritated all an all I will it be going back we paid a lot of money for really bad food. It appears at least with all the negative Yelp reviews the management is out of touch.
Caitlin M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",38,32,8,4.0,2/26/2013,"Frequent diner. But we usually just sit at the bar. We tend to get better service in the bar area than sitting at an actual table. Food has never disappointed. Just the service.  There's a female server who constantly will call you ""young man"" or ""young lady"" that is EXTREMELY annoying, seeing as she's only maybe 5 years older than I.  If you're going in a large party, bring cash and prepare to wait awhile. Service tends to lag, and they usually don't split the bill for large parties.  Overall, the atmosphere is good. But the more experienced and personable servers are zoned in the bar area..."
Gef J.,"Walnut Creek, CA",1,56,66,4.0,1/5/2013,Ate here twice on business.  Late night dining as usual.  I'm always thankful when I find a BJ's close.
M.j. W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",52,31,2,1.0,12/29/2013,I am so disgusted with BJ's. I am NEVER going back again. I had a fundraiser with them in December. They told me they only received flyers for $100 of meals. Our bill alone was almost $60. Many people in our organization went there with flyers and two friends were there with flyers when we were there dining. They are DISHONEST and I never want to do business with them again.
Amy D.,"Saugus, CA",0,1,,2.0,5/8/2014,The service wasn't good and no servers came to out table asking how out food was food was great tho just really bad service.
Manoj N.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",146,827,100,3.0,9/7/2013,"First visit with family at the Valencia location. We have been to the Burbank location couple of times when we used to live there. As most folks have mentioned, wait times are horrendous. Staff was nice. No issues with that. I got the Shrimp Taco and it was not that great. The ones from Chipotle or Qdoba tastes better. Daughter loved her macaroni and cheese and the mini-pizzokie. Wife is a vegetarian and she got the vegetarian pizza and it was okay. Good place for family get together but keep at least 45 minutes waiting in mind. One of the clean spoons served was unclean and we had to get a replacement so I am not sure about their utensil cleaning process in kitchen."
