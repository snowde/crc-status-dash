Michelle H.,"Irvine, CA",218,395,47,4.0,6/6/2012,"BJ's has literally been in SCV since FOREVER.  It's a really fun place for families, teenagers, and couples to hang out since there is not much else to do in SCV... LOL.  The service is good and the staff is really friendly.   There are a ton of great beers on tap and if that's not your thing then they have a full bar that is ready to serve you!  The bar also offers full menu/service so feel free to head that way if the wait is a little bit too long for your liking.   Pros: -Good Happy Hour specials -Nice servers/hosts -Bar offers full menu/service -PIZOOKIE! Cons: -SO CROWDED ON THE WEEKEND -Parking at the Valencia mall is so difficult! Tips: Park at the structure by the movie theater; it is the closest and easiest to get in and out of!"
Cindy L.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,79,406,1.0,12/13/2013,Came on a Thursday evening and were seated promptly but service sucked. The burger I ordered was too burnt and the side salad nothing special. The only thing I liked was the pomegranate martini. I would not come again unless to watch a game.
Jaymie P.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",6,10,,4.0,10/29/2012,"This BJs has better parking than its Valley brethren.  So my group of 12 wanted to eat here on a Friday night, considering it's a large group I decided to call ahead and reserve. So YES, they do reserve seats (since we're a large group, it took a little over an hour from the time I called to when we were actually seated) but they prefer if it's at least called in 24 hours ahead of time. First time I've heard of that at BJs. TVs GALORE. At least no one was bored. I'm used to my table's food coming out all together but I guess since it was a Friday night it came in pairs. My friend actually missed his food when it came and only noticed when everybody else got theirs. Drinks were good. Waitress was helpful. Food was still warm. Free birthday dessert, yay! I just wish we didn't have to wait so long, but I expected it."
Rachel T.,"Pasadena, CA",61,39,68,1.0,12/29/2011,"My sister Charlene C. pretty much said it all... ""The first time we dined here a month ago during was fairly pleasant. We all ordered the Unlimited Soup & Salad lunch special and our male server was very friendly and on top of things. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes and my husband had at least 4 bowls of soup and 2 salads.  At first I was kind of surprised with the low ratings... but NOW I know why. ============================================= TODAY I came with the same group of people and it was our second time dining in at this particular BJs together. We left very unsatisfied and still hungry!   Checked in at 11:10am  Checked out at 12:08pm IN A NUTSHELL:  ===================== SLOW service. We pretty much sat there for an hour and all we got was 3 small salads and a flat bread pizza. Clam chowder was cold and chicken noodle soup had hair in it. LONG STORY:  ===================== This is what occured during this unpleasant hour... The host was nice and walked us to our table, and pointed us to their lunch menu and other specials.Other than our table, there were only 2 other parties in the whole restaurant.  ORDERED: Three orders of unlimited soup and salad and one order of flat bread pizza. (Party of 4)  The Caesar salads came out 12 minutes after we put our order in. They were pretty bare and needed more dressing.  After everyone ate their salads, we all sat there for 25 minutes staring at each other. Where is the soup? Can we get another round of salads?? During this whole time, we never saw our female server. She basically took our drink orders and disappeared. The only time she resurfaced when we were all sitting there with no food on the table and took the empty salad plates away. At this point, my meal didn't even come out yet. My flat bread & salad came out at 11:50am. I just sat there for a good 40 minutes with no food. Another party sat next to us and they received all their food before we did. When we got our first round of soup, my husband's clam chowder was cold. He asked the food runner if he could take it back and bring a hot bowl of soup and another salad (which never came out). My sister only ate a few spoonfuls before finding  a hair in her chicken noodle soup.  We just wanted to get out of there and go somewhere else to eat. This was taking WAY TOO LONG for soup & salad. (The last time we were here, it was a lot busier and we were in and out pretty quick). My husband told her, he wanted to cancel his order and informed her about the hair in my sister's soup. Our female server told us she was going to get the manager, but no one ever came to our table. She just dropped off our bill and ran away without saying a word. We had to go to the front desk to ask for the manager, because we shouldn't have to pay the full price if all they ate were 3 small salads.  My sister and husband were still hungry! Called the manager and without eye contact  to any of us, he took the other two meals off the bill, we only paid for drinks and the flat bread pizza.  We ended up across the street to eat at Chipotle!!!!!   CONCLUSION: =============== Sorry, I love BJ's, but won't be back to this one after this experience."""
Jaclyn H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",28,58,1,2.0,4/7/2014,"Well, my boyfriend always raves about BJS, and what happens as soon as he takes me here? It goes south. We were invisible to our waiter. We had to flag him down to get utensils! And my boyfriend had to flag him down again for A1 and ketchup. Also, his burger was wrong. My chicken parm was fine but the service was very meh, too bad the pazookis will probably make me come back when I have a whomping craving for one of those delicious little suckers!"
Lauren S.,"Falls Church, VA",73,324,24,2.0,1/6/2012,"Ughhhhh service is soooooo slooowwwwwww. Arrived at 7:30pm on Thursday night and didn't get our entrees until 9:15. Thank goodness we ordered some appetizers. We were doted upon with water and drink service, but I was STARVING by the time the food came out. Service wasn't particularly friendly either. The dark beer wasn't stout enough, and oddly sweet too boot. I liked the berry cider, but it's a total girl drink- like martinellis crossed with fruit punch. I like the buffalo wings, and the pizza never fails. The food is unexciting but reliable."
Julie M.,"Sylmar, Los Angeles, CA",15,21,5,2.0,2/8/2014,"So my waitress seemed as if she didn't like her job, took forever with the drinks and almost impossible to get a refill. We felt as though we were bothering her when asking for something . The house salad was ok and the clam chowder was great! To end the night a white chocolate macadamia nut pazookie  halfway threw found a hair. The waitress took it off the bill but informed me that she thinks one of the cooks does it on purpose because it happens a lot :("
Tim T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,,1.0,10/15/2015,"The WORST service ever!!!  When asking a server for more water, and she can't even fill both glasses (WTF?)...I would say that she needs service 101 again!!!!  My husband and I have tried on 3 separate occasions, thinking it was us.........never have had a service worth coming back for!!  Will never eat here again!  After looking at all the other reviews, we are not alone!  You would think that the corporate office would come in and clean house........everyone needs training here!"
G. S.,"Castaic, CA",43,82,141,1.0,11/10/2013,"Such slow service and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. The manager was super nice and apologized but after an hour wait, we just told her to make it to go. Won't be back."
Rosemary H.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",3,27,5,4.0,6/10/2014,My husband loves the beer. They have a new seasonal beer hopped schotch? Don't remember the name but he loved it
Laura T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",60,19,7,2.0,10/18/2011,"I generally love this restaurant chain.  It has a lot of different options and we can always find something here to split.  It was our go-to place in college to split a pizza, salad and have beer during a game.   Out of the 5 locations I've been to, this one just sucks.  I feel like it's run by lazy kids. The last 3 or 4 times we've been there, we've waited over an hour.  The last time we said never again.  We had called ahead, were told to come in 30 minutes to be seated.  When we showed up, we waited an additional 45 minutes for a seat.   They kept telling us, 5 more minutes, 5 more minutes.  When we spoke to the manager, he thanked us for helping him figure out wait times and blamed the host up front for doing a bad job.  I blame poor management for repeated bad service and long wait times.  I feel like they do that 5 more minute routine to keep people from leaving.   I'd much rather drive to Palmdale or Burbank because we could probably drive there, get seated and eat before being seated at Valencia.  Sure it's a popular place but they are just incredibly disorganized too."
Angela C.,"San Diego, CA",156,124,110,2.0,9/25/2011,"FIRST restaurant that I've EVER walked out from, including many of my friends that I went with. Group of 6, waited 20-25 minutes to be seated, not too bad. Everything was going well so far, the decorations and atmosphere was clean. UNTIL we finally got seated.. 15 minutes later.. Angry angry faces. Not even one waiter acknowledged that we even existed yet. No hello, No ""may i take your order?"" or even ""may i get you some drinks"" NOTHING. And we even had 3 waitresses pass by us. We were just chatting, but we all already picked our orders while we were waiting outside, so we looked plenty ready. After a long tiring hungry day at Six Flags, we just wanted a nice meal, but we finally got fed up and left. It wasn't until we finally left that someone said hi to us. Maybe they're finally acknowledging us cause they're happy to serve less people? hmmm idk how that works. We ended up going to Chipotle near by, way better service, awesome food. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars for this place is because my friend politely called in a complaint to the manager who offered us a gift card to BJs (since we're not from Valencia). So at least we got something. Not sure how much the gift card is for.."
Bridget B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/27/2015,"Probably the worst meal I have ever had, not to mention the poor service. I ordered a pizza (not easy to mess up) and it tasted awful. Some of the ingredients in the menu were missing and the appearance was very unappetizing. I could only force myself to eat one slice. My friend got the Alfredo pasta and she described the noodles as hard, old and as if the dish was microwaved. Waiter was ok. Not very attentive. Definitely won't be coming back. If you're looking a for a tasty lunch or dinner, Santa Clarita has a lot better to offer."
Daniel C.,"Kirkland, WA",103,44,18,4.0,4/27/2014,"Not sure why the reviews are not better, great pizza deep or hand tossed. Brewed beer is excellent!"
Rosario H.,"Valencia, CA",0,12,6,1.0,8/16/2015,Very disappointed. It was our 15 ye old bday and pazooie did not have a candle and it was a small one when we ordered a bid one. It was a female server
Jim G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,74,,4.0,5/19/2014,"BJ's R&B is an affordable place to comfortably eat and drink. The menu is about 27 pages in length (slight exaggeration), and the BJ's beer selection is not too shabby, as I like the Piranha Ale. The Parmesan crusted chicken and the Moroccan salmon are tasty choices. Knowing that BJ's is a near-the- mall chain restaurant, one should not expect it to be five star dining in Dubai."
R C.,"Los Angeles, CA",528,70,108,2.0,1/19/2015,"Late night snack last night. We shared a deep-dish pizza. Almost NO sauce on it, so, although it DID hit the spot, being ""food""...as it was....it didn't really fit the description of 'pizza'...and we've HAD quite a few pizzas at BJs over the years as late night meals, given our schedules. We will try it again. Last night just not one of their cook's better nights making deep-dish. Stay tuned."
Joel P.,"Canyon Country, CA",37,19,1,3.0,9/12/2014,"Wish I could give it a better rating because BJ's food is always amazing. However the service here is extremely slow. The employees are friendly enough, it just seems that are too few of them to deal with the amount of people that come here. The food always takes forever. When it starts taking less than 15 minutes to refill a drink, I'll give it more stars."
Jennifer R.,"Santa Clarita, CA",25,10,4,2.0,1/4/2014,"Not going back here again. Service was horrible. It took 15 mins. to get our drinks and almost an hour for the food. The place was not busy at all.. Even the family next to us were complaining. We asked for the Happy Hour menu and our server responded ""I don't think we have one"" when in fact they did. Food was OK but miscommunication with the staff was frustrating. There are plenty of other decent restaurants here in SCV that want our business."
Anthony P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",23,9,6,2.0,10/3/2011,"You know what you are going to get at BJ's, because you've probably been to one if you live in any city large enough to have a mall. The food is usually good. But the last two times I've been here, the service has been absolutely abominable, and the only way I will return is if I am ordering take out or my grandparents are celebrating a birthday here. A quick re-cap of our last trip. Order placement: Went pretty smoothly, except the waitress returned 10 minutes later and asked us about part of our order because she couldn't read what she had written down. We straightened it out... at least we thought we did on our end.  Order delivery: Took a while. And by a while I mean more than 30 minutes for food to get to the table. This was on a Sunday evening and the restaurant had a lot of open tables. When the food began to come out, the order was wrong several times.  1) My wife and I had ordered an appetizer to split, and they brought us two. Not a huge deal, but indicative of the mess that was about to unfurl.  2) My wife and I had ordered two different salads, and they brought us the same one. It took another five minutes to come back with the right salad. 3) We had four kids with us, and they delivered two of the kids food, and it was seven minutes before the food for the other two kids came out. For those of you with young kids, you can imagine how this played out with the two who didn't have food. It would have been better if they just delivered all of the food at the same time.  4) My friend ordered soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. For those of you who have dabbled in the culinary arts, you know that soup and grilled cheese ranks right up there with peanut butter and jelly in terms of time it takes to prepare. When the food was delivered to the table, everyone (over the course of seven minutes) received their food except for my friend. Our waitress asked if everyone had received their food, and we pointed out the missing grilled cheese sandwich and soup. ""They are running a little behind in the kitchen tonight,"" she said. ""I'll be right back."" And she was. 12 minutes later. The rest of us had finished our meal, and it was all I could do to prevent my friend from nibbling on my arm. On the plus side, we all got a chance to experience what it might look like for a wolverine to consume soup and a grilled cheese.  Paying for the food: So at this point we've been in the restaurant for over an hour, and we have four kids, all under 7, ready to head out. We ask for the bill. ""No problem,"" says the waitress. ""I'll bring it right back.""  My friend and I told our wives they could get the kids loaded up in the car, and we'd pay the bill and be right out. And we were, almost 40 minutes later.  Quick recap: 1) Waitress drops off bill and walks away. My buddy and I pull out our cards and put the folder on the edge of the table. Waitress takes drink order at the next table (8 people) glances our way, and then leaves to enter their drinks in the computer.  2) She is gone for maybe ten minutes or so. She begins to walks back. We hold up the folder. She nods. And then proceeds to take the orders for two different tables of people. One table had 6 people. One had 8. These were tables full of hungry, inquisitive diners who had a myriad of probing questions. This takes 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, my friend stands up a couple of times and waves the folder at her. We also begin to get up and take it to the front desk. She stops us and indicates she will be with us momentarily.  3) She rushes over after taking the 14 orders, and apologizes profusely saying that she had to take the orders. We noticed. She picks up our folder and goes over to the register. Phew, we're finally getting out of here right? Wrong. Another 10 minutes later, we are still waiting on our bill. Why? She had to deliver the drinks to two tables, because they were up. About halfway into this go around of Held Hostage by Our BJ's Waitress, my friend gets up and tries to find a manager. We literally JUST WANTED TO GO HOME. Our wives are texting us and asking if we're okay. The waitress spots my friend and waves the bill at him with a big smile on her face. ""Everything is fine here, be with you in just a minute.""  4) Finally she comes back and drops off the bill for our signature. ""Sorry, I had to put the food orders in,"" she explains. It was horrible. My friend and I literally expected someone to pop out from behind a curtain with a camera and tell us that we were on some new hidden camera show where they try to incite people into a violent tantrum. No such luck.  Recap: Decent food. Horrendous service. But they always have a line out the door, so I don't think they are too concerned about it. Judging by the reviews on here, and the many complaints about service, it's not going to change anytime soon. I wish they'd change to an Ed DeBevic's model where the service is supposed to be rude and bad, at least that way they'd be up front about it."
