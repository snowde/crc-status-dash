Sara L.,"Granada Hills, CA",2,11,2,3.0,6/12/2017,"The food is amazing here, however the service not so much. I've come to this location twice on a Friday night and a Tuesday night and both times they seemed understaffed. The first time we got the fish tacos and a burger. Both were delicious!! Second time we got the same fish tacos but they forgot the nacho chips on the side and utensils!! We asked the waitress to bring us some utensils and the chips, she left and came back 15min later with the side of chips that was much smaller than what we had the first time. We still had no utensils so we asked another male waiter who eventually brought us some even though we were almost done eating at that point.  This place would've definitely gotten 5 stars for food but the service needs some work."
Yvonne B.,"Camarillo, CA",0,22,1,2.0,9/15/2017,"As a recent employee of the bjs restaurant (Westlake village) i was really not pleased at all with my experience here. The staff was really unfriendly. I ordered take out after a long day at six flags. I live in camarillo so i wanted something good for the drive home. My boyfriend ordered the bjs favorite 9"" pizza they said it was getting boxed up. The pizza was cold and stale. Not appetizing at all. And i had ordered the parmesan crusted chicken. My food was cold the vegetables were so soggy they fell apart and i literally didn't get any mashed potatoes at all. That's a second main portion of this dish and they are so cheap or forgetful to literally not give me any ! Doesn't help it was to go because when i called the manager had me on hold so long they hung up on me. I wanted a full refund but got treated poorly. Will not be returning here if im ever in town again."
S O.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",2,118,155,1.0,9/23/2017,"Wow by far the worse waiting time ever !! Waited 30 min to get our order taken. I been here sooo many times.. I have never experienced such horrible wait time.. I can't blame the servers At all, I blame management and corporate!! Our food order was wrong, it took forever to get our food and order taken.. idk what happen to this place, extremely disappointed!!"
Ronicka S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/12/2017,I arrived at 2:00pm and didn't get sat until 2:50 and all they had to do is put two tables together. Mind you the restaurant WAS NOT busy! When the waitress came she asked for the drinks we wanted and we we asked to order food she refused! We thought she took 10 minutes to bring out water because it was a 10 people party but a whole other person brought us out drinks!!!! We had to be somewhere in an hour and a half and it took us that long to be seated! ON A SLOW DAY!!  It's was simply unacceptable they made me never want to go back to this BJ's and you shouldn't either!!!
Patricia P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,76,5.0,4/29/2017,"Such a cool place, it's like other BJ restaurant and the service is really good. I bought the strawberry splash and it was so good. Parking is super easy because there's mall parking."
Brandis H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",124,55,4,3.0,8/27/2017,"Food is decent, service usually isn't. Something always goes wrong or is forgotten or takes three times as long to come out as it should. So go in expecting that and you won't be dissatisfied. Cost is decent as well and they're adding in all these specialty days for discounted pizzas pizookies etc."
Anne D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,52,,1.0,12/27/2017,"I have been so patient with this restaurant and given them a chance so many times.  But today, I just had it!  The service is slow, staff appear to not care much, and very uninformed.  The food is not prepared properly and the company discount - well it takes forever to apply on the bill. This time I ordered a salad (chopped salad) a $12.00 dollar salad which came out looking like a side salad with a very small portion.  When I asked why was it so small, the woman took it back to the kitchen only for them to add a few pieces of lettuce on top.  Keep in mind this was a chopped salad, but the pieces of lettuce were huge on top of the salad.  I had also left the chicken out, you would think there will be a discount for that, which many places give me a discount for leaving the meat out, but not here.  After spending 15 minutes to pick up my food that I had already ordered online, was just very frustrating.  I am fixing an order each time I stop by to pick up my food.  I am just tired of doing that.  So instead I will not go back again.  You used to be good, but NO MORE!"
Josie D.,"Valencia, CA",12,27,8,2.0,8/20/2017,"What a terrible experience honestly... we came in after 10pm and the host made a point of telling us it was happy hour in the bar area so we headed their. It took forever to get service and the food totally tasted like the end of the night leftovers... the root beer glazed ribs were hardly chewable and their BJ burger was DRY! The waitress did Not even ask how we wanted it cooked.. then she took our dessert plate along with the other entree plates before we were done eating it and I had to go get it back and she remarked ""oh glad it was on the top of the stack!"" Then last but certainly not least she charged us full price instead of happy hour price (50% less). Had to get it refunded and then recharged... never coming back here again."
Shemommy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,80,2,2.0,8/29/2017,"I used to love going to BJs to hang out and have a drink with friends here but lately, the drink choices have diminished and not a whole lot of a selection. Last couple of times they were out of a certain beers. This is a brewhouse and I believe should not be out of beer.  Although I still go here from time to time I do order something else but it wasn't what I wanted nor my first choice. I wait to get seated for a long time just to be disappointed with the limited selection of drinks."
Pico C.,"Burbank, CA",0,33,14,1.0,1/8/2017,"This place has gone down the drain! 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us. 16 minutes to get our waters/drinks. Once they finally got our order in and brought it, it was wrong. SHOCKER! Waited an additional 15 minutes because ""the kitchen is backed up."" Bill came and the server had the audacity to charge me for the returned order. A quick stop for two simple orders of appetizers turned into an hour long trip. Insane!"
Armida R.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",18,5,,2.0,11/29/2017,"On 11/28/17 a party of 23 met at BJ to celebrate my son's birthday. The serve was not over 2 stars, due to the fact for having 23 guest we only had one waiter's Our waiter's did the best she could. Twenty three guest is too many people to serve for one person. I order a beer the beer was not the one I had order, BJ serve's only tap beer, I have a strong feeling the dispenser was connected to the wrong keg. I ask the waitress if I could order a bottle beer she apologies went on to inform me BJ only carry's Heineken light, I inform the waiter that would ok, I just can't believe BJ's does not carry a selection in bottle beer as a backup. Our meal were order I had order a medium well and received well done, at this point i did not complain, I just felt bad for our waitress. This review is not a reflection of our waitress it BJ. Management."
Chad C.,"Glendale, CA",30,3,,2.0,11/29/2017,"Hello, we visited BJ's on Sunday 11/27/17, and the service was really bad. We did the call ahead seating and were seated right after arriving. The table we were placed had direct A/C air on it and very low lighting, forcing us to use our phone lights to see the menus. Our waitress was servicing the neighboring tables and did not greet us. We flagged her down to ask about the air and possibly adjusting the A/C. She said she would check and then asked for our drink order. She told us a particular tea was hot (which we wanted) which it turned out was wrong as it came out on ice. She then walked away and vanished. Then 15 minutes went by and she did not return nor deliver our drinks. I walked to the hostess and told them we were not getting any service and they said they would take care of it. A few minutes after, a new waitress came by and asked if she could take our order for food. We said we had not received our drinks yet. She said sorry and took our drink order. Then she walked away and the 1st server arrived at our table and said, ""I thought you all had left"", as though that was the reason she never returned with our drinks. We said all we did was moved to the table next to us which had much better light and no direct A/C. After that, my wife went to talk to the manager. We then saw the manager talking to his staff. He stopped by our table and said sorry for the slow service as they were under staffed. We replied saying the server said she thought we had left just we only moved one table over. So that was not true but he decided to ignore that point. He said he was taking care of things for us. So we got our corrected drinks and food just the sweet potato fries were cold, the wings were supposed to have sauce just they had dry rub seasoning on them. The wait staff obviously needs to know the menus better and take care of their customers better. Also was surprised that the manager did not return after to make sure everything was good. Bad management. He did pay for our desert and removed the fries and wings from the bill. Just not good enough to change our opinion about the bad service."
J F.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",0,88,7,3.0,8/31/2017,"Food is decent. Love their salmon, huge portion. But I really wanted to comment on my annoying experiences ordering takeout. Here's the routine: When picking up order, the person at the takeout register has to go find the server that took my order. Why is that necessary? 10 minutes wasted. When the server finally shows up, I show them my online discount on my iPhone, received via email or Facebook. Apparently only a manager can process a discount. So the server runs off looking for the manager to process the discount. Another 10 minutes wasted. Seriously? They don't trust their employees enough to process discounts on their own.  So the pickup process should take 1-2 minutes but actually was 20 minutes. This has happened multiple times. Very annoying. I order takeout when I'm in a hurry but BJ's silly procedures waste a lot of time."
Matt M.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,2,,1.0,9/27/2017,"I love BJ's but unfortunately will not be coming as a customer any longer. This past Friday I went out with my wife for dinner. We ordered our food and had to wait 30 minutes for our food to arrive. I can understand with it being a busy Friday night, but for my wife to receive her food COLD after waiting that long was just a big disappointment. We mentioned the issue to the server and the manager came over and offered us a complimentary salad, which was a nice gesture. He stated that my wife's dish would be re-made and ready at a much faster speed. That was not the case. We did not receive her re-made dish for another 30 minutes, and by that time, the two of us were ready to leave. Unfortunately the quality in service in the making of the dish just messed up the course of our meal together.  But the reason I am writing this review is not just because of this one incident. I came to BJs on Sunday of the same week for a birthday party and received the same poor service. Our waiter was nice, but again, the food was not made correctly. I had ordered a BBQ chicken pizza and specifically asked for certain toppings to not be put on the pizza, but all requests I made for those toppings to be left out were disregarded.  I can understand one instance go wrong and that's life. Once incident to take place would not cause me to not want to come to BJs again. But twice in a matter of a few days just left a bad taste in my mouth."
Dean P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",114,808,3351,4.0,6/25/2017,"BJs staff came thru. I came to BJs to book a table for a party of 12 for my daughter's 15th birthday. I booked it about a week before the date and I'm glad I did. When I showed up on a Friday night for our 6:30 reservation the wait was an hour and ten minutes but I was seated within 5 minutes. Thank Gawd. Staff was great , food was great too. The kiddos had pizza, of course, but I had a quinoa and shrimp bowl which was incredibly tasty. Anyways, thanks BJs for coming thru and getting me on the road with 12 teenagers to make our show."
Cory G.,"Newhall, CA",6,46,4,5.0,3/2/2017,"So like there's this waiter chick named Sydney who's really cute, this comment is for her :) she was the real MVP. Thanks ^____^ Cheers"
Gary T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,4,7,3.0,4/14/2017,"I've been coming here for years the food is great the bar staff are awesome but ffs turn the bloody AC down!  I normally bring a sweat shirt because no matter what time of year you freeze at the bar.  I would understand if the place was packed because off people body heat but this is ridiculous.   Somebody please talk to the Manger he's costing you a small fortune.  I'll definitely be back ""With my jacket"""
James T.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/27/2017,"Asked for marinara sauce five times. Got it and it was cold. Asked for chicken bacon ranch pizza, got supreme. It got fixed about fifteen minutes later. Marinara sauce still hadn't arrived. Nothing was taken off the check. No apologies. Nothing. Worst experience I've ever had at a BJ's. Whoever was closing server this night, Sunday the 26th of November should not close anymore. That dude could not give a FUCK."
Gaby L.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,10,1,2.0,7/9/2017,"I'm going to start off by saying that my family and I LOVE BJ's. Today was our first time visiting this location since we just happened to be at the mall and got hungry. The food we ordered was fantastic. However, I'm giving this location two stars because the service here was terrible. I've never experienced this before in any of the other BJ's I've visited. I don't want to put the waiter on blast because maybe he was having an off-day or perhaps he was dealing with difficult customers (who knows)...but let's call him M. M greeted us nicely as soon as we sat down, he asked for our drinks. We quickly received our drinks and then he asked for our order. We weren't ready yet so he left to give us more time. Fine right? Well, he gave us too much time...we were waiting patiently for him to assist us however he was nowhere to be seen. Every time we needed M - he was either nowhere to be seen OR helping out other customers and quickly leaving. I tried raising my hand to get his attention (I didn't want to have to do that, but we've been waiting for too long). When that didn't work, I  stood up to try to get his attention! & when that didn't work, I would finally ask another waiter/waitress for what we wanted. To give you an idea, we waited about 30 mins to order our food and another 30 mins after eating to ask for our check. The restaurant wasn't even busy and in my opinion, it was over staffed. Ridiculous. The employees were unprofessional by walking together and huddling over by the registers/corners to gossip. I really don't want to hear about so and so's girlfriend being rude through text and what they did for the weekend -- while I'm trying to eat dinner with my family. We heard most of their conversations than our own. It's upsetting that while we needed assistance from M, there was literally a group of 5-6 employees hanging out in front of us laughing and talking. Regardless, I love BJ's, but I definitely won't recommend this location. It's a shame because it's  by the Valencia mall and I really wanted to enjoy my visit. However, the service was awful."
Eri W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,38,22,1.0,12/28/2016,"I've been to this location multiple times and there have been a few things that bring down the rating. During one visiting the bartender and waiter were throwing items at each other. One of the items almost hit me, but they continued throwing stuff. The reason I wrote a review today is...my sister and I came here at 3pm. Our waiter took our drink order and we already knew what starter salad we wanted, but we were going to order entrees. The waiter dropped off our drinks and another brought our salads. Then the waiter disappeared. Another waiter came over after we had finished our salads and asked for our menus to give to another table. 45 minutes went by and we hadn't seen our original waiter and the waiter that had taken over the section hadn't checked on us. We decided to leave but had to go to the host to speak to manager. She resolved the issue, but the service was horrid."
