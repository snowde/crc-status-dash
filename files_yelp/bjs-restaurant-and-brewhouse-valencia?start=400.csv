Thane P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",220,27,2,2.0,12/28/2013,"So far waitress great, bathroom discussing. I reported it so lets see what happens!  Moving on, I had to get up 3 times to find the waitress and the 25.00 pizza was just room temp.  Nothing spectacular.  However, the place was packed!"
Susan D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/16/2015,"I'm offering this review as constructive feedback, because most people would say a lot worse than what I'm about to say.  I recently visited with my daughter, about 6 weeks ago, and that was my first visit there in about 6 months.  The last time I was there, 6 months ago, the service was terrible, slow, and very disappointing - in fact, my family and I did not even stay.  This time, our server had more of a personality, but it seems like the management assigns servers too many tables.  I can tell you this because I rarely saw our server.  Things still take forever to come out - even drink orders.  I find it perplexing and disturbing that there has been zero change in terms of service efficiency in the course of 6 + months.  The food is ok, but it doesn't stand out."
Nick C.,"Cambridge, MA",20,21,,2.0,8/30/2011,"I'm going to make this short.  I went in and was seated in about 5 minutes.  Then 15 minutes went by without the waiter coming to our table (though he visited other tables).  I tried to flag him down, he said ""just a minute"", and disappeared for about 5 minutes.  We left after waiting long enough. I'm giving Bjs two stars instead of one because I've had neutral experiences with the restaurant in the past, but this last visit was unacceptable."
Jennifer G.,"Mission Hills, Los Angeles, CA",26,19,26,2.0,11/2/2013,"We got there last night, it wasn't busy at all. We picked a seat at the bar and I soon regretted it as it took the waitress about 15 minutes to finally bring us menus and take our drink order. After that it was just a very slow night, the slowest service ever received there. We come here quite often but after last nights service I don't know."
Jane C.,"Sylmar, CA",446,12,2,1.0,5/24/2011,"Friday night 7pm.. table for 3 ppl 20-25 min wait... totally wait-able!  sat down.. got our menus.. server was nice.. took our order and our 3 drinks (beer on tap, cantelope martini, 7 flights of beer)  30 mins later.. WHERE ARE OUR DRINKS? WHERE's our appetizers? Service is supppper slow here... yes i might be unfair bc i went on a friday night but waiting 30 mins for a beer on tap is totally unacceptable.. really??  pro: tv's all around the restaurant!  cons: slow service, bad service.. I am not coming to this BJ's no more. goodbye!"
Coño G.,"Valencia, CA",1,88,23,1.0,7/1/2013,"After years of boycotting the place, we decided to give it a try after leaving the movie theater. The place looks great after all the renovations but it's really sad that food and service didn't equally match-up to the fresh look of the place. We ordered the ahi poke which was bland and didn't taste like poke at all. The avocado eggrolls were mushy and nothing special. The mahi fish tacos reeked of old rotten fish and were unedible. Lastly, the pizookie was over baked and tasted burnt. Our waitress was completely out of it, absent, and not once asked how the food was. Sorry to the owners of BJ's- I really wanted to like you again but I'm afraid I'm back to boycotting the place. Oh and please talk to your staff about how to pronounce items on the menu...it's'poke-ey' not poke as in poke you in the eye."
Viv S.,"Valencia, CA",7,51,,4.0,2/12/2012,"I've always had a pleasant experience during the weekend rush. It's a generic chain restaurant with a ton of choices and always delicious pizookie. I prefer the bar section for quick service while watching a game. I really like the small bites menu so you can feel like you're not over indulging too much. But, be warned of the usual Santa Clarita weekend crowds. And know you're going to wait for one thing or another."
Steve M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",37,46,23,4.0,2/7/2012,I love the deep dish pizzas here. You can build your own with whatever toppings you want on it. Last time there I had barbecue chicken deep dish pizza. Excellent! Very satisfying. We finished off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie for dessert.  I have always had decent service at this location. It does take time to get the food out to you at times. Order a salad or appetizer if you are starving. Televisions all over the place make any wait go by fast.
Kyle W.,"El Segundo, CA",96,58,3,3.0,9/8/2013,"The service can be crappy here. Long waits on waiters and online order pickups, but no complaints about the food."
Justin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",564,31,8,3.0,1/4/2012,"BJ's is BJ's. The Pizookies are great, the pizzas and salads always deliver and everything else on the menue is hit or miss.  I got their limited ""Black & Bleu"" burger and it definitely fit the title. Heavily charred meat and what seemed like an ice cream scoop of bleu cheese on it. I ate half and took the other half home. The fries were cold upon receiving them at our table, too. It was a busy night (big crossover crowding from the mall) but that wasn't an excuse for our waiter to give us bare minimum service. He's human, I get it. But he was forgetful. I caught him looking over at our empty table about 20 minutes after we put in our order and watched him run back into the kitchen to immediately emerge with our dishes.  It was a good night, though! The pizooke, as always, wrapped things up perfectly."
Michelle M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,12,4,1.0,9/29/2013,The service was really terrible. At first we waited 10 min before anyone came to our table. It wasn't until after someone came that we got water 10 min later.. And both waiters who dealt with us were rude and actually walked away in the middle of talking to them. Not the best food or service..
Anton E.,"Los Angeles, CA",427,1153,670,5.0,1/13/2012,"pizza, pizookie, friends, !! that is pretty much the sum and enough to be said about Bjs! but i will re-iterrate a bit more the pizza is always so stomach stuffing! full of toppings of your choice, extra cheesey, cooked to the crust perfectly crispy, and all so good at a great price! then their is the pizookie!! usually a party platter for 4 of us, $20.61 exact, usually a choice of 4 flavors, but we decided to get all chocolate chip!! and topped with vanilla bean ice cream, you will die, go to heaven, and be reincarnated in the same spot to keep indulging! i am done :)"
Matthew B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,7,,5.0,3/9/2014,"Our waitress was awesome! Best yet, great with kids, even played hide n seek, how cool is that! Working manager was really nice and very professional! Can't wait to come back :)"
Kevin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",305,130,14,4.0,7/7/2011,"In brief: Thai lettuce shrimp wrap, superb. Beer selection, varied. Sampler of all 8 for less than 12 bucks. Hefeweissen and red ale are ones to check out. My fiancée's Asian stir fry was great; too much scallion for her. My mini pizza was excellent--and I'm from NY. Service friendly, ask for Tim."
Julie O.,"Santa Clarita, CA",62,36,2,4.0,12/3/2011,"Predictable, wide variety of menu selections, food has been reliably tasty and fresh. The bazooka dessert thing is unbelievably indulgent and fun.  The location is convenient with covered parking nearby and being adjacent to the mall and the movie theater.   The service is usually decent but sometimes slow.  Slower during lunch so be warned if you're in a hurry.   Great for whole family. Our 3 yr old is super picky so if he's not in the mood for what's on the kid's movie there's plenty of alternatives.  Tonight he was thoroughly satisfied with the personal sized cheese pizza minus the tomato chunks.  Which reminds me, they're very accommodating when you want or need changes to standard menu items.  The teriyaki chicken was really good, a bit sweet for my taste, but they happily added broccoli upon my request when I ordered.   I love that I know what I'm getting any time I go to a BJ's. :)"
c K.,"Newhall, CA",0,9,,2.0,11/9/2014,I have eaten here in the past. Today I was disgusted looking at the filthy caution sign right where I sat . It was warning patrons about a wet spot on the floor.
Kyle S.,"Fullerton, CA",133,195,58,4.0,12/5/2011,"This review relates to only the pizookie and the service.  Both of these were amazing.  We ordered three of the mini pizookies, the red velvet, the peanut butter, and the chocolate chocolate.  All three of these were delicious and I cannot believe that I waited so long to try one of these.  I have heard that the normal food isn't the greatest but I will be back here even if it is just for dessert and their famously delicious pizookie."
Heather S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,17,,1.0,5/14/2015,The food here is barely paletable but worst of all...the drinks here suck!!! My martini had more than ice chips in it like big ice chunks and very week.  Jon Taffer would throw the drink back at them and say start over!  Don't waste your time here
Jim B.,"Marietta, GA",60,86,10,3.0,8/24/2013,"Food is good, the service is terrible. 4 of us went and two orders were completely wrong. In fact several things were wrong! Manager did apologize, but he did not seem to worried about it."
Lynda F.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,35,3,2.0,7/23/2013,"Do they check their Yelp feedback? It doesn't look like it. The service ranges from ok to just plain bad.   I called in an order for lunch and went in for pickup.  I was tight on time so was, admittedly, a little anxious.  The 3 people at the host stand were chatting while the 2 people handling to-go orders were on the phone. So I wait since the host stand people don't do anything other than host, apparently. One of the to-go people gets off the phone and finally greets me. I ask for the order and tell him that I am tight on time. Apparently he can get my food but not ring it up so I wait again for his to-go partner to finish the phone call. She does and tells me that she'll be right back to help me. I am waiting again.  Food is finally paid for but not handed to me so I have to reach back almost behind the register for the drink. The 'ringer' seemed more like I was bothering her by having come in than anything. No greeting, no smile, no 'have a nice day' - nothing other than 'sign the top and keep the bottom.'  Wow - moving huh? Having 4-5 people around the area and feeling completely unwelcome is not ok. I like the food but the service just sucks. If it was the first time, I'd probably not have added my 2c here but it's not. Come on BJ's - get your act together. I may give it one more shot but it will be a while so today's lovely experience fades a bit. If its not better then,I'm done. Three strikes and YOU'RE OUT!"
