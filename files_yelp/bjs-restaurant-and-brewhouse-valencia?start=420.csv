Denton N.,"Santa Clarita, CA",25,51,19,2.0,4/17/2013,"This Bj's is terrible. Their food is good and beer is good, but the service and management are terrible. Servers are rude and slow and if you complain the management doesn't care because they are all friends. This place is really bad with big parties as well. Only go to this location if there is no where else to go, or you don't care about service."
Katie T.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,11,6,1.0,8/24/2013,"Our server was over worked. The place was way under staffed for a Saturday afternoon. I ordered salmon, rice and steamed vegetables. The salmon looked ok but the rice was stuck together and burnt as if it was scraped off the bottom of a pot. The worst thing was the steamed vegetables, they were shriveled dry and discolored. I think they had been cooked over and over again for a few days. Looking back I wish that I had taken a photo of the disgusting looking food they wanted to serve me. The manager took no responsibility and was insincere with his apology. I don't even think he looked at my food. They offered us free stuff but that is not the point.  I will never return."
Frank F.,"Lancaster, CA",0,49,6,2.0,3/20/2015,"The food was ok but the service was horrible.  It took over 30 minutes to get our lunch brought to us once they finally took our order and they weren't very busy.  One of the food runners had a bad attitude and was careless.  He drops off a salad and walks away without a word and an annoyed look on his face.  Had he cared about his job, he'd have gotten us some silverware to eat the salad with but he's just a ""food runner"" right?  Did someone force him to work as a food runner at gunpoint?  I hate people like that.  If you hate your job, that's your problem!  You shouldn't take it out on the customers.  Just guarantees he'll never be successful anywhere in life.  The waitress was ok and kind of nice but not apologetic at all for our food taking so long.  We wanted to go to Chipotle across the street and would have been done in 1/4 the time but we ran into some friends who asked us to join them at BJ's.  Big mistake!"
Charisse F.,"Valencia, CA",135,89,137,1.0,12/30/2010,"Service is so bad here.  We waited for a seat by the bar, and a snobby waitress came up to us and told us it wasn't open seating, with a tired attitude and fake smile, then she ran off. A couple seconds later another group who was waiting on a regular table, sat down and said they were so lucky to find something at the bar and returned their beeper. We went back to the waitress and she said she didn't know what we were talking about!! So we left. Horrible service! Another past time I was here a waitress decided to practice her Spanish on me... OK I'm Filipino, I was born here, I've given my order to you in perfect English, what makes you think you can say ""uh necess-sita uhh mas, agua??"" and wave an empty glass in the air. She's real special to single me out especially while with my group of (mixed) friends! BJ's, please do this whole community a favor and hire people with half a brain, or standard courtesy."
Liz T.,"Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, CA",249,216,120,3.0,9/12/2011,"Pretty much the everything on the menu is delish - from the beer to the appetizers to the pizzas...and the pizookies...nommmmmm... Even though the food here is always really yummy but the service is a hit or miss. I would not recommend coming here for lunch as you really don't have time to eat - even when you tell your server you are on a time limit.  So for dinner or a weekend lunch, BJ's is perfect! For for lunch, I will give it a pass and go to Salt Creek."
Jackie J.,"Valencia, CA",1,5,,1.0,3/24/2013,"We like the food; the portions are quite reasonable, as are the prices --- but the waitress was not at all attentive. Our meals came before our silverware. She left us without drink refills, then didn't take away the empties. We waited too long for the check, then too long for her to pick up the payment. One might think that our sitting on the patio had caused the less-than-indifferent service -- except that this has also been our experience when seated inside. The male server several months ago was even less attentive and less concerned with our needs. This evening, a nearby party of 12 or more were exceedingly loud and rude. As they finally got ready to leave, one of the diners dropped a large drink container on the tile floor.  Glass and ice flew everywhere. The servers were so scare that none of them heard the loud crash and nobody cleaned up the glass shards during the 20 minutes that we were waiting for our check. We never saw anyone who looked like a manager  checking on guest satisfaction and servers' performance. At one time, BJ's was our favorite local restaurant. The attractive setting helped make it our go-to spot for out-of-the area friends. We've eaten at BJ's dozens of time, but the last 3 visits were marred by horrible service. We think this evening was probably the last ."
Domanick L.,"Camarillo, CA",5,23,20,4.0,10/13/2013,"Chili is amazing. Wedge cut fries are as well. Try a PM Porter. if you're looking for a different pizza the buffalo chicken is really good, good atmosphere, way better than fridays."
Los A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3,14,34,5.0,1/10/2015,"matthew is very attentive, nice, he gets our orders correct, basically we had a great time as usual and yes we definitely recommend this branch and we would be more than happy to be back here :)"
Brian B.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,352,80,1.0,9/29/2010,"The food is always just alright. The service is always lacking and their beer sucks. For a brewery style restaurant the beer is just bad, i'd rather drink an American light beer and I hate American light beer. Watch out for busy nights because it will be like a sad high school reunion of all the people you always run into around town because you can't avoid them. ""Yea bro I do see you every single time I come here once a year which leads me to believe you are a regular and just strengthens the reasons I try to avoid you because it's pretty apparent that you have no taste."" Why do I always get the creepy, kinda greasy waiter? Why? Stop staring at the girls at the table. I don't have ugly friends for a reason, I don't like ugly people but just because you didn't learn manners in your cave it doesn't make it alright to outright eye rape the pretty girls."
Jasmin B.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,34,60,4.0,4/7/2011,"LOVE JEREMIAH RED!! Never really disappointed when I eat here, but never crazy impressed. Drink your dinner instead...haha!"
April T.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,60,5,4.0,8/24/2011,"Coming from the Northeast where one goes to John Harvard's for this kind of beer, and to the Cheesecake Factory for this kind of food, it's pretty awesome to have the best of both worlds in one place. That is to say, great upscale munchies, rockin' beer, and a grown-up root beer float that's pure genius.  Can't argue with that.  Add in one very attentive and personable waiter, and you can bet I'll be back."
Cathy W.,"Riverside, CA",58,14,22,3.0,3/3/2013,"My daughter works inside the restaurant industry as a server. I get to hear and see the inside perspective of what my daughter, and servers experience everyday inside the restaurant, that many customers are not aware of.  One of the biggest issues servers face, is proper gratuity from their tables.  Servers get paid minimum wage, but after taxes are taken out each week on their pay check, servers receive roughly $2.13 an hour. The server loves a party of 10 or more, since this means one thing to them, gratuity.   Recently Corporate at the restaurant of BJ's, (a well known establishment) decided to take away the built in gratuity of 17% for parties of 10 or more. This happened because there had been complaints that the gratuity is taxed as part of the food bill by the State of California.  Understandable the customer would be upset over this right?  Why should they pay tax on their tip?  So say a table has a $600 check, which is common with a table of 10, with %17 built in they have a gratuity of $102. This is a $10 per person tip because they spent $60 each on their meal, (alcohol is usually involved). If they have to pay tax on this check, it would amount to $8 extra.   Here is the point:   My daughter who is a server, since the removal of this 17% built in gratuity, should have received $114 last night on a check, but only received $14.50.  She also would have received $145 on the party before that, instead she received a crinkled up $5 bill. Working from 4:00 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. at night, she made $19.50 gratuity on sales of $1,300... If you do the math, over her entire evening she received 0.015% tips. A server has to tip out their bar, food runners, and bus boys 2% of their sales, and since gratuity has been taken away, my daughter can't even properly tip out her colleges let alone make any money herself. To top it off, for taxes, servers are required to claim a minimum of 12% of their sales each night at clock out, in order to be taken out of their paycheck for taxes, 12% of her sales would have been $156, not the $19.50 she received in gratuity. So who does gratuity really protect? The server, without the added in gratuity for parties works at the rate of a sweatshop worker. Last night coming home, my daughter stated ""We are servers, not servants."""
Bella D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,16,,4.0,2/5/2014,Went here for Super Bowl and sat at the bar. Our waiter at the bar that day was great. Food was fast and ok. The appetizers were great we had the focaccia pizza and the burger was ok. Was falling apart but edible. Anyways overall a good experience:)
Carli N.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,6,1,1.0,3/23/2015,"I'm usually not one to go out of my way to ""bad mouth"" anyone or anything. However, the service at this BJ's is ridiculous. I would recommend management does some serious evaluations on their staff. Out of the 20 years I have lived in Santa Clarita I have only met ONE server at BJ's that gave me good service. Why do I keep coming here you ask? The bar is nice, the food is good, and they are one of the few places out here open late. Let me tell you about my experiences.. The last time I visited BJ's my waitress came up to the table, did not even introduce herself, and with a sassy attitude said ""What do you want to drink?"" I wanted to be like ""Hi nice to meet you too..."" incredibly rude. When we ordered (40 minutes later I might add) My significant other asked the waitress what kind of salad dressings they had. She chuckled and responded with ""A lot."" that is it. She never went on to list dressings for him! After this experience one of my good friend's told me that she had a similar occurrence and came on yelp to write a review. Well, one of the server's I'm assuming, messaged her off yelp telling her how horrible of a person she was for writing a bad review and how she did not have a life. This is where people come to express their opinions on places and guess what BJ's...you guys have been horrible. If you read the other reviews on here you will see that there are very few ones that would make anyone confident in dining at this place. It is too bad that their management does not take the time to see how unhappy their customers are and try to make some changes about it. I agree with another review on here... BJ's out... Cheesecake Factory in please!"
Russell S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",3111,30,37,5.0,7/30/2012,"My recommendation is to sit at the bar top, Tabita is amazing!  Tabita will make you feel at home and comfortable. Amazing margaritas, amazing conversation and an amazing good time."
Elizabeth G.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,38,10,1.0,2/16/2013,The worst bar tending service ever.  Had to go next door  for a decent Manhattan.  Service is slow and food is not so great.  Its too bad. With a prime location you would think they would get it right! The management should be monitoring more closely.
Ashley K.,"Castaic, CA",73,28,8,1.0,9/14/2012,"This place is not even worth one star I had the worst culinary experience ever!!!!! In this establishment I've been to other Bj's and had a great experience but in this specific location I really had to hold back from completely losing my cool! I was dealing with incompetent imbeciles that not only screwed my food up once, not twice, not even three times but four!!!!! Dam times!!!!! I am lost for words for the audacity that was presented on a plate to me I would not belittle a homeless person with the crap that was served to me and I'm keeping it %100 not only was the food horrid the service was gruesome I would prefer the artificial mess served at mcdonalds right about now compared to this tasteless raw shit never will I be coming into this imposter Bj's ever again!"
Brian M.,"Temecula, CA",1,8,3,5.0,12/14/2013,"I love the BJ's in Temecula, where I live, but I found the quality of the food and service does not change. The soup and salad was so good and of course their double IPA is outstanding. The bartender Tim went out of his way to make sure I had a great experience in Valencia. Thanks will return when in the area!!"
Ryan P.,"Canyon Country, CA",0,11,1,1.0,4/25/2014,"BJs has gone so downhill in the last 4 years.  We use to go all the time and The last 2 visits were comical. It has the feel as though kids are running it. waitresses are lazy and unhappy, and orders never came out right. Never was asked if I would like a refill. And their new menu is not very good, just seems like a bunch of cheap food."
Jacob N.,"Glendale, AZ",0,127,,2.0,5/10/2011,"Aye yai yai! Talk about expensive! Well drinks for $5.95+ ??? Are you out of your mind? What is this, Las Vegas? But alas, their house brews must be cheap right? As most house brews are. An incentive to drink the house beer over the bigger brews imported from around the world. But no! They are barely any cheaper than a Guinness! I tried the hef, the red, the stout and the porter. The porter was the only decent one, and a Guinness is still better anyway. Bottom line, go with friends, and get a pitcher. Maybe then you can leave without spending $30 on drinks.  Though I do have to say the pazookie was pretty good. Unfortunately this is one of the only bars around."
