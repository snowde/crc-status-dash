Jenni R.,"Lancaster, CA",49,6,2,3.0,12/6/2012,"I love BJ's but this time I had dry chicken was a bit disappointed but I love there berry burst cider.. No one else carries it.. My daughter loves there pizza, so since she loves it I will continue to go, and just eat something else.."
Shannon C.,"Carlsbad, CA",252,472,762,3.0,2/21/2011,"We ordered the beer tasters and I dug the Jeremiah Red. Also, who could leave without ordering a chocolate chip pizookie? So good! I also ordered the ""Lime in the Coconut"" martini - it was good, but not very strong."
John S.,"Lancaster, CA",0,51,4,1.0,7/1/2014,Went here last night and the services SUCKED!!!!!!!  Had to ask several times for water when I asked for extra butter it never came!! Food came out cold and veggies under cooked. Never going back.
Fiorella A.,"Eastvale, CA",1,3,,1.0,6/21/2014,"Horrible service wow never experience something do bad at a bj .. Asked for outside seating waiter never came had to go in to ask if anyone was working tonight no ice  in drinks , wilted lettuce ... Disgusting ... Never again"
Skylar V.,"Canyon Country, CA",5,116,,2.0,2/19/2014,"This place is just bad now.  The food is sub par-average and their deep dish pizza is not as good as I thought it use to be.  The worst part is the service.  The servers are slow, complacent, and just not good.  The most pervious time that I went, it took forever to get an initial sign that we had a waitress, and everything was slow afterward.  Even when we went for a birthday years ago, everything was just not that good.  I've been to other BJ's that have way better food and service.  This one is an epic disaster."
Brian I.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,68,1,3.0,8/14/2010,"Bj's in Valencia, the definition of a place that is hit or miss. I have had plenty of great experiences here that included cold delicious beer, good food, and fast service. I have also had plenty of experiences here that included flat beer, ok food, and horrible slower than molasses service. I come here for the beer first and the food second. My favorite Bj's microbrews are the Hefeweizen, Jeremiah Red, and seasonal pumpkin ale. Also enjoyable is the Jerryburst(Jeremiah Red and Berry Burst Cider blend). Usually the beer tastes very fresh, but occasionally it is flat. Nothing ruins my night more than a flat beer! Food wise, Bj's serves average food for a restaurant of its type. Favorites of mine are the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and the Blackened Cajun Chicken Pasta. Never had a problem with any of those dishes. I think one thing that brings this place down is the fact that you usually have a half hour to hour wait on Friday and Saturday nights. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind waiting that long if I know that the experience is going to be great at the end of the hellish wait. Plus, this place gets packed with annoying teenagers."
Austen H.,"Denver, CO",126,366,48,3.0,7/13/2012,"This place was good. Apparently we have them in Colorado and I didn't realize it...my bad. So it's in a good location, it was pretty nice. The food was good our waiter didn't over bug us but he could have been a bit more attentive. I'd give it a try in Colorado."
Sandy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,54,2,4.0,11/30/2010,"I use to hate this place, I thought it was bland and mediocre. I don't remember what I was ordering.. but now, I love this place!!! EXCEPT for the service. It takes forever in this joint to get seated. Let alone ordering and then waiting for your food and check.. But..you will never find another place that serves avocado rolls with that much avocado in it! It's name is true to the dish (unlike some places). Their salads are also very fresh and crisp and not to mention filling. Never once received a warm salad here. I like how they serve their salad finely chopped - you get a bite of all the different toppings in one mouthful. Most restaurants just cut the lettuce fork/bite sized.. I usually order the cobb or honey/mustard chicken crisp salad. Their sandwiches are good too, big portions and filling.  A must try are their pazookies!!!!! A freshly baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream melting on top. It's big enough to feed 2-3 ppl. It takes about 15 mins to cook but sooo worth the wait. Especially with their extensive drink menu. There are so many options to try!"
Mikayla R.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,39,,1.0,3/22/2014,"They sent me a $20 gift card. Did not call me back as promised. No other manager contacted me. So, I got my phone stolen, smashed, my self humiliated, and my time severely wasted."
Brittany B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",191,1064,133,3.0,7/10/2012,"I was pleased with our last visit to BJ's.  It was a weekday so we were seated quickly.  The service was friendly, and the server gave some good suggestions when we wanted to order one of the 5-oz sampler sets.  I always order the pizza, which is pretty tasty, though the sauce is a bit acidic.  It's a fine choice if we want to go out somewhere to order drinks and still have the kids with us (=loud)."
A M.,"Aurora, IL",0,281,155,4.0,1/28/2013,"I had a great meal large portions, the  restaurant staff was very courteous and attentive. I would definetely return."
Ti M.,"Jacksonville, FL",741,628,125,3.0,2/28/2007,"Okay...the food is good...it is huge actually.  And this place is a chain.  I am not a chain restaurant fan.  I prefer locally owned places of business...but I do appreciate a good meal. The cider here is so awesome and perfect on a wintry day.  I had the avocado egg rolls, Asian salad, buffalo chicken pizza, and the sliders.  All very impressed and happy with the selections.   The service was prompt, friendly, and chain like.  This is a cool happy hour place, but it drags in all the corporate folks.  How do I know, I am corporate.  :("
Wilfredo C.,"Bakersfield, CA",228,12,3,3.0,11/10/2013,"The environment here is ok. My car was being fixed next to the shoppng mall, so I decided to  come in ad check it out. The food was good and the waiter was a nice person."
Lynne H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,25,,2.0,4/24/2014,"Not a good experience.  It is a huge place with very bad acoustics and the noise is deafening.  The wait staff are running their butts off and seem very overwhelmed.  I don't blame them in this review, I think something is wrong in the way this place is organized (number of cooks, staff, timing, training, etc).  So the wait staff under these conditions took forever to wait on us and were late with our orders and they came at different times. I think the cooking crew is disorganized or understaffed or something. Our food was also burned when it finally came, and not just one thing on the plate but several items.  Not really wanting to return.  I hope they improve because they are ideally located right near the Movie theater and I like to have a meal when I go to a movie."
David L.,"Meridian, ID",1776,815,794,3.0,4/27/2010,"Returned to BJ's for lunch with a client on their request. Had lemonade, gourmet mac & cheese, Hawaiian shrimp skewers, and the flat bread chicken pesto pizza.  Once again we had Sarah as our server. She's very good.  The gourmet mac was scorching hot, but so delicious.  The Hawaiian shrimp Skewers (on their small portion menu) is very good, but also VERY small. Skip this.  The Flat Bread Chicken Pesto Pizza is VERY good - the highlight of the trip. Like thin crust pizza that doesn't have too much cheese but is packed with a ton of flavor? ORDER THIS.  Sarah kept the lemonade refills coming.  My clients seem to like this place and Lazy Dog quite a bit, so I'll probably be back again."
A M.,"Arleta, CA",65,323,114,1.0,5/10/2012,"This BJ blows! Can I give it ZERO stars?    Our food was burn, took it back came back almost the same,  took forever to get our food both times, and the service... well I won't even go there!   Beautiful location too bad the service is so poor.  Go to my favorite BJs, the Burbank one :-)"
J L.,"Valencia, CA",3,106,,3.0,7/12/2015,"My fiancé and I came here last night for desert after having dinner at Buca. We were seated fairly quick. It was sort of busy, but luckily we were in a less busy section. A waiter came over to our table and his name was either Victor or Hector, I really don't remember and nor do I really care. He had such a bad attitude right from the start. Anyways, I had received an email saying that I had enough points on my rewards card to get a free pizookie. I asked him if he was able to confirm if that was correct. He looked annoyed at me and said ""I'm pretty sure you have to buy something in order to get the pizookie but I'll check"" (we had ordered waters to drink).  I then see him telling a different waiter to check the points and Victor/Hector never bothered to come back. About five minutes later, a waiter by the name of William O. came to our table and confirmed that I had enough points to get the pizookie. He asked us what kind we wanted and placed our order. Although he didn't really check up on us much, he was way better than the other guy because he was nice and very polite and actually had a good attitude. Our pizookie came probably 10-15 minutes later and it was good. My only complaint is that the cookie was a little too crispy for my taste. After this experience, I'm not sure if I'll be returning. This restaurant really needs to step up their game with their customer service."
Katy H.,"Seattle, WA",4998,1989,3261,4.0,10/9/2009,"Sad to see the low rating on this spot. I've been here a number of times and have never had a bad experience. You're definitely going to have to wait for a table and your food but beyond the requirement that you be somewhat patient - this place is just fine!  The salads are fresh and the ingredients are great. I'd put this restaurant on the same level as a TGI Fridays or A Buca di Beppo. Decent prices, good portions, predictable menu.  One must-have is the Pazookie (giant choc chip cookie with ice cream on it.) It's big enough for 4 or 5 people to share. YUM!"
N D.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/14/2012,"If you want mediocre food with terrible service this is the place for you, I've been to this bj's many times over the past years and can honestly say 9/10 times my service is terrible with few exceptions the staff including managers are very unfriendly I've even had a prank pulled on me by the front desk who were just messing around even though it was busy, I've waited over 2 hours for food and had nobody come to my table to update me until I asked to speak to a manager, after years of constant terrible service the final straw occurred on my birthday, me and some friends went to eat service was Slow as usual and they forgot to give my birthday pizooki, just thought it was a typical bj's night, asked for the check to be split up, they told us they couldn't do that which makes things harder for everyone but still at that point no big deal so we go to pay the bill and when we get our cards back I realized she added the entire gratuity to my bill with my food informing me gratuity can't be split up, even though all my friends included tax and gratuity on their cards, so I figure out she was trying to take an extra $15 in tips, I explain this to her and she says she will get a manager long story short the manager was rude, and I had to wait an extra hour in order to be able to pay the bill, even though I had more fiends showing up to my house for my birthday party, literally ruined my birthday dinner and I got home fuming I was so mad.    Please save your time and money and avoid BJ's restaurant, it just isn't worth the trouble and besides there are lots of new restaurants being put in such as Lazy Dog, Wokcano, Lucille's that are still at the mall but with much better food and service"
Taylor M.,"Valencia, CA",1,12,,1.0,8/14/2015,"Avoid Francisca at the hostess desk,Chris the restaurant manager and Danielle a server. I am very sad to say the service here has gone down hill. We called ahead at 6:45 pm and arrived at 7:25 pm to be told that we would need to wait 40 minutes after over an hour of waiting we approached the hostess and she said our buzzer went off. Our buzzer never went off and we were standing right out side the restaurant. At this point she told us it would be another 30 minutes (a 40 minute wait is now turning into a 2 hour wait) I asked for the manager, Chris and he told me he would seat us right away. After waiting 15 minutes we're were asked if our party of 8 could be sat at 2 separate tables. We were furious. I asked for the manager again and he would not approach us. Finally we are seated and received very slow service. Our waitress informed us that an item we did not even order would be comped. The item took 45 minutes to come after we finished eating our meals. At this point we just wanted to go. Needless to say the service here lacked decent hospitality and unfortunately we will not be dining here again."
