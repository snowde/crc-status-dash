Anabelle E.,"Hollywood, CA",143,39,22,4.0,3/6/2006,"This is a GReAT place to eat at lunch or dinner.  The food is always good!  Service can sometimes be a hit and miss game but more often you get a hit!  Great enivornment but really loud most of the time. The bar does a great job with the drinks.  There Blonde beer is really good and worth a try.  The portions are big but small enough to finish.  There pizza is really good especially with the beer.  They have a great variety of food that is really good, one of my favorites is there Blackened Salmon. YUM! A must have when at BJ's is there famous Pizookie!!  A fresh warm cookie in a 6"" pan is brought out to you with a couple of scoops of ice and hot fudge or what ever else you want on it.  One bite of that and you'll be hooked forever!"
Greg K.,"Val Verde, CA",8,40,,1.0,11/1/2011,"Not happy! The service here stinks.  We've tried it twice and I will not go back.  The waitresses think its cute to make you wait and then they try to play nice.  It takes way too long to get your drink order (we waited almost 20 minutes), then the food order ... The salads/soup arrives and the order is wrong.  Then the food finally arrives and you know it didn't just come out of the oven.  Refills come when the waitress is getting ready to hit you with the dessert sale.  Pretending to care about your clients is NOT good service. Food is typical BJ's, which has declined in the past few years.  Add to this the horrible service and you've just chased away another customer.  Yeah, I know there's more to replace my business, but do this enough and you won't have customers, which means you won't have jobs."
Yvonne M.,"Canyon Country, CA",14,44,2,2.0,1/8/2014,"Went two weeks ago on a Friday night. My friend knew she wanted only a pizookie so she ordered it when they took our drink orders. Our drinks came and we ordered food, then that food came and we ordered more drinks and food, those came, and still no pizookie. An hour had passed by at that point so we called our waiter over and he came (5 minutes later). We told him what had happened and he apologised. Then he came back to say he would send two birthday pizookies over without charging us. Our waiter was very nice and the food and drinks were good but we spent nearly TWO HOURS before we finally got my friend's pizookie. The gaps in between our waiter coming to our table were too long."
Chad L.,"Danville, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/4/2015,"We have dined at multiple BJs locations and enjoy the experience; however. this Valencia location does not pair up to the rest.  The past 2 visits have been very disappointing, and I will probably not visit this location again when I am in town. The servers were not friendly and the service was slow, appetizers not being put in and coming out with the main meal, and acting like it was OK. Last night we had a server decide she didn't want to wait on us and had the bartender take over without an introduction or appropriate hand off, I thought this was an extremely rude and awkward hand off. Poor guy had to try and explain why she didn't put our order in while we could see her chatting with friends. He tried to save the experience but this was the second time in 2 weeks we had similar bad experiences. I don't think we will go back to this BJs location. Looks to be trending downward with an overall rating of 2.5 stars."
David P.,"Bellevue, WA",58,453,77,4.0,1/28/2013,"The Great White pizza is still one of my faves on the planet, after enjoying it there for 13 years.  Love that they are finally building one next to my work!"
Lindsey S.,"Chatsworth, CA",89,21,18,2.0,8/5/2012,"I have been to many Bj's and have never experienced service that I felt needed a review. After a 45 min wait which we were expecting, we were led to a booth in the bar. This normally isn't a problem except we had our two small children with us (1 and 3) when I asked for a high chair I was informed he wasn't allowed to put a high chair at the end of that table. When I asked to sit somewhere where we could have a high chair it was going to be another 20-30min wait. The table next to us was surrounded by 20 somethings celebrating a 21st birthday. So between endless shots, foul language and fighting with the one year old and expecting him to sit still for a duration of a meal it was less then a miserable experience. Needless to say We ate and left."
Joseph A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3381,1174,6443,1.0,9/10/2009,"The food is at least consistent with most BJ's, but the service here is horrible.  The service takes forever during lunch.  i don't even know whey we come here.  Late on food, forgetful on items, paying no attention to us and letting us know when the food is coming out, and bringing the wrong food.  Bad service with a smile.."
Rissa S.,"Hayward, CA",0,16,14,1.0,6/22/2013,"I normally come to Bj's , but this specific location was horrible. Service sucked, and we waited at our table for 20 mins before we tagged any waiter down to at least give"
Stacey T.,"Carmel, CA",101,48,72,3.0,6/27/2012,"Wish I had read the reviews before we came.  Travelling through from out of town, and we figured we couldn't go wrong with a BJ's.   We were sat in about 10 minutes, but then we were invisible to anyone who worked at BJ's for 22 minutes even though we were on a major thoroughfare in the restaurant.  Once we were noticed we ordered right away and were rushed right along.  The buffalo chicken pizza was good, and my husbands burger was good.  We were never checked on and we waited about 15 minutes for a box and check of just sitting...... We won't be back to BJ's Valencia purely due to the long waiting while at your table."
Kevin L.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",349,617,215,3.0,12/4/2011,"The issues we had the last time we were here (June 2011) were nowhere to be seen this time. We sat in the bar for our 45 minute wait (which was actually 20) and the bar staff were friendly and attentive. Our drinks maybe took two minutes to come out. We got our table and paid our tab there. Our server was friendly and I didn't notice the issues my parents were complaining about (though it's my parents, so I'm sure there weren't any real issues). The food was great and we were all happy. No complaints here!!!"
Cresta R.,"Glendale, CA",206,102,106,2.0,5/28/2009,"I was contemplating on whether to give BJ's a one or two stars (It would've been a one...but read on).  BJ's wouldn't have been my choice for a delightful meal, but I was dragged here by a group of co-workers...annnnd...well there's nothing better than seeing your co-workers drunk and having them walk the ""walk of shame"" the very next day.   Food:  Taste like ""Hungry Man Microwavable Food"" (Pizza is okay ..taste even better after a couple of Jeremiah Reds) There were 2 birthday parties being celebrated in the patio...the birthday celebrants were turning 7 and 8 years old.  (Seriously?!) I foresee future Woo Girls and Alcoholics! Eye Candy ..Eye Candy...Eye Candy....Servers looked like they just stepped out of Abercombie posters...(reason for the extra star...besides the whole drunken co workers thing) (*wink) Priceless:  Witnessing your obnoxious ""I think I'm so hot and so smart"" co worker make a fool of himself the whole entire night."
Jason B.,"Santa Barbara, CA",49,376,37,4.0,3/30/2012,Very good pizza and a nice selection of beer on tap in a great environment.
Bree M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",27,57,17,2.0,8/25/2011,"Food is good, and lots of menu options, but I am so tired of giving this place another try.  Their service sucks and always has sucked.  The server was older and a bit better then the usual, but like always, forgot to bring stuff.  I think it is just this location though as I have had better experiences at other BJ's Restaurants."
G. Stephen S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,74,,1.0,12/26/2013,"Can't believe how terrible and slow the service is here. After waiting an hour we asked where our food was...the server said,""oh, it didn't come? I'll send the order in again"" HELLO! Isn't it her JOB to verify orders and make sure we get our food? Had to ask 3 different people for water too! The great punch line is that all this occurred between 10pm and 11pm... Not like they were all that busy.  Saw quite a few times the servers gathered, not doing anything except chatting together.  I asked for a manager to come by....never did! Got our bill finally and left.  The food and prices were ok, but I will not go there again no matter how close to the theaters and mall they are, and will happily tell others the same. There are too many other choices nearby that respect the patron and his wallet."
Darlin M.,"Bullhead City, AZ",30,16,1,5.0,9/3/2012,"Thank you, BJ's, Valencia and General Manager Dimitri Ioakim for hosting our fundraiser, yesterday, to benefit the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center Foundation. We appreciate your continued community support. I love your pizza's but decided to try something different. My cousin suggested ordering the avocado eggrolls. All that I can say is that it is an avocado lover's delight."
Greg R.,"Los Angeles, CA",226,46,48,2.0,2/1/2011,"It was a slow, cold monday night when two friends and I sat down in the bar area for happy hour. One of my friends who was the first to order, ordered an iced tea. The waitress laughed. When he asked her  why she laughed she stated, ""I thought you'd order beer or something"". I ordered chicken pesto flatbread pizza. Both of my friends ordered mini pizzas. When a waiter brought our food he asked us if there is anything he could get us. I asked for hot sauce and my friend asked for a side of ranch. The ranch never came and I had to ask another waitress for hot sauce, it took a while for her to bring it but I finally got it when I was almost done with my food. Our server made some sarcastic comment about our calorie counting when she offered the option of dessert. The food was hot and good but the service was cold and bad. I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that BJ's management may be responsible for their unhappy employees attitude and poor performance. After reading other reviews of this place, then experiencing it for myself, I would say there's a definite pattern here."
Jim G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",11,56,1,4.0,2/1/2012,"I read the other reviews and wonder did I go to the same place.  Took my son there for his birthday dinner.  Got seated within a minute. We all had our drinks within 2 minutes. Calzones, pizza and salads.  Everything very fresh and timely.  Free dessert that was amazing.  Very friendly service with a smile.  This is my 6th time eating at this location and have never had a problem."
Apotheosis C.,"Granada Hills, CA",58,130,37,4.0,10/11/2011,No complaints ! I came here after doing a 5 day detox of nothing but vegetable smoothies and water. Maybe bc I have not tasted real food on a week but the crispy thin chicken parm was fantastic ! I licked the plate clean ! The deserts are fab !
Jordan R.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,8,,3.0,5/20/2013,"We did not know where to go for dinner, but the guy at the front desk of our hotel told us about bjs. He said he loved bjs, and would recommend bjs to everyone. We tried out bjs, and we were quite satisfied. They could step there customer service in regards to filling waters and removing glasses. I liked bjs, and i am sure you will like bjs too."
Mish H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,24,,2.0,8/22/2013,"Just OK. Don't expect decent service or delicious food, everything here is just OK. Been coming here for a few years now, and I really don't know why I keep going. This review is based on my most recent experience...my sister and I ordered a few appetizers to share instead of individual meals. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, Margherita flatbread and the fried artichokes. The waitress, first off, was very unfriendly and was RUSHING the entire time. It was Sunday evening, I guess it was kind of busy, but it wasn't that busy. She was flying around the place and it was making me nervous. She wasn't attentive at all, either. She asked us if we wanted a certain appetizer first, and we said yes please...Then, a waiter brings everything out at once. I don't understand...why ask if we want something a specific way and then not do it? Also, this might just be my little pet peeve, but it bothers me that when they bring the food out, they just stand there staring at you waiting for you to move EVERYTHING out of the way on the table. They don't help at all, either. I mean, we didn't have a bunch of crap on the table to begin with. Maybe that's just me...but anyways, the meal was fine. Waitress asked us if we were doing ok and by the time we were able to respond she was already at the other side of the room. I probably won't come back, it's really not worth it. There are plenty of other restaurants to choose from in Valencia."
