Laurie M.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",3,31,,2.0,7/10/2013,"As so many others have written, the food is ok and the prices are decent. Where BJ's consistently falls down is in the service. Last weekend our party of five stopped in around 3 for a late lunch. The place was not crowded. We were seated immediately, and then waited. And waited. And watched servers go back and forth in front of us. And waited some more. Finally, we heard someone behind us tell a server to take our table, which the guy did begrudgingly. We immediately placed our drink and food orders, out of fear that he would leave and not return! It didn't take too long to get our food, but my order was wrong. They had given my order to someone at another table, and her order to me. This was not the first time this same scenario had happened.  The server was very apologetic and rushed to fix the mistake. The manager came over to apologize as well, and took my meal off the bill (ok, that was a nice touch). Of course, by the time my ""rush"" order arrived, everyone else had finished eating.  As I said at the beginning of this missive, I do like the food, but it's just not worth the aggravation, so I think we'll steer clear of BJ's."
Justin S.,"Acton, CA",0,50,,2.0,7/13/2012,"Food: A Service: F Food is always great here, but the service is a joke. We waited 12 min. Before the waiter came to take our drink order. We were here for alittle over an hour, but they did give us a free dessert for the inconvenience."
gourmand h.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,30,,1.0,6/23/2012,"We visited a few weeks ago to try the new lunch menu.  They should call it the Kids Menu.  My companion ordered the Chicken over mashed potatoes and corn.  The piece of chicken was about 3 inches by 2 inches small over a cup size of mashed potatoes and 3 Tablespoons of corn.  I ordered the half baked potato which, according to the menu, comes with a large bowl of soup, only I received a small cup of soup.  The baked potato was barely cooked with a stingy amount of toppings. Other reviewers have said BJ's other locations are better, but this is only one I've been to.  They are just lucky to have a convenient location across from the movie theaters in a walkable neighborhood.  We left hungry and will not be back."
John K.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",404,21,11,1.0,9/3/2011,"I used to enjoy going here but recently i was very disappointed with the quality of the food served here. The chicken fried steak was seriously a tiny piece of meat with an abundance of flour and oil(eww). It came out with the gravy all cold and hard but the waiter said this is the way it is served here (WTH! it seriously looked like a plate of cold crap). Srry Bjs but after this, you are no longer on my list"
Matt A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,2,,1.0,2/10/2012,"service is horrible. the only thing good about this place is the pazookie, even if they make you wait 30 mins for it."
Hsiawen H.,"Newhall, CA",158,186,25,2.0,12/6/2008,"I will definitely agree with other reviewers that the best part of BJ's is the beer. And the beer is CRAP! If you're in the mood for bland tasteless American food, or some over salted pizzas and pastas served with their in home water brews come on down. I ask you yelpers WHO takes a head of lettuce cuts out a chunk, throws it on a plate, and CHARGES MONEY!?!?!? The reason places like these survive in the SCV is because they provide food for the masses with simple palates."
Tiffany V.,"Santa Clarita, CA",13,46,,1.0,9/9/2013,Blech. Microwaves and freezers. I don't need to say more.
Patrick O.,"Valencia, CA",102,15,7,4.0,9/2/2011,I have been to quite a few Bj's not all are good but the one in the SCV is good food good people. I go here often when I want a good meal b4 work and you don't have to break the bank here.
Michael W.,"Burbank, CA",0,15,,3.0,2/22/2014,"SLOW SERVICE!!!!  Great food though, as long as you have patience and don't have prior engagements, I would recommend you come here. Staff is very very slow and unattentive. The pizza is great as well as the pasta dishes."
julie v.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",75,2,,1.0,12/26/2013,"I went to BJ's for my Birthday dinner on December 17,2013 @ 7:30pm. I had 7 people in my party and was disgusted with the service! They sat us way in the back of the restaurant,even though, there were not many people closer toward the front. Our waiter took 15 minutes to come over to get our drink order. He was not friendly, had no smile and made it seem like he was annoyed by the questions we were asking, regarding the menu items and how they were prepared. We ordered root beers, because we heard that they were great! We were so disappointed when we got them, they were flat,no fizz and warm. We told the server and he said ""well that's how it comes out"" We asked if this is how it always tastes and he said "" I don't know, what else do you want?"" We asked for Arnold Palmer's and he said that they had no more Lemonade. Really?? Okay, we finally said, ""Just bring us cokes"" We ordered chips and Salsa as an appetizer, it took another 15 minutes for him to bring stale chips and runny salsa. We again complained and he rolled his eyes and said, ""if you don't like it, what else do you want?"" We were starving, so we said ""Just leave them"" We all ordered or main dishes and after another 55 minutes, our food out. During those 40 minutes, we had to keep flagging him down, so he could refill our drinks. Each time he came over he gave this annoying sign and half cracked smile, as if we were bothering him! When our food  finally came out, it was okay, nothing to get excited about. We again had to flag our waiter down in the middle of eating, so he could refill our drinks. He never bothered to ask us if we wanted dessert and brought us the check. We told him that we wanted to get 7 of the pizza cookies with ice cream. He again sighed and said with his half assed smile,"" okay""  I have been going to this restaurant for many years and I have always had okay to good service. In this economy restaurants should be stepping up their game and customer service. I work hard for my money and expect to be served in a courteous manner and served fresh good food! I will not be going back to this BJ's. I have many options in Santa Clarita and I think I will be spending my money elsewhere."
Olivia L.,"Baltimore, MD",44,7,,3.0,9/23/2011,"Decent drinks, ok food. Fun for groups of people. Beware, the floor is very slippery so when wearing heels & having drinks use caution."
Lily T.,"Santa Clarita, CA",5,3,,2.0,7/22/2013,"Worst service in Valencia. As a server myself, I always try to give fellow waitstaff the benefit of the doubt. I understand there can be nights that are overwhelming and understaffed, kitchen problems, bar problems, etc. However, every time I come here, it always seems to take 10 minutes before I'm greeted... And if you're sitting in the bar, walk out and save yourself the irritation. Food is decent, but It isn't worth the poor service. We were looking to grab a quick bite before a movie last night, so we saw an open high top table at the bar. We sat down and were not acknowledged for nearly 15 minutes. The first employee at our table only dropped menus, and then we waited a few more minutes before they eventually bussed the dirty table. Finally, a server came by, lacking any personality or motivation to be there, took our drink and food order as we'd been ready for a while at this point. I had ordered a soup with my meal which never came out, and we finally received our entry within about 45 minutes since being approached. What's worse is seeing your server just leaning against the bar and mingling with other waitstaff. The server simply took our order and that was it. Didn't check on how we were doing and didn't ask about the food, which was also mediocre. With restaurants closing everyday, you'd think service of all things would be a priority to keep people coming back."
Carrie D.,"Pasadena, CA",1500,416,2,4.0,8/30/2010,"Have to up them to 4 stars because of the new gluten free menu. They now have gluten free pizza, soups, and Redbridge GF beer. The pizza is actually really good, as is the GF broccoli cheese soup. It is nice to have another GF restaurant option."
Cindy R.,"Granada Hills, CA",15,85,1,5.0,5/11/2011,Food was great and my Cadillac margarita was great!!! Us ladies shared the pizzookie and it was soooo delicious!!!
Vance W.,"Santa Clarita, CA",53,31,20,5.0,8/13/2011,"I know BJ's brews their own excellent beer. I had the Porter on Wednesday. But then my serious beer fan friends arrived, and we swtched over to the Belgian brews...notably the Westmalle Duble, and the Delirium. BTW the bacon cheese burger is only AWESOME!"
Nikki I.,"San Francisco, CA",248,335,1255,4.0,2/28/2009,"I've easily been here a dozen or so times since it's conveniently across from the movie theaters. I've only been to one other BJ's before (in Westwood) and it was more or less the same (as chain restaurants tend to be...). The only complaint I have about this place is the wait. And that's only because it's obviously pretty popular, especially on Friday/Saturday nights. The avocado egg rolls would have to be one of my favorite dishes of all time, ever. So deeply satisfying. I usually either get a chicken salad or the sweet pig pizza (ham & pineapple). Always delicious. Service is usually decent (I dunno what the other reviewers are talking about...). The place also has a really wild bar, which is always packed and rowdy. Wouldn't be surprised if they have a damn good happy hour. ;) They have take-out, which is nice, but I know the Westwood BJ's has delivery, which is even nicer. If this place delivered, I'd be calling regularly."
Renee B.,"Arleta, CA",42,205,32,3.0,2/28/2009,"Eesh, what a low score for this BJ's! It's not that bad. But then again, I only go here for lunch a few times a year. I can only imagine that this place gets packed on the weekends. Lunch portions are HUGE. If you get a sandwich, you'll get salad, fries, and a bread roll. You can also order lunch 1/2 orders of salads and other entrees. When they had construction going on in the patio, they had a big sign saying ""Lunch Specials at $5.95."" Don't know if that's still running but sounds like a good deal.  On the occasions that I've sat inside to eat there, it's been ok. Service is satisfactory. I've been there during really busy times where they've completely forgotten my table and other times where they've been very attentive. I generally enjoy the food there. I like the mini deep dish pizza and their turkey BLT. And that pizooki is always great to share with friends."
Ni hao K.,"Santa Clarita, CA",59,58,5,1.0,4/27/2011,Worst service ever. This restaurant has thee rudest staff who just don't seem to want to do their job well. While I don't dislike the chain I do think this particular BJs is poorly managed.
L S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,20,,2.0,10/16/2013,"Came on a saturday evening. Long lines/wait. Kings game. I ordered the thai mango salad. It was delicious!!! Must try!! I also ordered a alcoholic drink that is made of bacardi rum and strawberry syrup with fresh slice strawberry. It was great, good amount of rum. BUT, i do no think they wash their fresh strawberries. I had a ant on one of my strawberry. I told the waiter, he said he'll be back but never return until my dinner was gone. I was disappointed but didnt make a big deal ( what a waste of $11) :). Anyways one bad experience will deff turn me away from this place."
Katie P.,"Valencia, CA",294,310,1165,5.0,6/16/2008,"Alot of my friends used to work here. Its really part of the nightlife of Valencia. Kinda lame, but hey, its fun to come here with a huge group of people and order drinks, since we know some of the waitresses and bartenders. This place was the first time I had ever had an irish car bomb. And by far, the best place.  All the guys at our table ordered them and us girls just watched them pound them like water. So, naturally, I thought I should give it a try, since it IS delicious beer after all. So everyone is watching me when I get mine and I find out, its my least favorite beer in an irish car bomb.... Guinness. ughhh. But, I did it, and I was proud, and they were suprised. And I did it again and again. And ever since its been my drink of choice. Besides their Hefeweizen. PLEASE for the love of god, TRY THEIR HEFEWEIZEN! Its the best beer ever in my opinion. It has a hint of berry to it.... its just to die for. Their pizza is amazing as well. I always get the plain cheese or their bbq one. mmm. Fluffy sweet and salty deep dish pizza."
