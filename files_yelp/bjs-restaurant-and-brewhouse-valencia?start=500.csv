Jenn K.,"Sylmar, CA",44,89,47,1.0,8/2/2010,Took 30 minutes for a to-go salad order. The host was rude and short with everyone that entered the restaurant. They had 3 people up front yet there was a line to be seated even though the restaurant was pretty empty and it wasn't busy.
Jason M.,"Canyon Country, CA",112,44,,2.0,7/9/2008,"The only thing good about this place is the beer.  If you're an avid beer drinker, they have some pretty darn good brews.  Their seasonals are great too, definitely try those. The food is mediocre here. The servers are the worst.  We would often come here as a group of 3-7 people because it is a good place to drink a good beer and hang.  But the last time I went, the server was new and taking way too long on everything.  We didn't have any silverware, until 10 mins after our food came out.  My food came out wrong, so I had to wait for them to completely remake it and that made me get my sandwich as everyone else was finishing their food.  That was an hour wait for my food.  I'm a vegetarian and explicitly order a vegetarian burger, but they gave me a turkey burger instead.  The veggie burger is decent, and the first that I had had it. The manager heard an earful from us and knew that the restaurant was getting some good biz from our party of 8 and some bad word of mouth after leaving so he helped us out by basically discounting the bill by 50%. The one thing that this place consistently, like clock work, does is not come back to pick up your check once you've placed your method of payment in it.  They'll give you that check and then forget about you, guaranteed. I'm giving this place 2 stars, would give it 1, but the beer is good."
Jeff P.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,897,17,4.0,1/13/2011,"Great beer selection on draught...their own, and good premium beers. Great food too, just like all BJ's."
Shan G.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,6,,2.0,9/3/2011,"Ok. So I came here tonight and I have to admit after trying it, It wasn't as good as I thought. To start I had the spinach and artichoke dip-it was okay. (I've had better.) For my main meal, I had the Angel Toscana pasta. It wasn't good at all. Tasted like noodles and chicken with cheese. Service wise-It was crappy at  best. My server was doing his best to take care of his tables, (I left him a good tip) but I would think that BJ's would be better in terms of service. Overall, it was okay but deifnitely not a place I would return to again. Do not go this particular location though."
Diane S.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,5.0,8/19/2013,Placed a big To-Go order over the phone. Adam helped take my order and made sure that all my food was given to me when I went in to pick up. The host was very nice to us while we waited for our order to be ready. Another employee helped walk us out to our car since we had a really big order. I was very impressed with all the costumer service and friendly people who work here. All of our food was perfect! We will be ordering again.
John M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,218,12,1.0,9/10/2008,Just saying what everyone else has already posted.  TERRIBLE service and mediocre food.  The management there doesn't even know what they're doing.  Many other choices in town to get your grub on. Update: 10/21/2009 Why oh why do I keep putting myself through the misery of eating at Bj's?  Got a burger that had chunks of charcoal all over...can't the cooks clean the grill before throwing my burger on it?
Reanna R.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,188,81,2.0,6/21/2010,"I love Bj's.  The Beer is great and the food rocks.  However, this particular one sucks so bad in service that I don't think I would ever want to go back.  Took forever to get a table, once we got a table it took forever just to get drinks and then it took forever just to get food.  The sad part was that they were busy for the laker game but no one around us was even eating or getting more drinks.  They were all finished & just finishing up the game."
Mark P.,"Los Angeles, CA",84,329,49,1.0,9/17/2007,"I have a thing about reviewing chains and franchises... I don't. But sometimes they deserve to be heard for the better... or worse. I've been to 5 different BJ's and for the most part, the food has been consistently good. As for the service... that's another story. During my last visit, the service was so horrid that I had to send a letter to corporate. I rarely do this, the only time I had was to Island's (another story), but it was for the better of BJ's. Here in large, is the letter I sent. ""I would love to talk greatly about BJ's because of the great food at great prices but on this particular visit I was struck with absolute poor service. This lays mostly on our main server who made our visit quite lackluster. It was lunchtime and my girlfriend and I both ordered the lunch specials with half pasta and soup or salad. We got one soup and one salad but our food did not arrive for a lengthy time. When the food bringer brought only our pastas, we had politely told them that we did not receive our soup and salad. So we were stuck with our main entrees without what we considered our appetizers which we definitely would preferred to eat first. After 5 minutes our soup and salad finally arrived but by then, we had started on our food because we didn't want them to get cold and pretty much neglected the soup and salad. Now this wasn't really that big of a deal because accidents happen, but our server never once came back after taking our order until it was time for our bill. Never once did we get a refill or get an apology for the mistake and worse no follow-up. What I observed from ""our server"" was that she was constantly tending towards her bigger tables because let's be frank, she wants the bigger tips, however it's not ethical to totally neglect the smaller party just because we ordered less. This is the reason why I felt my visit to BJ's was awful. We would have been perfectly fine except we got no apology, no follow-up of any kind, and no refills. If you want the name of my server it is 'Darlene E' at the Valencia BJ's.""  What surprised me was that I got a personal letter from the head of the service department apologizing and sending me a gift card. It was a nice gesture and yes I spent it all on beer. As for the Notorious Darlene E., if you're reading this, you can suck my ass. PS... the bartenders at this particular BJ's have the WORST attitude. Especially this one chunky curly haired brunette who looks like she should be a pro-wrestler."
Armando A.,"Sylmar, CA",44,62,108,4.0,4/4/2012,"I don't always go to Awesometown, but when I do, I end sentences with ""brah"".  Walking in, the host said the wait was 20 - 30 min for a table for 3.  So then we decided to get some drinks at the bar while we waited.  Fortunately, there's tables at the bar, and it's self-seating so we didn't have to wait.  Got to order our drinks & food there too brah.  The service was friendly. Normally, I've noticed waitresses rather flirt than take orders.  This one did both well ;).  Didn't think I'd find any good low-calorie food other than salad, and being Catholic, I wasn't supposed to eat meat on Friday.  Surprisingly, I found a vegetarian mini-pizza.  It satisfied both requirements and it tasted good.  We split a pitcher of Jeremiah Red.  It's my favorite beer, great flavor and strong too.  There are some pretty big HDTVs (60"") all over the restaurant so you can watch the game from anywhere you're seated.  Also noticed girls in heels and dresses like they were going out to a club or something.  I guess BJ's is all they got in Awesometown brah.  This is the only reason I am taking a star off.  It's the opposite direction from my nightlife scene.  A good experience overall."
FourThumbs D.,"Palmdale, CA",2,68,44,1.0,3/25/2010,"Pretty decent.  Food is good, and comes out pretty quick after ordering it.  Depending on the time you go could be packed.  I've gone with co workers at lunch and we always get seated right away.  Service is ok, just depends on your waiter or waitress.  A few are really on point and great with refiling your drink and are outrageously  nice to look at as well.  I have to say this place should only get 2 stars due to the ANNOYING freaking waitress that thinks she can sing and calls every one either Honey Bun, Cutie, Baby, Baby cakes and a plethora of other annoying names.  She really needs to be fired.  1, she's HIGHLY ANNOYING, 2 She ruins every song that comes on the radio.  She's either tone deaf or was lied to as a child and was told she could sing.  I'm willing to upgrade this place to a 4 if she gets fired, thanks."
Mike D.,"Saugus, CA",206,286,11,1.0,9/12/2007,"I've long hoped that if I ignore BJ's it will go away, even on Yelp, but that's been of no use.  A three-star average is unacceptable; SCV's food snobs need to unite and bring this back down to earth.  Maybe when Yelp gets around to supporting accent marks or letting the Canadians in, they can enable the zero star feature.  But you can only use it every 50 reviews or something. One (too many) star. Full disclosure : I don't drink beer. Also : Don't like crap food."
Danielle H.,"Carpentersville, IL",1,14,6,2.0,1/23/2011,"Overall, the food was ""okay."" For the money, I expected better. As for the service, my waitress was very attentive until a party of 12 came in, and then I had to flag someone else down for refills and my ticket. Also, the noise level seemed overkill. I've been to sports bars before, and so I realize the atmosphere is casual and somewhat loud. In this one I could hardly hear myself think, let alone carry on a conversation."
Vicky V.,"Granada Hills, CA",66,54,,1.0,12/16/2009,"So I've been to a few BJs out there and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had. The service was absolutely HORRIBLE! They served us the wrong food. It took forever for it to come out of the kitchen. The waitress wasn't very apologetic, she was rude. The manager did come out at the end because we complained and comped us an entree. Oh, and the avocado egg rolls made me sick to my stomach. I was throwing up the next day. I will never go back to this restaurant again."
Susan S.,"Poway, CA",4,8,,1.0,6/6/2012,"Arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night with a group of 7.  Told there would be an hour wait.  Noticed a patio room that was totally empty--probably10 large tables set up.  Asked about those tables and  told they were reserved.  An hour later, still waiting, most of those tables were still empty!  Told that the party was running late!  Most places if you're an hour late you lose your table.  Ten minutes later we asked about our table and were  told it's being set up.  Ten minutes later we're told again it's being set up.  The patio tables are still empty......We finally sit down around 9pm.  The waitstaff was busy chatting with themselves and then didn't know who was supposed to take care of our table!  Oh and please turn the lights up to you can read the menu without a flashlite!  Food was hit and miss--salads had either too little dressing or were drowning and it took a long time to get any food out of the kitchen.  All night long no management comes by to apologize for our wait, comp some drinks or anything!   Never going back to that location and thinking twice about trying the Bj's near my neighborhood"
Kenny H.,"Cleveland, OH",220,457,8,2.0,1/13/2007,"Meh. Another BJs with the same problems as most BJs. Long wait time, decent food, but the service is definitely something that needs to be improved. Not much else to say. I'll come here if the fam decides to go here, but that's just about it."
Brian V.,"Pasadena, CA",26,41,3,3.0,4/20/2008,"I go here only for happy hour and the occasional Saturday lunch. This restaurant is usually very crowded and loud. The Happy Hour is from 4pm-7pm and again from 10pm-close. During these times, the pints of beer are $1 off and the mini-pizzas are 50% off. Most items from the appetizer menu are $1 off. I'll order two mini-pizzas, consume one on the premises along with 2 beer (the other pizza goes home in a box). I really like the BJ's Blonde and will sometimes mix it up with the Berry-burst Cider (they call it a Snakebite). The wings are good as are the potato skins. The nachos are decent as is the spinach dip. The avocado egg rolls are a bit too greasy for me. If you go to Happy Hour on a Friday evening, you MUST get there before 5pm or all of the seats will be taken. You have been warned.  The lunch I get is the half-sandwich and soup combo. I really like the Clam Chowder. It is a medium thick soup with good sized pieces of clams and potatoes. I'll get the chicken club with no mayo for the sandwich. Here is the IMPORTANT part, instead of fries, get the one-half baked potato as your side. They really make a good baked potato at this BJ's and it comes with anything you like (cheese, bacon, butter, sour cream, whatever). So for ~$8 you get a large bowl of good soup, one half a chicken club sandwich, and one half of a good baked potato. It is a very good value."
Gonzalo M.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",0,14,2,1.0,12/30/2012,"Wow for a first timer I should have read the reviews! But the only reason we went was because my wife got a gift card. I invited my son and my niece and her husband and we had the worst experience ever, as we sat down we got our drink order so far so good. After we got our drinks we never saw the waitress again for another 25 minutes! She got me another beer and we did not see her again. My son and my niece's husband needed a refill and nothing, after about 45 minutes to an hour my son called the waitress but she was too busy talking to another waiter at the kiosk. Finally she came over and my son had some words for her but we wanted to know about the food? She said ""I am going to the kitchen to see what's going on""  finally she came with two plates and said ""the manager was going to bring the other plates!"" We'll the manager did come over to talk to us and we told him that the service was really bad that my son and my nieces husband had no refills, and finally sent some one with a better attitude and they got refills after 45 minutes! The food was really good but since the service is horrible we are not going there again. We rather go to the Olive Garden or Red Lobster! There are many places around there that bend over to give you good service the first time!! So Shannon thank you so much for a horrible experience!!!!"
Jayme C.,"Las Vegas, NV",19,2,,1.0,12/16/2012,Been to this place several times and the service has sucked every single time! This past time they messed up the order and by the time they brought the correct order out everyone was done eating. Best advice I can give is that there are a ton of other better places to eat in the area!!!
Sarah Z.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,7,,1.0,11/13/2011,"Have you ever had excruciatingly slow service? Well double that, add in mediocre food, and utensils with last meal's food stuck on them and you get BJ's in Valencia. I went with a few friends for the second time (decided to give it one last try, never again) and after being seated, ended up waiting a whopping 45 minutes for a simple order of 3 macaroni and cheese and cesar salads. Never in my life have I had to wait this long for such a simple meal......? Mind you, this was a Wednesday night, so what the hell was their excuse? No weekend rush and the place was only half full. The macaroni and cheese ended up being cold and flavorless.....and here's the cherry topper of the evening, 2 of my friends had something stuck to their forks.....and yes it was edible. Never again BJ's will I be gracing you with my presence."
Dan H.,"Valencia, CA",105,302,22,3.0,11/17/2006,"The wait almost always blows, sometimes the service blows, sometimes the food blows, but if you're going here based on the name alone you're going to be seriously disappointed. I used to really like this chain about a decade ago.  But around the turn of the century the quality suspiciously slipped.  The menu became awash in corporate logos (""Ketchup by Heinz!"" ""Seasoned Salt by Lawry's!"") and on at least one occasion I received a pizza with an obviously pre-baked crust with the shit just thrown on top. They've recently cleaned up the menu (I only saw 1 logo this last weekend) and the food was an improvement upon what I recalled from the past, so maybe we'll start venturing over again (when there's no wait, of course.) I always enjoy their draft root beer and the pizookie.  I could go once a year just for those. $10-$20 per person.  Seems to be rebounding.  3 stars."
