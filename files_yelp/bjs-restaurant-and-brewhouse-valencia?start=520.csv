Scott W.,"Londonderry, NH",0,33,,1.0,1/9/2012,After 3 years we deceided to give them another chance. Sorry we did the food and service have not improved actually worse? Seated right away took are drink order and appetizer. Had the artichoke hearts were very good. Then placed our order and waited and  waited finally the soups came out but no spoons she then asked if we wanted more drinks and left to get our spoons and we waited and waitedshe finally came back but forgot the spoons by the time she came with spoons my soup was coll and my wifes was cold and the cheese ball was still sort of frozen. Then halfway through the soups our meals came the beans were cold and no one could be found our serverkept disappering. Then the busboy came to clear off a table next to ours and dropped a napkin on the floor and while looking straight at us he kicked the dirty napkin under the table. The food is hit and miss not terrible but not great and the service is still terrible.  The manager came over and took the soup and tacos off the bill we appreciated this but it was done so automticly that you know this is a routine thing and they just truly do not care. Terrible service and they just seemed to be resigned to the fact that service can never be improved we will never go back again.
Vvn W.,"Van Nuys, CA",63,546,30,4.0,9/18/2006,"Definite decent place to have lunch. Never had a problem here.  A great place to go with co-workers to just chill out and forget about work for at least an hour.  Also a great place to decide not to go back to work! Food is pretty good and usually prompt after placing your order.  Waitstaff understands that lunch time for most patrons is just an hour.  It could get packed during lunchtime and definitely at ""happy hour"".  Service is good for a busy brewery and some servers were really on the nose when it comes to replenishing your empty drink glass.  Bj's has an extensive menu that offers appealing appetizers, huge tasty sandwiches, fresh salads, bigger-than-your head baked potatoes, and delicious entrees.  For those who are in a rush, BJ's also offers lunch menu items that comes to your lunch table pretty quickly. My favorites include the cilantro pesto thin crust pizza and the spinach & artichoke dip appetizer.  Absolutely delicious! As others have reviewed before, you must try the Pizookie cookie dessert at least once in your life.  Warm right out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream melting on top! Afterwards you are free to roll out of this place....!"
Ahm M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,122,164,4.0,4/11/2007,"I'm  here quite a bit, even though I don't really believe in supporting chain restaurants. But here's the deal: This is one of the only places open late in Valencia.  Also, they have two happy hours every weekday, one early, one late. The mini-pizzas are half-price during happy hour, and the house beers are discounted.  So even if the chainy Valencia-y atmosphere turns you off, you'll still be happy with the food, the beer, and the late hours."
Ski M.,"Las Vegas, NV",534,160,12,3.0,6/9/2009,"I usually come here during happy hour (5-7 on weekdays i believe). $1 off beers and 50% off mini pizzas. I've been coming here for the past several laker playoff games, but no more. To many bro's and laker homers make BJ's their official headquarters... But ya the pizzokies here are bomb (that means they are very tasty). The sliders (angus beef) are good. So is the bbq chicken sandwhiches and pizzas. 2nd best strawberry lemonade ive tasted (behind the cheesecake factory). Pretty popular place in valencia on friday and saturday nights actually. alot of bottle blondes groups... who knew? no im serious, why didn't anyone tell me?"
Lauren B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/11/2010,"I like Bj's, I just dont like this location's service. I don't know how many times i've gone back thinking it'll be better. Busy or not, they have poor customer service. I've even tried ordering to go and something always went wrong. I go to Burbank's location where the hostess and server's know how to treat their customers!"
Joolia C.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,99,14,3.0,6/2/2009,"avoid weekends unless its lunch time. if its not busy, i stop grab the sandwich&soup combo. eat it. and leave pronto, cos i def don't stay for their service. but i will stay for a pazookie. or three."
Christopher S.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",8,14,,1.0,5/14/2013,"I have never been so insulted by a manager as I was tonight.  We walked in and went to the bar area.  The waiter came over after a minute or so and we ordered a couple of beers.  The table behind us sat down after us.  The waiter brought their drinks and then walked by our table and said ""oh they haven't brought your drinks yet.""  The beers came and we ordered a burger and a pizza.  I started looking at my watch after 15 minutes and after another 10(25 total) the waiter came back over and said"" they haven't brought your food yet?""  I said no and I would like to talk to a manager.  The manager came over and said the food runner had it in her hand and would be right over.  By this time we were ready to go home, we told the manager to just put it in to-go containers and we would pay the bill.  5 minutes later the food runner brought the food with no bill.  We asked where the bill was and a different waiter that we had not seen all night( the fill in for the break waiter) came and asked how things were.  At that point I told him to tell the manager that we would pay for the beers but were not going to pay for the food that has been over 40 minutes getting to our table.  If the manager knew we were having a problem would you not think he would bring it out himself.  When I told him we didn't want the food he became extremely sarcastic.  I was willing to pay for the food but he seem to feel that it was more important to belittle us then resolve the problem.  I have never been so insulted or belittled in my life and will never go back to this location of BJ's again.  Easily one of the worst service events in my entire life."
Ara A.,"North Hollywood, CA",27,50,5,5.0,4/13/2012,"You want good food, good beer and watch some sports at the same time?  Of course you do. Go to BJs have a pizza, have a beer, have a pazookie and forget that life outside sucks."
Frank R.,"Saugus, CA",11,369,198,2.0,5/1/2009,"Check out my reviews....  I rarely have anything bad to say in my reviews.  Stay away from this place unless you have no choice.  I want to blame the management but I understand that the pool of servers they get here in SCV are just college and high school kids who have no clue sometimes with service.  I also understand that it's a young crowd that hangs there and they're not the best of tippers for the establishment to retain good servers.  However, I've had good experiences at other BJ's."
Mich F.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/3/2012,"I went to this restaurant with my family for an early dinner.  The server seems nice but the food I ordered was terrible.  I ordered some ribeyes on medium well and the food I got looked more of like very thin sirloin with burns on almost every side and the taste was so dry and bitter.  Honestly, I think a carne asada meal from a foodtruck tasted so much better than their ribeye worth almost  $18. Worst of all, they served us a clam chowder soup on a ""moldy"" sourdough bread and I even took pictures of this moldy bread just incase we get food poisoning or bacteria in our system!!!.   This is my second and ofcourse last to dine at this place....Terrible!!!"
Mike J.,"Burbank, CA",2,26,1,4.0,5/11/2010,"Went in with my friend for lunch during happy hour.  $2 bucks off appetizers and I think half off mini pizzas, i had the sweet pig(which was awesome). Cant remember the pizza my friend had.Waiter recommended the potato skins with warm bbq sauce, BANGIN! Had the house Blonde beer, good choice. Spinach artichoke dip was cool too, had it with nachos.  All of the above for $32 (2 people and 2 draft beers each)"
Dan t.,"Raleigh, NC",0,18,,3.0,2/13/2008,"Standard chain fare in a fairly generic upscale mall.  I sat in the bar area, which had about half-dozen raised tables in addition to the counter itself.  The bar was fairly packed for a Tuesday night, with a mix of traveling businessmen, middle-aged locals, and the after-work crew.  The bartenders were reasonably nice and attentive.  3 fairly large TVs on the wall above the bartenders and 1 very large TV (combined of 4 smaller ones, a setup popular from the mid-90s). The beer was good (which it should be, considering this is what BJ's markets itself for).  I just missed the happy hour, which ended on 7 during the week.  Overall, not bad if you're just looking for a beer to relax with and some very mild atmosphere in a place that could be anywhere in America.  Better bets may be Origami across the street, or the local spots (Mabel's, the Greens, Vu Ultra Bar) for some character."
Roy S.,"Bella Vista, AR",1,24,,3.0,5/22/2010,The beer was good and cold as usuall but the service was sub par (as others have mentioned). I had the fish tacos and they were good but nothing to write home about.
Anthony M.,"Canyon Country, CA",30,8,13,2.0,7/30/2010,"I used to really enjoy BJ's years and years ago, before their mass explosion and proportional decline in food quality (IMHO).  But, it's still ok, and I still like to go now and then.  The thing is, this BJ's in particular, is kinda bad.  I mean, it's usually edible, but - compared to my other experiences at all the other BJ's across the southern California region, it just leaves you feeling like something important lacking - or that perhaps your food had been sitting out on the counter, perhaps have been knocked over onto the floor, brushed off then given back to you later - just not good.  We've been here many times since moving up here: tried eating in, take out; and I can't explain it, but the food is just not as good as we experience at other BJ's.  The service usually doesn't exactly make up for it either.  Maybe that's because it's stuck in the obnoxious town center?  Who knows.  What I can tell you, is that nowadays we actually make the drive down to Burbank instead when we need a BJ's fix instead of just going down the street to this one.  Kinda sad, huh?"
Kevin P.,"McMinnville, OR",2,7,1,4.0,1/26/2010,Always good food.  Plenty of sports to watch.
Adam B.,"Los Angeles, CA",334,1161,22,4.0,9/30/2006,Love this place! Beer is great. Hefeweizen in particular is really good. Jambalaya Pasta was very well done and the deep dish pizza certainly isn't Chi-town but it''s not terrible either.
Amber E.,"Santa Cruz, CA",66,159,2,3.0,9/29/2007,"I love BJ's usually, the pizookie and great beers BUT this BJ's is not my favorite.  I have yet to order something to go and actually get what I wanted, for some reason this BJ's is notorious for messing up orders for me and my friends, when I go to eat there it is usually a pleasant experience but that to go evilness that lies in the Santa Clarita BJ's is awful!"
Monica J.,"Canyon Country, CA",159,374,109,3.0,8/6/2008,"The food is not that great here BUT who comes to BJ's to eat food... You come for the DRINKS- my top 3 are: Pom Punch, Cantaloupe Martini and Poisoned Caramel Apple As for the BEER: Blonde and Hefeweizen are good but I usually get their cocktails and of course the PIZOOKIE- nothing better than a warm cookie (two different kinds) with vanilla ice cream on top that starts to melt...  But, if you need to eat... I like their Blackened Chicken Baked Potato and Spinach & Artichoke Dip"
C C.,"Valencia, CA",1,35,,1.0,3/5/2009,"The food here is decent chain-restaurant fair.  We go to Bj's only occasionally on request of my son, because he enjoys their brewed rootbeer.  But ONLY occasionally, because over the past several years I have never gone to this particular Bj's location and gotten anything less than horrific service.  Order mistakes are frequent.  Even when it's slow, servers tend to disappear between order-taking and check presenting.  I'm not sure when I've ever been there that someone in my party hasn't had to get up from the table to go get someone to serve our table in some way, even when sitting within a few feet of the host stand where 2-3 employees stand and chat. So, no.  No Bj's.  They really don't even deserve one star."
Yasmine G.,"Manhattan, NY",32,86,2,4.0,2/8/2006,"For Valencia, this is the best place for ""nightlife.""  A good beer and pizza selection.  And must have the pizookie afterward."
