Lisa H.,"Santa Clarita, CA",342,16,6,2.0,8/15/2011,"I've been here many times before, but this is my last option if I'm sticking to Town Center Drive. If you aren't sitting at the bar, you probably won't get very good service. I went in here for lunch today. My server was overly excited which seemed really insincere, and he kept forgetting my cocktail. After the food came, my guest and I ordered another round, by the time we were done eating, the drinks still didn't come so we had to cancel the drink order and just asked for the bill. As for the food, for some reason I decided to venture off of my usual chicken lettuce wraps that are absolutely delightful, to share a half bbq chicken pizza half buffalo chicken pizza. The pizza was mediocre, I would not suggest the buffalo pizza even though my server said it was one of the more popular of the selection. All in all Im giving them 2 stars, just because they have their own brewery that has a good selection of beer. As for the cocktails, much too sweet for my liking, instant headache and fatigue."
