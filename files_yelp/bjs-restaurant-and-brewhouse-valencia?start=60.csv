Candy J.,"Saugus, CA",3,27,13,1.0,7/18/2017,Dinner tonight. Hadn't been to BJs in a while. I ordered the mini deep dish BJs Classic Combo pizza. It came to the table undercooked with no sauce. Server took our drinks for a refill several minutes before the food arrived. My husband's meal was almost done before I finally got up to find our server to ask for our drink refills and some marinara sauce. Won't be back.
Bryan J.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,"Hello. Posting a horrible experience that my family had at BJ's (with one positive note). My wife, kids and mom (party of 5) arrived at BJ's at about 6:50PM last night. We needed to wait 30 minutes to get a table which wasn't a big deal considering it was a Saturday night. When we sat down the waitress was fairly prompt to come over to take our drink orders. We also order an appetizer (their app sampler).  The drinks finally arrived after 5 minutes. Still - no big deal at waiting on the drinks as we assumed they must be busy (although it seemed like there was a lot of empty tables). After about 20 minutes, we still had not received our appetizer. The waitress informed us that it should be out momentarily. A few minutes after that - they brought me my small bites Mac and cheese. I explained that I asked for it to come out with my main meal. They apologized and took it back. Still...no appetizers.  After 30 minutes, the appetizers came out. The waitress explained that they had a problem with the avocado roll which caused the delay. We started eating the appetizer - the avocado roll was nice and hot but everything else was Luke warm to cold.  After about 10 minutes of getting our appetizer our main food came out. Naturally we were only about 1/2 done eating our cold appetizer.  The main meal was ok and seemed to have been cooked as ordered. HOWEVER - remember the Mac and cheese? Well that didn't come out with the order. I asked the waitress about it and she said that she would check into it. She came back 10 minutes later and said that the Mac and cheese would be out in just 2 minutes longer. She noticed that my water was empty (duh - we'd been there for about an hour at this point) and said that she would get more water for me. They never came around to fill my water. However - someone did come to my son who had about 25% of his glass full of sprite and filled HIS glass with water. I informed the waitress that he was drinking sprite and she went to get him another glass of sprite. After about 10 more minutes my Mac and cheese came out. At this point I had already finished my meal so I was so i told the waitress that it was too late and to send the manager over to me. The manager arrived and I went through the list of issues and he agreed it was not very good service so he comped the meal. We got up and left. I was so upset by the experience that we did not leave any tip for the waitress. Something about me - even when service is bad I ALWAYS leave 10% tip but my standard tip is 20% - I say this to give you an idea of how bad the service and food was. This was my first visit to BJ's. while the manager tried to make it right - I don't know if I am willing to give them another chance."
Brandon A.,"Castaic, CA",67,1,,1.0,7/14/2017,"Worst BJ's experience ever. I'm a big fan of BJs and we usually have great experiences but the one in Valencia, CA was a let down. Our waiter (Jill) was not attentive to us at all. Not sure if she was a new waitresses but I do know she ensured the people behind us was well taken care of. It took over 30 mins for our food to arrive while we noticed people around us receiving their food. Jill did not provide any status updates at all. One of us ordered one of the brew samples and was told by Jill that it may take longer to arrive. About 15 minutes expired with no updates so we decided it flag down Jill again. She told us it may take a few more minutes and asked if we would like to order something else. We told her we didn't mind waiting a few more minutes. A few minutes later, one of the managers finally informed us on what was going on. They were having issues with one of the brewers.  We know that BJ's is a quality chain and hope that this was a one time experience.  Overall, the visit was well below average. We were very disappointed at the hospitality the host displayed. On a positive note, the food was good."
Jillian S.,"Canyon Country, Canyon Country, CA",2,8,15,1.0,7/11/2017,"Terrible service and over priced for mediocre food and ambiance. I know some nights gets busy and it's hard to serve several tables at once, but tonight was not busy in the slightest and our table was just down right rejected for the duration of our time there. This has occurred on multiple accounts."
Kery G.,"Palmdale, CA",98,30,11,3.0,2/23/2017,"Haven't been to a BJ's in a while because their menu did not offer many decent vegetarian options. I'm happy to say that has changed! I had the Barbacoa cauliflower ""pita"" tacos with seasonal grains was excellent! 5 stars! The 3 stars is due to the overall lack of cleanliness. Restrooms-leaky toilet that sprayed water out of the pipe, and looks like it's been like that for some time, another that was completely stopped up and ""stuff"" on the partitions. Utensils and napkins on the floorWe also watched a napkin lay on the floor that was stepped on and over, had chairs and tables dragged over it before finally being picked up. Our waitress was ""OK"" but came back from a VERY obvious smoke break. Thankfully it was after we had finished eating."
Stephanie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,33,5,4.0,6/30/2017,"This is for our experience today and I'm giving 5 stars for our server Kelseigh (spelling?) and actually 4 stars for the overall restaurant itself. We come here once in a while and I have to say that Kelseigh went above and beyond for us. We had a moody toddler when we came in and had forgotten his backpack with snacks. She was thoughtful enough to bring us snacks with water while we were browsing through the menu without us even asking. It made the rest of the evening more enjoyable. She was also all smiles, genuinely nice and attentive. She was great and I think that tends to be key in chain restaurants where people are already familiar with the food."
LilNoohDad L.,"Fontana, CA",1,12,8,1.0,11/21/2016,Fernando is not doing enough for client service inside the restaurant.  He only greets...that's about it. Orders take so loooong to come....
Carol K.,"Kailua, HI",64,4,2,5.0,11/5/2016,"Awesome food, great fast service! I highly recommend the arugula, roasted Portobello with asparagus salad. Perfect blend of flavors. Our server was Melinda C.  She was great. Very friendly and never let our glasses get empty! We'll be back next year.  Aloha!"
The Last Honest Reviewer ..,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,58,31,1.0,10/26/2016,"Ordered a Buffalo Burger medium rare.  It came to our table well done.  I asked if they'd please try it again, medium rare as I had ordered it.  It came back a second time well done.  I swear it was the same burger they just took from me.  Now I'm pissed.  The service at this point was terrible.  I asked for the manager and asked him if he would assist me.  He said that's the best they could do.  I thought he was kidding, but he wasn't.  I did not eat the burger.  They expected me to pay for it anyway.  I found the GM of the restaurant and he saw things my way and comped us our meal.  What a mess!  Take a pass, you've been warned.   Excluding the GM, this place is run by amateurs."
Israel S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/15/2017,"Becky!!!! When I think Bj's and my favorite Tontaka stout, little miss bubbly smiles comes to mind. I am always greeted with a welcome heart. She is always looking for my best interests as far as recommending new things to me and is very knowledgeable and knows how to sell me on what she is talking about with menu items. Becky is an asset to this company and would be greatly disappointed if she ever leave but also happy for her at the same time to see her move on. I once get very intoxicated(good times) and she took the liberty of ordering me an Uber from her own pocket. She didn't have to do that but the deed will not go unpaid. I'm an avid spender at the bar top and always look forward to coming in, relaxing and having a few drinks. The vibe definitely is not the same when she is not present. Bennett was always a great bartender for BJ's in the past but Becky has taken over that spot. As far as that Jeff M. d%]*e canoe he must have gotten on her nerves. BJ's is better off without Jeff's business. I'm sure my friends and I easily make up for Jeff's absence."
Jared A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",157,3,,5.0,7/21/2017,My wife and I dined there last Wednesday evening with Dani as our server. She was great and she went out of her way to accommodate my wife's dietary restrictions. I also tried a new drink based on her recommendation. Paradise mule.
Richard B.,"New Vienna, OH",0,20,,2.0,10/12/2016,Service was okay. He was by no means in a hurry. Drinks went empty on a few occasions with our party having to look over at the waiter to get his attention. It was not busy and most employees sit around and talk amongst each other.  Food was nothing great or horrible. Ordered fish and chips and it was mediocre at best. Breading on the fish was thick and you could tell the oil in the fryer was old. Very bland for a $15 dish in my opinion.
J N.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,19,30,1.0,10/21/2017,"Disappointed in BJ's. Will not be returning. I just left kaiser urgent care and was told that both my girlfriend and I have food poising which came from here because all we ate yesterday was BJs, we had saved our appetite thinking we were going to get a great meal but that did not happen. First off, we were given the wrong drink the waiter ended up bringing us the correct one but did not apologize for the error. Smh no customer service. It took about 20 mins just to order our appetizer and alcohol, I thought that was way too long, we got the meatballs which were pretty good and strawberry splash and pumpkin ale both were good. 30 mins later he came to take our order (mind you the waiter never gave us his name) we ordered the brisket bacon burger and parmesan crusted chicken. Now here is where I probably should of sent the food back or complained which was my fault because I didn't we already waited over an hour just to eat and we were starving, well the burger and bacon were under cooked burger was medium when we asked for well done and the bacon was soft and soggy no crisp what so ever. The parmesan crusted chicken was cold and really over cooked extremely dry and lacked flavor it really fooled us because the food was platted nicely. The quality lacked tremendously. We also decided to order the trio pizooki, the monkey bread was burned and dry, the cookies n creme and chocolate chunk were good. They were the best part of our meal. Overall, would not recommend or return to this resturant. We ended up waisting 70$ for a meal that caused food poising. Smh. We will just continue to go to the cheesecake factory."
B C.,"Dublin, CA",0,10,,4.0,8/1/2017,We went to BJ's after a movie.  The location is great.  Free parking and close to shopping.  The service was very good  which is appreciated these days. The fried artichokes are amazing.  The rest of the food is just what you would expect.
Anthony P.,"Canyon Country, CA",42,12,8,2.0,2/16/2017,"Service was OK,  but the food was horrible!  My wife had uncooked brown rice.  We told the waitress and she brought out more Brown Rice,  which was also not cooked properly.  We complained again and the waitress acted like she didn't care and handed us the bill.  The  alcohol that was served to us,  sucked as we'll.  Bj has gone down the drain.  No wonder it was so empty.  Don't bother."
Suzy L.,"Palmdale, CA",48,30,22,1.0,7/1/2017,"Waiters have no charisma, they made us wait forever, finally got our food and it was cold. Not getting any refills. Still sitting here waiting for the bill..."
McKenna M.,"Santa Clarita, CA",141,4,,1.0,6/9/2017,"Sat down for about 45 minutes with just water... drinks, appetizer, and entrees never arrived. The people next to us got their dinner after being there 15 minutes. Told the manager and he just apologized. DISAPPOINTED"
Tiffany H.,"Calabasas, CA",171,188,366,2.0,2/21/2016,"I used to love coming to BJ's, but the quality I believe had since gone down significantly. The food just isn't as fresh, and tasty. The food is soaked in grease, and oddly spiced. The pizza came out only mildly warm. The menu is just missing good comfort food. They are trying to create dishes with less calories, but none of the dishes sound at all appealing. I don't expect to eat super healthy when dining at BJ's. Just stick to your old menu! Tastes better! This particular location has a lack of food runners, and people cleaning up the tables. On a busy Saturday night, our waiter was not only helping to take orders and bring food out, he was also responsible for picking up dirty dishes. We waited for him for about 15-20 min before receiving our drink orders. He also came back after another 15 min to get our food orders. The dishes also took over 20 min to come out. I understand that we had a big group, but I feel like they should be able to accommodate busy weekend nights a bit better. By not being able to turn the table over quickly, it causes more people to have to wait for a table for a longer period. They need more staff and to be more attentive. It was hard to find our waiter for the majority of the night."
Kim L.,"Los Angeles, CA",11,34,,5.0,10/12/2017,I set up a Dine Out for the school PTA.  They were extremely helpful and we made a decent amount of money.
Dave R.,"Granada Hills, CA",137,5,6,1.0,6/20/2017,"The last two times I have been here I have been disappointed... last night my drink seemed to be lacking the alcohol in it.. it was a Long Island Ice Tea... everyone at the table tried it and NO one thought it had alcohol in it... the waitress was very rude about it.. she took it back and had them remake it, then it just tasted like iced tea with lemonade in it... the manager had it remade again and it tasted a little better but the waitress was still very rude and actually slammed my drink down on the table when she brought it back to me ... the food was fine.... the service was so bad that I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."
