Ana B.,"Los Angeles, CA",642,86,363,1.0,1/23/2016,"I would give this restaurant zero stars if I could. It was really that bad. We came to this location for my dad's 50th birthday celebration with family and friends and it was terrible. I was really sad that it ruined my dads special day :( The customer service is horrific.  It took about half an hour to order our food and another half an hour to receive our drinks, utensils, and napkins. The waitress was not able to multi task to save her life.  I had to go to the counter from the patio several times requesting items. It seemed as if the waitress Serissa, was occupied and distracted the entire night. I also called the front desk from my cell phone from our table requesting the items once again. Also requested refills, water, and napkins from my cell. The waitress thought me calling from my cell was funny, and had the front desk operator Hector bring us the items we requested.  During our dinner one of the waitresses spilled an entire cocktail on one of our guests. Then came over with a napkin and tried to clean him with a smile on her face. Not apologetic what so ever.  Throughout the night our conversations were interrupted several times due to waiters asking us if we ordered certain food items that we never ordered. It seems that the waiters & waitresses don't know which table ordered what and they walk around with dishes asking every table whose food is who.  It took another 45 minutes to receive our check. At that time I finally asked to speak to the manager Fernando. The manager was kind and refunded the appetizers we ordered however, I still feel that that was not enough to change the night and compensate us for the treatment  we had that night.  I highly recommend going to Johnny Rockets across the street instead of coming here."
Lola S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,136,7,1.0,5/18/2017,Won't be coming back until they fix the ahi salad. The ahi portions are ridiculously small compared to what the used to be or even compared to other restaurants for the same price.
Austin B.,"Mission Valley, San Diego, CA",63,27,6,1.0,4/19/2017,"Came here after 6 flags on a Wednesday the service seemed fine at first then we got our appetizer and found a long black hair fried in the calamari and when the server came back his response was no Bueno let me get you a new one. We asked to take it off and still got it after our food came out. I spoke with the manager and he told me ""nobody's wants hair in there food"" and ""I'll speak with my kitchen staff about it!"" The service was extremely slow on a day where it's wasn't busy at all! Overall it was a terrible experience with no resolution to the problem I mean you find some long hair in the fried calamari you were already eating is just plain nasty and for the server and manager to not care is pretty crazy so that's why I'm posting this review to warn others!!"
Patrick T.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/19/2017,"I must say I'm very disappointed with the service received. We placed a delivery order online at 6:08pm. Two hours later!!! Still waiting for our order. One pizza. One sandwich and appetizer. We called the restaurant to check on our order. After waiting approximately 15min on hold we hung up and had to call the restaurant back just to speak with someone. We were just told our order is on its way and we apologize ""but we are still getting the hang of our online ordering process"". After 30 more minutes our food finally arrived!! Two hours and 30 minutes total wait time!! We check our food and discover they sent us the mini pizza (4slices) when we paid for a medium !!! Call back the restaurant and spoke with store manager Mark who was very apologetic. Mark took down our information and informed us they would be happy to send us a gift card and we would be contacted shortly. 3 days later still haven't even received a call or email. Unbelievably disappointed."
Jennifer B.,"Valencia, CA",48,6,1,1.0,6/19/2017,"Came back again on a Sunday night very pleased that the bathroom was stocked and trash was not everywhere. HOWEVER, came back on a Monday night and boy oh boy disgusting as ever. Only one stall with a roll of toilet paper which had been rolling on the floor. Trash everywhere. I went to inform the hostess but no where in sight. I guess I didn't learn."
Janie A.,"Sylmar, Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/15/2016,"We came to celebrate with some friends from out of town and chose bjs because it used to be a great place to eat. We haven't been here in over a year and so much has changed, completely for the worse. The service was mediocre. Our server had way too many tables with large parties to handle. It was difficult to get his attention and we were often overlooked. I dislike feeling like I have to wave down an employee to get service. The food was the next disappointment. It has dropped so far below what it used to be. The avocado egg rolls were mushy and had no flavor. Each of us had a different item from the dinner menu and the food was simply disappointing. Flavorless and the presentation was poor. It made us all very sad to have chosen to go to dinner there. Used to be great dining and now it's just not worth it. I hadn't realized how many bad  this bjs had become or we would have gone some place else. My low star rating will add to all the rest that this place now carries. Should've checked Yelp before coming here."
Josh M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/15/2017,I love this place it's not the best food in the world but it has sports everywhere and the servers are young and vibrant. If you do go there you should order potato wedges or artichoke dip it's good.
Nick D.,"Los Angeles, CA",430,17,6,2.0,3/25/2017,"I know I've said it the last 2 times eating here but this time for sure is my last BJ's ""experience"".  Once again NO stuffed mushrooms.  This is the 3rd of 4 times I've been here and they are out of stuffed mushrooms.  Ordered Brussels sprouts appetizer and for the 2nd of 3 times it did not show up....  kids meals came out ok.  Pizza cooked to perfection but chicken strips and French fried mildly warm.  Adult meals came out 10 min after the table next to us that we're seated 20 min after...  sucks cause I like the food.  In a bright side, server was wonderfully polite and apologetic.  Same with the last couple visits good service. The other BJS locations are usually dialed and will continue to give them a try."
George M.,"Valencia, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/4/2016,"The BJ's team guarantees a dining experience you won't forget.  Manager ""Fernando"" is people friendly and delivers on his promise to make you feel at home.   Sincerely, George M *****"
Dana A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,,2.0,5/13/2017,"If u are going to do it, just go for beer, pazooki, or those expensive ass avocado egg rolls, anything else - U WILL REGRET."
Food E.,"NEWHALL, CA",52,33,85,2.0,8/16/2017,"I normally rather not give a review if it's not good.. but i had to say this. I was not happy with how they prepared my order, I got the Hickory BBQ Bacon Burger, i asked medium well but i got Well done, overcooked and not enough bacon. I ordered and paid extra $1.50 for the sweet potato fries and it came out overcooked, somewhat burned, since it was unlimited, and i want to get my money's worth, i told the waiter to just give me regular fries and the waiter did not even try to make it right by maybe trying to replace my sweet potato fries with perhaps a less overcooked ones, instead he gave me (because i asked) for regular fries that was stale. :( oh boy... i guess thats why i dont really like going to BJs. Not only are they not really affordable but the quality of food is just ordinary, nothing special nor good. I should have taken a photo, i had friends with me and they like what they got so i didnt want to say anything."
Harry M.,"Cleveland, GA",35,48,,1.0,9/8/2017,"Where do I start? The reviews for this location were not very good but I was intrigued and had to try. I would like to give it no stars or minus stars but Yelp won't let me.  -2 Stars (yes that means minus)- Mark the manager? who seemed completely clueless as to what was happening in his restaurant. He also doesn't know what an iron is or if he doesn't want to iron his shirt then he should take it to the dry cleaners.  -4 Stars (yes this means minus as well)- the wait time. I checked the bar because I didn't want to use a table for my party of one. It was full so I waited. They said 10-15 minutes and it was 22 minutes. I am not complaining about that. My issue is that there were more than 5 tables and more than 5 booths available when my wait time started. That is not including 4 tables outside and many many tables inside the garage door area. (I later found out that the tables in the garage area were reserved for a very large party). There were always a dozen or more parties in line before me and as I left while there were always 10+ tables clean and clear sitting for extended periods of time. When I was seated I got a booth that was available the entire time and 3 of the other bothers were still empty and 4 of the other tables were still empty. Did I mention that at any given time there were at least twenty (20) employees milling around? There is absolutely no leadership here what so ever. +5 Stars - my server Danielle - she was fast, she was courteous, she made selling suggestions, and she was attentive. +5 stars - the deep dish medium gourmet 5 meat pizza. It was excellent! This place needs a  ""secret"" visit from corporate to see what is happening. I now completely understand some of the other very negative comments. The potential for this location is great but untapped and it will continue to lose customers if the issue isn't fixed. If management isn't changed I will not be back and at this point I cannot in clear conscience recommend that anyone go to this location. I regret this review as I really wanted to prove some naysayers wrong. Very sad."
Megan S.,"Canyon Country, CA",20,7,,3.0,4/23/2017,"I like BJs,  food is great, don't get me started on pizookies! But......how is it every time i go in the are either out of or run out of mid meal of black cherry soda? The waiter told me they don't make a lot of it, since they don't sell a lot of it, so they run out quickly. Hmmm, supply and demand? You would think they would make more if they run out.  This is the one thing that displeases me ok a regular basis."
Israel M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",50,7,1,2.0,7/10/2017,"Got seated and were not greeted or asked if we wanted water or needed anything for a good 5-10 minutes. One beer order took 15-20 minutes to arrive. Salad order was messed up once. Pizza order was comped because our vegan friend couldn't eat it after she specifically said she didn't  eat meat. Everything took too long and they were not really busy. Server was nice though, very friendly and sorry for what happened. Food was good but service wasn't. Two stars for server."
Dot O.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,69,115,1.0,2/19/2017,"The food was a waste of money, pulled pork BBQ sandwich was too salty, the Avocado rolls too soggy and bland. The server was actually great she was so busy, I had to acknowledge her for that, she was taking care of over 20 tables and I saw other servers just sitting around!! As for the food for me it's a no go again!!!"
Regine B.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",0,4,3,1.0,5/2/2017,We used to love coming here for family get together but unfortunately the food is really bad with the exception of dessert! What happened??  Service is great. This is so disappointing.
Alex A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",4,16,18,2.0,8/6/2017,"Wife ordered ribeye steak, was told they were out?!?! So her and I ordered prime rib steak. 1/3 plates came to the table burnt. Ovious that steak was plated to hide issue. Should have never been served. New plate was served 5 mins after everyone had finished eating. Other steak that was ordered was cooked properly, just bland. So I asked the waitress for steak sauce 3 times, never came. Ribs plate was very good, according to my son."
George M.,"CANYON CNTRY, CA",1,4,,1.0,11/4/2017,walked in to the restaurant to be welcomed by a quiet hostess. who then waited for me to ask how many were being seated. then when i sat down it took them 8 minutes to have a waiter ask me what i wanted. poor customer service and extremely poor communication skills upon the staff.
Pau C.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,5,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"Terrible nightly service, my husband and I waited a long time for the waiter to appear and never arrived so we better left the place!!"
Mrquality G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,3,1.0,10/17/2016,"I don't like having to write a bad review.. But, seriously how many ways can you screw up the ""Salmon Quinoa Bowl"", ""Lemon Thyme Chicken""; and the ""Barbeque Bison Burger"". 1) Drinks took over 20 minutes to get, 2) Salmon was RAW, Chicken way over Cooked, Burger got dropped by server who picked it up put it back on plate to serve my son.!! 3) Sent the entire order back which close to 40 minutes to get .. 4) Totally burned Salmon, Chicken was still pink, Burger did not have the fixings. Spoke with manager who did not comp., any cost of meal... I told them I would pay for drinks & a Burger. Save your $$$ unless you want to pay for bad service, lousy attitude, and uncooked food."
