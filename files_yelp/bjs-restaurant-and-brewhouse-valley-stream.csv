Vandana P.,"Jamaica, NY",219,110,207,5.0,1/7/2018,"This spot is located in the newly renovated area of green acres ""commons"". It's pretty big inside, lots of seating choices and a huge bar area.  Drinks: there are soooo many types of drinks you can have here. They have them all displayed, one may get flustered and have a hard time ordering one (me). However they have a some what helpful scale on their menu of beers from light to dark. That really helped me out.  Food: just like the drinks, there is literally everything on this menu. E v e r y t h I n g. Pizza, burgers, fries, steaks, sea food, pasta.. and more. I was so overwhelmed by eventually picked something different from my usual orders. That night they had a special on burgers that included unlimited fries, cool! I assume they have different specials on different nights- just an assumptions.  I would definitely recommend this spot if you're in dyer need of food and want a wide selection to choose from!"
Laren E.,"Rosedale, NY",82,46,383,1.0,1/10/2018,"So let me start by saying I live in the area and I love brew houses. I visit green acres mall often and decided to give this place a try. I was not pleased at all: Pros:  The staff are very friendly and upbeat, even the Manager. Upon arrival until departure all staff were very nice. The waiter( didn't get her name) was informative about the elaborate menu and offered her suggestions. The bathrooms were very clean. I love a clean bathroom. Its also has a modern look with a unique hand washing fixture.  The décor to the restaurant is very nice and its spacious. The bar setup is stunning and neat. Cons: The restaurant has a smell to it like someone used the same dirty was over and over again to clean the whole place. Also the menus need to be cleaned as the pages stuck together .  My waitress forgot my ENTIRE entrée, as in she took the liberty of suggesting what entrees were good, took down my order, and it never came out. Good thing I ordered an appetizer (will get into that in the next paragraph). When our check came I realized my order was never even on the check which means it was never even taken, which means the waitress must have been doodling on the portable device she was pretending to take my order with. My mother was so shocked but by that time I wasn't.When I received my appetizer I did not receive the pickles as advertised on the menu however the sausage was good . My nephew had mac and cheese which was kraft mac and cheese , and was advertised as such. I thought that maybe they would have brought it up to restaurant quality seeing how much it cost but I was sadly disappointed again and so was my nephew, and he LOVES mac and cheese, and he's 3. I ordered a flight of different beers being that I love beer . EVERY SINGLE BEER was TERRIBLE. My mother ordered a burger and she loved it. I had a small bite, seeing at the time that I was never going to get my entree, and it was actually delicious HOWEVER I will not be returning to this restaurant . I eat all over at green acres mall from Fridays, to Applebee's ,  and Bronx BBQ and I was very disappointed with this place and it was my first time. I just can't take another risk with the restaurant."
Johnny B.,"Queens, NY",7,23,10,4.0,12/16/2017,"The place is very spacious and clean. They have an incredible variety of craft beer. Their hard liquor selection is quite admirable. The bartender was Brie and she had a sweet personality.  I would've given this spot a 5, but the ribeye I ate was extremely bland. It was as if there was no seasoning at all. But the Wings were good, and so was the Bourbon.  I also appreciate that the staff is diverse and friendly."
Lesly L.,"New York, NY",1403,90,583,3.0,11/30/2017,"Hey Yelp Family, Coming at you with another review. This one goes to: BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse.  Very new in Valley Stream, this establishment serves up as a pop in and stay for a while feel. I've only been here twice and don't intend on coming back until the customer service is under control.  One night after a tiring day, I just wanted something to eat and a beer. I knew about this opening for a couple of weeks so I decided to come and check it out. I walked in with my wife and waited to see a hostess and the stand. Wait...Wait...Wait some more and still nothing. At this point it has gone past 5 minutes and no one came to greet us. Much to my surprise, the hostess was in the back chatting and giggling with her workmates. How do I know? As I stood there and wait, I found it kind of odd that a large group of workers were just standing there socializing and it was a busy night. The hostess comes to seats us and before we sat down, we noticed that the table hasn't been turned down. Hostess quickly grabbed someone to clean it down for us. Thank you for that! Now we play the waiting game for our waitress. Busy night, I get that but still not good. They should have the hostess take our drink order or something to that fact. Just a thought... After a whopping 25 minutes, the waitress introduces herself and apologizes for the delay. Her excuse you ask? I thought one of the other people up-front were covering this table.. My response? Oh you mean the 7 people hanging at the hostess station? She laughs.... I cringe some more because my tummy is ready to get BUSY! She takes our drink order, and asked me what I wanted to eat. I told her her: the salmon on a bed of quinoa. She makes a joke as i return the laugh and she ""writes down the order"". At this point, she is checking up on us frequently to make sure we are ok. Cool! She comes in and checks some more.. and more... and more... No plate in her hand. I stopped her and asked what was the update on my food. Just as soon as she said that, my wife's dish comes out. Where is mine you ask? I asked the waitress the same thing and she then replies: Oh you were serious about the salmon on the bed of quinoa? Ever see in the cartoons where they get pissed off and smoke blows out the ear? Well... this slowly started to happen. I immediately asked for the manager. No more games! The manager quickly comes to my table and offers an apology and gives me a glass of wine on the house and comps our bill. If I could remember his name, I would definitely tag him. But I don't so Thank you manager! At this point, my wife is upset that I didn't get my food so she decided not to eat. Isn't she lovely? Isn't that loyalty? If you're looking for a last minute spot to go and kickback, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Who knows, maybe they've changed.... Well until next time yelp family: keep on yelp'n!"
Candra S.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",43,59,64,3.0,12/23/2017,"The set-up of BJs is nice and if you are into beer, they have plenty to choose from. This was my second visit and although the food was ok both times, there's nothing really amazing about it. I actually find the food to have some kind of ""after taste"". It might be the type of oil they use to cook it in, but it does not tickle my fancy. Lol"
Mj F.,"Jamaica, NY",29,55,186,3.0,1/5/2018,I've been here a handful of times and it's usually hit or miss. This time was a pretty big miss. No one drank their cocktails because it tasted horrible which was upsetting since we had to wait for one of the drinks because they ran out of glasses. The food was okay but it was tough getting our waitress attention. The experience was so bad that I offered to pay the tab since I was the one that recommended BJ's. This will be the last time I recommend this restaurant.
Alexis P.,"Queens, NY",71,13,7,4.0,1/9/2018,The reviews are half good half bad. So I just had to try for myself. This place is so nice inside and menu is huge they should cut back! My bf and i were overwhelmed they are very overpriced. We wanted to get drinks but with the food prices were afraid of how much cocktails would be especially if they barely had alcohol in it. We started with cheese dip which was good I had to stop myself. I ordered the Santa  Fe salad and my bf ordered the quinoa bowl with shrimp his food was bland but its quinoa so duh? My salad was good! Our server was nice and funny. The mini chocolate chip pizookie was yummy! I'd go back again!
Stephanie A.,"Plantation, FL",67,36,128,5.0,11/18/2017,One of my go to spots. I am also and a member of there premier program and it's free to join. I get lots of great perks. The food is always fresh and delicious. The staff is super friendly and fast. I love coming here for the happy hour and I come here often ! I have tried a variety of things from the menu  and they have all been a hit. They have something on the menu to cater to every appetite.
Wesley M.,"Hollis, NY",7,34,53,3.0,11/12/2017,"When it comes to service there needs to be huge improvements made here. Upon walking in and informing the hostess of the party size there was nothing else communicated. No ""a table is being cleaned,"" ""it will be a x minute wait,"" nothing. After sitting, and waiting to be called we watched as others came in and were seated. Making sure we weren't ""forgotten"" I ask the hostess how long the wait would be to then find out the table we were waiting on to be cleaned (unknown to us) was still not cleaned. It was the manager who jumped in and cleaned the table. Much respect to that manager as well who took the time to greet each and every guest.  After finally be seated we order the avocado egg roll, cherry chipotle boneless wings and a nashville hot chicken sandwich. I really enjoyed the egg rolls and would be back just for that. Whatever the sauce is that's served with that dish is great! The wings portion was huge and the sauce was pretty good. There wasn't anything special I found about the sandwich. The chicken was however moist, juicy and not dry. There are a lot of menu options and it can seem overwhelming, but there's literally something for everybody. I have not ruled this place out, but the service needs to be better."
Keisha Y.,"Queens, Queens, NY",70,4,1,5.0,10/29/2017,Excellent service.  Good food and drinks The manager Camla was very nice and friendly.  Our server Aaliyah was awesome and just a sweetheart.  I recommend to all!
Vee H.,"Concord, NC",109,161,1026,4.0,7/13/2017,I stopped by BJ's Restaurant & Brewery for a late night dinner and OMG was it good! I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and red skin mashed potatoes and it was great! I've been back twice for more. If you are looking for a great menu and a huge selection of beers and wine this is your spot! Update: Be sure to check out the weekday specials which come with a salad and dessert!
Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,436,1147,2.0,9/24/2017,"I was very excited to try BJ's after it opened at the new shopping center Green Acres Commons however, my dining experience here yesterday has helped me reach a final decision to never return again.  When we arrived I was blown away by the size of this place and the modern warehouse fixtures were very alluring. This is your family restaurant meets brew house. I would recommend this place ONLY for the brews. Nothing more. If you want good food, cook at home and buy a 6 pack of Corona. We were greeted by the staff who were pleasant and accommodating. I reviewed the menu like I was studying for the SAT's. I decided on the blended brew ""Red Apple"" a mix of a angry orchard style brew with another house favorite. This was very delicious. Very crisp and it had a nice punch to it. It was the only thing I enjoyed. Our waitress arrived and she aimed to please. She and the waitstaff brought out everything on time. We were dining with 3 children and their food came out first. The children's menu offers a plethora of different menu items and sides for the children's prices at $6.85. My daughter ordered cheeseburger sliders which appeared edible.  The trouble occurred when we ordered the ""Avocado Eggrolls"". These were not good at all. What arrived to our table were 6 Tortillas wrapped in what the Manager described as ""cream cheese"", with sliced Avocado. No seasoning. None of the ingredients listed on the menu. No cilantro, no peppers. Just a slice of avocado in a cold tortilla. Correct me if I am wrong, that is NOT an egg roll. I asked the waitress if these could be substituted or taken off of our bill due to the disappointment. She summoned a manager who was an older Latino man who without a name tag and failed to introduce himself. He approached our table very frazzled and clearly bothered by our complaint. He asked what the issue was. I explained that the ""egg rolls"" were not good and that they do not fit the description of the appetizer listed on the menu.  Strike 1: He aggressively and in defense mode responded ""They are not good ? Or YOU do not like them ?!!"" I was seated with family, including children. I stared at him at this point. I repeated They are not good. None of the ingredients named on the menu are included on this item. (This is now your opportunity to recreate the menu item as it's described or give me my money back) STRIKE 2:  He proceeds to debate with me with a very condescending tone. ""You are mistaken. There is cream cheese...."" I see you ate half the order.  Let's do some math!  There are 6 terrible Eggrolls.  There are 5 people at the table. 3 people ate 1 Eggroll. Three are now 3 remaining.  I ate 1 sir. I wouldn't dare consume another.  Strike 3: He then in frustration removes the item and says he will remove it from the bill.  The first lesson in running any form of business is  1. The customer is always right !  Perhaps he needs a refresher course. How dare you debate me. How dare you argue with a customer while dining with family. The rest of the meal was terrible. I ordered a sirloin steak for $19.50. The meat was as tough as a leather belt. I was curious to try dessert but decided this establishment will not rob me of another penny or any of my family time. I witnessed another customer returning what appeared to be a very cold burger to the same manager. I witnessed him take care of that right away without a condescending tone.  If you want to enjoy dinner and drinks, Bronx BBQ is just across the parking lot. I know the manager there and he values his paying customers that have kept his business open for 10+ years. I don't foresee BJ's sticking around for too long if customers are treated so poorly and the dining experience is lackluster."
Will G.,"Honolulu, HI",1,70,527,3.0,10/11/2017,"The service could have been more attentive but for what it's worth, it was feasible!  Went there over Buffalo Wild Wings and really liked the decor.  The bar looked really high class with all the colors and the big screen televisions made it feel like a bww!  The wings were pretty decent but it's pretty tough to mess that up.  The $10 burger was delicious as well with bottomless fries.  Had to ask for water about 4 times but they always brought new glasses.  They were all very helpful and hopefully will get better as time goes along."
Jimmy B.,"South Ozone Park, NY",103,26,4,5.0,11/25/2017,"So glad they brought this restaurant from the West Coast. I first went to this place in Bakersfield/Fresno, California and it was pretty awesome. The waiter here attended to our every need and the food was phenomenal! The ambiance reminded me of a better version of TGIF or Outback Steakhouse. Soup: Tortilla chicken (would not recommend: Salty and small portion for price) Appetizer: Meatballs: (would not recommend: tasty but a bit undercooked I might add) Dinner: Sante fe Salad & Chicken Finger Salad = BOMB (HIGHLY recommend!) Brews: AMAZE-BALLS! (Highly recommend!)"
Vincent T.,"Long Beach, NY",322,172,3,4.0,9/26/2017,"Stopped in for a quick lunch after Home Depot.  Never heard of BJ's before, but was pleasantly surprised. I'm not typically a fan of the franchisey TGIFridays type places.   Bartender was attentive and friendly, offered to let me try any of their beers (awesome selection). It was happy hour and they had amazing specials going on for both food and drinks. I had a Supreme personal pizza and a BJ's beer.  The bill was like $9.  Pizza and beer were both great. I guess I gotta go to Home Depot more often."
Sheena O.,"Queens, NY",123,59,112,5.0,9/24/2017,"Went back and everything is still good. This time I got the avocado rolls by themselves and the Brussels sprouts as a meal. Tjise Brussels sprouts were some of the best I've ever had. So delicious. As I've said before, there really is something for everyone at this place and with so many other food options around, this place is rarely ever crowded and the service is relatively fast."
Mary W.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,91,482,3.0,8/27/2017,"We were sited right away even though hostesses were debating who will walk us to the table. It took about almost over 10 minutes before our waitress came to our table. We ordered combo appetizers,  which to our surprise you can feed about 4 adults with one plate. I had a derby salad and my husband had a brisket bbq burger. Portions are big enough to take home left overs. Service needs improvement. It was a mission to get a box for our left overs and waitress was missing in action most of the time. She did bring me raspebbery flavored sparkling water when I told her my cucumber mint was horrible, points to our waitress. Otherwise food was great."
Tasha M.,"Lido Beach, NY",52,58,165,5.0,1/17/2017,"Had this place bookmarked, was finally able to try it out. Met a few friends after work to eat, drink and mingle. It was a perfect Monday, no crowd and great service. I arrived first and decided to have a drink. Went with the Tasters Flight of 4 different beers. I choose all ciders (not much of a beer drinker). My friend had a cocktail but forgot the name.  Once the final guest arrived we requested a table and was seated immediately. One of the ladies been here before and loved the wings. Our waitress was welcoming and helpful on suggestions.  We decided to go with the Wings (flavorful), String French Fries(yelp recommendation), and Avocado Egg Rolls(crunchy, not greasy) as an appetizers. As for entrees we had the Blacken Atlantic Salmon(cooked good), Chicken Alfredo, and Cheese/Tomato Deep Dish Pizza. I decided to order another beer (Pear Cider, very refreshing). We all can't wait to go back and try something different (huge menu). BJ Restaurant and Brewhouse is definitely recommended."
Tim C.,"Lowell, MA",0,2,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Watch for theft from employees.  Apparently the thing to do now is for the server to change or add a tip now after you leave.  2 emails and a phone call with manager, and another to corporate office with no result.  I suggest you avoid this chain that allows this, and at other places, pay cash. ** Update. So the general manager asks me to contact the restaurant,  to make it right. If he read the original post, he'd know that i already reached out 3 times, with no luck.  In fact he might actually be the manager I spoke to on the phone.  I've made it right by choosing not to return to BJs."
Gael M.,"Queens, New York, NY",156,189,85,4.0,12/17/2016,Seems their service has picked up since I first dined in here. The trend seems to be better service near the bar area. Bumped these guys up to 4 stars! Check out full review below.
Lisa S.,"New York, NY",2,15,25,3.0,11/19/2017,"I must say i tryed the rootbeer wings..and fell in love.. and had some churros to end it.. if u are in the area,  try.."
Lauren D.,"New York, NY",161,42,1,2.0,7/6/2017,"My boyfriend and I wanted to try somewhere new in the area and since we are both into craft beer, we thought we would try out BJ's. He is big into reviews so he had me check out Yelp prior to us making the drive. I read that the food was pretty good  but the service was terrible. Against our better judgement, I said it couldn't possibly be that bad so we decided to try it, not expecting a world class meal but again.. something new. When we arrived, it wasn't crowded and they sat us right away. This is when it all went downhill. We arrived at 7:45-7:50 and sat at the table for 40 MINUTES without a waiter even looking at us. Both my boyfriend and I are very non-confrontational so we just waited hoping that one of the THREE waiters in our section would come over to us eventually. Mind you - there were four tables seated directly next to us and across from us that were being waited on. Even a couple who came in after us were getting their drink orders taken immediately.  After almost a full hour passed, I finally decided I had to get someone's attention because at this point it was either that or we would have to walk out. As I mentioned, I am not one to be confrontational, especially to people in the service industry but it was getting ridiculous. I went to the front and very politely told the hostess that no one had come to us yet and asked if she could send someone over. She was very nice and apologetic and said she would grab someone. She immediately pulled over one of the waitresses in our section and asked her to take care of us at which time the waitress blatantly SHOOK HER HEAD 'NO' and walked away.  The hostess then had to grab a waitress from another section who had a bunch of tables to attend to on the other side of the restaurant, and ask her to come over to us. She came over  right away and apologized very genuinely. From that point on, the night was fine as the waitress who did take care of us was very nice and attentive and the food was very good. But it did not make up for being ignored for a full hour. We both agreed that although the food was very good we will never be returning to BJ's because of the service alone. Such a shame."
Jason C.,"Long Beach, NY",788,263,2523,5.0,11/19/2016,"While shopping at the brand new Green Acres Commons (which my friend Christina J helped build), we were getting hungry. I see BJ's Brewhouse (NO, not BJ's wholesale club) and figured let's try it out?! What a great addition to not only Green Acre Commons but to LI in general.   Waking in you can already see the restaurant is very open and spacious. The bar is very long with all the bottles of liquor lined up ever so gently & neatly, making a very nice color scheme.  Greeted very graciously by our hostess and sat immediately. Our waitress (who I forgot her name- sorry) was very friendly & attentive. She was great! Service all in all was really good. No problems there.  The food was even better than it sounded or even expected. We were all satisfied and pretty ""wowed"" with everything. Yes, it's a chain but the food has a fun funky vibe to it. Everything that we tried was great! And of course you gotta save the best for last , make sure you save room for a ""PIZOOKIE""!!! You won't regret it- we tried a sampling of each and all were amazing.  One better than another. Try them all!  ENJOY my fellow Yelp friends !"
Nick C.,"Hewlett, NY",0,26,9,2.0,8/13/2017,I ordered the combo deep dish pizza was good. Crust nice and light like a focaccia. 6 slices good for a person with appetite. Friend had burger and fries. Also good. Service was good. Wish they had take out menu but rep said they ran out and on order. May come back. Conv located near mall and shops. Came back yesterday for lunch with a friend. Service was not good. Brought out wrong pizza and iced tea. Was double charged for the iced tea. Manager came over and after showing him check over and over it was fixed. Pizza and salad were tasty only good part of visit.
Tatyanna C.,"New York, NY",8,17,5,1.0,9/13/2017,"They almost killed me! I have a dairy allergy; I'm DEADLY allergic to dairy. Kitchen manager Keith said the soba noodles were safe *BUT* found out, it has heavy cream in the sauce. So they shouldn't be allowed to tell lies (or not know their ingredients) when it comes to people's lives!"
Gilbert P.,"Brooklyn, NY",369,29,31,4.0,9/15/2017,"I would rate 4.5 stars but I can't do a half star on yelp. I came with very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Ordered the BLT salad and it was actually a healthy salad with the right amount of vinaigrette. The pizza was good, not a true Chicago deep dish but I would order again.  The brisket burger was very good, next time I'll make sure the bacon is ordered crispy.  Our waiter was EXCELLENT!!!   He wet out of his way to explain the menu, to accommodate a kitchen snafu (we watched him write the correct order down) and had a great sense of humor accompanied with being attentive. I will definitely be returning!"
Lelosa I.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",40,13,65,3.0,5/31/2017,Been here many times and never disappointed except for the wait time which is annoying sometimes. They always miss something when you get your food whether utensils or a napkin or a straw. One time I waited 15 minutes for my waiter to give me ketchup. I ended up asking the table behind me after my food was getting cold. Their pastas are a hit and miss just go to Olive Garden. Their burgers are really good especially the Black and Bleu burger. They need to work on there fries I've tasted better so I always have them left over. Their pizookie is everything I always look forward to it. This place is literally a hit or miss. I went back a few weeks later to get my Blac and Bleu cheese burger and it was disgusting. I ended up getting sweet potato fries and some Root beer glazed chicken wings which were amazing. I just have to stick to their shareable apps and their pizookie because everything else it literally HIT OR MISS.
Malini G.,"Ozone Park, NY",52,44,935,3.0,4/10/2017,"Came here on a Thursday night for a birthday dinner. Walking in the space seemed very big and the bar area had a very colorful and pretty vibe (does that even make sense?) anyways the party we were joining were already seated and waiting for us to arrive to order. We got our menus however it seemed like we were waiting a pretty long time for a waiter to take our orders, one person in the party had to actually call someone over. But the waiters were very nice and helpful, a few of the people with us asked about drinks and beers and the waitress we had was pretty helpful. We got out appetizers and drinks quickly but the food took a bit longer. Throughout our wait, it seemed like three different waiters came over to our table, we didn't have one specific waiter, not a huge deal tho. My thoughts on the food is it's average. I got the jambalaya which was okay and I tried the mash potatoes which I thought was really good. Everything else pretty average. I don't think I'd be returning for the food but I would go back for the drinks. I had the sunset Alabama and it was very good. I saw on their menu that they have a lot of drinks and beers, so you'd be good in that department.  Overall, go for the drinks. Food is average.  Waiters are helpful, but not always present."
James E.,"Manhattan, NY",13,56,3,4.0,11/9/2017,"I've come here twice while around the mall. It's not inside the actual mall itself but within the shopping center zig zagging through the parking lots. I've had good experiences both times with the only ""con"" being the service is slower than most places even when not busy. Good/friendly service but just slow. It's a nice environment inside, very sports bar-ish, basically like a Miller's but with better food imo. It's probably the better food option out of all the other crap around Green Acres Mall. I kinda hope it doesn't get too popular tho cuz then everyone's gonna F it up like they always do when things become popular..."
Undercova A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,392,178,5.0,9/6/2017,"Decor: soaring ceilings, exposed ductwork, clever artwork and low lighting.  Seating is spacious, well separated and thoughtfully arranged. Food: whisper thin flatbreads, generously topped,  boneless wings are crispy and moist, exceeding expectations,  the curried cauliflower with lentils is unusual and rewarding.  The beer: make sure to order a flight and experiment with 4 oz pours.  The dessert we chose (a trio) was fun.  Some annoying gaps in service that I almost downgraded to a 3, but refrained from doing so bc I think we had an inexperienced or new server.  The manager came over to apologize, smoothing things over - a very nice personal touch."
Sheva M.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,3,3,4.0,12/10/2017,"Sooooo, this is my fourth time eating at BJ's and i keep going back for the deep dish pizza's. I thought it would be overwhelming with five different types of meat (meat balls, ham, pepperoni, sausage and bacon), but it was very good. The waitress, was not to my liking on this particular visit, but overall the food was good, the price was reasonably and everyone was happy with their order."
Dell C.,"JAMAICA, NY",11,34,43,4.0,2/18/2017,"This place was a niiiiice surprise.  Brussel sprouts were:  #LEGENDARY Spaghetti was solid, but meatballs were weak.  Staff was okay, not bad or excellent.  Mozz and tomatoes were fresh and tasty.  I'll def be back."
May Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,48,32,3.0,2/22/2017,"Tuesday night. No waiting time. We got a booth for a party of 5. Waitress was friendly. As it was not busy, we did not understand why the wait for drinks took a while to get to our table. While we were ordering, we were notified they had no french fries. One of us ordered the bison burger and the waitress came back to tell us there's no more bison burger. We ordered two appetizers, only one came while we were still missing two drinks, one of which is a soft drink. Midway waiting for our food, the waitress came back and told us they do have fries. Okay, food came, it was good food. We ordered: The Late Night Burger;  Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Crispy Jalapeño Turkey Burger; Roasted Chicken Peruvian Quinoa Bowl; Grilled Mahi-Mahi Tacos. But overall, the service was slow, food was good."
Nicholas S.,"Peabody, MA",41,9,4,2.0,12/3/2017,"Went yesterday for a bite to eat with the family after shopping. The atmosphere is very nice and typical for BJ's. Dark and wide open high ceilings and big booths. Server was nice and came quickly for drink orders and apps. The grand cru beer was great, it's a Belgian ale style, high alcohol and a slight bitter taste similar to Duvel or Chimay. The water and sodas took a few minutes the beer a few more then another 15 minutes for sliders and guacamole with chips and no apology for the delay. Within 1 minute we were served our entrees. So now we had all our food on the table and for some reason our entree was cold. So we returned the entrees and left after the appetizers were done. Sever seemed oblivious to the error but took the food off the bill.  The sliders were ok but it was obvious they cut a full size burger that was cut in four. Seems like a cop out to not have a separate patty. The guacamole tasted good but it was clear from the color that it was not fresh, as it was turning brownish. It's a shame as I've been to a few BJ's in Texas and they were very good. I think I'll wait for my next trip to TX before trying them again."
Kristin Z.,"Freeport, NY",25,115,11,3.0,2/11/2017,"****3.5***** TL;DR:  Food decent, Pizookies are amazing, service is slow...I'd go back for lunch when it's less crowded, or maybe a weekday evening.   We went in with the kids, 5p on a Saturday; the teen had been here before and wanted us to try a Pizookie so...why not. Place was already busy but we were seated after a quick check for a table.  Server came quickly and provided menus and took our drink order.  That's where quick service ended. We didn't receive drinks for another ten minutes or so. He took our meal orders then. I'm not disparaging our server at all- he was very friendly, had a great memory (another giant brain who takes orders without paper and ink), and got us refills when we were low; I just think he was busy. Food came out twenty minutes later, so, that wasn't bad.  Food was pretty good.  Picky Pete's quinoa (right!? He got quinoa!?) was borderline cold but the accompanying chicken was flavored well so he muddled through.  My baked ziti was huge and chock full of meatball, pepperoni and sausage.  If I wanted to nitpick, they should salt the pasta water but, it was good overall.  Teen got a hot ham and cheese with fries and it was demolished.  The fries are awesome.  Picky Pete, Jr. got chicken fingers with fries and they passed muster.   Had to wait to put in our dessert order and wait even longer to get it. But, it was worth it.  We each got a mini Pizookie- chocolate chip, double chocolate, salted caramel and monkey bread and they were all as good as the next.  I don't think you can go wrong. 3 adult entrees, 1 kid meal and pizookie, trio pizookie dessert, 4 soft drinks, before tip: $70 and change.  Enjoy."
Tam S.,"Lynbrook, NY",0,20,,2.0,12/23/2017,"We were doing some last minute shopping in the area and were hungry so that is how we ended up here. Very unfortunately we ended up with Brie as our waitress and I say that because, the place was not busy, only a few tables were occupied and this is a pretty big place and It took Brie at least 10 minutes to first acknowledge us at our table, mind you we are all of two people. We placed our entire order, water, appetizers and entrees and I told the waitress I needed the water to take medication. After ordering I went to the bathroom and when I returned to the table a good 10 minutes later, no water at the table yet. I eventually got up and went to the bar and got a water. 20 minutes go by and still no waters. We noticed several employees together talking and looking at their cell phones, but Brie was no where to be found. Eventually I went to find the manager. He apologized about the water and brought us two waters even though I already went and got my own. Of course we only wanted lemon in one water which we were VERY SPECIFIC about to the manager, but he ignored the specifics because he did not really care as far as we were concerned. So FINALLY Brie appears out of nowhere and pretty much slams two waters down on our table, it was an ""In-your-face"" water delivery. She saw moments before that, that her manager had brought us waters. No apology for her neglect of the table whatsoever.  We ordered two appetizers: Beets/goat cheese and the brussell sprouts sirracha, both of those were amazing. We ordered the turkey burger with the portobello swisse burger dressings. I do not eat fries so I had a side of sauteed spinach, both were amazing. We also ordered the Hand-pulled Turkey Dip sandwich which also was delicious. Sad part about this place is that the service sucks, but the food was excellent. Management needs to have more control of the staff. Cell phones while on shift should NOT BE ALLOWED."
Ray H.,"Bronx, NY",102,124,46,2.0,1/3/2017,"Came here with a friend for dinner. My friend has been here before and convinced me to come and try some of the dishes here. Upon walking in, we were barely greeted by the host. We were seated and our waitress seem like she had no people skills. The dinner was a little uncomfortable because of the waitress's mood.  The food was really good. After my entree I decided to get dessert, which was really good also. The food here was amazing. The only thing that I didn't like was the service. I think the employees should put a smile on.?"
Christopher E.,"Chicago, IL",64,258,518,3.0,12/29/2016,"What can I say, I love the ambiance of this restaurant and the hospitality of the people that work there. However, the food is a different story, it was horrible! I tried their quacamole burger and fries, because I had a big Christmas dinner the night before, and wanted something simple. I thought to myself how can you go wrong with a burger, but I was dead wrong! The meat was over cooked and fries were so hard and cold it was disgusting in everyway. The good part about my visit the waitress wanted to take it off my bill, but I told her I would still pay for it and even tipped her for being so nice. I don't think I would every try that burger again, even if you paid me. I don't know if there will be a next time, but you be the judge, try them out if you're in the area."
Mavely P.,"Valley Stream, NY",134,10,10,2.0,1/3/2017,"First of all, we came on a Tuesday which was as very slow day of the week! I'm currently writing this review as I am sitting in the restaurant waiting for the dessert.... Upon walking in there was no hostess to greet us. Then she walks up to us and asks for the amount of people in our party...5. She proceeds to place a gum in her mouth as she was mumbling something about a waiter... which I couldn't understand...  SO unprofessional!  The beers took way TOO long to come to our table, and even longer for the food to arrive. In total we spent 2 hours waiting for the food and beer on a slow Tuesday night!!   Only reason they get 2 stars is because The food was good! But The service is TOO slow!"
Elizabeth J.,"JAMAICA, NY",53,50,38,3.0,6/13/2017,"This past Sunday, my fiance and his daughter raved about this place, so i decided to try it. First time here and before I yelp the nonsense, i just want to say the food is great and they have an extensive menu... however the service not so great! Our server Dwight greeted us at our table, seemed like a cool guy. He took our drink and appetizer order ... My fiance and i both ordered a wheat beer and I asked for a Jameson neat, in which he commented ""you're bad"". I don't understand what that meant, nor was I going to ask! He then asked if my fiance's daughter was the designated driver... she's 12!!!  The drinks took about 15 mins. When we got our drinks and our appetizer... we then placed our entree orders with Dwight. I wanted a burger and was stuck between 2 choices, so I asked Dwight which one he would recommend. Going with his choice, i asked for my burger medium rare with bacon... and he commented ""What... Indians don't eat their meat like that""...... I'm not even Indian and i stated that, then he said ""you're Spanish, oh then you're just black""! First off, who are you to assume my race or tell me how I like my food. Flabbergasted isn't even the word! I don't know how and why I didn't flip out...i actually stayed to finish my food. It didn't even stop there, i don't want to rant on yelp, but this was an unpleasant experience, especially being that it was my first time here. Dwight even told us how he was mad he had to stay an extra hour for his shift. We don't need to know your personal business.... what happened to being professional. All of that lacked here for me."
