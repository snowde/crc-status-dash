S M.,"Uniondale, NY",0,13,,3.0,11/26/2016,"I went to this restaurant on a whim.  I had never been to this establishment before so I thought it would be nice to try something new.  Let's talk about the good stuff.  I was able to be seated right away with my family.  The menu has tons of choices so it took some time to decide what to order but I like having plenty of options.  I decided to play it safe and I ordered a jalapeno burger with fries.  It was REALLY good.  I enjoyed my food.  It came out hot and yummy.  My family members also enjoyed their food.  It was great.  The prices were fair.  Now for the bad stuff.  The service left a lot to be desired.  Our waitress did a good job taking our drink and meal order.  Then she basically disappeared.  She did not refresh our drinks and was gone for about 15-20 minutes.  I didn't think anything about it but I was hoping I would see her to refresh our drinks while we waited for our food.  Eventually our food came out. My family member's burger had no cheese and I was not brought the pickles I requested.  My family member had asked for mozzarella cheese originally.  When we said there is not cheese on this burger the waitress said oh we don't have that type of cheese.  Uh you couldn't tell us that before??  Okay we asked for different cheese, a refreshing of our drinks and pickles.  The waitress brought the burger and drinks but no pickles.  After eating, we wanted to order dessert.  The waitress took our empty plates and said she would be right back.  She did not come back for about 10 minutes which was very annoying.  I then started to notice that most of the waiters and waitresses were all basically standing around talking with each other.  We were right near the registers and we noticed there were about 6 workers just standing, talking and playing around for the rest of the time we were there.  I finally spotted my waitress and noticed she was busy talking to another worker near the kitchen door!!  She finally came back and we ordered dessert.  We told her we were sharing dessert.  She forgot extra spoons and had to go back to get spoons which of course took her a couple of minutes.  She never came back to get the check.  I asked someone else to do it for us.  She finally came back when we started putting on our coats and she asked could she help us pay.  We told her we did already.  I did not leave her a great tip which was interesting for us because we tip very well when we have great service.  Her lost ( I never did get those pickles) but the manager really needs to either toughen up on these workers or hire some people that will pay attention to the paying customers."
Carlos H.,"Central Islip, NY",0,5,4,1.0,5/16/2017,"Decided to come here after a meeting with a couple of co-workers, placed looked pretty cool. Walked in sat by the bar and we waited, waited some more, continue to wait, until one of us went to ask for service. Someone came over said they would be with us in a minute, so we waited, waited, continued to wait, someone came over again, said they would be with us in a few, and we waited some more. We even told the waitress that we were waiting for about 15 minutes and she got upset, at US, for telling her. So we decided to continue to wait, asked the bartender if we could get help, she asked a group of waitress that congregated by their POS system and they all looked at us like if we were imposing on their personal time. After waiting for 30 minutes, without receiving any type of service, we left to BWW. If you want to go to a cool looking place, to hang out and kill time before going to BWW this is the place to go.

Scott W.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,6,,4.0,10/30/2016,I'll start with the negative to get it out of the way. The service was terribly slow. It was busy. But not 2-2 1/2 hour busy. The wait time was only 15 minutes. The service was the only reason I gave 4 stars.  The food was very good. The selection of beers on tap was amazing.  No complaints about food or beverages. I will definitely give it another shot
Darren M.,"Rosedale, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/25/2016,If I could give this place zero stars I would because I have been sitting at the table for the past 45 mins and have yet to even give my order the staff are unprofessional and don't have any regards about their customer perception of the business being it is a new establishment. Regardless of the quality of the food the service makes the dining experience utterly disgusting.
Steven H.,"Garden City, NY",0,4,,1.0,3/7/2017,"i  only gave one star since the food was good.  i have never had such bad service.  my sled and my wife went to BJ's on Friday and used their their call a head seating and we were told we would sit at 8 and we finally got the text at 8 43 so that how our experience started. we sat for 10 minn and that server final came over,  she said she will be right back and  another 15 minn went buy.  she finally came over and took our order.  the food came out and was good but it took till our dinner for us to get drinks.  i order the parm crusted chicken and when it came the broccoli was rotten.  when i showed the server she just said sorry and would i like some more.  the thing that got me was never did a manager come over. So we then ordered desserts that was the reason we went my wife's friend told her about them.  so we got the 3 cookie one when it came out it looked great. i took a bite of the monkey bread one and started chewing and spit out a large piece of plastic from my mouth.  one i found my server ( one of the hardest thing to do ) i showed her the plastic and she gave us the biggest attitude and very snippy said you want another.  i was so done with this i sad just bring me the check.  so she did.  yet again no manager came over to us to say anything.  amazing that they dont care they were both just standing around talking to their employees.  But this was just the start.  they did not take the dessert off the bill so instead of causing even more of a problem i just paid the bill and left.  i then went home and e mailed their corporate office and explained what went down and i got no response if this is how they treat their guest that spend almost 100 dollars they would be around for long. you know what they say when you have a good time dinning you tell 2 or 3 people that they need to try this place when you have a bad time you tell everyone,  witch i have."
