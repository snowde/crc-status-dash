Joanna L.,"Valley Stream, NY",8,29,6,4.0,10/20/2016,"The Pros: Friendly wait staff, the fried calamari, blackened salmon and jambalaya (sp?) The Cons: No server for our scheduled section so waited a while in the beginning, avocado roll had a strange smoky flavor, my burger was overcooked (after bringing the wrong kind), too little rice with salmon.  I would absolutely return here for the food, beer and specials. The wait staff was very apologetic and nice but they need a few more weeks to get the timing of the food down. Salad came before drinks and utensils; dinner came when still eating appetizer.  We ate: calamari and avocado roll; jambalaya, gauc burger, bison burger and blackened salmon."
Latoya B.,"Jamaica, NY",4,45,12,2.0,11/6/2016,"I gave two stars for the drinks, the food is just ok. I got the steak, asparagus and fries, my hubby got the ribs and mash, and my 6 year old got the pizza kids meal (his pizza was delish). From the moment we walked in we got off to a bad start due to poor customer service. Here are some tips for management. There is no reason why customer service should be so poor when this location just recently opened.  Tips:  - Have the girls at the front desk greet guests as they walk in. None of the guests were greeted. Also when someone books on the wait list online they are seated quicker.... Inform your customers! It's not fun to see everyone get seated before you and not understand why.  - please have utensils at tables before guests are seated. Also make sure utensils are clean! Not that hard.  - season your steak and ribs, have more Steak sauce a available besides A1. Everyone does not eat A1 - wait time was not long, and drinks were very strong. Keep that up!  I'll definitely be back for the drinks. That is all!"
Mala H.,"WOODHAVEN, NY",0,47,34,3.0,5/27/2017,"Came here tonight and was skeptical because of the previous reviews. Did not order any drinks but they seem to have an extensive drink menu including different drafts.  Didn't have any issues with service, it's a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was very nice no issues with her. Ordered the nacho flatbread was an appetizer and it was pretty good. For dinner I ordered a turkey burger, didn't like it at all, it was greasy along with the fries, but it was very big. The person I was with ordered the New Orleans jambalaya and loved it.  I would come again and try something else."
Heidi A.,"Valley Stream, NY",8,13,10,2.0,4/13/2017,"I really tried to give this place a chance. The first time we came service was slow but I figured I would chalk it up to new restaurant kinks. The food was ok...not bad so we came back, same slow service but waiter was nice and food was ok not memorable. The last time I tried to go eat there because I was literally across the street shopping and hungry, my sister and I waited for someone to acknowledge us and take our order for 15 minutes in an empty restaurant, needless to say we walked out and I will not be returning."
Samantha M.,"Valley Stream, NY",56,15,5,3.0,12/30/2016,"Pos- nice service. Good beer. Nice atmosphere, not too loud, and clean  Cons- menu may as well be TGI FRiDAYS. Same good quality you would expect from those big chain restaurants.  Defined not terrible, but I hate fast food restaurants... so if that's what you're looking for then this is it!"
Raymond G.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,4,,4.0,6/4/2017,"I love this place from the meat lovers pizza do the parm. garlic wings, just great no complaints. Could never wait for the next time to go back."
John M.,"Melville, NY",0,20,3,1.0,5/16/2017,1 star is for the appearance.. if I could give negative stars for the service it would be a -5.. Sat there for 35 minutes waiting to be helped.. went up to the bar .. ignored... talked to a waitress.. 3x.. said someone would help us.. manager sat at take out playing candy crush.. all four waitresses ignored our entire party... what a waste having a great looking place like this them filling it with crap management and employees!
Boy M.,"Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, NY",7,22,7,2.0,3/12/2017,So at first you walk in and the place looks great we got seated within 4 minutes of walking in. The problem started when we ordered appetizers we got the one call best beginning which has wings and mozzarella sticks avocado rolls and spinach artichoke so the wings were still frozen. bit in it and inside was like ice the mozzarella sticks some how they forgot the cheese inside. So now we order the main course waited 42 minutes for it I ordered the rack of ribs with mash and seasonal veggies . The ribs and mash were good but the veggies smell so bad and I tried one and it taste like plastic I told my server can you smell this and his response was I'm not aloud to smell food so instead of bringing me fresh veggies he brings me a soda and says this is on the house like who order soda we were drinking wine .
Natoya V.,"East New York, NY",4,3,,1.0,4/2/2017,"So I live in the area and decide to try the new restaurant near me named Bj's restaurant & Brewhouse. I walked on with as a party of 2 and didn't get acknowledgement from the hostess until 10 min standing there. I was greeted by a nice young lady who seated me within 2 minutes. My boyfriend and sat at the table for 20 minutes and couldn't take it any longer and walked out. While walking out the hostess and Manager thanked me and told me have a goodnight. I then replied ""I will try after sitting and the table for 20 mins and didn't get greeted by a waitress/waiter. They replied omg I'm sorry. So how do I feel about this establishment you ask? I'm good the only BJ's I spend money will be the wholesale club. Very nice decor and scene, however staff/customer service sucks. 1 million thumbs down from me to this place. Thank you bye."
Steven H.,"Woodmere, NY",9,30,39,5.0,4/23/2017,"I was here two months ago so can't remember everything. However, I do remember how amazing their house stout beer was. If you like stout it's a must. This is definitely a place for the entire family, a group of friends or a couple. It was a Saturday night and the wait was around twenty minutes but worth it. Mini pizzas are awesome.  My waiter was very good and had a great attitude."
Nissa H.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",3,25,31,4.0,1/10/2017,I have been meaning to try this place. I've heard mixed reviews about this restaurant. We were seated promptly and and our drink orders were taken immediately. I love the fast paced service. Our waitress was very nice and the food was pretty decent. The lighting was dim and it was quiet for the most part. Good food and good conversation kept the night alive. I'd return again.
Simply L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,18,24,5.0,6/10/2017,Food is good. Atmosphere is similar to Buffalo Wild Wings or a Applebees. The staff is always very nice. Favorite dish so far is the parmesan crusted chicken with mash and broccoli.
Jasmine S.,"Manchester, CT",63,1,,4.0,1/8/2017,"Food here is really good and inexpensive. The jambalaya (easy spice) was great!!! Pizza was delicious and the broccoli cheddar loaf was perfect   Nisha was our server, she was very knowledgeable of the menu and a fantastic waitress. Only complaint was the hostess at the door she was eating a sandwich, which hinder her from greeting us upon our entry."
Iecfg F.,"New York, NY",0,14,9,4.0,1/5/2017,"Wonderful, accommodating staff! Large variety of beer to pick from, as well as a plentiful selection of foods expected from a chain restaurant. Doesn't do much outside of the box however, don't expect anything to knock your socks off besides a larger than average beer selection,"
Horace M.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,5,4,4.0,11/6/2016,"We took a chance to go there because it was close and it was late in the day. Ordered the jambalaya and the salmon and it was extremely delicious. Jambalaya was a little spicy but it was okay. Before the salmon, I actually ordered the deep dish ziti. It had a lot of grease / a lot of oil in it. And I actually turned it back, my stomach was actually upset from the oil. The manager and the waiter were very accommodating and they took care of it right away. The salmon was excellent! We will be back."
Andy M.,"Norcross, GA",0,6,,5.0,7/6/2017,"Really, really good food. The wings are super good. So is the superfood salad. So are the ribs and also the beignet with ice cream. Also loved the strawberry lemonade. The servers on the other hand could stand to be just a little more attentive."
Tosha C.,"New York, NY",0,6,,1.0,5/2/2017,"This place is terrible I came here with my daughter expecting to get a great meal and to try a few of their signature beers. Well, disappointed is an understatement!! After 20 minutes of waiting for a server no server ever came. What I did notice was many of the waitresses were more interested in flirting with the male patrons. Even when exiting there was no one even at the front to complain to; sadly I had to wait for her to come out of the kitchen. I informed the young lady that I would be notifying management and her response was simple a flat ""ok."" As an avid foodie I will not be recommending or encouraging anyone to eat at this establishment."
Fernando D.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,19,14,4.0,5/19/2017,"Tonight we had an excellent night. Everything was great. My wife had the prime rib Friday special, with mozzarella salad and mash potato sides, I had my regular order, black and blue burger, medium. Everything came out just the way we like it. Utensils were clean also.  It wasn't too healthy but it tasted really good. Service was excellent tonight, our server was Kelly."
Skyler O.,"Grand Junction, CO",22,5,,1.0,2/10/2017,"Mediocre food, mediocre beer. Was literally one of two people I the whole restaurant, yet service was awful."
Christina L.,"Cambria Heights, NY",0,6,,3.0,5/17/2017,"Food was ok, ambiance was really nice. The service was pretty slow. One great thing is that the chef was very attentive to my food allergies. Also there were a lot of healthier choices than most chains (ie Fridays or Applebees). I would return if I am in the neighborhood again"
