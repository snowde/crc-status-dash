Bobby R.,"Queens Village, NY",451,19,341,3.0,11/13/2016,"Food is good but service needs to step up. New in the the area they need to step it up. Place was not that busy , room for improvement."
Andy B.,"Far Rockaway, NY",0,15,,2.0,4/18/2017,"Shitty service but good food. We were seated our server never came to ask for water or drinks. We waited 30 minutes finally talked to the manager and sent some on over. She was nice took our order. We order a few apps, pizza and drinks. Brings water and apps 20 min later. I was hoping to have my beer before food arrived. Apps come out we finish the apps then she brings our drinks. Right afterwards the pizza. Food was good. Man service took forever, the need some way to organize there system. I watched people get serviced before us eve though they came after us."
Jasmine J.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,2,,5.0,6/8/2017,The food here was amazing. The hostess we had her name is Jessica I recommend her to anybody who comes here she was absolutely delightful. The drinks were great five dollars. Our food came out and it was still nice and hot and it came out really fast.  Me and my mom came here around 8 o'clock on a Thursday and it was not crowded great great great food for my first time here.
Roxy S.,"Hempstead, NY",0,3,,4.0,9/24/2017,Love this restaurant! The food and service is always great. Bri was the best server I've had yet!
Lisa D.,"Valley Stream, NY",199,2,,1.0,5/4/2017,"My first experience here was extremely terrible. The waiters and waitresses are slow, the food takes way to long to come, and the drinks are watered down. This was my first time here and will be my last due to this horrible service. I never thought a glass of water could take 30 minutes to arrive at my table as well as my food taking an hour. The place is a great ambiance but the service is not good."
Kiana R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,20,,3.0,9/21/2017,"When this place first opened it was outstanding, but as time went on it got bad. I'm not sure maybe they changed cooks or they changed the recipes to some food but it's just not as good as it first was which is more than disappointing."
Marsha T.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,5,,5.0,4/2/2017,This is my second time here. The food is great (you mut have the Bison Burger) and they have the BEST IPA ales in the country!!
Jay L.,"Rosedale, Rosedale, NY",0,12,4,5.0,4/28/2017,Visited this restaurant a couple months after it opened up. Ordered a burger and fries. I requested the burger to be medium-well and it was prepared well. The fries were well seasoned and the boneless wings I had for an appetizer were good. No complaints here.
Michael L.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",24,50,32,5.0,3/5/2017,Ok here we go. Totally shocked how good this place is. From the service to the knowledgeable waiter.  The food was not The normal franchise food. Excellent ribs. Avocado egg roll was yummy. Our main meal of crusted chicken parmigiana and shrimp quinoa Peruvian style was incredible. Hats off to the place.
Jessica D.,"Hicksville, NY",3,7,,2.0,2/4/2017,2 stars because the root beer glaze wings were good. Service was horrible! Waiter never even told us his name. Looked like he did not want to be there. Our wings came as an appetizer and we weren't given any plates or napkins! Kids meals came and we asked for napkins and ketchup. He drops napkins and comes back 5 mins later with the ketchup. Kids were sitting waiting to eat their food. Never came back to refill drinks. We finished eating and we're sitting waiting while he talked to his friends before we could get our check and leave. Really bad! We would probably come back if they stepped up their service skills.
Deirdre M.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,5,,4.0,8/19/2017,"My son and I came here on sat. Around 4, my son had the ribeye and I had the chicken sandwich, for app we had the chips w/ spicy cheese sauce, I don't like too spicy which my waitress said no problem. Great selection of beers. We loved everything, the ribeye could have been thicker. But overall I can't wait to come back. So much to try!!!!! I'm sorry I don't remember our waitress's name, but she was soooo nice."
Aleea P.,"Jamaica, NY",13,41,17,1.0,1/19/2017,I go out to eat often this place was atrocious the crazy part is I Google the place and had terrible reviews my homegirl said it was terrible and I was with her that night but against my  better judgment I went ahead and tried this restaurant please please don't waste your time it's pricey which is fine if  the food is good but the food was terrible my food came out so bad my other girlfriend didn't bother to order her food and my other homegirl cancel her order my drink tastes like Kool-Aid I just can't give this place any type of credit for anything last night they really need to straighten up before they are shut down
Anderson C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",0,11,4,5.0,2/24/2017,I've been here twice with my family and on both visits the food was great and so was the service. We weren't very familiar with BJ's restaurant chain but it does seem to remind me of the Cheesecake Factory. There's so much options when it comes to your meal and the pinapita piña colada was really delicious
Van P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,3.0,9/9/2017,I've dined here twice this week. Today was lousy. Screwed up my order an waited 1 hour to eat. Unacceptable
Maya C.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,58,12,5.0,9/28/2016,"Great attentive service. Strawberry lemonade, calamari, and clam chowder are amazing. Fries are addicting."
Khrishan S.,"Hempstead, NY",19,21,24,1.0,2/11/2017,So I decided to meet some friends here for some drinks and dinner . The drinks were ok the food was disappointing not flavorful the seasoning didn't exist . We waited for about half hour for the waitress to come serve us and she just wasn't attentive . My first and last time checking this place out would refer anyone to this establishment .
Lori W.,"Massapequa Park, NY",33,6,,1.0,3/27/2017,"At lunch time, No one at front to seat you than finally sit and order drinks, 25 minutes later receive drinks and place food order 20 minutes later you receive food. 20 minutes later had to find waitress for check.  Service is the worst I've ever encountered.  Will not return, no wonder place is empty during lunch rush."
Fabian V.,"Valley Stream, NY",21,17,1,3.0,10/26/2016,"Came in for the first time with friends... services was mediocre and the food left more to wish for. Got the guac bacon burger with a side of Caesar salad and a whiskey sour.  The burger was not medium as I asked but rather well done which was alright nonetheless, the salad seemed as it was left in the kitchen waiting for someone to rub it for a while since the dressing had dried up and dropped to the bottom of the plate. The whiskey sour was actually good just took forever to get it, ice was melted as well. The service took forever even though our waiter tried.  This place could be a very good and trendy place in the area but it must step up its game, not a good thing that just opened for a month and it doesn't leave its first time customers amazed.  Will come back eventually to give it one more try in the near future."
Sheyna L.,"Rosedale, NY",0,34,57,1.0,3/13/2017,"The food was not good at all. I ordered a medium well Brewhouse Bacon Cheeseburger and was given a medium rare burger. The ""supposed"" homemade black cherry cola was flat and did not quench anyone's thirst... The waiter was inattentive & did not care to check in on his tables. Lack of service. Nonetheless, I do not think I will be visiting again"
Rebecca C.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,38,74,4.0,1/17/2017,Enjoy this place very much. Would definitely return. As appetizer we started off with wings w/ root beer glaze and their deliciously awesome. As entree I had sirloin with White cheddar mash the steak was well done and well season. BUT Mash was the bomb. The Mr had the ziti he ordered because of the mix meat but the pasta itself was alright.
