Sabrina C.,"Valley Stream, NY",169,4,,4.0,4/4/2017,I'm only giving 4 stars for there craft beer selection. But the service I would give 2 stars slowest staff you know it's bad if you have a manager bringing your food and drinks out. Seems like they have more food runners than servers who also have no idea what table to bring the food to.
Sadaf M.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",95,8,3,3.0,1/13/2017,"Friday night- service was quick. The server who brought us to our table was rude, she didn't even greet us, brought us to our table, gave us our menus and walked off. Ordered artichoke and spinach dip and sriracha brussels sprouts for apps which were really good. I then ordered the jambalaya for dinner, which I wasn't pleased with. Too much salt, the tomatoes on the dish were canned, it kinda looked sloppy. Like something I would've made when in college while dorming, an experimental dish. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Our main server for the night was really nice. My overall experience was meh. Would I come back? Probably not."
Vee K.,"Valley Stream, NY",54,11,,1.0,1/30/2017,The resturant itself if beautiful.  The layout and ambiance is A1! I went there a farewell dinner for my partner that was being deployed... slowest service ever.  Waiter was very attentive but took almost an hour for our food to come out.  My 9 year olds food was still not ready.  Chicken fingers and French fries came out 15 mins after our food but the manager comped it....probably will not return was not my first visit.  Every time it's very slow with luke warm food.
Jason S.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,3,,1.0,8/20/2017,"So the atmosphere was nice, please explain why I sent my steak back twice yet it was still wrong, my brother's Alfredo was dry and it took an hour to get a lemon with the water.  Order drinks to come out with food waiter informed us that she already placed the order and it had to come out now. Waited 45min before even getting food. I would recommend the Cesar Salad that was the best thing that came out. Eat at your own risk!  Good Luck."
Dominiqua M.,"Jamaica, NY",224,21,17,5.0,2/21/2017,"Came here with a good friend of mine who've been here plenty of times since it's opened. I have to say, I loved it. We sat at the bar where we had an amazing bartender, Shawna ! She recommended me drinks and she knew exactly what I liked . I love the white peach margarita!!! She took our food and drink orders and let's just say, I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient everything was! I was impressed. My deep dish penne was a little dry but I think that was just me being picky because it's tasted sooo good ! Lol the root beer wings are EVERYTHING!!!! Also shoutout to another server Nicole!!! She was working that place!!!! Overall, staff is very hardworking and just amazing!! Food and drinks are great! Ambiance is lovely! Prices are good! & I Appreciate the variety! I definitely would come back ! recommend this place !!"
Craig H.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,5,1,4.0,1/20/2017,I've gone here twice and both times I've had a good experience. The wings  are a great appetizer and the soba noodles are a great healthy option.
Danii D.,"Elmont, NY",15,80,8,5.0,11/2/2016,"I went here with my husband and we really enjoyed ourselves. Our waiter Brian was one of the best waiters we've had at a restaurant. He was knowledgeable about all the beers on the menu and gave some great recommendations. The customer service here was not like the typical horrid Applebees, Olive Garden or Red Lobster that are in the area. And to top it off the food was really tasty and it matched perfectly with all the beers Brian recommended."
Meggi M.,"Mineola, NY",0,15,2,4.0,1/2/2017,Pretty good place for a quick bite. Probably because it's new but it's very clean. Waitress we're very nice. Lots of TVs. I'd go back again. Menu is similar to a Friday's.
Maria C.,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",0,4,1,2.0,12/27/2016,Food is below average for the price. We ordered the chile salsa verde dip and it was very cheesy- less chile. But the chips were really bad- oily and stale. The tuna seared salad didn't come as advertised- was poorly thrown together. My husband was happy with his burger and beer but fries were greasy  the jalapeño margarita was yummy. So my recommendation is to stick with basics and don't expect much.  The service is trying - server was nice.
Aneesa I.,"Hollis, NY",1,31,10,1.0,12/23/2016,"Seriously I wish I can give this place zero stars. If you happen to come here and have Amira (i believe that was her name )as a waiter just leave like she's just so rude. Me and my bf came here tonight, in the process of getting we saw a booth opened and asked if we can sit there we got the booth. A really nice girl came gave us our menus and left, another girl came said you were sitting there and came here I'm your server in the rudest way ever. Okayyy?? We order appetizers and drinking the appetizers came out in no time but we still had no drinks ... we stopped another server walking by asked her for our server , she finally came over with the drink and was like yes? With the rudest attitude again. We couldn't do it anymore just walked for the check and got the eff outta there. Girllll  I get it everyone has a bad day but stop taking out on your customers. Never again"
Star D.,"Queens, NY",24,5,,3.0,1/16/2017,"I really wanted to love this place since it's fairly new but I have to say it left a lot to be desired. We waited about 20 mins which wasn't bad for a Saturday night. We ordered boneless buffalo wings which were dry but good. We also had the spinach dip which was ok. I had the fire barbacoa chicken which came with brown rice and black beans. Can you say tasteless? Bleh. I could barely eat it and had to share my husband's food. He had steak and fries which was good. I was hungry so we blazed through his meal. I was scared to try anything else, so we skipped dessert. She must've known I didn't like it. My plate was full when we left. My husband's meal bumped it up a star. The waitress tried."
Dana C.,"Baldwin, NY",13,18,23,5.0,12/2/2016,"Love this place. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. He made a lot of suggestions and knew a lot about the menu. Overall, this is definitely a place I would choose over Applebee's or Friday's."
Reginald M.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",27,3,,2.0,2/7/2017,"I hope that tonight was just a slow under staffed night for a tuesday!! Sat at the bar was there 10-15minutes before I was approached, Great beer selection I knew what I wanted so that part was easy ordered the California chicken club.  Sandwich was ok should have been hotter due to the lack of customers in the place...patrons to the left and right of we paid their tabs and moved on the remnants from their meals remained on the bar for my entire time there.  Once I reached my patience level I got up paid my check the server probably didn't know I was gone for another 20 minutes....hoping this was just a bad night because it's local and has a great bourbon and whiskey and scotch selection along with numerous beers!!!!"
Timeeka M.,"Rosedale, Rosedale, NY",148,53,45,4.0,11/20/2016,"I recommend this location & restaurant to those longing for a restaurant with such a varying menu. Italian, American comfort, seafood, they have it. Huge bar. All without looking too casual nor too formal."
Jocelyn C.,"Rosedale, Rosedale, NY",0,1,,1.0,2/3/2017,I went for my first time with my family . Waited 15 mins for somebody to take my order  Nobody came to our table so we got up and left !!  Horrible service !!!!!!
Keke J.,"JAMAICA, NY",1,15,1,4.0,10/28/2016,"Just left here. Went for lunch with my family. We had the derby cobb salad, chipotle glazed salmon , bbq traditional wings, and super kale salad. I will say the portion sizes were the bestttttttt part about the whole experience. I was so full, i had to take some home. Only reason i didn't give it a five was cause the appetizers took too long. But the service was great. Make sure you download the bjs app so you can win a free pazookie! The oreo pazookie is the best one !"
Gingee L.,"Valley Stream, NY",7,11,14,1.0,12/30/2016,"Thursday night, party of 6.  Was pretty busy, but not crazy.  It was my first time, and because this place just opened and it appeared to be a cool joint with a fun vibe, I was so disappointed.  The service was horrible.  We were stuck with a waitress that had an attitude and wasn't attentive at all.  It took her 20 min to bring us water and drinks.  When we finally got our food (salads) we realized we had no utensils.  We had to wait another 7-10 min AFTER getting our food to get utensils!  What if our food had been hot?  This is a no, no.  What's worse is that we asked immediately for them, got a strange look and was told we had to wait (while she took another table's order).  The food was nothing fantastic.  For what they charge, they need to train their wait staff better.  That will be the first and last time I step foot on that place again."
Clare B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,13,3,3.0,6/30/2017,"I really enjoyed the paintings on the walls within the restaurant. Loved the boneless wings. Burgers are great. The waiters are alright, some very friendly and others less. The food took a while the past times I've been there and I even ordered different things each time. On busy days, the tables are a little messy. This place also offers good discounts during weekdays. Overall, it's alright and a casual place to eat decent food."
Earl G.,"Rosedale, NY",19,10,11,3.0,12/2/2016,"Im a tough critic to restaurants as my chefing skills are better than most. Hence not really impressed with restaurants. First impression being there only once. Service is better than the food. Average portions. Staff, in general, very nice. But u'll always have those few that have the attitude of really not caring they have a job. They don't offer bread while u wait for food. Unfortunately every one at the table sat there starving. But clean, comfortable, nicely decorated, and relatively quiet atmosphere despite the pub area. If they plan to stay they need more pizzazz in their food menu."
