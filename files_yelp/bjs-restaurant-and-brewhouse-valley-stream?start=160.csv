Lina L.,"Rosedale, NY",0,7,,1.0,6/29/2017,"My Best Friend and I went to BJ's Brewhouse in ""Green Acres Commons"" yesterday and the hostess was too busy talking to her little friends to properly greet us and sat us down at our table didn't say one word to us not who our server was or nothing. So we're looking at our menu's at the menu's are like textbooks so I'm thinking our waiter probably just giving us some time to make sure we know what we want. 15 minutes later another table's waiter notices us and asks if we wanted water or something. So i'm thinking maybe he's our waiter and will be back to take our orders after he gets the waters. He drops the water off and we wait an additional 25 minutes with all the staff INCLUDING THE MANAGER happily walking passed us. So finally I ask a passing waitress like... sooooo do you know who our waiter/ess is or....???? And she's confused like... wait ya'll was here the whole time and don't have a waiter. She's like going around asking everybody. A different hostess comes to the table and is like. ""So ya'll don't got no waiter? We're like no. she's like how long ya'll been waiting? We're like about 30 minutes. She's like who was your host? We describe the girl. She was like ""WOWWWW THAT'S AMAZING"" and walked away. So now i'm extremely confused then the waitress I originally asked was like well there's actually no waiters working in this section right now so idk why she sat you here but it's whatever I'll be your waitress do ya'll know what ya'll want to eat? Then when our food came out we had to ask them for utensils. Whole time no manager came over to resolve this issue.  Eventually I complained and we got two free Pizookie's which were great but WHAT? They've been open since September i'ma need them to step their customer service game all the way up. And the burger was overcooked and oily. And the ""bottomless fries"" apparently had a bottom. 1 star."
Gavin S.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/15/2017,"I've been here before, and the service was great, but it has gradually become worse as the restaurant has become more popular. I highly suggest not coming here on a Saturday night or on any other busy day because the staff is obviously incompetent when it comes to servicing a packed restaurant. First off, we waited for 20 minutes for a table only to see people who arrived after us getting seated first. Whatever, we're seated and out waiter comes over, who by the way has VERY little social skills, and takes our order. However, we waited 30 minutes for appetizers and our entrees came out first. Our waiter forgot about our appetizers and went to the kitchen to get it, but by that time the appetizers were cold. Fine, we begin to eat. I take one bite out of my burger only to spit it out. The chefs vastly undercooked my burger (Hickory Brisket Burger). Literally, it was red inside and extremely mushy, any sane person could see it was not cooked at all. The waiter comes over and sends it back, saying that the chefs are overwhelmed and that it is not his fault. The new burger arrives, but another waiter brings it and doesn't know where my table is. He goes around asking other tables until he reaches us (I was too annoyed to say anything at that point). Anyway, by the time my new burger arrives, the person I was with was already full - so we just brought the food home. My previous experiences here have been good, but this is the first time I came and it was packed. So, I suggest coming here when service is slow."
Danielle M.,"Valley Stream, NY",91,13,1,5.0,9/30/2016,Christine and Hola were amazing! Christine stopped to talk to us about how she is in NY from California to train. Hola was was great too. I ordered the deep dish pasta which was delicious. And my boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken with Sopa noodles. That was after the avocado egg rolls and potato skins which were also very good. It was nice to see a nice restaurant that took the time to both staff and train their employees. The service was great.
Felesha W.,"Rosedale, NY",1,4,,3.0,1/3/2017,The food was really good! But don't go if your super hungry. Wait for app alone was an hour if it wasn't for that I would have given 4 stars.
Steven F.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,1/2/2017,"To start we sat down and waited over 20 mins. to even see a waitress or waiter, not before I had to go to the hostest area and ask for someone. Completely unacceptable. Finally waitress came over to apologize and lied by saying this isn't her table but she will take care of us. Asked for waters with lemon took over 10 mins with no lemons, and it wasn't till after the entree came out she finally brought over lemons. we had dirty dishes on our table the entire time, to the point The service was horrible. Our apps and entree were delicious just to bad the horrible service. The Manger came over and apologized. We got the check and the manager took off and a entree and am app. Overall good restaurant it's to bad had a horrible service experience."
Carla D.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",22,26,2,4.0,11/28/2016,"Was very good to me, decided to go with a friend. We dined and had drinks at the bar. The service was great especially factoring in the time we went and the rush of diners at the bar. We did the 2 for 25 deal and mean we were filled. We could not finish it at all. It was an amazing deal and service that I would new back for."
Ab W.,"Hewlett, NY",1,131,,2.0,12/28/2016,"Warm welcome and accommodating service, but I didn't care for the young waiter calling me ""brother"" over and over.  Food seemed pretty good; lunch special pizza and bowl of chowder. But the chowder wasn't hot enough, and my stomach was iffy the rest of the day.  Won't repeat."
Yushanda H.,"Jamaica, NY",0,7,2,1.0,5/27/2017,"This was my first time to this location. I arrived at 11:00pm with my boyfriend on Saturday 5/27, according to google this location closes at 12am. We go inside and stand in front waiting for someone to greet us, a few workers walk by and say nothing. We stand there for about 3-4 min without anyone saying anything. Finally someone who had already clocked out for their shift felt bad that were standing there so long came greeted and seated us. He also apologized for so many people walking and saying nothing. We seat down and wait 30 mins throughout this time a few waiters walk by but say nothing eventually after we realized that no one is going to come help us we decided to leave. Before I left I spoke to the manager and let him know how horrible the service was, he just apologized and that was it. I didn't feel valued as a customer or that my business was wanted, therefore I will never return nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone else."
Jose A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,8,,1.0,4/24/2017,"Honestly this place is the worst place to eat in, I went with friends and family we had the worst time here. At first our server was good helping us but he wanted to remember six orders at once with drinks and appetizers. We all ordered the server kept coming back and back asking what we ordered. After that he came brought us the appetizers we waited over an hour for our food he said the forgot the steak which was mines so they was holding everyones food. We asked to speak to a manger he didn't help us one bit. He only took one order out of the bill I told him I didn't want the steak anymore he brought me the steak and told me to eat it I won't be charged. Then he rushed to the back to get everyone's food we waited 10 minutes for the check and what the manager had done was give us 25% off but still charge us for the steak until we went up and asked him and he didn't want to take it off until he we keep talking to him and he took it off. We spent for then an hour waiting for food while there was other customers waiting for food and they got their for free from the horrible service and we had to pay. This place is all over the place needs better management! Do not go here unless you like waiting for your food."
Melissa H.,"New York, NY",0,7,,4.0,12/20/2016,"I always have the salmon quinoa bowl.  I'm afraid to try anything new because I like this place and don't want to be disappointed. I promised myself I will try something new next time.  Spacious, clean, good look for green acres mall that needs to be renovated or demolished and rebuilt. Room for improvement would definitely be the drinks.  I love the fresh fruit in the drinks but its only really from the red family (ie strawberries. watermelon)  I would like to see some peaches, pineapples, etc. Great service. Has more of a clean eating feel then neighboring restaurants."
Alex H.,"Far Rockaway, NY",0,13,,5.0,12/15/2016,"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is absolutely upgrading the Sunrise Highway Green Acres Mall restaurant lineup.  The food and service here is absolutely great!  I had dinner with my wife and we had our infant (who himself took in the atmosphere).  Top notch environment, excellent brews, and very professional and respectful staff.  I have no complaints!"
Marie J.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,16,5,4.0,10/16/2016,"Went Here With My Boyfriend Today And Got Take Out. Customer Was Good , Everyone Was Friendly ! The Waiting Area Was Pretty Small. There Was Cushion Bench That Seated About 3 People Comfortably. My Boyfriend Ordered The New Orleans Jambalaya($18.25) And Ordered The Spicy Peanut Chicken With Soba Noodles($13.95). For Desert We Ordered The Monkey Bread Pizookie($7.50). The Wait For That Was About 15 Minutes. The Jambalaya Was Very Tasty , We Just Wished There Was More Shrimp And Rice. My Spicy Peanut Meal Was Ok And Could Have Used A Bit More Chicken. It Was Something New For Me But I Wasn't A Big Fan Of It. Overall My Takeout Experience. Good Customer Service And Good Food. I Didn't Get To Take Any Pictures Of The Food Bc We Were Starving And Tore That Food Up Lol."
London L.,"Hollis, NY",0,2,,1.0,12/9/2016,"Went there yesterday (Thursday 12/8/16) with a friend for lunch . She was reccomended To go there by a friend . The place is beautiful , staff is very nice , everything is great nice location . We ordered the appetizer sampler and then two rounds of the strawberry splash drink (tasted like a pina colada with strawberry purée). Our food came out quickly looked delicious we were excited to taste away . I had the cherry glazed salmon with asparagus and brown rice . The brown rice had no flavor ,asparagus was beyond tough , and the salmon was flavorless . All together our meal came up to 81 dollars I gladly tipped the waitress because she was very efficient , nice and overall helpful . I am beyond disappointed I expected so much more . NEVER going back"
Fiordaliza R.,"Queens, NY",8,4,,4.0,12/5/2016,"I went with my wife, parking was good, the bathrooms were clean and the food was amazing!!!"
Ashlee F.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2017,If you want your credit info stolen then I would highly recommend this place. Went to get a couple drinks and dinner the waitress was nowhere to be found the whole time we were eating. Paid with my card a day later i was charged with $500 worth of stuff that i had no clue about...coincidence?? I think not. Turns out the waitress copied down my card info and went on a shopping spree. Pathetic that a nice place like this has employees who do such disgusting things. I will never ever recommend this place nor come back. Pathetic
Kristen R.,"Port Jefferson Station, NY",0,20,,5.0,12/3/2016,"The food here was amazing! It came out to us very quick and we enjoyed every thing about it! The decor is so cute and the vibe is cool, I will definitely be back here again!"
Jacqueline D.,"Pine Mountain, GA",0,43,2,1.0,4/3/2017,"Honestly this is probably one of my worst restaurant experiences. This place has lots of potential but is awful from beginning to end. Though half the tables were empty we waited 20 Minutes to be seated, then 20 Minutes for our drink order. Then 2/3 got our drink order and we finally ordered. We waited 45 minutes for our meal and finally went to the bar to ask about the third persons drink which it turns out had been there the whole time and we now had a watered down margarita. The pizzas came. Wrong order. Sent it back apparently the waitress put in the right order but they did it wrong. One pizza came back correct but missing one ingredient which they eventually brought after we had almost finished the pizza (spinach in a bowl of butter) and asked about twice. The third person who didn't receive her drink til the food came out had to wait an additional 20 Minutes after our pizza came out for the Order to be redone and apparently they ran out of large pizzas so had to do a medium. We then waited over 20 minutes after finishing our meal for the check which was incorrect and we were way over charged. We showed the server and she went to correct it and then we received again another incorrect bill. That was then corrected. This is just the main stuff. We never received water refills except when we went to the bar to get them, we were never asked for another drink. And this doesn't begin on the food. The tavern pizza was good. The deep dish was a soggy buttery thick mess of bread with cheese and a few measly toppings. This may be put down as one of my worst restaurant experiences to date."
Rey W.,"White Plains, NY",2,121,,4.0,11/20/2016,Pretty cool for a new restaurant..went with my boys the other day..had the strawberry mojito which was good and the calamari which was good as well..the waiter was good the place is clean..I will be back
John P.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/9/2017,"First, the service is plain horrible and the staff move in slow motion.  My wife and I came here one Tuesday evening; we got seated, then flipped through the menu. After deciding what we'd like, we waited for about 10 minutes before we decided to ask for wait staff to order food.  The host and the bust boy kept telling us that the waitress will be with us shortly.  Now mind you, the restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of wait staff available.  But sadly, not a single one of them came by.  And we were never offered to start with any drinks.  So we decided to wait 5 more minutes to see if anybody comes.  Still, nobody.  So I told my wife, if nobody comes by in 10 seconds, we'll leave.  Since we're hungry, I count down slowly thinking perhaps someone would finally show up.  Oh well, nobody showed up.  Out we go.  Oh and one other thing, my wife is pregnant and the host and a waitress saw this.  Don't come to this BJ's, these people are inconsiderate, slow and unprofessional!"
Chianne J.,"Queens, NY",0,3,,5.0,11/14/2016,I love this place. The atmosphere is nice and their beers are awesome! I truly love their Root Beer Glaze wings!! I love their Pumpkin Ale with the shot of fireball.. The waiters and waitresses are very prompt and sweet.  Great spot overall.
