Courtney C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,This place is disgusting. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!  If I could give it no stars I would. I ordered a margarita and it took 30 minutes to come and when I got it the sugar rim was all over the glass and it was sticky. Meaning that my drink was sitting at the bar for quiet some time. Secondly I got my food and it tasted horrible. My steak was over cooked and the mashed potatoes were so thick I couldn't swallow my first bite. Don't even get me started on the service. A total waste of time. Hopefully this place gets shut down soon.
tanya c.,"New York, NY",76,39,3,4.0,2/22/2017,Came here on a Saturday when it recently opened. I got seated very fast. The food was pretty good. I had breaded chicken with mash potatoes. The portion was huge and it was delish. The beer menu is huge!! Lots to pick from. And fairly priced. The food menu has something for everyone. I really like the interior and the vibes it's a welcome new addition to the community and I plan to return
Audrey G.,"Oceanside, NY",49,2,,1.0,1/2/2017,"this bjs take out service is horrible.we ordered online for pick up at 7pm.we got there a few minutes late but the food not only wasnt ready  but it took them 1/2 hour to get it toegether and check us out.we got in the car and i tried a piece ofmy flat bread it was cold and so spicy i burned my mouth.I ordered margherite which is NOT supposed to be spicy.we went back in they said they would remake our whole order and it should only be a few minutes,well 45 minutes later here i sit in my car still waiting they didnt remake everything they forgot several things.I will never order from here again.50 dollars later and we expected to eat atound 7 it almost 9 and im still wondering when ill get to eat!"
Emily S.,"Lynbrook, NY",5,99,,4.0,3/15/2017,"I've been coming here ever since they opened a few months ago. The staff always are friendly and they do try to go out of their way but each time I have been here they either are understaffed(which leads to very slow service), run out of a menu item, or get an order wrong. They did make it up by removing a meal from our check and offered us free dessert. I do like this place because their salads and quinoa bowls are really good. You also must try their signature Pizookie and call it a ""diet starts tomorrow"" treat. Overall, if you are not in any rush, I would recommend trying this place."
Sarita S.,"Jamaica, NY",17,10,1,4.0,10/10/2016,"I love the food, I ordered Salmon and it was moist and delicious. I love the decor of the place, very elegant. The staff was friendly and made sure that we were pleased with our meals."
Michelle C.,"Queens, NY",0,3,,1.0,2/4/2017,"I ordered a salad and appetizer online and came in about 8 minutes to pick it up my food. First I have to say I had to wait for about ten minutes to even get knowledged by the kids playing behind the counter. The saddest part was the manger was there and he was too busy watching the game to tell the kids to stop playing and help me. I was the only person on line might I add, so finally when the kid decides to do his job and help me and look up my order he tells me he doesn't see it the after 5 minutes he locates it in the system. My salad was ready and waiting for me but my appetizer was not ready. So I had to wait for ten minutes smh. While I was waiting I was watching the staff playing and saw a waitress walk up to the counter and put her dirty feet on the counter as if it was a ballet stretch bar. I can even make this stuff up smh. I had just put my hands on the bar now you put your feet on it? Wtf! So unsanitary no common sense you put customer's food on that counter. Then my appetizer comes out and I am ready to go, my food should have been ready and waiting for me. When my husband and I drive away I noticed that there wasn't any dressing on my salad or in the bag and we where about a mile away had to come. When I came in again I had to wait another 5 minutes for the kids to stop playing behind the counter and they noticed me again but didn't acknowledge until they where ready smh. I told the same kid there was no dressing on my salad and he going in the back to get it and I see the staff playing again this time a guy walks up to a girl with money in her hand and pushes her she drops the money and they are all laughing they are not running a business they are running a day care center and play ground not a restaurant! Never again will I spend my money in there again, so disappointing because the food is good but the service is absolutely terrible!"
Edna B.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,4,,1.0,3/26/2017,"The service at this place has gotten so so bad, someone needs to from a higher management position come to do something from management ,to the waiters, this last and final time i waited 20 minutes and not one person came to introduce themselves out at least to say hello,  what is going on I'm a local resident from valley steam that went there regularly now this is beyond ridiculous this isn't the first time this has happen i don't recommend this location till they get good accommodating players to at least meet BASIC restaurateur expectations."
Gessica M.,"Queens, NY",0,6,,2.0,3/25/2017,It's one of the new restaurants in Green Acres Common. We decided to give it a try. The restaurant is nice but the service needs plenty of work. Our waitress was in a hurry; she would put the items on the table and run off. She did not know the menu. We ordered the Jambalaya. You could tell it was microwaved. It was lukewarm by the time it got to the table. The vegetables in the dish were very soggy. Too much jambalaya seasoning was sprinkled on the plate; gave the dish a powdery taste. The reviews listed here are pretty much accurate. The staff needs training. I will give it another try but it looks like this is another fast food restaurant chain. When are we going to get quality food at these restaurants that charge higher prices than the local take-out where you can get fresh food. Please train your staff.
D D.,"Jamaica, NY",0,8,,5.0,2/20/2017,Great food we had the appetizer sampler avocado rolls mozz sticks root beer wings spinach dip. Also the baked ziti and pizookies. Also peach teas to drink.  Overall our experience was good because of our waiter. We will be back.
Davie T.,"Manhattan, NY",35,3,1,2.0,1/8/2017,Service is horrible. We were seated and waited 45 minutes before a waitress came to greet us and give us utensils.
Jennifer M.,"Miami, FL",84,16,2,1.0,2/23/2017,"I will probably never come back here ever the service sucks and the food is skimp. When they first opened they had good food and good service after a few months this place is trash. I don't know why I ever thought green acres or whatever ""green acres common"" would be a nice place it's really a hood booger establishment."
Joshua C.,"Flushing, NY",13,1,2,1.0,10/28/2016,Being in the service industry myself I feel as if I'm very forgiving but the service here at BJ's made my first visit very disappointing!  The bartender was not hospitable what so ever in fact  it seemed as if I was bothering Tyquana by just trying to order! There wasn't anyone in the restaurant she wasn't busy which is what confused me even more. Being that it was my first time at Bj's I knew nothing of the menu or what they had offer so it was even more disappointing that she couldn't tell me about a beer or cocktail or even a menu item!  Apparently this restaurant makes their own beer which I was very interested in what they had to offer and when I proceeded to ask about them Tyquana just pointed at the taps and said that's what we have! It was at this point I just decided to stick to water! So if you like beer you might want to stick to croxley's  ale house where they actually can tell you what they are offering!
Gene G.,"Hempstead, NY",1,11,3,2.0,12/11/2016,"My girlfriend and I always like to try new places to eat because we get tired of eating the same thing over and over. So on a Sunday after work we were looking for a nice place to grab a quick dinner and came across this place and decided to try it, it was her idea for the record. We entered the restaurant and we were greeted and immediately seated we took a while to place our order because we both didn't really see anything on the menu that caught our attention. We finally decided to go with the spinach dip and Caesar salad as our appetizer and for dinner we both got a burger, she got the turkey instead of the beef. the first thing that came out was the Caesar salad which was good but it just didn't have enough dressing and we had to ask for more. Then came the spinach dip which we didn't really like because we felt like it didn't have enough cheese. Last but not least the burgers came and both of them lacked flavor, the best thing about my burgers was the fries and mashed potatoes that we got with them. To make things even worse than what they already were our server did not show us the proper attention, she failed to check on us to see how we were doing, we both went a long period of time with nothing to drink because she failed to check on us and see that we needed refills. Overall this was just a bad experience and I highly doubt we will be going back."
Fabian M.,"Rosedale, NY",66,1,,2.0,10/21/2016,"This place is nice, staff seems really friendly as well...this is a new restaurant so idk if they're still working out how to organize things...because I've been sitting here for about 1hour waiting for my food and drinks and nothing!...they have been bringing our orders to the wrong tables all night...I'm hungry and really annoyed I honestly feel like walking out and going somewhere else."
Karima R.,"Rosedale, NY",0,2,,5.0,10/9/2016,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with family for a birthday lunch for my 9 yr old son. The food was so good! We had the chicken and shrimp jambalaya dish, hot wings, pizza and the pizookie. The restaurant is big, nicely designed and the staff is very friendly. It's nice to have a restaurant like this in the neighborhood. I'll definitely be going back. Tip: download the BJ's restaurant app for a free pizookie (large cookie in a small pizza dish with ice cream)."
Stefan J.,"Rosedale, NY",152,3,,3.0,1/4/2017,"Ive gave this place so many chances. Ive ordered  dine in take out and at the bar. The bar was the best experience. Ive ordered a burger 3 times from this place. All 3 times i asked for it to be cooked medium. All the times the outsode was burnt char black. The 2 times i ordered take out my fries were cold and un-enjoyable. Staff and customer service at the bar and front are good, but take out counter can only be described as horrific. Expect to wait 15 minutes at least for them to acknowledge you while they scramble to find the peices of someone elses order only to realize that either the order is wrong or park of the order isnt ready yet. Then when you receive the meager portions of your sides (compared to bar or dine in) the other portion is cold. I ordered chips and guacamole once. They give you a big black container of chips  and literally less then half a cup of guacamole thats so chunky that the flimsy chips cant handle it. Spoke to a female manager and she was nice and gave me a credit.. but for the best customer service .. i would say eat at the bar so you can tell them how they messed up instead of taking  food home and not feeling satisfied. 3 stars.. i wanted to give 2.. but the bar staff was super nice and the place is very clean."
Lynn B.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",0,13,,2.0,11/26/2016,"Figured I'd try this new restaurant on a Tuesday night. The waitress was awesome (considering her horrible Kitchen and bar colleagues. Our drinks we waited half an hour. Our combo appetizers we waited 45 minutes. The only think that was hot in the plate was the avocado rolls. The mozzarella sticks, spinach dip, and wings were cold. My original mojito was horrible. I had to return it. And I don't like returning stuff. It was the worst mojito ever. I asked the waiter for a popular drink that everyone likes and she suggested a better drink that I liked. The table behind me complained. Rightfully so. The manager was calm And tried to appease the patrons who like us was coming here for the first time. The food was cold. Both our plates. And now I have no idea what my boyfriend got up to tell the hostess. I'm scared. This is terrible service. Are they short staff and there was a holiday rush right before Thanksgiving. I don't think we'll be coming again. I always wish every business the best. I hope you get your act together. Good luck."
Charlene D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,,1.0,12/13/2016,The service was TERRIBLE! The food was ridiculously salty and cold. I ordered the jambalaya and was so disappointed! I couldn't taste anything but salt and it was spicy as hell. I told my waitress about the problem and she asked if I'd like to order something else. I said yes and she gave me the menu to browse again. I ended up settling on the shrimp tacos and literally could only stomach one bite!! Again the food was salty! And the slaw was lukewarm. I will definitely never step foot in that place again.
Dequan S.,"Town of Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY",16,5,4,1.0,10/12/2016,"On the day of 10/12/16 I ate here at Bj's Restaurant in the new Green Acres Commons. As you walk in the atmosphere is pretty decent, but its way smaller inside then how it looks from the outside. The wait to get a table was about 3 minutes which that was perfect timing because I was hungry. The Hostess seated us at our table and the seats was dirty. It was French Fries on the seats and she was going to get it and i picked it up and handed to her. (The Bust boy needs to do a thorough checking of the table and seats). A couple of minutes later Damali came over to introduce herself as our waitress, very sweet young lady and might I add she is very knowledgable about everything that was being served at the restaurant. We ordered different types of sample beers so we can try, but when I looked and seen Damali put the order in, the bartender took a very long time just to get the samples ready. He was to busy talking and not concentrated on the task at hand. Damali seen that we was getting a little ansi and came over to distract us and have a little side conversation. Which it worked and I commend her for that because she's concerned about the customers well being. We finally get the samples and picked what we wanted. She went and put the order in and we had to yet again wait along time and not to mention this is what they specialize in (Crafted Beers). Our food comes before the beer gets to the table. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and my friend order the Chicken Alfredo. My salad was very good but his Chicken Alfredo was dry, meaning they was VERY stingy with the Alfredo sauce and some of the pieces of chicken was hard. All in all I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant because I feel the service was a 4 out of 10 and i'm only being nice because of Damali and her customer service. The bartenders LACK the sense of urgency, not to mention the place was not even packed."
Dan C.,"Dunellen, NJ",0,3,,2.0,12/8/2016,"Ok, well I'm not really in to the whole yelp thing as far as leaving comments anyway. But I'm a truck driver and once in a while I'll stop to try something new. Now first off if you only have 30 minutes for lunch, forget it! And if u think your going to save time by pre-ordering on line, well that's the mistake I made. Since I didn't have a lot of time, I figured I'll do a burger and fries. I ordered it well done and also ordered their large cut fries. They said it would be ready at 12:15. I got there at 12:14. Sat at the bar and waited for at least 10 minutes before I was even acknowledged. Then the bartender who seemed overwhelmed with minimal amounts of customers took another 10 minutes to ask me if I would like a drink. Then, I kid you not! I watched him do other things before another 10 minutes or so went by and I finally got my soda. Another 10 minutes go by and I finally get my food. And it's wrong! They gave me skinny fries, ( MC Donald's are better! ) And the burger was cooked  medium! What was I to do? Almost no time left for lunch now! I ate what I could and left the rest. No one ever came back to ask me if everything came out alright. The flavor of the burger was good. That's the only reason I even gave this place 2 stars. But let's be real. If they can't get a burger and staff right, what makes them think a customer would return for anything else. Good like if your going to try this place."
