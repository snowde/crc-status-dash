Ces L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",22,54,161,4.0,7/9/2017,"Gathering from the mixed reviews I guess the saying ""to each their own"" comes to my mind. The boyfriend and me have been here a few times and of all those times we've never had a problem at all. I don't know if it's because we've just been lucky or we always come at the right time.  Regardless we have not had any problems with the staff and if we did have to wait it was because there was a good crowd, which is a reasonable excuse in our books. Whatever the case the ambiance here is perfect for those who love beer and watching sports. If it's not so busy the staff are even nice enough to change the channel to the team of your preference. The food hasn't disappointed us yet, for each time we've visited we pretty much tried something different. I've tried both the Portobello Swiss Burger and the Bacon Guacamole Deluxe Burger. Let's just say the burgers are very generous in portion so come hungry and skip the appetizer. I always order medium well and both times have come out perfect. I've also tried the tacos (shrimp and fried mahi mahi ), which were also bomb! For appetizers we've tried the Avocado Rolls, which were also good and perfect for sharing if you have a group of 4. Our favorite that we always get though are the Rootbeer Glaze Chicken Wings!! :P Definitely a must for every visit we make here. Lastly you can't go wrong here when it comes to the drinks. (Skip the hibiscus iced tea though.) The Berry Burst Cider is my absolute favorite especially because I'm a sucker for the fruity beers. If you're not into that there's definitely a huge selection to choose from that will sure to fulfill your alcoholic taste buds! :)"
Elizabeth V.,"Southeast Yonkers, Yonkers, NY",62,1,1,4.0,5/3/2017,Food is very good.... Drink was on the money!  Our waiter Brian W. was on point!!  Will come back!
Guitelle S.,"Flushing, NY",107,109,230,3.0,12/24/2016,"I cannot speak for the service since I ordered takeout but I can talk about the food. The food here is pretty average.  I ordered the the crispy jalapeño burger and it wasn't bad. It had good flavor but I didn't like the the meat patty was burnt so that turned me off. The fries are really good, I liked that they were thin but the dry rub that they used on them was yummy.  The cookie and cream pizookie was delicious. The cookie was warm and soft and the ice cream of course was a nice addition. I think I will go back for that. Maybe the food will taste better if I was to dine in."
Tia G.,"Stamford, CT",60,28,4,3.0,7/15/2017,"The chicken tortilla soup was very salty. The temp was just right and it hap a little spice. I chose to get the sourdough bread, which was very good, it was seasoned well sand baked nicely."
Meka S.,"Rosedale, NY",69,166,373,3.0,4/26/2017,"We came on a Sunday night , there was about a 5 minute wait for a table  for 7 ppl . Our waitress was good , she was friendly and attended to us often . Everyone enjoyed their food but my only issue is the amount time it took for us to get our appetizer and entrees. The wait for food is long which sucks . I also do have one more  critique on the New Orleans jambalaya dish , there is not enough rice or meat , the entire dish is over taken by just veggies , would not order again."
Alex J.,"Queens Village, NY",45,4,,1.0,10/25/2017,"Horrible service, the waitresses take 2 years to come back to you, and the food is mediocre at best ."
Nelson A.,"New York, NY",16,6,3,5.0,10/23/2017,Like this place.  I went yesterday and the service was perfect. For sure I will come back soon
Angelo B.,"Valley Stream, NY",58,125,166,5.0,10/21/2016,"What a great addition to the area. We were seated promptly, and everyone was so friendly.(hopefully this lasts, and it's not just because they just opened) Our server was Bryan and he was very knowledgeable about the beers (do they have to take a beer class prior to working here?)  Told him what I liked and he gave some recommendations, ended up trying the 5oz sampler (4 beers 5oz each)  it was a great idea because we got to sample a bunch of different beers that they have to offer.  The harvest hefeweizen was my favorite of the bunch. It was pretty light and had a good taste. Next favorite was the Jeremiah red, 7.3% alcohol! Good thing I got a sample.  That also was very good but a bit heavy for my taste. The oasis was ok, the only one I wasn't crazy about was the nutty brewnette. It was too heavy for me, plus I still had to get through dinner Note: I don't drink often anymore, so take that into account. Appetizers:  Mozzarella sticks, not bad...the selling point for me was the garlic butter breading. Definitely had a unique (in a good way) taste, the only problem was that the mozzarella was a bit disappointing...maybe a better quality cheese would help put it over the top. Side salad (house salad?)  Disappointing...basically just chopped lettuce with a couple slices of tomato. We can do better than that (the full entree salads looked amazing from the menu though!) on to the entrees! I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. DAMN...that was a good burger, cooked perfectly and the brisket was delicious.  I though maybe between the burger, the brisket, the bacon and the bbq sauce...maybe it would be a bit too much. But they all got along fine, and I really enjoyed it.  Fries were great too!  Thin and crispy. Wife had the salmon quinoa bowl, and was really surprised by how good it was. Kids menu...a bit underwhelming considering the great options for adults. Chicken tenders, burger,corn dogs, kraft mac&cheese... KRAFT MAC&CHEESE? Are we at applebees? C'mon...based on the quality of the food we had...I see no reason why bj's cant make a quality mac& cheese from scratch.  Plus, lets add some more options... Grilled chicken? Fish? Glad to see they have vegetables and fruit as an option so that's a plus. All in all it was an excellent experience,  the atmosphere was great and the servers were very friendly. Our server was especially friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. Will definitely come again to try something else. And to try to make it to dessert, I hear the pizzookie is amazing."
Tony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",103,143,92,5.0,10/27/2016,"Brand new spot in the Green Acre Mall, decided to give it a try. Staff was pretty friendly, wait was reasonable. Since this was a new place, I went with a simple healthy salad while my family went with the deep dish pizza and a burger.  All of the food was pretty good. The pizza was thick and generously topped with Hawaiian toppings! Pizza was very filling and fresh!  The burger was really good, not very healthy but that translate into delicious pretty much. Fries were very good, usually the separating factor between burgers from other places in comparison.  My salad was the least fun, tasty but very boring and the kale taste overpowered the salad which will probably prevent me from doing it again, doesn't mean it wasn't good, just too kale-y for me.  Overall, staff was great and the bathroom (my pet peeve) was modern and clean. I will be bringing my family ba"
BigBob B.,"Garden City, NY",0,66,1,3.0,7/8/2017,"Update to my previous review, done shortly after opening.  I think that the service is generally good. But see below. The waitstaff is attentive, but not overbearing. I had the Jambalaya, which was surprisingly good. The portion was American and the taste was just right. My wife had a burger, which was terrible. It was dry and extremely greasy. The waitress probably should have checked on us once to see how the meals were, but that didn't happen. Given my two very different experiences, I'll probably give this place another shot, but then again, maybe not.  Two and a half stars would be more appropriate."
Paulie S.,"Jamaica, NY",1,12,9,4.0,10/12/2016,"Had such a great experience with my sister and our friends, our waiter Anthony took great care of us and was super attentive. This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. We were obsessed with the aesthetic of the bar and the intricate details of the decor.  My burger was soooo good, my whole party was satisfied with the service and meals we ordered."
Jacqueline G.,"New York, NY",58,132,156,4.0,4/20/2017,"I've eaten here 3x so far, must be a reason I keep coming back. The decor is nice, typical American sit down chain restaurant kind of feel. I love that almost all their tables are booth style. The menu is expansive. The alcoholic cocktails are good but a tad sweet and not much alcohol in them. I've had the baked ziti twice, who is a guilty pleasure. The shrimp with penne and asparagus is also good. I would recommend this place because let's be real there aren't that many good places to sit down and be served in this part of town! This is one of the best."
Gina T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,1,1.0,4/7/2017,The food is garbage the drinks sucks and the service is just as bad.  I have been here 3 Times before and the food is still bad. I have no idea where they got the Bar tender from. He needs to go back to school.  I will never come back again.
Mel R.,"Lynbrook, NY",79,120,27,5.0,10/17/2016,"I'm loving the ambiance here. It's a nice addition to the surrounding area. When I heard they were making this I thought it was part of BJ's Wholesale. Apparently the restaurant was BJ first. I came here for lunch and it was nice. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. We started with the avocado egg rolls which were delicious and reminded me of the ones from the Cheesecake Factory. The deep dish pizza was delicious and a must try. The kale salad and the salmon with quinoa was delicious as well. There is an extensive menu to choose from. You can get anything from burgers, to pasta and pizza. The have nice roomy booths. I would definitely return to try other dishes. They also have an app that you can pay with but you cannot do a split payment."
William B.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,9,35,1.0,3/10/2017,"I always wanted to try this restaurant out. So one day while I was nearby I decided to stop by. I walked in and nobody is at the front to seat me, so I walk over to the bar and sit down. Mind you there's so many workers I couldn't believe it. All of them clustered in the corner talking amongst themselves. Two bartenders are here, I'm sitting for a couple mins nobody greets me.. finally the girl comes over talking very loud to the other bartender about how she's about to end her shift and literally throws me a menu and doesn't say anything then runs away. Doesn't asks me if I need anything to drink, doesn't tell me about any specials for the day, or happy hour. At this point I should have walked out or talked to the manager, but surely it couldn't get any worse. Now I'm sitting there reading the menu and of course I'd love a water or a drink, the bartender walks past countless times and doesn't ask if I need a water or anything to drink.. I'm one of three people at the bar, so it's not like he's busy. Finally a miracle happened. He made eye contact and said ""Hey"" to me after I stared him down for a few minutes. So I knew this was probably going to be my only chance to order so I took the leap. I blurted out my order and as I'm doing so he's walking away.. I was only able to get my food order in since he walked away, now I had to wait till he's close by to get his attention for a drink. Now as I grab his attention for a drink I tell him I want a water and a beer, but what a surprise the guy walks away as I'm ordering that too. Finally the food arrives, food looks great. I wouldn't have anything to complain about if I loved my meals prepared under the Pacific Ocean. The food was overloaded with salt. Now in the middle of the meal I see a tap handle with a pear on it, it struck my interest since I've made ciders before and I've never saw that brand of cider before. By now I'm a pro at this so I grab the bartenders attention once again and ask if I could try the cider. He says sure, now all I want is a reasonable amount so I can taste the cider, he grabs me a glass and barely pours enough to cover the bottom of the glass. Doesn't even tell me the name of the company or asks if I want a glass of it.. He just walks away as if he's trained to do so. Finally after being done with my meal nobody came to take it away or ask if I'd like anything else. It's such a shame, the customer service and the quality of the food. This place is so nice on the inside, the music wasn't too loud, and they had so many great local beers. I would absolutely love it here if they service and food had an upgrade. This place at least needs to make some serious change to the staffing because the experience I had and what I saw was the worst I've ever seen. I will never be back to this location."
Michelle F.,"Queens, NY",2,45,16,1.0,3/6/2017,"There's no denying that the food at BJs is good. I've never been disappointed. However to service is unbelievably slow, it makes the experience painful.  20 min wait just to order, another 15 to get drinks. We order two apps and a large pie. Waited long again for appetizers and were told that our pizza was ready at the same time.  We said it's okay, bring it out. Our waitress then disappeared for another 20 mins just for a food runner to bring out a cold pizza.  Last time we were here I saw a customer refusing to pay, due to poor service as well. Not coming back. The management really needs to train their staff."
Jen B.,"Rosedale, Queens, NY",4,18,8,1.0,3/15/2017,"First & last time visiting this location, I think I'll stick to the one in Nanuet. For starters the service is beyond slow. Walked in & the restuarant was not full nor busy yet the hostess took a good 5 mins to figure out where to seat us. Then we sat down & it took another 20 mins before the waitress even introduced herself to us. Ordered a medium well steak that took another 30 mins to be ready & by time it was ready it was well done. Matter of fact I sat by the table and had to called the manager to find out why is the service so slow and it's not even busy in there. I had my heart set on a pizookie but refused to order it because that probably meant I would have to wait another 30mins  Bottom line this place needs to improve on the service and the attitudes of the waiters."
Sochy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,4,13,2.0,4/23/2017,"I have been at this location a few times already and even though the food is pretty good and I enjoy their selections, the service SUCKS!!! Prepare for very long waits during busy times and even when not busy there's no greetings when you walk in, and you get to sit at your table for a good 20-30 minutes before they even offer you water!!!!!"
David M.,"Merrick, NY",94,466,346,4.0,9/4/2017,"I wondered if another Brewhaus pub and grille chain restaurant could be successful on Long Island, with so much competition around.  BJ's seems to fit in well.  It's nicer then say a TGi Friday's or Applebee's,  but not quite as refined as say Houlihans.  It's similar to Millers ale house, however Bjs has much less televisions and a much larger menu with seemingly endless choices. It's one of the largest book menus I've seen.  By the way this place has no ties or relations to the wholesale club with a similar name.  Let's get down to the brass tax.  Service was very good, friendly and accommodating.  We ordered Grilled Mahi Fish tacos,  A Deep Dish signature pizza and a house salad.  Everything I just listed tasted very good, and fresh.  Wait times for the food were also reasonable considering the place was pretty full on our visit. We tried some mini churros with ice cream for dessert and they were delicious.  Clean bathroom as well.  They exceeded my expectations and was better then the mixed Yelp reviews made it out to be. We'd return."
Jehan L.,"Rosedale, NY",13,14,48,2.0,3/18/2017,"Over priced and not that great. I ordered a quinoa bowl that contained vegetables, quinoa and rice with a choice of meat (I got salmon), and the salmon was VERY small, and overall was very dry. The only thing I liked was the mash potatoes I got on the side, which wasn't included in the entree. The waitress was kind and nice but could've been better. We were there for at least 2 hrs, waiting for our food and the bill. Rather have gone somewhere else to buy better food for a cheaper price."
