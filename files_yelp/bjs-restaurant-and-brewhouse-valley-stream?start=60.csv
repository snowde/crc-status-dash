Sam L.,"Rosedale, NY",9,9,7,5.0,10/1/2016,"This place has the best staff of any restaurant I've ever been to by a WIDE margin. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya and my girlfriend had the vegetable penne pasta. Both were fantastic and the portion size is perfect for the price. Also, the alcohol selection is phenomenal, especially if you're a big fan of beer.  Our server was extremely cool and very knowledgeable on the selection of both food and drinks. Plus, she actually checked up on us as often as necessary and make sure everything is okay. (I wish I knew her name so I could mention her here!) All in all, we're extremely glad we came here for lunch and we'll definitely come back (especially since it's so close to home). Keep up the fantastic work!"
Kitanya R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,21,5.0,3/30/2017,"Very nice restaurant in LI that brings a great menu. I love BJ restaurant because the service is up to standards and the food quality is excellent for the value you pay. I love their Ribs, salads, salmon and let's talk about that rich mash potatoes. Their signature dessert is great as well as their cocktails. I will be returning soon."
Michael W.,"Syracuse, NY",0,15,4,1.0,3/10/2017,Came back to give it a second try but it's even worse than before the steak taste like it was boiled had to ask for utensils the waitress did not check back with us once I'm sure I won't be back
Michelle J.,"Washington, DC",10,199,142,4.0,10/6/2016,"First, our server, Nicolette, was awesome! She was patient with my family's questions and was super helpful when it came to us making selections. I really enjoyed my ago tuna salad. My sister said she enjoyed her wings and was excited to return. My mom said her ribs were too salty. She did say she would come back and try it again. My sister loved her dessert cookie and ice cream. I used to visit bjs in Florida so I am excited to see it in NYC. I hope it keeps the goodness I know and that they work on the ribs."
Nuta A.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,18,88,1.0,3/19/2017,"Very nice looking bar and great bartenders, however Guinness is poured so cold that it tastes like a lemon juice - it is undrinkable!!! What a shame to destroy such a great beer!!!! We tried it on 3 different occasions since the place opened and it is just horrible!!!! Guinness reps should not allow this place to carry their product!!! Shame!!!"
Lavaughn A.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",0,9,1,5.0,9/24/2017,I got a Chicken Sandwich when I was there 3 days and I gotta say that Chicken Sandwich tasteed excellent. Ima try the Nashville Chicken sandwich next this restaurant is a must for people who want that real casual restaurant experience.
Jodi G.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",24,60,70,5.0,2/7/2017,"I've bookmarked this place for a while. Finally made it & I can sat that I'm pretty impressed. I love the settings, wide screen TVs of each angle. There menu is very huge. Lots of choices...be prepared to spend at least 10mins looking thru ur menu. I had the jalapeño cucumber margarita which was very good. I had 2 actually...lol. I also recommend trying the super salad with choice of shrimp..chicken etc. I give this place 5 stars because knowing how far green acres have come this new commons area is a very great investment / improvement. Def gonna go back."
Ideniz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,21,50,5.0,9/29/2016,"For our first time at the Brewery, it was the second night of the opening. The decor was different and nice! The staff was welcoming and very attentive and pleasant. The beer variety is insane...so we will definitely have to attend many Happy Hours..lol  The food was also good. We had a very nice time!"
Nora D.,"Arverne, Queens, NY",2,46,21,3.0,10/23/2016,The food was decent service well you can tell they were just opening. I will definitely give them another shot when they have been open for a bit .. they do have my favorite beer and since I don't like beer that was great !  Had the Dr Pepper wings they were not anything crazy or again maybe it's cause they just opened and have not hit their stride yet ...
Ivory H.,"Norwood, Bronx, NY",58,11,24,5.0,8/31/2017,Shrimp Penne was delicious. Service was good. First time going will definitely be returning.
Chrissie D.,"Queens, NY",719,190,200,4.0,1/3/2017,So I finally got to try this place out. The aroma of the food invited us in and we figured we'd have dinner here. The food is really good! The atmosphere is poppin. I enjoyed my stay here. I can't wait to come back.
Andre C.,"JAMAICA, NY",7,18,13,1.0,1/20/2017,"I love eating and this was supposed to be a fun night out! So I get there and the place looks great, we sat at the bar for the wait, drinks were fast and bartender attentive and correct! We were seated and it all went down hill! First our spinach dip came out frozen in the center, waiter seemed completely uninterested. Then my burger medium rare comes out icy cold in the middle. Completely turned off! Waitress didn't want to remove burger from bill eventually manager did. No real ""making it right"" here. I left disappointed date night ruined."
Mieka A.,"Springfield Gardens, NY",0,9,14,4.0,4/26/2017,Food was pretty good. Their calamari was better than expected. Drinks were strong and with the money. Out waitress Nakea was very pleasant. Although she had several tables she made sure to check on us and ensure everything was going well. Pasta was as good as can be expected from a chain restaurant. Make sure to sign up for their points program for fewer desserts and money off ur check.
Matt M.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",12,7,1,1.0,1/12/2017,"I've been to BJ's down in Cary, NC and the service and food was great. Me and my girlfriend were really excited to see a BJ's open up close to us so we finally went to have a good time. Complete night and day compared to the one in Cary. Food and service here was awful. Didn't get our drinks till 20 minutes after being seated and didn't get 1/2 of our appetizers until 30+ minutes later. Appetizers came out cold. Looked like someone made zero attempt to heat them up.  The main course finally came and my girlfriends burger was burnt to a crisp when she ordered a medium rare. Still didn't get the replacement mozzarella sticks we ordered or the other half of my appetizer (boneless wings). Wings finally came which were fine and mozzarella sticks came as well, but with NO sauce. The server apologized. I sat there eating my food while my girlfriend sat there hungry and furious. I'd say only go here for the bar. If your looking for food, go somewhere else."
Jay A.,"JAMAICA, NY",6,5,2,1.0,10/22/2017,"I thought I'd try and give this place a chance. A friend and I went there on 10/14/17 during dinner time. We were seated fairly quickly, FYI the menu is a novel. Do yourself a favor and check the menu online before you go to save time. We ordered for drinks the 5oz. Beer sampler, unsweetened iced tea and a glass of water. For an appetizer we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. Here's the beginning of a interesting time. For the entree I ordered the Barbecue chicken deep dish pan pizza with mushrooms added on. My friend originally ordered the pork chop but was told, they were all out.(This should've of been the first sign considering it was only 8:30pm and you can only order the pork chop after 4pm.) So my friend ordered the Crusted Parmesan chicken, which comes with mash potatoes and steamed broccoli. Five minutes later a runner comes to the table with the spinach/artichoke dip w/nachos. This wouldn't have been an issue except, his hand is holding the plate touching the nachos. This is first major no no. He apologizes and corrects the issue. Literally 5 minutes later another runner comes to the table with our entrees. He seems annoyed that our table doesn't have a pizza stand. He asked me where is it, I let him know that I have no idea, there wasn't one at my table to begin with, and my waitress Claudia didn't bring one when i ordered. Now I've been to restaurants in many places, but I've never received my appetizer and entree, before I received my beverages. Also all my food in under 10 minutes???? We know it's not made to order. The appetizer: now it's advertised as a dip it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like cream of spinach with sour cream.Claudia finally came with our drinks and a pizza stand, and apologized for the dip. The pizza was actually alright for being pre-made but not worth $20. My friend said the chicken tasted and looked like it had been under the heat lamp long before we arrived. The broccoli was raw, and for some odd reason the lemon wedge we asked for in the water was in the mashed potatoes. The only good thing about this place is actually the beer and drinks. The Deal breaker was when we asked for the check. Claudia took another 20 minutes to bring it only after we put our jackets on. I paid with my debit card and she only came with the restaurant copy. I had to ask for my copy. Now I've been to restaurants around the world and have NEVER had to ask for my copy of the receipt, especially when we spent almost $100. The staff here is under trained no one knows the menu,  managers are non existent, And you have to beware your card isn't scammed. In Green Acres Mall with so many options I don't see this place lasting too long with service so bad."
Alla D.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,8,2,5.0,5/18/2017,I've been to the restaurant with my fiancé and sister twice in one week. The staff is great and the food is amazing. Truly no complaints. My favorite go to place.
Darnise P.,"JAMAICA, NY",24,41,17,3.0,1/18/2017,"Had the jambalaya minus the sausage and the meal was flavorful, hot and delish!  A dish I will probably have again.  While I'm not a big beer drinker, they have TONS to choose from. And the bar is well stocked BUT the didn't have and/or couldn't make rum punch - which IDK how with all that liquor but whatever!   Staff was courteous but could use more training in customer service and being knowledgable about the options and specials. Word of advice -- the floor going down that ramp was VERY slippery, you might want to change that before a slip and fall occurs."
Janat K.,"East Elmhurst, NY",0,2,,3.0,9/12/2017,"I'm a regular here(1-2 times a week). I love the flexibility this food chain has with their food. For example, I always come here for lunch. Sometimes I'll order the buffalo chicken sandwich which comes with French fries. Instead of the French fries they'll let you substitute for any other side, such as the fresh mozzarella salad, Brussel sprouts..etc..one thing I typically ALWAYS have a problem with is the servers up charging me...for instance during the Lunch menu (12-3) you may add a soup to your entree for 1.75$..I don't know why/how the servers don't know this and always charge me full price...It's just hustle bustle: explaining it to them, while they'll still deny that offer exists until a manger finally comes out and tells them. (Blood pressure rising experience) also wanted to note out that management needs to do a better job managing their employees. Couple of days ago, my server, while on her shift and taking my order, had her headphones plugged in her phone and was having a conversation..I've seen this numerous times, and it just isn't professional. On the contrary side, today I had a pleaser experience with one of the newer managers, Brea? She was great and bjs needs more mangers/employees like her!"
Tricia M.,"Valley Stream, NY",4,6,,2.0,8/24/2017,"We live in the area and decided to try the food. It was a nice restaurant and we were seated quickly. Once we were seated, we waited for 30-40 minutes without service. Eventually someone from my party got up and walked to the front to ask for a waitress.  A waitress came up to us and said it wasn't her table but she would get someone. A little while later another waitress came over and she was upset, she said she was about to go home and they told her to take our order. While we were trying to give her our order, she kept interrupting us to complain to two other girls that work there that she was suppose to go home. The original waitress than comes back and tells her its ok she will take the table after all.  All of this conversation shouldn't be taking place in front of the customer. We waited a long time for the food, no one cleared the appetizer plates, so there was just a cluster of plates on our table. We waited a long time to receive the bill and then had to wait to pay the bill. The place wasn't even busy. The food was just o.k. We will not be returning."
Shavonda J.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",27,17,41,4.0,5/23/2017,The waitress was very nice and staff were very attentive. A cool and chill spot after work.
