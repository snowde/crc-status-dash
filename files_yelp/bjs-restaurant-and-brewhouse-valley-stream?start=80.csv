Gregory W.,"Valley Stream, NY",116,45,,1.0,9/1/2017,"I'd rather give it ZERO stars. I would never eat here. I went in to get a take-out menu. I was greeted by a rude, obnoxious employee with an attitude who informed me that they were all out of them and then walked away. Was I offered an opportunity to look at the menus they did have? NOPE. Here's a tip. Management here needs to properly train their employees to be welcoming. When the first person customer sees is rude and obnoxious...it's over. Or maybe the management has no idea how to properly treat a customer. I won't be back.  I would like to mention that the manager did contact me to apologize and offered me a gift certificate. So that is a positive sign. Hoping the situation doesn't happen to anyone else."
Yamilet H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,2,5.0,3/8/2017,First time here and we will definitely be back!!!! Seriously this is the best restaurant in this area.  So many choices to choose from and affordable!
Nal S.,"New York, NY",0,23,46,1.0,7/26/2017,"This is probably one of the places I loved going to but after last night that's a no ever again for me. We had to wait very long for service. The pasta wasn't done well at all (it was hard and hardly any chicken). The waiter gave us so much attitude and was very rude (which I personally hate!). My Shirley temple was filled with syrup. The sweetness was so much I couldn't even drink it. This is the worse experience I've had here and to think I took tourists to this place last night and then having to experience this, I regret it. I will never go here again."
Marly T.,"Uniondale, NY",37,22,6,1.0,7/5/2017,Grabbed a burger here a few days ago with my little sister! Food tasted below average! McDonald's cheeseburger tasted 10x better than the burger I bought from here. It was greasy and service was slow. My sister got the spaghetti and meatballs which tasted as if someone boiled the spaghetti and threw tomato sauce over it to serve to us. If you're gonna do that than why charge $15 for it?They lack in customer service as well. It was also over priced. I would've been better off going to Applebee's for the same quality and better price. Hell even a diner has better food!
Mariegold M.,"Valley Stream, NY",8,71,10,5.0,11/9/2016,"It's nice to see new places pop up here and don't have to drive to RVC or garden city or queens. Quick review of what the table ordered. -Supreme pizza was great. Its ""deep dish"" style but not as heavy. It's nice an airy dough/crust.  -Jambalaya had prefect amount of flavor and spice. -Fries were stringy but good and crispy -The strawberry beignet was the bomb. Baked good and ice cream not too heavy or sweet. Presentation could have been prettier. -Chocolate chip pizzookie was gooey in the middle just the right amount of choco  I'll be going back especially because they have member perks if you sign up for the app. Saved $10 this meal."
Jun V.,"Valley Stream, NY",24,5,,1.0,11/5/2016,"My wife and I and our 2 year old were looking for a place to eat and found this new spot at the new Green Acres Commons. Looks great from the outside and even nicer inside. We were greeted warmly and took my name and was told to wait a few minutes. As we were waiting to be seated, a couple with their daughter walked in and was seated right away ahead of us with no reservations. So I asked why they were seated first but I was ignored and we were seated immediately anyway so I let it slide.  Then there were the silverware, it was wrapped in cloth napkins but when opened, the spoon, forks and knives were dirty. Not only one set but all 3 sets were dirty. We asked for replacements and two sets were dirty. This was really disappointing and makes you wonder what else is dirty in this place. We ordered the ""Best Beginnings"" appetizer which was great, I had to ask for plates which should have been automatic. My wife ordered a cocktail which was loaded with alcohol and was undrinkable. I had the ribs and it was good. My wife had the steak and wanted it medium well and it came out medium rare, so we had to send it back to cook it off some more. By the time it came back, we had lost our appetite and took home the entrees. Overall, we had a bad experience in this place and will not come back. We did not enjoy our $100 meal. This place has a really nice atmosphere and a huge bar with monitors everywhere you turn.The food was not bad and our service experience was below average.I would not recommend this to my friends and family. But if you do go to this place, check your utensils."
Lilly C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3,30,13,5.0,9/5/2017,The food is delicious and i love how they have so many options to cater everyone! Portions are great and the atmosphere is so lovely. however i did see a server take shots with her customers every time she'd go back to their table. Not sure if that's allowed but that's not professional. Would come back here for the great food(:
Andrea B.,"Ridgewood, NY",137,24,,4.0,10/24/2016,"Giving it four stars because it's a nice addition to the Green Acres Commons. Figured we'd give it a try--had never heard of it, but it definitely has that ""chain"" look at feel (because it is). Huge menu, if you can't find something you want you're not trying hard enough. Just a couple of highlights/lowlights on the food--the root beer glazed boneless wings were surprisingly good. I also enjoyed my baked ziti, it was basically a pizza-tasting ziti in a deep cast iron dish. Disappointed that the mac n cheese on the kids menu was mac-in-the-box, but  my daughter didn't mind. My only complaint, which is a fairly major one, was the service. I get it, they're new, but it's been a month and this isn't this chain's first rodeo. We were there for over two hours on Saturday--we showed up shortly after 5 and didn't leave until after 7. Everything was painfully slow--from the time our name was called to actually being seated, for someone to come by to take our drink order, for the drinks to arrive....it was brutal. Our server was very, very nice, didn't make any mistakes, but the restaurant has some major kinks to work out around timing and staff. Don't know how they'll end up making money if they can't turn over a table in less than two hours. I downloaded their app while we were there--I was able to pay with my phone, add the tip, and leave without having to wait for someone to come back to take the check. You get points per dollar and special offers via the app as well. We weren't drinking at dinner this time but would definitely love to go back and try some of their extensive selection of beer."
Maria T.,"Manhattan, NY",10,40,22,3.0,6/24/2017,"This is a warm and friendly place to relax with friends and family. Food is good and dependable and hearty, with many choices. Not a foodie's paradise, but a good, solid place to dine. They allow parties of 6 and under to call ahead, so you don't have to wait (just don't get there late...). We went early on a Saturday evening (around 5 pm), so it was easy to get in and find parking, but it was really slow-going when we wanted to leave... The situation will hopefully improve once the construction around the mall is complete."
Ashley S.,"Queens, NY",106,13,11,5.0,7/17/2017,I've been here many times but this time was really special. I broke my leg during gymnastics and was feeling low so after an appointment me and my mom decided to come here to lift my spirits. Shaday was an awesome server. She made me laugh and was very thoughtful and courteous and moved me to a large booth table so I could rest my leg. I will always choose BJ's!
Nathan M.,"Hicksville, NY",237,4,,2.0,2/11/2017,"Got the $20 appetizer platter with wings, mozzarella sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, and avocado egg rolls. Mozzarella sticks were tubes of fried breading that didn't even contain cheese. Spinach and artichoke dip wasn't bad but wasn't good, and also came burnt. Egg rolls were decent, a little spicy to give you a heads up. And the wings were the only redeeming factor - root beer glaze sauce was good. Chicken quality was equivalent to Applebee's.  Although the service was great and very friendly, I probably won't go back. I would hope their entrees would be better, though, so maybe give those a try if you're still interested!"
Jake S.,"New York, NY",9,64,28,4.0,6/16/2017,"Great selections, good food and excellent service! Our waiter was so welcoming and amazing"
Cibi A.,"West Hempstead, NY",115,79,161,2.0,12/12/2016,"The sriracha queso dip came out chunky with greasy chips and absolutely no kick! The fried chicken with mashed potatoes and corn was good, but a little salty! The triple decker was a hit! good meats, complimentary cheese, the fries and pickles may have been the stars though! It was a busy saturday afternoon around 130, but it was hard to get the attention of the right servers and difficult to get water refills. I don't think the food would bring us back"
David M.,"Jamaica, NY",2,3,,4.0,10/14/2016,"Based off of the experiences I had with restaurants around this area (namely, Bronx BBQ), I kept my expectations for this brewhouse bottom-of-the-barrel low. This was the right move... because I was all the more pleased when the place turned out to be pretty good.  When I first walked in, I noted that the dinihg space was much smaller than it appeared from the outside. This was fine though, as what was there was well lit and smartly decorated. The service, from hostess to waitress to busboy, was very helpful and cordial. There was this one server who gave us this educational speech on the hops in certain beers and how it would make the jalapenos on the Crispy Flatbread Nachos more bearable.  Speaking of the beers itself, I found their in-house brewed pumpkin ale to be a little on the watery side, but my girl liked it. I had the Nutty Brewnette and thought it was pretty good, but nothing too remarkable. The food took a little while to get there, but when it did we were fully satisfied. My burger was well-cooked, and my girl had no complaints about the chicken tacos. I give BJ Brewhouse a light 4, but considering the green acres area it may as well be a perfect 5. Strong recommendation for those who find themselves in this mall area and want something other than watered down Applebee's drinks and abysmal service at that horrible Olive Garden."
Lucinda O.,"Elmont, NY",4,57,106,4.0,7/8/2017,Had a good time tonight for my first visit.  Alwyn  the bartender was very attentive.  He made sure we were okay and satisfied at all times.  Nice atmosphere.  Lots of beers although we didn't have any tonight.  Turns out Alwyn is a vincy which is a plus!!
Donald A.,"Rochdale, Queens, NY",0,26,6,4.0,6/29/2017,Food was good service was good. The place was really clean. The sparkling water was the best. I will be back
Love 4 Food ..,"Brooklyn, NY",4,10,12,4.0,6/28/2017,Drinks are on point.  Bartender Alwyn the best.  Apps was good. The ribs are delicious.
Nneka C.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",1,4,22,1.0,11/11/2016,"My review is not for the food or service but for the manager Michel (sp.) I was there last night and this morning I saw an additional charge on my debit card. I called and asked to speak with a manager and when I informed him (Michel) of the additional charge, which is not mine, he said they were not responsible for it. Are you kidding me? I gave Gabrielle the server my card to pay for my purchase; not anyone else's. I stated to Michel that was not our charge and he repeated that they were not responsible. He did not even offer to look into the matter. Great customer service, Michel. You don't have to worry about me spending my money there again. Customers use your debit/credit card there at your own risk! I called my bank and they are investigating the matter."
Jonathan M.,"Forest Hills, NY",78,3,2,1.0,5/5/2017,"The service here was atrocious. The stars is for the beer selection. We received overcooked steak, soggy asparagus and oil/butter filled vegetables. Won't be coming back here again. Sorry not sorry."
Zahra S.,"Oceanside, NY",3,30,23,4.0,11/2/2016,"30 minute wait to get seated, 30 minute wait for our appetizers to come out. We got the appetizer platter and had no complaints about the food - we were satisfied. The mozzarella sticks were good and so were the avocado rolls.  The cookies with ice cream were delicious - best one was the classic chocolate chip. The inside of the restaurant was nicely designed. It was very crowded, which is what is expected on a Friday night and in Valley Stream (where a lot of people are coming in from Queens as well)."
