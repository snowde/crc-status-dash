Jacklyn S.,"Santa Monica, CA",33,155,232,4.0,12/20/2017,"Lost our reservation after we called to confirm it TWICE. Be sure to get a name when confirming. The service was great once seated (after waiting 45 minutes) The jambalaya was Served in a Big Bowl. It was delicious and spicy and very flavorful and the shrimp and sausage and cajun chicken were extremely juicy. I highly recommend it. The avocado rolls were really good made with some typw of chipotle sauce and  served with a sweet sauce, also recommended. Very fun and Loud environment. Great to go watch the game at the bar or for a fun night out with friends"
Cindii J.,"Glendale, CA",2,44,1,1.0,1/8/2018,"I am very big at supporting our local community, I like eating here and support high dessert however this BJ's location has really left me with a horrible impression on both customer service and quality food service.  I am usually dine out 3 times per week, I don't do drive thru food so I rely on these type of restaurants to feed my family of 5 (including myself). I spend about $500 a week and which. If I'm going to spend $100+ per visit I expect a good hot meal.  -First of all, as I pulled up to curb side to go, I called them and it took them 17 minutes to come out to my car, they brought receipt for me to sign and made me wait 12 more minutes for my food. We were helped by a gentleman named Elias,  -Second, By the time I got home, my food was cold! I looked like it had been sitting for a while, I only live 5-6 Minutes away, this doesn't happen when I order from outback, Olive Garden, chili's etc (all next to each other or across the street).  -And third, the FOOD WAS HORRIBLE, NOT GOOD at all. The spaghetti was very dry and not enough sauce to cover the bottom of spaghetti. The blackened salmon was NOT blackened - it was pretty dry and not flavored. The asparagus penne sauce was mediocre - maybe if it was warm it would be good but again we got COLD FOOD. Garlic Parmesan wings were completely dry, as if hey forgot the sauce, the clam chowder soup was so thick as if we got the last of the bottom of their pot looked like jello. Cesar salads were good, I guess besucase it was also cold.  Very disappointed, from this location."
John S.,"Waimea, HI",68,64,41,3.0,12/20/2017,Happy hour 3pm to 7pm good deals. Parking not good... like 5 spots by the restaurant.  Hahah but walking distance to many other spots..... unless its cold or hot some people might not like it. Food was great except OVER cook mac n cheese.  Must have microwaved it to death. Next time I will get a picture of it... was bad. But the lady behind the bar (Emily I think serves name was) was quick to change it for me. Thank you for excellent service. All the food was great pizza kind of doughy.  Wide choice of beer here. Even brew their own 3.5 want to give 4 star but to many errors in food. The ahi salad when I came here last time was better.  Maybe cause it's Wednesday they aren't as fresh.  But picky me hard to please still I will keep coming here and place always packed with people..... Kind of build a bill here quick so watch out.
Sandra L.,"Los Angeles, CA",702,261,710,4.0,11/5/2017,"Stopping by this place on our way to Vegas. I seriously didn't expect anything extraordinary... but, the BBQ burger blew me away. Savory, generous, first-class BBQ handling... not to mentioned that the buns were made in house.  It is fresh, soft, fluffy, golden brown, brushed with butter, makes you indulge every bite.  It's the of kind of treat that makes me want to wrote food porn, yet feeling so poor in description. Can't wait to make my way back here!"
Diane D.,"Victorville, CA",128,33,64,3.0,1/6/2018,Good ambiance and I like that they are open late. Food and drinks are mediocre but very rarely are chain restaraunts amazing. Service is ok but never great. Pizookie- priceless!! It's their amazing Grace! That is all.
Florence S.,"Hesperia, CA",434,386,725,4.0,7/21/2017,I don't know why I always end up here when I am looking for something to do with my kids. I guess it is because the pizza is good and the kids like the handcrafted soda.  I have a tip for any parent taking a kid. I have an 8 year old and 12 year old. They order the kids drinks for .95 cents and I get them a pizza to share. It's a way better deal. My 8 year old loves the pepperoni flatbread pizza. During happy hour it is only 8 dollars and huge.  The cool thing about this place is that they bring the kids fruit and bread when they are waiting for their food. Nobody wants a hungry kid.  During happy hour you can get a mini pizza for 5 to 6 dollars. That's half off and they are amazing.  They always have some special going on if you are a rewards member. Yesterday I had $10 off $35.
Richard G.,"Victorville, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/7/2018,"One year ago I gave this location 5 stars. Sad to say I am dropping them down to a 1 stars because of the last few visits have been a major let down. Tonight we found 5 out 11 of our knives had hard food on them, long hair in the horse radish, the server dropped a drink on one of us. The A1 sauce that they provided us with was empty. My daughter even sent back her food and didn't get the chance to eat with the family because she was really disgusted with the restaurant.  I hope this location can fix you issues. Our family really loves coming here but after this I dont believe we will come back."

Thom P.,"Kalamazoo, MI",25,41,50,5.0,8/28/2017,"Our in-laws took us out to eat for my wife's 69th birthday while visiting them in California.   The five of us were seated rather quickly (15 min maybe) and our server was attentive but not hovering. Our drink order arrived quickly. We were ready to order our entrees right away. It did take a bit longer than we expected but not extremely long. I had Peruvian rice with Chicken, my wife short ribs, my daughter in law Tuna salad, and son in law Fish and Chips. My granddaughter had Mac and cheese.  All of our meals were delicious well prepared and played. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. My dish the Peruvian Rice and chicken was especially delicious. Not your normal bland chicken and rice dish at all. The meat was perfectly cooked and moist through out. Everyone blended together perfectly and had a flavor unlike I've any restaurant dish I've had.  I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"
Jacob H.,"Fontana, CA",2,5,1,1.0,8/7/2017,"Ordered a pizza with pepperoni and olive but with no cheese, extra sauce. Check out the picture I posted. Pizza has no sauce. But the waitress tells me the ""those little drizzles are the sauce"" So apparently according to the manager ""John"" and our waitress ""Alexis"" this is a pizza with ""extra sauce"". It sucks that I'm lactose intolerant, but then they try to tell me this is extra sauce??  Finally Cassidy(senior manager) is helping us. Got our pizza made correctly and taking it home. Maybe we will try again in the future. Only because Cassidy showed us respect and understood wat is going on. She seems to have the best customer skills at the establishment!"
Bella T.,"Oceanside, CA",1,3,,3.0,1/4/2018,"Great service at a not very busy time! Our server was super nice.  It would've been a perfect visit to one of our favorite restaurants if it wasn't for the state of their bathroom.  Women's room. Second stall. Pee in the toilet for the entire duration of our almost 2 hours there, never once did an employee go in to clean it. I had almost 3 glasses of water so I got up to use the restroom twice and let me tell you I dreaded every moment of it. The smell was absolutely disgusting.  I expected better from you, BJ's."
K. T. M.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,21,2,5.0,12/27/2017,Hour later Alex H. was amazing really intuitive to our needs and very patient 5 stars for this kid plus thanks again man for making the experience great!
Patrick B.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,7,1,1.0,8/11/2017,"Arrived at around 5pm Thursday. Not busy at all. Seated quickly. Ordered beers. Mine arrived quickly as my fiancé chose between two tasters. She chose a Blue Moon ... We placed our food order Black and Blue burger with fries and a loaded  baked potato with chicken  Blue moon on the way we were told.  Simple Enough ... After about 15 minutes we asked a passing waitress about our missing drink. About 5 minutes later it arrived. My beer was finished. So much for having a drink with my gal. The food arrives a bit later. Around 25 minutes later and that is being kind. The loaded baked potato was luke warm at best. The burger was ok. The bun was was too big for the patty. The fries were soggy. I believe our order resided under a hot lamp for some time or maybe under a counter somewhere. Who knows. Normally I like the food and service provided by BJ's, but this experience left me with the following simple thought; Never Again"
Marcela F.,"Lomita, CA",1,9,,5.0,12/31/2017,"Came here for late lunch on Christmas Eve. Service was great, cocktails were pretty good. I ordered the 6oz sirloin steak and they made it just the way I like it. Waitress was friendly and professional."
Diana B.,"Victorville, CA",14,5,,2.0,12/31/2017,"I ordered my food using curbside pickup 12/31/17 at 1:15 pm. I arrived on time called in and Elijas said they were just finishing my order up and he would be right out. He comes out within 5 minutes with my order I pay and leave. I open my wedge salad looks wilted and they used the bottom of the head of lettuce including the core. I remove the core and imagine my surprise hardly anything left because the core was huge. Last time I checked people don't eat the core, maybe I am wrong. Next I open my parmesan crusted chicken and no lemon chardonnay butter sauce! OMG! so I check my daughters southern fried chicken meal and no gravy! I call them and get Elijas (who is very nice by the way) I tell him what happened and he talks to the manager and he tells me to come back and they will give me the sauces and a pizookie. I tell him I don't want a pizookie right now just my sauces, so he said he would give me a coupon to get a pizookie in the future. I arrive and he brings me a small container of both sauces and he told me he put two pizookie coupons in the bag. Bottomline fresh sauce on cold food is a bummer, the pizookie coupons expired in June 2017 and Elijas was a trooper for having to do all this stuff that wasn't even his fault probably."
Luu N.,"Hesperia, CA",43,6,5,5.0,10/28/2017,"Perfect food and perfect service for a perfect family eating weekend. Pretty much enjoy the atmosphere, very joyful and cozy! A great place for group of friends to hang out!"
Ramon P.,"San Bernardino, CA",98,52,29,3.0,10/23/2017,First time coming to this BJs since moving up here and it was alright. Wait time was minimal even though parking was impossible to find. Got seated at a table and asked if we can have a booth instead and they said no problem.  Ordered and food was good. Waiter really looked like she was trying. Took a long time to get refills. Waiter said she put them in but we wouldn't receive them. Minutes later they bring my wife hers and even though they had 3 more strawberry lemonades on the tray they only left one for my wife even after seeing there was obviously 2 empty cups at our table.  Pizookie was delicious. Better then the food actually.
Jay V.,"Victorville, CA",0,2,,3.0,1/8/2018,"Never fails, every time we visit it's an average 20-30 mins to be seated when they have 1/2 dozen to a dozen tables empty. Food and draft beers are great but the service is ok.  Visited VV BJ's three separate occasions and it's like the DMV out front."
Blue P.,"Riverside, CA",51,41,41,5.0,10/9/2017,I love coming here. The food and service is always great. They also have good deals on their lunch specials. I usually get soup and salads during the weekdays they are unlimited and has a variety of choices to choose from. The avocado egg rolls and deep fried calamari are delicious and good starters for your meal. The twisted BLT salad is a must try as well.
Chrystina B.,"West Covina, CA",34,55,100,5.0,5/20/2017,"Let me start with I HATE Victorville lol  I live in West Covina and I was in my way home, so I stopped for food.  I ordered prime rib with roasted Brussel sprouts/ mashed potatoes, A white-chocolate macadamia nut pazookie, also an appetizer of ""Root beer glazed""  & ""hot buffalo"" boneless wings, with a strawberry lemonade.  With the deals(Mother's Day special)  and coupons (free appetizer when you buy a meal over 10$),  I got my whole order for 29$! What a deal right?! The food was AMAZING! Mind you, it took me an hour to get it home and it all still tastes fresh and bomb as hell.  SIDE NOTE BJ PEOPLES******If you need to get a cheap Appetizer that comes with a lot, definitely get the 1lb of boneless wings for 10$. (You can even mix the flavors and it feeds everyone before your meal comes.)  I see a lot of reviews that basically says this BJ's location ain't shit, and MAYBE it might be true on the ""Dine-In"" part, but I did make an order on the to-go side because it was packed as hell and we wanted to get back to our side of the world (because you know, Victorville really is another world up there LOL)  However, I would definitely eat there because the food is great.  The service from ""Zachari M"" (very cool white boy! Yes, I can say white boy because I am half white LOL)  He was amazing! very patient, and so nice.  We had a few issues with my gift card, and he got the really awesome Mexican manager to fix it all up (You know us Mexicans have the answers / ability to fix anything) and it was an estimated 30 min wait but they got me in and out in less than 15 mins tops.  For the complainers that swear they're going to die because of waiting to get their food, my suggestion is order the boneless buffalo wings and calm down, lol. You'll be alright. You are not yourself when you're hungry.  As I was waiting in the to-go part of the restaurant, I really noticed it wasn't as bad as everyone says. The place is clean, has a great staff, and the food is worth the money. So, I will definitely be coming back to dine in."
Kimberley G.,"Pasadena, CA",29,23,9,3.0,10/16/2017,"My boyfriend & I came here Sunday for dinner the wait was 15-20 mins , that wasn't to bad.  We ordered wings for our appetizer half buffalo/bbq , they brought us the wrong order then our wings were cold. We told them 1x then they came again and brought us other order still was cold we just ate it didn't want to keep complaining.  We ordered our food it took forever to come & also we stayed with out drinks not because of the waiter just of how long it took for them to come by and bring your drink. The food was really good !  The only thing bad about my experience was that it's to bussy & not many waiters or waitresses. They try to Manage all the tables but they are set with to many .  Took about 15-20 mins for them to bring me my check & then after to bring back my change like 10 . Won't be here again because of the wait time for everything ... the 3 stars on the food except the wings I got for appetizers. 1st photo Buffalo wings wrong order and we're cold . 2nd photo cold wings right order. 3rd our meals were good at least they're not cold"
Michael S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,121,69,2.0,12/6/2017,"I came here with my wife on Halloween. It was the standard BJ's fare... however, it just seemed like the servings were skimpier than usual. Not sure... The service was pretty poor as well. The tableside visits were non-existent. We were sitting in the bar and we managed to only get a single round of drinks because nobody ever came by to see if we would like more. There was no 2 minute check back after the food dropped; there was actually never ANY check back. And we didn't actually get our check until we stopped another employee to get it for us. Highly doubt we will ever return to this location."
Vouch H.,"Hesperia, CA",34,27,125,5.0,10/6/2017,"Seriously amazing foods, drinks and services!! My waiter was so sweet. I don't know what to say to tell that we're so satisfied for our dinner tonight. We had dinner for 4 all of us ordered different kind of foods and we all love our foods. The price not bad at all the restaurant Super classy look. Seriously don't miss it ."
Scott A.,"Temecula, CA",1333,24,2581,2.0,3/9/2017,"Ok...let's start with I am not a big review guy. With that said I most certainly know that has kept my ass from Elite Status, I am good with that. Now to the review: The facility at 12:15 was one third full. Clean it was. Friendliness of staff...not so much. Food quality...none on this visit. Sat at the bar top to watch the Duke game. Zach too busy bullshitting with the server Staff to address the three people sitting there. You know something is wrong when the couple three seats down has to say...""excuse me, I don't want to interrupt you, but can I please get my check"" Being a BJ's consumer since they had two and patronizing the Newport Location watching them grow...this location needs to get their shit together."
Scott M.,"Victorville, CA",4,96,125,5.0,4/5/2017,"First time at this location in Victorville, the menu seemed rather limited and they discontinued the roast beef dinner that was so delicious. Not very many red meat items, but a full selection of personal pizzas. The selection of appetizers did not seem very exciting. I ordered the Jambalaya which was very good. Service was good, however meals seemed a little pricy compared to restaurants like Chilis. They did have a very good selection of beers on tap and in bottles. I am always impressed with restaurant management that read their reviews and attempt to make an enjoyable dining experience for their customers. Bravo to BJ's management and staff for doing just that! Came back a second time for a late lunch today for a deep dish pan pizza, Cobb salad and a burger. Started off with the avacado egg rolls as an appetizer which was very tasty. Service was attentive and top of the line!"
Linda G.,"North Hollywood, CA",47,20,,4.0,11/26/2017,Definitely a Friday Night Atmosphere..Decent Food..Happy People
Kristen F.,"Los Angeles, CA",577,5,6,4.0,8/25/2017,"We had great service! It was not that busy but it seemed as though communication between the employees and  guests could be improved. The establishment is fairly new and for the time we were their it was cleaned, including bathrooms. They have a vast menu; American food and brews. Items range from pizzas, hamburgers, salads, seafood, steak and fish plates. Also, the dessert is awesome! The infamous pizookie is here! (The pan cookie with ice cream.)"
Daniel M.,"Victorville, CA",59,31,7,5.0,11/26/2017,GREAT EXPERIENCE!! LOVED IT!! Date night with me and my wife and we has a very nice waitress name Lillian super energetic and awsome service. Are food was delicious and fresh. We had the Mediterranean tacos and the lettuce chicken wraps both were super tasty. Not to mention. They made a great cocktail my had it was the orange blood pomegranate sangria CRAZY GOOD!.. thank you..
Ruth O.,"Hesperia, CA",0,4,3,5.0,12/3/2017,It's great for the family or just with a friend or even by yourself. Great food and nice to go for a lunch or dinner. Great cookie deserts
Carlee R.,"Victorville, CA",59,18,14,1.0,7/11/2017,"Came here for my brothers bday, they did nothing for him (probably forgot) cause I've been here before for bdays & they usually bring a bday pazooki. Asked for red peppers, cheese & ranch w/ my pizza 3 times & never got it. Ordered a Long Island (reminded our waitress 2 times) didn't get there till everyone was done eating (25-30mins later), & once I got it, it tasted gross.  Step it up BJ's. Your waitress/waiters need to do better. Your chefs however are on point. Give them a raise 'cause I promise their the only reason people still go there."
Louie F.,"Hesperia, CA",43,3,,2.0,12/27/2017,Took awhile to get our drinks. Deep dish pizza is not what i thought it would be. Lots of dough and very little cheese and sauce. Just an overpriced Lil Ceasers pizza equivalent. Server was really slow.
Douglas E.,"Victorville, CA",0,11,,5.0,12/27/2017,Very friendly and welcoming. Have had several of their entrees and think almost everything is fantastic. Ouch is the best time to go with no crowds and a chill vibe. People will mostly complain about waiting. But you should give perfection time.
Cyndi I.,"San Diego, CA",40,302,339,4.0,7/26/2017,"I was very pleased with BJ's Restaurant.. it took some time to get a waitress, but when she did come around, she was awesome! Food was delicious! Fried asparagus, potato wedges, calamari, the Peach tea hit the spot.. and avocado egg rolls were interesting.. took home dessert and it was bomb!!"
Willy O.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",12,67,,4.0,11/6/2017,"Went here about 3 weeks ago after attending a wedding. There were several of use there. I've never been to a BJ's before so I didn't know what to expect. Got there right when Happy Hour started. We got seated right away. I'm not much of a beer drinker these days, but tried a beer named Piranha that caught my eye. It was a good tasting beer and not too strong like some of those dark ales. The group of use just ordered food that was available during Happy Hour. Overall the experience was pleasing."
Troy C.,"Phelan, CA",1,38,,4.0,11/16/2017,"The food and drinks are always great. Our server was Elijah; professional and polite and did an ok job.  The female server that dropped our food off did just that and did not ask if we needed anything else...such as our side of ranch that was not delivered. When Elijah took our original order we had requested a side of ranch dressing come with the meal. Elijah checked on us as we were halfway through our meal and I had to remind him we never received our side of ranch. Overall, not a big deal.  The only negative part of this visit was that our empty dishes sat on our table for about 15 minutes. Several servers walked by our table and other tables without clearing them. I saw one server look directly at our dirty dishes, that I had stacked neatly for them at the end of my table, and they walked right on by. It's not just at BJ's - I see this a lot at other restaurants too. Management should do a better job of instilling the ""team concept"" in their employees. I waited tables when I was a kid and if we walked by any other server's tables we helped out and cleared them, or if you're walking by a table with a pot of coffee in your hand or a pitcher of tea...take care of the customer. It doesn't matter who's table it is. Service is service. Overall, it's a great place to dine and yes we'll go back."
Erin G.,"Inglewood, CA",0,5,,1.0,10/11/2017,This Is The Worst BJ's I Have Been To In A Long Time. I Placed An Order Online When I Arrived They Couldn't Find One Of My Orders Only To Tell Me The Item I Ordered Was Sold Out & Then The Order They Did Have Was Not Ready Even Though It Was Past The Time Both Order Receipt Provided .
Amber B.,"Victorville, CA",5,18,,3.0,11/13/2017,"Service was meh, food was great! But our server seemed more interested in talking to the other employees than catering to us!"
Jared D.,"Adelanto, CA",0,39,50,3.0,6/18/2017,Alright service as per usual here. It seems as if every restaurant in the High Desert is such low grade compared to every other in their franchise in different locations.
Brittany W.,"Victorville, CA",0,10,,5.0,11/6/2017,"So happy we finally got a BJ's, their wings are the best! I love their root beer glazed wings with ranch. The atmosphere is very comfortable, and I love the staff. I have been here many times and can say this is my favorite place in Victorville."
Heather D.,"Phelan, CA",27,8,2,5.0,7/6/2017,Loved it very delicious I recommend the grilled chicken alfredo of course get the Pizookie you'll love your night after that
