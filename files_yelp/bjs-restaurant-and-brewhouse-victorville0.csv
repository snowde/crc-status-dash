Fritzinato R.,"Ontario, CA",26,36,21,4.0,3/14/2016,"Incredibly busy place. I have been here 3 times since they opened, I was even there on opening day. They are still working out some things because it is so new, but they are all very friendly. At this location I have enjoyed bbq wings, a bbq salad, mini pizza and the buffalo burger. Each of those was delicious and I would have them all again. There was a little snafu with our bbq wings yesterday but they realized it, apologized and comp'd them for us. I recommend that you download their app. With it, you can add your name to the wait list before you even arrive! Plus there are other perks that come with the app that are well worth it."
Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27,5.0,12/9/2016,"Great Experience became even better because of their employees Honesty! I'm a frequent BJ's visitor and from previous reviews you will see it's always a Hit or Miss... Never have I given a BJ's location a perfect 5 until now and it's all because of their service and in the end Honesty! As we were driving back from Las Vegas me and my wife decided to stop at this local BJ's in Victorville as we were in the mood for some wings and their flat bread pizza!! From the beginning the hostess was attentive and prompt as we walked in and gave us our options of waiting for 15-25 minutes for seating or taking an open seat at the bar area... we were tired so decided to have a seat at a table in the bar area so we could just sit down relax and order our food. I'll be honest I've learned not expect a lot from the service at BJ's restaurants based on previous experiences but I gotta say I was surprised, CJ our waiter was courteous, attentive and had a great big smile and personality every time he came to check on us and it was always at the right time. We had been driving all day so I didn't notice I still had my glasses on my head, when I realized this I set them down on the table to relax. Soon after the wings and pizza came out. They put the tray for the pizza over my glasses so I didn't notice they were under the tray throughout the night and completely forgot about them. CJ was awesome and so were all the waiters and employees as they all smiled and asked if we needed anything every time their was an opportunity. The food as always was great and ambience was awesome even though they were packed! (Normally the times I've been to a BJ's and they're packed like this, the service tends to go down hill as they are completely understaffed which in this case and in this restaurant they weren't) I proceeded to do a mobile check out and pay my bill while CJ was catering to other tables. He then asked us when he came by afterwards would you like desert, hang out or your bill? I said we already paid online. Oh perfect he said mobile checkout got it! Then hang out as long as you wish and if you need anything i'll still be here for you guys!!!! With a big genuine smile....not a fake it till you make it smile! Dinner was so smooth and great that when we left I didn't notice I left my glasses which I had just purchased that morning and was hesitant to buy in case I lost them sometime in the near future but I said ok I won't lose these so I bought them. Once I realized 20 minutes afterwards I had left them I immediately called the manager Cassidy (who even thru my angry tirade at first was genuinely carrying and nice) to let her know I had left them. She let me know that no one had found them and would call me back if they turned up.... Ill be honest at first I thought I had just got jacked from one of their bus boys or even CJ and was getting lip service from the manager now about not finding them or caring. So I gave her my phone number as she requested from me and my name and promised if they turned up that she would call me. Sayonara I thought they'll never turn up I almost even told her don't worry about it and didn't give her my number as I was so upset but did anyway.... Well I gotta say I wish I could take all my negative thoughts back and truly feel bad for not thinking their were still good honest people in the world and especially for thinking that CJ would have taken my glasses because 15 minutes later Cassidy called me back to tell me they had found them and wanted to know how she could get them back to me as timely as possible.... I felt as small as I ever have in my life at that moment! ALL BJ's NEED TO TAKE A LESSON OR TWO FROM THIS LOCATION! Awesome food, Awesome Service but most of all AWESOME STAFF AND PEOPLE! Corporate should be proud of this location....."
Brittanie B.,"Hesperia, CA",68,8,2,4.0,6/8/2016,"Love the food at Bj's, and it may just be that they are fairly new to the High Desert, and still getting the hang of things, but the last couple times I have gone, they can't get the orders correct. Still good food though, and the servers are always polite :)"
Julie H.,"Oak Hills, CA",34,230,22,1.0,2/18/2016,"I realize this ""chain"" restaurant is fairly popular, but honestly, the food is not that great.  Anyone can micowave something from the freezer.  But what really struck me was the multitude of really dumb, inept wait staff, who didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Perhaps I really shouldn't blame the wait staff, though.  The real blame lies in management who hire people who look pretty, but can't take care of business and serve the customers the way they should be served."
Danny J.,"Hesperia, CA",133,16,12,3.0,8/10/2016,Service was good and do the prices but it isn't quite a place to socialize. Im not sure if it's always this way but it was a little empty and slow the night we went. We left because we got lonely in the big cold empty space lol.
Erin B.,"Hesperia, CA",98,30,4,5.0,2/21/2016,"HUGE TIP: Download the BJs Mobile app and become a member prior to going! You'll get to skip the outrageous wait time using it and many more benefits!!! So excited we were able to try our newest local BJs!  I asked my husband tonight if he wanted to go try out BJs and he was a little hesitant cause it being a Saturday night on the week it opened he new it was going to be packed. I told him to download the BJs app on his phone and check out about their preferred waiting list I've been hearing all about. He did and was able to put our name in from the mobile app. It said the wait was at an hour. Perfect time to drop off our daughter and get there. We arrived a few minutes before our checkin time and the staff did tell us for FUTURE REFERENCE- if we are to put our name in with the app we have to be there to checkin at 30 minutes prior to expected being called or you automatically get booted from the system (so take note) but he was more than happy to add us back in our place on the list which was awesome cause the wait was, not joking, 4 hours! So we waited about 15 minutes after checking in which wasn't bad at all. We were pretty happy! I also love how they page you via text message when your table is ready- no wonder why there wasn't 4 hours worth of waiting people in the waiting area. We were seated and greeted by our waitress. I believe her name was Tara. She was super nice and very helpful with her suggestions. She recommended for me a non alcoholic half strawberry lemonade and half Sierra Mist which was sooooooo delicious and my husband expanded his horizon by ordering a new beer she recommended. The food was also very delicious. Was a little wait to receive our entrees but I ordered salmon and it was very busy so we didn't mind a little delay. At the end we were so stuffed and satisfied and even paid our bill using the awesome BJs mobile app we downloaded prior to getting there. Very awesome and impressive! Anyways our first overall experience here was an amazing one and we look forward to being BJ members and returning... Hopefully we won't be so full next time so we can order an appealing pizookie! Mmmmm!"
Janelle G.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,2,9,5.0,7/12/2016,"So it was my first time at BJ's in 2 years... Knowing it is usually a hot spot I tend to hesitate wanting to wait to eat or even have a drink..i came in a couple days ago and had Michael as bartender let me tell you, the service was amazing my food was amazing the attentiveness was just all the way around a 5 or 1-10 a 10! I definitely will be going back to see Michael soon !  Anytime you go in you should ask for Michael you will not regret the service !"
Nicolle M.,"Victorville, CA",72,16,,5.0,7/10/2016,"Went on a Friday night to celebrate our anniversary.  Excellent salad, appetizers and deep dish pizza.  We tried the beer taster which includes 20oz of beer for about $7.  Excellent service!  The Beer was delicious!  Definitely coming back!"
Kristin Ann K.,"Apple Valley, CA",186,19,2,2.0,5/30/2016,2 stars only for their skinny fries. Service was awful and war times were extreme. I've been to many other BJ restaurants and this one is a big disappointment.
anthony p.,"Hesperia, CA",66,18,3,3.0,5/1/2016,It's ok....but the one in Redlands pays better attention to your order and steaks don't come out dry like they did the past two times I've been there.
Joseline F.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/30/2016,"Tiko was an amazing server! He had a great interaction with our whole party. He made some really great jokes and recommendations. He assured that we didn't order anything that we were allergic too, which appreciated greatly. Highly recommend BJs. Ask for Tiko."
Brad S.,"Hesperia, CA",5,12,,2.0,5/23/2016,"This restaurant has been here long enough to get their service perfected. It took 15 minutes to bring my wife her drink and another 15 to get me a beer. We ordered the meal for 2, which comes with a salad, pizza, and dessert. The pizza came out with the salad (35 min later). The pizza was dry. Overall, we were there for over 2 hours. This is not the first time that this has happened. I see this being another failed restaurant in the HD if they don't get their crap together."
Vanessa B.,"Victorville, CA",142,2,,5.0,6/25/2016,Went out for our anniversary dinner. First time away from our newborn. We had an amazing ti.e. they were patience with our orders and even didn't mind helping us with our e gift card. My husband is a fan of different beers and they let him sampled whatever he liked. Food was great and service was even better!! Thanks so much .
Y T.,"Victorville, CA",0,11,,2.0,12/21/2016,"We went to the BJ's in Victorville to celebrate 2 friends birthday on a Tuesday night.  We had a party of 11, therefore we had to wait to be seated. OMG, we could not believe that it took over an hour to be seated.  Luckily we hadn't seen some of them in a while and we were catching up.   When we were finally seated, because of our parties size the hostess told us that we would  be assigned 2 waitresses.  It seems like they gave us the rudest, most sarcastic waitresses that that they have.  Only one of them ended up taking our drink orders.  First she said that she was going to just take our drink orders but, she came back around and also took our food orders.  She also told us because of the size of the party that we would have to put all of our food and drinks on one bill or we could have up to 4 bills for our table. Other restaurants can separate the bills, why can't BJ's? Back to our service.  The 2nd waitress did help bring the drinks out.  Almost everyone received their drink orders, well except me and one other person.  I only asked for water with lemons. When I finally got my water it was so full of lemons.  Maybe they thought I wanted to make my own lemonade! I wanted extra lemons, but that was rude and ridiculous. Our original waitress had to leave because it was the end of her shift.  I was so glad she had to leave.  The relief waitress was much nicer.  I don't know what happened to the other rude waitress.  Maybe it was the end of her shift as well. Over all, the food was ok. One person had cold mash potatoes and the other persons was hot.  It was just weird.   I have gone to other BJ's before.  I was looking forward to trying the BJ's in Victorville.  This was the worst service that I have received in a long time from any restaurant.  Would I recommend the Victorville BJ's, probably NOT!  I just hope that it was an off day for them and service gets a lot better in the future."
Candice F.,"Apple Valley, CA",45,7,,1.0,3/7/2016,"Walked in and sat ourselves at a booth in the bar area.  We took a booth with a dirty table, and was hoping a server would have the table cleaned right away.  After 15 minutes of sitting down, no one every came to clean the table or asked what we wanted to drink.  Mind you, to other couples sat themselves after us and were served drinks.  There were also 2 people at the bar register, as well as 5 servers just standing around the register chatting.  We got up, walked out, and drove to Red Robin.  I was passenger, and decided to call the manager at BJs.  When the hostess answered the phone, I asked for a manager.  She said "", ummm, let me go see if I can find one."" WOW.  The manager Todd answered, I let him know no one ever acknowledged us.  He said he was very sorry, and that the employees are still trying to figure things out.  I told him how there were several employees standing around that could have helped us.  Then he said, ""oh, uh, we were having a shift change.""  Okay.  I thought, good excuse.  WOW. Red Robin sat us within in 3 minutes, and took our drink order under one minute of sitting down.  As soon as we received our drinks, we placed our food order.  Our food was delivered to our table within 12 minutes.  BIG DIFFERENCE of service between the horrible experience at BJs and great one at Red Robin.  The server at Red Robin was very nice and sincere in his work too!!  Food was plated perfectly, flavor was amazing, and temperature was great!!"
Scott H.,"San Bernardino, CA",0,2,,1.0,2/25/2016,Never had a bad pan pizza at a bjs in 16 years ive been going.There was no sauce on the pizza.The manager asked. I told her...she explained it away and said shede have a word with the kitchen.Ok what about the bad pizza?Disappointing on both fronts..same price..step it up Victorville location!
Connie C.,"Victorville, CA",20,70,4,3.0,3/29/2016,"My friend and i ate lunch at bj's last week. Good good, service terrible. Took us almost two hours to order and get out food. We were both off work and chatting so we didn't mind, but if your on a lunch break, your gonna either be late or hungry when you get back to work."
Mary G.,"Victorville, CA",1,14,,4.0,12/14/2016,"I ordered the Salmon and Quinoa bowl, it was delicious,  my husband had the top sirloin. he ordered it medium, came more well done. I had the nutty brunette beer, very good . The hostess Khanna was very welcoming!"
Priscilla H.,"Hesperia, CA",0,5,,5.0,11/5/2016,Server Tico: super friendly and definitely made us feel welcomed. Definitely would come back to be served by him. He made us laugh and make sure our food was on point.
Natasha E.,"Hesperia, CA",0,15,5,2.0,2/16/2016,"Food was delicious when we got it.  We sat down at 9ish didn't get our food till 945. Our server was hardly ever around, we literally asked 4 different people for a refill and it never came.  Our servers name was Nicole and yes they were busy but she never was around when we needed something.  I wanted to order more but waiting on ranch or another water for 15 min was a little outrageous so I didn't.  Avocado rolls are amazing!  As a fellow server she really just needs to apply her time right. Will try again I'm sure in another month or so"
