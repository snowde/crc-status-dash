Meghan S.,"Indio, CA",1,3,2,5.0,8/27/2017,The waitress (Felica)who took our order was absolute amazing and provided excellent service suiting our every question and need. She was exquisite and so friendly. She took the time to answer our questions! The chips and salsa were great !!
Nicole T.,"Victorville, CA",8,11,2,5.0,8/5/2017,We've always had a great experience here whether it's dining in or taking to go.  I typically order to go from the bar once a week and the service at the bar is always on par.  I'm pretty predictable with Nit Wit first followed by a Hopstorm while I order and wait for food to go and I never feel rushed or anything because I'm a Togo order.  Any time we dine in we've got our daughter with us and totally appreciate the kids appetizer that they offer for little ones!  It's such a great distraction and I think it makes the little ones feel special.  The BJs app is great too and the rewards and coupons are very much appreciated!  Thanks for a great experience every time!
Ricardo R.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,4,,3.0,9/10/2017,"Pictures in menu enticing ! However , pasta included a total of six shrimp pieces . Very disappointed for a plate that cost close to 16 bucks . Misleading ...."
Christina M.,"Asheboro, NC",0,8,5,1.0,3/27/2017,"What a way to end our week long visit to southern California. Food was actually okay. Nothing outstanding, but not terrible. Service, however, that was an entirely different story. It took over half an hour to get our food once it was ordered. Our server, Sandra J. Was extremely rude and had an attitude when we asked about getting utensils for our to go order. There are way too many food choices in area to bother with mediocre food and angry waitress."
Arleen P.,"Victorville, CA",48,4,,5.0,3/24/2017,Great atmosphere and Jeremiah Red beer is great along with their Long Island ice teas
Kevin C.,"Victorville, CA",5,2,,1.0,4/28/2017,Ruined my night last night. Got my order so wrong can't even believe it. I don't like to be rude but can't help it when I get that kind of service. Had to leave without getting everything I paid for cause they had me waiting forever for my desert so I just left worst service by farshould have given them negative stars but they do have good food just horrible service
Angie O.,"Phelan, CA",70,47,30,1.0,12/4/2016,"If I could give no stars I would. On Friday night I placed on order online for food. Right after placing the order the waitress called to confirm my order. We arrived at 6pm which was the time it told us to be there. When the food came to us a pizza was missing. After the waitress looked at the bill she realized she did miss it after me telling her several times. So we waited with part our order while she got the other pizza ordered. While waiting we decided to eat our cheese pizza with half pepperoni. I opened the box and it literally had only half cheese, the other half only had pepperoni! (I even confirmed my order on the phone with her previously). So when she comes back out to bring us our other pizza (20minutes later) I have her take back the cheese pizza to get it right and she brings me 2 stupid coupons for free kids meals and a free poozie which I thought was insulting. Another 20 minutes go by and a different lady brings us the cheese but now it's the wrong size & it was cold and hard! I told the new lady who supposily was the manager Krissy just to refund us the difference and will keep these because now after waiting 45 minutes my little ones were crying and hungry. Another 5 minutes goes by and our original waitress comes out to complete our bill which we paid over $75 for! By now all of our food was cold. Here's the kicker... so I was so flustered that we drove away without getting our change for the difference so I call and speak TO THE MANAGER Krissy who says ""don't worry I will email you a gift card that will be more that substantial to feed your entire family next time you come in"" this is a quote directly from her. So the next day no gift card so I call and speak to her and she tells me it has to be approved by the general manager and then will be emailed. So right now (another day later) I get a call from a manager named Jose who says their system isn't working and wants to mail me a $25 gift card. I told him what Krissy had said about a substantial amount.... so he says I'll call you back which he did and said ok we will send you $50. Wow what a slap in the face Krissy, after wasting our time and messing up our order and us wasting our money on cold food, you should be ashamed of yourself BJs!  Update... The Real general manager from BJs called me,his name was Mike. He was very nice and very apologetic and right away told me he was going to credit us back our bill, which he did. He said he will work with the staff on issues like these and how to prevent and avoid them. Honestly I would have never written this review if they would of done what was right in the first place and comp our meal. It was wasted anyways. Thanks Mike for making it right!"
Kim H.,"Palm Springs, CA",34,76,145,5.0,7/24/2016,Scott was our server and he was friendly and courteous. The Cherry Chipotle salmon was divine. I tried the Fuzzy Nit Wit which was pretty sweet and delicious. The wine pours are a generous 7 oz pour...very nice. My friend got the Mediterranean Chicken tacos - the bomb!
Diana M.,"Adelanto, CA",5,44,72,3.0,12/4/2016,"We arrived for dinner about 5:30 PM for dinner. Expectedly, there was a wait for a Saturday evening. We were seated after a 20 min. We waited at the table for about 10 minutes looking over the menu before our server came to the table to introduce herself and get our drink and appetizer order. It was another 15 minutes before getting our drinks and appetizer. By then we were beyond ready to order so we placed our order when our drinks were brought the the table. Overall the ambience is like any other BJs. It's relaxing and laid back. The service was extremely SLOW. There were long intervals before seeing our server. At last our food was brought out in increments.  We had to wait a few minutes before even being able to eat our food because we had to wait for the server to return to ask for silverware. Seemed like two meals came out at a time (we were a party of six) My son ordered a soup as his entree and watched us eat half of our food before he got his broccoli cheddar soup. Overall, the service is SLOW and a bit on the inefficient side. The place is clean and the food is good but seems as if the service is lacking. Since this was my first time at this location, I most likely will return to give it another try."
Derek Y.,"Monroe, WA",0,28,5,4.0,3/12/2017,"I have been in town about 10 days and have been there 4 times . Great service, Loads of staff. You just sit down and someone is waiting on you.  The menu has something for everyone. The pizza is great, the salads are huge and fresh. The bartenders are always in great spirits and friendly.  The place is spotless and family friendly.."

Brad B.,"Victorville, CA",2,16,,5.0,9/7/2016,"I am glad to finally have a BJs in the High Desert.  We came here for a friends 21st Birthday. The waitress was more than accommodating and very attentive, even though we were all ordering food and drinks at different times of the night. The food was good and the drinks were not watered down like most places. The pizookies are one of my favorite things about BJs and they never disappoint."
Marlene L.,"Hesperia, CA",9,39,16,5.0,1/5/2017,The server was very attentive & kept checking up on us asking if we needed anything. The food came out fast & over all good place to dine in. I would definitely come back.
David G.,"Fontana, CA",352,95,185,5.0,7/8/2016,"Great sports and brewery type bar. Catch a game, great selection of signature drinks, food that pairs well with the drinks. Lots of cocktails and craft beers to choose from. This location (Victorville) especially good cause there aren't many places to compete for the same audience. 1/2 off pizza with a cold one during happy hour is a great way to end your work day. I lived at this place when I was on travel 3 months out of the year and stayed right down the street in Monrovia, Ca. Have to come 10-20 times to try different menu items that are good."
Adriana L.,"Victorville, CA",111,12,,5.0,3/30/2017,"I must say, I am very impressed by the food. I ordered the salmon and quinoa and clam chowder. Everything is amazing including the calamari appetizer. Great friendly service, and good prices. Awesome date night."
Erik R.,"Victorville, CA",47,1,,5.0,4/25/2017,Exceptional customer service when we were seated and served at our convenience and was fast. Anthony helped pick out an entree i loved and was a down to earth guy. He gave exceptional customer service and had terrific knowledge of the food items. He should not be under looked at all and management should recognize him with a positive future.
Jeff L.,"Ukiah, CA",0,2,,4.0,8/21/2017,This place was amazing it really touches my gay side with the name BJ. The food was good and service was good but I just couldnt stop thinking about how great the name of the company was. It was a amazing time great food and a good atmosphere and once again a absolutely amazing name love it BBBBBBBJJJJJJJJJJSSSSSS all day
Dawna P.,"Phelan, CA",114,12,5,1.0,3/22/2017,Wow just waited about 10 minutes at a table and didn't even get greeted by a server and then 2 people behind us  just got sat and got greeted and a drink order going. I refuse to give people like this my business.
Kisha C.,"Fontana, CA",2,25,12,3.0,6/9/2016,"I've been to many BJ restaurants and always had a great experience. We went to this location for the first time on Monday 6-6 at about 5:00pm We walked in and got seated right away. Ordered a large meat pizza and it took forever for us to get it and it was barely warm not hot like it should have been. That was disappointing, the bacon was cooked to death and so hard I couldn't even bite it. Our server wasn't very attentive and overall the experience just wasn't what I'm used to eating at this restaurant, probably won't go out of my way to go to this location again"
Letysia L.,"Anaheim, CA",42,6,,2.0,2/28/2017,The Food here at Bjs in Victorville was just ok.. service was horrible... waited for our food for almost an hour and its not even packed... waitresses just standing around... literally had to look for waiter for refills or anything else... service could be so much better... pasta was dry and so was the pizza... i dont think ill come back other than for the pazooki
