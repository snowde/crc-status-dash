John M.,"Victorville, CA",0,30,4,5.0,6/22/2016,We took the whole family there for Father's Day celebration. Despite being very busy we found the waiter and waitress that served us to be outstanding. We had a minor problem with one of our dishes in which they replaced and gave me a free salad or soup in the mean time. When  we first entered friendly greetings from the staff and also when we exited. I have been up here in the high desert for many years this staff definitely are the best servers. I wish they could train other businesses on how to serve customers. Definitely would recommend this place to all my family and friends.. Food and drinks were also awesome..
Jerry Y.,"Apple Valley, CA",1,10,1,1.0,11/13/2016,BJ's should not offer breakfast. They simply don't know how to make it. Stick to lunch and dinner.
David H.,"Hesperia, CA",48,14,,5.0,12/17/2016,"The wait was a little long for drinks and food, but it was worth the wait! Delicious food at reasonable prices. Our server Alex was awesome. Extremely kind, well mannered, and my strawberry lemonade was never empty. I must have had 5 of them, and he kept them coming! Awesome job, Alex!"
Stephanie G.,"Hesperia, CA",0,15,,4.0,8/3/2017,"The food is undoubtedly good but it is just way too packed here! It's so crazy how full it is. We usually go down the hill to avoid all the people and to actually be seated. Great food, not so great customer service. The workers are nice they are just way too busy to pay attention to anyone"
Latte B.,"Ontario, CA",31,83,6,3.0,6/13/2016,Stopped here on a road trip because little else was open after 11pm. Everything was cooked to perfection...then over seasoned to grotesqueness!!  I couldn't eat it!  I gave 3 stars because my husband's barbecued cheddar chicken was perfectly cooked AND seasoned.      I remember why I stopped coming here!!  They start with quality ingredients and go down hill from there!  Waaaay over priced for the taste of the food!!  :-(
Christopher R.,"Corona, CA",293,26,5,4.0,5/13/2016,"To be completely honest I was hesitant at coming to this location. I've been to many different BJs and each time the food has been good. I was hesitant though because of the extremely long wait times that are usually here and also because from personal experience I don't like restaurants when they are in the high desert.  With that being said this location had great service and food from whah I expect of BJs. My friend and I came for dinner and our 45 minute wait was drastically cut down to less than 5 minutes. Our server was great and even let my friend order lunch items even though it was dinner time. There was some issues trying to figure out some free pizookie that she had but our waiter quickly solved it for us before we paid the bill on our phone. Besides the long wait times, this is a great place to get food in the high desert and I recommend ordering pizza or avocado egg rolls."
Simon B.,"Seattle, WA",6,258,321,5.0,5/9/2016,"Popular establishment with quality and service as can be expected at a well run American food restaurant.  They've got a bar to brag about, well stocked with liquor and a cast of breweries whose names are tastefully displayed on a far wall. Airy, roomy, easy squeeze lemon breezy."
Pam R.,"Victorville, CA",0,1,,2.0,3/28/2016,"Last night, Easter Sunday, we decided to stop at the Victorville BJ's.    We did not have a long wait  and the service was actually pretty good, my only complaint was, and it was a pretty huge complaint, I ordered the BLT sandwich with fries, the fries were COLD and the sandwich was way way too greasy, so my experience with BJ's this particular time was not a good one."
Fel S.,"Victorville, CA",1,41,4,1.0,3/11/2016,"What a joke. Bad service, cold food, and server staff that dose not seems to be interested in customer service.There are too many employees just walking around trying to look busy and talking to each other rather than servicing the customers.   I have been to the Brea location and this Victorville location is far behind. The here food is not worth holding the name of BJs. I understand that large chain restaurants like this use frozen food, but the cooks need to check the temp and actual heat the food. Th center of my chicken as still cold. It was not worth trying to send it back, because I would have to first get the attention of a server which is no easy task. I will never be back to this location."
Gwenevere S.,"Victorville, CA",3,6,4,1.0,9/10/2016,I asked for a medium rare steak and they brought me a well done one. Then when I asked for a medium rare one the chef cut it open and gave it back to me and said it was medium rare. My daughter also ordered pasta and they barely gave her any noodles with barely any sauce. This place is a joke.   How do to expect to keep a business if you don't know what a medium rare steak is supposed to look like? Very disappointed in this place. Everyone's been living it up on Facebook saying it's good but I see nothing good.
Rene C.,"Hesperia, CA",0,2,1,2.0,9/6/2016,"Meal was just average, steak was cooked correctly but no spices or taste, very bland. The asparagus was weed thin and they didn't break the ends off. Waitress was very good, checked frequently. Need to improve their food before I will think about returning."
J M.,"San Diego, CA",34,109,19,1.0,2/22/2016,"Beer was watered down. Tried two of them. I ran into my friend who is a bartender at Buffalo Wild wings down the street and she even said her blue moon was watered down!  Pizza took 45 minutes to come out. Switched out waitress twice because they were so confused and overwhelmed. Saturday night was a 3.5 hour wait, so we didn't come and went next door instead. Now we know why ^ The waitresses were very nice, ONLY plus side."
Toni R.,"Victorville, CA",111,36,38,5.0,11/6/2016,"love the food and love the service, the  wait was about 30 mins not bad for a sunday night. The restaurant always clean  and great staff , food was delicious. never disappointed."
Tiffany H.,"Apple Valley, CA",11,53,26,4.0,3/28/2016,The wait was 50 minutes but its to be expected on a Saturday and a new restaurant in the high desert. Overall we had great service and the food came out in a timely manner. Only issue was the shrimp wasn't fully cooked on one of the dishes but the other dish was hot. The guacamole was great! You can also get on the waiting list from their app and they'll text you.
Ruben L.,"Hesperia, CA",120,1,,5.0,1/1/2017,"Came in for dinner tonight and our server was John B. I must say excellent service the whole time we dined in. From introducing himself to getting our drinks. Took our order and he made sure our food came out quickly, along with our desert. I appreciate the service and we will definitely come back and ask for john. Wish their was more servers like him. Thank you john. Your awesome."
Cathie L.,"Apple Valley, CA",8,58,14,5.0,2/13/2016,"We had the pleasure of being in the training exercise and we experienced a terrific time! Everything we ate from appetizers to pazzoki was delicious, I especially liked the mahi mahi it was unexpectedly good. I also enjoyed the Cobb salad. The wait staff was on point and doing a terrific job! We'll done B.J.'s! Welcome to the high desert!"
Kira G.,"Fort Irwin, CA",27,2,,1.0,7/22/2017,"Absolutely terrible service. Our waitress acknowledged us about 3 times. First, to get our orders (after sitting there for 15 minutes), the second time was the bring out our food, and the third was when we got our check. The food was awful. My daughter ordered the corn dogs, which were burnt (how you burn processed corn dogs is beyond me). I ordered the California chicken club which was missing the avocado altogether. The chicken was way over cooked and clearly reheated. It was tough as nails to chew. We complained and the waitress took the sandwich off our bill which was appreciated. However, this isn't the first time we've had an experience like this here, but this will be our last visit."
Shelley P.,"Victorville, CA",16,11,3,3.0,4/11/2016,"Our server was awesome!  But BJ's-why would you change the  original oriental chicken salad recipe to what it is now?  Highly disappointed but our server made it right and let me change it.  Also-you discontinued the oatmeal raisin pazooki-why???? We settled for the salted caramel pazooki instead and it was good,  just not as good as the oatmeal raisin.  I don't understand why Restaurant's change a great thing!"
Jessica T.,"Hesperia, CA",47,39,64,3.0,8/11/2016,"It was ok... Nothing to rave about. Just your typical apple bees or chilis. I tried it once and won't go back. Food was ok, severs were very nice, atmosphere is pretty cool but the prices are steep for just ok food. Everyone should try it once I guess."
Mike L.,"Apple Valley, CA",43,93,31,5.0,2/12/2016,"We had the mahi mahi and a Cobb salad then shared them. I've never been a fan of any fish but that mahi mahi was awesome. The Cobb salad was just as good and very large, crisp and fresh. They have handcrafted sodas as well, I had the orange cream with a scoop of ice cream it was really good. The service was top notch. This will be a welcome addition to our growing restaurant row."
