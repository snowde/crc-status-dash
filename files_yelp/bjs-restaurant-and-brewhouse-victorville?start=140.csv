Nina N.,"Victorville, CA",76,3,1,5.0,2/25/2016,"Went today and loved it. My husband's very picky and surprisingly he loved everything we had. Service is great, atmosphere was fun and all around a great experience."
Lozalalo L.,"Murrieta, CA",0,17,1,2.0,3/4/2017,I'm sure the food is great I wouldn't know because I've been here for an hour waiting on a table.
Mandy G.,"Apple Valley, CA",6,79,29,5.0,3/6/2016,"Adding to my recent review... Tonight, we had the best waiter ever! His name was Moe, and no exaggeration he was seriously the best waiter ever. He made sure our food was made to how we wanted, he even had one of our pizzas remade because he wasn't satisfied with what he would've brought out, he made more green tea for us when there wasn't any, and he had the best attitude! (3/5/16 late Saturday night) Original Review: Glad the desert if finally opening up some real restaurants. No more driving down the hill for some Pazookies, lol. The food was pretty good, compared to the ones down the hill. The waitress was really nice and our food was brought out really fast. My Newcastle was delicious, and I want to go back to try the bar out.  I think anything below a 4 star review is a little dramatic. This place just opened, I'm sure to many of the workers this is a little overwhelming working in a restaurant that JUST opened. Maybe if this was opened for a few weeks, I could understand.  Overall, we all had a good dinner & we're definitely coming back :)"
Ataru N.,"Hesperia, CA",10,372,181,3.0,2/24/2016,"NOTE: An up-the-hill 3 is more like a down-the-hill 2. I have not been to a BJs (phrasing) since my one and only visit in 2003 to the one in Westwood with classmates at UCLA. I remember the pizza being not real Chicago deep dish (not that I care as I am a NY/Brooklyn pizza snob) and not very good, but enjoying the pizookie (though it was too sweet) the table was sharing. Hostess and servers were all very nice. Moe (no relation to Szyslak, and probably not a 'mo, though I'm of course not judgin' if he is) was friendly and nice, especially since it took us so long to get through the bible of a menu and pick something. He was attentive and quick throughout our meal, and (managers take note!) was the best part of our visit. The food was not that great. The best things we had were the housemade sodas (favorites being root beer and black cherry) and the avocado egg rolls. We could see coming back just for that. The entrees were weak and made me afraid to try other items if/when we come back. We had fish and chips and parmesan crusted chicken. Fish had too much breading, with such small pieces of fish inside that even though the first bite was moist and delicious they quickly dried out by the time we started the 2nd or 3rd piece. Shoestring french fries were only okay, though dousing them with malt vinegar always helps. The chicken sounded like something that would have been delicious at Cheesecake Factory but was just overly salty and had no depth of flavor. Mashed potatoes tasted like the kind from a box, dry and not very buttery. I had to dig into the middle to get some that wasn't hardened. We ordered a pizookie trio consisting of peanut butter, triple chocolate, and salted caramel. The caramel was the best, though I was not sure I found any of the advertised ""pretzel bites"" in it (I think I may have but it just tasted like chocolate chunks with salt in them). Peanut butter was marred by whole peanuts that made it hard to eat (though YMMV if you like whole nuts). Triple chocolate was too rich. All three were way too sweet (as expected) and we left over half of each. It was apparently happy hour and we were pleasantly surprised to see our appetizer was $2 off. We left a 25% tip. The basketball game on during our visit has no bearing on this review but I am noting it here. As foodies it was of particular interest to us that one of the teams competing was that of the CIA (Culinary Institute of America). We saw clips of the players cooking, and the fans in the stands had a banner that read ""Yes, Chef!"""" (a phrase that kitchen staff often have to say to the head chef). Lol."
Kea H.,"Victorville, CA",0,9,8,5.0,4/29/2016,I ordered the jambalaya it was delicious. My friend order the ahi tuna salad it was huge and filling.
Billy B.,"Hesperia, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/8/2016,The worst service ever! Ive been there twice and the bartenders are rude! I shouldnt of gone back the second time!
Lou R.,"El Cajon, CA",1,27,1,1.0,4/26/2017,I went to BJ's Wednesday night around 1030 I ordered a beer and a Santa Fe salad twice the waiter is bringing me food that does not belong to me very poor communication between the server and the waiter he brings me wings that's not what I ordered then he gives my salad to someone else and she put her fingers into my salad and ate with her fingers then I was pretty much forced to eat the salad even though the girl that was sitting next to me at the bar had her fingers in my salad it's not the young girls fault she thought it was her salad the bartender Emmanuel H horrible bartender very poor communication skills between him and the waiter they really don't know how to conduct business especially for a restaurant I guess that's got a lot to do with the management i've ran restaurants before in my past and if I was the manager he would be fired the next day he wouldn't have a job
Johnny P.,"Victorville, CA",6,5,3,1.0,9/29/2016,"I was right the very first time I wrote my first review on BJ's Restaurant- Victorville!!! It is such a mediocre place. I did revisited this restaurant after a couple of months after being driven away and treated like outcasts during their ""soft opening"" day. Thinking, I should give them another chance. But to my disappointment, the wait is too long, the wait staffs don't know what they're doing, the food is average...Denny's probably is a better choice!!! They cannot even explain their promo mechanics!!!! What a disgust! My one star rating is not appropriate... They simply don't deserve it!"
Ryan S.,"Barstow, CA",2,2,,1.0,8/8/2016,"So disappointed by our last visit, literally the worst service I ever had! Our waitress wasn't even serving a lot of tables, she had other waiters bring our food, couldn't get a second round of drinks, and I almost had to beg her for ketchup. I have made many trips to the BJs in San B, and is one of my favorite restaurants! Love the food, love the beer. I normally would not leave a bad review on just one incident, but the waitress was that bad! I hope our next visit is better."
Bobby D.,"Victorville, CA",2,25,14,1.0,9/9/2016,"There wasn't a single part of my meal that was even up to fast food quality. The building and atmosphere is nice and the meals were presented nicely but everything was tasteless. We had calamari to start, the breading had no flavor at all and the squid was cheap and rubbery. I had the shrimp and asparagus penne. The marinara was really oily and watered down, the shrimp had that rubbery weird taste that shrimp gets when you rapidly defrost it in the microwave and the asparagus was undercooked, crunchy and flavorless. I had a peach tea which came after our appetizer and after my meal arrived, it tasted like dirty dish water. My wife had seared Ahi salad and the portion was small and you can't really mess up lettuce. $60 lesson learned, what a let down for a brand new business in a town like this."
JR A.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,47,41,4.0,2/27/2016,"Brand new to the High Desert so I know there are still some wrinkles to iron out. It did not disappoint. The atmosphere is great and the beers ( as always were cold).  The food left a little to be desired. My wife's order came out incorrectly the first time around. The second time, it came out correctly but was under cooked.  But like I said, I know there are still some wrinkles to iron out.  Give it a shot. BJs is a great spot."
Kelly R.,"Hesperia, CA",16,21,3,2.0,3/21/2017,Incredibly ridiculously slow service. On a  Tuesday night it took 1 hour and 45 minutes from the time we were seated to the time we got dessert. Food was fine. Kids meals were mediocre at best. For the wait the food should have been out of this world. Waitress never apologized.
Lisa K.,"Duarte, CA",196,5,,5.0,12/17/2016,"The food was amazing! Erin, our waitress was fabulous, friendly and professional. As a person with food allergies I REALLY appreciate all the options available to me. This is a place we will definitely return to often."
Nanii C.,"West Covina, CA",11,13,2,1.0,2/16/2016,Bad terrible service not dinning here again. Ran out of mangos and strawberries for drinks smh. They have only been open 1 uno day. Come on now!!!! Smh
Cody H.,"Victorville, CA",108,1,,5.0,11/17/2016,"Amazing food accompanied with amazing service. We did not wait long, and the food was amazing. Our server Lillian accommodated every request and was extremely knowledgeable when she helped my sister pick the perfect beer (Hefeweizen). I will definitely return soon! Oh try the snickerdoodle desert, you will not regret it!"
Charlene C.,"Victorville, CA",33,89,28,3.0,6/21/2016,"Finally got a chance to try out BJ's for lunch today.  Was surprised to have to wait for a seat at 1:45 on a Wednesday afternoon but it went very quickly.  We were sat at a table behind a party with maybe 6 kids under 5 or 6 and two were shrill screamers.  My husband had  a pulled BBQ port sandwich which he said was very flavorful but there was too much sauce over it and he had to eat it without the bun.  Came with fries and a little chopped slaw which we both liked.  I had the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  Pretty good as well.  Fries weren't quite hot.  Took a while for a refill on the tea and the beer samples I ordered probably took a good 20 minutes, they came after the meal was done (I had ordered them just after the food arrived).  May be that they were understaffed for the amount of customers they had.  Prices on the food seemed quite reasonable.  Beautiful bar."
Brett B.,"Apple Valley, CA",1445,123,2,5.0,12/3/2016,"if you're going to BJ's after reading the reviews, you're a moron. But i love bj's especially with my wife."
Tony D.,"Victorville, CA",59,169,209,4.0,6/27/2016,"Met a friend at the bar here during lunch time, very chill spot, perfect if you want to grab a drink and have a conversation without loud music or distractions, staff is very professional, had us try their seasonal brews, won't be eating here though nothing looks appetizing,"
Lauren M.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,10,,5.0,3/25/2017,Lillian and Anthony were amazing taking care of a huge party who were all in town for a soccer tournament. We will be back next year for sure and asking for these amazing people.
Sandra D. F.,"Pasadena, CA",85,10,8,5.0,8/12/2016,"I am new to the area, been here twice and both times was served by Lexi T., What amazing service! 1st time I was for a business dinner and we were so pleased with her professionalism and warmth. She was on top of our food item changes with a beautiful smile and sincere sweetness. She remembered me on my second visit which made me feel special. Again, great service and delicious food. I will be back asking for Lexi!"
