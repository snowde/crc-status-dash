Lindsay G.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,11,2,5.0,8/27/2016,My absolute favorite BJ's. Great atmosphere. Amazing food. Awesome customer service. Go here!
Cristine B.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,47,,4.0,3/20/2017,We go here for beer and pizza. The only time we come is when they have happy hour or a special going on because their prices on a regular basis are ridiculously over priced. Half off large pizzas on Monday and $4 house beers are the best way to go here. The pizza is really good with top quality ingredients. Also their pazookies are delicious!
Debra H.,"Victorville, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/29/2017,Waitress was hurried and told me about the special after our meal was over.  Brought ketchup after we finished the  meal.
JC M.,"Victorville, CA",0,12,11,5.0,2/21/2016,"Good food and reasonable prices. The food here in Victorville's BJ's was tastier than down the hill. My wife and I loved our food. My wife had the California Chicken Club with the garden salad, my son had the pizza kids meal and I had the half baked potato (veggie Alfredo) and the bowl of chili. Great friendly service and just great tasting food.  Will definitely eat here once a week at least."
Jasmine A.,"San Diego, CA",177,1,,4.0,9/18/2016,"I want to start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but bjs is an exception to my rule. I love their pizza. I came to bjs in Victorville with a friend for happy hour and our bartender Michael made the experience one for the books! He recommended great beer selections to go along with our meals and made us feel so comfortable, cracking jokes, offering tasty beer and suggested we go for cocktails next time we are in! We had an amazing time and look forward to having Michael as our bartender again."
Desiree B.,"Hesperia, CA",14,33,41,4.0,2/21/2016,Finally really good pizza here in the high desert !! We have been waiting for BJ's to open since we saw them starting to build the building. We were definitely not disappointed. The pizza is just as good if not better than down the hill. The only downfall was it was very busy and the wait what kind of long for food. But that's to be expected since it just opened up. The service was good and the people were very nice. The calamari we got was a little greasy but that can be overlooked it was still tasty.  I will rewrite my review once they get some of their  kinks out in a month or so.
Lauren B.,"Oak Hills, CA",102,13,5,3.0,6/26/2016,"The food was great, service was wonderful, and the building looks nicely decorated. The only thing that I'm disappointed with is the atmosphere.(hence -2 stars) IT WAS SO COLD IN THERE! I was so distracted by the temperature I had a hard time focusing on my food and family. I had the chills the whole time I was there, and because of it I now have a cold. Turn up the temp!!!"
Krissy L.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,1,5.0,9/16/2016,"Excellent service!!!! We've had the same waiter twice now, Tico (Timothy), and he's awesome! He recommended some good choices off the menu and he was really personable! Overall-Love coming here and we'll be back again soon!!!"
Amy L.,"Hesperia, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/24/2016,"This is my first time here, and the service is horrible. Been sitting here for 40 mins waiting for our food In that time our table has been ignored. No one has come by to refill drinks or even take my empty salad plate. After 4o min. Of waiting our sever finally let us know that she put In the wrong order! I'll never come back again."
Resident H.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,10,,3.0,4/20/2017,Food is great but the wait was awful and they don't offer a lot of places to sit while you wait for service.
Steve M.,"Wrightwood, CA",1,112,15,5.0,5/20/2016,Today we came at 330 for a late lunch early dinner. Got the $25 deal for two. I got a salad with ranch and she got cheddar broccoli soup. The soup was so good. I got a pepsi and a water and she got a water and a mix drink.  We got the bjs faborite dip dish pizza and a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The food was good and we didnt have to wait forever to be seated. Our waitress was nice and friendly. Nice meal and 33$ for us. Seemed like a good deal.
Paul A.,"Victorville, CA",103,18,25,5.0,6/25/2016,"My wife and I had dinner here last night for the first time since the restaurant opened. When we first arrived I noticed that the parking lot was full with no open spots close by. I wasn't surprised because it's a new restaurant! I was able to find a spot on the dirt hill no problem because I have a truck and wanted to park there!!! The restaurant is located near a hotel that's sharing the parking so it's to be expected.  No worries, I can walk a few more feet to get some good food.  The restaurant was packed but we were greeted with smiles and plesentries from the hosts. Our wait time was about 3 min. I see other reviews complaining about the wait time. If you don't want to wait then try eating at home or don't show up at the same time everyone else is going out to dinner. My wife and I arrived around 8:30. It's that simple... Anyways, we ordered our steak and ribs dinners. The ""wait time"" for our food was normal. When my wife's steak showed up she found a hair near it on the plate. The waitress was right there and saw the hair too, so they both decided it would be best to replace that steak for a new one. We know this kind of stuff happens because we are all human and it has happened at my house too. The food was replaced with fresh food so we moved on. We had steak, ribs, chicken w/bacon, shrimp, mashed patatoes, salad, and greens. Our food was outstanding, never better, like my tastbuds were in heaven with every bite good. Honestly, I was not expecting anything from BJ's  because of the hair incident because her food was replaced and the staff apologized more than once. Things happen, no worries was our thoughts on the matter. However, the floor management made an effort to stop by more than once to check on us, give us a gift card for our next visit, and a free desert with our dinner. And for that I salute you. I am not a big fan of restaurants and going out to eat but this restaurant has earned my business going forward, I will return soon! Thank you all for your hard work last night and our waitress was amazing and could do no wrong."
Dawn P.,"Phelan, CA",36,4,2,1.0,4/14/2017,It's making me give at least 1 star but I would give it none.Thought we would give BJ's one more try because the manager said please give us one more chance will I gave in and waited 30 min which isn't the problem to be seated but then I set my timer on my phone and stills waited another 10 min at the table were we  seated at and not once did anyone say they will be with us. don't recommend if your wanting at least a drink to occupy the time...until they have time to wait on you..
Stacy T.,"Victorville, CA",26,1,2,5.0,8/5/2016,What can I say...TICO!!!!!!!!!!! He's the best I would come back here over and over again if I knew he could be my server every time!!!!! Make sure you request him as your server. Very attentive and on it at all times!!!
Terry W.,"Ontario, CA",0,9,3,1.0,12/13/2016,"Yuck! I took my sister here thinking it was a nice restaurant. I don't even understand the menu. Why would someone go to a restaurant for pizza when there so many good pizza places around? But if you don't order the pizza you're going to be out of luck getting anything decent to eat. I ordered the fish and chips; could've done better with Vandecamps from the grocery store. The fish was thin preformed patties and the shoestring potatoes were just cheap frozen potatoes and they were very poorly cooked. Completely unappetizing. Honestly I cannot even figure how this place can stay in business. It must be the alcohol people go here and drink and then the food doesn't matter. After an hour we stood up to leave and suddenly our food came. We complained to the waiter about the wait; he got a blank look on his face, turned on his heel and walked away without saying a word. He did not apologize or even acknowledge that we had spoken. However he did get the manager who came over and discounted our meal. She said that they were shortstaffed because of a school fundraiser. While I understand that what I can't forgive them is that no one came to our table for almost an hour to explain to us what was going on. We couldn't even get the attention of a server. my sister ordered a pasta dish that was also disgusting. Their menu is very odd, they don't have a good variety and frankly it is waaaaay overpriced for what you get. I advise you to try Outback steakhouse it's a much better deal and certainly tastier"
Kimberly B.,"Victorville, CA",20,17,17,3.0,7/29/2016,"Great food and great waitress however I've been here twice now and both times we've had to wait almost 40 minutes for our food. This time we only ordered appetizers, 40 minutes for sliders and lettuce wraps is just not good. Their lettuce wraps are absolutely amazing though!!"
Brandon M.,"Apple Valley, CA",43,5,,1.0,6/4/2016,"They botch our orders every time. Poor service, very little attention from the waiters! 3/10 Avoid this place!"
Stacey V.,"Azusa, CA",3,5,,5.0,7/7/2016,"My bartender Michael Ramirez was absolute amazing. From start to finish, he never extremely kind and helpful. Making excellent recommendations, my family and I were able to enjoy our drinks and appetizers with NO worries and most importantly NO complaints! I believe this is one of the best costumer service I've ever experienced, and I look forward to returning to this restaurant very soon. Thanks Michael!"
Debra R.,"Sparks, NV",0,2,1,1.0,5/7/2016,"After bringing a family of 13 including out of state family. I will never go back or encourage anyone to go back. sent food back 3 times and the pizza came back still doughy. Waited 35 mins for a margarita and got it after eating my lunch. Wrong appetizers came out. Family having to eat the wrong food but didn't want to send it back because they were so hungry they just ate it. This is all after waiting a hour for a table. Horrible pre- Mother's Day lunch for our out of state family. Funny part is the manager thought 2 free desserts was good enough to comp us for wasting 2 hours of our lives we will never get back. So sad, disappointed and embarrassed that we choose this place to go to."
Seti M.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,4,4,4.0,7/30/2016,No idea why this place only has 3stars!! We came in on a Friday night. Hostess's were friendly and didn't wait long to be seated with it being somewhat busy. Food was great!! We had a small pizza and a steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Ordered the calamari as an appetizer. All very good! Will definitely come back on our travels from Vegas
