John K.,"Victorville, CA",9,8,2,1.0,4/26/2016,"As I been sitting here the waitress came by and took our drinks and has us waiting the whole time. Very horrible service. When u pay $15-20 a plate. We have 2 very hungry kids crying & thirsty & the waitress just keeps walking by & ignoring us. Very disappointed, I've never had this service with any other BJ's location.  After speaking with Gilbert. The manager. He was very helpful  and did everything in his power to make it right. I commend him & his efforts we give Gilbert 5 stars ! Ur doing a awesome job thank u Gilbert !"
Felicia F.,"Victorville, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/3/2016,"The first time we went there it was great.  Our server was very attentive and made sure we had all our questions answered.  So we decide to bring a friend for lunch.  First they seat us in a section that wasn't even open.  We sit there for 20 min waiting.  My daughter finally went to the front and asked what was up.  They came over and asked us to move.  No apology.  The girl serving us seemed not helpful or happy to serve us.  The food was ok but by the time we finally got it we were so disappointed it wasn't enjoyable.  If they would have apologized about the mistake it might have helped some.  60. 00 plus tip.  We probably won't be going here again.  I've worked in restaurants and when a problem arose we did everything to correct the issue.  Apologize,  remake food or give a discount.  None of that at this place."
Chuck H.,"Upland, CA",35,15,45,1.0,6/12/2016,There was no special request on the toppings I simply said that the toppings were small portions except for tomatoes and ranch dressing is not my fault that your chef made a bad pizza but I'm sorry I paid a little of money for a bad tasting pizza
Ralph A.,"Victorville, CA",0,22,3,2.0,8/16/2016,Don't use bjs to go. The food gets cold  they pack food the wrong way   Parking is horrible I got harassed by a person about a parking spot while waiting for the food to go
Britany S.,"Anaheim, CA",85,70,4,1.0,5/26/2016,Really disappointed by tonight's visit. Our service was terrible. We waited over 20 minutes for drink refills and just as long for the half of our meal that was forgotten to come out. The food here is exceptionally good but the service is ALWAYS exceptionally bad. This was our 5th and last visit unless we hear that service has changed. It's frustrating that we finally got a bjs up here and it's so unpleasant to eat at.
Janette M.,"Victorville, CA",46,22,16,4.0,7/7/2016,"I absolutely love BJ'S but this was my first visit to this location. I hate to give 4 stars but our food wait was unacceptable for a Wednesday afternoon. We didn't wait to be seated or get our drinks, it was pretty slow at that time. Yet our food took so long we actually got refills on appetizers, because we had to. Once we ate we decided to get dessert and the same thing happened. The food was great as expected but I'm not sure how long we would have waited on a busy day."
Janine E.,"Hesperia, CA",0,3,,5.0,8/14/2016,When the kitchen manager brings your food cause even he thinks it looks amazing it has got to taste great and let me tell you that jalapeño burger was great so was the ravioli bake so good all of.  We so are going back.  Thank u Adrian u were great.
Skye T.,"Omni, Miami, FL",0,7,,5.0,12/6/2016,We were told that the wait time around 6pm would be 25 mins and we were seated in five. Our waiter Tico was super awesome and kind and attentive. It was a pleasant experience. I'm shocked to see any negative reviews. Our waiter definitely added to a great experience and our food was warm and tasted great. We will definitely be back! Thanks Tico! You rock.
Scott C.,"Victorville, CA",3,49,1,5.0,2/8/2017,"I love this restaurant and their food. The employees are super friendly. This location isn't very busy, so you can always order quickly and enjoy your lunch in a short period."
Jerry J.,"Brea, CA",45,26,13,1.0,5/5/2016,Horrible service never got what I ordered because the bar tender forgot. Will stick to BJs down the hill.
Brandi W.,"Victorville, CA",22,6,4,1.0,8/10/2016,"1 star specifically based on the way the manager Javier (I think) treated me tonight! I've NEVER felt so disrespected in my life! I LOVE BJ'S Resturant anywhere I go! I eat there so much my family gets sick of it  because I'm addicted to certain dishes!  Anyway I was over the top excited when this location opened and I'm literally there ALL the time including opening day so unfortunately I may experience issues more often than others like food not cooked correctly, incorrect dishes sent to my table, my gift card balance applied to someone else's bill ( to find out when I'm having lunch another day and it was at a zero balance; I had to pay cash) I had corporate investigate where my money went it took two days but they compensated me well for their mistake, my app points being negative & not increasing etc. Tonight I encountered a mgr that I dealt with a couple times. I had an ""internal"" issue because tonight I didn't feel comfortable with my waitress, felt ignored ( when she walked right past my table) got up to add to my order when her and that mgr was standing at the register & I was upset! I proceeded to make a comment about adding to my order, being ignored, and wanting to switch waitresses ( never done before) and instead he walked away from the register off to the side and told me he doesn't have any other seating ( um a lie) and he wasn't going to change my waitress but he will take my add on! He said you seem to have a ""problem"" every time you come here and if it was me I wouldn't keep coming back! I told him I don't come here for you or the people I'm here because I ""love"" the food! Btw 99% of the issues are an internal training issue but  I've also had great experiences with other mgrs and waitresses so it's for you to get it right not for me to never come back here! He told me that he was offended that I didn't want to be served by his waitress and what if I was told that a waitress didn't want to be served by a customer (btw she didn't say that he was just being condescending) I told him then it's your job as the mgr to remove your employee from the situation just like its his job to remove the waitress if I don't feel comfortable with her serving my food! I told him he can't force me to be served by someone that I no longer feel comfortable with and she's serving my food he doesn't get to make that decision! He told me he wasn't going to move me! I told him your not listening I never asked to be moved I want the waitress to be removed! Then I proceeded to get him straight and breakdown all the problems that I had since opening day and how I'm a very frequent customer and unlike others who won't complain or tell you it's okay I'm going to let you know because your collecting my money and it's not okay! It went on and on too long for this comment! Then he proceeded to say well I'll take your add on what do you want? I told him but seconds later I felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE I didn't want his service. By that time what my husband ordered was already coming out! He brought it to the table asked us to taste the wings if they were cooked well enough & I said I won't and I don't trust you serving my food & I'm not eating any! He said so you don't want the wings I just ordered for you I said no you made me feel so uncomfortable that I don't trust your service! He said well let me go tell the cook! 5 minutes later he sent the wings out with another mgr and he was with him to ask if we still wanted the wings or take them to go? I said I want no part of it! So sat there and only had lemonade! Btw I forgot to mention he finally sent another waitress in between that and she was nice! But this visit was a NIGHTMARE because of him! I've had issues there but the mgr Alley and another Mgr handled it like professionals and had some great waiters and waitresses! There's been times that Ive eaten at BJS 3x a week so my face is easily noticed and if I have an issue its their job to make it right and I'm gonna let it be known! The WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD ANYWHERE! This comment can't do the experience justice! I will be calling corporate tomorrow! I don't want ANYTHING from them as compensation they need to give this guy a training lesson in etiquette, customer service, and management! He said his personal opinion is the people run the Resturant and if it was him he wouldn't come back! Told me he will give me a different waitress this time! Wow! I can go on and on!"
Paula B.,"Victorville, CA",53,19,,2.0,4/13/2016,Wait time was long ...1 1/2 hrs...  Bar was so crowded you could hardly move ...  Chairs so close together you could hardly get in and out ... Food n service were good but not worth the crowd or wait !
Kevin R.,"Victorville, CA",15,6,7,4.0,6/27/2016,"Use the app to make your reservation and your wait time is minimal. Our entrees came before the appetizer.  Everything tastes great. I ordered the Bison burger tasted great, but would have liked a thicker burger and more rare. Buffalo is very lean and gets dry when over cooked. We ordered the flatbread appetizer and again very tasty, it could have been a little crispier. All in all a very enjoyable experience.  Oh yes and if you like coffee, the coffee here is delicious."
Josh W.,"Apple Valley, CA",25,4,3,3.0,5/30/2016,The food is good but the wait is ridiculous! Another chain restaurant for an area already too saturated in chains. Time is better spent going elsewhere on busy times.
Joy Beth W.,"San Bernardino, CA",4,128,107,5.0,3/27/2016,It's always a nice fun noisy place which is why it's a sports bar. But it's even nicer then a sports bar. There was a problem with our meals my mothers steak was ordered medium well it came very done. Ok it's not a steakhouse. Then my husband order a pizza it came cold not just not hot it was ice cold like they forgot to put it in the oven. So we complained on that because well they are known for pizza. The manager came over and apologized and offered us a pazzokie because we are already reward members we had our rewards coupon or she probably would have  discounted our meal further. Our waitress Alissa was a sweetheart and so patient and understanding. Even though there were some mishaps we still love this restaurant. That's why I give them a 5
Cain V.,"Tustin, CA",0,19,5,1.0,3/20/2016,I understand this place is new and have tried it 3 different times. All 3 times the food was lukewarm when I asked for it hot. It's embarrassing to even ask for it this way but it seems to be the standard now days with big name restaurants.  Their name alone should be attributed to freshness and prompt and courteous service. That is not the case whatsoever with this establishment.  Ordered tortilla soup and wasn't given a spoon until 15 mins later. Ordered boneless buffalo wings and were a 1 outve 5 at best.  I will be taking my business back to Oggis in Apple Valley as I feel I have given this establishment plenty of chances on improving their service and food.
Cindy R.,"Garden Grove, CA",16,14,4,2.0,3/8/2016,"First time I came around last week, we had great service! Very attentive and always asking us if we were doing okay.  Second time around today was not so good. Food was great though, can't complain about that. I'm not sure if our waitress was new or what. Some things were out of her control I understand. However other things weren't. Our pepsi's were flat and when we requested a change of soda, she hesitated before bringing us new ones. Then our food all came out except our pizza, which 3 of us were sharing, took about 30 minutes to come out. 20 min into it she came to apologize and explain that the waiter that was bringing it out dropped it and so they were making us a new one. 10 min later pizza came out and I was still suspecting whether it was the dropped one or not because it was so fast. We asked her for paper towels and a wet towel because my daughter had ordered ribs.  She forgot and we had to ask her again, when we asked her she said she only had paper towels but no wet towels. Something she could have told us the first time around. She refilled 2 drinks for others expect mine. We ordered a dessert that took about 15 minutes to come out and then we waiting about another 10 for the check. When the check came she had charged us two pizzas, when we only had ordered one. To change the check it took 10 minutes. Our check was about $100 bucks and she's lucky we gave her $5 bucks tip. Pretty bad service, she said she called the supervisor and he never came."
Brian G.,"Victorville, CA",21,6,1,1.0,7/23/2017,"I go to the San Bernardino location all the time as I work down there. Never had a single problem. The food is always good and the staff is always on top of everything. I have now been to this Victorville location twice and I will not be back. Both times it took the server a minimum of 5 to 6 minutes to even acknowledge my wife and I. Both times when we were finally greeted, we were told ""I will be right back""... Que the 10 minute wait. She finally comes to our table and asks what drinks we would like, we tell her our drinks and that we are ready to order.... this seemed to irritate her. We get our food my wife's dish is made incorrectly and she sends it back. I had the pizza and here is what I really want to know.... how can a pizza be under cooked and burnt on the bottom at the same time? The servers at this location just don't seem to care. I overheard the girl that was bringing our drinks to us ask our waitress ""They want more Dr. Pepper?"" in the worst attitude just dripping with sarcasm. They only seem to want to cater to larger groups because of the potential bigger tip. My advice is... if you want to go to eat with just two or three people... go elsewhere. Only one star because the staff here is terrible and the second time eating here the food was terrible."
Matt H.,"Victorville, CA",7,10,13,2.0,3/29/2016,"Came once prior to this visit l, had deep dish pizza and the piranha IPA. Both very good! Came a second time at 10:30pm on a Tuesday night knowing they close at 12am! They had a decent amount of customers in both the bar area and floor area. The sensation of being unwanted was made very clear by the staff both by the hostess and server. Ended up leaving before ordering anything due to the fact that the staff clearly had no desire to serve us a whole hour and a half before they closed.  Not appreciated, think twice about going late!"
Ben W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,1.0,3/17/2016,"Bad service, poor management, we waited approximately 30 mins just to get someone to our table saying oh sorry I'm not ur server but I go ahead and take the drink order! Wait time to get drinks 20-30 mins. We don't normally complain when we go out bc we don't like to be ignored right after complain!! Then we waited another long time and still no one to take our food order. Anyway we finally ordered food was cold (that means it's been siting in the kitchen for long time) There's 2 servers approached us with 2 wrong items that we never ordered and was for other tables, they were rude like we ordered those foods but we're denying. Weird experience."
