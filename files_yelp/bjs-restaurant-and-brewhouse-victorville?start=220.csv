Diego R.,"Hesperia, CA",0,7,,1.0,6/10/2016,Service is horrible and the wait is ridiculous had to wait 1 and a half just to be sat. Food was not so great either. Will not be coming back here.
Karen Y.,"Orange County, CA",0,20,5,5.0,10/29/2016,"My first time ever at BJ's & i loved it. The food was great and the service was awesome, thanks to our waiter Tico:) He always made sure to check on us to and even recommended some great drinks.  Definitely will be going back.  New favorite restaurant in the high Desert."
Lindsy R.,"Victorville, CA",64,21,3,4.0,2/22/2016,"My husband and I took the chance at eating here on their second day of opening. The parking lot was packed but luckily we ended up getting a great front spot and when we walked in we found two spots instantly at the end of the bar. We were so impressed that with how insanely busy they were (so much wait staff walking around crazily) that everything felt like all the other times we've been to other BJ's. We had two attentive waitresses, our food came out at a great time, and everything was delicious. We are so glad to have even more craft beer available and a variety of comfort foods to choose from. We really hope everything stays up to par once the trainers leave and things slow down a bit."
Travis E.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/5/2016,I have been here a few times. I have had a good experience every time. Sign up for there free program it will get you seated faster and discounts. They were a little slow on the alcohol service but we didn't sit in the bar are either. Update. 6/6/2016 Downgrading my review to a 3 star do to service. Our order was taken incorrectly and of course the wrong food came out. So we didn't get to eat together. Then the food took another 12 min for a grilled cheese. Ordered monkey bread and came out burnt. No discount or offer to correct it. I'm disappointed because I liked this place before.
Rochelle L.,"Covina, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/18/2016,"I enjoy coming to BJ's often, but this location in particular for the service!! I was there with a friend & was being attended by Michael.. He was quick, attentive, & very knowledgeable The customer service is just as great as the food and drinks!"
Diana J.,"Hesperia, CA",0,3,,5.0,9/11/2016,"Many times my family and I have been served by the amazing Tico. He is absolutely the best server, very attentive and makes every experience the best! From now on every time we go we will ask to be seated with Tico."
Michelle T.,"Flagstaff, AZ",12,8,,2.0,2/23/2016,"The food was consistent good BJ's food. However, our group was lost off the waitlist, and my drink order was lost twice. Service needs improvement."
Devynn T.,"Hesperia, CA",6,24,4,5.0,2/20/2016,Our service was fantastic. We had a waiter named Will who was on point with his service and knew the beers on tap. Even gave us samples of his recommendations. Friendly staff and food was amazing !
Vivian A.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/7/2016,"It is so sad when a restaurant doesn't accommodate large groups. Today is my birthday and my family didn't know they were going to come and take me out until today. I called but couldn't be put on the wait list because we were more than 6 people and supposedly couldn't make a reservation because they only let a few big groups do so. When I was on the phone I was told they were not busy and we should be able to be seated right away, waste of time. My parents got their first and had been waiting for 30 minutes and we were told we had another hour to wait  If we want to go to Bj's again we will go down the hill better accommodations and better customer service. We went to Chili's instead, waited 15 minutes spent $450.00 and had a wonderful evening, thank you Chili's....."
Barrett J.,"New York, NY",0,1,,5.0,11/7/2016,"My wife and I were visiting  from New York and decided to try out BJ's for the first time! Tasty food but what made our dinner even better was the excellent service from Amy. If you take a visit to this BJ's, make sure she's your waitress! You won't be disappointed!"
Dana W.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,5,1,3.0,5/8/2016,First time going to the new victorville one...food was delish and our server was attentive and nice! My only regret is that I forgot her name ! I had the shrimp tacos... So good!
Melanie A.,"Victorville, CA",30,43,57,5.0,3/23/2016,Tried this new spot in town for lunch one day a few weeks ago. Being from Huntington beach I was ecstatic when I saw the familiar logo go up. Bj's did not disappoint once again. I ordered my favorite pizza the bbq chicken. DELICIOUS! No staff members really stuck out but was not disappointed.
Alicia D.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,2,,5.0,9/18/2016,"I'm writing in about my recent experience due simply to the amazing service I received at this location. I live in another city and stopped in for a meal at a restaurant that's known to me and was blown away by the service of our bartender Michael. He was friendly, knowledgable and made our visit one worthy of acknowledgment."
Wendy M.,"Apple Valley, CA",34,39,8,4.0,3/13/2016,We've been here several times since they opened & we love it. We usually come Sundays for the $4 Bloody Marys because that's a great deal. The shareable appetizers are great. We always sit at the bar so service is nice & quick.
Jeannae B.,"Victorville, CA",1,15,,5.0,3/13/2016,"We love BJ's thank you for coming to the High Desert. Our food was delicious (as usual) but our server was new and there were a few hiccups with our service. I think he'll be ok, he will need to learn to be a better multi-tasker.  Loyal customers"
David F.,"Rialto, CA",1,53,38,4.0,3/11/2016,"The new BJ's in Victorville is awesome! Our waitress, Ashley, was friendly and professional! The food was delicious and the service was above average.  We went into BJ's and they said it would be about a 40 minute wait, of course it was packed; however, we were seated in less than 10 minutes.  The restaurant was slammed and the tables full, but our food came out on time, and our waitress, Ashley, never seemed too busy.  We will definitely come back!"
Jasmine M.,"Apple Valley, CA",51,13,15,3.0,8/9/2016,"The service was good could've been better!Everyone in there seemed like they had the case of the Mondays LOL. Food was ok my favorite was dessert. I had a Pizookie, which is a warm baked cookie in a pan with vanilla ice cream (I recommend the macadamia nut one) If you can't decide get the trio and pick three that sound good to you. My husband had a burger medium well. He asked for cheese but it didn't come to the table with cheese he didn't say anything because he was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. For the appetizer we had stuffed mushrooms they all came in very different sizes ok whatever not mushrooms are created equal I guess. Mushrooms had too much creamy cilantro sauce on them it over powered the dish. It was supposed to be stuffed with spinach but I tasted more fillers than anything. Kids menu is average same as other places.  I'll probably go back just to taste all of their different beers."
Lauren W.,"Hesperia, CA",0,4,,1.0,3/2/2016,Worst customer service ever!!! The employees have no idea what their doing!! Should of hired people who actually can do their job
Nadine B.,"Hesperia, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/10/2016,"I love their food and other locations other than Victorville. For some reason, my family and I keep giving them chances, and the service, food, environment constantly disappoints. We sit for 30 minutes or longer before drink order came around, another 15 minutes before our food order was taken, and another 40 minutes before our food came out. We orders a mini pizza, ahi poke, and a burger. To me, these are unreasonable times. Another occasion, our waitress completely left is mid sentence when we were giving our drink order. This last visit, again service was horrible then to top it off, our food was like warm. Like it was left overs sitting in a car on a warm day then you get home and open it up. Disgusting. We will not be returning to this location ever again."
