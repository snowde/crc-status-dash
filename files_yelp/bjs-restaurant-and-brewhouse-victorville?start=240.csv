Jasen O.,"Lawndale, CA",22,69,84,1.0,5/19/2016,"This has to be the worst place to come and eat in the high desert. I brought my family of 15 to come and enjoy a meal after my niece's graduation, as we sat down the first thing to come out of the waitresses mouth was we do not split the check. We agreed on how it will be paid, next half of our party was served and the other half waited 40 minutes to eat. They served me and my daughter the wrong pizza and had the nerve to tell me it was our mistake. As the manager explained to me their process of serving I had to stop him and explain to him I'm a paying customer I don't need to hear about the way they serve when half of our party waited 40 minutes after we were served. I do not recommend this place to come and eat because they have nothing but excuses for the reasons we had to wait so long.  I expected we will fix it, all we got was why it takes so long. The manager was very rude, interuptin me when I'm explaining why half my party is sitting there with no food. I would give zero stars but unfortunately we can not."
Rachel T.,"Pomona, CA",0,1,,1.0,2/23/2016,"I understand their new to the HD....but don't waste your time! Wait till the hype cools down, got part of our order wrong...when food came out it was disappointing, had to set a plate back....2 hours of our life we can't get back."
Lin R.,"Victorville, CA",0,8,,2.0,4/29/2016,"My husbands plate was cold. When we notified the waiter he asked what we wanted him to do, my husband said he wants a hot plate. The manager checked on us and we told her what happened. By the time my husband received his hot plate the rest of the family were finished with our food and he not only had to watch us eat (although we offered ours to him) but also ate alone.We didnt receive a discount of any sort. Manager wasnt professional. The server was great and very tentative to us and we understand it wasnt his fault."
Bridgette K.,"Riverside, CA",9,35,1,2.0,5/25/2016,I love bjs the food never disappoints always get the great white and a pazookie :) but the service was the worst I have had we had a short brunette and having been a server in a fast pace environment I try to be forgiving but there was just no excuse for this girl ...took her ten min to just get our drink order forgot to pick up the bar drink so we got that later on I had to keep asking for refills and we waited another fifteen after our drinks were dropped off she was talking to three other servers by the POS system when we did order and get our pizza the expo served my bf a slice of pizza gave me a plate and walked away I asked for ranch didn't get it til we needed a box and then when she dropped the check I knew I would be sitting there for another 15 min so we just left the cash we had on us which was more than ten percent more than she deserved ....and when my bf went back for the keys she made some snappy remark like thanks for that ... I will make sure I get her name next time I go in if they let her stick around ...so I can make an actual complaint to management
Patty J.,"Helendale, CA",1,32,12,5.0,2/22/2016,"When you go, ask for Kate. She has great recommendations, is quick, and just cute as a  bug! Great time."
Bella M.,,1,8,,3.0,3/23/2016,"Visited for the first time with the family. Our main reason was to watch the Golden State game on a big screen. Luckily, with the advise of a fellow Yelper, they recommended to call ahead and get on the wait list 30 min prior. Great advise! When we arrived we waited about 5-10 min (on a Friday, too). Asked to put the game on to the waitress...I guess she checked but did not come back. So, asked someone else and the manager came back and said they don't have that channel. Darn it! Anyway, we ordered, got our food. I asked for no onions, but there were onions on my chicken pita. So, they sent it back. It was pretty good.  Their fries look like toothpick fries"". Never seen fries that skinny! My son ordered a pizza, he said tasted weird...and he LOVES pizza! The experience was average. We are not much of a eating out family. We go out to eat a couple of times a month. I prefer to cook at home... ok, not really... but just rather feed my family healthy, non-gmo, real food. :)"
Richard D.,"Placentia, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/14/2016,Go for the free food!! Because they are guaranteed to mess your order up!!!! Service is horrible almost Everytime.  Beer is good.
Ciara P.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,6,,4.0,8/14/2016,"I've been back probably about 5 times since this review and it's been great! Sometimes I may wait a while to get a drink because I can see they seat a server too many times at once. But I usually have Patience for that. We had a guy named Jacob i think, I watched him get sat like 4 times in a row but he handled it so well. Anyone who works in a restaurant knows how crazy that is!!! Anyways he was beyond amazing and I will continue to be back."
Damie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,3,4,1.0,5/17/2016,I guess this BJS needs time. Horrible service food was cold and apps cane out the same time as the main course. Manager had no clue what was happening.
debbie l.,"Los Angeles, CA",63,37,,2.0,6/30/2016,Good service but their buffalo boneless wings taste like they're store bought from a market and microwave ovened. They're avocado egg rolls don't taste cooked all the way. And the greeter wasn't that great at greeting.
L G.,"Hesperia, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/18/2016,"BJ's never disappoints! Great service from Jazmine M, yummy ribs, and that is why we always comeback!"
Steve L.,"Victorville, CA",152,30,9,5.0,4/2/2016,"The food and service were good.  It was busy, but I had to wait only 20 minutes.  I had steak, a baked potato, and asparagus.  Everything was good.  The hostess, server, and everyone else who worked there were nice and polite.  My friend didn't seem to have any problem with the food or service either.  He ordered the bison burger."
Steven O.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,18,1,2.0,5/5/2016,"As a family that goes out to eat at least 3 days per week, I thought I would try the new BJ's in Victorville. On my first visit my mind was blown as I walked in the door, the restaurant is open and airy, the booths very, very, comfortable, the bar inviting, and the staff top notch and really friendly. I wish I could say the same about the food (I tried). The first time we came I ordered the ribs and mashed potatoes. The ribs were not tender and the mashed, cold. The salad was good as was the iced tea. My wife ordered the salmon, she loved it. I decided to give BJ's one more try, thinking all restaurants might have a bad day or two right? So we went again, my wife got the Salmon, she loved it again, our friend got the Fish and Chips, she adored it, i thought i would try the Sirloin Steak/baked potato/caesar salad. Once again my meal was not good at all, I have had better steaks at Denny's! The steak was small, tough as a shoe and the baked potato very cold. The caesar salad was good as was the ice tea. I tried the fish and chips and it was really good. So my advice to you is stay away from meat stuff, the ribs, steaks, hamburgers are not worthy. My son said ""Dad this restaurant is known for it's beer and pizza"" so you should not complain. Well I have never tried the beer and pizza so maybe he is right, but if you are going to put other choices on the menu, they should be top notch right or at least kind of good? I mean when is the last time the manager ordered a steak from his own restaurant? i have to say the waitress warned me about the steak, I should have listened, or if she knows it's not good, then maybe management should make some changes right? Because if she knows, then they know (if they are good leaders) I will not go back. The wait time is very long for dinner, and if you don't use the App to call in, you will sit there a long time watching folks walk in and get a table really quick, kind of makes you a little angry."
Bailey B.,"Redlands, CA",99,12,5,5.0,2/17/2016,"Me and my boyfriend sat up at the bar, appetizers came out quickly and were delicious! Jazmine was great:) knowledgeable abd even saw her calmy speak with a rude customer and handle the situation! We will be back!"
Sheryl S.,"Victorville, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/13/2016,Food was ok but service was awful. Waited forever to get our drinks and they didn't come together. Food also wasn't served together so my dad was already eating while we still waited for our pizza. Yes they were busy but you need to take care of your customers better.
Mike B.,"Riverside, CA",0,18,3,4.0,8/12/2016,"Great food, good brews. Use the app to the get a table faster before you head over."
Paul R.,"Victorville, CA",0,7,,1.0,4/11/2016,food was OK but the service was terrible. We were a larger group 10 people so understand service sometimes takes longer but does not excuse the fact that 4 of the 10 orders they brought out were wrong and could not get refills on any drinks were told 4 seperate times that refills would be out soon then when checks finally came it took 45 minutes for them to come back with credit card so could sign and leave would not reccomend this place for anyone
ROGER W.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,4,2,2.0,6/21/2016,"So decided to finally go check this place out. Been to other locations and never had a bad experience. Until now. Where to begin. The service was lousy. Our waiter seemed distracted and inattentive.  This was about 6pm on a Thursday. I ordered the wings with a couple different kinds of sauce. After awhile they brought boneless wings out. In only one kind of sauce. Now true i didnt specify i wanted bone-in wings, but he also never asked me. So we corrected the order and he apologized, and they let us keep the boneless wings (which we really didnt want but ok) and they gave us a coupon for a free appetizer on a future visit. They finally brought out the correct wings which were VERY ordinary. My friend had the ziti dish which she didnt care for and i had the mushroom burger which was flavorless. .the drinks were decent although they were out of a key ingredient needed to make one of the drinks my friend asked for...cant remember the drink but it was on the drink menu. All in all, not a good experience. Will i go back? Perhaps in the future if things improve."
Danielle C.,"Victorville, CA",0,5,,1.0,4/9/2016,"I don't know how the food is but immediately the service was sub par. I called ahead to find out how busy they were and was told it wasn't bad so I did the call ahead seating. I let them know it would be me, my husband, and a toddler and asked if we could get a booth. We arrived 22 mins later and they were extremely busy and even though we called ahead it only took 22 mins off of our hour and a half wait time. So we left. If this is ""not busy"" then I'd hate to see it when it is busy. Never would've gone tonight if we had been told the actually wait time."
Adrienne H.,"Boise, ID",4,148,31,1.0,6/12/2016,"This place is disgusting. I ordered the quinoa with salmon and our waitress gave me the Alaskan salmon which by the way is more expensive than what I originally ordered. So let's talk about the Alaskan salmon. The rice tasted like Uncle Ben's and was fresh from the bag and microwave. The salmon was ok and the veggies on the side were hard. I addressed our waiter (the lady went on break) about how my dish was wrong and he was going to bring be a whole other dish, but I figured why wait for another dish, given that we already waited awhile and I did not want to waste that food, so I asked for a side of quinoa like the one I'm supposed to receive and I got a plain sour bowl of it. It was not good. The rest of my family ordered a pizza and Dominos is wayyy better. Do not waste your time or money here. People say it is great, but it is just glorified fast food. The dessert way ehh which was the cookie thing they have and I will NEVER come here again."
