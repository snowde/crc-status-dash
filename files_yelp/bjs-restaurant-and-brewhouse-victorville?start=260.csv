Jenna I.,"El Toro, CA",2,19,2,2.0,3/26/2016,Ordered the ahi tuna salad. Normally it comes with big pieces of tuna. This time it had a few little pieces cut up into halves. About a quarter of what comes with the salad at the other BJ's. Husband had to remind the waiter 4 times about his drink not coming. Sister in law ordered fish and chips. First order was burnt second was raw on the inside. Service was good. That's the only reason I have then two stars.
Andrew M.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,,4.0,7/12/2016,"Enjoyed great tasting pizza and great service, especially compared to the other dine-in restaurants.  The toppings on the pizza were unbalanced which led me to believe it was thrown together and rushed. It worked out for us because everyone grabbed a piece with their favorite toppings! I'll come back to try out more of the menu!"
Norma A.,"Victorville, CA",1,24,9,2.0,3/5/2016,"To start off our waitress looks like she's having a bad day.. Not a smile greeting us.. Oh, this is our 1st High Desert visit. When she came back to take our order I felt like i had to rush, like I had to be ready to order right at that time or else! Did i mention that there are A LOT of waiters/waitresses here? My expectations were high and already they are sadly lowered due to the horrible service received up to this point :(   Sooooo after our appetizer & my meal coming out..... Tick Tock Tick Tock find out that my honeys Fish & Chips were never put on order ! So do i eat alone or let my food get cold???? Decisions, decision. Finally we get his meal. The Fish & chips were sooooo greasy .. I tasted them to make sure my hunny would be happy with them. If it wasn't for that fact that he was hungry & that the manager came over to apologize and say that his meal & our Pizookie was going going to be for free, I would have said take it back & try again. My Shrimp tacos were Deish.. Over all the waitress experience made my decision on the rating. We will definitely go to one of many other choices that we have before coming back. We should have gone to Olive Garden like we originally planned !!!!"
Nicole C.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,,3.0,6/8/2016,"BJ's is really good loved the food.But the customer service wasn't that good.I waited 30 minutes just for a to-go cup.The prices were ok I found some stuff really expensive,but the rest was good."
Chris W.,"Hesperia, CA",0,6,,2.0,5/19/2016,"It's a chain restaurant, therefore you shouldn't expect greatness. Beer isn't cold enough. Food is average at best. Call ahead seating is a joke.  The meat on my roast beef au jus was not very fresh. Friend said his ribs ""weren't bad."" Hostess was curt, but waiter was good.  Hubby wanted to try it, but we won't go back."
SR S.,"Apple Valley, CA",11,54,19,5.0,2/12/2016,"We attended one of their rehearsal dinners to support Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, started off with Root Beer Glazed Ribs, tried their Deep Dish Ziti and Balsamic Glazed Chicken.  Everything was amazing, just glad they opened one up here in Victorville finally.  Service was amazing, staff very friendly and welcoming."
La Shawn G.,"Victorville, CA",6,8,,1.0,3/24/2016,"I'm am up at 4:00 a.m. in the morning writing you to express how sad I am about my families experience last night at your Victorville's Resturant. I want to start off saying that last night was a very special night for my family and we planned to end it at BJs to share a meal with close friends and family. Mind you we just moved here about 9 months ago from Temecula. That team there including management has always made us feel welcomed and appreciated, if there was a problem right away the management would take care of it. So just FYI I give that store a 10/10. Back to the issue at hand, March 23, 2016 our party of 20 walked into BJs excited to have some drinks and to dig into a great meal. My family and I already knew what we where going to order because we had our all time favorites dishes on our minds including my 10 and 11 year old child. We even had a 14 year old friend visiting from Temecula so she knows how BJs service is usually. The two servers greeted us promptly with awesome smiles on their faces so we were under the impression that the whole night was going to be a success. To our disappointment for my family of 5 plus our visiting friend it was a disaster. The female server which I'm sorry I can't recall her name took our drink order and didn't even come back until our friends were on to their refills of their strawberry lemonades. My husband and I didn't even get our two waters that we ordered. I think the bartender brought us our two beers. By this time the friendly and very attentive male server Edgar was taking our friends orders. My family and I sat and waited and waited until I flagged a very nice host down to ask if he could please get our server for us. And he did, she was over at another table that got there I think after us taking there order and didn't even come back to our table to acknowledged that she didn't take our order or even give us the courtesy to let us know but she turned this over to Edgar. We stopped Edgar and he took our order and said, ""I'm sorry she got really busy and asked me to take your order."" By this time our friends received half their appetizers. And 5 to 10 minutes late to receive their meals. My husband and I told a male manager what hand took place and to cancel our orders because our friends were done eating and ready to go home by that time which was 9:20ish. To be totally honest it felt like he didn't really care and he said he would cancel it but that wasn't enough for me because I thought to myself where can we find a place to feed our 10&11 year old this late at night? So I asked for the other manager she was female and very apologetic. She said ""I told the kitchen to get right on it wait they should've beat me out here, wasn't your food the burger and the ribs?"" We said no, I don't even know if our food ever even got ordered. We said could we have our check please and they gave it to us it was $13.18 and we tipped Edgar $10 because we know that if you would've started off being our server he would did great. The female Manager offered to make some food for us to go and we said no thank you and she brought us a gift card of $25 for the next time and gave the girls two desserts but my husband said he doesn't want ever go to the Victorville one the again. If we go to BJs we will go back to the Temecula one. We ended up taking our sleepy children through the drive thru of In and Out. Obviously, this is still affecting me that I'm up early in the morning writing to corporate. I know this was a eye full but thanks for taking the time to read it. Please express to Edgar M server number 401 and the male host that they did a great job.  And if I would consider ever going back I would ask for his section. And express to management of Victorville to please make sure that not one more family experience that kind of servers again!"
Pam I.,"Hesperia, CA",0,6,,5.0,3/19/2016,Excellent service and excellent food!  BJs blonde ale was amazing.   Britney was our fantastic server!   Thanks!
CT B.,"Pinon Hills, CA",0,30,1,5.0,2/29/2016,Erin was our server tonight. She provided excellent service and was very attentive. She has a fantastic attitude and an upbeat personality. She helped make the evening very enjoyable
Jim H.,"Victorville, CA",1,35,,5.0,2/20/2016,"My wife and I had a great food, beer and service from Sydni. She was attentive and friendly. The Mediterranean deep dish pizza is amazing. The portabella and asparagus salad is really tasty as is the beet and arugula salad. The Jeremiah Red and Chocolate ale are stand outs amongst the beers we tried. The peanut butter pazooki speaks for itself. Delicious! The kitchen is a bit slow and some of the staff are inexperienced but they make up for it with smiles and good service."
Miss A.,"Victorville, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/8/2016,"I am a BJs fan, however, had such a bad experience today at this location. Extremely slow and inattentive service even though we (party of 6) came in well before the dinner rush. We had 3 different servers. The meals took quite long time and when they arrived half were cold. We had to ask for water and beverage refills. We were told the pizookies were delayed because a server dropped all of them. So, finally the check...it took over 45 minutes to get right. We were told the 1st server did not do the check right when she took our orders, which we understood, but why did we have to wait almost an hour to close out our checks? Even after we helped get the check right by lettering (A-B-C) which meals go together, it still took several attempts to get it right. The manager said the 1st server had been on shift since the morning and that the chef will need to do better, but didn't seem to understand that it was not just that.  We explained the entire 3-hour experience was horrible and unacceptable. The manager gave us coupons for complimentary pizookies. More and better training for chefs and servers as well as customer service training for all staff may help improve the experience for future guests."
Jimmy H.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,1,,5.0,2/19/2016,The Hall family would like to give a big shoutout to Victorville's BJ's Brewery. Thank you for your kindness and graciousness you have shown the family. KEEP UP THE AWESOME COMMUNITY SERVICE!! You are awesome and the pizza was delicious!!!
Christina P.,"Victorville, CA",0,15,5,5.0,2/18/2016,"Great food, AWESOME service! I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken - it was served hot and tasted fresh. My grandson ordered Boneless Buffalo Wings and loved them too! Our server, Sara B., was fabulous! She was very friendly and made sure we always had full drinks and everything we needed to enjoy our meal. We will definitely be returning!"
Celia S.,"Victorville, CA",66,1,,5.0,2/15/2016,Great staff nice and friendly environment. Plenty on staff to accommodate the high volume of customers. Food was great.
J B.,"Victorville, CA",0,6,,2.0,4/28/2016,We called en-route and asked to be put on there waiting list she said it would be 20-30min that was @ 5:35pm. Arrived 5:39 there was alot of people waiting to be seated. At 6:10 we asked  where we were at on the list after hearing many other parties ask and hearing one party of two asking and the waitress saying they were the only party of two left. She told me she did not have any info with my name on the list. She then took my info again name phone etc. Stated she would put me in the front of the line due to there mistake. We waited for another 15 min before a guy at the bar waived us over for an open table. Once we sat food came quick. Waitress was nice and got us our drinks fast. Food was ehh. Jambalaya was good although I asked if I could replace the rice pilaf for brown rice and she said no that it came that way. R U Serious! That's when I realized it was probably like olive garden and came frozen then boiled in a bag before put on a plate.  Salmon Quinoa bowl had no flavor it was very plain. I would not come her again probably there is a better restaurant a few door down. With cheaper drinks.
Tee L.,"Victorville, CA",0,5,1,1.0,2/21/2016,Where do i start i am currently at this location first of all i am a member of bjs have been for about 5 years i always order ahead as i did tonight. Today is my first time at the Victorville location i get here and i was greeted very nicely when i tell the employee at the front that i already ordered my food no one had an idea how to look up my name or seating she then called another employee which didnt know either she then called the general manager which didnt know either. Finally the girl who helped me at first found a way to do it. A waiter then seated us and gave us menus and asked if we wanted something to drink i said i PREORDERED my food and drinks already he said ok and he would see where our food was i waited they were out of strawberry lemonade i ordered a pineapple juice for myself and they brought me a kids size when i had just told my waitress it was a big size for myself i am still sitting here im pretty sure they know im upset because the manager came without me even asking her to come. I also asked for avocado egg rolls they did not have them either my daughter ordered mini corn dogs they gave her grilled cheese sandwhich i will never come here again and continue to dine at the montebello location that has exceptional service with a great staff
