Nipple S.,"Victorville, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2017,This was the worst experience at BJ's. So my wife and I went in on Friday night wasn't to crowded. I drink two pirannah pale ales. Went to order one more than my server tells me two beers per hour I mean come on its a brewery for Christ sake. My wife got steak and potato the steak was mushy and potato was put in the microwave. Server was already standing around talking to much every trip she took talking to co workers bad service. Asked for manager I asked to be comped for my meal and said best she could is half on the steak and potato. Wife was ready to go so I didn't ask for GM wish I did. I work at red lobster and what I got from BJ's was horrible 4Th st in ontario bj always get good service and food. To make it worse there was a crackhead screaming and crying for 15 minutes before the police came. If you want BJ's I suggested go to ontario off 4TH st. I was not pleased.
Andrew M.,"Hesperia, CA",5,47,,4.0,6/13/2017,"First Experience 5 Stars. Last night's experience 2 stars. Average 3.5 stars. Round up to 4 stars. First time the drinks were great and the waitress was really helpful. Just standard for a good time, right? I hate that at American restaurants (referring to restaurants in the USA not necessarily American cuisine) the wait staff bring you your bill and try to chase you out of the restaurant the minute that they think they have finished making money off of you. That was my experience last night. By all means, stop by and ask if we need anything. However when you ask me if we're ready for the bill I am getting the impression that you need me out! It was brought up more than once. Even if you did need me out, I couldn't care less. I am sipping on my drink. I'm talking to my friend. Stop harassing me. Thanks."
Jeanette C.,"Hesperia, CA",50,36,275,4.0,6/12/2017,I'm a foodie! What's there not to love about BJs. Food is good and I especially love their craft beers on tap. My favorites are the Ahi salad the pizza is delicious. Prices are a little high but worth it.  The service is always welcoming and friendly.
Yelp E.,"Hesperia, CA",0,12,,3.0,11/4/2017,"First Visit was great. Second visit had the order messed up  Third visit - well, I just got the feeling that I didn't need to be back soon."
Lena G.,"Hesperia, CA",13,5,,4.0,10/26/2017,Love the food and drinks service  is quick but my only gripe is the food is a bit pricy
Suzy Q.,"San Martin, CA",8,309,18,4.0,6/1/2017,The Cherry glazed Salmon was delicious. Take out service was slow even tho my order was ready when I arrived.
Randy P.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,,3.0,12/15/2017,Good food but takes a while to come out and serve you the boneless wings are like chicken nuggets
Mike F.,"Miami, FL",0,58,6,3.0,9/5/2017,"I was hoping for a little better food and drink prices for ""happy hour"" I ordered ribs and they were a little tough, I prefer ribs to be fairly tender. They were still good and the fries that came with it were really good. I was sitting at the bar and the bartender was extremely busy but was always attentive."
Anne T.,"Ontario, CA",2,61,3,2.0,3/17/2017,"Came here at the request of my grandchildren. Let me preface by saying I've visited other BJs and while the food has been palatable I've never been blown away by anything I've eaten at the establishment.  We had the California Club sandwich, a small cheese pizza, spaghetti, and the Parmesan Encrusted chicken. Of all of these entrees the only thing memorable was the hair in chicken. Ugh. While the wait staff and management were apologetic and did comp a dessert, it was just gross. At this price range, hair in the meal is simply unacceptable. (Not that hair in one's meal is ever acceptable) I would not recommend spending your money at this establishment ever. If you have to go to a chain restaurant, try one of the many other options available in Victor Valley."
Sal M.,"Victorville, CA",143,11,1,1.0,3/18/2017,"04/7 - Went ahead and made it a 1 when became clear that the Manager tells you to email her and doesn't reply. Spin... I'm sure she just pastes that same reply. I won't be visiting BJ's again.  Well, the food was pretty good. I've never seen a menu with such restrictions though ""Mon - Fri Only"" type of stuff. They brought our appetizers and meals at the same time. Some of the appetizers were piping hot while others were just warm. The potential is there BJ's Victorville; there's no reason you should have an overall 3 star rating. Some training: ensuring your wait staff doesn't request appetizers and meals at the same time. * I emailed. Thank you * Ok, so really it was no bid deal Allie but now it's been 10 days and you still haven't replied to my email. Makes me feel as though you just paste a ""sorry, please email"" to every negative review (even though my review was wasn't that negative)."
Erin S.,"Apple Valley, CA",106,1,,5.0,9/30/2017,"We love our neighborhood BJ's. Great service and delicious food. My husband and I were so excited when Bjs opened in the desert, we missed it terribly when we moved here.  This location however exceeds many others. Not only is the food always just right, but the service has us always wanting to come back.(request Tiko or Elijah section). I am so pleased with the new menu options and did I tell you about the brews...! Certainly we'll be back."
H C W.,"Adelanto, CA",267,137,144,1.0,9/4/2017,Definitely disappointed with last visit. One of my favorites is the baby backs ribs. Visited in the day of the special. I had the soup and it was great. Took the rest of the meal home for a disappointing late afternoon. First before I left I was overcharged and didn't realize until after up mobile pay and the check was brought to the table. Had to wait for dinner to be delivered 10-15 mins then had to wait 10+ mins for the pazookie and then more time for the waitress to checkout error on check. Gave up and just left.  When I settle down ready to eat the ribs it was what I my taste buds prepared. Fatty and very little meat. No bbq sauce and just bland. Not giving up on BJ's just probably this one. I take my business clients there so we can make it a working lunch.
Amanda J.,"Ontario, CA",43,37,24,5.0,9/4/2017,"I relocated to the area while construction was in progress. We decided to give it some time to work out the kinks before trying the new location. I'm happy we did! It's was a mid week visit during lunch hour, and despite the lack of staff serving was above par. More than one member of staff followed up during our courses,  our drinks were never empty and the taste of our favorite meals were better than we had remembered."
Armando T.,"Glendora, CA",5,6,5,5.0,9/25/2017,My wife and I sat down with Marissa  at the bar top around 10:00 p.m.  Saturday night 9/23/17.  We had A-blast!  Not just because it was our 1st time out without the kids in a long time  But a big part because of the great service we got at the bar top. Marissa was very attentive sweet and a true professional.  I always appreciate a bartender that has a great attitude  And respect for the job they are doing. It was great to see somebody take pride in their work.  Thanks again Marissa great job!
Vivian C.,"Adelanto, CA",38,4,,5.0,10/11/2017,"We had a great experience! Service was great and so was the food! I ordered the new Orleans jambalaya and it was delicious!  Packed with that Cajun flavor, the shrimp was nice and tender,  I just loved it. For dessert I got the salted Carmel pizookie and my husband got the triple chocolate!  Both were delicious! And only $3 on Tuesdays which is well worth it! Will definitely go back!"
Mary J.,"Seattle, WA",411,169,230,1.0,8/15/2016,"BJ's is a brewery chain, found in many states. The thing I love about BJ's food is the taste, wide selection and large portions. My favorite is the avocado egg rolls. The sweet sauce that it comes with complements the rolls well. Most times, I just go to BJ's for the avocado egg rolls. I used to go for the baked potatoes- they're loaded, gigantic and amazing. Unfortunately, this particular BJ's location gets 1 star mainly because the service was poor. Not that we got any attitude from the staff, but they just kept getting things wrong repeatedly, the wait was long for sauce, and some of the servers/ waiters looked pretty complacent at times (walking around ignoring customers) on a fairly busy night. Our server seemed like a nice guy, but you could tell that other servers weren't really listening or the communication was really poor overall between the staff. It was a Wednesday Night, I went with a party of 5, and the place was packed. My cousin ordered her chowder in a bread bowl. It arrived in a regular bowl. She had to flag down several waiters/ servers for her order in the bread bowl. Took forever to get a servers attention, each time taking 10-15 minutes of waiting and following up. The rest of us were finishing our meals and servers had brought my cousin's clam chowder soup in a regular bowl incorrectly THREE TIMES before they finally brought it in a bread bowl. It was pretty upsetting for my cousin.  There was no discount and they still made my cousin pay full price for the meal. They lost a customer for life. Also, when I asked for more sweet sauce for the avocado egg rolls, they brought me SOY SAUCE. I gave up after that. Get it together, BJ's of Victorville. The service sucked."
Lisa S.,"Apple Valley, CA",119,33,125,5.0,8/29/2016,"Amazing food and I LOVE that they are open till Midnight and 1am on Friday and Saturday! Hostess is VERY FRIENDLY and the waitress we had was very friendly, very personable and we are already on a first name basis!  Her name is Jasmine and I highly recommend you ask for her!   Also we've had a server named Ali who is SUPER NICE and very personable!  We also LOVE ""our"" other servers Elija and Tito!! They are always so nice and always take care of us!!  We will definitely be back!! Nice to have a new restaurant in the High Desert."
Janice D.,"North Las Vegas, NV",0,6,2,1.0,9/17/2017,"This was the third time we went to eat here.  All 3 times, the service was terrible.  Won't be going back.  Waitress basically disappeared.  There were 2 of us, and one entree was brought out 10 minutes before the other.  No waitress.  When she did come by, she totally ignored us.  Had to ask for silverware from a bus person.  We won't be going back.  3 strikes, you are out."
Kathy B.,"Kingman, AZ",3,105,62,2.0,8/18/2017,I will not go out of my way to go to BJs.  The service was good but the food was not even good.  Poor is the best I judge it.  The chicken tortilla soup is a joke little chicken virtually no tortillas and it was thickened with cornstarch canned soup tastes much better.  The salad was so small but tasty.  I will not go back
Brittany B.,"Anaheim, CA",2,10,6,5.0,4/4/2017,Anthony took great care of us! Today is my birthday and he was very knowledgeable of the items on the menu as well as he beers which I'm a fan of. He suggested a great IPA which I liked a lot. He is a great server thanks for making my birthday fun! Smiley face!
