Ingrid F.,"Victorville, CA",0,16,16,5.0,5/7/2017,"John was the best server ever, fast knowledgeable, kind.  All the food was amazing, hot, tasty, and yummy.  I love my club membership, which brought me here today instead of sushi, or another restaurant.  I would ask for this server again.   I have been here several times since this location opened.  It's been great food every time.  I had a burger and the rest of my party had a personal pizza.  Thank You! John and BJ's.  :)"
Ryan R.,"Pinon Hills, CA",64,10,2,4.0,6/4/2017,"Really loved this place but when I found out they could not give me unlimited soup and salad on a weekend not even if they just raised it up a couple dollars they will literally not even allow me to order it. I understand it's that on special, but usually special will just cost more on weekends. I would have been fine with that. Very disappointing. Also disappointing they used to have the best shoestring french fries now they have these natural cut funky Fry's. I recently returned the french fries are still not the thin cut to string. However, the manager allowed me to get the unlimited soup and salad being that I only have one day off a week from work and unfortunately it's either Saturday or Sunday I really appreciate their accommodation."
Rebeca K.,"San Diego, CA",0,19,2,5.0,8/19/2017,"Came for a Bloody Mary today and had THE best server! Lexi was spectacular, so kind and helpful! Her cheery personality was so accommodating and started my sister and off to a great day! I will definitely be coming back again!"
Ashley C.,"Hesperia, CA",0,6,,3.0,8/12/2017,"They have some great dishes and the PB Smore pizookie can't be beat, unfortunately service and product have slowly declined since they've opened."
Brandell H.,"Camp Pendleton North, CA",0,1,,3.0,3/25/2017,"The chips and guac appetizer was more of a chips and avocado failed to be mashed up. The salsa I thought was good but my date said it was similar to Taco Bell sauce and not good at all. Ordered a deep dish pizza, my date found and chewed on a piece of plastic which is unfortunate BUT the manager was very courteous and the pizza was on him plus a free desert. The second pizza took 15+ min to come out and at that time I wasn't even hungry. Desert - monkey bread pizookie was amazing.  Overall, I understand mistakes happen and I'm not one to over exaggerate, it was a good dining environment! I'd give them another try"
Diane R.,"Hesperia, CA",0,12,5,2.0,7/14/2017,"Slow service, got there 15 mins after it opened. Hardly anyone there. Soup salty as heck. Flatbread awful...marguerite fresco.  Refill on tea didn't bring ice. Waitress said pass the plates down...rather than serve everyone on both sides of table. Squished our large party into a booth. Girl at front one of hostesses didn't seem like she wanted to be there.   Probably not going back...should have gone to chilis."
Nancy A.,"Ontario, CA",29,14,1,2.0,11/4/2017,Came in today and they sat us really quick. It all started off great. We are a family of 5 with three boys under 7. The first server was really friendly and she put in complementary fruit and garlic knots for the kids and she took our order. We specifically asked for the spinach and artichoke dip and wings before our pizza. In 5 minutes the pizza was out and then after the appetizers. She apologized but that was no big deal. Then she said she was leaving and another young lady was going to take care of us. Yet she never left even when we left so idk. We ordered 3 pizookies and after I did the mobile pay and they never mentioned she was going to give us a complementary pizookie for what had happened before. So then she told us she would be right back and give us a coupon. We waited 15 minutes. A free pizookie is not worth that much of a wait and we ended up just leaving. Overall the staff is friendly but not trustworthy of what they say. Food was a 3 stars. Pizza  was great but the spinach dip the cheese was burned and the wings were overly seasoned. Not the best experience for a BJs. I'll just stick to rancho and West Covina for a better experience.
Richard M.,"Adelanto, CA",4,25,26,2.0,12/5/2016,"My family and I ate at BJ's last Saturday, we were a party of six - 4 adults and 2 kids. The waitress took about 10 minutes from the time she took our drink order until the time she came back with our drinks. At one point during those 10 minutes, another waiter came by and almost gave us pizza that belonged to a different table.  When the food finally came -- actually it didn't all come out at once, five out the six orders came out then maybe 10 minutes later the final time (Soup) came out -- we could not eat since we were not given utensils or napkins. We also did not get crayons with the kids menus.  Overall customer service was lacking, I only got one refill during my meal and I was finished with my drink for about 15-20 minutes before the waitress came to the table  The food was decent, but I'm not sure if I'd voluntarily go back -- maybe only for drinks or something."
Aaron A.,"Victorville, CA",46,33,48,5.0,6/19/2016,"I've decided to give this place a better review. We came yesterday to celebrate my wife's Master's Degree and the service and good was amazing. We were a party of 7 and the experience was fantastic. Everyone got their drinks and food very quick and our waitress, Krissy was amazing. She was extremely friendly and genuinely cared about making sure we had a fantastic experience. Everyone loved their food. From the seafood tacos, chicken Alfredo, burgers, chicken strips to the salmon - it was all great! Although I previously complained that their menu was huge, it appears that they can cook that menu well. They have a huge selection of beers and soda. The place is very big inside and they can seat a lot of people in there. I recommend you join their reward program. After you do that you can put yourself on their preferred seating list. This lets you put up to 6 people in line so when you get there your wait is not that long, because this place can get insanely busy. You can even place your order ahead of time so as soon as the hostess seats you the kitchen will immediately fire your order Lastly, before we left Krissy brought my father-in-law and I, a father's day glass and a 20% off coupon, even though father's day was today. I have to say that was pretty amazing. Well done BJ's, well done!"
Mark J.,"Victorville, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/14/2017,"ROACHES!!!!! Stay away from this location.  I've came to this location numerous times and have spent a lot of money here and due to last nights tragedy I will never be back!  First, my party of 8 called ahead early in the day and made a reservation. Upon arrival we were told there was no reservation made!!!! Being our whole party was there we decided to wait it out. Drinks at the bar went off without a hitch and finally sat down at our table. After being pawned off by multiple waiters after three the fourth one finally became our server.  During our ordering the waiter tried to signal quietly there was a bug. The bug was a ROACH crawling over my back to my arm and ended up on the table on top of the food and who knows where it went from there. After being told by the waiter they spray for bugs weekly and apologizing the manger came to the table and said this has never happened and he's never seen roaches there before, (after his waiter clearly just stated they spray for bugs on a weekly basis). The manager refused to do anything but offer half off our meal. Drinks of course we were willing to pay for but being charged for any sort of food is ridiculous.  Stay away from this place and a health inspection needs to happen asap! Entire situation was handled very unprofessionally."
Caylie G.,"Hesperia, CA",34,4,1,5.0,8/25/2017,We came on a Friday night and the wait was long as to be expected but we were told an hour and it ended up only being 45 minutes which was nice. Our wait for food was not long at all and our server Tico was really awesome and knowledgeable! Food was great as well!
Alex A.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,21,14,3.0,11/26/2016,I forgot to add that the parking is totally inadequate given the popularity of the joint. We often end up parking in the dirt berm south of the lot just to be close to the entrance.
Larry R.,"Pinon Hills, CA",0,3,,3.0,8/10/2017,"Had a great time until we got our food. My wife had a black Hair on her plate and we told our waitress about it. The manager came over and apologized about the problem and brought her another one. We would have thought that the manager would have offered a small desert or something. Nothing...I was shocked since I use to work in the restaurant industry, But I guess they don't do that anymore..."
Bill M.,"Hesperia, CA",68,7,1,1.0,5/11/2017,Pathetic got a hair in my food. Didn't even eat but a few bites of my steak . Sent it back after seeing the hair in it. Didn't want anything else that's just disgusting to me . Never heard from or saw any one from management . All I got was 4$ off the bill. Paid for food that was in eatable . Sorry excuse for management.
LaTisha D.,"Victorville, CA",1,3,1,1.0,3/3/2017,So I'm sitting here at Bj's which is usually really good food. I order the pulled pork sandwich and there was a piece of cardboard in my coleslaw...
Jessie A.,"San Diego, CA",50,117,70,1.0,4/5/2016,Just got off from work after a long day with a few coworkers. We decided to make an order for curbside pickup and just eat at my friends house. The email confirmation said to call the number when we pulled up. We called and they informed us curbside was no longer available. This was annoying because the whole point was to not get out of the car. When the hostess was going over the order I noticed it was messed up. She then argued with me about what I ordered. Instead of having them fix the order because I was in a hurry I just asked for a side of buffalo sauce for the wings. The hostess brought me the sauce and when I asked for ranch she said she put it in the bag. When we got home she didn't put the lid on the container and the buffalo sauce spilled all over our food and there was no ranch in the bag. Thanks BJs!
Elena M.,"Adelanto, CA",209,20,4,4.0,6/9/2017,"Always enjoy eating here. Their seafood is exceptional & their pizookies can satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. It is usually packed here, but the host/ hostesses seat you fairly quick."
Nancy F.,"San Diego, CA",128,599,308,4.0,11/18/2016,"This is the first time I have been to this BJ's and what a fun location.  It was far bigger than the last BJ's I had been to, and that made it easy to get a table.  They have a ton of taps too.  They carry other breweries on top of their own beers, so it makes for a great selection.  We had a pizza and it was cooked to perfection.  No complaints here.  Service was friendly. Their in house IPA was really top notch.  We will be back."
Nancy T.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,7,,3.0,8/4/2017,"Service was good, the pizza looked amazing but it was a bit soggy for my taste. I ordered the pan pizza  maybe next time I'll order the thin crust. I will be back to try it again. I feel like it is always packed and busy but  the staff really makes you feel welcomed."
April L.,"Apple Valley, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/26/2017,"Since my first review I have been back to BJ's numerous times and have had nothing but positive experiences. The food has been fabulous and the service outstanding!!!!!! Everything has been prepared just as it should be, the servers are friendly, professional, and highly efficient. I'm so thrilled to leave this 5 Star update as this is a fav spot for my husband and I and we are beyond delighted to have one so close to home. Keep up the awesome job BJ's Victorville, you guys rock!!!!!!"
