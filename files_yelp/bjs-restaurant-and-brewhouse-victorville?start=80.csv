Joanne S.,"Hesperia, CA",49,51,36,4.0,6/20/2017,Went in for Father's Day and had a delicious lunch or server was great she recommended the portobello burger and it was fantastic.  I have been getting the jerry burst lately it's delicious I would highly recommend it Had the peanut butter Smore's bouzouki that was the bomb I can definitely say we were for
Edgar S.,"Victorville, CA",9,39,1,1.0,10/7/2016,"Don't even know where to start. Had a horrible experience. We were a party of seven, we all ordered  food which came out at a reasonable time.  Our waitress offered us bazookis, she's stated they were free that day "" she said by the way it's free bazookie day"" so we all ordered a bazookie desert. When our bill came she charges us for six of them. When I asked her about the mistake on our check she stated "" you only get one bazookie for free"" I felt so mislead and manipulated I felt like she just wanted a higher percentage for her Tip by having a higher bill. I asked her why she told us it was free? She didn't have an answer she said "" I meant just one"" . What a rip off and what a set up. She didn't even have he audacity to come back to our table afterwards. We had to get help from another waiter to get to go boxes and close out our check. . I'd rather go to OGs in Applevalley it's much better."
Harley C.,"Victorville, CA",0,22,3,5.0,1/5/2017,"So I should start out by mentioning that this review is slightly biased by the fact that I work at a neighboring restaurant, so perhaps I'm slightly more forgiving than other reviewers. But overall the experience was 5 stars. It probably helped that I called ahead and it was just for two. The call ahead system is excellent. We were even sat early despite the fact it was Saturday night and it was packed. Cozy 2 top table for just my wife and I. I've heard from others that the quality of your experience is dependent on your server. Ours was fine. Unfortunately I don't remember her name. Not overly attentive but she didn't ignore us either.  Now the food and drink: my wife ordered something fruity I don't remember what it was but she liked it. I got a house IPA. It's decent but they have better ones. No matter what you can't beat having a place in the high desert with an actual decent beer selection. We ordered pizza. It's a pizza joint. Get a pizza. Came out in a timely fashion and was delicious as I expected. Their pizza is quality. For dessert we got the lemon white chocolate pizza. That's where I knocked a star off. It was kinda disappointing. Tasted good but was doughy in the middle and hard on the edges.  Overall in my opinion people are being a little hard on this location in their reviews. It's new. Of course there's gonna be issues. New restaurants always struggle for a bit til they weed out the weak staff. Give them a chance if you want some decent pizza and beer.  Update: this is a regular spot for my wife and I now. As well as coworkers. Drinks are good. Happy hour is awesome. The lemon pepper bone in wings are the best thing ever."
Jennifer W.,"Ontario, CA",0,8,,3.0,7/31/2017,"I've never had issues with the bar service generally its a man and hes always been wonderful. The female waitresses not so much. I've been there on several occasions where they've forgotten to bring something whether its a side order or refilling my drink. They walk up and interrupt you to ask if you need anything instead of waiting politely I mean i teach my children not to interrupt people in conversation to say excuse me or just wait. So when a waitress is constantly doing this when I'm trying to enjoy conversation with a friend it gets very irritating and not to say its not polite. That being said i do ""tolerate"" the service for the delicious food."
Kim W.,"Victorville, CA",40,10,1,5.0,7/8/2017,Just had the most incredible server for lunch. Victor was so upbeat and friendly! Not to mention a fabulous server! It's rare to experience this these days. Great job Victor. As a side note...the cauliflower pita tacos are wonderful.
D C.,"Victorville, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/19/2017,"Not worthy of any stars. Dirty , rushy, poor food quality. Will not be back. I ordered what they specialize in ""pizza"" and it was the worst dryest pizza I've ever had. No thank you..."
Virginia M.,"Victorville, CA",45,20,20,2.0,5/25/2017,"Just popped in for a birthday dessert after a very good dinner someplace else. ""Famous"" pizzookie calling our names, and all.  Hostess and waitress pleasant enough. But for whatever reason (none was offered) it took them 40 minutes just to tell us ""oops."" Really? So here we sit, still waiting... Aha! Finally got it after 50 minutes."
Kimberly R.,"Victorville, CA",0,3,1,3.0,6/19/2017,"Server was nice, atmosphere was cool, crowded for Father's day but not a long wait which was great! However....The food was subpar to say the least. I'm not sure if it was because they were busy but I've been to BJ's in different areas during busy hours & was very satisfied with the food. We ordered the sampler appetizer....The spinach artichoke dip was white but not cheesy white,  a creamy unappetizing white! The wings were under cooked & the avocado rolls were tasteless.  When we received our meals I had to send my plate right back! It wasn't what I ordered! When they returned with my second plate it still wasn't correct but I sucked it up & tried to eat it anyway. Needless to say we all received cold food! I'm not sure what the issue was on 6/18/17 but it was not a good experience as far as dinner was concerned.  Of course they did do well with their famous pzookie, guess they can't go wrong with that ...."
William D.,"Hesperia, CA",94,29,11,4.0,5/7/2016,"I loved the Alabama sunset drinks and my bbq apatizer.  The bbq was sweet and spicy.  The kick was perfect for my taste. It came with an ample salad that included cabbage, onion, cilantro and carrots.  The chicken sandwich has Applewood smoked bacon,  avocado mayo and havarti cheese.  It was rather bland for my taste and the cheese didn't do it for me but my pallet is very narrow with cheeses.  The fries were hot and about what I expected.  Our server (Ashley R.) did a great job.  What I generally dislike most about this BJ's is the floors always feel slick.  Not quite slippery but slick."
Felix V.,"Victorville, CA",2,20,6,1.0,6/15/2017,"Very Disappointed service was so slow and when we finally did get out orders they were wrong, our server was MIA and the person helping her wasn't even listening  to us asked for Parmesan and chile pepper flakes  didn't get them till I was almost done asked for diet refill after my glass was sitting there empty and then I got the refill wrong again... oh! But when it came time for the ticket it was there almost instantly!   I know they are better than that but you need to teach your servers to listen !!! Bad thing about it it wasn't  even busy"
Aaron D.,"Hesperia, CA",42,14,8,1.0,5/19/2017,Service was awful and the food was just thrown together. I get it's a chain restaurant but the other BJ's I have been to have had better quality food and service. This one is just off.
Sharon G.,"Lucerne Valley, CA",674,42,64,5.0,3/18/2017,"I just have to say I tried their mahi mahi with shrimp.  If you are a fish eater and you like bold flavors, this is the dish for you.  It came in a bowl with broth that had all kinds of flavors going on from capers to Kalamata olives and a spicy but not hot seasoning.  Absolutely delicious."
Laci C.,"Melbourne, FL",1,48,17,3.0,4/4/2017,Good food. Good portions. Priced a little high for the quality. Service has been good everytime I've been there. It's basically Chili's on steroids.
JK C.,"Helendale, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/12/2017,"This restaurant is good but over-rated. Their prices are high and portions are moderate. They focus on being hip and trendy but the food seems like less of a priority. I'm not saying the food is bad, but it doesn't equal the hype. Servers are average and seem hyped and in a rush even when it's not busy. Disappointed and I would much prefer to go to other restaurants in the area."
Stephanie L.,"Daggett, CA",45,12,1,1.0,6/30/2017,It was to good to be true ... I came here when they had business ... waited over an our with unfriendly staff.. my kids were getting cranky because we waited over an hour .. anyways as I was waiting low and behold there were empty tables everywhere ! The table they finally sat us at ... was empty the whole time we were waiting . I work in the restaurant business and let me tell you ... we cram people to be seated ! Never again will I come back
Kenneth L.,"Barstow, CA",1,12,4,1.0,6/30/2017,Slow unfriendly service waited over an hour to be seated . They seemed confused and unsure of what they were doing . By the time we were seated our experience was pretty much ruined
Bev H.,"Adelanto, CA",0,9,6,1.0,5/14/2017,This was our time to this BJs and it was NOT GOOD. Our waitress was great very friendly and helpful but the food was NOT GOOD at all.  Salmon dish wasn't tasteful & the ribs were tough. We won't be eating here again.
Ryan S.,"Victorville, CA",7,16,4,4.0,4/7/2017,Happy hour 1/2 off pizza and discounted appetizers are a must. Our server was very attentive.
Lina M.,"San Bernardino, CA",44,12,,1.0,12/1/2017,"Came today to bjs I come here frequently, and never have I had the the service I have had today I was so upset because this is a regular spot for my husband and I but after the service my husband, I, and our friends received I don't believe I will be coming back we sat  in the bar the waitress we had at first wish I got her name was lovely, then we where handed off to another woman with dark hair and a star tattoo on her hand. So rude so rude. First off my friend had ordered a beer and she slams the beer on the table and says don't know who ordered this and walks away with the worst attitude she made faces when we asked for things it got so bad to the point another young lady came to bring us some drinks I asked if she would please be our waitress because the lady that was serving us was so rude. She said okay and took care of us for the rest of the night she was lovely she had glasses. Sweet heart. At one point I look up and our old waiter was making faces and looking directly at us like she was speaking about us. SO RUDE. Later on In our visit our old waitress dropped off some beer to our table and said two coors set them down with a sarcastic attitude to add insult to injury. This was so unprofessional we come here frequently we are loyal customers. But honestly with how we where treated I doubt I will be coming back. It's upsetting because we normally have great waitresses and that's one of the main reasons we keep coming back as well as the food is great I hope no one has the experience  I had. It was terrible. You lost a loyal customer.  (Update) so I got an email from the manager he explained how he was so sorry that's not how they want there service to be etc. I told him it was fine he was very apologetic so he offers me a gift card I never asked for one but I thought it was a kind thing to do  and excepted it's been a MONTH and I never received it lol. I have all the emails. So they said sorry offered a apology gift card and then never sent it.. that's crazy. So yeah never going back stands."
Angel R.,"Victorville, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/22/2017,I just left this place. Took them 30 mins to get some water! We asked to cancel our order and the waitress took 20 mins to give us the bill for 2 sodas. This is ridiculous.  I would understand if it was busy but she only had about 2 other tables. Will not come back here again. Moat disappointing customer service I've had  in the high desert.
