Denise S.,"McLean, VA",0,96,56,4.0,12/30/2017,"We really like BJs. This is one of our go to places near our house. It's a great place to watch a game, but if it's a big game, get there early or make a reservation, or it will be hard to get seated.  The menu is large, varied, Americana. Always something for everyone on this type of menu. I specifically like the pot stickers, rib appetizer, and nacho flatbread. Pizookies, their version of skillet cookie dessert, which come in many flavors... Yummy!! Definitely get it! The staff is friendly and helpful. They don't always know the answer, but they go and ask. We like the rewards system and the technology they use. We have the BJs app on our phones. When you arrive at the host stand you scan your rewards number in. Then your server already knows you are a rewards member and can see what rewards you have available to use that visit. Redeeming rewards is super easy and the server will do it before bringing your check if you ask.  I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons. Usually they make mistakes. I haven't gone down to 3 stars because the staff is really accommodating and the food is very tasty. Even if they have to fix mistakes, which should not happen, the food you get is really good. The other thing is the cocktails are not always made with fresh ingredients. I do not like when any restaurant uses something like Rose's lime juice, or any other mixer with preservatives, instead of fresh limes. I am a mojito person and I do not want a mojito made with a mixer, or something preserved with sulfites. Note: if you have a sulfite allergy, as I do, you cannot have the ginger beer they use here. It has sulfites. On two different occasions when asking about fresh lime juice versus rose's (or the like) I got two different answers. So double check if you have dietary issues.  We will return again and again, and I would recommend to friends."
Allison W.,"Manassas, VA",91,64,43,1.0,12/17/2017,"The crispy flatbread nachos are pretty good and I loved the fries. My friend and I tried the Gold Medal and the Dark Side flight of beer. My favorite was the Brunette from the Dark Side flight. Overall, pretty good food and beer, unfortunately I cannot give this place a higher rating because of the poor service that I received.  My friend had made a reservation for 20 people, and I understand it was a large table, and they would be busy. Our flights came out fast and my friends pizookie came out in a couple minutes. But the nachos and the fries took an hour. The two of us were not getting a full meal because we had to leave the party a little early. I had to flag down our server an hour in to check on the status of my nachos (which I'd expect to come out quick because it was an appetizer!). When he came back he told me it had come out 3 times and no one claimed it. I don't know where they were calling this but I did not hear this at all! And we were not that loud! They must have not even bothered to walk around the table--I sat at the center! I did hear them call once for nachos (and some cauliflower) but it was for someone who was not even at our table. My server said they threw it away and it would take another ten minutes for it come out. And he told me that next time I should listen more carefully (!!!???). I was not at the bar, I was sitting at a table, and this seemed like a sit down restaurant where I should not have to be chasing down my food. We also asked about the fries and received an ""Oh yeah"" and it came out immediately, no apology.  And all this time, we asked for water 5 times to several different servers and never received it. It was not so much a big deal for me because I had beer, but my friend who was not drinking really wanted it. With all the problems we were having and the fact we had to leave soon, we gave up on the water. I know it was a large table but we had a reservation, management should have staffed appropriately for a busy night, and I feel water is something that should be offered as you walk around the tables and see some people do not have water or their glasses are empty."
Melissa M.,"Blacksburg, VA",167,19,9,4.0,12/9/2017,"I love brewery/restaurant combos so I was really excited to try BJs. They have quite a variety of in house beers along with guest/outside beers. Their food is ""American"", but takes inspiration from other cuisines. I couldn't choose because they have such a variety: Salads, burgers, chicken, fish, steak, flatbreads, deep dish pizza. The list goes on.  I got a flight and a pint. The flight was worth it, in my opinion, especially because they have so many beers. The bar area includes booths so if you like to hit happy hour it is a comfy place to do that with great prices on their house crafted beer. The food all sounded so amazing. My boyfriend called his dish ""chicken amazingness"" while BJs called it ""Parmesan Crusted Chicken"". And the taste really was amazing. However, the plating of this dish was disappointing to say the least. He had a huge helping of food and they made it look like nothing by stacking the chicken on top of his sides. This also resulted in some of the crusting coming off, which my boyfriend didn't mind, but a good restaurant would avoid doing. I originally ordered the ""Lemon Thyme Chicken"", but it came out basically as a rice soup because there was so much sauce. I then switched my order to the Blackened Alaskan Salmon and was not disappointed. The sauce was great and the salmon was cooked well.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend the beer, but would likely go back for appetizers or more simple dishes as the kitchen staff seems a little careless. Additionally the wait staff was extremely attentive and understanding!"
Courtney B.,"Washington, DC",223,315,221,4.0,9/24/2017,"What a pleasant surprise! I was out shopping with a friend and we were running low on steam and needed a bite. I was worried about where we'd go since she has dietary restrictions (gluten free, etc). After finishing up at Nordstrom Rack, we ran into BJ's to see what their GF opts were, and honestly I wasn't expecting much - boy, was i wrong! They had lots of options and even had a dietary restrictions menu that breaks everything down! They also have a delish GF hard cider!  The staff was super friendly and accommodating, especially our server. My friend had the bacon guacamole burger on a GF bun and I had the seared ahi tuna on a salad - both of which were great! While I don't get to this area often, I will be back. Cheers!"
Candice H.,"Williamsburg, VA",17,121,82,4.0,8/19/2017,"As an experienced Yelper, when confronted with such an expansive menu, I look to yelp reviews.  Yelp reviews were high and low, so I looked at the high ratings. Based on those, I picked a burger. (Bacon Guacamole, added fried jalapeños) Between the five of us, our party had 2 salads, 2 burgers, and 1 fish and chips.  My bacon guacamole burger (lettuce wrap) with fried jalapeños was the perfect level of spiciness, and had great flavor.  Our server Luke was prompt, polite and attentive."
Meredith V.,"Alexandria, VA",275,825,463,4.0,10/18/2017,"This place completely reminds me of Blackfinn. In fact, when I first walked in I thought I was IN Blackfinn. American style pub, variety of eats and drinks, classic rock/cool tunes. Still a cool gig, perhaps lacking a bit of originality is all. Parking in the underground garage with an elevator that has a BJs button. Much appreciated for the parking tards, like myself.  They have a nice selection of wines actually, not just a standard KJ Chardonnay. Don't normally see Hess Select on the list so that was nice. Generous pours. I ended up getting the tuna poke app, which had a lot of abundant, fresh sushi-grade tuna. Overall, lots of working folk here, business lunches, happy hours. Kind of the standard gig over in Tysons. But it's a great meeting spot with good food and large pours."
薇薇,"Burke, VA",6,33,68,5.0,10/29/2017,"If you like eating salmon, you should try their cherry salmon.  It's so amazing. Sauce is really special."
Amber K.,"Alexandria, VA",118,382,42,4.0,11/12/2017,"I really love the pizookie here. Their drinks are ok too. Everything else is just ok, I've not had anything off the menu that I found amazing. We've always had great service at this location though. Free parking is a plus."
Eat Out L.,"Chantilly, VA",0,11,9,3.0,10/1/2017,"Food in general was ok. Not enough servers to handle Sunday business. Disappointed with the presentation of the Monkey Bread Pizookie (the menu and website pictures look so much better), but the taste was good."
Jesse C.,"Fairfax, VA",396,123,641,4.0,1/25/2017,"Nice restaurant with an extremely diverse menu to choose from, as there are endless menu items to choose from like pizza, to sandwiches, salad, seafood, and etc.  The first thing I noticed is that the bar is insane.  The layout of the restaurant is nice and very open. For my entree I got the New Orleans Jambalaya, which I would say was fair, and not extraordinary.  I would say that what made it not so appealing was that the dish was far too salty, as I was chugging water to compensate.  I wish there was more of a cajun taste to dish instead of pure sodium.  The dessert was the highlight of the mean as I got the Triple Chocolate Pizookie.  Man, I love me some cookies and ice cream and this dessert was exactly what I needed to satisfy my sweet tooth.  You get a nice warm cookie topped with a scoop of chocolate Ice cream, and on top of it, you get a nice drizzle and I think extra chocolate chips.  Great dessert, but I want to try all of the pizookies."
C H.,"Laurel, MD",0,11,,4.0,12/17/2017,When I lived in Laurel I will come here all the time. They even offer movie ticket discounted movie tickets when you pay for your food not sure if it's just the one in Laurel since there's a movie theater right in the same Shopping Center. The food is good the drinks are good. Sometimes it takes a little while to get seated but that's what the whole purpose of the Parts Program is for you can go ahead and get put on the waiting list ahead of time. I'll be back
Taylor W.,"Fort Pierce, FL",35,31,35,5.0,6/21/2017,"I'm a Floridian on vacay to DC and stayed in a hotel nearby. The location is great for close to shopping and major highways. The decor is classy but inviting - it looks more expensive than it is. It's higher priced than a typical chain restaurant but the service was good - Mike was our server - and drinks stayed full. The Soba Noodle Chicken dish is very filling and on the spicy side. Not over cooked and was full of flavor. The sirloin steak my sister ordered didn't last 10 minutes so it must have been pretty good. Cooked to order - medium. My boyfriend had the Shrimp jumbalaya dish , very good !  Liquor isn't cheap , my captain/sprite cost about 8$ a glass and happy hour took a dollar off my first one.  Overall pretty good and if I lived here I would be visiting probably monthly or so.  We highly recommend the calamari !!!"
Erin B.,"Highland, MD",43,182,103,2.0,4/5/2017,"As a BJ's aficionado (and current Duchess of BJ's Brewhouse in Columbia MD), I expect the best from each establishment of this chain, but the Vienna location is a let down. The key here: their service is awful. We came at 5 pm on a Saturday to a moderately filled restaurant, and I found myself flagging our server down every step of the meal (ordering drinks, food, asking for more napkins, getting the check). His inattentiveness really ruined the evening, which was a college girls reunion. We might have stayed longer and run up the check had we actually had decent service! Food is good as usual. I actually think I liked the siracha brussels sprouts better here than Columbia, but I'll stick to my usual locale."
Sam L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",128,458,718,3.0,6/28/2017,"BJ is and will continue to be one of those places where food cost a little bit extra for the atmosphere, and not for the execution of taste or portion size.  Coming here with a friend for a soccer match, the bar area is no doubt one of their main attractions. With plenty of beer on tap and happy hour specials, it's easy to see why BJ's is a mainstay in the Tysons/Vienna area. The only recommendation I would make is to eat elsewhere and then come to BJ's. The food really is pretty disappointing, even though the menu is vast and supersized."
Aarti B.,"McLean, VA",153,341,2001,4.0,4/7/2017,"A nice sports bar with good happy hour deals (3-7 Mon-Fri) with some tasty finger food and friendly service. Here are my recommendations on what's worth ordering and what to skip. - Cocktails: SKIP. Alabama cocktail and Whiskey Sour were a bit too sugary. Don't expect to get artisanal cocktails.  - BJ's Berry Cider - Worth it. On the sweet side, but enjoyed the cider and brewed in-house. - Crispy brussel sprouts - Worth it. Nice and crispy, but not greasy.  - Avocado egg rolls - SKIP.  Not my favorite, too many avocados were stuffed inside. - Mini Deep Dish Pizza - SKIP.  Just not that tasty, a notch below Pizza Hut. - Pizookies - Worth it. BEST part of the meal, you can't go wrong with any of the flavors, they even do 1/2 and 1/2. My favorite are chocolate chunk, followed by triple chocolate, and monkey bread.  Non-Happy Hour Food Worth Ordering - Turmeric Roasted Cauliflower: Great flavor with lentils, nuts, and spices. - Salads: Salads at a sports bar? They are surprisingly quite tasty. I got a summer brussel sprouts salad with blueberries, nuts, and goat cheese. Overall, I recommend doing a blend of happy hour and non-happy items to get the most value from your meal. Next time I come here, I know exactly what I'll get it: BJ's Berry Cider, brussel sprouts, Turmeric Roasted Cauliflowe, and a salad (to make up for the rest of the meal), and of course PIZOOKIE.  As a tip, download the mobile BJ's app, and you'll save $10 if you spend $35 (which you'll easily be able to do!)"
Kristie A.,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",94,258,952,3.0,2/24/2017,"Good place for happy hour with coworkers! I was in Vienna for two straight weeks for work and my coworkers and I came here a couple of times for happy hour. The first time I came here, we only ordered their appetizers since they were all half off. We had their chicken wings, ribs, and their pizzas. All were pretty decent. Nothing great but it wasn't terrible either. You cannot beat the price. So if you're not too picky, this place is a great place to hang out after work! I came back here with my coworkers during happy hour again but this time, I ordered their deep dish pizza. I had the mini size and trust me, it's enough! It was also on their happy hour so it was half off! I had their BJ's favorite and it wasn't bad. It will definitely fill you up! My coworkers order different cocktails everytime we came here and they all said they were good. I stuck with their own brewed beers and the ones I had were pretty decent.  I had their hefeweizen and light switch- both were not bad!  Service is great! So if you're looking for a fun little happy hour place, definitely check this place out!"
Victoria L.,"Herndon, VA",491,534,912,1.0,1/22/2017,"Today's visit was the worst visit I've ever had and honestly makes me not want to come back. I haven't been back to this BJ's for probably over a year. Our waiter Angelo F., was fine in the beginning, he came and got our drink order right away. Then...when he came back a few minutes to drop off the appetizer, which was the most bland spinach dip I've ever had, I asked him to come back in 2 minutes for our entrees. 2 minutes go by...nothing, 5 minutes...nothing...10 minutes later we were getting annoyed. When I look around, I see him on his phone at the far corner of the restaurant. Yes on his phone!!!! Seriously dude this is where you've been for the past 10 minutes? We grabbed another waiter who I think might have been a manager and he grabs him. There was a huge table of like 8-9 who was also his table who he never went to get drinks from. Then another table came who tried to flag him down and he never came to them. He finally came to ours and got our orders. It took them almost 30-35 minutes to bring entrees, which made us even more annoyed! Then when the entrees came out, my order was wrong. I told him a small pizza, they bring out a mini. So now I'm waiting another 15 minutes for a damn pizza. My fiance and mom got the brisket and bacon burger and both burgers come out extra well done with extra charcoal on the bottom, it was burnt! It was hard to even eat with the bacon on it because the smell and flavor of the burnt patty was so strong. I told my fiance to send it back but he knew it would have taken another 20 minutes and he was already hangry (hungry and angry). When I asked for a refill, it took our server another 10 mins for my sweet tea to come out, which I'm sitting there with no drink for 10 minutes.  Overall, the whole experience was an absolute disappointment. Was there only 1 chef in the back?? It really takes 30 mins to make 2 burgers, meatballs and spaghetti and chicken pizza?? Either there was only 1 chef or all of those cooks were slow. Might I add the restaurant wasn't even busy, only the bar area was but not dining area. I honestly could not believe we paid $100 for this disappointing food and crappy service. Angelo only had a few tables maybe 3-4 because there were a few other waiters there. If you can't handle a few tables, then the restaurant business isn't for you. BJ's need to teach their employees better customer service and how to not be on your phone for 10 minutes when you have guests waiting. And maybe the cooks need to learn how to cook correctly and NOT burn the food before serving customers. Just get a George Foreman grill if you don't know how to cook a patty."
Josh E.,"Plano, TX",72,276,14,1.0,1/3/2017,"We've been to BJs probably dozens of times and usually had a good experience, but I guess they just had to say, ""better put an end to that and give them one really awful one!"" On May 15, 2016, for the third time, we brought a large group of guests to BJs to try and have an enjoyable celebration for my fiancee's graduation. At some point during the meal, a server spilled iced tea on my future-mother-in-law's cocktail dress, drenching her; the rest of the meal was not enjoyable as a result, and she did not bring a change of clothes, and was forced to fly back to Boston, still soaked. I get it, it happens. I don't hold anything against the server. It was an innocent mistake, but how BJs has chosen to resolve it - or not - is what really grinds my gears. The restaurant referred us to their ""Risk Management"" team in California to get the dry cleaning paid for - ""Michelle Hayden"" was assigned to our case. Ms. Hayden proceeded to ask for pedantic documentation, including a copy of the dry cleaning bill, some arbitrary forms BJs invented to make fixing this issue a pain in the rear, and a legal release form that only an attorney could understand. Ultimately, the dry cleaning did NOT remove the stain, so we've asked for replacement value for the dress. It's just a $50 dress from TJMaxx, not a big deal. It is to BJs, though! They still refuse to accept responsibility and demand pictures of the stain not coming out (the dry cleaner through the dress away at our request) and the original receipt from when the dress was purchased (years ago). It's looking like this matter will end up having to go to Fairfax Small Claims Court because BJs simply does not want to own up to their mistake and make us whole. We're talking about $65 here, which is one dinner check, and they're attempting to make us go through all these unnecessary hoops and requiring excessive documentation to get it - their goal is probably to frustrate the crap out of us enough to never have to pay up! Very unethical and disappointing. It's not like we're claiming a Vera Wang dress and asking for $1,000 in reimbursement. Because of their total lack of business ethics, we will not be back. Go there at your own peril."
Kenny S.,"Arlington, VA",71,27,7,1.0,11/9/2017,Top pic shows Sliders on their menu. Bottom pic shows what you actually get. A burger patty cut in to 4 & no sign of grilled onions. Terrible & shameful. BJs should be embarrassed to even serve this.
Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",385,337,279,5.0,12/31/2016,"With fresh and delicious entree salads, creative uses of sriracha on salads and crispy Brussels sprouts, tasty California flatbread, and pizookies (cookie-pie combo in a cast iron pan), its no wonder BJs is on my ""go to"" list!   Despite being a chain restaurant, BJ's offers inspired and healthy creations made from quality fresh ingredients that keep bringing me back.  The new super salad with kale, romaine, Peruvian quinoa, sliced apples, blueberries, jicama, fresh sweet corn, asparagus, tomatoes, and apple cider vinaigrette is my absolute favorite item on the menu, followed by the kale and Brussels sprouts entree salad featuring lovely bits of tender chicken, crisp, piquant onion, salty pepita seeds, acidic and creamy goat cheese, sweet dried cranberries, and juicy purple grapes---all perfectly balanced with just the right amount of tangy dressing. It's truly a party in your mouth! Next on my go to list is the succulent California flat bread with bites of chicken, bacon, and avocado on warm, thin crust.  If comfort food's your thing, it's worth mentioning that this place has 5 different grilled cheese sammies. I love the bacon, avocado and havarti version and it pairs well with the chili! Yumm-o and fantastic when rain or snow come to town.  If healthful, savory offerings are not enough to bring you to BJ's, the dessert menu could make any patron smile with sugary delight. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler with sweet succulent peaches topped with flaky, warm crust. A close second is the pizookie, BJ's version of a deep dish baked cookie served still warm and soft in the middle and topped with ice cream.  The salted caramel variety would tempt even the staunchest dieter with its creamy, crisp, chewy, warm, frozen, cakey and sugary goodness all together."
Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",207,342,1805,3.0,6/7/2016,"There's a new sheriff in town at the Tysons BJ's - a new manager that's definitely turned customer service around. I've been to BJ's twice since my last review and, during both of those visits, she was constantly buzzing around the room, making sure things were going just right, stopping by to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. +1 star! I've also found a new go-to salad, BJ's Derby-style chicken cobb, featuring a nicely grilled chicken breast, a generous amount of smoked bacon (mmmm), avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, cukes, tomatoes, blue cheese, hard-boiled egg, all on romaine and served with a nice avocado ranch dressing. I had asked for the romaine to be chopped (like everything else in a classic cobb), but they missed that bit. This is a seriously large salad, and I took about a third of it home for lunch the next day. Now, if they can only get Apple Pay to work through the BJ's app, no luck on the last two visits... yeah, a minor inconvenience, but we boys like our toys!"
T S.,"Sterling, VA",0,8,,3.0,10/15/2017,The service isnt really great and the kitchen takes a while on your food. Great options for drinks and beers though.
Don S.,"Gwynn Oak, MD",1,1,,1.0,5/2/2017,"The service at this location was the WORST I've ever experienced.   With a 10 min wait for a table, my party of 3 decided to take a seat in the bar area (at a table) upon recommendation of the hostess.  We sat chatting for more than 15 min before we realized NOT ONE MEMBER OF THE STAFF had approached our table to say ""welcome, offer water, or a menu"". A hostess was notified who promptly took action giving us menus and dashing off to notify the appropriate server.  After another 15 min had passed without a first appearance from a server, I again approached the hostess informing her that STILL not one had come.  Additionally, my party took note the the guest ( who arrived AFTER we did)  seated at the table adjacent  to ours had been given drinks and placed a food order.  When server arrived we noted that he was the same server for the tables surrounding ours.  After placing drink orders which took an additional 10 min. to receive, we requested a manager, who apologized insincerely, offering an appetizer to make amends.  Food orders were placed, and again the long wait began. To make matters worse, the manager brought the food to our adjacent neighbors (mentioned above) as we continued to wait another 30 min without any interaction from the staff ( perhaps we wanted REFILLS).  At this point we had enough and decided to seek food elsewhere. Finding the THAI Restaurant next door we enjoyed an AMAZING experience with service and food!!!  My take on BJ's: Great place to bring food from elsewhere and watch the game on a big screen. The staff (including management) will NEVER notice."
B R.,"Falls Church, VA",139,25,31,5.0,2/19/2017,Went there tonight for my birthday.  Because of the reviews I was not expecting much.  Our server tonight was Rick.  Rick was on point with refills.  Cleaned table constantly.  The food was great!  I wish the was more tuna in the enlightened salad. Maybe on a busier day?  But we thoroughly enjoyed the service!
Zaria S.,"Arlington, VA",41,173,46,4.0,12/9/2016,"Not to shabby. A friend of mine took me here, he doesn't do pizza, but said the pizza here imparticilar is ""the best"" especially the deep dish. AND he said EVERY dish he's gotten here has been great. Granted, we didn't even get a pizza haha We sat at the bar, the bartender, introduced herself with a handshake, huge kudos on that. Of course I don't remember the bartenders name... I ordered the Brussel sprouts and kale salad, without the strawberries and goat cheese, and with the strawberry vinaigrette on the side (I'm weirdly  picky). It was yummy, and just packed with great healthy great things. I enjoyed every bite. My friend loved his dish too.. Generally a good place, you've got that basic yet satisfying variety,  fish, burgers and pizza.  I'd come back....sure :)"
Mafalda L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",240,146,1401,1.0,4/4/2016,"Man oh man, this was ridiculously bad - in a funny way! Decided to go here to watch the Cuse vs UNC Final Four game. All good here. So far.. The entire meal, no water refill - I actually had to refill it myself with my water bottle, which luckily I happened to have with me.  The ahi poke tuna had zero taste - zero. Had to pour a whole lot of salt and pepper on it. Not sure what sauce was supposed to be in it (since the menu specified some kind of sauce) but whatever it was, wasn't there. The burger was pretty good - super spicy for me - but that was my mistake as I ordered it with pepper jack cheese. Its combo with the spicy mayo made it sort of tough for me to eat. But I take responsibility for this one. Should have paid attention to the pepper jack on the menu. However, I asked for it medium rare and it came very, very, very well done.  As for the service, the lady was hilariously careless about her job duties and completely ignored our table the entirety of the meal (another gentleman actually brought us the food) except when we asked for the bill. She managed to walk by us five times in the five minutes we had the check next to us. Oh, and we didn't get to see the end of the game as the electricity went down twice during our meal (the storm was pretty bad, I'll give them that, but still, sort of strange that we had to be in the dark for a bit. No backups?) Anyway, pretty funny considering."
Stefan S.,"Fairfax, VA",239,465,116,5.0,10/13/2016,"Came to a dinner meeting and absolutely found a gem of a place to eat!  Quite an extensive menu both for drinks and food.  Lots of gluten free, low calorie, healthy foods.  Usually when I go out to eat I want to be bad because the healthy foods just aren't my cup of tea.  However, this place has really good tasting and sounding food on their menu and best of all, at least the entree, was very healthy.  It just sounded like a good combination - Mahi Mahi with a light rub with shrimp in a tomato based broth with orzo, tomatoes and spinach (I believe).  Nice, light, and really delicious.  Hadn't eaten much that day and was still hungry, so shared a not-so-healthy dessert with one of the people attending the meeting.  Had Pizookie trio, which is three warmed deep dish cookies with a scoop of ice cream on each one.  The person I was sharing with had a lactose issue, so we got the ice cream on the side.  Still though, dipping a scoop of cookie into the ice cream was fantastic and great way to finish off the meal.  Even splitting a trio, there was plenty to eat and it was very filling.  We chose the Triple chocolate, Cookies and Cream and the Salted Caramel as our three flavors.  How wonderful! I look forward to trying other food at this restaurant. Service was fantastic.  Even though there were about 20 of us, she took care of everything promptly, but also did bother us too many times and just let us sit and enjoy during our meeting time. The bathroom sinks at this place were of a really cool design.  I happen to notice the sink, as well as the classy tile designs on the wall. A+ for this meal.  I look forward to another visit soon, maybe to watch a sporting event while enjoying my meal.  Look forward to trying some of their special drinks as they looked amazing.  Give this place a try, I think you'll enjoy the wholesome and healthy food choices, as well as the extensive menu choices."
Caleh A.,"Waldorf, MD",0,4,,2.0,11/26/2017,We went on Black Friday . We were the first ones to get there when they opened at 11 . Food came out lukewarm had to send it back . Disappointed . I love the laurel location though won't be back to this one
David T.,"Fairfax, VA",141,16,3,3.0,10/19/2017,"I went for lunch with some coworkers and ordered a bacon burger. The food was edible, but it took a good 40 minutes or so for the food to come out after placing the order. My ""medium rare"" burger came out well done, but at least the fries were excellent."
Don M.,"Great Falls, VA",0,72,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Went to BJ's w/ the office (on my recommendation - no less!) a couple of weeks back.  Ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger MEDIUM WELL only to discover it was seared on the outside and totally raw on the inside.  Not rare, not medium rare, not medium, not even pink, but RAW.   Waitress offered to have the kitchen ""cook it some more,"" but I declined having lost my appetite. Blech! Was not charged for the burger and my colleagues did enjoy their meals though they could not believe a raw patty was actually served to me. I also declined their suggestion to take a picture of the uncooked patty (a bloody steak is one thing - but raw ground beef is another thing altogether). Not my style. Wonder what the kitchen staff/chef thought when it was brought to their attention? We'll never find out as I won't be returning to BJ's."
Key L.,"Richmond, VA",0,9,,2.0,5/16/2017,"Not a terrible restaurant. Good beer choices and friendly staff. The problem itself lies with the food and the back of house. We ordered Margherita flatbread and Chicken potstickers for apps. Flatbread was cold, but still good. The chicken potstickers were obviously purchased (which isn't bad..but dress it up a little)... My partner ordered the salmon with lemon and thyme butter sauce and fries, the sauce was broken, salmon over cooked , broccoli came out cold and the fries didn't arrive with the meal. Like I said, not terrible but not a place I would visit again. Considering the meal was 70 bucks"
tara l.,"Annandale, VA",0,18,1,5.0,4/26/2017,"5 stars for their Pizza, Beer, Cocktails, and Pazookie! 2 stars on ""other food"", stick to the pizza! Great happy hour deals too! 3pm-7pm, M-Fri"
Stephanie A.,"Springfield, VA",27,5,2,2.0,3/30/2017,"Service: horrible. We were a table of 20 but had 1 server! Food: mediocre (no presentation at all, taste non existent [cali pizza and sliders which btw the grilled onions are INSIDE the pizza and not on top *rolls eyes*]) Service: sloooowww Ambiance: Great It sucks that a good feel place with an amazing environment has the worst service and food."
Allie J.,"Fairfax, VA",79,43,71,2.0,8/13/2017,"My fiancé and I went here for dinner before going to a concert at Wolf Trap. I had only been to a BJ's brew house once before, and that was for a soft opening so they had a limited amount of choices.  When we walked in, there were three people at the hostess stand, and when I told them we had a party of two, they stared at us for a solid 10 seconds before acknowledging us or before they started to walk us to a table. It was as if we were being an inconvenience by deciding to dine there.  Our waitress dropped off our menus, took our drink order then came back, ""you ready to order yet??"". She didn't ask if we had any questions about the text book sized menu, didn't explain any happy hour specials, and when I said I was going to look at the drink menu, she didn't follow up with asking if I wanted a beer/cocktail.  We didn't see her again until our food came; I had a club sandwich and my fiancé had baked ziti. The food was served warm and delicious! Their French fries are the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Our waitress was nowhere to be found throughout our meal, a woman who was obviously dressed as the manager walked by our table several times and saw our empty glasses, but never came over to offer a refill. After finishing our meal and waiting for the waitress to come back, she didn't ask how our food was but rather said ""ready for the check?"".   At this point I was ready to just pay and leave, but we decided to have one of their famous pizookies. We got half salted caramel and half cookies and cream. Holy cookie deliciousness! Our waitress dropped off the dessert as well as the check. When we finished, she came over and paid our check at the table (one of my favorite features of BJ's; you see the transaction and your card never leaves your table). In the time she paid our check, the waitress didn't speak a single syllable. Then she walked away; no ""enjoy your evening"", no ""we hope you come back"", nothing.  Unfortunately, I had to lower my rating due to their poor customer service, but the food was very good! I plan to visit other BJ's brewhouses in hopes of more friendly employees."
Suma N.,"Tysons, VA",0,2,3,4.0,5/21/2017,"Had a great time at this brewery. Me, my husband and my one year old daughter went there to celebrate our anniversary. Menu has tons of options to pick from. We loved the food and so did my daughter .. I ordered the roasted cauliflower with turmeric for her and she ate half of it! The shrimp jambalaya was top class. We couldn't finish all the food , boxed it but sadly forgot to get the box home .."
Lynn P.,"Silver Spring, MD",48,19,15,2.0,3/4/2017,"Service was extremely slow but even worse, my salad was disgustingly soggy. So disappointed ... husband also got the appetizer sampler and the egg rolls were basically avocado mush on the inside.. surprised that hasn't been discontinued."
Hanna K.,"Annandale, VA",74,74,37,4.0,8/18/2017,The pizookie. A warm cookie with ice cream on top. There's just no way you could go wrong with that. I've had a couple of the pizzas here as well but nothing was as good as the pizzokie.
Jeff T.,"McLean, VA",129,80,68,1.0,12/21/2016,"Wish I could give different aspects different ratings. My review has dropped from a 4 to a 1.5 and let me explain why... Met a friend here the other night. They got here first and sat. I arrived 10 minutes later. I got to the table and started to talk to my friend and it seemed like a while passed by without even a hint of a server coming to us once.. My friend saw the confused look on my face and she said yeah, been sitting here 30 minutes and not one person has come to our table. Not to say hello, not to say be right back, not to even offer us a glass of water... I got up to talk to the people at the host station and when I said we have been sitting for 20-30 minute and one one person has come to our table. In a snotty attitude the host pointed behind me and said well the server is there now..  I got back to the table, we ordered drink and soon after drinks came. We talked that it stunk it took so long for the waiter to come to us but now that he came, hopefully the rest of the night will be fine.  The server came back with our drinks and at that point we were ready to order and ordered our food. It took about an average amount of time for our food to come to us, We started to eat our dinner and ran out of drinks. We watched for 10 minutes our server helping other tables and not coming to us. Finally I raised my hand and got his attention and asked for mor drinks and i.e. said sure...  I am not joking when I say this.. 20. yes T W E N T Y minutes passed, No drinks. We tried to get the attention of any server to see if we could have our drinks, one bartender who we got his attention, signaled like he would help us but nope.... Waited and waited and waited some more. Finally the waiter looked in our direction and we asked him for our drinks were ordered 20 minutes ago. And with us not having anything to drink. We sat there looking at our food, not wanting to eat without a drink. So guess what, by the time we got some more to drink, our food was cold.. But with the slow service we had, if we would have complained it would have been easter before we got any acknowledgement of our issues. When there server came back with our drinks, my daughter who was with us wanted a desert and I made sure I ordered it then because I know wit would be 20-30 minutes before we got his attention again. He would come to other tables he was serving, talk to them, help them, then walk away, He would go back in the kitchen and stay back there for 5-10 minutes at a time.  Hello. If your eating for something to be prepared, instead of lolly gaggling in the kitchen how about you go to your other tables and help them.  The waiter seemed like a nice person.  I blame the problem on this...  MANAGEMENT. or shall I say MIS-MANAGMENT!!!!! Managers should be walking around the restaurant and checking in on customer, see how things are and if we needed anything.  But from the long time it took us to get service, to the snotty attitude of the people at the host table, to the fact that I was talking to a co-worker about this place and he was like they have great food but the service is really slow and sucks...  I loved the food and would like to come back but heck no if I am going to have to sit around 30 minutes before the waiter approaches us, then wait another 20 minutes for drinks. We waited over an HOUR on our server throughout the night on things..  So if you want good food but dont care about getting good, quick customer service BJ's is the place, if you want to sit down to dinner and not have to wait a century for service... Stay clear!"
Mike U.,"Washington, DC",244,142,421,3.0,3/17/2016,"This place pretty much has it all for a somewhat upscale sports bar.  TV's everywhere and a huge bar greet you as you walk in the door.  The TV's are huge and viewable from basically anywhere in the place.  Feel free to grab a table and not miss out on any of the action! The menu itself is massive.  Tons of drinks to choose from.  Seriously, it's like the first five pages of the menu.  They have solid happy hour pricing with $2 off appetizers and $1 off beers.  I believe HH goes until 7pm here. The food runs the gamut from sports pub fare (chicken tenders, tacos, etc) right on up to fancy meals like steak and fish.  The lighter menu (less calories) is where we usually spend our time.  It would be very easy to get carried away with all the amazing looking food! The grilled mahi mahi tacos (minus the two types of dressing) is fantastic!  Two nice sized tacos with a couple of chips on the side.  Hits me right every time! They also have a rewards program so be sure to get in on that when you swing through!"
J V.,"Fairfax, VA",0,17,,3.0,11/13/2017,"Added 2 stars. The manger reached out to us and after our experience made an honest effort to get our business back. As a diner who often doesn't give second chances, I will in this case!"
