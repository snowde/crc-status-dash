Miss E.,"McLean, VA",11,148,10,2.0,6/18/2015,"I really want to leave a better review for BJs.  I've visited BJs both for lunch and dinner. The food is pretty good (love the chicken pitas).  They have a great selection of beers on tap.  Parking is convenient (there's a garage right behind the restaurant).  And they offer decent happy hour specials.  However, the service is consistently terrible.   Tuesday night was particularly bad.  My friend and I arrived and inquired about the bar tables.  The hostess said we were welcome to sit there, but we'd have no server.  We visited the busy bar each time we needed something, which really wasn't a problem.  While my friend and I were waiting in line for our 2nd drink, two more our friends showed up.  We pointed at our table and they went to go sit down.  All of a sudden a waitress came by to take their order (she didn't offer to transfer our checks from the bar).  Unfortunately, my friends barely saw her again.  In fact, she never came back after she took their next drink order (the drinks never arrived).  She had no other bar tables and clearly forgot about us.  After almost an hour, my friend had to get up and walk across the restaurant to ask for the check.  I think management needs to group their servers' tables together and offer better training."
Roel B.,"Chantilly, VA",0,4,,2.0,3/9/2015,"Really 2.5 stars.  The restaurant was empty, which was good for a our big party of 16 people. The menu gave us a ton of choices and I really wanted everything on the menu. Our server read my mind as I asked him what his favorite app and entree were, and he said the exact same things I was thinking of getting: The Frito Nachos and the Jalapeno Burger!  The beer list gave a good range and the beer was actually very good. Drinks and apps came out really quickly, which is good since our 2:00 pm reservation had me starving by the time we got there. For apps, we ordered the highly recommended Frito Nachos, Carnitas Fries and the Fried Calamari. The apps itself were a little under portioned (or maybe I was just starving), but they were good. Not great, but I was very pleased. Now here are the bad parts. By the time we finished our appetizers and first round of beers, we noticed that our waiter went missing. Also, he never took our orders for our entrees!!! It's quite noticeable if a table of 16 has their heads popping up, looking around for our waiter. I think someone mentioned something as he came rushing out to take our order.  I got the Jalapeno Burger. I love cheeseburgers, but it's not often I can get one that is flame grilled. I was stoked, but knew to get it Rare as most of the juices in a flame grilled burger actually fall off into the grill. This doesn't happen when you cook on a flat top, but then again, you don't get that flame grilled taste. We had to wait another 20 minutes to get our food since our orders were taken well after we finished our appetizers. Not a great way to manage our hunger! All the food came out at once...except for my cousin's pizza, which arrived 5-10 minutes later (smh). Excitedly cut my burger in half to devour it and automatically noticed it was well done. I ordered rare and it came out well done. It was dry, not juicy. But I was so hungry that I didn't care. The burger was ok. I've had better at Burger King. I'm sure it would have been better if it was cooked the way I wanted to. But for the waiter to suggest this is the best item on the menu is a great disappointment. My other cousin ordered the Top Sirloin. That was also well done. Tough and hard as a brick. She sent it back, but had to wait another 10-15 minutes for her new steak to come out.  I left after 2 hours, most of it was waiting, and the food was just mediocre at best. The rest of the party stayed for desserts. Please save your time and money and go somewhere else. But if you're looking to just get drinks, then this place would be just fine!"
Ling D.,"Falls Church, VA",13,45,13,4.0,9/1/2014,"Been here twice (once for drinks, once for lunch) and both times have been VERY pleasantly surprised/impressed. Food and drink are VERY reasonably priced....I'm talking $5 beers and $3 virgin strawberry daquiris. My husband and I came for lunch as well and had the unlimited soup and salad ($8) and a trio of 1/2 sandwich, fries, salad ($8). I mean c'mon, a relaxing sit-down lunch for 2 people at $17 total? The food is decent too! The caesar and tomato/mozz salad are good and generously portioned for lunch.....the clam chowder is full of clams and potatoes, although a tad bit salty. The thin-cut crispy fries are soooooo yummyyyyyy.  The place is nice and big/open, with lots of tv's (good for football season). Unlike a lot of other sports bars, you can see tv's from the entire restaurant- not just the bar area. There are 2 gigantic tv's at the bar that have split-screen capability, which is convenient for keeping up with a few games at once. The service is excellet too- both times i've been here the servers have been really polite and attentive (but not TOO attentive). Water is always full and never had to ask for refills of anything. If you're in the area, definitely worth a try!"
Tony G.,"McLean, VA",2,177,34,1.0,3/24/2015,"Nasty, low quality bland food and drinks.  Place belongs in Clarendon, not multi-ethnic Tyson's Corner.  Place harbors drunks that cannot hold their liquor aka watched a dude walkout of the bar and vomit everywhere.  Lame."
Jeromy F.,"Falls Church, VA",12,95,59,2.0,5/15/2014,"Came here for lunch with a large group. Servers did a good job of keeping up, food arrived hot and mostly at the same time. Drink refills were prompt. Lunch portion of fried chicken was uninteresting--under salted is ok, I can add at the table--but unseasoned can't be so easily corrected. Decent corn was paired with bland packaged mashed potatoes and white gravy to complete this culinary testament to mediocrity."
Kat V.,"Washington, DC",403,166,1,3.0,4/16/2014,"Went here for a late happy hour, meeting up with some friends.  The bartender, Sam, who started our evening off was very friendly and attentive despite there being a full bar that Friday night. My group ordered a number of different appetizers: stuffed mushrooms, stuffed artichokes, flat bread pizza, buffalo deep dish pizza, and wings. Everything was delicious, but notably the crust on the deep dish pizza was flaky on the outside and the perfect softness on the inside.  The hand crafted beers were also good, I stuck to the Heffiweizen and had no complaints. Others ordered their different varieties and also enjoyed them as well.  The only thing which brought my experience down was at the end of Sam's shift, there was a bartender change and when I went to close my tab I told him my name and he handed me someone else's credit card. This was a bit scary, as that could've been my own card given away to some stranger. Also, when we were there, three  of our group wanted to sit at the tables to eat so as they were eating, 2 of us sat with them to keep them company (not for an extended period of time either, just to pop in and say hi). We were rudely approached by the waitress at their table who said ""order with me or order at the bar. if u order at the bar, u can't sit here."" It was said in a very distasteful manner, and it's not like my friends were NOT ordering food and drink from her and taking up table space for no reason. I thought the lack of tact was very disrespectful. Overall, a fun place to be that is spacious and well decorated with decent food. Hope that waitress was having a rude night and isn't like that all the time."
Kim C.,"Woburn, MA",0,13,,5.0,12/9/2015,We were having a bad night and were really hungry. The staff were all great! Good beers and appetizers. Our waitress was sweet and checked on us appropriately. Both got mini pizzas which were excellent. Definitely what we needed!!
Ariel S.,"Fairfax, VA",0,5,,5.0,6/23/2016,"There is free parking in a garage connected to the building, the restaurant looks clean, and the deep dish pizza is one of a kind! It's an easy choice for pizza in this area."
Thomas J.,"Alexandria, VA",6,167,1,2.0,4/23/2014,"This is probably a great place to grab a beer with friends and enjoy hanging out and watching sports. As for food options? There's a lot better to be found in and around this area than BJs. From the amount of real estate their pizzas take up in their menu (the pages that aren't cocktails, that is), I'd have expected a better product. I got the feature pizza and got it in the hand-tossed form. My co-worker got the ""deep dish"" version. They refer to their sauce as ""zesty"". To me, it was too sweet. The crust was ...reminiscent of a Stouffers or other pizza you'd thaw out and toss in the oven. It wasn't awful, but it was also pretty far from awesome. My co-worker was happy with his, but, to me, it looked like it came from frozen, as well."
Ian F.,"Falls Church, VA",322,98,3,3.0,4/10/2014,"This place is nothing to write home about.  The food is just okay, although there is a very large beer selection that I've heard is quite good.  The atmosphere is pretty good, and clean although I'm not sure what it will be like after it's been open for a bit longer.  The service is inconsistent, as I've had both positive and negative experiences with the wait staff here.   Schedule an extra 10 minutes to get here if you're planning on coming around rush hour as the traffic in the area is simply unavoidable and the one street that can get you to the restaurant is always backed up for a few lights."
Christine H.,"Rockville, MD",298,131,125,4.0,11/19/2013,"We were in the mood for some wings and burgers and spotted BJ's across the street. We had no idea what to expect but upon entrance, everyone was so eager and friendly. It's probably because they JUST opened up and the entire staff is new so that's where the bubbly factor might come in to play.  We ordered hot wings (teriyaki flavor?) and one of their classic burgers. OMG it was amazing. The wings were juicy and very flavorful with just the right amount of sauce. The burger was really tasty and had that smokey factor to it. Good amount of toppings and the fries were really crisp and yummy!  TVs EVERYWHERE! Definitely a good spot to catch the game. Overall, if I have a craving for bar food, this is the place to go."
Helen E.,"Centreville, VA",15,58,528,3.0,12/6/2014,"The avocado appetizer was very good, too bad we didn't have our drinks with it to enjoy it.  The service was very slow, I think our waiter had too many tables, he was working hard, but hardly checked up on us. It took a long time to get the order, did not refill our drinks and we had to chase him down to get the check.  The food was just ok, everything was cold, didn't complain because there was no one around to complain to."
Hitch C.,"Vienna, VA",19,57,275,2.0,10/30/2014,I can't recommend the service in this place  But it the place is nice it needs management and new menu I don't trust the food here go with the pizza  the bar is nice too but everybody seems don't care in this place anymore they are short of staff and the fanny thing the waiter forget to give us the silver where when I asked for it he said we are short of silver where that was really terrible . I don't think they will make it At this pace .
Nam N.,"Arlington, VA",80,39,19,5.0,11/18/2014,I've been here many times. Actually almost a regular by now. The food here is decent. I love the pizza here. A medium is actually really big! I also recommend the parmesan crusted chicken. For some reason they hire the hottest guys here. Lol. They brew a lot of their own beer here. I am a light beer drinker so the lightswitch lager is delicious. I am surprised they have such low ratings. Maybe I'm not very picky.  Parking is underground and free. The decor is nice and the bar is awesome! I really enjoy it here!
Joe D.,"McLean, VA",0,28,,1.0,1/2/2015,"Been here 3 times(not sure why I came back after the first) and each time has been more disappointing than the last.  Pretty cool atmosphere, especially for watching sports and drinking some brew, just don't come here to eat.   The appetizers were ok. Had the calamari. Salad was far from fresh, main meal just not got. Although, the bison burger was ok (if the server actually brought  what we ordered)  What did actually offered came 15 minutes after the rest of us pushed food around our plates like we did at grandma's to make it look like we ate the vegies. The pizza is not even as good as 7 11 `s. Do not get the pizza. Repeat, do not get the pizza. And that is pretty sad, as they dedicate a few pages of the menu to pizza.  Now the service. Not even one star. Slow, slow, slow. The staff is more interested in chatting with each other than taking care of their guests.  Just save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. Maybe 7 11 for some pizza"
Jay M.,"Boston, MA",41,235,,4.0,3/2/2014,"Back to BJ's!   Went here a few days ago and failed to write my review... so please read and do not get too teary eyed! ATMOSPHERE: Great place for a bar and to be with the family.  Not very loud compared to other places with bars. FOOD: Superb! Sometimes they can use a bit too much butter on their bread, but the every time we have been there has been great.  The menu has something for everyone!  Very diverse!  The pizzas are almost deep dish. They have a great sauce and the crust is crunchy and sweet... Their burgers are fresh and cooked to order and usually right. SERVICE:  Always good no complaints."
Laney D.,"San Jose, CA",0,15,3,1.0,10/18/2015,"Never going to any Bjs establishment again. The last time I went it took them 20 minutes to get water for us. We never got the salads and appetizer we ordered. And they got my moms meal wrong twice and it took them about 40 minuets until she finally got her food. The funny thing is, they where not even busy. They also kept coming up to us with the wrong food more than a dozen times which became annoying. I used to love Bjs food but now it's just not even worth it. Even in California I've experienced the same horrible service"
Heather H.,"Centreville, VA",54,123,,3.0,2/23/2014,"I went here for a happy hour in the bar section. They have a large selection of beers that they brew as well as some others on tap. I like wheat beer or lagers and they didn't have many options other than one hefeweizen and a light lager. The hefeweizen was ok but I would have preferred that serve it with an orange slice. Their happy hour specials are pretty good too. All of their beers are $4, some special mixed drinks $5, and select wines for $6. They also have several food specials. I tried the bj's wings and the stuffed mushroom caps. The wings were very good. Not spicy but flavorful and a decent size.  It got very crowded  and loud as the night went on and it was a Friday night too. They have tables in the bar section and I felt bad for the people that were sitting there because they had all the people at the bar standing right on top of them. The service was ok. We had a waiter who also had tables to wait on and when it got busy it was hard to track him down. I'm not sure I would go for dinner here based on others reviews on the food but I would go back for happy hour."
Ken K.,"Herndon, VA",17,27,9,3.0,7/12/2015,"A little better than a 3 but not enough for a 4.  A good place for beer, IPA selection is limited.  Last time I went it was convenient to a training center I was at and took a few visitors with me.  We enjoyed the service and food, food came out a little slow, so it was good we had a lot to talk about.  Not a place to avoid but not yet a destination spot."
Maggie M.,"Fairfax, VA",160,141,16,4.0,11/4/2013,"A friend of mine had given me a gift card to BJ's Brew house so a few girlfriends and I went to dinner. (Thanks Matt)! I made a reservation and when we got there the place was fully packed. Huge tv's in the bar area (plus for going on a Sunday) they also have a couple tv's around the restaurant.  My friend and I are gluten free, so they had a separate gluten free menu (which I appreciate). Our server was wonderful and helped out patiently with the gluten free orders.    I got the blackened salmon salad, my salmon was cooked to perfection. Crisp around the edges and soft/tender in the middle. Loaded with plenty of delicious veggies and huge slices of fresh avocado to finish it off.    One of the girls got a gluten free pizza (with no cheese) but loaded it up with other toppings like chicken, mushrooms, onions, olives. She said her pizza was delicious.  Overall a great experience and Ill def be returning back. Parking is easy just park in the garage near Nordstrom Rack."
