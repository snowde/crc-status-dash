Katie K.,"Fairfax, VA",20,14,116,2.0,11/8/2014,"Ok, I so had high hopes for this place. The space and decor is nice. Huge bar, where it's the focus. Lots of seating in the rest of the space. The dinner service was slow to dismal. It took over 15 minutes  before we could order our dinner (2 top).  The crispy fried artichokes  were ok. Basically  jarred artichoke  hearts  cut in quarters, breaded and fried.  So once you bite into them be careful, you might get squirted  with the hot brine of the artichoke.  We ordered  the cherry chiptole salmon. It was okay, salmon was a bit dry.  Unlike my entree of shrimp scampi pasta, the shrimp was over cooked on one side. So basically one side was pink and white while the otherwise was brown. Seriously brown?? One would think it was fried.  Plus the pasta was pretty bland. My friend  was halfway  done before our server came by to check on us. I sent the dish back, but had to ask the server for a menu. Order a deep dish pizza instead. It took over 25 mins for it to arrive seriously????  Also my friend had to order for another beer twice before it came.  It's just awful, as I sit here at the restaurant  for over 2 hours for a pizza basically. I'm very ticked at the moment, I'm  surprised  that no one from  management  even bothered to stopped  by to check or even apologize. I wonder if they are even aware?  I the only reason this place is even getting  2 stars is the beer. The pumpkin ale is very good. We won't  be back anytime soon."
Catherine S.,"McLean, VA",224,32,150,4.0,8/1/2015,"4 stars for...  1. BJ's DEEP DISH PIZZA with buttery crust (5,000 calories I imagine) 2. BJ's Brews (Jeremiah red is my boyfriend's favorite) 3. BJ's Pizookies (variety of warm, gooey cookie skillets with ice cream - TRY IT) Majority of the menu is however is mediocre. Menu is too big for them to really focus on making the food spectacular (similar to Cheesecake factory). But at least you have A LOT of CHOICES.  Our favorite deep dish pizza is the Pepperoni EXTREME... peps 3 ways... sliced, diced and julienned. Buffalo chicken pizza is delish as well. They'll also let you order half one pizza and half another which is perfect for when you can't decide! We always sit at the bar area & enjoy some brews with our pizza. Lots of TVs for football in fall (& beer specials for GOOD QUALITY BEER!) We've been lucky to have very attentive service every visit.  For a while we parked in the nearby parking garage around the corner making it a cold walk in the winter.  After eating at BJ's like 10 times, we JUST figured out about the convenient & free parking garage underneath the restaurant (we felt like idiots!).  Finally, make sure to get the BJ's loyalty card - it'll save you some bucks in the future :)"
Chris C.,"Washington, DC",164,368,738,4.0,3/25/2015,BJ's Brewhouse is a great place to catch the game in the Tysons Corner area. They have large TVs throughout the place and have great specials during the NFL Sunday Weekend. They had half off Pizzas and $3 drafts all day long.  I recommend the pizzas and the typical bar food variety here.  Also - There is convenient Free Parking in the Parking Garage and a Nordstrom Rack nextdoor if you like to show.
Scott A.,"Pittsburgh, PA",103,20,13,3.0,6/28/2015,"BJs is sort of a good staple Brewhouse chain.  A nicer experience that a Friday's, etc., but it's not going to blow your mind either.   I ordered the tomato mozzarella appetizer and a pizza. Both were good eats.  This particular BJs is WIDE OPEN inside, which is very nice. The staff is friendly and efficient.  So: a great, normal night out."
victoria j.,"Gaithersburg, MD",24,84,163,4.0,4/6/2015,"My 2010 review of BJ's was for a location in Texas. I had a much better experience in the Tysons Corner location this time. The service is not the fastest in the world, but my server was friendly and he was fast enough. I had the following: Drink: 8 beer tasters - My favorite is Jeremy Red Appetizer: Garlic parmesan wings - decent but I can't eat more than 2 of these... Salad: BBQ chicken chopped salad - awesome as always! My cousin had the Sante Fe salad which is almost just as good. Pizza: Deep-dish 1/2 BJ's Favorite & 1/2 Spicy Hawaiian - soooo good! The bread is so sticky and chewy. I love the fact that these pizzas are individually baked fresh with each order.  Usually, I would have a pizooki to finish the meal, but I was way too full this time around to get one. Had I gotten a pizooki, I would've gotten 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 oatmeal (assuming they still do 1/2s like they used to back in the days). They also used to do free pizookis for birthdays, but I'm not sure if they do it anymore. It's worth a try."
John K.,"Fairfax, VA",304,377,1879,2.0,12/19/2015,"My team and I frequent this place from time to time for happy hour since it's conveniently located to our office. Beer specials during happy hour are decent and the appetizers are ok. I think the flatbread pizza is the best thing on the menu during happy hour. Other than that I'd only share that service is rather poor and the size of the establishment might contribute to this issue. It's a BIG space and you have to traverse a mile it seems just to get to the restrooms. I would give this place a higher rating, but the service just brings it down for me."
Min K.,"Arlington, VA",72,108,104,4.0,3/8/2015,"I come here for lunch and happy hour. I love their brew house turkey burger. Juicy and moist. Yum so good. I've tried their buffalo burger and it was a bit dry. I've also tried a scattering of things here and hands down their turkey burger is the best I've had so far.  Service is a bit slow and there may be a long wait to get seated if you come during their busy hours.  I like this place though, convenient from my office, and great happy hour prices. Good selection to beers and liquor. I'll be coming back."
David P.,"Vienna, VA",0,1,,1.0,5/25/2017,"We wanted to try something new, and this was recommended.  After being seated, server came overtook see if were ready.  Since it was our first time there, I said a few more minutes.  20 minutes later she finally came back and took our order.  Wife orders hamburger with sweet potato fries.  Server says it is an up charge, wife says ok. Our friend orders shrimp tacos, and I order a sandwich.  My wife orders a rum and coke with lime.  5 minutes later, someone come by with a Cap't Morgan and Pepsi.  My wife says I ordered a rum and coke.  ""I'll get your server"" this other server states.  I finally flag down our server after more than 5 minutes.  She argues with my wife that that is what she ordered.  After several minutes she states ""I don't even like rum.""  She takes the incorrect drink away.  Food shows up more than 10-15 minutes later by another server.  Still no drink.  When the food is delivered, no problem with my sandwich.  Wife has regular fries and server hands a plate to friend.  Unknown to everyone, there is chewing gum stuck to the bottom of the plate and into our friend's fingers.  He mentions it to the server, with the stringy gum all over.  Server returns to kitchen with plate.  Drink arrives finally, correct.  She puts it on the table and leaves.  Friend no food, wife wrong food.  I flag another server down and asker her to get the manager.  He shows up and sits down in our both.  ""How may I help you?""  I explain the drink problem, wrong fries that we payed for, and the gum on the plate.  Our friend also asks the manager if his tacos were supposed to come with chips, he states yes, but they ran out and all the servers were told, should have offered a substitute.  I explain this is our first time  and we are not coming back. ""We have great food   and drinks"" he states.  I will give you the GM's card and I'll get your information and he will call you tomorrow.  He leaves.  He returns with the sweet potato fries, shrimp tacos on a new plate and some fries.  Shrimp tacos are now cold.    We finish eating,  friend does not finish the second taco and we ask for a box. Box and bill come.  Friend decides food is not worth taking home. Pay the bill, very small tip and leave.  Manager never came back over with GM information. When we walk out the door, we walk by the manager.  He says nothing.    I am saying something now, DON'T GO HERE!!!"
Danielle S.,"Reston, VA",0,128,2,1.0,1/11/2017,"Just plain bad, both in food and service. I can honestly say my Mahi Mahi and Shrimp dish was one of the worst plates of food I've ever had. The edges of the fish were hard and overlooked, and the ""sauce"", more like a soup, tasted like a bowl of pure salt. Literally it's like the chef dumped the entire salt shaker into the bowl - gross! Not only was the food bad, but the service was slow and our server seemed to be just going through the motions and not interested in being there. With so many great dining options in the D.C. area (even chains), I definitely won't be back here!!"
Annie P.,"Fairfax, VA",1728,951,779,3.0,7/30/2014,"Drinks, happy hour specials, and big spacious restaurants is 5 stars, food is a 3 stars, service is 2 stars.  I've frequented BJ's a few times already and it's definitely A-OK in my book. I like their selection of handcrafted beers and mixed cocktails.  Their food is average -- you can get full of their different selections of appetizers instead of ordering entrees.  I tried their salted caramel pizookie for dessert and wasn't impressed -- the cookie portion was hard, it would've tasted better if it was a soft. The service here has been off each time I've gone.  Either it's slow (with barely any tables dining around us), the server forgets something, or it takes awhile to be acknowledged at the bar. I would only come back here for the appetizers and drinks."
Adrian C.,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",0,12,,1.0,12/2/2016,"From walking into the lobby to the entrees to arrive, we waited 1.5 hours. Can't afford to waste that much time again. Will not be returning."
Oscar D.,"Vienna, VA",0,7,1,5.0,4/2/2016,"BJ's is always a buzzing place with great food and drink selections. The staff is friendly and attentive. We had a barbarcoa chicken dish with black beans and rice, and a bison burger. Alabama Sunset was refreshing and tasty. BJ's Red Jeremiah draft hit the spot.  We enjoyed our experience."
Pam I.,"Washington, DC",107,73,28,5.0,10/29/2015,"You can't go wrong with BJ's. A neighborhood sports bar with great brew, nice ambiance and excellent food. Ive never been disappointed here with either the food or service. I travel a lot and can always rely on consistent good food no matter which location I visit. And the wings are the best I've ever had."
Karisa G.,"Arlington, VA",521,798,519,4.0,7/10/2014,"Happy hour 4-7 I came to BJ's Restaurant with some friends recently for dinner. We arrived at 6:50 which gave us 10 minutes to order from the happy hour menu. You laugh, but I'm always up for a good deal. They have decent Happy Hour specials on their drafts, house wines, rail drinks, as well as certain munchies. We ordered a round of drinks (I ordered a draft red ale called the Abbey Ale). It's a smooth and tasty drinking beer.  Their food is probably typical American fare. I split the bacon ranch deep-dish pizza with a side salad of tomato and mozzarella. The salad was tasty, light and well balanced flavors. The pizza was pretty good, very filling but made perfect leftovers for lunch the next day.  What made me give BJ's 4 stars was the service. Our waiter was fantastic. He was friendly, humored my group's random requests, and was honest when he realized there was a mistake on our receipt. He took care of it no problem! The restaurant is pretty spacious with a big bar area. I liked how the bottles are stacked and placed in an inverted tiered shelf.  Good beer and good service. I'd recommend BJ's for drinks (especially during Happy Hour)."
Rick W.,"Vienna, VA",0,30,,2.0,12/28/2016,"We've been to BJ's about 3-4 times since it opened and it definitely seems to be going downhill.  It feels poorly managed and I believe it will not survive in the long run as there are too many nice restaurants in the area.  We arrived a few nights ago for dinner and had to wait 25 minutes for a table...not because it was too busy, but there were not enough workers.  Mor than half of the restaurant was empty.  This is just poor management.  We had a few beers at the bar and the bartender was trying to serve about 20 people by himself.  It seems like they are trying to cut costs by reducing service. After arriving at our table and ordering, it took about another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Some of the food was good and other food was just not.  I ordered a burger and found that the bottom of the bun had mold on it.  There is really something wrong with the way this restaurant is being run.  We won't be returning and we have plenty of other places to try and enjoy."
ChowNut ..,"McLean, VA",2,375,2688,4.0,11/8/2014,"This joint replaces the old Bertucci's that I loved (miss you Sporkie).  It's clean, new, and full of floor to ceiling glass windows . There's music pumping with many screens showing games.  The bar area is a great gathering spot and there are HH specials.  Parking is easy with free covered parking. This joint was surprisingly not busy on a Friday night.  I called ahead and they said there was no line.  The menu reminds me of a diner menu....tons of options.  Every single beer they offer was listed and described.  There are many burger, entrée, salad, and sandwich options.  There are also many dessert options. Overall, the food was pretty good.  I think the prices are slightly higher than your typical TGIF but the food is a bit better also. The best thing about this place is accessibility as you're on the outskirts of the heart of Tysons so you don't have to get into the madness just to dine here.  Oh yeah, Nordstrom Rack is like 20 feet away."
Jan M.,"Manhattan, NY",25,43,391,2.0,11/25/2015,Not great service at the bar.  Food was mediocre and bland.   Used to my NY spot which is much better.  Will not go back to this location.
Sarah S.,"Annandale, VA",438,329,1285,2.0,7/12/2014,"I went a couple of times when they opened.  I asked about a pizza because I thought that was one of their things.  I was disappointed with the flat bread dish I got.  The waiter described it as a pizza but it really wasn't, instead it was a really big cracker with some stuff drizzled on it.   The menu is insanely huge from bar food to seafood dishes to pasta to steaks to high calorie salads (think 90's salads with more calories and fat than a steak -- for example Barbecue Chicken Chopped Salad topped with onion rings).  It made me think of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares and what he said about places with long menus and not being an expert at anything. Frankly, I'm not sure what kind of restaurant BJ's is exactly.  Is it a sports bar/beer pub ,  a place to take the kids or a date night/business meeting place?  There are a lot of better places in visit in the Tyson's Corner area without such personality disorders."
Vanessa L.,"Washington, DC",2,181,70,4.0,12/14/2015,"I came here with a large party (20+ people) on a Saturday night. I ordered the Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad and added grilled salmon. Deeeeee-lish! It was soooooo mouth-watering good however, I am not sure why they added ""Brussels Sprouts"" to the name. I got about 2-3 brussels sprouts in my salad. Two other people I was with ordered the same exact thing and they also received very few brussels sprouts. I also shared the Pizookie Trio. If you are due for your cheat meal and/or you just don't care what your body looks like, I highly recommend you get that. It will put you in absolute bliss. Our party had over 20 people and the waiters were really quick at serving us with food and drinks. The women's bathroom was dirty though. I will definitely come back to this place."
Sincere M.,"Falls Church, VA",85,75,130,3.0,12/28/2015,"Small plate menu is SO on point. Whether it's the stuffed mushrooms, or the tomato & mozzarella, you absolutely can't go wrong, especially with some of that Special brew mix!  Oscar is a great and very attentive bartender, we've always sat at the bar now that I think about it (not a bar person) but we're always well taken care of."
