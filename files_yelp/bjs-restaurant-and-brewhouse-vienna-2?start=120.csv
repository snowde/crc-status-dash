Lily Z.,"Rockville, MD",214,64,362,1.0,5/11/2014,"Nothing special.... The food is terrible and the service is terrible. My friend had to get up and flag a server down after sitting around for 20 minutes. The environment itself is nice, very big tv in bar area to watch sports.  I ordered the Santa Fe spring rolls, spinach and artichoke dip and California club flatbread. And my friend got the Hawaiian Mali Mali. Very thing was nasty, I could barely eat it, I left still hungry. I'm gna give the BJ's baked beignet a chance because I love dessert. I'm not gna lie. It's very good, but I wish there was more strawberries.  Overall, I would definitely not be coming back. Maybe for beer and dessert?"
Eddie K.,"Rockville, MD",171,420,1978,4.0,5/22/2014,I can only comment on late night Happy hour - went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty empty.  I was surprised how many beers they have on draft.  We had a pitcher of their pale ale - it was great.  Next time I will get their beer sampler.  Tried several several happy hour appetizers and they were all good.  I did like the mini deep dish pizza because you can choose which deep dish pizza you want from their regular pizza menu.
Matt G.,"Brick Township, NJ",66,258,3,3.0,6/10/2015,"As Yelp describes three stars, this place falls squarely into the ""A-OK"" territory.  Not bad, not great, but an OK option to eat at if you're in the area. The atmosphere here is your fairly standard sports bar, with a *very* slight bistro / pub touch.  There's a brewery on premises that churns out a fairly decent selection of brews (more on that later) for you to imbibe, and prices are fairly average for the area.  A few friends local to the area told me that BJ's specialty is pizza, although being from New Jersey, I knew that was a tree I didn't want to go barking up, so I opted for a burger, extra rare. First things first - the service is what really knocks points off, here.  It took *forever* to get anything, be it refills on drinks, more beers, or even salads.  One friend ordered a pizza with olives, and was told nearly 35 minutes later that the kitchen was out, and they could make him something else.  Really? You waited until most of our food was out of the kitchen before telling us this?  The poor guy had to sit there watching us all eat, until his own food finally came out. What should have been a quick meal of pizzas, burgers and beers (not the most complex things, folks), ended up taking ~2 hours, when all was said and done.  My burger was more medium-well than rare, which I figured would happen, since it took so long to exit the kitchen.  The beers were pretty decent, although nothing really stunning.  Still, they redeem themselves a bit in that department, since there was plenty of styles to pick from. Would I go back?  Eh, maybe.  The food wasn't bad, and the beers are a nice addition, but slow service and poor communication kind of soured the whole experience.  With so many options in the area, including several other breweries / brewpubs, I'll probably end up elsewhere if I'm down in the area.  Still, an OK option if you're in a pinch, and want a menu that will have something for everyone."
CJ E.,"New York, NY",9,26,,1.0,5/27/2015,"I've very rarely walked out from a restaurant. Came on a very slow Wednesday night. The host (guy with the dreadlocks) told us to seat ourselves and he really didn't care about giving us any service, which he made known by his demeanor. He actually ended up seating 2 young women at a table near us, so we know we weren't in a self seating zone.  We sat there for 10 minutes wondering if we were gonna get some menus. After 10 minutes we flagged down a busser to see if he could get us some help. He told us our server was Karina and that he would go get her. He tried getting her and definitely spoke to someone about serving us, but after another 10 minutes, no one came. We left. Unacceptable level of service here. I've been to many BJ's all over the country and this one is particularly bad."
Demetria C.,"Arlington, VA",201,219,177,4.0,11/11/2015,"Huge place, GREAT for happy hour. The bar food is great, and their own brewed beer and cider (especially the berry burst cider) is delicious. I think the service could be a bit better - although the bartenders are always very attentive - It seems that once the bar gets a bit packed, the servers get a bit annoyed. I'm not sure what they expect, but the food has always been tasty - especially their deep dish pizzas and wings."
Mallory M.,"Arlington, VA",23,48,42,4.0,5/26/2014,"Super affordable for the area! I came with a group of six and we sat in the bar area. I love that the bar area has large booths to accommodate bigger parties. We shared pitchers of beer and we each ordered an entree. The beer was fairly good- even after happy hour the pitchers were only $15!  Our entrees were large and tasty considering the price. The reason we decided to come to BJs was the ""Pizooke"" or Pizza Cookie. We ordered the sea salt caramel pizookie and it was to die for! Our entire party was fighting over it.  Over all - great experience. Could improve by ensuring the staff is more attentive, but you can't beat this place price-wise or Pizookie- wise !"
Nathan G.,"Fairfax, VA",10,205,45,4.0,11/16/2015,"By and large we had a good experience at BJ's. It's always great to find a restaurant that doesn't have a huge wait on a Friday night, and we were seated immediately. They have an impressive selection of items on their menu, and I liked that they have berry cider as one of their in-house brews. We ordered a pitcher, and it was perfect to split between two people. Service was speedy enough, given it was a Friday night. My hickory brisket bacon burger looked exactly like the menu photo (impressive), and it came with sizeable amount of fries, so no complaints. My friend enjoyed his pizza. Our only complaint was the chips and queso appetizer we ordered. The queso was fine, but we definitely got the bottom of the bag chips. I'd say 1/3 to 1/2 were broken fragments, not good for dipping. We were too full to get dessert, but I look forward to trying it on a future visit."
Tiffany L.,"Charlottesville, VA",129,109,51,4.0,8/9/2014,"I lived and worked close by this summer so I went here a lot for happy hour and late nights. The California Club burger was very worth it!! Mojitos are decent and beers (esp red) are very good. They're pizzas and flatbreads are just okay. The appetizers are all good, but nothing special.  Save room for dessert! The pizookie is amazing! It's a basic concept, freshly made cookie topped with ice cream. I've tried most flavors but cookies n cream is my favorite.  I went here to watch US play in the World Cup and it was such a great atmosphere. The service was surprisingly quick considering how overcrowded an understaffed it was that day.  Overall, great place to hang w coworkers and friends and/or watch sports at the bar."
Julio R.,"Alexandria, VA",15,11,5,2.0,5/31/2015,"Brought my little brother, and my girlfriend with her family here yesterday, MAY 30th, at 9:30pm. The food was great! We ordered a little bit of everything from the menu. However the service was not so great. Maybe our server had a long shift, or whatever the case may be. I am a pretty understandable person, so my tip most definitly did not reflect the service quality  My little brother had to ask for a water refill 3 times before getting it.  I had to ask for a beer refill (which is rare because thats the one thing they always check), and when I did, I was questioned if I was going to pay or not. (I wouldve taken it as a harmless joke if the service wasnt bad) (Condiments where brought to us towards the end of our meal)  The waiter did not bother to check on us at all during our visit. (Normally at any restaurant I find myself saying, ""we're fine thanks"" countless times. Not here.)  And to finalize it, we were seated towards the entrance. I did not mind that at all, however I felt like everyone (host, waiters standing around) kept staring at us.  Im not a picky consumer, but sadly this is what you might get when eating here.  I WILL be coming back, the food/beer was great. Service needs some tuning."
J L.,"Dunn Loring, VA",8,1,,1.0,9/24/2016,"If I could give zero I would.  Horrible service.  No waiter for 10 min even though it's not busy.  When he does arrive he says, ""let's go"".  No greeting, nothing.  He immediately wanted us to order without even getting drinks.  Extremely rude wait staff.  Customers are not treated like paying customers.  Better places to go in the area.  There's a reason you can walk in here anytime without a wait."
Chrisonna P.,"Washington, DC",58,2,,1.0,9/15/2016,"I would assume that all customers would be acknowledged in such an establishments but I was not. A co-worker and I came to this establishment for the first time. We wanted to drink custom brewed beer and bourbon and were greeted with a less than interested bar staff. Maybe we should have sat at a table - maybe we should have known our place - but this particular day we were just in need of a couple of happy hour beers and appetizers and somehow this was a difficult task. First - it was our first time at BJ's and the bar staff was less than accommodating to acknowledge this. It was before 5:30p with a bar half full but still me and my colleague were forced to wait. When we did order food - we sat for almost an hour and our bartender never acknowledged our wait or even asked if we were in need of assistance. Our first beer is empty- and we still wait. We chose to request service from another bartender to request our second drink and to see if our appetizers were coming. 5 tables arrived after us and received food and we still waited - no bartender inquired to our needs. I asked bar staff, wait staff, and servers to look into our food - NO RESPONSE. I then cancelled my order as this is a happy hour not dinner - and dinner time is fast approaching. My colleague and I finished our drinks and proceeded to cash out. I placed my credit card - she was waiting to finish hers to place hers. Without warning the bartender swiped my card for the entire balance - no one stated ""are you ready"" or ""you all set"" as I saw others at the bar were acknowledged. No biggie - 4 drinks - I will take it. All I have to say is - I deserve to be acknowledged and to be respected and to be served. Today, I cannot say I was any of these things. Some may have received amazing service but today my colleague and I did not. I noted on my bill that ""I will never come here again EVER!"" These words I mean and I will stay true to. I was a server in college and am fully aware of good service - this was the worst service I have received in my entire LIFE. Maybe I was not the customer they wanted but I know I would be the best they ever had. I tip big and I complain minimally - but today I was disrespected and will never spend another dollar in such an establishment. Note: I did not call manager and did not make a scene. Consider me a secret shopper and you received an ""F."""
Joann B.,"Fairfax, VA",162,428,133,2.0,3/28/2014,"***Review for take-out order only*** A friend and I ordered on-line, boneless wings and a mini pizza.  The ordering was easy and the staff was welcoming when we arrived.  I had hoped the wings were going to be really good, but they were fine.  The boneless wings should just be called chicken bites.  There was the right amount of breading, but some bites were a little drier than others.  We ordered two flavors, buffalo wing and garlic parmesan.  They were fine.  The mini pizza was definitely mini.  The width was a little bit smaller than the Mexican Pizza from  Taco Bell.  Overall, it was just ok. I'll give them another try since we didn't dine in, but I'm going to steer clear of the boneless wings and mini pizza - they weren't worth the $10/each."
Mo J.,"Falls Church, VA",0,5,,2.0,12/19/2016,holiday work dinner. had their jambala and asked to be spicy. what was got was an ok spicy dish bit terribly salty.
Dawn M.,"Washington, DC",4,27,57,4.0,10/11/2015,"From the time we arrived until we left, the service was excellent. Super friendly servers and hostesses. Food was very good. I had the crispy jalapeno burger, no bun, wedge fries. Loved the chipotle sauce. Burger was cooked slightly less than requested but was still edible and quite tasty. My mom had the root beer ribs and loved them. Fall-off-the-bone tender. Slightly spicy, lots of flavor. As well as the watermelon and feta salad. Great combination. Dad had the classic pizza,  tavern cut. Pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. Great flavor.  I've been to BJs in Vegas and Orlando and loved them both and thankfully, this one proved to be a similar and great experience. Will definitely be back."
Ups C.,"Vienna, VA",61,80,17,1.0,9/10/2016,"I really hate writing bad reviews bc I know we all have bad days, but if someone in higher management or in HR reads this, you may want to address some of the big concerns your customers are having if you want to stay in business with more popular establishments like Earls right around the corner.  We came here to watch a football game and have some good deep dish pizza. It took several minutes to locate our server. When he finally arrived, he has zero energy. Seriously, if you don't want to work there, you really shouldn't or they should pay you better. We ordered apps which came out very late and ordered 2 pizzas. The pizzas came out underdone and had to be sent back. The server told us 10 min. 40 min later, two new pizzas which weren't as we asked and still underdone. We were in all seriousness the only people eating food at this point as they were empty so the question arises as to why such a delay? The manager came out to explain there was only 1 chef and he got backed up. But with who?? Nobody else is dining in your facility except for a handful of people eating fries at the bar. We couldn't find our server again and had to get another gentleman to help us. Our waiter came to us and said, ""I'm just the waiter, not the cook"". Uh...ok.  We looked up your reviews and it's pretty much a generalized opinion that there are major flaws at this location. It's a shame though. We were so excited with this opening in our neighborhood and now have to resort to parking at the mall to get to Earls. Hope something changes soon."
Zach A.,"Oakton, VA",0,11,1,1.0,3/21/2014,"A never-neverland experience! Because I never ate any food. It would have been better if I at least ate imaginary food like Robin Williams in the most badass movie of the 90's! Like the movie Hook, I sat ther like Peter Pan with napkin tucked in collar, and fork in my left hand and knife in my right no food actually appeared in front of me. ""What's the deal, where's the real food?"" I said. The server gave me the response ""We are really busy and it's on its way."" After 3 times of the same response and water refill on my Sprite, I really wanted to help Tinkerbell fly by inserting my foot in his @$$. Better heads prevailed though and I flew the hell out of there after waiting an hour a chicken club sandwich that never came. Ghandi ate more than this!"
Dawn C.,"Reston, VA",53,56,,2.0,4/14/2015,"First of all, the extra star is for pretty good gluten-free pizza with a wide range of toppings to choose from. So I'd say if you want a beer and a GF pizza after work and don't care about atmosphere or any of the other critiques in this review, this is your place to go. HOWEVER, everything else about this place is so one star it's silly. If this was out in Ashburn, I could maybe forgive most of the flaws, but this is prime real estate in Tyson's Corner! I went for a happy hour, arrived just a little after 5pm. The bar was PACKED. The high ceilings and large space means it's LOUD (just FYI, I know there's not much they can do about that). There were about half as many servers doing happy hour as they needed, and they were all extremely surly. As in come over, grumble ""What do you want to drink?"" and then get pissy when the members of my party who had literally just walked up didn't immediately know what they wanted. I had a server get pissy at me because I asked for a water refill, from the pitcher that was right next to her, that I was going to get myself but then decided I should ask first. There were multiple pissed off servers acting like it was *so insanely inconvenient* that they had to walk through people standing around and talking... at happy hour... in a bar. ALSO, if you're going to go here for a happy hour, ONLY GO IF YOU TRUST THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING WITH. Their ticket system prints everything for a party up on one big huge ticket so it would be exceptionally easy for someone in your party to slip out without paying, leaving you footing the bill. The drinks are a total and complete joke, unless you like Bacardi and flavored Stoli. Reminds me of the stuff we used to drink in college when we wanted to feel high-class. Just bottom of the barrel, cheap cheap stuff.  This place is trying to be a high-class Applebee's, and doing a piss poor job of it. There's about a hundred other, better service better quality better food choices in Tyson's Corner to go to for happy hour. Pay an extra $1-2 per drink and go somewhere that doesn't suck."
Andy M.,"Vienna, VA",43,1,,1.0,8/11/2016,"The only positive was that we were seated semi quickly. Some how got side salads before water?!?! That was after about 20 minutes. The Waiter had to comeback to the table twice to clarify different orders. Now it has been 30 minutes and still no drinks, didn't know it was that hard to cream soda and water. The cream soda was flat by the time it got hear. (Not realy, but you get the point). It didn't use to be this bad. About 6 months ago it was better, but since then it's a jump off the deep end. I downloaded this app, just to write this and warm people to not to waste their money here. We were sat at 8:18 and it was 8:56 when we got 4 of the 6 drinks at the table. I don't blame the waiter, I blame who ever threw him to the wolves. We got the food 6 minutes short of an hour but................. two entrees were wrong. If this place had po service and could do things in a timely manner it could be okay, but it's not and it won't. I will never go back and will never recommend."
Thuan T.,"Falls Church, VA",278,124,63,4.0,8/31/2015,"Came to BJ's with some friends for a birthday lunch and was not disappointed. We all ordered from the lunch special menu (because honestly, why not), and the food was pretty good. I got a Piranha Brew Chili and Cheese potato which was around $10, and it tasted fairly good. It was by no means disappointing, rather just standard American baked potato. Nothing too special. My other friends overwhelmingly got chicken tenders and fries, and they were also good. Between all of us, we shared a couple pitchers of BJ's Berry Burst Cider, and it was quite tasty. It was predominately flavored with blackberry/raspberry/wildberry so it was a bit tart but just the right amount of sweet. I am a sucker for cider however, so maybe that's just me, but all my other friends quite enjoyed it as well. One of us got a burger with fries (forgot what kind) and man, his dish looked -colossal-. Maybe it was the size of the burger or the sheer amount of fries he received with his dish, but he ended up having to get a to-go box. We ran into a slight hiccup with our check because of the pitcher split between us and some wrong change given for cash orders, but it was otherwise resolved fairly quickly and they didn't give us too much grief over it. Other places might have been a little difficult depending on the service, but we got it done pretty quickly. Overall, I'd come back here for a good bite!"
Ishaan K.,"Washington, DC",33,78,181,4.0,8/10/2015,"This place is an awesome happy hour spot. The beer selection is huge and they have great deals on HH appetizers. We tried the avocado egg rolls, buffalo wings, potato skins and spring rolls and they were all pretty good. Definitely try out their house beers, I would recommend the PM Porter and the Nutty Brewnette. Overall good food, great beer and an awesome spot."
