Andrew S.,"Washington, DC",131,480,368,4.0,3/24/2014,"I've been in a few times now, and have thoroughly enjoyed myself for a few reasons. 1. Beer/booze (have you read some of my other reviews?): They not only have their own brews, which are offered at a great price for their happy hour specials, but they have multiple other beers and ciders on tap for those that aren't up to trying the house beers.  They also have a full bar to make cocktails or straight drinks. 2. Food: tasty pub fare.  I have yet to try their deep dish pizza, which looks quite tasty.  It's not gormet, but hits the spot when pared with beer.  The half size, reduced price happy hour apps are worth it too. 3. Space/service: this place doesn't look big, but offers a lot of space.  The bar gets pretty crowded during happy hour/Friday night, so you may need a table.  If so, the service isn't too bad.  They move as fast as they can, but could staff the bar with a little more since people are there to drink or watch what is one of the largest television screens I've seen up to this point in my life. Overall, more than worth a visit, and they have free wifi and lots of parking under the building.  Make sure you have a cab company's number handy or a driver.  You may need it."
Daniel Y.,"Centreville, VA",0,1,,1.0,8/11/2016,I can honestly say this was the worst steak I have ever had in my life. No sear yet somehow overcooked. Paltry sides to boot. Service was decent.
Ana Ruth J.,"Alexandria, VA",61,56,1,1.0,3/29/2015,Wow....I have never had horrible service as I did today.  Came in for a birthday 20 people at the table...waiter yelled at us for moving around within our table because he didn't know where drinks went and he didn't want to yell...dude being a waiter is demanding if you can't handle it don't do it.  Bjs do something about your wait staff
Kevin K.,"Alexandria, VA",4,56,36,5.0,6/15/2016,Been the a BJ's in colorado and this one seems a little more organized. The food was good as well as the beer they brew! Will be returning again. (Look for coupons online)
Yukie A.,"Ashburn, VA",0,19,5,1.0,3/14/2015,"My husband and I decided to try this place out after looking at the reviews we decided to give it a shot. There are mixed reviews on Yelp so we wanted it out ourselves. It is very spacious and they have a great bar set up but that was about it. I tried the beer sampler and he ordered a beer. All the beer I had was watered down, had no flavor.  We ordered: The avocado roll - the presentation was not very appetizing but we both love avocado. The doughy was undercooked  Bison Burger(medium well)- he didn't noticed that it was pretty much raw until I asked to taste it and saw all the uncooked red meet gushing out  Thai chicken mango salad- there were a bunch of ingredients in the salad which were very fresh except it had no flavor to it. I got the dressing on the side and it was so watered down had no flavor to it either  Bar- there were 4 adult men watching the basketball game. It was sat lunch time and they were loud and literally screaming at the TV(game) none of the managers or supervisors did anything about it. It was obvious other guests were disturbed because everyone would look at them. The manager should have politely told them to turn it down a bit. The waiter was def creepy but besides that he asked how everything was , I replied not great but were done so he said ok I'll be back with your check?  I asked for the manager to explain to her the situation and told her we are not looking for free food but just wanted her know the situation. She handled it very well and professional and offered courtesy cards to come back.  We will not be back...and after we left I looked at the menu again to see an ingredient I wasn't sure about in my salad, to my surprise I noticed I never got the chicken in the chicken salad... So we paid for a meal that we didn't even get... The only star is for the manager's professionalism, other wise ""0"" for food bc I am convinced they have a cook not a chef"
M K.,"Herndon, VA",2,22,2,3.0,1/28/2015,"I ate at multiple BJ's locations all over the place and always enjoyed their food and service. Our waitress today did not seem to want to be here so she rolled her eye on me for asking her a simple question about the wings sauce! Luckily the manager stepped in for the rescue and replaced her with a person who actually likes her job. Anyways, the wings and pizza here are ALWAYS good! Looking into it further, it's seems like most reviews online agree on the bad service part and the good food."
Gilbert G.,"Vienna, VA",3,116,43,2.0,12/16/2014,"Came here for Sunday dinner in December with my wife and 2 sons (9 yrs., 7 yrs).  It was not very crowded at 6pm, but more people arrived closer to 7pm.   I had high expectations after driving by BJ's, which is visible from Route 7 across from the Tysons Corner mall, but the quality of food was less than stellar.   PROS:  Free garage parking was convenient.  Also, the spacious dining room was clean.  The huge TV screens overhead made it possible to watch two professional football games simultaneously. The kid's menu was also a big hit with the two boys.  The highlight of dinner was the beer (Brewhouse Blonde), which was delicious.   CONS:  Service can be slow and unenthusiastic. We tried it twice on a Friday evening and Sunday, but had similar experiences. The pizza was awful and way too salty - it reminded me of Mrs. Celeste's frozen pizza from a box. I liked the chicken tortilla soup, but it was a bit salty.    Overall, this place has great beer and a wide, spacious dining room.  However, the poor service and pizza quality need a lot of improvement.  If you're just getting beer and/or stick to a few items (chicken tortilla soup)  - this is a great place!"
Ralph C.,"Signal Hill, CA",43,191,2,4.0,7/26/2015,"Being from California we are very familiar with the chain. Went on a Sunday afternoon, it was dead. Pizza was awesome, as expected. I love the deep pan dough. My wife had the ahi poke...mostly tuna and very yummy. We also had the calamari which was ok, most of the breading had fallen off.  Had pizookie for dessert and all enjoyed. Server was very friendly but a little slow. My son just moved here and is happy to have found them."
Jane T.,"Vienna, VA",31,5,4,4.0,11/5/2013,"I heard about BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse through a colleague of mine and how they were doing a week-long soft opening which included free food. Unfortunately, I heard it last minute and wasn't able to get a reservation in but I decided to go this past weekend. The location is easy to get to, just across from Tysons Corner mall off Leesburg Pike where Bertucci's used to be. Parking was a breeze and was easy to find. It was a cold evening, so it was nice that we could take the elevators from the garage straight to the restaurant. The restaurant is nice and open with lots of big screen TV's for you sports fanatics. We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess and was seated in a nice booth close to the bar. I don't drink beer, but my friend decided to order the eight glass beer sampler ($13) which was a great way to try out their handcrafted beers. In addition, we ordered two appetizers, the corn fritters (served with a bacon aioli) and ""EXXXXtra Hot' boneless wings. The corn fritters were good. Very soft, light, and fluffy. The boneless wings, however, were mediocre at best. They weren't very spicy (given my high tolerance for spicy food) and were dry, as in there was no sauce except for the ranch dipping sauce. Still tasty, but I probably wouldn't order those again. As for the entrees, we ordered the Grilled Burger Melt and Balsamic Glazed Chicken. I didn't get to taste the burger, but the Balsamic Glazed Chicken was simply delicious! It came with cheddar mashed potatoes, field greens, caramelized onions, crispy onion strings, and the glazed chicken. I definitely recommend if you want something on the semi-lighter side. Overall I had a great experience. The staff was super friendly, food was good, and the restaurant had a relaxed atmosphere. We didn't get to try their infamous ""Pizookies"", but we will definitely be going back to try that and more."
Christine G.,"Playa del Rey, CA",115,29,,3.0,7/11/2015,"BJ's is a California chain, and I've been coming to BJ's for years, particularly for the pizza, BBQ chopped chicken salad, and pazookie!  This chain location is hit or miss. Sometimes the service is terrible, which I deal with bc I know this to be a solid chain but prob wouldn't tolerate otherwise."
Radhika K.,"Merrifield, Fairfax, VA",5,19,13,4.0,7/25/2015,Yummy pizza! We got the Hawaiian deep dish which was just fabulous. Service is great. I'l be goin there again Parking is a bit tricky for those coming for the first time.
Harold K.,"Vienna, VA",15,2,1,3.0,2/8/2015,"So my friend and I went there last night for dinner. Food was really good. The deep dish pizza was really good. Not Chicago but still awesome.   What really turned me off from the place was the service. It was mediocre at best. Firstly, we were seated immediately which was nice. The hostess who seated us was very friendly. We had a nice two person booth. Would have liked a bigger booth but we didn't mind.  Then it basically went downhill from there. It was almost 15 minutes before anyone even came by for our orders. After waiting for almost 15 minutes, one guy comes along, tells us our server will be along in a bit and takes our drink orders. I get a beer and my friend gets some goofy mocktail. The drinks never come though. It's almost 10 minutes later when our server comes along to take the food order.  We order the pizza and tell her we already ordered our drinks. She tells us the guy forgot what we ordered but she can take it again. My thought at this point is if he forgot, why didn't he come back and ask again.   Anyway, food comes out really fast. Either it was already prepared or some magic happened. But it was good. No complaints in the food. Halfway through the meal, our server comes back to ask if we're doing alright. We ask for a coke and a water. That never comes. We only see our server one more time after that and that is when we get our check. Really disappointed in the service. Food's good though. Well the pizza is atleast. And the beer too. Beer was fantastic."
Elizabeth R.,"Arlington, VA",3,13,30,5.0,7/25/2015,The deep dish Buffalo Chicken Pizza will forever be my favorite!!!! A great starter is the Santa Fe Rolls and Lettuce Wraps.
Elina Y.,"Washington, DC",271,236,206,4.0,1/6/2014,"My first two visits were strictly the bar and bar food. Try their avocado rolls, you won't be disappointed. Generous warm chunks of avocado with tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, and spices. MmmMmmm... The third visit we tried their well-known pizzas: BJ's Favorite, Spicy Meatball and Barbecue Chicken. The pizzas were not too shabby, I would definitely order them again. But not only was I content with the quality of the pizza, but their customer service really blew me away. When we were nearly finished with our first pizza, one of our friend's found a piece of hair on his slice. We told our waitress and the manager immediately came to our table to personally apologize and took the pizza off our tab. We were still hungry so we ordered a second pizza. Halfway through the second pizza, our waitress informs us that our second pizza has been taken off the tab as well. They did enough by sincerely apologizing and taking it off our tab, but taking care of both pizzas? It was very generous and shows that they truly care about how their patrons are taken care of at their restaurant.  Also, the boyfriend and I love Jameson shots with pickle back. So the waitress (and bartender from a previous visit) went to the kitchen to find pickle juice for us. And they even bought it out in pretty glassware. Look at my pics to see.  They have a happy returning customer, that's for sure. Cheers!"
Laura J.,"Vienna, VA",13,4,,1.0,11/21/2016,"do not go to the Vienna, VA BJs Restaurant, the service has gone way down. Very unfriendly staff. The worst waitress is Jessica L. If you decide to go, ask to be seated not in her section. Very rude and unresponsive waitress. She should be fired. We are done with BJ's. Oh well, Tysons area has ton of restaurants. No loss."
Tim M.,"Chesterfield, VA",6,7,13,4.0,8/3/2015,"Visiting the area with family. We arrived about 6:35 PM on a Monday evening. We were seated immediatley and had enough time to order 2 drinks each for Happy Hour (3 PM - 7 PM). The beer selection is impressive. I ordered the Jeremiah Red and my date ordered the Piranah Pale Ale. We were both impressed with the flavors of our beers. Very impressed. We also ordered mojitos. She ordered the strawberry and I ordered the regular. Again, the work at the bar was impressive. Very good drinks that were very well made. For the appetizer, we ordered the calamari. We love the fact that both rings and regular fried squid were served. The ring were cooked perfectly, the squid, however, were way over-cooked.  For the entrees, my date ordered the Chicken Barbacos and I ordered the Deep Dish Ravioli. First, I made the mistake of not ordering what my date ordered. That was the best low-calorie chiken I have ever eaten. My second mistake was ordering a good ravioli. The quantity in the deep dish really required me to consider how in the hell I was getting back to the hotel without requiring a crane.  The sauce was a.little too sweet for me, and that is saying a lot. For dessert, we ordered the strawberry bingnet.  My date is more of a chicolate fan, but did enjoy this sinful little dessert. All-in-all, anvery giod meal with one minor flaw of overcooked calamari and a relatively new server."
Navita B.,"Derwood, MD",8,4,9,2.0,2/7/2016,"Went here to watch a basketball game on a Saturday afternoon. Extremely disappointed as this is supposed to be a sports bar/brew house. Instead of having the volume on during the game, they had some dull music playing. The restaurant was dead at 4pm, everyone was there to watch the game but they wouldn't turn on the volume on the TVs. ..really lame. The Calamari was oily, the fries portion was enough for a small child. I guess the pizza was good, but I didn't have any."
Raymond W.,"Lusby, MD",1,11,2,3.0,7/12/2015,"Good food and nice atmosphere, but the wait staff left something to work on.  Our waiter was less than attentive and the empty glasses were not bussed until  near the end of the meal.  We also noticed that other tables were not bussed at all. Probably go back(it was our 4th time there), but it will not be on our regular Tysons Corner area restaurant rotation."
Jimmy D.,"Riverview, Tampa Bay, FL",138,31,17,3.0,3/27/2016,"It was mediocre, pricey for the quality. Service was really good. It was 4 of us. I ordered a watermelon basil margarita, but they didn't have any watermelon for one their signature drinks. I got the jalepeno cucumber margarita instead. It was way too sweet, no spice. There were japs slices. Definitely not muddled or shaken thoroughly.  The clam chowder was good. The salmon was soho. Ribs were nice. Fries and sides came out a little cold, it was warm, not hot."
Cyndy K.,"Honolulu, HI",275,773,13932,3.0,2/8/2014,"Cyndy's Bottom Line:  Another chain restaurant/bar that serves up drinks and food in a large fun atmosphere. Met a friend for lunch and was surprised how big the bar area and the dining room is.  First thought was it is a great place for happy hour! I ate a BJ Brewhouse burger with cheese.  I ordered the burger medium done and it arrived medium with the delicious crispy thin fries. They have a secret sauce for the burger called the Brewmommy sauce.  Gotta love the name.  Leave it to a chain restaurant to come up with a jingle... I choose to have the sauce on the side just in case I didn't like it.  The Brewmommy sauce was tasty saltiness.  My friend didn't like it and thought that it had no character just salty.  I on the other hand love salt so I did enjoy it.  We asked what was in there and it is made with Dijon mustard, and BJ's secret spices.  I forgot the rest of it. :( The burger looked like it was hand made and it is served on a nice soft parmesan bun.  I liked the bun which was perfect for the burger not to overwhelm it.  It is served with grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.   The burger was yummy and I loved the crispy thin fries which was nicely seasoned."
