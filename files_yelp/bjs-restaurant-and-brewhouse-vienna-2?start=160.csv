Matt H.,"Ashburn, VA",9,296,20,5.0,5/3/2015,"Excellent food; from the pizza, to the burgers, to the salmon, to the salads, everyone in our party loved their food! The server was fantastic as well.  He was very up beat, proactive on drinks, and probably one of the best servers we've had in a very long time."
Foodie C.,"McLean, VA",5,361,17,4.0,1/18/2015,Solid restaurant that had some growing pains in the beginning but with great service and managers who are always trying to make us feel at home.  We have been here several times and plan to come here often.  Make sure you have a Pizookie for dessert it makes the meal!
Ardy E.,"Fairfax, VA",12,102,2,2.0,9/11/2014,"I hope this place closes down and gets replaced sooner than later. You may be wondering why I gave it 2 stars though. I'll explain that at the end. I came here with some friends, 5 to be exact, to watch Monday Night Football. It was relatively busy but nothing that should warrant the staff to be overwhelmed by any means. We all sat at the bar and did all of our ordering from there. Things started out fine, we got our initial beers/drinks and started to settle in. By the time we wanted to get our 2nd rounds, the server was no where in sight for at least 10 minutes. OK. No biggie. He finally comes back around and we get our orders in. The drinks came one at a time, slowly, in fact one of them never even got his drink. We decided to move to the other side of the bar in hopes that we would be more visible. His son was there and he ordered food, it arrived and he said he tasted great, some pasta and chicken dish. The rest of us ordered wings and the particular flavor we ordered was not what we got, so the kitchen mixed up, not a big deal, we still ate it, this flavor was mediocre at best. Another friend proceeded to celebrate our evening by ordered us all a round of shots, he ordered them from what appeared to be the bar manager (not sure to be honest), 40 minutes later they never arrived. At this point I was fed up. Too many little things end up becoming a big thing when you add it all up. When we brought all of this to what I believed to be the bar manager's attention, she brought us out the incorrectly ordered wings as we are ready to leave and then provided us with a complementary birthday dessert (FYI: it was also a birthday for one of us) and when we asked for additional spoons, they never came either. Really? Although they tried to make up for the multiple mis-steps that accumulated along the way, it was too little too late. I will NEVER go back. I can't speak for my friends, but I am fairly certain they agree with my sentiment. Service needs to be done right the first time around, playing make-up after the fact is a path down a dark road. We ended up leaving before the first game ended and went across the street to what became a much better experience... read my review of Paladar if you want. On a side note, the bar manager insisted that they were the best place to watch football in the general vicinity, as if there wasn't another bar within spitting distance. Oh how wrong you were. About the 2nd star. The dessert was pretty damn delicious. I really wish their chef and pastry chef leave BJ's and join a more customer service conscience restaurant really soon, when you do let me know so I can stop by and say hi. Please."
Anh N.,"Arlington, VA",85,113,99,2.0,2/28/2015,Only went here for happy hour.  Drinks were watered down and very sweet. Food was ok.
Adam P.,"Falls Church, VA",10,13,11,1.0,8/14/2014,Ummm...wow... So I went to BJ's today with two co-workers. My napkin was filled with crumbs so that was a turn off. Then we ordered and our food arrived before our water did which was very strange. One of my co-workers ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich which came out in about 2 minutes. The waiter said the sandwich was already made for another table and was made incorrectly. It felt very awkward.  Our waiter acted very much like he didnt care much about the quality of food or service. The manager came to out table 4 different times and was apologetic each time but did nothing to fix anything. She just kept saying she was sorry but didnt make any efforts to correct any wrong-doings. We ordered dessert with 20 minutes left before we had to leave to get back to work. The dessert took 20 minutes to come out and we asked for it to go because we were going to be late. They brought it out on a plate like normal. We then asked for them to just bring the check which took at least 10 minutes. The manager then said she wanted to make things better and to wait. We said we didnt have time too but she asked us too. So we sat and she went away and after a few minutes she brought us coupons for free dessert which we indicated we didnt want.  Such a terrible experience all around. The food wasnt bad at all but the service and lack of enthusiasm or general care made it pretty awful...
David K.,"Vienna, VA",1,32,1,3.0,8/9/2014,"I'll make this short and to the point. I work close and have had several experiences at this location. *Service is mostly terrible, I've waited 30 minutes for a sandwich on a slow afternoon. Seems like little training for employees leaves them  unprepared to handle customers. On a busy rush, the waiters run around like crazy, and can be heard complaining about everything from the bartender to the cooks. *Food pretty good. Menu is way too big though. They have some great items and some good items. Better than most commercial chains *Went once during a USA world cup game and the Manager refused to turn the volume up so people at the bar could here the game. The bar was PACKED with people watching USA and you won't turn it up?? Poor service.  To sum up, go when its not busy and hope the cooks don't lose your order."
Wendy R.,"Falls Church, VA",0,11,,3.0,4/5/2016,"I usually like their food, but the last time I ordered to go I was missing a lot of items, Also my burger was not well prepared,. I will most likely go again because the food is usually very good.. Just sometimes the customer service slacks a little."
Barbara F.,"Fairfax, VA",43,16,,5.0,4/15/2016,"I've never had a bad meal, bad service, bad anything here!  Seriously, this place is that good. The drinks are generous as well as the food portions. There's never a push back when you ask for a modification of a menu item. Obviously, I will return!"
Molly M.,"Newington, CT",216,11,,1.0,3/5/2016,I have never left a restaurant before being served but unfortunately I didn't meet my server after being seated for over 10 minutes. That sounds dramatic but the problem was that there were ample staff hanging around and walking past our table. Pretty frustrated we left and walked around the corner to Chilis... Currently drinking a delicious cocktail and my order is already in. I'd probably still be sitting there with an empty stomach full of disappointment.
Bernadette S.,"Washington, DC",65,339,247,3.0,2/8/2014,"Party of 7.5 on a busy saturday night seated in the bar area. Service was great!  They give samples of the beers. I am not a beer person but one of them was really tasty. Had a fruity taste to it and it was really good! We had the basics, pizza and dessert pizza and both were really good. The pizza cookie dessert makes you crave for more. I recommend the white chocolate macadamia and the red velvet.  This was only our first time but we will definitely come back again to try more of their items.  Also, we learned that this BJs location is one of the few that looks like this, lots of TVs and big bar area, more modernized. Less cookie cutter looking like its other locations in the west coast."
C R.,"Washington, DC",18,247,32,4.0,11/23/2014,"Great great food. Had an urge for a burger.  Decided to get the crispy jalapeno.  Deep fried breaded jalapeno, pepper jack cheese.  A bit spicy, but not overwhelming.  Had it with fries, which were thin and crispy.  On top of the burger, had peanut butter pizookie, which was amazingly sweet.  Came with icecream.  Excessively sweet yet still soooo good. Lose 1 star bc service wasn't as quick as I would've preferred for a seemingly slow and easy weeknight. Due to my experience with the food, I would like to come back to try other things."
Kai S.,"Washington, DC",3,16,9,1.0,11/28/2015,"This location sucks! Waitress didn't take our menus back after we ordered. Forgot to bring back drink refills, and acted like how was she supposed to know. Didn't remove dirty plates when we ordered dessert. Didn't remove them when dessert came. And she had the nerve to be training someone else! She was just rude. The food was all blah. My meal meal was wayyy over salted, and our entire party just wasn't impressed. I felt bad because I rave about the laurel location, and this was their first time to this restaurant. Well it's mine to this location. Never again!"
Tony M.,"Annandale, VA",225,12,37,4.0,3/1/2015,"Always forget to check in, had some time today. Good atmosphere no wonder velocity 5 closed near by. This is where I meet often for discussions. Hollar if you're near by, my treat ;)"
Marc L.,"North Bethesda, MD",17,331,141,4.0,1/17/2014,"I am working at a client located down the street from BJ's, and because I love brewpubs, decided to check it out. Glad I did. Great atmosphere: cheerful, modern, spacious, clean, sparkling with metal and wood. Bunch of TVs tuned to sports channels. Bartender told me that on game days they turn up the sound on the main game.  Beer selection was outstanding: about 8 home brews, and another 20 or so outstanding commercial/national brands. If you're a beer drinker, you'll be happy with the selections. Bartender let me try 4 beers, of which I selected two. Both were excellent (Brewhouse Blonde and Piranha Pale Ale). I also had the fish tacos (Mahi Mahi) which were excellent. Came with a guacamole-like sauce and a tangy sauce, both of which were excellent. Service was outstanding. I will be back!"
Simay O.,"Burke, VA",356,63,70,4.0,1/3/2015,"I came here tonight to watch my basketball team play. It's quite nice and roomy inside! I liked the big glass windows functioning as the two walls around the restaurant and the seats that wrap around the bar. There are a good number of TVs so that if you're sitting at the bar you can definitely watch your team but you can also sit at a location where you won't feel surrounded by sports fans. There were bachelors just enjoying beer and football as well as families eating Saturday night dinner. Their menu says that happy hour is Monday-friday 3-7pm however it's Saturday and they still offered the happy hour! They have a great selection of Craft beers, ones you won't often find at other bars, which were only $4 during happy hour. My friend and I ordered deep dish mini pizzas which are $6 during happy hour and they were delicious ( the great white and the Mediterranean)! I highly recommend this place for a relaxing and enjoyable happy hour!"
Ann W.,"Fairfax, VA",0,40,25,3.0,3/23/2014,"Love the spacious restaurant at Tyson's' corner. The beer, food and service are great!  Thank you for opening one in here, we missed it a lot moving from CA. ** we still love their pizza but the service in this location is not very efficient and some are rude. Highly suggest to use the BJ's app to preorder either take-out or dine-in, and use the app to pay the bill when you are done, this could save you a lot of time waiting for your slow waiter to serve you. ( plus you could tip really according to their service)"
Ron H.,"North Bethesda, MD",32,74,86,4.0,1/10/2015,"Good service, not too crowded, great beer selection and decent deep dish pizza. What I love about this place is this warm cookie topped with ice cream called pizookies. It's a simple little dessert that hits the right notes."
Jennifer R.,"Sterling, VA",0,5,1,5.0,3/14/2016,Went on Friday night for dinner. Our server was fabulous and the service was quick and amazing. Had Mahi tacos were yummy and hubby had baked ziti. Also had dessert trio cookies. So good would go back!
Le L.,"Annandale, VA",151,220,313,4.0,6/9/2014,"We decided to give this place a try a friday evening when we tried to figure out where to eat next. This place located in Tysons Corner area (across from tyson 1, same building with nordstrom rack). We came here right before dinner, so the restaurant was packed. I love this place because there were a lot of TV to catch up on sports while you have dinner with your friends or love ones. The bar was crowded and all tables were also full. We got two people booth table and it was near the TV so I was happy with that.  The service was definitely above average for a busy friday night for them. The waiter for our table always come back to check on us and make sure we have enough attention from him. He made us feel welcome even though he was running around and helped the tables that weren't even for him. That is the kind of service needs recognition. The food quality was okay, I wouldn't say it is the best but its a little above average. I ordered pasta ( I believe) and the type of chicken I ordered ran out, so the manager for that night came out to apologized and ask if it was okay to substitute with something. I didn't mind any substitution. I would definitely come back again when I'm in the area and want to grab a dinner, it is a great atmosphere to grad dinners with friends here when you try to watch sports or something. very chill place."
Carolyn M.,"Washington, DC",0,58,,5.0,10/30/2014,"Seriously this place is awesome.  Cheap food, great service, diverse menu.  We keep coming back.  They should really open one in N. Arlington bc it would be so packed!  Although I kind of like that about the Tysons one that we can walk in any time and get a seat at the bar.  Can't speak to the table service but the bartenders are amazing.  We've had dinners there and they are quick to serve.  Last weekend we spent a couple hours there and the bartender went above and beyond to help us try different drinks so we could figure out what we want for our wedding signature cocktail.  Very creative and resourceful!   Pizza is great and their mini salads are a perfect snack. Don't even get me started on the pizzokie!"
