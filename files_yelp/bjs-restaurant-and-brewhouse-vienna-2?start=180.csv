Czarina R.,"Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, MD",64,28,35,5.0,6/10/2014,"I love this place! Try their beer on tap 'Berry Burst cider"". Also try their grilled porkchops, its juicy and tender! If you sign up for their membership program(free) you will earn points and also sometimes receive offers like free dessert, or bogo."
Jaide T.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,40,18,4.0,1/16/2016,"First time being here. I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger with the thin cut fries & he ordered the mini size 5 meat gourmet pizza with the potato wedge fries. My burger was ehhh. The patty was burnt, which is the only thing I tasted mostly, the fries were good and so was the sauce that came with it (like really good - a little spicy). He said his pizza was really good & also were the potato wedge fries -- I kept stealing them from him - I recommend them over the thin fries! Our waiter was Rick - he's basically the reason why I'm giving them 4 stars - he was absolutely amazing because out of all the years I've been at restaurants he's the only person that asked if we wanted one check or two. Idk why I was so amazed but I was because it can save a lot hassle in the end even thought that wasn't our case. Also, I NEVER had to ask for refills. Once I had a few sips left, he came right away with a new one. My friend says that the Orange Creme Soda was ""sooooo good""."
Greg W.,"Houston, TX",9,186,151,1.0,1/15/2016,Might be one of the worst breweries I've ever visited. I ordered a sirloin steak medium. The steak looked like it had either been sitting in water for a week or was defrosted in the microwave. The inside was rare. Absolutely disgusting.  Our waiter kept forgetting my beer. She probably came by our table 3 times in an hour & the place was 1/3 full. The other half of the waiters were mostly African American & they were literally laying down & napping in the empty booths near the bathroom. I felt like I was at a train station in Baltimore. I'll never go back to this place. My coworkers & I were extremely disappointed.
Antonio M.,"Washington, DC",342,401,727,3.0,10/25/2013,"Nice huge open area. The bar has an immense tower of booze with probably one if the BIGGEST TVs I've ever seen! The staff are all friendly, attentive and well polished for such a new establishment. We had the calamari which was tasty and perfectly cooked. My entree was a creole tilapia. Which had a tasty fish covered in a sauce made of caper and olives. The fish was perfectly cooked although I didn't care for the sauce. The salt of the capers along with the bitter vinegar of the olives overpowered the entire dish. I preferred the fish on its own. My coworker had the chicken sandwich which came with a generous serving of Fred potato wedges. See pic  The service was spot on and very attentive. I was a bit surprised that their beer is not brewed in house but at some other location. I was really hoping to get some fresh brews here in the TyCo area."
Zara M.,"Chantilly, VA",10,17,52,2.0,7/10/2014,Came here for my birthday. Service was awful food was not that great. The one in Gainesville is better.
Tim R.,"Tysons Corner, Mclean, VA",1,48,,3.0,6/19/2014,"Terrrrrrrrible bar service.  Three guys behind the bar, you'd think they could keep up? Asked for a water while I scanned the list of many brews they have to choose from. Never got it and he never came back.  EVER. They ignore your empty glass. They ignore your cc in the glass, even though they ""see"" you put it there.  Typical bar food..only had appetizers.  Great atmosphere. 90"" big screens at the bar.  Bar area gets crowded early."
Frank H.,"Sandy Bottom, NC",1,92,87,2.0,6/21/2014,"This is the second time at BJs.  The first was outstanding the Manager was there and all the Staff was abuzz.  This time, no hint of the manager...  The Staff was relaxed and not customer focused.  We had to wait for someone to seat us at one of the many open tables.  The waitress was not sure what beers were on tap.  When the meal was delivered the they thought I was drinking Cream Soda and tried to serve me another, I was drinking beer...  I am not so sure I will return."
Tay L.,"Vienna, VA",59,198,431,1.0,6/5/2014,"I've been here numerous times and every time I visit,  something goes wrong...mostly the issues are with the servers. Ex. Forgetting to put drink/food order, not bringing something when it was requested numerous times, someone else's item on my tab..and the list goes on and on. Food is just okay too. I'd skip this place and find other options around tysons."
Michael W.,"Falls Church, VA",1,7,6,2.0,7/11/2014,"This was our third visit to this BJ's and our most disappointing. It's only because of past visits that I'm giving 2-stars instead of one.  We actually planned ahead before visiting and decided to take advantage of the ""Call Ahead Waiting"" advertised on their website. I called the restaurant, 703.356.7305, and followed the prompts. ""For Call Ahead Waiting for parties of 1-6 people, Press 2."" No problem, I was connected to (I assume) the front desk. After their perfunctory greeting, I informed them I was calling ahead to get on the waiting list. ""How many?"" she asked. ""Three."" This is where things took a turn.  ""Oh, I'm sorry. We can only do reservations for 6+."" No, no, I explained. I'm on my way and want to get on the waiting list. She told me in various ways that they don't do that for fewer than 6+ and they could not guarantee we'd get a table. I told her in various ways that I wasn't making reservations, but calling to get added to the wait list. It was Friday evening, so I assumed there was one. She could have told me there wasn't a wait, but instead it required serious effort to get her to grudgingly take my name and ask for an estimate of when we'd arrive. We arrived, were seated, and looked at our menus - at least after we were forced to specifically request a child's menu for our 3-year old. We ordered a a BJ's Hand-Tossed Pizza (BJ's Favorite w/Artichoke Hearts), a salad (Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad), and a child's meal (Grilled Chicken Pasta). The salad was disappointing, but not awful. The pizza, however, was just wrong. On the first try they delivered a pizza with the toppings sliding off one side - and it was missing the artichoke hearts. We sent it back. The second pizza had the required toppings and they weren't falling off the pizza, but the crust was hard. Not quite burned, but overcooked, without a discernible flavor, no texture other than hard, AND light on the toppings. If this had been our first pizza at BJ's, it would have been our last - and probably our last visit. (If you get the pizza, get the Signature Deep Dish. The Hand-Tossed is crap.) There were other little things, like our waiter never coming to refill our water (we were also drinking beer, but an empty water glass is an empty water glass) but nothing was nearly as disappointing as the food. Other visits have been better (not great, but better), but this one will take some time to recover from. Maybe we'll be back for a deep dish pizza. Maybe we'll be back for a burger. But not for a while."
Taylor M.,"Cary, NC",0,137,1,3.0,6/26/2014,"Bar food.  Decent beer.  Spotty and inattentive service.   I usually provide a more detailed review, but as I look at this, I think it says it all."
Margaret C.,"Falls Church, VA",46,114,132,3.0,6/28/2014,"I've been a fan of BJ's since I first frequented them in California and was glad to see them pop up on the East Coast this winter. The dining room is large with a very spacious bar area and big TVs. Our server was really sweet and very helpful. They have one of my fav brews on tap, Kona Big Wave, so I was inclined to like them. We ordered the Santa Fe egg rolls as a starter. They were yummyy with two dipping sauces, but it was a very large portion. My hubs ordered the fried chicken which included corn and mashed potatoes with gravy. It was yummy and also pretty big (he brought home the second chicken breast). I ordered my old standby--the sweet pig deep dish pizza. Yummy, but a little too heavy on the garlic. We brought home pieces of that as well. This is a great place for a quick meal or to watch the game on the weekend. They also have a pretty nifty app you can download and pay with your phone. If you're in a hurry, this can be a real plus as you can also use the app to order ahead of arrival. You also get great coupons."
Sara S.,"Falls Church, VA",5,16,1,4.0,5/21/2014,"I love this place for what it is - a laid back casual dining restaurant and great place to grab drinks and watch sports with friends. The food is classic American fare with a really good mix. I was originally pretty obsessed with their deep dish pizza but then found their salads which are awesome. (Yes I know...I went from pizza to salad...I have an internal battle every time I step in there.) The beer selection is great. I recommend trying out the beer flight to taste a bunch of different types they offer. My favorite is the Jeremiah Red. Happy hour goes till 7 and then starts back up at I believe 9 or 10. During football season they have cheap beer and food specials the entire time that games are on TV - which have I mentioned the TVs are HUGE? I've gotten take-out multiple times. You can order online and there's a separate pick up area for take-out to get you in and out of there quickly.  Finally, I highly recommend signing up for their rewards program. Not only do you earn points towards free food and prizes but they regularly email coupons for special deals like free mini pizzas or free appetizers."
Jenn K.,"Reston, VA",92,465,59,5.0,4/21/2014,"I really liked BJs and it was better than I expected after pre-reading the Yelp reviews.  Heres a short sum up of my experience -the location isnt great (heart of Tysons traffic hell) to get to but at least its not very far away -Service was good- no problems. And thats bonus bc I was there with a big group on a Sat night.  -Its a very big place. Plenty of room for large groups. It worked out well for a friend's birthday party -The mixed drink I had was ""meh"" too sweet/expensive. would opt for something else next time -large, fantastically enticing looking menu selection!  ( I made the mistake of not coming here hungry and boy, did I regret it! No room for delicious deep dish pizza!) -And.... the best part (drum roll!) The  Piezooki. Weird name, probably a million calories AND...totally worth it!   I broke diet for this one it was soo good. (okay, actually I had two. So good, we ordered a second one to share!)  Its a warm, ooey gooey cookie type creation served up in a little frying pan.  Get it. You'll be glad."
Aleksandr S.,"Santa Clara, CA",33,46,7,3.0,9/1/2015,"I'm not a big fan of BJ's restaurant network but because it was known to me I went there instead of anything else around. This one wasn't the best one I've seen before. I don't know why but I've got strong feeling of McDonalds or something like this. Food was pretty good (I've took Pasta, Caesar salad and Burger). I've got Caesar salad only at the end of dinner :( One glass for a beer wasn't cleared enough but not critically. Another one was good. If I would writing this review right after visit it may be a little bit more negative than now :)"
Yasmin M.,"Leesburg, VA",1,2,,4.0,4/29/2014,"This place has pretty damn good American fare with a page numbered menu.  -quite a novel here!  There is literally something for everyone, and you can have some good beers or interesting beer concoctions with your meal.  I tried the Irish Berry Burst with the Berry Cider and Guiness.  It was kind of sweet yet refreshing.  -probably not for guys though.  My bf hated it. Honesty, all the food we ordered was great.  They have a plethora of enticing appetizers.  So we did it tapas style and feasted with a menu on the side in case we were hungry for more.   The stuffed mushrooms...  We inhaled them! All this was not enough, so the bf ordered a cup of chili and me the minestrone.  What a way to end a fun meal.  The chili was robust and flavorful.  My minestrone totally exceeded my expectations with the loaded vegetables, kidney beans and some fusilli.  It came with some parmesan to sprinkle on top too. This place is super big and lofty.  It has a fun atmosphere with tons of TV's. The murals on the wall are great too.   This was our first time here and our server was great.  I wish I knew his name, but he was a black guy with long braids.  -very attentive, personable and solicitious.  All this great service and knowledge with a joking personality to go with!  You bet we'll be back!"
Amanda K.,"Arlington, VA",405,109,165,5.0,9/19/2015,We had the Siracha dry rub wings. Delish! Great appetizer. Comes with 10 wings. I had the berry cider. It's refreshing. Probably one of my favorite ciders ever. We split the small deep dish pizza between two people and it was plenty. We did half pepperoni extreme and half buffalo. My boyfriend said the crust was the best he has ever had. It was light and buttery. Service was excellent as well. We will definitely keep coming back for more!
Neda P.,"Sterling, VA",0,14,2,5.0,1/14/2016,Ahhh where do I start- get the Santa Fe rolls for apps everything here is amazing! I love the clam chouder and Atlantic salmon- for dessert salted caramel pazookie is to die for :0!!!
Seth S.,"Silver Spring, MD",34,10,,1.0,12/12/2015,Service sucks period. Waitress left and Never came back second experience in a row with the same issue. Food and beer are good but service is terrible not getting any better
Mike M.,"Birmingham, AL",53,310,19,4.0,6/4/2014,"First visit.  Nice place, I have major TV envy over the huge Panasonic hanging over the bar.  Must be 108"" or something like that.  Large TV's everywhere but still an upscale, high end restaurant feel.  Very friendly and professional staff.  Prices are high which seemed to have no impact on the crowd on a Tuesday evening, the place was packed with guests ranging from the young'ish yuppie crowd to the more Sr. guest.  Figure $6+ beers, $10 - 12 apps, entrees starting around $15.  Some specials during happy hour but those special prices are also for smaller portions. We had a variety of apps, everything was very good.  Sliders, calamari, flat breads, egg rolls.  All tasty.  The other dishes I saw being served looked very good. There is an extensive menu ranging from pizza to steak, salads, seafood, to pasta.  It looks like a tough menu to keep up with but the kitchen seems to have it figured out.  There are maybe 50 or so taps, a mix of their own brews and some nice craft beer options, an extensive wine list, and an equally extensive cocktail menu. Nice place, good food, nice crowd, not cheap.  Looking forward to going back."
Carol P.,"Leesburg, VA",0,57,,1.0,4/9/2016,"Awful service, this was our first experience at this location and it sucked. I had to remind my waiter to bring our soft drinks, food was blah. We were sat by a door in the back, the employees seemed to be having a get together around us & then decided to go out and smoke, they would leave door half open and the smoke smell came inside. Makes me wonder if they all came in to wash hands before serving tables? We also had kids at our table and this was just unacceptable. We will never come here again."
