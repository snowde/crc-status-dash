April J.,"Fairfax, VA",10,15,2,2.0,2/5/2014,"Service was fine but sadly the food wasn't very good. Four of us went for a later dinner on Saturday night (around 9pm). We ordered 2 apps and 4 entrees  Fries Calamari: I don't eat this but the table seemed to enjoy it Spinach And Artichoke Dip: Ok, the chunks or artichokes were way to big. We each ordered a steak and with the exception of one person they horrible lay over cooked all of them. We all requested medium rare and we received well done. Yes, we should have sent them back but we were all grumpy and just wanted to get dinner over with at this point.  I, along with one other, ordered the sirloin and in addition to being well done, it was dry and flavorless (maybe that comes with being well done??).  I committed a major sin and put A1 steak sauce on my steak so I could finish it. The bf wasn't happy with his steak but he is what I like to call a garbage disposal so he finished everything on his plate-didn't finish mine though, so that's means he really wasn't thrilled with the place. I will say out of the two different beers we ordered, they were pretty good (blonde and hefeweizen) - the hefeweizen being the favorite.   No plans for a revisit in the future."
Stephen U.,"Alexandria, VA",116,18,,4.0,1/22/2014,"I had made a point in the last review that their chicken wings were very lacking, especially in comparison to my experiences at BJs in California. It seems that the preparation of the chicken wings last time was a ""rookie mistake"" because our server told us that the chicken wings are supposed to be prepared with a light drizzle of ranch and buffalo sauce on the nicely fried exterior of the wings. I was definitely glad to hear that! The entrees seemed to fair much better as well. You're not going to get Michelin quality food, but you will get food that tastes good and is executed cleanly.  I hope BJs continues to improve, as the interior of the restaurant is stunning. It is a wonderful place to have a drink (Jeremiah Red), grab a bite, and watch a game.  One last thing: if I were to rank restaurant brewery places in the DMV area I'd rank the Great American Restaurants (Coastal Flats, Sweetwater, Artie's etc) highest followed by BJs and Gordon Biersch."
Nick B.,"Arlington, VA",29,48,8,2.0,12/27/2014,"I've always like the food and the beer at BJ's, but the last visit was a service nightmare. I tend to be pretty forgive in the service area in general, but I ate my dinner with nothing to drink, sat for about 30 minutes with a wet napkin on the table after a water spill and no help cleaning it up, and had to ask 3 different people to get another balking after cleaning up my spill. I haven't been back since and probably won't."
Kevin L.,"New York, NY",4,171,,3.0,7/7/2015,"The service is average, the food quality decent, and the value a bit below average. The lunch specials are pretty small serving sizes, so the average person will leave hungry. One the other hand, they do have a few items that are tasty, especially the Lemon Thyme Chicken, which is the redeeming factor that saves this from being a mere 2 stars.  Don't get the unlimited soup & salad. The soups are really heavy and oily, and the salads overdressed."
Katrina K.,"Fairfax, VA",8,65,56,3.0,5/17/2014,"The menu is HUGE. I've been once to another BJ's in Kansas, and I forgot just how lengthy it is! This is definitely a family-friendly spot: everyone should be able to find something they like here. For dinner, I went with the fried chicken dish, which was a new addition. When it was delivered to me, it came with two large pieces of chicken, a decent sized scoop of potatoes, and some corn. I thought the chicken was well cooked - there was a good crunch on the fried coating. The potatoes were just okay, and the corn was a little bland. I was with my fiance and brother, and we all found the service to be pretty slow. The waitress was nice, but had no sense of urgency - long lengths of time would go by before orders were taken, drinks were refilled, the check was delivered, etc."
John D.,"Fairfax Station, VA",391,423,46,4.0,11/5/2013,"This place works for me. I went for lunch, and I picked up a parmesan-crusted chicken sandwich with balsamic and a brewnette brown ale. Both were good, and the prices were good too. It's a large open area, so you don't feel cramped. Service was excellent, almost too much so. We must have had eight different people come by our table at various points. The problem was, many of them asked the same questions that we had already answered. I'm looking forward to going back and testing out the rest of the menu. Their beer menu is one of the best in tysons (not saying much), and much better than the crap lagers at Gordon Biersch."
Paul C.,"Arlington, VA",2,166,290,1.0,2/4/2014,"I give it 1 star. Stopped in today for lunch and a beer. I'm an american IPA drinker( IPA is the ""Most Popular"" craft beer style in america) and was told that they were OUT of their brewery-made IPA. Only ""ONE"" BJ's brewed IPA on tap and they were out? I realize this is not an on- premises brewery(kegs are trucked in from another location), but that's no excuse for being out of the only IPA that is company brewed, if i wanted an IPA from another brewery, i would go elsewhere. I came here for the BJ's IPA. What a disappointment. I will stop in again, in hopes that they will then have a handle on ""supply and demand"". 2 strikes and your'e out."
Travis T.,"Great Falls, VA",32,19,1,5.0,8/27/2015,"I am a frequent customer at this restaurant.  The food is great.  I previously had Rebecca as my waitress and she was great.  I highly recommend the Parmesan Crusted Chicken.  The family also enjoys the salmon, pizza, hamburgers, and the sirloin.  For desert, you have to get a pazookie!  It is a half baked cookie with ice cream on top.  Pure genius.  I have had mediocre service in the past.  However, the food brings me back.  If you are looking for great service, ask for Rebecca.  I hope you enjoy."
Brian A.,"Arlington, VA",172,7,10,3.0,7/25/2014,We went to BJs for happy hour and it was good. The food and drinks were great but the service was very slow. We would order two drinks at a time to compensate. The atmosphere is lively and a nice mixture of younger and older crowd. I give 3 stars due to slow service otherwise it was good.
Mariela V.,"Arlington, VA",1,3,,5.0,7/23/2015,Very yummy food. Very good beer.  It's definitely a place to be for happy hours after work. My coworkers go there to release our stress after work.
Ding D.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/9/2015,"Avoid this place. My wife and I ordered from the take out menu and no one was manning the desk, and when they arrived, we asked if we can place an order, the guy said ""hmmm I guess?"" I did notice that they were more interested in talking amongst each other rather than serve customers.  Food is standard BJ'S however service deserves 0 or negative stars. No one was at this place and the order for 1 medium pizza took 40 minutes."
John A.,"Upper Marlboro, MD",57,180,123,5.0,12/13/2013,Guys this place is a winner. The happy hour drinks are legit...Jose for $4 you can't beat that. Shane was my server and he advised pretty well. I've been to the one in California and yes this one has a little ways to go but it will be there soon
Sam K.,"Washington, DC",0,28,6,2.0,1/24/2015,"Their service was great and the drinks (beer and cocktail) tasted good too.  But the trouble is with their food.  We had a lunch here, party of three people, and felt bloated all day and the evening.  I suspect the ingredients - processed and MSG-like artificial flavorings.  We all had constant thirst for water, no appetites due to bloat and massive amount of gas.  So, yea a little TMI, but if you are sensitive to MSG, you might want to stay away from their food.  But, the beers are pretty awesome."
Katrina L.,"Jersey City, NJ",26,39,,3.0,1/9/2014,"There's TV's everywhere, from every seating angle, so if you're trying to watch a game, this is a good place. To be honest, I wanted to give the food two stars, but I gave an extra star because of the good service I received and the decent beer. Please note, I'm not a ""beer person"", as my taste in beer lacks refinement. The waitress was really educated in the beers and gave us good recommendations. She also went out of her way to make sure my brother's food allergy was a priority. I went at a very slow time, just as lunch time was ending.  The lunch specials didn't look too special though, so my party went with full entrees. My mom really liked her fish & chips, but I didn't like my pulled pork BBQ that much. The best part was the onion crisps and bbq sauce. Pork was dry. Don't order the small plate corn bread ball thing, whatever that was, it was gross.  The calamari was the best thing I had there, but when you're next door to some of the best calamari in Tysons (Neisha) its not enticing me to come back."
Peter S.,"Washington, DC",0,9,,1.0,2/7/2015,"It's Friday's without sufficient front staff training.   Good beers and well made cocktails are easy to find. Add OK food, minus lousy service =  I won't be back.  Too bad because I liked the set up. So, they messed up our order - not a big deal - they acknowledged it and offered to make good.  Fine.  Wouldn't even drop them out of 4-5 stars for that. The problems:  1. After appetizers - nobody was willing to take away dirty plates and empty glasses.  Multiple servers bombarded us with our entree dishes, but nobody seemed to notice the dirty dishes and glasses crowding the table. Basic food service 101 fail.  It was noticeably gross, and just wierd. 2.  After we finished dinner we sat.  Then sat. Then sat.  Our server walked by time after time - wouldn't look at us so we couldn't get our check.  When she finally stopped by it was to tell us she had 2 tables she hadn't greeted yet so we would have to wait.  Hard to convey the attitude that was included in the statement. 3.  Manager who came by somewhere along the line and promised to be right back never showed until my wife got up and chased him down just to get a check to leave. 4.  Server stopped by t o collect check and convey more attitude, apparently trying to shame me into a full tip.  I rarely go below 20% but made an exception here. Next stop - research into what restaurant group holds this dud - if its publicly traded SELL."
Angela B.,"Honolulu, HI",642,8,279,4.0,11/1/2013,"The atmosphere & beer are make your trip here well worth it! I love the Irish red beer. The IPA is also very good! I tried the calamari & it was good, but average. I ordered the fish & chips(with wedge fries) and it was a large serving size. Fish was a bit over fried, but the fries were delicious. I also tried the bacon & cheddar burger. It had a great taste & good presentation. I had to send it back because it was undercooked. For dessert, I tried the hot cookie with ice cream (the Pizookie) & it was yummy!! This place has a very large (with ample seating) oval shaped bar in the center of the brewhouse! I love the decor. It's worth a visit for sure!"
Jen B.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",0,6,,4.0,6/28/2015,Large beer and food selection! Was with a group that had young children and they were on top of their food and drinks. Atmosphere was also great. Recommend!
Lucky D.,"Manassas, VA",0,95,28,3.0,11/14/2013,"Today I decided to venture out for lunch and try one of the new places in town.  Having heard about this brand from friends in the restaurant business and learning that is a successful competitor of CPK on the West Coast, I was curious. The place is vast and classy. The decor is retro-modern if that makes sense. Clean lines with modern finishes The ceilings are high, light fixtures large and fitting the immense space.  The host stand is unimpressive and subdued. Almost like an oversight by the design team. One large sunken dining room, easily to overlook from the bar area. As most modern creations, the kitchen is visible, separated by a wall of glass. The entire establishment is bathed in natural light, as both exterior walls are glass, allowing the sun to shine in.  I find that to be a rarity these days. Often windows are tightly covered with blinds, places so dark, one has to wonder if they don't want you to see what they are serving. As new as the place is, the regional manager still roaming the place, coaching and guiding the management team, the staff worked smoothly and calmly, instilling confidence in their service. I am impressed with how fast the place got up and running efficiently. Strangely enough, a manager did not visit to follow up on food or service.  The bar is large, in the corner of the restaurant. A few dozen different beers on tap. The variety interesting and plentiful for any beer lover.  Anyone familiar with Cheesecake Factory knows their extreme menu size. BJ's also believes more is better, offering a selection so large, it is overwhelming and difficult to navigate. One cannot be good at everything and today was a good example of that. Although the items very prepared quickly, memorable is not a word I would choose to describe them. The Corn Fritters looked appetizing but were nothing else but fried dough balls, similar to a hush-puppy. Four to an order, served on top of a sauce that is alike in appearance and flavor to a 1000 island dressing, sprinkled with real bacon bits.  Meatball pizza was prepared well and looked appetizing. Topped with chunks of ground beef, a far stretch from a meatball. Not what I expected, but perhaps the most flavorful of all dishes today. As far as pizza goes, it was a valid attempt to provide a quality product, but its just pizza. It only get so good. Parmesan Chicken, also well executed. Perfectly crusted and fried golden brown, looking just like the picture. Flavor fell flat, the entire dish was utterly bland.  I will probably stop in again, try something else on the menu and enjoy another one of their great selection of eclectic drafts. The atmosphere was pleasant enough to go back. Should the food not improve in flavor however, I will not return. In closing I'd say, try the place. Its a concept new to the area, the unknown and unfamiliar makes it exciting, but it's the food that gets you coming back, which at this point, I cannot recommend."
Kevin S.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,,2.0,11/19/2014,"I'm originally from California, so I've been to a few BJ's before. The service isn't as exceptional as the one I've gone to. I don't know if its the Tyson atmosphere or just the management they have their but they seem very rude and get annoyed when you as for things as little as more water. The food doesn't taste the same. I came for the red which is always exceptional."
Stephanie B.,"Rockville, MD",57,166,33,4.0,3/12/2014,"BJ's is a microbrew/sports bar chain from California, a lot like Gordon Biersch.   Pros: --Pizooke. It's a massive cookie/brownie like concoction with ice cream on top.  Nom, nom, nom.  It was always free on your birthday, so be sure to ask... --Pan pizza. I love both pan pizza and Chicago style--both are impossible to find in the DC Metro...everyone is so taken with NY Style or super trendy thin crust.  No, it's not Chicago style here, but it is damn good.  I'm willing to drive to Tyson's Corner all the way from Rockville just for this. --If you want to watch sports there are PLENTY of massive TVs.  Show up early if you want a seat...people tend to park it at the bar. --There is plenty of free parking in the garage...it's just not immediately obvious how to get to the restaurant and stay dry while it's raining. Cons: --Slow service, even during off peak hours (I sat at the bar at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, several hours before NFL playoff games).  This is not unique to this location, but a major problem I've experienced in the San Francisco Bay Area, too.  I wouldn't put up with it there, but this is the only location in the DC Metro, and I miss pan pizza...so I'll deal with it.  Basically, I'd be giving the BJs where I'm from 3 stars...but I'm homesick. --It's kind of expensive, but so is Gordon Biersch.  Expect to pay about $20/person. Bottom line: go when you're not in a rush and enjoy the food & atmosphere.  The menu is massive...a little something for everyone."
