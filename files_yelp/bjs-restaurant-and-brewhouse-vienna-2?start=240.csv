Charles C.,"Falls Church, VA",68,49,,4.0,5/22/2015,"Happy hour specials here are great and the beer is solid for the price. Food is good but nothing memorable. I tried the wings, motz sticks, and pizza. I decided on 4 instead of 3 stars because their happy hour specials are fairly cheap but don't taste like TGI Fridays. Avoid the mixed drinks though. Several of us got mojitos and it was just cocktail syrup in a glass. It was undrinkable. They need to work on their staffing. The waiter who served us was a champ, but he was severely under-helped. He was taking care of everyone at the bar booths."
Mina C.,"Falls Church, VA",57,407,90,2.0,11/12/2013,"omg. the food was okay. the service was AWFUL.  Maybe it's because this place is new, but jeez...  Our server constantly forgot to bring us items we asked for like hot sauce or silverware. We had to ask multiple times. He also constantly forgot who ordered what. He would give me a beer my friend ordered. Even before we got our beers, it practically mission impossible.. Our server came back more than 3 times to refresh his memory on what we ordered, and still the beers came out incorrectly.  It basically took forever to get anything, and get anything right. When we asked for the check, he added an item on there that no one even ordered.... I probably won't be back just based on service."
Carolyn M.,"Alexandria, VA",14,124,25,4.0,12/18/2013,"My roommate, L, and I decided to try the newly opened BJ's on Leesburg Pike after our nearby church service.  She's from Chicago and a big fan of their deep-dish pizza. I'm a New Yorker and prefer a thin crust. I was willing to give it a try though because she had frequented the restaurant when living on the West Coast and was a fan.  Parking was underground and free with easy access to the restaurant and a reprieve from the wet and cold weather outdoors.  I was expecting beer and pizza but was pleasantly surprised that it offered much, much more. We were greeted by very friendly staff and our server was also friendly with a good sense of humor.  The space was wide open and covered from stem to stern with large screen HD televisions showing football games from DC and about a half dozen other cities.  Large windows provided a glimpse of the heavy snowflakes coming down in Fairfax. Outlets were conveniently located on the side of every other booth which made charging my cell phone's battery very efficient. The menu has something for everyone: soup, salad, burgers, pasta and pizza, including low-calorie and gluten free options.  I started with the Tuscan Tomato Bisque soup on this cold, wintry, slushy weather day and was very pleased with the rich, creamy flavor. Highly recommended. L requested the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which despite its excellent presentation, was more brothy (less creamy) than expected. For the entrée, I had the half rack of Baby Back Ribs which was so tender that the meat fell off the bone easily. L's Parmesan Crusted Chicken in the Chardonnay butter sauce was crispy and well-flavored with a great sauce and good mashed potatoes.  For dessert, we shared the Pizookie. In the inimitable words of our beloved Cookie Monster: Coooooooookie!  Nuf said. The price was wallet friendly, as we ordered from the 2 for $35 special - 2 starters, 2 entrees and 1 dessert.  Happy hour specials are available even on Sundays when it is game day. I think we've stumbled upon a new Sunday post-church tradition."

Harsh Deep Singh N.,"Atlanta, GA",348,128,173,5.0,9/23/2014,"BJ's is definitely one of my favorite restaurant chains. I've always loved their collection of beers on tap, and their hand tossed pizzas are among the best I've tasted. Also, the server was super nice, really attentive and yet professional enough to be unobtrusive. It was my dad's birthday, and she even got him a complimentary pizookie. Overall, it was an excellent dining experience and I intend on being a regular here. Cheers."
R Q.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,97,,4.0,12/7/2013,"This place is pretty solid. The food is decent enough and generous in portion, the beers are all pretty good and they do some mixers and stuff. They have custom sodas and 'mocktails' if you don't drink too which is nice. The service was great and overall no real complaints. This place is really in competition with your Gordon Biersch or whatever, so around that same price point, but their drink selection is better and there are many more food options as well. In terms of quality I'd say BJ's edges out Biersch by a bit as well but it's very comparable."
Geoff O.,"Alexandria, VA",49,197,2,2.0,2/9/2014,"Wow, this was the worst BJ I ever had.  I grew up out west, regularly visiting some of the original BJ's locations. I've always loved the place. Solid menu. Attentive service. Fair pricing. I'm glad to have a location out here in Tysons, but there is clearly work to be done. Our server was scatterbrained. My simple Caesar salad took ages and when I got it, it consisted mostly of chunks of the core of some swanky iceberg lettuce. I had it sent back and my entree came before another salad did, and the server told me it'd be awhile for the salad. How does it take forever to compose a Caesar salad?! My wife's barbecue chicken salad was a far cry from the same dish as it's served at other BJ's locations. The whole thing was just off and didn't taste that great. I'm not sure what the problem is. BJ's, I love you and stand by you, but you need to have some more senior staff from California come out there and help tighten things up a bit. For now, I wouldn't recommend anyone deviate much from deep-dish pizza. The quality of the rest of the menu is too suspect."
Vivian L.,"Potomac, MD",12,31,16,4.0,11/10/2013,"Yay!  They are finally open!  I've been to the BJ's in Westwood, CA and Laguna, CA, and was pleasantly surprised to see that they were opening up one in Tyson's Corner, VA.    Given that they have only just opened up, I was impressed with how smoothly the restaurant was running already.  Our food came out quickly, our ice teas were topped off several times, and our server Corey was very cordial and friendly. We ordered the avocado spring rolls as the appetizer (as suggested by Corey) and they were YUM-O!  For entree, we had the  Cobb salad and hand-tossed BJ's favorite pizza, which is basically a supreme pizza with the works.  I've only had the deep dish pizzas in the past, so this was something new.  It was delicious!  I don't know how they do it, but the hand-tossed pizza had a really thin crunchy layer at the bottom of the crust that was so good. BJ's is famous for their pizookie (ie pizza-cookie) desserts, which is a hot cookie baked in a pizza pan topped with ice cream.  So good!  But I was stuffed this time already from all the food.  Their portions are big btw so gotta plan accordingly next time to make it to the pizookie. Will definitely be back!  And judging by how busy this place was when we stopped by, people know already that it's good."
Randi F.,"Springfield, VA",5,102,1,3.0,3/24/2015,I went yesterday with some friends.  It is a huge place and as soon as they get more of a reputation they will be full.  The beer selection is good.  Happy hour was a great time to go.  It made reasonable prices even better.  We split a lot of appetizers and small bites.  That is the way to go.  The flat bread at other places can be so soggy and tasteless.  Not so at BJs.  It was really great and flavorful.
Michelle B.,"Merrifield, VA",201,11,1,2.0,1/9/2014,"Sat in the restaurant area during the evening crush (1830-1930). Pretty loud environment.  We (2 of us) ordered (in this order): Drinks Appetizer Main course  We received (in this order): One main course  Drinks Appetizer (spinach-artichoke dip) The rest of the main course Chips with the dip were either stale or too thick and undercooked (still undecided but we left chips on the plate - a very uncommon occurrence for either of us). Flat bread pizza was nondescript. A little undercooked. Nothing spectacular in the flavor department.  Bowl of chili was cool on the outside but warm on the inside -- nothing a little stirring  couldn't fix in order to make it warm-ish throughout. Tasted exactly like Hormel chili, but they're a successful brand so kudos on either the use or emulation of their product.  Will we come back?  Nope. Tried it but there are too many other restaurants in the area to try or other restaurants we've already established as our benchmark.  Secret shopping complete."
Preet L.,"Arlington, VA",1,25,2,5.0,6/27/2015,"Beautiful space as well a delicious variety of food. Our waitress was so fun. Prices are decent, too. However the hostess didn't greet us as we walked in (I actually had to greet her, even though she was looking at me right as I entered). She was not friendly. Instead of walking us to our reserved table, she pointed us in its direction & we were left on our own to find it. Very unprofessional. Although she was the only mishap, I will give this place 5 stars due to wonderful service and delicious food!"
Christopher R.,"Washington, DC",59,21,5,5.0,12/9/2014,"Love this place. My favorite after work Tysons Corner joint.  Shane M ""Little Shane"" is the man.  Great server!"
Katie R.,"Leesburg, VA",16,4,,5.0,5/12/2015,I absolutely LOVE this place! The food is always delicious and I absolutely love the whole environment. I go to this restaurant all the time and they always address me by my name when I come in and it makes me feel like they value me as a customer. The staff is always cheerful and so quick to make sure we are always taken care of. Highly Recommend!
Antonio C.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,160,672,3.0,1/7/2014,"I ws craving deep dish pizza and had the cheese and tomato. It was surprisingly light and tasty. I like that I didn't feel like I had a brick sitting in my stomach. I also tried the avocado spring roll, I'm a big fan of avocados and this was really good."
Daniel S.,"Fairfax, VA",59,38,45,5.0,1/29/2014,"Went here twice now and finally felt obligated to write about my experiences at this awesome steakhouse/brewery. First time I came with a few people to grab lunch. It was during happy hour so the pricier lagers were $4. My friend had a couple (Tatonka Stout and the Nutty Brewnette) and he said they were both incredible. I personally couldn't try them because I was under 21 at the time but in a few weeks I will definitely be popping in here to have one. The food during this visit was amazing. We had the Crispy Jalapeño Burger, the Grilled Burger Melt, and the California Burger and they were all cooked exactly how each of us wanted them. Our waiter saw to that. Excellent service.  That service was received the second time I went, this time with a very large party. When a couple extra guests showed up unexpectedly, I knew that it would be inconvenient and they would probably have to sit at a separate table. Our waiter was happy to add another table to our already large party. The food was magnificent then too. The atmosphere is very spacious, and familiar to other higher scale American restaurants like Sweetwater Tavern and Cheesecake Factory. Their sports bar is big and a focus point of the establishment. I will, without a doubt, be returning many more times."
Marina R.,"Germantown, MD",75,12,,1.0,7/10/2014,"This is actually my first review on Yelp ever. That is how terrible this food was.  I tried BJ's about a year ago as it is very close to my work. A bunch of coworkers and I thought this would be a great place for us to go during lunch and after work. We thought wrong. Our first visit was AWFUL. The staff was inattentive, rude, forgetful, and honestly, non-existent. On top of that the food we had was disgusting. We vowed never to go back. I even wrote a complaint on the site and never heard back from anyone. Not even an ""I'm sorry you had such a bad experience."" Today, I tried again. i convinced a coworker to try it again with me, give it the benefit of the doubt, thinking perhaps they had really done some work and become much better since all this time had passed. I was wrong.  I will say, the waiter I had today was very good. That was the only good part about my experience. He was very attentive and helpful.  Sadly thought, this waiter isn't enough to make me go back ever again. The food was just terrible and over priced. How do you mess up a salad? I paid $10.00 for the BJ Cobb which was ALL lettuce. I REALLY wish I were exaggerating, I really do. Oh! Sorry, I forgot the 3 chunks of really disgusting processed turkey that I actually spit back out (something I have actually never done before, ever) and the extremely watered down dressing.  There is a reason why this place is EMPTY during prime Tyson's Corner Lunch hour....There are so many restaurants in the area where I can get excellent food and service for the same price, I have no intention to return to BJ's again. Do yourselves a favor, skip it and eat somewhere worth your money."
Cristine P.,"Sterling, VA",49,125,43,4.0,1/14/2015,"My boyfriend found this place for us to eat last night and I was skeptical at first, but ended up really enjoying it. I got the chicken tortilla soup, which they bring out in a bowl with fresh avocado, tortilla strips, and cheese, then the waiter pours the hot soup over it to ensure its fresh and delicious... Loved it! It came with a side Caesar salad which I'm always a fan of. This one was very cheesy and the dressing was thick and creamy. The brew their beer in house and it's fantastic! I had the light beer which is only 137 calories per a pint! Perfect since we were planning on hitting the gym afterwards. While all the food was delicious, i caution thee to stay away from the artichoke dip! It tasted like burnt plastic and we virtually left it untouched. I docked a star because it took our waiter almost 20 mins to bring our check while we sat there with empty beers and empty plates. I would definitely come back for some drinking and that chicken tortilla soup! Mmmm"
Anna E.,"Raleigh, NC",0,4,,5.0,3/11/2015,This is a great place for happy hour. They have great specials and fantastic service. Lindsay is always working close around the bar and is so much fun and always making sure we have everything we need! My co workers come here all the time after a rough day in the office to unwind. Works every time!
Maria G.,"Annandale, VA",8,110,64,4.0,1/12/2014,"I love the beer selection here and the bartenders are sooooooo awesome!!! They let you sample the beer bf you make a selection. They have tons of big screen tv to make this a perfect spot to watch the game and down a couple of beers. I ordered the BJs burger and I would have to say its nothing special and quite greasy. I saw some others order the pizza and looked really good. So probably will go for pizza next time. Also, they have a rewards card. It's kinda a hassle tho bc you have to bring the card with you each time. I wish that you can rack up rewards by giving them your phone number or email to pull up your account each time you dine."
Ann T.,"Fairfax, VA",71,310,27,5.0,1/5/2014,"Highlights:  Pizookie (baked cookie a la mode in different flavors ranging from Oreo to original) - get the oreo version. tasted like a soft, warm oreo...mmmm   Ahi Poke - appetizer  - reminiscent of ceviche but not cooked in lime juice, it's perhaps one the top ten americanized sushi style dishes I've ever had Pizzas - not entirely a fan, but I love that it remains its crispness when reheated. Order a size smaller than you think you want. They're huge.  Good beers with good specials during happy hour - something like $3 pints for the beers they brew in house? Don't quote me on that."
