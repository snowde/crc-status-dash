Jason H.,"Fairfax, VA",9,6,,3.0,4/3/2015,"The service was fine - the atmosphere was pretty cool, but the food was just okay. Probably a fun place to go when you're with the right crowd for a game, and youre primarily interested in the bar"
Mike C.,"Fairfax, VA",2,1,,2.0,6/17/2014,"I went for the US World Cup game, which one could expect would be a busy night.  Well, the management didn't expect for it. First time visiting this place, and I was impressed with the size, the number of TVs, the beer selection and extensive menu.  I was, however, less-than-impressed with the service.  After waiting about 10 minutes while the distracted host/hostess eventually responded to the line at the desk to take names and hand out buzzers, I was told that a table for two would take 15 minutes (even though I saw 3 open).  I waited at the bar area to watch the game.  The bar was busy, but I only had to wait about 5-6 minutes to get a drink.  About 45 minutes later, my 15-minute table was ready.  (Ironically, one of the ones which I saw was empty when I walked in...). I sat down where the waiter (who seemed flustered and distracted all night) immediately told me that the bar and the kitchen were both backed up and I should order quickly.  I ordered a beer, and then didn't see him again for 7 minutes.  I ordered a water and a pizza at that time, hoping to get either before long.  The water took 5 minutes.  The pizza took about 40.  That original beer I ordered?  About 50 (even though the waiter told me three times that he went to find it and it didn't exist).  My friend showed up at that time, when it took him about 10 minutes to get a beer.  He put in a food order immediately to hopefully get served before the end of the match.  After finishing those beers, we ordered another (again, hopefully to arrive before the end of the match) and asked how long it would take for our food to be ready.  That's when the waiter, again flustered, swore to us and admitted to never putting in the order.   We finished those beers and left.  This is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a review like this. I thought the beer selection was good.  The ambiance was nice (although, loud inside even with no TV audio) and the food looked appetizing.  However, the lack of attention paid to the patrons by both the host staff and the wait staff was appalling.  I'm considering going back, when it won't be crowded, to see if it gets better.  If it doesn't, I'll update this post and reduce the rating."
Tamika B.,"District Heights, MD",2,22,4,4.0,3/29/2015,"Came here about two weeks ago and you know the food was good if I can write my review as if I just ate there tonight. Nice atmosphere especially for after work grub. The wings were really good, and the calamari. The flatbread pizza, and the Parmesan Crusted chicken is great as well. Then to top it all off the Cookie ice cream desert was the BOMB and light. I will visit this place again and the service was very good as well."
John S.,"Fairfax, VA",51,28,11,5.0,1/27/2014,"I finally feel that I can give BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse a confident 5-stars.  I've only been here for lunch, but what I've had on their lunch menu is enough to keep me coming back.  Lunch for three (water for drinks) came to 20.45 after tax. Great job!  I'll be back!"
Chris S.,"Falls Church, VA",4,105,1,1.0,7/24/2014,"This is a pretty bar, and on this Thursday at 5:30 it had lots of happy people enjoying themselves.  The bar is circular, giving a spacious and yet intimate effect. There are good but unobtrusive TVs.  If you're looking for a good Happy Hour place, come here. However, I was here for dinner.  Nothing was wrong with the seating (a nice little table by the window near the bar -- they had lots of booths in the adjacent large area that also looked comfy). Nothing was wrong with the service.  But the food...ghastly! I ordered the corn fritters appetizer (four fritters for $3.95). Comes on a small sauce plate. Texture was ok, but pretty tasteless, even though there were tiny real bacon bits in the sauce. I tried the bowl of chili ($6.60).  This was a bowl with not a lot in it, volume-wise, or any otherwise. Completely liquid: apparently dishwater with a tiny bit of ketchup mixed in. No beans or chiles, just two or three microscopic pieces of ground beef that seemed to have accidentally fallen into the bowl. The dish was adorned with a teaspoon of sour cream. I ordered the California Burger ($11.25).  This is an avocado and green chili burger on sourdough with swiss. The hamburger had that awful mealy texture - cheap beef that has been cooked improperly.  I spit it out, it was so unbelievably gross. I ate the tiny slices of avocado on the bread (which was soggy) as my entree. If I had gone to McDonalds I would have gotten a MUCH better burger. If I opened a can of Hormel chili, that would have been MUCH better. The food here is a bad joke. Easily the worst meal I've (tried) to eat in years. I would have sent it back, but I got the overall definite impression that this was really the best they could do. Nothing at the establishment seemed wrong except that the kitchen can't make edible food. Maybe if you're so drunk you're about to pass out you would eat this food. But even then I would not recommend it."
Michael S.,"McLean, VA",0,1,,1.0,2/25/2016,"We attempted to have dinner/drinks about 8:30 pm Wednesday evening.  Unsurprisingly, the restaurant was not very crowded.  There were two people at the hostess stand, and we were promptly seated at a table on the row near the kitchen, with no other patrons nearby.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  No waiter or waitress ever showed up.  The two people at the hostess stand continued their chat and never looked in our direction.  Finally, after nearly 10 minutes we left.  As we were walking back to our car, we saw a couple of waitresses who appeared to be replacing pages in menus; too bad they weren't waiting on tables!  This experience was unfortunate because we have been here several times before and enjoyed the food."
Nikki C.,"Washington, DC",8,110,24,2.0,12/6/2015,"I'm only giving 2 stars because the service was good. Our waiter was quick and attentive, but the food was bleh. We started with Sriracha queso dip. It came out room temperature and didn't have much flavor. Cheesy dip from the grocery store actually tastes better. I didn't taste the Sriracha at all. Then we ordered the avocado egg rolls. They were okay, not worth 11 bucks though, the sauce didn't really go well with it and the guac was bland. Then we ordered the chicken club, and portobello burger. My chicken sandwich and shoe string fries came out room temperature and the sandwich was pretty good, and the burger was mediocre. The fries weren't fresh and kind of hard like they were sitting for a while and then heated up. The drinks were good, and so is the beer. It's better to come here for drinks and eat somewhere else. It's kinda pricey for bland food. This place is never packed even on a Friday or Saturday night, must be because it really isn't anything special. It's a rip off, for room temp food that seems to be heated up and not prepared fresh."
Terrie S.,"Falls Church, VA",2,5,25,4.0,1/12/2014,First time here - bar great shape and large -lots of seating if not a bar fly. Two huge tellies at the bar and then around the walls windows facing route 7 to check out the traffic. Haha. Had the cob salad and a flat bread both were yum .... Tasted eight of there beers but they also have a good selection of as they call then Guest beers very cool for a brewery . Asked if they could change a telly for the caps cause football was on and it was no problem ... Overall a lovely evening and I know I will be back . bar keeps we're friendly and fun.
Blaire B.,"Madison, VA",5,32,10,5.0,2/5/2016,My friend wanted to take me here last night and once I saw all the bad reviews a really didn't want to go. When I got here I realized I went with a small group about two years ago and we had a wonderful experience! We ordered a few pizzas and flatbreads to share and a few pizookies as well. The service and food were great. My second experience (last night) was equally good. Our server was kind and our food was great. My favorite part was dessert. We shared the mini pizookie trio. I would reccomend the macadamia nut. Definitely coming back.
Terrence G.,"Vienna, VA",5,54,6,2.0,9/7/2014,"I've been here four times now each for different occasions (happy hour, dinner with the family, football games, random weekday dinner).  Each time service was slow and below par.  I never felt that any of the servers and bartenders really cared.  Food is also below par in my opinion.  I live and work close by and will not be recommending BJs.  All they need to do is bring up the service and this place will thrive in Tysons.   There is no excuse for poor service regardless of menu, decor, and location."
Chris P.,"Vienna, VA",0,16,,2.0,3/29/2015,"The deep dish pizza does not have sauce! You have to ask for it. Too noisy. Hard to hear the person across form you. Good beer choices, and you can try small samples to decide which one you like."
Stephanie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",7,1,,1.0,6/3/2015,"I don't usually write reviews, but this particular dining experience was an exception. I have been going to BJ's for years and have eaten at many BJs restaurants back in California. It's one of my favorite places to go for pizza, pizookies and a good time. When I heard that a BJ's Restaurant was opening in the Virginia area, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, this particular BJs has left me disappointed with the service and the quality of the food several times, and after my most recent visit, I will not be returning. My friends and I walked into BJs on a Saturday afternoon ready to watch the NCAA playoffs, eat a good meal and just have a good time. There was no wait, but we initially sat ourselves in the self-seating area. After a few minutes, we decided that it did not offer a good view of the TV screens, so we asked to be moved to the main seating area. A waitress escorted us to an empty booth in the main restaurant and said she would get our server. We asked her if it was okay that we sit there, and she said that she had spoken to the hostess who said it was fine. Two minutes later, our new server shows up and basically scolds us for ""seating ourselves in what is clearly not a self-serve area."" Not only does he scold us, he proceeds to lecture us about how restaurants work and that you need to check in with the hostess and wait to be seated. We tried explaining the situation to him, but he would not listen. He proceeded to give us attitude saying that he had been saving this particular table plus one other for his friends. We immediately offered to move to another table, but instead he told us to stay and that he would ""let it slide,"" although he was very visibly angry and even mentioned that he was ""upset with the other server for seating us there."" My friends and I had never felt so uncomfortable or unwanted at a restaurant before. After staying for 15 minutes and ordering a pitcher of beer, we decided to get the check and just leave. On our way out, we briefly mentioned the incident to the restaurant manager who casually apologized, but seemed completely unconcerned with what his server had done. I have never seen such unprofessional behavior or received such poor service at a restaurant, or anywhere for that matter, before. I love BJs and their pizookies, but I will not be returning to this particular location. The service is awful."
Patrick P.,"Fairfax, VA",0,40,,1.0,10/23/2015,Good interior but that is all I will say that is positive.  The service is what I would expect from a fast food joint.  Which is fine if I were going to a fast food joint but not worthy enough for me to leave a tip and this critique is directed at the management not rank and file staff.
John S.,"Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, MD",38,4,3,5.0,6/10/2014,"It's everything you can ask for in a bar/restaurant. It has a lot of different food to offer and one of the biggest bar I have seen here in the DMV. Get the avocado egg rolls , Buffalo pizza and a pitcher of the berry burst cider and you will have a great time (:"
Lisa R.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,9/19/2014,"The food was ok but the service is terrible.  Nomatter that it's empty, my plates sit on the table for over 10 minutes whole staff member after staff member walk by.  The ambiance in here is forced, not inherently cool."
Christine V.,"Alexandria, VA",109,37,8,3.0,12/3/2014,"None of the food has particularly stood out to be as being fantastic. I ordered a soup and salad one night as my meal while with my family and they brought it out way before everyone else's food but there were no utensils on the table. By the time the utensils came back, my soup was cold. I like this place because it has a large selection and seems like a good place to go to if you need to please a crowd of indecisive eaters. They also have a large selection of beers which is another plus."
Marco G.,"Fairfax, VA",1,20,4,2.0,8/22/2014,Service is terrible . We literally waited for almost 10 minutes before a waiter came to our table . food is great But I feel like you can get way better service at any other place
John M.,"Houston, TX",3,26,13,2.0,8/5/2014,The free wifi is so slow here I drained my battery waiting to download an app. My sister used her phone 3G and downloaded the same app in 5 secs. This is more of a tip actually.
Daniela C.,"Woodbridge, VA",0,2,2,3.0,1/10/2015,"Service was a tad bit slow. I understand she had other tables but at one point, we hadn't seen her for 25 minutes and we needed plates and ranch for our appetizer. Getting her to come over to our table took serious effort from everyone at our table. I'm a server too, at a similar restaurant so I understand being busy on a Saturday night. Food was great as always!"
Alan C.,"Newport News, VA",43,21,,3.0,11/17/2014,"Very reasonable prices especially for Happy Hour and a HUGE menu.  I come here occasionally for games because there are plenty of big screen TVs and plenty of open space around the bar.  The food is solid but not spectacular for the most part although the deep dish pizzas are amazing.  The downside is the service is quite slow, which might be because they are a bit understaffed."
