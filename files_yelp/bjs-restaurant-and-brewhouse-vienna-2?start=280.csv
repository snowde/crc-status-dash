Jaymi P.,"McLean, VA",11,39,5,4.0,11/11/2014,"This is a new restaurant in this area, although I was already familiar with it from living in California.  I've been coming here since they first opened. Their beer is really great and lower priced than the other drafts. I really like the two options for the ciders and sometimes get them half and half. It depends on the day but the bartenders are very nice. Every now and no again when I come, this particular bartender is more preoccupied with flirting up the cute girl at the bar or his friend to pay attention to anyone else. Other than that the food is great too and I enjoy coming here from time to time."
Rupali K.,"Brampton, Canada",22,1,,3.0,1/6/2016,"I am giving three stars just for the food. I really really love the food here. I live in Canada but I go to BJs like every other month as my family is based in US and  suggested my inlaws to try BJs and took them there. I really don't believe that they closed their kitchen without telling us. We ordered pizza and some appetizers which came on time. (Pizza and appetizers were brought together on table) . Like after 15 mins we wanted to place an order for Pizookies. My family was really excited as I told them that it is one of the best deserts you will ever have. Believe me the guy who was serving us told us smiling ""you cannot place an order coz our kitchen is closed now"". Thank you for the service you provided."
David M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,3,,3.0,12/28/2015,"I had dinner with a group of 25 people. The service was great and it wasn't too loud. The food though, was boring and overpriced.  I had the Chicken quinoa bowl for $13.95. It consisted of a decent piece of chicken (sandwich sized) on a bed of quinoa and a TINY bit of some kind of vegetable matter (1 TSP) under the chicken. That's it.  Needed a lot of beer to get that meal down! I won't go back. Better food at Chipotle."
Fernando L.,"Vienna, VA",62,19,2,5.0,6/14/2014,"I love this place and I love the food. The service is fantastic too and everyone is so friendly. I had the pleasure of talking to a manager named Patty and she really knows how to make a customer feel welcomed. Try the traditional wings. They are absolutely excellent. They're lightly breaded, so be aware if you're on any kind of low carb diet."
Michael S.,"Charlotte, NC",20,23,2,4.0,10/20/2014,Great atmosphere and an enormous bar.  Big enough TVs to watch a game from anywhere.  Homemade draft beer to satisfy anyone's taste.  Try the Brewhouse blonde or the Jeremiah Red.  Pizza looks and tastes amazing!
A K.,"Centreville, VA",2,34,29,2.0,6/2/2014,This place has potential - it's just not there yet. I've been to this chain restaurant in Florida - and the service was much better. My sons mini-corn dogs were still frozen on the inside and I think they just threw them back in the fryer and served the same corn dogs again. Service was slow - but they did seem short staffed. I'll give this place another try and hope it's better the second time around.
Nan M.,"Lovettsville, VA",0,2,,1.0,6/20/2014,"Went there for lunch today, arrived early. Ordered and received drinks then had to sit for over 20 minutes for someone to return and take our order.  Order finally taken and three different ""food runners"" brought salads to our table which were not what one of us ordered.  There we sat, one eating the salad as ordered, and the other person who had ordered a wedge salad, sent the next two deliveries back because it was not what was ordered.  Lunch should not be this hard.  Will not go back. Too many other choices in Tyson's with better service.  As a side, by the time we received our entrees we had lost interest. Food was good, but service was a game changer. Sigh."
Rodney D.,"Fairfax, VA",68,3,1,1.0,1/17/2014,"The worst service ever!! I went there on a Friday night with a couple friends and we sat at the bar, we ordered a few drinks. It went smoothly...after you get your drink that's when things go down hill. The bartenders will NEVER acknowledge you again after that. You could be having a fire going on at your seat and they still won't care, you could walk out on your tab and they won't even know. When we hailed  them down for our  tab it took them another decade to run it. This is my FIRST and LAST time I will go there. I will be surprised if they are still open a year from now. Bartenders need to go to Customer Service 101!!  My tab was $18.66 I left a $2.00 tip (that is being generous). Bartender name: Matthew M (178) 1/17/2014 @ 11:03pm"
Daniel T.,"Arlington, VA",360,237,344,3.0,7/11/2014,"This place is a great sports bar.  They have TV's all over the place including massive ones above the bar.  I mean MASSIVE. The food was pretty good, I give it 3.5 stars overall. The service was great as the server for our party of 4 was polite and made good recommendations."
Jennifer Z.,"Centreville, VA",30,17,,2.0,2/3/2014,"I had been hoping to get a chance to try this place since I saw it open a few months back. It seemed like a competitive alternative to many of the places in and around Tyson's mall which I feel like I've made the rounds on time and again. Unfortunately, BJ's will not be making it's way onto any short list of places to go for food or drink.  The setup is promising: The interior and decor is very nice, with TVs mounted along the bar and an open floor plan that is very inviting as you walk in. Being new, it was remarkably clean, which I certainly appreciated. The menus are definitely worth noting, as the pictures of the food encourage you to salivate at the options. Sadly the pictures don't translate over to taste. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference in taste between an entree here or from Applebee's, except for maybe the price. I got the Bison Burger, which did not standout in any way. The meat was not very compact and had the consistency of a frozen Turkey patty. My date had a Chicken entree, which was thin, rubbery, and very bland. Again, I'd equate the entree to something frozen you could find at a grocery store. For drinks we got the 8 beer sample to try. I commend the variety, but there was nothing particularly alluring about the beers, and they certainly won't be enough to draw me back.  One thing that I would like to rave for a moment about was the service, which I would actually give 5 stars for. The waitress was engaging, the service was quick, and everyone there was very friendly. Overall, I'd say that you if you just wanted a nice, alternative atmosphere to watch a sporting event, this would be a welcoming spot. But for an actual meal or drink, I'd search for some place else."
Ashley P.,"Washington, DC",97,293,56,3.0,11/16/2013,"Came here for the pre-opening friends and family event. *Pros* -Right off the exit -Free parking in the garage. Tip: Go to the bottom level, you'll find plenty of spaces and beat the chaos. -Love the open concept. Nice decor inside. Spacious yet still inviting. *Cons* -Hopefully this won't be a con once they're fully open and in the swing of things, but man did they hover! We couldn't have a private conversation if our lived depended on it! -The server kept rearranging things on our table, flipping our menus, moving the salt and pepper shakers around, and this was happening while we were in the middle of dining. It was really odd. I think she has OCD. I may or may not have flipped the menu right back to the page I was previously on as soon as she walked away. Take that! -Mediocre food. I ordered the pepperoni lover's mini pizza, and man was it mini. It was small than the tostino's you used to get back in college. Sadly, it was pretty flavorless too. There was plenty of pepperoni, but it wasn't seasoned at all. The hubs had a bison burger, and it was super tiny. He like the fries alright though. -They make their sodas in house by hand, and when i asked the server to explain it to me- she had no clue what made them different from a regular ole Dr. Pepper (mmmm Dr. Pepper). She said, ""it's not made with any of that uh stuff."" I said, ""let me guess, do you mean high fructose corn syrup?"" ""Yeah!"" ........  *Verdict* -Nothing special, and we have no reason to go back."
Marianela R.,"Fairfax, VA",27,8,2,3.0,6/9/2014,Nice relaxed atmosphere and good beer.  I had dinner there and it was good but I definitely prefer this spot for a HH.
Jesse E.,"Gainesville, VA",46,4,1,4.0,3/6/2014,I would recommend Krista as your server! The happy hour menu is a great value. The egg roll appetizer is delicious and also available on the happy hour menu! I would recommend calling before coming in as the beer menu is different than what is available!
Kevin W.,"Falls Church, VA",0,2,,1.0,8/23/2014,I like bjs and I'm probably there twice a week I love the atmosphere and the awesome av system. however there is a particular bartender who is terrible. I must of waited for about 20 minutes for my Jeremiah red and was completely ignored at the bar. I feel like the bartender ignores a lot of his guests and has this I run the place attitude. if you do come to bjs try to avoid the bartender with the glasses ( Shaun or shayne?) it's just bad vibes with him.
John R.,"Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",2,6,,1.0,11/15/2013,Terrible service....mediocre food....management didn't care that we were inconvenienced.  Check out Blackfinn as an alternative.
Dewey F.,"Vienna, VA",1,38,23,2.0,2/8/2014,"Felt like we were at Cheesecake Factory. None of the food was too appealing. Tried the fish tacos only came as two with some chips.meh. Got a pitcher of the blonde beer, tasted just like bud light. Overall boring."
John D.,"Falls Church, VA",0,12,3,2.0,12/10/2013,"Tuesday night, driving down route 7 while hungry and happened to notice this place. I wish I had kept on driving. Taco Bell and a 40 from 7-11 would have been the more cost effective and satisfying choice. The staff was friendly enough and I liked our waiter, hence an extra star.  First off, I will preface by saying some consider me a beer snob. The 'Hopstorm IPA' arrived quickly and upon first sip and I immediately wrinkled my nose. There was an odd stale taste to it and I begrudgingly drank it.  Next came the Santa Fe egg rolls. While the portion was generous, I couldn't help but think I've gotten better from Safeway's frozen aisle. Nothing jumped out and the dipping sauces were meh at best. After that we were presented with the jambalaya. It was OK. A bit soupy and uninspired but otherwise edible.  Thinking perhaps the IPA was a fluke, I ordered the 'Tatonka stout'. It was one of the worst beers I've ever had and I'm a fan of Imperial Stouts. It was disgustingly sweet and again, some odd off-kilter malt flavor. I suffered through it and my palate is cursing me still as I type this.  On the plus side, the prices were reasonable and the portions were generous. I doubt I'd ever go there again however. There are many better options out there competing for your dining dollars."
Andrea S.,"Centreville, VA",0,19,3,4.0,6/23/2014,"We went to watch soccer game today. Appetizerdd were good , but  the waitress was not very attentive. But we had a good time."
Jon L.,"McLean, VA",0,10,4,1.0,1/22/2015,average food at best. horrible service!!! stay away.
Stefani A.,"Manassas, VA",2,11,4,4.0,6/8/2014,Join the rewards program. Everything I've ordered has been very good. Family favorite!
