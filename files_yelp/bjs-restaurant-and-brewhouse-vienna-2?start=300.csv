Liz S.,"Philadelphia, PA",58,104,21,1.0,3/4/2014,"I went here Saturday night with my boyfriend. We ordered 2 drinks (1 chardonnay and 1 beer) and the waiter brought me red wine instead. We got our appetizer, which was the spinach dip, and it was frozen solid in the middle. We ended up needing to leave ASAP because I needed to go to the ER (for other reasons, not food related), and when we told the manager that we would need the bill and that the dip was frozen, she didn't even flinch, as if that had happened before. I was super excited about this place because the pizzookies are great and the pizza was good too, but now I'll never go back. I'm tired of restaurants taking the shortcut and not making everything from scratch. I could heat up frozen dip in the comfort of my own condo."
Nikki B.,"Washington, DC",43,14,1,5.0,11/10/2013,This is a great restaurant with delicious food and great atmosphere. Reginald is an awesome server who is knowledge and attentive. The sweet pig deep dish pizza is a must-as is the pumpkin seasonal ale.  Calamari is great too. Great first visit-will come back regularly.
Jennifer B.,"McLean, VA",121,2,,1.0,9/7/2014,"I just went to BJs Brewery because of their advertised NFL ticket and left at halftime because the entire experience from the moment we walked in the door was terrible. When entering the restaurant that claims to be ""football central"" instead of receiving a pleasant greeting when I inquired about the Eagles game location on the TVs, I was rudely told, ""all TVs are already set for other games.""  Surprisingly when more Eagles fans came in, and the bartender went to request a TV be changed to that game, lo and behold, they could suddenly change the channel to the Eagles. Then our waitress broke off the cork in our bottle of wine which caused a 20-minute delay and brought us sweetened iced teas instead of the unsweetened ones we requested. Next she could not remember a simple food order of 1 item each nor could she make sure the kitchen had our food order come out together. Thirty minutes later after my dining companion received her soup, my appetizer sample finally came out tasting like every item was microwaved with almost zero flavor. I will not be returning to this location and wish I could give this place zero stars especially for the horrible attitudes of the staff and manager. I will drive the extra distance to Glory Days Grill where they are more than happy to make sure my NFL viewing experience is as pleasant as possible.  And the servers and managers are always friendly and accommodating!"
Stuart F.,"Vienna, VA",0,1,,1.0,6/22/2014,"In Florida this chain is amazing as far as the entire experience. However, this place in Tysons is not family friendly!!! We were told it would take 40 minutes for our party of six to be seated before the rush of a soccer game. They easily sat 40 to 50 people including parties of 3 to 4 at movable tables next to each other. We waited for an hour and 20 minutes before we finally were fed up with waiting and asked how much longer and we were told another hour because of the game and amount of people that were seated while we waited. We ended up ordering to go because we like the food, but the service is beyond horrible!!!"
Jack K.,"West McLean, VA",0,517,,2.0,3/26/2014,"Two and a half stars...I think when the execution of what is basically a good concept is so bad that it becomes a distraction, what could have been a great review becomes a bit of a complaint session. And there were many complaints from our party.  Waiter--nice enough guy, but he was limited by the rest of the team.  The food came out--we all got someone else's dish and had to pass hot plates around. Both soups we ordered were not yet prepared, so we had to try our second choices.  My request for fresh jalapeños instead of fried was forgotten.  One of the side dishes was still frozen in the middle.  The nice enough hostess suggested we try to squeeze six people into a booth--that wasn't going to happen. The food itself (my plan B clam chowder and the burger) were quite good--some experience and maturity on the part of the young staff will improve the experience next time I'm sure."
C W.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",423,100,41,3.0,2/16/2014,"A friend recommend this place because I wanted a place with decent food and beer selection. We ordered the ahi tuna , the tuna itself was decent but the menu had shown a picture with tuna on a bed guacamole but it has  three prices of guacamole it was on a bed of cabbage instead.  For entrée my boyfriend ordered the bison burger he said he was ok. For my entrée I ordered the Tuscan chicken pasta, it was very bland and had almost no taste to it. I had to add lemon juice , salt and pepper , though I do not have a heavy taste bud for saltiness but it was very bland. We got the chocolate chuck pizookie for dessert , it was pretty good.  The beer selection was good also, I would go back again and give it a another shot."
Jennifer K.,"Reston, VA",298,142,522,3.0,2/8/2014,"I haven't been here for food as yet but went on a Friday night for drinks with friends. It is certainly nice to have another place to go for drinks other than really upscale places like the palms or dungeons like on the boarders in the back the of the building. Place is nicely decorated, clean and unique. Was not impressed with service nor I think the place offered anything special that could separate from other brewery. However I would certainly like to come back for lunch and/or dinner soon."
Nicole S.,"Falls Church, VA",24,3,,5.0,10/31/2013,My fiancé and I came here for dinner. We got a beer sampler with 8 beers. They wanted us to try each so they brought us an additional 4 beers. Service was top notch and food was tasty. Highly recommended.
Janelle B.,"Durham, NC",0,27,18,3.0,3/26/2015,Good place to watch a game.  Food is okay.  Appetizers were tasty.  Nice selection of beer.
Todd L.,"Falls Church, VA",1,2,,2.0,11/16/2013,"The space is very nice as are the people.  I thought the service was good too.  The beer is a little light bodied (I am a beer snob) but the food was not real good.  Not over priced but my fish and chips was mostly breadibg, not fish. Standard 'corporate' fare.  Not great but not bad either."
Lynda D.,"Alexandria, VA",0,23,,5.0,3/24/2014,"BJ's is one of our favorite restaurants/brew pubs in the USA!  When traveling out west, if it is in the vicinity of where we are, we seek them out knowing that the experience will be a good one.  We have been to their locations in El Paso, Texas, Reno, Nevada and Fresno, CA.  Their beers are great, their food is Cali style pub food (delicious, healthy and pairs well with their beers), the interiors are nice/upscale/comfortable/clean and the staff are usually friendly/professional/accomodating.  And, the quality of the place is consistent in each location (at least the ones that we have been to).  The new Tysons location meets all of these standards. When I found out that one had opened up here, I could not contain my excitement.  The initial exchange with my husband was pretty funny.  It went something like this...  I said excitedly ""Honey, a new BJ's opened up in Tysons Corners!""  He looked at me with a blank stare and said ""so what, there is a BJ's warehouse club here in Alexandria, why are you excited that another one just opened up in Tysons?""  I said, ""No - BJ's""  still no reaction... Then, I said, ""You know, BJ's Brewpub!""   Then, after a pause and a ""what?"", he understood and was just as happy as I was. We have been to the Tysons location a few times and like it very much.  Its location is easy to get to, it has convenient free parking in a covered lot shared with Nordstrom Rack and it is NOT in the mall. Only con is that it is not located closer to where we live. Note to BJ's --- PLEASE open up a second northern VA location in the POTOMAC YARDS DEVELOPMENT - route 1 in Alexandria."
Angela K.,"Vienna, VA",83,74,14,4.0,12/1/2013,"Good place for a happy hour as the menu is good and varied. Please note though that the happy hour portions are pretty small and leave a bit to be desired. The dishes seem like they're not really close to the pictures but I mean I can't argue with the happy hour prices I guess. Definitely left me with more to be desired. Beers/drinks are good. The restaurant is huge and the bar area has TVs galore if you're looking for a game. Pizzas/ahi Tina appetizer/sliders were all good, parking underground is plentiful, all staff are friendly. The Pizzooki or whatever it's called was ok. Everyone said it's a must try. Basically a large cookie in a personal pan size tray with ice cream on too. It was wayyyy too much sugar for me as I'd have preferred just the cookie but I'm sure others would love it. I'm going back since it's close and the good HH specials/drinks."
Leah Y.,"Merrifield, Fairfax, VA",55,31,8,3.0,12/14/2013,"Nice middle of the road place. And did someone say Pizookie? That gooey half done deep dish cookie thing was AMAZING. I mean, for the price its decent. Don't expect the fancy fare you get at some of the other Tyson's area places."
Amanda W.,"Alexandria, VA",13,34,,4.0,12/14/2013,"I've now been to this location twice and the food has been excellent both times.  However my most recent visit was disappointing.  The waiter had no clue what I was ordering when I asked for the 8 beer sampler.  Then when he delivered it, he placed them on the mat all wrong.  My boyfriend and I know enough about beer to figure out that none of them were placed correctly.  He wasn't a bad server but lacked any confidence and to work in a beer place...KNOW WHAT THE BEERS ARE!  At times he was over attentive and other times he was no where to be found.  It looked like the table he was serving next to us had issues with their check.  I'll be back but hope for better service."
Wendy K.,"Arlington, VA",0,1,,1.0,7/29/2014,DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! I asked for a glass of Pinot Noir and it costs me $12.25 for that one glass. That's around the same price as my entire entree. The waiter told me they only have 2 different kinds of Pinot Noir but failed to inform me this beforehand. It was extremely shady! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! The food was not even all that great.
Xinyi T.,"Fairfax, VA",98,138,31,3.0,10/25/2013,"My fiancée and I came here for their friends and family rehearsal during lunch. The place looks amazing! We got the buffalo deep dish pizza, sesame chicken salad and the egg rolls. The portion here are pretty big. I liked the egg roll and the salad. Not the biggest fan of the deep dish. The crust is not crispy at all and it has too much breading. I had the pumpkin beer which I liked. The waiters were very nice and attentive. I'm looking forward to learn about their happy hour menu! Im really hoping this becomes the next go to happy hour spot in the Tyson area"
Sanket P.,"Falls Church, VA",0,2,,2.0,3/23/2014,"They always mess up reservations. They were unable to adjust a party of 6 when I clearly called and provided my name. When I mentioned that I had called ahead, they looked at me as if I was lying. After showing the call log they still would not give us a table. Good joint. Management needs to straighten out process."
Rachit B.,"Vienna, VA",1,32,,4.0,12/15/2013,"The Tysons Corner area is severely lacking bars. This is definitely a step in the right direction. Trendy, modern bar area with lots of beers on tap. Huge TV's everywhere also make it great for sports. Their deep dish pizza is really quite good. Would recommend that as a must from their food menu. The cookies with ice cream desserts are also really good. They have a parking garage so easy access to and from. Service is quick and attentive. Check it out!"
Fjohn R.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",117,31,57,1.0,11/14/2013,"We went. Waited an hour for drinks. Complained to the manager after 45 minutes, he never came back. We walked out. Go elsewhere -- Cincks 'n' wings, Finnegans Pride, Bennigans, or Omalleys. Anywhere will treat you better."
Nikki B.,"Ashburn, VA",34,39,14,3.0,12/8/2013,"I've been here twice, dinner and lunch.  Dinner was great, however lunch wasn't that great.  Food was taking too long to cook and the order was wrong when it finally came out.  Price is good.  Same as Cheesecake Factory.  Other than that, big difference from San Diego.  Great ambiance!  Lots of selection!  Once it's open a little longer I'm sure it will be fine!"
