Kim L.,"Gainesville, VA",0,3,1,1.0,2/12/2014,Sadly I give this one star. We were looking forward to our first visit to BJ's - Gainesville is limited on good restaurants we were hoping this would be a good one.  Service was DREADFUL!! One thing you should never do in customer service is make excuses and that's exactly what she kept doing instead of making it right. Ordered our appetizer 40 min later we're still waiting. By the time we left we had been there for 2 hours. Will be a long time before we go back.
Scott B.,"Charles City, VA",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2014,Just had the worst experience I have had in a restaurant in years.  Sat down at a table by the bar at 6:30.  Took 10 minutes to see the waitress.  I asked what ciders were available and was directed to their one option.  I found two others on the menu after I had ordered.   My friend ordered a cocktail from their menu. We ordered three small plates from their menu.  45 minutes later.  No drinks - not even water!  Of course no food.  Others around us were served.  I asked nicely for water.  Server couldn't be bothered.  Asked to see the manager.  Waited 10 minutes.  They didn't show either.  Amazing considering they weren't busy. empty chairs at the bar and empty tables in the restaurant.  Left and went to Neidha Thai and we're eating in 10 minutes.  They're just as busy!
David C.,"Sterling, VA",10,65,,2.0,8/21/2014,"Food is ok, drink selection is good  - atmosphere is good but the service has been really poor in the 4-5 times I have been there.  1st time was just after opening and the service was pretty prompt.  The last 3-4 times has been progressively worse.  Most times I feel like I have to call the greeters to help get me seated.  After that we have been seated in the bar and the restaurant area at different times.  The food has been decent as mentioned, but the last time we were there it took 20 minutes to get our order taken, 40 minutes to get our food and nothing was ever refilled unless we literally got up and asked.  We called the manager over this last time and let them know the concerns and he was kind enough to comp our meal but we detailed our concerns including one co-worker leaving after an hour of waiting for food.  I hope they read this because Tysons really can use a place like BJ's!!!"
Lisa V.,"Falls Church, VA",0,21,,4.0,2/25/2015,"We liked the variety of the menu, but wonder if it really needs to copy the Cheesecake Factory in depth. Do a few things and do them well. No, the real attraction here is the beer menu and TVs. We liked our food, and the portions were good. Waiter was friendly."
Duane F.,"McLean, VA",0,10,,2.0,12/2/2013,"Towards the end of the night just after the game ended I asked the bar tender for another beer.  He looked at his watch and said, uh it's 11:45 and we are not serving anymore.  The other bar tender said, I will top it off for you and proceeds to give me a half of glass of beer.  I was beyond shocked!  What bar tender says no to another drink?  In the end, the original bar tender filled my glass and I tipped him accordingly.  Overall, this bar tender had a bad attitude all evening.  Unfortunately there is nothing else comparable in the area so they may win customers by default.  100% better than Chicks n Wings for watching games, food, and service in general.   Management needs to make sure they have the right bar tenders working on game day.  Poor service in general for my second experience.  I will give them another try next Sunday....."
Sabrina B.,"Rockville Town Square, MD",0,7,,1.0,12/1/2013,"The food was horrendous. For an appetizer I ordered a chicken tortilla soup and at first it looked quite good but after tasting it, I realized that it was way too salty. I couldn't continue eating it. I ordered an auburn nutty dark beer and my waiter ended up giving me a light seltzer tasting beer. After all that disappointment, my entree arrived. It was an Atlantic salmon but my waiter managed to screw up my side order. The salmon was overcooked and smelled a little off putting. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed with my entire meal. I'm saddened because I really like Californian food but BJs was just a huge disappointment."
Gary L.,"Springfield, VA",402,2,,3.0,1/3/2014,"jan 3, 2014. seated around 6:40, and our waitress took our appetizer order around 6:50. it took 40 minutes from the time of ordering an appetizer to the time it took for renee to come back to our table and ask what else we wanted to order. in that time, she had taken the orders of people seated next to us, and closed our another table. her excuse was she had to deal with an issue. the steak was good, and the pizookie was as well. the food overall was above average, but the service horrendous. there were a few empty tables so they were not that busy. the servers are not attentive at all."
David R.,"McLean, VA",17,1,,5.0,12/31/2013,"Had a pizza, app sampler and a buffalo chicken salad and nothing was bad! Beer is phenomenal and I can't talk enough of the service! Bartender was great both times and drinks were spot on!"
Samantha R.,"McLean, VA",0,5,,5.0,11/12/2013,"Great new restaurant in Tyson's!!! On route 7 next to the Nordstrom rack, DXL, and Neisha Thai.  The service was great, we were greeted by a hostess as soon as we walked in the door and seated at a table within 5 min. Our waiter was very attentive, taking our order, refilling our drinks quickly etc The menu was large with a lot of good options, including a page of lighter entrees. I was only looking at desserts, we just stopped in for dessert and coffee before a movie, but all the food going to the tables around us looked delicious. We got pizookies that were amazing!! And it was very affordable, 2 coffees (with free refills) and 2 pizookies were only $11. The design/layout is really cool as well. They have their beer labels on the walls and cool artwork, the bar area is incredible with a huge TV. I liked that even though they had huge TVs the noise wasn't too much and I could still sit at a table and have a conversation.  Usually when a new restaurant opens it takes at least a month or 2 for the staff and kitchen etc to get it together but that is definitely not the case at BJs!!!"
S M.,"Leesburg, VA",1,64,2,4.0,11/10/2014,"Highly recommend the deep dish pizza - cannot to speak to anything else, but the deep dish pizzas are incredible"
Tim G.,"Falls Church, VA",0,11,3,5.0,11/7/2013,"My wife, baby, and I had a great experience here last night. We received extremely friendly service (best I can recall --- welcomed by 3 people, great server, said bye/thanks by 4 people) but more importantly their beer and food were very good. We got the avocado rolls (awesome), Mediterranean deep dish pizza (really good), and club sandwich (average but good). My beer sampler was for the IPA (awesome/tasty/great hops), stout (heavy strong taste), robust porter (not very robust), nutty brown (good but tame).  We are looking forward to going back for dessert. The menu is a little overwhelming like cheesecake factory :-)"
Johsiah G.,"Manassas, VA",2,14,,4.0,11/23/2013,"Cool Bar with plenty of TV's to watch whatever you want.  Like the beer they brew, was a big fan of the Nutty Brewnette.  Would like to go back and try some of the other brews they offer."
Bill H.,"Rehoboth Beach, DE",4,2,,3.0,11/11/2014,"Came by at lunchtime on Veteran's Day. Not especially busy, but the bar staff (mostly one guy) was overwhelmed and a bit surly. Beer was ok ; I might have had more were service more prompt."
Mark M.,"Rockville, MD",66,26,21,4.0,7/27/2014,"Went here for the first time for my friend's birthday dinner; definitely a test of the staffs' attention to detail. Oddly enough they split our table of about 20 or more straight down the middle. This wasn't the worst idea, but by the end proved that my server was much better than that of the other side's. The in-house brewed beer is very good! I was able to try the Hopstorm IPA, berry beer, and Jeremiah Red. I don't recommend the berry beer, that is for sure.  You're much better off ordering pink mascato, it essentially taste like bad mascato. Hopstorm was quite similar to DogFish 60min. Jeremiah red was very good! Wasn't too dark, but not light at all. The food was presented well and in a timely fashion. The appetizer wings were delicious! Plenty of table space at this location. Enormous tvs by the bar! At the right angle one could watch a game from a regular table or booth. All host were well mannered and presentable. Overall great place. Only downfall was one female server that did not want to go above and beyond the call of duty by informing us that ""ok, your server will take care of you."""
Susie D.,"Vienna, VA",0,20,20,4.0,10/12/2014,Always get good food and service. At busy times the bar can be slow but hasn't been a problem for me. We enjoy the ambiance and am glad for another place to eat in the neighborhood.
Lynn M.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,71,3,5.0,6/26/2014,Eat here! I frequent this place and have been eating here at least one time each week for the last 2 months (which is when I found out about this semi hidden gem) Flat screen TV's everywhere! Food is great! Prices are amazingly low! Service has been terrific every time!
Lisa M.,"Gainesville, VA",0,33,1,4.0,6/7/2014,"Getting better. =) We started off questioning service, with no utensils, an empty glass for some time before a refill was offered, and extremely slow appetizers (a.similar experience our first/previous visit i think), but had an overall very good experience here! The food was excellent (MUCH better than our first time here) and our waitress came through and got us what we needed. It was very crowded/busy. We did wait longer than expected to be texted or table was ready and still needed to wait, once there, but the text feature was great and so convenient."
Richard B.,"Springfield, VA",87,15,,3.0,12/13/2013,"A friend recommended the pizza, was pretty good but didn't wow me. The bar was well planned out, your eyes are drawn to it. I will definitely visit again."
Jo M.,"Fairfax, VA",19,209,1,2.0,11/25/2013,service was really bad.  it wasn't a matter of politeness but perhaps because it's still new the kitchen and servers were out of sync.  had to call the manager over which we rarely do. the food - well.  the thick crust pizza was no better than pizza hut's pan pizza from back in the day when it was edible.  i wouldn't want to pay $24 for that.  the salmon...wish i could've tasted it but it arrived 30 minutes after the other entrees and it was very obviously undercooked.   i don't plan on going back for a long time.
Chrissy M.,"Springfield, VA",2,7,,1.0,9/26/2014,"If you are planning to have a work function here, please reconsider. While the food is decent, the service we had for ten people at lunch today was terrible., even though we gave the restaurant a week's notice that we were coming. I had planned for an enjoyable afternoon to celebrate the milestones of three of my colleagues, but having lunch here and having to put up with the terrible service put a damper on everyone's afternoon. By the end, everyone at the table was complaining and I was embarrassed and apologetic to them for making the reservation and wasting their time. We had to plead with the wait staff to take the drink orders at our table. Then it took forever for the drinks to come and we gave up asking for refills. One of the managers did give us waters and refills after we complained. She said one of her servers had an accident and they were short staffed and unprepared for the Friday lunch crowd. Not a good reason to me given the size of the restaurant. Good service should not be based on the absence of one server.  Our meals finally came out 1.5 hours later, and not all at the same time.  My meal never came until I complained. When it did come, they forgot the side salad I requested. Same w another coworker. We were forced to eat our colleagues' fries while we waited. Another co worker never got his appetizer but gave up asking. It took even more time to get our checks.  By the end of the meal, we had spent 2.5 hours at the place, time we don't have to waste when we are all trying to get back to work.  BJs did give myself and a coworker of mine our meal for free, and took ten percent everyone else's order, but the damage was done. We never did get a decent apology. An afternoon of celebration turned into one of frustration, anger, and disappointment for all.  BJs needs to hire more staff and better train them if it wants to stay open. All of agreed to never recommend it to others. I meant to plan an afternoon to boost morale, but the service here killed it. In fact, I had brought a birthday cake and planned to cut it at BJs, but decided to take it back to the office and serve it since we were all so desperate to leave by the end of the afternoon."
