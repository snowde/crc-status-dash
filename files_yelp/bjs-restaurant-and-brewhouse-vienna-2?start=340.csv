Rob B.,"McLean, VA",0,10,,3.0,6/7/2014,"Delicious beer served in pint glasses that probably aren't a full 16 ounces like the bartender said because we questioned the fact that the menu said ""pint"" but the glass the beers were served in were definitely not 16 ounces which is what the bartender said.   Maybe we are wrong but we know the difference between a US pint and an imperial pint which is 19.2 ounces or 3.2 ounces more than a US pint which is 16 ounces.  Either way there's no way those skinny glasses are pint glasses they have to be less than 16 ounces when filled to the top!  The happy hour food was average tasting nothing great and exactly what you pay for is what you get.  We thought the boneless wings tasted like the Tyson brand boneless wings you can buy in this big plastic bags at the super market.  Overall beer was great but the appetizers we had at happy hour were pretty average and typical reheated/frozen food.  $4 gets you 4 or 5 small boneless wings during happy hour, to us at $1 per boneless wing for happy hour is  not a good deal at all."

Joanne M.,"Sterling, VA",0,15,,4.0,6/17/2014,"We came in on Monday, no knowing about the world cup. A team scored in the first few seconds we arrived and the noise was unlike anything I've ever heard, so we left. We came back the next day and it was pretty quiet, so I assumed I just came at a bad time. Our waitress was very friendly and she was very knowledgeable about the beers. She said later that it was her first flight solo, which I wouldn't have guessed had she not told me.  We got to taste some beers. I don't like beer in general, but there were a few I actually enjoyed. I really liked the hand made sodas. I got to try the black cherry, orange, root beer and cream soda.  My kids ordered from the kids menu. It was fine. I will say that the kids burger was hand pressed which was good and she said the bun was really good. They put the lettuce, tomato and pickles on the side, which is nice, so that my kid didn't have to pick them off. If you want cheese, be sure to ask for it, because it came without. I got the thai shrimp lettuce wraps, which were really good and my husband got the fish and chips which he liked. The big winner here was the dessert. We tried 4 types of the pizookie, which is a deep dish cookie with a scoop of ice cream. The peanut butter was okay. It tasted like Subway's peanut butter cookie. The triple chocolate was fine. My kids and husband really liked that one. The chocolate chunk was good, but I really liked the salted caramel. It was a hot mess in the best way possible. It was chocolate chip cookie batter and had chocolate and white chips. There was caramel and pretzel chunks. Overall, it was a good experience. I always get worried about freshness when I see a menu that large, but the items we got were really good."
Nims I.,"McLean, VA",0,37,,2.0,6/5/2014,"Service is terrible, and other than a burger or pizza, the food is terrible.  First visit, our family of 3 had two burgers and a pizza.  It was great, even though the service was sooooo bad.  Second time, disappointed again in service, and the same burger was disappointing and the tacos really not good.  Third time, chicken lettuce wraps consisted of a bowl of cubed chicken with mushrooms and celery swimming in a watery broth -- so disgusting can't even think about it!  Asian chicken salad horrible!! Stuffed mushrooms bland and watery.  Were there for 40 minutes, never got our water glasses refilled.  FYI, all visits were on a weekend."
mark b.,"Arlington, VA",1,10,,1.0,11/18/2013,Very underwhelmed place reminds me of a really bad Cheesecake Factory. Cumbersome menu (like 20 pages!)...why don't these places have a two page menu and get the food right. Food was mediocre to bad. Service was embarrassingly bad. The server kept on trying to push beer/liquor/apps/ and a points program that he knew nothing about. I hope the beer is good at the very least.
Cindy D.,"Reston, VA",62,14,,5.0,11/4/2013,"We have driven by it a few times and finally stopped. This place was awesome. From the hostess upon entering to the server(Shane), to the GM, who came up to our table, these people know how to run a restraunt!!!!  the food was great and the craft beers from the brewery were spectacular. Way to go guys.....other places should take lessons...thanks for a great night!!!!!"
Grace B.,"Herndon, VA",1,33,,4.0,5/19/2014,"So glad to finally see BJ's on the East Coast. I went here all the time when I lived in California and I've been to this one twice now. The service the first time was on a packed Friday night and extremely slow, but it was right near when they first opened and again the place was so full. The waiter was still as attentive as possible but I think we were there a little over 2 hours (group of 8) and we didn't really mind the wait. We ordered a variety of items; beer, apps, pizza, entrees, dessert and everything tasted great! The second time I went the waitress was efficient but not very cordial. I would have rated BJ's a 5 but the service brought it down a little. Priced right depending on what you want, beer is good, and if you go, absolutely save room for the Pizookie!"
Jen T.,"Destin, FL",15,88,169,2.0,2/1/2014,"My CEO invited me to lunch and we decided to try this new place in Tyson's located next to Nordstrom Rack. One star for immediate seating which is infrequent in the Tyson's area. But now I know why. The other star is for the atmosphere. A nice bar area with a dining room with ample room in booth seating. Our server quickly walked by as my boss wanted to ask a question about the menu. She replied that she didn't have time. A few minutes later, she came back and asked for our drinks. I asked her a question on the lunch menu about the lunch salad and soup combo but she didn't know what was in the salads. I had to look through the menu for the other section that had the description. I ordered the tortilla soup (can you tell I love this soup?) and BBQ chicken chopped salad with the dressing on the side. The soup came out with chicken, tortilla chips, and avocado in the bowl and a separate pourer (looks like a creamer) that contained the broth with corn. The food runner poured the broth into the bowl before serving. I thought it was odd for a casual dining establishment. First bite/sip...cold!! Cold soup on a freezing day or any other day is definitely a no no! Okay moving on, maybe the salad will be better. The lunch portion salad had the dressing on it. I prefer to have my way on how much dressing which is why I ask for it on the side most of the time. The salad was okay...nothing spectacular- iceberg lettuce, few chicken chunks, avocado, tortilla chip shreds, corn, black beans, and tomatoes. My boss had the shrimp tacos- two sorry looking tacos on corn tortillas with a few tortilla chips on the side. The guacamole side looked like green mayo- where were the avocado chunks, onion, cilantro? Our server pretty much ignored us again when we asked for drink refills. She did come back to tell us about their club program. "" No thanks"" we said. With so many better options in a Tyson's, I rather wait for a table at a place that serves good edible food and quality service. Sorry BJ's!"
MI R.,"Midlothian, VA",0,46,,3.0,3/26/2014,"Convenient place for a quick lunch for two. Service was fair, not really attentive. The Avocado egg roll was a popular item and was good. The lemon thyme chicken and the lettuce wraps were good. Nice variety of craft beer. I would check it out again."
Suzanne L.,"Lanham-Seabrook, MD",0,5,,2.0,4/10/2014,"We were in BJ's with friends it took them hour & half to bring the food and the funny thing was they were not busy.  When they brought the food my husband said to the manager that his food is cold and he replied that the plate was hot, at that point my husband got upset and said I'm not eating the plate and he send it back and cancelled his order.  We used to go there often, but after this we will not going back."
Ryan K.,"Falls Church, VA",72,226,12,4.0,11/18/2013,"Went back for a 2nd try for a HH bday and service was great, drinks good and food was quick. Definitely a new go to especially for the games on tv."
Jamie H.,"Arlington, VA",1,6,,5.0,2/17/2014,We only came for drinks so I can't comment on the food however the bar experience was awesome. Great deals-so cheap and great beer. Matthew was super attentive and friendly. Can't wait to come back!
Michelle D.,"New Rochelle, NY",99,31,5,4.0,10/31/2013,"We came here for the soft opening of this BJ's in which there was a set menu and the dinner was free with the exception of drinks. I have been to many of the bjs restaurants in California and Vegas and have to say the service and food are usually the same across the board. If you have never been here which would be most people in this area since it's brand new, I 100% recommend it. The restaurant itself is the perfect place to watch sports games or to just hang out with friends. For a restaurant and brew house with games on... There aren't many places that can compare to the food and drinks and desert in that type of atmosphere. They usually have some sort of happy hour deals which with so many businesses around the area it really is perfect for after work drinks and food. Some of my personal favorite menu items.. The chicken wings appetizer, chicken potstickers,  baked potatoes and of course the pizookie! If you've never had one you must... I'm not sure if it's because this restaurant is brand new or what but the pizookie I had here the other night was probably the best one I've had. Definitely try it out if you haven't.. They've got a pretty diverse food and drink menu and just all around solid place to hang out with friends."
Seth G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,1,,5.0,11/17/2013,"BJs was perfect. They had a great beer selection and the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and helpful with picking out a draft beer I would like. The beer was awesome, the wings were awesome, the game was on, the service was great. Parking was super easy, right underneath the restaurant. I also am not wild about dealing with all the hassle of the mall so BJs is a great option in Tysons without having to go in the mall. Right on Rt 7 next to the Nordstrom Rack, DXL, and Neisha Thai (best thai in Tysons by the way)."
Sarah G.,"Falls Church, VA",0,4,,4.0,1/9/2014,First visit to this location. The service was good. Food was good. Pizookie are a must!! Loved the small bites which are a great price deal. Will come back.
Mikhaile Y.,"Falls Church, VA",3,5,,1.0,11/29/2013,OK I been to this place as a customer and as an employee friends if you are for corporate slavery than BJ'S is the place for you with a beer to put it bluntly as a server the supervisors that people think of coming to every table are instructors that report anything and everything at times they stand so close to the server that the server thinks that there gonna kiss them or the server should tell them hey buddy I got a pocket full of tictacs  take as many as you like but going to the service part of it well of course all servers want to give good service so that we can make good tips we don't come to work for free but the corporation is like another Fridays or Bennigans BJ'S shows so much animosity towards the staff that when one tries to spice up a pizza with spices the instructors flip out explaining the cost of spices a company that just spent 6.8 million is going to worry about the cost of spice perhaps the spice was 6.8 million and the restaurant was a side show each and every server loses money coming to work and for a company that says it is green it is far from it for it does not recycle only the glass but what about paper its all a sham a big laugh the management is always at the throats of team members the prices are over priced and when a staff member wants modifications the instructor is told to not listen than scolds you for ordering with modifications for example meat on cheese is not kosher and pork is not kosher at all so all they had to say is something small but what do they say your not important the guest is well at that time I am buying something that I am paying for so it is important my point is the company does not treat its employees with importance why would they treat the customers that they are important. By the way I have no animosity towards BJS I get  one every morning and every night
Robert L.,"Vienna, VA",0,13,,2.0,11/20/2013,"The atmosphere is great - roomy and well-designed, with a friendly staff. But if you're going to call yourself a ""Brewhouse,"" and brew your own beer, it better be good. It wasn't. I had the sampler, and the only difference in the four was the color; otherwise they tasted pretty much the same. Sweet, bland and no hop flavor. These are beers brewed for the Bud crowd who think they're getting something unique. And there wasn't much of a selection of non-BJ's beers. My family was happy with their entrees, which looked good. But I had the ""deep dish"" pizza, and it was a huge disappointment. It was simply a regular pizza with a very thick, doughy crust. This is not Chicago-style pizza, this is carbo loading. The places reeks of a corporate concept heavy on looks, and deliberately bland as far as food and beer go to appeal to the masses."
Anh L.,"McLean, VA",56,28,2,1.0,3/30/2014,"This place has the worst service in the Tysons area. I've been here 5 times and it got worse each time. I sat at the bar the last time on a Saturday and the place wasn't even busy, but the bartenders walked past my empty glass 4 times and I couldn't even get their attention to get another beer. It also took 45 minutes for my appetizers to come out. When it finally came out, the person sat next to me (whom I did not know) even commented on it and said:""that took long enough."" The bartender heard it and gave him an attitude and responded: ""I wasn't the one putting the order in but thanks for looking out bro."" What the heck? Is that how you talk to your customers? Shame on them. I don't know if their management ever reads these reviews but they really need to re-train their staff. BJ's is not that popular in the DC metro area so people are still coming to this new location, but if service is not improved, they'll lose their customers soon."
Mary S.,"Vienna, VA",0,8,,1.0,1/8/2014,"We visited BJ's for the first time on January 3rd.  Really, really wanted to love it.  The ambience is pretty cozy for a place with warehouse-type ceilings.  The service was excellent, and my kids loved their house-crafted root beers and cream sodas.  For our apps, we had traditional buffalo wings which were really yummy.  We also got spinach and artichoke dip which was very bland; would never order it again.   One son had a half order of the ribs and loved them.  Another had flatbread pizza and thought it was pretty good. I ordered the Original Roast Beef Dip sandwich -- which really, how can you mess up? Well if it's warm on the outside and refrigerator cold on the inside, it's awful. I couldn't believe it.  Literally the underlayer of cheese was in the same condition as if you'd just peeled it off a stack from the deli.  BUT the worst. . .my husband ordered a caesar salad with cajun shrimp. I tasted half of one -- the shrimp was lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside.  Just like my roast beef.  The next day, he was sick to his stomach like he's never been before. Took him 24 hours before he was back to normal. Needless to say, I'll never be able to get him to give BJ's a second chance. Honestly, the Bennigans we'd had a week earlier was a hundred times tastier and much less expensive."
