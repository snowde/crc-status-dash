David R.,"Montgomery Village, MD",166,148,963,2.0,11/10/2016,Slow service. Wrong order.  Pricey pizza. Seven unbusssd tables in our section (I counted).  Multiple dirty dishes and glasses left on the table.  Really really bad tasting anchovies.  Incorrect bill.  Return? Unlikely.
Christine D.,"McLean, VA",35,69,75,3.0,3/13/2017,This place was okay! Really good ambience nice big bar! Came on a Sunday! I wish they were a Sunday fun day specials during the day! The weather was really slow but all in all everything was good! Had the wings they were good! Tons of beers on tap!
Gigi F.,"Arlington, VA",3,12,2,5.0,8/16/2017,"Brought my little brother here because I had such a great meal last time. I told him to get a burger because they have the best burgers here and boy was he glad. He couldn't stop raving about how delicious the burgers were. Great food, great service and convenient location !"
J M.,"Arlington, VA",3,161,,5.0,12/4/2016,"We've been coming here for almost a year now. Every time, we leave very satisfied (and full). Although we've had several dishes, the deep dish pizzas are why we keep coming back. Back on Veterans' Day, we came during the 6pm hour (we normally come in around 5pm). BJ's was really busy and they appeared short-staffed. Our dinners took more than a half hour and came out incorrect. Fortunately, management apologized and eventually brought out what we ordered. Management also comped our incorrect orders, which is why I rated this place 5 stars."
Charming P.,"Miami, FL",2,112,67,2.0,10/15/2016,We called for reservations but something happened and we had to wait an addtl hour. The bar area was nice- the bartenders was attentive.  We finally got our table. Took about 15 min for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  Food came out cold. Our server was nice but I can tell she was overwhelmed or short staffed?! She tried.  I doubt I will ever come back to this place.
Lynda N.,"Arlington, VA",215,27,15,2.0,6/10/2017,"Every time I come the service sucks, the food is mediocre, the everything is so slow. Honestly not worth the visit. It takes about at least 45mins to get your food..."
Jerold C.,"Fairfax, VA",0,6,,1.0,9/9/2017,"Service here sucks. Should have know when coming on a typically busy lunch hr on a sat. and absolutely no one around. Waitress seemed on another island. Hostess didn't bother to ask for my rewards card/id to scan. Food typical of other BJs. What distingushs them apart is service. If thats something u value, don't come here."
Niro W.,"Gaithersburg, MD",109,131,235,3.0,11/7/2016,"I had more expectations from this restaurant! Its a spacious place, they got a bar and lots of choices on the menu. I had the Mozzarella sticks and the Hickory Brisket Burger, and it wasn't all that. The service itself was alright, but could have been better."
Luis C.,"Aberdeen Township, NJ",96,55,88,4.0,12/11/2016,"Great selection of beers, some their own.. Love the crispy jalapeno burger with the string fries..."
Alex B.,"Vienna, VA",284,160,26,3.0,5/21/2016,"I regretfully went here a second time with my boyfriend because he wanted the pizza last time we were here and did not get his way the first time so he got it this time. Our server was MUCH MORE attentive, obviously she is considered a better server as she was training a new server for the job. I ordered the roast beef melt and it was HUGE, but tasted great! I ordered a glass of merlot and they give you a lot of wine for the price.  I had a better experience this tie around and am happier."
A T.,"Sterling, VA",3,89,39,3.0,5/8/2017,"It was crowded on a Friday night but we got a booth at the bar with no wait.  It's really, really loud in there.  Forget trying to hear each other.  There was happy hour ($1 off drinks) which isn't all that great, but it's something.  I ordered a sirloin and veges.  I thought it was really small when it arrived (it looked more like a filet) but it was just a small steak. Cooked almost right (a little red for a medium but not enough to bother me). It was tasty, no complaints and I got full for sure.  They brew their own beers, and also have other local brewery beer which is a little odd but I like it.  My friend got a spicy pizza and said it was REALLY spicy.  I ate one jalapeno (I eat them often, yeah they're spicy but what do you expect)... however, I have to say that jalapeno on her pizza was definitely spicier than a normal one!  It's a bit out of the way for me to go often, but I'm not sure how often I could take the loudness if I were closer."
Asma K.,"Alexandria, VA",1,8,7,2.0,12/20/2016,"The only good thing about this place was the food and the place looked amazing. Service was terrible! Absolutely terrible. We arrived at 4, and the waitress did not come to take our order until 4:20. May I add, the place wasn't crowded at all for a Monday afternoon. They brought our food after 5pm. I don't know why it took so long since we were the only people in the dining section. Our waitress was also very rude, and did not show much professionalism. I'd only come back for take out next time. Nothing more."
Fred K.,"Rockville, MD",227,389,1420,3.0,2/18/2015,"3 stars. I was really excited about trying their food as I came here before just to try their beers (like their blonde and piranha beers and glad you can order pitchers!).  Their bar is great with decent happy hour ($1.50 off their beers or something like that) and love their big TV in the bar. Speaking of, not too many tv's in their main dining room, which is good. Don't like seeing so many tv's in main dining room unless it's a sports bar.  The food was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Their deep dish pizza (we got BJ's Favorite) was decent. Wasn't bad or wasn't great. I've had better pizza at other brew houses (Dogfish Head Alehouse comes to mind; even though it isn't deep dish).  I did like their house salad and their spinach artichoke dip was ok (too much cream cheese).  Come here for their tasty beers. Good selection of beers. Prefer BJ's style of beers compare to German style beers Gordon Biersch makes. Glad it is here in the DMV!"
Mandie M.,"Arlington Heights, IL",15,35,2,5.0,6/5/2017,Ha a lovely time here- great food and drinks.  The tomato-basil tavern cut pizza was fantastic!!!  Our server was a delightfully helpful gentleman who helped me to choose drinks based on my preferences- a true asset to this location! I am only disappointed that I cannot have some of that wonderful berry burst cider shipped to the Chicago burbs!!
Erica G.,"Temple Hills, MD",74,9,,5.0,2/26/2017,I don't know who makes that Southern fried chicken dinner in the kitchen but as of lately it's been delicious and full of flavor. It's my favorite dish kudos to the cooks!
Susan N.,"Vienna, VA",23,9,1,2.0,12/3/2016,"Made reservations for Saturday night, food mediocre, service poor, appearance clean. Probably won't be back!"
Riddhika J.,"Savage, MD",323,169,505,4.0,4/23/2015,"Fresh tap beers, zesty appetizers and best desserts! My friend couldn't stop talking about this restaurant and since I never been to BJ's before, I had to try. The seating was fast, server was very polite. I ordered October fest beer from the tap and it was fresh, rich and toasty. I ordered stuffed mushroom and Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese. We had to wait for good 30 mins for food and we got our appetizers. stuffed mushroom were yummy and melt in your mouth. Although I wasn't happy with my main dish. The server brought me the wrong pizza with meat pieces on it. I had to wait another 20 mins for the right pizza which turned out to be good. Not too greasy or cheesy and fresh toppings. The best part...Their ""Triple Chocolate Made With Ghirardelli"" pizookies. Arrhhh, what a treat. warm crunchy and gooey cookie crust topped with rich chocolate ice-cream. I would definitely go there again for beer and pizzokies."
Maddy L.,"Fairfax, VA",482,230,259,5.0,7/27/2015,"Infamous for their pizookies, BJ's is a great place to eat! Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch - was not packed at all and our server, Monique, was really great. She continuously checked on our table to make sure everything was going good. She also knew the menu well and was patient with our table when we couldn't decide what to get. There is a lot of options for drinks and food, which of course forced me to take wayy longer than necessary to choose. It is in a great location right next to Nordstrom Rack (for all the shopoholics to go to post a great meal) and near Tyson's Corner. We had calamari for the appetizer and it was average - nothing special about it. I ordered the fried chicken which was really good. I love their mashed potatoes and gravy. The fried chicken was perfect although I do wish there was more chicken for it...even though I had to bring home leftovers. It was extremely crispy and tasted so good. My brother in law ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken which I have had before and that is pretty good too. My sister ordered the burger which she claims is top burgers she has had.  Of course, we had to order pizookies at the end. We decided on the white chocolate macadamia and the cookies and cream. Both were so good and come with ice cream on top. This place is a must try. Great service and great food!"
Chrystalle B.,"Falls Church, VA",343,731,421,4.0,4/18/2016,"I originally came here for an accounting dinner. I'm no stranger to this chain as there were a few of them in AZ. I have to say, as sad as I am to see the huge potatoes go, I'm glad that they gave their menu a modern refresher. I very much enjoyed the shareable apps we got, specifically the pot stickers and the stuffed mushrooms. As for the beer, it's the same I had so many years ago. Though I do still enjoy the light sweetness of their cider, I'm more of a Jeremiah Red fan now. I was VERY surprised to see that they offer other brews besides their own now. Count me in for another work happy hour and some inexpensive La Fin Du Monde."
Brandon R.,"Frederick, MD",28,2,,2.0,4/5/2017,"Waited at our table for at least 20 mins, no waiter or waitress came over. There were plenty of waiters just standing around and sitting in the back. Then the hostess comes to our table after nearly 25 mins and says "" I'm sorry I think this section is closed let me move you to a different table"" Mind you the same hostess that seated us in the first place. I'm even a rewards member and frequently dine at BJ'S Restaurants about 2 or 3 times a month. Lastly, there were only maybe 20 people in the whole restaurant.  4:30pm"
