Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",120,400,592,4.0,3/20/2015,"So ignoring the rather unfortunate name of this place, the brewhouse is great for a group happy hour or a fun meet up with a friend. If you sit at the bar, they offer $1 off draft beers (I like the blonde) and discounted appetizers (I love the avocado spring rolls). Last time I went, there wasn't any space at the bar, it was packed, so when we sat down at a booth, the server was super awesome and gave us the happy hour deal at the table anyway. Thanks Mr. BJ!"
Danyeah D.,"Fairfax, VA",2,41,32,1.0,2/11/2017,"Terrible service, I'm sorry....I didn't get any service. Sat at the table for at least 10 minutes, mind you the restaurant was not packed at all. Eventually walked out."
Natalia F.,"McLean, VA",0,3,,3.0,9/14/2017,"I recommend their Southern fried chicken entree! I used to get it all the time before I cut fried chicken out of my diet. Also, the baked beignet is astounding. Other than those items, I'm not a fan of the rest of the menu since I've regretted spending money on dishes I tried there recently. Though, I've heard the Mediterranean pita tacos are good from family and friends. It's a decent price and is convenient since it's right near Tysons Corner mall. Plus, if you're looking for a place that plays sports on TV, they have about 4 regular-sized flat screens and a massive one at the bar that's visible from mostly all seating areas."
Donald P.,"Washington, DC",273,1298,1430,3.0,11/27/2015,They will fill any grower now.  Half priced mini deep dish pizzas.  Bathrooms look clean but sticky floor.  Happy Hour - M-F: 3-7p
Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",903,1367,1441,3.0,10/24/2014,"My husband finally convinced me to stop here for a bite to eat. He had be raving about this place for awhile now. I was pleasantly surprised that this place shares a parking garage with Nordstrom Rack room. So their is plenty of parking and the garage allows access from 7 and when you leave you can drive to the backside of the garage to avoid 7 all together. A major time saver depending on the time of the day. Okay lets be honest, any part of the day since traffic in this area is always bad. I ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. The salmon was cooked to my liking but had a little too much glazed. I really enjoyed the roasted asparagus since it really can accent any good meal.  The best part of this place is their extensive beer list. I really enjoyed the Brewhouse Blonde and would love to try more in the future. The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars was our waiter was on the odd side. Even after writing this review a few months later I can still remember him seeming like a creeper."
Kim R.,"McLean, VA",127,362,651,3.0,4/26/2015,"***3.5*** I've been here a couple of times since my initial review after they first opened and I must say they have definitely worked out their service issues. Our server last night was very fun, cheerful and attentive. This place has such a huge selection of cocktails and beers and the food is pretty good. I'm not a huge fa of pizza but when I do eat it, I prefer deep dish and the crust here is amazing! I ordered the BJ's Favorite mini even though the crust was perfect, the toppings seemed to have just been sprinkled on top and did not get baked in with the cheese. The BF ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and both of our pizza were a bit dry due to lack of sauce. We might need to ask for extra sauce next time! The avocado egg rolls were delicious and I loved the spicy sauce that it came with. As usual, we ended our meal with the pizookie trio because our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. So much of it went to waste but I love that you get to pick any 3 flavors you want! My fave was the salted caramel, his fave was the chocolate chip. As a second dessert I ordered the Berry Burst Cider and loved it. Very refreshing and light on a hot day :)"
Diane W.,"Annandale, VA",0,1,,1.0,10/10/2017,"The absolute WORST customer service!  Don't bother to try this place at all or waste your money. Did a to go order and I was the ONLY Customer in there and they forgot 2 main meals??  Called to speak with manager & all they want to do is argue with you? The guy was condescending and laughing on the phone.  Customer service here is out the door.  They don't want to refund you your money because it's a hassle for them and he says it takes 2 days to go through. Last I checked it should go through on the same day just like my credit card does when I charge something?  Something fishy here! Well you know what,   What a headache! All I wanted to do is have some dinner ready because I gave 2 small kids and NO extra time. This manager is in the wrong field. Whatever happened to Customer satisfaction and the customer being right?  And in this case,  it's not my fault at all. Guys go somewhere where they actually care about their customers. Do not waste your time or money with this lousy place! There are lots of great restaurants out there, go find a better one..."
Dave H.,"Falls Church, VA",0,125,3,2.0,11/25/2015,"I greatly appreciate the GM reaching out and inviting me back to give them another try, which I did last Saturday night. I really wish the experience had gone better and I could update this review with more stars but that is not how the event went.  We were seated at 1914 next to a long table full of 10-13 year old boys, probably the loudest part of the restaurant. There seemed to be other two seater tables that were available and I should have asked to be seated somewhere else but there seemed to be no recognition by the staff of seating couples away from the commotion that boys that age naturally engage create. One of the parents even came over from the other side of the kids table and said half jokingly that we could yell at them when they got too loud. They did get too loud but we did not yell.  The reception by the person at the front desk and the person that seated us was close to indifference.  It was 5 minutes before Emily stopped by our table to tell us she would be with us soon. She returned 3 minutes later and took our order. We got our drinks at 1925. My ice tea glass spent a lot of time empty and a second glass was brought at 1944 but I ate most of the meal with no drink. Our food arrived at 1941. We had the sliders and wedge fries. We both liked the fries and the sliders were okay.  Our server, Emily, was pleasant.  There was no clearing of glasses or dishes throughout the meal. My first empty ice glass stayed on the table for the entire meal. I had a clear view of 4 other tables and saw the same pattern. Guests long finished with plates but no one clearing them.  Staff members looked unhappy to be there."
Rob C.,"Vienna, VA",1,20,9,3.0,6/29/2016,"Update to below review, which was admittedly harsh. Met my daughter for a glass of wine and Flatbread appetizers. Service excellent. Jason was friendly and attentive. Manager followed up to make sure we were taken care of- we were. Good happy hour prices. A whole new atmosphere.  Keep it up, BJ'S. There is a lot of competition in Tysons. Went for lunch at 1 30 with a colleague. Restaurant was not busy by any means, though we took the only booth in the bar area.  Ordered drinks when we sat down. 26 minutes later, no drinks, no water, and table was not wiped down. Of course we walked out and around the corner to Nisha Thai (in the same building). Night and day in comparing service and attentiveness. BJ'S has great ambiance and decor, but it is like the pretty girlfriend or handsome boyfriend with mid double digit IQs. Will only go again if I lose a bet."
Jim L.,"Monument, CO",64,55,25,3.0,4/1/2017,"Typical chain with a Cheesecake factory sized menu... if you can't find what you want here you too damn  picky.  Great place when nobody can decide what they want.  ok beer, I am not a huge fan but that is my preference.  great desserts as well."
Brooks D.,"Ashburn, VA",81,9,,2.0,4/27/2017,"We've been going to BJ's near Tysons for several years now.  They used to have amazing pizza!  Then about two years ago something happened, they changed out all their staff, and now the service sucks out loud with feathers.  There's one or two servers I'll ask for by name but now with the food getting worse and worse I'm not sure even that's worth it.  Even the pizza from the grocery store is better these days.  BTW, even though it's a Thursday Night Special, never order their ribs.  Dry.  Dry, tasteless... I really could have used a couple extra drinks with it but the server of course decided I was done with my glass and took it away.  Come to think of it... they continually decided when I was done with something... even if it was in my mouth... and took away the plate.   Seriously BJ's... get your act together.  Much better service and products out there.  It's easily done."
Truthful Y.,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",0,37,237,2.0,7/29/2016,"The tomato soup was super greasy and the spinach and artichoke dip I would never get again. The chips were served warm and extra greasy. They tasted stale after they cooled down. The food here deserves 2 stars. The bar is ok. The single serve deep dish is good, 3-4 stars. Staff is ok."
Erin M.,"Tysons, VA",1,44,,3.0,4/17/2017,"The food was pretty good, and the service was good up until the end when we had to wait a long time for our check. My main complaint is that we were seated in the bar area for dinner, and there was a large group at the bar that were constantly yelling. I kept waiting for an employee or manager (that kept walking by) to tell them to keep it down, or at least stop YELLING, but no one ever did. I wouldn't have minded if it were later at night but this was like 7:30pm. People are still trying to eat dinner with their families and have conversations, but you couldn't hear anything over their drunken screams."
Sophia S.,"McLean, VA",0,2,,4.0,4/12/2017,"pretty good food, i like it at least! The only thing about that I really dislike are the bathrooms. I went in there to go, and all the sudden BOOM! I saw a bug!!!! Clean that up please! Other than that, it had some of the best chicken nuggets that I have ever tasted in my life! LOVE IT!!!!"
Brian H.,"San Jose, CA",1,23,2,5.0,9/24/2016,"My food was prepared perfectly, Sara, the bartender served me in a friendly way, professionally and competently.  Not much more I want at this price point. Thank you Sara."
Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",451,695,1880,3.0,10/27/2014,"New hours: M-Th and Sunday 10am-10pm, Fri-Sat 10am-12am. I'm not a big fan of these hours, as one of the reasons why I liked coming to BJ's was the late hours. Given the few restaurants in this area that open past 10pm, BJ's was a rare gem.  Service has also gone down. For the past few times, the server has been very slow at coming by the table and our food comes very, very slowly. The upside though is that our servers are always pleasant enough. Traditional chicken wings and pizookies are still my favorite choices here."
Patrick T.,"Washington, DC",336,836,1839,4.0,12/21/2015,Cocktails are ok calamari was not bad. mini deep dish is pretty good pizza.  my favorite of the night was carne asada fries. so cheesy and meaty and delicious food is pretty good. I ordered too much. But sometimes you gotta go big or go home!  Please don't make the mistake of getting 3 pizzookies
Sandy H.,"Manassas, VA",158,155,109,1.0,5/26/2016,I got the balsamic chicken. It was completely burned and this was prime of lunch and no one was there. Made no sense to mess up my food that early. Needless to say the only thing I enjoyed was the dessert but eventually I ended up getting food poisoning. Which everyone in my party of 12 who ordered chicken threw up at work. Do not recommend.
Vyvy H.,"Richmond, VA",518,108,273,3.0,8/6/2014,Unfortunately not the best service I've had here. I've visited on previous occasions where the food and service was great. Decided to come back because of those previous visits.  Sadly this visit wasn't as pleasing as the last. Having experience in the restaurant business you always know that the seat by the bathroom or kitchen door is the last spot a host would put a party if you had other seats in the section available. We were seated next to the bathroom/kitchen door AND next to where all the servers were socializing and folding napkins and forks. Not to mention the fact that host and server were not very friendly. As soon as they finished taking down orders they just plopped to the table beside us to continue socializing. We could hear every single word. And of course our food came out wrong. As much as I liked the food I might not be back anytime soon.
Elle G.,"Fairfax, VA",0,29,,2.0,7/25/2017,"My first time there, with out of town guests (2 young kids), was not great. We were seated right away but waited well over an hour for our food. The waitress was very nice but didn't mention that there would be a long wait. The food was good (3 stars for the food) and the kids ate every bite of the mac and cheese and fries. But we had to cancel our evening plans because we were at BJ's for 2.5 hours."
