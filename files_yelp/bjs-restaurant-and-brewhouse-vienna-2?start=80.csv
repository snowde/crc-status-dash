Dewane D.,"Webster, TX",0,1,,2.0,10/5/2016,"I don't usually write review, but the service here was horrible. It was on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not busy at all. We barely saw our waitress during the time we were seated, she wasn't friendly in the least. It took nearly 15 minutes to simply get a beer. The food was ok; the guacamole burger was fresh, however they use frozen preseasoned fries so they could not offer unsalted fries which we requested and the waitress failed to tell us. The shrimp entree was fine and had good flavor but came with the most pathetic Caesar salad -- limp lettuce and two croutons. To top it all off the machine for credit cards was broken that day and made it difficult to pay, for which the waitress was not apologetic for.  For the premium price and lackluster service and food, we would never return to this location and will not likely ever step foot in a BJs in the future. Diners beware!"
Mel L.,"Frankfurt, Germany",100,354,574,3.0,9/12/2014,"I came here with a couple of my work friends to take advantage of Tuesday's '1/2 off wine' special that goes until 9 pm.  We ordered a couple of bottles of Malbec and it was quite enjoyable. Since I hadn't eaten anything for dinner, I also ordered the Ahi Poke which was delicious. The mix of marinated ahi tuna, avocado, tomatoes and cabbage was unusual, but very tasty. Definitely recommended. The service was friendly, but a little off. I was the last one to arrive of our group and we had to ask the waitress several times if I could get some water as well.  The location itself was really loud between 7 and 9 pm. I was sitting across from my friends and had to lean half way over the table to be able to take part in the conversation. After 9 pm, the patrons around us started to leave, so it got more quiet and I enjoyed that part of the evening a lot more."

Andrew G.,"Washington, DC",1,74,120,5.0,7/20/2016,"Still as delicious as ever. This time around, I got the black cherry float. Omigosh, that was to die for. Seriously. Service was pretty good, especially given it was happy hour.  Definitely would recommend!"
Joie M.,"Boston, MA",0,22,,2.0,5/26/2017,"Ordered pizza and beer. The pizza was great and would give it 4 stars. Service gets a zero. The restaurant was not busy and my waitress did not have a lot of tables; however, every time I needed her, I had to get up to find her. She would disappear. She was slow, looked bored, and not very engaged. Overall, food is fine and if you luck out with service, I guess it could be good."
Tee D.,"Fairfax, VA",0,34,30,3.0,11/9/2016,"I went here for lunch today with my coworkers for the first time. Honestly, food is not good. I ordered the lunch chicken alfredo and clam chowder soup. At first, i asked if soup was included and server said yes, the check came out and it charged me $5 extra. Hrm, well i thought i was included.... so i mentioned to the server and he said well lunch is not included. Well... hello! I asked you...!! maybe he was busy whatsoever. But soup was salty and pasta did not have enough alfredo sauce on it. Over all, im not satisfy...:/"
Elli S.,"Washington, DC",0,17,,5.0,7/18/2017,"Great spot for a variety of food at a decent price (hard to find in Tysons!) Our server was great and let me make a bunch of modifications to my salad, which was nice. Will be back =)"
Kristian V.,"Washington, DC",1,19,2,1.0,4/30/2017,"I absolutely love this restaurant chain BUT the Tyson's location is by far the worst I've been to. I went yesterday with three other people and the customer service was terrible. We sat down at our table and waited about 15 minutes, no waiter stopped to check on us. We had to flag a waiter passing by and ask if we could get someone to help us and it turns out that once he tapped our waiter , she completely and deliberately ignored us and went to wait on a neighboring table. I was really upset but instead of complaining we decided to leave. I was extremely offended that a waiter would do that to me and my friends. I don't recommend the Tyson's location to anyone, better luck somewhere else."
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,5.0,3/19/2014,"THERE IS A BJ'S ON THE EAST COAST!!! I was sooo amazed at this fact.  I had many a dinner at the BJ's in Westwood Village during college and it has so much nostalgic value for me.  I had my 21st birthday dinner at BJ's several years ago and have visited countless times for their famed pizookies.  Even though I don't like beer, I've even tried their beer sampler.  BJ's is close to my heart and though the BJ's in Tysons Corner (McLean, VA) was not exactly the same as the Westwood one (and had quite a different layout, as it was flatter), it was still a great experience.  My boyfriend and I visited this past Monday, since I've been talking about wanting to visit this place ever since I found out it existed.  The Cali girl inside of me was so happy to try this place, even though we drove through snow to get here.  I ordered one of their famed pizzas - the Buffalo Chicken (individual sized), which came with diced celery, red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in hot and spicy buffalo sauce, drizzled with ranch dressing and buffalo sauce.  The pizza was absolutely delicious and was a big enough portion that I had leftovers for the next day.  My bf ordered the pulled pork sandwich and enjoyed it. I also ordered a couple drinks - their Pomegranate Sunset (""Stoli Razberi Vodka | PAMA Pomegranate Liqueur | BJ's Fresh Squeezed Lemonade | Orange Juice | Monin Pomegranate"") and the BJ's Mojito (""BACARDI Limón Rum | BJ's Signature Mojito Mix | Muddled Fresh Mint | Club Soda"").  Both were excellent! My bf, per usual, ordered beer.  But BJ's, a microbrewery, is known for their beers, so I think he got the more authentic BJ's experience of the two of us. For dessert, my bf ordered the pizookie and LOVED it.  It's nice they have a mini-size option because we were stuffed at that point.  Unfortunately for the chocolate-hater that I am, I couldn't really have a pizookie (they only had chocolate options), so I opted for the equally-appealing BJ's baked beignet (bakery crust dough baked to a golden brown, tossed in cinnamon and sugar and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream, fresh strawberries, a drizzle of strawberry puree and fresh whipped cream). BJ's is amazing - so many awesome options to choose from, really fresh food, and great portion sizes.  I will certainly be back!"
Imran A.,"Fairfax, VA",9,22,22,4.0,8/5/2015,"Good place to eat, I had the pizza and fish  The pizza was deep dish.  Was really good.  The fish was also good.  Cooked really well Great service.  Everyone was very nice. I went there for the buy 1 get 1 free deal  Nice big clean place.  Good place to eat"
Leo Y.,"Silver Spring, MD",1,10,1,1.0,6/15/2017,"Bad bar service, ordered calamari appetizer, came cold, bar tender is non attentive for slow night"
Brianna B.,"Winchester, VA",122,6,2,1.0,8/28/2016,Food takes forever to get to the table and isn't even that good. I don't think I'll be back
Stacy Y.,"McLean, VA",0,26,39,4.0,9/20/2015,"I usually stop by BJ brewery for a casual dinner or quick beer a couple times a month. It's close to my house and the food is better than one would expect from a typical brewery restaurant. I especially like the pastas and soups but the ribs and burgers are good as well.  The service is average - nothing to complain about but not extraordinary either. It tends to get loud and crowded during weeknight HH but that's to be expected. It's cool how they offer HH prices during games in football season.  Also on a side note, they have house-made sodas that are really good. My favorite is the orange soda and root beer. They also have  lighter/fit menu options for people who are more calorie-conscious. I haven't tried those but people I've dined with said they were good as well. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a cold brew and hearty meal on a casual weeknight."
Jeanne K.,"Potomac, MD",97,192,308,3.0,2/9/2015,"The pizookie here is definitely a guilty pleasure. If you love desserts and sweetness, you should definitely order it. I think we ordered the 4 variety version, so we chose 4 cookie flavors and 4 ice cream flavors. The cookie cake came out on this humoungous with a mountain of ice cream scoops on it. It was tasty and the cookie was nice and warm, but it was a little too sweet for me.  The reason this place isn't a 4 is because the service was soooo slow. Everything took so long to happen, other than the pizookie. It was also hard to find a waiter and to get their attention. The other food we ordered was okay, but nothing to point out.  Still, if you like sweets, definitely come and try the pizookie."
Michael R.,"Tysons, VA",98,8,8,2.0,3/30/2016,"I've been to a bj's before but this one was rather disappointing. Waiter took a good 10 mins before coming to our table, gf ordered a sangria and was brought the tickled pink drink (which tasted much better than the sangria). After the waiter finally came back for our food order, I ordered the house sirloin steak (medium) which came out well done. Gf ordered the shrimp and asparagus pasta which did not taste that good at all. I think the part that pretty much ruined it was after we sent the dish back and asked for a menu, the waiter took another 10 mins just to bring us the menu.  The food was below average and the service was very poor. Will more than likely not be returning to this location again.  Only giving it a 2 stars because the tickled pink was pretty good and I had a coupon for bogo."
Jackie N.,"Falls Church, VA",378,208,9,2.0,1/15/2014,"Lots of TV's, lot's of seating, lots of HH specials.  This is a good sport especially for the  Tysons work crowd.   My gf and I got strawberry mojitos on HH special for $5.  They were huge and delicious! For food I got the ahi poke appetizer which was meh.  It was pretty basic and boring, but ok since I was starving.  My friend got a BJ's burger without the bun since she's gluten free...so we're probably not the best people to judge the food... Overall, I'd be willing to give BJ's another shot, especially for a nice HH drink."
Ron M.,"Annandale, VA",0,56,7,4.0,1/12/2016,"Went with wifey for a deep dish pizza and a full rack of ribs for lunch. No wait. The prices are a little higher than the average restaurant of its kind, but probably in line with the area (Tysons).  The food itself was good. The pizza was excellent according to my wife - flavorful, and the crust / pesto ingredient combo was crispy on the outside and moist/soft on the inside. The olives and pesto were really good ingredients and she really loved it. The tough part is that for a 14"" deep dish it was $25, which is pretty pricey. I don't know that it's worth a $10 premium over what a comparable pizza would cost at Pizza Hut, though my wife was pretty convinced that the ingredients were better quality. I had the rack of ribs, with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. The sides were just okay. The potatoes weren't lumpy but a bit dry. The brussel sprouts seemed to be a meager amount at first, but when I lifted up the rack about half of the sprouts were underneath. The sprouts themselves had a little balsamic on them; they were roasted and weren't bad, but not great. The ribs themselves were pretty tender; the bone would get pulled out with a gentle pull. They weren't falling apart tender, but the tradeoff was that the glaze had made a lovely crust that was quite delicious. Restaurant seems relatively new and in very good condition. Lots of large TVs everywhere, though you can't necessarily hear them. Very large open spacious area with clear sight lines to many TVs. Bathroom was clean and well kept. I tend to like bathrooms where I can exit without touching anything; here, they have a Dyson airblade and paper towels but the trashcan isn't near the door, so you may have to touch the door to exit. Justin W. was our server. He was excellent - having been to a lot of local competitors like Coastal Flats, Founding Farmers, and Chef Geoff's, his service was better than all of them, including our happy hour favorite, Chef Geoff's. Justin's service was so good my wife actually mentioned it to me unprompted, and I would specifically ask for him again if I were to return."
Cheryl B.,"Washington, DC",0,6,1,1.0,7/16/2016,"Bad food handling. I sent my burger back, they replayed and brought the same burger back.  Stomachs beware!!!"
Nora K.,"Baltimore, MD",50,36,27,3.0,7/23/2015,"I've been to this place twice now. The house-brewered beer selection is good, and the food is solid. I've had a burger and some low-calorie chicken tacos. Both times I have been satisfied with the price and quality combination. The atmosphere is pleasant, as well."
Amanda M.,"Washington, DC",891,603,2931,2.0,11/4/2013,"When you first walk in you gotta love the bar - nice setup plus huge TV.  I'd definitely come here to chill and watch a game at the bar.   Now onto the food.... Make Your Own Deep Dish Pizza - so this is what I came for.  The dough was a tad bit undercooked and instead of a crispy hot crust I got a lukewarm doughy crust.  What's funny is that they brought the stand and then brought the pizza out with tongs and said it was very hot and when I looked there was no steam coming off the pizza and when I touched the pan it was lukewarm at best.  They basically could've carried it out on the palm of their hand.   Piranha® Pale Ale Chili and Cheese Potato  - this was the only potato listed on the menu.  The servers could not locate any other potatoes.  The potato was very plain and the chili was straight out of the can.  There were no green onions and the sour cream came later after eating about 1/3 of it.  The combo came with a salad that we barely touched - it seemed like an afterthought. The Corn Fritters was all dough and no corn.  Corn is super cheap - come on now!  Put some in there - don't call it a corn fritter with only 1 or 2 kernels of corns in each fritter. The Pizookie® Trio had undercooked cookies so tasted like raw dough so they all tasted the same even though we got red velvet, cookies n cream and triple chocolate. I did the beer sampler which allowed me to select 4 mini beers which were $6.95.  I loved that I was able to try different ones and would definitely come back again. And our server was very attentive. GOOD: Atmosphere, great beer and attentive service. BAD: The food."
