Mary S.,"San Antonio, TX",116,63,86,4.0,10/18/2017,BJ's in Waco is a pretty safe visit. The restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly. We waited maybe 10 minutes for a table of 2 on a Sunday evening. Our waiter talked entirely way too fast but reassured us that he wasn't rushing us.  The food is consistently good. We ordered pizza - barbecue chicken (deep dish) and the chicken bacon ranch (thin crust). The pizza was cooked well-maybe not fully as the thin crust was a bit chewy. The ingredients tasted fresh.  They have an extensive beer menu. I ordered the pumpkin shandy! I enjoy more fruity beers so it was amazing for me. Cold beer always makes for a good time. Especially with pizza!  I have heard amazing things about the pizookie but I wasn't able to try it this trip!
Logan K.,"San Francisco, CA",14,34,2,1.0,12/16/2017,"Sat at the bar and order a bacon cheeseburger. The dollar more to add bacon meant I got two wilted, fragile, microwave bacon strips. Burger came with no sauce - no mayo, ketchup, mustard nothing. But it was piled high with iceberg lettuce to give the appearance of heftiness. The fries were cold. I had to track salt down from another table. Asked for ketchup - waited a while and got an empty bottle from the bartender who called me 'bro'.  Asked for a glass of water. Never got it. Asked for a napkin and utensils. Bartender asked if I was done with my plate and replied, 'sweet'. Upside: have 9-10 drinks here. You'll still be able to drive home. This is where you take your spouse when your marriage has gotten stale and you aren't getting laid anymore."
Chloe H.,"Dallas, TX",11,73,2,1.0,11/29/2017,"I usually get the same order when it's To-Go. This recent last time I guess they maybe do not want me placing online orders anymore. My burger buns were rock hard like a brick. The burger was super dry with no spread, as I asked for extra which I didn't get. My salad had chicken on it sparingly and it was frozen! With the wrong dressing that I never get because allergic. The salad was almost $14. I didn't wish to phone in but I couldn't understand why someone thought this was serviceable in any way plus for nearly $26. The guy who was apparently overseeing things that night appeared to not be that concerned. I didn't think it was that hard to fix. I was placed on hold forever. Then he just goes ""well, do you want us to remake it???"" It was said like I shouldn't have called about it. I said I'm far away and I'm hungry right now. He never offered any other remedy for this jacked up order. He never seemed to put forth any concern one bit that I paid nearly $30 and couldn't eat any of it and I couldn't just drive 35 mins back over there. He placed me on hold once again so I just hung up. Made me a meal out of my frig for dinner with scraps (since it was the day before I went grocery shopping) and had to consider it a loss.  I will not be back to this BJ's location anytime soon, especially for To-Go so they can throw you the weak food and run."
Jennifer H.,"Dallas, TX",28,179,97,2.0,1/28/2017,"I stopped in for dinner on a Friday night at 6:30.  The restaurant was already crowded with a 25 minute wait for a table for 6.  The hostess asked if we'd be okay sitting at the bar instead and we agreed that would be okay.  Four us sat down and were ready to wait a few minutes for the other two.  Our waitress came by quickly and took our drink order.  When she returned with our beverages we asked for another 10 minutes.  it took 40 for her to come back by and actually check on us again.   We did order and the food was fine, but the 40 minute wait was really annoying.  Yes, it was busy in the bar.  Yes, we did ask for a few more minutes so the rest of our party could join us before we ordered.  But to have to wait that long should not happen.  We nearly walked out on our tab because of it.  Advice to the manager- have at least one more waitress in the bar on the busiest nights because clearly two wasn't enough and we were overlooked."
Lucy R.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,7,1,3.0,12/27/2017,Great burger but don't expect to see your waiter more than once and make sure that you have to ask for everything like catch up mustard sugar etc. etc. i'm not understanding why waiters and waitresses if they see you're having a burger why don't they assume that you would like some catsup and offer it to you instead of you having to ask for everything. we have not seen our waiter
Justin O.,"South Austin, Austin, TX",116,3,,1.0,10/27/2017,At 1:30 PM it took me and a table of 4 15 minutes to be seated and then 20 minutes to get our drink order. Server rarely checked in on us. Then the food was less than ideal. This is bad.
Nick C.,"Honolulu, HI",61,3,1,3.0,10/17/2017,Good food prices fair all considered. Server jayna was inattentive and did not offer refills and didn't bring after asking as well. She did have her hands full with a lot of large tables and kept the smaller ones like I was at on the backburners. Have had a great time before this experience
Karah C.,"Koloa, HI",0,2,2,1.0,12/3/2017,"Horrible service.  Table of 9 (4 adults, 5 kids) had reservations for 1215 and table was ready. Waiter was so slow.  Orders were right but I am not sure if he had too many tables (only saw him waiting on 2 tables).  He said one order would come out in a minute and 30 minutes later kid didn't have pizza.  Took over 30 minutes to get ticket.  Over 2 hours there and one order was a salad and two adults shared a meal.  He didn't even apologize for the slow service."
Wayne W.,"McKinney, TX",89,164,23,3.0,1/5/2017,We stop in here on our way to or back from Austin where we have Family.  Service is always GREAT!  We enjoy the Beer and Food Selections.  I usually get the Fish and Chips or a Pizza of some kind and it's good.  You basically know what you are getting with a BJs and typically we are satisfied with the overall experience.
Sandi P.,"McGregor, TX",47,1,,5.0,10/28/2017,"We had a fabulous dinner this evening...thank you Anthony you truly are amazing!  Anthony always goes above and beyond to make our visit incredible!  All our other favorite people were also there tonight...Thank you for coming by our table to say hello Katherine (congrats), Ron, and Elena!"
La Juania M.,"Henrico, VA",102,127,189,4.0,11/5/2016,Has something for everyone. The menu can be a little overwhelming. Like that it's starts with the drink menu. I went here for lunch and the service was good and the food came out fast.
Natalie P.,"San Diego, CA",86,309,1138,4.0,6/25/2016,"Came here for happy hour and pizza. I missed the happy hour.. Serving shortly after 7 on a Wednesday night.. However, BJs beer still ranged within the 5-7$ range.  Obviously the pizza is not as it is in Chicago.. But it's a fair attempt.. And still tasty.  I'll come back.. And hopefully I can make the happy hour this time."
Garrett O.,"Lubbock, TX",22,17,16,1.0,11/25/2016,"My wife and I have had many good experiences at various BJ's locations, but unfortunately this one left us dissatisfied. Our waiter didn't seem to understand proper timing. He bugged us a lot at the beginning, was slow to deliver the check, and kept walking away while we were talking. Also, he spilled water. Everywhere. My wife's thyme chicken was also disappointing. Though the flavor was good, the chicken felt like the inside of a McDonald's chicken nugget. It didn't provide the classy BJ's experience we're familiar with."
Maddie D.,"Centennial, CO",6,9,8,1.0,3/17/2017,"Didn't even get to eat at the restaurant. We made a reservation for 7 at 7:00 pm and were notified that we would have to wait a few minutes, which was fine. However, at 7:30 there was still no table. We were told several times the wait was ""just a few more minutes,"" but after over an hour and a half, we took our business elsewhere. Would have been fine with a long wait, however, we had made a reservation well in advance. So disappointed in this terrible customer service, not sure our party will be returning to BJ's unless they get their act together."
Darren C.,"Houston, TX",0,14,,5.0,6/17/2017,"We came with a large group for a family reunion.  Our first restaurant fell through.  At 6 o'clock on a Saturday evening, they accommodated our group of 40 people without blinking.  They seated us immediately, and provided excellent service for a large group.  The food here was excellent. The staff was great. They have a great variety of good food. If I had any complaint, is that the menu has too many options, and it was really hard to decide what to order. Thank you for an amazing dinner."
Justin F.,"Waco, TX",0,9,,5.0,6/7/2017,If you can get to the bar go there.  These guys take care of their guests. Jambalaya is my go to dish. Nice spice. For the adventurous go for the extra spicy.  That and a Jeremiah Red is the bomb.
Cynthia C.,"Carrollton, TX",37,635,595,5.0,7/10/2016,"This is one of the only ""nice"" restaurants people in Waco go to, so try to make a reservation if you're coming for dinner on a weekend. Maybe even on the weekday if you want to be safe. Very consistent quality and service, and I'm not kidding when I say that I've loved everything I've ordered here. The servers are excited to serve you and handle large groups very well. I come here quite often with 15+ people at a time and the whole group has always left happy."
Camryn A.,"Hewitt, TX",15,54,7,3.0,5/19/2017,"Over priced chain food, but still good. Their redemption is in the bar. Whoever does their bar selection, does it well. Craft liquors of every kind and always a new beer to try. Worth visiting during their great happy hours. 1/2 bottles of wine and you call it's. I would pass for a full dinner, but happy hour and appetizers can not be beat. Great for watching the big games too. 3 stars for price only."
James J.,"Lorena, TX",0,9,,5.0,9/7/2017,The food here is always good. The service is amazing. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Waco.
Casey G.,"Waco, TX",0,17,,5.0,12/20/2016,"Service is usually good and quick. Classic grilled cheese with some avocado? I was sold. Also, the martini called ""Pink Cadillac"" is very sweet but definitely sneaks up on you! I had 2 of them one day at lunch with my boyfriend and his mother and I felt very nice walking out that day. Haha!"
Brooke H.,"San Diego, CA",60,13,8,4.0,12/3/2016,Sat in the bar and ordered a beer and some queso and a salad. The foods was good as usual but what made this experience extra great was Charlie. She was the bartender on duty and she was so friendly and helpful. She made this visit extra pleasant.
Deandrea P.,"Waco, TX",58,7,2,1.0,3/13/2016,"We came to BJs to have a quick dinner for my girlfriend's 21st and it was definitely one of the worst experiences we've had. We typically enjoy BJs and come here often, I'm not sorry to say that we won't be dining here again. My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and burger and we had brussel sprouts for an appetizer. The sprouts were burnt to a char, basically inedible. We told our waiter about it and he very casually just shrugged it off without asking if we wanted something else or wanted to get us more sprouts. Then the burger. On the first bite she took out of her burger, she immediately gagged and spit it out. There was a piece of wax paper the size of a post-it note. She even had managed to swallow some of it. She took her plate to the manager, Jeremy, who did not express sincerity whatsoever. Just gave excuses as to what may have happened in the kitchen. You would think that after such an incident a manager would show compassion and at least make the guest feel comfortable. The rest of the dinner was wasteful, all of our appetites were ruined. The manager never made a round back to the table to check or reassure if we were okay. Plus, they had forgotten to send out the birthday pazookie that was well deserved. Not to mention the service was slow. Edit: she talked to the manager, his excuse was that service was slow. I doubt that since the entire time he sat himself at the bar with another person repeatedly throughout our dinner, you can see him (purple shirt) in the attached picture. Also notice the obvious ""crowd"" showing BJ's too busy on a Sunday night.  Please avoid this establishment. It's obvious in the other reviews the management here is shot, not to mention that someone else was served burnt brussel sprouts. This won't poison our birthday celebration though."
Richard L.,"San Marcos, TX",243,11,,5.0,10/17/2016,"My Wife accidentally dropped her phone in between the booth and the adjoining wall. The cover of the booth was able to come off, but the phone was stuck underneath and unable to be retrieved. They put multiple workers (during lunch/business hours) on it trying to get the phone. No luck. Hours later and a manager unscrewed the booth (no easy task) and retrieved the phone. 5 Stars for BJ's Customer Service. Made a bad situation into a good one. Don't know many places that would go through all of that to help a customer. They unscrewed a booth!  Food was great. Will be back whenever I am in town. Earned a loyal customer BJ's!"
Dee S.,"Woodway, TX",0,1,,1.0,9/10/2016,"Tonight we came in just for the triple cookie dessert and coffee. Our coffee was barely warm and our desserts were served in to-go foil pans? Rather esthetically unappealing and it was cold. The ice cream did not melt on the cookie.  We told the waitress we would kindly like a refund for the dessert and our check for the coffee... The manager came over and gave us some excuse that they really needed more plates but corporate would not send them. Is this my concern? I just want a warm, beautifully served dessert that I want to break my diet for.manager should have gave us a $10 gift card to come back for dessert when they can serve us properly. Where is customer service?"
Jane B.,"Marlin, TX",0,62,,4.0,11/15/2016,"My husband and I had lunch at BJ's today, and I must say we enjoyed the service and the food. We both had panini (caprese and meat lovers) which were quite good. We had the crispy fries with the panini, and they were crispy, hot, and fresh. The marinara sauce could use a little work--rather bland but you don't have to dip the panini. Now, about the beer--I had Oasis Amber and it was superb. My husband started with the Nutty Brewnette which he really liked, and then had Jeremiah Red, which he liked even better. The list of beers is slightly overwhelming, but given time we'll work our way through the list. Our waitress was attentive and quick--good service without hovering or being overly familiar. We'll be back--me for the food and my husband to try out a couple more beers!"
John R.,"Houston, TX",23,2,,5.0,6/18/2017,This place was excellent we were there for a family reunion. We were scheduled to eat at Chedders couldn't get a straight answer about reservations for a group of forty they told us to show up early so we did and the they told us another 1.5 to 2 hour wait. I called BJ the manager on duty June 17 around 8 pm said he will get us taken care of if we could be there in 10-15 minutes i said yes. When we got there they had set up a table for 40 people we had 3-4 servers to wait on us. The service was excellent the food was hot and great thanks to BJ we survived our outing.
Seth J.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",39,55,13,3.0,5/25/2015,"I almost gave BJ's4 stars, as I do really like them, and generally enjoy myself eating there. I just couldn't do it though. This trip, the service was decidedly sub-par, with the blame lying squarely on the waitress. Long wait between being seated and greeted, drink refills were rare, etc.  When at BJ's we always get the avocado egg roll appetizer. Yum.  The husband and I both ordered Cajun dishes this time, and it is clear that the kitchen didn't truly understand Cajun food. All the right elements and flavors were there, but both dishes lacked that little oomph that makes Cajun so special.  The biggest reason I cannot give BJ's the fourth star is inconsistency. Some of their dishes on the menu are decidedly above-average. Their ahi tuna salad, for example, is (was? It's been a while since we've ordered one) stellar. Sadly, other dishes are just average. I've not had anything bad, per se, but some things we've had are just ok at best."
Scotty H.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",47,2,,5.0,10/21/2016,Not a lot of good craft beer places around Texas if you are from up North (New England area) and want to find amazing beer definitely come here! Happy hour was awesome! $4 Bourbon Barrel Stout $6 apps! I will definitely come back if I'm here again! Very chill brewery type atmosphere. Quality food.
Jeff G.,"Houston, TX",7,49,75,4.0,2/8/2017,Great enthusiastic service. Food is tasty. Had the bbq bison burger which was full of flavor. Good crispy fries and slaw with the burger. Last night I had the seared ahi salad. Great taste and good portions. Service was always quick and with a smile.
RT W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,5,,2.0,4/4/2016,"My travels this week take me to Waco, TX with a group of four. We were looking for something close by the hotel, decided on BJ's.  We were seated quickly and our server was very personable!   Once we all ordered, the food started coming out one at a time and the person delivering had no idea which person it went to. Two of us ordered ribeye steaks and the had to bring them out three different times as the person running the food had no idea if it was med rare or medium. I ended up returning my steak as my med rare was  cold rare.  I would not recommend eating here but the beverage selection is good! Chef Boy RT rates this two stars only and a no return rating."
Emilie E.,"Houston, TX",24,13,,2.0,7/17/2016,"Food is good if you don't mind the poor service and long wait times. Not really kid friendly, but ok if your party is small or you are on a date night and don't mind waiting."
Chelsea J.,"San Angelo, TX",80,59,77,3.0,3/27/2015,"The menu here is gigantic, the ambiance is open and modern, the food is underwhelming, and the service mediocre. Our server was pleasant, but rushed us into ordering.  She wasn't very attentive to drinks after that and disappeared for (no exaggeration) 20 minutes when we needed a ToGo box, leaving us in customer purgatory. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken, and my boyfriend had the gluten-free pizza. We had fried artichoke for appetizer. The food came out promptly, had appetizing texture, and was bland.  We might give this place another try for dinner so we can try the beer."
Nate M.,"De Beque, CO",0,4,,5.0,3/7/2016,"My first trip to BJ's. Amazing place!  We were in Waco on a pretty stressful trip and just needed a good meal near our hotel, so we dropped in. Robert sat us and was our waiter, he was absolutely great! Friendly, high energy, really brightened up our day. He recommend the BJ's Special deep dish pizza, It was great. Fresh, flavorful meats and veggies. I didn't taste the other entrees, Ribeye and Parmesean Chicken, but everyone raved about them. Steak was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy med rare. We will definitely be back next time we're in Waco!"
Robin A.,"Waco, TX",0,54,77,1.0,8/11/2016,Really expensive for food you can get else where for less that will even taste better. The Spaghetti and meatballs were $15 and none of their meals come with complimentary salads or bread. If you want a house salad it's $4 more. They also got rid of the dish I usually got the shrimp scampi. I won't be going back.
Jesse C.,"Grand Prairie, TX",150,35,119,5.0,1/9/2015,You can't go wrong with picking this restaurant. They have a very expansive menu for a wide range of taste buds. I visited this location while on trip with my students and the service was great. We came in on a Friday night and receive stellar service.  All of our dishes came out fresh and hot! The pizzas are all delicious and the pasta dishes as well.  Our waiter was very patient with us with all of the commotion.
Emily L.,"Missouri City, TX",17,65,75,1.0,8/18/2015,"Currently, sitting in the restaurant writing this one star review and not having to worry about the waiter seeing because HE IS MISSING. When I first read the reviews on this place, I knew I might (will) encounter terrible service. But I did not believe it would be this bad. I knew it would be bad when people were MISSING from the hostess stand. We waited there for a bit, and then were seated. Where quickly again, our waiter seemed to be MISSING. After 15 minutes of waiting, we were all ready to order. And still NO ONE came. When the waiter finally came after who knows when, we quickly told him our whole order and drinks included (because it wasn't taken earlier yet). Our appetizer of fried calamari came, but we didn't have plates to eat it on. Are we suppose to eat it on the table? I think not.  Throughout our meal, waters were not refilled and we watched as our waiter slowly take his time with only 2 other tables. At the end, we ended up waiting for our bill much longer than it took us to eat both our appetizer and 4 entrees. He gave us our bill and we quickly put our credit card in. But once again, our waiter went MISSING. And once again, we waited.  Honestly, the food was not bad. ($81 for a soup in sourdough, pasta, mahi mahi, full rack of ribs, fried calamari). But the service is just so slow. It's honesty almost like a magician secretly doing disappearing acts with the employees."
Diane F.,"Iredell, TX",0,5,,5.0,7/5/2016,We had a small problem with my Grandaughters pizza but the manager quickly rectified the situation. All the food came to the table in one service!Best pizza I have had in a long time! Service was great! Waiter was very attentive!! Thanks Anthony!
Sara E.,"Gatesville, TX",0,6,2,5.0,8/19/2016,"Juana was so sweet! She was very attentive and helpful to us. Even though we had a couple mishaps, she kept her cool and maintained a happy atmosphere. The management was really considerate and patient with us as well. We will definitely be back to see juana!  Thank you for making our experience enjoyable!"
Ryan E.,"Arlington, TX",51,188,61,3.0,9/22/2015,"I have came here a few times as my go to spot when I'm in town and for the most part this place is great the food is always delicious as well as the beer. The only problem I frequently encounter is the service when sitting at the bar. The employees are just very slow and rarely check in for refills or just to check in. If it weren't for the service, I would add another star."
Brian B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",373,1302,44,4.0,8/29/2015,"Typical BJ's: good food, bad service.  It was pretty empty when we showed up at 10pm on a Wednesday.  Bar started filling up a bit more by the time we left around 11 or 11:30pm."
