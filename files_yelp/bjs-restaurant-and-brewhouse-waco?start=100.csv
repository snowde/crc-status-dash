Jill S.,"Waco, TX",1,26,18,3.0,3/30/2014,"First time here I got a small deep dish pizza. Paid $10 and it was about the size of a teacup saucer. I never received my side salad, and it took entirely too long to receive my bill. Came back once more and got the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi- it was extremely tasty. However, I feel like the food and service is not worth the prices. Love the huge selection on the menu, but I just can't justify paying for it."
Ryan M.,"Hewitt, TX",0,14,,5.0,7/26/2012,Service is a little slow but give them a break they just opened!!! I go with my family foster trips to the mall for the appetizer sampler and the parmesan encrusted chicken served with broccoli and cream potatoes yum yum!!! The cream and black cherry sodas are always good and made in the building I also like how even with a wait you can usually get bar seating with the big TV split into 4 screens this would be a great place to take your homecoming date
Jeff T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,15,14,1.0,9/16/2012,"I have been to BJ's back at home in houston, tx. The deep dish pizzas were actual deep dish pizzas like the one on the photo on their home page.  well the deep dish pizzas we received at this BJ's looked like a take out pizza that came from pizza hut. It tasted like COLD oily cardboard with no sauce.  the waiter did not even offer the option of steak fries for fish and chips. Instead they decided to serve a classic English dish with skinny fries that were cold.  We asked for the manager and I addressed the issues about how the pizzas are not the same as the other BJ's I have been to. He told me ""this is how they are supposed to be made and they were always like this."" After I told him I just went to the BJ's at home 1 month ago, he tells me ""we changed that 1 month ago.""  What did not make sense to me was the manager told me that they cook their deep dish pizzas in the original deep dish containers, but they transfer the pizza to a plate because it ""keeps it warmer.""  I went onto the website for BJ's to find the corporate contact information, and the front page photo was a picture of a waiter holding a deep dish pizza by a clamp just as I described it to the manager.  My total dining time was 2 hours.  This place is not the same as other BJ's. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. THIS PLACE IS OVER PRICED CONSIDERING THEY ARE NOT UP TO PAR WITH OTHER BJ'S."
Michelle R.,"Waco, TX",0,11,,5.0,6/18/2012,"My husband and I went to BJ'S on Saturday after opening.  It was terribly crowded, but once we got in, the service was great.  Even though our food was late, our waiter took it upon himself to check on the food 2 times, obviously since they'd been open less than a week, there were the opening problems and having such large crowds.  So, we understand.  The tables were smaller than usual, so I guess they could fit more people in. Now, the food and drink.  I had the B.J.'s P.M. Porter, and it was the best dark beer I've ever had, smooth and rich, and went perfectly with my food.  My husband had the Nutty Brewnette which was good, but more bitter than I like in a dark beer. Spinach-stuffed mushrooms, they needed to bring out a smaller serving dish as it made the mushrooms look even smaller.  But they were delicious. I ordered the knife and fork sandwich,  ""Piranha, Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger.  The beef tasted of the highest grade, and my medium-well grill was perfect.  The chili was also very tasty.  I would order this again. My husband had the chicken fried steak, he said it was better than anything he's had in Waco, and I sampled the gravy, and although they didn't bring enough for a chicken fried steak, it was really good, and if it was a mix, they disguised it well, because it tasted homemade. All in all a good experience, more expensive than the usual places we visit, but worth it to save to go here.  I think the noise and the longer wait for food with get better with time.  I hope the food stays as good as it is!  So for now, 5 stars!"
Kendall G.,"Waco, TX",7,22,1,1.0,12/26/2013,"I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars. I rarely complain or go somewhere that I am just disgusted by, but this place was that kind of experience. At our table we ordered an appetizer sampler (which we never received, but were charged for until my husband corrected the server) a steak, a burger, chicken Alfredo and the cheeseburger pizza. Both the Alfredo and the steak were ice cold, as were the sides with the steak. My pizza was in edible. The sauce had the taste and consistency of ketchup. It took 30 mins for us to get our drinks, even though we were sitting in the bar and just ordered beers. Only our friends burger was even edible, and even it wasn't anything special. We will probably never go back to this location after our first disastrous visit. I've dined at others, including the ones in temple and round rock and they were great but combining poor, slow service with cold and unappetizing food and you have a recipe for restaurant failure."
V A.,"Waco, TX",0,41,,4.0,10/8/2014,I have always enjoyed my experiences here. My servers have been friendly and attentive. Managers showed genuine interest in keeping people happy. Beer selection is quite good. Food has always met or exceeded expectations. Love the salmon.
Daniel C.,"Scarsdale, NY",1,81,,4.0,6/27/2013,"Good spot. Great beer selection, but I loved their own hefeweisen. I went twice in  the same week for dinner. Bison burger was good, but the patty was a little small. Ahi tuna salad was really good."
T H.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,39,6,1.0,11/29/2013,Waiter was a chatty Kathy which was more noting than nice. The burger was a few steps above fast food. Burgers should be juicy and delicious. Not coming back here in my next trip to Waco.
Edna F.,"McGregor, TX",7,4,,4.0,7/18/2014,Recently ate dinner at BJ's.  My experience was really good. The food and service was great.  Will definitely go back!
David F.,"McGregor, TX",0,3,,5.0,7/18/2014,"Only my third time to eat at BJ's, but all were very positive dining experiences. The service, atmosphere, and food were all excellent. My wife agreed, and she's really hard to please when eating out. I'll be going back."
Michael C.,"Waco, TX",0,16,,4.0,1/13/2014,Me and my wife always go here but haven't lately since we cook ourselves more but this place always had good food but I can't comment in service as of late . But the craft beers are good!
Studl E.,"Saratoga, CA",0,62,,2.0,10/13/2012,"This place is way overpriced.  I got a salad, one beer, and chips and salsa (since I was still hungry) and it set me back almost $30.  This place is a rip off.  Plus they don't even brew the beer there.  Has to be shipped in from Houston per some stupid state law."
Peter Frank L.,"Rochester, NY",0,4,,2.0,1/9/2013,"Service slow, kitchen slower. 30 minutes for chicken wings?"
Julie B.,"Waco, TX",0,23,,5.0,2/15/2013,"I really like this place!  Great bar and good food.  On my last visit, I had something different for me, the Pot Roast Sandwich.  It was great and I'm having cravings for more.  The desserts were also good.  Service a bit slow but it was a busy night."
