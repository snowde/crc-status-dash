Melissa E.,"Terrell, TX",2,6,1,3.0,5/17/2016,"Service was so slow, we went on a Wednesday night couldn't see why service would be so slow,wait staff continued to apologize for such slow service. I know to Not go back on a school night since I had school aged kids with me."
Troy R.,"Waco, TX",71,1,10,3.0,6/26/2016,"Ordered the tomato basil soup with the blt salad.  Fast service. Friendly waitress. The salad was delivered prior to everyone's meal, I kindly asked that it be served when everyone's meal was served and with the soup. Waitress was happy to do so. Tomato basil soup was amazing. Regretted it was served NOT served with a cracker or roll of some kind. It was topped with 3 thumbnail size croutons. The BLT salad was a mess. Tiny diced bits of tomato and bacon (actually the bacon reminded me of packaged bacon bits, real bacon though way too small to enjoy.). The green was spinach leaves which still had their stems attached. It would have been much better to have had the stems removed. I would order the soup again but would not order the BLT salad again. Which is ashamed, because I like the combo. Just trim the stems of the spinach and chop and not dice the tomato and the bacon."
Li L.,"Chicago, IL",50,99,40,4.0,4/13/2015,I thought the food here was nicely presented and it had that special (not at home) food feeling. I came here with a friend and we had a good time. Pizookies were a neat concept!
Esteban R.,"Mexia, TX",1,7,,4.0,12/14/2015,"I am happy to relay that this location has increased tremendously since my first impression.  Bartenders are cool and synchronized with the kitchen staff. Lots of cool, new, delicious food options on the menu. Beer selection could be better."
Tracey S.,"Austin, TX",451,632,1248,3.0,4/26/2013,Pros: - lots of TVs - extensive menu with something for everyone - creative variety of pizzas - section of menu with under 575-calorie dishes - the Mediterranean pasta and vegetable dish was tasty - location off freeway - location not far from I-35 - outdoor patio Cons: - food and drinks took a little long to arrive I may not be qualified to review this restaurant because I'm not much of a beer drinker.  Beer drinkers would probably like this place.
Callee K.,"Woodway, TX",3,37,2,4.0,2/22/2016,"Sooooo many options.. Everything I've ever tried is delicious, service is friendly but it's always a little slow getting our food because it's always packed. Amazing drinks, fabulous desert! It is loud but I love the food"
Davis B.,"Denton, TX",0,3,3,5.0,8/26/2016,Wide selection of beers never disappoint.  Pizzas always on point and the pizokkies are awesome!
Tommy F.,"Waco, TX",0,6,,3.0,8/25/2016,"It definitely feels like a chain restaurant. The food is good enough, and the beers are very good. Service is prompt and pleasant. At the end of the day, it's not my kind of eatery- I'm more of a Salty Dog or Bubba's fella myself, but that doesn't mean it isn't someone else's. Judging by the crowd on Friday night, that's a given."
Waco B.,"Waco, TX",52,40,8,4.0,6/17/2016,"As a matter of habit, I avoid chains, but I'll make an exception for this BJ's. The waitstaff has always been attentive and accommodating of special/odd requests. The food is good but pricey. Items I highly recommend are the calamari, flatbread pizzas, Ahi tuna salad, Ahi poke, fried artichokes, burgers, tomato soup, and deep dish pizzas. I do not recommend the top shelf margaritas ($9 each and kinda skimpy on the booze) or the side that comes with the pitas (too bland)."
Christine J.,"Greer, SC",44,51,18,5.0,9/2/2015,I have no clue why this place received bad reviews. My husband & I came for lunch and sat at the bar. Our bartender Jordian was very attentive giving my husband various recommendations. They ran out of Dos Equis 3/4 of the pour and gave us that beer for free. The place had a very busy with a lunch rush too.
Poet C.,"Waco, TX",57,10,11,4.0,10/11/2014,This experience totally made up for the bad experience we had last time:) food was great and the service exceptional !
Cliff S.,"Copperas Cove, TX",43,45,68,4.0,10/17/2015,"My party of 8 was seated really quickly, and the service was very attentive, and our server was always looming around if we needed something, so that's all good. The kitchen didn't put out all of our food at the same time, came in three waves of distribution,  with the last plate arriving 10 mins after all the other meals... seemed to be forgotten.  The food was all good though."
Ryann O.,"Mentmore, NM",41,13,5,5.0,11/7/2015,First time in Waco & BJ's! My brother in law took me and hubby out for dinner. I had the North Beach Mahi mahi and Shirimp & Blood Orange Pom Sangria. The Mahi Mahi was delicious although when it first arrived it wasn't the best presentation. The Sangria was okay. Hubby had their salmon and BIL had one of their deep dish pizzas. They liked the food a lot! Our server was very friendly and prompt. I would love to go back sometime to try their beers.
Ashley G.,"Richmond, VA",211,373,1687,3.0,3/25/2014,"Don't go any night but busy nights.   Otherwise you'll get over cooked burgers, and warm (not hot) food. The last time we were in the food and service was terrible.  I was so disappointed and to top it off my family was in town and all I did before the visit was rave about how good this place is.  We got our appetizer, and after realizing something huge was missing off of the plate, we realized it was the chips for the dip.  Service just dropped the plate off and left, not explaining why were weren't given chips for our dip (that I also happened to RAVE about.) so instead when our server came we were left to ask about it, and he explained that they were out of chips.  Oh, ok. Well, can we have something ELSE to use the dip with? They wanted to charge us for bits of bread, then we settled on a few ""breadsticks"" they use for pasta for free.  seriously. We just blew 17$ on this appetizer and there are no chips, and the rest of the appetizer was luke warm...  Once I got my plate of food, my fries were cold, and my burger was also luke warm.  I asked for more fries for my plate but by the time they got there I was half way through my burger.  My parents plates and my husbands weren't much better, and we were left looking like chumps for saying this place was so great. The only time I've had great experiences here at the place was on a Saturday night, or a busy Sunday night.  The cook working the busy times is awesome.   When they're busy, they're worth the wait.  If there is no wait, there is probably a reason why.  Weak food, weak service."
Dori D.,"Austin, TX",11,83,50,2.0,4/25/2015,Horrible service and the food wasn't much better. Food came out wrong then came out cold.   Not much else to say because it was just that bad.  I've come to expect this from most of the restaurants in Waco.
A F.,"Marshall, MN",0,6,,2.0,4/29/2014,Poor service but only because they were extremely understaffed. Only one bartender on who was actually on top of his game. The manager came back behind the bar and washed a few glasses and then walked away. Not the servers fault they were short staffed I'm blaming lazy management on this one. Food was good but expensive even though it was happy hour.
Steven S.,"Chula Vista, CA",44,172,177,3.0,12/16/2012,"What a night! The food and the brews (especially the Jeremiah Red) were great! However, the waitress spilled a small container of salsa on the ground and some landed on my leather boots.  I did not notice until when we got home!  If she would have said something early I could have wiped the chunky tomatoes and acidic juices off my boots right away.  This is a 5-star place but the negative experience dropped it to a 3."
Elizabeth S.,"Waco, TX",186,3,,1.0,9/14/2015,"BJs generally doesn't have the greatest service, but this one was a total joke. Our waitress never bothered to refill our drinks and both our entrees and desserts we're cold and had obviously been sitting for a while (ice cream on pizzookie was melted). It was my friends birthday and we expected at least some sort of special treatment and ended up getting the exact opposite. Long story short, it's totally not worth it."
Kris R.,"Hewitt, TX",0,91,14,4.0,11/16/2015,We have only eaten at the bar and always had great service and EXCELLENT food!! We think it is a bit pricey but have happily enjoyed each visit. I must thank my neighbors kids who work there for the recommendation. Love the selection of beer and the house root beer is a must try.
Jennifer T.,"Fayetteville, AR",1,2,2,1.0,1/19/2014,"BJ's is what it is, a chain restaurant where you can expect to have the same experience from one location to the next. One of the only exceptions of course is customer service. We visited tonight, a Sunday evening, around 8:30-8:45ish. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us, understandable to a degree with two large tables of college students still being waited on right next to us. However, our waitress Ashley was unapologetic about her slowness to greet us or get our drink order. We told her we were actually ready to order everything, aware that we might not have another opportunity to do so for a while later and to make things easier on her since she was obviously having a rough night. Long story short, she continued to be flippant and cold towards us the rest of the evening with intermittent moments of kindness for instance after we had to seek out silverware and later when the bill arrived of course. In summary, I'm only writing this review to make the management aware of this behavior of a staff member. I would not want anyone with this type of personality representing my business especially in a customer service capacity."
