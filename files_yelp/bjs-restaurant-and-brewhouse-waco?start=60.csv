Brian L.,"Oak Harbor, WA",1,59,11,2.0,6/9/2015,"Average food, good but nothing spectator. The service was so slow! It was ridiculous how long we had to wait for drinks, and the check. Good thing none of us were in a hurry. 20 minutes to get the check."
Andrea L.,"Waco, TX",91,37,7,5.0,7/29/2015,"Pizza is always great, have been a few times and ever time it's great. Deserts are good. Mix drink was great last time I went. Service is always good. Will be back ."
John J.,"Santa Cruz, CA",29,104,3,3.0,11/1/2015,"The food is usually ok and the wait is average. More times than not, service is slow or the server is not personable until the check is brought out. Pizza and beer is the high point as is the Calamari. Stay clear of the salads, you may be disappointed. Desserts are pretty great. Nice place to take family if you want to stay awhile and talk (server may get lost). Have an ordering plan in advance or you may be waiting a while to find the server again. Might be a training issue at this location, BJs in other cities usually has outstanding service."
Jen H.,"Austin, TX",125,177,52,2.0,11/30/2013,"I ordered a chicken sandwich and my lunch partners ordered burgers.  Blah.  The chicken sandwich was dry and oily all at the same time.  Their burgers were thin like McDonalds, overly salty, and greasy in a bad way.  It also took our food 45 minutes to come out.   The beer was also not cold and overpriced.   There's not many places to eat in Waco and this was not a good addition."
Sean R.,"Waco, TX",0,3,1,1.0,8/2/2015,"The experience was layers of bad. My friends ordered frozen margaritas and they tasted off from the very start. When asked the waitress said they don't have a frozen machine so they have to kind of make them, well it didn't work. For $12 you would expect more. They brought replacements of margaritas on the rocks, but didn't check on ours drinks again until the end of the meal over an hour later. It took almost an hour to get our food and the place wasn't even half full. They didn't even serve our food at the same time, I had the privilege of watching my friends eat for 10 mins before I was served. The shame of it is that I ordered the easiest and quickest of the tables order.  I will probably never choose this as my place invite friends too eat again."
Clare S.,"Temple, TX",31,38,12,2.0,6/12/2013,"Welp Yelp, BJ's in Waco has gone downhill. Now that the stater-up servers are gone and the permanent waiters are here, service is really bad. I've been there about five times in the past year and I have yet to have great service. I've had good service but they always seem to be in a rush, half zoned-out, and slow on refills. The food is also getting bad. I ordered a Cesar salad with grilled chicken and the chicken was burned to a crisp. It took so long to get it that I didn't bother correcting it. Another day, I ordered the chicken parmigiana. The marinara sauce was so spicy that I had to stop eating and give the rest to my boyfriend. I am VERY sensitive to spice and did not expect that with an Italian dish. I've watched the movie Waiting too many times to complain about food and, once again, I was Starvin' Marvin when I received my food. (Yes, I'm a wimp).  Overall, this place is no longer worth the price tag. It's probably great for watching a big game on TV and having a few beers at the bar. If you want to sit down and enjoy a meal, go somewhere else."
Bill K.,"Belton, TX",12,293,14,2.0,3/17/2015,"We had a large party of 15. Our reserved table was ready when we got there.  We had only one waiter. Nice guy, but he could not handle 15 people. The Santa Fe salads should have had avocado corn and cheese and Did not. Many of our orders were incorrect. 6 of us ordered the beignet for desert and they were totally out. Very disappointing for a Saturday afternoon."
N G.,"Plano, TX",0,44,5,2.0,4/6/2016,"Service Needs Work. BJ's is a normal place to go with safe, reliable, and tasty food. I have been to this chain a ton of times in other cities, but this was my first bad experience...in Waco of all places. The food we ordered had errors, the waits were unreasonable, the waitress was always in a rush and normally made routes around the tables she waited so that none of us could get her attention. In addition, they completely forgot about a side order that we ordered, and then it took us a while to get it off of our bill. All in all, I am hoping that we just caught them on a bad day, but with other options in Waco for dinner places, I am not sure if I will find out. I will still continue to go to other BJ's though."
Zane C.,"Waco, TX",0,6,,2.0,5/6/2015,"Huge menu of almost nothing but beer, burgers, and pizza. The pizza is good but not for the price. Service is slow. I'm somewhat biased here but I didn't even enjoy a FREE meal from this joint."
Todd G.,"Waco, TX",0,23,,1.0,9/21/2015,BJ's management... Please train your staff on customer service. Your food is above average but slowness of the waitstaff along with waiters that are less than friendly means you have a big problem. The only way I will go back is to get something to go.
Joseph J.,"Woodway, TX",1,21,,5.0,3/1/2016,"probably one of the best restaurants in waco. the service is always pretty good. the food is pretty good. the place is clean and looks great. wide variety of choices from appetizers, entrees, drinks, and desserts. really a high quality restaurant chain."
John P.,"Austin, TX",56,25,2,4.0,7/25/2014,"Crowded, somewhat noisy, and slow. So why four stars? BJs, despite its faults, manages to cater to everyone in an indecisive group. The grad student wanting to fortify on beer, the girlfriend watching her figure, the couple that want to share a pizza, the guy post A on a midterm celebrating with a steak, and the birthday girl hungry for dessert will all find something to their liking, even if that something isn't as good as the speciality restaurant they might have ordered from elsewhere. Fairly pricey food and drinks, but certainly not forbiddingly so. A good place for a night out with a group of friends, but not worth venturing out alone for."
John H.,"Corsicana, TX",3,33,28,5.0,4/5/2015,"clean,, cold great brews,, good food,, best place to eat in Waco, TX"
David L.,"Waco, TX",2,10,,1.0,9/16/2012,"I don't usually rate restaurants this low, but my experience at this particular BJ's in Waco, Texas was not even remotely pleasant. I went to BJ's on September 16, 2012 with a group of friends. My friend recommended it based upon his experiences with another BJ's in Sugarland, Texas. He said that they were well known for their pizza, so we decided to order some pizzas, three in fact. After receiving our pizzas, however, we were not impressed in any way. Not only was the pizza not ""deep-dish"" as the menu proclaimed, but its quality looked very average, on par with Pizza Hut. Normally, I wouldn't complain too much, but the pizza cost $20. I could get the same pizza for $10 at Pizza Hut. There were mistakes in the cooking of the pizza, there were parts of the pizza, like the onions, that were still raw. However, our group recognized that mistakes do happen. We decided to just inform the waitress instead, just to express our concern. The service, however, was not great at all. Even though the restaurant has only been open for a month or two, it should be well established by now, but the manager kept giving us odd excuses for the conditions of our pizzas. He stated that they no longer serve their pizzas in a pan, but instead serve them on a dish because it ""keeps the pizza warmer for longer"", which makes little sense to me. Not only that, he stated later on that the pizzas we received were indeed deep dish. I'm from Chicago, and I know that that was not a deep dish pizza. The tomato sauce was not on the top, and the pizza was by no means thick enough. The manager seemed to give us excuses and lies, which I don't understand. He did not seem to like our constructive criticism, but instead seemed to become defensive. In the end, they gave us a discount on the meal, which I respect, but with that bad combination of service and quality. I don't think I'll be coming back. This is not to say the franchise is bad, but this particular chain, I would avoid."
KG P.,"Waco, TX",0,3,,1.0,8/17/2015,"We had a party of group of 11 at BJ's to celebrate a birthday. It was my nephews 21st birthday, and since he enjoys BJ's pizza, this was his choice. Instead of a celebration it turned into a calamity. It all started at the bar. 730 on a Sunday evening the only people waiting at the bar were the 6 men in our group. The bartender Dean, ignored the group staying at the far end of the bar, with his back turned, pretending he did not see us. However upon entering we made eye contact with Dean, however Dean disregarded the group, turned his back, walking away from our group. We are not a group of undesirable customers; we own small business, one is a fireman, civil engineer, and one is a banker.  Not wanting to be bothered with his customers, Dean rushed pass the group, and disappeared in the back area of the restaurant.  After 5 minutes, yea we timed him, he rushed back in behind the bar, ran to the far end of the bar, and spit tobacco juice into a cup. At that point with noticeable regret, surly body language, and lack of concern, he made his way down to our group. I asked him his name, he asked ""why you want my name"", I said because we want to make sure we know who to pay. Dean then informed us he would be right back, and again disappeared into the kitchen. This time he reappeared only a few seconds later, and reluctantly, and unpleasantly took our drink orders, which were just some craft beers. At that point a manger appeared, I asked her what Dean's problem was and she said I will have a talk with him later. She was aware and acknowledged Dean's attitude. She should have sent him home. Maybe she didn't have a replacement, however I would suspect managers could pour beer and make a few cocktails.  Dean should not be serving customers. If he wants to be this hipster bartender servicing craft cocktails, with an attitude, he needs to find another place to work. The attitude does not work in a family casual restaurant. He needs to be terminated.  So we make it to our table and our adventure continues. Megan our server was nice enough, and pleasant, however she struggled with the orders. Half the tables food came out before any one received their appetizers, (we canceled the appetizers) carried by servers, just looking to dump the orders on the table, asking who ordered this and who ordered that, no clue, no direction, clumsily looking at greased stained order tickets, not even knowing what they were carrying. No management, no direction, no training.  So half the group sat around for 15 minutes +/- waiting for their others (including the person celebrating his birthday), while the others in the group sat politely waiting to eat their food only when the other orders appeared. 15 minutes later the other food arrived, and guess what a few of the orders were incorrect. We asked Megan if they were short staffed or overwhelmed with business (there might have been 50 people in the restaurant), she answered no to both questions. We asked about Dean the angry bartender, who hates his job, hates the customers, and seems bothered about serving customers. She said he's like that with everyone, that his girlfriend is a manager here. Now we know why his behavior is allowed.  What a great night at BJ's. At this point the manager, came out apologized, and handed everyone in our group ""courtesy cards"". Wouldn't it be nice, not to have to hand out ""courtesy cards"", just make the dining experience as pleasant as possible up front. Start by terminating Dean. Find a kitchen manager to manage the kitchen effectively, find employees who care about their tips and serving customers correctly. Just remember we live in Waco, and look what happened at Twin Peaks, and the investment dollars lost, and the reputation of a restaurant chain forever stained.     We have eating a tBJ's around the county for a number of years.  We live in Waco, and have pride in our community. I have clients who come to town and spend up to a week in Waco. They ask for restaurant recommendations the company always recommends BJ's. We have considered BJ's for our office catering. Unfortunately due to Dean, and the unpleasant experience on a slow Sunday night, we have to reconsider our opinion of BJ's.  My hope is someone at BJ's with direction, authority, and appreciation for the customer reads this and take action. Again Dean is a liability, he will not make the site money, and Dean will cause customers to stay away."
Tony B.,"Belton, TX",51,19,14,5.0,6/19/2012,"With any brand new opening of a big chain like this there are bound to be hiccups. I was pleasantly surprised at the complete and total lack of these hiccups on my first visit to the newly constructed BJ's in Waco. There was about a 10 minute wait around 1pm which isn't a huge deal. We had apparently just missed the huge lunch rush. From the moment I walked in the door every single hostess, waiter/waitress, buster, and bartender put off a vibe that they wanted to be there and wanted to make sure I left happy. Dominique (hopefully that's spelled correctly!) did an outstanding job as our waitress. She used the perfect balance of making sure our glasses never went less than half full, but not checking on us to the point of being annoying.  We got the avocado egg-rolls as an appetizer. I'm sure you hear people say this about many of the menu items here, but as crazy as it sounds it's actually quite delicious! Dipping them in the provided sauce is a must. I also got the Chicken Tortilla Soup which they actually bring out in two separate containers. The plate has a small pile of shredded tortilla chips, avocado, a lime wedge, and some seasonings. They then pour the soup over the small pile so when you eat it the tortilla chips are still slightly crunchy. It had an awesome slightly spicy flavor. I also had the light chicken tacos which were also quite tasty. Their signature desert is essentially a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice-cream on top which was delicious as well. Wow... after re-reading this I sound like a huge fatty! The wait time for the food was surprisingly short given the large volume of people in the restaurant. I also take every chance I get to try new beers, and got the Hopstorm. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did the Porter I tried at my last visit to BJ's in Temple, but I'm not really much of an IPA guy. They have over a dozen (i think?) of their own brews. If you want to try a bunch of them you can build a sampler which I highly recommend. I'm glad to see some fresh competition for all the other big chains in Waco. I have no doubt this place will give them a run for their money. Definitely plan on making myself a regular here."
Edie J.,"Waco, TX",1,29,,5.0,6/23/2012,"I went here for the first time today and I was very happy with my experience. The wait time was shorter than estimated and the waitress was very friendly. The food was amazing. It was filling without making me feel weighed down. Even with a dessert. the pizza was actually loaded with lots of the toppings. Normally you'd think you'd find a few here and there and have it mostly be cheese. Not here. There was so many toppings that they were falling off the plate and I was eating them with my fork.  The only downside was that the hostess who showed us to our table was a tad creepyish. She walked really slow and was a bit robotic.  Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely plan on going back. Maybe once it slows down a little. The line never seemed to stop coming in the door."
A. Tyson S.,"Schertz, TX",12,12,4,4.0,11/4/2014,"Great food, better beer, best service. The peppermint pizookie made just for the holidays is the bomb."
Margo M.,"McGregor, TX",66,59,24,5.0,7/26/2012,"Excellent food, hand crafted brew, great service.  One of my Frequent stops!"
Kayla W.,"Williamsburg, NY",19,22,5,4.0,8/6/2014,"Good happy hour specials.... Great beer selection. Avocado egg rolls are a must! They accommodate a large group really well too. I eat here pretty regularly bc the lighting, vibe, and usually great food/service. I hate super bright restaurants. I've been to a couple other locations, they were good as well.... But I prefer this Waco location."
