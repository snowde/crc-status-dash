Daniel T.,"Hewitt, TX",165,13,32,5.0,9/4/2012,"Bj's! I love me some Bj's! Oh...ok..that didn't come out right, didn't it?  The latest addition of popular restaurant chain to come to Waco. Being from the Dallas FT Worth area, I'm no stranger to this chain of restaurant.  Like any other location, they keep it very open space. The food here is great, especially during lunch time. You can easily get a full stomach for under 13 bucks, and that's including tips! (during lunch time that is) Prices are moderately high on regularly price items, but the portion are more than enough. Most people end up leaving with to go boxes.  My favorite menu item would be their Thai Chicken Wontons. They offer it here at this location, but not to the one in Arlington, Texas. Atleast they are marketing different items to different locations. Oh and their rewards for eating there is not too bad either."
Lisa G.,"Houston, TX",1,17,4,3.0,8/7/2014,Standard bar fare. Went jn late on a Friday night with a table of 25. Service was excellent.
Melissa H.,"Taylor, TX",0,9,,5.0,10/22/2015,"We ate at Bj's in Waco tonight and seriously had THE BEST waitress and service that we've had in a very long time!  The manager was great and if you eat there, you absolutely must ask for Dominique!  She is attentive, provides excellent service, and makes you feel like family.  When we go back, we'll absolutely wait for a seat in her section.  Tip her well friends....she earns it!"
Claudia L.,"Waco, TX",0,14,1,2.0,8/4/2014,"SERVICE SAVES FOOD Most all the food lacks freshness. And for the second time in a row our soups were cold...However, service is always very friendly and efficient. I enjoyed the big screens and comfy booths"
Jasmin S.,"Poplar Bluff, MO",97,18,20,4.0,6/14/2014,Mozzarella and tomato salad & Brewhouse Blonde! Highly recommended. Pizza is excellent... get the deep dish. Have had excellent service and not so great service.
Heather K.,"Robinson, TX",59,14,3,5.0,6/23/2014,"Me and my husband are frequent visitors to BJ's and I have to say most of the time it's been great! I have had only one bad experience at BJ's but it doesn't change my opinion about them. The food was great, we ordered Chicken Fried Steak and a Bacon cheese burger. The waiter, Edward was very prompt and friendly.  We work late hours, so it's nice having a place thy stays open late. We will be back!"
Amy B.,"Austin, TX",45,2,,1.0,6/19/2015,"This was a horrible experience. The waitress was more interested in the family behind us. The first glass that I was served  broke as I picked it up.  They quickly cleaned it up, and a manager told us that is was not our fault and that they did not mind cleaning up after the spill ????? We waited for about 15 minutes to get another drink ordered, and another 10 to order our food. We then spent the next 40 minutes waiting on our food that we ordered. (Mind you still soaking wet with the drink that had spilled on me.) The waitress never checked on us, until we were ready to just go. Then told us that the food we ordered takes 20 minutes to cook, which is fine but we had ordered it 40 minutes prior. I told her we were pretty much ready to leave money on the table and walk out, she walked away and said she was sorry while looking the other way.  Then promptly walked back to continue to converse with the table behind us. I then told my husband it was time to go. We left an adequate amount of money on the table and told her we were just going to go. She then said oh sorry dear. I thought that this was a bit lacking in guest service. I understand if you are busy it taking a while, however in my past experience as a waitress I would have engaged with my table more than once to ensure there was not anything else they needed, especially if I had been right there talking to a table behind them. I can not believe how disappointing the service was at this location. I would have given it a 0 star but it was not an option."
Jennifer K.,"Hewitt, TX",2,17,3,2.0,8/7/2014,"Food is overpriced and mediocre at best. Drinks and beer are very good. Service is hit or miss; sometimes good, but usually poor; very slow and inattentive. The female wait staff is much better then their male counterparts. For the money you spend the service really needs to improve. My suggestion is to get drinks at the bar and go someplace else for food."
Christopher B.,"Stafford, TX",36,97,5,3.0,3/3/2014,"Over the past year I have gone here about 4 times. The last two times since about July, I have had a fairly average time. The service is where this place lacks. Waiter does not stop by often to offer refills. The food can be overcooked (pasta). Like another review has stated the price no longer seems worth what you receive in return."
Mark S.,"Woodway, TX",0,30,2,3.0,7/22/2013,"I have always enjoyed eating at BJs.  Went this past weekend and as usual the food was very good.  I asked the waiter to let us enjoy our drinks and appetizer but he kept coming over pushing us to order.  We were there early, no crowd at all and he kept pushing us to order.  Went in with plans to have a leisurely meal but ended up like going through a drive through.  Entre arrived before we had finished our small appetizer.  I will go back because I like the food and beer but I won't allow them to rush me again."
Vanessa M.,"Waco, TX",9,122,1,5.0,8/16/2013,I love this place.  The black and bleu flatbread is amazing.  They have a lot of good choices.  The service is good too.
Dolly D.,"Waco, TX",0,6,6,3.0,10/7/2012,Avocado egg roll was great...dipping sauce put it over the top!  Amanda made our visit very pleasant.  The horseradish sauce for the roast beef dip was exceptional.   However it was a very pricey.  $2.75 for sweet tea!
Zachary C.,"Georgetown, TX",110,141,4,4.0,10/7/2013,Huge menu.  There's something for everyone and the food quality is good.  Very cool place to be.  Liquor display is very appealing and house brews are awesome.
Sarah F.,"Washington, DC",0,15,,2.0,6/17/2012,"The restaurant has only been open for about a week, and we went on Fathers' Day, so it was very busy. The service was terrible. We were seated and got our drink orders in a timely fashion, and we ordered our food not too long after we had gotten there.  However, we then had to wait for almost an hour for our food to arrive (there were six of us). When it arrived, two of the orders had something wrong (wrong side, incorrectly cooked) and one was missing. Two more were, while not cold, not hot either. We then had to wait another ten minutes for the missing order to arrive, and it arrived only after we had spoken to a manager about that and the incorrectly-cooked steak.  The food was quite good, if a little cold, and I expect that many of these issues will be resolved as the restaurant ages. I will say that the manager was very helpful once we spoke to him and he discounted our check to compensate for our trouble."
April C.,"Elm Mott, TX",0,4,2,1.0,7/15/2012,"Went here early on a Saturday before it got busy. We were seated right away but waited forever just to get our drinks. While waiting for our food, we witnessed 2 tables ask for the manager because of not getting their order or repeatedly getting the wrong order. We ordered pizza and the waitress gave us dirty plates and the ""fresh from the oven"" pizza was cold. Needless to say, I will gladly spend my $60 elsewhere."
David L.,"Waco, TX",223,869,119,4.0,4/16/2013,"The 'neighborhood' bar & grill concept has entered a new era, catering to those who tire of burger-based menus, tacky things on walls, and mass-produced beers. They still want a place to watch the game, but they want to feel grown up doing it. Restaurants like BJ's, Gordon Biersch, and Dogfish Head are seeking to fill this glorified sports bar niche. BJ's brings together Americans' newfound taste for microbrews and their enduring appetite for Chicago-style deep dish pizza in what amounts to a franchised gastropub. Of course, there's a full menu to accommodate everyone's tastes, but beer and pizza serve as the backbone. The aesthetic is reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory-style opulence, featuring dark woods, high ceilings, and a large bar with backlit liquor bottles. Kitschy memorabilia are here forgone in favor of a large corporate mural of nondescript yeoman farmers growing wheat and making beer. The bar has a massive four-picture television, and smaller screens are tastefully interspersed throughout the rest of the restaurant. We enjoyed the starter Caesar (creamy with a slight zip), the spicy sausage deep dish (the heat builds nicely), and their 'Pizookie,' which is a rather hokey name for a miniature hot cookie pie topped with ice cream. We used a Google Offer, but I'm a little annoyed that they didn't suggest the 'Party for Two' special, featured on their website, which would have come out even better."
Tony N.,"Waco, TX",10,10,,5.0,8/18/2013,Great and fast service! Appetizers are great! Recommend trying the avocado rolls. There are so many entrees that I'm not sure where to begin. I like the pork chop and Mediterranean pizza! The pazookie is great and one of my favorite desserts!
Beverly B.,"Waco, TX",0,7,2,1.0,12/27/2014,Hostess sat us at dirty table. We had to ask for it to be cleaned. Ordered appetizer. Asked for plates to eat it with when it came out. The plates were dirty with someone else's food all over the bottom of two of them.  Waiter rolled his eyes at us for asking for clean plates. Did not apologize or try to make experience better. My food came out wrong. Asked for no onions meal had onions on it. My husbands food also came out wrong  he ordered salmon got chicken  our friend ordered steak medium. It came out well done. All in all terrible experience. To make it worse our waiter did not care or even try to make anything better. In fact he made experience worse by terrible attitude.
Steve S.,"Albuquerque, NM",38,147,35,3.0,7/14/2012,"Quoted a 10 min wait, Waited 30 mins to be sat.  Waited at least that long for food once sat. Food was good but seemed like I had more fish on the salad at bj's in college station. Nice to have all those beer selections."
A K.,"Waco, TX",0,1,,1.0,8/27/2012,"We have frequently eaten at the BJs in Temple and have always had a very good quality meal. I wish I could say the same for Waco. This is our second time here and both experiences have not been good. This time my husband's pizza order was messed up not once, but twice. He never ended up getting what he ordered and then they actually charged him for it. Don't expect a good meal experience at the Waco location"
