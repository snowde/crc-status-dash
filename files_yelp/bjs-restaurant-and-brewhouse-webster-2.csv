John D.,"La Marque, TX",59,176,288,4.0,1/5/2018,"Excuse my use of slang, but it was a minute between tonight and the last time I hit up BJ's. The last time I paid a visit was give or take three years ago. I came here earlier with my nephew, who'll return to college in San Antonio in a few days. We were fortunate to have Vanessa as our waitress; she sat us in front of a TV that was showing NFL Network. In my book, it's a plus to watch some tube -- especially sports -- while eating and drinking. We began with the Best Beginnings appetizer sampler consisting of boneless buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks, and avocado egg rolls. The item was big enough to feed two people. We were close to stuffed by the time our main meals arrived. I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It was accompanied by an ample serving of fries. Not like it matters, but for some reason, I forgot to douse the fries with ketchup. Good thing they were tasty without the Heinz. I really enjoyed the sandwich. Simply put, it can best be described as a sizable piece of fried chicken nicely coated with a variety of seasoning and spices in between a bun. The pickles gave the fowl a solid sour kick. I managed to finish it despite being full from the appetizers. As for the rating, BJ's actually scores a 4.5. The restroom could be maintained better."
Scott B.,"Houston, TX",2,7,,4.0,1/5/2018,"I arrived at 530 pm on a Friday hoping to catch happy hour prices and get ahead of the dinner rush.  Easily found a seat at a high top table in the bar area. The atmosphere is fine (granite tabletops, brick walls, high ceilings), music is not too loud, and there are 6 TVs behind the bar tuned to all the usual sports channels. Noise level is high enough already that I can imagine it might be a bit much at peak times. Decided to order 2 selections from the Happy Hour menu: Dark Horse Cabernet, $5, normal price $7.75 Avocado Egg Rolls, $6, normal price $10.95 Wine is unexceptional but perfectly fine for the  price.  There are 6 egg rolls on the plate, enough for 2 people. They are deep fried and hot with a very sweet dipping sauce. Calories are super-high so watch out. But avocados are  healthy fats, right? Overall I am going to rate this place pretty high. Why? Because it is better than just about  any other comparable place. I have been here many times and have been going out to eat in Houston since the 80s, so I have pretty much tried them all. The menu is huge (24 pages!) and has calorie counts for everything so anyone should be able to find something they like. Prices are reasonable.  Higher than Chili's and lower than       PF Changs. The usual downside of going to BJs is that it is very popular at peak times and staff has a hard time keeping up. Bottom line I give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is clearly better than Fridays, Chili's, Marie Callendar (are they still around?), BWW, Hooters and it's imitators. Maybe on par with Brickhouse and a step below Houston's (told you I have been to them all). Now I am am going to dig into a seared Ahi salad ($15.50, big enough for two), relax, and contemplate my new hobby as a restaurant critic on Yelp."
BigFishLittleFish F.,"Dallas, TX",0,60,13,5.0,12/16/2017,"We just visited BJ's Thursday and had a call ahead for 18. Oh, and in ten minutes at lunchtime. Not an easy task to pull off any day, any time. But they did it with flying colors. I want to single out our server, Brian. Brian took on our very 'challenging' family and sailed through the lunch like a real pro. There wasn't a hiccup the entire visit and the family were all very pleased with their food and especially the service by Brian. Large parties are extremely difficult but he handled it like it was a table for 2. Brian, this is a real talent and to do so very naturally and with ease that allows the diner to relax and enjoy their experience. This is true hospitality.  Thank you to Brian and the staff at BJ's Webster"
Laura A.,"Pasadena, TX",255,540,14,5.0,12/5/2017,"I love the atmosphere here, all dark wood and leather, it's upscale but cozy too.  Great beer and wine selection.  All their food is great from pizza and burgers to spaghetti and meatballs.  Love their chocolate chocolate pizookie with chocolate ice cream!"
Doug M.,"League City, TX",297,401,415,3.0,8/20/2017,"We haven't been here in a couple of years so we went again.  It is only fair that I give you an updated review.  Last time, I have them three stars.  This time, I give them three stars.  I guess BJ's will never become one of our favorites. My wife, son, and I came in early Friday evening.  We wanted to beat the rush to get to a movie.  We arrived around 6:00 PM and beat the rush.  Literally 10 minutes later, there was a wait.  We were quickly seated and the service was spot on.  Drinks were ordered and brought to us.  Speaking of drinks, they have really good lemonade.  I ordered the Root Beer Wings as an appetizer.  My wife ordered a pizza so she and I could split it.  My son ordered one of the burgers with no onions and no mayo.  Yes, we realize this wasn't our healthiest meal of the week.  Our server specifically asked if we wanted the appetizer before the meal or with the rest of the food.  I asked if them to bring it before the meal.   We didn't wait too long for the food.  However, my son received his burger with onions and mayo.  The manager was one of the people that helped deliver our food.  She noticed the onions and said, ""Oh, I see this has onions on it.  Is that OK?""  He said it was ok simply because it wasn't smothered in them and we were going to a movie so he would just take them off.  When he took the top bun off, he also noticed the burger had mayo.  He ended up sending it back and waiting for another one.  Magically, it was prepared correctly in about 2 minutes (literally).  Our server stated it was already ready but the person serving the food (remember the manager?) had grabbed the wrong burger.  He apologized.  The pizza was on a thin crust and tasted pretty good.  A thin crust pizza at BJ's is really thin but that is the way we like it so it was fine.  My wife ended up taking some of it home to eat as lunch the next day.  If you notice, I did not mention the wings yet.  That is because I did not get them yet.  I was supposed to get them before the meal.  It was an appetizer.  We got them after the rest of the food.  I've never had their Root Beer Wings so I didn't really know what to expect.  The sauce is the same texture as a BBQ sauce.  Simply, it is a BBQ sauce with a root beer flavor.  I liked it ok but won't rush back to order it again.  We ended up eating a free dessert because of all of the mix-ups. Bottom Line:  Food is average and the staff needs to pay better attention to their orders upon delivery to the table.  It may be a couple more years before I go back again.  Bon appétit."
Austin N.,"Honolulu, HI",363,205,258,3.0,2/14/2017,"Overall impression: This place is really popular. Good standard American food, nice atmosphere. Nothing stood out for me. Average price: $18-25/dinner Positives: -pizza is good -pizzokie if you like that -high turnover of food -nice enough atmosphere -they have happy hour -generally pretty clean Negatives: -service was just average -it gets really crowded here (which could be a good or bad thing, just make sure to time your visit right) -nothing incredible about the food I have no huge complaints about this place. It's fine. Lots of seating both indoors and outdoors. Food is average. Service is average. Price is about what you would expect, although maybe on the slightly high side for what you get, but nothing outrageous. Lots of TVs around the bar area and outdoors. Nice place for the family or a cool place to hang out for happy hour. I would give it a 3 to 3.5"
Debbie M.,"Houston, TX",5,119,18,5.0,7/24/2017,"My husband loves this place! lol The beer, ribs, pizza and burgers are his favorites. Try the new chicken fried burger - it's delicious. I like the home made root beers and salads."
Richard H.,"League City, TX",0,8,,5.0,12/27/2017,"Always great food.  So many items, it's hard to choose sometimes.  Pizzas are great, both deep dish (BJ's favorite is my favorite) and the thin crispy tavern-style (Italian Market is great). The club sandwiches are also great.  Service is  usually great once you get to a table.  But be prepared for a wait to get a table.  The place is crowded."
Monae I.,"Houston, TX",124,77,611,4.0,2/18/2017,"I love BJ's it has its ups & downs when it comes to the food, but the drinks are great! It may be awhile before I go back to this location because we were giving dirty plates (2 dirty plates, not 1). Besides that things were not to bad."
Mia W.,"Webster, TX",2,172,222,3.0,7/8/2017,"This location can be a hit or a miss. Food is either great or Terrible, same with the service. Their drinks were not too great either recently.. I like that they have a gluten free menu, wish they would expand upon that more too. GF pizookies are awesome!"
Luke V.,"Houston, TX",5,12,11,4.0,8/12/2017,"Been to this location multiple times. The food here is good, and there is a variety to choose from also. Came here during the afternoon for a quick lunch. This time I ordered the lunch special, half-size flatbread pizza with baby field greens topped with shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers and tomatoes. Tossed in balsamic vinaigrette."
A G.,"League City, TX",0,17,35,5.0,10/29/2017,"This place never disappoints. I love their appetizers, pizzas, entrés, and love the pizookies!!! My husband also loves their beer selection. Wait time to get seated can take a little while on weekends but that's any good spot."
Darleen S.,"League City, TX",5,72,268,3.0,5/10/2017,"The family and I came here recently. It's been a few years since we've been here. The food is as always ""just ok"". Nothing special about it. The ribeye steak had a great flavor but, was all fat and gristl, couldn't even eat  1/2 of it. Parmesan crusted chicken was good as was the New Orleans Jamalaya. Spinach artichoke dip not that good. The jalapeño cucumber margarita was deliciou!!"
David R.,"Palestine, TX",14,229,878,4.0,4/27/2016,"The Parmesan Crusted Chicken with vegetables and a salad = GREAT ! Our party also had the spring rolls for an appetizer and they were good too. We ate early (5:30), and there were only two other parties eating .  Great service"
MJ N.,"New Orleans, LA",85,2,2,3.0,3/24/2017,I usually love going here for to-go. Today I got a to-go and it did not come out like I expected. I got the salmon pits taco and there was very very little in the taco. I probably won't be getting it anymore. The to-go staff was very nice though.
Nicolette M.,"Webster, TX",199,23,,3.0,10/3/2017,"There's a lot of convenience that comes with this place. You can order it online and pick it up or dine in. I've done both. Service is friendly enough and the food is consistent each time. Once I've ordered a hamburger where the seasoning was so over done that it was actually crunchy. I nearly felt sick and couldn't finish the food. Other times the food has been fine. It's a hit or miss kind of place so I'll go there if I have to. It's not something I crave, though."
Benny Jas. B.,"Friendswood, TX",15,16,,3.0,9/17/2017,"Here's a wonderfully designed and tastefully themed sports-bar-style facility - appears to be well kept, but also a little empty.  The menu includes a great helping of American fare (burgers & fries, etc.), with a sizable section for great pizzas, and an oversized/full bar!  The pricing scenario seems a bit higher than other restaurants of this type - almost 15% to 30% more than you might expect to pay, but the food is good, and if you've got that kind of money you would like to hang out there with drinking buddies, watching sports and galavanting.  Probably, this price gouge is the reason the place seems so empty.  But, when you got the cash you can practically have this place all to your semi-private party."
Tiffany J.,"Pearland, TX",131,278,118,4.0,8/6/2016,"It's been about a year since I've eaten at BJ's. They have made some changes to their menu but they still have a great variety of  food and beverage options. We didn't order any appetizers but the honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts and the Brewhouse Blonde Asparagus caught my eye. They added a bunch of cocktails to the menu. My friend and I both had the Hendricks Cucumber Lemonade. It was so good and refreshing!  For dinner I had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which was really delicious! It came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The side dishes were awesome, but unfortunately they only put four broccoli florets on the plate. I thought maybe there were more hiding under the chicken or mashed potatoes, but there weren't. That was disappointing because it was really good. Of course the portion of chicken and mashed potatoes were massive, especially compared to the broccoli. I of course had to have a Pizookie for dessert. They added a few new flavors, but I opted for chocolate chunk because you can't go wrong. It was really good, but it was stuck to the skillet. We eventually had to ask for a knife to help scrape it off the bottom. My friend had the beignet and it was hard to cut through as well. The outside was really crispy and good but you still needed a knife to break through it because the spoon wasn't doing a very good job. I was expecting a traditional beiginet. This looked more like some sort of circular pastry thing with berries and whipped cream. No powdered sugar. It wasn't even that doughy. It was good, just different that the traditional beignet that I was expecting.  The wait staff was awesome and professional. The service we received was up there with the service you would receive at a fancy steakhouse. Everything (minus the lack of broccoli on my plate) was great!"
popeye a.,"Chicago, IL",0,37,59,5.0,6/24/2017,"Good ribs, atmosphere and service.  Would love for them to come to my city."
Mark B.,"Houston, TX",416,313,2205,1.0,7/3/2015,"This visit from bad from the beginning.  Went on a Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was maybe 40% full. The hostess tried to seat us at an oddly shaped table that honestly just didn't look like much fun. The best part was there was an ill behaved child running amok at the next table. Yeah, no thanks, we would like to sit over here.  I ordered a burger with a wedge salad. I asked what came on the salad, the waiter told me, only he left it it would be covered in tomatoes. I am deathly allergic. They brought another one with out the tomatoes, but with a long black hair!! I didn't know that could still happen in 2015, but there it was. The salad went back.  My burger was severely undercooked. Medium doesn't mean raw.  Our server said the manager said to pick out a desert on him. We didn't bother, and he didn't even bother to come by the table.  This place has really changed, I won't be back."
Ryan E.,"Arlington, TX",51,188,61,3.0,4/29/2017,I ordered curbside to go for dinner one evening. I get to the designated spot and call the number to let them know I am there. The person who answers does not even say hello. I wait about 10 minutes for my food to arrive. The person who took my order brings my food out and doesn't say a word. She takes my card and comes back saying nothing else again. She does not look very happy to take my order. The food was good as usual but service was terrible.
La'Trevia H.,"Houston, TX",168,104,89,4.0,10/3/2015,"My mother and I came here for dinner after we left Baybrook mall. First, there's outdoor patio seating and that's where we sat. It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  Second, our server was nice but the service was kind of slow. Like we had waited like 5-10 minutes just for our drinks. I ordered a Strawberry Mojito and my mom ordered a Dr. Pepper. The mojito was alright, nothing too special.  Third, our food was a little slow coming out. But it was worth the wait! LOL! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms and wedge fries! It was OH SO DELICIOUS!!  Definitely would come back if I'm in the area, but it's often that I'm not. But it's a good place to eat if you're in the area."
Karen Y.,"Houston, TX",168,187,119,2.0,9/23/2017,"I wasn't going to write this review at first, since BJ's IS a chain restaurant that you normally wouldn't expect anything too far over mediocre for, but my most recent experience here inspired me to post my thoughts. Before this, I had always seen BJ's as a pretty solid place to eat with family or friends. This time, however, the food was the worst I've ever tasted from BJ's. I ordered the clam chowder and caesar salad combo, which was a big mistake in itself. It was somehow the worst chowder and salad I've ever had at a restaurant, which is not surprising because this isn't a particularly healthy or seafood-y restaurant. The waiter was really courteous but barely seemed to pay attention to our table, besides bringing us food and the occasional water refill. He didn't even clear our dinner plates before bringing out our pizookies. The pizookies were the only redeeming part of the meal, but then again, pizookies are really hard to mess up."
Brenda F.,"Friendswood, TX",0,3,,5.0,6/26/2017,We love this place! The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. We often get a group together to meet after work and love the personal service they give us. And their seared ahi tuna salad is the best I've EVER had! Be sure to try it ;-)
Tony D.,"Webster, TX",5,15,,1.0,2/25/2017,So we walk   we are standing there and the hostess is texting on her phone(figures). So i said can we get a table?? So we are seated looking at menus and we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order or at least get recognized...NOTHING!! So i said screw this! As we walked out i told the hostess you need more wait staff. she said ok whatever. goodnight! I want to thank BJs for a lousy service. Because we went to the Cheesecake Factory and spent $150.00 on the best meal of my life!!
Stef K.,"Houston, TX",0,8,31,3.0,9/23/2016,"It's was OK. Salad was plain and boring, pizza was dry. Spaghetti with meatballs was really good though"
Richard W.,"Seabrook, TX",58,135,54,2.0,3/5/2017,GAVE it another try same results poor customer service and marginal food that's overpriced.
Catherine L.,"Memphis, TN",94,10,5,1.0,5/22/2017,"Very disappointed. I come to BJ's regularly, but I won't be returning after tonight. We waited for the server for 10 minutes. Given the crowd, the wait wasn't justified. Previously known as a pizza and beer joint, they've revamped their menu to include lots of salads, soups, steaks, and other trendy foods. Clearly their added quantity of items led to a decrease in quality. The pizza was ICE COLD. The cheese was hard not stringy, and the crust was soggy. Even the pan was cold to the touch, indicating the pizza had been out of the oven for at least 30 minutes. Considering the large group of 20 seated, we likely received an extra from their party. The server never asked how anything was, I had to call him over. He was rude and said he'd ask the kitchen. He only offered to put the pizza back in the oven for a few minutes. Very poor customer service and food quality."
Cristy O.,"Houston, TX",8,16,2,2.0,5/14/2017,"Bad waiter service tonight. Waited over 10 min for him to come to our table for the first time, when it turned out that he had been waiting on the table right next to us and he had already passed in front of our table at least three times. I honestly would've never thought he was our waiter. Almost 10 minute waiting and he didn't care to at least say ""I'll be right with you, etc"" (No, he wasn't loaded or busy with food or drinks, had free hands)-(No, it was NOT a busy night, counted at least 13 empty tables inside). He rushed us through the menu, even though I had questions. When he served a slice of pizza in my plate from the pizza stand, he didn't serve it, but more like threw it on my plate. He didn't even apologized. I got a feeling he doesn't want to work there, he treated us like items on an assembly line not like customers. Never had an experience like this in other BJ's before. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the hostesses were incredibly nice."
Lauren F.,"Round Rock, TX",91,244,169,2.0,2/28/2015,"I usually love BJs. But this location kind of sucks. Even though there was no one with a five pm reservation, they refused to take our reservation because there was one for 4pm and 6pm.  When my group was seated it took forever before our drink orders with were taken and even longer before we actually got our drinks. At this point the restaurant was still fairly empty. As the dinner time ruch came, our service got worse and worse.   Our waiter let our dirty dishes pile up to a small mountain,  then he wouldn't bring us our checks for quite a while. I would think with the lines of people waiting for tables, they would want to collect their money so that they can free up a table.  The only good thing about tonight was the food. The food, as always; was great."
Lori W.,"Dallas, TX",2,53,20,4.0,10/6/2016,"I've been to several BJ'S and this is the first time I've  been to this one. I started with a BLT Salad, it was good but if I had my choice I'd make it with Romaine lettuce in stead of Spinach.  I also had the baked Zita. It was very good but It's made with Penne pasta not Ziti pasta....I grew up in New York and most of my friend's last names end with the letter ""O"" so I know Italian food.! I love the house beer selection here! It is the main reason I come to BJ's. Tonight I tried the Nutty Brewnette and the Berry Blast Cider and both are VERY GOOD! The cider is sweet, crisp and refreshing! Great  job! I had it after the Nutty Brewnette and I think the contrasting tastes really worked. Kind of like eating salty pop corn and then a chocolate treat at the movies. So BJ'S needs to start selling shirts with their beer logos!!!! I'd buy one! Two! Or Three! On a  negative note the kitchen was slow at getting the food out. Especially on a night that was not that busy, the place was barley a third full! It was not a problem for me as I was relaxing and in no rush but the table next to ours was getting a little annoyed."
Jocelyn V.,"Webster, TX",130,2,,3.0,9/9/2017,"The food was good but our waiter, Ryan B, was really rude and seemed to have quite the attitude.."
Majay M.,"Houston, TX",2,81,106,2.0,6/21/2016,"I've been about 5 times and I think I've had enough. The food is great, kitchen deserves 5 stars with no doubt. Servers on the other hand are making sure many costumes don't return. Both waiters and waitresses are always rushing you, they are very cold when it comes to welcome you as a costumer, there have been many times when I have to ask for things 2-3 times & they don't even say ""sorry"" for forgetting. Look at the tables, seats, & floors...they are dirty!!! all the time. But this one is the worst and it happened twice. Waiter cleaned the floor with rags, put them underneath arm, wiped his hand on the side of his pants and grabbed my check to be paid..I can only see cross contamination there. A couple of days later, I called the manager and explained what happen. He said they'll address that asap. Guess what!! I went this past weekend and the same thing!! Dirty booths, dirty chairs, dirty floors, waitress was close to mean, and I could see her grabbing three glasses with one hand from the inside. I wonder if they go and wash their hands before handing out the next meal. Enough!!! They make me feel like my money has to be given...no! It has to be earned! Response: I did called the manager right after 1st event. We spoke about this issue and he said ""thank you for your feedback"" and he also said he'd talk to them. Since me and husband like the food, we went again the following week to find that nothing changed and that's why I have written about it for the second time. That's why I wrote my review because I already called and see no improvement. Thx So we went again during June for both husband's birthday and Father's Day and a couple of times this past week (1st week of August) just because I love the fried asparagus. I'd like to suggest the asparagus (all the fried ones and, grilled and steamed) to be cut shorter as the base of the steam is always hard to eat (very fibrous)  Also, maybe the meat can be more marinated as it's coming out very hard and not much flavor when I asked for it ""well done"". Thx"
Genie N.,"South Houston, TX",8,17,7,2.0,7/8/2016,"Toughest, driest ribeye I've ever had in my entire life. I got it to go and of course I don't want to go back. I'm having to saw through this like a piece of wood. I asked for medium and it does look kind of pink in the center. I have no idea how you can fuck up a ribeye this bad."
Dahlia D.,"League City, TX",85,110,96,4.0,2/3/2017,"We love coming to BJ's! Like any other restaurant out there, you can't always have a great server, but most of the time here we do. One of my favorite drinks to get is the Black Velvet, which is a combo of the berry cider and either the pm porter or tatonka stout. I will be totally upfront and admit that I pretty much stay away from dark beer unless it's a really good one, but I've tried it both ways and it came out great! Their menu for food is very extensive, so they can accommodate even the picky eaters. Luckily they have an ""enlightened entrees"" section for those of us that want to eat without getting too fat. I've had the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos, and those rock, but the seared ahi tuna salad is AMAZING!!!! The atmosphere is average loudness, laid back, and well put together. Can't wait to go back!"
Terri M.,"Houston, TX",0,11,1,4.0,3/21/2017,Weekends can be a bit tough with the crowd but we go for the beer and Great White pizza. We are never disappointed!
Ana G.,"Houston, TX",4,1,,1.0,8/24/2017,"What drew me to this location was the fact that they described their deep dish pizza as a ""Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza""!! However I ended up paying $27.25 for a pan pizza. When I asked the waitress who brought my food to curbside if it was the right pizza, she insisted they only had two pizzas so it had to be a deep dish. If your advertising deep dish then it should be deep dish. I was not satified at all with this false advertisement!! Laziness is not acceptable either. If the waitress didnt want to walk back to correct order she should of just canceled everything and told the truth instead of just say it was right when the picture of the pizza looks nothing close to what i got!!"
Sarah L.,"Saint Louis, MO",154,249,35,3.0,1/4/2016,"I've been here a few times now.... the food quality is good and you get a nice serving size. I've had to wait for a table most times that'd I've come, but I think they have an app and you can do call ahead reservations. The restaurant area is pretty big, but the restaurant is popular so expect a wait.  I've tried a few things on the menu, my favorite being the dessert pizzoki which is what they like to be known for (it's a hot cookie in a deep dish cookie pan with ice cream on top - yum!  I'll say the last time I was here I had the unhappiest and unfriendly waitress ever. Kinda put a damper on my view of this restaurant. Hopefully I'll get someone else next time, and hopefully her day got a little better...!"
Sharon A.,"Katy, TX",27,168,244,2.0,12/20/2016,"It was a monday night and I needed to go somewhere for dinner that was in the vacinity of my errands.  I went here based on the fact that I've been to the one in my hometown and am fully aware that its just an okay place to eat.  It served its purpose. The server was nearly lifeless but hey it was monday night so I get it!  It was not very busy given that it was a monday.  Anyway I ordered the shrimp tacos that comes with tortilla chips a homemade versions of salsa and a guac.  My food was edible and not too bad, but not at all warm either.  So you get 2 tortillas filled with homemade slaw, frozen shrimps that you would find in the freezer section at the supermarket, and a sauce.  I polished that off with a draft pear cider that was flat.  The server said it was prob cuz that particular beer hadnt been served so the carbonation didnt kick in yet.  The next beer I ordered was the draft berry blast combo that offsets the sweetness of the berry and that I did enjoy.  Overall I'm not a beer drinker but the combo of cider and whatever it was was good!"
Stephanie M.,"Citrus Heights, CA",2,18,11,4.0,7/8/2016,This was my first time going here for dinner and not just pizookis. Dinner was great! Perfect date night spot. I'd hold off on drinks though because the one I ordered was like $10 and it wasn't that great in my opinion.
