Harrison M.,"Cypress, TX",13,121,,3.0,9/9/2008,"I have been here several times and the food has always been nice.  The service can leave a little to be desired tho.  All of the times that I have sat in the bar area the service has been really great, but when I went with the family and was seated in the restaurant the service was just plain horrible."
Susan L.,"Menlo Park, CA",54,582,37,2.0,4/6/2008,"Definitely  the worst BJ's I've been to.  The service was really slow, and the caesar salad was terrible (like it had been sitting out all day)."
Stacy H.,"Belleville, IL",0,9,,3.0,1/7/2011,Food was great but getting it took forever!  We got our beers quickly but had to wait quite a while for our waitress to come back and check on us while we waited with empty glasses and no food.  Granted it was a busy night with the Sugar Bowl on.
