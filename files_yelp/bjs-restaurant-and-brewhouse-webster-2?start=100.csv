Nina C.,"Leavenworth, KS",26,25,2,4.0,6/4/2016,I like that they have their own beers and more options for beer. Small menu. Great place to just have casual meal without paying too much of a price.
Daniel V.,"Pearland, TX",62,138,137,4.0,11/17/2014,Definitely one of my favorite spots for food porn. I love the atmosphere here and the staff is very friendly. The Frito nachos were really good but it was a bit small for 2 people. The jalapeno burger was awesome and wasn't too spicy. The desert was a good variety of cookies & ice cream called pizookies. They were also really good and I recommend them to anybody who loves warm cookies with ice cream.
Mac W.,"League City, TX",1,16,,5.0,7/16/2015,We happened into BJ's this evening and my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was incredible and our waiter did a wonderful job helping us with us with our first time being there.  We really enjoyed the Shrimp Scampi and Fried Beignets. The whole meal went well and we will definitely return soon.
Amber D.,"Pearland, TX",3,7,,5.0,2/5/2015,A favorite lunch and dinner spot for the family. We've never had a bad experience and the bartenders are always friendly and willingly make custom drinks
Elena J.,"Deer Park, TX",0,6,2,2.0,7/4/2015,"This is the second time I've tried bjs. Both times I had a problem with my dish and there was no offer to replace, refire, or take off my tab. This time I had the salmon which I asked to be cooked rare. When I told the waitress it had been overcooked to the point of dry she told me ""well at least you have a side you can eat."" Um...what?? Just done with a restaurant that obviously doesn't care about the quality of food or servers."
Arpita D.,"Houston, TX",7,7,7,4.0,5/25/2015,Oh I love this place! The ambience and food.. Both go hand-in-hand! The chicken has a very nice smoky smell.. Which took me along
Traveller222 2.,"Webster, TX",8,58,9,2.0,4/13/2015,Pizza was crappy and under cooked. I guess it taste good if you're completely drunk. I wouldn't recommend their pizza. I would not go back here for food.
Yvette W.,"Pearland, TX",37,155,46,3.0,2/11/2014,"The Lunch specials are a good price for the food so definitely a good deal.   The food here is decent although I'd stick with the well known dishes like pizza or safety picks like burgers.    Big TV's everywhere so if you don't like sports or loud crowds you probably shouldn't come here.   And if you DO like sports, you probably shouldn't come here unless you want to sit at the bar.   It's hard to really watch the TV's just because the place is so big - you can watch but you won't be engaged if know what I mean.    Service is just average, nice waiter/waitress the past few times I've been but the food takes a while to come out.   So overall....average restaurant.   But the important thing is that it is CONSISTENTLY average.    I've never had extra poor service for example or bad food come out.   So if you just want to eat and don't want to take any risks, BJ's is a decent bet."
Karma H.,"Texas City, TX",16,4,,2.0,6/6/2015,Although  our waiter was very good I must give two stars because of slow food service. The appetizers came out nice and hot. We order the avocado egg rolls. They are usually  amazing  but this time they were iffy. We ordered our food which took at least 30 minutes but closer to 45 to come out. The fries were cold my pizza was warm and not crunchy as it usually  is. One friend ordered the California club they brought a chicken sandwich that too was cold. My other friend burger was cold also. Seems like they root beer recipe has artificial sweetners now because it leaves that terrible after taste. I am disappointed because this place was once my favorite spot to eat. Food quality has gone down.
PopeyeDaSailaman ..,"Houston, TX",1,28,22,2.0,3/18/2015,Food is overall good but the service sucks I also did not like the deepdish bjs favorite pizza it was not good I ended up paying for it even thougj I only ate one slice because the server is a real douchbag
Jennifer H.,"Channelview, TX",0,11,1,5.0,4/9/2016,"lots of choices, great food and the service was superb. Our server helped me to download the app and pay from my phone."
Daniel L.,"Houston, TX",4999,1312,2725,3.0,4/22/2011,"What time is it? Beer o'clock. And it hasn't been that time in quite a long time since TwoRows shut their magical cullis gates in the Village. The cheese pizza is killer. The crust is always perfect and it has enough sauce underneath the cheese to make it a legit pizza, rather than a cracker underneath with a bunch of cheese on top. The beers are the best part though."
Andre G.,"Houston, TX",1,3,,4.0,4/4/2016,This past weekend was the greatest experience Ive had in a long while this place is so awesome the waitresses are so polite and attentive. The atmosphere  is outstanding so as the food. Stop in and dine in you wont regret it!
Kyle T.,"Loop, TX",7,43,3,2.0,6/22/2013,I checked Yelp before we ate at BJs and I had noticed many comments about terrible service......they were right! Great food and poor service in summary.  We had burgers and BBQ Pizza that was wonderful. It took almost an hour for our food to arrive.  I also called ahead because we had a table of 11 people.  They had our spot ready on arrival (they also had plenty of room for a Friday night) The manager DID come to our table and offer to cover our desserts if anyone wanted some after our meal.  If they were more prompt on meals and service I would go back. The food/beer/atmosphere is great but I will not be returning until I see better reviews on service from Yelp.
Claudia L.,"Pasadena, TX",3,5,1,2.0,3/13/2015,"We usually enjoy the food here but everything tonight was very disappointing. Service was horrible, food was meh. The cheese sticks weren't cooked all the way, avocado egg rolls weren't sealed properly so whenever we pick them up, they just fall apart. I tried the clam chowder in a bread bowl and it was super salty. The kids cheeseburger came with cheddar, I assumed that it would've been American cheese... I asked the neighboring server for a manager and the manager was quick to respond to us and took care of us. The neighboring server came by to make sure that the manager did swing by our tables which in my opinion was above and beyond."
Elisa H.,"Alvin, TX",0,2,,2.0,4/21/2015,"The Avocado Rolls and salad were great, the service was great, but the entrées were a disaster. I had the salmon and veggies and my friend had chicken fried steak with a baked potato. The salmon was overcooked and the chicken fried steak was dry and tasted bad. I'm sure they'll look into the kitchen and see what's going on."
Bizi B.,"Houston, TX",2,12,5,4.0,5/27/2013,"Fresh Atlantic Salmon, flame broiled. It's to-die-for!! I LOVE that this place is open late and has such a lengthy menu. I bring my people here when we're on the hunt for food later in the evening. The price is a little higher, but I think its more than worth it considering its not your boring ""chicken crispers,"" plus you're paying for a classier dining environment.  Some of the waitstaff has been... interesting. But I suppose thats forgivable. NommNomNom BJs!"
Romero L.,"Houston, TX",5000,230,243,4.0,7/21/2014,Decided to try the place out since staying across the street at a hotel.Placed an order for avacado egg rolls and chicken lettuce wraps both dishes were excellent.I also liked the choice of beers and that you can get samples of the beers before ordering.A favorite go to spot in Clear Lake.
K F.,"Humble, TX",29,153,55,3.0,8/2/2014,"...anyone else have a tendency to call this place bl#$ jo*$? Or , it just me?  I like it though, good food and cold beer us always good."
Steve J.,"Houston, TX",46,5,,2.0,2/19/2016,"The food is okay here, but the service is some of the worst that I have ever experienced. I have been here several times now, due to friends that like to come here, but if it were not for that, I would not come back."
