Christine M.,"Houston, TX",3,5,,2.0,1/1/2015,"Service was good but the meal left me unsatisfied. I ordered the fish tacos grilled. Food came out about 20 minutes later; I expected it to be nice and hot off the grill, but was welcomed by a luke warm plate. I'll probably go back and give this place another try because service was quite friendly."
Jo W.,"Houston, TX",0,17,,3.0,12/26/2015,This used to be my favorite restaurant but they are slipping. Some of the signature dishes vary in quality. The waitstaff is young and inexperienced. I was in the middle of a conversation and several times had an arm thrown in front of me with no announcement or asking of pardon. And the waitress's order pad looked like a fourth graders notebook.
Mike G.,"Bloomington, IN",1,5,,4.0,8/14/2015,"Good food and a great drink selection. A fun place to watch some sports, or enjoy talking to your friends. Only complaint is that our service took a long time because there was so many people there. Management might want to think about hiring a few more wait staff!"
Eric B.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",2129,5344,4760,3.0,5/26/2010,"I took a 4:05 PM flight from OAK to Hobby last Sunday for a Houston-area business trip that includes Pasadena, Downtown, and the Woodlands. Considering an almost 4 hour flight , a 2 hour time difference, and mandatory visits to baggage claim and the rental car counter, I didn't see the signs of southbound I-45 until about 10:30 PM. My body of course told me that it was earlier, and with no dinner and only Southwest snacks behind me, it was time to get something to eat. So after checking into the hotel, I headed out on the lonely Bay Area Boulevard of broken dreams.  I tried Sherlock's Pub first, but the kitchen was closed. And although the beer selection was tempting and the waitress was very helpful, the only thing available on the menu was bad karaoke and heated up DiGiorno pizza. meh. So I headed down the road a few miles to BJ's, despite my vow that I was going to try to avoid national chain restaurant eating during this trip.  The main dining room was closed, but there was plenty of nice and comfortable seating in the bar area of BJ's. Various sports highlights were on the screen, but I wasn't in much of a mood to watch, as my beloved Sharks had just been swept from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Blackhawks. At the same time, the Porter was tasty and it was great to just sit down and relax, even though it was past my bedtime.  Table service was friendly, although overall service was a bit slow. There was also the smell of stale tobacco in the air, even though I didn't notice anyone doing the dirty deed. The upshot of that was a bad taste in my mouth and barely lukewarm chicken sliders that were a ""bit"" past their delivery time. During normal business hours, I would have sent them back, but it was too late and I was too hungry to care. Even so, the food was tasty enough, gave me a bit of a second wind, and sent my back to the hotel in a reasonable mood, and more ready for the week to come."
A. S.,"Houston, TX",58,119,14,3.0,5/27/2013,"BJ's is like a mini- Cheesecake Factory in terms of the ridiculous amount of items on their menu, and you have to know what to get or you'll be smack in the middle of ""meh"" city. Think upscale Chili's fare (with bonus pizza!) The pizza is the best thing about this place. With the wide availability of good craft beer in the area, the need for a sub-par brew pub is nil, but then again BJ's is a monster chain to be reckoned with. The beers range from middle-of-the-road to just plain mundane and all the way back to so-so. I like that they added the ""small bites"" section of the menu to beef up their (often) scant entrees. The size of the appetizers is almost laughable. We've had nearly every appetizer, from avocado egg rolls to calamari to buffalo wings and while boyfriend claims the wings are ""boss"", I can't say they amount to much above what we could get cheaper elsewhere. Six TINY wings on a plate, that'll be $9 please.  The servers are rarely friendly, the hostesses often aloof and busy toiling in teenage angst, and the food is always sluggish getting out of the kitchen. Sit in the bar area, get really good happy hour pricing/specials. If you don't sit in the bar, they won't tell you that happy hour prices do not apply. Enjoy your $60 tab for two! The best thing to do at BJ's is go at happy hour (ends at 7), get a flatbread appetizer pizza on special (don't bother with personal sizes, they're complete rip-offs), and a couple beers."
David R.,"Houston, TX",0,17,,1.0,7/13/2015,"We arrived at 2:30 on Saturday after taking in a morning show at the circus. The wait for a table was short, as expected at that time of day. My dad ordered one of their black cherry sodas. The waitress returned to say they were out. I ordered a Goose Island Sophie. The waitress returned to say they were out of that, too. Even though the place was empty, the food took absurdly long to arrive. When the food finally did come, my youngest son's food was missing. That took another five minutes. So all in all, about 35 minutes for freaking kids chicken tenders and fries. The order of mozzarella sticks had a napkin between them and the plate. I assume this is to catch some of the grease. Except when you pull one up from the plate, now your mozzarella stick has paper napkin all over it. I snagged a piece of my wife's pizza. Very underwhelming with a gummy crust. There are just too many other places in Clear Lake to get decent food. We won't be back."
Catherine C.,"New Orleans, LA",84,108,59,4.0,8/10/2014,"Mandee P. was a great server.  The mac & cheese is delicious and the pork chops on the light menu were great.  The potatoes and green beans were bland, but since it's a light menu who can blame them.  Overall a good, chain restaurant experience."
Chris H.,"Pearland, TX",36,173,2,4.0,5/10/2013,My wife and I were out running errands last night (Thursday) and realized we hadn't stopped for dinner. It was 10pm. Started looking for a place to eat that was not fast food. All of the restaurants close at 10. Our first three choices were already closed. The only option left was BJ's. It would be nice if more places than Chili's and IHOP stayed open past 10:00 on weeknights. just my opinion.  Ok moving on- ended up at BJ's in Webster. We have been to the one in Pearland numerous times so we are accustomed to the high prices for average food. I am a coke zero drinker and when I asked if they had coke zero I was told no. I said ok I will take a diet coke then. I was told Diet Pepsi was as close as I was going to get. I ended up with Diet Pepsi and it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I ordered the deep dish pizza and I know it takes time to cook. We were not in a hurry and I would rather it come out hot and overcooked rather than just barely done and luke warm. I ordered Pepperoni and Onion. what came out was Pepperoni and bacon. I took a slice off and started eating it. Realizing that it was not my pizza I sent it back. The waiter picked up the pizza and took it away. I was left wondering what they did with it since it had already been served. Anyway there was nothing wrong with my wife's order so she enjoyed her calzone why I sat and watched her eat.  The waiter admitted he put it in wrong and the correct pizza would be right out. For the price of their food I expect it right the first time. To give our server credit he was very busy with numerous tables.  Once the pizza came out my wife was almost finished with her dinner so I had two slices and I was done.  When the bill came it was $70!! the server forgot to take off the incorrect pizza. I guess I wouldn't have been irritated if would have been apologetic.  Anyway got correct bill and we were on our way. The visit could have been smoother but at that time of night you have very little options on where to go.
Allen L.,"Webster, TX",11,13,2,2.0,11/21/2014,The service here is horrible. Everyone looks like they have to take a poop. No smiles. My girlfriend received a refill on her Dr Pepper only after she had finished her meal. The waiter checked on us one time and that was at the end of our meal. we will not be going back.
Reid M.,"La Marque, TX",6,27,,1.0,5/2/2015,"I've been here twice, the first time our service was good and food was good, nothing amazing. Second trip was a terrible experience, I ordered a Medium Rare steak with a house salad, my friend ordered Lasagna with a wedge salad. Taylor was our server and after 20 minutes we had to ask a waiter in passing to check on our salads, he turned out to be the only helpful person during our visit. Our waitress returned a few minutes later with our salads and rather than acting apologetic she had an attitude. My friend and I are restaurant managers, we are never unfriendly or deserving of attitude. My house salad was a Caesar salad with ranch dressing, the waitress disagreed and responded that she just made it herself and it was a house salad with ranch. Unless their house salad is romaine lettuce with croutons and shaved Parmesan only, then she was wrong. When my steak came out it was well-done, I mentioned it to her and she rolled her eyes. So I decided I just wanted out of the restaurant. I ate my steak and we finished our meals before she even mentioned the issue to a manager. The manager did comp my steak - but my issue wasn't about the money. I would rather pay for a good experience than have a free bad experience."
Janis C.,"Houston, TX",0,10,,2.0,10/28/2014,"Takes way too long to get a menu then another long wait for someone to actually come and take your order. Then there's the long wait for your food that seems like an eternity. Don't go here hungry. If you want a good place to have drinks with friends you are in the right place. If you want good food at good prices, go somewhere else.  I ordered the sirloin and baked potato. The potato wasn't  warm enough to melt the butter. The steak was ok, small diameter, but thick. Wouldn't order either again."
Eliot C.,"Austin, TX",140,20,4,4.0,6/11/2014,"Mac n cheese looks good...Sure it's a suburban paradise's chain, but it was good."
Daryl D.,"Houston, TX",4,10,10,2.0,9/7/2014,"The best part about this place was the water..... While the service was fantastic the food all tasted like it was from a hungry man tv dinner. I had the southern chicken fried steak which was burnt and bland. When it came out it was on a plate just dropped on top of the mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. The mashed potatoes tasted powdered, and the steamed vegetables were an off color so I left them alone. I had a beer which was their in house pm porter and it also tasted pretty mediocre.  But it did get a little better after it warmed up to the proper serving temp."
Ryan R.,"Houston, TX",35,4,1,1.0,4/21/2013,"Wish i could give zero stars. Worst service I've ever had...and that's saying a lot. I have been three times, thinking maybe they were having ""off days"" and to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the service actually got worse each time. I will never go back. The last visit my party was told we could wait for a table (the place was completely empty except for one section) since only one server had made it in to work. I responded to my party that ""or we could just go somewhere else"" -- so we did. Every time I've been, they treated us like we were fortunate they allowed us to spend money there."
Renee E.,"Webster, TX",15,22,3,4.0,6/21/2014,"Come later in the evening if you go on Friday or Saturday easier to get a bar seat. Then you are closer to the handcrafted beers.  There are too many to list here but trust me they have one for everybody. Did I mention the deep dish pizza. I was hoping there would be no kids here but there is  one standing up in there seat right behind me. It's annoying. Anyway back to the pizza.  It's good, the crust is phenomenal."
Geri K.,"Houston, TX",277,74,18,4.0,7/17/2014,"First time here, Sunday lunch and the food was very good. The place was not busy at all and the service was lacking.  I am hoping they were just short handed because I would like to give them another try."
Stephanie I.,"League City, TX",109,14,19,4.0,8/17/2014,Food was good although it seemed a litte slow getting out. Rocky our waiter was a hoot and made our experience enjoyable. Will certainly be back.
Tannia L.,"Pearland, TX",199,60,80,5.0,5/30/2014,Love this place. Always good service and great atmosphere! Great for family and friends. Great bar area and booth sections plus outside patio.
Natalie M.,"Houston, TX",2,19,,2.0,6/18/2014,Went for lunch with my boyfriend its ok good I enjoyed the flat bread for an appetizer but I decided to go with the brewed blonde shrimp and didn't care too much for it.... It was fried too hard and didn't really have a taste. Shrimp was really small. This is a cool drinking place that's all I have good to say about it.
Nicole B.,"Houston, TX",20,46,101,4.0,7/4/2013,"The food is consistently pleasant. The new brew 'Oasis' was very tasty and the new corn fritters with bacon aioli was scrumptiously delicious.   On prime time dining, do call ahead seating request - can call no more than 30 minutes in ahead."
