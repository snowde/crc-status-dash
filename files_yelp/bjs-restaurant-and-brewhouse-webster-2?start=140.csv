Zane H.,"San Francisco, CA",468,41,21,4.0,7/27/2011,"Everyone knows that everything in Clear Lake closes at 9pm and that the options are quite limited if you are looking for a night snack. BJ's is our default place to hangout because the food is great, atmosphere fun/chill, and the beer makes me happy! Heck, we would hang out here back in high school even before we were of legal drinking age. Everyone in the area knows it too because there is almost always a wait here. BEER - You want to know why the beer here is so good? All the beer in Houston-area BJ's is contracted out to your favorite local brewery, Saint Arnold's! Well, that, and the fact that they just have some amazing recipes. Having tried all the beers here, I will have to say that my favorite is the Harvest Hefeweizen. It's a Bavarian-style wheat beer that is a just so refreshing. The first time I had this beer, I remember exclaiming, ""What kind of crap beer have I been drinking up until this point?!"" I am also a big fan of the P.M. Porter (smooth dark ale with hints of chocolate and caramel). PIZOOKIE - This is the very reason we started coming here back in High School! Even if you don't drink beer, BJ's is worth the visit because of the Pizookie. Close your eyes, and just imagine a freshly baked cookie in a deep dish that is so soft and hot that it melts in your mouth. (Obviously, your eyes are NOT closed because you are reading this, but anyways...) Now, imagine that same cookie with a couple scoops of vanilla bean icecream on top. They have a variety of delicious cookies, including Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Oatmeal Raisin Walnut, Red Velvet, or my favorite, Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate. If you can't decide which amazing flavor you want, then you can get the Pizookie Trio, which is three smaller Pizookies of your choice. SNACKS & SMALL BITES - If you just came to grab a beer with your friends and aren't looking to eat anything substantial, then BJ's has a menu for you too! I will warn you that these things are popular, and they sometimes sell out of them on the weekends. My favorite small bites have got to be the fried artichokes, the spinach-stuffed mushrooms, and the mozzarella and tomato salad. FOOD - The deep dish pizza is quite popular here, and I would recommend the Great White or the Spinach/Artichcoke one. They used to have these amazing BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders, but now they only offer it in sandwich form. I still get it though. The menu is fairly extensive here, so when in doubt, just ask your server what's good.               TIP - It's always crowded. They do not take reservations, but will let you call in and put your name on the list. TL;DR - Beer and Pizookie! Beer and Pizookie! Beer and Pizookie!"
Melissa B.,"Houston, TX",21,16,,4.0,11/22/2011,Me and my husband like to dine here on Mondays.  $5 Martinis and half price pizza after 9:00pm!!  I love the Angus Dip with extra grilled onions and my husband loves the pizza.  The pizza is Chicago style deep dish and they load the toppings. We always sit in the bar area.  Sometimes the service is slow at the tables.
Renee B.,"Friendswood, TX",0,3,,4.0,7/30/2014,"The menu has a great selection, and the food is delicious. I like the curb side delivery option they have for orders to go, too. Fast and convenient!"
Adilehg T.,"Houston, TX",40,66,,1.0,3/3/2014,"Average food, bad customer service. Our lunch took 30 minutes to arrive and came out lukewarm. Manager was pretty indifferent. He offered a free dessert."
Lauren V.,"Houston, TX",20,23,2,1.0,11/10/2014,"Typically I give the food, service and atmosphere at BJs 5 stars, but after an incident yesterday, I am very concerned! My BF and I visited the restaurant on Sunday around 1 to catch a few games and eat. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and wings (food was excellent as always). The issue is when we were closing our tab: I typically don't review the bill and just know if it's about $30, it's about right. Well I know my BF only had 2 beers and yet there were 3 on there, an extra $4.00 charge. The bartender saw us questioning each other and said ""oh, I added an extra beer, just incase you wanted another but I can take it off if you are done""... Ummm HELL NO! Do not charge us for something WE DID NOT get! Now I wonder how many times we have paid for stuff we did not receive and so should everyone else. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED in this practice and now will have to review everything very carefully. What's even more sad is the manager acted like oh ok no problem I'll remove it as an error. It was not an error it was deliberately trying to overcharge your customers!"
Andrew F.,"Tyler, TX",0,9,,4.0,7/26/2015,"This place has some of best american-style food I've had in Clearlake so far. The avocado egg rolls are very good and they come with a tasty sauce. For my first first here, I had the Mahi Mahi fish on the light menu and it was just ""ok."" The fish was a little overcooked but the rest of the dish had a delicious mix of vegetables and rice. I didn't try any of their alcoholic drinks, but the draft root beer was great. For desert we actually got a pazooki for free from our waitress! It was our first time coming here so she said it was on the house. If we hadn't gotten the Pazooki for free, I would say it's not worth the price. Overall a good experience and I will be back."
Amy K.,"League City, TX",1,9,,1.0,4/30/2014,Terrible service for the third time in a row! I have given up on this place. Love the food but the service is nonexistent. We had a table of five and walked out after standing outside the booth waiting for someone to clean the grease stained booth. Literally asked three people and no one cared! They have lost our business forever :(
Chris F.,"Seabrook, TX",1,13,,5.0,7/17/2012,This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  The Piranha pale ale is one of my favorite beers of all time.  The Mediterranean  Pizza is one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted.  There is a reason this place is always packed.
Eleanor B.,"Dickinson, TX",1,20,,4.0,11/12/2013,"I like their large menu. Great salads and something for everyone. Lots of room, so it is easy to get a place to sit without a long wait. Reasonable prices"
Igno R.,"Houston, TX",0,81,,2.0,5/28/2013,"This place has good beer and the food is okay, but the service is awful.  Every time I've gone here we get some rude crummy waitress."
Dylan H.,"Dickinson, TX",53,234,23,4.0,1/19/2014,"Excellent service and a great atmosphere throughout.  The parking lot is strange but large.  On a busy Sunday lunch rush, seated immediately.  15 minutes from order to food on the table.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were good but a touch bland.  The deep dish pizza is good, but required more sauce.  The ribs are exemplary, and the Tuscan chicken limone was spot on."
Lee J.,"Houston, TX",513,94,335,3.0,12/30/2010,"Went here on a Monday night. The place was packed. At least the wait for a table wasn't so bad (about 15 minutes).  We ordered the roast beef au jus sandwich and fries ($9.95), medium 2-topping pizza ($16.95), and kid's meal ($5.25, choice of meat with a side and drink). The sandwich was tasty. The deep-dish pizza with large chunks of juicy tomatoes, black olives, and pepperoni was delicious. The kid's corndogs weren't so great, but my niece ate them anyway. She mostly dug out the meat and left the outer shells on her plate. She didn't touch her mashed potatoes, but her strawberry lemonade was tasty. I kept sneaking sips when she wasn't looking. :) Our server wasn't so friendly or attentive, but at least he apologized for taking so long with our silverware and napkins. The place was busy, so maybe he was just having a bad day and had to bus more tables than he could handle. Still, service can add or delete a star in my book!"
Allison L.,"Webster, TX",57,52,354,3.0,5/25/2011,"Great pizza, cookies, avocado egg rolls & baked potatoes with Alfredo sauce."
Jolena P.,"Texas City, TX",0,2,4,1.0,5/2/2014,Ordered a burger and it was raw and bloody! Food took forever to come out. Not worth going again and forsure not on your lunch break!
Diane N.,"Austin, TX",518,278,195,4.0,8/27/2013,"The Thai Shrimp Lettuce wraps with the mango and jicama salsa was a light and refreshing dish for me. Even though its listed under appetizers, it was able to fill me up. The service there was very attentive. I also had the mac and cheese which was pretty good."
Hans S.,"Silverdale, WA",42,48,12,5.0,4/4/2014,"Been to BJ's around four times and its always been great. The food is always good with a good presentation, i usually get the gumboliya and my wife a type of pizza. The place is filled with tvs to watch a game and has a very nice bar with more tvs. Staff has always been attentive and polite, make sure you also check out their brewed beer."
Angela K.,"Friendswood, TX",7,31,11,3.0,8/22/2013,The bar was by far better than eating in the dining area. Bartender was much more attentive and helpful than previous servers. Allowed us to sample beers to find what we wanted and there was also reverse happy hour 9-11!
Jim H.,"Houston, TX",12,24,5,1.0,8/29/2012,"We walked in at bout 12:45 p.m. on a Wednesday and the place was frozen. I mean really cold.  It was about 1/5 full of people.  Bad sign.  It took 15 minutes for our waiter to arrive. It took another ten for the water to get there.  I don't know why it took so long.  He only had a three table section.  The girl who ran our food practically threw the plates at us.   I had the chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes and vegetables.  She had the mahi tacos.  Both were horrible.  Her tortillas were stale.  My steak was soggy and dry. The gravy was runny and there wasn't enough of it.  The mashed potatoes were hard.  One more time, hard, yes hard.  How do you do that? It was almost like they were powdered.  The ""steamed"" vegetables had liquid running all over the plate desperately trying to soften the potatoes.  (Which actually kinda worked.)  The liquid residue means that the veggies were microwaved in a plastic bag and then cut open to be poured on the plate.  You are supposed to drain the liquid first.  Someone didn't bother to.   This place is horrible."
Jon K.,"Houston, TX",13,15,1,4.0,8/8/2011,"I had the privilege of BJ's being one of the first restaurants I went to when I moved to Houston. It may be a chain restaurant, but with the big portions, great pizza, and terrific house brews it easily surpasses the other chain restaurants.  Upon arrival the group was sat in a large semicircle booth and brought water and drinks immediately. We decided to try an appetizer, Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps, the waiters recommendation that did not disappoint. Following the app and a second round of the delicious house brews the deep dish pizza arrived. AMAZING! The group split three (Great White, Classic, and Hawaiian) and I would recommend all of them.  BJ's proved to be a great place to watch the game, take the family, get a drink, and most definitely pickup some of the best pizza in Houston."
Katie B.,"Kansas City, MO",43,88,2,4.0,6/22/2013,The food is really good. My boyfriend loved the beer. My only complaint is that it was a little pricey.
