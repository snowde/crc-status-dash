Jet F.,"Surprise, AZ",2,218,19,4.0,6/16/2013,Thai Salmon is hard to beat. I kicked the _ _ _ t out of it!!!. Have an oatmeal stout for me. Good times always at BJ's
Sandra S.,"Deer Park, TX",0,11,,2.0,1/30/2015,"My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for what we thought was our usual good food and drinks. However, quickly after seating ourselves at the bar it was evident something was off. Not sure of what was different we continued our drinks and food at the bar. After asking for the tab our waitress pointed to the ticket located in a cup at the bar. Maybe that is normal; however, our usual bartender/waiter Jason would never act so rudely. In that second it made sense...we had a rude waitress. All the subtle gestures made by her this evening all of a sudden made sense. I'm not sure if her rudeness was on account of her dislike of other types of skin colors or if it was her usual self. Either way, we will make sure to avoid her on our next visit. Thanks Michelle for your hospitality..."
Emily D.,"League City, TX",2,22,22,1.0,9/1/2013,"Food is good, but disappointed by the service.  I sat on the patio for 10 to 15 minutes (after being seated by the host) before leaving for Jason's Deli next door.  A server came out to refill drinks at a nearby table, but didn't turn around to look for others. This was a Tuesday evening in July."
Amanda H.,"Grand Prairie, TX",13,5,,2.0,5/7/2012,"So after a funeral, around 25 of us decided to stop in for lunch to visit and enjoy a great meal (or so we'd hoped)...alas, that was not to be the case. This is a review of the experience had by my husband, our 13-year old son and myself.   My husband ordered a beer...waitress came back and said they didn't have it. This happened 4 times. Finally, my husband opened the beer menu and asked the waitress to tell her what they did have. She pointed to a long page of beer names and said that they only had the first beer listed on the page.  She mentioned quite a few of BJ's microbrews and some of the more 'routine' beers.  He finally found one they had in stock.  Then, I ordered a frozen margarita. it was half melted and pretty gross. I asked my husband if he wanted it... he took a sip and said it was too gross to drink. I then ordered an unsweetened tea. I had to ask 2 people over 10min for the tea. They finally brought me a sweet tea. I sent it back and said it needs to be unsweet. (I'm not diabetic but I try to avoid sugar when I can and Splenda works just as well as sugar for tea)...so she brings the correct tea and our appetizer. It also took about 40 minutes and asking 3 people for our son to get his Sierra Mist.  Now the appetizer:   We wanted something simple and ordered chips/salsa.  The salsa was pretty good. It had fire roasted tomatoes and a very good flavor. The chips were a mix of blue corn tortilla, red and white tortilla chips. They were not greasy and very flavorful, but too few. It made our $5.95 appetizer look sparse.   All the food came out in an appropriate time for a group of our size. Now, I will say that of the 20 people at our table, almost everyone had something wrong with their meal. My husband ordered jambalaya. He said it good but a small size for a $15.95 meal. I ordered a baked potato with the basics...cheese, bacon, sour cream, butter and chives. I had to pay $1.95 extra for the bacon and cheese. The baked potato was very dry and tasted old. I'm not sure how else to describe the flavor. The toppings were sparse (especially when I had to pay extra). The brought out a side dish with what appeared to be sour cream with the chives on top. So I loaded my fork with potato and dipped it in the 'sour cream' and chives then took the bite...it was only then did I learn that I'd just taken a huge bite of butter with chives on it. All I can say is ""ewww""...I didn't eat anymore after that. My son ordered a cheese pizza. It also had fire roasted tomatoes on top. It was cheese bread (no sauce) with tomatoes sprinkled on top. The majority of the pizza was crust. It was poorly prepared and (I think) $14.95. When a 13-year old boy won't eat a pizza, you know something isn't right. :-)  There were other issues as well:  I couldn't get a refill on my tea, was unable to get a to go tea, my son never got his drink refilled.  Oh, on a side note...this restaurant would not let us make a reservation, even with such a large group. To read this, I'm sure you're thinking that I complain a lot, but let me assure you, my husband and I are very easy-going people.  We enjoy friendly interactions with the wait staff, aren't overly picky about minor food issues and rarely every complain to a manager (I can think of 3 time in the past year, including this outing).  That being said, some things warrant speaking with the store manager and when that doesn't bring desired results, going to the next level manager.  This is one of those times.  Let me explain (the short version): When it was time to pay, my husband put his credit card in the folder and gave it to the waitress.  Three other groups at the table paid with cards.  About 20 minutes later, the waitress walked over to my husband and loudly told him that his credit card was declined.  While she handed my husband the folder, she held up another folder and asked loudly, ""who is Charles ...""  My husband said that was him and she handed him the second folder.  We then realized, she'd given us someone else's credit card (the one that had been declined).  They'd put our bill with the wrong card and someone else's bill with our card.  (Are you confused yet?)  We take our credit card safety very seriously.  We have close friends who have been the victims of identity theft.  They had excellent credit history...now, after the theft, they've filed for bankruptcy and are struggling to rebuild their credit.  We spoke with the manager, who completely blew us off.  He didn't care to listen to our concerns and asked us if we'd ""be happy"" with a $20 dollar BJ's gift card.  He handed it to my husband before he could answer.  I guarantee the gift card is useless.  We will not be returning to BJ's anywhere.  We feel that it's average food for above average prices."
Kristie E.,"Webster, TX",4,17,16,4.0,1/2/2013,Great brew house to try some non cookie-cutter beers.  The service is usually pretty good and the food.....very good. One of my favorite things on the menu is there chicken wontons and both the sauces (thai and buffalo) are tasty. Everything I've tried there is so good. Their menu is really expansive so I had to start pulling choices out of a baggie blindly so that I'm not tempted to get the same thing everytime. I definitely recommend this place if you don't mind spending a little more than usual. Very casual and relaxed place with a little fancier decor. As with any place we go we get there right when they open to avoid the crowds and it does fill up fast.
Adrian W.,"Mobile, AL",7,2,,2.0,6/16/2013,"BJ's gets 2 stars only because there is no 2.5; good food and good beer, poor service with bar staff who didn't know how to tend bar. Wife and I sat at the full service bar for drinks and appetizers, and to watch game 5 of the NBA finals. After asking for drinks without being offered any, and having to ask for menus and flagging down one of the two bartenders to put in our order, our apps were served. We had the ahi poste, which was really good, and the black and bleu flat bread pizza, which was also put together really well.  The food was good, the service was lacking. For a self proclaimed ""Brewhouse,"" neither of the bartenders knew how to properly pour a craft beer. The IPA was super foamy, and no attempt was made to remedy the discrepancy. The stout was poured haphazardly from the tap and splashed into the glass, and the head looked as if someone had shaken a soapy glass of soda. On four or five different occasions, floor servers brought back drinks from dining room customers who were not satisfied with their drinks.  No management interaction, coupled with bartenders who kept their backs to the customers in order to watch the game instead of paying attention to their patrons brings this review down significantly. Decent plates and a better than average selection of beer is their only saving grace. I will be contacting Saint Arnold's brewery to let them know how their product is being served and represented."
Laura P.,"Houston, TX",72,102,16,4.0,1/28/2012,Love the Santa fe salad with blackened salad. The service was great. I recommend getting there right right at 6 just to avoid long waits.
Leslie G.,"Houston, TX",63,115,59,3.0,11/1/2010,"BJ's has decent prices and good customer service.  I'm not big on American style food all the time (* greasy or fried tend to be staples) and so bj's is a once a month or less type trip. The drinks are good and so are the apps. If you are going to order food I suggest burgers,sandwhiches,and pizzas. Places that have huge menus aren't known for the best food in all categories and this remains true with BJ's. Good for dates, and family night alike. I once had the chicken parmegiana and thought I might just have a heart attack at the table for all the butter they used.....it wasn't fantastic but it was a huge order, HUGE. If you want a heavy dinner then you will like BJ's."
Matt F.,"Dickinson, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/18/2015,"We decided to give this place a second chance. It has been well over a year since we have been there. I will not be back for another year at least. Tell me why, both times we have asked for a ""Table"" and been given a half booth half table. Tell me why, when we inquired about a different table we are told the section is not open(the first visit) or given a stupid look and made to feel uncomfortable(the second visit). So now we are sitting at our half booth and half table and its dirty. Lemon seeds stuck between the table and the wall. What looked like mold in the cracks of the booth(forgetting the fact that we didn't want a booth in the first place). Server had two tables. Took well over 5 min to get a tea and a water. Had to tell him again what our app order was because ""He drew a blank.""  Each part of our meal was delivered by another server. This isn't that bad because I understand teamwork. However, there is a difference between team work and doing someone else's job. I should have tipped the other guy. Maybe I'm picky, but if I'm going to spend my money on a full service experience, maybe I should have gotten one. I'm almost positive that this could have all been resolved if a table touch would have been done by one of the three managers they had on duty that stood next to the bar and talked the entire time. What a shame. The avocado egg rolls are awesome. Maybe I'll just have to get them togo. If they don't find a way to mess that up."
Tim B.,"Alexandria, VA",23,28,6,3.0,4/23/2010,"I go mainly to get their home brewed pear & mixed berry ciders.  Service can be slow, but the cider and desserts make it worthwhile. Warning for out-of-towners: this is a SMOKING restaurant!"
Emmit F.,"San Antonio, TX",2,16,2,4.0,1/9/2013,"Huge menu! Everything I've had here is fresh and good. Great atmosphere. The house beers are very good. A little pricy, parking stinks. GLG20 Approved!"
Ivelisse R.,"San Antonio, TX",7,69,,4.0,8/13/2013,"First time visiting BJ's on our out of town getaway. It was amazing! Love their flavored sodas, and the food was amazing. The service could have been better, but it was great overall. Will have to try it back home."
Tim F.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,27,,5.0,12/23/2010,"Good food, good beer, lots of TV's, and  a nice atmosphere - BJ's is my go-to sit-down pizza restaurant in Clear Lake.  Their pizza is great - the crust is thick (but not too thick) and has a great flavor.  We usually order the BJ's Favorite and hold the meatballs (not sure why, we just think it tastes better without them).   Their beers are good... St. Arnold's brews them locally so they are relatively fresh even though they aren't actually brewed in the tanks at the front of the restaurant.  They always have a seasonal on tap along with four or five year-round offerings (in addition to the usual restaurant beer offerings). So try it out sometime - if there's a wait, it's usually not long and they are somehow usually pretty quick about getting big groups sat even when the place is hopping."
Slo L.,"League City, TX",31,43,5,3.0,8/9/2010,"FAILED! Friday night, trying to figure out what to eat in the area. Almost every restaurant out here, I've either tried it, didn't like it or getting tired of eating of the same place over and over. So we're driving around the area trying to figure out what to eat and to see if we've tried any other new places yet. I heard that BJ's was a good place to dine at. So we decide to check it out. Since it's a Friday of course it will be busy. The wait for 2 people was only 20 mins so it was ok. Waiter was cute and nice. Gave good detail of the menu order. I wanted to try the beers there since its a brewery. Well didn't get to try any of the beers cause their fridge or cooler was broken so there was no cold draft beers except bottles. How the hell you gonna have a brewery and not have cold draft beers?!? I ended up getting a Corona.. We tried the Avocado eggrolls and it wasn't that bad. I think this was way better than my damn fish tacos.    I'm a big fan of fish tacos. I asked the waiter if it was good and he said yes since he loved fish tacos too. I trusted him and got the fish tacos. When I got my fish taco, it was ehhh, the only freaking problem was it wasn't grilled. I prefer grill over fried. Plus the stupid fish looks like a freaking fish stick! WTF?!?!  If I wanted fish sticks, I would of ordered it. Why would you give me fish sticks as a fish tacos?!?! Overall, I still think Tortuga in Galveston or Pappasito's have the fish tacos soo far."
James L.,"Friendswood, TX",5,154,,1.0,11/27/2011,"This place calls itself a brewery?  Oh my.  The beers on tap are the same.  Every day. Every week.  Every month.  You can't get a growler.  Or a half keg. Or a keg.  The 17-year-old servers know nothing about beer.  It's not a microbrewery in any shape, form or fashion.  But, judging from the under and barely-over 21 crowd, that really doesn't matter. Wrap a wonton wrapper around guacamole, fry, and voila! an avocado egg roll. Throw a DiGiorno Pizza in the oven and voila! BJ's deep dish pizza.  Impressive?  Not."
Dynamo F.,"Houston, TX",9,78,15,2.0,7/20/2014,"As an inner-looper, I rarely travel to one of the suburbs. I have visited this restaurant twice in the last two months. The first time was with a group of friends  and we came on a night when there were several ""cheerleading groups"" there for dinner. The service was slow, however, unless each large group calls ahead, events like this can't truly be planned for in advance. The huge disappointment was the server who brought the wrong non alcoholic drink to my friends who eat there quite a bit. My friend explained to the server that her drink was not correct. The server responded it was basically the same. I had to contain my laughter because this is exactly the type of instance the managers at BJ's probably don't envision for employee if the month.This coupled with forgetting to enter our dessert order at the end of the meal made this a very laughable experience.  My second visit was this past Friday evening. The pizza was good, drinks pretty weak, and again, the service very slow. 25 minutes from the time we ordered a cobbler dessert to having at the table is pretty bad. I agree with most people who say the service is spotty. I understand this is a chain restaurant that meets the needs of their customers and have several friends who rave about the food. Just not my thing...especially when I'm used to being in restaurants with great service and attentive servers."
Jennifer L.,"Beaumont, TX",23,82,20,4.0,4/1/2012,"LOVE the deep dish pizza! It was delicious! The wait was a little long, but it was definitely worth it!"
Samantha D.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,9,8,4.0,6/17/2012,I like the bar here. Pretty decent beer selections and the food is great. Good place to come and have a great beer and a snack. My husband and I have a couple of belgian ales with some wonderful appetizers for under $40.
Crystal P.,"Webster, TX",70,12,2,4.0,8/11/2009,"My husband and I ate here last week on Thursday night and it was wonderful!! I have eaten here on many occasions, but he had never been. There was no wait. We sat in the bar in a nice cushy booth, and the service was great!!  The beer here is very tasty! He had a Tatonka and a Piranha and I had 2 berry burst ciders (so delicious and my favorite!!!).  For dinner he had Parmesan crusted chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes...yum!!! I had the shrimp tacos that were to die for!!! We didn't have dessert, but the pizookies are to die for!!! Who can resist a warm, giant cookie with ice cream?!?! It is a little pricey at night so make sure to bring your piggy bank. This is one of my favorite places for lunch, dinner, or happy hour!"
Dennis B.,"League City, TX",0,3,,2.0,11/10/2013,2 1/2 hrs from when we walked in to leaving!  Not impressed with the wait!  Food was good but our waiter Leroy was forgetful and slow!  They need more wait staff or cooks
