Gretchen P.,"Houston, TX",226,761,294,4.0,1/2/2009,"I'm not certain how packed this place can be on a normal night, but at 8pm on NYE, there was not an empty seat in the restaurant.  My friends smartly made a beeline for the bar area.  No wait, we had a nice big bar table with stools (with backs) for ourselves, and the choice of watching the Rockets game on one of three flat screen TVs.  Just be forewarned, this is also a smoking section.  There are tall Plexiglas dividers, but they can keep out just so much smoke from the rest of the restaurant. I had the Artichoke and Spinach Pizza.  It was great, no Star Pizza, but really great.  They were deep dish with cheese cooked over the sides in areas.  The one thing I didn't like were the tomatoes.  They were fresh, but I just don't like fresh, cooked tomatoes on pizza.  Sauce is fine, fresh and cooked is weird and a bit too watery for my liking. This is a chain and I HAVE eaten at the one in Boulder.  They look completely different.  The one in Boulder has a college football team spirit/wooden furniture/ski lodge vibe to it.  It's in a strip mall and is very small.  This one is gigantic with lots of booths and a smoking section.  Both have gigantic kettles of their brew which are tapped for serving.  They're neat to look at.  I don't drink beer anymore, but it's nice to see the list of beers and their descriptions.   They have a full bar and wine list.  The wine is great, but average and a little on the pricey side.   If you're in the area, I'd recommend BJs...a friend of mine warns, however, stay away from the pasta."
Joe P.,"San Marcos, TX",58,4,,3.0,3/22/2014,"The food was GREAT......when it finally came out. They also didn't get my order right then proceeded to charge me for a more expensive burger than the one I ordered. There were 5 of us, but we were only given 2 silverware rolls. The food was awesome, the service...not so much."
Heather B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",124,200,33,3.0,10/19/2011,"First time I went I was CRAZY about it. This time, it was just ""alright"".  I don't know if it was because of the location or what, but it just wasn't as good. The service left a lot to be desired to."
Ashley M.,"Houston, TX",8,17,,5.0,2/1/2014,Love BJ's!  Cannot go wrong with a deep dish sweet pig pizza.  We have always had excellent service and the wait time for a table for 2 usually is pretty short.
Eating D.,"League City, TX",1,74,1,1.0,2/13/2013,"Three times over the past five years I have had the misfortune of being invited to BJ's Brewhouse for lunch or dinner. Three times over the past five years I have been disappointed with my visit. 2 times I have been cursed at by the staff including the manager. You have so many better options than to give this corporate cookie cutter outfit your money, and you should use those options. AVOID BJ'S BREWERY AT ALL COSTS!!!!!"
Sam S.,"Vero Beach, FL",18,95,90,3.0,10/2/2011,"An above average family restaurant , you can take your time here and be taken care of , not rushed . The food is diverse , something for everyone.  Save room for desert the cookie thing is awesome !"
Alexander T.,"Houston, TX",70,523,207,3.0,7/23/2008,"Came here on a Wednesday Night, the place was pretty packed for a week night. We went to the bar area, and our waitress was very nice in recommending beer.  Happy Hour is from 3 PM - 7 PM and 9 - 11 PM which is sort of awesome, appetizers are 2$ off, mini pizzas are 1/2 off, and beers are 1$ off.  we had an amazing berry cider, which tasted like juice but apparently it had 4% alcohol. then i proceeded to order another ale, hated it, and my companion asked if i could switch the beer out,  and the waitress did it without questions.  service was definitely amazing, mini pizza (artichoke) was actually really good!  I will now go to the BJs in willowbrook tomorrow."
Dave E.,"Lakewood, CO",100,140,48,2.0,3/29/2008,I wasn't very thrilled with this place.  With so much competition in the area you'd imagine the wait staff and bartenders would be overly fast and courteous to make sure they stay ahead of the pack.... hmmm... well not BJ's.   I sat at a small table in the bar area where I was only surrounded by a few other hungry peeps.  The bartender and waitress was taking orders and serving.  I'll just quickly list what peeved me off: -It took between 5-10 minutes for anyone to even take my drink order. -Burger and fries took about 45 minutes to come out.  It probably sat under the warmer for half that time. -I tried to get beer refills but couldn't get the attention of the bartender who was at the table next to me chatting it up with her friends and when I did get her attention she said she'd get it in a second but continued to chat it up for about another 5 minutes.  What nerve... -The 12 dollar burger wasn't worth the wait or money. The pros: Well pretty much nothing other than the bartender was blonde and hot.  :P  Not enough to make me come back.
Marlon C.,"Houston, TX",169,22,4,3.0,5/6/2010,"Its BJ's, if you've been to one you've been to them all, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I've been to many across the country and they're all solid places. They have their own beer, my favs the  Nutty Brunette. They don't brew it themselves (St Arnold makes it in Houston),  but that doesn't make it any less good. This place has the standard Friday night happy hour cheap drinks half off appetizers. It gets crowded on Fridays especially if there's a game on. If you're not a fan of the ""Sports Balls"" (baseball, basketball, football, its all just sports balls to me) i suggest you try to sit on the patio if its open."
Dani L.,"Houston, TX",27,59,,3.0,5/28/2008,"While they are a ""brewery"", they don't brew beer onsite.  So, points off for that.  (The beer is brewed at St. Arnold's just for BJ's.)  It's also kind of like a Bennigan's inside but bigger and more open.  The menu is just as long and diverse.  The only thing that really turned me off was the blaring of the terrifically bad 80's music. On the weekends, there will be a wait.  (What did you expect?  It's OTL and people OTL have nothing better to do on a Saturday night than eat out.) The waitress was so very nice and she was honest about her take on the brews.  I might go back and sample some of the other flavors but if my socks aren't knocked off at that visit, I won't be driving an hour each way for dinner again. Overall, if you are in the area, try it.  But, I don't think I'd make a a special trip out there just for this place,"
scott r.,"Portland, ME",0,2,,4.0,11/21/2013,"Food was good and service was good at bar. I had boneless wings and fish and chips. The food was good for bar food, and the bar staff were friendly and seem to be on the ball. I was traveling for work, and this was a great place walking distance from my hotel."
Lindsey J.,"Houston, TX",271,155,10,3.0,11/29/2010,"I love coming to this place with a group of friends. They have extra-large booths to fit everyone and the service has always been good. Their pizzas are all yummy and the pizookie is a must have. The unique in-house brewed beers aren't too bad (my personal fave is the hefenweizen). The newest thing they are offering, which I think is a great idea, are personal sized appetizers. Basically it's an appetizer specially portioned for one person so everyone can order whatever they want! Genius!"
Cory O.,"Houston, TX",445,766,20,4.0,12/6/2007,"Yeah, this is a chain, but it is also a brewhouse so I'm willing to forgive them.  I'd driven by every Tuesday and Thursday for a whole semester and drooled at the thought of a good microbrew so we finally went in.  It was packed.  Granted, Clear Lake only has so many options before you have just resign yourself to driving into Houston, so I guess I should've expected it.  There was a 45 minute wait for two people, so we headed straight to the bar and seated ourselves. My hefeweizen  was okay, though not a true hef.  It was more like a white ale (think Blue Moon), but I was fine with it.  My hubby likes red beers and my sip confirmed that I still don't like anything but wheat beers. We ordered a pizza and I was shocked at how good it was.  The hubby wasn't even hungry, but he ended up eating half of it anyway and we didn't leave any crumbs on the plate--it was that good.   Our waitress was quick and efficient.  The whole process had us in and out in less than an hour which is exactly what we had in mind.  I suppose as long as you don't go during their busy time, you'll be able to grab a table and enjoy your meal though there's plenty of room in the bar area.  I'm sure I'll be heading over there some more next semester."
Bobbi B.,"Webster, TX",198,233,87,4.0,7/29/2007,"I really like this place but the service is very slow in particular a dark headed waitress that has been there since opening that we almost always manage to get.  I think she has attention disorder, but its awful when your in a rush for lunch.  She gets upset when you complain or ask for help after politely waiting 30 mins or so for her to return with silverware. Anyway, dont get her run.  But the food is great.  I love the Avacodo rolls, a bit wierd at first but you will ask for them again, The appetizer pizza sausage is great !  Sliders, and main dishers are wonderful. And they have homemade beer and a sportsbar for those interested."
Caroline L.,"Friendswood, TX",0,13,5,2.0,7/5/2012,Tried to give them chances..been there 2 times & tried going today for a 3rd try. Nothing spectacular about the food or service.  Today walked in for lunch @ 1pm.  They had NO WAIT STAFF for tables only booths! Had to leave since a booth couldn't accommodate a high chair & didn't want to risk bad service if they didn't even have tables covered! Was meeting friends up there...we all ended up walking next door to Jason's Deli which turned out to be better choice.
Sandra V.,"Houston, TX",2,86,,2.0,2/24/2010,Went yesterday with some friends.  Been a while since I've last been here because of the bad service.   I split some Thai chicken wraps with a friend.   Nothing special.   I ordered a hamburger which  again was nothing special.  A hamburger from Fuddrucker's is better IMO. The fries were overly salted/seasoned to the point where I couldn't eat them.   The prices were a little more than they should have been given the quality of the food.
Morgan A.,"Victoria, TX",64,2,,5.0,6/24/2009,"My husband and our family visited here on a recent trip for work and i have to say the food was amazing we split a cheese burger pizza. We also tried some of their beer my husband ordered the berry cider and i got a blonde beer we ended up switching and both were very satisfied. The berry cider has a fruity wine cooler taste which i really enjoyed. The service was just awesome our server did a great job of helping us pick out our drinks, entree, and dessert. Way to go chris! The chocolate chip bazookie was delicious! It was a bit loud in the restraunt but it wasnt enough to knock off any stars. Overall i'd recommend this place to everyone for any occasion a night with the girls or family pizza night."
Brian B.,"Houston, TX",3,43,,4.0,3/19/2012,"My 4 year old's favorite restaurant, surprisingly. She (and I) love the pizza, it's always fun to hear her specify ""cheese only"" to the waitstaff who are always friendly. Drinks are good as you'd expect at a place like this, my wife loves their Mojitos while I like sampling different beers. Other favorites are the Jambalaya, Meatloaf, shredded pork sandwiches, onion strings, and thin cut fries. Nice relaxing place though there is often a wait. Big round booths are perfect for corralling kids without making them feel closed in."
Paul O.,"Houston, TX",0,46,1,4.0,2/27/2012,Great burgers @ service.  Try the southwest or avocado egg rolls.  They are delish!
L E.,"Dickinson, TX",16,53,25,4.0,5/14/2011,Great service and food. I had chicken a la fresca. It's a new dish and wonderful. Can't wait to go back.
