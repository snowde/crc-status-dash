Amber L.,"Houston, TX",0,5,1,1.0,8/9/2017,"We were at the restaurant for three hours. Waited for 30 minutes for our table even though the place was a third full. It took 30 minutes for the waiter to come and took the order, `15 minutes later the water and drink arrived. 40 minutes after we finished our meal the waiter came and took the desert order, took 15 minutes for our desert to arrive. 30 minutes later , the waiter finally showed up and refilled our drink and gave us the check. He never refilled our drink until the last minute, gave us a sweet smile and a sincere apology, I suppose expecting a good tip for non-service.  Food is mediocre to the best.  The people at the tables next to us waited longer for their food.  They were there before we arrived and were still there when we left.  If you have small children, do not go, they would not last that long. The place was not packed, so why? Wasted a whole night, will not return."

Nika B.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",88,42,68,5.0,6/29/2016,Good happy hour. Fast service. My server Michael was excellent and great. Will definitely go back.
Sirisha I.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,43,23,5.0,6/25/2016,"This place is very good. Nice vibe, good beer , tasty food. Mainly Preston D make us feel us like VIP's. He is very polite and took food orders great and came in order. This place is very decent for families and group as well. Would recommend to go to this place for sure."
Courtney B.,"Cypress, TX",163,35,15,1.0,9/30/2016,Have never been treated so poorly in my life. I have never had an issue at any other BJ Brewhouse but will NEVER return to this location.
Richard W.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,2.0,1/16/2017,"I've been going to this BJ's restaurant since they opened several years ago.  Today, I was very disappointed.  The service was slow, primarily due to a waitress who traveled between the kitchen and the tables with one task at a time.  My meal was piping hot, but my wife's was stone cold.  The restaurant itself was cold, like sitting in a refrigerator. I tried a new item on the menu and, while tasty, the portion was more like an appetizer as opposed to a main course. I don't think I'll return to this restaurant."
Julie J.,"Houston, TX",340,258,123,4.0,3/13/2014,"It's a chain, but a pretty good one! The avocado egg rolls grow on you, warm and delicious, mix of avocado and cream cheese. Yummmmm. Order them! Jalapeño burger was so so. Not amazing. Grilled shrimp tacos were awesome! Cooked well, great flavor, side salsa and guacamole cream. I really loved these and would stop in to order them again. It's always busy, tons of seating, TVs everywhere (for better or worse, depending on your company). The servers are always really friendly. The pazookie thing (huge cookie) for dessert is monstrous. I wanted to like it more than I did, but it was still yummy. Because really, when is a warm cookie not yummy?"
Hema K.,"Manhattan, NY",56,59,119,4.0,2/17/2015,"Great service, big portions, and delicious drinks! A solid dinner during my brief trip to the Houston area. I had the crispy jalapeño burger with a veggie patty and was very pleased (veggie burgers can be really hit or miss). The fried jalapeños on top were definitely the highlight of the burger -- I could not get enough of them. The potato wedges on the side were also well cooked. Beware: the portion sizes are huge!! Everything really is bigger in Texas; I couldn't finish. Make sure you save room for dessert. The pizookies are HEAVENLY. One pizookie is a good size for two people so get ready to share. So many great flavors to choose from! Wonderful service throughout the night and a fun sports bar atmosphere."
Lanha T.,"Houston, TX",71,328,391,3.0,6/17/2015,"Popped in for lunch waiting for tropical storm bill to hit. Overwhelming menu. Felt bad the waitress kept asking if we were ready to order but if you have 120 items with description to each, it's going to take some time to decide. A good reason to come here is the fact there is so much variety. In house brewed beer but opted for a shiner bock. Ordered the Santa Fe Spring Rolls thinking they were like the Chili's southwestern egg rolls. Nope, not at all alike. These are smaller in size, good, but not what I expected. I think there's 10 halves to an order. Also had the lunch Southern Fried Chicken. It's one breaded chicken breast over a heap of mashed potatoes surrounded by corn with cream gravy on top. Good portion, left satisfied. It's a perfect place for a group that can't decide where to eat."
Monica F.,"League City, TX",1200,452,751,3.0,12/7/2014,"I really like BJ's ... as they have lots of good options for lunch and this is in fact, a hot spot for many a business luncheon. I really don't get anything other than the salmon, as I like to try and keep it healthy!  I have sat at the bar and only had drinks here, and I will tell you that their dirty martinis will knock you off your bar stool if you drink too many!!"
Mia S.,"San Marcos, TX",119,17,,4.0,10/26/2016,"Excellent food. Can't go wrong here, everything's good and the menu is so diverse that there's sure to be something for everyone. Favorites are definitely the parmesan crusted chicken and the chicken strips. Make sure to save room for a pizookie. Tip: if you're not super big on desert they have kids sized aka ""mini"" pizookies which are about the size of a saucer and half the price of a regular one."
Hilary S.,"League City, TX",103,54,20,5.0,8/14/2016,"I always love this place when I visit, but recently was the first time I visited this location in League city. I had the quinoa bowl with roasted chicken. I was so jealous when my friends deep dish pizza arrived thinking mine was going to be bland, but when my meal showed up, it was absolutely superb. There is so much flavor in that bowl, and the chicken is some of the best I've had in a restaurant. Love this place as always."
JaLynn P.,"League City, TX",50,45,,3.0,6/24/2016,"The food is consistently good, but the service can be sloppy and slow if you are not in the bar area. The last server we had couldn't be bothered to refill drinks and left for an extended 30 minute smoke break. She wasn't even the person to deliver our entrées. After she returned to check on our meals, I asked for a box. She returned with one but then picked up both of our plates without thinking and placed my husband's on top of mine. I had over half of my meal remaining to take home that was then ruined. She attempted a weak apology but did not offer to replace anything. Disappointing, to say the least."
Julie H.,"Dickinson, TX",7,2,1,1.0,5/7/2016,"Been here many times and enjoyed it, but tonight was AWFUL. Came here for an early Mother's Day dinner with family and was SO disappointed. 1st- called ahead and still had to wait even though it was dead. 2nd- hostess tried to sit 4 adults and 3 kids in a booth.  Seriously?! Had to wait again for them to get a table together. Ordered apps, Fried Mozzarella and Calamari. Calamari came out over cooked and rubbery.  Entrees were the only redeemable part of the evening. Everything came out fine other than the drink I ordered when the meal came and didn't see for 10 min. Ordered Pizzokie Trio for dessert. Took about 20 minutes to get to table. Not sure if the entire staff was off its game tonight or what, but terrible experience. Dinner= Fail."
Krista R.,"Houston, TX",0,34,1,5.0,3/25/2017,This is our go to place. They always have an open table so the wait is usually pretty quick. Our server is always really nice and quick with refills and such. The pizza is my favorite and the chicken is very good too. Pizookie!!!!!!!
Brittany B.,"League City, TX",569,141,285,4.0,7/20/2014,"I really like this place for all of the selections, and I think they do a pretty good job at it for having so many different food types.  TONS of alcohol, I hear it's good :)"
Becky A.,"Houston, TX",172,7,1,2.0,6/2/2017,"My partner decided that we to go to BJs instead of Saltgrass. I have BJ Reward card because I use to go to BJs all the time, but lately the food quality at the Clear Lake Restaurant has been poor. I was very disappointed this time. I ordered rib eye sandwich dip and after pulling off a huge chunk of fat, there was hardly any meat left. The Aus Jus was so salty, I ate the sandwich without the dip. My salad had rotten tomatoes and some of the lettuce was rotten. Ranch dressing was terrible. We received our meal order before our two appetizers so we decided to cancel the appetizers. They brought both appetizers anyways and said they would charge us for only one. My first strawberry lemonaide was watered down, but my second one was perfect. My partner did not complain about her meal and ate all the sushi mahi tuna appetizer, but she hated the Tumeric roasted cauliflower. I use to get the tomato mozzarella basil salad all the time until I received one with decomposed mozzarella. I love their lunch menu but not their dinner menu."
Janice M.,"Seabrook, TX",181,207,203,3.0,5/1/2013,"BJ's is a good place to come if you've got alot of picky eaters to please.  Their menu size is on par with a grocery store romance novel, or cheesecake factory menu. Their pizza is deep-dish style: very doughy and usually very light on the sauce.  I prefer thin-crust pizza, so I usually go for one of their flatbread appetizer pizzas as my meal.  They run about $10.  I've had the roasted veggie and goat cheese and the California BLT-style one.  The goat cheese and veggie was better, but both were very light on toppings.  there were maybe about 8 tiny chunks of avocado on my BLT pizza.  very disappointing. The best things about BJ's are their in-house microbrew beers, which are pretty good, and their p'zookies--a cookie baked in a mini pizza pan and topped with ice cream.  really, that's all I come here for.  all of the other food is kind of meh. and the prices are always surprisingly high....we got the appetizer flat bread pizza, a chicken marsala, a p'zookie and split an app of spinach artichoke dip...and the bill was $38!  Not a great value, especially considering our meals didn't come with soup or salad."
Sabrina F.,"Montreal, Canada",84,166,569,3.0,7/30/2015,"It's not my favorite place to go to but it's the only one that's open past 10:00 pm in this area. The staff has been friendly & courteous.  The spinach & artichote appetizer is good & my spouse likes the sliders, the rest are overpriced. The gourmet mac and cheese is enough to share for 2 but it's heavy. The golden beet & arugula salad is light & refreshing. The only mains worth mentioning is the mahi mahi tacos, the California chicken club, soup bowls & the pizza. The pizookies are very tasty.  I'm not a beer fan, I have recently tried the berry burst cider & really loved it. Overall, for the money you'll spend here, you can get a much better meal that will cost you half the price somewhere else in the neighbourhood."
R M.,"Chicago, IL",0,25,4,2.0,6/11/2015,"This is my 3rd time at this location. I thought the first two times were a fluke or just new servers but after 3 times, that's a bigger issue.  Two stars because I love the food. I will return to BJ's just not this one Service is SLOW. I went after work with my 3 year old to eat at 5 before her recital at 7. I left at 6:50 still only having water. I informed the server and manager and they shrugged.  I went for lunch with a group of 4. Very basic orders (burgers, quesadilla, etc). Our server barely made eye contact with us. For me specifically she asked me 3 times, ""oh I didn't see you come in, what can I get you?"" What? I'm literally eating the food you brought me....  I get that it's a bad day but again to see the servers all chatting by the computer while tables all around are searching for their waitress.  On the last 3 occasions - water takes 10 minutes, drinks take 15 (non alcoholic) and food.... Let's just say, make a day of it. And don't think the manager will care if you complain.  This same story 3 times in a row. Seems simple but with so many great options for food, their cookie ice cream dessert thingy doesn't make up for the terrible and slow service"
