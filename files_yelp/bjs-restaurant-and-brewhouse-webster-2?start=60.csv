Mike S.,"Webster, TX",64,63,219,3.0,9/13/2015,Bj's has a very large and diverse menu. Pizzas have been good along with the burgers. You can find just about anything u want here.  Beer selection is large. I love the home brewed root beer which comes with Unlimited refills.  They also have a Large selection of small bite  appetizers. Anything from Mac and cheese to flat breads to pot stickers.  They have a really good deep dish pizza also.
Max Q.,"Houston, TX",0,42,,2.0,4/22/2017,"I used to eat lunch here once a week or so, but have finally given up on it due to the ever decreasing quality of service and the customers they allow in.  The last 3 times I've been in, I ate at the bar. Each time had the same annoying barfly who just can't shut up, asking personal questions and more.  Even politely telling him that I just came in for a beer and some lunch isn't enough to shut him up.  The female bartender each time has commented that he's talkative, but does nothing to dissuade him, even after a group of 4 got up and told her they were leaving and to cancel their order due to his incessant comments and questions.  Burgers are good, fries are horrid, beer is good, but usually barely cooler then room temp.  They have good prices on daily specials, but you have to be sure and tell the server/bartender about the special, as they typically continue to charge full prices until you point them to the clear language and special prices on the ridiculously lengthy (and greasy) menu.  My last visit, I decided to just leave because the barfly showed up and once again launched into his incessant commentary and quesions.  For my $7.25 bill, I handed the bartender a $20.  She asked if I wanted change.  Duh... needless to say she got no tip."
Ken H.,"Houston, TX",38,231,1177,3.0,5/13/2014,"We went here once a week for a couple or three months when it first opened.  The manager then was terrific, but he soon left to open another location in Houston.  We've never found much we particularly enjoyed here except the Avocado Egg Rolls which are really good.  They also make a good burger, but so do other places without the falderal.   It's okay, but we rarely come here anymore.The service is spotty and the kitchen is slow. There hasn't been an occasion for it to come up in recent years so maybe this had been fixed, but they used to have a very rigid seating system.  If you didn't want to sit where they dictated it became a BIG deal and sometimes they refused to let you choose a location of your preference until you asked for the manager.  Edited 7/18/14 to add: On our trip tonight we did their corn fritter appetizer and the Roast Beef Dip.  You have to look carefully to find any corn in the corn fritters.  The roast beef dip was good but not exceptional.  The horseradish needed some zip.  If they hadn't said it was horseradish I would have thought it was cream sauce.   Added on 2/24/2016: We haven't been here since the last update in 2014,  We had the avocado egg rolls.  They're still good and I had my weekly martini which is a little pricey here, $7.50 I think and not generous.  Oh yes, they don't brew any beer here.  I know, I know, it's called a brewhouse but  those giant tanks are just ornaments.  Added on 6/24/2017: Back again.  My martini is still to expensive and skimpy.  You can see we come here regularly -- about once a year.  Tonight it was a good experience.  Our waiter had a trainee and both were pleasant and responsive.  With some trepidation we ordered the DEEP DISH ZITI.  It turned out to be excellent.  And we had their salted caramel Pizookie.  O my god, best thing short of an orgasm. I'm thinking of going here once a week and just ordering three of them.   If I had all I could eat of them I would eat myself into a coma.   ___ We've Eaten Out Every Meal for 30 years"
Kate L.,"Houston, TX",0,9,6,1.0,5/30/2015,"Nope. Just nope. Have been to BJ's in ATX and always had great experiences. This place, well - I won't ever go back. It was really that bad.  Yep. It was. Just don't do it."
Lauren A.,"Houston, TX",111,163,381,5.0,4/1/2016,"I've been a regular at BJ's for years and I'll continue to keep visiting! The beer is always cold and the food is always hot. My only complaint is the large menu! There are so many options and it can be hard to make a decision on food! Julie is my go to waitress during daytime visits as she provides the best customer service and is very attentive! We tend to usually order several appetizers to eat and I always stick with their IPA, the Piranha. The wedge salad is delicious, the flatbreads & wings are always great options too. But there is no way to pass on the poozkie! Today they offered a monkey bread poozkie and IT WAS AMAZING! I hope to see this item remain on the menu! I will also recommend arriving early or sending someone ahead for large parties on the weekends, but BJ's has always been good at accommodating large groups! As always, recommend BJ's for their cold beers, good food and casual atmosphere!"
Randy C.,"League City, TX",93,3,1,5.0,12/5/2015,Love this place can't get enough of the great food and beers. Jeremiah Reds beer is awesome. Shrimp jumbaliya is my favorite but it's a little warm. Try the rack of ribs yummmy. Get their mobil app too and add up points for free stuff. Ya.
Heather S.,"Clear Lake, Houston, TX",31,24,60,4.0,4/29/2015,"Edited to give a star: the chicken pitas on the enlightened menus is amazing!!! Super sad they got rid of the pizza dip though  We've visited this location off and on throughout the years. It's never been a first choice for us, but it is pretty good. The price is a bit high for the quality of the food, but it's a nicer establishment so I guess you can at least feel fancy as you dine on your sufficient meal. We really enjoy the fish tacos and the new pepperoni dip is actually really tasty! The pizza is okay, but we're not really deep dish fans. My 8 year old loved the kids meal cheese pizza though. My 6 year old really enjoys the fruit that comes with her entree, but has yet to find an entree she enjoys.  We keep going back because my husband keeps getting b1g1 free entree coupons in his email. Next time I think I'll try something different and will hopefully update my review with the results"
Melanie H.,"Houston, TX",243,452,600,3.0,3/22/2014,"BJ's is a suburbanite's paradise. It's big, crowded, loud, and the menu has a myriad of options. If you've never been to a BJ's, it's kind of like a cross between a Chili's and a Cheesecake Factory. Instead of cheesecake, they have beer. And lots of other alcohol - wine, sangria, mojitos, martinis, etc.  The food is pretty good. I like their lighter menu. My favorite item is the mahi or shrimp tacos, which you can get grilled or fried and they come with chips and salsa. Pretty good and under 1,000 calories (most things on the menu ARE NOT).  They're known for the pazookie (sp?) which is a warm cookie and ice cream and which is, of course, amazing.  Overall, I like BJ's well enough. Not on a weekly basis or anything, but once every few months is fine. It's affordable enough and good if you're looking for a place with a lot of American-food variety. (And you don't mind large crowds of suburbanites). :)"
Peggy E.,"San Antonio, TX",59,47,23,1.0,1/24/2014,"Today was my third time to eat here. Each and every time I've eaten here, the food was not up to par. I have food allergies. Not like *no onions on my burger, but I want onion rings* allergies. It's bad enough that I made up little cards to give to servers so that I don't have to drone on about how I don't have my epi pen and how expensive it is to have to go to the ER. blah, blah, blah... Today, my server cleared my salad with the chef who recommended that I change the salad dressing. OK, sure...why not? Out comes my salad, and guess what's sprinkled all over it as a garnish? Yep, one of my allergens. And it didn't even have any dressing on it!  My second visit, the waitress put in our order wrong. When we told her that we didn't order it, she did not correct the mistake, left it there like *eat it or don't eat at all* AND overcharged us.  My first visit was much like today in that the order went to the kitchen as 86 my allergen. Guess what I find when I take my to go order home? Yep.  Something's up. Either I'm becoming a paranoid crack head and BJ's is out to get me personally, or the restaurant doesn't care about their customers. Run for the hills on this one! Or just go next door to Outback or Jason's deli. Never again, BJ's, never again."
Michelle S.,"Houston, TX",109,145,24,2.0,1/9/2015,"Very crowded for a Friday night. Long but accurate wait time. Atmosphere wasn't too bad. Took the staffs recommendation for an appetizer and beer selection, both came back subpar.  Definitely do not recommend the loaded french fries or the harvest hefeweizen which had a banana after taste.  My friend had the salmon entree and he really enjoyed it. I unfortunately didn't have the same experience with the black and blue dry burger. I was surprisingly pleased by the offering of a caprese salad, which was tasty.  With so many options around, will not be back for awhile."
Tara S.,"Alvin, TX",47,8,,5.0,11/21/2016,"The best pizza ever! I came here for a team meeting and it was literally delicious. They also brew their own beer, can't beat that."
Demetria C.,"Texas City, TX",29,137,654,3.0,3/23/2015,"Late night dinner I ordered chicken fried chicken which was nice and tender and the gravy was flavorful ,but my corn was having a off night didn't taste to good but my mash potatoes were good after I found them under my chicken, wish they would have hid the corn instead California Burger was nice size enough for now/later with choice of fries which is nice option. Ordered strawberry mojito which was nice once I steered it , but overall it was late and we ate"
Mariel N.,"Houston, TX",69,14,1,5.0,2/21/2016,"Received great service. I initially ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken because it looked savory in the menu's picture but when it came out it was not what I expected. It was not on them, I just personally didn't like all the different spices. The server was really friendly and nicely offered to bring me something else. I then ordered the Chicken Alfredo Pasta and it was delicious! Don't forget to order your Pazooki for dessert! Best thing ever."
Greg W.,"Houston, TX",9,186,151,2.0,1/11/2015,"It was my 1st time ordering & I ordered a large cheese pizza. Big mistake! As u can see from the picture, it was more like a large piece of dough. The sauce was non existent & there was almost zero cheese!  They have a large menu selection & I've heard that they have some amazing dishes. I'll go back, but not for the pizza. The manager, Chris, is great. I called to complain about the pizza - he apologized, sent me a gift card & refunded my money. Great customer service....I will go back & try something different. ROUND 2:  so I recently went back & ordered their Mac & Cheese & a Sirloin Steak w a Caesar Salad.  Result: plan, boring tasteless food! The M&C was blan & had bacon in it. The steak was $20+ & not worth it. The Caesar was dull!  I'm not going back. The food is terrible."
Arturo R.,"South Belt/Ellington, Houston, TX",46,8,9,3.0,6/13/2015,Food was pretty tasty. The service was ok. Not exceptional but I can see how if you don't keep the waiter in check they will get away from you. I read a lot about the avocado egg rolls and tried them. They were good the sauce was great but they were pretty mushy and once cold not appetizing.  My biggest complaint was I ordered two Red Buffalos one was perfect but the second was totally wrong. The waiter asked if I had a problem with it and I said I didn't think it was a Red Buffalo. He took it back to the bar and the bar tender claimed it was a Red Buffalo and that it was just cloudy.  Now I have been drinking Back and Tans for many years and various Black and something combinations. The beer they brought me just didn't measure up. So after letting it settle for several minutes it still didn't look right and the taste was definitely WRONG. I finally sent it back and the manager got involved although he and the bar tender maintained it was a Red Buffalo. Claiming it was due to a barrel change.  I'm sorry it can't be true. I changed my order to a Dark Castle and it was perfect. Needless to say I will probably be back. But if your into beer as I am and that's the reason I wanted to try this place. Don't let them try to pull the proverbial wool over your eyes and serve you something you didn't order. Especially since we ordered Hefeweizen but got a Blonde.
Mark F.,"Austin, TX",1,90,,2.0,3/10/2015,"Service was a zero. The two stars are only because the food was decent.  Our family of 5 waited 20 minutes for a table Monday evening. Drinks at the bar were fine.  Seated then ordered an app and our entrees. Finished our bar drinks shortly after that. Watched our waitress stand by the side exit door at a register with 2 other staff for the next 12-13 minutes. I walked to her and asked for our app and another round of drinks. She nodded and said ok but didn't budge. I went to the bar for drinks for our table. Returned with the drinks and waited a few more minutes then all food arrived. Obviously, the app was old and pretty much a leftover now.  The waitress checked by once near the end of the meal. Several of us were done. Plenty of dishes ready to go away. No action. By the time all of us were done, we sat for 10-15 more minutes with a table full of dishes and glasses. No action. As soon as the table next to us was bussed down, I stood and moved all our stuff to that table. Thought someone might get the hint. Nope.  Waitress eventually came around and offered dessert and the check. I think our host left $5 tip with a note that the service was awful.  I hope this was our waitress' first day and the manager and training staff were out with the flu. There's no other reason to be left in the breeze like we were.  The pizza and burger and tacos and steak were generally ok. No complaints on the entrees but it'll be a long time, if ever again, that we choose BJs to eat and drink."
Jenna T.,"Houston, TX",0,8,1,4.0,3/18/2015,"My husband and I enjoy going to BJs for a casual lunch or night out. They have an extensive menu. My husband loves to get their pepperoni extreme pizza. I'm not a fan of it(I prefer NY pizza), but he says it is great.  I have a couple of favorites: Mahi Mahi tacos and the Parmesan crusted chicken.  The fish tacos are SO flavorful. I get the fish grilled and it is flaky with great taste. The meal comes with chips and salsa, but I don't even care about that since the tacos are so good. The chicken is to die for! You get two thin cut breasts with excellent breading. They top it with sun dried tomatoes and basil plus this lemon cream sauce that you'll want to drink, it is so good! The chicken comes with broccoli and white cheddar mashed potatoes. This meal may not be low carb, but it is worth it. There is enough food that I always end up taking some home for later. Another favorite is the fish and chips. The fish is not overly greasy and they always cook it just right. Also, if you ask, they will bring you malt vinegar.  I am not a beer drinker, but I love their house-made root beer. It rivals the root beer Tom Wahl's makes in my hometown in NY. My husband is a beer drinker and loves their Jeremiah Red (I think that's what it's called). When we went their the first time, they brought him samples so that he could decide before ordering."
Danna G.,"Houston, TX",489,153,194,3.0,11/4/2013,"Pretty darn good.  Great happy hour specials, from drinks to appetizers. Bartender/Bar Service was AWESOME!  Not a fan of the pasta dish.."
Lenora G.,"Dickinson, TX",211,3,7,2.0,3/9/2015,"One star for idk a polite server but in my eyes that's generous being that he never offered a drink refill and asked if I wanted him to box my leftovers AFTER he set container down in front of me. Really.  One more star for gourmet Mac'n cheese we shared as appetizer- that was perfection, however my $15 pizza came to me room temp and drier than a pan full of graham cracker crumbs. Terrible. Had we not ordered the Mac I'd have surely sent it back.  Overall I was probably hyperaware of these faults for being irritated by the size of the table for two, which wasn't a big deal until the entrees came."
Dana S.,"League City, TX",0,2,,5.0,3/14/2016,"This is my second time eating at BJ and you don't dissapoint, fresh, tasty and lots of variety for everyone :)"
