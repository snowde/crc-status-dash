Jaqueline T.,"Houston, TX",61,7,43,3.0,3/17/2015,Pizza wasn't bad but it didn't have enough sauce. The fries weren't crispy. Pizaookies are good though.
Song F.,"Houston, TX",3,24,,4.0,12/13/2015,I love BJ's! I just came here to review the deep dish pizza because it really wasn't deep dish pizza. It was more of just a regular pizza with thick crust. It was still yummy but I was kinda disappointed
Honey J.,"Galveston, TX",57,101,23,3.0,7/16/2014,"The food was pretty good here and the waiter was excellent. I ordered the Jambalaya but I wanted pasta instead of rice and had no problems with my picky requests.  The drinks are very good and strong! I've passed this place many times coming and going to UHCL, I'll definately be returning."
Leo W.,"Olivet, MI",0,5,3,4.0,4/12/2015,Busy sports bar type of place with very nice wood decor and ability to look at the brewing process while you enjoy a wonderful meal. I'd definitely go back and finish the rest of the beer list.
Michael D.,"Warrington, PA",5,38,,5.0,8/21/2016,"Kimberly and I went here 3 times while in Webster, TX. Great food and staff. Jerome was our first server. He was friendly,  attentive and we even got a free desert. This place was crowded, but we got a booth within the wait time they told us when we first checked in. We liked it so much we went back 2 more times. Big restaurant and they provide the staff and help to ensure great service. A huge menu to select from. I am in the military and took my girlfriend, Kimberly, there for lunch one day during my tdy. I was in uniform and when we went to pay for the bill we were told a customer had already picked up our tab for lunch. Kim asked our server who we should thank, but our server said they wanted to remain anonymous and had already left. We thanked her and told her to thank whoever it was if she sees them again. Hopefully the persons or persons reads Yelp. I did post this on Facebook.  My girlfriend, Kimberly was overwhelmed by this generosity,  and so was I. Now it is our turn to pay it forward."
Aaron F.,"Webster, TX",16,31,11,5.0,6/22/2015,So far so good! We visit every time I am in town. Their selection if house beers is great. Try the Jeremiah red and oasis amber. The food is excellent and I love that they offer lower calorie options.
Tina J.,"Houston, TX",18,26,4,4.0,11/7/2014,"This BJ's is great the majority of the time. Sometimes it take a few minutes to get seated.  We really like their lunch specials Monday - Friday. I love the individual 1 topping Pizza and Tortilla soup (substituted from salad). My husband says they have great hamburgers, but I haven't tried them becuase I love the Parmisaen Crusted Chicken and the Pizza so much."
Mychael H.,"Houston, TX",26,18,,4.0,11/8/2015,"This is a great place.  Typically I order the California Club with no avocado.  Their in house beer is pretty decent and the service is usually pretty good.  Also, wait staff is pretty nice looking if you're into that sorta thing."
Miranda T.,"Edgewater, MD",0,11,,4.0,6/16/2016,"The California Club was the best sandwich I've ever had!  The sirloin steak was also wonderful.  (Veg pasta, meh) Service very good; would definitely come back."
Julia T.,"League City, TX",0,14,16,3.0,8/27/2014,Some of the chips where stale but I love the salsa. I had the turkey bacon sandwich and that was good. My son had the pepperoni pizza and he said that it was good but greasy.
Marcia B.,"Pearland, TX",1,3,,2.0,8/16/2015,"This BJ's is hit and miss. Sometimes good food and service and other times, like this evening, it is a nightmare. Our service was incredibly slow. The waiter clearly didn't care at all about performing well. The restaurant wasn't full or particularly busy but it still took forty minutes to get out food. I decide to venture out and get the thin crust pizza. It tasted like a stale version of Dominos thin crust. A frozen pizza would have been better. The bad food coupled with inattentive waiter made our experience frustrating and sadly, not at all the enjoyable dinner we set out to have."
Christine L.,"Houston, TX",144,322,147,4.0,8/12/2012,"For a middle of the road restaurant chain, I rather enjoy you, BJ's, I really do. Seared Ahi salad, I applaud you. Not a single bite of scariness. Dressing was a bit on the heavy side, but vinegary goodness isn't hard to love for me. Tried a pizookie and LOVED it. Then discovered ONE pizookie has 1000+ calories. Just one. So yeah, think about it. I have no complaints myself, but I hear you can't make margaritas well. I watched a friend order 2 different kinds and didn't like either. I'll stick to the brews."
Dean H.,"Hurricane, UT",0,27,,5.0,12/1/2013,"BJ's BREWHOUSE A NICE SURPRISE! OK, so we picked BJ's Brewhouse, in Webster, TX, because we were desperate. We had just checked into our hotel across the street (Thursday, 11/14/13) after a twenty-three hour, two-day drive from Vegas, and we were famished.  The parking lot was packed so we figured ""Twenty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong.""  Right? Right!  BJ's proved a very pleasant surprise (it was our first time there).  No actual Frenchmen were spotted. We requested a seat as far from the madding crowds as possible, and were given a corner booth next to the kitchen, away from the giant TV screen on which droned some football game.  Perfect.  We couldn't escape the overall din of a packed house with TVs everywhere, but hunger drove us to examine the menu and ignore the din. Presently we were proffered drinks, and soon thereafter along came our very personable and capable waitress, Cheyenne.  We asked her advice on menu choices, asked several detailed questions, requested 2-3 alterations and additions, and Cheyenne was off to put in our order. I took her recommendation and ordered a pint of her personal favourite brewsky, the Jeremiah Red (light, a bit sweet, not overpowering), and followed it with the Angus burger melt on sourdough.  My wife went for the fried artichoke appetizer and a heaping bowl of chicken noodle comfort soup.  All dishes came out exactly as ordered, and tasted great. The ambiance was ""upscale brewhouse"" with leather booths ringing the room and tables scattered throughout.  The crowd was largely young and hip, with the exception of us two old farts in the corner. Yes, we'd go back again.  Yes, we'd ask for the delightful Cheyenne.  Yes, I'd have another Jeremiah Red.  No, we'd skip going on a Thursday night, if we could avoid it.  Gets a bit rowdy for our tastes.  Might be just right for yours.

L R.,"Houston, TX",24,33,22,2.0,10/24/2014,"I usually come here on Sunday evening, but came in the late afternoon. I ordered a cheeseburger (brew burger or something like that) and it was AWFUL.  The burger came dry, no mayo, mustard or sauce, the hamburger has what looked like a cheese tatoo--like it had been flipped to the cheese side on the griddle, and they forgot the bacon. Not sure what ""Medium"" means to the cook, but this thing was WELL done and completely flavorless.  The fries were the only good thing on my plate. The only redeeming factor and reason that I might return was the bartender's great service and tasty bloody mary."
Robert S.,"Webster, TX",0,6,,5.0,10/22/2014,"Once a week you can find me here. Food is good, above average. I usually get the nachos or avocado eggrolls. The beer is awesome. The ""Red"" is probably the best beer I've ever had. The first sip is like Nutella. And so very cold. I honestly crave their Red like food, and did I mention the first sip. Waitresses are always great, the place is clean, really nice to go somewhere different than the chains. Keep up the good work."
Lisa E.,"Deer Park, TX",39,27,1,5.0,4/21/2014,"Decided to try this restaurant on Friday night after seeing that they had an allergen-friendly menu available. We were a little ahead of the dinner rush, so we had no wait for a table,  Looking at the allergen menu, I was pleased to see that BJ's covered the entire menu, and accounted for all major food allergies. It didn't help me find a wide variety of safe foods however - gluten-and-dairy free foods - there were literally only 3 entree choices on the entire menu.  I opted for the sirloin steak, baked potato and asparagus (after being assured that neither the steak nor the asparagus were cooked in butter).  Our waiter went out of his way to ensure that my meal was prepared correctly, even bringing me some EVOO for my potato, so that it wouldn't be dry (it had bacon and chives as well)  No allergic reactions, so they apparently got it all right..we'll be back!"
Demi T.,"Papillion, NE",21,8,1,4.0,7/18/2015,"Bj's is my favorite restaurant in this area so far, it is a bit overpriced in my opinion but the food and drinks are good enough to overlook it."
Deborah C.,"Alvin, TX",19,17,,5.0,10/6/2015,"This is a favorite spot for me for lunch, dinner, watching a game, or family get togethers. I love the handcrafted beers and the seasonals. The harvest hefeweizen is my current favorite. My favorite salad is the twisted blt (minus the Bleu cheese). But the pizzas burgers and sandwiches are top notch. I've had the salmon. Steak and chicken entees (I substitute the starch for veggies) which are always cooked perfectly,  never mushy. Always a great choice for whatever you're doing."
Mandi F.,"Houston, TX",9,56,,4.0,1/13/2015,"I have enjoyed everything that I have gotten there. Only been maybe 3 or 4 times but I will be back to try more. Great soups, salmon, and appetizers"
Brian B.,"North Platte, NE",1,20,116,3.0,7/7/2015,"Food was good however the breading on both the chicken fried steak & Chicken strips was way too heavy. The two drinks were way over priced for what was delivered. Sorry BJ, was not impressed this trip"
