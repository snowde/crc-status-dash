Ray R.,"Claremont, CA",0,3,2,5.0,12/7/2017,"Emy was GREAT and I mean GREAT! She was attentive, knowledgeable and genuine!  You know when you go to some places and they're trying to rush you out and don't care?  She knew the menu and provided the best service and food I've had in a while. She shared with us how she began as a dishwasher and worked her way up! What a impressive girl! Check this place out! The burger and spaghetti, bomb! Bazookee, wow!! ""Ask for Emmy!"""
Annie W.,"Anaheim, CA",677,75,458,2.0,12/6/2017,"This BJ's doesn't compare to other locations! I've been here about 5 times in the past two years, but the last two experiences have left me less than impressed. I came in this past Sunday with my family and we were there for over two hours after we were seated. We came in early so our wait time was only ten minutes. Once we were seated and our orders taken, it took forever to get our food. We ordered my favorite Honey Siracha Brussels Sprouts to start. I ordered extra sauce on it, since the last time we visited this location they put barely any on it. There was extra sauce as requested but this time, the texture of some of the Brussel sprouts wasn't great.  The main complaint was the wait time. My mom and I split a medium pizza and after a long wait it was brought out. (I guess they don't offer to serve your first slices here, as they do at other locations.) they said the rest of our parties' food would be following right behind. Well it eventually came ten minutes later. My dad said his steak was mediocre, but my Grandma enjoyed her Cobb Salad. When we got the bill we asked the server why it was such a long wait that night. He said they were short staffed because people called in sick and such. He was apologetic. I frequent several BJ's in the valley and Orange County and this location needs an overhaul! I wanted to leave a review after my last visit, but figured they couldn't handle a less than stellar review just a few days after the frog situation!"
Eva H.,"Covina, CA",7,1,,2.0,11/30/2017,"It was a night out with a couple of my friends they were already at the table waiting for me. I arrived to the location in hopes of having a good night but i was wrong. First, I came in and the server right away was giving an attitude. He arrived after 10min to our table and he never offered me a menu. He just asked what I would like to drink which i ordered a Sangria (it was pretty good). My friends ordered wings not one of them got utensils, or napkins. We had to go to other table and grab some.  He later came and said that they were last call and if we like to add anything to this we ordered a pizzookie(which is always amazing). Me and friends were talking and they told me that since they were seated the server had an attitude and no friendly attitude to be seen. I would not complaint if it was a first time but we go there all the time at least once a week and there has been a trend the server is always rude and not very attentive.  At the end of the night one of my friends paid with cash and he even asked if she wanted change. That is not something you ask!  Food has always been amazing!"
Pete B.,"Long Beach, CA",377,407,2246,3.0,10/26/2017,"I don't normally go to restaurant chain but tonight i tried something different. They have a nice variety of entrées.   I was tempted to get nightly special which was the rack of ribs.  Great value at $18.95 with 2 sides. But when I got wind from the waiter that were only two porkchops left  for tonights dinner and that they normally run out early I decided to switch my order and get some pork chops.  So glad I did.    The pork chop was extremely juicy and super thick! The sides orders were just okay. The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and the Caesar salad had cheddar cheese and avocado which are not two things I normally  expect in a a Caesar salad For an appetizer, we ordered the sampler which included boneless chicken wings,  spinach  dip,  eggrolls, and mozzarella sticks The mozzarella sticks (5 stars ) The eggrolls were  soggy (2 stars)  The boneless wings had a nice flavor (4 star) The spinach dip was runny and no flavor (1 star)   We got the chocolate chip cookie covered in ice cream for dessert.  It was a hit (5 stars)"
Elmer P.,"Azusa, CA",172,36,118,3.0,1/2/2018,"Hey guys I've been to this spot several times it's always hit or miss with customer service you'll either get the super friendly ones or super bitchy, about the food most of the time it is pretty fresh and tasty there has been 2 times where I have to get their attention and have sent my food back for being cold as hell portion wise I think they are pretty good size portions the atmosphere it is nice too... they have alot of tv screens and they are always on, bathrooms could be a little cleaner I think other than that it's a cool spot."
Nathasia H.,"West Covina, CA",213,57,91,3.0,9/24/2017,"Went here today for my birthday dinner. We got there around 8 PM, we got into a waitlist and have to wait for around 10 mins. We finally got seated and our server welcome us very nicely. She's really helpful, friendly, and patient with us. While ordering, i asked which magarita is the porpular one, she said its the peach one but we ended with watermelon ‍ lol and we ordered kids meal which is chicken tender + fries & chocolate milk, sirloin steak, clam chowder in a bowl and hickory briset and bacon burger. After we ordered, waiting for around 15-20 mins, they gave us sets of utensils and when i opened it, my utensils and my mom are really dirty. Have to change it back so I told them, and she apologized for it (not really big deal for me).  Second, when we get our sirloin steak with fries and mashed potatoes, the mashed potatoes is really cold!! Third, you know how kids meal, it serves with a drink too? Like i said earlier my bro ordered kids meal with chocolate milk on it. It never came. So i have to ask this server wheres the chocolate milk, and she answered it with a rude attitude which no no no. We've been waiting and she was kinda yelling that they dont have chocolate milk yet no one tell us that we have chocolate milk. Really disappointed, after couple minutes, our server come to our table with vanilla milk and told us that she forgot that they have no chocolate milk.  After all, food is alright, service they can do better ! And i got complimetary pizookie for my bday tho even its not as big but we good.  Overall, 6/10 because of that server gave me an attitude where all i was trying to do is asking where my brother chocolate milk! Thanks for making my bday awesome in this place -,-"
Kevin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,8,12,5.0,1/7/2018,"Cameron was awesome! We had a party of 5, including two little ones that were a handful and kept him busy with theirs and our requests. He was very attentive and service was great all the way to the end! I've also visited this location multiple times before in the bar area and the service there has always been great! Thanks again!"
Jen V.,"Ontario, CA",43,45,197,3.0,1/4/2018,SERVICE!!! We were a party of 8 in the bar area on a Wednesday afternoon so I would have thought the service would be pretty great since there was only two other tables filled in the bar! Our server got switched out half way through service and he CHARGED US FULL PRICE ON HALF OF THE HAPPY HOUR ITEMS! Plus they need some better quality paper napkins! The small square and fabric ones suck! Avocado egg rolls were excellent! Happy hour Mini Pizza was Terrible! No crispiness to it at all all soft dough and very little cheese! Idk about this location or if I will return!?!?
Luz B.,"West Covina, CA",0,10,2,5.0,1/7/2018,"Good service. The food is what you would expect from a chain restaurant, but this particular Bjs has good staff. Kudos to you all! Everyone seems to be friendly and helpful. They like working!"
Alexandria R.,"Cerritos, CA",128,5,7,5.0,12/21/2017,Had a great time here at BJs for our holiday office party! About 27 of us & the service was on point. Shout out to Samantha R who actively made sure each of us were taken care of. Many thanks!
Ray G.,"Alhambra, CA",592,136,322,4.0,8/25/2017,"I been to a hand full of locations, this had been thus far one of the best. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Great at recommending and giving good suggestions.  The food quality was great. The food came out hot and tasty. The recommended spicy Brussel sprouts was delicious. The deep dish pizza on point like usual.  Come to this location because you can never go wrong with great service."
Nom D.,"Arlington, VA",0,11,,2.0,11/14/2017,"How does this chain continue to exist? Do adolescent teenage boys patronize the place for in the absurd hope for truth in advertising? I ordered a medium rare sirloin steak, garlic green beans, & Caesar salad.  The steak arrived with a 1/8 inch layer of steak salt.  Even after scrapping off the salt crust layer the damage had been down.  It over powered the very mediocre meat.  Considering the ""quality"" of the ""steak"" perhaps exceeding the recommended daily allowance requirement for sodium, by 700%, made the steak more...edible.  Enough of that, lets press onto something more easily ruined...I mean prepared. The green beans had not even a hint of garlic or butter but tasted as though someone squeezed lemon juice onto it. Yes, lemon. The Caesar sales tasted so drab, the dressing lacked any flavor & definitely contained no anchovy.    Considering the crowds, reviews, & recommendations I expected a bit more than a bad meal.  I recommend you blow off BJ's."
Andrea E.,"Glendora, CA",125,41,5,2.0,12/31/2017,"Food is always delicious, servers are almost always friendly. Service is awful. There really is no other way to describe it. The weird ""server enters the order then random employees stop by with pieces of your order throughout the evening"" just isn't conducive to a good night out. Our party of 8 placed our drink & appetizers order at once. 5 mins in we got a drink. 3 minutes pass and 2 more arrive. By the time all 8 people had a drink in front of them we had met 4 employees and had 4 empty cups. The 5th employee showed up with the wrong appetizers, then argued with us that we had, in fact, ordered what he brought. When our server showed up & saw them sitting on our table he said ""those aren't your appetizers?!""... um, tell your coworker that, he didn't believe us. Dinner came out one or two at a time so we didn't really eat together. we did have the late appetizers to nosh while the others started with their entrees. Same weird configuration for dessert. We all watched one person's ice cream melt while we waited for the others to arrive. Whoever thought it was efficient & customer friendly to devise this system is wrong.  I really felt bad for our server, he tried his best to provide a great dining experience and you could tell he was frustrated with the way the meal arrived. This was the second bad experience we have had at this location in two visits. We'll drive a little further the next time we get the urge for BJs. West Covina just can't get it right."
Leonard A.,"Los Angeles, CA",741,299,3000,3.0,2/20/2017,"After watching a couple of plugs on television,I decided to revisit this restaurant slash brew house slash sports bar.And so my journey began,hmmm. So of course I had to start off with those famous  Pizookies.The salted caramel and macadamia nut are couple of new arrivals to the dessert menu.And just like I remembered the original,these party mouth favors blasted my taste buds with sweet, salty,rich and robust flavors.Man,that was definitely  the highlight of my evening.Another new arrival that  I tried was the Roasted Maple Salmon Tacos.When  they brought it out it looked so good but I just had one problem.Apples,green apples I may add.The  sourness of the apple slices mixed in with the broccoli slaw definitely did not work for me.It may be good for some people but just not for me. The hostess was nice but the wait time to order took over twenty minutes,not cool.But in all fairness  it wasn't our servers fault.I think if management had  stepped in and helped out,it wouldn't of been such a problem.From what I saw,they were hanging out in the corners laughing it up like snootiness,definitely not cool.At least the pizookies were bomb.Peace"
Chris D.,"Diamond Bar, CA",36,7,4,4.0,12/28/2017,"One of the better BJ locations I've been to. I went on a Thursday after work with friends and had quick service during happy hour, the appetizers were good, and I got good recommendations on beers. On my way out I bought a growler to go and Miguel was awesome for checking to see if the beer I wanted was available, which in the end it wasn't. No sweat, he recommended another that I liked and set me up. My growler came out somewhat under-filled (the 64) and Miguel fixed it himself, super apologetic and courteous but seriously not even a problem. I appreciate that. Thanks Miguel :D"
Jonathan C.,"Covina, CA",1,7,,5.0,12/5/2017,John Friedman was awesome he was our server and was quick and extremely kind and I couldn't give a better review if I tried cause he was an excellent server. Great spot and ask for John F.  - Jonathan Carter
Mariana B.,"San Bernardino, CA",16,6,1,5.0,12/29/2017,From getting seated to paying our entire experience was wonderful. Our server a John F. Always made sure we were taken care of and offered great suggestions on drinks and menu choices. Will gladly recommend this location to our friends and family.
Erika Joy R.,"Ontario, CA",299,1,,1.0,12/30/2017,Worst customer service ever!!! This place treats you with no respect and are very rude. Not worth the the time and effort to come and eat here. Also food was cold and hard when it got to our table not fresh at all! Yuck! I don't understand why this place is still up and running.
Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,1.0,7/29/2017,"So we went to BJ's to try their new items which have been advertised heavily.  Well, all I can say the advertising is much better than the food that you get.  Our dinner party was so disappointed.  Brewhouse Slow-Roasted Menu needs more QA.   The Prime Rib was truly tasteless.  No seasoning.  The Pork Chop was cooked very well, but again, no seasoning at any level.  The ribs tasted like day old re-fired ribs.   This is what BJ's states 'After a long series of taste tests and tweaks, we have perfected our Brewhouse Slow-Roasted entrees and sandwiches, delivering amazing taste at an affordable price,"" said Trojan. ""We spend hours slow-roasting every cut of meat so that our guests can spend every second enjoying it.' We spent zero seconds enjoying these new items due to a complete lack of seasoning.  Now the real mess was the new chicken burgers.  One is a regular chicken sandwich and the other has avocado and an egg served on top.  Well, these two items need to be reevaluated.  The regular chicken sandwich was just plain weird.  It was four small parts (lord knows what parts!) of a chicken put in between a bun and served up.  It was strange and tasted even stranger.  It looked like left over chicken was used to create this chicken burger. Now the real mess was the chicken burger with avocado and an egg on top.  First off the presentation was horrible.  The egg was off the sandwich and when the waiter tried to put it back on the sandwich it burst and you now had an egg yolk mess in your hands.  I literally was grossed out on the mess this sandwich made  I could have been in a horror film if someone looked at my hands and the many napkins I needed.  The bun instantly disintegrated due to the liquid mess and it became inedible without a fork and knife.  Terrible experience. We wrapped it up by trying the new Churro Pizookie.  It is a bunch of Churros with some Ice Cream.  Not for me as the sugar on all the churros was just too much.  Now, adding just a few Churros to a regular Pizzokie would work for me. BJ's QA is extremely spotty from location to location and I don't get it.  You should have the same quality and consistency at each establishment.  Also, the service is so different from establishment to establishment.  There is no excuse for the QA or the spotty service.  For a party of six, we were there close to 4 hours due to the length of time we had to wait for our server, our drinks, our orders in and finally our food.  I serious undercover boss is warranted for BJ's."
Carol C.,"West Covina, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/28/2017,"We had a Great lunch this past time with Emy as our server. She is the BEST SERVER there at this BJ's. She makes sure you are happy with your food and makes you feel welcome The time we were there before we had Terrible serves which included no silverware, we had to ask for it, food was terrible, had to ask for everything that was needed at our table ( drink refill, extra napkins, sugar, etc . Their cod fish was like eating old mushy fish. Just couldn't eat it. Was never asked if I wanted something else or removing it from our bill. If Emy is not there we will never eat there again."
Isela C.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,3.0,12/27/2017,Bryan provided great service BJ's needs more like him.  Big improvement from our last visit.
Brenda M.,"La Verne, CA",0,24,15,1.0,12/11/2017,"Friends suck! I swore off going back to BJ's. But all my friend wanted to go to happy hour. So here goes, nothing has changed since my last review. I really want to go in the kitchen to see what's in there ? Why are all the waiters and bus people hanging in there? I felt sorry for our waiter, he was sweet but he was the only one in the bar area ( I think?). He was running from one place to the other.  We waited and waited for our food and the dessert we waited over 30 minute and we didn't want it and wanted to leave....  We waited for refills on our waters and never got it for the Diet Cokes. To the manager the messages me no thank u, I'll be wasting my time and money. Too bad the kitchen not open so the employees can't hide. I kinda feel the employees don't like the food/drinks at BJ's when they bring in Starbucks! Smiles and more employees on the floor helping customers might make things better.... I know this review is all over place but I am angry, and  I wasted my time and money again!"
antonio k.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,33,1,2.0,12/17/2017,Awful food quality. Hamburger patty tasted like cardboard other dishes were disgusting. Transitioning to a dive bar I guess.
Jose M.,"Hayward, CA",68,5,2,1.0,11/8/2017,"We sat in one of the tables at the bar (self sitting) and it seem as if it was self-service too because we only saw our server twice. He walked by our table several times, and not once he asked if we were ok or needed anytime else, yet he took the time to talk to someone else who was sitting at the bar. We order a refilled for our drink and it took about 10 minutes to get it (literally)...we even forgot we had asked for it. I finished my meal and moved my empty place to the side of the table and he didn't bother to pick it up until we called him over because we wanted to order some dessert.  The overall experience   the service we received from our server was pretty bad to say the least. The only good thing about it was the monkey bread!!"
Steve C.,"Glendora, CA",42,47,55,2.0,5/16/2017,"Myself and 2 kids decided to eat here after a long hot day at the baseball field. My 2 kids were thirsty and ready to eat. We promptly got sat after using the mobile -waitlist function. We sat....and...sat...and waited patiently..and waited some more. After the kids getting restless I noticed about 25 minutes went by and we hadn't received anything! No water. Not a hi! hello!...nada. I got up and asked the hostess if we can move some place where we could get service. She looked confused and said she would help. Finally another gal come by - looked like a lead but didn't introduce herself and stated they forgot about us. Sigh... Finally took our order and things started moving.  Thought that was the worst part - no!.... My kids ordered sliders from the children's menu. They came out after the mountain o' fries and chips/guac. I'm fixing the sliders for the kids with the condiments and O M G. The burger was charred. Like beyond belief charred. I sent it back right way. 15 minutes later we get it and kids so over the plethora o' fries ...Although we got 50% off our bill. I still shake my head. The last excuse from the manager/lead that stuck in my head... ""Well we cook our burgers well done for kids"" Im like huh? Being a chef myself...These weren't well done. They were charcoal.  Two not so great experiences form BJ's which I normally favor (the first one was at Arcadia, CA)"
Jay A.,"Walnut, CA",94,22,2,1.0,10/29/2017,Waitress forgot to take my order so my food came in late. Chicken soba noodles barely had any chicken. This was about $15. Not worth it at all. Very disappointing.
Skye S D.,"West Covina, CA",80,41,87,3.0,9/13/2017,been here few times & usually order their flatbread pizzas + a wide variety of drinks its a decent place 2 catch sports  ~  their waitstaff needs 2b more attentive but da bartenders have been pretty good
Melissa N.,"Pasadena, CA",93,8,3,5.0,12/9/2017,"It's been since 2010 since I've been here, thinking it's the same ole pizza and beer place. Nope, totally different! John F. took care of us and gave great beer recommendations. They're bringing on a lot of local craft beer brew which awesome to hear. I have a great appreciation for craft beer and happy to hear that they now have a larger selection. Apart from that, the food selection has really expanded. They have healthy food options, small appetizer size plates, and of course their pizzas and steak. Great place and I'll be sure to keep this place top of mind when I'm around town."
Danielle  V.,"West Covina, CA",33,18,16,1.0,9/26/2017,"So I've been to this location multiple times and had stopped going due to poor service and horrible food. But I recently went with my friend and had the EXACT same experience. We got pizza and half of the pizza had no cheese and was completely black from being burnt. We showed our waitor and he brought us a personal pan to make up for it, which would have  be been okay if they didn't serve it to us on a dirty ass plate! Not only that it took 15 min to get our drinks, which were 2 cokes not even alcoholic beverages that would make the wait semi-okay. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!"
Richard F.,"Glendora, CA",69,110,419,4.0,11/14/2016,"Light snack for last night's dinner. ""Guacamole Burger w/wedge fries"" POGIBALLS rating  Burger had a nice big chunk of avocado and the burger was cooked well.  Bun was nice and toasted and mixed in with the wedge fries with ranch dipping sauce made for a very good meal.  A little on the greasy side but still ok."
Salomon O.,"Bakersfield, CA",96,6,,1.0,1/1/2018,"I'd like to start by saying I love Bj's and eat at Bj's frequently. Today left me in shock! Everything was like normal; It seem liked a busy day at bj's which was expected, well than finally we were called to sit down we had one waiter to which we ordered our appetizer and drinks than we had a server change for one reason or another and this is when everything changed we ordered our food (a pizza and a pazookie for dessert) but then next male waiter we had right of the start when I asked if my appetizer was coming since it had been a long wait; answered with a very sarcastic and almost demeaning way he said, ""most likely since you guys asked about getting a more roomy table the order was put on hold but I'll check"" I was like okay understandable but we didn't end up moving? But i was like okay that's fine. On a side note we had already been sitting at our table for around 40 to 45 min with only drinks. The waiter Than comes back with the pazookies and no pizzas! I was like really! I Than politely asked the waiter and said please cancel my avocados rolls. He gave a very dirty looked shrug his shoulders and walked off not one word not a sorry nothing. We were there with a couple friends I left them the money for the pazookie and left. Worst experience ever! Be very careful when going to this BJ's"
Josephine Q.,"Baldwin Park, CA",62,28,38,3.0,8/12/2017,"Late post:  My girlfriend and I came on Thursday night. We were told it would take about 10-15 mins before we can be seated or we had the option of sitting in the bar area, so we decided to just sit by the bar. BIG MISTAKE. We waited around 5 mins and no one bothered to approach us to even give us our menus despite seating another couple. So we decided we would rather wait the 10-15 mins to actually receive service. Luckily, we just went up to the host and was seated immediately.  I ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and although it tasted good, I don't plan on ordering it again because despite being on a diet, it is too light of a meal for me personally. I felt as if my salmon was slightly smaller than the first time I tried it, but it was so long ago that I honestly don't remember. For the same price, I rather order my fettuccini alfredo and just bring half of it home so I can eat it as leftovers the next day. It comes out to be about the same calories anyway if you only eat half of the fettuccine, although I do understand that it won't be as healthy as the salmon, so there's the dilemma.  Anyway, our server was really nice and even gave us a free mini pizookie! We ended up getting the triple chocolate and it was heaven in my mouth. I didn't care for the ice cream because it tasted like regular ice cream, but the warm cookie practically melted in my mouth."
Michelle G.,"West Covina, CA",79,5,,1.0,1/8/2018,"We arrived at BJ's 01/07/2018 at approximately 2:40.  By the time our food finally came to our table as we ordered it was 4:30.  Almost 2 hours later.  All we ordered was grilled cheese with tortilla soup +extra cheese & tortilla strips and an Ahi salad with dressing on the side.  The soup came out fairly quickly and was cold.  We sent it back it came out about 40 min later still cold.  We spoke to the manager and he brought a new one out about 20 min after that and it was not hot like soup should be it was tepid.  Still no sign of the grilled cheese or Ahi salad.  The server said our food was ready and would we like him to bring it (blank look on our faces) of course we would.  After a long wait the manager stated he checked on our food and didn't like the way it looked so was remaking it.  When  the grilled cheese finally came it was on the WRONG bread.  It was supposed to be on Parmesan crusted bread but was on plain white bread.  Still no sign of the Ahi salad.  The Ahi salad came with the second attempt at the grilled cheese.  The manager comped the grilled cheese & soup combo but still charged for the Ahi salad that took literally shy of 2 hours to arrive correct at the table.  This was the worst service, food and experience I have ever had.  Will not be returning anytime soon to this location."
Chona P.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,17,3,5.0,4/24/2017,"BJ's never failed my expectation. Courteous servers, good food choices. Came here for regular family dinner and left satisfied. Waiter Malik did not lie about the spaghetti meatballs having pork in the ingredients. I don't eat pork and he was kind enough to ask the kitchen if they can substitute, which they did.  Their Mediterranean Pizza was also very tasty. BJ's is definitely many bars higher than other restaurants. Excellent food, excellent service."
Breanna D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,,5.0,12/6/2017,"I think this was the best experience we have ever had at any restaurant, our server was John Friedman he was so amazing, he did not know that my sisters husband had just passed away.  It was our first time out without him we were celebrating my nieces birthday and he was so great we actually felt normal for the first time in a long time. Thank you John Friedman you have set the bar to a whole new level"
Tasha V.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",264,285,152,4.0,4/8/2017,"I am always a fan of BJs brewhouse. The service is usually slightly above average and the food plentiful and tasty. The menu offers a very large selection, which can be overwhelming, yet welcoming. Of course end the meal with a pizookie and you are all set. The atmosphere is loud and has a sports bar vibe, yet the service and food does not hold that statistic.  Dine or Dash? Dine. This place is always a safe bet."
Jose R.,"South El Monte, CA",12,9,1,1.0,10/5/2017,"So my group went out to have some drinks after work. We did not like the service by the host on Fridays so we went to BJ'S just a walk away.   Our first server was great, perfect timing and being recognizable on our usual and small drinks.  Mind you this is a party of three.  Sadly after our original server rotated with someone who doesn't know what he is doing made our rating go from 5 stars to two stars explains enough.  It's football season I myself don't need a halfway job I need a full measure job.  If servers can't do their job  with the amount of stress then you should find someone who knows what they are doing once they take over your shift.  It's easy to rotate if not then your Manager is responsible for mismanaging"
Kameron J.,"West Covina, CA",4,2,1,1.0,10/2/2017,What u call churros Didn't come with cinnamon and the cookie wasn't even cooked all the way I'm smh
Michael Z.,"Filderstadt, Germany",1,1,1,5.0,8/3/2017,Food was amazing. I got the best ribs ever here. Very Organized. Friendly service by Emy Setiadi. She was very attentive. we will be coming back because of her wonderful service! Thursday ribs special is the best!!
Will L.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,13,,1.0,11/14/2017,"If there was a no star option, I would've loved to give that zero star. Probably the worst experience at BJs ever. My boyfriend and I decided to take out his parents for his dad's birthday. when we first ordered our beverage, we asked the lady who brought our drinks for some lemons, she said ok, Never came back,, we then asked our server who apologized and came back with our lemons 30 minutes from the time we asked.  Then when our food was ready and presented to our table, our server had to explain to us that one of our dishes got taken from another server to another table ,, therefore we had to wait for that dish, our server apologized for the confusion ,, the dish was then delivered to us, after 10 minutes,, we then realized that no one gave us utensils before or after our food was delivered. We then started eating, and theny boyfriend realized that the meatball in his spaghetti was really soft and it tasted funny, both his mother and I tried the meatball , when we cut it opened, the meatball was not cooked all the way through ,, we called the manager over made a complaint, the manager tried to tell us that she will take care of SOME of our foods, but then we insisted that she takes care of the entire bill. The manager took care of the bill and gave us a gift card for the next time back.  Overall our server, John was attentive, and very nice and took care of this situation professionally . Never again will we come to this location again!! Worst experience ever!!!!!!"
