Jeff T.,"San Gabriel, CA",71,304,48,4.0,10/25/2016,"BJ's has a surprisingly good and inexpensive lunch.  I got a normal sausage, eggs, potatoes, and toast breakfast.  I believe it was $8 which is quite reasonable.  A much better value than Denny's or IHOP and the quality is better as well.  They don't have a very extensive breakfast/brunch menu, but they have tons of lunch options to make up for it.  The coffee is a bit weak though."
Ruth V.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,25,9,1.0,9/13/2016,"I'm getting straight to the point/s :  Food : Very tasty for a chain & compared to the other restaurants around the food is good .  Service : friendly but SLOW ! So far the times I've visited the servers have been sweet but they are not capable of doing a decent job .  Ambiance : loud , large groups .  Overall : the times I've gone it is because of a birthday dinner, someone taking me out for birthday / date , I would personally not come again ! Last visit : party of 4 , server took too long to come take our drink order , finally he did but took forever to bring the drinks (about 25 min) . We only went for pizookies , he said the order  would take  about 5 maybe 10 min to come out , we waited for 40 MINUTES !!! One order came out and then after asking for the other pizookies we had to wait another 15-20 min . Although I was very annoyed I didn't say anything but the waiter noticed and offered to take the sodas off the bill . Overall I will not be visiting again , as I did not find it worth the time ."
Bella M.,"West Covina, CA",3,34,11,3.0,4/3/2016,"Came here on a Saturday evening with a party of 10 and small kids. I give this place 3 stars because the food was good and came to us pretty quick. It's just our server, I believe his name was David, was not his friendliest or helpful. He took everyone's order, my sister and I weren't quite ready so he said he would be back. He never came back to check up on us. Everyone else had their food and he still hadn't taken our order. We had to call him and let him know we're ready. Throughout the evening not once did he come by and ask if everyone was doing okay or if we needed something. We had to constantly be calling him to our table for things we needed. And when we would call him? He always seemed annoyed. Overall service by him was 1 star. I know you shouldn't rate a whole restaurant based off one bad server. But you come to a place to have a good time. One person giving bad service reflects on everyone."
Xavier V.,"Azusa, CA",0,4,,2.0,9/18/2016,Don't come on a Sunday poor service takes a hour to get your appatizers and other hours to receive your entree what a lack of service oh and 20 mins to get side of ranch
Sergio B.,"Murrieta, CA",129,51,27,2.0,12/15/2016,Well if you look at my reviews I come different BJ's restaurants a lot and 7 out 10 times I'm disappointed in their service but sometimes they surprise me but I probably won't be ever coming back to this location because they can't ever get passed a two even though I try and try again! They took forever to come take my order (15 minutes) then they took forever to bring my order and when they finally did they didn't put in my order only my sons and while I waited for the waiter to come back to follow up so I could tell him.... low and behold 20 minutes later I decided we'll son since you've finished eating already I'm just going to personally walk up to the register and ask for my bill so we can go home. Screw it so over this place!!!
Andy F.,"Covina, CA",1,5,1,1.0,3/31/2017,"On multiple occasions, the host has ""forgot to call my name"", or ""was just about to call me"". Bs. I waited 40 mins for a table (eventhough they said 25-30 mins) and when i didnt get called, and i inquired, they said, ""uhhh i can take u to your table"". Unorganized. On this occasion i had a great waiter, total thumbs up. I wish i wouldve asked his name. I ordered a pizza and they gave me a donut with a little cheese sprinkled on top. Their deep dish is embarrassing. My favorite pizza anywhere used to be the bjs buffalo chicken pizza. Now, i couldnt eat more than a slice and a half (theyre tiny btw). I will not be returning. Some type of bad experience has happened 7 out of 8 times. No more benefit of the doubt. I give up. Sad to say cause i actually went in there with a smile on my face cause i knew i was getting my fave pizza. I left with a broken heart and felt like my dreams had been shattered."
Andrew P.,"San Marcos, CA",124,448,15,4.0,3/18/2016,"I came here with a friend for a late-night dinner, and left pleasantly surprised.  My previous experiences at any BJ's location have usually involved terrible service and mediocre food, but this place was decent.  We were seated right away, and had a waiter come to the table quickly.  The service was great - fast and friendly with no major issues.  The food was decent - we opted for some sort of chicken ranch deep-dish pizza.  For the price, it was filling and was pretty tasty.  Overall, it was a good experience and I'd be happy to come back again."
Rudy B.,"La Verne, CA",2,8,2,1.0,12/4/2016,Worst place to go if you have a party more than 6 people ... almost two hours wait for a party of 12 ... appetizer didn't arrive until end of the meal... one of our order came out wrong .. totally ruined our birthday celebration
Jezebel H.,"Covina, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/27/2016,So disappointed and still angry on my visit I just had to deal with along with my family. We are rewards members with you guys and come to this location all the time and specifically sit by the bar because it seems that is the only area where you are attended to correctly. Chris at the bar always is on it and this time we choose to sit at the tables we get shitty service. Our server DESIRE rang up our drinks and appetizers in a hurry and NEVER rang up our order. We flagged her down 50 minutes later to check on our food and asked us what our order was and then comes back out and tells us it was her fault she never put our order in. Then asks us if we want to wait another 20 minutes for our food? What question is that to a guest who has already been waiting. She wasn't genuine on her apology and seemed to use the business as an excuse for her mistake. If it is too busy and you can't keep up then ask your co workers for help or where is your manager supporting you if you're still training? I am a general manager in a restaurant and you own up to your mistakes. The manager she brought over to us simply just said she had no excuses for our wait and what happened and I even told her she should ensure she is staffed properly to keep up with their business unless you want to continue having these experiences with other people she gave us a 25 dollar gift card not comping the meal we used it to pay for our bill. And still asked us if we wanted the order in. No longer did any of us want to wait and even if we did we wouldn't have enjoyed it after the service we just recieved. We even told her that this isn't the first time it's happened sitting in the dining tables by the bar. Unfortunately this being the closest location we will just drive to Chino or another BJ'S somewhere else...
Richard T.,"Beaumont, CA",0,4,,4.0,5/30/2017,"We had the best service from Emy along with some great food. The all you can eat soup and salad was wonderful, try cheddery soup, you have ask for it......so good. Thanks Emy"
Katrina S.,"Covina, CA",83,43,30,5.0,7/17/2016,"Normally I'm always missing a thing or two with my takeout orders but every time I get my order prepared by Chioma, nothing is ever missing. She is always putting the extra care into the orders she gets and you can really tell it was prepared with love. Every time I get takeout I always hope Chioma is working that day so I can get the impeccable service she gives. If you are going to order takeout, definitely request Chioma to prepare it for you!"
Shelby R.,"Westmont, Pomona, CA",0,4,3,5.0,5/24/2017,"Emy is a FABULOUS server/waitress at this BJ's location. Great service. She was very accommodating and friendly...made sure EVERYTHING was just right for me, my father and stepmom. I came in on a Wednesday at 3:00 PM, so that's when she works!"
Mark M.,"Inglewood, CA",247,142,67,2.0,5/7/2015,Probably some of the worst bar food I've ever had. I ordered calamari as an appatizer and chicken and Brussel sprouts for lunch. The chicken was way way over cooked to the point that it was real dry and the Brussel sprouts tasted extra bitter. The best part of the meal was the calamari.
Martin M.,"Fullerton, CA",37,54,13,1.0,2/16/2016,"We waited for our food for over 40 minutes in the curb side service. I placed the order at 5:20 I get a call asking if I had placed an order. So she says it'll be 20 minutes. I understand that it's a holiday so I give them thirty five minutes. I call in again, once I'm in the curb side parking spot, because the sign says to do so.        This guy says you placed an order? I stated I had and he says ok someone will be out there in a few. 40 minutes later I call again and I'm like uh we're still here. They say ok someone will be right out... 15 minutes later she finally arrives with our food. I wasn't rude at all I understand its busy and the girl was super nice. What really top this whole ordeal was when we got home, we were eating and there was a HUGE hair in my husbands salad. Gross!! So upsetting that even the pizookie couldn't heal that hurt. Someone needs to work on their quality checking and work flow."
Priscilla Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,832,1893,2.0,12/18/2014,"Like all chain restaurant, nothing special and nothing good. Except they provide big portion and large amount of calories that are enough for your whole day activity. Had their lunch special, salad with angle hair. The shrimp was like frozen ones, had no taste. And the noodles tasted so bland. No flavor at all, and probably full of empty calories (marked on the menu). Very low quality food. If you have a taste bud, this is not the place you wanna go.  I also tried my friend's fries. The thicker ones tasted better, they were very soft. But the thin ones tasted bad as they were not crispy or soft.  Sorry that I just don't like this type of chain stores. But for office get-together, I had to go."
Kimberly D.,"Covina, CA",28,1,,1.0,6/7/2017,"Took my daughter and granddaughter out tonight for dinner and was greatly disappointed with the food.   I ordered the lemon thyme chicken which was served pretty raw with pink coloring throughout. In addition the entire meal (rice and vegetables) were only slightly warm. I politely asked the waiter if he could take it back for further cooking. He even agreed that it looked raw and apologized. After waiting for only a short period of time he brought it back with one piece that looked grilled, the other looked the same as when it left the table.  I cut into both pieces and they were still pink and cool to the touch. My waiter was busy and I asked another employee for the manager who politely asked if I wanted something else. I ordered a pizza. The waiter stated that they would probably take one of the meals off my bill. Oh come on, were they planning on charging me for both?  My pizza was cooked perfectly and was delicious. When I received the bill, I was not charged for the chicken, but was charged for the pizza, which happened to be $3.00 more. No further apologies or reduction of bill or maybe even a complimentary dessert would have been a nice gesture. Nothing to make up for my time wasted while two attempts to cook my food failed. Definitely not a restaurant I will recommend or frequent.  Very disappointed."
Ray F.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",1,5,,1.0,10/22/2016,"This restaurant serious blows. Ordered online to avoid the Saturday night crowd. Make the order at 6:29, I'm there by 6:45 the time listed to show up for my order. Big lerp at the to go desk, won't even make eye contact with me so I can pay and be on my way. 10 min go by and female attendant who seems put off that she has to address me finally asks me if I need to make an order. Tell her I ordered online  I pay and get change for $100 on a $40 dollar order, all in $5's. She doesnt even count it out. Literally balls it up and slaps it in my hand with the receipt. Felt like i was buying a dime bag on the corner. The kicker is, the pizza was ice cold when i get home. That long 5 min drive on 80 degree night must have just chilled it over."
Breanne M.,"Azusa, CA",83,9,1,1.0,10/17/2016,My family and some friends end up showing up there this past weekend we got seated in about 10mins that was great but after that we waited a hour to get our food and then it was cold we got the manager involved but the damage was done even though they tried to fix the problem it's not worth the headache we will not be going back
Andrew S.,"Covina, CA",51,12,3,1.0,6/23/2016,"This one star isn't for the Bj's restaurant as a whole, just their loose end.    I gathered with family to celebrate a birthday and our waiter, Frank couldn't have been the absolute worst service I've experienced at this Bj's, or any other location.    He had trouble getting down orders and even the simplest request. His presence was very hallow since he seemed completely disinterested in helping us in away.  Anytime we asked or question something regarding our order he would say rudely, ""wait. Give me a minute."" Or ""can you let me finish this first?""  Clearly he wasn't ready or trained well enough to handle 15/20 people and when it came to delivering the birthday boy's Pazookie, Frank simply slammed it in front of him and we had no idea he had even brought it until after we saw that it was hiding somewhere in the center of the table. We sang happy birthday and asked for pictures and his response was, ""eh, I don't know. Wait. Hold on.""  At which point we didn't care to ask for anymore help knowing that he really didn't want to help us and he clearly had somewhere else better to be.  He made the dinner feel like nothing special and treated us as if we were last table of the night and we were keeping him from going home.  Point is, his service as a waiter was displeasing and how we ever got so unlucky, is beyond me.    However, despite Frank; The restaurant never disappoints as a whole. Friendly staff, food is always 100% and looks straight from the menu with REAL quality you can taste. It's always been a favorite place to dine for our family which it was why it was no contest when it came to celebrating a birthday; unfortunately we got unlucky this time.  Hope to return soon with a better experience,... far better.  - XIII"
Inda C.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,2,1.0,10/16/2016,"For a party of 40+ people with buffet style dinner, surely enough this restaurant cannot handle it. 1. Service is very slow, obviously they don't have experience dealing with a large group. We have to ask NUMEROUS times to get the drinks and  menu refilled. Asking for a second ice tea, the water gave me ice water, instead. 2. Food was bland, dry and not hold on safe temperature. Caesar Salad: dry, not cold, not enough dressing and cheese. Spaghetti with meat balls: bland and dry, meatballs taste like they were served straight from the microwave. C'mon, there are 40+ people, they only gave 15 meatballs. Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken: bland and dry, not enough chicken. Overall, this restaurant only deserves a C rating and definitely, we will NOT go back to BJ's. First and last visit!"
