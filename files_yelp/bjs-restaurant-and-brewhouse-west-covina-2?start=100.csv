Monica G.,"Glendora, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/14/2017,Danielle was probably the best service I will ever have. Not one negative thought crossed my mind while we waited for our food and as we were eating. That girl deserves a freaking raise!!! Bust experience I have ever had here.
Dee R.,"Bellflower, CA",27,70,68,4.0,1/29/2017,"Great portions, tasty food!! Busy Saturday night! But managed to get seated within 35 minutes.. took a good while to get our appetizers and food but waiter was polite and attentive to our drinks.."
Paul P.,"West Covina, CA",29,22,19,2.0,8/4/2017,"Me and my homie, Came here and leaped outtah here cuz the waitress was not attentive. 17 mins to order a drink....26 mins to order food?! And she didn't ask if we needed refills or offer dinner.. Just gave us the check.."
Allison F.,"Chino Hills, CA",68,13,,5.0,2/16/2017,"There are several reasons for my 5 star rating. First, my family eats here a lot and have found both the food and service to be consistently high quality.  On one occasion when I mentioned that the asparagus was tough, the server got a manager who came and spoke to me. This turned out to be positive experience. I honestly felt like the manager appreciated receiving my feedback.  I tried the Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl this week and it was awesome!  It's on the Enlightened Menu so it's a healthier choice. You can also get this entree with chicken, salmon or vegetarian. There was a lot of shrimp in this dish making it my new favorite! Another of my favorite entrees is the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp.  The fish and shrimp always taste fresh and are cooked perfectly. It's also on the Enlightened Menu.  One evening, I wanted a beer, but wasn't sure what to order. Our server, Nick, blew me away when I asked him for a recommendation. He actually ""paired"" my beer (like is done with wine) based on my tastes and meal. We were impressed.  Here's an important tip when dining at any BJ's. I strongly encourage you to download and use their smartphone app.  You get a free Pazooki just for downloading & using the app. Use the Preferred Waitlist function to minimize wait times. You can pay your bill, order ahead for dine-in or take-out, and you get reward points based on the amount you spend. We earn free meals on a regular basis."
Victor S.,"San Bernardino, CA",54,5,,5.0,8/27/2017,&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Fish and chips all day!! Best dish they have in my opinion. The brews are always on point. Even if they stopped brewing them inside (don't let them fool you )
Ernie F.,"West Covina, CA",6,23,1,2.0,11/6/2016,I know why this place has 3 stars... The service is poop. Plain and simple. I think it would've helped if our 12 year old waiter did his job instead of catering to The Real Housewives of La Puente while they were trying to chow him down.  My opinion. NO BUENO!
Gabriella R.,"El Monte, CA",20,3,1,1.0,11/3/2016,"Service was horrible. The severs took an hour to take our order and skipped some of our party when taking orders. The only time we saw our severs was when our food was delivered and to give us our check. We ordered pizookie and after 40 minutes after we finished our meal, we did not receive them. Many of us had to leave due to prior commitments so we never got them. We saw many of the staff just standing around talking to each other and not paying attention to the cuThe only good thing about the trip was the great food and drinks. Great beer selections  This was my third or fourth time at this location and I've only had good service once. I'd recommend going to the Montebello or Monrovia location."
Kenny N.,"Rosemead, CA",228,55,5,4.0,12/3/2016,"I'd say more between of a 3.5-4 star, but I like BJ's...but here's my experience here: Obviously in many American restaurants they are ""slow"" in serving but accommodating. I ordered a BJ's Steak Rib Eye and my sister ordered a babyback rib and both our orders suspiciously took almost half an hour to get them served. Just when I was about to call on my server to ask why it's taking so long, the dishes arrived and that my server apologized and also brought her manager to come and speak to us. The manager named ""Louis"" was courteous and very accommodating. He apologized to us for the long delay as they were very busy, especially on a Saturday afternoon, and that they do their best to help make our food perfect. Needless to say, very classy of him to do that for us. If this happened in your typical Asian restaurants, an initiation of apology or any kind of conversations are very less likely to happen. He brought me a ketchup and barbeque sauce at the same time. Good service on their end. Food: My steak was perfect as promised. Medium-rare and sizzling, man it was tasty. My two sides were mashed potatoes and seasonal fries, bomb. We ordered the pizookie after and that came out kinda quick! It was yummy. My favorite part of many feasting meals are probably the desserts haha. When we got the bill, we gave them a 100 and waited for our change. The server came back with it and gave us an extra dollar instead of coin change. Pretty courteous of them. I just wished they could've sped things up a little bit or add some extra chefs in the kitchen."
R T.,"Glendora, CA",4,249,42,4.0,2/17/2017,"The place is fun. It is bright, busy and bustling. The food is good and the ambiance is fun. The best is the piezooki. I love it and sometime go just to get a piezooki.  It is a great place to meet people and it is close to the freeway and has easy access."
Gwen L.,"Pomona, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2017,The service was great but I wish the food was as good as the service. We order a pizookie and it was hard as rocks and burnt from the bottom. We ask the sever to bring us a new once since the one she gave us was burn. She comes back later and brings us a new one. Turns out that the new pizookie was just as hard as the previous one.
Joanna P.,"Irwindale, CA",0,13,1,1.0,10/27/2017,THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING TO BJ'S WEST COVINA!!!! Man! I keep giving this place a chance and it doesn't ever get better. West covina BJ'S has the worst service ever. Waited 45 minutes for our dessert we ordered and for 40 minutes we're ignored. I enjoy BJ's  food but definitely not their service. From now on I will visit any other BJ's besides west covina.
NikkiSweet T.,"West Covina, CA",9,3,1,1.0,5/5/2017,"everytime i come to this one we always have horrible service. i seriously need to stop coming to this one. been waiting about 15 minutes for marinara sauce.  The tall waiter with a beard and comb over completely ignored us. The couple that was sitting right next was helped by him, he brought them water, refills, picked up their plates and brought their check. But never once wasted if we needed anything.  Roger was such a huge help. He picked up the other waiter slack. Thank you roger."
SA L.,"Addison, IL",0,4,,1.0,5/16/2017,"If I could give negative, I will !! 1/5 is not enough to describe how unsatisfied I am to this place. If you look at most bad reviews regarding this place, it is generally geared towards the quality of the service.  This place is packed and busy when I arrived. I did not mind the long wait, but server did not tell me that they will text the phone number that I gave them when it's my turn. So I never pay attention to the text and been waited so long that I noticed some other people ahead of me got seated. They should have told everyone that's how they will get notified of if its their turn.  After we got seated and handed the menu, we just asked to get water. Like most people, we waited, and waited, and waited, for 10, 15 minutes. No one comes. We were left unattended, ignored, while we see others who came after us and seated, were served with drinks already. This is unacceptable. The whole experience is just terrible. We decided it is not worth the wait time for this kind of service, and just left.  We will NEVER come back to this place! People, just look at the bad review from this place--you will see common complaints, which are obviously not being addressed by the restaurant at all. I do understand at rush hours the restaurant might be busy, but if you are constantly understaffed, for a long time, and have had customers complaint about this over and over, shouldn't you find ways to resolve this problem? The waiters/waitress may be very busy with multiple tables to be attended, but at least tell your customers that you will be with them, tell them you have not forget them, tell them your drink / food will be out shortly, or just do some thing to show your acknowledge to them.  From past experience, the food quality is okay, some are pretty good. But it is quite over priced for most items. For this kind of service, and the price range? We have better options. This is not a place to go.  I am glad we did not stay and left. Reading some other people's review here, where they were being ignored, food takes forever to come out, drinks takes forever to be refilled (if at all), and getting wrong orders, I am glad we left and able to avoid getting worse experience. But it already ruined my day!!!!!! Spend your time, and your money at some other place with better review. You deserved to be treated better than at this place. Run away from this restaurant if you could !!!"
Gloria A.,"Covina, CA",43,10,3,3.0,5/29/2017,Went for a friend's birthday dinner and the food was delicious.  And to our surprise we could have a full conversation because the music was not blasting.  The only thing was the staff could be trained better. Writing down orders for larger groups is something they might consider that way people actually get what they ordered.
Alyssa Marie O.,"Glendora, CA",1,29,85,5.0,1/11/2017,I always get served by the nicest people! I come here on many occasions. The monkey bread & chocolate chip pazookies are always amazing. The B.J's brew house burger is a favorite along with the fettucini alfredo with garlic knots!
Joshua P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",46,48,21,5.0,6/2/2017,"The food was meh, but it is to be expected. Plus in Bj's defense we did get very bland entrees, so that's not really their fault. But the beer, appetizers, and service were awesome. We were seated promptly and our waiter,  Ryan B, was excellent. Constantly kept up with his tables and provide fast and reliable service. Personally I'm not too big a fan of the food but the booze and bitches (jk jk) I mean are awesome. I look forward to our return... to get really really drunk lol. thanks again to Ryan B."
Michelle R.,"Rialto, CA",0,10,5,1.0,2/1/2017,"UPDATE: Went to get dinner on Friday. The wait time for a table was 30min, no problem. Wh an we were seated our drink and appitizer order was taken in a timely manner. After our appetizer was brought out our server came to take our order. That was the end kf the good servicr. We waited an hour to get our food! When it came out our food was cold. My husband's pizza came in the oven pan that it is cooked in which was COLD to the touch. My mother in laws food was cold and my food had a hair in it. (See picture below). When we got our food we hadn't seen our server for about 30 min. I saw him in another section while we were waiting for our food but then he disappeared. When we realized all of the issues with our food we looked for him and after about 10 minutes he appeared. I told him that there was hair in my food and he took the plate and said he'd get a manager. After about 10 minutes someone brought me a new plate of food which I did not ask for or want. About 10 minutes after that a manager finally came over and apologized. She said that she had been trying to make her way to our table. My husband told her that all of the food was cold when it was brought out and that there was a hair in my food. He didn't eat any of his pizza. She offered to remake it but we had already been there for almost 2hrs at this point (not counting the time we waited for the table) and were not in the mood to eat their food anymore. She removed the two uneaten entrees from our bill and took 50% off our lemonades, appetizer and my mother in laws food. Obviously this had been a horrible experience and we will not be back for dinner at this location.  Previous review: I get the lunch special to-go a lot from this location. It's close to work and I order on the app so that it is ready by the time I get there. It's a pretty good deal for the quality of the food you get especially compared to everything else close by. I get the half chicken club lunch special and it comes with thin cut fires (yum!) or wedges and soup or salad. The broccoli cheddar soup and chicken tortilla soup are both really good! The only thing I would say is to check your order before you leave. There are a few new people at the take out counter and they have almost forgotten to include my fries once and did forget to give me my fires last week when a coworker picked up the order. I would also go inside to pay or do mobile pay on the app to save time."
Jenn R.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2017,Service is awful. We waited 20min before going to the front desk to ask for a server to come to our table. We had not even been greeted by a server yet. After that we waited for the manager for almost 10min. Once she arrived she basically just said that she would put out order in for us. I am so disappointed.
Nanette O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,2,1.0,5/17/2017,"Tried to end my day at a familiar place and was disappointed. I waited for half an hour to be served a glass of water. As I tried to flag a server to inquire about placing an order with my server, I was unable to because not a single server acknowledged me. I walked out hungry and saddened to have received such poor service from a restaurant chain that I really like."
Dennis W.,"Azusa, CA",582,244,1332,2.0,7/2/2015,"Well, I don't know why the kitchen staff can't get the extra sauce concept on the pizza correct.  I've been trying to get them to put extra sauce on a pizza for months now and it just isn't working.  After having a conversation about extra sauce with my server, he made sure to put it in correctly. When the pizza came he came to the table to check it out. He looked at the pizza.  I looked at the pizza.  I took off some of the toppings. I asked him, ""Well, what do you think?""  He said, ""It doesn't look like there is any sauce on the pizza.""  I agreed.  He brought us extra sauce... So the crisis was averted. The manager came over and was very apologetic.  Five stars for service, but to constantly keep screwing up a simple request is bad. I love the pizza at other BJs restaurants, but it looks like I'll have to try something else to eat here or stop coming."
