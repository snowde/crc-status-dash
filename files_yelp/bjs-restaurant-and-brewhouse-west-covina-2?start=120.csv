Avin S.,"Corona, CA",208,93,581,4.0,4/1/2016,"Always come for their lunch specials, really affordable and filling at under $8.  Favorites are the baked potato with soup or half sandwich with soup and fries combos.  Food comes out fairly fast, but always tastes really good.  They have their own app now that lets you reserve a spot in line and place your order before you're even seated!  You can even pay using the app! Pretty cool."
Adriana H.,"Covina, CA",0,20,13,5.0,1/22/2017,"Ariana our server was so on it ! Food was awesome, every time I come I get good food. Very average on noise even with a football game on!"
Kaylee N.,"Kirkland, WA",381,1,,1.0,4/29/2017,"DONT EVER GO HERE. Horrible service for nothing. The waiter was rude, the food wasn't good and the place was gross. The waiter would disappear and wouldn't come back for a very long time. The waiter didn't refill our drinks, and the food took forever. Also the bathrooms were gross and I've been in nicer gas station bathrooms. Horrible place"
Tiff P.,"Covina, CA",51,15,8,5.0,7/6/2017,Stacey B was a great server! She was very helpful in our decision making for food and very nice. I got the fire roasted barbacoa chicken (from the enlightened menu) and my hubby got the new crispy chicken sandwich. Both were very tasty. Thanks Stacey for the great service :)
Aaron R.,"West Covina, CA",3,7,2,5.0,5/9/2017,went for my birthday dinner and I had an amazing time. Love my server David S. He was very courteous and very kind and attentive to our every need. thank you david

Candice R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",50,1,,5.0,7/28/2017,Awesome experience tonight having dinner with the family. Our server Nia made our night memorable
Anabela M.,"West Covina, CA",145,9,3,1.0,7/15/2017,"I recently went on my lunch break with my co-workers, and I was very disappointed. Mind you we are on a certain time frame where we had to be back to the office because patients were scheduled right when we get back from lunch. The waiters/waitresses were standing around talking while we were all trying to get their attention. In the end we asked for our check anxiously and the waiter that did get our attention rudely responded with ""uh I'll get your waiter right now, what's her name?"" and walked away. No team work what's so ever. Also, we didn't even know our waitresses name because she was also tending us is a rushing manner. As if she wanted to go back to mingling with her co-workers. I'm so disappointed and definitely will not be going back. Management really needs to crack down on customer service and team work."
Desarie B.,"San Gabriel, CA",6,4,,3.0,7/12/2017,"Went here 2 Sundays ago. We walked in the Manager was standing at the podium we made eye contact she did not smile she did not greet us. We got seated, within minutes we were greeted and our drink order was taken kudos. Moments later server came he was great all around on his game!  We ordered an appetizer food runner brought it out no napkins no plates disappointed again. Food was ok not to Bjs normal standards. Arcadia location seems to be on point. Managers always friendly especially if they make eye contact!"
Steven G.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,106,205,2.0,4/2/2016,"The service is decent, but the food is terrible. Ordered calamari to start, it was super greasy, and tasted burnt. We also ordered their chicken club sandwiches, which were unrecognizable as club sandwiches, it was a chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado, missing the signature middle peice of bread. It was also drowned in mayonnaise.  The pazookies are a decent desert. All in all, very lazy food, just come for the beer."
brenda V.,"Downey, CA",40,14,1,4.0,1/25/2017,Wine Tuesday is everything. Half off of wine glasses and bottles until midnight. Very good service at this particular location and I will definitely be coming back when I'm in town.
Mandi M.,"Montclair, CA",2,70,37,4.0,9/25/2017,"I wish i had got my servers name. She was great. A tall, thin black woman. Probably the most attentive server I've ever had at a bjs. She checked on us constantly and interacted with my son. I took off a star because my sons fruit tasted like onions. But i get it, it happens."
Sophia S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,4,1,2.0,1/18/2017,Totally grossed out by the food at bjs. We got wings  and four out of the 10 we're either bitten or we're the actual wing of the wing. No lie take a look at the pictures. When I told the manager she said it's normal they don't inspect everyone of the wings. I think the right answer should have been oh I'm so sorry. I am completely disgusted in the quality control here. Let me mention our server was amazing it is really sad he has to get the brunt of the kitchens issue.
Irma R.,"Duarte, CA",21,4,,1.0,7/10/2017,The last time I was here the service was sub par but this time I was sick by the time I got home. Beware!!
Andres G.,"Fullerton, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/9/2017,"We had a party of 13 and there was some confusion on the reservation, we were seated at a table for 7 so once we notified the hostess ( didn't catch her name) she was really great, got us a new table in no time, our server Destiny did a great job on making sure we were taken care of and though we hit a couple obstacles she was quick to correct them."
Nicholas F.,"Chino Hills, CA",473,10,2,5.0,2/16/2017,"I honestly think people lie about some of the reviews about this place. this place does their best to make sure everything is top notch. Yes its a big restaurant, yes you may have to wait an hour to be seated but  its because this place is always packed to the brim. My family and I love eating here, and unless you are cursing at an employee, which i have seen happen here, i have never seen an employee act unprofessional."
Julio C.,"Los Angeles County, CA",2,17,7,5.0,4/15/2017,"So,  I have been to this location several times and today I received the best service from and amazing server.  He told me things about the in house brews that I would have never known.  It was awesome how he knew and shared with us.  His name is Michael H.  I really hope management acknowledges him on his professionalism and knowledge."
Yvette P.,"West Covina, CA",17,12,6,5.0,2/13/2017,"I love coming here. The food is average but the service is always top notch. Our last server Steven P. was great, attentive and interacted great with our family. Enjoyed our Saturday dinner very much"
Chrissy J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",17,18,2,1.0,4/23/2017,"Was not going to post a comment after our experience at this location today, but I can not help it being my boyfriend has been throwing up for about an hour now and we ate there about 4pm. Our service sucked and the food was cold and mediocre to say the least. Obviously, resulting in acute food poisoning for my boyfriend who got the brisket burger.  Will not be going back to this location nor any other. We should have complained, but we had a new server and felt bad. Now we know better."
