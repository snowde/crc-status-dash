Brittany W.,"Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/30/2017,"I came here yesterday for my birthday and it was just a horrible experience. The broccoli and chicken on my alfredo was cold and I had to send it back. When I got it back it was still cold. ( I do believe they made an effort pretty sure it was a new plate) then the waiter left with my drink and never brought it back, not until I asked like 15 mins later. Then when he did bring my drink the ice was melted and it looked like it had been sitting. Everyone at the table tried it and agreed it was flat. I didn't drink it and left it at the table. One of my guest ordered a pull-pork and when they delivered it they told her they bring her the coleslaw in a minute that it was being freshly made but he never returned and she was too scared to ask. My table ended up ordering the new churro dessert they have and we bit into mini corn dogs (do they even sell that there?) it was so gross and funny cause they looked like churros. Honestly, I didn't eat my pasta and left hungry. I was truly disappointed on my birthday. All I wanted all day was pasta and a pizookie."
Raymond Y.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",98,21,17,5.0,3/12/2017,"I'm a regular BJ's brewery patron, this place was exceptional.. we received great service,    Roger   was attentive, accurate with our orders,and had great recommendations(beer). Our pizza was warm (usually get cold pizza from BJ's) and my son's mini pizza was super cheesy-- perfect! I will return to this BJ'S"
Babz B.,"Covina, CA",32,9,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Sunday afternoon girls answering the phone were twits... hung up on me twice... transfered to ""Take Our"" so that my Curbside order could be brought out to me....and no one seemed to know wth was going on! ...one star rating based solely on that part of the experience."
Bernadette T.,"West Covina, CA",0,8,,4.0,11/2/2016,"My husband and I enjoy BJ's Happy Hour specials because of their good value. My hubbie enjoys sliders and beer, I like their wings and a mixed drink.  We both agree that their pizza and salads are enjoyable. One of our favorite items here is their dessert Pizookie. We wish they would bring back the oatmeal raisin that we used to love! So in the mean time we settle for other flavor options...Ordering a hot freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream is unique to this establishment and keeps us coming back over and over."
Maria D.,"Westmont, Pomona, CA",0,2,,2.0,11/30/2017,"My friends and I usually stop by after works twice a week. The past four times we've gone, our waiters have been rude. I understand that they're perhaps understaffed and can't attend us as fast as possible but that's not even the problem that we've come across. The waiters just have no consideration for their customers and anytime we ask for something they take forever to bring it to us, whether it be water, ranch or ketchup. This past Monday we arrived at 11 pm and there was no one at the front desk to sit us down, waiters passed by and they all looked at us and didn't say a word. We stood for 15 minutes and no one helped us out. We sat ourselves down at the bar area and our waiter was a big tall white man with a beard, made no eye contact with us and seem aggravated. We switched from a booth to a table and he seemed mad because we did that, our food finally came out and we realized we had no utensils on our table, we had to steal utensils from a table further away from ours because our waiter never came near us for us to ask. We usually leave tips but this night we decided that enough was enough. There's another short guy with short black hair that works the bar area as well, he wouldn't know what hospitality was if it hit him on the face. Other than that, the food is good. It takes time to arrive but we usually don't mind. On one occasion they didn't bring out our plate of wings, 20 mins after our waitress came by and said there was an issue with the system and the order never reached the kitchen, at this point we were annoyed and asked her to not bring it out anymore. I hope this place retrains their staff or hires better staff. I love the food but that alone doesn't cut it if the staff is rude."
Karen P.,"Glendora, CA",5,5,,2.0,12/10/2016,"Usually decent.. today not so much .. slooooooowwwwwww service and it was not busy, saw plenty of servers.. .just not for us. So fun  watching people who were seated well after us get service.   We must've been in the penalty box seating ...."
Vic C.,"Duarte, CA",107,2372,8712,4.0,1/18/2015,"Came by this BJ's last Thursday around 11:40 pm to pick up a to go order. For it being a weekday, this place was pretty busy. The size of this restaurant location is bigger than the other BJ's around the area (Arcadia, City of Industry, Montebello). When I came to pick up my order, my food was just about ready for me to pick up (I made the order on line). This is what I ordered: Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad, $9.75 prior to tax- I have had this salad a few times already at other locations and am a big fan of it. Can't go wrong with the flavors and textures in this salad. The dried cranberries add a different texture and sweetness to this salad, along with the red grapes. The candied pecans and toasted pepitas give this salad another layer of flavor and crunch. The cooked Brussels sprouts also help to create another layer of texture to this salad and the kale is a nice dark green leafy to round out this hearty salad. It's nice that the dressing automatically comes on the side so that your salad doesn't get soggy before you arrive (this is also healthier so you don't over do the dressing in your salad).  Asian Chopped Salad, $9.75 prior to tax- I liked this salad with the mandarin oranges adding a bit of sweetness. I wished this salad was made with the dark green leafys though. There is plenty of chicken in this salad, but perhaps a bit too much of the crispy wonton strips. I would probably ask them to give me half the amount they use if I was to order this again.  Full Rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs, $21.95 prior to tax- This entree comes with 2 signature sides and so I picked the steamed green beans & seasoned vegetables. Both were cooked well and tasted great. But the ribs itself was a little dry. Although I got a little container of barbecue sauce, which was a nice flavor, it still wasn't a saving grace to those ribs. What a shame, especially at this price point. Sweet Pig Deep Dish Pizza, Large 14 inch ($20.05 prior to tax)- My husband and I were a little disappointed with this pizza because it was just too bread-y (if that can even be a word...). I wished the bread/ dough itself was seasoned because it was rather plain. The pizza itself was also on the salty side (but that's understandable since this pizza has ham and cheese). I thought BJ's is know for their pizzas (besides their beers) and so I was surprised that this pizza was a let down. I don't think I would order this or a pizza again in the future.  Service was very friendly when we arrived and picked up our pizza. The two employees helping us moved quick and efficiently.  By the way, this restaurant location is located in the same plaza as Walmart (neighborhood market), DSW and Petsmart. There is also plenty of parking and there is free Wifi here (that was rather fast when we came)."
Paul G.,"San Dimas, CA",0,10,,1.0,9/21/2017,5 minutes on hold no one knows if they have NFL network games. Its a sports bar right?Nexxtttt!
Lori O.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,20,1,5.0,6/2/2017,"We stopped in for a late lunch yesterday.  We sat in the bar.   As always the food was devine!  I had flatbread nachos and my friend had thin crust pizza.  I love their deep dish pizza and had never tried the thin crust. It was so good!  I don't know which I liked better, my old standby flatbread nachos or the thin crust pizza.  Our server was Jason W. (#280 - according to the receipt)  and he was amazing.  He made our fun lunch absolutely perfect.  I was just emailing with my friend this morning, and she mentioned how awesome Jason was, haha.  Thank you Jason for making our lunch memorable!"
Franklin L.,"Downey, CA",33,71,68,4.0,5/4/2017,"first time in this place, the experience was good, costumer service was fantastic, the food is great, we will be comeback for sure."
Javier M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,2,3.0,10/31/2016,Mehhh the service is fine but tell me if this looks appetizing? I understand it's a 16 dollar steak but at least make it look good.
Hugh B.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,18,2,1.0,6/24/2016,"Hey BJ-- Dude, your sauce free pizza is dry and awful, awfully dry, and just really kind of strange. You got something against pizza sauce?"
Andy L.,"Palm Desert, CA",0,6,3,5.0,9/2/2017,"Nice staffs here! Me and buddies went here for birthday and when I went home I found out I accidentally got over charged, I went back the manager Stacie was super nice and redound my money"
Demi W.,"Bakersfield, CA",10,9,1,5.0,4/22/2017,"This was a great meal. We loved our server Steven P. He was personable, made great suggestions and was an excellent attentive server. Huge restaurant and no wait probably because we ate there Easter Sunday. We are from out of town we were in town visiting our son who is LACo Fire Academy he appreciated the delicious meal."
Valerie Y.,"Davis, CA",168,1,1,5.0,3/29/2017,Had dinner at BJs for a girls night. Service was amazing! Waiter has great burger recommendations and was very attentive! Thank you Steven P!
Diana M.,"West Covina, CA",34,15,,1.0,1/22/2017,"Not bad if you like your salad w/wilted lettuce, your ""medium well"" steak undercooked & rare, and your main meal lukewarm because it all sits around waiting for someone to pick it up and deliver to your table. All six of us in our party had the same problem. Server was nice and manager removed three drinks from our tab in return for the 50  minute wait and room temperature food. The place was not even packed, so there was no excuse for this problem."
Isabel G.,"Glendora, CA",44,8,1,5.0,1/8/2017,The Extra Hot chicken wing are delicious and has the right amount of hot sauce and is strong in flavor should try. The reasons why I capitalized Extra and Hot is 1 it represents the delicious taste and 2 represents the hot taste. Love it so much .EG -9yrs old
Mike L.,"Walnut, CA",9,1,,2.0,3/9/2017,"The service was great but the unlimited soup and salad was a huge disappointment. First soup was in a plate size and second becomes in a tiny bowl. On top of it, the waiting was too long in between of just getting a wedge salad and soup."
Adrian B.,"La Puente, CA",214,24,111,4.0,7/5/2016,"This BJs is very spacious and gets parties in and out quickly, but without rushing the customers. Their intercom system allows for you to wait outside while they call you without fear of them skipping your party. The drinks are made generously with alcohol and their food was delicious! It did take longer than expected to get our food out, but it was a busy day. Great for large parties and celebrations! Saw a dual birthday party with balloons and presents so very celebration friendly."
Charles W.,"Corona, CA",0,2,,5.0,11/20/2017,this bjs was very friendly and with quick service. i ordered take out and one of the lady's michelle was very nice. will definitely be going back
