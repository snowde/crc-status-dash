Mark V.,"West Covina, CA",31,8,1,1.0,8/23/2017,"Very poor experience. The waiter seemed confused and lacked people skills, we could not get refills, received an uncut pizza, which we discovered was not the pizza we ordered. The servers seemed to be uninterested with our concerns."
Luis H.,"El Monte, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/15/2017,"i always come to this BJs for lunch and today was the worst service i got the waitress Alyssa was really rude when i decided to change the strawberry lemonade to a soda when it was way to sweet, we ordered a Deep Dished Ziti and never received the garlic bread that came with it."
Emily P.,"El Monte, CA",6,1,7,3.0,4/4/2016,"Seared Ahi Salad taste very very good. Top sirloin ...... Over cooked, too dry Guacamole and chip taste good. Service not bad, but not good enough."
Andrea A.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/12/2017,"My bf and I absolutely love bjs, but the service was awful didn't get attended till 20 min in. When given our desserts the girl literally put them on the table said nothing and walked away. (My bf and I are servers)"
Abhie C.,"Covina, CA",0,5,1,1.0,5/20/2016,"My first and mostlikely my last visit in this restaurant. Friday night we went there and we were on the waiting list, had to wait for 25 mins. No biggie for us, we waited until we were seated.  Seated, ordered a pasta entree and my husband ordered a burger with thin sliced fries on the side.  Drinks came in right after.  Ten minutes later the waitress just kept checking up if we doing fine. Typical but we appreciate this gesture.  Twenty minutes later, same thing, but this time she's trying to assure us that the food is coming soon.  Thirty minutes and still no food.  Forty minutes later, no food still.  Pushing to fifty minutes to maybe an hour, this time we are already getting upset. The nearby tables are almost gone and empty, and yet we still have no food. We had to call a nearby waiter to ask what happened to our food. He went ahead and also called a manager in our table.  All this times, I guarantee you, we were calm. A little bit upset but we were okay. We just want the damn food to come. Now the manager came and approached us, he apologized and offered a free dessert and a discount for the inconvenience. And we were ok we that, we appreciate the gesture. Soon after talking to him, our food came. But unfortunately, they got my husband's order wrong. They gave him wedge fries that looked horribly over fried, what he ordered were thin slices fry. How frustrating, now the manager again approached us and asked if everything is okay. And i said, that the order was wrong. He apologized and then went off to get us the right one.  To be fair though, my husband said that the burger actually tasted good. My pasta, not so much unfortunately :( Now at this point we were done eating and kindly asked for the ""complimentary"" dessert, it came fast and it was really delicious. We werent even done eating it, and the bill was already given to us. Funny how fast they gave the bill but they took an hour to get us our food. Checking the bill and all that, we noticed that they were charging us of the supposedly ""free"" (apology dessert), we then had to call the manager, yet again, for the 4th or 5th time to correct it. As you can already imagine, this is probably the one of the worst experience one can encounter. It was just a disaster.  We are never going back, maybe not in a long time."
Sonya L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,2,1,5.0,4/23/2017,"Kassey, service today was excellent!!! We appreciate all your help and professionalism. Even in the midst of chaos with orders, you were always attentive and sweet! Thanks for making our experience a great one! You are truly an asset to the company.  We look forward to coming back and connecting with you again!"
Lauren A.,"Covina, CA",236,177,404,5.0,10/7/2015,"This place is always good, the drink and food. Service is okay but they get super busy at time.  My fave thing to order is the deep dish pizza, calamari, and of course a bazookie to finding dinner.  Last night there was a problem with out order since a computer malfunctioned Soo they gave us free salads and free dessert. They were very nice and professional with the situation. The pumpkin cookie and icecream was very delicious! Get it while you can. The waitress also recommended a good wine me crema pinot noir. We've been coming to this location for years. Also if you are there to drink the bar section is nice try the scoobie snack!"
Jim K.,"Camarillo, CA",1371,503,3770,4.0,8/24/2015,"I have eaten at a lot of BJ's but this one is one more location to check off the list! We got very good service and the food was fresh tasty. Bill had the Mahi-Mahi or Shrimp Tacos you get char grilled  mahi-mahi and broiled shrimp tacos with chipotle mayonnaise and tossed in Santa Fe dressing, Napa cabbage, carrots, red onions and cilantro. With avocado cream sauce, fire-roasted tomato salsa and tortilla chips. I had the California Chicken Club, Layered with Applewood smoked bacon, avocado, melted swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and roasted garlic mayonnaise on grilled sourdough bread. yum!!! we didn't have any cocktails but in the past i always go for the Jeremiah Red. RED BEER! wanted a burger but needed a change and it was a great choice!"
Rebecca V.,"Walnut, CA",1,11,3,2.0,2/27/2017,"I was here last Friday (2/24/17) at around 4-430 and wasn't too pleased with the service.  My bf and I came in during happy hour and the hostess said we could sit anywhere in the bar area and offered us a booth that wasn't cleaned up yet. She said someone would come by to clean it so I accepted the booth. We sat down and waited for the table to be cleaned. While waiting, unnoticed the hostess was irritated and rolling her eyes as soon as customers turned away or as she turned away from them. This is a really bad look because she is the hostess. She is the first and last person customers come in contact with when eating here, it's unprofessional and it's rude; even though her gestures weren't towards me, it's irritating to see. Anyway. Our waitress came by, looked at the dirty table with plates and glasses on there and said ""let me get someone to clean this"". So we waited a little longer for her to grab a buser, but I'm sure she could have helped him since she's capable of doing so. After he came by and cleaned our table, the waitress came back to take our order only to realize we had no menus (: anyway.. got or menus and ordered our drinks and food. The food is always pretty good here which is why I like coming back. Asked for a side of ranch, 10 minutes later we got it. The restaurant wasn't too busy so the service was questionable to me. And if it was busy, and I missed something, then a Friday night during happy hour should have more staff available. Our waitress wasn't mean or rude in any way, but she wasn't very friendly either. Something's just weren't right during this visit."
Erik M.,"Orange, CA",3,6,,1.0,8/4/2017,"This is one of the worst BJ's I have ever been to, me and my girlfriend were here three days ago to get dinner. We were sat down at our table and we literally sat waiting to be greeted by a server for over 30 min. There were four groups that were seated in our immediate area and had their orders taken down and drinks brought out before we  were even addressed. So I got up and walked to the front desk and asked to talk to a manager. This Hispanic lady came out I don't remember her name but she walked out like we were bothering her. She asked what the issue was and I explained and I told her I'm not here for a free meal I don't want any complimentary services I just wanted the problem of the horrible customer service fixed. She replied with well I know you guys came hungry so let me take care of you and I apologize. Lol first off that's not how you respond to customers. Secondly she responded with a aggressive attitude and I told her that your attitude sucks first off and it's obvious nothing is going to happen. So I we took our business elsewhere and the manager didn't give two shits if we left or not. She walked right off like it was nothing. I love BJ's and I will continue to eat there but NEVER at the West Covina one. If you want to be ignored for a half hour then have the crappy management treat you like crap then go to West Covina. This review is for the people of yelp because I know nothing is going to happen to that manager and the customer service will not change. If your understaffed that's not our problem hire more people. She should not be in management acting that way. Plain and simple, if I could give them zero stars I would. She is a direct reflection of the other managers that work there and it's clear if she don't give a damn about customers the others don't either."
Tracie S.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",455,359,2344,1.0,8/18/2014,"Extremely disappointed in the communication/service at this BJ's location. Some of the people at my office wanted to throw a baby shower for one of our coworkers.  Since our conference room at the office was under renovation, we needed to find another venue to have the lunch.  Since we work near several restaurants, we decided to see if we can have it at one of them. We went to BJs and spoke to the general manager, Will a week prior to the event.  We explained to him what we were planning and asked him if they would be able to accommodate that.  We also explained to him that this was a work event and asked if we would be able to get split bills to make it easier for everyone.  Since they no longer automatically added tip to large parties, it really wouldn't make a difference.  He assured me that it was no problem and recommended that we pre-order everyone's food so that they would already know the name of the person, their food order, their drink order, and any special food requests they had ahead of time.  I thought this was a brilliant idea and agreed that this would make the process smooth and efficient.  He was really friendly and we felt at ease after speaking with him. We had 25 people RSVP to the shower and so we typed out everyone's orders and made sure to personally bring the print out to BJ's just in case they had any questions. Our party was scheduled for Thursday @ 11:30am and we brought the print out to BJs on Wednesday.  We asked for Will and gave him the print out to look over and see if the info we had was sufficient for what they needed.  He had a couple questions that were easily remedied and we were set to go.  He even complimented the fact that we had all info so organized and easy to follow. He indicated that they would have the food ready to go that day and we wouldn't have to waste time trying to order and they would have the checks all ready to go with each person's order and name on it so it would be easy on them and on us when it came time to pay the bill.  He even said he would be there the day of our event. The food and wait staff were all decent and we all got our orders in a timely manner.  However, when it came time for the bill.  The waitress said she didn't know anything about the split checks and that it would take time for them to do it.  We even spoke with the assistant manager, Cynthia that day and she was aware of the printout I had given Will.  She even commented that it was so well organized.  We asked to speak with her and instead of apologizing for not having the bills ready as promised by Will.  She said it was a hassle to do split checks and that their computer systems can't handle it and that's why it'll take longer. We asked if we could speak with Will since he was the one we had been dealing with and was informed by one employee that he wasn't working and that he was in the kitchen by another employee. We ended up waiting a good 30min for the bill and most of our party ended up leaving since we were all there during our lunch break and it was already well past our lunch.  The rest of the people that stayed had to deal with everyone's checks.  They also ended up charging some people incorrectly and were billed ""dinner"" prices when we all ordered lunch portions. It was past 2pm by the time we finished paying everyone's bills.  We had been looking forward to a relaxing lunch and instead, we left irritated and angry.  I was especially irritated because we were the ones going around getting everyone's orders the day before and making sure everything was as complete as possible.   We have a large office and many of us order food from BJs.  After this experience, I don't think I will ever go again.  I had always been really happy with the food from BJs, but after this, even the food can't win back my business."
LeBrock B.,"La Puente, CA",95,177,320,5.0,12/22/2015,"We came here on a Saturday night expecting the longest wait. We were seated within 10 minutes as we requested outside seating. They were still placing everything on the tables and moving around tables and chairs so we had to stand for a bit but we didn't mind. It was so cold that night so I was starting to regret our choice of eating outside. But as soon as we were seated it was amazing. The heater was right on us. There were only 2 other couples there which was extremely pleasant because there wasn't excessive noise like inside would have been. We ordered appetizers, drinks, and food and they all came to us very quickly!  The server was amazing! Very friendly and helpful. Overall this location is one of the good ones. Definitely our favorite spot for dinner."
Jamie G.,"West Covina, CA",24,2,,1.0,12/7/2016,"First off after being seat we were ignored for 10 until we were asked for drinks and by then we knew our order but the waiter told to take more time to decide, so we waited another 15 before he came back to get our food order. We then wait about 20 when a manager came to apologize because a system error in the kitchen causing slow orders being made so my gf and i understood , but when our food came it didn't taste right and I ended up vomiting my beef dip sandwich at the restaurant bathroom and my gf had gotten sick on the way home from eating the metatrain tacos which we blain and dry chicken meat. So I will never return here and I hope no one else gets sick from this place like I did...."
Jessica F.,"Bell, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/31/2017,"This is my favorite hang out in town. We eat & drink here on a regular basis. We ALWAYS have a good time with our favorite bartenders, Vince, Chris, Sarah, Brady, David, Ashley, Jeff and Andrew. They have a really good variety of food and if you're watching your calories they also have an Enlightened Menu. It's a good place to hang out and socialize."
Michael T.,"Fullerton, CA",0,11,,2.0,3/31/2017,"We came in at 230pm to start our Friday early right, we usually sit at the bar. We met the bartender Evelyn who was amazing. She made sure to communicate, give us happy hour prices and just all around a great bartender, and then, party pooper Vince the bartender took over with his down attitude, no service, and just made us want to leave, so we did! Don't get me wrong, I love BJ's but I pay for and want good service. Come on management...let's make sure your bartenders are at least sociable and attentive!!!"
Ann Marie L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",4,11,1,5.0,6/2/2017,Emy was our server today. She was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. The place was very busy for lunch but she handled us very well. All of our food was good. The Pizookie is a must! We would come back again and ask for Emy.
Kristen W.,"Ontario, CA",118,14,4,1.0,6/19/2017,"Came and ordered ribs for my husband and an appetizer Brussels sprouts with a side of fries. Brussels sprouts were burnt crisp, but no one ever checked back to see what the food tasted like. Poor service on Olivia the servers part. We waited forever and I finally flagged down another worker, but by then we had to leave. Manager came for no reason and didn't know how to resolve situation. Left hungry. Manager contacted me on yelp and said to contact them if I would like to share more. They should make more of an effort to contact me."
Christina B.,"West Covina, CA",105,12,3,5.0,9/3/2016,"Just had dinner with my cousin and sister tonight at BJ's and yhe food was great! Also the service was as well! Mr tall dark and handsome Steven was very helpful, sweet, and funny!  Thanks for a great meal! (:"
Eric W.,"West Covina, CA",140,4,1,1.0,10/31/2016,"Horrible service, cold food, and nothing to drink.  I've been a server for a long time, and have worked in many restaurants.  This server was the worst I have had. No people skills, nothing to drink!! We sat here for 10 15 min before being recognized at our booth, not that busy let me add. Also I only received one glass of water my whole meel, I spent money on alcohol, so did my wife, and did not get a chance to get a refill due to him not returning till he brought a box, and the check"
Christina C.,"Norwalk, CA",70,36,13,1.0,12/27/2016,"I've been to different BJ's locations many times and never had anything but a stellar experience. We chose to come to the West Covina BJ's as it was one of very few places that were going to be open at dinner time on December 24th that would have a suitable selection for my boyfriend (he's a vegetarian).  The moment we walked in, the smell that accosted us was horrific. It reeked of urine - almost as if someone had peed all over the rugs in the entryway, someone peed at the door, the floors were mopped with a dirty mop from the bathroom... I don't know - but it was strong and I almost wanted to leave based solely on that. But we stood by the desk waiting for the hostess to not only help us but acknowledge us (it took about 2 minutes for her to even look in our direction - no exaggeration on the time).  Our waiter was very good and attentive - I wish I'd have gotten his name because he was the only positive part of the evening. The BF ordered a custom pizza and I ordered the ribeye. The plate and subsequent replacement plates were filthy - fingerprints, grease, caked on food - the waiter was genuinely embarrassed about this. And no, the cutlery didn't fair much better as the BF needed a replacement set on those, too.  When the food finally arrived after what I'd consider a longer than normal wait time, especially based on what we ordered, it looked pretty good. My BF remarked that the pizza was very tasty and well made. My steak however left quite a lot to be desired: I ordered it at mid-rare and it bordered more on rare but that wasn't much of an issue for me. What I DID take issue with was the amount of un-rendered fat left on the steak and the gristle. For a ""prime"" cut of meat, I was very surprised and not in the good way. I cut it in half and was able to get a couple of bites in - it tasted okay, it was just very bland and underwhelming - but as I tried to cut my third bite, I hit some gristle and I hacked and sawed trying to cut around it and mauled at a good portion of the steak before conceding (and never managing to get my knife through it). I hate, HATE to send food back but for a dish at a premium price that I couldn't enjoy, I decided it needed to go back. I ordered a pizza in its place and after a considerable wait period again, it arrived and was decent. The manager checked in on us and again, the waiter was very good to us. I ate a little less than 2 pieces of the pizza before asking for boxes since my BF was long done. We'd been at the restaurant for about 2 hours at that point and were 100% ready to leave.  We will never be back to this location. Ever. We will drive further if we ever consider BJ's again and that's a big ""if."" This place needs its manager to get a fire under her ass about quality and maybe have the health department come in to check the cleanliness. Seriously disappointing."
