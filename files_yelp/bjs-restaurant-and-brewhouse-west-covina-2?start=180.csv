Ethan D.,"Victorville, CA",0,3,,5.0,3/14/2017,"So my girl friend and I were driving back home from big bear and decided to stop at Bjs. The ahi salad was great. Our sever Michael R was awesome! Very attentive, really personable! Honestly probably the best service We've had at a Bjs!!  Will be back!"
Rambo T.,"La Puente, CA",2,14,3,2.0,2/17/2017,"Bartenders were great, but my girlfriend and I sat in the bar area and the server gave us attitude after he took forever and I ended up order a second round from the bartender directly. I order the spinach dip appetizer and it came out about 20 mins later and the food has been more than 40 mins... good thing theres beer... well I'm waiting for it but I see beer."
Alicia J.,"Walnut, CA",346,6,2,1.0,7/29/2016,Okkay ready to do some math kids let's go 12 adults walk into BJs (long wait so we order some drinks at the bar) 45 min later we get sat At that time we have had 5 pitchers that pour roughly 4 beers so 5 x 4 = 20 now let's divide that by 12 that equals 1.6 We are finally sat and order another pitcher and a couple beers. Then the manager proceeds to tell us you guys are not aloud to drink anymore because we are loud and think we are wasted (let me remind you we are celebrating a World Series win). After arguing back in forth she won't let us drink for an hour and after we eat due to policy.  Let me call bullshit. I've worked in service industry for 6 years and I've never seen this kind of service. She was rude and hated us for being loud and outgoing  So if you wanna have a good time don't come here because they will shut you down really fast  ***let me add our waiter was awesome and food was good but going out to me includes the whole experience***
Abraham V.,"Montclair, CA",0,5,1,5.0,3/9/2017,"They did n excellent job from sitting us down , serving us and  checking if everything was ok . The food was really good and our server by the name of FRANK took very good care of us  . Thank you"
Danielle S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",4,58,28,4.0,5/21/2016,"I apologize for the extremely long review in advance!  But something has to be said.  My boyfriend and I came to dinner tonight at the BJs at the Eastland center.  The restaurant was packed which is to be expected for a Friday night.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive even though he was extremely busy running around everywhere.  The reason I took off a star is because when the server (different from our waiter) brought us our food she had a hard time fitting my bfs plate on the table because his appetizer was in the way (he ordered potato skins and they come on a really long plate; also we were sitting at a small booth for two). She finally made it work and when she walked away she made an extremely rude and insensitive comment.  At first we kind of brushed the comment off and tried to enjoy our food. Then, the more time passed and the more we thought about it, the more it upset us. We chose to go to BJs over 3 Vinos for dinner, and had every intention of enjoying a nice dinner after a long week. We make that choice just to have our night ruined by a rude server.  Eventually we asked to speak to the manager.  At first the assistant manager came to our table and when we told him what happened he went to get his supervisor. A few minutes later the restaurant manager came to our table and apologized for the incident, let us know our meal was ""taken care of"" and encouraged us to call him directly if we had any other concerns.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the way the manager Louis handled the situation. He apologized so many times and did so much for us that I even started to feel bad for saying anything.  We had ordered dessert to go (we  pizookies!) and boxed up over half of our entrees and both of our appetizers because we lost our appetites. Louis comped our entire meal including the to-go desserts, AND brought us dessert to enjoy before we left.  While we were waiting for our to-go desserts the server and executive chef came to our table to apologize for the comment.  This was going to be our last time at this BJs but after being taken care of so well by Louis I will make sure we return.  Neither of us expected the sincerity we received from Louis, the server, and the executive chef OR for anything (let alone our entire meal) to be on the house. We really just wanted to bring it to their attention and from the way Louis reacted it seemed as thought this was not the first time this server had an incident like this."
Anthony R P.,"Covina, CA",64,209,40,2.0,12/4/2016,Overpriced basic food. Probably good if you want to have some drinks and watch a game(which I don't do surgery if lol) but eating here is meh. I only come when someone wants to go here. Which is rare.
Slick V.,"Azusa, CA",76,62,98,5.0,6/15/2016,BJ's is always the best spot for good food drink sports games and socialing in a nice environment with your friends. Decore is dark nice modern clean and spacious. Ambience and atmosphere is very happy friendly welcomeing and yet private too.  Food is great love the wings California chicken sandwich is my favorite with a nice pint of Blonde. Can't say anything bad about this location.
Liam C.,"San Bernardino, CA",32,1,,5.0,3/14/2017,Haven't been to bjs in a while but I'm glad I did. I went in this week and had the California chicken club food was great and service was even better! My server was Michael. He said was new and was he the best server I've had at bjs! Definitely will be asking for him again!
Claudia H.,"South El Monte, CA",15,5,,2.0,5/3/2017,"The worst service ever, we keept getting other peors food. Waiters and waitresses didn't know what they were doing. We received our appetizer and food at the same time and did mot get the condiments we requested...Dersert took 15 minutes. Will not  come here again. Will go back to tbe Montebello location!."
Toni Angela O.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,,3.0,4/15/2016,"I'm making this review while I'm eating my BJ's food at home. My family and I arrived at BJ's right before the dinner rush walked in, at 6:40pm, and waited 15 minutes or less to get seated.  A few minutes later, our waitress came to get our drink orders. We told her we were ready to order: 1 small bbq chicken pizza, 1 side Caesar salad, 1 beer, 1 root beer, and waters. Our drinks came right away. While waiting for our food, my husband began feeding our 1 year old daughter. Not too long after, the family sitting in the booth adjacent to us (who got there after us) got their appetizers. And then so did the booth on the other side of us.  My husband had to ask the waitress for his salad. It arrived after that, but it was the size of an entree and hardly had any dressing. He could barely eat it because it was so dry.   By 7:20, the same family who go their appetizers had moved on to their entrees and here we were sitting with a dry salad and all out of baby food. The place was packed and people who weren't even there when we arrived were eating. The whole time our waitress kept checking up on our table and telling us the food would be out shortly. Well...after 35 minutes of waiting, my husband stood up and spoke to a manager and told her our situation. Of course, the pizza came while my husband was with the supervisor.  I told the waitress I didn't want the pizza anymore and also complained about the salad. Instead of apologizing, she told me she saw my husband was speaking with her supervisor so she would leave the pizza here for now. Also, that she heard my husband order a Caesar entree, not a side salad. The only apology we got from our waitress was after the manager had stepped in. The manager comped our meal and we took it home. We were out the door around 7:40pm (1 hour after arrival) angry and hungry. How good or bad your experience here goes really depends on your server. Hopefully this horrible experience doesn't happen to you."
Kevin D.,"Pomona, CA",157,2,3,5.0,2/14/2017,"Great customer service, Delicious food along with a great ambiance all brought to us by our great server Vivian. Thank you very much will be lookong forward to returning."
Sandy C.,"Arcadia, CA",0,47,6,2.0,1/17/2017,"First let's start with the service. Employees are very unprofessional here even though they look older and mature. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I were seated at the booth right in front of the computers where they input food orders. The entire time we just kept hearing the girl employees gossip and talk about their nails and the males asking each other ""How'd 32 tip you?"" Very unprofessional. The hostess also walked around while texting on her phone and servers were fooling around a good amount of the time.  As for the food I was also not impressed. The portobello mushroom salad we got looked like there was little to no effort put into making it. The goat cheese was not spread out at all, they just threw on two or three giant balls of it clumped together and huge splices of portobello mushrooms laying on the top. Calamari is usually my go-to here, but their portion is very inconsistent every time. I will say they give a good-sized portion of mozzarella cheese sticks though. We also ordered the guac and bacon burger, but sad to say, in-n-out burger is even better than this. We took it to-go because we felt bad leaving it there, but when we got home we trashed it anyway because we couldn't even force it down our throats. Their think crispy fries were made very well though, but honestly that's about it."
Andrew T.,"West Covina, CA",21,25,5,3.0,1/16/2017,"BJs is hit or miss with service and food. Sometimes service is great and others it's not. It just depends on who you get that day. The last two times I was here I ordered a pizza with extra cheese. Each time there was bald spots on my pizza. Maybe each time they got extra confused with light? It made me feel as if there was a cheese shortage right now? Another recession? I'm also not impressed when the waiter takes your order and not writing it down!!!! It's annoying to me! I'm not impressed primarily because there's always something wrong. 5 min later, ""you ordered a coke right?"" Umm I do t know what did you write down?"
Jenny B.,"West Covina, CA",72,22,7,1.0,7/14/2016,"Tried curbside service this evening, and although the convenience of our food being brought to us seemed like a plus on the positive side,  it turned out to be the worst idea. After giving BJ'S a 20 minute head start on our order, we had to wait an additional 20 minutes in the curbside parking area for our food to be brought out. The customer service was decent, however the food was awful. We ordered a bison burger that was served with a rock hard bun, and cold French fries. And a kids dinner of mini corn dogs and veggies (celery and carrots). We were given no condiments with our meal. We also had ordered a monkey bread pizzoki which was hard and cold. I would have rather spent the same time at a table and received my food hot, than outside in the heat and cold food. Not worth the money spent, and very disappointing."
Connie O.,"Pomona, CA",36,3,,1.0,7/13/2016,"Didn't expect the shitty service we got here,tables werent getting cleaned and when finally was able to get a table server looked like he wasn't even happy to be working here....last time we come to this BJ I don't recommend it at all..food not the greatest very disappointed"
Eleanor S.,"Yucaipa, CA",0,13,1,1.0,1/9/2017,"So I came on Thursday 1-5-17. It smelled horrible, like if they used a dirty mop to clean the floors. I knew I should have walked out as soon as i smelled that nasty smell. I've gone to 3 other Bj's at different locations. So far this was the worst service ever. So the waitress was blah. And we always order a nutty brunette house beer. It was flat. I told the waitress that the beer was flat and she said that the brew master  had said that it was fine and that they don't know where we usually go and that they are the only ones that brew their own beer. Well I think if a customer is complaining that the beer is flat, it is obiously flat. San Bernardino, Moreno Valley and victor villes bj's has been the best bj'S so far, in my opinion. All their devices have been A1. I've just had better service else where, so I expecting the same service. Clearly, not every city is the same."
Alex C.,"West Covina, CA",8,131,1657,3.0,4/17/2016,Came for a drink with some compadres.  Been a while since I had been here.  Service was good.   from what I remember service always took a while.   It was a school night so I ordered the light switch not bad and refreshing.  I was one and done but I'll be coming back soon. Keep the light on for me.
Christopher G.,"Covina, CA",1140,17,43,1.0,8/26/2016,Worse place ever had crappy service had to complain to the manager 3 times about how bad the service was. Food was late. Drinks we're flat. Servers were bad!!!! Not to mention they had ample time to accommodate a big party.  DO NOT COME HERE
Belinda M.,"Bellflower, CA",0,3,2,5.0,9/11/2016,"Truly enjoyed my sons' 18th birthday celebration!   The hamburgers were amazing along with their famous pizzookie.  Thank you, Emy, our waitress for being so funny & helpful.  We would come back just to see you!!!"
Pink F.,"Montebello, CA",2,19,120,3.0,11/25/2016,soups are so salty and waitress keep getting wrong order beside that everything runs smooth
