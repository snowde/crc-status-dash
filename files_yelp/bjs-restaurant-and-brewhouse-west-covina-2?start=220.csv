Anthony R.,"La Puente, CA",0,30,1,2.0,11/2/2016,They'll get a 2 star rating until they ban kids from the bar area. I understand there's tables in the bar area but sometimes you'll be waiting and there's a family of 5 and just the dads drinking. Or the damn kids like screaming. In my opinion take that to the dinning room I'm here for some beers and fun.
Carlos F.,"Azusa, CA",79,294,99,4.0,12/30/2013,"I'm sure that the food is still the same: not good.  I did have what I love most: Amazing wings.  Their Belgian ale, called the Grand Cru, was amazing as the first time, and came in at $10 for the 750. I got to keep the bottle :) I also tried their pot stickers, and they were plump and deliciously filled, though I believe them to be pre-frozen.  I'll still keep coming to this place, if even for these few things done right! I've been reluctant to give this place such a favorable rating, but hot dang, the beer and wings are good! On a side note: the American beer noted on my earlier review is called the Brewmaster's Reserve Imperial Red Ale."
Ravene A.,"Whittier, CA",225,9,,5.0,11/25/2016,"It's my first time here! The employees and managers at this place are awesome! We asked for a pizza without mushrooms, and they brought our pizza out WITH mushrooms. :( our waitress noticed immediately that the cooks had messed up and offered to remake it, but it was no big deal and we just picked the mushrooms off! A few minutes later the manager came out and offered us a free dessert! They were so attentive and made sure that we were happy! We will be coming back here all the time!"
Simon L.,"Rosemead, CA",69,5,,1.0,7/2/2016,I wish I could give this place no stars. We literally got seated and told our waiter would be right over. 30 minutes later and no waiter showed up. We ended up just walking out and going next door to Chili's.
Tina H.,"Temple City, CA",216,125,179,4.0,9/6/2016,"I haven't stepped in BJ's after graduation from college, and I don't really recall too much about their food since I am not a beer fan. It's a good experience this time. My bf and I ordered chicken pesto pizza and fried portobello since we are not too starving. The fried portobello taste good but the portobello is relatively small and dry. The pizza is really tasty. I love the crust and bf love the topping, and we both like the satisfying size of it cuz it's huge. Overall, the service is nice and environment is decent."
Noemi C.,"Azusa, CA",3,7,,1.0,12/2/2015,"Horrible BJs location! I came in for lunch with my mom and friend and they messed up our order, the waitress was rude, they brought back a burnt burger, they claimed they didn't have a carseat sling (when I had used it a few days prior), and when I contacted headquarters they claimed that I received courtesy cards and that the manager spoke to me, which is a complete lie!!!! Seriously this is the most unprofessional business I have ever dealt with! DONT GO HERE!"
Leila A.,"La Puente, CA",11,55,1,2.0,7/24/2016,"The food is good, but the service needs improvement.  The servers need to smile and at least pretend they like their jobs. It will help get better tips."
Abigail R.,"Covina, CA",199,3,,1.0,7/1/2016,If i had the choice of giving no stars i would. Literally no waiter came up to me to even offer a drink. And im still waiting. And its been 30 minutes. This is fucking ridiculous. I even tried calling for one and they straight out ignored me
Teena N.,"Covina, CA",31,5,,2.0,3/27/2017,"We hadn't been here for 2 months as the last time our order was really messed up.i ordered something pretty simple a veggie Burger on sourdough and a side of mashed potatoes instead of fries. I placed my to-go order at 8:14 was told 10-15 minutes...arrived at 8:30 called both numbers ..no answer...called again and was to yes we'll bring it right out..after another phone call they brought it out at 9:05... cold ,very cold and soggy....yes I could have gone in but have been sick and hadn't brought a sweater!! Food less than standard and service??? Won't be back for a long while..."
Rene G.,"Chicago, IL",53,167,116,2.0,8/26/2016,"I hate to be mean, but this place has nothing similar to a Chicago deep pizza as stated in the menu. Atmosphere was great, appetizers a lot to choose from and all good as well. Had a cucumber jalapeno Margarita. good as well. Pizza? ummmm.....I'm from Chicago and this was nothing like a Chicago style deep dish pizza. not even a full twist.  More like Pizza Hut's pan pizza with little to no sauce. The crust and ingredients were good, but other than that not much to say. Should have tried something else, but oh well."
Laramie L.,"West Covina, CA",117,40,27,3.0,10/26/2016,"It was a weeknight, so it wasn't crowded, but service was slow.  Food was so-so... I remember liking my food more before, but my salad had brown pieces in it and my hubby's beer didn't come out till 30' later..."
Elena Z.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,47,19,1.0,6/20/2016,"Marlena was really bad. I never call out anyone on reviews but this girl should not be a server. At one point she walked away and rolled her eyes! I would understand if we were a difficult/demanding table but that was not the case. Everything we ordered was missing something or was incorrect. My friend asked for extra dressing on the side and didn't get it, I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic and my dish had tomatoes, my other fried asked for cheese and it was never brought. I won't be returning."
Rick M.,"Whittier, CA",0,7,2,1.0,6/21/2016,"I promised I would never write a bad yelp review no matter how awful service I may get.  Well... thats about to change... by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. To make matters worse it was a birthday dinner that was messed up. 1. Table went without soda and water refills for 15-20 minutes, and glasses stayed unfilled for the majority of the dinner.  2. Empty glasses and empty appetizer plates were left at our table for 45 minutes. Multiple servers and runners came to our table to drop food off but not one bothered to pick up a single dish. We ended up just moving the empties over to the empty space on the table connected to ours. (Picture included) 3. A bug in one of the drinks and the server said ""oh you don't like floaties?"" No sorrys or apologies, just said to move it over to the empty space next to our table and he brought out another.  4. We ordered 3 pizzas for our table. One came out warm. One semi warm and one completely wrong. Our pizza came out with olives and chicken, both of which were not ordered. It felt as if the waiter was confused as to why we would be complaining about getting extra toppings, not even considering that my girlfriend is allergic to olives.  5. We sent the pizza back to be remade since there was no way for my girlfriend to eat it. By the time we got our pizza the way we initially wanted it, all the other members of our group were already done eating. I can honestly say I wont come back to this particular BJs ever again. I wish this would have happened on a different day and not on my girlfriends birthday."
Jack N Mary Z.,"Glendora, CA",295,471,1287,3.0,12/5/2014,"Okay, as we all know, where there's beer there is noise. LOTS OF NOISE!!!  so, what's the big deal?  Well, If I'm just there for dinner, and ONLY dinner... its so annoying. The way the restaurant is build, its open and all the noise from the bar travels throughout.  Additionally, the wait is long sometimes.  Other than that...  we are usually lucky with the waiters.  Very social and sweet."
Maribel C.,"La Puente, CA",1,16,16,2.0,3/10/2017,"I get it, it's Friday night and it's busy as hell... I expect to wait a little longer than usual no biggie. Our waitress was nice and took our order pretty quick after we sat. Then the problems began, we were a party of 5 my sister and ordered a Med pizza no tomatoes. We wait, it comes we have tomatoes, we tell the waitress, she apologizes and bring us another pizza about 15min later then... no pepperoni!!!! What the hell! We wait another 20 min!!!! I'm not one to complain and be rude because I'm in customer service myself but this was not ok... by the time we finally got the ""correct pizza"" which was the 3rd one I was over it. I had picked at everyone's food and was full, I asked for a box and got it almost 10min later. We also ordered desert which we never even got!! The manager was apologetic, compt us the pizza and gave us a discount on our other meals. I really do appreciate the discount but it still wasn't worth the wait. Don't know if I'll be coming back to this location."
Joanne A.,"CRANBERRY TWP, PA",74,234,841,4.0,12/26/2014,"When I think of BJs, I instantly think pizookie!  I'm pretty sure this place invented pizookie (cookie baked on a pizza pan topped with ice cream).  Of course there's a regular serving that can be shared and there's a pizza size for a big party.  It is unlike any cookie sundae or sundae desserts you've ever had.  Definitely indulge and try to save space for this dessert.  The server will usually ask you in the middle of your meal if you want it, so that they can start making it.  The new salted caramel is my fave although all of them are delish! They are also known for their pizza.  The pizza dough is soft yet the edges has some crisp to them.  It's not like a hard crust on the edge, so you can definitely eat it even those who usually don't eat the crust.  The pizza is not greasy.  Their flatbread and thin crusts are also very good.  I've never had the deep dish as I think the regular pizza has enough dough.  My family's fave is the classic combo hand-tossed pizza.  It's almost a meat lovers with mushrooms.  They definitely have an extensive pizza menu. I've never tried their steak or seafood but my family says they like the food in general.  They have a big bar area, lots of TVs and a big space.  Definitely great for watching sports and celebrating birthdays, etc. I can see why the service can be deemed inconsistent as not all servers are alike.  Luckily, the times I've been here, the servers I've had were great: friendly, attentive, knew the menu.  There was no wait the last time we went for Christmas Eve, but other times there is a long wait esp during the summer and game nights."
Pete V.,"Beaumont, CA",0,61,19,1.0,11/20/2015,"Bartender Mike needs some serious guest service training! Ask what I wanted then walked away while i was in mid sentence ordering, only to help someone else. Served a sour beer to the party next to me, guy complains he then pours another beer and damn near sticks his nose in the beer smelling it to make sure it was good! Wow! Not a good look! Female server walks up to the server well says the beer she's picking up to serve to guest seems warm. Bartender proceeds to tell her to serve it, it's not gonna kill them they can deal with it! Wow!! This guy should not be behind a bar! He's a manager's nightmare!"
Nick S.,"Covina, CA",0,50,,4.0,10/10/2016,"The food is great, drinks are ok,and the service is mostly excellent.  The  lines to get in well that's a good sign very popular place to go.  I only come here for office parties ,or someone's retirement party now. Trying to go on a date here it's too  loud not as bad as Fridays restaurant.   The pizzas are one of the best items they have ,and if you order beer get it fresh from the tap....."
Art R.,"El Monte, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/30/2017,"Just had dinner here one of my favorite places to eat. Has the prime rib something I normally don't eat. It was cold, when I order my pizookie to go it was all crumbled in a to go container and the ice cream was almost all melted."
Monica H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",3,53,82,1.0,11/23/2015,"I had late lunch with my son here. He ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo which came with bread. The bread was burnt so asked for another and it was the same way. Overall, customer service was bad."
