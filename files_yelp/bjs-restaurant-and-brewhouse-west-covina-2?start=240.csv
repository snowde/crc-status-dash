Harry H.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,5.0,6/21/2016,"These five stars are for the restaurant industry employees. This post is for all you ""self entitled"" people who think its someone else's job to make you happy. Yeah, you go out to eat and want good food, good service, but nobody owes you anything. Thing's sometimes don't go right,it's called life get use to it. I mean, what type of person are you that gets mad over food. It's food! Its not your house, your family or your health. I'll be damned if my food doesn't come out right and ask for a manager and leave a bad review on a server who didn't even cook your food. It's real simple, want thing's done specifically to your liking? Stay home and cook it yourself and then serve yourself, that way if anything goes wrong you can complain to yourself about the food and service. Keep it up servers and cooks, there's just unhappy people out there who like well done steak's!"
Krystal M.,"Ventura, CA",29,30,19,5.0,9/12/2016,"This place is awesome. Great food, great lunch specials, great beer and amazing service. Everyone seems to really like their job which makes for a better experience for their customers. I typically get the lunch combo half asparagus and portobello salad and half the California Club flat bread. SO good!!! Keep up the good work!!!"
Chantal S.,"Corona, CA",3,5,14,5.0,8/28/2016,Steven P. was such an awesome waiter! He was really attentive and made sure we were taken care of the entire time. Our group was really big and kind of disruptive which is usually an issue in family restaurants but he was still constantly checking up on us and being very sweet! Overall great service and food! would definitely come here again!
Joseph S.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,2,2,1.0,7/12/2016,"The night manager at bjs in west Covina was very rude and un professional. I was there 7/11 at around 530 I ordered a deep dish pizza and a float. I was disappointed with it the pizza so i did not eat it. So when it came down for the check the server said i still had to pay for the drink. I said no so the manager came over and said "" did u enjoy the drink and said thats y u had to pay"" then he said if i dont pay i am stealing and came out and wrote down my plate number and make of car then proceeded to wave goodbye with a kiss. He embarrassed me in front of my company."
David S.,"Baldwin Park, CA",16,63,66,4.0,9/29/2015,"I am a pretty hard man to please when it comes to customer satisfaction, but tonights experience was nearly perfect. Walking in the hostesses said hi and looked at us weird (might have been because I was wearing a sweater and bball shorts) and then finally I told them we were a party of two.       Once seated, I grabbed the menu that was given to me. It was immediately noticeable of the cleanliness of it. Greasy stick trap. It is my biggest pet peeve to have a dirty menu.      The waitress was amazing, got what we  wanted, when we wanted it. Fast, friendly with a smile. Bwthrooms were clean, sad design but it works.       Nor too much to complain about her, dirty menus, the posession of your daughter made it easier for youbto accept"
Patricia T.,"West Covina, CA",132,2,,1.0,4/18/2017,"This place is one of my favorites to eat, but i recently went to dinner with my family and we got seated and waited for 30 mins and never got menus or anything so we got up and left, all while the waiters stood by just talking to each other."
Jennifer R.,"Pomona, CA",0,5,2,1.0,3/22/2017,"I understand places like this are very busy, I understand the workers get frustrated with customers, I also understand big parties are a bit more frustrating then usual because of multiple orders. Our food was cold, the drinks were late, one order was so late we had all finished eating and then it came to our table so we had to ask for it to go. Once we let the manager know we were unhappy with the service and that we specifically asked not to be comped of any meals because we still ate it, the waiter comes back with one big check with some meals comped. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it, but the waiter then had to separate the orders, which was obviously frustrating him as he shook his head constantly and tossed chairs around at the table he sat in to figure all the orders out and which ones we comped. I'm guessing there was a lack of communication because before we started ordering food we let them know ahead of time there was 4 separate orders. Overall we don't blame our waiter, we let multiple staff members know of missing food and drinks, the manager ended up having ME separate our checks and just left the waiter to deal with the rest.  Your staff is only as good as the people or person running the establishment. If management couldn't help much, don't expect anyone else to."
Freya F.,"La Puente, CA",35,8,,2.0,9/2/2016,"First time there, so will perhaps give other locations a try.  Food was horribly bland. I ordered food that is hard to screw up, yet it wasn't good and only half my order was prepared as requested. Waitstaff was nice enough but service was rather slow for reasons I could not ascertain."
Olivia C.,"Las Vegas, NV",64,8,,4.0,10/15/2016,They got us in quickly on a Friday night as a group of 17 without a reservation. Ivan was our server and was amazing!
Rick V.,"La Puente, CA",0,9,4,4.0,3/21/2017,"Had lunch there yesterday, as always great tasty appetizers and my beef dip was delicious! Our server Steven did an excellent job too. Would always recommend bjs!"
Sandy K.,"Whittier, CA",3003,1575,9402,4.0,4/10/2013,Came in for  a luncheon with eight of my clients.. We were seated at a booth but it was to tight so the waitress put together several tables to accommodate our party. The decor and openness of this BJ's is really eye appealing and the bar is cool looking. Menu at BJ's is large  but they list the calories which I actually think is beneficial.  I ordered the Thai mango chicken avocado salad and it was yummy and tasty - about half the calories of some to the other salads but delish. The service was spot on and I was surprised BJ's didn't tack on a automatic gratuity to the tab since it was a larger party. The total came out to just under $200.00 and everyone enjoyed the food.  I would definitely come back again to BJ's for a business luncheon or personal  meal.
JJ J.,"Glendale, AZ",0,13,13,2.0,3/19/2016,"We've eaten at other BJ's before and have always enjoyed our meal. This location I hope is the only exception. As normal we were prepared to wait for a table.  For a good meal its worth it but not at this location. The wait for our meal was over 45 minutes. It must have sat in the kitchen for a while because the Brussels sprouts were slightly warm, and the ""loaded"" baked potato wouldn't even melt the butter/sour cream and  the ribs were very dry. My wife has the chicken tacos which were cold also.   In all, it was a very disappointing dinner. We'll be avoiding this location in the future. The service seemed adequate for how busy it was but if was better our meal would have been warm."
Joshua L.,"La Puente, CA",54,7,1,2.0,2/28/2016,"Not the best service  First we sat underneath Ac vent and it got cold.. I thought hey we will wait for the waiter to come to take our drinks and let him/her know if we can switch seats... 10 mins pass no one came and we decide to move the next booth.. One seat over.. Then 10 mins later a waiter came took our drinks and apologize because he thought we sat in different booth and didn't see anyone there... Ok we understand took our drinks and food order since we already decide what to eat.  Then a new waiter came in and said she taken over and I guess this was her section.. Came off a little rude didn't care having great time with my family Then our food came out and we order pasta and was suppose to come with bread and the guy who bought our food we ask him and he said oh the bread is coming out, ok we ate and half way thru our meal we notice no one has check up on us or brought over the rest plate  .. So I had to wave a different waiter and ask him.  15 min later then our waiter came and brought us the rest of our plate... By then we finish or drinks and she didn't come by to ask if we like a refill. I just ask for the manager Manager came buy and did her manager thing which was really good .. Kudos to Kathy!!! very professional, apologize ... Then she left, 10 mins after she left no one still check up on us or gave us a refill, ... Waive another waiter down and ask for the manager again  Ok waiter mess up, there still solutions to fix the problem, at least come by and still check up on us.. It doesn't even have to be you the table behind us had a different waiter and he still can check up on us in case we scared her off or being that annoying customer that all waiter get and everyone decide to avoiding this table.. I just want another beer and so did my family All restaurant problems can be fix.. There is a solution don't worry"
Milani A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",35,1,,2.0,4/10/2017,"My family and I went there last night. I have to say I'd rather not go to this BJs again. I went to the bar and ordered a beer. Once I had the beer it was warm. The worker at the bar and the guy manager there even said that people have been complaining about it. I even overheard one of the waiters come and say someone wanted a new beer because theirs was warm. So the manager tells me he's going to go and check out the back and see what's going on. After 10 minutes he never came back but I was being called to my table. So when I went to my table I told my waitress about the situation. She was apologetic and said she would see what's going on and offered to get me a new beer. About ten minutes later she comes back, with no new beer, and says that the manager and whoever else is saying that they haven't heard of that problem at all! I kind of got offended as if they were calling me a liar! So long story short another manager came to talk to me I got a free beer like an hour later..I don't care for there customer service.."
Alexandra R.,"Glendora, CA",113,108,175,5.0,7/14/2016,"I know we've been here plenty of times by this time pretty much all was great! Frank was our server and he spoiled us all night with attentive service and patience as we figured out what to order. He knew the old beer that I used to get...""lindenmens framboise""? It's a beer that tastes like a cranberry wine. I just like how he kept checking on us and submitting each order as we asked for it. It was spaced out allowing us to conquer one plate at a time. Thanks to Frank for his great service!"
Lourdes R.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,16,15,3.0,8/11/2016,"My god I came for a late night dinner... I waited for two hours for my food. Don't get me wrong drinks were fast to come but dam people I came to a restaurant.... To eat!!!! Not drink if I wanted to drink I might as well gone to a bar. I was starving ... Well after the whole ordeal and a couple of drinks later this great waitress comes by says ""hey sorry about the wait but here are some wings"" so bill comes after the food I waited so long for and the check comes out to be about 70 bucks let me tell u I was going to check in before I got here to get a free appetizer I mentioned to the manager the situation she took of the appetizer off as a courtesy ...  I was originally going to check in into Yelp for and bam a slap in the face she said oh u can't do that so was it a win or lose situation ?"
Lorena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,37,170,5.0,1/27/2016,School fundraiser are the best when they are at this BJ's. Service is always great here & food never gets old. Even with a school fundraiser a pitcher of light switch & blonde is a must. And the kids can never leave without sharing an Oreo Pizookie.
Alyssa L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",1,43,8,2.0,1/15/2016,"Never really cared for BJ's and tonight just valid my feelings. Came here for both of my aunts birthday. (Their choice) Friday night so of course it's busy. Our server was kind, but seemed way overwhelmed. He only took half of the tables order and left and came back later to order rest of the table. (So our whole table was not given food at the same time) My aunt ordered pizza, the pizza was basically just bread and cheese. There was no pizza sauce in sight. I ordered chips and guacamole and their new Jalapeño Cucumber Margarita. The chips were STALE. The guacamole was bland. The grocery store guacamole has more flavor. Our waiter never came to check on us and ask how our food was. He refilled our waters in the beginning, but pretty much disappeared after serving us our food. Another person came over to drop off the ""birthday pazookies"" and left. Uhhh I guess they weren't in the mood to sing? I'm not sure. But yet on the other side of the room we hear a waiter singing happy birthday at the top of their lungs. Can we have him please?  Not impressed with the Franchise. I personally will never come to BJ's."
Maripily W.,"Hilo, HI",3,30,35,5.0,7/13/2016,Great service by Steven our waiter. Food came in a timely manner and delicious. We were sat in a booth that was extremely cold. The AC couldn't be adjusted because it would throw off all the others in the restaurant so Steven offered to move us to a different table and threw in a pizookie for my son and I. We'll return and ask for Steven. Thank you Steven.
Edward P.,"Long Beach, CA",17,5,,2.0,7/21/2016,Came here for the lunch specials i got chicken alfredo & my fiance got spaghetti  with meatballs. The meatballs tasted like package meatballs and the chicken alfredo sauce was horrible!  The rolls on our plate tasted better then the food. So disappointed
