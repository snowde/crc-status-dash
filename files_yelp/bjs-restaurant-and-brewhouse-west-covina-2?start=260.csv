Kimberly H.,"Beaumont, CA",0,22,,1.0,8/13/2017,I honestly wish I could not leave a star at all. My cousin and I went yesterday at 1:30pm to enjoy lunch. Once we arrived we were seated immediately. It wasn't very busy and there was a lot of staff just standing around talking. There was a table in use by a family right next to us and had a waiter helping us. We had 6 waiters walk by us and just look at us. We tried to flag on down about 15 mins after sitting there because we it was a long drive and we were thirsty and they ignored us. 30 mins had past and still no one even came to take our drink order or acknowledge us at all. Worst of all. There was a manager standing around doing nothing as wI honestly wish I could leave no stars. My cousin and I went yesterday at 1:30pm to enjoy lunch.

Lupe A.,"West Covina, CA",0,35,2,1.0,5/30/2016,"I am so disappointed!! We placed an Online order tonight and when my hubby got to BJ's they could not find our order.  He gave them our order number which we got off our email confirmation but they Still could not locate our order. So we went back Online and placed the order again...still nothing. So after my husband argued with the manager,  he gave up and left.     I just don't understand if we are given a confirmation number off of an email from your restaurant/location... how can you 'not find it'???    Not sure if we will ever order to-go again!!"
Alexis O.,"Covina, CA",20,8,,1.0,3/11/2017,"I wish I could rate this location 0 stars. I had a TERRIBLE experience!!!! To make a very long story short: - I ordered a pizzookie platter and patiently waited with my boyfriend and his 2 little brothers for about 35 minutes -Katie, our waitress, came out to apologize for the wait and told us ""they are scooping the ice cream right now"" -Katie did NOT come back for another 20 minutes and when she did, she told us the pizzookie had NOT been made at all - Sean, the manager, came out and we told him we were going to leave because we didn't want to have to wait another 30 min - However, Katie came back a few minutes later to tell us she could have the pizzookie out and it would be on the house - We decide to wait and after 20 min I ask Katie how much longer it will take and if she is positive a pizzookie is being made because we told her manager we were LEAVING. She told us she is POSITIVE because the pizzookie is out of the oven. - She comes back 10 min later to tell us the pizzookie was NOT made. We left immediately after having wasted almost 2 hours of our time. I am definitely not returning to this ridiculous place.  Moral of the story: Don't expect your food to come out if it is a busy day. Also, the waiters are liars. If they tell you the pizzookie is out of the oven and almost ready it's  because it's out of the oven barley being put into the oven."
Candice B.,"La Puente, CA",96,17,17,4.0,1/10/2015,The food was great we order the great white pizza add olives and avocado egg rolls.  our wait for a table on a Saturday night was about 30mins it's took 15 mins to get our food.  Our drinks were always filled which was awesome.  They forgot our salads but by the time we finished our avocado egg roll and started on our pizza we were full. The manager came up to the table to apologize he was so nice and we can't wait to come back.
Nancy C.,"Alhambra, CA",16,115,677,2.0,11/9/2015,Supposed to 4 stars but then my waitress told me my burn order was how is supposed to be burn the bottom the two gentlemen sit next to me insist for her to replace it. He can not eat the new order she brought out needed to pack it to go she came in a box for me to pack it myself the two gentlemen didn't like it because they  told me that she's supposed to packet for me.  I don't mind but since they don't think I should I took off two stars for bad serve.  Foid was good I like it unburned salmon tastes good and  moist.  Love it!
Diane V.,"La Puente, CA",31,8,3,1.0,1/20/2016,"If it isn't their table, they don't care about you. Our waiter was great. One who dropped off our food, not at all. Unfortunate.  *paraphrased from an earlier, yelp deleted, review."
Eunice M.,"Baldwin Park, CA",1,2,,5.0,8/30/2016,"Usually I don't write Yelp reviews but for this BJ's I must. Not only was the wait super quick but the staff was friendly. Must give an extra applaud to our waiter Steven(talk,dark,and handsome) for amazing service. Thank you Steven !!"
ED L.,"Los Angeles, CA",926,714,2101,5.0,10/2/2012,"This is probably one of the most busiest BJ's restaurant I have been to.  I have been here for happy hour, lunch, and dinner.  And each time the place is filled and is full of energy!  I like it. They have happy hour special drinks either by the bottle or in a pitcher.  The food is good, and the service is awesome.  All the waiters/waitresses are very friendly.  They constantly check up on you to make sure all is fine. I've ordered pasta, and sandwiches here before.  The prices are decent at around $10.00 for lunch specials, and probably about $15.00 for regular entrees.  My pasta was tasty with enough flavor... and my sandwich (half) was a turkey cobb which comes with your choice of soup and fries or potato wedges.  I chose their Tortilla soup which was delicious.  It was hot and spicy with enough kick to it.  It was so good that I had to ask for seconds which (they don't offer) I had to order another one. The turkey cobb was fresh.  The half sandwich was large enough to be a whole.   The food came out after a decent amount of time waiting.  The place is clean, and there is an abundant amount of seating for everybody.  Well, sometimes there is still a wait depending on the time of arrival.   I really like the ambiance of the restaurant.  I felt comfortable and relaxed sitting inside.  They had LCD TVs hanging which is awesome for happy hour and sporting events.  I definitely will give this place two thumbs up!  I will come back whenever I have the opportunity."
Cj C.,"Griffith Park, Los Angeles, CA",2,6,4,1.0,4/30/2016,"I usually don't post anything on Yelp but today I was feeling a little generous. So today being Saturday I knew it was going to be busy so I decided to do the take-out service BJ's has. I ordered a large pizza so when I got to the take-out area to pay I used my credit card, but my card has been having issues so it was not swiping properly. I ask the girl who was helping me out if she could type it in manually instead of continuously swiping so she asked this chubby dude with slicked hair and feminine voice if she can do that, he abruptly answered ""if it doesn't swipe it doesn't work"" in a pretty rude manner. I then took out my second card and was having the same issue so I told them ""why don't you use the receipt paper and then slide it"" and wa lah after 20 attempts it worked, I wanted to tell them ""if they put in a little effort you might have a successful outcome"" but I just kept my mouth shut. I wait, get my pizza and when she hands it to me the bottom of the box has melted cheese and also on the top, I just wanted to get out of there so I asked the same chubby dude with slicked hair and feminine voice if I can get a bag for my pizza and he then replied with ""No we don't have bags for that!"" I then got a little ticked off and told them ""well can you guys at least clean the box!"" They did so but when I got home to eat the pizza it seemed as if Stevie wonder cut it himself and passed the cooked pizza to Ray Charles to box it up.  Pretty disappointed with the pizza and especially the service. Bottom line if you're going to act like a male diva during work please do not work in a customer service industry. Don't plan on returning."
Katrina S.,"West Covina, CA",2,4,,1.0,1/28/2017,"Let me start off by saying me and my husband are NOT picky eaters. We called and waited about 10 min because the girl on the phone said she would ask if there are delivery drivers. She hung up on me. I called back and ordered. Should've turned my head at that point. She didn't know what she was doing and I was very patient and very polite. I got there and asked her a question about the pizookie. I asked how it worked since it was my first time ordering take out from here. She replied with ""I haven't scooped out your ice cream yet.""  Not something you say in customer service. My husbands crispy jalapeño burger was a disaster. It wasnt even spicy and the jalapeños were canned.....what!!?? Didnt have what I wanted so I went with the brewhouse deluxe burger. Wow what a shame to be calling that deluxe or a burger in the same name. Shame. My burger had ONE piece of ""bacon"" (looked like fried cheese, tasted like feet) my bread was soggy from the pickles because the burger was made up of pickles and lettuce. I asked for it well done and it looked like it was cooked for 5 min. Your fries suck. They always have. Can't argue with that but at least make an effort. The stuffed mushrooms were ok.  The pizookies are lies just a regular cookie and I will NEVER order those again. The only thing good about this meal is that I got to be disappointed at home instead of there because this was just absolutely ridiculous. I GAVE ALL MY FOOD TO THE DOG!!  I believe this might be the last time I order from this establishment."
Courtney S.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/18/2017,"Steven is literally the best server I've had at this restaurant. He is attentive, engaging, and totally deserves a promotion to cocktail server. I always get my order messed up here but today with Steven it was perfect. And when I left my sweater he ran it out to me in the parking lot. He made me laugh and that's what makes the magic happen for me."
JoshuaYodaman T.,"West Covina, CA",25,24,8,1.0,8/1/2015,"Absolutely taken back by this experience. I walked in with my 2 year old and wife and was immediately seated on a Saturday evening. Check in time promptly at 530 as planned. We were dumped rudely by our runner who walked away before we were even seated and didn't tell us our servers name or ask us if we wanted drinks. 15 minutes after being seated we were finally asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers. We order our 2 year Olds food, drink and appetizer first to keep him entertained.  20 minutes to get drinks and dumped off to another server. (Still haven't gotten 2 year Olds ANYTHING) It's 615 at this point 45 minutes after we were seated and a random guy from the kitchen walks out with my main course. The last thing I ordered..... this place needs to get their stuff together."
Laila S.,"Rosemead, CA",636,157,868,5.0,3/3/2016,"My boyfriend brought me here last night to watch the Clippers vs Oklahoma City Thunder on the big screen TV, and we really enjoyed ourselves.  The bartenders were really attentive and the Piranha ales tasted really good with our deep dish pizza.  I really liked that we were able to order food at the bar while watching the game on the big screen."
Alex R.,"Glendora, CA",0,12,9,2.0,8/5/2015,"Came here for mom's b day. There seems to be enough staff, but wait for additional drinks and some food was also a long wait. Calamari dish looked skimpy. Manager helped out after voicing concerns. He was very professional."
Nancy B.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,5.0,7/1/2016,"I come here pretty often but,  the service stood out today. Thanks for such an awesome experience,  Steven P.!"
Yuka N.,"Brea, CA",316,441,1699,1.0,4/24/2015,"I usually go to the BJ's in the City of Industry but I went to this one since it's closer to my house.   Parking sucks!!!  I went on a Friday evening around 6'ish.  15 minute wait, which wasn't too bad.   The server was nice.  We ordered the calamari, 2 beers and those came out quickly.  We also ordered the Best Beginnings appetizer platter.  Somehow the food got lost back in the kitchen area and it took forever.  The server came to apologize and offered a free dessert.  The manager with the blonde hair came over to our table and it seemed like she was in a hurry, asked if we were ok and didn't apologize.  That's bad customer service!  We told our server and she brought out the Sr. manager.  That lady with the dark hair was friendly and she apologized.   We got a free salted caramel Pizookie.  I'm never going back to this Bj's ever again."
Nan S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,12,4,2.0,1/15/2017,"Unable to give an estimated seating time, appetizer served with no plates, had to wait until a server passed before purchasing could get appetizer plates, was brought big plates instead of appetizer plates. Avocado Egg-rolls had bad rotten avocado in it. Very disappointed with quality of food and service. Can't get a server until one passes by."
Cris V.,"Whittier, CA",91,11,3,2.0,6/12/2016,I refuse to come back after ordering online. Online app was pretty clear and detailed. I ordered two entrées and an appetizer. Upon getting there my wife gets out and goes in to get the food 30min after ordering. I'm waiting in the parking lot for another 25 minutes for the food. She mentioned that the lady argued that we didn't order an apetizer and I brushed it off as maybe it was my error. Went home and ate and left it alone. The next day I checked my emails and I did in fact order an apetizer and paid for it! They pretty much stole from me! I refuse to go to any place that is going to steal like that especially after that lady argued with my wife that we didn't order an app.
Leo C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1054,639,3498,4.0,10/6/2012,"I really like coming to BJ's for its casual sports bar atmosphere and great micro brewed beer selections. They also have excellent appetizers and food for watching sporting events on their many LCD TVs.   This is my first time here at BJ's in Covina. It's also the busiest that I've visited and we were fortunate to get seated immediately. Because its located in a large shopping lot, there's plenty of available parking.   What I like about BJ's is that they have great variety and selection of handcrafted beers. You can even combine the different varieties of beers into glass or pitcher (half and half) to create an more unique delicious flavor. Make sure to try it on your next visit to BJ's. My favorites are the Harvest Hefeweizen and Nutty Brewnette ale, so smooth, lightly sweet and refreshing. Prices weren't to bad $5.50 pint and $16 pitcher.  For appetizers, we ordered avocado egg roll, calamari and ahi poke which were all tasty and satisfyingly good.  Since we were already starting to get full from the beer and appetizers we ordered the black and bleu flat bread pizzas and BBQ chicken salad. Good portions, healthy and very delicious. Service is usually pretty decent, but today was exceptionally above and beyond its norm. They accidentally made a mistake on one of my orders and I informed the waitress. A few minutes later the manager came out, apologize for the order and hand delivered my correct order in person. Wow! That's great customer service and worth 4 stars. We were to full for dessert and the chocolate chip pizookie with double scoops of ice cream is to die for here.  Overall, we had a great time and experience. I will definitely be back."
Janet M.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,1.0,4/16/2016,"This is the first time that I've had a bad experience in this location. The first sever (Samantha) was great! Very attentive and very energetic, even though it was busy. She was sent home and the waitress that we had after could not be understood at all. I don't remember her name but was not helpful. It took over an hr to get our dessert!!!! And even after the manager came in person to tell us she would personally take care of it she had someone else do it. It wasn't just us but the table beside us also had bad service. After getting out dessert we asked to speak to a manager and they could not find her. She walked right by us like nothing. If you guys know it's going to be busy make sure you have extra staff on call and other managers to help out too."
