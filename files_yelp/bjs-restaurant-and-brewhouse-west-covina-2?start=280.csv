Wendy F.,"San Dimas, CA",0,3,,1.0,7/11/2016,"Beware the to go ordering! Placed an order on line, after joining their new rewards program, my husband drove the rt 10 miles and grabbed the bags. The guy didnt go over the order so when we unpacked the bags the $11 flatbread pizza was missing and the order of calamari was tiny, maybe 8 rings, and it cost about $11.  We called and i spoke to a manager that never appologized and sounded like he didn't give a crap. I drove back, and was just handed the pizza and calamari, no apology, again. I asked about the rewards point i was supposed to receive and she knew nothing about the program and started guessing, ""um maybe the points show up in about a week?"" I told her i was very unhappy, i had been very inconvenienced and wasn't offered anything or apologized to. Wont be going back there for a looooong time!"
John D.,"Riverside, CA",1,21,,4.0,12/6/2016,"Party of 20 went here after a funeral on a Thursday at forest lawn , we called at 2 and by 2:30 they had a table for us . Good food and great service, several of us were able to still get the lunch specials."
Martina H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/5/2017,"Came to BJ's to have our usual BJ's specialty pizza and their delicious beginners appetizer, this was our first time at this particular location in West Covina, hate to say that it was a very disappointing dinner and visit. The mozzarella sticks, boneless wings, and pizza where cold when they brought it to our table! We told the gentleman who brought us our food that the sticks where cold and he graciously brought a new order of cheese sticks which we where grateful for however, even then the cheese sticks where not warm enough to where the cheese was melted. Solid cheese is not what is expected in a mozzarella cheese sticks order. We also then realized our wings where just as cold and mentioned it to our waiter for the second time. Discarding the cheese sticks we then told him we didn't want a new order, we just would like him to take them and re-heat them. Of course he did but. Sad to say when he brought them back 4 minutes later they still weren't hot enough. We then just decided to ask for a box and take the remaining pieces home and just heat it and home and call it a day. We didn't make a big deal over it, it was obvious we weren't getting anywhere after waiting 45 min to get seated and having to take our food back two time we just were not in the mood. So we sucked it up and just left. I can see It wasn't the waiters fault so we still tipped him generously but sad to say we left very unsatisfied."
Jill A.,"Spokane, WA",81,12,,4.0,2/29/2016,"All 4 of these stars are for our server Harold. If it weren't for him, I would have given this place 1 star. I used to come here at least once week, but the last couple of years the quality of service has gone down to 1 star. And forget about talking to a manager... They will be conveniently unavailable. If we do head back to this BJ's it will only be if Harold is working and has a table in his section."
Leilani K.,"Diamond Bar, CA",63,27,27,2.0,6/2/2015,"I'd like to say that the service here was decent. We came at an odd hour 3pm on a Thursday, suffice it to say that it wasn't too crowded...but they seemed to have plenty of work going.  We ordered a couple waters, and just appetizers, since we both weren't too hungry. Well, that was our mistake...too much food! A good mistake to be sure, but one we'll keep in mind next time.  My real gripe is the bill. While the paper bill itself was accurate, once checking the statement I used to pay for this meal, I was surprised to find that the tip was not how I remember it. As a sidenote, my tip for our small (easy) meal was a standard 15% and we stayed for maybe 45 minutes when it wasn't full. The mistake wasn't exorbitant, not enough to call management...but it also wasn't what I wrote...it was more.  So this review is for the management: make sure your staff reads the receipts carefully enough to not overcharge your guests. It leaves a bad taste in their mouth and they likely will hesitate to return."
Erma R.,"La Puente, CA",8,10,3,3.0,10/10/2014,Strawberry lemonade was yummy Avocado rolls are my fav but were pretty over cooked here. Service wasn't the best. S'mores peanut butter pozookie was really good. Came around 11pm tho a hour before they were closing. No wait
Julie L.,"San Dimas, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/16/2017,"I placed an order to go on the phone. When I arrived to pay and receive my food at the ""take out"" counter, there was a gentleman looking at a menu, trying to decide what to order. The senseless BJ's girl didn't have the basic customer service skills to inform the man to let her know when he had decided what he wanted to order and then assist me. I stood in line for 7 minutes like this. After 7 minutes, the customer asked if he could taste test a beer, she had a sample cup brought to him, he sipped it, kept looking through the menu and eventually finished his beer. The entire time, the girl was talking to a male coworker and I was ignored. The is was at no fault the customers. He had no idea I was even behind him. She on the other hand, continuously glanced at me then looked away. By the time he ordered beer to go and left, I had waited in line for 27 minutes. I felt completely ignored. She never even said thank you for waiting or sorry that took so long. Please, please, please teach you STAFF basic customer service skills. Since when did beer taste testing become allowed at the to go counter? Rediculous. Sad. Unprofessional."
Ady M.,"Covina, CA",1,18,16,3.0,5/21/2016,"I like ordering the grilled chicken pasta to go from here since it's so close to my home. I get it is always busy so it's cool that they have that curbside service, when they answer. Had to walk in after being on hold for a while this time."
Gary G.,"West Covina, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/18/2016,"Just horrible. This is based on their take out service which sucked balls! They were quick to take my money and slooooww to bring out my order. I waited for 30 minutes for my food and when they did bring it out it was missing an entré. The server took another 10 minutes to get it. I called to complain to the manager (Sean Maisto?) after being put on hold for another 10 minutes. He offered to email me a courtesy card to make up for the bad service, which I still haven't received. Got home and the food was awful. If you want take out from a restaurant in the eastland center go to Chili's. I wish there was a negative star for this review."
mike e.,"Glendora, CA",12,49,159,4.0,6/14/2014,"One of favs:  though it is loud ( I'm convinced that they have a white noise generator here) they have one of my favorite dishes.  The Parmesan crusted chicken.  There's something about it that is magical to my taste buds.  Did I mention the Tatanka Stout?  Also my favorite beer.  I don't drink much beer, but this one is really good and they make it- here or at one of the other restaurants.   Eileen ordered the half rack of ribs, and we shared here salad.  I like the blue cheese dressing which is a little sweet. Unfortunately for us today, it is graduation day for some of the local schools so it is crowded.  Still, the place is usually pretty crowded on any Saturday evening.   Our waitress Savanah, just got on and is very pleasant. The food (and beer) was as good as ever.  I will fault them for the amount of steamed broccoli, but over all very good."
Jenn L.,"Baldwin Park, CA",14,8,45,5.0,8/25/2015,"My all time favorite dish from BJs is the Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy and a roasted corn and bell pepper succotash. I always ask for extra gravy because it can get a little dry after awhile but it is amazing! They have it in a lunch portion as well as a dinner plate. The lunch portion is a single fried breaded chicken breast and the dinner plate is a double. Try this! You will definitely love it!"
Sarah S.,"Oakland, CA",391,53,33,3.0,7/13/2015,"Typically, I have decent food and decent service anytime I visit a BJ's restaurant. However, my experience at this BJ's was a bit lacking.  We visited on a busy Saturday night and were informed there was a 30 minute wait. We didn't mind waiting but when we were seated we noticed how many empty tables there were, which made us wonder why they had us waiting outside for so long. Maybe there weren't enough waiters available to serve all the tables but I would expect a popular place like BJ's to be fully staffed on a Saturday night. Our waitress was very nice and attentive when taking our orders and checked up on us frequently. However, the food took nearly an hour to come out after we placed our orders. We felt bad asking our waitress where our food was because she seemed SO busy running from table to table. I ordered the new honey-Sriracha brussel sprouts, a burger, and fries. My friends ordered a pizza and a pazookie.  When the food  finally arrived at our table, it was just alright. I struggled to find another adjective to describe the food but really that is the best way to sum up both the food and our entire experience at BJ's that night: Alright. The brussel sprouts were too salty and overcooked. The burger & fries were meh. The pizza seemed like it had been sitting out a little longer than it should have been. The one thing that was delicious was, of course, the pazookie because pizza-size cookies with ice cream on top are one of the greatest inventions in the modern-day world.  Yum. If I am in the area again, I might give this BJ's another chance since it may have just been an off night for the restaurant."
Tom H.,"West Covina, CA",0,14,22,3.0,7/8/2016,"The service here is good. The staff seems very helpful. The drinks a good and the appetizers are tasty. This is directed at BJs as a whole, the menu seems sort of bland or lacking imagination. The menu in years past seemed to offer more variety and a good selection of choices to fit your mood. In the last year or so it seems that the menu has been reduced to burgers, pizza and pasta dishes. It just seems to be lacking originality and flavor."
Naisi Cece M.,"Corona, CA",63,19,8,1.0,12/30/2016,"My husband & I arrived at the restaurant @ 4:45 last night, we sat in the bar & waited to be greeted by a server for awhile! We were concerned about the service for 1st impressions are utmost important & we were not greeted upon entering the restaurant.. our server introduced himself as 'Grayson' asked for our beverage order, our beverages arrived shortly after.. we ordered the full rack of ribs which came with no BBQ sauce on the ribs..our meal was delivered by another server..while waiting to alert our server about the ribs we noticed him socializing with other guests & could not get his attention! We decided to eat our meals which was delicious! The ribs were so tender (no BBQ sauce) but delicious! When he finally came by our table I ordered coffee at this time I noticed the table next to us be seated, after 10-15 minutes no one approached the guests, at this time I'm getting a little frustrated for I still have not received the coffee & the guests next to us we're getting very upset! We called him over & asked for the check & a box & asked about our dessert we ordered he apologized & said he forgot!!!  We decided to just leave, our check was incorrect he (Grayson) said he had to have the manager correct it, again as we watched him socializing with no urgency as he knew we were frustrated we left the $ on the table & left!! B'J's I've managed restaurants for the last 17 years, this service was by far the worst I've experienced in a very long time!! Was there a manager on the floor? Perhaps you should have management table touch!!"
Justine G.,"Diamond Bar, CA",414,91,23,1.0,2/18/2015,Went it and got food poisoning and had horrible service. Will not be going back to this location.
Amy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1131,794,711,4.0,2/4/2014,"I don't understand why this BJ's is rated so low. As soon as you get in the parking lot you can feel you're in the suburbs. And I love that feeling. The parking lot is many and plentiful, you can park anywhere you want, for FREE, for as long as you want. It's also in a huge lot by the Burlington's and stuff so take your pick!  We got in on monday evening and there was no wait. They also seated us before our entire party was there which made me sooooooooo happy. The population of looking like they've settled couples and high school children made the interior even more suburby which I again, love. Our waiter looked like he was a junior in high school and  was an attentive, try hard server.  I practiced some self control and ordered the chicken a la fresca without bell peppers and it was actually kind of delightful. Granted, I was absolutely starving but I finished the whole plate. The items on their menu are pretty horrible for you though so watch out, and I would try to stay with the healthier menu if possible. We were there for a bday so they brought out a mini pizookie for the bday boy, and we got our own, which was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS. Just for that pizookie they deserve 5 stars. Anyways, I had a great time here, it reminded me of my quaint suburby childhood."
Fernando G.,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",5,24,75,5.0,5/17/2015,Plenty of parking in front. Very clean bathrooms. Came here today for a birthday brunch with a group of about 25. Ordered the BJ's California Scramble. Very delicious where you can taste the fresh ingredients. Service was great especially with the big group we had. Waiters kept checking on us throughout are brunch. Definitely coming back.
Albert S.,"West Covina, CA",19,31,243,4.0,7/3/2015,I come here for the blonde's (beer) stay for the pizza and pasta. Love the extreme pepperoni. This joint is always fast at seating groups. Awesome friendly service oh yeah make sure not to skip on the bazokie
Vanessa S.,"La Verne, CA",23,12,1,1.0,4/24/2016,Worse service ever took 45 minutes to get our salad and 55 minutes for our appetizer when it came the appetizer was cold. Food came out cold and when we asked to talk o a Manager she didn't seem to make it a priority got new food out and it was burnt. My food was tacos and the tortilla was so had I couldn't even eat it. Sadly after being at our table for 2 hours my husband and oldest son left without eating dinner and we still has to pay for a bunch of food we didn't even eat. So sad and disappointed
Christian Z.,"West Covina, CA",1,21,4,5.0,2/2/2015,My girlfriend and I come here every couple weeks or so to have a drink and a late dinner. The service is never bad but tonight was exceptionally good thanks to our waiter Ramon who made us feel very welcome and was genuinely polite. He didn't fail to check up on us every couple minutes to make sure we were doing fine and he recommended some very delicious beers that my girlfriend and I enjoyed very much.  All in all I'd have to say this was our best experience at this bj's and I truly hope managements sees this and recognizes Ramon for his excellent customer service
