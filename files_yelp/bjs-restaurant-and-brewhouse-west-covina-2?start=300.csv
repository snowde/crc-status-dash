Pablo S.,"Los Angeles, CA",113,53,83,4.0,2/25/2015,"This was my first time at his location. Parking was not an issue and it was free.  Came in today for a business meeting, It was 3 of us and our meeting started at 2pm. we were seated right away.  Our server was Brandon and he was very helpful. Our food came out on time and Brandon was allowed us to take as much time as we needed to conduct our meeting, Brandon even checked to see if they had a specific drink which most servers wont even bother and just simply give you a no.  We were there well over an hour but Brandon was not rushing us at all and allowed us to take up as much time as we needed. The food was the norm for a BJ's but what stood out was the lever of service Brandon provided us.  The WIFI was free and fast, I was able to use my laptop without any problems.  Too bad I live/work too far from this location if not I would be definitely coming back. Thank you Brandon!!!"
Zak S.,"Redwood City, CA",156,18,14,1.0,6/15/2015,"I don't recommend coming to this restaurant find another BJ. I have been coming here for many years buying growlers of their signature beer and the last year or so the place has really gone to s***. The managers obviously don't care about the quality control going out to their customers. I can't believe that they don't even have a growler filler tube, come on guys what is it 6 dollars 20 at most. obviously you don't know anything about beer, filling a growler without a filler tube ruins the beer that defeats the purpose of selling growlers or even buying one I'm not buying a growler to drink by myself in one sitting which you are causing me to throw away or drink it all because after a few hours of pouring it into the growler without a filler tube it becomes still and undrinkablethat defeats the"
Sandy N.,"West Covina, CA",239,76,71,4.0,5/11/2015,"Love, love, love BJ's Pizookies!!! They actually have a party size one. Their chocalate chip is the best, but that's just me. Great place for lunch & dinner if you're with family, friends, date..ect! They have a flat screens all around the restaurant for the people who are interested in sports. The Bar is too the side with a Huge selection of their famous beers..Truthfully can't suggest one since I'm not a huge beer fan. What I love ordering: New Orleans Jambalaya Grilled Chicken Baked Potato w/ extra Alfredo sauce Any of their PIZZAS!!! (So Yummy!) And of course their Pizookies :-d The wait is not bad when you go on weekdays. Weekends are busy. I usually do takeout for lunch and bring it to work, the staff is friendly and very helpful esp when your asking for a recommendation on a food or beverage  selection."
Jessica R.,"Costa Mesa, CA",70,76,159,2.0,3/19/2016,"The service here is not very good. We noticed that a lot of tables were dirty and he had to wait 30 minutes. While we waited I noticed those tables were never touched. On a busy Saturday night I don't understand why the restaurant would be understaffed. We finally were seated and our waitress came to the table. She seemed very rushed and since I had brought my family for the first time I wanted to share my last great experience with them. She didn't offer any recommendations, dropped off our drinks (mine still had all the syrup at the bottom, she told me to mix it myself) and left. We wanted to start off with a few appetizers but since she didn't come back. We realized we should probably order our next time we see her since we didn't know when we would see her again. I definitely understand being busy and that's great but the service to the guest is suffering for it for sure. Once she finally came around we were starving, I was pretty embarrassed to bring my family here with this service. The Venice BJ's had great service so I thought I'd receive the same type of service here. Probably will not go back to this location."
Shane F.,"Honolulu, HI",112,23,16,5.0,2/15/2014,"My cousin recommended this place after passing it on our way to big bear.  So we made plans to eat before heading back to Hawaii.  This was as she put it their go to spot for dinner when no one could decide.  So needless to say I was excited! We get there just as they were opening, and I was starving.  The place has a gordon biersch type atmosphere, with a nice size bar section and an equal size dining area.  Our server Nicole was great, although my cousin knew exactly what she was getting.  Nicole helped me by recommending there deep dish pizza.  Let me just stop right here, after taking that first bite I had to say that this was the best pizza that I've ever had.  I consider myself a pizza guy and pretty much have had it all, but this was super delicious.  The bread was fluffy and not to doughy, the toppings were just right, even the bell peppers were chopped into little pieces, the italian sausage and pepperoni were right on spot.  Everything blended so well I was in heaven.  I was starving when I came in and even with all that I just described up top I could only finish half the pizza.   My cousin had the jambalaya which was her favorite.  I had a taste and the flavor was spot on.  Very spicy too much for me. I also on the recommendation from a friend had a beer from there brewery called Jeremiah's Red.  Was excellent and I couldn't even bring myself to try another beer. Finally if you come to BJ's for nothing else you need to order a Pizooki.  Now you may be wondering what that is.  Well firstly its a desert!  Next is where the awesome is.  Imagine a huge fresh baked cookie the size of a small pizza, made to order from about 3 different types of cookies you can even do half and half, and this is topped with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Thats right LEGEN - wait for it - DARY!  Yup thats all that needs to be said it was epic and can't wait for another excuse to go to Cali and eat at BJ's again."
Parker J.,"Covina, CA",28,5,3,1.0,4/29/2016,always loved it here until they gave me a deep dish with almst no cheese on one half of it. never going there again
Renee E.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,157,237,1.0,1/25/2015,"Made reservations a few days before for 7 people for a Friday night dinner celebration. I was expecting the place to be busy so that's why I made reservations. I've been to this BJ's once before and had a pretty good experience. The food was good, service was ok and the place was pretty clean. However, tonight was just not their night. We ordered around 7pm and didn't get our food until 7:30 pm! We were all starving and wanted our food, but we had to wait for such a long time (ughhhh). Then, not all of our orders came at the exact same time so we had to wait even longer for the last person's order so we could all eat together. We told our waiter that we wanted a to-go order but when he handed us the bill and wished us a good night, we asked him if he placed the order and he said he forgot! That was a bummer :( Food was ok, had the chili in a bread bowl. Not the best I've had but also not the worst. Kind of pricy too. I suggest coming for lunch on a weekday for their specials and hopefully it's not as busy as it was on Friday."
Tony G.,"Ontario, CA",25,10,70,1.0,6/2/2015,This place suck birthday boy been waiting for almost 40 min no food everyone been waiting on him that sucks sad .. Really mad .. Fuck this place ..
Adela S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",52,4,,2.0,1/23/2016,"My husband and I have always enjoyed BJ's food and we still do.  Normally we visit other locations.  Today we came with a party of 8 and were told that it would be a 20-30 minute wait.  It was not unusually busy and we went past the 30 minutes.  When asked how much longer they were waiting for two ladies to leave so they could clean the table.  Waited longer then when asked again they were waiting for someone to clean the table.  Finally seated and we noticed there were areas that tables could have been put together as they did for another larger party who arrived.  Our server took awhile to bring our drinks and our food took awhile to arrive.  When it did, some of us had cold fries. We will still go to BJ's but not  this location."
Mykey M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,8,1,5.0,12/21/2015,No wait tonight. Our server was Desire she was amazing. Her customer service is great! We come in often and the manager Danny recognized us and stopped by. He's another one with great customer service! Highly recommended!
Jonathan U.,"Baldwin Park, CA",541,364,423,4.0,9/21/2013,"Came here on a friday night and the service and food was incredible.  Ive been here plenty of times and im finally writing this review. The wait was about 20 minutes for my party of 3.  As a group we ordered the great white pizza, lettuce wraps, nachos and jeremiah red beer.  Lettuce wraps tasted great.  Probably one of the best ive had.  The great white pizza was incredible.  Im actually writing this review to tell people how great that pizza is.  Im not sure what was in it but i think it consist of chicken, alfredo sauce, tomatoes, mushroom, and garlic.  The blend of ingredients complemented each other well.  It was a deep dish pizza that was perfectly baked.  The nachos was nothing to rave about but still tasted great nonetheless.  I dont drink but the other 2 people i was with throughly enjoyed the jeremiah red.  Sadly, all 3 of us were on a diet so none of us ordered the pizookie.  Maybe next time.  Im definitely coming back during happy hour to get the great white pizza."
Rosemarie A.,"Azusa, CA",0,18,5,5.0,5/8/2016,"I booked a reservation for my graduation lunch and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. They made sure that my party and I were well taken care of and were very attentive. The manager is a sweetheart and ensure that everything ran smoothly!  Thank you BJs for making my graduation lunch a success! Great food, drinks and service! Love this place!"
Tiffany P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",131,4,26,2.0,3/25/2016,"BRING BACK THE CAJUN PASTA!!!!!! I ONLY get that when I come here and now that it's gone, I don't know what to get here. The Cajun pasta gave me a reason to come here! And now I don't have a reason to anymore."
Irma S.,"West Covina, CA",0,1,,2.0,11/4/2016,Lousy service!!!  It seemed the server was too tired.  Every time we asked for something it took him a long time to get back to us.
Elle A.,"Woodland Hills, CA",12,91,283,4.0,12/18/2014,The pizza and root beer are good. Nice place for small group or happy hour. Game nights are crowded and loud.  Rodger is the best bartender in sgv. Great drinks!!
Sarah B.,"Manhattan, NY",73,20,4,5.0,10/29/2015,"I give this place 5 stars because I can't give John more than 5 stars. If you are eating here, don't bother dining with any other server. He is funny, witty, genuine and truly cares about your experience. My experience with him started at the host stand where one of the hostesses told me that I would be seated with John, the best server they had. Now you could say that she was lying but she was completely sincere. John was attentive and nice and always very diligent during our meal. Thank you John for being the ideal server!"
Alexandria M.,"El Monte, CA",65,25,35,3.0,3/15/2015,Came here for a late dinner with friends. The wait was 15 minutes to be seated. Our waiter was really cool but took forever bringing all the little things we needed. I had the mini pizza and a pear cider beer. Very tasty :)
Juvi G.,"Pomona, CA",432,596,4341,4.0,2/22/2012,"I have only ever visited this restaurant twice, but from my experiences here, I'd say it's a good place worth visiting at least once. The food is good. And the desserts phenomenal. I especially like the variety of pizookie's they have. If you don't know what a pizookie is, it's basically a really big cookie baked in a deep dish that comes in many different flavors, (such as, Red Velvet, Godiva Dark Chocolate, White Chocolate, etc.), and served with all sorts of delicious toppings like ice cream, whipped cream, hot fudge, and the like. Trust me, you haven't lived until you've tried one. So the next time you're in the area, you know where to go.     They also have a large variety of alcohol. As well as some unique creations of their own which vary by season."
Jerry S.,"Glendora, CA",44,59,1,3.0,9/6/2014,"This place is pretty good. I have been here quite a few times with friends and the family. I like the fact that they have a good variety of selection of food. Their pizza is better than average and they have a great selection of beers.  We have been here with other families and ordered the family size pazooki which is a huge cookie with like 8 scoops of ice cream. If you are going to order the pazookie I would put the order in as early as possible. They usually will tell you that it takes awhile to make.  The one thing I do not like about this place is that the noise level is horribly loud. I think their service is ok and the wait time on the food is longer than average, but if you go in aware of the possibilty of a longer wait it does not bother you so much."
