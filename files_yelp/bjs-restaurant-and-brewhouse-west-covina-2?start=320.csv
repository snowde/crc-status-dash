Mister P.,"Pasadena, CA",4,54,20,1.0,2/18/2017,"We came in today @ 4pm.  Service in the bar section was pretty mediocre.  First we had a waiter who took our drink orders, then came back to take out food order, after coming back with no drinks. Then we ended up with another waitress ""Samantha"" because he had to leave. So still no drinks. Finally drinks come out with an apology because bar was slammed. But minus the Pepsi my wife ordered. I told her and she again apologized and went to waitress another table. Then someone else came with the Pepsi some time later. Food came out cold. My deluxe burger was overcooked and my wife's pasta was cold.  Meanwhile we are eating, I already finished my Mule and my wife was out of Pepsi. I had to flag down another waiter to get my wife a refill. I didn't even order another alcoholic beverage because I didn't want to wait 20 minutes for a drink again. I don't think I will be frequenting this place much when there are so many other good places around."
Danny S.,"Los Angeles, CA",471,285,72,1.0,9/14/2013,"Came here on a Friday night and did not feel welcomed. When me and some friends came here we weren't helped right away until my gf asked..which was fine since it was quite busy. After we got sat down we made our orders of food and some alcohol.  The food wasn't that great that night. My gf ordered a burger and she took one bite and said it wasn't tasting good, so I had a try and the burger tasted burnt. The alcohol came quick, but our hostess spilled some of my friends beer and did not even offer to get a new one for him. Pretty horrible night for a friends bday Probably wont be coming back to this location"
Geneyem B.,"West Covina, CA",146,101,50,1.0,11/20/2014,"Worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant. Not only was the food cold but the service was horrible.  We were seated around 6:45pm, took us a while to order then finally did. It was my friends 21st birthday so we wanted that evening to be special. So we ordered a little bit before 7, food and drinks, and we didn't get our food until 7:45pm. Then I didn't get my martini until 8pm.  Instead of having a special night for my friends birthday it ended up a night were we had to look for our waitress and continue to wait for everything that we ordered.  To top it off I gave the waitress my reward number and yet I didn't get any points for that evening. It wasn't even packed so I don't know why the service and food was bad."
P D.,"Covina, CA",0,14,,2.0,4/13/2017,I came to lunch today with my wife. Waiter Moses was very attentive we ordered Soup & Salad. We noticed that the couple who arrived after us received their order. I asked why we hadn't been served yet and the response was they had ordered soup & salad. I told Moses we had too. No big deal then they proceed to give us the silverware my wife's fork looks like someone just eaten from it. So we ask for another one all the while we had been waiting for refills on water which never came.(I guess BJ's has a new system that alleviates the wait staff from having to fill drink orders we mention that to Moses he is apologetic & says he'll have his Mgr come by our table. 10 minutes later Moses comes by & asks if his mgr had come by we say no. Then Greg the Mgr comes by very soft spoken is apologetic. At this point we had noticed that the Chicken tortilla soup we both had ordered didn't have chicken. We mention that to Greg he says very softly that we'll notice a small discount on our bill. He was right he discounted our bill 2.19 ! At least he was accurate. I think if we had just had 1 or 2 of these things happen I'd be ok with it but the inconsistent service and dirty fork & lack of chicken deserved to take a meal off the bill or at least comp a dessert. This is the 2nd time we've had a service issue come up in consecutive trips! May be awhile before we are back. The food was good but the lack of empathy on their parts was lacking mainly the Mgr.
Jim G.,"Covina, CA",154,439,2,4.0,9/3/2013,"Wow, been here many many many times, and according to yelp, I have not reviewed this location...... Queeee?  Don't know how that happened. OK, so it is BJ's, so most people know what that means.  If you are from outside California and in one of those states where they don't have one, then this is worth the stop.  Very Very good selection of menu items, just about anything you want you are going to find it.  Food is extremely consistent from location to location. Service is usually first rate, especially at this location. Most Fri/Sat/Sun times you are going to have a wait.  Just deal with it.  The food is worth it, send someone over a few minutes before you really want to eat and you are good to go, grab a ""beeper"" and enjoy spending some quality time with whomever you are with and my gosh, have a conversation.  Once you get seated, you should be all set to rock and roll. Menu items ---- Absolute Fav --- Parmesan Crusted Chicken ---- just so darn good.  YOU MUST ASK FOR EXTRA OF THAT CHARDONNAY CREAM SAUCE.... this darn stuff should be sold in a gallon jug and I would take it home with me every time to put on everything.  This is the star of the show ! Chili --- not too bad for a chain restaurant. Burgers --- all very good size and quite tasty. Potato --- ahhh hello, why call this out, well, cuz they make some darn good spuds that are on the menu all by their lonesome.  Usually supercharged and a meal unto themselves. Salads - yep, you like 'em, they are there and all very solid. Beer ---- yep, they are called a Brewhouse for a reason, they always have a great selection of their in-house brews and everything else for the most part is available either on tap or in the bottle. BJ's - yes digging it - no matter where you go they are always consistent and you know what you are going to get."
James G.,"Covina, CA",0,9,,2.0,3/16/2016,"We went to BJs tonight for an early dinner and we were told it was 20 minute wait and it was empty. They were understaffed and apologized, I understand and proceeded to the bar for a beer and wine for my girlfriend as she waited with my mother. Bartender says sorry sir only one drink at a time, I'm 55 years old for gods sake. I left for Chilis next door and my mother could barely get by the 7 employees having a smoke and texting each other. Never going back!!!"
Eugene D.,"Long Beach, CA",313,27,7,2.0,1/20/2016,"We came in a 9:45pm on Wednesday, January 20. We asked our server if we could order for Happy Hour which starts at 10pm. She went to ask the manager who had us wait 10 minutes. Not a big deal. But in the grand scheme of things you're stepping over dollars to pick up pennies. Thanks."
Christina N.,"Orange County, CA",166,66,16,4.0,10/18/2014,"This location is very spacious and open. I've only ever been to the location in Huntington Beach, and I liked this location better. They had a much nicer restaurant layout. But what really put them over the top was when my party was offered free pizza slices while we were waiting (something BJs-HB's never offered). The samples were mediocre but the fact that they even offered was enough to get me coming back.  Other than that, Their service was very prompt, the shoe string fries were delicious, and the pizookie, as always, was plate-lickin good."
Brittany P.,"Upland, CA",135,4,2,5.0,2/8/2016,I had an amazing experience dinning here. John was my server and I asked a lot of questions about the menu and he answered all my questions and spent a lot of time with us to make sure we were taken care of. When I come back I will definitely be asking if he is working so that he can be out server again.
Patricia K.,"La Verne, CA",42,60,31,5.0,10/1/2014,"Had my sons 16th birthday dinner here last night. My table was ready at the time promised even after they had to accommodate 5 more for my party. I pre-ordered food online (would highly recommend) the food was on the table 10 minutes after being seated. The waitress and bartender were very attentive. I frequent this place on a regular, have never been disappointed."
Ardie S.,"Singapore, Singapore",199,36,6,5.0,1/27/2016,"We haven't been to BJ'S in a while. We decided to have lunch there today and I must say they have stepped it up a notch with enhanced appetizers. We had the root beer glazed wings... Oh la la packed with flavor and crispy. They were sauced just right. The waiter was amazing, after we paid the bill he brought us drinks to go,, without being asked."
Sunny D.,"La Puente, CA",116,215,982,1.0,11/26/2014,This place I feel is loosing focus on simple things maybe there playing on there cell phones to much or just don't care. The food was great but the one little issue was a broken plate ... It's an obvious the kitchen manager isn't doing his job correctly and his staff doesn't give a ?hit. That plate had to switched through more then one person and nobody noticed a broken place if I was the manger I would have a sit down with the staff and put them in check. There's no reason for this to happen. The kid that picked up the plate after when I was done with it noticed it and I told him let your manager know .. He didn't I walked up to the manger on my way out and showed him a picture I took of the plate he seemed shocked that this plate made it this far. Everything was cool but for this Cracked plate its a 1 star BJ's
Sal B.,"West Covina, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/21/2016,"I went there yesterday with the little woman to have a nice meal & relax. I ordered a steak with a side of broccoli and asparagus. When the waiter brought my plate he had a look of shame & embarrassment rolled into one. When I looked at the size of the steak I immediately understood why he looked the way he looked. Instead of declining it or asking to speak to the manager I just went ahead and ate it. The steak itself was just ok, and even the sides were very small. Never again will I return to this place. At least they did not mess up my shot of Jack!"
Scott C.,"San Diego, CA",11,216,104,1.0,12/31/2015,What a piece of crap chain establishment.  It used to be good years ago but quality Has gone done and prices went up.  Never again!
Lorraine G.,"Azusa, CA",0,4,1,5.0,11/7/2015,Amazing service ! Our waitress Courtney was the best! She made it such a pleasant dinner! Very attentive. Never had service like I did here!
Monica M.,"Covina, CA",113,49,1,1.0,1/10/2016,"I write this as I sit, waiting and waiting, and waiting for ""curbside"" delivery. I placed my order online, and asked for it to be ready at 6 pm. At the moment it is 6:15 - and I'm still waiting. I should've known things were going to go south when, upon placing my order and calling to add something to it, BJs personnel put me on hold, passed me to someone else, then hung up on me. When I called again, they couldn't find my order. As I was placing my order (again) on the phone it magically appeared in their system. Now, I end with the beginning: I pull up to curbside delivery stalls, only to find there are none available. The number I'm supposed to call is only visible IF you can pull into a stall. When I called in, the manager couldn't tell me the number because he didn't know it. Whaaaaa???So, there I was sticking half my body out the car to see the number, so I can announce my arrival. With there being nowhere to park I'm told to pull to the front - and wait - with my hazards on. Meanwhile, curbside parking remains full with what I suspect are the cars of dine-in folks.  I like BJs - I really want to like the idea of curbside service. But, I found it to be far too much work and worry for the effort. I'd suggest more spots for curbside delivery, at the very least."
Patty And Sergio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,364,5,5.0,6/21/2015,"Brice was our server tonight, he did an amazing job, he was funny and very consistent regardless of how busy the place was. It's nice to see employees smile under pressure. He sure made our Father's Day dinner a good one.  At our table we had  cherry chipotle salmon: delicious  Chicken tortilla soup combo: delicious  Chicken and spinach: good  Club sandwich with fries: ok Clam chowder soup: could be better (salty, too thick) The green teas were watered down twice but that's ok, I understand it's busy and it happens.  Will we be back ? YES."
Carra B.,"El Segundo, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/27/2016,"I have celiac disease and therefore cannot eat gluten or I get very sick. I love bjs as a good safe option to eat at and recently visited this location for the first time and was very disappointed! I always get the tomato soup with no croutons and the baked potato, but they were out of baked potatoes. Our waiter offered a salad as a replacement and made sure to tell him it had to be gluten free. The salad came out with obvious crumbs and crouton pieces in it. I showed him this and seemed very apologetic  but he never brought out a new one! At first I thought I was just expecting too much but than the people I was eating with expressed the same concern! All in all I will still go to my local BJs but this location was huge disappointment!"
Jon R.,"Los Angeles, CA",710,623,1169,5.0,3/10/2013,"Haven't been here in ages and wow, they really really impressed me tonight! The hostess' were amazing. They apparently have a ""call ahead"" policy where you can, surprise surprise, call ahead and put your name in. That right there shaved off about 15 min. off our wait time. WIN!! Right from the get-go, our server Shawn B. was amazing! Friendly, professional, and very eager to guide us through the massive menu. He made some good recommendations which he heeded and were really impressed!  **FOOD** Avocado Egg Rolls -Crispy exterior, creamy delicious filling -Sweet sauce for dipping -Highly highly recommend this one! California Chicken Sandwich (sub chicken tenders tossed in wing sauce) -Shawn recommended this and it was awesome!  -Nice balance of flavors and textures (crispy vs. creamy) -Seasoned fries were basically mojo potatoes with a subtle seasoning, meh. -Sandwich itself was very good! Pizza -Chicago style -Thick dough, light buttery crispy on bottom -They're known for their pizza, get it if you want Clam Chowder -Surprisingly brilliant! -Honestly, a top notch chowder -Not runny yet not too thick -Nice pieces of clam and great overal flavor! -So good I got some to go for the next day Strawberry Beignet Fresh fried cinnamon sugar light airy donut topped with vanilla ice cream fresh strawberries, strawberry glaze and whipped cream.  -Good, not great. Granted I was beyond full by the time I got to this thing, but the  ""beignet"" was a little chewy for me, not delicate enough. It's seriously hard to go  wrong with strawberries, glaze and ice cream though.  -Stick with the pizookie, it's the classic for a reason!  **DRINKS** HopStorm IPA -hoppy, light spice, acidic -nice finish -It's no Stone IPA or Greenflash but it's good Coconut Mojito -Light, refreshing, thirst-quenching -Had a few sips and this thing is goooooodd.. -Not an overwhelming coconut flavor more like a hint of it All and all, I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this place as much as I did. Just discovered there's a BJ's in my city, yay, I'm already planning on eating here in the next few days!!"
Joseph H.,"Covina, CA",13,12,3,4.0,1/1/2015,"Came in for a brew house burger and a light switch and low and behold, they are showing the ROSE PARADE on the tv with sound on?!? Vanessa the bartender says don't blame her though."
