Alison S.,"Hershey, PA",17,172,7,1.0,3/5/2013,"I opened the menu and BJ's and discovered that they not only include calorie counts on all their dishes; they have almost no dishes that land under 1500 calories! Not wanting to consume my entire day's allotment in one meal,  I ordered the steak because it was lower at 470 (before sides, but I could order veggies).  That was a mistake (pun unintended).  The steak was tough, even cooked med-rare.  Yuck.  My dad did better with the balsamic chicken.  And he says the clam chowder there is very good.   The restaurant, which used to be a club, is enormous and LOUD.  If you want to talk, be sure to ask for seating under the ceilinged area toward the back."
Mrs.K W.,"West Covina, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/18/2015,"I've been a regular customer at BJ's West Covina ever since their opening day, years ago!  ""All of the staff"", waitresses,waiters, bartenders, bus boys,/seaters and managers, are the ""BEST"" of all the BJ's I've dined at (which has only been 3 others)!  B.J. West Covina is just a ""special & unique"" group of people that's good at making you feel right at home.....some even make you feel like family!!!    Speaking of family.....tonite, I'm on my way to say good-bye and give my blessings to my favorite Mgr. ""Patrick"" as he transitions to a new  venture (still with BJs), but living in another state!  Patrick is a working manager, very motivated and has always gone over & beyond the call of duty!  He definitely cares about ""CUSTOMER SATISFACTION""!  He'll be sorely missed.  West Covina's LOSS is the other State's GAIN ,how lucky they are!  :(   Patrick, I'd like to say Thank you for all you do,continue to have the kind, rare & precious heart and personality that you've displayed here at west covina and I'm certain ""continued success"" for your future is right at hand!   Thanks for being such a ""cool"" young man....you always treated me like a friend/family!  Thank You!  I asked God to take you safely to your new destination and to Bless you with peace and serenity as you embark on this new phase of life!    With your Reputation....no problem, this will be a piece-of-cake for you to adjust!  Take care of self & family, keep in touch. And thanks for being the special person you are, God Bless"
Jeanette M.,"Glendora, CA",1,3,,2.0,9/27/2015,I love bjs food however when you order pick up its never the same as ordering in. If your meal usually comes with a small salad it won't when you get it to go. I even told the lady on the phone to remind her and still didn't get it. Quality of food isn't the same either. I live down the street so good will still be warm but not the same. To go service always is horrible and sometimes it's too packed to dine in.
Brandy D.,"Chino, CA",166,47,27,1.0,11/10/2014,"Such a bummer! I normally love BJS and was pretty excited my girlfriend chose here to celebrate her going away. I haven't been for awhile, and was looking forward to their yummy pizza.  I arrived about an hour after the rest of my party. I know I was late, so I totally expected for our server to not approach us right away. We waited. Then we waited. Then we waited some more. He passed by repeatedly and even smile at us? But then he would just pass us by. My husband went to the bar and ordered each of us a beer. Finally I caught his attention, and we ordered food as well as more drinks. From this point on our server was extremely attentive.  Soooo...we ordered the Cali flatbread and OF COURSE the BJS favorite pizza. Our food took a whopping 25 minutes!! It's a Monday night! Like it shouldn't take that long? But then our food came out cold! :( we ate the flat bread because the toppings were fresh tomato and avocado. Those can definitely be eaten cold. But the pizza (oh the pizza I had been craving for what seemed like everrrrr) we had to send back! It wasn't just cold....it was freezing! Cheese wasn't melted, sausage wasn't siZzling, it was just a gross mess. Working in the service industry I understand these things happen. We politely let our server know And he was nice enough to take the plate away. He came back less than five minutes later with the same pizza.....still cold....... At this point we just ate the pizza. No point in sending it back again. Plus we were hungry. Regardless, I'm sad that the visit I was excited about ended with disgusting food."
Nini M.,"Temple City, CA",10,31,10,4.0,8/20/2014,Love this place food is great and staff is also great. My favorite is the strawberry splash.
Kathy L.,"Orange County, CA",69,1139,1515,4.0,7/27/2011,"Ahi poke-- Too much onion or garlic, otherwise big chunks of fresh tuna and avocado  Santa fe spring rolls-- Actual egg roll skins (usually at other places it's like really thick and doughy, so I liked this), small but like 5 whole rolls, so more than expected. Good flavor, though cheese somewhat overpowered the other flavors. Green dipping sauce was a much better complement to the rolls than the orange one. Honey crispy chicken salad-- The pieces of fried chicken were perfect! Nicely fried and crunchy on the outside but so tender on the inside. You don't find good chicken tenders like that often. And the salad itself was excellent too -- the honey mustard dressing wasn't too sweet or mustardy and the nuts added a nice crunch. Surprisingly exceeded expectations since they are known for their pizza and often when you order items off the menu that a restaurant isn't known for, you're in for a disappointment. Plus appetizers were $2 off since it was happy hour. Yay."
Kim W.,"Covina, CA",0,8,1,5.0,8/6/2015,Went to BJ's at Eastland last nite had the best server Desire she had just started her shift and was so fabulous !! Also a shout out to Julio who was not our server but came over to say hello and just check in with us this is why we keep coming back great services and yummy food  Thanks
Jason T.,"Glendora, CA",1,6,5,1.0,8/10/2016,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Came here with my girlfriend to enjoy a lunch date together. I should have known it was going to be interesting when our server had to keep asking what we ordered. He had a notepad in his hand but never wrote anything down. We ordered an appetizer and requested it to come out first. My girlfriend ordered a sandwich that came with a soup. I ordered a small pizza. I also ordered a house beer. After some conversation, my girlfriends soup came to the table. We mentioned to the server (who was different than the one who took our order) that we had ordered an appetizer. He said it was on the way. Finally our appetizer was ready. Next came my pizza. After eating a slice or 2, I completely forgot about my beer that never came. It had been at least 15 minutes at this point. I searched around for our server and couldn't locate him. I even pondered walking to the bar and ordering it myself (which would have been faster). Eventually our server brought my beer. Moments later, one of the managers came to our table to notify us that my girlfriends order had been given to another table, they were re-making her order, and offered to take the appetizer off the bill. We accepted and appreciated the heads up, though it was a big inconvenience as I was almost done with my meal. Our server brought out my girlfriends meal and she immediately noticed it was made wrong. She took a bite then realized it wasn't what she ordered. We waved down the server and he looked at it and even he said it wasn't correct. After finally a third attempt, they brought out the correct order but my girlfriend had already lost her appetite and I was disappointed at the terrible service. I asked to speak to the manager. We spoke to another manager, Luis (or Louis) and explained to him our terrible experience. He did the right thing and offered to cover our entire meal, except for the $4 beer (the one that took 15-20 mins). Well, we ended up leaving them $5 and probably won't be returning to this location. The food wasn't bad (when it was made correctly) which is why this only has 1-star."
Steven D.,"Whittier, CA",7,65,10,2.0,12/12/2015,"I used to love going to BJs. They had the best deep dish pizza. Well Its been a year or so since I last visited and wow has it changed. The quality of the food is just not up to the previous standard. The focus of the restaurant seems to have drifted away from their signature pizza, to more fancy dishes. The pizza quality was disappointing. The pie was missing cheese on some slices and was very dry. I had to request a side of sauce just to make it appetizing. Too bad because I really used to enjoy this place."
Grace G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",41,24,,1.0,5/20/2016,"So the service today sucked. It took 40 minutes for us to get our drinks. I asked for no tomatoes, they still gave me tomatoes. Then when they gave me my new plate supposedly with ""no tomatoes"", there were still a piece of tomato on it left. What if I was allergic to tomatoes? And then when I brought it up to our horrible server, she then told her manager, who then came up to our table pinpointing each piece of red food that possibly looked like a tomato WITH MY FORK correcting me saying which one was a red bell pepper and which one might possibly be a tomato... I felt violated. Thank you horribly slow Asian server and incredibly rude manager who kept poking at my food... No, I won't sue you for the tomatoes in my salad, but I will write your restaurant a bad review."
Kay K.,"La Puente, CA",1,16,11,1.0,7/21/2016,"2nd time coming to this location and the service sucks again. The host was rude didn't even ask how were doing just stuck up like you work at bjs relax. I looked around and saw nothing but poor prebussing, the place just looked dirty. We finally got to our table and our server was Carlos E. Soon as he greeted the table gave a fake hello & you could just tell he did not want to be there & it made us feel awkward cause we were all in a happy mood. He got us out drinks & was rushing to get appetizers in when we haven't even looked at our menu. We finally ordered & enjoyed our food. We finally got the checked and showed him we had a coupon & he gave us a dirty look and made it an issue like come on dude at least fake it to get a good tip but nothing. He did not receive a tip and didn't even bump up his service to get one. He was just rude & fake all around. Look I get it you know I was a server once & you have bad days but you suck it up and get your money. If you don't know how to be friendly, hate what your doing, and can't be genuinely welcoming... YOU SHOULD QUIT & FIND ANOTHER JOB."
Anissa V.,"West Covina, CA",115,4,,1.0,4/10/2016,"Terrible service at this location. Hostess sat us at our table, we sat there for about 15 minutes trying to get any waiters attention as they all acted like they didn't hear us so finally I got up and walked to a waitress I saw at a register and asked her if she could have someone come take our order she said yes so I went back to our table, we waited about another 10 mins and still nobody came so we just decided to leave. Oh and need I mention that we visited this location at 12:00pm when it was not busy what so ever! Also hostess was pretty rude. When leaving I mentioned to her that they forgot about us and she looked to the other hostess that she was talking to and they laughed and said that that's not their job."
Chris A.,"San Dimas, CA",0,5,,5.0,2/5/2016,"Excellent service and food! Had a wedge salad that hit the spot before my wife and I got our custom deep dish pan pizza! Seasoned tomatoes, artichoke and mushroom. Was the best pizza my wife and I had in a really long time! Will be back again soon"
Loraimy E.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/30/2016,"My favorite BJs to go to! Great service every time. Our server Steven P. Outdid himself, superb, friendly, and attentive."
Erik A.,"West Covina, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/30/2016,"Love to come here late at night. Awesome customer service and food is great! My favorite server is Steven. He is very attentive, considerate, and is really friendly. Love the deep dish pizza and pazzukis!"
Alex E.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,1,,5.0,8/30/2016,Steven P was awesome! He was really friendly and always checked up on us to make sure we were ok on drinks.
Lenin C.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,2,,5.0,8/30/2016,We came here on a tuesday night and the wait was not too bad. Only about 15 minutes for a party of 9. The food was great and the mini pizza was half off for happy hour! We then ordered the huge pizookie which awesome for big parties and has a great value! Our server was Steven and he made the experience quite enjoyable!
G C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",7,118,42,1.0,11/17/2015,"Oh Bj's you disappointed me.Went in in the evening had to wait about 30-40 min which was ok ..it was not obvious people have to wait during the weekend.But once we got seated we took our order and waited about 25 min to get our food.We ordered an appetizer also and it was awful.Never again will i go to this Bj's.Very slow service ,expensive food,mediocre food ."
Abby V.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",392,10,7,5.0,5/31/2015,John F was super chill and an amazing waiter. Always checked up on us and made my friends 21st birthday experience amazing. If you ever come to this BJ's ask for him. Have never had such amazing customer service ever.
Tony G.,"Alhambra, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/23/2017,"Never again stepping a foot inside this BJ's , very disappointed with the service and lack of professionalism, too many employees for the type of service you get! Got seated next to 5 dirty tables with dirty plates, bones, bread crumbs and nobody to pick up around, waiter only took people's orders and picked up money but never bothered to pick up any plates around him, like 5 employees saw all these dirty tables but nobody to pick up, disgusting I couldn't even eat! And the tables were so close to each other that I was looking at nothing but dirty food the whole time, it took them 45 minutes to get them picked up after people started complaining, most likely there were more dirty tables than people how sad, and 3 waiters and Bussers just chit chatting in the lil back section where they have their extra plates like not careing about the type of service everybody is receiving which was shitty, never have I been so uncomfortable in a restaurant, NEVER, these employees are ridiculous and worst part where the hell was the manager, I asked for him and never came and other tables were complaining too about dirty plates everywhere and very disgusting dirty tables and no manager still to give a face, 2 other employees on their phones just walking around texting and talking, but never nobody bothered to pick up plates around them, until a waitress dark skinned waivy curly hair was taking over the shift for our waiter she seen all the dirty tables they were leaving her and immediately gathered up the 2 waiters from that section and demanded for them to pick up those tables before leaving because where the hell would she sit her guests with all the TABLES being dirty! I did not even see a bussboy unless it was the 2 walking around in their phone and hiding the whole time! Never again stepping a foot in here, I came for service if not I woulda gone w fast food besides our order taking 45 mins for 2 people! And when walking out 5 employees chit chatting in the front desk as well, like WOW that's where they all hang I guess and where the hell is the manager unless their isn't any! Ridiculous!"
