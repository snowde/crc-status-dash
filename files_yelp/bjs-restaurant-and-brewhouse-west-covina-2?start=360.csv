Liz C.,"Bakersfield, CA",61,2,,1.0,1/4/2017,"Really bad service. After waiting for a table for 2, we were finally seated and had to wait another 20 minutes before a waitress finally noticed us and took our drink orders. We watched people seated after us be helped first. She was nice and the meal was good but then after she brought us the check she was nowhere to be seen again. We had already been at the restaurant for a good two hours and just wanted to get out of there. Eventually we went up to the front wondering if maybe we were supposed to pay our bill there and the hostess just told us we have to go back to our table and pay with our server. We told her we'd been sitting there forever and couldn't find her and the hostess just said sorry. We went back to our table and sat there some more, clearly irritated, before a bus boy finally noticed and went to swipe our card real fast. We could have very easily just walked out without paying since no one was even paying attention to us. Don't leave customers waiting to pay the bill for over 30 minutes. Not a good experience."
Heather C.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",19,16,37,5.0,10/22/2014,Went there today for a business lunch and had a great time. Service was great. Food was great. The atmosphere was great. The price was great. Everything came out in a timely manor and was nothing less then expected.
Nadine O.,"San Dimas, CA",1,13,4,1.0,8/9/2015,"If you have David as your waiter, good luck. We got seated and it took him 15 mins to acknowledge us and tell us he'd be right with us. When he finally came to order our drinks he gave me a funny look because I ordered two waters one with & one without ice. We also ordered our food because he had taken so long. Took twenty minutes to get our food and he only checked on us once. We had to ask different servers for refills and our condiments throughout the night. When we ordered our pazookie that took another 15 minutes to get to us and when we got it the cookie was rock hard. I flagged down the first waiter I saw and told him. He came back in two minutes with a new perfect warm pazookie. Don't think I will dine at this bjs again. Definitely will travel extra to go to the chino hills one, way better service there."
Chris D.,"Anaheim, CA",148,100,9,3.0,11/8/2014,"In the mall area lots of parking but at night you'll have to park further away. Saturday nights are packed, very loud restaurant/bar; not good for a date night.  The wait staff was very attentive considering how full the restaurant was and our large party of 10. The ahi poke was tasty with the wonton chips, the onions rings/strands were zesty and the artichoke dip was cheesy and hot temperature wise.  We ordered a lot of burgers but instead of cooking it to the right temp, it seemed like they were all cooked to medium well. So why even ask what temp people want it?"
Kristine P.,"West Covina, CA",24,7,10,4.0,11/10/2015,"Great customer service from servers to manager. Ordered the steak medium but received it dry, well done. Our server took it back right away to replace it and the manager came to our table shortly after to apologize & offered if we wanted anything else for both me & hubby. We just added a salad since we're getting stuffed from the soup & calamari. The steak came back out juicy & more veggies."
Jocelyn V.,"Covina, CA",71,20,12,4.0,10/17/2015,BJs in West Covina never disappoints! Fast and friendly service :) I always come for the avocado rolls!
Andy H.,"Covina, CA",54,16,8,4.0,2/3/2016,"I live walking distance from here and it's still my go to place for a quick bite and a pint. The beer selection has definitely improved, and the bartender was very kind to offer me a few tasters before I made my choice. Service was average though as we had to ask a few times for water and random things. Busy for a Wednesday night but good atmosphere nonetheless. Food was decent and the Pizookie as good as usual."
Bryan S.,"Upland, CA",165,12,,1.0,4/9/2014,"I almost never complain or even write a review as you can see based on my account history, but after my experience last night I am forced to write this. Last night was my 33rd birthday, and I decided to have dinner here with my parent, my brother, my girlfriend, and her family. This was a Tuesday night at around 8pm. This isn't a busy night or time so I figured for a party of 8 this would work out quite well. I have been to this BJs countless times with my family and friends, so this led to my choice. Last night was the worst service I have ever received at any restaurant ever. Our party was sat and we waited upwards of 20 minutes. Then once our orders were taken the food took nearly 90 minutes before it was served. During that time our waiter came to the table twice. He was rushed, non-attentive, and overall a bad server. Finally the food came out, after two people in my party left because of the service, and most of the table wasn't even hungry any longer. Most of the table simply boxed the food. My brother, who also happens to be a food service employee, went to speak to the manager and explain the situation and received a cold and standard response that any automated life form might give. This was embarassing to me and my party.  Then the manager had the audacity to come to the table, after my girlfriend had paid the check, and said sorry and that he felt bad. He then offered a $25 gift card, which wasn't even 10% of the check. It was obvious by his tone and his general demeanor that he could careless.  I wanted to thank BJ's for ruining my 33rd birthday and wasting my girlfriend's money. I will never go to this BJ's again, eventhough it is less than a mile away from my house. And to be quite honest I will have to think long and hard about ever stepping into another BJ's again."
Joann L.,"West Covina, CA",94,56,36,2.0,8/26/2014,Horrible night ever there.. frst time sitting in th bar area just to have drinks and dessert. For a Monday we thought it wont be that busy (which it wasnt) we get there order our drinks it took 20 mins.. we Â are in tge bar hello not good in my book. Then we order 2 just 2 pazookies and r u ready for this a whole freaking hour it took for 1 mini and 1 regular size. They came out and were hard no soft cookie middle. Althow the hightlight was our waiter friend got off early and had drinks with us so tht was a olus and turned the night around all in al   Shame sham BJ's
Cindy V.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,5,5,5.0,7/11/2016,Our waiter was amazing!!! Steven is the best!!! The food was great. Drinks was amazing as well. All around amazing restaurant with amazing help.
Vivian P.,"West Covina, CA",60,21,4,1.0,7/10/2014,"Wow this BJ's location kinda sucks compared to the one I usually go to in the City of Industry. We go in around 5 and it is not busy at all. The person in the front is so rude! She asked if we wanted the sit in the tall tables and whatnot and me and my boyfriend were okay with it.  But we realize there were booths open and no one had served us yet so we go back up and ask if we can be seated in the booths. And this girl acts like it's the HUGEST inconvenience. Seriously there is nobody else waiting and it is not busy at all, and all she had to do was see if there were any booths available. She didn't even have to take us to our seats.  So after that we order our food, and I got the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My order did not meet my expectations, as it was very bland, especially the pineapple fried rice that came with it. Very little rice, and generally flavorless except for the pineapple bits. The fish was bland as well. I think it's pretty funny how they gave a teensy bit of sriracha sauce on the side. It seemed like they were attempting a design but it ended up looking like a mess.  Boyfriend said that his was pretty bland too. The waiter was okay, but he was extremely busy to the point where he asked us if we wanted a pizookie but then left abruptly before I could even answer. And then took forever for the bill.  Overall, horrible experience at this place."
Amanda G.,"San Dimas, CA",1,6,,1.0,6/21/2016,"I don't expect great service when I come to this restaurant. I enjoy the food which is why I come back. I went there tonight and my table was asked if we wanted any desserts...being famous for their dessert we ordered 2 monkey breads. Our server came back a couple minutes later and told us that the kitchen was closed so we couldn't get dessert. If you know that the kitchen is closing, our server should have asked us before the kitchen closed. Either way we ordered our desserts at 12:05 which was 5 minutes after they closed. As a restaurant, I would at least give your customers a chance to have dessert."
Miguel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",643,894,860,3.0,6/14/2012,"Sadly, the most memorable thing about this BJ's was the little piece of straw paper (at least I hope that's what it was) floating in my Berry Burst drink. I love the Berry Burst drink and solely based on that I'm giving BJ's three stars. Oh, how I love you Berry Burst and I can thank Lydia B. for introducing me to it! This drink is pretty much the only reason I come to BJ's. Oh, I also like the Pazookies! I had a great time with my buddy Lydia B.! I always enjoy the Pesto Pizza here. Lydia ordered some good stuffed mushrooms and meatballs. I also ordered some Thai wraps which were very, very disappointing. The service was not bad, but not memorable either. Parking is not much of an issue since this BJ's is in a major mall."
Ashley N.,"Greenville, SC",83,329,247,3.0,7/13/2015,"So unimpressed!! While in town my mother and I stopped in for a quick beer and some Togo food. We sat up at the bar since it was a fairly busy night. Once we sat down, it took another customer flagging down a bartender to get us menus. Mind you he watched us sit down and had walked past us 3 times. I have been to this restaurant on the east coast and they were not nearly as rude. He gave us menus but in the meantime another gentlemen who had been very busy came over to help us. My mother ordered a goose island and I got BJs peach beer. For our Togo food I ordered an ahi tuna salad and my mother a cherry salmon entree. When we got our Togo food there were no utensils in the bag so our server went and got us some. Â Once we got back to the hotel I dived into my salad. Â The lettuce tasted dirty and there minimal to no dressing on it at all. I know that the foodservice here can be good but was lacking this experience."
Anthony R.,"Vacaville, CA",215,18,12,4.0,7/12/2014,"My first time here for weekend brunch. The usual breakfast fare of omelettes, pancakes, and French toast, but with the BJ's flare. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside potatoes, delicious pancakes, and the enlightened veggie is perfect for anyone in the Mediterranean mood. Coffee wasn't burnt and actually tasted good! There wasn't anything noteworthy that would make this a regular trip, but will be back sometime in the future. Payton was a great waitress too!"
Juan L.,"Duarte, CA",199,3,,1.0,7/25/2016,I came in and sat at the bar yesterday morning with my family. Our server was Brittany. She has bright red hair and had her hair 1/2 up 1/2 down (hope no one gets red hair in there food). She was very rude to my girlfriend. She asked for water with lemon and Brittany Â rolled her eyes at her. She did end up ordering a mimosa later. But because we sat in the bar and didn't order drinks right away Brittany looked mad. We ordered Â avocado egg rolls. They are amazing the young Mexican man that dropped it off was very nice and even smiled. (The first one we saw all day) Brittany never came by to see how we were doing. We had to ask another server to get her so we could order. She came up to us still seemed like she was mad and didn't want to be at work. We ordered a large bj favorite. The pizza was good. We then saw Brittany walk by and heard her talking to another server about someone very rude to do that with guest all around that can hear her. She had time to walk around and no time to get us a refill or ask if we needed anything. She finally came by and I asked if I could talk to a manager. She never got one because they never came. So if I come back I will make sure I don't have her. 3 stars for food 1 for Brittany. If you don't want to work don't have a job and I'm sure talking about people isn't allowed at work. I hope whoever she was talking about doesn't find out because nothing was nice. Karma comes around.
Michelle F.,"Revere, MA",0,69,7,2.0,6/11/2016,"First time here and the food was ok (nothing worth waiting 30 mins to be seated) then the server need to read the menu because he gave me wrong information... Another server came and she brought the check to us, 20 mins later still no dessert... When I asked the server she HAD THE NERVE to ask for the receipt, this ""girl"" wanted to check if we paid for the dessert, really??? Horrible customer service!! If you can just avoid coming to this place. Oh! Btw her name is Atiana P."
Josh R.,"å°åå¸, Taiwan",724,102,203,3.0,8/2/2015,Good all around American cuisine. Like the pizza here everything I have ordered has always been tasty. Love the cookie in a pan dessert with ice cream. Also if you sign up for the email list you can also get something for free for your birthday. They also have a bus card I believe that you get points for dinning and rewards. Always nice to find places rewarding you for your business.
Desiree M.,"West Covina, CA",584,103,313,5.0,3/7/2014,"CHrystal is the best server ! She helped us out for my birthday a few months ago and today, I remembered her for how awesome she is ! Always on top of her shiet with a beautiful smile.. That's the kind of service I love to have. Came in for lunch specials, the margherita flatbread and salad is delicious! Also had the beer samplers which are always yummy.. They took it down to 4 beer tasters from what I believe was 6 or 7. I love the Tatonka, Jeremiah, Hef, and had the Abbey normal which is a seasonal. Gotta try the tasters !"
Megan W.,"San Dimas, CA",102,26,5,5.0,8/5/2015,"Food was delicious and the service was great! The waiter was very helpful and friendly, and the bill was not as expensive as I thought."
