Cesar C.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,40,62,5.0,6/28/2015,"Good service, good food, they are not stingy, they serve more than enough! Our waitress Kathryn was awesome and checked in on us often."
Neal G.,"Chino, CA",98,3,2,1.0,6/5/2014,"Just had by far the worst experience here of all the times ive been here.  Party of seven waited half an hour when the buzzer finally went off gathered the family when we came up had to wait more somehow they had already given away our table!  We ordered simple things: 2 pizzas 2 kids meals and bunch of appetizers.....first the appetizers never came the pizzas came and kids meals. We were missing the sides for the kids meals and luckily manager came by to find out happened with our appetizers. Well the food was supposedly just ""sitting there"" and never got delivered. Kids fries never came came and we cancelled the appetizers order. Never coming back"
J M.,"San Dimas, CA",48,108,195,3.0,5/7/2014,"Order online ahead and get 20% off. This isn't the best DJs I'd recommend but definitely send menu has any other. The branch kind of sucks on Sundays hey bring the family one day to try it out and regretted not going to Denny's for norms which are just down the street. Happy hour is always great it's minimal finger food and mainly house years which can never go wrong. The reason I gave this place three stars is the service is pretty crappy at this location I have been here more than five occasions and have been disappointed, luckily it's the local BJ's so my options are very limited other than going to Montbello or Chino hills."
Ginger P.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,47,7,2.0,2/22/2015,"Okay, so... I love Bj's, always have. But this location... the service is ehhhh. The bar seems to only cater to regulars and if you are not one don't expect any kind of decent service. The hostess always has a lovely greeting which misleads you into thinking you might have a great dinning experience,  but once you pass that line you enter a whole new world. Forgotten orders, rude bartenders and rushed service. Very sad, but thankfully there are many locations that we can still enjoy."
Liz H.,"West Covina, CA",311,9,,1.0,11/10/2015,Horrible service. Waited had a bad fucking attitude and only came once to see if we were okay. Hostess was not paying attention to guests names and wait times. Food took forever and never came to refill drinks or take plates away. I cannot stress it enough on how fucking horrible the service was here! Don't pay for shitty service!
Tracy W.,"San Dimas, CA",71,90,30,5.0,8/15/2014,"I went there for dinner tonight and had great service from David. Got the 2 for 22. Great deal 2 salads medium pizza and a pizookie. So when I left I realized I forgot my leftover pizza. So I went back and told the Togo girl Mary what happened, now mind you I came back 2 minutes after I left. So anyway I told her what happened and the kitchen manager Eric just happened to be there and heard my complaint so he went above and beyond customer service and made me a whole new medium great white pizza!!!! I was shocked by this since they really didn't have to do that. So needless to say Mary and Eric showed me excellent customer service!!! I'm happy and I will definitely be back!!!!"
Taylor-Marie A.,"Las Vegas, NV",316,5,5,3.0,10/2/2015,Don't get the Brisket Bacon Burger. It's only a dollop of chopped brisket on the burger. The manager came to apologized and we ordered something else. She offered a free salad or soup while we wait. The pastas are a good size.
Tammy C.,"San Dimas, CA",309,468,878,4.0,11/12/2012,They have delicious chili in a sourdough bowl. Finish witha pizookie MMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Cole P.,"Glendora, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/1/2016,The restaurant was 5 stars. Our waiter Steven P was excellent and was very attentive he also made the restaurant feel like I was home for a thanksgiving meal. We were seated quickly and the food was great.
Chip H.,"La Puente, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/15/2015,"Horrible.  First we were seated right against a bus station, and the waitstaff kept slamming things loudly and violently against the back of our seats.  Then later a waiter was talking to a waitress using profanity loud enough for me, my wife, and our children to hear.  Our order took nearly an hour to bring out(--on a Tuesday evening!), and both my sandwich and my wife's pizza were cold.  I ordered another beer before our food came out, and it was brought to the table when we were all done eating.  Don't bother with this place.  It used to be OK, now terrible.  Will not be back."
Richard E.,"Torrance, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/4/2016,The service here is terrible! They told us it was going to be a five minute wait but it ended up being 25 minutes because they were seating people out of order. Everybody waiting was angry and complaining. The food was really good but the waitor took too long clearing the table and asking for refills. I'd rather find a different BJs to eat at. Poorly trained staff!
Lawrence L.,"Covina, CA",513,1037,7335,4.0,10/17/2010,"2010 Game 1 NLCS Lincecum vs. Halladay... just needed to decide where to hang out to watch the game... BJ's is the answer for casual, cool vibes, and multiple screens to watch a sporting event, and it's close by for us... Sat at the bar and for libations ordered the 8 taster set of beer... liked the Piranah Pale Ale and the Jeremiah Red the most, the Lightswitch Lager and the Brewhouse Blonde which were pretty weak the least.  My better half had a half pint Oktoberfest which is pretty good too.  For eats, we ordered the Flat Bread Margherita Fresca pizza and the Best Beginnings appetizer plate... we liked the Margherita pizza  the best, it was light and crisp, nice change for a pizza...  we also liked the spinach artichoke dip of the appetizer sampler the best, the smokey taste was bomb! Great place to hang out w/friends... gets busy and parking is nuts sometimes so be prepared..."
Tammy L.,"Glendora, CA",218,105,32,1.0,7/8/2014,"came here yesterday with my family and ugh, what is with this BJ's?  We were lucky and the wait wasn't too long. Honestly, I have never had this pushy of a service as I have here. The waiter (i wont mention names, though I'll remember him), I felt like he was trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, and OMG, it was freaking salty, I drank a whole glass of water after eating one slice. (and i don't drink that much water at all). This was the worse pizza I've had here. We got the calamari appetizer which was lightly fried and pretty good. Hubby ordered the handcrafted root beer, which came with no ice (NO ICE????) what the heck... that was odd.  Overall, I like BJ's but I will not come back to this locations, and Def not order the buffalo chicken pizza ever again."
T K.,"West Los Angeles, CA",0,123,19,1.0,2/15/2014,"This review is not for food. It's a chain, they all meet certain standard. It's about the hostess.  Walked in, saw couple hostess at the stand. Just took names of one group, and one of the hostess walked away. The remaining one talked to the lady before us, then started to play with her touch screen system, played with her long blonde hair. Three minutes passed, she looked up ans saw me, I was about to tell her our name and how many in the party, but before I could say anything, she told me to wait. I thought she was having trouble with her system, so I waited.   Few minutes later, an older gentleman walked in and she took his name. right aftet that, she was going to take another lady's name down.  At this point , me and bf just turned around and left. We are now down the other side of the mall at TGI Friday, got way better treatment."
Daisy R.,"Covina, CA",180,17,9,3.0,9/5/2015,when i went it was really dead there were a lot of employees just standing around they took 25 min to sit us but the food was amazing ill give them that. The hostess did not know what he was doing though.
Victoria A.,"Pomona, CA",15,16,,2.0,1/20/2014,"It doesn't hurt to smile! Or say you're welcome at least once!!  The 2 stars are for the service only. The food was excellent as always, but the server and 1 of the runners were rude as heck.  Overall, I will not return to that location. Chino Hills has a better vibe."
Heather H.,"West Covina, CA",2,13,,1.0,4/28/2015,I have gone here about 6 different times. I don't get how a restaurant can be so bad and have so many locations.  First off some of the worst service you will get. Do not expect fast or friendly service. The food is about a 4 out of 10. If you eat here you will be there a long time so don't think you can have a quick lunch.
Rachel L.,"West Covina, CA",35,4,2,5.0,11/21/2015,"I have Celiac Disease, so eating out is tough. However, the general manager (Chris) went above and beyond for me. Nothing on the menu interested me so he offered to send one of his employees to get me food. I thought he was kidding. I wrote down my order for Chipotle and he sent his employee right away. If you're ever worried of eating out because of food restrictions, just ask! I've been to two BJ's in the past 24 hours and in both instances they were very accommodating. I wish there was more than 5 stars!! Can't say enough good things about them!"
Sergio L.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,9,1,5.0,11/19/2014,Omg the Parmesan credited chicken was excellent I could of used a piece on bread with it but SHEA our server omg 100% on customer service kept our drinks coming checked on us omg !! We love him !! Will be coming when he bartends !!
Miranda W.,"Upland, CA",1,5,2,4.0,9/23/2015,"We usually love coming to this BJ's, but recently we have been slightly disappointed. We used to go about once a week, but we have stopped going as often because their service has been lacking. Today, we came in at 11 and there were probably 5 other parties in the restaurant- it was pretty dead. We were seated immediately, and our drinks came right away. We ordered our food, but it didn't come for about 45 minutes, despite the fact that it wasn't busy at all. Our waiter didn't really check up on us, so we were left wondering if our food was coming at all. We finally got our food, ate it, and then ordered a pizookie. It took a long time for that to come out as well. We thought about just leaving, but couldn't because the waiter was nowhere to be found in order for us to get the check from him. Overall, the food is still good. You won't be disappointed there. However, the service and the kitchen have been rather disappointing lately. ***Update: We just left, and had an amazing experience. Michelle H served us, and she was great! Very friendly and attentive. The food was very timely and the drinks came out quickly as well. Good to see that they got their service together since we last came here."
