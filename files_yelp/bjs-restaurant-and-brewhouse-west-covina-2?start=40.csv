Yolanda G.,"Covina, CA",4,7,6,1.0,10/24/2017,"1 Star because of service. Why bother offering a service you can't provide?! I ordered curbside pick up today. When I arrived there were no available parking spaces, then I called in several times and no one answered the phone.  When I walked in I had to wait about 10-15 Minutes before I was even acknowledged. When I was finally acknowledged I asked the server if they were answering the phone today and the sever said, ""did you try calling? Did you order curbside? we can't always hear the phone, it's loud in here"". Seriously?! No tip for you.  Food was good but terrible service and attitude. Management understaffed for a busy day. I use to like this place."
Shawna C.,"Oxnard, CA",26,5,10,1.0,6/23/2017,I'm only giving one star because yelp makes you do that. I ate here last night I ordered a side salad and to my surprise I got more then just a salad. I was about 4 bites into it and I noticed it tasted a little different I thought maybe the ranch dressing was a little bitter and after mixing the salad around some more I found a dead baby frog. Yes I said FROG! I've never experienced anything in my life like that. I informed the manager and he offered to comp our meal. I said no you can keep the food we are not eating here. He explained that there produce comes from a vendor but don't they wash there vegs before serving? I told him this frog could contain salmonella and who knows how long it's been sitting in a produce bag and he still made us pay for our drinks which consisting of three beers total! I mean really I just found a frog in my food from a place that dosent even carry frog and I still gotta pay for my drinks and take the people I'm with to go eat somewhere else! I spoke with there corporate office who said sorry and sent me a 50.00 gift card what a joke. Please inspect your food from here if you go Bjs has responded to my review and thank you. But I'm disappointed that it took over a week to respond even after they had been responding to other reviews that were posted after mine.
Beah R.,"City of Industry, CA",307,69,43,1.0,6/24/2017,"I've been coming to this BJ's since 2011 and always recommended this branch to family and friends. However, I don't know what happened between now and 6 years ago but quality has certainly gone down.  I went here a few nights ago to celebrate with my significant other by grabbing a nice dinner. To begin with, there were no hostess at the front. We waited a good ten minutes to flag someone down to check us in. When we were called to our seats we were greeted by a gentlemen who introduced himself as our server.  My boyfriend ordered a burger, and I ordered a medium pizza with 2 cups of ranch. Our appetizer came first and we finished it right away since we didn't eat all day. About fifteen minutes later or so, our pizza and burger is dropped off and my pizza is flat out cold. The crust tasted stale and the cheese wasn't even melting into the dough! I could not find my server anywhere because he literally dropped it off and walked away. I flagged down another server who I made the complaint to and he took my pizza and microwaved it?? I think that's a little gross.  If your restaurant was understaffed then organize the tables and settings better so no customers order is left behind. I am not okay with paying like $15 for a cold mediocre pizza I could have gotten cheaper, better, and more fresh at a 7-11.  I don't think I'll be visiting this branch again."
Emy S.,"West Covina, CA",240,42,256,5.0,7/9/2017,"Yesterday I ordered the party pack for 30 people. From the time I placed the other to the time I received it. All the team member and the management team are very organized. It is such a special day for our DAD. We want to make sure everything will be good. The funeral was at forest lawn. Food was fully organized with labels and the trimmings. Utensils, Plates, napkins and serving utensils. If anyone having a big gatherings Bjs party pack is your best choice. They even bake the pizookie in cookies form. Ommmmggg that was sooo good. My family and I are very grateful and thank the team for taking care my dads funeral. It was a lovely night."
William B.,"Covina, CA",0,5,2,1.0,8/31/2017,"Once again bad service. Salad,soup and Main entree arrived together.  This place is consistently bad. I eat out a lot. I would never eat at this place only my family likes going here. I've eaten at other BJ's and the service and food is generally very good.  BJ Corporation needs to fire the manager.  This place is consistently very bad. I wish I could give no stars. ZDJBZqH4"
Aina I.,"Glendora, CA",1,10,,1.0,6/24/2017,"I usually have no problems with this BJ's at all, but it was just horrible the last time that I decided to have dinner here. My friends and I came here and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. We were starving from a tiring day so we were excited to start ordering our food. I found it odd that they did not take our drink orders right away l, but we decided to wait patiently because it was clearly a very busy dinner.  After about 25 minutes of waiting we FINALLY got a waiter to take our order, we had to catch the attention of a waiter just walking by. The waiter took our order and said that we would get free dessert, that somewhat made up for it but the wait for our food was ridiculous. A waiter later came up to us an apologized because he apparently forgot that we were part of his section. He was paying more attention to a bigger party of people next to our table.  It was the end of our dinner and we then waited another 30 minutes or so for our free desserts. At this point of the night we were there for over 4 hours when we were expecting to be done with dinner in 2. We finally got our desserts and had to wait a little longer for the check just to be give to us. Overall it was a horrible experience, even though we got free desserts it still upset me that a big named business would treat customers like this. Not planning on coming back here again."
Keny T.,"Walnut, CA",349,33,4,2.0,6/19/2017,"I've had pizzas at BJ's enough to know that this is not normal. Toppings off and the bread looks like it's been baked without the toppings. Where's the tomato sauce? I ordered two large pizzas and the both look like this. It looks like the dough was baked first, toppings added, and baked again. It was quite disappointing and I know the company can do so much better. I usually enjoy the pizzas at BJ's, but this time didn't cut it. Literally, pizza was cut into odd shapes. How's a rectangular slice of pizza sound?"
Jessica K.,"West Covina, CA",161,17,,1.0,6/16/2017,"This was the worst I've ever been treated at BJ's.  I've been a faithful customer of BJ's throughout my life, going whenever there were celebrations to be had or for reuinions.  The food's good, the service is usually nice, and there's so many BJ's around that I can find one pretty quickly. Unfortunately, I will never be coming back to this one again. It was my friend's birthday yesterday.  I arrived at 7:15 PM.  The manager (blonde lady) was kind enough to help me sign in because none of the hostesses were paying me any attention even though I was standing at the counter.  We had 7 people, and she promised that it'll only take a 30 minute wait. So I went outside, my friends arrived, and 7:45 passed.  We wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt because it was busy, so we waited until 8:00, so we went to go check in to make sure I didn't realize the text message.  The manager was nowhere to be seen, so I went in to check with the hostesses (that blatantly ignored me before :( ) so I asked her, saying that I waited for 45 minutes already, and wondering what was going on.  And the girl was like oh!  we sat aside a SPECIFIC table for you so we're waiting for the people to leave.  But you guys are next!   (keep in mind, parties of 10, 19, 8 were called when we were promised to be next) So we were like oh that's fine, and then twenty minutes later (we waited for an HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES) she came back to us and said ""Hi, your table is READY, but...it may be too small to fit all seven of you.""  And we've already waited 2x the waittime promised, and we were promised that these hostesses were HOLDING A TABLE FOR US WHICH LENGTHENED OUR WAITING TIME ??????  WE WAITED 2X BECAUSE WE WERE WAITING FOR A SPECIFIC TABLE and then you come to us and say the TABLE CAN'T FIT US?  I don't understand, can they not realize you cannot fit seven people in a booth meant for FIVE?  When we went to check it out, every party who was sitting in those booths had FOUR or FIVE people. So we said, sorry this table cannot fit us, and they said oh, don't worry just wait 20 minutes longer and we'll get you a bigger table.  40 minutes later...table was finally ready.  We looked at each other, and thought, if their seating was THIS HORRIBLE, how would their waiters be on this night?   our night was already ruined, and it was my friend's birthday!  those hostesses kept giving us attitude and we were almost SURE we were asked to wait 40 minutes for the extra table just because they didn't like us.  because we had the NERVE to wonder why we weren't seated yet when we've already waited one hour and ten minutes.  we waited for two hours for a table...but BJ's already screwed up on SIMPLY SEATING us so we just left."
Lauren K.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",1,4,5,1.0,9/4/2017,"*************PLEASE READ************* Bj serves food in big quantities. They're food is pretty decent. But, there is one con that has lead me to give Bj's one star. You have to wait an eternity waiting for it. By the time your food comes out, your children would probably graduate and wait for you. If you are a loner that has plenty of time, this is the perfect place for you. They only serve girls with wet hair that they fixed in the restroom, but will not serve hungry children. Please give us free guac, and I will change the 1 star into a 5."
F L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,109,182,5.0,9/13/2017,"BJ's Puente Hills is the bomb. Come during Happy Hour for great drink and food specials. The array of TVs to watch your favorite team is just right. They keep the volume just right, not so loud you can't hear yourself think. The service, is pleasant. The wait staff is knowledgeable and courteous.  The food...hey it's BJ's. The selection of food is amazing. The pizzas are phenomenal and the avocado rolls are delicious. Everything else, is all good and very tasty. The non Happy Hour prices are a little more than Fridays and Chilis, BUT, the flavors are definitely more inviting. BEER selection....fantastic See you at BJ's !!!"
Aurora W.,"Alhambra, CA",630,272,1530,3.0,6/4/2016,"Happy hour with the coworkers!  Totally needed on a Friday after work. :) I believe their happy hour begins around 3-4pm and ends around 7pm?  Pretty basic formula for prices, $1 off drinks (wine/beer/mixed drinks), $2 off appetizers, and 1/2 off pizzas (mini included).  Their food is decent.  I got their mini Mediterranean pizza and while the toppings were good (chicken/cheese/olives/ pepporchinis), their crust was definitely SOFT.  I like my crust crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, like most deep dish pizzas are.  I remember BJ's pizza to have that amazing crust, but unfortunately it didn't happen this time around.  My coworker had the same issue with his mini pizza.  Not sure if they were both slightly undercooked? Drinks were decent.  They have a wide variety for relatively reasonable prices, since it only cost about $5-6 for a beer or glass of wine.   Service left much to be desired, though.  My coworker said that he was sitting there for about 20 minutes alone before anyone even acknowledged him.  Definitely needs improvement in this area."
Chel R.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",14,706,4505,3.0,11/28/2016,"#85 Review for the 2016 Yelp 100 Challenge  I typically don't like to boast my Yelp Elite status to non Yelpers.  Somehow they will eventually find out on their own.  Only then will I show 'em some Yelp Elite Pride! Hahaha.  Tonight, Mr GM decided to take me here for dinner on date night.  Was he trying to send me a message deciding on this establishment?  Well rest assure, it was definitely lost in translation! Hahaha It was such a busy Tuesday night on Thanksgiving week.  Needless to say,  it was super loud and very difficult to hear each other.  Then I thought,  he did this on purpose so he could sit hip to hip with me in our booth.   Which we did.  Besides, there was no way to hear each other had we stayed across from one another.  And yes, I know it's a bar with multiple flat screens...as with any other BJs, like the one I frequent at City of industry merely for drinks. Anyway, on to the review... The BAD- Not date-friendly atmosphere. Great with if I was with friends who wouldn't mind almost screaming to have a conversation..  the aesthetics were just horrible! Service, although courteous, was extremely slow AF!   Slow to get our drink and food orders.  About 30 minutes.  That's just to order.  There were more irritating delays- I ordered a glass of Cab.  He originally ordered a Moscow mule, although not on the menu,  our server said they will do it for him.  Only to return 20 minutes later to say they ran out of ginger beer.  So he decided on piña cold which he couldn't even drink because the sweetness took over the entire drink.  I honestly thought it was a virgin drink.  So then he decided on a glass of Merlot.  Took another 30 minutes for that.  SmH.  The GOOD- We ordered and shared, their seasoned rare tuna salad and spinach artichoke dip.  The seasoned, seared rare ahi tuna came fully dressed with greens and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette, served with avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, wasabi for a kick, and strips of wonton  and scallions.   3/5 stars. Their spinach and artichoke dip bumped this review to a solid 3 stars! It was absolutely delish IMO.  Rich and creamy with good chunks of artichokes and spinach with the right amount of flavoring & consistency,  topped with parmesean cheese made for a great dip with tortilla chips! 5/5 stars! I'd definitely return for this dip alone!!! Cheers! #thankful#always#GM"
Will G.,"Brea, CA",46,61,298,4.0,6/17/2017,"West Covina...man is it HOT outside!! We waited quite a while to get in to this location - about 35-40 minutes, but, when you show up w a party of 13...you gotta expect a bit of a wait. They really should consider taking reservations for parties over 8!  Kelly was our server - and a very good one he was. Super-attentive. Very patient. Always smiled and was polite.  Took the beverage order and when he came back for the rest of the order and no one was ready - he said he'd be back in 5 minutes and he was.  I order the Super Salad w/ Blackened Shrimp and was told to order the chili.  Others in my group had the Clam Chowder; the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl; the Appetizer Sampler Platter; the Lemon Thyme Chicken; and the Rib Eye Steak w White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes.  I was not so happy w my choice because I felt the dressing didn't represent properly. It needed more acidity. I did ask for extra lemons and got them rather quickly.  Now, I know what you're thinking...if you didn't really like your food - why the 4-Stars?  First, I have eaten at many BJ's and have ALWAYS enjoyed the food. This IS a new item and it just wasn't something I would order again.  2nd, dining out is so much more than just about the food - it's about the entire experience.  It happens to be that I had someone w Me who had a few dietary challenges. I called Kelly aside before everyone started ordering and explained that to him. He was very careful to take in everything I was saying and placed the order exactly as I requested. That may not sound like much to most people but the fact that he practically stopped everything to listen carefully when I was ordering something NOT ON THE MENU was so very appreciated.  I also had the Bowl of Chili which had a nice heat to it. Of course I like MORE heat but, the flavor was so on point it reminded of canned chili but done up! Sounds weird I know. It was tasty.  I tried my friends White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and was pleasantly surprised. I can instantly taste the white Cheddar and spices. I recommend you get some with any entree, sandwich or salad you order or simply order as a side dish. Yup THAT good. If you like beer...DUH! The beer is served ICE COLD! I had the Heff on tap!  The Rib Eye was cooked perfectly!  The Clam Chowder was tasty and had a lot of clams. When you get a waiter that hovers and you notice it - it's annoying. But, when you get one that hovers and you only know he's been there because your glass is filled and no one wants for anything - he's good at what he does! And as such he should be appreciated and tipped.  When he brought the check - the table applauded him. He was so embarrassed.  When I tipped him a hefty amount on a check for 13 people - he blushed.  As I left the restaurant, I asked to see the manager and shared the experience we had w Kelly. He was also happy to hear this. The reason I did this is because we have a tendency to make our bad experiences known but don't share the good ones. I like to share ALL my experiences - good, bad or indifferent - because it helps the establishment and recognizes those who should be.  So...get your grub on!!! Stop by a BJ's - and enjoy!  Share your experience and tip appropriately.  Tell them Chef Will sent you!!"

Jairo V.,"Corona, CA",0,5,,2.0,11/9/2017,"Don't come here when it's packed, love this place when it's not busy. When it is , full is cold and just gets reheated. There spaghetti was cold in the middle and the meatballs were cold also. Sent it backs, the top came out hot and the middle was like warm. Not good at all."
Kathleen A.,"Vista, CA",0,2,,5.0,12/23/2017,Enjoyed lunch with my daughter and granddaughter.  We were in the middle of Christmas shopping.  We had wonderful service and then I paid with my edit card. We left and continued our Christmas shopping but when I went to pay I couldn't find my debit card. I went back to restaurant to see if I left it. It was there!  Thank you for prompt good service and keeping my debit card safe!
Salome R.,"Inglewood, CA",0,2,3,5.0,11/13/2017,"Best experience I have ever had at BJ's.  My server was John F., he was amazing at explaining the different types of dishes. He smiled and listen to what I wanted and went out of his way to make that happen. He is the best server at BJ's and his attention to detail was fantastic."
Juanita H.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,9,4,5.0,12/17/2017,"Excellent choice. Everything we had was amazing, and service was on point. We had chicken, rib-eye and pizzeria. Brussel sprouts were the best I ever had."
Belkis Z.,"Covina, CA",8,3,2,2.0,8/21/2017,"We were quite disappointed yesterday, it took over 25 minutes from the time we ordered our drinks to get our appetizer. When our entrées finally arrived the baked ziti was cold and it came with no bread. An Italian meal with no bread!!! We had to wait an additional 5- 7 minutes for the bread to arrive.  The waitress we had was very nice and apologetic but the kitchen needs help, there is no excuse for a cold meal."
