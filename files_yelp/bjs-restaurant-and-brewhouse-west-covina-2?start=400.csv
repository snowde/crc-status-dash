Gustavo F.,"West Covina, CA",1,15,2,3.0,8/16/2015,"Came in with a party of 10. Food was good, everything except a small detail on one of our plates was cooked as ordered. Our service on the other wasn't as great. Sat for more than 10 mins for refills on 5 of our drinks even though our waiter walked by our table more than once! One of us never got a refill at all. I come often and this is the first time our service has been unsatisfactory, hopefully it will be better next time around..."
Paul K.,"Newport News, VA",94,33,32,3.0,6/7/2014,Not a bad spot to get a quick lunch. Great OG style chicken wings and Salmon dish ain't too bad!
Ashley H.,"La Puente, CA",0,7,,2.0,8/16/2015,"I arrived with a party of 4.. our host, Jacob, was really friendly. He let us know that our waitress would be Ashley.. she seemed a little timid and confused about what she was doing. We asked her for a side of Buffalo sauce, but she forgot to bring it. That's a little disappointing when you're craving that to go along with your sandwich. Also, the Margarita that we ordered was just horrible!! The bartender on the shift must have not been paying attention because it was insanely sour!! Like did he decide to make his own ratio?! It was definitely not appreciated. Also, the California Flatbread we ordered was really burnt. Since when is it okay to serve an almost entirely black Flatbread??? The cooks really should be concerned, not only, with the taste but the presentation as well. I will more than likely not return to this location, I was not satisfied with my experience."
Debbie R.,"Covina, CA",1,16,,4.0,4/26/2016,"Loving the Sweet Sin! If you want a quick seat when it's busy, head straight for the extensive bar seating and grab any open seat. It's rarely full, and no waiting."
AJ J.,"San Jose, CA",7,15,,3.0,2/17/2015,"BJ's has always had okay food and I do come back often. Service is never good though. Especially, at this location."
Eric O.,"Laguna Hills, CA",236,219,53,5.0,1/28/2014,"Everyone deserves a second (and sometimes third) chance, BJ's is no different. If you read my previous review, you know I did not have the best of experiences. But I decided I wanted to go back today for lunch and try it out. As soon as I walked through the door, I was greeted with a cheerful ""Hello, welcome to BJ's"" by a smiling hostess (blonde, long pony-tail). We made small talk for a bit, and I asked if Emy, my amazing server from before, was working - and she was! I said I'd wait however long I needed to for her section, and was told there would be no wait at all. I was handed off to another girl who seats people, and she took me to my table, chatting with me on the way. I passed Emy on the way to my table and she greeted me with a big smile and said, ""Hello Mr. Olsen!"". Ok, now that is service. I was officially impressed. When she came over, she asked me how I was doing, and even remembered my order from last time, down to my drink. Again, clearly impressed. I ordered the lunch BBQ platter (pork slider and bbq chicken with wedge fries), and it was wonderful. Throughout the entire lunch, Emy checked in on me, and even remembered things we had talked about my last time in.  I decided to indulge and have the pizookie (pizza-cookie) - white macadamia nut. So delicious, I can't believe I have never tried this before! I realize I was quite harsh in my last review - and while I feel it was well deserved, I also believe when a company makes a conscientious effort to fix a situation, they deserve to be recognized.  I had a chance to meet with Cynthia, the manager I interacted with last time. We talked, and laughed, and she seemed genuinely interested in my experience at her restaurant today. Will I be back? Absolutely. This was a make-or-break visit, and the staff, service, and food were all wonderful."
Monique W.,"Covina, CA",260,23,1,1.0,5/23/2015,"Had been coming here for years and just had a terrible experience. Ordered my pizza with no sauce and it was brought out TWICE with sauce on it.  I was really patient and nice but at that point just didn't want anything.  I was part of a big party but had to leave to breastfeed my baby and asked for a burger and fries to go.  Manager came by, apologized, and said food was comped for my order. Good thing it was comped because the burger and fries they sent me home with were terrible!!!!! I was also given a gift card and I doubt I will use it at that location.  I felt bad for the server because I could tell he felt terrible that they just couldn't get it right.  It seemed like he was overworked and had too many tables but was honestly working hard and trying his best."
Donald S.,"Glendora, CA",141,357,339,2.0,5/20/2015,"We ordered 4 different kinds of deep dish pizza. Sorry to report that it was the most bland pizza I've ever eaten. I thought that maybe it was just me, but afterward my son made the same comment. Service, Atmosphere and the burger my Mom had were all excellent, but I won't be coming back, at least not for the pizza."
Kathy S.,"Baldwin Park, CA",25,28,1,3.0,11/29/2016,"We have visited this BJ's on several occasions.  We usually get the Clam Chowder and it is wonderful.  This time I ordered the deep dish pizza and a salad wedge.  The pizza was good --- not great but pretty good.  The salad wedge was horrible.  The server saw me picking it apart -- that is because my knife couldn't cut through the lettuce core that had been left in the wedge.  Two thirds of the wedge was inedible - I told the server and she offered to bring another...that what a good server does...however, I declined as I knew the pizza was coming and I didn't want to start over with a new salad...it was ok (it should not have been served in the first place and shame on the chef who let that come out but the server did the right thing all along)  Pizza came and I was happy - I took a picture of the salad to send to a friend (or post on yelp) and it took only a few minutes before a manager was at the table insisting that I take a replacement salad.  He was pushy and insistent even after I told him that I had already worked it out with the server - it was fine and asked him to please just let it go.  So to the point - We are not likely to go back - not because of the salad but because the manager ruined our evening by being pushy and insistent even when we told him we didn't want another salad.  Really, isn't that an awful way to end a special dinner with your lover by arguing with the manager.  And just in case you are wondering, they did not make any adjustment on the bill."
P J.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,61,3,5.0,7/24/2015,BJ's service has been redeemed by Ramon. Thank you for the amazing service and ninja-like skills. Food was good and the Jeremiah Red never disappoints. We will definitely be going back.
Geselle R.,"La Puente, CA",0,35,22,2.0,7/21/2015,There's been a kid running around for the past hour while his parents sit in a booth. Not only is it dangerous and a hazard to the servers it's very annoying and distracting. The food was subpar and the drinks came our warm .
Carolita P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,22,,5.0,8/25/2015,"Been here a few times but my most recent visit was this past Sunday afternoon. I went with my boyfriend and two close friends. Really wish I would've stuck with my gut and had came here for my birthday dinner last Thursday instead.... They never disappoint. This place is so good that you'll even catch their employees staying after their shifts to enjoy a nice meal or a cold drink by the bar. Parking: This location is placed in a shopping center so theres plenty of free parking nearby.  Service: Excellent! Good customer service skills. Their staff is full of young, lively and friendly faces. The waiter that helped us out was very informative about the menu selections and made sure to inform us of their happy hour, specials and new drinks. I know that they are often busy and the waiting line and get really long but on this particular night that we went it was not too busy and we were quickly seated, assisted and served.  Food: Without realizing it we so happened to arrive during one of their Happy Hour sessions (10PM-Closing) which was great! Cheap appetizers and booze, just what we were looking for! We had just gotten back from a long day at the beach so we were hungry! My boyfriend and I got their calamari, artichoke spinach dip, clam chowder soup in the bread bowl, a mini deep dish Mediterranean pizza w/jalapeños and pineapples. The calamari was just what I was expecting (calamari and not fried onions or leftover fried pieces), the dip tasted freshly made (went great with the freshly made tortilla chips), biggest bread bowl of soup i've ever seen (it also stayed hot the whole time we were there) and the mini deep dish pizza was only $6 for unlimited toppings! (smaller than a Little Caesars pizza but totally filling and worth it) Price: Not a cheap place to go to but its not expensive either. Definitely worth the food, service and drinks you receive. Overall we left happy and satisfied, I only regret the food coma we got afterwards...."
Cindy C.,"Fontana, CA",0,16,,5.0,7/17/2015,"The shrimp scampi, roasted salmon, jambalaya & bi special were all delicious. Their peach beer was awesome o did I mention their margarita top shelf was also bomb."
Lila B.,"Diamond Bar, CA",58,94,295,3.0,7/25/2012,"Lunch was good.. I ordered mini pizza & Caesar salad) with a refreshing Strawberry lemonade .. Sooooo good!! It's been crazy hot lately... I needed it.:) Hostess and our waitress were pleasant, the food came out fast, happy with the cheap bill. Lol Definitely can't come without ordering a PIZOOKIE... Chocolate chip!!! Yeeeee"
Sergio C.,"West Covina, CA",101,12,207,5.0,8/19/2015,We go to BJs strictly for the beer!  Great selection of drinks.  Love their blonde beer.
Tinzky H.,"West Covina, CA",1,17,,4.0,2/25/2014,Chicken BarBQ deep dish pizza + Hefe = to die for Came here last Sat night and I was happy that there's enough crowd to have a festiv atmosphere but not too crowded that you have to wait long. Service is also good.
Michelle Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",452,45,16,3.0,2/7/2014,Came cuz I was babysitting a picky friends kid Service was horribly slow Food was cooked ok Kinda wished I went somewhere else The only good thing was the pazookie...but then again who doesn't like a half cooked melted cookie with Ice cream
Veronica H.,"Indio, CA",730,323,57,3.0,10/7/2013,"Went on a Sunday afternoon for some pizza, beer and football. Parking was easy to find, seats in the dining area were readily available (for a party of two). I had the sweet pig pizza with Pineapple, tomatoes and  ham.  The service was fast and friendly but nothing extradoinary."
William B.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",2,30,7,4.0,5/21/2015,"I can only imagine why this spot has such a low average star rating. My review is based mainly just on the food I ordered, because my experience today was a simple Take-out order so I can't really report on the service, other than the food was hot, ready when I arrived and neatly packaged. Seeing as how it was for my birthday I decided to treat myself to a Ribeye dinner to-go.  The steak itself was huge!! And cooked perfectly to my specifications (medium-rare, which in my humble opinion is the ONLY way to get steak, but anyways....). Along with it came my choice of two sides, of which I was given quite a lot of choices. Not just your typical soup or salad. I ended up going with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I purchased an additional side mozzarella and tomato salad. My only complaint would be the asparagus was slightly under cooked which resulted in my pieces being extra chewy. But then again, at this point I'm just being fussy. All in all, I will definitely go back, I'm a big fan of BJ's."
Richard C.,"San Dimas, CA",2,7,1,3.0,2/15/2015,Went to the bar for Sunday brunch. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and my salad was made with wilted old lettuce. Other Than that the sandwich and beers were good.
