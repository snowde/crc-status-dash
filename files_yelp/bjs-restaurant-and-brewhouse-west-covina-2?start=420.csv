Rosie L.,"Ontario, CA",21,5,1,5.0,6/9/2015,"Today we went to celebrate my nieces graduation and I have to say our waitress Charlotte was awesome. She made our experience there amazing, very personable, friendly and attentive.  By far the best visit at any restaurant we have gone to and we were a party of 20 people.. Thank you Charlotte"
R R.,"Walnut, CA",1,36,,3.0,4/27/2016,We have been here a few times and it is usually good. Tonight not so much. My husband ordered a Ceasar salad  soup combo. The salad was drenched in dressing so he told the server who brought out another salad with dressing on the side. But the dressing was Horseradish sauce! The server took it back but my husband did not want a third salad. The mgr did take it off our bill; however he never came to our table. Our server was really nice and attentive.
Steph S.,"La Puente, CA",173,8,33,5.0,5/25/2015,"Haven't been to Bjs in a long time, but so glad I came in. John F. Is by far the most helpful, informative, personable waitor I've ever had. I will definitely be coming back and requesting his service. And this time I know exactly what beer I want."
Michel C.,"Ontario, CA",66,20,2,4.0,10/11/2013,"The food is always really good here and I tend to come here with a group of friends. That being said it can be a bit slow service wise. I went to go put our name in because i was anticipating that there would be a wait by the time my party would all be there. The woman at the front was a bit rude. I told her my party would all be here around 7:30 she kinda snapped ""well there is no waiting for a party of six, so just come up later"" I was like okay. So when most of my part was there we ended up having to wait like an extra 15mins. No big deal really I just felt perhaps she could have responded better. I worked in customer service before so I feel like I have a reasonable standard of how I would like to be treated. tl;dr version the food was great, the service was ok"
Smith J.,"Walnut, CA",0,14,,3.0,9/10/2014,I am in love with this place. Food is amazing. I would eat there every day if it wasn't that expensive lol Service is good too.  It's cool to be inside the restaurant
Brad S.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,252,2,2.0,2/21/2015,"Eeeck-We typically avoid these joints, but after a road trip we figured we'd stop in for a snack and libation. It's 5:30p on a Saturday and this place is packed, so we head to the bar area for a table. Servers we're hard to come by after 10 min, so we grabbed two available seats at the bar. Mistake 1: Mojita made from a mix-very sweet; ugh. Caloric intake on their appetizers; scary. TVs showing the games; makes this place tolerable. Wonder how long places like this will survive."
J W.,"San Bernardino, CA",2,98,59,1.0,3/6/2016,"I am highly disappointed with BJ's today. My food came out cold, and the drinks were weak as hell. Bj's is my favorite but I will not be returning to this one in particular."
Jeff J.,"Pasadena, CA",23,188,33,2.0,4/10/2014,"Typical soul less, flavorless bar food devoid of all taste and imagination.  Just your run of the mill less than mediocre quality burgers and sandwiches.  Don't come here if you're vegetarian or pescatarian.   The few fish options are frozen and served either dry and hard or drowned in sugar sauce. Dragged here by co-worker who's taste and appreciation for food is equally tasteless, even though he flipped the bill, I swore never to return. Btw,  maybe it's just me but places like BJ's, along with fast food-pretend-to-be-real food chains such as applebees always remind me the movie Waiting..."
Dave D.,"Whittier, CA",77,42,11,2.0,2/26/2014,"Came here for dinner.  They were busy,  but I wouldn't say packed.   We were seated fairly quickly.   Once seated,  it was about ten minutes before anyone checked on us to get us started on drinks or appetizers.  By the time our waitress came around,  we already knew what we wanted to order as an appetizer and main entrée.  Our appetizers came out first. No drinks yet.  We then realized we had no utensils or napkins to eat with.    Kind of hard to eat Clam Chowder soup without a spoon.   We alert our waitress and it was another ten minutes before she came back,  with our drinks and utensils.   Our main entrées came out about fifteen minutes later.   Drink refills were non existent.  I only had water too.   My Ahi Tuna salad was a bit dry,  so I asked for more vinaigrette.   What was brought to me was some sort of olive oil mix.   It didn't even taste like the vinaigrette that was on the salad. Needless to say we were done with our meals fairly quick.   We ordered a meal off the kids menu to take home and a dessert.   I joked when we ordered it at the end of our meal that it would take half an hour to get to us.   Sure enough it did.   A manager came and did her rounds.. And if it wasn't for her,  I'm sure our food would of taken longer.  We will probably never use this location again."
Juan L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",41,75,7,5.0,2/22/2015,Went there on a busy Friday night and was seated fairly quickly. Shane our server was attentive and very pleasant. Christian the food runner brought our orders out quickly and kept asking if we needed anything. Employees like them are why we keep coming back.
Kenny H.,"West Covina, CA",31,156,9,3.0,6/28/2013,"Pretty poppin place for a Thur nite Long waits can occur Food is okay Service is a hit or miss Glossy floors are dangerous Large bar area w/ample seating Able to accommodate large groups Many TVs covering sports Good place for a group of sports fans Happy hour has changed to $4, $5, and $6 drinks & apps Happy Hour: 3pm-7pm, after 10pm CAL CLUB FLATBREAD: 3 stars - small quantity with good flavor - HH price $4 SLIDERS & FRIES: 3 stars - good quantity with okay flavor - HH price $5 (w/cheese & bacon extra $1) LETTUCE WRAPS: 1.5 stars - prefer smaller pieces of chicken - disappointing flavor - interesting dipping sauces - HH price $6 SANTA FE ROLLS: 3 stars - solid flavors w/nice dipping sauces - HH price $6 MINI CHICKEN BACON RANCH PIZZA: 1 star - unbalanced rich flavors - HH price $6 MINI BJ'S FAVORITE PIZZA: 3 stars - standard supreme with ok execution - HH price $6 MINI MEDITERRANEAN PIZZA: 3.5 stars - good for veggie lovers; not vegetarians - HH price $6 MINI BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA: 4 stars - best pizza on the menu - HH price $6"
John N.,"La Verne, CA",3,112,4,2.0,4/1/2015,Went for lunch with the family. Food is just generic at best. It's the typical chain restaurant turn Em and churn em philosophy. Had the salmon it was very dry. Wife had a burned mini pizza. I can see why this place has such a low star rating.
Carlos M.,"La Puente, CA",0,21,4,1.0,10/6/2014,"Took family to eat lunch,  ordered a beer ( hef ) when the waitress brought it to me there was no lemon wedge so I tried to get her attention but failed so I stood up and walked up to her and asked her for a lemon wedge her reply was she is very busy it's going to be a few minutes,so I told her I would go to the bar and get it myself she said no you can't I'll get it for you after a few minutes my lemon wedges came and a few minutes later the manager came I believe her name was Cynthia she asked how everything was and I told her the situation she was very polite and said she would take care of everything well she did she helped out for a while and then brought us a new waitress but after all this I don't think I would eat at BJ's again"
Steve S.,"Duarte, CA",42,3,,1.0,7/22/2015,If I could give this establishment zero stars I would. Do not ever order a keg from this Bj's.  Their management is the most incompetent I think I have ever run across in terms of keeping a keg inventory.  1) When I picked up the keg they had no tap for it. 2) The beer tasted horrible and was delivered luke warm 3) It poured foamy 4) When I returned the keg they even botched that. Besides the kegs the service at this BJ's is subpar. Slow and unattentive. You FAILED Bj's West Covina. Learn something from the Monrovia location which is much better
Adel D.,"Duarte, CA",50,43,55,5.0,10/19/2014,"First time at this BJ's and Justin our waiter was amazing ! I have been doing customer service for almost 10yrs and if I owned a business I would want him working for me ! Great customer service is the key to an establishment and he makes you want to come back for more. Working in the bar seating area gets pretty packed anywhere on a Sunday during a football game, so it takes a special person to be able to be attentive , accurate & kind and he hit all three thank you Justin for all your hard work  !"
Frankie M.,"Covina, CA",0,7,4,3.0,7/18/2015,The back messed up our order and hour later the manager comes out and offers us soup and then that took another twenty mangers did not impress me but the waitress Denise made the unpleasant experience better she was very nice and super persistent to the managers that we need our food by now so she is the reason I'd come back
Theresa M.,"El Monte, CA",22,25,8,5.0,9/11/2013,"Great 2 for 20 deal here. My friend and I each got a salad (good portion), split a medium pizza and shared a pazookie!! Top it off service was excellent, our waitress was friendly and checked up in us at Keats twice. Breakdown: Cob salad Caesar salad Split medium - artichoke and spinach pizza and vegetarian pizza Chocolate chip pazookie We each paid under 11 dollars. Great company, good food and great service!!! Next visit ill try their beers..."
Jagoda K.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",34,65,41,5.0,2/4/2014,"Delicious food and great beer selection! This is a perfect place for get together! Their appetizers rock, and can really fill you up!  Prices are very very reasonable and the stuff is always smiling and makes sure you are happy with their service!"
Karissa P.,"Ontario, CA",286,15,13,2.0,9/14/2015,came here at 2:50 just in time for happy hour that started at 3. when our server came to our table we told her we wanted to order appetizers off happy hour. so we put in our entrees expecting her to come back to get or appetizers so we could get happy hour prices. our food comes out before she even came back to get our appetizer order. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich with the pesto on the side. there was pesto on the sandwich and pesto on the side. the fries were cold. and the bread was rock hard. the server brought me a fresh one after though so we left content.
Belle B.,"Walnut, CA",155,914,12842,1.0,4/10/2011,"I don't know what it is.  I ate here once and got really sick.  I had a salad and pizza.  It just turned my tummy.  I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I tried it a second time.  I got sick the second time as well.  Believe me, I will not be coming back here to try it a third time."
