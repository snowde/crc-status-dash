Kevin J.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,43,12,4.0,2/18/2015,"This place is known for their brews, they create there own beers and encourage you to have there. Which are really good, the stouts are pretty good and are worth the happy hour price which is $4. For a good beer at a reasonable price try BJ. Not sure what to try....They also have a beer sampler. Go for it!"
Shevonne P.,"Glendora, CA",76,6,,1.0,11/16/2015,"Normally me and my family don't have problems. But tonight for my birthday. The service was terrible.  The waiter left never came back. His back up came explained he went on lunch. But he never told us. And didn't finish giving us our orders. On top of it all. I am not the one to go around saying people are bad people, or people go around stealing. But i did happen to leave my birthday card on the table where we eating. It even had money in it. Now they saying it isn't there that no one seen it. How so you miss a white envelope?? On a dark table?? Just saying. I am not going back any time soon after how the service was.... sorry. And the possibility of being lied to doesn't set well with me."
Haykitty V.,"West Covina, CA",1,2,1,2.0,7/3/2014,We had horrible service Plus I had top sirloin was way over cooked and their salad was bad so I ordered soup instead and they charge me for both and their mashed potatoes were extra Dry the lemonade is extra sour the only good thing was the manager was trying to help us the manager was really nice everything else sucked ni got a pizookie to go and it was horrible and burnt and look like it was just throw on the plate
Genius G.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,115,140,5.0,2/17/2015,"Ive been to this BJ's like 37 times now and never posted a review untill now. 1 reason only, my waitress this last time was the best. I got her name from the receipt (Susan H.) She was funny, nice, helpful, went out of her way for us, and my 6 year old daughter loved her. She was so patient while my daughter ordered her meal, well it took like 2 minutes to tell the waitress what she wanted. The food is always good here, thats why I spend all my money here on dinner and drinks, well I dont cook either so maybe thats why Im here so much. So in my opinion, Susan H. deserves a raise, or make her a manager or something because my little girl said so."
Fouad M.,"San Diego, CA",13,228,3,4.0,1/22/2015,"Went there recently and were quickly seated. The customer service was great and so was the atmosphere. There was not long wait time. I ordered Lemon Thyme Chicken which was just average. However, overall experience was good."
Danielle D.,"Moreno Valley, CA",5,5,7,2.0,3/31/2014,"Stopped in with a party of 4, which included a toddler and a 7 year old. The high chair was missing a clasp for the safety strap, so I asked for a replacement. The 2nd chair was even worse, missing  clasp and an essential part which would have kept him from slipping out the front. I explained the problem to the waiter, after which we finally got a high chair with all parts accounted for.  We got all our drinks quickly, except the toddler. Somehow, he was overlooked.  Also the pizza for the 7 year old arrived about 15 minutes ahead of anyone else's meal. Luckily I had some crackers to occupy my toddler, otherwise we probably would have had to leave.  I will add that all food and drink drop-off were done by other servers, not our initial waiter.  The food was pretty good, but the uneven timing of the meal as well as other mishaps ruined the meal for us. I'll probably eat at BJs again, just not this one."
Elie M.,"Covina, CA",3,18,12,1.0,3/2/2014,"We just had a bad experience it wasn't so much the food but the service, it took for ever to get the meal after we complained twice about the time it took to get it. To make matters worse it took them a while to get our desert  as well, even though you will think they would at least get that to us in a timely manner. Very disappointed. Recommendation to the management: Your servers should be aware of their table better- they should able to tell that the food is delayed and fix the problem before it arouses- a manager should be walking between tables and checking if everything is on time- something acknowledging customer helps and prevent mistakes to happen and most important is a smile. Trust me it doesn't matter how busy is this place one day It will be empty if they keep going this way."
Noelle R.,"West Covina, CA",59,3,5,1.0,8/17/2014,"I'm a regular at this BJ's whether it's a craving for pizookies or for their mojitos. sat in the bar area with a group. waitress didn't take our order until about 15-20 minutes after we sat down. food and drinks came out reasonable times. but when we wanted to order more it took us about 20-25 minutes to catch someone's attention and the waitress didn't even tell my group she was going on break or leaving for the night. and then once our pizookie came out, it was way overcooked, tasted and smelt burnt. once it came out again it was fine. but it's the worst service I've ever had at this location."
Kevin J.,"Pomona, CA",2,8,,3.0,4/28/2015,"I was a little disappointed we got a flat bread pizza, cantina chicken.  We thought it was an appetizer since it was small.  Also they were cheap on the toppings.  I think the whole pizza had five pieces of chicken."
Grace C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",332,466,19,4.0,6/10/2013,Good place for beer and sports. I happened to be in town when Kings were playing their disappointing loss against CHI town few days ago. Sigh~ They have pretty good selection of beers on tap and in bottles. Can't complain.  If you are hungry~ pair it with one of the signature pizza.
Ann R.,"Poway, CA",4,19,22,3.0,10/4/2014,Shout out to Curtis at the West Covina BJ's. A most entertaining staff member. Saves the night. Seated quickly thanks to the app. But service was pretty slow due to our poor waitress being given tables all across the restaurant. Food was Luke warm upon arrival and getting a refill on coffee was a challenge. Cynthia the manager and Ryan our waitress tried to remake our food which we totally appreciated. This BJs is extremely busy all the time but I would think and few tweaks in scheduling might make it better.
Anna C.,"La Habra, CA",55,19,2,5.0,12/30/2014,"Took my nieces for a quick bite and was served by our favorite waitress,  Emy. She is so knowledgeable about the menu and recommended a couple of things for the kids.  We placed their order first and everything came out quickly. Food was great, but the service was better. Emy is so amazing. My youngest was cranky and wanted to get up. So Emy danced her around a bit, total life saver. Emy was attentive, patient, and proactive. I never had to ask for anything. Quick refills, ketchup bought with the food, and an endless supply of smiles. I highly recommend sitting in Emy's section when at this location."
Jenevieve L.,"Diamond Bar, CA",29,33,122,1.0,1/20/2015,"Definitely not impressed with the service I received tonight.  My brother suggested we go to Chili's after our Target run to get their cookie dessert when I told him ""oh no I'll take you to BJ's so you can try their pizookies!""  We arrived about an hour before closing only to find an empty host/hostess stand. We stood there for about 5 minutes looking around for someone to help us making eye contact multiple times with a man sitting at one of the tables in the bar who later turned out the be a host. He left the table, approached us and told us to take a seat anywhere in the bar, and went back to his table. No welcome or any sign of being a host. So we pick a table near other people so we would be noticed right away. Another 10 minutes pass and we're sitting at our table waiting for someone to check on us for drinks and to give us menus. We were almost on the verge on leaving until a blonde waitress who had seen us sitting at our table every time she came to check on her customers finally approached us and said oh someone will get you some menus. -________- I don't know if it's this location in general has bad service or if it's the closing shift people that aren't very attentive. But I definitely won't be going to this location for late night pizookies."
Albert S.,"Montclair, CA",41,39,1,3.0,6/19/2013,*hit or miss service (depending on which server you get) *Big parking lot *inexpensive Lunch menu *good caprese salad *Watermelon and feta salad is really refreshing  *Tortilla soup is really tasty and has a bit of a tang *Awful chili (they just taste like beer) Would go again for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special
Jason Z.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/20/2016,"I don't know where to begin, but here we go: we had a party of 25 and we got there it was just 6 regular tables apart from each other... Wtf, we are trying to go out as a family and celebrate a 40th bday party. It's not that often we can get together as a family like that, and we were at separate tables! Service wasn't good at all... There was beer spilled on my girls purse. I get mistakes are made, but come on. And my dinner which was a Ahi Tuna salad, was more of a side salad! It was tiny! If your establishment can't handle parties that big, maybe don't reserve them...and if your going to book those big parties... Do better! Once again how can I give less then one star. P.S. I'm not a restaurant basher, but this wasn't an enjoyable experience."
Sedine S.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,726,26,3.0,9/15/2011,"Came here for Happy Hour.  It can get super packed, so keep that in mind if you want to do Happy Hour.  Also because it was opening night for the NFL so all the TV's had that going. Good beers, which are a dollar off during their Happy Hour.  Their appetizers are also a dollar or two off, which is always good. Other than that, it's BJ's.  It's nothing fancy.  A place to get together with a group and whatnot."
Jen C.,"Covina, CA",0,22,4,1.0,2/28/2015,Had lunch here today and it was bad :( the menus were sticky and dirty ! Then my dad's mug that his rootbeer came in was filthy and had dried up crud on the side. The manager came over and she did was say sorry il have someone clean better next time. Smh I won't be back to this bjs for awhile
Heidi W.,"Covina, CA",0,8,,1.0,3/15/2016,"Worst dinner ever!! Ordered the top sirloin, baked potato and salad. Salad came with no dressing, steak was cold and potato not cooked. The pepsi was flat too! After one bite of each, the server asked how my food was and I said sorry I don't like any of it please bring me the check, I will pay for what I ate and drank and I won't be back! He got the manager I explained my dissatisfaction and she offered to excuse my check and I said no, I am going to at least pay for my drinks I do not want something for nothing but I won't be back. I'm not sure if they are cutting down in serving staff or what but I waited an hour for cold crappy food. I don't mind paying for good quality but I wouldn't give that to my dogs. I advised the manager I am now going to McDonald's! At least the food is hot!! Sad thing it wasn't the first time! I keep saying I will give them another chance but that is strike three!!! Too bad there are no 0 stars!"
Roger R.,"Los Angeles, CA",24,13,102,1.0,1/3/2015,I been to several BJ's before but this one is the worst. Slow service I believe we waited more than 10 to 15 minutes before someone came to ask us if we wanted order drinks. When they came we decided to order right away cause we didn't wanna wait another 15 minutes for them to take our order. When the food came my pizza was dry and burnt I threw half it away. I think I would have gotten a better pizza at Little Caesar for a quarter of the price I paid here. I'm never coming back to this BJ's.
Wendy T.,"Baldwin Park, CA",28,151,37,4.0,10/5/2013,"Good food, good drinks. Service is okay. Nice spot for happy hour :) Pizookies are highly recommended!"
