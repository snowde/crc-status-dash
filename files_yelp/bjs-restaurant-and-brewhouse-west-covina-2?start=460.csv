Don L.,"West Covina, CA",146,16,8,5.0,6/13/2014,"Last night I again stopped by this BJ's Restaurant for a light meal and a beer. As I was chatting with several friends there, I realized (to my HORROR!) that I had committed a cardinal sin in my last review.  I FORGOT to include Ivanna as one of the special bartenders/servers/jill-of-all-trades who always treats me kindly and with great warmth and professionalism.  I apologize for my mental lapse, and I encourage everyone who visit this restaurant/bar to recognize and praise Ivanna for her wonderful service and heart.  Others I may have forgotten to mention last time are Roger, Shea (Shay?), Matt, Ashley, Melissa, Cynthia, Tiffany, and a bunch of bartenders/servers who doubtlessly will nail me the next time I visit for not including them in this list.  Everyone  --- including management --- is very nice.  Just come here and enjoy yourself! :--)"
Sue T.,"West Covina, CA",0,13,,2.0,9/20/2015,Smells funky inside needs a renovation to remove that musty smell!  Food is good as usual but can't stand the smell and guests as well.  We had reception yesterday there  after our grandchild's baptism.
Tina V.,"City of Industry, CA",314,454,653,4.0,8/3/2011,"I actually like this location better than the Rowland height's location.  It is good place to come and hang with friends, grab a bite to eat, or drink with new menu items (alcohol or food) almost each time i come. Last night the bf and i came here for dinner and actually enjoyed our time and dinner.  The waitress we had was so attentive and she chatted us up a few times but not too much. Surprisingly for a chain, we agree that was the best service we ever had there.   Appetizer:    +Stuff spinach and cheese mushrooms (3.5/5) It was good but kind of heavy on the cheese and not as fresh as i would like +Seared Ahi tuna (4/5) My bf loves it here, i had it in the RH location and hated it, mainly since i don't eat raw fish.  But it wasn't bad here, it was quite fresh. +Clam Chowder Bread bowl (2.5/5) I love clam chowder and the sourdough bread at BJs. But the soup was kind of salty and  become saltier the more you ate it for some reason. +Salads (Cesar and ranch) (2/5) Just didn't care for it.  The two stars is the vegetables were fresh.  Drinks: +BF: 8 taster set (light to dark beer) (5/5) Bf loved it, i don't drink beer so i don't know.  But he liked how he can try all beer instead of just getting his usual porter.  he hated the tonkanka or something like that. +Me: limited time Peach margarita (4/5) it was strong but not bitter and really good.  Too bad its not a regular menu item.  One cup got me kind of buzz for just a margarita.    Entree: + Bf: Full rack of ribs: (4.5/5) The meat was tender and fell off the bone but not as tender as we would like and slightly dry.  It was still good, the bf almost murder the whole thing and hes a small guy. +Me: Grilled Fresh Atlantic Salmon   (4/5) really heavy but good. We have ordered it before but blacken and i did not like it as much.  The grilled version give it more tender favor and the salon flaked nicely without being dry.  I didn't care for the veggie (no favor) or the rice (pure butter). Dessert: +Chocolate chip Pizookie (4/5) bottom line... you cant go wrong with their pizookie.  It is what they are known for.  yum.  Overall (4/5) rating.   The Service was really impeccable thanks to our waitress, too bad i didn't get her name.  Hopefully we get her again next time. The food was good last night with a few dislikes (why i minus 1 star) End of the night we went home with a growler of their porter beer as the bf love their brew beer."
Judy R.,"Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2016,"Service was terrible, server had nasty attitude. We called to make a compliant to manager. He assured me that this not tolerated in his Resturant. But I don't believe this statement."
Azalia A.,"El Monte, CA",18,22,16,3.0,7/13/2014,I always come here a lot but yesterday the service was horrible it took us forever to get our drinks. Food was delicious but that pretty much was it. Hopefully next time service will be better.
Nicky R.,"La Verne, CA",94,231,385,1.0,10/25/2014,"I went here Saturday for dinner. It was busy and a little hard to find parking. Wait line was surprisingly not long despite for the place being packed. We ordered the avacado egg rolls for the appetizer and I ordered their mini cheese & tomato deep dish for my main meal. First, our appetizer came out with our meal. Second, they didn't bring us mini plates for the appetizer. Do they expect me to push my pizza on the side or something? There wasn't room! Third, my pizza barely had any sauce. I basically paid for cheese bread. I thought it was suppose to be a pizza? And fourth, my so called pizza or cheese bread was cold. It definitely wasn't worth the money. So disappointed. Waste of money."
Joanne O.,"San Diego, CA",38,3,4,1.0,1/2/2015,"I have been to BJs before but this particular one I got horrible service. I was with a group of 6 people and we all agreed it was terrible.  First of all, our waiter, was not welcoming, and I don't think I ever saw a smile on his face. Our drinks came after about 10 min and then we waited a little while longer to order our food. It took about 40 minutes for our food to arrive. During that time, he never came by to check on us, or refill our drinks. We were sitting at the booth with empty glasses for a good 10 minutes. Finally we started to get our food, and I realized that they got my order wrong, so I had to wait an extra 15 minutes for my food. Nobody asked is if we needed anything and so we kept trying to get someone's attention for water, condiments, etc.  Overall, it was just an unpleasant experience."
Christina C.,"Glendora, CA",97,73,49,4.0,10/25/2014,"Came here for lunch, which they do have great lunch specials, and i got the Chicken fettuccine pasta. I swear this pasta is so good!!!"
Greg A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,10,,5.0,2/3/2016,Really like this Bj's it's super clean and they are very helpful with seating and helping you to be comfortable. Food is great never had an issue :))) 5 STARS
Diana E.,"Covina, CA",0,53,,5.0,4/17/2015,"Great lunch today! Tavern pizza, avocado egg rolls and scampi pasta!!! Service was spot on!! The pizza was super good.....avocado egg rolls with the sweet/sour sauce was really really yummy! The scampi pasta was just amazingly good!!! Delicate flavors and cooked just right...sooo yummy! Great service!!"
Ashley S.,"Los Angeles, CA",79,156,32,4.0,12/11/2012,"This BJ's is located within a center of restaurants and is almost always busy. Last time I went, I had to wait for 25 minutes, which has not happened in a while. I have had great service, but I have also had slower service. The last time I went, I felt overlooked because there were a couple of parties of about 8 or so. However, the food is always good, as are their pizookies. The red velvet one is my favorite! This is a place you can either come dressed up or stay casual. There are a lot of college students who get dressed up and go to BJ's, but then there are a lot of people who don't dress up. If you are looking for a fun place, I would give this a try. If there's a wait, it will usually go by fairly quickly. I've learned the faster you make up your mind here, the better the service you get. And when you need to pay, they are usually very good at splitting checks."
Robert H.,"La Puente, CA",0,29,8,5.0,4/11/2015,"Great service and food! I love the pizza here, never fails to satisfy me! If your looking for some good pizza and a nice evening for sports come here! Tvs that can be seen from where ever your sitting."
Jocelyn K.,"La Verne, CA",0,20,4,4.0,9/16/2014,"I love the great white pizza its my favorite. I came in on a weekday during lunch and the manager was very rude. She accidentally gave me the wrong drink and when I politely let her know she was extremely rude and said ""No your drink is correct"" when I replied with ""No it's not I ordered a Dr.Pepper"" she rolled her eyes and said okay. She then came back 10 minutes later and told my waitress ""She keeps saying her drink is wrong when it's right"". I'm not sure what her issue was or if she was having a bad day but that's the only bad experience I've had there."
Samantha L.,"San Francisco, CA",676,953,2057,3.0,10/4/2010,"One of the few chains I really enjoy and will chose to go to specifically. Their lunch specials are the BEST. Go Monday through Friday and spend less than $10 on a lunch sized portion meal. Their deep dish pizzas are especially great and a mini is the perfect size for most. They seemed to have added more seating at this location. Lunch time on a Sunday afternoon wasn't too busy - a lot of tables were taken but we were seated right away. Love their ""Small Bites"" section on their menu! Smaller portions than their appetizers but just enough if you're just in the mood to nibble on something else. I tried their bruschetta today.. came with 4 slightly larger than bite sized slices of buttery tasting bread with tomatoes and a light pesto sauce on the side. It was good! The soups only come in Large size or in a bread bowl. I opted for just the typical large bowl of chili and found it to be a lot smaller than i was hoping. Even so, they put some sour cream and cheese in it, and that was probably as much as I should have been eating anyways.  PIZOOKIES! A white chocolate chunk macadamia pizookie with vanilla ice cream is still my favorite. A regular is large enough to split between 2-3 people. It's sweet, baked fresh out of the oven, and too good."
Ryan K.,"Redondo Beach, CA",46,4,,4.0,7/26/2014,First time here. Went for lunch and ordered the flat bread appetizers which were amazing. I wasn't as impressed with my main meal though. A Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich. Was good but not something I'd order again. Finally finished with the salted caramel pizookie. A delicious sweet and salty treat. I preferred it without the dark chocolate since it overpowers the other flavors but it's easy to just remove it. Overall friendly attentive staff and wide variety of food. Would come back again
Carlos D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,5.0,1/9/2016,"First time to this restaurant,  I was expecting so so quality, but what a surprise, the waiting for a table was worth the service and food, I was expecting the dump down the road quality ""lazy dog"" restaurant in particular the quality of food , what a difference, I will definitely be back!"
Leena B.,"Oakland, CA",489,284,74,3.0,6/5/2013,"I don't want to start off this review by saying ""I like BJs"" because that has waaaay too many unnecessary connotations. So I will say that I really enjoy this brewhouse. They have a great selection of beers on tap and my two favorites are the blonde and heff. This is a great spot for happy hour. I order the spinach and artichoke dip, chicken potstickers, lettuce wraps, ahi tuna, stuffed mushrooms, and fried artichokes. Wow...I come here A LOT! Sometimes, the service is a bit slow, but the food is great. My favorite pizza is the spinach and artichoke pizza with the full crust (not thin crust). I'm no vegetarian, but I sure do love this pizza! It melts in your mouth! And I thought only M&Ms did that... Lastly, try and save room for a delicious white chocolate pizookie. I'm always in a group where they look at me all crazy when I want to order one. I mean yes, we just stuffed ourselves with appetizers, pizza, and beer...but it's so worth it!  So when I compare BJs to TGI Fridays, Chili's, or any of those other fam bam restaurants, BJs is my favorite spot! AND the bar area is far far away from any crying children... ;)"
Melissa C.,"Covina, CA",81,113,57,1.0,10/24/2014,"Very God Place To Eat. My Boyfriend Took Me On A Special Date Here, Loved The Food, But The GIRLS Are Very Slutty. One Of The Girls Was All Lovey-Dovey With My Date. I Felt Like She Disrespected Me, She Came At Least 30 Times To See If Everything Was Okay Or If He Needed Anything. She Never Did Eye Contact With Me Only Him. And She Also Had The Nerve To Write A Heart On The Receipt. Usually People Draw A Happy Face Or Write Thank You, But No She Drew A Heart On The Receipt. This Will Not Stop Me For Coming Here Because The Food Was Good, Just The Staff Members Suck. Management, Please Have A Talk With All Your Staff Members."
Nila P.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,8,1,1.0,2/7/2015,"The service was bad! The waitress got our orders WRONG, and the food was SO DRY!! Girl, what was supposed to be a happy time to celebrate, was a time to bite our tongues (so they won't spit on our food) and wait, wait, and wait!"
Rob P.,"El Monte, CA",0,4,3,2.0,2/5/2015,Went there during the week around 3:30pm . The place was very slow so we figured we'd get fast service. Wrong!! Waited 20min for drinks. When the food came out they brought 1 plate . 10 min later the rest of the food came out...Its a SHAME to experience bad service when you go out to eat. I'm all for eating out and giving a good tip . But when the service sucks it's just too bad...
