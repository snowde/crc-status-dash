Leslie M.,"Azusa, CA",101,6,,5.0,6/27/2014,"5 stars!!! We have came here since it opened and after having a bad service we stayed away. However, manager Patrick write us a sincere apology and we came back today. The General Manager, Will, came up to us and was extremely kind and helpful. Thank you Will and Patrick for making our service great!"
Brett R.,"Victorville, CA",1199,703,19,5.0,1/26/2013,"BJ's is just awesome. The food is so good and the atmosphere is so warm that it doesn't matter if the service is slacking. When we were here, i think the server got loaded with a few tables, but it wasn't the end of the world, because EVERYthing is good here. Always love getting a BJ's."
Valerie S.,"Ontario, CA",3,52,6,1.0,10/18/2014,"Let me sum up my dreadful ""weekend brunch"" experience: over medium eggs were completely hard/well done, bacon tasted old and hard to eat, potatoes were dry and spongey, the waiter forgot my tea, water was not refilled, my honey's gravy was cold."
Lisett R.,"Covina, CA",160,18,5,2.0,11/25/2014,"I usually love bjs but service is getting worse every time I come ... Not once did the server come and ask if anything else was needed nor check on us. We had to ask a different server for another round , the food I got wasn't what I ordered and the second time around wasn't right either ... Just a bad experience in itself not to mention we were celebrating a birthday so just bad! All around !"
Harikrishna M.,"Arcadia, CA",2,13,,3.0,11/22/2015,Very poor service..food delivered first and water and plates were given after 10 mins..wrong bill given to me..very late in responding..no apologies.. No more coming here...!!!
Rick S.,"Upland, CA",15,75,4,5.0,9/18/2013,"I was a little leery of going here with a friend last night after my horrible experience with BJ's in Montebello (see review). Much to my surprise and delight, however, the food, ambiance (that's French, you know) and service were all ... perfect! My friend had the Thai Salmon; I had the Tuscan Chicken Limone -- both phenomenally delicious. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Well done, BJ's! You have fully redeemed yourself in my book (up from your previous 1 star)."
Pete M.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,35,,3.0,3/1/2015,"A good friend and I were here on Friday, February 27. I was expecting a typically noisy Friday at a place that is one of those ""crowd pleasing""  establishments. We all know them, a place that is very loud, with boisterous people, and all that stuff for places of this type.  This past Friday, in the early evening,  a friend of mine and I went in and were seated in a nice booth. We waited for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes for someone to wait on us.  Eventually, a nice  young woman named ""Charlotte R."" came to us and asked if we had been seen.  Charlotte wasn't our ""official"" server, but she apologized for our extended wait and brought our drinks and dinner. She was friendly, and we we had some laughs while she was at our table. Charlotte R came around often (but not too often) to ask who how things were going.  I had the Jambalaya which was very, very good. My friend  had a steak, baked potato, and so on. We agreed that  the price for appetizers, drinks(2 each) and dinners for $86.00 plus tip was good.  To conclude, Charlotte R is a great server, and I wish her well.  Ask for her; you won't regret it."
Jamie T.,"West Covina, CA",73,48,18,2.0,9/22/2014,I've been here before but never wrote a review until now. I never have a problem with the food or service but tonight was all bad. I went for my friends bday and yes we had a table that had 12 people but it wasn't that busy. The server ignored me twice! Once was to order my drink! Another was to order my meal! He completely skipped twice over me! That's not cool. I finally got my drink which looked to me that someone took a drink already I just laughed it off making a silly joke about it! When I got my order (touscan chicken limone) the pasta tasted very bland and over cooked! The chicken looked like if was cooked in the microwave! I wasn't satisfied at all.
Marvin M.,"Montclair, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/8/2016,So me and my girlfriend decided to come here to this specific location for our anni. We asked to be seated in a booth. We waited over 15 minutes for someone to come and ask for just our drinks. The waiter approached and said oh I am sorry I didn't see you there. We didn't say anything because I am just not one to complain. We asked for our drinks a water with lemon and a Pepsi. 1) the Pepsi was flat and for some odd reason warm. 2) they didn't bring us our lemons AT ALL!!. Right when we got our drinks we ordered our food. In the section we were sitting at maybe 20 minutes into us being there they filled 2-3 more tables around us. 40 minutes after ordering our food we still hadn't received anything. It was not busy for them to make us wait that long. We than noticed that the 3 other tables that were seated 20 minutes after us were getting there food. Oh I was lit after that. The busboy was cleaning tables asked if we were ok and we explained our situation he told his manager and she came and brought us our food. I am not sure if the manager told our waiter anything but after that the waiter was filled with attitude towards us. She checked on everyone else but us we had to call her 2-3 times to bring us more napkins and more soda. She rolled her eyes at us and on top of that she had charged me for fries that I didn't order. I payed over $30 dollars for a meal that I didn't even enjoy. I told my company that is about 5 minutes from there to change there place for lunch. Because that experience was not one I would recommend someone to go to.
Alex N.,"San Dimas, CA",0,11,3,2.0,7/11/2014,"30 minute wait to sit (normal).... 20 mins for waiter to greet us at table.... Never came to ask us if we needed anything. Everyone around looks super moody due to lack of service and waiting longer than normal. Was asked if we wanted desert, we said yes and they never came back lol"
Mark C.,"Azusa, CA",2,2,,4.0,12/26/2014,"It's my favorite sit down chain restaurant for a reason. Avocado rolls are a must, chicken parmesan is an enjoyable dish that is worthwhile."
Chris T.,"Sunnyvale, CA",15,53,,1.0,6/20/2014,"Called ahead in advance for a table. We were told they couldn't make reservations but would put us on the list and it would most likely be a 25-30 minute wait. After getting there, we waited for an hour, being told multiple times that it would be a 10 minute wait, then a 15 minute wait, and finally the manager Patrick said he couldn't do anything except split our table up or wait. I understand places being busy, but being under quoted multiple times was infuriating and unacceptable. Hope they are able to figure something out, I've seen other BJ's at least bring out slices while people were waiting."
Jimmy K.,"Montclair, CA",29,6,,1.0,2/7/2015,Came here for my girlfriends little brothers birthday. Worst experience of my life. Got seated at 8:20. Waited about 15. No waiter shows up I ask a waiter that was helping another table who was our waiter and we find out there wasn't a waiter or waitress assigned to our table. She was kind enough to take our order and she was already about to go home. Her boss said she couldn't help out our table so she just put the order in and we were sitting waiting for our drinks it took 30 minutes just to get our drinks. Never again am I coming to this Bj location.
Isaiah B.,"Duarte, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/1/2016,the homie steven p was an absolute g. he had great service and was very kind and friendly. really praise him as a waiter and a person. had a great time at bj's.
Jeanette S.,"Los Angeles, CA",714,204,559,4.0,6/6/2010,"I came with a friend to enjoy some good food and drinks and luckily there was not a Laker game or we would've NEVER been seated and Laker fans typically ruin my appetite anyways, hahaha.  There was a Dodger game, but still it wasn't too packed. We were seated right away and all of our food and drinks came out pretty quickly. I ordered a Strawberry Margarita and my friend ordered a Pomegranate Margarita, which were both very yummy.  We ordered some Spinach dip to start off with, which was totally delicious and addicting, lol. I didn't want to eat that much of it so I wouldn't get full, but it was so good I couldn't help it and we kept eating it. For my meal I ordered a Turkey burger with fries, which turned out to be much bigger than I had imagined. Good Turkey burgers are hard to come by, and this one was super good, just really huge!  My fries were also very good, but yea so much food I took a lot of that home.  I've had some other not so great experiences at BJ's, but this one was for sure one of the better ones. Good and quick service and good food earned them 4 stars this time. They are a little pricey, for what it is but still I like this one and would for sure come back."
Tayler K.,"Covina, CA",0,11,1,3.0,1/28/2015,"The service at his location is not as good as the other locations. The wait here is also longer at this one. Compairing to Cerritos, Brea, and Punte Hills, the amosphere and food taste  is similar, but it beats he a Downey location....any place beats the Downey location. Im giving 3 stars because I ordered and Orange juice and they filled it with Ice. That means I really only got half a glass with the ice taking the other half. I wouldnt mind if they allow refills but they dont."
June M.,"West Covina, CA",0,10,,4.0,6/5/2014,"Place is good.  If you plan on going at dinner time especially on game day, Friday/Saturday, or holidays, good luck.  Expect to wait forever. I usually like coming here with my mom for lunch.  Show up between 11-12, you should have no problem getting a table for 2-4.  Any larger party, I would recommend calling ahead.  Its not the fastest service, but not the slowest service.  If you only have an hour, it might make you stress out a bit.  If you have a rewards card, show it when you walk in, and then show it again when you order to your server.  I only found out recently that you get additional points for the actual order as well as your visit.  Beer selection is good, their lunch menu is nice and surprisingly not expensive.   If you want to do a take-out, their service is really efficient.  I've used that feature a few times, and the food is ready at the time they say it will be, and pick-up is relatively quick.  They keep the food in the warmer next to the counter where you pick up gift cards so you can be in and out."
Stephanie B.,"Glendora, CA",0,6,,5.0,2/24/2015,"My husband and I lOVE BJ's Restaurant! :) We love their Pizza's so much! They are so     thick, fluffy, tasty, and filling! :) My husband loves to warm up his pizza leftovers the next morning for breakfast  and he says it is just as good as the day he had it! I love to eat my pizza cold ^_^ yummy Oh, and their chocolate chip pizookie are AMAZING! :)"
Darla D.,"San Dimas, CA",166,885,685,4.0,8/22/2014,This is a nice big location. The bar area was quite large. Food and service was great. The only complaint I have is that it was exceptionally loud the evening I was there. I literally had to yell at the person I was with across the table to talk ...
Nick W.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,142,48,4.0,4/3/2013,"Met some friends for late dinner, was not disappointed. My friend had priorly described the place as a higher quality Applebees, which I think was fair. Has more of a bigger sports bar vibe, with a more extensive menu and awesome beer selection. Hadn't eaten all day prior, so I was ready to demolish some food by the time we ordered. I got the jalapeño burger which was absolutely delicious.  They had a gluten free menu for the flatmate to delve into. Always a plus when he can eat normal meals with the rest of civilization.  Now... the best part: the pizookies. I've frequently heard of these magical mystical dishes ever since my arrival in Cali 3 months ago, but haven't had the honor of trying one before this night. Now I shall actively seek them out. BJ's had a great variety of them, which was daunting but exciting. Get a few different ones for the table, you won't be disappointed... however the gluten free flatmate might be, since they aren't GFree. Oh twells."
