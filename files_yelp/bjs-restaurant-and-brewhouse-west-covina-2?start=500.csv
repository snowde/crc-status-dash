Anthony B.,"Riverside, CA",513,690,483,2.0,5/7/2012,"Seriously not impressed. It started out well and ended horribly. Point blank, the service was shit. The place was only 60% filled. Our server rarely came by to check on our refills. Now when I say came by, I mean walked past us and went about his business at other tables. This happened repeatedly through the night. We were given a break from this asshatery when he went on break (please don't ever come back). The replacement waiter is the only thing that saved this review from a straight up 1 star. There was no excuse to ignore our table, that was obviously needing refills. In turn this affected our thoughts of returning to this. We had considered it the next day but then we remembered our service and that was well enough to tell us to go elsewhere. Avoid."
Imran K.,"Walnut, CA",3711,725,48,4.0,4/3/2012,"Ashley from BJ delivered a catered lunch in Covina rheumatology office.  I was impressed Ashley is seen smiling , friendly and organised . She had all the pizza and salads.  The salad with chicken breast  sautéed with onions, red peppers, Napa cabbage, green onions and sweet baby carrots tossed with our teriyaki sauce and served over sticky white rice topped with sesame seeds is awesome. The vegetarian pizza now on whole wheat deep dish pizza crust.  With sliced mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, white onions and seasoned tomatoes. Well all thanks to Ashley for the excellent delivery on time and severed hot. Many times the food even does not show up."
Jewseph B.,"Azusa, CA",29,6,4,4.0,9/9/2014,One of my favorite places to eat in the area service is par food is good drinks are better
Ronney L.,"Alhambra, CA",515,133,277,4.0,11/12/2012,Mmm pazookie :)
rod s.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/18/2014,Horrible service! Waste of time. Waited for 40 min and food is not up to par. Manager cannot handle the job of running a restaurant. Better food nearby.
Rafa C.,"El Monte, CA",10,2,1,1.0,1/16/2014,"Well there's no big surprise that this place only has 3/5 stars, which would mean it is a  mediocre establishment; however, I'm a rating it as a single star, and that's only because I haven't figured out how to give a place something lower that that. I went to the place last Thursday night for happy hour, and while the beer was good and atmosphere pleasant, the service was horrible.  Our first round of beers came quick enough and  our food order was placed for our group. We began our conversation and lost track of time and before we knew it we needed a refill. Out came round 2. Only round 2 took a little longer. No terrible yet but definitely lost that 5th Star. Again conversations continued and again lost track of time.    Then we noticed we were getting Really hungry and there was no food in sight, and neither was our waiter. We checked the time and as it turned out and hour and a half had elapsed, 4th Star lost. What's the deal? Where's the food?  Not only did I almost have to stand on the table  in order to wave down our waiter, 3rd Star lost, but when he finally decided to grace us with his presence he explained to us that he had ""forgotten to push the SEND button on our food order."" Lost 2nd star.  Now mistakes happen And I understand; but what I couldn't understand is when the shift manager came over to apologies for the discrepancy she did not bother to offer a free meal, or discount on the beers, or Even a free Birthday Pizookie!!! This would be where they would have lost the final Star. Thanks a a bunch West Covina BJ's, way to represent your franchise."
Marina R.,"Los Angeles, CA",69,413,1163,3.0,8/8/2012,"I think the food here is OK, not great but not bad.  Their menu is huge and has more pages than most novels.  You're bound to find something to order.  The fried artichokes are cooked perfectly and the seasoning is tasty. 1 star for the extremely dangerous slippery floors found at every single BJ's everywhere.  Even in flats I always seem to fall (sober) and catch myself on a conveniently located table or chair. Besides that the service was good and their locally made cream soda is one of the best I've ever tasted."
Angelina C.,"Pomona, CA",14,10,2,1.0,4/22/2016,"I honestly used to love BJs until tonight. I ordered a curbside order for 9:15pm pick up. I was there at 9:10 sat in my car waiting and waiting. Finally at 10 pm I decided to go in and check if my order was ready as no one had been out that entire time. They checked and it was in the warmer and my salad was on top of the warmer. My order had probably been ready for awhile already and the girls at take out were standing there not doing anything I'm not sure why it wasn't brought out. Anyway I paid for my order and went to my car. Once I got to my car I checked and was given the wrong entree, even had the wrong name so I walked back in... The guys order I got was there picking up his order and the same girl that packed my order wrong had my order ready to go in his bag so they switched them and I finally got to go home to eat after over an hour. I got home to what was supposed to be a medium steak, no blood should flowing out when I put my fork in it to cut but of course it was pretty rare and blood was everywhere. My mozzarella tomato salad had 2 slices of tomato to go with all my mozzarella, pathetic. Lastly my baked potato was supposed to come with chives and sour cream but instead I got butter and chives. Overall my $20 dinner was not worth one penny and I'm so glad I didn't leave a tip. Horrible horrible service."
W C.,"Chino Hills, CA",22,14,1,1.0,1/19/2014,I have tried this BJs a few times and have been disappointed. I would avoid this location if you can.
Adrian V.,"West Covina, CA",76,6,,1.0,11/11/2015,"disappointed at the lack of attention we received by the staff. we had a waiter and a waitress and both failed to place the order for my two daughters that we ordered. they brought out my wifes and my plate and disappeared after that. our girls were hungry so we just fed them our food, glad we didn't order anything spicy! looks like we're going to have to stop for a second dinner on the way home. dont think i'll be coming back here... didnt see the staff again until the were ready to bring our check... very unprofessional"
Dan D.,"San Dimas, CA",105,395,14,4.0,1/23/2013,We have never been disappointed with the food service or value here. Always try to order something different and its always good.   They turn on the NHL network for me and the Lakers were losing so it was  great night
Victor U.,"Baldwin Park, CA",38,7,,5.0,6/24/2014,My favorite place to get fresh beer with some fresh and delicious pasta/burgers/pizza/etc. I definitely recommend going to this place if you've never been there before. Thumbs way up
Jonathan R.,"Covina, CA",1,4,1,1.0,3/20/2015,I WAS ACCUSED! I've been there twice and on my second visit CYNTHIA walked to my booth and said a waiter noticed I had left without paying previously. Never have I experienced something so embarrassing she didn't seem to care for an explanation rather she played coy and pretended that it was a possible mistake. In fact even after paying she didn't thank me or apologize. Worst experience ever CYNTHIA RUDE AF! Please stay away she will accuse you of dine and dashing. Ewwww
Brandon B.,"Pasadena, CA",1,3,,3.0,8/8/2014,"This review deserves to be a 2.5 but I thought I'd be generous. Me and my family came here for dinner today. But there was multiple problems. My turkey burger was good. My mother seemed to enjoy her salmon. But. My fathers burger was over cooked he requested medium but it seems that it was cooked well done, and my sisters steak was tough as tire. And to top it off the dessert took longer than the main course. Step your game up BJs or you've lost customers."
Aerial A.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,604,67,5.0,6/19/2014,I actually really like BJs! I went here for free Pizookie Day and it was amazing!
Rachel G.,"Baldwin Park, CA",92,15,10,4.0,12/22/2013,"Came here for lunch today with mom, we had the same server who we had been with on a previous visit, when I first saw her coming over I thought, ""Oh no,"" because the last time she really did not seem to know what she was doing. Today though, she did very well and seemed to be in a good mood so that was a plus :). Food was very good, I had the Tomato Bisque & Scampi Pasta, mom had Chicken Tortilla Soup & a green salad. The only complaint I have is that service was a bit slow, which it usually is here."
Courtney H.,"Portland, OR",55,149,39,1.0,3/1/2014,"I came here for lunch last weekend on Saturday and doubt I'll ever go back. I had experienced mediocre service here before, but last week was out of control. After being seated, the ""waitress"" stopped by and said she would be right with us.  We were then visited by 4 different people helping with drinks, food orders, and serving. I had to seek out a completely different waitress to get a plate for my pizza and silverware because no body bothered to bring those out either. After about 30 minutes and consuming all of our beers, we thought we might order another glass, but no one ever came back to the table. We had to get up to ask the hostess to get a manager so we could even get our bill. After leaving my credit card with the bill the same ""waitress"" comes by to pick it up, after about an hour passed from her initial hello.  During the entire sitting, we saw the same ""waitress"" skip over our table and the neighbors next to us. The neighbors also complained and said they'd never be back. The manager tried swaying us with a couple pizookie coupons which offended me and made me even more disgusted with the place. Thanks so much for the coupons! That made everything SO much better! Me thinks not. I would have been much happier with a discount on the shitty service instead of trying to persuade me to come back which I have no intention of doing. Beware of the horrible service and lack of genuine concern from the managers."
Sara M.,"Covina, CA",34,11,,5.0,2/22/2012,"i have been to Bj's a couple different times. Again when i was drinking their drinks werent weak but i could only have a couple. i primarily drink beer but fills me up to quickly. this is the only place i will order a mix drink.  their egg rolls and filled with avacado which i could eat all day if i could. very fresh and well made. my mom had the steak and a grilled chicken sandwich.  I am NOT  a fan of the service at the restaurant though. It takes forever, and when you ask another waiter/waitress for something they give you attitude. The bartenders are enjoyable though! haha!"
Dan F.,"San Dimas, CA",13,4,,4.0,7/28/2015,"Always busy and a positive Vibe. Menu has a lot of variety and pricing is fair. Usually good service , especially from one server named John, he was very helpful and always available for whatever we needed."
R. M.,"La Verne, CA",2,5,,3.0,1/22/2016,"Today I went to BJ's and  as usual it was loud, but that's okay because its that type of place and my hubby likes it. Now I have always enjoyed my food i.e. the taste and the appearance of it, but inevitably something was wrong with my order.  This is the second time I have ordered something that was not quite right.  The first time a couple months ago I ordered a mango salad, it came it looked nice and as I ate it, I realized something was not quite right...bingo!!!, no mango! what? they forgot to put in the mango, told  my waiter, he handled it and the actual manager delivered a new salad properly made and apologized. Ok fine, that was that.  Well, today I ordered the mahi tacos, as usual looked good, but such a miniscule amount of mahi I could hardly find it in there, (and I know that's what I'm paying for). I brought it to the waiters attention, and of course they gave me a whole new order with still such a teeny tiny bit of mahi inside, I believe that is just the way they serve them because I checked my 2nd one from the 2nd order and it was just a bit there too. Anyway, I'm saying this to say I wouldn't order that if you're looking for mahi, because the taco consisted mainly of the fish taco slaw/salad which was quite tasty, but the fish is the star of the show if you ask me.  All in all, I'll probably go back there and get my usual pizza and as long as they keep giving me a second order every time they mess up."
