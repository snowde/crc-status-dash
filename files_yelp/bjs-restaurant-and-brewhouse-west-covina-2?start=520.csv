Brenda B.,"Covina, CA",80,88,71,1.0,10/16/2011,"Ugh...I went to BJ's two years ago and everything was crap. I decided to give it a second chance last night because my boyfriend really likes their brews.  We were seated right away...or we should've been...wet got to our table and it wasn't cleaned up. So we had to wait for someone to clean it. Meanwhile the hostess was chatting it up with us. She was nice. I guess we annoyed some customer and he yelled at us to go away (lolwtf?) finally about 10 minutes later we were seated next to that guy that yelled at us...which was kinda awkward. Our waiter arrived right away and we ordered our food. My boyfriend wanted to try the seasonal Pumpkin Ale but wasn't sure about it, so the waiter offered a sample. It was delicious. The beer hit you in layers. First it was the alcohol, then the pumpkin, then the cinnamon and then the cloves...all to blend harmoniously at the end. It was great.  We ordered the Exxxtra Hot 5 Pepper Hot Wings as an appetizer. I ordered them extra crispy. They arrived soggy. They weren't too spicy and they were pretty good. But I've had loads better. My boyfriend ordered the Country Fried Steak Dinner...The mashed potatoes were probably half butter, I tasted it right away. The steak wasn't seasoned enough. I had to season it for him and he agreed it tasted much better after. I ordered the fish taco dinner...Not seasoned at all...like seriously. Overall....I had to season everything. They even had Salt and Pepper on the tables...If I go to a restaurant I should never have to season my own food.  BJ's will not get a third chance."
El Rey D.,"West Covina, CA",0,11,,1.0,6/29/2015,"My sister and I visited this location on 6-29-15 and was very dissapointed with the service. The hostess was polite but for some reason would not look at me in the eye and insisted on speaking with my sister even though I was doing the talking. I don't know what that was about. Maybe she thought we were a couple & didn't want my sister to think she was flirting with me? I don't know but in any case it was not professional and made my sister & I uncomfortable. Our waitress's name was Marlena she was slow and lacked any sense of urgency, professionalism or service. I saw her chit-chatting with fellow employees and other patrons before, during and after our meal while disregarding my table and her other tables. I had to get her attention twice while she was wasting time and chatting with a man at another table and showing him pictures of her children on her phone. When I finally got her attention she seemed annoyed & brought us a refill of the wrong beverage. Anyway I'm usually a big tipper & feel bad when I leave without tipping even if the service was subpar. This time I gladly left 0 tip with no regret! It will be a very long time before I even consider giving this place another chance. People not only pay for food but also service and ambiance both of which were ruined by our waitress!!!"
Alan M.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,132,64,2.0,1/29/2012,"I'm preaching similar reviews that give this particular chain 2-3 stars.   If you don't mind long waits and slow service, then this place is for you.   Let's start with the positives - the atmosphere is pretty much the same as any BJ's.  I've been to the Glendale and Montebello chains for lunch and never had any issues.  I came to this one last night (for the first time) with a group of 15.  Although we called in advanced, we still had to wait for 45 minutes.    I expected waiting since we had a large group and this was a peak Saturday night time. (8pm)  At around the 30 minute wait mark, I overhead the manager tell the person who controlled the front desk to let the party of 8 and 6 go ahead of our group.  I was ready to tell our group to walk over to Islands restaurant which I saw from the distance.  I don't like to complain to the front desk person/greeter or whatever you call them.  I was polite but she must be having a bad evening.  She gave excuses such as: ""well you should call days in advance if you have large party"" ""10 more minutes....""  (repeatedly) The worst excuse for the long wait was: ""you didn't tell me your entire party was here.  Ok, now we can put you in the queue"" (or words to that effect)  My friend was more assertive with the manager and eventually we got were seated.  By the ways, the gal/greeter who manned the front gave me this bitchy look and said, ""next time you should phone several days in advanced""  (Ok, I guess this place isn't good for impomptu dinners) The food is consistently okay (as with the rest of chain).   The pizza was delicious as usual.  Since we had a large party, we had two servers.  We  ordered our food as soon as we were seated.  Since we were waiting in the lobby, we tried to make sure we knew what to order since we were hungry.  I was fortunate to be at the end of the table which had quicker delivery of the food.  The other end had the slow service.  They got their pizza and calzone AFTER we finished ours.   (Yes, we passed some of our food to them.  How much longer?  About 40 minutes!  Yes!  Again, one person in our party assertively spoke to the manager who said dessert on the house.   Hence, my rating goes from two stars to three stars.  Geez Louis, we could have ordered a pizza and had it delivered quicker.  One of my buddies was tempted to that at the 20 minute wait period.  If we did that, the waiter probably would have spit in our food. I don't believe the bad service was intentional.  I simply believe they can't handle the peak times. So my advice to you if you go at Saturday/Friday night and if you have a large party:   - expect 1.5 hours  - split up your party - I don't think the servers are happy to work in a demanding environment - if you are in rush, skip this restaurant and find a nearby restaurant. The place is probably a 3 star if we did not have to wait and given the run around. If you have a large group of 10 or more, this place is a 2 stars.   A two-stars in Yelp implies ""I've experienced better"""
Juan R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,6,,1.0,5/29/2014,Horrible! Don't go even if it's a special occasion. Worst experience. No place setting. Wrong food and couldn't explain why. Wanted to argue. Manager needs to be replaced. Will never come back.
Ricardo G.,"West Covina, CA",31,25,,2.0,9/19/2013,"Love the food here at Bj's and it is definitely the only thing that keeps me coming. With that said, the service is usually pretty bad. The other night that I went was no different. I can't remember the name of the waitress that helped us but she is probably in her 40s-50s, white, and the past couple of times that we have been there she has served us in the bar late at night. The first time, I wanted to try a different beer so I asked her opinion about the Tatonka Stout, and she said that it was great, that she really loved it and that I should try it out.  So I took her advice and tried it out.  Now, I'm no newb to dark beers, but really, that beer was kinda gross.  Gross to the point where I only drank half and just left the rest.  But!  That is not the upsetting part because I wanted to try something new and I knew that there was a possibility that I would not like and that would absolutely not be the waitresses fault.  So the next time we go, we got put in her section again.  She asked what I would have and I said I would think about it because last time I tried the Tatonka Stout and it wasn't very good, and she replies ""oh yeah, the tatonka stout has a really weird taste, I wouldn't recommend it!""  So I just laughed to myself and I'm thinking - what a dick, you know? So I order some other drink, a raspberry type soda or something because I was thirsty as hell and I wanted something with refills.  So she brings it, and it is actually very good and as many times I asked for a refill she just wouldn't bring it.  I saw her come to the tables next to me and bring them refills and every time she came by me she said that she would be right back with my refill.  Haha it wasn't until we were literally about to walk out, we had already paid and everything that she finally brought me the refill, and again I'm left thinking - what a dick!  If it was a busy day I would be a little more sympathetic, but both times were during the week and the place was not packed like it gets on weekends. Damn you Bj's for luring me into your establishment with great food but terrible customer service!"
Diana H.,"Baldwin Park, CA",588,699,1425,5.0,5/8/2012,"Came here last night for my best girl friend's birthday. Wow, right off the bat the service was extrodinary. I think it's because we arrived just in the right time where it's not too crowded and the server was kind.  After not drinking in literally months and not drinking a lick of alcohol in New York, I decided to drink that night. I ordered their new drink....mixed berry martini or something like that. I had two and at the end of the night, I honestly couldn't remember the exact name for the drink. I asked our server what he thought of the drink and he didn't know because it was new on the menu. He asked me, later on about the drink and I fairly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to have two! haha I think I enjoyed the fact that he actually made my drink in front of me, it was pretty awesome.  Now, my main course was the Garden Medley Salad. I love that salad so much! But I think it was the drink that I cared for to review. Overall, great night due to the drinks and the company. Spent $32 on two drinks and a salad. Perfect way to start off the week!"
Logan H.,"San Clemente, CA",7,113,21,4.0,4/6/2014,"Its BJ's ... come for the pizza and  a pizzookie. I cant say how their breakfast is because I have never had it. I tend not to trust places known for their lunch and dinner menus, when they start serving breakfast. Its just like ihop, even when I go for dinner i order breakfast menu items. thats just me"
Jay J.,"Upland, CA",19,10,4,1.0,7/8/2014,"This is one of the worst experiences I've had. We sat at the tables close to the bar, what made me angry was other people were getting their drinks before ours. What kind of service is this?? Plus the other waiters weren't very friendly. Just from that experience I won't be going for a long time until new people start working there. Management has some work to do with teaching their employees customer service skills. If you don't like your job, THEN QUIT!!!"
Cyndi M.,"Pomona, CA",0,25,,2.0,5/31/2015,Went for dinner and was not impressed with it.  Service was great but my meal could have been better.  I ordered fish and chips but when I received my plate the fish batter was soggy as though it had been sitting in oil. Fries were so-so. This plate was highly recommended by the waitress. My husband's rib eye was cooked to perfection but was tough!  Now I know why I stay away from BJ's!
Jennifer D.,"Covina, CA",35,69,16,3.0,11/17/2013,1 star for the wait . 2 stars for the food . And 3 stars for service. Good thing is I complained about all three and got our food on the house . When my food came my husbands burger was burned and we got a freeeal after that . Will never go back .
Corey T.,"Covina, CA",2,4,,5.0,5/24/2014,By far the best service I've had here. Nicole is an amazing bartender and treats you well! Great communication and very attentive! I will definitely be back!
Larissa A.,"Corona, CA",1,8,3,1.0,6/30/2015,"As much as my family enjoys the food, the service is horrible. This place is always so busy but they never seem to have enough staff. The kitchen is on the other side of the restaurant and takes the servers forever to bring your food. If you are hungry, don't come here."
Amber H.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,11,,2.0,8/9/2015,My sister nephew and I walked in for lunch today. A panel behind a poster sign in the lobby fell on my nephews head. We were seated right after. The food was good. But the service was lacking. I think this location would benefit from a team effort. Yes we had a runner bring our food. But because of the distance from our table to the kitchen anything else we needed took longer then it should in a lunch service. Unfortunately this looks bad on the servers.
Simone V.,"West Covina, CA",157,137,190,4.0,8/26/2011,"Great spot to hang out with friends. Was there last night with some good friends and we had their appetizer sampler platter.  The artichoke dip was pretty tasty, tho we were there more on a mission to drink the night away. I had their wild berry and white peach mojito. They were both very refreshing. I also had their strawberry martini. It was pretty light and tasty as well. Their dirty martini was just right for me, tho my friend would beg to differ. Overall, their drinks were well mixed and just right and thier service was good too."
Brichelle B.,"West Covina, CA",103,30,2,1.0,5/11/2015,I will not be returning to this location! The waitress was awful! Took over two hours to get a salad and soup that we ordered as an entree. And when it came the salad was soggy and the soup was cold! This is the second time that this waitress has given us bad service!
Catalina T.,"Los Angeles, CA",667,753,2250,5.0,2/1/2008,"first time there was a lunch trip for some food and the famously known pazooki that wilson and his friends talked about. I wanted to experience it for my own since i have a sweet tooth. i had fettuccini alfredo and it was pretty good. I've also been there during happy hour and had some of their special pizzas, not bad and pretty good prize, affordable for us college students.  so my first time there wilson, his friends and i ordered pazooki party platter. WONDERFUL!! its a must if you have a sweet tooth. its a huge giant cookie, still warm from the oven with ice cream and whipped cream on top. i have also had the cookies n cream pazookie, probably my favorite. so if you into bjs for lunch or dinner, just remember, there is always room for dessert and order a pazookie, it will make you happy. service has always been pretty decent there. decent waiting time and pretty friendly."
Alexis R.,"Rosemead, CA",256,23,7,3.0,9/18/2013,"Very busy on a Wednesday night. Waited over 40 min for a mini pizza. Cheese wasn't as melted on the pizza and pepperoni was oddly stacked in the middle. Pazooki hit the spot! Would have gave BJs 4 stars, but the cleanliness of the place was off. The menu was still wet and partially dirty and the floor under the table was disgusting! BJs is really good so of course I'll try it again."
Tom S.,"Duarte, CA",24,54,,4.0,7/1/2012,"Usually when I eat at BJs, I'll either get pizza or one of their sandwiches. This time I ordered the ribeye steak and it was surprisingly good. I say that because you don't usually think of BJs as a place to get a good steak, but this could hold its own against a lot of steakhouses. Had the white cheddar mashed potatoes and chicken tortilla soup for sides. Washed it down with one of their signature beers, the ""Nit Wit"".  This is a great place to go if you're out with your buddies and want to go to a place with a sports bar like atmosphere. Plenty of TVs around the place, including a humongous one at the bar that shows four channels at once. Always fun to try the different beers and the food is better than what you usually get at sports bars."
Tom C.,"Seal Beach, CA",0,3,,1.0,11/3/2013,"Disappointing.   Went on a Sunday evening.  Wasn't packed, but plenty of customers. Good atmosphere. Seated promptly.  Server was nice and took our drink orders.   Ordered appetizers and then main courses.  The disappointment was in the delay of getting the food to us.  No special order or requests where made, just basic orders.  Second disappointment, cold pizza. Really?   Delay in one of our items also.....then Mgr came over to apologize.  We appreciate that he did that and he took both cold and delayed pizzas off the bill.   Then we ordered pazookie cookie dessert.  It was triple deal, three little cookies.  One was hard as a rock.    Server put in order for full size and Manager brought item himself and apologized again....and took off the bill.   Overall bummed, rarely go to BJ's and to get a poor experience puts this place in doubt to return."
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,4.0,1/7/2012,"Good & quick service. Although our waitress did get my order wrong this one time, she made up for it because she brought it out rather quickly. We went when there was a Laker game so of course it was super packed. Nonetheless, BJ's always has good food. Pizookie is the BEEEEEST."
