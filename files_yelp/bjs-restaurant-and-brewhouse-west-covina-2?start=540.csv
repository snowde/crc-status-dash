Rachel C.,"Duarte, CA",13,51,1,3.0,3/6/2014,"Avocado egg rolls - yum. Seared ahi salad with Wasabi salad was yum too!! Kids menu offers standard kid foods, but spaghetti was a hit!"
Shelly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,29,38,2.0,8/4/2013,I've been here a few time when it was crowded but this time was just awful. Our service was less than poor and each time someone came out 20 min later saying sorry. I would've left but I wanted my chicken salad out appetizers came about 25 minutes later and other tables were served waitress Ashleigh was overwhelmed then 40min later was told she dropped food.. Only complained after we received food don't trust people..just had the worst experience will never go back again...food was warm. My tip was to do better!!!!!
Paul K.,"Bandera, TX",379,553,284,4.0,2/6/2012,"This BJ's isn't too bad.  The staff is friendly, and they don't usually screw up my orders, but the parking here is terrible.  Really terrible if you don't like walking, or your date has high heels.  Otherwise, no complaints here."
Gus H.,"La Puente, CA",30,48,4,1.0,5/24/2015,"I'm unsure..... Lipstick was on the coffee cup. Supposedly it was was washed? Sick sick sick. Plus, they never brought me what i ordered. The waiter charged it and then later removed it."
Christina K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1882,504,121,3.0,7/24/2011,"Umm...just from looking at it you could tell my root beer was completely flat. Why was there no ice in it either? Initially, the waitress was impersonal, but warmed up a little throughout our meal. The appetizer came out and it was not what we ordered so waited for them to correct it. Waitress then brings the check out. What if I wanted some dessert? Jesus. Is it that difficult?  Pizza is always good here. I would stay away from the ahi appetizer. Just a pile of lettuce, tiny bits of ahi, and few speckles of avocado."
Tammy T.,"Woodside, NY",203,214,2364,3.0,10/27/2009,"It might have been a sports night cause it was pretty loud. Other then that, it was alright. I don't think I'd go back, even if I was visiting Phoenix again. Just not my style of dinner. I like to hear my company rather then just seeing their lips move. But, like I said, it might have been some sort of sports even. If it wasn't than, even worst, it's just way too loud in there. We just ordered a bunch of stuff, and did it family style. Leave it to the group of Asians in Phoenix to do it that way. The pizza was pretty good, along with the Santa Fe Salad. My favorite was the Cajan pasta. The bread was pretty tough though, like break the teeth kind. GGgggrrrr!"
Alison W.,"San Jose, CA",413,1590,952,3.0,11/12/2011,"BJ's is probably my one of my favorite sit down chain restaurants. Reasonably priced and delicious food, esp their lunch specials and they have one of my favorite desserts - the pizookie. Even though essentially it's a giant cookie with ice cream. Haha. Anyways stopped in while out on the job for a quick lunch. We all went with the lunch specials - the half sandwich with soup or salad was the most popular. I wanted something more flat so I got the pizza and soup. Clam chowder was very salty. The pizza - a mini deep dish with meatballs was delish. I love deep dish. Only finished half of it so had another meal. And all for $5.95. So inexpensive. Service was a bit lacking but overall you did it for me again Bjs!"
Savannah C.,"Ontario, CA",39,24,90,2.0,1/23/2012,"Been to this location a few times.. ALWAYS disappointed! Honeslty, I go to BJ's for the pizookies.. went this Saturday and the worst pizookie! The cookie was waaaay uncooked and server did nothing about it. Meh.."
Tasha M.,"Long Beach, CA",26,178,75,2.0,12/15/2013,"Sooooo happy to be visiting family and we decided to eat at BJ's after a lil xmas shopping in the area. It was sooooo packed but the wait time to be seated was only 15-20 minutes. We decided, hey why wait let's hit up the bar area so we can get right to eating. Well that was the worst decision that we made. Our waiter Ramon comes over and greets us. Asks if we would like to start w our drinks, I ask what sodas do u carry and his reply ""Pepsi products"". I say hmmmm ok so thays Pepsi and uhhhh? I say this because I'm not an advit soda drinker more like water drinker. I felt his response was soooo wrong to a customer. Ramon rarely checked on our table, my aunt had to flag him down to get more hot water n lemon (she was sick). She finally just asked for a kettle of hot water this way we dont have to worry about Ramon ignoring our table.  It was sooooo sad because my aunt and I always base our decision for a tip and how great of a tip on the first 7-10 minutes of ther server catering to us. Ramon seemed more interested in his larger group tables, but lil did he know I am a great tipper bcus I understand their line of work. He brought my cuzns cream soda w no straw, that took forever to get. He brought out only 1 set of silverware n napkin when there were 3 of us.  This was just by far the worst restaurant service ever. I have been to the one in Cerritos which is my fav many times to watch games hang out n chill with friends. Best service ever there. Maybe because I am from the Long Beach South Bay area my standards for servive expectations are just higher because of what I am accustom to.  I only gave BJ's a 2 star becuase the food was great, now that was consistent :)  It's soooooo sad to have bad service like this from BJ'S, when I know they train them well. Hell I hired one of their employees to work for me at the bank and he was the best employee ever who also got promoted quickly.   Ohhhh I say Ramon as that is the name on my receipt bcus the server did not identify himself upon initial arrival to our table"
Gretzel R.,"Riverside, CA",311,11,11,3.0,1/9/2014,"We came here for the niner game and of course my hubby wanted to sit right in front of the tv that played the game. The place was pretty packed but they accommodated our request to have our table in front of the game. Our server was very nice, but i have to admit our food took a while to get there. They didn't have the rootbeer ready for my husband but gave him cream soda instead. He wasn't so crazy about it but we appreciated the thoughtfulness. Overall, this place was good."
Raquel P.,"Covina, CA",64,53,17,4.0,2/20/2012,"this is the BJ's  restaurant close to home. My family comes here when we want spinach/artichoke pizza. Their asian chicken lettuce wrap and buffalo wings are the appetizers we get. I also like their sweet pig pizza. The wait isn't too long. It's in the shopping center by target, office depot, styles for less, ross, old navy,bed bath and beyond,dollar tree,party city,marshalls, and more. They check on you occasionally  to see if you need anything like refills or ranch. They refill your drink when they see that your glass is empty. I like this BJ's and is the only one I've been to that's close to home. and they give you a free pizookie for your birthday. =)"
Joshua G.,"Modesto, CA",27,53,21,3.0,1/28/2014,"The food was great, the service was just mediocre. We visited here on 1/25/14. We sat in the bar area. The restaurant was busy, and our waitress was kind, but forgot several parts of our order, and it seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to get our food."
Nicole H.,"West Covina, CA",57,7,,2.0,5/20/2013,"This Bjs is anything but prompt. I have never been greeted by a server at my table in less than five minutes. One time it took 15 minutes before someone even came over. I was beginning to think i wasnt going to get helped at all. The waiters have no energy and you're lucky to get a smile. I really don't think they care much about their customers but I do enjoy some of the menu items so ill give it 2 stars. The management that ive seen around is usually friendly. Definitely wont be coming here as often with these recent experiences, however."
Cynthia P.,"West Covina, CA",181,91,184,4.0,10/26/2011,"Its the bomb for beer, appetizers and dessert! My friend and I always come her when we wanna go out to eat have have a few beers in the daytime! Cool spot to chill, gossip and get fat!"
Scott D.,"Covina, CA",7,23,17,2.0,9/2/2013,"This is not a general review, just a review of my service on Labor Day. I was so looking forward to placing a quick order over the phone and stopping by to pick it up. The first attempt at calling resulted in a long hold, when somebody finally came on to the line they put me on hold again. Then, they put me on hold a third time. *click* Yup, that's right, long holds and followed by a hang up. Okay, second phone call. After TWO MORE HOLDS I finally got to place my order! It only took three read-backs of my order to get it right. Look, I get that it's busy, but Jiminy Christmas, get somebody to handle the phones. Pizza still really good."
Danmo H.,"Montclair, CA",231,590,1953,3.0,9/29/2011,"Great deal on lunch specials!  I read the calorie count on the dishes, and usually go with the all you can eat soup and salad.  Minnestrone is delicious!  And I can always be persuaded to pretend it's my birthday so I can have a free p'zookie."
Audrey C.,"New York, NY",715,198,142,4.0,2/9/2011,"PIzoooookie. I'm just drooling having to think about it. I've tried every single cookie and they're alllll delicious. On top of that, I've gotten their asian chicken salad, all of their pastas, their baked potato, the club sandwich, a couple of their mini pizzas and a couple other dishes I forgot the names of . Needless to say, I come here a lot..Something I recently discovered is calling in and picking up the food. It's hot and fresh when you go get it and you don't have to wait! I love the laid back atmosphere of the place. It's a place to go to watch sports and just hang out with friends. The service is great too in spite of the fact that everyone that works there is practically in college and high school.  I've been to countless birthday and other group events here and it's very accommodating for large groups. Beware on weekends because it is sure to get packed starting at 5."
Jackie G.,"Ontario, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/1/2015,"Went in for a quick dinner with friends, I've never been to a BJ's for the beer (I know I know) but it all changed when I met John F. He was very knowledgeable of the beer and was really attentive with us! The brewhouse blonde is now my favorite! I will definitely be returning for the whole experience when I have a DD lol"
Hardi W.,"Diamond Bar, CA",8,9,,4.0,1/24/2012,"I love this place..  The place always pack on weekends but luckily we always find some seats on the bar when waiting our table.. their avocado rolls is the best appetizer ever .. then goes the pizzas and Jeremiah Red beer.  The service is great, the waiters are always friendly.  October is always a special ones, since they have the Pumpkin beer.... cheers !!"
Ezequiel F.,"El Monte, CA",13,1,,2.0,2/6/2014,One of the worst service that I have ever received. The waitress serving me seems to give me the run around and blames other staff for mistakes...I've enjoyed my food at other BJ's but this location doesn't seem to get their things together
