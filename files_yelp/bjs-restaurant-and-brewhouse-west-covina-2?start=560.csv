Gretchen R.,"Claremont, CA",305,171,5,2.0,10/6/2011,"This is the worst BJ's I've been to.  I've been to several around Southern California and this one has the worst service and worst food quality.  It might be because this one is really busy. They didn't bring out my salad and I had to ask for it and my uncle's salad as well.  Blue cheese dressing was sour/vinegary.  Not good. The pizza was good and so was the pizookie, both were as expected. We had to flag down the server to get drink refills and even then, they didn't bring them and we had to ask again."
Natalie D.,"San Dimas, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/26/2014,"A friend and I had dinner here on Saturday evening. I arrived at 6 and was immediately seated. The service was terrible! We ordered an appetizer, which came out promptly, however we were not given any plates. We waited and finally our server walked by and I asked for plates. About 10 minutes later we asked a different server walking by if we could have plates. We had to ask a 3rd server if we were expected to eat off the tables or would it be too much to get plates. The appetizer was cold by the time we got plates.  We ordered the house Blonde beer. After ordering a 2nd beer, the server brought a different kind saying they were out of the blonde. We asked for a bottled beer instead and he brought out something we didn't order, saying they were changing all beers. A gentleman in a blue shirt, appeared to be a manager, walked by and checked to see how things were. We explained that the service was very slow and we were waiting for awhile for our drinks. He said he would check and let us know but he did not return. Our server (Christopher) eventually returned with the bottled beer that we ordered. Christopher never asked if we wanted a glass, so my friend asked for one. He returned with the cold glass about 15 minutes later.  The food was good (even the cold appetizer) but service is bad. This is the 2nd time I have received terrible service at this particular location. I figured the first time it was just one of those rare incidents and just chalked it up to them being busy. Today was the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant and I wish we had gone elsewhere."
David T.,"Covina, CA",0,3,,2.0,4/5/2015,My wife and I used to love coming here. Everything used to be fresh and hot. But I think they changed to frozen ingredients.  Not the same satisfaction.  Dry and tasteless.
Reina G.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/28/2015,"Worst experience ever.  Hour and a half wait for our food.  When my order finally came out they forgot my mashed potatoes when I asked our waiter her response was you substituted for a salad when I never said such thing, it gets better she gives me the attitude when I told her that wasn't true.  Worst experience I would not recommend this BJS in Covina."
Justin J.,"Chino, CA",115,210,50,4.0,12/20/2013,"Great beers and desserts. Mahi salad is perfect, and the beer.. oh the BEER! My fave is the blonde! But don't ask the bartenders for help in picking out what you are looking for. For some reason, they don't have an understanding on what drinks mesh will with which foods. Always been that way, and still like that today. Weird.."
Silvia B.,"West Covina, CA",7,32,3,1.0,3/16/2013,The absolute worst-ordered an appetizer-hot wings-took a while to get them-once we did they were cold!!! the service was horrible-waiter got my order wrong-!!! i wil never eat there again!!!!
Riza A.,"West Covina, CA",10,32,12,1.0,9/4/2014,"Worst service from beginning to the end. Took my Mom for lunch today and we had a server who was younger Asian girl who was absolutely the most inattentive waitress. We had to call her over to request to put our orders in after time passed with zero attention to the table. I had to call her over to fill my drink, she than filled mine and left my Moms below ice level. I noticed our neighbors at the table closeby getting much better service for obvious reasons, they were a larger party. Our order finally arrives and the chicken in my tacos was stale (hard as a rock) and appeared to have been sitting over night. I than asked for a manager and got Will the GM. He said a lot of nice things and apologizes and turned us over to a new server. After another 10 mins I get a new plate. After eating we requested our check from John our new server who  than disappeared. We had no choice but to revert back to the original waitress who delivered the check. It included the stale chicken plate. I than asked for a business card some other guy who was another manager and Will both showed up and Will said our meal was paid for (my cc was already ran I'll update if I get a credit so far nada). Just a overall horrible experience. I've used bjs for both business and personal. I hope they get their act together."
Shaunna C.,"Covina, CA",67,176,10,2.0,11/1/2011,"I am not a huge fan of BJs, but the few times I have been here or ordered take-out, the food is decent and the staff has been alright. Nothing outstanding about this place at all. I am really just unimpressed, but I can't think of anything particularly bad to say. The food is nothing special, everyday average bar food, basically - it will do when you're hungry.  I will likely go back for their home brew, maybe an appetizer, but I would rather head elsewhere for a nice meal."
Danielle A.,"Denver, CO",224,82,3,2.0,9/18/2013,"Came into BJ's last night for a friends birthday dinner. Got there on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty so we were able to get a table right away. We were seated and a server came over right away to get our drink orders, also has another guy with her but doesnt introduce and say ""He is training"" or anything.  We got our drinks but were not asked if we wanted to try any of the beers or alcohol. No upselling here. We all ordered and received our food. We got stuffed mushrooms, moroccan chicken, and moroccan salmon, and a southwest salad. All of these items were from the 500 and under menu. Dont be fooled, it may be half the calories because it is certainly less than half the portion but for full prices. My chicken ended up coming out as salmon so I just ate it because although the restaurant was fairly empty, we waited about 30 minutes for our food. The salad was so pathetic and small, think about 2 cups of lettuce and a couple slices of avocado. The stuffed mushrooms (which is an appetizer) would not have been enough for the table, it was like a snack (think edamame). My couscous was cold and I was still hungry after my meal yet it came out to a whopping $13. I don't mind paying for good food but it was cold and the portions were actually upsetting.  It was my friends birthday so she got a pizzookie and we were amazed that the server said, ""we ran out of vanilla ice cream"", I mean did the pope run out of Bibles? Seriously! So we go a trio and had to get all chocolate, despite Baskin Robbins, neighborhood walmart, and Albertsons being in the same parking lot. When we got the dessert the ice cream was already almost melted and completely covering the cookie and the cookie was not warm. The chocolate ice cream was way to much. As we are about to take a bite of our dessert our neighboring table gets their dessert and.............. they got vanilla ice-cream. We told the waitress we really wanted vanilla and she said, ""yah I know, they just got it, sorry"". Okay? So we finished our dessert. The manager came over and said ""how was everything?"" and I said kind of a disappointment because we didnt have the dessert the way we normally like it he then said ""oh bummer, yah we just ran out of it"". Then he literally tossed 2 giftcards on the table and said ""these have anywhere between 5-500 dollars on it for your next visit"", well there were four of us at the table. So I proceeded to say, ""well for the inconvenience can we all get one? We did have luke warm meals and no ice-cream"" then he said something so ridiculous for a manager that I am offended.  He said, ""Well did you have separate checks?  I said, ""well we could but we wanted it to be easier for the server"", He said, ""WOW FEISTY"", then threw two more at the table and walked away. WALKED AWAY!!!!! I guess the manager is new and his name is Manny. I was so shocked that he had talked to me that way and that he had such an issue with giving us 2 extra cards. Especially because if we came back on 4 different instances with different or more friends wouldnt that end up being more money for this branch? Just saying.  The food here has really gone down and the service was terrible. I was appalled at the way we were spoken too and by a manager no less. Really disappointed with this location. I think we were really treated unfairly. It really wasnt so much the vanilla ice cream but more the service and quality of care and food we had received up until that point. TSK TSK BJS."
Josie Y.,"Lake Forest, CA",565,378,157,5.0,12/23/2012,"This place was great, I hate to admit it was my first visit but I'm glad to report how tasty the food was.  We went at lunch time and it was very busy but we got seated fairly quickly.  I ordered a redtini *Awesome* (Belvedere martini) and the southern fried chicken lunch special with cheddar mashed potatoes and grilled corn it was sooo good.  We started with the avocado egg rolls which were also very good.  Service was good, a bit slow because they were busy but very friendly just the same.  I look forward to my next visit."
Sarah L.,"West Covina, CA",0,4,,4.0,5/2/2014,Great beer and food. Love the avocado egg rolls. Great place to watch sports and drink some house brewed beers
Laretta C.,"Lakewood, CA",33,14,4,5.0,8/1/2014,Can't thank Brian the manager for the great job he did on setting up a rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding they were very organized and it went smooth he made it very easy . And the price was reasonable also. Thanks again Laretta
Rashel P.,"Irvine, CA",538,169,119,3.0,8/15/2013,Not too bad for a chain restaurant. I like the ambiance. Cool to go to either with friends of family. The loud atmosphere is fun especially at the bar. The food portions are big just as most chains and the food is what I would expect. Mediocre. Their appetizers taste like and have the quality of something I can find in the frozen section of Costco. The service is okay. Mostly young people just trying to make a lil money...
Marla C.,"West Covina, CA",0,14,2,1.0,3/3/2013,Poor service! Too many food choices in the West Covina area to be dissappointed.
Joe Q.,"La Verne, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/10/2014,"Did not expect to be eating here today, but a nice surprise, I'm glad we did! I'm always happy with the food. I even tried something new! Service was great once again! It seems everyone who worked there was concerned with how we were doing and making sure we had everything we needed. I go for the many different beers and the wife loves the top shelf margaritas, but the fun times keep us coming back!"
Pier H.,"Los Angeles, CA",238,353,128,3.0,6/6/2011,"Typical huge chain restaurant service and food.   Not too much stands out for me on the menu besides the pizookie's which are freakin awesome.  I love the tripple chocolate pizookie and I think its the best on the menu.  The chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top, but the vanilla ice cream tastes pretty terrible lately, like its not real ice cream or something.  The chocolate ice cream tastes much better."
Stephanie A.,"Glendora, CA",5,46,100,4.0,9/20/2013,I love this place the best beer for me is the Jerry Burst very good on the dark side of beer but not too heavy :) I love the Ahi Poke it is delicious and that beer I mentioned goes great with the Hand tossed chicken barbecue or the hand tossed Bjs favorite. I like this pizza more the original pizza because it is not full of too much bread. The hand toss pizza is just perfect. I love this place for dinner or just drinks you'll find it here every time.
Ronnie T.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,95,43,2.0,11/27/2012,"It's been awhile since I have posted a review and I really hate to make my first one in awhile a negative one, but I wanted to share my story.  BJ's has always been a place where I have enjoyed their brews and pizza's.  It has been awhile since I attended this location.  We decided to go on a Saturday night around 9:30.  The place was not too crowded we waited 10 mins to be seated we were a party of six.   My family and I had not gone out for awhile so we wanted to go out and shoot the Sh*t for a while.  We ordered a round of drinks and some wings to start, we later ordered a second round of drinks and more appetizers.  The highlight of the night and the only reason this review gets 2 stars and not 1 is because there was no large pizza's so we were given a medium pizza and a small.  That is a lot of pizza a lot more than a large.  Upon finishing our meal (we barely put a dent in the pizza) we were given our bill.  At this point it was around 11pm.  We ignored the bill because we had no intentions on leaving we were just hanging out and having drinks.  The server came by around 3 times to see if we took care of the check.  Finally she explained to us she was getting off her shift and if we could close out the bill.  Fair enough she has to go.  She could have explained that from the start, and she should have brought us a replacement server.  This is what is normally done in these situations its happened to all of us.  Server goes off shift a new server is brought in.  We paid the bill and told the server we had no intentions on leaving.  She said that was ok.  We sat there finishing our drinks and waited for about 20 mins.  At this point we wanted another round.  We flagged down a server.  He took our order and promptly brought us our order and along with a bill for that order.  Again we had no intentions on leaving.  At this point we were all getting frustrated. It felt as though we were being rushed out. I tried to look for a manager or someone I could talk to, but there was no one around.  Other gripes that were expressed at our table was the lack of music throughout the restaurant.  Its not a deal breaker for me as I don't like loud music, but some music would have been nice.   In the end we all left dissatisfied and wondered why were treated this way.  BJ's has lost my business for good.  The Applebees in Azusa has much better service and it's a place in my opinion a notch below BJ's.  A say notch below because I feel BJ's is a tad more upscale compared to Chilli's, Friday's and Applebees, but they proved to me that is not the case in terms of service.  I was wondering if this would have been different if we were seated in the bar area and not the restaurant, but I am not willing to find out.  I would avoid this place.  There are far too many locations in this area that are more deserving of your business. Ill keep it working class at Applebee's where I always get great service and a great atmosphere."
Michael L.,"San Ramon, CA",73,10,7,3.0,10/15/2013,"I have to comment about the lack of timely service here. It is good when they actually make it to your table, but its the in between times that are bad. We waited 15 min after being seated to have our order taken, and then another 20 after we were finished to get our bill back to us. Definatly the worst BJ'S location I have been to."
Aubree P.,"Fort Collins, CO",20,61,20,2.0,3/17/2014,"Good food, but it is always WAY too expensive for the portion size and quality of the food. Had better at other restaurants, even had better at home (much cheaper too!)"
