Amy T.,"San Dimas, CA",0,18,1,5.0,8/4/2014,Went for a quick lunch today with my spouse and son.  We have had some questionable service at other places recently so our expectations were minimal at best. What an absolute pleasure that we went to BJ's.  The food was spot on delicious but better yet our server was one of the best we've ever had anywhere. Rebecca A. was at the top of the game. We will be going back thanks to her and the quality of the food.
Ophelia C.,"La Puente, CA",2,14,4,5.0,12/19/2012,"Never once have I been dissapointed. Food is always hot and ready quick, drinks are always refilled promptly, service is all around excellent!....BJ's in Wesco, you guys rock!"
Vanessa C.,"Glendora, CA",102,14,3,1.0,10/1/2013,"Horrible service tonight!! Our waitress forgot our appetizer plates, the utensils, forgot my honey mustard, and spilled the water....My soup tasted like it's been sitting all day."
Shenandoah S.,"West Covina, CA",105,138,7,3.0,5/19/2013,"Pricey but the food is good and the service is usually nice.  It's a clean place and they make the best Arnold Palmers. So, yes, I will be going back."
Jesse E.,"La Puente, CA",0,10,2,4.0,1/17/2015,Food is great. I recomend the Barbeque Bison burger. Rib eye steak very delicious.
Karla V.,"West Covina, CA",32,71,3,1.0,10/21/2012,"i rarely come here. I've been here about 4 times in my life time and now i remember why- the food is not that impressive.  there is nothing playful nor mysterious. it took us a while to decide on what to order. i got the new thai chicken salad.  the chicken was super dry... it really dried up my mouth.  the food is very blah.  chicken wings are good but a little over a buck each. bjs is not a place i dream on visiting again. Also, is super loud and a once again, the dental assistant thug-ish and slightly over weight girls from Eastern San Gabriel Valley come here."
O H.,"Covina, CA",3,59,,2.0,1/9/2013,"BJ's of West Covina stands out among the many restaurants because of its size and decor, but that is where it ends at least for this writer. I joined several friends for lunch on a lazy Thursday afternoon. The noon rush was over and the place was generally empty as several severs were clustered chatting. We were seated and the usual colorful menus were given to us with a drink order asked before we had been seated ten seconds. The waitress/server appeared bored and distant and thankfully said she would return, a minute later she returned to ""take your order."" We finally ordered drinks and she pointed out the lunch specials indicating her favorites. Most notable was the flat bread with salad and the half baked potato. The flatbread was burned on the edges, dry and lacked any imagination, with its adjoining salad that lacked any significant amount of dressing. The uncooked half baked potato was drenched in some sort of chili sauce covered with sour cream and onions. The waitress/server did not return to check on whether there was any problem with the order and efforts to summon here revealed that she had left and no one knew who had replaced her. The saving grace was our conversation in seeing old friends and renewing old ties. Our party did not consume much of the food and the dishes were set aside to continue our conversation.  A person in our party physically had to find a server to bring the check and when she arrived she merely placed it on the table and left with no word regarding our food. The check was paid and she finally noticed little of the food had been consumed asking if we wanted doggie bags. We told her the food was horrible and were upset that no one attended to us, she curtly apologized and left. And we followed suit leaving disappointed.   Bad food, bad service not a place to come to between shifts....."
Chris P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,3,,2.0,2/3/2013,"The only reason I'm giving two stars is because I liked my Raspberry Iced Tea. The establishment wasn't crowded, at all (Super Bowl Sunday). I went with my wifey and we ordered the following: potato skins, five gourmet meat hand tossed pizza, and caesar salad. The potato skins weren't that hot, the pizza was a bit soggy, and I had to remind the waiter about the caesar salad. Our main course arrived before the salad. The table next to us (one of 6 other customers) even received the wrong check. Needless to say, I won't be going back there."
Alexandru D.,"Anaheim, CA",5,57,7,5.0,6/14/2013,"I love the pizza at BJ's, we usually get it loaded with all the veggies and pepperoni. The food has a superior taste and the service is not bad either. If you plan to take your date somewhere fun and you like pizza and beer then make it BJ's, order a pizza and the beer sampler, you will not regret it. :)"
Nikki K.,"Chino, CA",9,3,1,1.0,1/2/2013,"We picked BJ's for a birthday dinner. We went in with a party of 5 and it was packed. I was shocked that we were quoted a 35 minute wait. An hour later we still were not seated, that should have been the warning. We were seated and our server came by to get drink orders.  Another huge wait.  We finally ordered food. The person that brought our food to our table was about as personable as a rock. We had to ask several times to get silverware.  What is truly amazing is that they said they were short on Parmesan cheese and peppers for the pizza, did I miss something aren't they known for pizza?  The service was slow, food runners were rude, food was only okay and the drinks seemed watered down. Next time I will opt out of a trip to this BJ's!!!"
Mark R.,"La Verne, CA",0,31,,2.0,2/25/2015,"the food was good, the waiter was very pleasant, but the service was  v e r y  slow strange... the server did not serve the food, nor the dessert maybe if the waiter was able to perform all the roles. i.e. greet, take the order, deliver items, repeat, the service would have been more efficient?"
German K.,"Los Angeles, CA",207,122,1,3.0,7/16/2013,"We've all been to Bj's before...expensive food that doesn't always live up to it's price tag. I normally get the pizza which, even though I always get it, I don't think it's that great. Ate there last night and decided to try something different. BIG MISTAKE! I asked the waitress what else is good and she suggested the Jambalaya.  I did not really enjoy that dish at all. It had a monotonous taste and I was sick of eating it by the 2nd bite, but I do not like to waste food, especially food that costs me like $16 bucks so I just kept on chowing down on it. My friend ordered the garlic butter linguini pasta and her dish was worse than mine! I had a bite of her pasta and that was the most bland plain pasta I've ever eaten. Literally tastes like pasta tossed with some butter and some tomatoes sprinkled in. The chicken that topped it was good but pasta was soooooo incredibly bland. I literally took 1 small bite and would not eat anymore.  Good for us happy hour kicked in since it was 10pm. We ordered some buffalo wings and lucky for us they accidently sent us a full order instead of the half order your supposed to get for happy hr.  Service was great. We got a girl named Tera? and she was pretty awesome! We commend you on providing us with a great dining experience. Got myself a bday pizookie and I was in sweet, ice creamy, fatness heaven! I recommend to sticking with the pizza, soup, & salads. I don't eat at bj's too often but I don't think I'll be adventurous anymore at this place."
Tommy K.,"Covina, CA",7,6,,3.0,1/2/2012,"We visited this location on New Years Eve, simply because we'd gone there last New Years Eve and it was so good. What a difference a year makes. We got there at 6pm and were seated right away. Service was good.  I ordered the Pot Roast with Roasted Vegetables. The roast was tender just like the menu said it would be, it would have been great if the gravy that covered the meat didn't have so much salt. There's no reason for anything to have that much salt. The dinner came with 'roasted' vegetables, Celery, onion and carrots, none of which were completely cooked. The carrots were ugly looking, with lots of white lines in them. My husband ordered the Jambalaya, he liked it."
Joseph G.,"Covina, CA",4,3,,5.0,5/19/2012,"I am in love with this place, Beer is excellent, yea its true you might have to wait a bit in the evening time to get a seat, but trust me its worth waiting. It would not be fair from my part if i dint comment about the customer services we receive there has noting to say other that excellent work ""love it' Pricing is very reasonable and an excellent place to hang out with friends and family"
Mike P.,"Montebello, CA",27,1,,1.0,2/7/2015,"Came here with a large group to celebrate my sister's graduation and the service took forever.  We had to wait 20 minutes for them to even come to us, then they spent 5 to 10 minutes talking to each other.  Then they said the could only separate our checks by table, which is fin, but then proceeded to take sporadic orders from us.  Then it took 10 to 15 minutes for either of them to return so the rest of us could order.  Then when they did they still did not get everyone's order.  We all ate at separate times, the waiter and waitress took forever to come around and give us refills.  They were a little more attentive to us towards the end of our visit, but it was not a good experience."
Stephen S.,"Upland, CA",0,4,1,1.0,9/13/2013,"Every time I go here, the hosts and servers look stressed out and overworked.  Good food, but not the environment to get good service. I'll try another restaurant nearby next time."
Joseph C.,"San Diego, CA",393,201,101,4.0,2/22/2013,"I got really wasted here! We came here for our co worker's goodbye party and we were ordering 1 of everything. It was insane! I felt like food was coming out every 5 seconds and we had nowhere to put the plates! There were tons of flatbreads and appetizers sitting around then came the octoberfest's brats and more brats. Right when I thought we're ready to leave, here comes 8 orders of large pizza. What?! Who ordered these?? Then comes more rounds of beer and more beer. Have you ever ate to the point where you're so full that you can't feel your stomach anymore? Maybe that might have been the alcohol! So my co worker kept saying he can out drink me and yeah, he didn't out drink me. Party party party let's all get wasted! Cheers!"
Dinora R.,"Glendora, CA",0,13,2,2.0,11/7/2014,"Hmm how do I start. My gf and I went for dinner for the second time since my bro had given us a gift card. First time around didn't like it. I always get the chicken crusted parmesean(best ever only reason why I gave 2 stars) . So we decided to give it one more chance and it was the worst idea ever! First of all we ordered a coke and water, we got a sprite and water. Secondly we ordered traditional wings for an appetizer they brought us boneless wings smh. When we finally got the wings after 15 min later after they brought wrong wings they were cold af. So instead we decided to go with avocado rolls WRONG!!! Avocado rolls had black avocados inside it was so disgusting yet another fail. My gf ordered limon and marinera sauce for her dinner it took them literally 14 min to bring which resulted in her eating a cold dinner. The only good thing was my chicken plate which I liked since they let me sub my brocrolli for clam chowder bowl. Never going to bjs again. It was literally and epic fail. We were so disappointed we didn't even wanna try the famous dessert (which we were looking fwd to try)"
Alexis M.,"Glendora, CA",130,75,,4.0,8/21/2012,"I go here A LOT. I really love the food here. The food is always delicious and it is priced reasonably, Service is okay, nothing special but not bad. It can get really loud so I wouldn't suggest it for a first date. I like to go on Mondays because of the five dollar mojitos. It is a great place to hang out with friends."
Danny N.,"West Covina, CA",2223,1421,50514,5.0,12/30/2010,"Pizookie, need I say more?"
