Stephanie A.,"West Covina, CA",8,6,,2.0,7/30/2017,"This past year, the place has really been going downhill.  Service has gone way down and so has their food quality.  Last night was no different when my friends and I came in for our friend's birthday.   The birthday girl's pasta was lukewarm, and had the same quality of a TV dinner.  A side to my entree was missing, and it never came out.  A soda was ordered and our server forgot about it. 15 minutes later we requested the soda we never received.  It finally came and was flat and warm as if it had been sitting out for awhile.  Lastly, we decided to share the churro pizookie -- there was a mini corndog covered in cinnamon sugar mixed with the churros.  Accidents happen, but when combined with the previous incidents it just grew into a frustrating evening.  It should have been a fun birthday dinner, but instead we ended up with lackluster service and subpar food."
Luis C.,"La Verne, CA",0,5,,1.0,11/5/2017,I wanted to spend a valuable time for my wife's birthday. I found the worst service of my life. 18 minutes for me to take the order. Waiters and two distracted supervisors who do not know what's going on in their restaurant!!!
Julie P.,"Pasadena, CA",1335,261,1069,4.0,10/25/2016,"This place is inside a plaza with bunch of business. It has lots of free and available parking. It was a busy day,but service was fairly quick. The place is set up like a bar. It was noisy with lots of sports on TV. It didn't bother me,but if you are looking for a place to hang out and talk. It might not work for you.I got to order the Fresh Atlantic Salmon,which is seasoned well with plater of rice pilaf and vegetables. There other speciality is the New Orleans Jambalya with blackend chicken breast, sausage with bell peppers in a spicy sauce (so tasty). We finish it off with their famous pizookie, which is their freshly baked, hot from the oven delicious cookie topped with scoops of ice creams. It was beyond imaginable."
Nicole P.,"La Puente, CA",5,61,25,1.0,4/10/2017,I am 8 months pregnant and all I wanted was a steak and baked potato last night. We opted not to go to a bigger steak restaurant because it was 6PM on a Sunday night and we didn't have reservations.  We were sat within 5 minutes and waited 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. Just as we were going to leave our waitress came and took our drink orders. We were ready to actually order then too.  Our side salads and appetizer came out. Still no drinks. (Just two waters and a beer for my husband.) Our waitress apologized that they have drink runners and that's why our drinks were taking long. Even the guy that brought us our appetizer said he couldn't bring us our drinks and explained to us all about the drink runners. Thanks but no thanks.  Our waitress went and grabbed our waters and our food came. My baked potato was cold... like from the fridge cold. The cold butter made it worse. My steak was way undercooked.  We left without eating and will not be returning.
Shae L.,"West Covina, CA",14,4,2,1.0,9/11/2017,We went to bjs and ordered pizza to go and as we were waiting we saw a rat run out of the kitchen!!!!! We canceled. Don't go there!!!
Bethany P.,"Denver, CO",0,2,,3.0,8/4/2017,So. I'm giving a couple of stars up because 1) Everything that went wrong before was fixed and... 2) The GM actually responded with sincerity and wanted to make sure that our experience was as good as it could be. I hope you guys continue to improve and provide good customer service. Thank you for listening and trying to be better. I understand working in customer service and it isn't easy. Keep on keeping on!
Sarah G.,"Dallas, TX",304,9,,2.0,10/24/2017,"While the food is decent, the service is honestly terrible. I'm a big fan of BJ's but this location is not managed well. They have also made mistakes on my food several times. I have celebrated many of my birthdays as well as my friend's birthdays there, and they continually disappoint. You're definitely better of going to one of the nearby restaurants if you want good service and if you want your food to be prepared how you like it."
Julie M.,"El Monte, CA",76,8,3,1.0,7/20/2017,"Went to this BJ's with a big group of coworkers and the service sucked. Our waitress took FOREVER to bring our drinks and food, as well as to refill my tables drinks. She was not polite whatsoever and she rudely rung all of us up. They also brought one of my coworker's food with onions, when he specifically asked with no onions because he's severely allergic to them. The waitress tried to deny that the dish had any onions in it and when my coworker wouldn't stop insisting that it did, she called over one of the other waitresses to check it out and seemed all annoyed. When that wouldn't have happen if they got the order right the first time.  Plus our waitress recommended the churro pizookie as one of the best ones, when in reality it was complete shit. It was just a stack of churros with ice cream but the churros seemed to have been cooked earlier during the day, so they weren't that fresh. I was very disappointed with the whole service and restaurant.  PLUS 3 of my coworkers got food poisoning from this specific restaurant. So none of us are EVER going back. Please don't go here!!"
Gabby A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,17,,1.0,10/16/2017,Nasty never again will I go there I went for lunch with my friend and I got a dirty spoon ughhhhhh disgusting!!!!! Grossed out just to think about it neverrrrrrr again will I go to any bjs in my life or I would never recommender it to nobody!!!! Wash ur dishes!!!! Nasty place!!!
Jennifer F.,"Westmont, Pomona, CA",133,14,2,4.0,10/21/2017,"Excellent service; servers (Matthew in particular) were attentive and conversational. Food here is usually amazing but this time, when i ordered the alfredo pasta with broccoli, the broccoli was undercooked and bitter. As always, the pizookie is delicious and will definitely come back as long as food is fully cooked next time."
Adriana A.,"Monrovia, CA",32,11,3,5.0,4/16/2017,"The wait was longer than expected. The host was not very pleasant but after management took over the waiting situation and we got the waiter named Steven, our experience changed completely.  The food was great and the service that Steven provided was superb. He was attentive, fast, and humorous. Thanks to Steve, ""the medium tanned waiter"" per his words lol, he made our Easter dinner pleasurable!!!"
Brandon B.,"La Habra, CA",0,5,4,1.0,3/16/2017,"So I've been to plenty BJ's in my lifetime and this one by far has been the worst. For starters it took them an hour for our food to come out and once it arrived it was all incorrect I order the Broccoli cheddar soup with the bread bowl and I got the soup but no bread bowl. And I asked them where the bread bowel was and they responded with they will bring it out in a second and I had to repeat it 3 servers until they finials brought it out the correct order. And than the bathrooms were the dirtiest bathroom ever. If there was an award for how filthy a restroom can be, hands down this place will be the winner. The public parks in east la or even Compton are way cleaner compared to these restrooms."
Cristina Q.,"Azusa, CA",0,4,2,1.0,10/11/2017,"WOOOOOOOOW! That was literally my expression when I left this facility 2 nights ago. To start off not only did our service suck the excuses sucked even more! My friend & I ordered 2 appetizers 10 minutes later we ordered a pizza. I noticed the appetizers were taking long(the guy next to us was halfway through his food & we ordered at the same time) but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a busy sports day. Nevertheless our pizza came out after our appetizers & at that point I was irritated. The bartender fetched our appetizers in less than a minute & said ""sorry people back their are lazy"" no shit they were just sitting on the counter. To top it off you could clearly tell they forgot to add 1 of our toppings & just threw it on top of the pizza. Regardless I kept my cool. As we finished our last drink I noticed something in front of me on the counter moving & I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked down. It was a BIG FAT COCKROACH!!!!!! The manager did not even have the audacity to look at us or say sorry all he did was take care of 1 of our appetizers & 2 drinks. A sorry would've been nice but coming from the same place that had frog legs in their salad goes to show how unsanitary this place is!!!! They should shut it down!!!!!!!!!!"
Tonatiuh M.,"Chandler, AZ",43,1,,5.0,8/29/2017,"I went to Los Angeles to visit my father, and we went to bj's for a beer. The Bartender Sarah was so nice. Helped us decide on beers, my father doesn't really drink the Ale beers.  But, she recommended the Blonde ale because he likes to drink bud light and wanted to try something new. I love that beer. The service was excellent, will definitely be back to this location.  Thanks Sarah! And the rest of the Bj's staff.  :)"
John P.,"Covina, CA",1,16,3,5.0,12/3/2017,"Came by last night w the fam and had a wonderful experience. Thanks to Genna and Christine.. it was a busy Saturday night as usual at Bj's but that didn't influence our treatment and the wonderful hospitality we were given... Genna was amazing. She was very professional, humorous(not boring), and also most important, continuously often made her rounds to be sure drinks were full and the food was on point from beginning to end. i can honestly say that all of us were so happy that we have never driven home after dining out and the kids(10 & 11) kept talking about how great their food, dessert, and service was. We will be asking for her regularly now.. you should too. I can assure, you will be in good hands and will not go wrong!!"
Brandon R.,"Burbank, CA",0,2,,5.0,10/3/2017,"This food was probably some of the best food I've ever had it was delicious I got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes white cheddar cheese and corn and it was to die for. I also had their hard root beer with Jameson and Bailey's and it was so so so good. For the flavor of the chicken was very Savory and moist. I highly recommend this place to other people the staff is kind and courteous, and Emy was the greatest waitress I have ever had 10/10 would recommend this this to a friend"
Nathan Q.,"Fontana, CA",0,6,4,2.0,4/5/2017,The food tastes horrible. Service was bad. Overall experience was wretched. My food tasted very bland and under cooked and my order was the worst and kept coming out wrong. PS my friend Adam said it was horrible too and she tricked us into getting salads we thought it was included but we were wrong‍‍
Daniel L.,"West Covina, CA",6,4,,1.0,2/6/2017,"My buddy turned 21 today.  As of 2017, everyone that turns 21 from now on their ID expires on their 21st birthday.  So when the server got to our table he threw the coaster down and asked for our order.  When he asked for my friends ID he gave it to him and I told him we were celebrating his 21st birthday. He looked at it a few different times and said it's expired I can't serve you.  I replied with that fact that he's 21 and has already submitted the form to request his new ID and he replied with ""It doesn't matter I can't serve you"" So I asked for the manager to simply ask if there's any other form of ID that he can show or anything else we can do and she came over and would not let me complete a sentence without interrupting me with ""but it's expired we can't serve you"" I realize it's expired, I was trying to see if there's anything else we can do but she would not let me get a word in and eventually ended up walking away while arguing with me. Overall, externally unprofessional and a terrible experience. I won't be going back to the bar again anytime soon and I recommend not requesting the manager unless you want to try and talk to a brick wall..."
Adam B.,"Chino, CA",16,105,84,4.0,10/16/2016,"This place is cool. It has one of the largest dinning rooms I have ever seen in a chain resturant.  The food is good.  I recommend the ribs. Not the best in the world,  but they are good.  Here's  a tip. If you are in the mood to go back to prison. STOP and don't commit that crime. Just go to BJ'S and order the ham and cheese. They serve it prison style on a tray. Make sure to ask for plastic utincels first."
Donna S.,"Los Angeles, CA",234,443,531,5.0,8/11/2016,"I typically frequent the City of Industry location so compared to that one, the West Covina one is SO MUCH BIGGER and at my last visit, the staff are way cooler. They're upbeat, fun, and super duper attentive.  Right now, BJ's is having their Brewhouse specials: Mon: 1/2 off large deep dish or tavern-cut pizza Tue: 1/2 off wine (glass or if you'd like to go big - bottles too!) Wed: $4 BJ's Beers Thu: Baby back rib special!!! $13.95 for 1/2 rack or $18.95 full rack. Don't be silly here, def get the full!!! Comes with a house salad, 2 sides, and mini pizookie.  I went on a Thursday of course. Since these specials started, I've been to BJ's 3 times for the Thu special. It's a REALLY good deal because regularly, the 1/2 rack is about $18 and you don't get that extra salad or pizookie so it's a REALLY good idea to take advantage and the ribs are so omaagghh delicious.  I also like their BJ's favorite pizza - you really can't go wrong with that. I'm also a big fan of wings and I've ordered their bone-in wings each time I came for the rib special as an app and after 3 times (I was in doubt I guess), I can say that I don't think I really like them. I really can't pinpoint why.  So anyway, get your butts out here for their specials. They're REALLY good deals!!"
