Aneesha M R.,"Corona, CA",0,9,,1.0,1/8/2015,Horrible Customer service from the time we walked in. The young man at the front just looked at us. No greeting no smile. I had to ask if we could get a table. Then they girl that sat us did not say two words. She grabbed the menus and just looked at us. When we got to the table she put the menus down and just walked away.  Our server was nice once he finally again I say finally got to our table. I will get their names and edit my post. BJs needs to work on it customer service.
Sophia E.,"El Monte, CA",1,69,2,1.0,6/3/2014,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review on this BJ's. I love the food at BJ's their Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps are AMAZING!!! Love, love it! Okay let's be real, the service at this BJ's blows just like the name! COME ON! The service here absolutely sucks! you basically have to harass other servers to get some sort of attention! I don't get it!! I've gone to the Brea BJ's and all though it takes a while to get your food there, the service is good.... but Covina BJ's JEEEEEEZZZZZ!! It sort of feels like you're at a restaurant that just hires people that doesn't give a damn about the customers. Where are the managers? The training? The customer service? Someone needs to reevaluate this place, crack the whip...something! I refuse to ever go here again, that's it I've put my foot down, No More Covina BJ's. Plus seriously how difficult is it to make a good Bloody Mary...yuck! Highly do not recommend you order them."
Johnny Y.,"La Puente, CA",0,19,2,1.0,12/23/2013,"The service was absolutely the worst... So my friends and I showed up around 9:30 and they were not that packed, so we were seated fairly quickly and our drinks arrived shortly, and it is now at this point where I explain the downfall of the service. It took them 25 minutes to finally get to our table and take our orders, I ordered a double cheese burger, one friend ordered a side of wedge fries, and two of my friends split a regular bacon cheese burger. So I told them no pickles on my burger, so after taking about 35 minutes they brought me a single burger instead of a double, my friend a side of regular fries, and my friends a bleu cheese burger, so I sent mine back, and so did my friend with the fries, they brought him his wedges almost immediately, and I had to wait an extra 20 minutes, then they brought it back with pickles which of course I did not ask for, I asked for ranch which I never received, so finally I asked for the manager and complained, he apologized and said the burgers would be paid for, so when we finally got the check they charged us for a third burger which we never even ordered, they screwed up so many times I am never going there again, the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant..."
Conni F.,"Covina, CA",0,2,,1.0,12/31/2015,"Large Family . We go out allot. Never here again! This time 8 of us went we had two kids with us. One in a high chair. It was wed. dec .30  My birthday. They ruined it! we waited along time to be seated. then hostess called us. then they seemed pissed that we asked for ""High chair"" they said no not were we were going to seat you. go back and just stand there with the kids. and wait some more. Well wait we did!! Since it was now to late to pack up two cars and drive somewhere else. we were stuck there. They sat everyone else in place. they seated groups that came in way after us. It was like we were being punished for asking for high chair. finally after complaining enough!! They said possibly they could push two tables together for us.. Really ???? This took ten minutes for them to do. !!!! They were being terrible to us. I could understand if the kids were running around or crying. They were not. (we stood quiet and waited all of us till we finally complained) It was like they forgot us or we were in trouble. Then we had a terrible waiter!!He seemed ok when he was actually waiting on us. But he left us waiting to order or get ticket to pay forever. Worst service ever!! Ignored us most of the time. and chatted to other guests while we waited for service! All around this place ruined my birthday. Ruined everyones evening! Never will any of our friends and family go there again!!"
Stephanie L.,"Azusa, CA",0,3,,5.0,12/22/2013,I loooove this place! Food is always delicious and prompt! Waiters/waitresses are always nice and attentive! And to top it all off their pazookies are AMAZING! deff recommend! :)
Linh V.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/5/2013,"Love the pizookie and the food in general is delicious! Customer service is very nice, everyone smiles at you and is polite. Definitely worth the wait for the food!"
Jennifer C.,"West Covina, CA",2,10,4,1.0,6/16/2013,The service at the BJ's is horrible it took 2 hrs to get my food and my order was wrong. Once they corrected the order they never came back except to bring the bill. I like BJ's but this West Covina location is horrible and its always packed and disorganized with people standing around waiting to be seated and looking very annoyed. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
Steve L.,"Glendora, CA",422,58,5,3.0,1/20/2011,"The food here is awesome. The Clam Chowder in a loaf is the best!! Or Chili.  The Great White is probably one of the Best Pizzas in the UNIVERSE!! This place is a great place to eat and relax. Service sucks. This would explain the 3 stars! Servers have always been slow at this place...terribly slow.  Aside that, this place is great. Ohh ya, I forgot. Drinks are BEYOND OVERPRICED. Typically no price on the drink menu for good measure..to get your money."
Chan L.,"Las Vegas, NV",50,321,8,4.0,12/30/2012,"- Typical BJ's: good service, good food, reasonable prices."
Faith B.,"San Diego, CA",84,233,3,4.0,12/27/2010,"Great place to watch a game.  We were in town to do some shopping and we stopped off here for lunch. It was Sunday afternoon and packed! Huge football day. At least 4 football games going on. I thought it was a great vibe. Very fun and lively. The server was incredibly nice. We sat down right away, but the service was kind of slow (I'm sure because of the crowd). It was ok though since there was so much going on I didn't really notice the slow service... I should rephrase that... it didn't bother me too much because of all that was going on... but I sure noticed it.  Fun place to hang out and the food was great, so I definitely recommend it!"
Angelababe B.,"West Covina, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/12/2013,I'm in love with BJ's Cobb Salads!!  Delicious and comes in a huge portion too!!!
Jeremy B.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/27/2014,The service was terrible the last time I went there with my girlfriend. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks to the table alone. Not to mention that they ended up giving us the wrong food not once but twice. We ended up ordering some desert as well for take out. When we got back home we discovered that they again have us the wrong order. We will not be coming back anytime soon.
Jonah C.,"Azusa, CA",25,4,5,2.0,10/5/2014,"Soooooooooo like where to begin. I had just gotten off a long day at work and was excited to grab a bite to eat with my bf and a friend. Waited about 30 minutes for a table, typical on a Friday night. Our buzzer thing went off and I was so excited to finally get seated. So we go turn in the buzzer and they had us waiting for like 10 more minutes because they gave our table to SOMEONE ELSE. Wow. K so I got over it. FINALLY WE GOT SEATED, and ordered clam chowder..it was alright I suppose. The bus boys were cleaning up the table right next to ours and they dropped the tray of bowls and cups and ranch got all over my friends boots..I understand mistakes happen but wow like I literally had to ask for a rag to help clean the mess THEY made. Anyyyyyways so were finishing up our night at BJs and I had to use the restroom before heading out and oh my word...the men's restroom was atrocious. Paper towels all on the floor, over flooding the bins and water everywhere. Usually my visits at BJs are good but that night was just terrible. I usually don't like pizookies either but I'll admit I enjoyed it 100%. Pros: the soup was okay, ran in to an old friend, server was nice Cons: everything I mentioned lol"
Jorge M.,"Covina, CA",373,176,129,4.0,9/14/2010,"Want to eat like a man!?  Then come to BJ's for a delicious Sweet Pig Pizza and a Pint of Blonde (lighter beer.)  OK, well... Maybe that doesn't sound very manly a ""sweet"" pig pizza and a light beer.  However, they do have different types of pizzas (and different entrées) and they also serve darker beers. If you are into pasta I really enjoy the Grilled Chicken Pasta.  The combination of the chicken, sauce, and the broccoli is outstanding.  If you are one of those people who watch their calorie in-take then I'd skip it.  This is high in calorie and high in deliciousness! The prices for their lunch specials are fantastic and are very filling.  I tend to order the half sandwich and half salad which also comes with fries (I prefer the wedge cut fries.)   That isn't the best part.  After eating you can order a Pizookie!  It's basically a huge warm delicious cookie topped with vanilla ice cream!  The two main food groups I enjoyed while being a kid cookies, and ice cream!  Yum! BJ's is a step up from Chilie's and TGIF in regards to food.  Their service is pretty friendly at the West Covina location.  There have been times when they took awhile to bring our food out but it's a hit or miss for me sometimes, but what chain restaurant is 100% perfect right?"
Oliver H.,"Irvine, CA",42,10,,1.0,1/19/2012,"This place has the worst service.... Came here on a thursday night, and was told that I would wait 10 to 15 minutes. More than 30 minutes has passed, and I decided to go ask the hostess what was taking so long. First thing the hostess says is we called you why weren't you here. Then in her bitchy attitude she expresses to me that probably the paging system is broken. Without ever apologizing for the extremely long wait, she starts to question that i wasn't in the room waiting, and that it is entirely my fault that. Then we are lead to a table, then again the second hostess realizes that the table wasn't even cleaned. Then another 10 minute wait, until I express my dissatisfaction to the first hostess, and she starts blaming me again for the wait.   The food here is nothing spectacular, rather overpriced affair. I would much prefer yardhouse, lazy dog, cheese cake or other similar institutions. Bj's serioulsy needs to improve their service. Antoher time i went to a Bj's I waited nearly 2 hrs. for a chicago style pizza. Seems like no one is in charge in the restaurant."
Javier El Feo ..,"Pasadena, CA",6,233,,4.0,11/13/2012,I have only eaten lunch here. You cannot go wrong. Avocado rolls are legit. Sneak in a red and I am set. Service has always been good.
Brittany M.,"Claremont, CA",27,2,,4.0,8/18/2014,"I came here with a friend on 08/17 to have dinner. We called ahead of time to put our name on the list. We arrived about 15 mins later and only had to wait about 5 mins to be seated. This BJ's is pretty busy on a Sunday night. Our server was so friendly and managed to keep his composure with it being so busy. He did a really great job. My only complaint was that my order was a tad wrong. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and received the Buffalo Chicken pizza. No biggie. Also, their beer is so good. My friend wanted to order a Snakebite with the berry blast instead of Pear. Our waiter said no problem and made the switch. Turned out to be the best fruity beer ever haha I tried the Magic Hat #9. Really great light and flavorful beer. Besides that, I do want to make mention that the table next to us was so rude to the staff here and made a huge  ordeal about nothing. After the customers being there for about 15 mins, complained to the manager about how they had been there for a half hour and that the service was horrible. Pretty much telling the manager they wont be coming back anymore because they have had to wait a long time the last time they were there. The manager apologized plus totally took care of their meals and drinks. I have to say that these customers were so rude that after the manager told them it would be free, they had the audacity to order a free dessert as well. My friend and I assumed that those customers wouldn't leave a tip so we tipped for them and left a note to the server saying good luck and that he had been doing a great job :)"
Darlene G.,"Bell Gardens, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/10/2014,worst experience eveeeer!!! went in with my family waited for 2 hours to be seated while they sat everyone else but us until we finally got up and asked what was going on just to hear that we were going to have to wait another 40 minutes. they didnt bother to offer water atleast while waiting they just totally put us aside felt discriminated.  we spoke to the manager she didnt do absolutely anything about it. ended up leaving to chilis our wait there was only 7 minutes.
Blossom F.,"West Covina, CA",0,9,,2.0,8/13/2014,"Came here for lunch yesterday. Waiting to be seated we stood there for a good 5 min in front of a thin, long haired female with glasses who was on the phone and never even said hello, or give me a minute, she looked down to the side and to the back and never made eye contact.  Finally a different woman came and asked if we had been helped and proceeded to seat us. The waitress was professional and food was good. As we were leaving I asked about the BJ's Premiere rewards card at the front desk and the young gentleman was looking for one, he asked a lady in a royal blue shirt and she said they were in the office, before he got back they handed me one to fill out. I stood there listening to the lady in the royal blue shirt having a conversation with another coworker, even though she noticed that I was done and waiting to give back the completed rewards card she ignored me and not until I said did you want this back? She very phony replied ""oh yes of course, thank you"".Host/es need to work on customer service."
S H.,"Stanton, CA",1,82,,1.0,8/11/2014,Here for lunch. Restaurant is more than half empty... still a 20 minute wait. Oh the efficiency
