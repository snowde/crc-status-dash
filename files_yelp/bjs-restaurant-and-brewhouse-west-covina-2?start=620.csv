Soo K.,"West Covina, CA",3,23,2,4.0,9/12/2010,"Food has always been good. Deep dish pizza*, jambalaya, turkey club sandwich-yum! Good price for the large portions. Finally got to experience my first ""Pizookie"".  Warm cookie topped with ice cream.  Like usual, filled up on the food, but still took leftovers home so we could split the smaller portioned one. Remember it's a great hang out for gameday- any game, and it gets very loud. I was there when Mexico was in the World Cup.  *I have to add, I grew up on Chicago's deep dish pizza which does not exist in SGV."
Mimi A.,"West Covina, CA",0,11,,2.0,11/2/2014,"We were there Saturday, November 1st at about 7:30pm. The wait was 20 min. Which was not bad. Our waiter had great customer service skills. The food was good. However, the table was dirty and one of our forks was dirty 2! Yuk!"
Jamie M.,"Riverside, CA",5,27,3,2.0,2/19/2013,"I gave two stars because not every experience here as been bad up until recently. We only had a party of six but our waiter had a difficult time checking on us and bringing us what we asked for. We came here on a Sunday around 3pm. We didn't think that would be a busy time being in between meals but we were very disappointed in the service and the food. The fish and chips were over cooked. The pizza was OK. My daughter got macaroni and cheese and when they brought it it was cold. After we waited a long time to have it warmed, it didn't taste good. I've always loved their Pizookie's but that doesn't make the $100 we spent worth the visit since the food and service was so crappy."
Joe U.,"Newport Beach, CA",75,190,22,3.0,1/19/2010,"I hadn't been to a BJ's in years, but I had good memories. Maybe it was just the late night pazookie runs that I always seem to think about. This particular location is out of my hood, but impressed me nonetheless.  Really large space -- great for groups.  I only went here because my Yowza app said I could get $5 off $20 or more, but then came to find out that it was only valid on online orders. After speaking with the waitress, she graciously had the manager honor it in-store. The new menu's have a killer lunch special. $5.95 for a half sandwich with fries and salad, along with countless other options.  I really didn't expect such a deal. And it was good too!  Great service and things were clean -- all I need for a chain restaurant."
Dania S.,"Irvine, CA",345,82,24,3.0,8/15/2012,Good location. Typical BJ's food but they have a very nice out door patio so you can enjoy the ambiance.
Corrie N.,"Glendora, CA",93,14,3,1.0,6/2/2014,"I feel bad writing a negative review on one of my favorite restaurants. Last night I went with a party of 6 we went and sat in the bar area because it didn't seem too crowded. We started out with one waiter who was attentive and got our orders quickly, drinks served quickly, it was going pretty good! He came up to us about 15 minutes in and said since it was a slow they were sending him home. No problem, waiters get switched all the time for no reason. Our new waitress came to our table about 2 times and after 40 minutes of waiting with out receiving our food I finally asked. If our original waiter got sent home early for it being slow, it shouldn't have taken so long for our food. Our food ended up coming out right after I asked, but 3 of the 6 orders were messed up. It was really disappointing. Normally BJs service is great! Last night was just a let down. Not sure we will be back to that location. Hopefully they can get back on track."
Elaina G.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,16,7,1.0,5/31/2014,"Just left this location about an hour ago and the experience I had was just awful, left angry and unsatisfied! Waited 15 minutes to be seated, which I didn't mind, it was when we met our waiter JULIO is when everything went downhill. He kept rushing us to order, not everyone knows what they want right when they're seated! Sheesh!  We ended up just ordering a deep dish pepperoni pizza to share, it was awful, looked like everything was just thrown on to it and it wasn't even cooked all the way! Me and my BF only ate one slice each, it was not appetizing at all! And to top it off not once did we ever get a refill on our drinks the entire time! Julio comes back and asks if we want desert, I tell him I want to use my rewards points to get a pizookie and that I also wanted to order a baked beignet. He comes back to tell me that I cannot use my points on the beignet but I can get 5 dollars off, I tell him I never wanted to use my points for that, only on the pizookie and he keeps calling the damn pizookie a beignet and saying the points are not for that! I continue to tell him the points are for the PIZOOKIE and the beignet is just being added to the bill AND HE STILL DIDN'T UNDERSTAND! I have never had a problem using my points before until I met JULIO! Even after all that we still only ended up with the the baked beignet and it was just DISGUSTING! It wasn't cooked in the inside, was completely doughy and raw! Ended up only eating the ice cream which was the only decent thing I had. I feel like I wasted my time and money here tonight all thanks to JULIO and his inability to understand simple words!"
Vicky T.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,336,127,5.0,7/31/2010,"I LOVE BJ's!!!!! You gotta try their shrimp scampi. One time, my professor asked what food would I want to eat as my last meal living, and I said the shrimp scampi! ahhhhhh I WANT SOME!"
GEO S.,"San Pedro, CA",12,21,,4.0,2/4/2010,"The time i went with my cousin and his girl was one of the chillest times. it was 4 of us, and we all ordered the beer taster sampler, where you get 10 lil beers for about 10 bucks i think, we were drinking a little bit before so that kind of helped. The server was cool (better than the snotty tricks @ tgif's) we got our drinks in 5 mins, and the crowd was cool too. No one was there to do anything other than what they came to do. the bathrooms were clean, the food was cool and i cant really think of anything i would complain about."
Jeanne G.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,7,6,1.0,12/9/2013,"All BJ restaurants are not created equal.  This was my first, and definitely last, visit to BJs in West Covina.  They have won the recognition of providing the worst service I have ever had (I am 56 yrs).  I placed an order at 4:30 pm - well before any type of crowd arrived.  The other people received their food, I asked for mine from server  2 who stated she would check on it.  Mean time, another table ordered and received their food from Our original waitress.  I stated I was still waiting for my salad, she said she would bring it immediately (my third request).  Twenty minutes later, no food.  In frustration, I spoke to manager Brian who said he would take care of it right away.  instead, he sent yet another server to ""take my order"" (note: it has now been over one hour since placing my original order).  Magic, after pleading five times to four different people, I finally received my salad at 6pm.  Not bad 1 1/2 hour wait filled with all kinds of frustration and aggravation.  I left feeling horribly upset and got the honor of paying $45 for the experience.  DO NOT go here!  Drive the extra distance to BJs in City of Industry...there the service is as good as West Covina's is bad!"
Bom S.,"Diamond Bar, CA",20,9,,1.0,9/23/2009,"Have you ever stop by a gas station where you already know the bathroom is going to be disgusting and nasty but you really have to go so you just suck it up and go anyway.. then you feel pissed afterward?  That's exactly how I feel about West Covina BJ's. I've been here before and the service was soooo bad. It doesn't matter if you're at the bar or the table. The servers are the worst of all. They even talk back to you.. may be i should've start my every sentences with ""BRO.."" so they can do their job right. They really don't give a crap. I had to drag my ass over there cus it was my good friend's birthday joint (It seems like everyone loves to go there for their birthday).  I think if i have to go back there again is to use their clean bathroom.. at least it's reliable not like the shitty ass servers."
Kristyn A.,"Lake Forest, CA",0,24,,4.0,6/23/2013,"Their food is delicious (pizooki, anyone?) but their cocktails are awful."
Shelley C.,"Los Angeles, CA",569,287,17,4.0,6/7/2010,came here for company luncheon.. not a good idea for diet food.. I started with thai shrimp wrap ... then a garden medley salad... all healthy and good for my diet then   the TRIO pizzzzzooookiii came... there goes my diet.. i finished all 3 =( it was sooo good
Vanessa A.,"Escondido, CA",0,16,5,4.0,8/11/2014,"The best unlimited soup and salad for lunch.  Inexpensive, and tasty.  Good customer service, attentive and friendly."
Monique M.,"Los Angeles, CA",196,182,12,1.0,9/8/2009,Yes-its a chain Yes-it has standards that are guided by the health department Yes-I should always get beer and pizza it will be like pulling teeth for me to come back to this location... i found a nice strand of blonde hair in my salad... yes a hair.. i'm asian and not dyed blonde.. it was not mine..  yes thats what i get for not getting beer and pizza... fail me.. but bigger fail kitchen @ bjs.
Carlos F.,"Norwalk, CA",92,153,46,2.0,6/8/2010,"Honestly, great food, great beer, great environment, lots of tv screens. its just that theyve got this ""service culture"" if you will.... theyre in a hurry, sort of like their ass is itching, to get you out. i know some people are into that but Im not. Ive been here twice and both times its happened. After this laker series is over. Im finding a new place to watch the games."
Ken T.,"Brea, CA",51,16,5,3.0,12/3/2011,"I like this restaurant, but the last time I visited, the server had pure attitude. Thank goodness she went on break and was replaced.  three stars only because the breaking server treated us kindly. P,S,  LOOSE THE ATTITUDE.  With out customers, you make no money...."
Phillip V.,"Santa Ana, CA",167,44,10,5.0,10/18/2009,"First time eating for a friend's birthday. They kept giving us samples and drinks but who doesn't like free stuff anyway? Waiters were extremely polite. I got to try different items on the menu, and all of them were delicious. Price is similar to that of TGIF, but the food is way better. You can expect there to be a wait if you come in the evening or at night."
Max G.,"Dallas, TX",67,69,4,5.0,8/15/2009,"This is our favorite BJ's in the land. Happy Hour here is the best in town. The food, the beer, and the ambiance is awesome. This is the former home of Safari Bar back in the days. Which in the 90's it was the place to go, especially on Thursday's to Voodoo Lounge being the best. BJ's has taken it to another level and kept that vibe alive. I know first-hand that it is the place to hang out on minimum days, so if you want to know where your child's teacher is at, you now know where. There is not one dish that will disappoint. The avocado rolls are a must as the Piranha Ale beer. Portions are big enough to be shared.  Only con is that if you are looking for a quiet place, go somewhere else. The biggest con is the parking. It is very limited."
Stephanie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,87,6,2.0,9/3/2013,"Take out experience. Unfortunately they cut off the cub side service at some point and you are left driving halfway to Wal-Mart to find a spot because there is no parking anywhere!   Once you are  in  the restaurant you are  left standing at the counter feeling stupid while the servers hang around the take out booth talking about how their boyfriends are texting other girls and other non work place gossip. I don't care about what they are doing at the club and they shouldn't be  workplace social hour while customers stand around unacknowledged and frustrated. Really inappropriate, very unprofessional, extremely uncomfortable. The food was lackluster at best after the long wait. Appetizer was potato skins and they were fried beyond recognition  and we didn't eat them. My salad was okay-but its hard to mess up lettuce.  No so for my husband's entree. He ended up eating cereal.  His roast beef dip sandwich was a soggy, mushy mess.  From the fries to the bread all mush. I tried to save the fries in the oven but they came out greasy.  This was our LAST unpleasant experience at this place."
