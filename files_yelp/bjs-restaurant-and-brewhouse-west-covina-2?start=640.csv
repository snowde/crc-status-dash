Fonda K.,"Rosemead, CA",60,248,55,4.0,3/29/2012,Service is slow so don't come here when you're starving. Chicken wings and Pizookie are delicious! I come here when I crave pizookies..
Nicholas B.,"Pomona, CA",101,233,38,2.0,3/3/2010,"Went to this BJ's last night with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday on a tuesday.  Reservations were made early in the day for 7pm, friends arrive there at 6pm to make sure everything is ready by 7. We were not seated till 7:45pm but that was only because we had to speak to a manager. We were a group of 12 and they decided to crowed us together using 2 tables so we had to snag another unused table. It took another 20min from when we were seated to have our orders taken and another 45min to get out meals. I ordered the ANGEL HAIR TOSCANA Our delicate angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, fire-roasted red peppers, fresh basil, feta cheese, pine nuts, Roma tomatoes and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley. When I finally received my meal it didnt have any garlic, red pepper, pine nuts, parmesan cheese or parsley. Because it had been sitting so long the olive oil pooled to the bottom of the plate, so when i took my first bite the pasta was dry. I also asked my friends and most of them werent satisfied with their meals either. I dont see myself going to this BJ's again."
Ray P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,4,,2.0,6/12/2014,Usually have a great experience here! But today it would've been nice to know when we first came in that the systems were down for a bit. We've been sitting here for 55 minutes with no food and empty glasses. Very disappointed in the fact that if we were on our lunch break we'd have left without food. Customer service very poor and tables have walked out all around us.
Jocey K.,"Monrovia, CA",49,428,,3.0,3/18/2012,My only complaint is once I came here for curbside and called in like 3 times for my order and no one came out. This was a hot and in the middle of the day too so I wasn't happy. Finally I got out of my car and went in. The hostess acted all surprised and kept apologizing and making excuses but they weren't that crowded in there/outside in the parking lot. Idk I'd come back here but their curbside needs to get it together! The SF rolls are really good!
Jena R.,"North Hollywood, CA",70,75,4,1.0,11/1/2011,over it. done. finito. this place should be blown up. chips and salsa never came. mini pizzas room temperature. no refills- walked to the bar to ask bartender to refill my damn pepsi because our damn waiter was m.i.a. pissed.
Steph Y.,"Columbia, SC",0,14,1,2.0,12/30/2012,"I like BJ's in general, but this was not the best one I've been to. Food: The food is good, as is typical of the chain.  Service: The first time I was there, everything was run of the mill and relatively decent. The second time I was there, it seemed really disorganized. They served us someone else's salads; we accepted out of confusion because we had ordered some fancy salads. Then they tried to serve us someone else's salads again. When we indicated we already had salads, they went to the next two tables to my left and asked if they ordered salads. The salads were not theirs either. Then, when we had pretty much stopped eating, before they asked us if we needed anything else, someone came and stacked our plates on each other and walked away with food we intended to box up."
Bill E.,"West Covina, CA",11,34,,1.0,4/15/2009,"The only reason I am giving BJ's ONE STAR is because I couldn't leave ZERO STARS. I will NEVER spend my money in this dump ever again, and I don't miss an opportunity to tell anyone who will listen.  I went there with my family one evening, and we were seated by the front door. As soon as we sat down, I smelled CIGARETTE SMOKE billowing in from the ""smoking area"" AKA ""right outside the front door"". Some genius decided that ASHTRAYS right by the front door were a good idea, and the smokers take advantage of them IN A BIG WAY.  I summoned the MANAGER and voiced my displeasure with BREATHING CIGARETTE SMOKE with my meal, and asked him if there was anything he could do.  I was floored when he simply said ""NO"". He flatly refused to do ANYTHING about it, and basically told me that the smokers had a right to smoke.  I have never heard of a restaurant manager taking this position on ANY complaint by a paying customer. But I will tell you this...  I WILL NEVER SPEND MY MONEY in this place EVER AGAIN.  The food ain't bad, but you had better enjoy CIGARETTE SMOKE with your meal.  SKIP B.J.'s... TGI Fridays is just across the lot, and APPLE BEE'S is just down the freeway.  NON SMOKERS UNITE."
Leo P.,"San Diego, CA",66,52,92,5.0,7/21/2009,"Everyone remember their first BJ's and this was mine, so this particular location is special to me. The 1st time I went here was about 8 years ago, and I fell in love with their their beer. I love the Piranha Pale Ale, Jeremiah Red, PM Porter, Tatonka Stout, Nutty Brewnette, and their seasonal Nit Wit. I also love their Chicago style pizza, especially the BJ's Favorite, Mediterranean, Great White, Buffalo Chicken, and Spinach & Artichoke. If you're looking for an entree, try the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, which is my favorite dish. Pizookie and beer is good, but make sure you're drinking the Porter, Stout, or the Brewnette. PRO: Their draft beer, deep dish pizza, extensive menu. CON: Always packed regardless of where I go (LA, OC, or IE)."
Andy P.,"Walnut, CA",40,19,1,2.0,5/23/2013,"came here multiple times, every time service is really slow. the food is always mediocre. also whats the point of putting those sticks that say medium, rare, etc. into the burger when u get it well done every time? last time i came here they left the paper separating the burger patties on the burger and served it to my friend. he didn't notice till halfway into his burger lol. he told our server and she apologized and asked if he wanted another one...yeah right...they offered a refund and a free appetizer..we got mozzarella sticks..and those were terrible (wow wat a surprise)... would be a 1 star if it wasn't for the manager trying to make it up to us about our friend eating burger paper.  seriously tho, as a cook, placing the burger on the grill, cooking it, how do u not see the paper on the burger? ridiculous. this place is bad."
Enrico G.,"Azusa, CA",15,57,2,5.0,2/27/2012,Great placr to hang out and chill abd eat
Dawn M.,"West Covina, CA",1,2,,1.0,6/13/2014,"On Monday June 9th 2014 we had the worst experience here...of all the times we've been here.  We had a large party and we called earlier in the day to make reservations.  I spoke to the manager to make sure they would be able to accomodate a party of 20.  The manager told me that there would not be a problem and he'd be happy to accomodate us.  When our party arrived (before our reservation time) we had to wait for over a half an hour for our ""reserved"" table.  At that, we had to complain to the host/hostess.  We asked why was our table not ready at the time of our reservation.  We were told that our table was given away to another large party.  The host then said he would get the manager.  When the manager came out, she totally ignored us and took an order for another party.  We were finally seated, drink orders taken.  Drinks arrive 15 minutes later. The waiter finally takes our food order.  All our food comes out at different times, some items not brought out at all and some items brought out were cold!  We ask to have the hot entrees (that were cold) replaced, we ended up being charged twice for these items, and for the items that never came out.  To top off the night, we were told we could not order dessert because they were closing and given our check!!  Isn't it customary to advise the customer that the kitchen will be closing and ask if there is anything else they would like to order before the kitchen closes???     Never coming back"
Marissa M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,1,,1.0,6/12/2014,"Been sitting here for 40 minutes at the bar, and we haven't even gotten water. -_- worst service."
Alemayehu S.,"Pomona, CA",3,6,,5.0,4/29/2012,"Went there yesterday, on the 29th April The food took a while to get to use because it was so busy, but the customer service here was exceptional. I mean, we had three different waitresses and they were nearly stumbling over themselves to make my mother and I as happy as possible! I commented to the manager that she had an wonderful staff and thanked her as she gave us our dessert and one of our entrees free  because of our wait. Really worth going to this place if anyone has a chance, same menu as all the other BJ's but great crew working at that place!"
Janice S.,"Ontario, CA",0,27,,5.0,5/22/2014,"This BJ's rocks! Everything from management, servers, to the food! We go in for lunch and always have a great experience. Highly recommend this restaurant. :)"
Dipy G.,"Rosemead, CA",11,41,7,5.0,2/12/2012,"This BJ is awesome, a few months ago we left our boxed leftover foods and came back a few minutes later only to find out that they've been thrown out, but they offered to make a new one, not half but a whole new order, how can I refuse that ? Will definately be back again, as a matter of fact, we're in here right now :)"
Paul S.,"Covina, CA",5,9,13,4.0,7/11/2011,Been a regular at BJ's West Covina since they opened about 14 yrs ago...Always consistant service and food. I am a home brewer for 25 years and really enjoy the craft.... sad to see the brewery is downsizing and contracting out but always a supporter of the BJ's beer line up. A brewery restaurant done right for sure!
Alejandra P.,"Rowland Heights, CA",31,106,6,4.0,9/9/2011,"Just here today for lunch with friends. The waiter was very friendly, but our drinks took too long. It's a good thing we ordered drinks and food together, as the food came soon after the drinks. As always, the Blonde is crisp and refreshing. I had an ahi tuna salad which was BOMBBBBBBBBBB. My friends ordered the thin fries which I did not have because I was already indulging with the beer, but I have had them before and they are scrumptious. BJ's is always reliable."
Jo P.,"La Puente, CA",35,36,5,4.0,3/19/2009,"I've had no complaints about this place in my book, if its busy hey you wait, there's nothing the workers can do to speed up people eating..with no negative repercussions of course.. The beer is AWESOME, i've tried them all and i'm a fan of the tanaka stout and the blonde ale, really good. The pizza is thick crusted, so prepare to hear a crunch when you reach the end, it's deep dish style from the looks of it.   Pizookie is pretty damned good, really cool to just show up have a small pizza and a pizookie with your loved one :) Overall, nice place to go, try to avoid it during sport seasons as it will get really loud and packed!"
Liz H.,"Orange, CA",38,19,12,4.0,9/22/2011,"You can never go wrong with BJ's, pastas, fish n chips, teriyaki, the burgers, the Beer! Not to mention the pazookies. One of my favorite places to come to. I love the dark lighting, the atmosphere is nice here."
Mark F.,"West Linn, OR",71,3,,2.0,7/26/2012,"Called ahead let them know we had a party of 14. Waited about 10 minutes for our table once we checked in. They stuffed us into the back of the restaurant between 3 other tables. The servers could not even get between our tables and we kept getting bumped. Server saw large party and thought - ""automatic tip.""  Service was horrible. Had to go to the bar to get water since she was MIA.   Food finally showed up - steak was CRAP - way overcooked and barley warm. Messed up salad, crappy appetizers, and 3 other orders were made incorrectly. Asked to speak to manager, he was lightweight apologetic, ""comped"" us one appetizer, and got new server. Was too late by then. Folks i brought to dinner were pissed and had a not so good time as you can imagine. Been here abut 10 times before - will not be coming back."
