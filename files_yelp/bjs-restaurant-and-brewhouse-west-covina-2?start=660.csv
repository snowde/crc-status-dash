DeAnn O.,"Brea, CA",4,42,11,5.0,10/21/2011,Felicia u rock! What a great personality...what a pleasure it was to have you as a server
Gary O.,"Ontario, CA",1,99,53,5.0,5/31/2013,"""Adi is the BOMB! She's the best server I've ever had! She has a great smile and is very attentive! Sam the manager is also great too!"""
April T.,"Los Angeles, CA",175,13,18,1.0,10/14/2013,"Came here for lunch today, 10/14/13 during my 1-hour lunch break (12:30-1:30). Arrived at 12:50, sat at happy hour booth and placed order at 12:51pm with server Adam S. Ordered 2 waters and 2 BBQ Lunch Platters for husband and myself. Took at least 10-15 mins to receive the water. After 25mins from ordering the food, we waved our server to follow-up on our order since I have to go back to work soon. Adam finally brought our order out at least 25 mins from ordering. He came back so quickly, our food must have just been sitting on the counter waiting to be picked up. And what's worse is the place wasn't even packed! They can at least make an effort for those that eat here during their lunch break and have to be back within 30mins - 1 hour. I just devoured and almost choked on my pulled pork slider and had to take my fries to go. Although the slider was good, the bad service left a bad taste in my mouth. I will never come back here during my lunch break. Will call Managing Director - Jessica Simmons to file a formal complaint."
Joel J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",17,163,151,3.0,6/25/2009,Of all the BJ's chain restaurants that exist.  This is my favorite location.  Food is ok. There's nothing I stick to.  But it's their beer that's wonderful. Anything from the Tatonka Stout to the PM Porter.  Magnificent!
Terry J.,"West Covina, CA",125,105,4,5.0,8/18/2009,"I love this BJ's, its literally walking distance from my house. Every single time I have been the workers are always very cordial. With a nice little variety of brewed beer, and good food always makes for a good time whther its a  date or with friends. For me the best dish is the Cajun Shrimp Pasta, which is the one of the best dishes ever.  Also if your a sports fan its another plus cause obviously they have tv's everuywhere showcasing games of whatever sport. I just go for the beer (Jeriamiah Red to be specific) and pasta"
Ray A.,"Azusa, CA",12,2,1,4.0,3/12/2012,"Went to BJ's in West Covina, last Wednesday with my sister and her friend. I love their avocado egg rolls, they never disappoint. I ordered the rib eye steak with the baked potato, the steak was good and cooked to my what I had ordered, but the potato was huge! The potato took almost the whole plate, lol! My sister ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, and her friend ordered the ahi salad. The pizza was good, but too much crest for my taste, and the ahi salad was great. The server was very good and we actually had two staff members attending us, but we all know why we go there...the pizookies!! We got the red velvet and it was delish!  All in all it was a good and fun dinner that night :)"
Ken C.,"San Dimas, CA",2,8,,1.0,12/24/2013,"We had dinner, bought gift cards and two growlers of beer. Three days later one growler was flat. I called the manager and got a rude, unhelpful guy that said tough, we don't guarantee growlers over 48 hours. We buy growlers from a lot of brew pubs and have never had a problem. This manager would sacrifice regular customers over a couple bucks of beer. Never go to this restaurant because if the manager won't stand behind one small item then I don't trust them."
Craig L.,"Azusa, CA",281,170,29,3.0,9/12/2011,"it's a typical B.J.'s noting spectacular. It dosen't make your eyes roll back in you head like a great B.J.! It was good, you can't beat the 2 for $20 special they have. The service is good, and  the drinks are aaaaigght. It's fun to people watch, and see the people that areon their first date"
Ron L.,"Covina, CA",4989,1343,5039,3.0,11/26/2008,BJ's has awesome Pazookie.       After the appetizers..we make an attempt to save room for that Pazookie...that's the size of a dinner plate...Totally awesome.   This place is more for younger crowd...and it's definitly a beer joint...   There is ample parking in the Eastland shopping center and you will have a good time here.     I always come here for that awesome Pazookie.... Ya Gotta try it.... Really...you do... Cons: The lomg wait to get a seat.             The long wait to get your food.             The high noise level
Sienna M.,"Torrance, CA",0,3,,1.0,2/12/2012,"My husband and I had the Santa Fe salad with salmon. I will never eat here again. I ordered my Salad to go and the girl who brought out my order was rude, she was bothered when I asked her for plates and utensils. The salad gave me an upset  stomach that lasted for hours. My husband ended up with really bad stomach cramps. Maybe someone forgot to wash their hands. One star for good parking."
Amanda U.,"Covina, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/25/2014,Worst service I've ever experienced. And I am usually the one with patience that tries to be understanding to the servers and staff when everyone else at the table is pissed already. It had been a four year stretch since the last time I was even in this restaraunt because I remembered being annoyed last time. And this was by far worse. I won't be back. Not even for a pazookie.
Patrick A.,"Covina, CA",6,153,2,3.0,8/22/2011,Three stars for this particular chain. Five Stars for the company in general. The food is always hot and is always good. The service however is rather inconsistent. I've come here many times and it's usually a gamble. I've been asked to sit under an A/C and denied the opportunity to move when it was freezing. I've been given a free appetizer for a long wait by a manager. Oh and my favorite is when you get a prick waiter who warms up at the end when its time to tip. I personally believe tips are for those who deliver exceptional service typically for a large group. I've ordered over the internet a few times and it's worked out well for me. I recommend the spinach artichoke dip and the pizza which is amazing.
Anne M.,"San Dimas, CA",58,83,117,5.0,7/9/2011,"I put 5stars, because the service has improved immensly. I used  to know that if I went to Bj's, at this location, I would have to  be prepared for either slow or bad service.  I had an issue on June 10, 2011(night), but I'm so happy that the matter were resolved right away. The manager was so nice. Eventhough the place was really crowded I had an awesome experiance in the end and the food was amazing. The service has improved."
Wesley V.,"West Covina, CA",61,192,66,5.0,5/26/2013,The Cajun chicken pasta was delish. Love their bruschetta too.
Tina-Marie L.,"La Mirada, CA",592,586,357,3.0,4/17/2009,"Maybe I'm okay with BJ's because I always go into a BJ's knowing that it's going to be some sort of clusterf*ck.  More times than not, at least for moi, it's been better than worse.  Hence, the 3 stars.  There have been ""those"" times. Tonight the wait was about 15 minutes.  I can't believe the amount of people that just kept coming.  What recession? We decided to have a pitcher of Jerry Burst which is Jeremiah Red with Raspberry Cider.  YUMMY!  We started with a Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage appetizer pizza.  I usually order that pizza for my meal it is so good.   Since we started with the pizza I decided to try something new.  I tried their Angel Hair Toscana with grilled chicken.  OMG!  This was delish.  It had sun-dried tomatoes, peppers, feta cheese, pine nuts, Roma tomatoes, and fresh basil. My husband is always craving fish and chips so I told him he needed to just order the freakin' things already.  He did and he was glad he did.  He said that the batter was very good. Overall, this experience was pleasant.  Not too long of a wait, and the food was good."
Michael G.,"Long Beach, CA",475,689,1448,1.0,8/25/2010,"my food was decent but not decent enough to get a good review out of me. i went last wednesday for my sister's birthday and had such an awful experience i wont be returning to this location ever. my sister made a large reservation and we had the entire party there on time, but we had to wait almost an hour to be seated even with the reservation because the restaurant double booked. once we were finally seated our main server in a very condescending voice informed us that if we were to order drinks from the bar we would not be allowed to consume anymore alcoholic beverages while at bj's - all drinks had to be ordered through her. this waitress was younger than i am and had no need to talk down to me and my table. once the food finally came out to us part of my meal was missing and i didn't receive a refill on my drink once. we all felt that the staff felt that since they knew they had a guaranteed tip that they didn't have to try at all. lastly my sister didn't get her free birthday pizookie and that's probably the worst part. why else would someone have their birthday at bj's?!? i have been here several times before and hadn't had an awful experience although i can also say i've never had an especially good one either. if bj's can't handle a large party like this then this should've been communicated before we all wasted are money on an overall awful experience."
Dr. Groovy O.,"Los Angeles, CA",318,202,26,3.0,7/31/2008,"Hmm... Bj's I like there pizza with only Romen Tomatoes! Yummi in my tummy! I love this place but sometimes, it just gets really really packed! Very hard to get a drink. You get your good waiters/bartenders, and your bad. Some remember you order your Delirium. Others come back about 20 minutes later when you've already gotten 2 from the bar because they took so damn long. I'm really not into there own brewed stuff but they have other choices that are great. There apps. are also great. We got really wasted here once after a quick trip to the canyons. We were already wasted when we got there so the partying continued! We had a pitcher each every round. It was horrible.  : o   But very fun.  ; ^ D"
Jon R.,"West Covina, CA",24,74,164,2.0,10/13/2008,"I've been her several times but the last visit was just terrible.  It was my friend's birthday party and due to the number of guests we had our food buffet style.   First of all, I've never been fond of their pizza, I'm not saying its terrible but its definitely not great either.  I don't mind chicago style pizza or deep dish but BJ's pizzas are pretty bland.  They need to have more variety like CPK.  So we had four different types of pizzas but the problem was they were slow to bring them out and when they did, only four at a time and because of our large numbers, half the group was eating while the rest was waiting for more pizza to come out.  The alfredo pasta was worse than something you could have eaten from a microwave dinner of the same thing.  Really tasteless and for me, I my pasta had lots of pasta that was stuck together and slighty harder than it should have been.  The pizookie was fine, there's not too many ways you can ruin a desert as simple as that. Service was also really bad.  There's really no excuse... if they're under staffed then that's just bad management.  Drinks took forever to come out.  I was sitting down and eating for almost 20 minutes before my drink finally came.  Didn't even bother to ask for ranch sauce or hot sauce for the pizzas cos I knew it would take forever. It's a shame cos it was fun hanging out with friends for a birthday party but its too bad it took place on a night when BJs dropped the ball."
Lili M.,"Pasadena, CA",0,59,44,1.0,9/9/2013,"I have given this BJs wayy too many chances and too much of my time and money, enough! I have never been happy with their service yet I kept a hopeful thought about them thinking maybe they'd change. False. Last time I went, I invited my best friend for a quick drink and maybe some food if we felt like it. We were seated in a table for 4. I dont understand why they'd place us in a massive table in the middle of the floor when there were smaller ones around and empty small booths for two people. Anyway our first server, first server. . . , greeted us and was nice. She got our drinks out promptly. Then later brought another server explained to us that she had other things to do and that the woman next to her would be our new server. We looked at her and the woman just stood there with theeee most unfriendliest place..almost rolling her eyes..!!! Me and my friend were like omg did you just see that?! Anyway so this woman was our new server and said hi and walked away not asking us if we needed anything..which we did!! we were ready to order food. It took her, i timed it!! , 20 minutes to walk by..not to check on us..but walk by, when we caught her attention and was like yes?? i asked if i could order a pasta dish and she said yes. another 20 mins later she brings out my pasta scampi which was 1, burnt from the top..im talking about BLACK breadcrumbs and cheese soo burnt it was brown and all stuck together, fine. I let that slip by and totally peeled off the top burnt layer. When i started eating my food i noticed the ""angel hair"" pasta was all cut up!! Now if you know anything about pasta you know theyre long strands like spaghetti. This was mushy choppy 3 inch pieces of pasta! My friend and I were so surprised how awful it looked! Like throw up! I decided to just get a box to go and we decided to just leave. A bus boy had to ask us if we needed our check!! It was awful! Then another guy, idk who he was, dropped off our check. I mean seriously? We probably saw about 5 different people assisting us that night. No consistency. We also noticed they moved a family to a new table and started cleaning their table as if saying ""were closing soon..we gotta clear this section of the restaurant"" it was around 1045 pm. It was horrible! the people literally grabbed their plates and walked with them to another table near us! They didn't look too happy!!! When we finally left our paid check. We had yet ANOTHER different girl pick up our check and literally open it and look down to see if we had left a tip...she was standing right there..reading our check next to us, didnt even greet us or anything. just grabbed the check and read it and walked away. This place is a JOKE!!"
Josie M.,"Walnut, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/28/2013,Really bad service we were seated and had to wait 1/2hour for the waitress to take our order when mentioned we had waited a long time she avoided us as much as she could we had to flag her down to get refills on drinks. She would notice she forgot something say she was going to get it and not return we had to look for her. I called manager he apologized for the service it was my sons birthday the experience is now part of his memory
