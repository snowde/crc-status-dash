Daisy Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",85,98,,4.0,7/21/2008,"I think this goes for BJ's restaurant & Brewhouse also. I usually meet the girls here for ""girls night out"" and love our heffies!!! We get chicken fingers, lettuce wraps and santa fe salad. We sit in the bar area since the wait is always long for the restaurant side.  I haven't tried anything else, parking is a pain. They do have a/c and it gets really packed on game nights."
Kaylee C.,"San Dimas, CA",0,3,,1.0,12/24/2013,"I love going to B.J's Restaurants, and really enjoy the food, however this B.J's has the most rude and disrespectful manager I have ever encountered. He was not willing to stand by the product or help me out in any way. I will never return to this B.J's again."
Shell S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",20,105,343,2.0,9/2/2010,It's ok to grab a beer with some friends but that's it. Food is not that good. It's too noisy to carry on a conversation. Pizza isn't authentic Chicago deep dish. I only used to go here when I went to school at Cal Poly and wanted a cold one after class. I've had the cookie ice cream Pizookie thing 10 years ago and haven't had one since.
Michael P.,"Dublin, CA",40,8,26,4.0,10/4/2008,"Well I'm not a huge fan of beer, and that's not because of my taste.  I have an allergic reaction to most alcohols, but for some reason hard cider is not so severe.  The Hard Cider at BJ's is pretty good, and if you are into beers, there's a wide selection.  Pizzas are done Chicago style - not my favorite style being a Left Coaster but it's good bite.  Pasta was above your average food chain restaurant  It's a sports bar, so women beware if your date has the attention span of pigeon with shinny objects.  Open late, till 1 AM I think, it's perfect for a late night craving. But what I'm really writing this review for is what BJ""s has introduced me to: PAZOOKI. OMG twuuu wuuuv at last!  Cookies as big as pizzas, topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream? And your choice between chocolate chip, peanut butter, oatmeal & raisin, or massive overload on  chocolate chip.  Need I say more? Go now, really!"
Anthony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",64,184,1,5.0,7/14/2008,"If I had to be reborn, even this gay man, it better be at the bottom of a pitcher of Jeremiah Red. A bartender would be the doctor, anxiously tending over the draft as I am released into a large glass pitcher, just enough for four pints of beer. In this elixir of bliss, I arise, my hair dripping with the frothy head of this delicious brew being nursed by the waiter who will serve me to you. There you are, still a mouthful of avocado egg rolls and that sticky sweet sauce that is all over your chin. Yes I know, you want to lick every drop of the nectar out of my glass, but alas, you must be at least 21 to get in. Remember to bring your ID, a few close friends, and a belly ready to be filled with my juices baby. (Next update I'll be reborn as a pizzokie.)"
Jenny P.,"Covina, CA",145,173,13,3.0,3/16/2011,The only time i come to BJ's are their beers. Porter is my fave. The food here is not bad. Their salads are really good. This place is always pack starting at 5pm.
Lady-Lourdes D.,"Walnut, CA",180,87,128,4.0,9/17/2010,"Four stars for our server Kaitlin!!! It was crowded, but it's amazing how she got our food out so quickly. She was pleasant, and she kept our drinks filled. As usual, food is always good!"
Disenchantedone Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,59,17,2.0,7/24/2012,"Extremely disappointed.  I've been to three BJ's and all of the servers have given me my bill before 1) my family and I have finished our meal, 2) have ordered any desert and 3) have given me my desert.  My latest experience in West Covina, though, takes the cake cause my server did all three. She gave us our bill when half my families food was still on their plate.  We hadn't even ordered desert or been asked if we wanted any. I put the bill down on the table, waiting for our desert.  She proceeded to stop by and attempt to pick it up three times.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you pay once you've concluded your meal, right?  This happened to me at Montebello BJ's but nowhere near as bad as this. This also happened in Burbank, but the server was extremely nice and said not to worry about it until we were absolutely done. And he kept his word and never bothered us. There is nothing more ridiculous than being harassed for your bill when you haven't finished your meal or even been served the desert you ordered.  Very disappointing service."
Rache S.,"West Covina, CA",0,42,,3.0,7/8/2013,"BJ's food is consistent, so not a problem there. Last time, however, service was horrendous. They were not that busy, but for some reason, our food took forever to come out--even after the large party that was seated 15 minutes after us. We flagged down the manager who apologized and said she would check on the food. Came out with everything but my son's fries and, again, apologized profusely. We started to eat but noticed everything was not hot--basically, like it had been sitting in the kitchen and they forgot to serve it. Our son ordered the mac and cheese--it was nearly room temp. Same with my husband's pizza and my fish tacos. A few minutes later, the fries came out. They were hot, of course--I suspect they made a fresh batch since fries don't keep well or warm up well. The manager could see our disgusted faces and asked if everything was okay. We asked if our food was just sitting in the kitchen and she said no, they just made them and came out of the kitchen (BOLD. FACE. LIE.) Needless to say, we didn't finish our food. As a consolation, they comped our drinks and gave us a free dessert. It was the least they could do. We will likely be back because it's convenient and, as I said, the food is consistent (when served immediately!!)."
Jessica S.,"Pomona, CA",22,16,9,1.0,8/25/2013,"I have always enjoyed going to BJ's. Love the food, the ambience and the drinks. Today was a bit different. The food was good. The service was mediocre at best, but the worst part was that I found a cockroach inside my cream soda as I was drinking it! My stomach turned and I had to spit out my drink inside my cup. My daughters were also drinking cream soda. I informed the waitress which in turn informed the manager. The manager's name is Cynthia.  She looked at the cockroach leg and said she guarantees there are no cockroaches and has never seen one in the kitchen.  The cockroach leg had joints and the little spiky hairs and was really gross. I can't believe she discredited the roach leg I fished out of my drink! She compensated my food, my drink and appetizer, but still charged me for both my daughter's drinks and food. They were both drinking cream soda too which I asked them to stop drinking. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I paid the remainder of my bill and took off so I can go vomit at home.  I had never been so sick to my stomach! I'll never set foot there again. I should have taken a picture of the cockroach leg to put on here!"
Cynthia G.,"Covina, CA",0,10,,3.0,2/13/2012,Good aumbience. Good customer Service. Whenver i order the pasta with the chicken with it (which has been the last 4 times) my chicken always comes out burnt
Louis A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,15,5,5.0,8/9/2011,Cajun shrimp pasta is just to die for! Everytime i go i get that...always look forward eating here
Pete R.,"Long Beach, CA",117,80,282,2.0,3/21/2011,"Parking was horrible at this location, as I experienced at the Cerritos location also. I had to park almost on the other side of the parking lot. When I got in the location, it was filled almost to capacity, which I take for a given. I met up with my friends, who were crammed into a tiny booth in the corner...one of the guys was actually sitting in a chair sticking out of the booth. I asked the next waitress who walked by for a chair and it took her somewhere between 5 or 10 minutes to look for a chair. When I did get the chair, it took a few minutes for her to come back to take my order....I wasn't eating, however I asked for a couple of pitchers to celebrate with my friends....it was almost another fifteen to twenty minutes before we received the pitchers....I thought they had forgotten about my order. What was funny was that one of the persons at our table already had a drink, but the waitress still asked her for ID. She said something about that even though the drink came from the bar, she had to check. The kicker was when we asked for desserts, we all ordered pizookies, which I have to say was a good experience, but they handed us the bill WAY before the pizookies arrived. My bill came out to 45$, almost 18 a pitcher, hell I don't even know how much the damn thing was....I'll go back as a group, but don't count on me going there alone. I'll stick to the holes in the walls.  The company was good though, and that's basically the only thing that warranted me being there."
Irma B.,"La Puente, CA",3,23,3,5.0,4/14/2011,I love BJs i had a Chocolate Cherry Martini it is Delicious also The Alfredo Baked Potato yummy! Very good Food & friendly service
Robbie R.,"Upland, CA",138,217,62,4.0,4/5/2011,"BJ's has everything pizza, patatos, burgers, salads, crazy appitizers you name it.  Really cool how they have there own selection of beer.  Notcied they had a some what decent happy hour as well till 7.  I don't normally get dessert but when I go here I will get the pizookie!  Doesent get any better than one of those!  It does get crowded so you might have to wait or try to find a spot in the bar."
Leyla J.,"Pomona, CA",9,10,,1.0,1/1/2015,"My husband, 4 year old daughter, and I decided to try BJ's for the first time early in the evening on New Year's Eve.  When we walked in, despite the rather early hour for dinner, it was very busy, and there was a wait.  There were tables in the bar though, so we decided to eat there.  We sat down, and 30 seconds later, a young couple sat at the table next to us.  While we waited over 10 minutes to have a drink order and even menus brought to us, the young couple next to us were greeted within a minute, had a drink order and their dinner order taken.  They had a salad in front of them before someone even stopped by (not the lady who ended up being our waitress, but yes the one who was taking care of the table next to us) to get our drink order or give us menus.  Now I understand that it was quite busy and the waitress who eventually took care of us told us that they'd started off the evening short staffed, and I was giving quite a bit of slack because of this.  Otherwise, I would have taken my family and walked out.  I will say that the waitress who took care of us was quite nice to us and gave special attention to my daughter, and she did keep my drink glass full.  But it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out after we were finally able to order it (the young couple next to us had eaten, paid, and the table had turned over to a new couple well before that). I ordered a ribeye medium rare.  In parts, it was medium, other parts were medium well, and it was dry.  It also could use a bit of salt, but a guy with a tray had taken all the salts and peppers off all the tables right after we sat down.  We asked our waitress for the salt, but it never showed up, so I ate my steak as it was.  My husband had the angel hair pasta with blackened chicken, and he liked it.  I tried it, and found it very bland overall, but I also bit into a large chunk of something very crunchy (no idea what it was) that had a very unpleasant taste. My daughter ordered the kid's 6"" deep dish cheese pizza.  She refused to eat it when it came out, but I made her take a couple of bites.  She said it wasn't pizza, and I must say I agree.  It wasn't deep dish pizza either.  It was just puffy cheesy bread with a tiny bit of sauce on it.  Our waitress did bring by a box for the pizza without us requesting it, trying to be helpful, saying that she was sure our daughter would want to take it home.  We told her our daughter didn't like it, refused to eat it even, but our waitress did nothing about it, just dropped off the check that she'd brought with the box.  So we just ended up paying $5.25 for it anyway and left the whole pizza behind.  Very disappointed with the level of service AND the food.  We will not be back."
Marina T.,"West Covina, CA",0,8,2,1.0,9/16/2013,"The food is great but the serive is terrible!!! Went here fornmy bday on 9/13/13 and our waktier was matthew or matt. He was very unattentive n had a really crappy attitude. My boyfriens ordered a soup n snadwich plate. He brought his soup out but asked for it to be taken back till both of our meals were ready. Server had a look on his face then took it. Then once our food was ready it took another 10 mins for him to bring back the soup. I finished my drink before my meal n by the time he asked if I wantes another k was alrdy done with my food. Then my noyfriend asked if he woukd bring the bday dessert. He did but didn't even say happy bday to me. Then my boyfriend asked if he would sing. He shook his finger at him n stated""I don't do that"" and walked away. This man was beyond rude!!! Never again will we dine there. Doesnt matter how good the food is. I will not be treated that way ever! I was a server for two yrs so I know how customers should be treated!!!"
Belinda C.,"Ontario, CA",7,18,20,3.0,6/23/2009,"I went to BJ's on Father's Day at about 12:30ish, and was pleasantly surprised to be seated as soon as we got there. There were several empty tables, but that didn't make it any less noisy in there. I ordered the Angus Pot Roast Sandwich, which was very  generous in size.  Served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Also came with oven roasted vegetables. It was delicious and very, very filling.  The service was great, and I think my only complaint would be that the silverware had dried tidbits of  food on it.  I'm not sure if my setting was a fluke, but it's enough to make me consider taking my own silverware if I ever go again."
Lauren B.,"Walnut, CA",0,5,1,1.0,8/16/2011,"This place was decent. Went there with my girlfriend for dinner last night, the waitress was rude and unformed. I probably wont go there any time soon."
Andy C.,"Cary, NC",84,413,913,3.0,11/1/2010,"Man, I wish I could give half stars, because this would be a 2.5, but because I like to give the benefit of the doubt to the establishment, I decided to go with 3 stars. Location: 3 out of 5 Pretty convenient and open location close to one of the shopping centers in the area. I think there's a Chili's, Target, Toys R Us, etc in the area.  Parking was fairly plentiful when I went. Service: 3 out of 5 Bless the server who had me as a table.  He tried.  He really did, and I do have to give him credit.  He was fairly young (probably a student), and had to deal with the baseball game crowd, plus a huge party of 8 that walked in shortly after I did.  And although it took him a long time to get my water and beer, I don't think it was all his fault.  For all I know, management may tell all their servers to wait until the bar fulfills, oh - 80% of an area's drink orders before taking off.  This makes less trips for the server, but the wait time is increased substantially.  Food came out very quickly, however.   Quality of food: 3 out of 5.   Not bad.  The flatbread pizzas here are consistent (I've had one in Oklahoma City) across all the chains.  I ordered the gourmet mac and cheese, and although tasty, they did overcook the noodles.  Very easy to tell because, a)the noodles were boiled past al dente and b)the ends were singed to a crisp (and not from the cheese). Quality of Beer: 1.5 out of 5 Really, BJ's?  You try to pass off what you serve at this location as a ""microbrew?""  Let me take a few steps back here an put this in context.  I, along with a few of my close friends, are fairly avid home brewers.  We don't have cyclone fermenters, but we do have fairly decent setups that yield a consistent tasting and looking product from batch to batch.  You know what their ""light lager"" tasted like at this location?  It tasted worse than my first batch of home brew using the Mr Beer kit.  No joke.  Their Kolsch?  A little more flavor, but not much better.  Their Hefe was passable.  Their pale ale was nicely hopped and actually had a good finish, but had the same consistent flaw that I noticed in all of the beers, which I'll get into.  The seasonal pumpkin brew was mildly spiced and didn't have a whole lot of pumpkin flavor.  You'd be better off going to the store and getting a pumpkin ale made by Sam Adams or something.  So why the ire from me?  What did BJ's do that was so earth shattering that I was seriously disappointed with my entire beer experience there?  It's what they didn't do, and that's to let the beer mellow out.  Every single beer I had there had that really young almost acetone-esque smell (incomplete diacetyl rest, perhaps...) and taste.  Even the pale ale, which was properly hopped and quite good, had a very unpleasant finish due to not enough mellowing time.  This is a stark contrast to the Oklahoma City location, which I thought had more than acceptable varieties of the same beers I had at this location.   Overall: 3 out of 5 Know what you're getting into before you go.  It's not a terrible chain, but it's definitely not the best, either.  And I wouldn't really call this location a ""brewpub..."" More like a restaurant that serves ok food with subpar house brews."
