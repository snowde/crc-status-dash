david p.,"West Covina, CA",0,6,,1.0,9/28/2012,Service bad. Drinks bad.  Asked for plates for a party of 9 got 2. Mixed drinks was too sour that's all you taste for a long island. 42 mIn later to make the drInk agaIn nIce .Clam chowder with no crackers. Been an hour and only 3 items came out.  Food just came out. And they didn't clean up the empty plates.food was salty and full of oil. Chicken marsala 5meat pizza was salty and all oil. Like dominoes pizza  nothing but grease. Just got home and now I'm on the toilet. Geez I remembered this place use to he decent. To top it off everything was way over priced
Cliff B.,"Henderson, NV",12,20,12,4.0,3/10/2011,"I have been to BJ's in Houston and this was the same exact experience. Good food, plenty of choices, and great waiters. Good overall."
Marie Y.,"Azusa, CA",114,155,13,3.0,1/26/2008,"I like this place...really, I do.  What I couldn't figure out was why the service was so slow at 11:00 a.m., which is when they open.  Lucky for me, the baby wasn't that hungry yet so I didn't have to worry about the crankiness that comes with when he's starving.  I was armed with crackers and juice just in case, anyway.   We must've waited about 15 minutes for our food after the server took our order.  When our food did arrive, my son had the chicken tenders and happy face potatoes, which he really enjoyed.  I had the BBQ chicken salad in the lunch-size, which is still pretty big.  I could only eat 3/4ths of it.  At least they don't skimp on the portions, so you totally get your money's worth.   I'll still come to BJ's because of the food and the atmosphere.  The only area of improvement needed was the service.  I could understand if it was super-busy, but it wasn't today and the servers were still slow in responding."
Daniel C.,"Tustin, CA",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2014,"Probably my worst experience I have ever had at BJs. I did the order ahead dine in option thinking when I got there my food would have begun being made. Walked in she had me on the waitlist got seated. There was a cup with our receipt order and everything, time passed no sign of a waiter. Finally the waiter showed up and did not know we had ordered ahead and eventually saw the receipt and took it. Then more time passed it was about 8:45pm now and we had got there at 8pm. The waiter says he got the manager since our food had not come out. Manager comes out basically says our food has not been made. At this point I am pretty confused and livid considering there was a receipt with our order exactly, so I don't get how they can print out a receipt of the order but yet blame their system for not receiving it. Looked really bad on them he finally brought out the food and forgot our pazookies. They were not even that good. Overall never going back to this BJs."
Jerson David A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",8,114,10,2.0,1/10/2013,"waiting to be seated took a bit long but the service was very bad, took very long on drinks and our food plus took for ever for a refill ..the was the worst experience i had at BJ's..."
Jason J.,"Upland, CA",37,473,96,3.0,8/24/2008,"I got take out from this BJ's a few months ago.  This location gets horribly crowded, so thankfully we had ordered for take out. Of course, I stood around and waited behind some people who thought it best to stand in front of the cash register like they were waiting for something, and the cash register staff were more than happy to look at me as a new comer and smile like I belonged in this line to nowhere just like everyone else. In the end, I got my food and went home, and was pretty happy. Personally, I feel like the Ontario location has a little more reasonable wait range than the West Covina location. Recommendation: potato wedges seem better than french fries, and personally, I don't care for their meatballs (too much bell pepper.) Oh! and their strawberry lemonade is GREAT."
Chunk C.,"Los Angeles, CA",114,107,58,2.0,7/30/2012,"Just got back from BJ's lunch right now and was not too pleased.  There was 9 of us, and several ordered the same meals...however it took us an ENTIRE HOUR just to get our food! i mean its only lunch time its not even as busy as dinner would be and it took that long?! so of course we ended up being there a total 1.5 hours which is a way extended work lunch bc of how long it took to get our food.  I ordered half sandwich and soup.  They put the soup in a huge plate it looked like so it could seem like they gave you a lot of soup when in fact they didnt; what a waste of table space & of a plate! The sandwich meat was cold when the bread was warm which made no sense... it somewhat grossed me out because shouldnt the meat have been warm if the bread was? they also put avocado when i asked for none, in addition to the wrong style fries.  I wouldnt say it was the servers fault because she even said herself ""they brought that out when u ordered no avocado or wedge fries"". that was pretty much why i gave them a 2 star for both food and service (kitchen service NOTserver service). i suppose this is why i have never really been a fan of BJs."
N. V.,"Los Angeles, CA",30,87,,2.0,6/23/2007,"I've been to this location probably three times and I always end up feeling like a crotchety old lady - it's too loud and there are too many young people. Bah. It's a chain restaurant with your standard American food and fake brewery. Big ups for the Pazookie, but that's about it."
Hy C.,"Oceanside, CA",2,35,,4.0,8/11/2008,"Did someone say BJ??!  I'd want go there right now! Hahaha I've been coming here a lot during lunch time.  This place get so pack during lunch time we just sit at the bar area order drinks and foods.  Services is little slow, but they're very friendly waiter/waitress will do their best help you with the orders.  Lunch menu is freaking awesome, order any dishes and come with $1 soup/salad.  Scamp pasta's my favor dish, succulent shrimp with olive oil, butter, garlic, lemon juice and Roma tomatoes.  Also my favor Harvest Hefeweizen beer with little lemon juice.  Overall, BJ's great place hang out with friends and getting drunks going back work =)."
Cleo M.,"Oakland, CA",109,144,5,5.0,11/3/2007,"WOW....I didn't think they made places like this anymore. There services is just amazing..............we had an issue with our table the manager made sure we got it in 30 minutes not an hour like others were getting, did I mention it was 7 of us in the party. We order the big appetizer platter that was sent to the wrong table, the manager came over and told us the problem and put the platter on the house for us.  Just great.... The is also delicious,  I usually order pasta and I did - the chardonay shrimp pasta. A white sauce with tomator and plump shrimps - yummy. Two of my friends order the pizzas and it looked delicious from there faces - I knew it was.  Another two of my friends order the meat and it was a huge mountain of food. It was very good lookin' and the other two, one order a club sandwich and chicken with steamed vegetables.  The waiter was so cool, he even brought one of my friends wedges on the house.  Of course we couldn't leave without trying the famous pazookie. We got half chocolate chip and the other half white macondamian nut and white chocolate chip with scoops of white vanille bean ice cream. It was good... we could have shared with more people, with only the seven of use we scapped the platter clean in a minute or two flat. I think the beers are great though I didn't try any. Our waiter was gonna give the beer speech but we didn't drink but he seemed excited to give it so I assumed he stands behind the quality of the products. You can't go wrong here....."
Mini L.,"Gardena, CA",24,28,,3.0,1/24/2008,"Tried a raspberry beer... forgot the name of it...  It was good but very sweet. Ordered a combination plate with mozarella sticks, eggrolls, dips, chips and spinach cheese dip..  It was pretty good.  Large enough to share with 3 or more people, if you are not too hungry. Good atmosphere.  Plenty of space at the bar....for happy hour and chatting with co-workers.  Nice wooden decor.  It's clean."
Sergio R.,"Los Angeles, CA",137,150,93,4.0,5/4/2008,I always have at LEAST a decent time when I come here and always get a place at the bar. If there's no space available I just order the drinks first all whilst keeping an eye open for anybody heading out. Service can take a while but as soon as they spot you they'll head you're way. The Hef is good and a pitcher serves up 4 glasses. The pizza is delicious! Nothing beats a simple pepperoni and mushroom. For the noobs - they'll ask you if you want tomatoes on that. Great place to knock down some beers and chat it up. Mixed drinks and shots are made well too. A lot of Cal Poly comes here. Past 10 = 1/2 off mini pizza's and some other savings for appetizers and beers.
Guen S.,"Covina, CA",89,91,28,4.0,5/25/2008,"This place is pretty cool. It's different from the other BJs I've gone to. This is more spacious, and has roomy booths. They designed in more of a sports bar, so there's t.v.s visible from every angle. Great for small get togethers. I'm not sure if they have an Happy Hour.  It's a lil' pricey. Not a place I'd go every weekend. But every once and awhile.  If you like Hefeweizen beer, this is the place to go."
Rob L.,"Covina, CA",2,11,1,4.0,1/23/2011,Ahi Poke and a glass of blonde beer hits the spot everytime.
Desiree C.,"Walnut, CA",2,11,,1.0,9/11/2009,"I use to be alright with this place. Its chain food, so you can't expect too much. Yet, one night my boyfriend and I came in at a DEAD time, when there was about 10 other people in this huge restaurant. The waiter was nice, took our order and we NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. We never got refills, he never gave us the check, and we had to bother a ""runner"" for our check, which I hate to do. Ugh, I won't come here again. No thanks. Oh and the hostesses are awful."
Jess P.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,40,3,3.0,1/3/2010,"Really good food, and the pizookies are to die for. But this place is loud, loud, loud. Good luck trying to have a conversation in here. It's been a couple years since I've been here, but I used to go quite frequently and it's always packed, so be prepared to wait."
Melinda L.,"Orange County, CA",73,329,16,4.0,2/12/2008,"BJs is an all-around good brewery place to chill after work or just to eat some tasty pizza and grub.  It's an all-American joint gourmet-ish bar food locale. It's one of the better restaurants in the area, right next to the mall and Eastland shopping center.  Their pizzas are thick and tasty and their baked potatoes are truly the definition of ""loaded.""  Their sandwiches are pretty tasty as well, such as the crispy chicken, chicken salad and the roast beef dip sandwiches.  Try out BJs man...you'll come back with more buds later on!"
James T.,"Arcadia, CA",2844,275,2520,4.0,3/5/2011,"Great spot for a chill night. Great wings, pizza and beers. Never let's me down. Must orders is the great white pizza, wings and Jeremiah Red. I don't mess with desserts but can't go wrong with the Pizookie. It's a cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. Choose the white chocolate macadamia nut. Schend!"
William O.,"Honolulu, HI",0,76,,2.0,4/4/2010,"Food definitely tasted pre fab, lacked flavor, was only warm at best, and is overpriced. I wanted a lunch special but was told they were only available Monday - Friday and was directed to a more expensive meal, WT? Service was slow and it took forever to get the bill paid. When the waitress had to keep apologizing you know there is a problem. The place is very noisy which takes away from your experience spent w family. I wonder if the managers ever read their Yelp reviews?"
CJ C.,"Chino, CA",242,18,7,5.0,11/26/2011,one of my favorite restaurants. they have a good range of food and beers. i particularly enjoy their buffalo pizza and top it off with a pizookie!
