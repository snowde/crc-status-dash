Cassandra S.,"San Dimas, CA",0,11,4,1.0,9/25/2012,"We went to BJ's to celebrate my little brother's  21st bday and it was HORRIBLE!!!!! I had been there like 5 years ago and had bad service and haven't been back till tonight. When I called to make reservations they put it down at the wrong time and my brother called to do the same not knowing I already did and they never wrote it down. So tonight a drink was spilt on my niece, my nephew and I didn't get our breadsticks, my other niece never got her steak (we asked and it was dropped on the floor so they had to make a new one and never thought to let us know...they eneded up having to give it to her to go and her baked potatoe got cold waiting. poor girl only ate a salad) I had to clean off the tables for the pies that i had to ask for them to bring a couple of times to be brought then get handed all the packs of forks to pass out too (since I'm so good at ""working"" there) OH BTW!!! did I mention that while i was cleaning, the waiters were standing around texting laughing and talking like 5 feet away, and when the guy decided to get off his butt to clean the table off (which I was almost done doing for him) he told my boyfriend that I should apply!!!! WTH?!?!?! How about just doing your job?! So much for my brother having a great dinner. Oh well... won't be going back. The manager did try to help but as he is helping us on one side they were still messing up on the other side. We had to just suck it up and get out of there because there was no way the manager could keep fixing the staffs problems. We probably should have got our whole meal free. However not even that would make any of our party of 17 go back. The 1 star is only because of the manager trying to help. I will be sure to spread the word."
Kakugorou Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",72,63,,4.0,7/6/2010,"surprisingly, i am a fan of this chain restaurant.  friends have been frequenting this place since my high school days, but surprisingly... ive never eaten more than a bite of pizookie there until yesterday. me &the boyfriend went and we were happily seated within ~5mins. the place was packed, but the overall ambience was nice. shockingly so!  tho i thot it was happy hour (we went at 6pm monday), we did not get a discount on our appetizer... i guess you have to ask for it specifically? but nonetheless, those pale ale nachos were amazing! i was skeptical cus im not a fan of nachos, but those chips were nice and fresh tasting and the chili! omgg... the chili was amazing! i usually dont like things that are cooked with alcohol, but somehow this was jst... it worked. boyfriend usually get the small pizzas here, but i convinced him to try something new and he got the angus pot roast sandwich. when we got the order, i thot they brought out the wrong dish! the garlic bread was buried under the mound of mash potatoes &pot roast! but twas lovely. mushroom gravy, tender pot roast, very creamy thick cheesy mash potatoes BUT the winner was the garlic bread. buttery, garlicky, tender, chewy, and sweet all at the same time! despite being buried. LOVE. i got the santa fe salad w/ the blacked salmon. i was surprised by the decent size of the salmon filet! it was cooked to perfection and tasted rather fresh. a good deal because it was a good sized piece of fish (main course worthy) AND there was still an entree-sized salad left! the dressing was delectable but the roasted peppers were oddly sour.. yeah. overall tho, i was pleasantly surprised. being a picky eater, i hope that this time wasnt a fluke and the next time will also be a happy ending! :]"
Ms. C.,"Berkeley, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/5/2010,"One Star because I had to click something, and I wasn't going to click more than one, anyways.  Great food, bad representative service - even at the door. Usually when I come here, the service is okay. I might be harsh since I've been a server before and now I'm a bartender in Hollywood. I came in here before to ask if I could speak with the manager so that I can give him/her my resume. Talked to the host who was a dumb 18 yr old girl who was brushing me off. Made her get the manager for me, and that sucked. The ""manager"" didn't seem like a manager, she was probably some shift leader. Fat, dark skinned, very unapproachable lady who was rude, and also brushed me off saying they were super busy and couldn't see any applicants (even though the place was pretty much EMPTY - esp. for BJ's.) She wouldn't even accept or touch my resume (putting her two hands up to surrender). Told me to come back tomorrow. no thanks!"
Nina P.,"Orange County, CA",68,98,48,5.0,6/8/2009,"This place is awesome. Yummy Pizza. Happy hour or laker games here are great but get there early as it gets packed! Happy hour has half off mini pizzas, $2 off apps, and $1 off their draft beer"
Scott M.,"Puyallup, WA",4,8,6,3.0,12/28/2011,"I've been to this location at least five times. This was the worst experience I've had in regards to the food. This was my first time ordering the ANGUS POT ROAST SANDWICH with mashed potatoes and oven roasted  vegetables. It was served open face on garlic french toast. The first problem with my dish was the vegetables. They were carrots, celery and onion. Kinda of a let down. They were serves cold, undercooked and with white spots on the carrots and celery. Meaning they had been sitting for at least 10 min. The pot roast was dry and cold also. The mashed potatoes were so hot I burned the roof of my mouth. Maybe the cooks were hoping the potatoes would keep the rest of the pot roast and veggies warm??!! The kicker, as I moved the potatoes and pot roast aside, the garlic french toast was burnt on one half. Overall the dish was disappointing. The server was great though. He offered a free dessert for all the trouble."
Heather J.,"Baldwin Park, CA",99,103,4,2.0,6/2/2011,"I love the food at BJ's but the service here isn't very good.  Usually it's not awful, but the last time we went it was terrible.  My friends and I work with the youth at our church and every week after we meet, we go to dinner.   We went here one week and had the worst service.  We sat in the bar because the host told us that would be quickest for a group our size at the time.  So we sit and everyone orders.  Two of my friends had already eaten so they ordered the pizookie platter to split.  And one just got a regular pizookie.  The food comes, but the pizookies didn't come for another half an hour at least.  My friend and I had decided to split one after we ate our meals so we decided to order one ASAP.  Yeah, good luck getting the server's attention.  We finally order and again it takes at least half an hour.  Then getting our check took forever.  Granted it was busy, but my friend and I have both been servers and are usually pretty understanding but this really tried our patience."
Christopher J.,"Rowland Heights, CA",174,591,420,2.0,11/17/2008,"Short and quick: (1) service was horrible, (2) bj's favorite pizza was excellent!"
Philippe G.,"Covina, CA",584,146,158,4.0,8/26/2008,"BJs....who doesn't love BJs...Giggidy giggidy...I love it here...I don't get to get wasted like back in the day on J. Red beer...but I love the food.  Start with the dip and usually roll with a pizza.  The Pazookie is a must....ice cream on the side otherwise you'll get that soggy cereal effect....Good service and good times are to had here....If you haven't gone, make it an item on your to do list tomorrow....if you're single, you may just meet someone..it's usually packed all night long...."
Alexis C.,"Azusa, CA",94,74,1,1.0,8/18/2008,"** this is mostly about the service** I went to BJs for a friends bday. We had a party of 8, so you know that means 18% tip easily for the servers. I have been to BJs when my party has been 15 and we had excellent service. But man this time for only 8 the service was bust!  So I order a pitcher of cider, the waitress wont let me order for one person. I dont want to sound like an alcoholic but really for friggin cider??? Get over yourself BJs. So my friend chipped in sayin it was goin to be shared. The waitress comes back with the pitcher and glasses. I hold the glass and its prickly and dirty. I tell the waitess the glasses were dirty and if we can get another pair. She gives me this lame excuse about they are just scratched. WTF??? I see food particles stickin to the glass what kind of scratch is that missy? So she hesitantly grabs another pair. I tried to ignore her attitude the whole night. They even try to bum rush us while we were still eatin. Picking up and waiting for us to pay the bill. Hey bjs dont rush mexicans we will take our sweet beaner time.  BJs you are lame as can be."
Michael G.,"Rowland Heights, CA",18,35,7,2.0,11/24/2008,this ones gonna be short... really bad service! awesome bj's special pizza!
Mel L.,"Arcadia, CA",89,354,140,4.0,3/4/2009,"This place was rocking on a Thursday night, they had a wait to get in.  I like this store much better than the one in Arcadia.  It has a very ""Vegas"" feeling to it.  Food was great, and the beer was fresh and cold (I had the flight of samplers)."
Randy Y.,"Chino Hills, CA",23,68,31,5.0,5/21/2009,"Food are amazing. I don't go there a lot, just because the food are pricey. Environment is great for all occasions. I've been there for a date, to watch a football game, and for a family dinner or celebration, all have been wonderful.  Service is always good. I recommend the Cobb Salad and BJ's Fav & Chicken Alfredo Pizza. Can't go wrong with that! BTW, own brewed beer is not bad either!"
Greg T.,"Newport Beach, CA",879,372,1223,4.0,6/14/2008,"BJ's togo girl Sarah does a great job. Be sure to tip her. Most places I've been the togo serviced basically sucked, but she made sure that I had plates, napkins, etc, etc. Sarah is giving BJ's a good reputation.... for good service.... so remember, Sarah, Good Service, BJ's."
Mike L.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",83,1291,17,4.0,1/21/2009,went here for lunch with some guys from work. Ordered the Cuban burger and it was very good. I would order it again. I didnt care for their thick cut fries. Good service also.

Carter K.,"Azusa, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/13/2013,"Horrible service. My wife and I went on Tuesday night around 6ish. Place was semi empty. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to even get to our table. She promised us a free pazooki at the end of the night to make up for the wait. Ordered our food. Food was great as usual. We waited another 20 minutes after we finished our food for her to make an appearance again. She asked what pazooki we wanted as she promised, we said the triple chocolate. Well she had another waiter bring us our pazooki, it was a birthday pazooki. Why even ask what flavor we wanted if your just going to bring us a birthday original pazooki? By this time we were annoyed and just wanted to receive our bill. Well that took another 15 minutes. We went again on a Saturday night same crap. Horrible service, typed in wrong order. And all the tables around us were complaining as well. This time I ordered a pazooki and the cookie came back cold and hard and on top of that they were out of silverware and gave us plastic spoons for our hard shell pazooki. The waitress comes to us and says sorry. I can't believe this, have you seen our reviews on yelp? They are horrible. ( the reason I made an account) I wouldn't come back and eat here lol THEN when she comes back to give us our check. She tries to sign us up for their reward program!? Lol horrible service. Never going back to this location."
J. P.,"La Verne, CA",0,48,,5.0,10/1/2011,Great beer and appetizers.  Love the Tatonka beer.  Marguerite fresco pizza and the fresh Mozzarella tomato salad are a favorite.  Take a growler home of your favorite beer.  Save room for a pizookie. Sit in the bar for happy hour prices.
Sonia S.,"West Covina, CA",0,9,,5.0,6/21/2009,I LOVE LOVE LOVVVEE Their PIZZA!! Fisch Tacos rock Pazookie rocks pastas are a little on the bland side but still decent. Ranch dressing is really good too.
Brandon K.,"Temple City, CA",372,72,8,5.0,6/6/2010,"of all the BJ's ive experienced, this one was by far the best. the waitress really knew what she was doing. the way she handled herself was like nothing ive ever seen.  she catered to my every need... even my numerous requests for water to rehydrate myself. my only complaint was the mess. the sauce got everywhere and i needed 3 moist towelettes to clean up. even the waitress got sauce on her hands from my plate. it was ALL OVER.  the best part of the BJ experience was the cookie for dessert. after all that work cleaning up... it is totally worth it to sit back and enjoy a giant cookie covered in chocolate.  most of the waitresses here are willing to go the extra mile for their customers... awesome time."
Mark B.,"Covina, CA",18,7,4,4.0,6/14/2011,Where should I begin... first off I love there beer they have all kinds available I have tried most of them but my personal favorite is the blonde it's a light beer but has a really good taste.  We ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza which was amazing it even has dill pickle on it which sounds weird but trust me its freakin good!  I like it to cause its original considering how pricey the pizzas are here at least they have original pizzas that you probably couldn't order at most restaurants therefore I highly recommend it.  We also got the stuffed mushrooms which were okay I've has better if your going to order an appitizer I would recommend the avocado eggrolls they are really good.  For desert we tried the red velvet pizookie and I can honestly say it's my favorite pizookie I love them all but this one is really good you have to try.  Overall I love the food at B.j.'s although its always busy and parking is kinda hard to find at this location its perfect for a special occasion such as birthdays.  I wouldn't recommend it for just a normal a dinner outing because it's kinda pricey but if your really craving good food and drinks and you got the funds then go for it ;)
