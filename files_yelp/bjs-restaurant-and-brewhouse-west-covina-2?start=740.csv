Stephen F.,"Glendora, CA",146,11,,2.0,2/4/2009,"Okay - the food here is pretty amazing...If it weren't for the fact that it is convenient, close, and relatively inexpensive, I wouldn't be eating here.  Again and again, the customer service has been sub-par.  If you don't mind asking four times for a refill, two times for ketchup, three times for the check, and after asking time-and-time again getting no response then BJ's is a recommended restaurant.  This is not an isolated instance either.  4 out of 5 times that I eat here the service is horrible.  On top of that the management doesn't seem to see customer service as a priority.  I am not one to complain to anyone else without notifying the management of what I am telling you.  They just don't care!  You have to ask them numerous times to get a refill as well."
Christopher C.,"Arcadia, CA",1497,271,57,3.0,9/25/2007,"I still can't help laughing whenever someone mentions getting ""BJ's"" for happy hour (yes I have a dirty mind I know)...Regardless of the interesting name, this chain of restaurant/breweries are all over Southern California and I've been a repeat customer for years. Each one varies by the crowd it attracts, but the one in Covina seems to favor a mixed bunch. On any given Friday or Saturday night, you get the 20-30 something age group crowd of fairly attractive people all looking to get drunk and perhaps grab something to eat in the process. I usually start off with a tall glass of hef or if I'm really craving a beer, then it's Jeremiah Red for me. 3 of these and I've got a good buzz going. As far as food, I stick with appetizers which is usually nachos, chicken wings, or fries...although I highly recommend the barbecue chicken deep dish pizza! YUM! Oh, and a BJ experience *snicker* isn't complete without ordering a pazookie! A pawhat now? For all you newbies, a pazookie is a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie about the size of a dinner plate, topped with vanilla ice cream....every dieter's nightmare, but oh sooooo good! Almost as good as a real BJ....ok maybe not, but pretty damn close. =)  Gotta try it folks... But I'm only giving this place a 3 star cuz bar service is pretty slow, as well as table service on busy nights....and when you're hungry, slow service is grounds for someone going postal. I like this place though....great for big groups and for happy hour. nuff said."
sarah i.,"Oakland, CA",59,200,,3.0,7/3/2007,"BJs started the insane explosion of middle-to-high end chains in WC. We always had a lot of chains here - TGIFs, Applebee's, Chili's - and then we suddenly reached a tipping point where seriously, the chains just exploded - now we even Hooters. I mean, who puts a Hooters in WEST COVINA???!!!! Anyway, now we even have a CPK (who puts a CPK in WEST COVINA???!!). But BJs started it all. You can't go wrong with a BJs pizza. The waits here are insanely long, though."
Lisa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,118,,3.0,1/28/2010,"i'll give this place 3 stars for the food. their service can be bad at times especially on big game nights.  try to go during lunch, good specials."
Joe G.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,4.0,9/14/2006,"I have no idea what the hell Andrew D. is smoking! BJ's has pretty good food, a nice selection, great deep dish pizza and a really good microbrewery.  Can't go wrong with a BJ's famous, a pitcher of porter, red, or hef!"
D V.,"Whittier, CA",8,122,3,5.0,3/3/2008,"Love the Cider, Food and ESPECIALLY the Pizookie.  Order the Pizookie and BJ'S donates a portion of all Pizookie sales to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation."
Jocelyn V.,"West Covina, CA",66,11,3,3.0,4/24/2010,"Went here for to have dinner with a friend. The place was packed like any other BJ's I've been to. Luckily, we did not have to wait that long for a table. Our server was really friendly (I think he was checking out my friend). Got our drinks right away. I got an Arnold Palmer (half lemonade, half iced tea) and my friend got the Strawberry Lemonade which in his opinion was very sweet. For appetizers, we got the Spinach Artichoke dip which was really good. It was smooth, creamy and nicely blended. I usually get the BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza but thought I should try something else. So we got BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza for the main course. It has meatballs, Italian sausage, pepperoni, green bell peppers, onions , tomatoes and mushrooms. It was good, over par, though I expected more meat and cheese in it. Tasted better with lots of crushed red peppers and ranch. Got full right away after a slice so we had to skip dessert."
Andrew D.,"Glendora, CA",8,24,10,2.0,2/22/2006,It a meat market.  Their food isn't that good so there has to be another reason people go.  I guess if your in to micro brew beers they are suppose to be pretty good.  I have also received some of my worst restaurant service ever in this BJ's
Neville D.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,12,1,5.0,7/17/2007,"if you haven't been to Bjs, go beer is amazing, piranha pale ale is fav(if you like bitter beer) or the hefeweizen is good their Pizza is the bomb, bbq chicken, spinach & artichoke, or blackened chicken are all good.  you really cant go wrong with any of their specialty pizzas.  haven't tried any of their other food and the pazooki is a must try definitely a 5outof5stars"
Steven A.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,1,,4.0,5/6/2008,"Been here on Friday & Saturday nights, and I always order in the bar area. It gets crowded here for dinner, lots of people, so sometimes it can be quite a wait. They have a good service and of course good brew. It can get quite loud at times, but that doesn't bother me. This is a great place to socialize with friends.."
Shelley L.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",13,21,,4.0,3/18/2009,"Went here last month for my brother's birthday. We were a little late (not my fault) so when we got there my family had ordered the avocado rolls appetizer plate. To my surprise, they were really good and had a yummy dipping sauce. So me and my brother decided to order pizza and we actually agreed on the same kind. Buffalo Chicken pizza. It was the best of both worlds. It was a deep dish style pizza that came with wing sauce in place of regular tomato sauce.  It also came with ranch dipping sauce. DELICIOUS!!!! It was like eating buffalo wings and pizza all at the same time. Loved it! To then top it off, I ordered my favorite, the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pizzokie. If it is your birthday they will bring you one with a candle in it. Pizzokies are one of the best deserts ever! Hot cookie + ice cream = HEAVEN!!!  Oh, I can't forget to mention my fav drink here, the berry cider.  PINK BEER, so good.  Usually not a beer drinker, but I will order this every time I come here."
Olivia Q.,"Montclair, CA",1,3,,2.0,4/13/2009,"I can understand the wait to get seated but it's usually all down hill from there.  What is up with the customer service?  I can never seem to get any of my requested condiments, I can't say never they usually come at the end of my meal.  The appiezters usually come with my food or after my meal is half way done, I'm pretty sure they're suppose to come before my meal.  The food is good and I love the beer selection but because of the customer service, I won't be back anytime soon."
