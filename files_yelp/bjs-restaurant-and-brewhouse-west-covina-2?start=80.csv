Joseph L.,"Los Angeles, CA",429,237,686,5.0,10/20/2016,"I come to a lot of BJ's pretty frequently but none comes close to the service I always get at the one in West Covina. If you're here and you're lucky enough to have Frank as your server you're in luck.  Honestly the guy is talented enough to work at a high end restaurant if he wanted to.  He gets customer service to the dot.  Their food is always good at this location as well. If you haven't had the best luck at other BJ's give this one and Frank a shot.  Not sure why this place gets such low reviews.  It's great food for the value. Sign up for the mobile rewards app, BOGO coupons are pretty frequent as well."
Corrine M.,"Covina, CA",9,4,6,3.0,9/12/2017,"Changing From 1 to 3 stars and giving Kudos to manager Krysteen for reaching out to me to talk about my experience in an effort to retain my business and figure out how to better serve customers in the future.  Thank you!  It was getting late so I ordered via their online service to pick up curbside.  I figured it would be pretty quick.  I ordered at 7:24 and it said my order would be ready at 7:45.  I got there at 7:48.  An employee came out to the car next to mine and did her transaction first.  That was fine since she was there before me.  She then asked me my name and brought out my bill and took my credit card.  She came back and I signed but she was still not done with the other customer.  After several trips back and forth she finally offered me a free drink for my wait.  By this time it had been about half an hour.  She was very nice and apologetic, but when she finally brought out the first part of my order it was 8:25.  40 minutes past the time I was given in their confirmation email.  She offered me two free drinks to compensate for the long wait.   I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, but 40?!  How ridiculous!"
Deborah Y.,"Covina, CA",175,13,5,1.0,1/11/2017,"Not pleased at all. Especially with my most recent visit. Because this BJ's is so close to home, I've been here several times. Typically there was nothing special about the place, but also nothing really to complain about, so I never bothered to leave a review until now. My mom and I were a bit hungry, so we went to eat lunch at BJ's around 3/4. There weren't very many people at the time, aside from the bar area that held it's usual beer-drinking football-watchers. There was the occasional loud cheer or angry grumble, but my mother and I didn't care too much. Even though the dining areas were close to empty, we were asked to wait about five to ten minutes. We weren't in a hurry, so we didn't care too much about this either. When they did come to seat us, they placed us in the back of the restaurant, far from the football watchers, which was considerate. But didn't really do much to lower the volume of their cheers with us still being in the same large room. We sat down, and I was quick to notice two other families in the same area. One which were nearing the end of their meal, and the other had recently sat down as well, but had drinks in front of them. We were informed that a waiter would be with us shortly, and low and behold- no one came. 5 minutes passed, then 10, then 15. Multiple times we tried to flag down a waiter, only to either go unnoticed or ignored. The only employee who seemed to walk by our section was a busboy who seemed very intent on cleaning the same ""recently vacated"" table. We tried to flag him down as well, but to no avail. In the end, about 15 minutes had passed with no one coming by to even ask us for our drink orders. My mother and I decided we didn't need to waste our time there anymore. Needless to say, we won't be coming back."
JC D.,"Glendora, CA",30,53,46,1.0,2/12/2017,Behaviornof the receptionist should not be tolerated ....she was rude and behavior is very un professional Nobody on the pick up area and she directed me and address me as over there ....her name is Mary She should not be in that position....
Steven P.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,12,1,5.0,5/22/2017,Reuben displayed qualities of a veteran server. He was attentive but not overwhelming. Reuben was sure to make a personal connection with each of his other tables.
Jane R.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,5.0,12/3/2017,I went to this restaurant for the first time today and I had the best experience! My server Alyssa was very friendly and when I asked her for recommendations she was very knowledgeable about the dishes and my food was amazing! Alyssa really went above and beyond to make our first impression of BJs really perfect. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and also recommend they ask for Alyssa. She really cares about the customer.
Yvonne H.,"La Puente, CA",16,2,,1.0,9/29/2017,We were waiting over an hour to be seated. They were serving pizza outside while the people were waiting. They kept serving everyone who barely came and kept skipping us. Until my dad complained to her.
Magdi S.,"Rowland Heights, CA",54,3,,1.0,12/27/2016,"I really don't want even to give them 1 star. I walked in to the bar area, it wasn't clean,all the tables have left overs on it. Even all the people walking were lost and don't know where to sit because of the dirty tables. I spoke to the manger Stacey, she was like what I can do!!!!! We are short handed....sorry!!!!!! Very bad service and bad handling from the manager too."
Kenny K.,"Fontana, CA",107,17,29,1.0,9/19/2017,"Went for dinner with the girlfriend, and what was suppose to be a easy and typical dinner, was turned upside down.  I had ordered my entree, and her just a broccoli cheese soup.  Our appetizer and my entree came out on a timely manner, however our soup was taking an eternity.  Half way through my dish and our appetizer finished we had asked our server to check on our soup, he said sure and went his way without returning. We pinned him down and asked can you please see what had happened to our soup a second time.  He comes back and just tells us he has no idea why it takes this long and goes away.  At this point I'm done with my meal and our appetizer and my girlfriends stomach empty.  We pin him down once more to just cancel the damn soup, he says let me go back there once again.  He brings two out and says you can take the other since it took awhile.  We were so irritated with his serving skills, if he has no idea where our soup is then who does?  A simple sorry would've sufficed.  But not once did we receive an apology just an extra soup 1 hour later, which we don't even want at this point.  Management needs to do something about their server training procedures at this particular location."
Zoan E.,"Miramar, San Diego, CA",17,50,59,4.0,8/22/2017,"Our server was personable, attentive and engaging. Our drinks came quickly and our appetizer followed soon after. Our food was well prepared, delightfully presented and enjoyed by the entire party. No complaints at all."
Christy K.,"West Covina, CA",125,18,17,1.0,6/15/2017,"They estimated 30min wait for 7 people... We ended up waiting 1 hr hearing groups of 19, 10, and etc head in before us. When we asked how much longer, they kept saying we're next.  But other larger groups went. When they finally gave us a seat at a booth that fit only 5.....they made us wait an additional 20mins for a bigger table.  But the hostess told us multiple times that she set aside a specific table for us that's why the wait was 2x the wait.  But the table couldn't fit seven....The wait was 1.5 hours..... This is not how you treat customers... Not worth waiting for overpriced food..."
Ryan H.,"Torrance, CA",4,45,3,1.0,6/17/2017,"This  BJ's is terrible, and lacks a good manager. My child slipped on the bathroom floor because there was a ton of water on it. Toilets were a mess, trash cans overflowing. When I brought it to managements attention it still didn't get done, and he said he'd stop by to check on the kid, and nothing."
Kristin M.,"Riverside, CA",26,23,7,3.0,1/28/2017,"Today 1/27/17 I utilized curbside to go at the West Covina BJ's location. I have a few complaints regarding my visit. 1. When I arrived I called the curbside to go number as prompted in the email instructions. No one answered. I had to google and call the store number to get an answer. My order didn't come out until 12 minutes later. I was a couple minutes late to work due to no one answering the phone and the order taking so long to be brought to me.  2. I ordered a lunch size pizza with pepperoni. There were sections of cheese missing on the pizza and there were no tomatoes on the pizza. The receipt emailed to me quoted me $7.25 for my lunch special and I was charged $8.25 at the restaurant. I had already pulled off when I noticed and since I was pressed for time I couldn't turn around.   3. I ordered a regular strawberry  Lemonade for. $3.25. I received a my drink in a child's cup.  I didn't order a child's lemonade.  I didn't have enough time to complain, because I needed to get to to work.   That contacted me and rectified the situation. They comped me a free lunch. I will re update after my next experience."
Ginni K.,"Alhambra, CA",1,13,2,1.0,9/10/2017,"Won't b coming back here.. this is the only BJ's that has the worst customer service that I have gone to in the last 15 years. We sat down but my son was acting up so I asked them to just put my order to go   , but they decided to bring my order in plates one by one and then gave me boxes and told me to pack it myself... there was soup in bread bowl, Brussels sprouts , mushroom appetizers avocado rolls, and when we asked the waiter how do I pack this bread bowl? And he goes aaaaammmm ummmm.. so do u still want it??  And then there was no sauce for Brussels sprouts, I had to walk to the kitchen to ask for it. Avoid this particular Bjs."
Carl C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,29,9,3.0,4/16/2017,"BJs seems to be the place to be! A very large restaurant with an even larger menu to match! There always seems to be a line at this place no matter what day of the week or time of the night! With a huge variety of drinks and food items, I can understand the huge draw to a place like this.  Service was great on the two nights we came to eat when it came to ordering. But when it came to receiving what we ordered, it always took what felt like just 5 minutes too long.  Every round of drinks and every meal that was brought out created an uncomfortable feeling of ""are we going to get what we ordered soon"" type of feeling. It's too bad that BJs will get this reputation, but it seems to be par for the course as it happened on two separate occasions with different servers at different times of day.  Food drinks 4/5.  Service 2/5"
Manuel A.,"Alhambra, CA",2,11,5,5.0,4/15/2017,"Thank you Vivian for helping us out , youre guest service is spectacular ! Many people need to pearn on how to be the same way , thanks management for hiring someone outgoing like Vivian"
Lauren C.,"West Covina, CA",136,12,1,1.0,6/25/2017,My pizza barley had any cheese and my Brussels sprouts were burnt. Fire the cook please!
Ty E.,"West Covina, CA",37,9,,2.0,8/28/2017,"My experience was not good at all, to much to share, cold rib eye, dry potato with nothing on it or on the side, totally dry asparagus. Had to wait for ever for everything else including a beer and other drinks and to top it off horrible service over all, waiters get cocky, etc.  If you have to complain and ask more than 3 times for something it's not fun anymore. Bj's is not what it used be a few years ago not only the West Covina location but I had the same experience at Montebello location quality of food and service is very low."
Solomon K.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,10,,1.0,3/20/2017,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT COME HERE.  So this is my first time at BJs. Chose this place over yard house. Biggest mistake I've made in my life. Servers aren't chill. There's a reason why it's so low ratings
Lisa K.,"Baldwin Park, CA",5,11,14,2.0,6/10/2017,"This review is on reservations only: Called mid week to make a reservation, spoke to the scheduler and was assured that we had a set reservation for 1pm on Saturday. Came in today Saturday at 1pm and no reservation under my name. Had my whole family here waiting and still currently waiting...this is inexcusable. Can't have 20 people driving around looking for a new place to eat but so wish we could.  Training needs to be better and I hope that whoever this guy who answered there phone at 11:50am on June 8th is let go or seriously retrained. Don't want to here how sorry you are. Actions speak louder than words."
