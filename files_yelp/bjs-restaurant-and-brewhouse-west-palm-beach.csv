Kristen A.,"Boston, MA",0,47,10,4.0,12/18/2017,"Had a superior visit to BJ's this time! The food menu has been expanded to include some clever and tasty dishes that appeal to all diners, including vegetarian and gluten-free folks. Lucky to snag two seats at the bar, we each got a beer flight and a snack. We both loved the in-house Pale Ale, I think it was called Piranha, and the Green Flash West Coast Double IPA. Snack #1 was so good I am going to try to duplicate it at home - the Turmeric-Roasted Cauliflower, which was wonderfully spiced not just with turmeric but also cumin, paprika, and some chili powder. It came with perfectly cooked red lentils and crunchy roasted slivered almonds. Just awesome! My friend reported that Snack #2 was excellent - the Couscous Mac'n'Cheese. (It's gluten-free, but she isn't, she just thought it sounded great.) It comes with bacon, tomatoes, and lots of cheese, and it vanished as quickly as my cauliflower. The service is super-friendly and professional. I love the atmosphere. I don't know about table service, as the bar is the place to hang IMO."
Trinity A.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,41,7,1.0,1/4/2018,"Love this place in Las Vegas but here in West Palm Beach WOW HORRIBLE ....  extremely slow wait staff.  Repeatedly asked for water, dessert, and check.  Under cooked food and pizza then after ""fixed"" Over cooked steak  Will NOT be back and would NOT recommend."
Joe B.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,1,,2.0,12/28/2017,"Went to BJs this evening Thursday Dec 28,2017 My wife read off the menu and asked for a Bacon cheeseburger for under $10.00 was told that Item was no longer available.  We both ordered a Blond beer , was also told that they were out of blond. I ordered fish and chips and asked for cocktail sauce for the fish and was told they didn't have any. That's three items they did not have in one sitting. If the items in question weren't available why were they not removed from the menu. Or told so right off. Afraid there's many more better places  to dine without all the negatives. JB"
Quintella J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",141,85,197,4.0,12/8/2017,"BJ's restaurant was pretty darn good and they offer daily specials which we greatly appreciate.  I got a great five dollar cocktail. our waiter name was Omar he was not only handsome but he was a great waiter he was very prompt, friendly and made great recommendations we had the deep dish pepperoni pizza can I tell you all type of amazing it was so good!!! I would highly recommend the pizza and we also ordered the Sriracha queso of which was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant for any party size, age and food desire because the menu options are endless and the atmosphere is bar/dine in with a laid back but nice feel and not to mention the location couldn't be better ( its right next to the Palm Beach Outlet. Great Prices!!  Go ahead and give it a try!!!"
Kitana L.,"North Miami Beach, FL",119,5,18,3.0,12/28/2017,"I like this place, I come here often. Close to home, open late. Very convenient. But tonight, I ordered for takeout and got home to this... Burnt corn dog and yucky looking fruits :( where are the rest of the fruits?! Looks like someone ate some already. Very disappointed."
Erica J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",13,99,97,5.0,11/11/2017,"First time I have heard of this place, was when I went to Orlando for the parks. The atmosphere is casual with a beer theme. This time around I did the soup and salad combo. I loved my bread bowl with the chicken tortilla soup and salad was mozzarella and tomato. Great service and food."
Jeff P.,"Sandwich, MA",0,30,7,4.0,12/16/2017,Our second time here.  Food and service were good.  We had the arugula and beet salad and the California Flat Bread.  Both were fresh and came out quickly.  Our server Lauren was attentive.  Hostess was also friendly.  Plenty of TV's to watch a game.  Drink prices a bit steep.
Sam V.,"West Palm Beach, FL",29,2,10,5.0,12/2/2017,"Great as always! Our waitress Brielle was fantastic drinks never got below half without her being here asking for a refill. Food was as expected, great food great service, this place is a must stop if looking for a well cooked American meal."
Adam B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,14,,1.0,11/29/2017,"Decided to go back after the response to my complaint on here.  IT WAS WORSE.  The food was disgusting and a tiny amount.  Upon speaking with the manager we got into an argument due to his heavy handed style and when I asked to pay and leave he told me ""he didn't want my money and to get out before he had me escorted out""   There was even a witness at the bar to all of this. KEEP THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS DISGUSTING PLACE They have made an enemy of me....for life."
Rabia J.,"Boynton Beach, FL",2697,672,2144,3.0,11/11/2016,"One word to describe BJ's is that it is ""decent."" Nothing special yet nothing horrible either.  They seemed a bit over whelmed on election night with the sitting.  Surprisingly we found bar seating with the high top tables near the tv. Our server seemed crazy busy but took our order promptly when we said we were ready.  After ordering and getting the food he didn't come to check if we needed anything. we only flagged him down when we needed the check to pay for our meal at the end.  My friend and I only got appetizer and desserts since I had eaten a late lunch and was not hungry.  Their guacamole and chips was mediocre but had a good kick to it.  Their dessert did not disappoint , many dessert options in their menu.  I would recommend getting the trio of the pizooki desserts. They are known for their pizooki dessert and if you have never eaten it before it is a cookie almost like a pizza cookie.  They bake it, I'm assuming in a tin baking circular plate.  They have many flavors but we got chocolate, salted Carmel, cookies and cream.  Our favorite was chocolate.  All three came with a scoop of ice cream which tasted really good.   Overall I would try them again but to eat main course and dessert.  And maybe not sit in the bar area to get good service.~"
Mario-luc R.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,22,14,5.0,9/15/2017,"Best service ever "" Sharon B "" usually the service A 2star but this girl can make you feels like you are important and takes good care of her clients !ask for her and you will see what I give 5 Stars service Nice mozzarella and tomato excellent clams chowder soup ( did not like the Lentil soup ) it was a good lunch experience thank you Miss Sharon B"
Adriane P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",19,9,14,4.0,12/5/2017,Great place to grab a quick bite!! Love the atmosphere craft beer selection is great ! And food never disappoints!
Bea D.,"Wellington, FL",1,30,20,2.0,11/26/2017,"I've eaten at this BJ's location 5-6 times, and the food prep continues to decline. I would love to show you a picture of my quinoa bowl with blackened chicken that ordered on Wed. night, unfortunately the quinoa was missing (replaced by cold brown rice) and my chicken was grilled. Turns out my dinner companion got my blackened chicken. Looked and asked for our waitress, she came 15-20 later, asking, ""how's it going, everything good?""  I said no, told her my little tale of woe, she followed up by asking if we wanted dessert. No Thanks! She brought the bill, she's discounted my dish by $7.95. Great,but what I wanted was the quinoa bowl I had last year, that's still on the menu, but that the kitchen no longer seems able to recreate. SUGGESTIONS:  reduce menu selections, get better managers, and fire the kitchen staff and start over."
Steve B.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,8,3,3.0,7/25/2017,"I eat and drink her often. Generally the food is terrific. Tonight was a horrible exception. Three weeks ago I had stopped in for dinner. I had been eyeing their chicken parmesan with broccoli. Evidently I was not the only one. They ran out. Now I really wanted it. So a week later I go back. But now the boneless chicken wings caught my eye. After several rounds of eenie, meenie, minee mo  I ordered the wings. So tonight finally the chicken parmesan and some nice broccoli.  My goodness it was terrible. When the expediter brought it out I couldn't wait. But even before it was in front of me the bartender had noticed the wilted olive drab broccoli and he ordered a side for me. But alas the chicken was way overdone and dry. The parmesan was DARK brown not the light golden depicted. The chicken looked like it had been pressed and it had been cooked until dry and chewy. The meal comes with two sizeable pieces. I ate little more than half of one. I had to make a  serious effort with my knife. I had expected to cut it with my fork. And I believe if cooked properly I could have. I am adding a picture. Note the original broccoli as compared to the piece from the side. The really sad part about this besides my disappointment was that this excuse for dinner should have been intercepted by the cook, can't call this guy a chef,  or by the expediter. I applaud the bartender for trying to make things good.  I had two drinks. One while waiting and the other with dinner. My bill was $58.00 plus tip. Come on folks you can do better. I know I have seen it."
Jesse P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,1,1,5.0,12/2/2017,Once again this place never ceases to amaze me. Food was quick coming out and spot on in taste. 1 pound of wings for the price is a steal when they taste is as good as the picture. Service was quick and courteous.  I chose a beer they brew an was pleasantly surprised how flavorful it was. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.
Trinity M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",60,29,39,4.0,8/28/2017,It was really good. We got the mini pizzas during the happy hour and then the Pizookie Trio. We got the pizzas half off since it was happy hour and originally it would've been $12 which is kind of crazy because it was a mini pizza which shouldn't even be more than $5. But they were good. No better than a deep dish pizza from Pizza Hut. Our waitress was really nice and very low key but not the forget about you low key. We got to enjoy each other without being interrupted.  It was a typical chain restaurant but the food was still good. And the Pizookies were REALLY good.
Sonia P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",122,60,62,3.0,11/6/2017,"Wish I knew about this place sooner. Cheap good food! Will definitely be back! I'm writing this review kinda late, so don't remember the exact wordings of the menu items. But we had the Wisconsin cheese bites for an appetizer, it was decent. Had a flight of beer, and all of them were pretty good!  Only disappointing item was the desert, we ordered some churro pizzookie thing. It was lame! Was dry and no flavor. The menu was pretty big, so I'd love to come back and try other items."
Nee Nee E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,6,,1.0,10/21/2017,"Spent $50 for lunch for 2 people and all we got was 2 beers, a grilled ham & cheese sandwich with 1 thin slice of ham that looked like it was off the under 12 kiddie menu and an insultingly small burger with about 10 French fries. In addition, the service was awful. Our drink glasses were left empty for at lease 15 minutes and our server never came and asked, ""How is everything?"" so we were left with an empty catsup bottle on the table and no catsup and dry glasses. So sad, since we live less than 10 minutes from here, but I think all they are concerned with are tourists coming off I95, not caring if they ever come back again. Will never go back!"
Vivi T.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,67,196,3.0,4/8/2017,"Typical chain restaurant. It's the same quality as Applebee's, but a little more expensive.  The restaurant was clean, service was a little off, but no big deal.  Food was mediocre. Nothing to rave about. There's not a whole lot to talk about. It was just plain. Edible. Salmon tacos were plain. No seasoning on the salmon. Disappointed by this one."
Jeffeory H.,"Miramar, FL",44,537,475,4.0,4/3/2017,Dropped in for a quick bite to eat and to avoid the Miami traffic nightmare.   The service was fast and friendly.  Happy hour was going on so half priced apps.  Started off with the egg rolls and they were good.  I think the bargain made them that much better (LOL).  I ordered a burger and fries and it came out hot and fresh.  Not sure what happened but somehow they forgot to put the mayo on the burger but that was easily corrected.
Deone W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,40,5,2.0,8/10/2017,"Uch!!! I have no idea why anyone thinks this place is good.   I can buy the same frozen food they serve at the grocery store.  I only gave it two stars because of the waiter (he should quit and go somewhere else).   First of all the restaurant smells moldy, I know it's a Florida problem but the bathroom was filthy.  Someone can easily pick up all the paper towels on the floor.   I ordered the ""Super Food Salad"" it was ridiculous, all of the items that were supposed to be in it were not (I'm guessing they don't think people actually read  the menu).  We ordered the Pot Stickers and the Stuffed Mushrooms, both were on par with my microwave version at home.   So that's about it.  Save your money."
George Gman F.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",16,53,46,4.0,10/24/2017,"They brew their own beer, and its always delicious.  The prices are ok, a little on the high side for quantity of food you get. The food is good though, so you get what you pay for.  I come here for the beer selection, and my wife loves the desserts"
Ronaldo G.,"Jupiter, FL",309,32,270,4.0,3/14/2017,BJ's is one of the best new chain restaurant/brewpubs to come along on recent years.   It's beautifully designed and reminds me of the early days of Cheesecake Factory. Everything we have been served has been tasty and well executed.  Of special note is their Poke appetizer.   Awesome.   They take their beer seriously and offer alot of ways to sample them.  From free tasters to flights (multiple mini glasses of their brews)... very impressive.  The only reason why they didn't get 5 stars....service.   They are still working out staffing kinks..but I'm definitely going back for more!
Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1173,285,4.0,12/15/2016,"My daughter and I stopped into this place on a very recent trip to Florida...not even realizing it was the chain until after we sat down (we've been to the one in Towson, MD a number of times).  This location is really set up nicely with high open ceilings, lots of TVs, and a lot of space.   We were seated quickly and asked for drink orders - they didn't have the craft beer I wanted so I ordered the BJs Nut Brown Ale (not my favorite ever, but a very solid beer).  My daughter was starving (after three days of field hockey) so we started with an appetizer of Margherita Fresca flatbread which was phenomenal - I'm becoming a bigger fan of these flatbread appetizers.  We also both ordered Caesar salads which were your standard, but nice - crisp lettuce, crunchy croutons and not too much dressing. For our meals my daughter ordered Chicken fingers and fries (wedge/steak fries) and I ordered the Fried jalapeño burger and fries (thin fries).  It's pretty hard to screw up chicken fingers and they certainly didn't here at BJs...my daughter loved them and the fries nice sized portions of both.  My burger, which I ordered medium came out well done, but was still tasty...and juicy actually.  It's a pretty big burger, especially after a salad and appetizer, so I actually didn't finish it...well, to be honest I needed to leave room because my daughter was 100% going to order the trio Pizzookie's!   If you've never had a Pizzookie you need to give it a shot.  Cookies cooked in a small deep dish pizza tray and topped with ice cream...SO good...and I'm sure they are good FOR you as well!  We ordered the Salted Caramel, the Triple Chocolate with Ghiardelli and the Chocolate Chunk.  I may have left some of my burger on the table...but my dogs wouldn't have been able to lick this dessert tray any cleaner. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is it drives me nuts when you have a beer menu and you don't update it when you no longer have the beer...or AT LEAST let the wait staff know what isn't available on a given night.  Additionally, while our service was fairly quick, our waitress never came back to check on us or refresh our waters or ask if I wanted another beer until 10 minutes after we were done eating our entrees...and then it took another 15 minutes after we finished dessert to get the check.  So the service was a little mixed...otherwise the meal was great and I would MUCH rather go to a BJs than one of the local chain places up in Northern NJ."
Alyson C.,"Rye, NY",0,11,,4.0,10/7/2017,"Went in for happy hour after work. The whole restaurant was packed and we were not able to sit at the bar. We ordered a bunch of apps- including the Brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and calamari. Everything was great!  Our sever was attentive and the cookies we ate for dessert were out of this world. I'm not sure why there is such mediocre ratings. Would definitely come back!"
Francois M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",8,48,137,1.0,7/20/2017,Omg I got the ahi salad  ate most of it and realized a long hair was wrapped around the tuna oyeee
Jon M.,"Belle Vernon, PA",0,4,1,4.0,12/2/2017,First timer at BJ's. The beer selection was excellent and the fish tacos were very good.
Shair V.,"Uniondale, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/3/2017,"Terrible service. Attitude attitude attitude. Dirty table, dirty cutlery, dirty dishes -- which we had to ask for 3 times. If there was a place nearby that was still open we Would have walked out. This is the 2nd time this place is a health code epidemic waiting to happen."
Ryan W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,18,,5.0,10/2/2017,"Amazing! I haven't had anything bad. The staff is rather friendly as well. Just promise me one thing when you go there...GET THE MONKEY BREAD! It's literally the best desert I've ever had in my life. I don't know how, but it literally melts in your mouth. It's worth going solely for the monkey bread. I promise"
Crystal B.,"Harvey, LA",2,44,106,3.0,7/3/2017,"First timer and completely underwhelmed and my 3 stars goes to my server Ben, not the food, that'll be zero stars. Had lunch with a friend here and there's a plethora of selections, which is probably why the food isn't that good. I mean I like the concept but this just didn't work for me.  Ordered guacamole and chips for an appetizer and it was old, tasteless and lumpy. You can tell it was pulled from the back of the fridge so we opted to have the chips with salsa. I ordered the flatbread pizza and it was so so. I won't be back to this establishment here or anywhere else for that matter. Perhaps other choices may have been better as they looked good on the menu.  I started to get the mahi mahi tacos but changed my mind.  Shoot!"
Nichole H.,"Bristol, VA",0,4,,5.0,9/26/2017,"Excellent food (we had the meat lovers pizza, pan crust), excellent home brews and excellent service. Would absolutely return!"
Kayla F.,"Roswell, GA",121,25,28,5.0,4/25/2017,"BJ's Brewhouse is my favorite restaurant to go to while traveling. There are endless options for vegans and vegetarians, as well as gluten free options! I love the Superfood Salad and Vegan Lentil soup. I also always order a vegan veggie pizza, veggie burger and plain baked potatoes. Happy Hour is amazing!! The front desk/greeter wasn't very inviting and didn't look up once from her computer or phone. The service was great otherwise!!"
Jennifer F.,"West Palm Beach, FL",54,8,2,1.0,9/21/2017,We have been to this restaurant about 7-8 times for dinner and had a descent experience until tonight! We both ordered Ribeyes medium rare when they came out one medium and one was medium well and there was an excessive amount of black pepper on both. I returned mine and asked for a medium deep dish pizza instead which by the way ended up costing $22 bucks! My spouse ate 2 bites of steak and left the rest. I had to return my salad because it was half rotten! We tried the beignet for desert and it was definitely out of the microwave and tasted terrible! All this disgusting food and the bill was $75 bucks! I will never ever go to this establishment again and I'm warning you not to go because now I'm home with diarrhea! This place sucks!
Brad B.,"Sandpoint, ID",0,2,,5.0,11/22/2017,This place always hits the mark... its not just brewhouse food their prime rib is amazing and my wife had a pork chop with bacon jam that was awesome... Great beer selection as you would expect. Service is usually pretty good as well
Joe H.,"Boynton Beach, FL",331,96,182,5.0,3/28/2017,"BJ's is my favorite Brewhouse in the West Palm Beach area. They have ample parking outside so you have no problem finding a spot when you arrive. The dining area choices are perfect as they have a good sized dining room area and they have a large bar with lots of high tops available so you can have some beer and watch the game. Speaking of the game, BJ's has a LOT of TV's for the sports enthusiast. Behind the middle of their bar (up high) they feature a block of 4 large HD TV's with different games on each TV. There are a few more tv's on that wall and tv's throughout.  Onto the beer. BJ's has their own beer selection from their brewery (the WPB location's beers are brewed in Texas) and has a great menu describing them in great detail. They also have a great craft beer selection to go along with their offerings so there is something for any beer lover. The food selection is what is really impressive at BJ's. They have a section of their menu called ""Enlightened Favorites"" and they list the calorie content of the dishes for all of these selections. This section of their menu in beyond impressive with bison burgers, turkey burgers, vegetarian tacos, barbacoa cauliflower tacos, peanut chicken with soba noodles, salmon tacos, quinoa bowls, and many salads including a seared ahi tuna salad. Having such an amazing selection of healthier fare truly sets BJ's apart from the competition.  I got the Barbeque Bison Burger which comes with lean, ground buffalo, boldly seasoned then grilled to order. Topped with chipotle BBQ sauce, seared green chilies and pico de gallo and served on a toasted bun with Baja sauce, red onions and lettuce. It is served with tangy slaw tossed with Baja vinaigrette and topped with green onions. The flavor is literally bursting from each bite.  Bj's also has a rewards program that I signed up for while there and an accompanying app. You get a free Pizookie (baked cookie dessert) for signing up and 1 point for every dollar you spend. You get $5 off for every 75 points you accumulate.  On a scale of 1-10 for Brewhouse's I give them a solid 10. Their beer selection is awesome and their food offerings are unparalleled. If you are in the area I would definitely give them a try you wont be disappointed."
Leisa D.,"Boynton Beach, FL",1,4,5,2.0,9/22/2017,"Six women celebrating a bday. Not our first time doing this. Terrible experience. Service sucked. Desserts even were a large disappointment. Pizzookies over cooked could barely scrape out of pan. Food, burger good, everything else so so.  Had to go find someone to get plates etc while things cooled off etc. Please get it together."
Emma F.,"Boynton Beach, FL",38,33,9,1.0,2/23/2017,Food was okay. Love the berry beer. Service was horrible. Server blame hostess for forgetting silverware after we sat there with our appetizers for 10 minutes with no silverware. Server was busy chatting right behind us and didnt acknowledge us when we tried to wave at him. He obviously doesnt wanna be there and does his job that day. Will not be back
John K.,"High Point, NC",20,7,26,3.0,7/11/2017,"Disappointed in my latest visit. I first came to BJ's after it opened a while back. It is was GREAT (back then). The service was OUTSTANDING (emphasis should have been on WAS). Food is good ""pub food"" and reasonably priced. Our experience today was under par. We were seated on the small patio (not heavily used) but my wife likes to eat in the fresh air. We were seated right away and our orders taken. Food was served promptly (and was good) but that was the last time I saw our server. Poof. Gone. I had planned on ordering another drink but after waiting 15 mins we decided to just get our check and leave. Another 5 mins... no server. We when to the hostess stand in the front to try to pay but our hostess was taking an order from a table four 4, but the amount of time spent was more like a table of Twenty. Another 8 mins and we finally got our check.  I asked to speak to the manager. He listen, but honestly his response was ""I really don't care.""  An amazing 180 degree change from the management a couple years ago.  If service matters, let this be a warning.  Bottom line.... good pub food but service now sub par."
Maryanth B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",1,3,,1.0,2/24/2017,"WORST BJS EVER!!!!!!  HORRIBLE STAFF! GET NEW ONES! ones that care! who aren't rude, the food is always cold, the drinks suck! apparently these people couldn't make a frozen drink if their life depended on it, bartenders need to take some classes.  OVERALL THIS PLACE BLOWS. The bjs in down in pembroke pines and miami rock. Tables are always dirty at this place too, just the people dont give a shit about anything. For the prices it's not even worth it."
Devon F.,"West Palm Beach, FL",87,48,268,5.0,9/4/2016,"What's not to love with BJs? That's the real question. The atmosphere is always fun, down to earth and well put together! The service is top-notch, the beer selection is outstanding (even though I ALWAYS recommend BJs signature brews), and the food is great! I recommend a blonde or hefeweizen, with a California Club flatbread, add some pepperonis and you're golden! ... and get the chocolate chip cookie w ice cream on top for dessert.  Thank me later!"
