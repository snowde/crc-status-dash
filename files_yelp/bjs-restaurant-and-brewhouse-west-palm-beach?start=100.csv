William L.,"Frankfort, KY",0,2,,2.0,2/6/2017,"This is the second Brewhouse I have visited in the last week. As other reviews have noted, it isn't unique and each restaurant is virtually identical based on my limited experience.  There is a good selection of beer but nothing special to separate it from many other chain restaurants. The food was average at best. The salmon was overcooked and the pizza was soft and chewy. (Not bad if you like it that way). We were there in the early evening and the rooms were filled with TVs but few people. Since we couldn't avoid watching we asked to change a channel on one TV to a non-Fox news station since they were reporting exclusively and repetitively on the many incidents demonstrating how unfairly President Trump is being portrayed including a story on national news about a grade school boy who was bullied for wearing a Trump ball cap. ( who would have thought grade school bullies are politically motivated? ) Regardless,  the restaurant manager refused the request to provide any alternative to Fox news. Moreover,  the food was mediocre and the news provided was comical. The service was excellent and provided the basis for 2 stars."
Alex G.,"Lake Worth, FL",116,117,363,4.0,5/31/2014,"Considering they have only been open 2 weeks and I have been in twice I'd say it's a solid 4 stars. Service was great each time and although they forgot my order on the second visit they made up for it and that's all most customers are looking for. Mistakes happen but if management takes the time to address the issue and make sure you are satisfied then what's to complain about. I've been to other BJ's so the menu was not new to me. I'd say you can't go wrong with the burgers and the pizza is awesome! Even the small can feed a crowd! The spinach dip is so so... it's more cheesy then creamy and needs a tad more spinach in my opinion. The avocado egg rolls are really tasty and I love that they cut them small so it's perfect to share with a group.  Pizookie!!!! Get the trio, you can thank me later :) Fresh baked warm cookie with vanilla ice cream. You will not want to share. The salted caramel is divine and the double chocolate is so sinfully delicious! I want one now. Not only do they have a great selection of their own beers and many more but their cocktail menu is very impressive. I've tried a bunch of their own beers but the Tatonka Stout is by far my favorite. Dark, rich and thick. Pure heaven! I highly suggest calling a head and putting your name on the wait list before you arrive. Since it's located by the new Outlets it tends to be really busy and the bar seems to be a very popular hangout.  I'm sure I'll be back again since they offer a great rewards program and I'm already racking up the points!"
Jilli C.,"Miami, FL",11,22,2,2.0,6/3/2015,"Service here is slow and unapologetic.   Was seated instantly but then waited for 25 mins for someone to even identify themselves as our waiter and bring a glass of water.  When the waitress did arrive i mentioned we had been waiting 25 mins to at least hear from a server and she shrugged and said, ""oh they were supposed to greet you."" Such grace. When the cold, bland soup came, the spoon had the last diner's left over broccoli on it and it took 10 mins for me to receive a replacement.   If the service was lax the food certainly was no redeeming quality.The pizza we ordered was absolutely terrible.  I was sauce-less (but supposedly a deep dish???) and tasted like it was microwavable.  Digiorno is gourmet in comparison.  The soup tasted like some gravy substance and promptly gave me indigestion (and i've a cast-iron stomach). In conclusion, i predict that this location will be closed in a year and rightfully so."
Brian H.,"Apex, NC",56,6,,3.0,8/23/2016,"Service was good, food was okay. I've been to BJ's before and thought it was good. Maybe I wasn't feeling it."
Lisa L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,41,1,2.0,7/27/2016,"Disappointed on a  2nd visit. We visited 2 years before and had a good experience. Came here with the family and was disappointed. All the pages of the menus were greasy. As I watched the 4 young employees by the hostess stand, they were all chatting like it was social hour. As our ice teas were refreshed, our waitress neglected the ice part until we asked for it. Our children's dinners came out within 4 minutes, where as for us, it took over 20 minutes for salads. Our waitress apologized for the wait but no manager in sight. We'll think twice before coming back."
Mike-Heraclito G.,"Hialeah, FL",63,53,97,2.0,2/14/2016,I went with my mom and we ordered a full rack of ribs and a steak.. Taste burn flavor in both..!!
Lauren H.,"Orlando, FL",0,14,6,5.0,8/9/2016,"Went to a surprise birthday dinner with my husband and all I can say is I definitely will be back to this restaurant. I started off with a strawberry margarita, which was to die for. After my margarita, I then had the baked ziti, which was delectable. The mix of cheeses that were on top of the pasta and meats were divine, and the seasoning on the meats were just right. I loved the fact that the cheese on top was baked and nicely broiled to add a few touches of crispiness to the cheese. I literally ate the entire meal with no leftovers to spare. The customer service was top notch which was very surprising considering the fact that we had a party of 18, and the manager came over several times to make sure our meal was going great. I will definitely be visiting when I come back to palm beach, and I will visit the one in Orlando as well!!"
Lu L.,"Boston, MA",0,36,28,1.0,8/9/2016,"I've been to other BJ's before but this was the one that's had the worst customer service. I placed an order to go (cheese & tomato, small, basic). When I arrived (albeit I admit that I arrived 15-20 minutes later than the time they gave me, but that shouldn't matter!), the woman behind the bar asked me what I was picking up and I told her. She responded that someone already picked it up and asked if I was sure I didn't order another pizza. No, I didn't, I know what I ordered. So, they put in another pizza and I waited. Another waitress brought out my order and didn't even acknowledge me. I asked if that was the cheese & tomato pizza and she just nodded and gave it to me. I know it's late at night but you're still open so customer service should not be thrown out the door. Very disappointed. And the pizza wasn't even that good. Too salty for my taste."
Michelle G.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,79,26,4.0,10/12/2015,"I give this place a four star .... Great food ! Great staff ! Knowledgeable! How ever all of our food came at about room temp. Nothing was hot we got the stuffed mushrooms, roast beef dip and BBQ platter other than it was tasty and fresh"
Kayde J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",491,7,,2.0,8/1/2016,I eat here a lot and it's usually pretty good. But tonight sucked. The calamari was cut so thick it was unappetizing. I got my salad after my pasta. The server was nice but other than that the overall experience sucked.
Allison T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",134,63,138,4.0,6/8/2015,"Been here a few times in the past few months and it's always an exciting ""Yes!"" when I suggest we go there to my boys. They have an extensive drink menu with reasonably priced alcoholic beverages including their homemade and other popular craft beers. They have ridiculously delicious non-alcoholic drinks like peachberry tea, homemade root beer and cream soda - seriously everything we've tried has been soo good. The food is really yummy- we love their deep dish pizzas and small bites to share. The salads are huge and filling. The parmesan crusted chicken is my boyfriend's favorite, it literally melta in your mouth. The desserts look delectable but we've never had enough room after we eat to try any of them.  The servers are really great but when this place gets slammed, I'm not sure anyone who hasn't worked in the service industry would notice it. Your best bet is to try to go during off hours or you will definitely be waiting because it's no secret this is one of the best places to eat in the area."
Jeffrey M.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",1,14,,1.0,3/2/2016,"Total joke on service. Ordered drinks, waitress comes back and says we are out of a specific wine so wants to give my wife a more expensive one and not cover the cost difference. The place has been open for business for one hour and this waitress doesn't know what's on the 86 list ..... lol Yup we left !!!!"
Brock J.,"Jupiter, FL",0,35,,1.0,6/13/2016,"Sad it's such a good restaurant in other areas. This location is awful. The management and service is a joke. I have been to this location a few times since its opening. Every time it seems to be less busy and worse service. Ten people at the bar not even one bartender to be seen. Took me as one person an hour and 45 minutes to eat lunch while plenty of excess staff chatting it up in the waiting area. They seem to be having a casual we don't care party in the waiting lobby along with rift raft that wasn't even eating at the restaurant, but playing rap music full blast on their cell phone. Pathetic management. Location has its issues but that's no excuse inside."
H P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",156,8,2,2.0,1/5/2017,food was so amazing! i wish i could give a five star review but the service was absolutely horrendous. we finished our entire meal without being checked on once by anybody. we wanted more drinks but were never given the opportunity to order. we had to flag down someone twice to send our server over. it felt like we were being blatantly ignored. what a disappointment ! with the right service this would be a definite 5 star review and amazing experience.
Melissa L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",142,10,,5.0,6/9/2016,"Love this restaurant! They have awesome lunch specials, great drinks and a huge variety of beer - they even brew their own. It's really good! Try a flight. All the food is amazing as well!!"
Julie H.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,10,3,1.0,12/30/2016,"Terrible service. 22 minutes for drinks, salad came before drinks. Appetizers came with food. Mixed up lunch sides. ManGer didn't seem to care. Comped our app but very unhappy."
Daniel L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",28,35,4,5.0,10/29/2015,Had lunch today. Real tasty pork sandwich. Wedged fries were great! Bbq sauce was great! My wife had the mushroom burger and loved it.. I tried a bite and was a perfect tasting medium cooked burger. Yum.. She liked my fries more than her skinny fries. Only issue was it was very cold inside. But went back a second time tonight and it was comfortable inside. I got a burger and it was real good.
Lucia D.,"Gravesend, Brooklyn, NY",62,303,2760,3.0,4/18/2015,The pizza was terrible. I got the deep dish make your own medium $20. The dough was slightly undercooked. The seasoned tomatoes were canned and no good. The toppings I could not find on the pizza and there was hardly any cheese The side salad was ok and the drinks were ok. Service was excellent.
Kim S.,"Madison, NJ",1,23,1,2.0,3/6/2016,"We came in hungry and ready to eat! Unfortunately my burger and fries came out cold after 30 minutes of waiting and then we waited another 15 minutes for it to reappear. I'm a server, my first instinct would have been to comp the burger, the server didn't even bat an EYE! He was the bartender and I hold those people in high esteem! So disappointed. It had potential but the manager dropped the ball. Go somewhere else!"
Greg B.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,4,4,2.0,12/19/2016,Not hyper critical and usually don't say anything. Came with my brother and his family along with my son and I. 3 of us decided to get the.large pizza since it was 1/2 off on Monday. Others ordered sandwich/ salad and my son ordered a burger medium rare. He wasn't eating and asked  what's up. He showed the very well done burger. Server was very gracious and accommodating. A new one would be out shortly. 5 minutes later out comes a burger more well done than the 1st. Asked for the manager and apparently another manager was expediting. I get mistakes happen  but when you refire something for being too done and send something out of the kitchen worse than the first one. Well that's when caring went out the window. Manager comped the uneaten burger and picked up one of the 2 desserts we ordered. Get the bill and notice the 3 half price pies rung up at full $25+ price. Servers didn't fail here management did. Several years in chain management experience  speaking.
