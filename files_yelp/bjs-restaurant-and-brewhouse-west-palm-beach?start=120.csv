Scott W.,"Lake Worth, FL",2,48,11,5.0,6/20/2015,"Ok, I can't give a bad review just because a lot of people have done so and after reading what people wrote I didn't know if I wanted to try it. The service was good and the food was very good. If there is anything to complain about it would be that it was ""Freezing "" inside. Damn! It was cold in there.  I had the jambalaya and it was spicy and delicious and we'll the desserts are in a league of their own. I will definitely be back."
Sandy T.,"Ballston Spa, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/3/2016,My first time here. The food was just average. As for the service I was not impressed. I don't think that I will be returning.
"West Palm Beach ,.","West Palm Beach, FL",200,58,1,1.0,10/1/2016,"I can't really review the food because the three times that I have been here, I have waited over 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server. Just plain ignored. I'm sitting at the table, and I have a menu in my hand and waitresses walking by and completely ignoring my presence. For 20-plus minutes. Third time's a charm. Got up and walked out of this restaurant for the third time for having not been waited on in a timely fashion. How embarrassing to bring people here and you cannot get waited on. I don't think that expecting a server to come up and ask me if I would like something to drink in the first 5 - 7 minutes of sitting down is too much to ask. But over 20 minutes? There's something wrong here. So no. I cannot rate the food. Only the service..... which stinks."
Pamela P.,"Lake Worth, FL",10,20,3,1.0,1/16/2016,"Food was terrible.  Service is slow, very slow. General manager is not fit to be a manager. My steak was over seasoned, fries were burnt. Talked to the manager to let him know I would NOT come back and he said sorry to hear that. Then as the manager is standing there he put his hand on my son's fries. WTF. Waste of money."
Michelle F.,"Jupiter, FL",13,21,9,2.0,2/21/2015,"Stopped in after a drive home from Pompano... . Greeted at the door and had drink at bar wonderfully...  Server was a delight. . It's always great to be told that ticket times are running long! Lol, but it's ok,  I'd rather know than to wait a day for food!  Ordered wedge salad... Nearly no bacon nor onion,  pitiful amount of Bleu cheese.. . Nacho app was decent. . Burger came out way overcooked and after approx an hour later I asked that it be packaged Togo... Not once did a Manger check in on the table. .  Our lovely server seemed to be a too apologetic as not any of the issues were her doing... She was wonderful.  Not once did management decide to visit table..  I would suggest that a management wake up happen. . The guest experience can almost always be saved if the guest understands they have value.  Will not bother to return."
T P.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,2,,1.0,4/27/2017,"My review is based on service only. We had a large party so we expect a delay on food. It was worst when time to pay. It took 20 min to cash out one check at a time. Our server cut checks without asking if we were done or wanted dessert, which we did. This is not an exaggeration, it took almost an hour for 2 pizookies, and that was after waiting more than 30 min to even order. We were last to leave so another server tried to saddle us with other ppl food. We were told there were 2 items (totaling $21) were not on because someone else paid for them. So in turn, they added 3 items (totaling $35) and told us it was equal. We did not pay. It should also be noted that not once did the manager, who walked by and stopped at several other tables, check on our party. There was only one server for our party for the longest. A 2nd server came later and it was her 1st day. This was my worst experience ever."
Rheaneen P.,"Lake Worth, FL",3,15,,3.0,3/14/2015,We have eaten here a few times but the last two times we have been greatly disappointed the service was horrible. We ordered soup this time and both spoons were dirty we had trouble getting anyone's attention it took 10 minutes by than the soup cold.(was eatable but cold non the less). I was going to only give 1 star but when our dinners came out they were hot and delicious. I believe the server saw me writing this review and became very attentive. I would hope that was not way but sadly I think it was.
Jeff R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",5,42,6,5.0,7/11/2015,Great bar food! Brisket burger the best. I ordered a second one just to be sure. Service also good. Never a bad meal here.
Danica D.,"Jupiter, FL",4,35,40,4.0,4/10/2016,"Stuff was amazing, Heather was great, welcoming , very cute and she took a great care of us. The food was okay, could have been better, beer delicious, and we had to wait very long for our dessert, but it was worth the wait."
Anthony D.,"Palm Springs, FL",4,13,,1.0,2/7/2016,"My girlfriend and I have a seat. Order an appetizer and a meal each. The appetizer comes and we have no silverware. We ask the waiter for silverware and he asked us how many do we want? I reply we  not planning on sharing so 2 set please. My girlfriend gets a flat bread pizza which was good. I get a portobello burger. The Burger is burnt ,I ordered it medium. The manager which is very nice comes out and apologizes and says they're gonna get me another one. The next burger comes out worse than the last one. This will be my last time at this establishment."
Hena A.,"Miami, FL",88,188,320,3.0,2/1/2015,"Christy was our server and she was on point. We ordered 3 appetizers: mini bruschetta, spinach stuffed mushrooms & carnitas fries with chili.  The bruschetta was gross and we found out it won't be on the menu much longer. The stuffed mug rooms were average and would have tasted better if they had not been drowned in pesto sauce.  However, the chili fries were fire and worth the calories.  Cool place to go too after shopping at the outlet mall.."
Anna S.,"Palatine, IL",0,16,21,1.0,8/7/2016,"One of the worst Happy Hour experience in all of West Palm Beach!!! I went with a friend to ""try out"" this place for their Happy Hour.  We arrived at 5:30. The bar was full so we chose a high top table in the bar area. The wait for a server was not long but the server was assigned to tables in the bar area and in the dining room-across the restaurant.  The happy hour option and prices are pretty lame. $3 for a glass of Barefoot wine! My fiend asked of martinis were on happy hour special. NOPE! So she ordered a lemon drop martini anyway. Not sure where the bartender learned to make it but if was horrible.  Bitter. Not sweet at all.  I should mention that I ordered a beer from their tap selection. I waited 10 mins for a beer.  Martinis was sent back as it was i drinkable. The appetizers are half off unless they are part of something or an exclusion.  Allot of rules for a happy hour. We ordered a flatbread. It was just ok.   We had to ask for silverware and plates. And we saw a lot of other servers that helped us get the new drink, plates and silverware. Only saw the server when the check arrived. Being be going back! Ever."
Kermit S.,"Greenville, SC",15,119,64,4.0,12/24/2014,"The food was good and so was the beer.  Two people in my party split a pizza and enjoyed it very much.  I ordered the bison burger and found it very flavorful.  I also had a bite of a turkey and ham on toast and it was delicious as well.   Avocado egg rolls and mozzarella sticks started things off and they were good choices.  The red ale was good as was their blonde ale. Service was slow but the place was packed from the moment we got there until the moment we left so it was understandable.   Overall, it was a good dinner!"
Ashley M.,"Los Angeles, CA",45,6,11,1.0,3/12/2016,"I've gone here a couple times and every time it's a hit or miss. Tonight was the worst I've ever experienced. For an appetizer we ordered the California Club Flatbread and it was just 'ok'. For a main dish I ordered the Shrimp and Asparagus Penne, which was pretty good except it only had 3 tiny shrimp in it. Then my mom ordered the Santa Fe Salad and added blackened shrimp. This is where everything started to turn south. Her 'blackened' shrimp were not blackened, instead they simply threw blackened seasoning all over her salad. Also the shrimp were SO over cooked that you could not eat them. After this mishap we decided to order a Salted Caramel Pizookie. When it came out and we were given the spoons to eat, 2 of the 3 spoons had food on them. I was floored by how unsanitary the utensils were. At the end of the night we enjoyed the Pizookie but will NEVER return here due to the poor experience and the lack of service that was provided, especially when a problem arose."
Carissa D.,"Jupiter, FL",24,13,,5.0,3/4/2016,Loved this place. Great food at great prices. Nice and spacious atmosphere. Huge selection to choose from. Can't stop talking about this place. Referring all my friends and family. Will be returning often.
Kim F.,"West Palm Beach, FL",627,97,67,3.0,10/20/2015,"I decided to stop in for a quick bite and to watch the end of the Miami game at the bar last Sunday afternoon. I had two drinks and a California flat-bread. The flat-bread was pretty good, the drinks were weak, the bartender almost non-existent (saw her talking to someone she knew down at the other end of the bar) but the GIANT TV's they have are awesome!!  Thankfully the bill was only $18 so I didn't feel too bad. So I gave it 3 stars but I will go again only because of the games on TV and..... the flat-bread."
Ashley M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",41,11,,4.0,2/22/2016,First few times I came  the service was lacking however that is expected until the kinks are worked out. I went to the one in Dallas  and loved it now I feel the one here in West Palm Beach has now reached the same level. I would highly recommend it to my friends.
Patty W.,"Lake Worth, FL",280,1063,1750,3.0,7/22/2014,"After the last visit, I wasn't sure if I was going to return again.  I received a credit and decided to stop in today to give it another shot.  The place was packed and we were seated promptly since I took advantage of the online ordering feature before hand.  The food and service was better this time around.  I enjoyed the grilled turkey ham bacon sandwich with a side salad I had to eat.  Of course, the Pizookie dessert is a must.  The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel was delicious.  Our waitress was friendly and didn't rush us at all.  I'm glad that it was a much pleasant experience than it was last time and my feedback was acknowledged by the restaurant."
James I.,"West Palm Beach, FL",46,67,3,1.0,5/29/2014,"We had a pretty bad experience at this location last week, which was unfortunate since we enjoy BJ's and were excited to have them opening in West Palm Beach.  I don't know if it was because it was their first/second week or whatever, but the service was an absolute mess. We were there for over two hours for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. We never dealt with our initial waitress. Many different people brought us food, got our refills, asked us if we needed anything, etc. The same meal we'd already received was brought to the table two or three times. Also, I ordered a buffalo burger - it was cooked well when I initially bit into it, but it was pretty much rare after that. It took forever to get a new one made, so I got to eat my food alone after everyone had been finished for a while. The manager came over to talk to us after all this and offered our party free desserts, but those took 20 minutes just to get to the table.  It definitely wasn't the experience I was hoping for. We'll give them another a shot, but it likely won't be for a while. I sure hope they improve."
Zac R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",217,39,54,2.0,11/25/2015,"I don't want to write a lengthy review because the experience was so bad that it's almost not worth the time. But I do want to give some feedback.  While the atmosphere at BJ's is good for groups or to watch sporting events I have had more bad experiences than good.  The food is average at best. The best meal I had were the lemon pepper dry rub wings. The flavor was decent and they were cooked well. Prior to that, I tried the chicken gyros and that was very dry plus and the chicken was overcooked. I only went back out of sheer circumstance.  Lastly, the service. This was the real downfall. The service was as bad as it could possibly be. From the server not showing up to the table until we had been there for 15 minutes, to an order being wrong - and then when we were ready to go it took an act of God to get the check. Not enjoyable at all. The kicker is that we had the same server both times so my woes were consistent.  Anyway, your luck could be better than mine but I have to say, beware."
