Floyd L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,1,,4.0,3/28/2015,Love this place the meals are reasonably priced and our waitresses  Simone  was great. .she had expert suggestions that were spot on..The TV kept the conversation going and the place was lively. The  jumbalya and calamari were delicious. Had and awesome
Karen B.,"Wellington, FL",0,6,,5.0,8/13/2016,"This was my 4th or 5th visit, two with groups of varying sizes.  Today was with three other couples.  Love the selection of food!  We want it all!  Our waiter was attentive and patient with our group of eight.  My turkey burger was just the right size and nicely seasoned.  My husband's classic burger also satisfied.  Everyone in our group was happy.  As it is a large place the acoustics can make conversation difficult.  With the larger groups it would have been nice to have a glass enclosed room that could be reserved.  But food wise, just keep up what you are doing."
Richard D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,1,,4.0,2/6/2016,Great eating spot. excellent service  . there chicken alfredo is amazing and there drinks are awesome I recommend the top shelf margarita my opinion it's drink on the menu
Jay H.,"Brandon, FL",2,2,,3.0,1/30/2016,"The food was fairly good, but the hostess was disinterested at best (she was actually rude to someone else as we were waiting to be seated) and the service was slow.  On the plus side their beer selection isn't bad and the Brussel sprouts were fabulous.  Perhaps things would improve with a new manager to shake the staff into shaped?"
ElizaBeth W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",56,132,29,4.0,5/20/2014,"We had the opportunity to eat at BJ's before they actually opened to the public. The location is very convenient - right off 95 and next to the new Palm Beach Outlets.  We had a reservation, so we were seated right away, but they do have a pretty large waiting area if you were to come when it was busy and without a reservation.  All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating - many members of the waitstaff stopped by our table to see how we were enjoying our experience and our meal. Our 9 month old twins were with us, which was another reason so many staff members stopped by. People can't help themselves when they see cute babies! Our meals were good! I had the Parmesan crusted chicken and I would definitely order it again! My husband had a bbq chicken pizza and he said it was good. We sampled a couple of BJ's beers. I had the Oasis Amber and my husband had the Goliath - both tasty beers! We didn't have time to try their famous Pizookie for dessert, but I definitely look forward to trying it when we return.  It's definitely worth mentioning that they have a free rewards program that you can sign up for before eating there at  . After signing up, I immediately got an email for a free Pizookie! Basically, with their rewards program, you earn 1 point for every dollar spent and you start earning rewards after you've spent $75. They also have convenient online ordering with options for dine in, take out, or curbside takeaway. The take out and curbside are pretty self-explanatory, but with their dine-in ordering you can place your order before you even arrive. They will go ahead and hold your spot on their wait list and then when you are seated the kitchen will immediately being preparing your meal. After the meal, you can even pay with your smartphone if you want. Pretty cool! Overall, this is a good family-friendly restaurant worth checking out before or after a day of shopping at the outlets."
John W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",81,34,1,1.0,11/27/2015,"The waitress spilled beer on a friend in my party, then the desert took 40 minutes. I complained to the manager and she did nothing but only apologized. Being in the industry I know mistakes happen, but she made no attempt to recover. She didn't comp the desert, or even the drink."
sebastian T.,"Boynton Beach, FL",102,14,430,4.0,5/21/2014,First time at a BJ's and the service was very nice. Menu has a lot of choices for all types of appetites. I will for sure be back to try the Pizookies that everyone who has tried one raves about.
Chad E.,"Jupiter, FL",0,1,,2.0,6/28/2016,Bring a game of monopoly to play as you wait for one of the four busy servers running around.  Completely forgot the starter salad. Food was surprisingly tastier than an Applebee's.
Donna D.,"West Palm Beach, FL",53,46,4,2.0,9/12/2015,Mediocre. For the cost of our dinner I would much rather head to Cityplace to comparable restaurants with better food.
Sarah E.,"Indianapolis, IN",5,4,,2.0,3/8/2016,"Service was slow and inattentive. I got the tomato bisque soup and half California flatbread... Both were fine, nothing was outstanding."
Donna F.,"Long Beach, NY",18,11,,1.0,3/5/2016,Food was horrible my girlfriend ordered the tuna salad had to send it back it was frozen I Ordered  a burger and fries in the burger I ordered it medium the burger was well done it was like a hockey puck it was disgusting my girlfriend ordered a hamburger and a baked potato in the baked potato must've been reheated at least 10 times one of us actually got a decent meal which was another burger would not recommend this to anyone
Jason M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,5,,1.0,3/9/2016,"The food and service was terrible. We had the boneless wings which looked and tasted like they were the frozen kind. They were so salty my wife only had one and I had a few of them. The salads we ordered came out first when in fact we ordered the wings first and the salads maybe 5min later. The wings came out about 30seconds after the salads. I had the wedge salad and my wife had the mozzarella & tomato salad; they were mediocre at best.  We tried one of there ""signature deep dish pizzas"" it tasted exactly like a Pizza Hut pan pizza! Lmao! Not to say that a Pizza Hut  pan pizza is terrible but this place appears to be slightly more upscale than a Pizza Hut. I waited 10min for my drink to be refilled and that was after asking, as if the dumb ass waitress couldn't see my empty glass sitting on the edge of the table!  Also in-between receiving our salad, then appetizer, then entree; our table was accumulating with dirty plates that we finally had to ask the person that delivered our entree to remove. Also when we received our salads the person delivering our food had to ask who had which item?! Really is it that fucking hard to read a ticket that says seat 1-X item seat 2-X item.... Obviously we will never be dining here again.  Cliff notes: If you are interested in getting pizza or wings from this place save yourself a few bucks and go down the street to Pizza Hut because what they serve here is exactly the same tasting shit."
Jason C.,"Orlando, FL",15,33,13,1.0,2/21/2015,Been here almost 30 minutes now & we haven't been offered any food...10 minutes before a beer. (It's super slow btw). Horrible service... just horrible. It's Feb 21 at 1045pm & I'm at the bar just in case this establishment needs to talk to their staff. Crazy.
Amy R.,"Warehouse District, New Orleans, LA",1,2,,1.0,1/16/2015,"I do not suggest eating here, the food took over an hour to get (for lunch) we had to ask a bus boy for lemons when the waitress forgot for the second time. The salads were limp and served in warm bowls. And finally the food was undercooked and greasy."
Holly C.,"Lake Worth, FL",2,2,,1.0,2/18/2016,"So I went there with family last Saturday at 2pm.  We got seated promptly in about 20 minutes and the waitress took our drink order rather quickly.  After that, it took quite some time for the waitress to come and take our order.  My brother tried to order something and was told he could not order that item since it is only available during the week, which we thought was strange, since if that were the case, shouldn't they use different menus on the weekends?  We waited close to 2 hours to get our food, which was cold and my brothers order was wrong (exactly what he didn't want), the waitress never came to check on us for us to tell her it was wrong or to even refill the drinks, so my brother ate it anyways, unhappily.  10 minutes into the meal, another group of servers come to our table with a duplicate order, except with my brothers correct order, but he had already eaten.  When the waitress delivered our check (first time we saw her after taking our orders) we told her about the mix up, she said: ""Well its a little late now, nothing I can do.""  What she should have done is gotten the manager and taken my brothers order off of the bill, but she did nothing.  We left and will never go back. Sorry, looks like a nice brewhouse, terrible service."
Jake H.,"Signal Hill, CA",0,5,,5.0,10/15/2015,"Got a full rack of ribs and a 5 meat deep dish pizza, was pretty expensive. But the quality is there, the toppings on the pizza tasted fresh and nice. And the ribs were to die for, better than the stuff I get at most BBQ places. Will visit agian!"
Edward B.,"North Aurora, IL",4,59,23,2.0,2/13/2015,"Great looking restaurant but the service, particularly from the bartender, Thomas C, is lousy. I would not return and sit at the bar if he was working."
Jessica C.,"Orlando, FL",85,33,25,4.0,6/6/2015,"This is my go-to restaurant if I want something fast & fairly inexpensive. Great place, food is pretty good & the staff there is great! Love the fact that they have a Loyalty Program, which you can update & use from your phone (not many restaurants do that)."
Scott S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",3,57,12,3.0,5/11/2015,"Not too bad. Drinks were a little on the pricy end ($10). 2 drinks ended up costing me more than my meal.   Food was decent, but not like a koala bear crapped a rainbow in your brain quality."
Jessie A.,"Dallas, TX",82,315,200,2.0,9/27/2014,I have never been a fan of BJs but came here for a group lunch while visiting. Meal was ok. Service was slow and they messed up my order which made it ecen slower.
