Karen R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,13,1,3.0,6/26/2015,Food was pretty good overall.  I had the brew house burger with cheese and bacon.  Was cooked perfect but lacked flavor. Everyone enjoyed the meal. But a bit too high in price for food and drink. Wait staff were very nice. Lighting could be a little brighter. Overall it was o.k. I would return but not in a hurry to.
Harley J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,3/27/2016,"Came in for a quick lunch with my boyfriend on Easter hoping to be in and out. We walked in the the greeters didn't even say hello, but yet she said "" all of our tables are dirty so you can wait or go up and seat yourself at the bar"" I wanted to say okay so go clean a table? While about half a dozen employees just stood around the restaurant. Instead we sat ourselves at a hop top. The salads were good, but the greeters are what set the tone coming in to a restaurant and they set a sour taste to start the experience. We will not return."
Kristine A.,"Miami, FL",41,116,18,2.0,3/7/2015,I've been here before and im usually very pleased. But this time around I have to say I was disappointed. The drinks were horrible. I sent my Long Island back because there was no way I was paying for lemonade. The new drink wasn't much better. But since I had waited 45 minutes for them to bring it and I had no water I decided I'll just drink it because I have nothing to wash my food down with. We came with a large group. When I saw my food come before the appetizer I cancelled the order but we still got it and paid for it. Then my check took forever to come and when it did the waitress got everyone's check wrong. Then we had to wait some more for it. When it came it wasn't even right but I didn't complain because they undercharged me.
Taylor B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,5,,2.0,3/21/2016,"The prices are decent. Food is okay, but not consistent. Service is usually horrible. Fun place to grab a quick bite to eat, but don't expect too much or else you will be let down."
Sam H.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,36,15,1.0,1/2/2015,"Deep pan pizza came out barely warm, asked server to reheat, but who really enjoys reheated pizza, could've done that myself.  Server was abysmal, asking if we wanted coffee or dessert when we were halfway through the rubbish pizza. A/c set to chilly, ridiculous in the Florida heat. Server was on a different planet.  Lots of draft beer choices, maybe a drink and app at the bar is as far as is good in this place."
Chase V.,"Lake Worth, FL",11,35,35,5.0,1/31/2015,"Great place for food and beer! I love coming to BJ's to try their different kind of craft beers. They have so many on tap and it is fun sharing beers with friends. My favorite is the pear cider. It is a refreshing beer with a wine after taste but not too sweet. I love coming here and getting the personal pizzas. I recommend getting the gluten free pizza crust because it comes out crunchy and taste like pizza on top of a French fry. It sounds weird but trust me, it's a great crust. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was really nice. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who hasn't tried one yet since it is new."
Oral B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",9,1,,5.0,1/31/2015,The atmosphere is amazing. The service is incredible and the food is excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has been here before. Wonderful experience
Meredith J.,"Delray Beach, FL",77,12,,1.0,6/27/2014,Can I give negative stars?? I waited 45 minutes at lunch and when I asked about my food they said they accidentally brought it to another table an I would have to wait another 15 minutes until they made me a new one. I got the flatbread and salad combo...1 hour for flatbread and salad? Seriously? And then they forgot the salad dressing. Terrible!! Run away!!
Judy K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,2/25/2016,"I've been to many pubs but this has to be the worst.  Service was awful.  Chicken sandwich came out tiny and dry.  Inedible.  Soup came out cold, but never saw a waiter to send back.  Manager finally came over and said he'd  make another sandwich and was sorry.   We asked for ketchup for the fries, but waiter took orders from another table.  He never came back.  I had to get up and look for a bottle of ketchup myself.  The staff has to be trained properly.  I will never go back to this BJ's but will never go to any of their restaurants."
Austin H.,"Lake Zurich, IL",1,4,,1.0,6/3/2014,"I am a culinary student and this place makes me want to scream at everyone. Let me explain, my visit was at 4pm on a Tuesday and they had wait staff standing around not cleaning off tables and chit chatting about their personal lives the wait staff was also unsure of what was available, you also have the bus boys talking trash about their fellow teammates in front of customers, and as we get right down to it the food... My boyfriend had a burger and said he could've gotten a better one down the street at McDonald's I however got the steak it was over cooked, dry, and seemed like it was rolled in pepper and salt. My father got a simple sandwhich and the lettuce was wilted along with the tomatoes. I suggest this place gets their shit straight before they get more bad remarks like mine. Be careful people this isn't just food this food is going in your mouth and through your body."
Greg G.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,7,2,5.0,1/2/2015,"Great service! Great food. Great atmosphere! Great value! What more can you say! Great balance, music wasn't too loud, nor too soft. All good."
Margie D.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,86,12,4.0,11/29/2014,"My first time eating at this restaurant was in Gainesville, FL and enjoyed the meals and service every time.  The first time we tried this location was a disaster.  Not sure if it was server's or cooks problem (newly opened).  Manager tried to make good but I ended up leaving hungry.  Went back a month later with family and service and food was good.  I love their meals so I will go back again.  I am giving 4 stars based on my Gainesville experience and hope WPB will live up to their reputation."
Lara R.,"Miami, FL",20,181,54,2.0,6/10/2014,"Food was just meh. The burger fell apart and the shrimp lettuce wraps didn't seem fresh and the lettuce was soggy. The place looks nice and they were very attentive, however, if I understand correctly they recently opened and this might change as they stay open longer."
Trina S.,"West Palm Beach, FL",257,109,61,3.0,7/23/2014,The service was decent. The staff was very nice. So that was a plus. But quite honestly the pizza tasted a lot like Pizza Hut. Nothing special. Our wait time was short. So no complaints. So if I do come back I may try a mixed drink & some appetizers.
Lydia C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,25,,3.0,2/6/2016,"As as a rare time the family can be together, of all ages, we are seated quicker than had been anticipated in a nice size booth for all the members.  Our server comes quickly for our drink order and that is where quick stops.  We do all get our orders for food placed then we wait and wait more.  This was mid-afternoon and the restaurant wasn't crowded at the time.  When the food arrives 35-45 minutes later with most of the table close to a meltdown at this point, our order comes out incorrect.  My husband gets a dish he isn't happy with since it is not what he ordered. Our server is not around at this point and our drinks show it, by the way.  So we make due with the food given to us.  Then servers show up with the actual order placed... Server apologizes for the mix-up once she arrives to give us our check.  No offer to check the price difference of the menu items, just ""I can't do anything now"". We paid , tipped as proper 20% and left, fed but not really happy with the experience."
Scott Z.,"Port Orange, FL",1,30,,2.0,11/8/2014,I've been to other BJ's where the quality of food and service was much better.  Is take a pass if you have an alternative... And you do of course.
Kristina D.,"Hyannis, MA",0,18,,5.0,1/22/2016,"AMAZING! My boyfriend and I stopped in here to escape the rain and grab something quick to eat. He always jokes if you see cops eating somewhere it must be a great place and there was a table of police officers seated in the middle of the dining room enjoying their lunch. We were seated immediately and the place was pretty busy (we were there around noon). Our waiter came over very soon after we sat down and he was incredible! Joel was quick, charming, and very helpful when we asked for suggestions. I got the Clementine Crush drink it was so refreshing. We decided to get two apps to share, first the Sriracha Brussels sprouts they were wonderful. Big enough portion to share but not big enough to overwhelm.. They were seasoned perfectly and Joel even brought us extra Sriracha crema for dipping.. Do yourself a favor and try these you won't regret it. Next we wanted wings but couldn't decide between the lemon pepper or the garlic Parmesan so Joel told us he would just get us a split order and I'm so happy he did. Both flavors were phenomenal! Perfect balance of spices, so delicious! The rest of the menu looked amazing and I wish I was hungrier to try something else!! They looked like they have the perfect blend of tasty and healthy. I would definitely recommend this place and next time I'm in the area I will be stopping by!"
Mike S.,"Jupiter, FL",18,84,61,2.0,5/31/2014,"Really horrible experience that I'll chalk up to opening month jitters and poor hiring choices. Table of four, only one beer served and only after apps delivered. Food was good enough, especially avocado egg roll.  Beer good too, once we got it.  I'll try again in a month once their training issues are worked out."
James K.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,24,,2.0,10/3/2014,Hate to have changed my post. Came today. Waited an hour and a half to get a burnt pizza. Possibly my last visit here
Brett A. S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",1,10,1,4.0,12/22/2014,Solid 4 stars. Good beer specials and appetizers for happy hour. Food is a bit pricy but good quality. Friendly staff. A few people complained about the wait but it's a popular place. If ur cranky and starving go to the many take out places.
