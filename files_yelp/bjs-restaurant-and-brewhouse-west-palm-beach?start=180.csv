Joe T.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",11,21,3,1.0,7/26/2014,"Ordered a medium rare burger came out well done, my family was done eating by the time the new one came back out and it again was well done. The server I don't think ever waited on a table in her life. Bad service. Think twice about coming here."
Christopher M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,10,1,1.0,12/27/2015,"The food was Horrific. $55 for a tiny pizza , raw,10 chicken wings a small wedge and a beer ridiculous."
James B.,"West Palm Beach, FL",10,8,6,4.0,6/19/2014,Can't wait to try the beer. Fast lunch time service and plenty of help. Great location next to the new PB Outlets.
Violet O.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,5,,4.0,9/23/2015,"We had a very attentive waitress last night and enjoyed four different meals and four different brews.  The food was good; the beers were quite tasty.  Good set up with a lot of TVs to see from all locations in the restaurant and bar.  Overall, we had a very nice evening at BJ's on Palm Beach Lakes."
Polina C.,"Marathon, FL",0,1,,1.0,4/26/2015,"If it was possible to leave a half a star review I would.  From start to finish the food and service were horrible. On a not so crowded night, it took 15 minutes for waiter to acknowledge us, another half hour to bring out drinks, and an hour to bring out food. The food was dry and my steak was overkooked. Once the waiter took it back, I waited over half hour to get it. No apology, no manager came out, and I was billed the full amount. They even added second steak to it, before the waiter realized it and changed the check. Would not recommend..."
Adrian H.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,19,174,1.0,4/25/2015,"I gave it one star as zero wasn't an option. I never complain and always see the glass half full - this place was awful. Our pizza was delivered very carefully using tongues on the pizza tray. We both tried a piece, looked at each other and then I lifted the tray with my hands as it was cold. I asked the server if it could be warmed and she replied yes, not oh very sorry yes, just yes. The pizza was returned nice and hot and, oh yes, without the pizza slice, so we served ourselves with our hands. The table had no silverware so we next requested this. Half way through the pizza we were asked if we wanted a dessert; we politely explained we hadn't finished the pizza. Two minutes later we were offered 2 burgers and we explained that it was probably for a different table. Beer selection here is great. Service and food  are definitely not. Burger and pizza are the easiest of food options and checking they are warm not difficult."
Maureen M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,4,,1.0,2/19/2015,"I tried this place a couple of times and each time was exactly the same. First time I figured it was because they were new but I guess not. We ordered two sandwiches and two sodas, 1 1/2 hours later, we got our cold (should have been hot) sandwiches. The next time, same thing, another 1 1/2 hours but this time we just cancelled the sandwiches. The last time, another 1/2 hours and we got more cold (should have been hot) sandwiches. Do we need to order alcohol to get any service at this place? The service is the reason that we will never go back."
Samantha B.,"Troy, MI",1,20,4,1.0,9/14/2014,This was my first and LAST time here. Service was incredibly slow and food was mediocre (and overpriced) at best.
Megan J.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,7,,3.0,8/17/2014,"It was just okay. The menu didn't thrill me, in fact I had trouble trying to find something I wanted to order. I settled on a steak and found that it was over seasoned and way too peppery. Mashed potatoes were great. My salad came out after my main dish, and it was warm. I really enjoyed their hand crafted root beer, but it was super sweet. It is a nice place, but the menu and service just didn't win me over."
