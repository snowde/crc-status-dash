Yanni H.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,22,,5.0,8/16/2017,"Large menu selection with all the typical offerings for a chain restaurant. Pizza and house beers taste great. They accommodate large parties well. They aren't to be compared to your local farm-to-table restaurants, but rather to chilis."
John M.,"Denver, CO",31,70,17,5.0,4/11/2017,"My wife Mary Beth and I visited BJ's restaurant and brewhouse twice when we were in West Palm Beach,Florida last week. The service was outstanding, the food was very good and the Beers were going down very smooth. We will go back for sure when we return. We live in Denver,CO and will go visit the locations here in the area.  I am a sports fanatic and there was Sports on all the TV's. Yeah........ We really enjoyed the stuffed avocados."
Kunal P.,"Boynton Beach, FL",10,89,21,5.0,3/24/2017,"Not sure why this is rated so low, possibly the service?  The service is generally bad, but it's a very large place with demanding guests.  The handcrafted sodas are perfect. Typically I get the root beer or creme soda.  I've had many dishes here. My favorite is the deep dish pepperoni pizza. Outside of Chicago, especially for a chain, the deep dish is perfectly equal parts crust, cheese, sauce, and pepperoni. The buffalo chicken deep dish is a bit sweet for my taste.  Pazookie desserts are to die for, literally. Any flavor, and combo, just go for it. Nothing better than a warm, freshly baked cookie with ice cream on top."
Don L.,"Boynton Beach, FL",7,75,2,2.0,7/31/2017,"This was our first time here and what a disappointment. It was our 30th anniversary. First the positive. The place is very clean and staff very friendly. Nice variety on the menu. We ordered Bloody Mary's that came with wilted celery. Yes wilted! I couldn't believe they served it looking like this with the leaves all hanging down. The meal was very good but we had to ask to have dirty dishes taken away so we could fit our entree on the table. As I watched I noticed that the food runner, waitress and even the manager have a habit of walking back to the kitchen empty handed each and every time. Ordered another round of Bloody Mary's and this time we got the wilted celery with nothing else. No olive, no green bean, no pepper. Very disappointing experience to say the least. Our bill came to $150 and couldn't help but feel that it just wasn't worth it."
Angelo R.,"Miami, FL",795,474,4003,4.0,11/19/2015,"First time here at BJ's. Came in for dinner after the race track. We got some drinks at the bar first. The margaritas were way too sweet so switched to martinis. Our bartender didn't charge for the margaritas. Good service so far. After we were sat at the table, our server immediately approached and introduced himself. He was very energectic and friendly. He answered all the questions we had about the menu. We ordered Crispy Jalapeño Burger and a personal size BJ's Favorie pizza (meatballs, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, olives, white onions & seasoned tomatoes). Burger was great and came w/ well seasoned steak fries. Medium burger had nice spicy crunch from the fried breaded jalapenos!  The pizza was also piping hot & tasty. You can also order a medium or large size for sharing. Overall great experience. Not your typical restaurant chain. They really do focus on good service and decent food."
Gianna R.,"Los Angeles, CA",10,72,3,3.0,3/3/2017,"After a long day at the West Palm Beach outlet store, I decided to have lunch at BJ's.  The food was good -- however, the service was a bit slow (for a party of 1??? come on).  I would have scored them higher, but I want the server to at least pop by to see how I'm doing, refill my glass and ask if I need anything else. Next time."
Elizabeth G.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,2,,1.0,6/11/2017,Worst customer service ever! Was seated by their hostess and sat at our table for over 10 minutes with no server greeting us or taking our drink orders. I sat and watched about 5 other tables including a party of 10 be greeted before us. When my husband went back up to the hostess stand to bring it to her attention she acted as though she could not be bothered. By the time the manager tried to do something about it I was walking out the door. I Will never be back.
Maria R.,"Boca Raton, FL",66,9,2,1.0,6/3/2017,"Umm I will definitely not be coming back and do not recommend for anyone to come here. Starting off, the hostess has us do a lap around the entire restaurant like idiots while she kept switching our table. We ended up just  choosing our own table due to desperation and their unprofessional indecision. They took over 10 minutes to even bring out menus let alone come to take our drink order. We get over it, trying to look forward to our meal when they literally bring out Kraft Mac and cheese and a handful of cold fries. Mediocre food and slow service made for an overall poor experience."
Ann L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",81,10,67,4.0,11/20/2016,"This is our go to spot for a beer ! (I always get a Blonde, since I've heard blondes have more fun right? Hehe) Their bar is beautiful and the service is amazing! I've had a few items on their menu and have been pleased with all of them. My favorite go to appetizer are the crispy potato skins with guac on the side! Yummm, I'm now drooling just thinking about it! I also recommend for dessert the huge chocolate chip cookie topped off with vanilla ice cream! You can thank me now hehe"
Janet H.,"Birdsboro, PA",32,102,81,3.0,1/15/2017,"I was surprised to learn this was a chain restaurant and brewery.  The food was decent and the service was also decent.  There were lots of tv's for the men to watch the games. We were planning to order a meal then found out they have half priced apps during games so we switched gears and ordered them.  Chicken wings weren't our favorite, flatbread pizza was good, as was the spinach artichoke dip.  Beer was so so, I've had better, but no complaints."
FarmerDom D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,1,1.0,8/11/2017,"I orderes the jumbo spaghetti and meatballs, and the meatballs tasted frozen and not homemade, and the sauce was watery."
Lisa K.,"Jupiter, FL",19,39,1,4.0,6/23/2017,We hit this place up for happy hour once a month. The Waitresses are all very accommodating to Separate Checks sometimes for quite a few of us.  This past month we had a retirement get together and we had about 30 or 40 people. The manager was nice enough to set up a corner of the restaurant with a bunch of smaller tables that we could use and gave us two servers. They have drink and appetizer specials for happy hour and the food is a step up from normal bar food. I recommend it.
Rebekah L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",23,41,3,4.0,2/4/2017,"This is my 2nd time here.   First time was when it was first opened-not so good.  However tonight Shannon our server was excellent for a fast paced environment, she was extremely thorough.   Everything we ordered was very good. My family and   I will be returning.  I was very impressed, and recommend this restaurant to others."
Mark D.,"Rolling Meadows, IL",68,283,54,2.0,4/8/2017,"While the food was good, our waitress was horrible. After taking our order, we didn't see her again until our food came. Needed drink refills about 20 minutes sooner. Then when we asked for refills she told us she needed to run another patrons check first and we waited another 10 minutes. On top of the wait, she served iced tea with no ice! Since I'm here on vacation, they don't have to guess if I'll be coming back... I won't!"
Clint G.,"West Palm Beach, FL",36,23,17,1.0,5/7/2017,"There are issues in this kitchen.  They have done a good job attracting good people to interact with the customers, but the kitchen is a disaster, every time I come.  Makes me worry about food quality and food safety when they can't get the simple things right in the kitchen."
Jennifer I.,"Pompano Beach, FL",38,10,,1.0,3/29/2017,This restaurant is horrible! The service is so bad! You wait forever for your food and when you finally get it there's something wrong with it
Chad C.,"Marietta, GA",45,42,56,3.0,11/18/2016,"This is your average brew house food. Massive beer selection, but I don't drink beer. The food was nothing special just a tad better than bar food.  Overall, on par with most other chain restaurants."
Sethu R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",17,104,96,3.0,1/24/2017,An average place for burgers and pizza!  Nothing stood out today!  I will go there at least one more time to checkout their local beer selections.  They need to hire more servers because it took our server a long time to get back to our table.  It appeared he had too many tables to attend to.
Susan B.,"Wellington, FL",19,111,,4.0,9/29/2016,"We visited for the first time at lunch today.  The service was excellent despite the huge crowd which included several tables of ten or more. One guest had a burger which was nicely served but dry yet loaded with toppings. Sadly, the fries were cold. The salad and pizza were great and we look forward to returning and trying other items on the vast menu. The place is very nicely appointed and comfortable. We normally do not like chain themed restaurants but the food here was very good, prices fair, ambiance excellent and not as noisy as expected, and the server was friendly and professional."
Christine E.,"Boynton Beach, FL",29,21,6,4.0,12/3/2016,Good beer and food. Did not disappoint.tavern pizza with artichoke and chicken mediterranean tacos were great.
