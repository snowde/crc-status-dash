Mike C.,"Wallingford Center, CT",0,27,1,5.0,7/19/2016,"I don't know where these other people dined, however we are visiting Florida and a relative recommended BJ's. Two things crossed my mind when it was recommended, the wholesale club and (yea, you know what I'm thinking...getting a BJ).  We came on a Tuesday around 5:00pm and place was crowded but we were seated right away. By 6:30 place was hopping! And this was a regular Tuesday, no special events. Service was great and a plus was that Happy Hour wasn't just in the bar area but extended to the whole restaurant!! Definitely a plus and very rare to find. Their BJ's brew, NITWIT was very refreshing. Just like a Lienenkugel's  We dined with two kids and the kids menu had many different selections of entrees and sides. With drink Included, kids meal is $5.75. We ordered a couple different dishes, burger, chicken tacos, chicken piadina and all were fantastic. Topped dinner off with the signature pizookies, which if you use Yelp coupon you get one free!! Those were amazing!!!!!  I do not have one complaint about the place.  Next time I visit I will definitely stop for a BJ, whoops I meant at BJ's."
Kim R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,1,,5.0,7/21/2017,My boss and I ordered from  here for the first time a few weeks ago. Since we can't get out of the office we got the take out. I must say since then we have been ordering every Friday. EVERYTHING we have ordered has been absolutely phenomenal. The girl at the take out counter is always so pleasant.  The prices are good and the food is above average in our  opinion.  I look forward to our Friday  lunches here. I have read all these negative reviews and I can't disagree with ALL of them more. Usually take out is not as good as dine in but this place its just as good.
Robert C.,"Alexandria, VA",1,42,4,3.0,3/27/2017,"First time in a BJs brew house. Good beer and food selection. Was able to get a high top table in the bar to watch  NCAA tournament. Wife and I had the prime rib which was good; not great. Ran out of clean steak knives - never brought one; mentioned bringing bread - never did; had to ask for Au jus; had to ask for raw horse radish - brought a cream sauce version. With all the options in the area, not hitting a home run put it in the secondary tier."
Tina H.,"North Palm Beach, FL",10,13,3,2.0,9/16/2016,Asian chicken salad left a lot to be desired.  Weren't too busy for a Friday night yet the kitchen was super slow. Salad had to have been pre made because it was wilted.  It put a lot of pieces to the side because I just couldn't identify what they were.  Waiter was eh!  Didn't seem to really give two shakes.  First experience at BJs was in Orlando was great.  2nd was in Cali and was good 2 X's here at Palm Beach Outlets has sucked! Trust me don't drink the water go somewhere else!
Marc W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",20,125,21,2.0,7/16/2016,"This place never ceases to amaze me.  They go from good to awful in the blink of an eye.  After visiting BJ's across the country this location a mile from my home is terrible in comparison.  They cannot figure out the very basics.  I just don't understand why they have so many issues with service and quality.  How do you accept a curbside order (which was screwed up) and when you get there to pIck it up say, CURBSIDE IS NOT AVAILABLE? I wish they could fix the issues. I want to like this place."
Elmer j L.,"Palm Bay, FL",49,36,31,5.0,8/6/2016,"Our first time BJs and everything we order from the traditional wings, side salads, market Italian pizza and the margherita Fresca flatbread was delicious. And thanks to the very professional and attentive server William C. Definitely a come back."
Alley M.,"Boynton Beach, FL",48,6,,1.0,5/22/2016,"We arrived at 8:15 on Saturday evening. After a 20 minute wait we were seated, another 15 minutes passed before our waitress came to the table.We then ordered drinks and appetizers which took another 15 minutes. The service was horrible and the wait staff was very unfriendly. There was no silverware on the table we were told they ran out????? When our food finally arrived one of the meals was prepared wrong and way overcooked. After speaking with the waitress she stated that she didn't want to bother the kitchen. Ultimately the Manager removed the meal from our check....... I ordered the Deep Dish Ziti which was ok but not worth the 14.95 price. We won't be back to this restaurant it is way to costly for lousy service. There are many other good choices in the area!!! Think twice about this place!!!!"
Matt K.,"West Palm Beach, FL",284,6,,1.0,2/27/2017,"After I had a horrible experience here I decided to give it one more shot... and that's a wrap. Mozzarella sticks were half way cooked, wings were dry, santa fe salad looked and tasted like baby throw up. Oh and not to mention the Mahi-Mahi that was chewier then the chicken. Place sucks. When she asks me if I need a box, ""no I wouldn't feed this shit to my dog"""
Selene S.,"Sebastian, FL",43,20,20,4.0,8/16/2016,First time there. All apps were 1/2 price during happy hour! Plus you can get a free app or dessert coupon on the web. Go try it!
Nathan S.,"Orlando, FL",124,121,54,1.0,5/5/2016,"Piss poor takeout. Paid $15 for a simple chicken dish. Meat was Ok, but these guys gave a half assed effort on presentation. It was a minute amount of chicken and cold caramelized onions that resembled what you'd find in an infant's diaper. Go somewhere else."
David N.,"Naperville, IL",179,2,,1.0,1/14/2017,Went to this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation. We sat the bar for 15 mins and the bartender only acknowledged us once. We didn't even get asked what we wanted to drink. The bartender rather put glasses away than to serve us. Terrible service
Herbert E.,"West Palm Beach, FL",231,264,2937,3.0,12/14/2015,"'Ello chaps! BJ's Brewhouse is a chain restaurant focusing on American food fare. Pizza, burgers, steaks, chicken, pasta, seafood takes up much of the menu space. And there are pages and pages of menu items.  That's also a good thing if you've got picky eaters in your group. Everyone is bound to find something.  Of course Beer is a big thing here too, hence the name Brewhouse.  This place is great for groups and features many of the big games on the many tv's located throughout the large dining area."
Bc C.,"Dana Point, CA",1,33,25,4.0,6/25/2016,"4 stars cause they must need a new manager. But the food is good. The service is slow, but they don't rush you out...!  The waitress was nice, even joking about being extremely slow.. The food was surprisingly good. So try the half off happy hour. And plan on taking your time. .                     ."
Camila A.,"Miami, FL",31,1,,1.0,1/20/2017,"We were seated on the spot. After a 40 min wait with not even the slightest greet from the server (who passed by several times), we stood up and walked away."
Maryanth B.,"Hialeah, FL",28,4,1,1.0,5/21/2016,"THE HOSTESS SUCK SO BAD. Horrible customer service, they have horrible attitudes and give you faces if you ask them to move your table or if you do not want to sit at a table, or even if you ask them to clean up a table. They're rude and lousy. I use to love this place but the hostess and they're terrible customer service just made this place so shitty. I hope management does something about them cause wow. SERVICE HERE BLOWS SO HARDDDDDDDD"
K R.,"Delray Beach, FL",2,37,1,2.0,6/4/2017,"The food is fine for ""bar food""  The service on the other hand is terrible (barely existent) Sat at the bar 5 minutes before acknowledgement,    30 min for an appetizer and then I had to get up to interrupt the bartender because being social was more important than doing his job (we didn't have plates or silverware.) While she was working service bar - he did NOTHING!"
Lisa T.,"Delray Beach, FL",496,65,19,4.0,6/29/2016,"The service was good, the food was good and the healthy options are abundant.  It is a good moderate priced option."
Robert C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,10/19/2017,"Our sons favorite restaurant until today! Went to celebrate our sons 17th birthday at BJS like we always do and it started out with the server slamming my beer on the table then walking away. No coasters either. Then walks by slams the appetizer plates on the table and kept walking. Not a very friendly atmosphere. We still wanted to give her a chance. Then the food cane and she slid the plates toward us surprisingly it didn't fall in our laps! Then when I requested a cookie cake with ice cream for our son... she brought it out started to sing then walked away at the beginning of the song while we continued to sing to our son. So we decided we weren't tipping her. We wrote her a note on the receipt. "" can you please not slam drinks or anything else on the tables anymore"" thank you. Following that she ran outside after us screaming and hollering in sarcasm THANK YOU THANK YOU waving her arms around then goes back inside and come out the side of the restaurant screaming and waving her hands everywhere. Mind this we had our 1 year old, 17 and 18 year old with us and we have never experienced anything as horrible as this anywhere ever in our lives."
Alan W.,"Huntington Station, NY",106,104,59,3.0,9/9/2016,"2 1/2 stars Not usually a fan of themed, chain restaurants, we dined here on a recent, rainy Saturday evening after shopping at the outlet store and I'm surprised to say I enjoyed it.  It's convenient, to be sure if you're at t he Outlets. It's a big, noisy place, but that's what it's supposed to be.The menu is quite large, but not all the pages are bound in the same order.  Was it going to be one of the interesting burgers or a pizza.  Well, since this place started as BJ's Pizza before it changed its name and menu, I opted for a personal pizza.  A caveat, as a New Yorker, I'm biased toward NYC style pizza. I was surprised by my BJ's Classic Combo with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom. About the size of a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza, this is vastly better. The dough, unlike most Chicago-style pizza (BJ's model), was buttery and yeasty (my daughter said it still reminded her of Pizza Hut but less salty, however). There wasn't a ton of cheese and the toppings were flavorful. The craft beer selection is wide and a sampler of four 5 oz pours was just $6. The Hefeweizen was spot on with loads of banana and bubble gum eatery notes and the Jeremiah Red Ale was a nicely balanced, drinkable brew. Less-liked, but still okay, were BJ's PM Porter, which was easy to drink, but nothing too special, and Nutty Brunette, which had a husky, grainy character. Service was a tad sluggish, but overall worth a revisit."
Michelle L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,14,3,3.0,5/20/2017,We had the Turkey dip sandwich and spaghetti and meatballs. I would pass on the turkey dip sandwich. The garlic a Oli and the French dip was tasteless. The spaghetti and meatballs was decent. I would agree the places average. But they were very very busy waiting line
