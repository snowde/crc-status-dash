Sophia G.,"Boynton Beach, FL",5,38,95,5.0,8/21/2016,"I really can't find a thing to complain about! Calamari was delicious, alcoholic beverages were on point, entrees were great and the dessert.. Oh my!! Our waiter was excellent and even mentioned he could do half the white macadamia and the other half chocolate chunk.. YES! Definitely will be back!!"
Dis W.,"Greenacres, FL",21,19,32,3.0,4/14/2016,I am only giving this restaurant 3 stars because my daughters smiley face potato things were soooo good. I had the Atlantic Salmon and was disappointed. The asparagus seemed over cooked and fish lacked flavor. My mom enjoyed her Chicken Alfredo and my daughter enjoyed her burger. I like this place and will visit again. Maybe the chef was having a bad day. The waitress was not very attentive and at one point she walked by the table and didn't stop to at least see if there was anything we needed. Which we did. I will give them another shot one.
Jeff B.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",70,118,43,3.0,2/28/2016,"I've eaten here twice; once for lunch a few weeks ago and recently for dinner with a friend.  They have an extensive menu so the first time I ordered a small deep dish pizza (sausage and onion) and the second time I tried their chicken pita tacos.  I thought the flavor for both was good and the service was good too with very little wait time.  My only issue with BJ's is that both meals were really, very salty.  Too salty.  So if I were to return, I would probably order something else."
Anna R.,"Boynton Beach, FL",399,26,241,4.0,8/27/2016,Overall ok experience. We were able to use a coupon I saw on Yelp once I checked in that gave us a free app with 9.95 meal purchase so my husband and I got the Ahi Tuna and it was phenomenal. The food itself was a 5. Our waitress was nice but first thing she said was that she was pretty new so we didn't expect top notch service. We showed her our coupon and she spoke with the manager who came over and introduced himself to us which was nice. The restaurant was definitely cold so bring a light jacket. The restaurants were fairly clean. No covers for the changing table. (I have an infant so this is something I notice even though I bring my own changing pad). Our waitress did fairly well for being so new and a bartender actually brought my husband his beer (not sure if maybe it was forgotten when he asked for another or what) and she came with one too so she left us an extra beer free of charge.  Wouldn't mind coming back like I said no complaints about the food!
Susan H.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",0,29,323,4.0,10/3/2016,Service was very good. Waitress was very friendly. The martinis where perfect and the lunch portions very good.  Definitely a go to place when we come visit.
Melanee K.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/6/2016,"Came here on a Sunday night with family who is from out-of-town and thought we would give this place a go.   Being that it was a Sunday evening we expected it to be somewhat busy-not a problem, after all we chose to go out on a Sunday.  Drinks: DO.NOT.ORDER.MARAGRITAS. They use a pre-made margarita mix and the drinks tasted terrible, like cough syrup not ""fresh"" as advertised. Try beer and ciders, you will be a lot safer with those choices. Peer cider was so refreshing! Food: If it was not cold, it was burnt. If it was not cold or burnt, it was incorrect. Asked for additional condiments- never got it. Waiter was rude too. Bottom-line: There are plenty of other restaurants in WPB you can try instead of wasting + $120 here ."
Brooke H.,"Delray Beach, FL",29,5,2,1.0,4/2/2016,I was just eating dinner here with my family and a drive by shooting hit the glass and shattered the window. Our waitress proceeded to joke and ask if we were scared when we asked for our check. The lack of management and professionalism at this restaurant was ridiculous. This is nothing to joke about and people could have been killed. I will NEVER come back here in my life and hope no one ever comes here for your own safety.
Mauro R.,"West Palm Beach, FL",53,183,26,2.0,1/17/2016,"Two visits here and same feeling: service is hit and miss even at the bar. Food is okay a slightly overpriced for the quality. In short it's a place that gives me no reason to go back, although I might stop for a beer if in the area. But there are many better options around.  I have to say the area around the new Palm Beach Outlets is pretty lacking in terms of restaurants; quantity is there, but quality not so much. Add to that the downtown prices who have no reason to be and you can quickly understand this is a ""meh"" kind of feeling."
Lisa C.,"Wellington, FL",59,50,17,3.0,8/27/2016,"Great bar food, cold drinks and nice atmosphere.   Beautiful bar area with big tvs and gorgeous bar set up.   Food was good but nothing too special.   Would go back and try more things.   We had guacamole, flat bread pizza and ribeye.  The cucumber jalapeno margheretta was delicious."
Makayla C.,"Orlando, FL",181,2,,1.0,5/7/2017,Sadly bad service. Was very excited about this place even wanted to stay and order dessert. We waited 30+ min for our food and it still never came out. Server told us they gave our food to some one else. No manager ever came by and we finally left.
Joe D.,"Riviera Beach, FL",0,10,1,4.0,4/1/2017,"We went here to try a new place, loved the atmosphere, loved the service and  what we ordered was very good . Huge menu, kitchen a little slow to deliver. It was worth the wait, we thought the pricing was reasonable and would go back to try something else on there extensive menu. Definitely try the pizookle for desert."
James B.,"Riverhead, NY",0,15,,3.0,3/9/2017,"Had lunch here in Feb food 3 1/2 stars service good. I would return for lunch or a weeknight dinner. Monkey bread worth the calories, yum."
Gage L.,"Albany, NY",190,31,8,4.0,8/5/2016,Service was excellent first and foremost. I had ordered just a few finger foods as the main reason to go was because of a long trip back home. I had ordered the IPA flight which included a wide range of tasteful brews. I would return if in the area however I just relocated. The lack of stars comes from the food quality. The brussel sprouts were overcooked and the chicken wasn't quite there. Other than that it was quite a good experience. The waitress was very knowledgeable on the beer which I expected since it was a place known for beer.
Allison N.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",252,688,596,4.0,9/28/2014,"I actually quite enjoyed the food I had at BJ's which was sort of surprising because I wasn't expecting a lot. My family and I decided to come here for lunch before I left town and the place was PACKED. I mean, I have quite honestly never seen this many people in one restaurant in West Palm Beach at the same time, except maybe the Cheesecake Factory. But even with a full house, we were still able to get a table speedily, which was great. We started with the potstickers and the stuffed mushrooms. The stuffed mushrooms were much better than the potstickers. Now, I'm not totally sure what was in those mushrooms except it was some sort of cheesy deliciousness that was slightly breaded. They were topped with this creamy green sauce which was pretty tasty as well.  The potstickers were okay, nothing too snazzy.  My dad and I split two entrees -- the scallops and the lemon thyme chicken. I quite enjoyed the lemon thyme chicken since it had a GREAT flavor and the brussel sprouts that came with it were really good and not overcooked. The scallops were also pretty tasty and not too fishy. Service was decent. Our waiter brought me out another soda before I had even finished half of my drink which was sort of weird since my water remained unfilled for the entire rest of the meal. Strange, but nothing too out of control. I'd come back for that lemon thyme chicken. Mmm, mmm."
Mary Ann C.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",1299,557,913,3.0,9/1/2015,"Let me start at the end of the meal.  Their baked cookie desserts with ice cream are five star.   My son had one of their specialty burgers and it was off the charts.  He said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had and he loved the thin and crispy fries.  My daughter always orders the jambalaya and raved about it.  I ordered chicken with spinach and mushrooms over rice pilaf instead of quinoa.  Let's just say I shouldn't have ordered that.  The chicken was really salty and it wasn't from spices or sauce on top, it was in the chicken itself.  I really felt like it was injected with a saline solution.  I took two bites but could not eat it.  The mushrooms and spinach were fresh and cooked just right.  The rice was mundane at best.  The waitress was super friendly and offered to have a plain grilled chicken breast cooked up for me.  I told her not to bother but she had then send one anyway.  It came and looked like my chicken breast from earlier just sliced and grilled with more seasoning and still that saline taste inside.  Thankfully I had sweet tea to drink."
Deb M.,"Jupiter, FL",29,21,34,4.0,1/17/2015,"Tried this place bc it is right by the outlet mall and I needed sustenance before beginning the shopping expedition today. I wanted to order a few diff meals on the menu but since I knew I'd be shopping I just ordered an appetizer and dessert. I can't bear the thought of throwing away half my meal (I never finish a meal bc portion sizes are ridiculous in the US of A) instead of taking it home for leftovers...and nothing would be good after sitting in my car for hours as I shopped.  So, I tried the Fritto nachos...I Love Frittos and I love nachos so this sounded like a match made in heaven. I was impressed with the presentation of both the appetizer and dessert. They came out looking EXACTLY like the pic in the menu. That really doesn't happen very often.  The nachos were delish. Still crunchy even though they were underneath a lot of wet, gooey, yummy stuff..cheese, chili, sour cream. It felt really odd eating nachos with a fork, but bc Frittos are so much smaller than regular nacho chips eating with fingers isn't an option...okay it's an option but a really, really messy one.  The baked beignet was yummy too...and picture perfect. Not like a beignet from Nola but still very good. The strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream too. I love strawberry shortcake so a pet peeve is ordering it and tasting that, these have been sitting in the juice too long, flavor that happens more often than not when eating out. Don't know why it seems to happen a lot but it does. Not here though, and the whipped cream was real, definitely not Ready Whip.  The waitress (Kristen K) was pleasant and efficient. Another pet peeve is seeing the attitude change in the server when they realize the check is gonna be a small one. So whenever I have a good server and I have a small check I always tip on what the cost of a full meal would be..usually the price of what my hubby and I would spend on lunch or dinner. I'm sweet like that :-)  The only negative I would say is that the hostess was cleaning the door when I got there and told me she'd be right with me...and finished cleaning the door as I stood at the hostess stand waiting. When a customer comes in that should be the priority, the door will be there after the customer is seated. She was not friendly and didn't smile either. That has got to be my biggest pet peeve of all in regard to dining out. Hostesses are supposed to make the customer feel welcome and smile, and say more than ""One?"" when greeting a customer.  But overall a very good experience at this restaurant...if you like good ""bad"" food, like nachos and strawberry shortcake beignets definitely give it a go. I'll be back on a night I can take my leftovers home...quite a few yummy looking meals on the menu!"
Forest K.,"Parrish, FL",12,1,,1.0,4/5/2017,Dont get the mahi tacos disgusting and grose.  Waiter did not even care to ask why i didnt eat them. I would not bother with this place unless u want to drink.
Larry J.,"West Palm Beach, FL",25,108,109,5.0,1/7/2016,"I've never had a bad experience or meal here. Had their  Mahi-mahi and shrimp. Low cal, but high in salt. However, it was delicious."
Mike Z.,"Delray Beach, FL",77,54,47,4.0,8/6/2016,"They have a great line of their house brews, one in every beer category, plus other local and well known ones on tap.  Food is good, deep dish pizza is amazing.  Appetizers are big portions,  well worth it.  Nothing wrong with the service here.  Its a chain restaurant but is a step above the Chili's,  Applebee's,  etc."
Lisa S.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,38,23,4.0,8/20/2016,"This restaurant is still new to me. I've eaten there 3 times. I've ordered appetizers with my meal each visit and they're all amazing. The service is friendly and quick which was pleasantly surprising for a busy restaurant. This last time I ordered the 1/2 sandwich California chicken club lunch special. Only $8 for the sandwich, fries plus my choice of soup or salad. I couldn't beat that at a drive through! It was made with a nice piece of carved chicken breast (NOT lunch meat) which was a plus for me. Very delicious! I was on lunch break for work and they got my meal out right away. I was only disappointed with my cold clam chowder soup. They probably prepare ahead of time but they're not keeping it warm enough. I've read some complaints about cold food and I have reason to believe that. I wouldn't let that stop me from eating there because the rest of my meal was hot and delicious."
