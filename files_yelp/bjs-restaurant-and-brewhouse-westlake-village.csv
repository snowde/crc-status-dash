Shaby F.,"Hidden Hills, CA",88,32,1,4.0,12/26/2017,"Updating my review: Management sent me a courtesy E-giftcard to go back and try this location. I thought that was super sweet and so the family and I ventured back to try one more time and we were pleasantly surprised.  Hostess was a bit rude, she asked me to stand in a walkway, and then a waiter asked me to move and she basically told me to go back to the walkway. But we were seated in half the time estimated so that was nice. Our waiter was so sweet and friendly. We really enjoyed having him as our server. Although he seemed busy, and a bit flustered, but he was a total sweetie pie. Our food took a little long, but it was all SO good. I wasn't disappointed at all this time. Warm food, good taste, and all very filling with great portion sizes. We will most definitely be back to this location and I'm glad we gave it another shot."
Carly M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",51,42,8,1.0,12/12/2017,"I feel sick.. worst food ever.  I ordered the shrimp scampi & the shrimp tasted awful. Spaghetti had some greasy cheap butter blend with a tinge of garlic. Even the wedge salad was awful.  Most of the lettuce was the hard center part.  The Dressing tasted like some awful cheap low end salad dressing.  Pure nastiness.  High prices for cheap low quality food.  This area has some nice places to eat & Bj's is NOT one of them.  Best to take your money elsewhere & not eat here.   I used to love this chain but the quality of their food has gone so downhill, it's time for them to either re-evaluate or close down.  I don't drink beer so they can't get me drunk to not notice their food sucks.  If anyone who reads this & still makes the decision to give Bj's a try, don't say I didn't try to warn ya."
Dan G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",9,14,3,2.0,12/5/2017,"Came here last night for dinner. BJ's has 50% off on pizza on Monday nights, so we went for that. While it was busy, the service was extremely poor, probably the worst it's been in all the times I've been there. Firstly, I gave the waiter my phone number so that I could get the points (as I'm a premier rewards member). As of this morning, I still have not received credit and don't expect to at this point. Secondly, it took nearly 10 minutes for our waiter to initially come to our table to ask us what we wanted to drink. Throughout the time we were there, he rarely came by to check to see how things were. By the time we got our food, it was not very warm. Apparently we were not the only ones dissatisfied with the service. There was a group of people at the table behind us that asked to speak with the manager for the same reason. To top it all off, we were originally charged full price for the pizza. Fortunately we noticed before paying the bill, but who knows if there are others that this happened to that didn't catch it."
Moshe L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",79,84,39,2.0,1/4/2018,"So me, the most beautiful woman in the world and Crazy Kid #1 AKA Long and Lean went out to eat for dinner because it was the MBWITW's birthday.  So naturally, it is her choice of where to go.  She mentioned new gluten free this and dairy free that choices available at BJ's so how could I say no?   It is her birthday and they do have Pizookie (the large freshly made cookie in a big tin topped with ice cream) - so double score.  We get in and the place is not quite as busy as it used to be and only a 3 star on Yelp?  What's happening here?  Normally 3 on Yelp - I'm Audi5000,  What could it be, I imagined?  Didn't they get the Pizookie? Don't like MicroBrews?  Cant reach the Barstools?  Not sure.  So hoping to see for myself, I stayed.  We were greeted by a very cheerful hostess and sat within 5 minutes at one of the nice cushy booths facing the Bar no less so we could watch some of the activity.   Now on to the meal.  I had the chicken fried steak because it is such a large menu and I had to make a decision.   CK#1 got the thin crust pizza that was 15.95 and advertised at 16 X 10.  The MBWINTH got a quinoa dish mainly to show off that she can pronounce quinoa.    First thing I noticed.  The pizza looked good, but relatively small for 16 bucks.  I would have it at about 12 X 8.  So we were missing quite a lot of mass on the pie.  The MBWITW quinoa dish was alright and she claimed it had some stones in the quinoa, which it sometimes has.  And my meal was served with cold fries - that I had to send back.  The sandwich I had was actually very good.  Chicken fried steak with avocado and tomato and a fried egg and gravy on a brioche bun.  I do not usually mark down a restaurant for poor service but we were waiting for 20 minutes after our meal was finished just to get the check and box for take home.   So my suggestion for BJ's is go back to what you know  Forget the thin crust, forget the menu with so many items.  It is better to do a few things great than a number of things meh.  You do several things right such as Good Beer, Deep Dish Pizza and Pizookie!  Stick to your roots and up your game, you are a few tweaks from being a great restaurant again."
Ellie R.,"Valley Center, CA",274,74,182,4.0,5/5/2017,"We had our end of the year business fraternity banquet and it was an honest success! Service was attentive but not overbearing. They were easy to work with and allowed everything to go smoothly.  The food was also good, not amazing but good enough. The pizzas were"
Dani N.,"Santa Barbara, CA",1852,292,3413,5.0,3/23/2017,"This review is based on the million Pazookie (dessert) experiences I have had here and has nothing to do with the rest of the menu, just a fair warning! In high school, this was our go to spot for meet and gossips. We'd all hop in our cars, cruise down TO Boulevard like we were ""all that"" and grab a booth at BJ's for a round of Pazzokies! That. Was. The. Life. It seemed like every flavor they ever added we tried but all would agree the OG Chocolate Chip would over rule all.  Thinking back on my experiences back then to even my most recent experience not 2 months ago, the service has always treated me with respect and a smile on their faces. The wait was never that long, even if there was a line of waiting parties posted up around the corner. They really seem to have a smooth system down and put their employees through a proper training course.  My obvious favorite part about the BJ's chains are the Pazzokies, but this restaurant location in particular always has the whole table's orders out, hot and ready in a timely manner. They even offer to split bill without a single fuss. It makes the group dessert experience so pleasant all around."
Brandi H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",113,37,8,5.0,12/25/2017,"We came here on Christmas Eve with a party of 24. Melissa was awesome! Best server we have had st BJs. Food was great and she was so attentive to our needs. Drinks and appetizers served fast. We sat on the patio and it felt fine with the heater on (but I advise bringing a jacket on cold nights, even with the heaters.). Cheers!!"
Krista B.,"Moorpark, CA",42,51,19,3.0,8/18/2017,"I never go to BJs with high expectations.  The wait is usually long but you can always count consistency with food/drink.  We sat at a high top in the bar.  First round of drinks came out fast as well as appetizers.  I had to ask our waitress 3 TIMES for a glass of water.  She never once apologized for forgetting it, or even acknowledged that she had forgot.  The first 2 times I asked she brought over the cocktails/beers that were ordered but completely spaced on the water.   When it came time to get the check she dropped it off and disappeared.  There were a couple of things we didn't order on there so we waited around for her and finally gave up and flagged down a different waiter to help us.  He was apologetic and got the bill straightened out right away.  We had to flag the other waiter down again to take our cards since our waitress was still MIA and again, he promptly took care of us.  Not sure if our waitress was just having a rough day, but she definitely wasn't on her A game."
A A.,"Camarillo, CA",0,8,,4.0,12/1/2017,"Quick lunch with a group, around 2 PM nice quite and CLEAN, my order was accidentally witched with another, very fast quick visit from the manager he apologized  and super fast replaced with the correct order,  and he did not charge us for my order, I really appreciate it and thanks to all the staff. definitely recommend it and will go back soon."
Danette A.,"Oak Park, CA",0,13,,2.0,1/7/2018,"I keep wanting to give this place a chance, but on very visit, there is always a challenge. First off, why is this place always on a wait on a Friday night until 8:30pm?! Yes I know because most think it's a great place to enjoy a night out with friends or family but if any of my visits were at 100% then I would get it or if their happy hour pricing was worthwhile. Visit #1: Server was new (he told me and my guest) so we went with it. Guests order arrived incorrect. I asked for a glass of wine but sent it back and ordered another. When check arrived, the first glass of wine never removed. After receiving the check, server never returned until about 20 minutes later? So after the check arrives then that completes your service? I usually pay the tip based on the timing of how you close out the table. Visit #2: Sat in the bar this time. Server was monotone and no emotion throughout service. Got my order and my guests order incorrect let alone forgot what we both ordered and had to return to our table to ask again. Write it down, man! When check arrived we asked to have the check split onto 2 credit cards. Took awhile to return with bill and credit cards. Next day, my credit card had fraudulent charges from Mexico City for $700 and the server had charged my card for the full amount of the bill, but voided out and then charged the halved amount. My guest did not have this happen on her credit card. Called manager to advise of this and also that the name of the server on the bill noted a woman's name but our server was a male. Hmmm Visit #3: All I can say is that my guest and I were quite thirsty for water from beginning to end. After check arrived before paying, server no longer inquired if we needed more water but glasses were empty. After we signed the check and paid, we sat at the table for a little longer and no sign of the server to collect or if more water was needed. I get it, it's just water but server should be just as attentive until the guest leaves the table. Visit #4: not sure yet if I want to come back to this place."
Cami T.,"Blotzheim, France",1,33,24,2.0,11/19/2017,Good service but food sucks for the money! The dish of pasta was as expensive as a good Italian restaurant and it was flavorless and pasta were over cooked. The rice quinoa same story.  Definitely not satisfactory for the money.
Sonj H.,"Santa Monica, CA",461,870,358,4.0,6/25/2017,Food quality: 3.5 stars Service: 3.8 stars Ambiance 3.5 stars Serves food till 1 am: 5 stars Pizza:3.5 stars French fries: 2 stars Portobello mushroom burger:4.7 stars - best late night veg option you can find
Mike R.,"Sandy, OR",0,5,2,1.0,12/24/2017,"Really disappointing experience last night.  Went there for a rare evening out with my wife plus our 2 & 4 year olds. Got a salad, steak with asparagus side, and kids plain pasta. Here's the summary of events: - ordered pasta to come plain with no sauce/oil (how my daughter eats it) - waited and they bring a bowl of pasta with oil (middle is room temp, surface is actually cold).  - we call to ask why it's cold and that we requested plain pasta.  Waitress checks with the manager and they said they cannot do that because ""the pasta is premade and sitting in the back"". (Reminder, this is angel hair pasta which takes 5 minutes to make) - they take the bowl away and bring back a ""warm one"" - by the dried surface, they probably put the original the microwave.  - steak arrives.  Ordered med well. See photo depicting menu and actual item.  Steak looks like roadkill which was then over cooked.  - we call someone to inquire if 3 stalks of asparagus (one missing the head) is considered a ""side"".  They admit that isn't right and being a plate of it.  - after we are done, we sit for 10 min waiting for the check or even someone to recognize we are there (notably several tables are empty). We can see other waiters standing on the sides and watching football.  - check finally comes. They have charged us TWICE for the pasta.  This place is a mess.  Take your $ elsewhere"
Sarina G.,"GRANADA HILLS, CA",107,19,6,4.0,12/13/2017,"A few weeks ago, we were there for my boyfriend's birthday, our server Roger was great. He got the food out fast and he was very friendly and funny. He offered my bday a dessert for his birthday and made a joke about singing to him... It really made our experience bette. BJ's is a great place and that one what's has a shorter wait and they are very fast and friendly."
Neko D.,"Malibu, CA",1,10,,5.0,10/30/2017,"Love coming here! Great food, good staff and service, and great for watching sports games.  Manager Monica, in particular, is amazing! If there's ever a request or question, she's on it. Always kind and welcoming! Thank you for being such an amazing manager!"
Athreya A.,"Ontario, CA",85,5,,3.0,12/14/2017,I've been here a couple of times and the service is always subpar. The food is mediocre but not even nearly worth the price you're paying. However the pizookies are to die for. If you have a large party remember to ask for the giant one that comes with a cascade of different flavors!
Ali S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,31,3,1.0,8/20/2017,"I've been to a lot of BJ's and I have to say I found the absolute worst one! It started off when I gave them a call to find out if it was happy hour. I wanted to confirm when it started and when it ended, also if long island ice teas where on the menu. Oddly long islands were recently removed.. Ive been getting long islands from Bjs for over 5 years whenever I hit the happy hour. Not sure if this is a franchise thing or just this location.  When I got there with my gf I asked the hostesses for a booth that so that I could sit next to my GF instead of across, she looked at me like I was asking her to build a rocket-ship then dragged her way over to another table with a shitty look on her face. Our waiter came by and I asked him where the happy hour menu was and he pulls out this stupid Ipad looking thing and says to me that I cannot get happy hour where I'm currently sitting because the technology has changed and drinks cant be rang up at the bar and brought over. Then he repeated to me two times ""but happy hour is only from 3-6"" like it was already past the time or something and it was 530.My mind was blown!  Finally the straw that broke the camels back... My GF asked the waiter if she can have a glass of water and he says to us ""we charge for water"" I'm not sure if this was a joke or not but he sure didn't smile or say he was kidding!!! What is this!?!?! At this point a couple behind us turned around and said ""we've been here for 30 min and no drinks have even been brought out yet"" After all of these circumstances me and my GF decided we are taking our business else where... years of HAPPY BJs dining I have found the absolute worst BJs ever and I'm telling anyone that reads this review go somewhere else you'll thank me for it!! BOYCOTT BJS BREWHOUSE  WESTLAKE VILLAGE 2017! ~cheers"
JoLee Z.,"Calabasas, CA",272,154,714,4.0,4/21/2017,"We came here for the senior banquet, outdoor seating with a pre-decided menu, had a blast! We had 4, 5 different kinds of pizzas, pasta, salad, and the very best pizookie... so good! The outdoor seating had plenty of space to fit 30-40 of us. The server was pretty efficient for that big of a size. We also had a photo booth there, and everything was pretty chill. I would definitely recommend for big groups. The parking was very easy to get- a big parking lot in front of the restaurant."
Sasha P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,3,,1.0,12/8/2017,"The quality of the experience at this BJ's has declined so much recently, it is mind blowing. I came here the other night with my boyfriend and waited by the host stand for 15 minutes trying to make eye contact with someone who worked there, to no avail. Eventually I just seated myself. Waiter after waiter walked by me at the table and didn't even give me a glance. Finally someone noticed us and I asked for a menu. Soon afterwards, a guy appears at our table and hands us menus but speaks in a very manic way that made my boyfriend and I uncomfortable. Finally, we order a couple beers. The waiter we have disappears for over twenty minutes in the back, and as there is barely anyone else at the restaurant, he certainly is not busy helping anyone else. My boyfriend and I consider walking out, but at this point we are very hungry and do not know where else to go. When he returns without our beers, he tells us that someone else has inexplicably taken them but that more beers will be poured. We then order a couple appetizers. We finally get the beers at about the same time as the food and discover that everything we ordered tastes strangely stale, as if perhaps it had been in the freezer and microwaved for a couple minutes. Our waiter disappears for another twenty minutes and we glance around constantly, hoping for his reappearance with the check.  Though this is a place we used to go occasionally for a beer and appetizer, we certainly will not be making another trip. You'd find better quality food and service at the McDonald's down the street."
Leah O.,"Simi Valley, CA",71,171,72,4.0,4/1/2017,"I have been to this BJ's a few times and always had a good tasting meal. The Mediterranean pizza is great, especially with the banana peppers on it. The Peruvian Quinoa with blackened salmon was really good. A solid filling meal. Kids meals are a good size and arrive at a temperature that kids can immediately start eating. Service is good if it isn't too busy, the servers I have had are pleasant."
Bob W.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",0,2,,2.0,12/10/2017,Forget eating breakfast at BJs. Bacon hardly cooked eggs were left in the pan until they looked like a pancake. Toast while not burned apparently had been left in the toaster and had dried out.  Never again. No relief on the check.  No charge for parking!!!
Tom G.,"Westlake Village, CA",105,331,1494,4.0,10/10/2016,Well - for perhaps the 2nd time in a few years we visited BJs for a fund raising event.  I was reasonably well impressed.  We had TWO of the thursday specials = $18.95 for a FULL rack of pork ribs with 2 side dishes and a side salad with a promo mini polozi cookie with ice cream.  Plus we applied their online $10 off and purchase of $35 or more.  So the net cost was $28.90 + tax = about $30 and change.   Although our server suffered a comedy of errors the fare was good and ambiance satisfying.  I think we'll be going back  - and soon.
George M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",9,6,2,1.0,8/6/2017,"Worst BJ 'S Run from this BJ. Salty food. poor quality and bad management We ordered their new prime rib sandwich. Hardly any meat. Fries drench in salt. Could not eat the fries  Told management how bad the food was and we would not come back , they could care less.  This BJS It's basically Junk Food. They have gotten worst  at this location. Go to across a street to Paul Martin. It's 100 times better and same price and has more class."
Yvonne B.,"Camarillo, CA",0,22,1,3.0,11/5/2017,Went in last night for dinner and the food was great but our server seemed so uninterested in us and wasn't to friendly at all. Got sat and got our food in a timely manner. But when it came to our check we literally had to wait 30 minutes. All because i had a gift card that took the partial payment and he couldn't figure out how to do that. Really not hard at all. Boyfriend and i were not happy at all. That's ridiculous and to top it off he didn't offer a discount or anything for making us wait 30 minutes to pay. Really ridiculous if you ask me
Robert A.,"Ventura, CA",46,163,,1.0,9/7/2017,"PROs, CONs, then Summary. Went here with my family and some friends recently. PROs--The food at BJs is usually pretty good.  The pizzas are great and so are the burgers.  Their beers are good to.  The place was clean and so were the restrooms.  There were enough TVs to enjoy some sports. CONs--Where do I start....You think it is a coincidence that this place has several 1 stars??  Never been to a BJs this bad...and I've been to a few.  The service was absolutely terrible.  For starters, one person in our group didn't get her meal until almost 25-30 minutes after everybody else.  My child also didn't get his ice cream, even though all the other kids did.  The wait staff was unable and/or incapable to split the check.  It took him several times, and still couldn't do it.  The manager at the time was even worse.  Very surly, rude, and not helpful at all.  She also stated that they ""don't like large groups.""  Really?  Since when?  I've had many team parties at the one in Oxnard, and always felt welcome there...sometimes with 20-30 people deep.   Rest assured I will inquire with their corporate office to ask if they are a family-friendly restaurant and whether they welcome large groups.  Maybe I'm wrong, and BJs doesn't, I'm just curious if that is the case or not, because it has never been before.  A large company turning down a lot of $$$$ from a large group?  Interesting business model. I've worked in the restaurant industry and it really isn't that hard to split a check, especially if you know BEFOREHAND that you will be doing so.  If this was a rookie waiter, fine, but the manager needs to step up and make the situation better, not worse. Would I go back?  Hell no.  Forget this place.  Many other places in East Ventura County to eat.  If you are hell-bent on BJs, go the extra few minutes to the one in Oxnard.  They will treat you better."
Karen R.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",0,3,2,1.0,12/6/2017,"I've visited many Bj's restaurants in California.  I have to say, this is by far the worst BJ's ever!! We arrived at the restaurant around 5:00 PM.  They sat us at a table and we were given our menus.  It took about 20 minutes before our waiter came to our table to take our order.  My mom ordered the clam chowder soup and I ordered my usual, chopped Asian salad.  It took us another half hour to get our meals.  When we finally got our meals, my mom's soup wasn't hot at all! At best, maybe Luke warm if even that!   My chopped Asian salad was the worst! It wasn't chopped at all.  After a while, the waiter came by to ask if everything was ok and we said, no! We told him about the soup and he took it back.  I explained to the young male waiter, with a thin build, and a high pitched voice, that my chopped Asian salad was not chopped! He told me that's a chopped salad and told him I beg to differ! I explained that I've had this salad numerous times and this is not chopped!  He was trying to make up excuses and told me that the chopped Asian salad has changed. I told him that they need to remove the word chopped, if indeed it has changed. He never asked if I wanted something else.  And he never came back to our table to fill up my iced tea that was empty for the duration of our dinner. He finally came back when it was time to pay the bill. I love BJ's but I won't go back to this one! Does this look chopped to you?"
Andre L.,"Westlake Village, CA",1,10,,2.0,12/4/2017,"Came here on a Monday night to get half off on pizza. I ordered the wings and pizza together. Usually the Wings come out first as an appetizer, then followed by the pizza. I mean how can the wings take as long to cook as the pizza? Lo and behold they came out at the same time. But the disappointing part was that both the wings and pizza were cold. The waiter was unattentive when it came to refilling our drinks and clearing off the table. The only good thing about this dining experience was the Pizookie at the end."
Stephanie K.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,6,,1.0,12/1/2017,"I have to say that I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the Westlake Village CA BJ's.  This location had become the girl's night out location of choice.... until 10/8/17.  Our service was horrible and no one cared AT ALL.  Apparently, the servers felt that they were being paid to watch the game.  Our Sirahcha Queso dip was served with crumbs that even a mouse would have had a hard time using to dip into the queso and we finally had to resort to going to the bar ourselves to get our drinks.  I waited this long to post because I had hoped that the either or both the response to the survey that was sent after our visit and my additional email would have resulted in a response.  **SILENCE** So - BJ's has been removed from the approved list. I wont even go into the visit where a fellow patron decided that the bar was the place to potty train her child (with the father taking the childs deposit to the restroom to dump) and the server telling me that there was nothing that could be done about it. Makes ya wonder what is happening in the kitchen............"
Taylor M.,"Westlake Village, CA",119,1,,1.0,6/30/2017,"What is going on? My family and I have been sitting at BJ's for an hour, no food or any refills. Took 30min to get water. Only ordered 4 entrees and 4 drinks. Took 1 hour to get food and only 39min to eat.  They said they lost our food order? Then they said it was just the next ticket? Apparently they can't keep their story straight. I can't blame it all on the server, but something fishy is going on... and I can't blame it on the food. Manager did apologize, said he didn't know what was going on, and offered free dessert. Unfortunately we were not interested in staying further. They did take off an entire from our bill. But this still leaves my family and I dissatisfied with our overall experience.  With this type of service going on, I'm extremely disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
Tom R.,"Newbury Park, CA",18,89,2,3.0,6/26/2017,"Went here for a easy relaxed dinner but it didnt go well. They dont seem to know how to cook a baked potato, I had to send it back twice to get one I could eat.  The waiter was quite nice about it but I had to say something about a manager coming over to say something to him before he did and I was watching him after the waiter told him I want to see him.  He avoided coming by for several minutes and I could see he was quite stressed about have to face us.  Not the best experience but we have had worse."
Megan F.,"Simi Valley, CA",79,1,,1.0,11/5/2017,"I normally always love my meals BJ's, my boyfriend and I come often. Tonight we visited this location and no one acknowledged that we were here. We wait about 20 minutes before we finally waived someone down to take our order. When we stopped a young man he claimed he wasn't our waiter, and he would send our waiter over. When a man arrived he was short and wasn't happy we bothered him to come over. We ordered 2 pizookies and neither of them came out cooked. They were both undercooked and luke warm. Very disappointed in this location tonight."
Ryan K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,8,,2.0,12/18/2017,"To start off, I come here a fair amount for get togethers and celebrations. From my experience the food is always good and the service has been fine as well. But tonight I probably had the worst service I have ever experienced. My friends and I were meeting up here to celebrate one of our friends. The experience started well, but went all downhill from there. I was here with several friends and we got our 1st set of drinks and proceeded to order food. 1) The waiter 100% forgot about the burger that my friend had ordered. He didn't bring it out for about an hour, and said, ""This is a fresh one, not the one that has been sitting there for a while"". Yet the burger was luke warm and unappetizing.  2) Another friends ordered a plate of burnt sausages as an appetizer. 3) I ordered a small pizza. To find out once I received my check that small pizza's weren't actually on sale. Why would I pay 17$ for a small pizza, instead of 10$ for a large? And why didn't the waiter let me know that a small was not part of the deal? 4) After the first beer our friend asked for a water. The waiter didn't come back. Ever. We honestly watched him walk to his other 4 tables with a tray of water and give them all water, and he neglected us. Needless to say, the water never came until 2 more times of asking. About 40 min later (Beginning to see a trend). 5) One friend asked for a check, 30 min later it finally arrived. She left angry leaving zero tip. And proceeded to ask for our checks as well. 30 min later we got our checks. This was the one and only time I've almost walked out of a restaurant, simply because the waiter was so oblivious that he wouldn't have even noticed that we were missing anyway. I work in customer service, and 5 tables is NOT difficult for any server. So in my eyes there is simply no excuse for this poor of service. My friends and I came for food an pizzokies, and we had terrible food and no pizzokies. I was legitimately too scared to order a pizzokie incase it took 30min longer.   Cliff Notes: Worst service I've ever had in any BJ's location. I rarely saw him, anything we ordered came on average 30 min later or not at all. This guy just left a sour taste in my mouth. Sorry BJ's, I used to love ya. But I wouldn't wish that poor of service on my worst enemy."
Caroline C.,"Palm Beach, FL",240,43,13,5.0,7/14/2017,Came here tonight for dessert. The waiter we had was excellent and the pizzookie was even better! I had the Oreo pizookie with vanilla ice cream and my friend had the salted caramel pizookie with vanilla ice cream. Both desserts were incredible. I can't wait to return and try the other flavors! I also found out they have half off on Mondays so I will definitely be returning for that bargain! This is such a fun place to go with friends and it is now one of my new favorite spots.
Art G.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,4,4.0,10/19/2017,"My daughter and I stopped by to grab a quick bite to eat after spending the day at Griffith Park Observatory and we were hungry. We decided on BJ's because we have always enjoyed their food and service. I don't know what happened tonight, but service was lacking. I won't go into details, but I am happy to report that after I complained about the service, Monica the manager and the wait staff apologized profusely and our dinner was comped. No questions asked. I will definitely be back! I really enjoy BJ's. Thank you BJ's!"
Rog L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,7,,1.0,5/14/2017,"Terrible experience on 5/13, we came in to celebrate and had 6 people in our party. Once we were seated it took 20 minutes before our server arrived. We placed the apps, and meals at the same time as we were concerned that it would take forever.  30 minutes later the server came back with soda refills and said they dropped all of our appetizers on the floor and they were being remade. Our entrees may come first. 15 minutes later our first entree arrived cold. We asked for a manager and a person in a dress shirt appeared. I shared our experience and he just walked away.  He comes back with 2 of our entrees. I asked what was going on and he said ""I went to get your food"". My daughter who works in the restaurant business asked if he was the kitchen or floor manager. He said he was a supervisor and walked away.  Really really long story short the celebration we wanted to have was ruined at BJ's due to awful service and an awful attitude of a person purporting to be a manager.  To the credit of the ""Manager"" working our meal, that we mostly did not eat was comped.  Overall rating: Can't give a 0 star so they get a 1. Awful service, avoid this place."
Mitch K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",44,219,12,2.0,4/6/2017,"We went in last night because I received an email that because of National Deep Dish Pizza day, that they were offering the large deep dish pizza at half off.  We arrive at 7pm and we place or order about 7:10.  We didn't leave until 8:40pm. We ordered a large deep dish pizza and asked for a starter salad and crispy artichokes along with other entrees.  The salad arrived at our table at 7:25 and the artichokes arrived at 7:40.  Our pizza and other entrees arrive a little after 8pm.  A few minutes after ordering our server went on break and another took over.  I am not blaming him but I kept hearing him apologize to us on the wait and I even heard him tell the table behind us that the manager was taking the pizza off of their bill due to the long wait. It seems to me that they were not prepared for increased business due to the promotion.  I could understand it taking a little longer to get us a large pizza due to the amount of other orders they must have had, but for salads and appetizers?!?!  We waited about 10 minutes for our server to come to our table was were were done, and we asked for two boxes for leftovers and it took him two trips, and then when he brought the bill, the pizza was charged at full price.  I had to wait longer for him to come back and then wait even longer for it to be corrected. It seems that the management didn't do their job in preparation for the night.  Disappointing!"
Don R.,"Bellevue, WA",201,18,1,3.0,5/1/2017,#frontofthehouse #waitstaff #waitertrainer  Sat us at a petite table jammed in behind a large table (I am not a small guy) when there were plenty of other tables available that would have been more comfy. Our waiter greeted us promptly and returned with our drinks in a timely fashion. He was 'nice enough'. No suggestive selling when it came time to order our meals. He did agree with our choices. Food was served in a reasonable amount of time. Waiter did not check back. Eventually swung by to bring yet another glass of water on our small table (no thanks & did not ask). We were having an early birthday celebration and were planning on desert but he dropped the check without warning nor asking. (This is a definite violation of my 12 commitments). Overall nice meal at a cramped table with less than stellar service. His tip reflected as such.
Paul W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,6,1,5.0,7/10/2017,If you're going to take reservations then you should honor them. Arrived right on time on a Monday night. Still waiting to be seated 30 minutes later. I bet the food is pretty good. Can't tell from the front door though. I TAKE IT ALL BACK!  They comp'd our entire bill for 10 people!  Impressive!!!
Frank E.,"Newbury Park, CA",192,22,1,5.0,9/10/2017,What an awesome place!!  It's alway a fun place to hang out and get a cold beer after a Westlake High School Football Game!!
Brittany S.,"Moorpark, CA",0,17,4,2.0,12/8/2017,Was pretty amazed when we asked our waiter in private if he could sing happy birthday with the team they said they don't do that. So our party sang to our friend on our own because what restaurant doesn't do that. I hardly ever leave negative reviews.
