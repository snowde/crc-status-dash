Megan E.,"Agoura Hills, CA",93,94,173,2.0,9/9/2014,"Definitely need to update my review after last nights experience. Seriously management needs to do something about that RUDE hostess that they have (She has black hair and is hispanic/asian looking & about 5'3) I unfortunately did not get her name but I'm sure she is easy to point out. I don't understand how she got a job in the customer service industry seeing as in how she seems to hate everyone.  So... My mom, brother and I walked up to the host stand to be seated (it was empty) we waited for about a minute until someone finally showed up (this is SO unlike BJs because there is always someone at that stand.) Guess who showed up? The super happy hostess!-NOT! I kid you not this girl did not even smile when she walked up to the host stand. She didn't even greet us with a hello, she just said how many? (rudely I might add)  After we told her how many people were in our party she began to walk to a table-- let me add that she didn't even say ""right this way please"" or anything... she just expected us to follow. As we made our way to our table she was SO far ahead of us (I was a hostess at one point in life, and I know very well that you are supposed to make the customer feel welcomed and comfortable) and she did NOTHING of the sort. We finally caught up to her as she was slouching with attitude as if she wanted us to hurry up. My mom even caught on and said ""wow what's up with this girl?"" -- we got in our booth and she literally threw the menus down at each of us and stormed off! I kid you not, SHE THREW THEM!! At this point, I just wanted to leave. I was SO disappointed, more so because I always come to BJs and this girl ALWAYS looks SO miserable... and not only does she look miserable, but she acts like it too, and boy does it rub off on the customers. I mean I totally understand that everyone has their bad days, but every time I see this girl she is so unhappy. I am so mad at myself for not getting her name but I do have a perfect (maybe not so appropriate) description of her so that you guys know to watch out! [[If I find out her name, I will update my review with it.]] Basically, if someone were to ask me to describe what she looks like I would say: The short pretty Asian/spanish looking girl with the look of hatred permanently glued on her face who has black hair and is skinnier up top but heavier on her bottom half.  (SORRY! rude & TMI but it has to be said) Management seriously needs to sit this girl down have have a chat about customer service because I can honestly say that I will not be back to BJ's because of this girls nasty attitude.  On the other hand, my server was lovely. She was tall and thin and had super short hair. Excellent service by her. I think her name was Katie or Jamie but I could be totally wrong-haha."
Z C.,"Agoura Hills, CA",37,180,14,4.0,12/22/2015,"Nothing wrong with this place and nothing overly exciting. Friend from Canada got carded once (he's 23) and manager came out to quiz him on his Canadian sports team to make sure his driver's license was real haha.  Usually get the BBQ pulled pork when I come here, but they have since taken it off the menu. You can still order it though."
Kandace U.,"Simi Valley, CA",182,71,67,1.0,7/17/2015,If I could give this place zero stars I would  service is horrible took 20 mins to place our order appetizers were delivered and the waiter was so careless to even acknowledge we had no silverware or napkins  our food finally came out 30 mins later with wrong  orders how hard is it to make a bacon burger  take your money elsewhere    Couldn't even get a refill on my drink
Kay H.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",5,54,,4.0,10/20/2015,"BJs is awesome. I love their food variety. They have everything you can thing of for an American Resturant, and a full bar.  Their appetizers are awesome specially the Avocado rolls. They now offer deep dish pizza as well. I love their Ahi tuna salad, their crispy chicken plate, and their shrimp scampi. The only problem is that they are loaded with calories.  We always go there on our cheat day."
Dr. Suzan S.,"Malibu, CA",10,18,,3.0,6/19/2015,"I went here with a large party of people, about 11. We were seated immediately since the restaurant was mostly deserted except for one other fairly large party of people across the room from us. We waited for about 30 minutes for someone to take our order, then almost an HOUR to get our food. I had to ask for a glass of water FIVE times and when the bill came, after another hour of waiting for it, the waitress tried to make off with rest of my change. I waited for her to bring it back for about 40 minutes before I got up, tracked her down and had to request back the remaining several dollars of change. Terrible service."
Zac D.,"Omaha, NE",37,206,223,3.0,6/15/2013,"Hostesses were friendly and welcomed us upon arrival. Our waiter was attentive at first but dropped off and walked past us when our drinks were empty several times. He eventually did refill our drinks and apologized for the delay though so that was nice he acknowledged it. I got the new bison burger with a green chili on top of it, I thought it had a good savory flavor and was lite but filling. However, the slaw it domes with it tastes straight out of a bag with no sauce on it. I would recommend trying the bison burger, but substituting for another side. It was a very good price also, less than $10. Word of advice, call ahead if you are coming on weekends or for dinner any day because there are long waits here. If you are sitting at the bar, you're set because its open seating. But if you want to sit at a table to eat, call ahead and get your name on the waitlist and your actual time sitting in the waiting area will be drastically cut down."
Victoria L.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,4,,5.0,8/25/2015,"Came in for a late dinner the other night with a friend before going to see a movie across the street. Was not thrilled with the service of the hostess who seemed like she wanted to be anywhere but there at work. We were seated and waited about 10 minutes for our drink orders to be taken. When we finally had a bartender come take our orders we asked if we could also place our food orders, she said she would let our server know we were ready to order. At this point we were somewhat irritated with the service but being that both of us are servers ourselves, we know things can get crazy at times and didn't think much about it. When our server Blakely came to the table, he immediately turned our visit around and was extremely welcoming, cheerful and helpful. Being a server myself, I can get annoyed when I have a guest who has a million requests like we did that night but he accommodated each one without hesitation and went out of his way to assist us. He should absolutely be recognized for his outstanding service.  Thank you again Blakely!!! We will definitely be back!!!"
Justin M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",192,20,3,4.0,11/24/2015,"Well the food was great we got a deep dish pizza very fresh and good, they didn't cheap the meat they lay it on there pretty heavy. For an appetizer I had avocado egg rolls they were delicious very flavorful. The beer selection was great I loved all the beer I tried. But what was even better is how knowledgable are server was of the beer he was great and truly knew his stuff. Not only that he was very helpful Daniel was a great server, and made the experience so great, I'll be back for sure!! The only reason it's not five stars is the restaurants acoustics suck when there is a lot of people it's loud!!"
Jack P.,"San Ramon, CA",21,318,314,4.0,7/27/2014,Good but not outstanding food and service.  Open late night so good standby if your hungry and want a brew - large selection of beers on tap.  Good prices.  I like the chilli and a beer as a night cap. The happy hour Sliders are very good to end a night.  Late night bar tenders still trying hard to please.
Steve C.,"Westlake Village, CA",15,29,40,1.0,10/30/2015,"I wish I could say that I liked the service or the food.  They don't deserve to serve food to human beings.  The quality is poor and no matter how much i would like for them to care they do not.  It's a sad thing.  You'd think that a business in Westlake Village would take thing seriously.  Unfortunately, this company has decided that they don't need to care.  That makes me sad."
Celina M.,"San Mateo, CA",168,5,2,1.0,8/12/2016,"Dont Waste Your time or money . My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner as we love BJ's and are from out of town. First off we weren't greeted nor even acknowledged by the hosts. They chatted among rachother and then the host answered the phone, proceeded to walk away and ignore us UNTIL finally another host came to seat us. Now we were finally seated and were given drinks, orders taken. The restaurant was NOT busy at all, in fact they were sending waitors home because it was so slow, therefore there should not be a reason why our food took 45 minutes. Within those 45 minutes we watched as two other guests had to ask 3 different waiters, 3 different times if they can have some utensils (shouldve been brought in the first place) while there food was probably cold by the time they recieved there utensils. Not to mention the waiter who went to retrieve utensils for the couple stopped in his tracks to hug and chat with some friends who had just walked in. When we finally got our food , my deep dish raviollis were not even cooked. Still hard, some even dried/crusted. Finally fed up i sent the pasta back and asked for a manager . Yet, the manager had better things to do because she just sent the waitress back to tell us they wouldnt charge for any other food i wanted to substitute in for the uncooked pasta. NEVER again. Definatly ruined my boyfriends birthday dinner . Horrible service ."
Michelle C.,"Oxnard, CA",92,5,1,1.0,5/23/2015,The service here sucks! We waited for a good 20 mins for someone to come and take our order. Waited another 30 mins till our food came out. I ordered steak and told them to cook it medium rare. Steak came out medium well and hard as hell. We won't be coming here again.
Afroditi P.,"Simi Valley, CA",15,6,,3.0,11/25/2015,Took too long for main entrees. Over half hour after appetizer was finished. Don't know why I didn't complain. Atleast the food was hot and good when it finally arrived. Really disappointed
Howard M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",9,75,5,5.0,6/18/2014,"Had an after Dance Recital family get together on Saturday (14th) and it was terrific. The server was Christine and it was absolutely perfect.  Food was excellent. You can tell that the new General Manager, Brandy, has instilled a positive attitude in everyone.  I'll be back!"
Alex B.,"Simi Valley, CA",52,6,,5.0,10/3/2015,"All 5 stars are for Blakely, he was stupendous! Not only was the service from him exemplary, but a charming personality to go with it! Give this guy a promotion, will ya!?"
Sande M.,"Newbury Park, CA",36,76,,2.0,5/24/2016,"Had a great lunch with plenty of leftovers.  However; the bread bowls are not the same. They are burnt and larger. The restaurant was almost empty and serice wasn't the greatest. Are the larger portions making up for the new menu changes? Bowl of clam chowder is more like a cup. Doesn't even taste the same as the prior clam chowder. Just measured it. It is a little less than a cup and I requested a ""bowl"". Won't even fill this larger bread bowl now. Seemed to give me a lot of the Ahi Poke. Is the tuna going bad? Have to question that although it tasted fresh. Is there new management there??"
Bri K.,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, CA",112,70,30,2.0,6/8/2014,"First off, the restaurant was half empty, NOT busy.  So my mahi mahi tacos didn't come out for about 40 minutes and the server's reason was different than the manager's--either the chef made fish tacos ""wrong"" and had to remake them or they gave the tacos to another table....  When I finally got my food and saw I waited all that time for two tiny tacos with barely any meat, I was pretty annoyed.  And my bf's burger was under the heat lamp the entire time we waited for them to fix my food situation and he said the bun was burnt and the burger tasted like it had been sitting out for a while--really inexcusable.  The manager didn't offer anything to rectify the situation."
Joellen S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,9,,4.0,5/27/2015,I went to Bjs tonight after not having visited in a long time.   I found that the food was still mediocre quality ( except for the mini pizookie..it was amazing!). But the bartender Tyler was great!  Very friendly and efficient and knowledgable about the menu.   Food gets 3 stars but service gets a 5!
Eric E.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,15,5,1.0,3/27/2015,"Horrible, terrible...... After our reservation was 20 min late, and glasses stayed empty for far too long, the food came finally. My Bison burger was the driest, most sad piece of meat I've ever bit into. After telling the waiter, he took it back to the kitchen (though I didn't even want anything at that point), they brought back another (that looked better than the last one), though with three people watching behind me I felt absolutely no desire to bite into a possibility spit filled replacement. Don't get me started about how they wanted us to split the bill...... Holy Christ......"
Marcia G.,"Canoga Park, Los Angeles, CA",45,242,150,3.0,4/28/2014,"I've been to BJs a few times, this was my first time at this location. BJs has pretty good food. You'll get a wide variety of options no matter what you're in the mood for. Good sandwiches, pizzas, salads, pastas and desserts. I haven't had much experience with all of the food but I can vouch for the pizzas, sandwiches and their chili (made w one of their beers).  This evening we ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which is always yummy (deep dish style) and the pizookie (cookie baked like a deep dish pizza and topped with ice cream). Both very yummy as always. It's pretty hard to come to a BJs and not have a pizookie, they are so delicious; you can share one or get a mini for yourself and they have a few different flavors. They also have a full bar with a bunch of great beer options.  I had a fruit beer and hubby had a pale ale which we both enjoyed. They have HH from 4-6 so their drinks are reduced priced so a good time to stop in.  Would definitely come here again for food and drinks with some friends or even just to watch a game at the bar and enjoy their HH."
