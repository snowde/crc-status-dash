Shawna O.,"Santa Barbara, CA",347,13,8,5.0,3/6/2017,Absolutely love this restaurant! Although it is a chain it never fails to disappoint me. They are very consistent with their food & the waiters are extremely friendly. They have a great BJs reward system which is beneficial for those who visit regularly! I suggest going there for your next date night!!
Cam S.,"Cleveland, OH",221,5,,5.0,1/30/2017,Great food and great service! Phillie is awesome! Id definatly reccomend BJs to everyone.
Daniel V.,"Mission Hills, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/29/2017,"I'm not satisfied with my meal today. I came to bj's brewhouse for the first time and I was very disappointed. I noticed that bjs didn't have paper napkins, I prefer paper napkins because they are nice. I didn't like my kid's burger I also got the smiley face potatoes, disgraceful. Smiley faces are happy this thing looked scared. Wasn't satisfied wouldn't recommend to anyone. Come here for sad faces, not smiley faces. Also the pizookie ice cream melted automatically couldn't handle it, too hard to think what to do next."
Scott W.,"Camarillo, CA",2,4,,1.0,10/4/2017,well quite interesting! please have at least have 1-2 hours to wait just for a soda! make sure you verbally agree with the waiter they kept on getting the order wrong and its on an wednesday! please don't come unless you can wait that long!
T S.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",192,29,8,3.0,1/18/2017,"Had lunch there this afternoon. Didn't want to complain in front of my my new boss, but our server Kyle was horrible. Took forever to get drinks and hard getting his attention for anything. He just wasn't friendly at all. I do love the lunch specials but I hope we don't get Kyle again as our server. There are other friendly servers there."
Adrian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",156,102,108,3.0,10/14/2016,"Gracious service but poor follow through: no gas in the patio heater made for a cold October meal.  Plates were not cleared (we had a wedding party of 30.)  Additional heaters did not come on though promised.  Pizza is puffy but strangely unappetizing.  The balsamic dressing was tasty.  The chicken and rice was perfect; though whole grain rice would have had more character, or at least a broth based pilaf..."
Frankie M.,"Van Nuys, Los Angeles, CA",0,155,,3.0,11/6/2016,"Great location, love BJs, it's a really nice restaurant, lot of space, and the food is always amazing. Get a pazookie! The service was so bad though. Extremely slow, the waiter never checked on us, we were waiting forever for food and to get checks. Besides that, great place!"
Maryam P.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,1,,4.0,12/30/2016,I would like thank Taylor for tonight  You are nice and I promise to order chicken pamesan next time  I really appreciate your kindness and would love to see you again  Happy new year
Ryan D.,"Seaside, CA",121,3,,5.0,12/30/2016,"I had my wife's birthday party here last night.  We had a large group of 20+ including several children.  BJ's set us up in the back patio which was great as we were able to all communicate around the table easily.  The servers (Alise and Patrick) were very attentive to our needs and accommodated all drink and food orders promptly,  our whole party was served their entrees in about 2 minutes total and the food was great.  Thank you BJs for hosting a terrific party.  I would highly recommend having a large group event at this location!"
Phillpe K.,"Oak Park, CA",7,69,71,2.0,5/30/2015,"Ordered the B J favorite pizza. I guess the chef uses no cheese at all or marinara sauce on a pizza. There was none. Wouldn't order again . The food is better in your memory than in person. Too nice a place to have ok food. Manager needs to look at the chef. Chicken fingers ok. Salmon ok. Nothing terrific but the atmosphere. Boss .... Clean the shades please!!!! They are filthy so people, don't touch them at the windows. The picture below is just as good as here."
David K.,"Manteca, CA",7,14,30,2.0,9/1/2016,This was the worst visit to a B J's I ever had. From what that staff is they let go of the runners. I guess this place has always been hit and miss.
Amanda H.,"Raeford, NC",1,22,5,5.0,12/20/2016,"I ordered the California chicken sandwich. The waiter, Robert, was very pleasant. He always made sure the drinks were filled and was very attentive. Food is great!!"
Kristina H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/22/2017,"Tried again. Called to get on the list and was told ""no wait, come on over"". Get there and it's 25 mins. I'm trying to get a table for 2, you're really going to tell me that it changed that much in the 10 mins it took me to get there?"
Patrick R.,"Westlake Village, CA",1,15,,2.0,9/8/2016,"Great tap selection and sports coverage. Food is usually solid too. Dreadful service in the booth areas, however. Our waitress introduced herself, said hi, and then never saw her again. I'm assuming she went to go work on her memoir."
Robyn C.,"Simi Valley, CA",202,233,421,4.0,12/13/2014,"I like BJ's and this location has always been good for us. It is a great place to come after sports games or shows at school with a large crowd. They are open late which is a plus. The food is pretty good.  The menu is quite extensive and everyone can usually find something they like. The portions are large and I always end up taking half of my meal home. I have tried a variety of items on the menu and everything has been delicious.  I especially like the roast beef dip, the pizza, the wedge salad, any of the soups or chili, and and the crispy fried artichokes, The pizookies are super yummy and it is always hard to choose which flavor to get. The offer a full service bar and if you like beer, the beer samplers are the way to go! Service is usually good and the servers are friendly. Sometimes when they are busy, it can get kind of slow.  The restaurant gets busy, especially on the weekends, so call ahead for seating. The adjacent parking lot gets full quickly, so you may have to park farther away and walk over."
Rebecca P.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,54,23,1.0,5/7/2017,Can't even place a takeout order... on hold nearly a half hour and call back and can't even get connected to a manager.  Ridiculous.  I guess they don't want our business.  Picking up In N Out instead.
A M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,85,,2.0,5/25/2017,"Visit on 5/24: Overall a poor experience. The food was not bad and what would be expected from BJ chain albeit even the deep dish pizza used to be better. The service was the main issue. They did not have enough staffing and our service person was not very proficient and even rolled her eyes when asked questions. Too rushed. etc. We asked for a new person in fact and it was partially granted. The wait for everything was long to the point that we were there for over two hours last night. Took forever to get appetizers and then just as long for dinner. So by then, everyone had lost their appetites and it was getting close to 10pm and everybody was tired. A manager person came at the end but was a half-ass attempt at the best. Would not be coming back."
Zach G.,"Oak Park, CA",158,30,3,5.0,10/8/2016,The food here so great I really loved it everybody was so nice all the servers are great. The pizza there was a five of us I hope I will beat you go there soon this food is so good and delicious I will come there all the time.
John M.,"Stewartsville, NJ",0,31,,5.0,4/24/2017,"The great service started with Josie at the hostess stand.  It was clearly an extremely busy evening and she was calm and cool even as I requested that we increase our table size.  I knew it was a long shot, but she was able to accommodate us.  Then our server was excellent (I believe her name was Taylor). There were ten of us and some of the group showed up late.  We placed dinner orders at multiple times and she got everything perfect and our meals flowed and she kept the refills coming.  The food is always good here but I must say on this trip the service was outstanding!"
Ej F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",427,497,1567,2.0,10/19/2013,"Good beer selection, decent food (pizzas, burgers, pizookies), but do not go here if you are in a rush or have to catch a movie that night. Ok to go if you want to catch a game at the bar or ain't got nowhere else to be later. Recently came here (second time) to eat with a group of good friends.  When I ordered my dinner I asked for the bill to be separate for my date and I, but when the check came for the table there was just one.  They subsequently offered to split it for us (and everyone else) which seemed like a fine idea, but it took forever to be figured out and multiple attempts to get it right for each of us. Servers are nice and they acknowledge the deficiencies (I feel they have some experience with the slowness of food and related complaints/problems).  Also there was a transition to a new waiter (different person took our order). They are attentive, mostly for refills on drinks since the wait for food is so inexplicably long!"
