George M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,16,6,1.0,12/27/2015,Bad service and everything is premade or seasoned. They discriminate against class of people with allergies to garlic. They should be sued for failing to accomodate this special class of people
LD H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,9,1,2.0,8/3/2016,"I've been here 4 times and  3 times my order is been wrong. I have always liked the food in the past at other locations. Especially when I get my order right. I like the music and ambience it's a nice atmosphere in the early evening before gets too crowded before happy hour.  I'm not picky by any means, all I'm asking for is a pizza with basil spinach garlic artichoke tomato and easy cheese. How hard can that be?  I'm not that person who likes to send food back believe me... I know what happens. BUT Having to send something back is already humiliating for the server and myself. But when I order something special and you don't check it before you bring it to my table, that's not OK. For the 3rd time... The manager finally had to come out and re input my order. And by the way,  I never asked for a manager for the first two times. This time they gave me a whole dollar off of my bill! WOW. REALLY? I don't want anything for free but now it's the fact that you messed up so many times! Get it together BJ's Update:  1 star to 3 stars. 2 managers came back after seeing my comment on my bill and saw my disappointment in my meal and I ended up with a comp and a gift card. I'm going back with my gift card and gonna give them another try... and will update again as need be. Thanks for stepping up Brandy and Ralph  Update 2. So sorry to say my next visit wasn't was what I was wishing for. Pizza order was missing a topping and too much cheese on an ""easy cheese"" request. Really  sorry it never works out! I love my pizza at your place when it's done correctly. 1 out of  5 times... Manager Teeni (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was very nice and Apologetic and resolved the issue to our liking. (This time I took a friend) but I can't help but be disappointed again. Back down to 2 stars"
Bianca R.,"Oxnard, CA",13,25,3,1.0,2/28/2017,I have come to this location on various occasions and at different times of the day and it never fails that I get a bad server or maybe they just don't pay attention to everyone -_- when I first arrived I was seated quickly but we didn't get any plates or silverware with napkins it's took about 15 min for the drinks to arrive at which point they had no ice we didn't get straws once we got our appetizer we got no pates I had to still ask for silverware I had to cut my own pizza as well. It took him about a 25/30 minutes to come back to check on us when I had needed a drink for a while before that when he came and dropped them off we were just about finishing up our plates I was hoping he would have noticed and offered to bring the check but instead it took him about another 10 min to come back and check on us overall what I expected to be a 30 min dinner because it wasn't to busy turned into an hour the food was warm and not that great which is why I'm giving one star since I was pretty hungry i was able to eat half my pizza some half was soggy from the sauce I probably won't be going back to this location
Lindsey D.,"Oxnard, CA",0,5,,1.0,1/18/2017,Came back for happy hour tonight. Terrible service and I am yet to receive the gift card the gm said she would send me. Tonight are food was mediocre and cold. Did not complain as it's been obvious guests are not a focus here. Staff stood around the bar talking without a care. Bleh! Terrible customer service. Won't be visiting this location again.
Kelsey K.,"Westlake Village, CA",65,14,,1.0,6/5/2016,Clearly management doesn't take anything seriously. Still upset over the entire situation and most of all can't believe management let someone continue to work there after cursing at customers.
Carrie T.,"Kent, WA",1,195,4,4.0,3/5/2016,"This is a standard chain restaurant with multiple choices so you can get salads, burgers, bar food etc like many others but the food was good. It wasn't ""greasy"" and the service was great and very attentive. We ordered drinks and appetizers so we can share.  I really like the wings. they were crispy and the sauce was drizzled instead of soaked.  It was good. I got to taste the crispiness of the wings. The ahi poke was good. The nachos were freshly made and guacamole was tasty too. Calamari was ok, not the best I had and lastly chicken lettuce wraps.  The wraps were good but needed more chicken to put in the lettuce wrap. There were more lettuce than chicken.  Overall it was good and tasty and all the staff were great!"
My P.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",564,193,331,4.0,5/27/2016,Visiting Thousand Oaks and getting my pizookie fix satisfied. It is the best cookie and ice cream ever.
Celeste W.,"Los Angeles, CA",441,217,444,2.0,9/22/2015,"My husband used to come to this location all the time when he worked down the street, and he always spoke very highly of the staff and his meal, which he used the app to place ahead of time.  We are both fans of other BJ's locations, but I've only been to this one a handful of times.  At 6:15 my husband placed our ""Dine In Order Ahead"" on his mobile app. We arrived at BJ's at 6:45 (the time we selected on the app) and after 5 minutes of the desk fiddling around not finding our name they handed us a pager and said ""we'll call you when something is ready"" Ummmmmm.  Isn't the the whole point of the app not to wait in line with everyone else? We were not seated for 20 minutes.  On a Tuesday night.  Maybe I'm oversensitive on the issue.  But the point of the app is to ""revolutionize"" my dining experience and then I have bad customer service from the front desk with minimal information as to when my advanced order will be ready and dirty looks like we are inconveniencing them by having used the app.  When our buzzer finally buzzed 20 minutes later I heard the host telling the party ahead of us it would be a 5-10 minute wait. Outrageous! Our waiter brought us menus and asked if we would like to start with any appetizers. We told him that we already ordered on the app & he looked at us and said well what about what would you like to drink and we again told him we ordered our drinks on the app, too. It was very frustrating for us and he really didn't seem to care very much.  They messed up my husbands order which is crazy because again, we ordered it on the app.  In the end the food was fine. But it would have been twice as good & a 5 star experience if we were seated in the 5 minutes it took them to ignore us in the beginning."
Rabiei R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/13/2017,"Great food and great service . Visited the restaurant for lunch today ,Our server Harrison was great , we will be back for sure . Thank you for great experience."
Kris T.,"Simi Valley, CA",148,41,11,5.0,9/18/2016,"I came here for the first time last night and I'm so happy with the whole experience, atmosphere and service. I will DEFINITELY be coming back. My server Alex Hudson was extremely nice and helpful. I ordered a delicious IPA from their brew house! I can't wait to come back with my friends and family!!!"
Jason B.,"San Gabriel, CA",5,21,1,2.0,2/23/2016,Nothing special just normal American diner very similar to claim jumpers or any of the pseudo real restaurant  places. Not a bad place to watch a game though and family friendly. Waitress was extremely nice and helpful as well. Great staff.  Had to drop my review a star after my most recent visit. Service took forever. We maybe saw our waiter twice the entire night. Seems like this place is getting worse.
Ddas E.,"Perrysburg, OH",3,29,9,3.0,8/20/2016,"Nice place with lots of options for brewed beer. Though there's lots of seating space, do get your tables booked if you are going in a large group."
Jordyn L.,"Westlake Village, CA",75,232,43,4.0,10/3/2015,"I always come in here for happy hour because they have a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. Parking can be tough, but you can usually find parking at the Ralphs on the other side of the lot. Ryan is one of our favorite servers and always makes an effort to go above and beyond!"
Gloria D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,1,1.0,5/18/2016,"HORRIBLE. The service was disappointing, the soup was tasteless THEN we found a hair in another diner's entree. It looked too much like a pubic hair to consider ordering another entree. The manager modified our bill. I'm grateful for that. Ugh. My whole family will never go again."
Kelsey H.,"Moorpark, CA",65,11,3,2.0,6/25/2016,"My family and I went to BJ's for the first time this week. I was really excited because I had heard such great things about the food and prices!  I was glad to see that all that I heard was true!!  But it turned out that the service was terrible.  There were so many open tables but they still made us wait for 30 minutes. And then it took at least 15 minutes for a server to even come up to the table. At that time the server told us ""I will be right with you"" but she still took forever!  By the time the waitress finally came to take our drink order we had been there for almost an hour. And the food took even longer to come out. And on top of that the waitress messed up our order. But I do have to say that once everything was corrected, the food turned out to be very good, and the bill wasn't too expensive. The meals were very large and I couldn't quite finish my salad but I was able to take it home and save it for the next day.  I hope that the service was only a one time deal and that if I decide to go again BJ's will step up their game."
Max B.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",16,22,2,5.0,8/31/2016,I am a huge fan of this place.  The pizookie sate always on point and the burgers (especially the Brewhouse burger) are key.  Their parmesan crusted chicken is truly amazing and their pizzas are up to par.  I have never and will never turn someone down that recommends this BJs.
Tom L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,,1.0,2/26/2017,"Should of checked out the reviews of this place, BAD news slow service , cold food, rude servers. Went up to the manager to complain and she seamed to not even care. Don't wast your money!! Go to places that want your business"
Natalie K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1164,913,2031,4.0,1/19/2013,I have been to so many BJs locations and I honestly have to say that this one is the best by far in terms of service. I'm surprised to see only 3 stars on yelp because my experience was quite great. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived. They gave us a buzzer and we ended up only waiting about 5 minutes before being seated. The host and the server were both extremely friendly. Our food also came pretty quickly. My friend had their pizza and I ordered the salmon. I know their pizza is great but I really wasn't in the mood for it. My friend enjoyed her BBQ chicken pizza a lot. My piece of salmon was huge and it tasted fresh. It is served with this flavorful rice pilaf that has a hint of curry. I ordered a beer but my friend had a blueberry mojito and she loved it. Actually it may be blackberry. I'm not 100% sure but she did say it was one of the best mojitos she's had. My only complaint is that this particular BJs is more like a family restaurant than a restaurant/bar. We went for happy hour and I was surprised to see so many children running around. The table next to us consisted of 6 adults and 10 kids under the age of 8.
Hannah A.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,4,5,1.0,3/12/2017,"Not good. My second time going and it was just as bad if not worse than the first. I have been here for 2 1/2 hours and we get little to no check ins. Yikes, don't waste your time."
Steve S.,"Encino, CA",62,196,88,3.0,7/18/2015,"BJ's is an oldie, but goodie.  It's like a corporate style level of quality. Not much creativity and nothing that is very unique. Kinda what I would say is average casual dining.   The beers are fairly decent and the pizzas are good.  The pazookies will give you diabetes with 2 trips though. :)"
