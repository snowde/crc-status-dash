Tammy O.,"Los Angeles, CA",347,23,17,1.0,8/28/2015,"So this Friday night my family and I decided to bring home takeout from BJ's just because we felt like staying in tonight.  So I called and placed our order that was for about 4 people and the take out attendant said it would take about 20 minutes.  Once upon arrival, it took about 10 minutes for the curb side attendant to come and even take our credit card to charge the order, and she said that they were waiting on just one dish- the Alfredo pasta, so we patiently waited.  Our food finally came out about 35-40 minutes after. We had asked for extra sauces such as Alfredo, Santa Fe, and ranch. She assured us that they were all in there and after waiting so long we believed that everything was in there like she said. We had also asked for the burger that we had ordered for the meat to be cooked well done, and unfortunately we got home and the burger was rare and very red. Also, no garlic aioli on the burger or even extra on the side like we had asked for.  So after a long night of waiting and a couple disappoints we thought we should let the manager know what happened. I called and asked to speak to the manager after we got home, and we were put on hold for about 10 minutes but we finally got to speak to the manager."
Lisa C.,"Fountain Valley, CA",2,24,1,1.0,7/30/2015,"We were greeted by both the employees at the hostess station, but after the initial ""hi"", they just stared at us.  So after a few awkward seconds, I told them the number in our party.  Maybe I'm wrong, but shouldn't they have asked us how many people we had in our group? After we were seated, not a single employee came by to take our drink order or ask us if we were ready to order.  By my calculation, we looked at the menus for 3 minutes, then waited another 5 minutes with the menus closed.  The hostess seated another table, other wait staff helped their tables, and we just sat there.  It was a weekday.  It wasn't busy.  There were empty tables in our area. So we got up and left."
Stephanie B.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,3,,5.0,2/27/2017,"Great burgers, drinks, atmosphere, service, people, and their bazooki is the absolute best!!!"
Tiffany A.,"Los Angeles, CA",2268,861,2329,5.0,6/23/2015,"Third times a charm? Great servers is one of the main reasons why I write reviews, (or horrible service lol)  I would of given this place less stars but lucky for this location they have people like, Steve.  I've been to this bj's a handful of times and the service was below par. If this guy sticks around I defiantly think I will be back for sure and tell my colleagues there's hope lol. He was very attentive and friendly. knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks, I wasn't sure about a beer and his recommendation was spot on. Thanks to Steve i feel I can come back again. I think he works weekends only not sure but I last went on a Saturday.  Why wouldn't I wanna go back to any bj's? Omg giant chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. Nomnomnom."
Peter L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",14,182,170,5.0,10/15/2015,This place is great I went here with my son and had such a great time. I would have to at the best afternoon with my son I've had in a while the staff was nice the apologized if there was a wait and the food is so good.
Phyllis M.,"Oxnard, CA",288,180,569,4.0,10/13/2014,"Good food. Good service. BJs has recently stepped it up with the variety of healthier & lighter dishes. But the predictable bar food is still available. I like that whenever I have come in, the food I love is still there, but they have introduced some other options to fulfill many other tastes.  The prices are reasonable, the food is good, desserts are good, many drink options & TVs to watch sports.  Been coming here for years!"
Debbi C.,"Venice, CA",1,9,,2.0,4/5/2016,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have eaten at BJ's twice before and was disappointed with both visits. It was my daughters Bday and she really wanted to go here for the pizzookies so I gave in and decided to try it for a third time.  Well you know what they say ""3 strikes and you're out"" I will not be returning to BJ's in a hurry.  The service was terrible. It took our server a full 10 minutes just to greet us. He took drink and app orders and never returned until we were done with those. We had to ask another server for share plates which took forever. I ordered a margarita but was very specific that I didn't want any sugar in my drink. It was was swimming in sugar. He told me that they didn't put any sweet and sour in it so I asked if the lime juice had sugar in it. His response "" I have no idea"". Seriously!! Menu knowledge is a key component to good training at any decent restaurant especially a chain like this. Instead of trying to fix my drink he just said ""ok I'll take it off the bill"" again, seriously!! Isn't it important to try and accommodate your guests? Come up with an alternative, not dealing with neuroscience here.  Okay, so now we ordered our main course, everything was cleared away (things were looking up). I do like a clean table. Food arrives and no one has cutlery. We ask someone to bring us knives and forks, waiting waiting waiting, food is getting colder by the second. Our server approaches, we ask him, his response ""oh yeah, how many of those do you need?"" Tiresome just writing this, not to be redundant but seriously?? There are 8 people at the table, how about you just bring 8 instead of us having to count it. Food still hasn't been touched.  Now onto the food. Average if that. The crispy chicken salad was comparable to McDonalds. The chicken was completely overlooked, the salad was soggy and tasteless. I would have sent it back but our server didn't check in again so we just ate it.  My daughter got a avocado, tomato, bacon grilled cheese. Bread was soggy, cheese wasn't melted, avocado barely noticeable. Just blah.  The only redeeming thing BJ's had for us was the pizzookies.  Next time we'll do dinner elsewhere and maybe, just maybe come here for dessert but that won't happen for a while, need to get rid of the very bad taste in my mouth."
Amy S.,"Simi Valley, CA",253,300,115,5.0,6/15/2013,"We have being coming to this BJs for many years and always enjoy the food. Service is usually pretty great and attentive; some late nights beg to differ, but we still enjoy ourselves. Top Faves: Small Bite: Gourmet Mac n Cheese BBQ Chicken Salad Any pizzas Oreo Pazookie Black Cherry soda It is a great place to stop in for a dessert date or drinks :)"
Elena V.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/31/2016,"If I could I wouldn't rate this specific BJ's with any stars. First off, when we arrived we were told to wait to be seated. Another couple came in and were seated right away, the host took notice of this and found a table for us right away. Secondly, we waited about 20-30 minutes to order our drinks and food. When we did receive our appetizers we were not given any utensils or napkins until after we were done with them. When we had our food delivered to us it was all screwed up. My burger was missing the lettuce, tomatoes and burger sauce, the others were missing ingredients as well. By the time they brought my ingredients my burger was cold. Finally, when we were ready to pay our waiter MORGAN took forever to get us out of there. We were there for a whole two hours and I would say we spent an hour and a half waiting and asking for stuff that was missing. I will not be returning to this restaurant and would much rather go to the place that hasn't disappointed us, Stonefire Grill."
Sandee R.,"Camarillo, CA",0,54,,2.0,8/12/2015,"I like the food.  The beer selection is fun and I like to experiment with different selections.  But our service on a weekday lunch was horrible.  It took 2 1/2 hours for a lunch that should have taken an hour or less.   Our waiter was amazing - he always approached our table S-L-O-W-L-Y,  but could disappear like Harry Potter with his Cloak of Invisibility.   We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated promptly.  Then we WAITED, then asked for a beer sample.  Then WAITED for them to be delivered.  Then WAITED for him to return.  Took our drink order, then sped off before we could order lunch.  Ordered our drinks, then WAITED for them to be delivered.  At least he took our lunch order then.  Then WAITED another 20 minutes for our pizza."
Collin C.,"Los Angeles, CA",149,221,103,3.0,10/10/2015,"It's BJ's, it has it's ceiling with quality. However, this was a really inviting BJ's.  They were very accommodating to us as we had our two pups, and allowed them on the inclosed patio, which is extremely spacious. I mean it's LARGE. There are plenty of tvs outside too, which is dope if you're trying to watch a game or two.  The menu is well designed for as ridiculously deep as it is. It is easy to read, bright, and engaging. I mean it really caught my attention haha. If you've been camping outdoors and are starving this place is great! I'm kidding, kind of. We had a great time hanging out, enjoying a beer and some food with super attentive service."
Bailee N.,"Oxnard, CA",0,1,,5.0,7/22/2016,derby Cobb was amazing yesterday and my server Christina was the greatest! Thank you BJ'S!
Kathy R.,"Palm Desert, CA",264,203,42,3.0,6/21/2015,We rarely go eat in the restaurant because it's usually pretty noisy unless we are eating later and most of Westlake Village shuts down by 9pm. Usually we pick up and bring food home from there. We are pretty selective about our choices and mostly order salad - we like the Santa Fe or Asian Chicken Salad.   Service is spotty and the food is not consistent when we dine in .  We do like their pizza and pizookie and tomato basil soup. Editing to add.....we ordered in again tonight and once again - we got home and the order was wrong.  They gave us a salad we ordered with the wrong fish on it.  I ordered two salads identical and we got two different versions of the same salad.  Food was good but I was annoyed.
Michael W.,"Oak Park, CA",0,7,,1.0,12/27/2016,There is something about this place and the employees feeling the need to be comedians. I don't mind you trying to be funny and failing horribly at it if you can at least provide good service. Save the comedy routine for after you've done an adequate job as a waiter.
Amber B.,"Newbury Park, CA",4,13,,5.0,7/15/2016,"I had lunch with my boyfriend a week ago on a Friday, busy lunch when there was a soccer semi final game! We have lunch here fairly often and this particular visit, we had the best service I think we have ever had here! Thanks to Bryan, our server. He was swamped...SO busy! I know how a lunch crowd can get, when it's full and they are in a hurry and want to get back to work and we could see him running around and how truly busy he was! Yet, we literally couldn't tell...every time he was at our table, he was completely cool and calm and attentive. Our food was fantastic, he took incredible care of us and even cracked a joke here and there. I even noticed how he communicated with other guests and his coworkers, he was wonderful! I think y'all are lucky to have someone like him work for you!"
Dolly T.,"Westlake Village, CA",6,35,,2.0,12/22/2016,"We decided to dine at BJ's this evening. The highlight of our evening, Alyce C and her beautiful smile, she gets the 2 stars for her patience and for doing her best to work the bar area alone...  It quickly filled and with little help... (Where were the managers?) my beer sat on the bar and was warm when delivered, (where's the teamwork, oh wait, no one to help) , Elyse quickly replaced the beer... our food was warm at best.  When the check came, the check was not correct. I do not blame Elyse, she was working her butt off to try and keep service under control. She quickly made the check correct. There were no managers on the floor helping.   Eventually, before we left, a few more servers came in. I understand that so close the holidays, workers request off. (I spent 10 years in restaurant)  This is just another reason I feel strongly that management should be more hands-on when short staffed.  Elyse did all she could to keep the bar area flowing smoothly. She deserves an award for this..."
garry s.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",4,37,6,2.0,9/28/2015,The burgers were room temperature.  The napkin on my wife's lap got stuck to the gum on the bottom of the table.  This place has gone down hill.
Judi H.,"West Hills, CA",223,178,594,4.0,8/31/2015,"Went to BJ's for lunch. We were a group of 10 with reservations. Got there at 11:45. We were quick to order and the service up to that point was decent. The service after that was horrible. I ordered the chicken mango salad which was delicious. Others ordered items which the restaurant screwed up on. Shrimp pasta with no shrimp. This does not include the lack of service we received after the food was corrected and brought out. It was bad, slow service in a restaurant which was no way at capacity for lunchtime. Went back to BJ's after the service we received which was slow and disappointing. Happy to report BH's did right and got our group out the door in a timely manner. Food was good as always but now the service was just as pleasing. Will look forward to many more lunches and celebrations there"
Diana R.,"Camarillo, CA",43,35,229,4.0,4/12/2016,Best gluten free pizza by far! Tried lots of other places but this one is closest to the real thing. Crust cooked perfectly; crunchy but not burnt. I usually get the ham and pineapple or pepperoni. Very tasty! Sauce to cheese ratio is very balanced.
