Christianna O.,"Camarillo, CA",2,14,8,1.0,3/8/2015,"I love the old snakebite (blonde and berry burst) and their beet salad. Having said that  what I don't love is my beer brought to me at room temperate because it has been sitting on the bar 10 steps away from my table waiting to be delivered for (yes I timed it) 8 minutes,soggy and browned avocado egg rolls, an extremely well done burger when I asked for it medium, my son having to ask twice if he may please have a raspberry tea, and to top it off a honey mustard dipping sauce that might as well been yellow mayo.  BJs you have officially lost a pretty loyal customer. The beet salad was amazing as usual but it doesn't even come Close to making up for the rest. Oh and yes I did mention all of the problems to my waitress who was not at all concerned with my dissatisfaction."
Michael M S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,48,1,1.0,4/25/2016,"After 45 minutes, my server forgot to enter my order. But, hey, his ""I'm sorry"" was pleasant."
Harold B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",19,14,5,5.0,1/27/2016,I went hear on a midweek night and service was great as our server Joey was prompt and extremely willing to help. A must if you want amazing food and great drinks overall great experience I will be coming back.
Divine L.,"Palmdale, CA",0,16,3,1.0,9/24/2016,Pablo was the most awful waiter in the world. So rude and called his dumb ass shitty manager for everything. Do not go to this dirty ass restaurant I will be calling corporate!
Brenda S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,39,4,3.0,5/21/2016,"Friday night around 7:30pm my family and I had dinner at Bjs. Husband had spaghetti and meatballs and my son had the pepperoni pizza. Daniel was a very attentive server, eventhough the restaurant was packed. I ate the new chicken cobb salad with homemade avocado dressing. It tasted fine but I became sick 5 hours later. I went to bed at midnight and woke up at 1:00am with pain and bloating in my midsection. I went to the bathroom and had very loose stools. This continued for 3 hours. I will not eat a chicken cobb salad at Bjs ever again! Stick to the thoroughly cooked items."
Chris T.,"Castaic, CA",66,50,2,2.0,11/14/2016,"The service was better than the food I got the ahi tuna salad, yeah he did not taste fresh and the salad was so so. They didn't have any specials the regular menu is very pricey."
Daryl L.,"Los Angeles, CA",51,63,70,3.0,6/26/2015,"After my last review,  the manager contacted me to apologize and offered me to come back to try again.  I appreciate that and thank her for the reach out.  I was seated right away this time and the server came around with no real delays. I ordered the steak with a wedge salad and Brussel sprouts for the sides.  Salad was dropped off and they asked if I needed anything. ... I said I would like the pepper grinder if they have one.  He said he would look and get back.  Never got back.  Found my server and asked him.  By that time,  they were bringing my steak.  I asked to hold the steak since I haven't started my salad yet.  Finished my salad and the steak was brought out.  Steak was cooked fine.  The Brussel sprouts had sadly been overcooked while waiting.  Overall,  not a bad experience,  much better than last time. Would I come back?  Yes."
Cristian L.,"San Francisco, CA",177,15,22,2.0,2/20/2015,"Wow.  The service here was friendly, but sadly it was eclipsed by the rate at which it was delivered. I'm surprised at how this restaurant can serve its customers to effect if the servers have all disappeared. Oddly enough, there are servers abound, but just not the one that is serving our table. I cannot for the life of me figure it out - I just wanted to pay..."
Meagan F.,"Simi Valley, CA",76,23,9,5.0,6/20/2015,Best clam chowder I've ever had! Neptune's in Malibu and Andrea's in Ventura got nothin on this. Very surprised for not even being on the beach.
Kevin U.,"Simi Valley, CA",4,83,10,2.0,3/11/2016,"Bad service, our server was not the greatest, food wasn't that great either my wife had order a chicken plate with a side of broccoli and they gave her 4 pieces of broccoli and it was over cooked and parts of it were burnt we mention it to the server and he said do you want more broccoli, not even an apology disappointed with bjs brewery service and food not so great like it used to be!"
David Z.,"Chico, CA",54,41,11,4.0,5/6/2016,"Came in with 24 family members. Took a little while to be seated, but the service was great and the pizza was super tasty!"
Kelly P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",40,14,,5.0,5/2/2016,"Went on Friday and our waitress was Melissa K. Food was excellent, burgers cooked perfectly, and service was prompt and friendly. Will be back!"
Olivia R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,9,2,1.0,10/28/2016,"We use to go all the time with my family and friends probably every weekend, but the service and food has progressively gotten worse. My family brought me home an Asian salad today completely different from what I normally receive with like four pieces of lettuce and no dressing....."
Emily K.,"Westlake Village, CA",1,5,,2.0,6/9/2016,"My girlfriend and I come here quite often for a quick bite to eat, especially when we are having a case of pazooki cravings. We have had a fair share of pretty bad experiences here such as being greeted after 20 minutes of sitting at our table, staff being just plain rude, having to actually get up from the table and search for assistance, sending back my food 4 times because the waiter just couldn't get my modifications right, and plenty of other little frustrations. Being a waitress myself, I'm very understanding of mistakes but I feel like the problems we have had here are repetitive and do to pure carelessness. The staff here has to deal with a lot of teens who don't tip them because of its location (in between two highschools) so I think they just assume any younger person is the same and they won't put the proper effort into the table but I'm 20 years old and do not like to be treated less then because you don't think I will tip you (as I tip AT LEAST 20% no matter what, it's the right thing to do) I know that it's a huge restaurant so I give them props, but I just wish that I felt more taken care of and attended to when I come here.  BUT now whenever we go we call ahead to see if Bree is there, this review would be a definite 5 stars if it were based just on her. She's an amazing waitress and always puts 100% into her tables regardless, ask for her!"
Regan R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",57,23,4,5.0,6/17/2015,"Hadn't been here in about 4 yrs cause the pizza was kinda crapy every time we went there and they don't brew beer on site. Visited there today to get a cheese pizza and some brews and it was perfect! I worked there back in 2004 and ate there every shift. Food was yummy and the staff was upbeat. Later, when I moved on and changed jobs, my friends and I would go there and the food and atmosphere kinda went south for a while, so I hadn't been back. But I'm happy to know the food and service is better!  FYI They don't have a hostess between lunch and dinner cause it's slow and there's no need, so you have to seat yourself at the bar- this pretty much goes for most restaurants.  From what I remember when I was a hostess- it tends to be bananatown mainly during basketball games (cause of that big screen tv...oh and booze) so if you hate people and want a quiet dinner, don't go on a big sports night. Some hardcore sports fans can tie up the seating for hours, so you have to expect to wait a little longer for dining.  When I think Bjs, I don't think it'll be equivalent to Mastros, where they give you the birthplace, family history, and the life hood of the meat you're about to eat- I expect pizza-and-beer and maybe a pizookie full of regrets ;) After tonight I know we'll be back. Food was great and what we expected. Our server in the bar seating, Steven, was very attentive and hospitable."
Elizabeth D.,"Westlake Village, CA",46,24,10,1.0,2/23/2016,"BJs used to be a favorite spot, but we hadn't gone in about a year.  Stopped in today for what ended up to be a kale/ Brussel sprout salad that was drenched in dressing and the brussel sprouts were clearly from a can.  Gross.  Ordered a Steak to go- got home to find the smallest steak ever- the size of tenderloin, but regular steak.  No interested in returning."
Sabrina P.,"Westlake Village, CA",400,4,,4.0,5/31/2016,"Ive been to BJ's probably 250 times and the service isn't the best. BUT whenever I have Bree as a server my experience is always 100 times better. She is fast, caring, funny, and just amazing! She makes my dining experience so much more enjoyable! Thank you Bree!! Oh yeah and the pizookies are always amazing too :)"
Celeste A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",20,79,21,3.0,1/5/2015,"Like the Buffalo Pizza, also the honey Dijon chicken sandwich which I believe is no longer on their menu. The last 3 times that I went to BJ's they no longer had it on the menu.  I think what stopped me from going back was the last time I went service was really bad and the pasta I ordered had no flavor what so ever.  I think next time I am there it will be for drinks and appetizers."
Sarah T.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",175,112,103,5.0,1/12/2016,"Its BJ's, what more can you say? Always top notch service, mouth watering food, deliciously strong drinks, great atmosphere, and the best time! I am on a quest to try everything on their menu (this has been over several years) and I have yet to try something I do not like! I also enjoy getting their beer flights and having their beer. My favorite is the pirahna! Out of all the appetizers my favorite are the avocado rolls. Always crunchy and delicious! This BJ's is my favorite that I have been too. I know I will be back again soon."
Jay T.,"Irvine, CA",132,382,56,2.0,11/25/2013,"It's BJ's, so you basically know what you're getting. But we had just about the worst service I've ever had at a BJ's. Saturday night, the place was actually not that crowded. We were seated pretty quickly. Most of us were having water, which apparently the waitress didn't approve of, because she would only refill it after we'd ask at least three times. Also, they didn't bring us red pepper and parmesan with our pizza. So I asked. Several times. They finally brought it after we were done eating."
