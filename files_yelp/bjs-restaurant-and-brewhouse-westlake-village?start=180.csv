Michelle O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",248,787,345,4.0,10/23/2011,"I have never had a bad meal here, always busy no matter how many new businesses around the area show up. This place is big, indoor and outdoor seating. Menu is extensive and so are the drinks. - warning this place can get busy so you might have a wait at dinner time, especially on the weekends.  Recently I had the Pumpkin Ale, not bad, had a bit of a bite, I like some of the others on tap better. But if you like a lighter beer then you might like this one.  Been here so many times- just for dessert, dinner, lunch, catering etc. Love it all.   Just to name a few of my favs: - Spinach and artichoke dip - BBQ chicken salad- get the half size if possible at lunch and ask for extra bbq sauce - New Orleans Jumbalaya: blackened chicken, shrimp and Chicken- Andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce.`Served over rice pilaf and topped with green onions. 13.95- great flavors! - Ahi poke: but the wontons could be crispier and thicker - Thai chickent lettuce wraps- great bite! Whether you come to enjoy a bite and watch the game or celebrate something special, guaranteed everyone will find something they like."
Jeff B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,11,,1.0,2/3/2016,"Service??? WHAT SERVICE? Yes, we are early birds and arrived ~5:10pm.  The receptionist was engaged with a couple with a young child and needed a highchair - - the receptionist made a major project of the request.  Once that was over, I ask for two and a table please and it went down hill from there. Mind you, the restaurant was only 1/3 full with lots of empty booths and tables, but she says do you mind waiting 20 minutes as the server will arrive at 5:30 and this area isn't being seated.  Wife got indignant, but I just said, Get up, we're leaving - - I vote with my pocket book, which the couple behind me overheard. Went to Outback and had a great steak."
Yevgeniy P.,"Newbury Park, CA",92,17,1,1.0,11/6/2014,"I've been here a few times before not my favorite particularly because for the quality and variety of the menu you can find cheaper in the area. Came here on a Thursday the place was quasi busy the server was taking her time checking in on a table of 7. Stayed cool didn't judge and stayed positive.  Ordered a burger, added bacon and requested two sides of chipotle mayo. When the food came the burger had no bacon and there were no sides of chipotle mayo brought out. Asked the food runner for the dressing by the time they showed almost 10 mins later the fries were cold.  It has been over 15 minutes and I'm still waiting for the server to show so I can order another beer. By the sounds of at least two tables around us are having the same issue with an absentee server. Not likely coming back, even if it is for a friends birthday. Update the server casually put a table of 7-10 al on one check without asking. Even though she was told that people were arriving and leaving at different times. This visit just keeps getting worse. In order to split a check the table can't order anything else..."
Daniel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,104,23,1.0,8/11/2016,"I was here yesterday getting food with a friend of mine who I haven't seen for a while so I decided to come here to eat.  The food was ok.  The service was great.  But, the biggest fail for this restaurant is the restroom cleanliness.  There were paper napkins everywhere and water all over the floor.  Literally looked like little kids have been peeing everywhere all over the floor.  While I was in the bathroom I almost fell and hurt myself because of all the water on the floor.  I then talked to the current manager at the time and she told me sorry and we will get right on it.  I had trouble believing her and feel as if she just brushed it off her shoulder like it wasn't top priority.  For this reason, I felt the need to write this review with my experience on 8-11-16.  And, I am hoping they keep the bathrooms more well maintained from now on or they will have a problem."
Samantha F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",68,8,,4.0,3/8/2016,Marco was such a great server! Some of the best service I've had in the area. He greeted us and got drinks in promptly. He made some good beer suggestions to find the right IPA to drink. He continually checked back through out the meal to make sure we had everything we needed and were doing well. The potstickers are really yummy and you can't beat the pizookies! Love that they donate a portion of the pizookie sales to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
Sassy R.,"Canoga Park, CA",320,42,72,3.0,2/16/2015,"It was okay. I ordered the carne asada fries and they were not over the top. Also had a side salad with watermelons and those were okay too. One thing i liked though was their pizookie, loved the cookie, the texture was great, the sides were chewy and the middle part was fantastic :)"
Lesley Y.,"Bellevue, WA",1,17,1,1.0,12/27/2015,"Very disappointing. Service was friendly but extremely slow. Took an hour to get our food, which was only marginal. We're gluten free and were looking forward to their GF menu but very little thought has been put into accommodating GF requests. Many items could have been modified to be GF but staff & kitchen are not trained on how to do this. Food we did have was boring. Will not go back."
Dustin L.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,20,5,2.0,11/22/2015,I use to love this restaurant but it would seem the service has gone down hill. We waited 45 minutes for our food only to discover there was an issue with something we ordered. We weren't told about the issue. The pasta we ordered (chicken alfredo) was not good to say the least. It was very watery and the chicken tasted fake. The only reason I give two stars and not zero was the alcohol we ordered. The Long Island was strong and it's just the way I like it.
Ben F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",379,239,137,5.0,1/5/2015,"I love this place. Their lunch specials are amazing! Plus 3.50$ beers lunch special, with great food items under 9 bucks which actually fills you up. Can't beat that. Huge selection of beer, even bigger selection of food, sandwhiches, pizzas are great, you really can't go wrong at BJs."
M G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,5,,2.0,10/2/2016,The service here is pretty terrible. I've given this place three shots to step up their game and they've consistently delivered mediocrity. They don't seem to staff enough people for days that are busy such as a Saturday night. I and a friend were seated and we were waiting for three more. We had wanted to order drinks but weren't approached for at least 15 minutes. Then the waiter forgot a drink. Food is decent but nothing I'd suffer through the service again for.
Tony F.,"Oak Park, CA",76,60,26,5.0,2/24/2015,"Usually BJ's service sucks, but I was blown away tonight. I came here with 4 friends on a Monday evening as no other place was open. We were seated at around 11 pm. Usually when they see 5 teenage guys, restaurants don't care a lot as they don't expect a tip. It was a pleasant surprise when our waitress Michelle actually gave us outstanding service! We ordered about 7 things off of the happy hour menu, and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, which is usually rare for BJ's. Overall, the food was great and the service was outstanding, big thanks to Michelle!! 5 stars, a milestone for BJ's, Thousand Oaks."
Jenn T.,"Moorpark, CA",469,599,165,3.0,9/19/2014,"I like the ambiance of this restaurant, but the service and the wait can take a while. The drinks here are good and the food is pretty good, but not if I have to wait an hour for everything. Plus, the parking in this area sucks. If it was just for the food, I'd come back but I like having a nice experience while I dine out."
Kelsey B.,"Portland, OR",47,30,2,1.0,8/19/2014,"BJ's in Westlake Village is like the terrible friend who doesn't listen to you that you keep going back to in hopes that your relationship will change.  I primarily order through LABite and there is always SOMETHING wrong with my food. When I order fettuccine alfredo, even if I specify my desire for pasta without chicken, it's like they flip a coin to decide whether or not they're going to throw some chicken on top. On top of that, the fettuccine alfredo always has random bits of other food mixed in it (little black things, broccoli, and other unidentifiable crumbs), which really leads me to question how clean their kitchen is. I must be a masochist, because until tonight I've continued to order food from this BJ's location 1-2 times a week and it's almost always either terrible or flat out wrong. On a typical night, they overcook the mozzarella sticks to the point that there's dried cheese on the outside and the sticks themselves are hollow. You asked for your fish with light batter? Surely you must mean extra batter, so that's what we're going to give you. I think the most mind boggling mistake is the fact that I've ordered a Triple Chocolate Pizookie several times, and instead of giving me the double chocolate ice cream it's supposed to come with, they keep giving me vanilla. Even when I add 'double chocolate ice cream' to the special instructions, they STILL give me vanilla. If I wanted vanilla ice cream, I would have asked for it. Oh, and the cookie itself is always burned. How challenging is it to NOT burn a cookie? Eating at the restaurant itself is no better. The waiters are rude and have a bad habit of never refilling drinks or asking if you need anything. On top of that, they'll leave you waiting for your meal for 30 minutes on a slow day and the food is no better when it's fresh. Eating at BJ's is like playing Russian Roulette, except with food quality. Save yourself the frustration and eat somewhere else. Obligatory 'if I could give them no stars, I would'."
Mary S.,"Dubuque, IA",2,83,43,5.0,1/16/2016,Had the Smokey Pig Pizza and wow! The crust was crispy and the tomatoes were perfectly cooked on top. The first bite was a piece of heaven. This truly satisfied my cravings for something savory. The service was great and the noise level wasn't overwhelming. Definitely a great place for late night snacks or meals on a Saturday night.
Jeff O.,"Auburn, CA",11,31,2,1.0,11/16/2015,At least they are consistent. Finally broke down and went to BJ's for lunch after staying away for a year. Ordered a beer and a bowl of chili and they came out at the same temperature and then was told that the chili was cold because the kitchen put cheese & sour cream on it. What in heavens name was I thinking?
Matt B.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,23,48,3.0,9/25/2014,"bJs does not stand for blow jays. Despite that, it's a decent option. There's something for everyone on the menu. I always liked their Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The best part is, however, it's open LATE on Sundays! When you have no choice, BJ's stands as a glowing beacon of Pizookie. Speaking of, expect some high pressure from your teenage waiter to order Pizookie... whatever the F that is?"
Ryan M.,"Simi Valley, CA",190,9,2,5.0,2/21/2016,I haven't been to BJ's forever and I was a little hesitant coming tonight because I didn't think they had anything I could eat (on a diet). Well I was wrong! The Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken was delicious and low on the calories. I also sampled the chicken tortilla and that was yummy too. Way to step up your game on the cleaner eating BJ's. Wendy was a great server too. She was fantastic with our large group and all the wild kids
A R.,"Oxnard, CA",14,20,28,5.0,2/1/2016,"I just love this BJ's. Employees that work when I come in all know me well. Everyone is friendly, my order is always right and what's more is even the managers are extremely friendly. They speak to everyone, make sure everything is up to par. I have no complaints about this BJ's and I will continue to enjoy my favorites here!"
Audra D.,"Seattle, WA",94,204,184,4.0,7/29/2014,"Stopped in for dinner,  seated quickly and kindly. Our server was nice. The food isn't anything special in my opinion.  It is typical Chili's/Applebee's type food. Maybe the beer is good (not a beer girl) the drinks are good.  Decent prices tho & portion sizes are enough to take home for the next day. Would recommend them for a simple meal anytime."
Nicole B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",133,191,84,3.0,11/12/2013,"As expected on a Friday night, this location was very busy. The parking lot was full and there was a wait for a table. There was a wait of about 20 minutes for a four-top table. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. We were seated outdoors and there were heaters, which was very nice because I did not bring a jacket. We were greeted immediately and our drink orders were taken. I got a four beer sampler. I chose the lightest four and they were quite good. My friends had whiskey neat and diet coke and rum. They were all pleased and said they were on the stronger side (good thing). They have quite a large, and overwhelming, menu. I ordered the bison burger from the healthy options sections. However, about 10 minutes after ordering I was informed that they were all out of bison. I was very disappointed. I therefore settled for the veggie burger. It was okay. My friends were satisfied with their choices. Overall, the food was good and the service was great."
