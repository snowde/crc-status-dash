David P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/24/2014,"First off its Christmas eve so we were just grateful/thankful they were open because nowhere else was. They told us to choose a seat. Nobody came to us, we had to get menus ourself. Broken down: *Service when we finally got it: Not bad/ok *calamari appetizer: terrible, like chewing over cooked balloon knots. Expensive and you only get a few pieces. I had Jambalaya: Pretty good Fiance had pasta: she says it was good... I didn't say anything about anything because again it was Christmas eve and I'm sure they wanted to be home. It's all good. May return but not for the calamari."
Maya V.,"El Cajon, CA",4,16,4,5.0,8/21/2015,The food was amazing. We got Alfredo with chicken. Our waiter James was amazing. The experience would not be the same with out him. All though the food was great the service is what will bring me back. We got a pizookie which was also fantastic. So glad we chose bjs
Frank S.,"Ventura, CA",0,20,8,1.0,6/3/2015,"Birthday party !  about 14 guests, four of us ordered pizza it arrived cold, had to send it back, our salads didn't  arrived until we were almost done with the reheated pizza. Could have had a second drink but were never asked,  even had difficulties getting water . Not the waiters fault, my suggestion when you have a big party put at least two people to take and fill orders, One waiter and he also had more tables to serve...Bad, bad service.."
Mary K.,"Westlake Village, CA",17,68,341,2.0,6/19/2014,"Came in for a late lunch Tuesday afternoon and the service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out and neither the hostess nor the waiter had brought out table set ups. I had to get up and get my own. When I asked our waiter about the status of the appetizer (twice) I was told ""we're backed up right now."" As a customer, I could care less, not my problem. Offer an apology, bring drink refills, anything to smooth it over. We didn't even get the bread we asked for until our meal was finished. The entrees came out 15 minutes after the appetizer. The salad we asked for dressing on the side had dressing on it. The sandwich we ordered without avocado included it. I don't care how busy the kitchen is, the orders should be prepared properly. And the waitstaff should be prepared to have a positive, attentive attitude. Until service improves, we won't be back."
N. N.,"Santa Maria, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/23/2016,Never had a problem with bj's pizza but last friday a little under cooked. the manager said to give him 8 minutes and he had a new pizza cooked to perfection. thanks
Mallory Y.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",9,28,,4.0,8/8/2015,I like this place a lot. The pizza is so good. I've never had anything else. The only thing is that the changing table is so slanted. I was changing my son and I felt like he could slide off at any time. It would be nice if they replaced this one. I had the peach raspberry (I think) tea and it was a bit too sweet for my taste but was good. I also ordered steamed veggies for my son and it was a good selection for him so that was nice.
Sascha C.,"Simi Valley, CA",90,35,3,2.0,6/29/2014,"So... I have to start with the positive, which was our waiter. Poor guy was alone dealing with our huge crowd of 15+ adults and 5 kids. He actually gets the two stars cause the food was certainly not worth much.  Never have I experienced more mediocre food. I still have a deep fry taste in my mouth here 5 hours after I ate. The sliders were boooooooooring (you would at least expect some onions or something, but no, just a bun, ketchup and a tiiiiny patty barely big enough to fill out that bun) and my sandwich was not much to write home about either. I had the parmesan crusted chicken sandwich with garlic mayo, but I honestly couldn't taste that garlic. I did taste one of my cousin's wedge seasoned fries and that was good. So I guess I should've just gotten that... I don't necessarily have to go back again."
Nick O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",511,234,115,3.0,12/31/2013,"BJ's Thousand Oaks location is right off the 101 Freeway and a great location for a wide variety of food and beers to suit everyone. Its a brew house but kids are welcome and its a great place to also catch a game on TV.  The Pizza's are great, I had the fish and chips, loads of salad choices, burgers, and deserts.  The parking is easy too, and not too often so busy that you cant get a space. There are mixed reviews here, we came on Christmas Eve for a late lunch with the kids.  The service we had was great, food was good (for a chain) and no complaints?  It is certainly worthy of three stars for the service we had, the food as I said is nothing super special but our kids loved it and that's often what counts!"
A. H.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,98,5,1.0,7/3/2015,15 minutes to wait to be seated. 39 minutes to get our food. Food was not good and cold. One order was incorrect twice! The waiter was slow and could not refill a drink in 40 minutes. Needless to say I will not be back.
Luke K.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,5.0,6/11/2016,"Fantastic service, I'm writing this review as we're walking out the door because I have never experienced more thoughtful and friendly staff at any restaurant I've ever been to.  There was a slight mess up involving our dinner order and the staff more than took care of everything without us even having to ask.  Special thanks to our server Michael S. And the manager Brandy for making this dinner date incredible."
Anil T.,"Secaucus, NJ",14,12,,5.0,8/10/2015,"Me and my wife always come here. Service and food both are excellent, The entire chain is always excellent."
Andy S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",61,15,1,5.0,8/10/2014,"Let me begin by saying how much this place rocked! I had my 30th Birthday party at the Westlake Village Bj's and I had a fantastic time. We we're a very large group of 25 guests and they were able to more than comfortably accommodate us. With such a large group, they gave us two dedicated waitresses who were so awesome. They were so polite and fast and never made us wait for service.  The food was fantastic. The menu has so many options for everyone and it was delicious. The pizza was so yummy. The staff surprised me with a birthday pazookie and it was delicious. Everyone in the group had an amazing and fun time. I couldn't have asked for more. I would definitely recommend the Westlake Village Bj's to anyone for a meal or a special event!"
Ray M.,"Simi Valley, CA",156,22,23,1.0,1/2/2016,"My third time here at this location and I don't think they'll ever change. My waiter was not friendly and the wait was extremely long to get our food.... I had time enough to be able to write this review yay! We ordered some beer and the calamari to start, 30 minutes later we are still waiting on that calamari. So the food, we are eating our main entrees and she got the Mahi Mahi and shrimp which was very good. I got the deep dish ravioli and it was just okay. Truthfully I want really expecting much so I wasn't really disappointed. The whole experience wasn't so bad but not good either. I just hate waiting long for my food and getting terrible customer service. Hey waiters at BJ's, I can tell you don't like your job. Do yourself a favor and look for another one in a cubicle then. Don't let the customers that pay good money suffer because your heart isn't in what you do to earn a living. P.S. Our meal is over and we never got our calamari. Last time I'll ever come here, I'd rather spend my earnings somewhere where they'll appreciate my business."
Dane H.,"Newbury Park, CA",283,21,1,3.0,9/13/2015,"I'm giving these guys 3 stars be cause this was my first visit and only visit to a BJ's so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  The steak I ordered was ruined twice, and the manager felt awful and admitted that they had ""missed by a mile and weren't even close"".  I could tell he was sincere and they had really tried.  That said, the service was good but my food was certainly not.  They seemed to do better with other orders, so if you go, I would avoid the steak."
Gwendolyn B.,"Camarillo, CA",0,5,,1.0,3/4/2016,The food was terrible !! I'm hungry and I spent 50 bucks Food quality was bad and at that there was not much of it had the Brussel sprout appetizer and the Brussel sprouts were not cooked right. Would not recommend
Kym C.,"Westlake Village, CA",29,25,,5.0,7/7/2015,"Always a great time at BJs in Thousand Oaks!  We go there all the time but this time there was a group of us that went after an evening tennis match. I was a little concerned that the employees might get frustrated since it was a little late when we arrived. But nope not the case. The service was awesome, the food great, beer nice and cold!! The manager Steven came over to check on us. We all chatted about our tennis match, the beer, great service and of course the yummy pizookies we had! So nice to have such personal service. Great time was had by all! We will be back!"
Cari R.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/4/2016,We just left from BJ's in Westlake and I have to say our server Ray D was the worst server ever! Very rude!! And very disappointed with the poor service we recieved!! I will never be going there again!! We had 2 friends arrive after we had been there for a while and they were never even asked if the wanted to order anything! What's up with that! If that's how you treat people on the regular maybe you shouldn't be working there!
Tegan M.,"Westlake Village, CA",107,4,,5.0,5/9/2016,"Takeout at Bj's is always quick and perfect. Julian is friendly and professional, taking orders and preparing them so quickly and efficiently. I'd definitely order takeout again, thanks to him :)"
Barry K.,"Agoura Hills, CA",28,206,3,4.0,5/19/2015,"Been here many times but never wrote a review. Tonight ordered clam chowder,  sliders, and artichoke appetizer.  All were very good and service was excellent. Never had an issue here. They do a good job."
Jennifer C.,"Norwalk, CA",1,5,,1.0,4/16/2016,Service was terrible party of 10 people waited so long for our food was not asked once if we wanted refills or needed anything. After complaining we got our food except one person who waited 10 more min after everyone else got there food. Worst part was a wealthy looking family same amount of people who sat right in front of us were non stop being helped. Also when we complained our server was rude about it. I've been to bjs in other locations before but never coming back to this one again.
