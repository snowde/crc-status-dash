Ken S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",33,18,,2.0,11/9/2015,"We waited for a long time for just soup and salad I think this is Extremely slow service, very good food but very slow service"
Heather M.,"San Ardo, CA",65,15,4,2.0,6/15/2014,"Came here at 11 pm on a Saturday, food came out quickly but our server didn't come to check on is once after we got our food. We all had empty glasses and we're never offered a refill. We had to ask another server for the bill. When we were paying our server came and said he got busy which made us feel that we were not a priority because he checked on other tables around us but didn't bother to come to ours. Overall a bad experience with the server, good food though. We are from Valencia and have had bad experiences with the service there and it is disappointing that this was just as bad."
Rich K.,"Oxnard, CA",66,19,25,5.0,3/10/2014,"I love BJs, their food is great and their beer is phenomenal. My favorite store-bought beers are Sam Adams and Firestone's DBA, but BJ's Jeremiah Red is just in a different league.  The menu is vast enough to cover a variety of cravings, without being overwhelming. The bar staff is great though at times understaffed and service suffers.  The rewards program was a great addition and just another great reason that I'm addicted to this place."
Randy B.,"Westlake Village, CA",4983,2338,4473,4.0,10/5/2011,"Consistently good; great BIG menu & draft beers; what can be bad? This location is in Thousand Oaks, in a mini-mall area.  Sometimes parking can be tough just outside the place, but there is lots of parking surrounding it.  I've gone here plenty of times to eat by myself at the bar, small groups for lunch, and large groups for happy hours after work (shout out to Amgen!). As with all the BJ's, the pizza, brews, salads, and tons of other items, desserts (can you say pizzookie?)...it's all good stuff. Plus, lunch & happy hour, and late hour specials.  My favorite thing on the menu (for years now, and I never tire): the BBQ Chicken Chop...which I feel is the best I've ever had (sorry CPK).  Salads don't travel well, but everything else is served in HUGE capacity and get read for a 'take home' box. The service is good at this location, but it does get busy...and often requires a wait to be seated."
Trini B.,"San Jose, CA",87,280,461,3.0,3/31/2014,"I tried the Southern Fried Chicken. It was supposed to be a ""new"" item on the menu. It was really good. The waitress we had was really nice even after asking to split the check 5 ways! So sad they took away the Red Velvet Pizookie. We however had to squish 7 of us into a booth. Don't know if there was a communication error on our part or their's, but we managed. All in all, the food was good and decently priced."
Aren Y.,"Glendale, CA",57,48,,4.0,6/23/2015,Have been here for happy hour a few times after work. Good deals on beer and appetizers are priced well and taste much better than I expected.
B. Iris R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,23,,2.0,3/30/2016,"I'm taking back my prior review.   Last night we had the second worst dining experience of our lives at BJ's.   The service was dismal, we were totally ignored until we complained to the inhospitable manager, then of course he ignored us some more.   When one of the servers stepped in and tried to take our order he was seriously admonished because it wasn't his table.  Then we got no server at all!   We waited 45 mins. before we even got menus.  Had it not been that we had two hungry kids we would have walked out.   I would not go back there and intend to complain to their home office."
Debra F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/10/2015,"I ordered take out for the second time in two months and both times I was Highly DISAPPOINTED! When I arrived for pick up (told 15-20 mins) nothing was ready.  Not until that time was I told an item I ordered was not available, so the employee decided what I would want.  I continued to wait for 40 minutes and then was informed another item i ordered was replaced with what BJs thought was the next closest thing.  After speaking to a manager, I left only to get home and have one of my dinners not in the bag.  Food was poorly prepared and below average quality.  BJs has totally gone down!!!!"
Marla H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",177,49,16,1.0,11/29/2013,"Not a good night for dinner at BJ's.. Arrived at 7:15pm and didn't get our food until 8:54pm.  Settled the bill at 9:40pm.   Dinner salad arrived 8:40pm The Dr. Pepper was flat.  One of our family members was so hungry she asked for croutons and ranch dressing to hold her over until our food arrived. Ordered fettuccine Alfredo with no parsley. Of course, there was parsley : \ Son had to get his own Parmesan cheese and ketchup at the register :( Our glasses of water took a long time to get refilled and when he refilled it only went 1/2 way full because the carafe  was empty and he never came back to refill my glass of water so it was left half full! Oh the kicker...when I got the complimentary pazookie...the ice cream didn't melt because the cookie was cold. I ended up not eating it. Super disappointed. How can you ness up the one thing that's good?    I told our waiter, JP that I was going to complain to the manager because our food took so long to get here, he apologized and said the kitchen was backed up. He called over the manager, ""Teenie"" I explained everything that went on...to redeem  themselves we were comp'd 3 mini pazookie's and discount on the rest of the meal.  I'm not sure what the problem was, kitchen being backed up, JP needed help, maybe restaurant was under staffed? JP and Teenie were at least nice.  Unless someone else is paying for dinner and I had a few hours to waste at BJ's, this will not be a place I frequent or even recommend."
Dani S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,10,,5.0,5/2/2016,"I come into this location at least once a week, and never has the service been as good as it was today at lunch in the bar with our server Amanda. The 4 of us are all servers, and we have high expectations when it comes to good service. She was super attentive and always made sure our drinks were refilled. Great service shouldn't go unnoticed and I hope she is able to see this comment. The food was great also which was just a bonus!!"
Vivek P.,"Oak Park, CA",0,16,1,3.0,7/1/2015,"Average food. I had jambalaya which was good however my wife ate grilled salmon and the salmon was overcooked. The ambience was pretty nice and it was very family friendly. I think I had to wait a little longer for food than I expected, but it could be grumpy me today :)"
Blue R.,"Tucson, AZ",155,42,,4.0,1/20/2014,Love this place!   Love the ambience - the wait staff is pleasant/& knowledgeable. I've been for dinner - Good to know their hours for their lunch special pricing. Always down to save a nickel or two.
James R.,"North Hills, Los Angeles, CA",208,116,229,5.0,11/14/2013,"Checking them out ! This is my second visit and I am doing great ! This is another good one that yelpers should be visiting. Great service , people , food . Go get it !"
Paul D.,"Westlake Village, CA",742,114,181,2.0,10/1/2013,"This place had so much potential.   Food is okay...A little overpriced for me.  I hate ordering food at a restaurant and leaving hungry.  At the same time, I hate ordering a whole large pizza for myself and eating my way through guilt. Beer?  I don't really drink.  I'd rather have the cider.  The root beer itself got it above one star. This place absolutely blows since the service is TERRIBLE.  I understand that you have other tables.  You're a server.  You should be happy all your tables are filled and everyone is ordering something.  Bust your ass and do your job!  Who trains these ya-hoos?  Better yet, who do these self entitled servers have to stroke to get their jobs?  He should probably take some time investing in TRAINING. EVERY freaking time I come in here for some mandatory event, I always say to myself, ""Hey, I'll give them a chance again.  It's been six months, I've complained to their corporate, I don't see the manager that I almost had to get into a fist fight with to get a pizza in less than two hours and there's no wait.""   NO!  BJ's HAS TO LIVE UP TO ITS REPUTATION IN WESTLAKE AND BOTCH EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! HOW IS MY PIZZOOKIE STILL RAW?! I seriously can't step into this place any more without EXPECTING something to get screwed up..."
Dan F.,"Agoura Hills, CA",26,12,,4.0,8/2/2015,The BBQ Chix salad came with a 'little' too much dressing & they were kind enough to comp it because of that. The fish & chips was ok and they ran out of the tartar sauce but service was more than acceptable.
Patrick N.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,433,533,2.0,8/6/2011,"This time I ordered from the ""Small Bites"" section of the menu. I got the Mac and Cheese for just $4. I was so eager to try it because it sounded so good. It has a blend of three cheeses, bacon throughout, a bacon and breadcrumb topping, and even chipotle seasoning. It sounded so good, so flavorful, I couldn't wait.  When I came I thought it was definitely a good lunch or snack size, and is served with two garlic parmesan crostini's.  I finally took my first bite. What a let down! It was completely flavorless! I could taste only plain pasta. The cheese sauce with chipotle and bacon had no flavor whatsoever. I couldn't believe it. At least it was only $4.  I might try to make this at home because the blend of ingredients sounds brilliant.  If you go to BJ's, stick to the pizza. I know I will."
Prapa C.,"Encino, CA",42,25,265,1.0,1/31/2014,I came back here again with my friends . The guy at the bar (fat guy) always bad to us . Took a wrong order and never ask us after he dumped food . His Co worker was nice . He took care us after his friend ruined everything . And one more thing that fat guy shouldn't ask us where we come from ...so if we were born here u gonna give us a good service
Tiffany A.,"Aptos, CA",111,15,3,3.0,3/20/2015,"Good food, good device, great dessert, a bit pricey for the portion  though, I dropped 30 bucks on my date and I, was still hungry, so a bj was needed at bj,s"
Brad F.,"Simi Valley, CA",28,105,21,5.0,1/29/2014,One of the best places for a nice dinner or just a drink after work. This place has it all.  You have got to try my favorite beer!!! It's not on the menu but it's called the weisphaner hefieisen dunkle. Don't quote me on the spelling. Usually if you just say the dunkle they know. But if not if your facing the bar the taps on the right side of the bar it's the fourth one from the left and it says worlds oldest beer on the tap or something like that.  Bar tenders are always super friendly and up for a conversation if you want one or will just leave you be to watch the huge tv if that's more your thing.
Sammy T.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,6,1,5.0,4/9/2016,"This has to be my favorite restaurant in town. I've lived in Thousand Oaks for over 20 years and I find myself eating here at LEAST once a week. I've had pretty much everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed. All the food is great, but it's definitely the in-house craft beer they serve that keeps me coming back. If you've never had a Jaramiah Red, go there now! And save some room for a Pazookie!"
