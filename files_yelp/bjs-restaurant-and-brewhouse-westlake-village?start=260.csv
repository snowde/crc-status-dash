Nataly J.,"Gardena, CA",0,7,,1.0,8/22/2014,"Came with a group of 20 had reservations 2 weeks in advance for a friends birthday.  Upon arrival server was very rude and had a very condescending tone( as if we were hard of hearing and needed to be babied and walked through), as the birthday girl was moving around to speak with all the guests... She was a saying ""DO NOT MOVE YOUR SEATS AROUND"" blah blah, but overall just rude and annoyed tone( no one else was moving seats). Server did well for bringing food and refills (1 star, but attitude brought back down) understandable larger groups are hard but EVERYONE knew what they wanted and orders went smooth. It took over an 1 1/2hrs to get food and EVERYTHING came out COLD as if it had been sitting out for ever. And when splitting the checks things were wrong and someone  some how ended up paying quite a bit of extra. But at that point everyone was so fed up we just left after paying before asking her to fix the bill once AGAIN.  Through out the entire dining experience the server's attitude did not improve and the party being a handful of people whom work in restaurants know it's not appropriate to act with guests even on an off day. Definitely will be calling back to speak to a manger after an unsatisfactory visit. Very disappointing."
Ann H.,"Berkeley, CA",53,46,7,2.0,5/11/2014,The food was great. The only problem is that the floor was so slippery and dirty. The restrooms were unclean as well. We did not like the smell as well. Bad expiring.
Robert B.,"Westlake Village, CA",33,27,167,1.0,8/4/2013,"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. Every time I come here I have the worst service. I come about once every eight months thinking oh the service should be fixed by now. But every time its the same. They have good food but you have to put up with the service. The last (and final) time I was there we had to get a manager, again, because the food was taking forever. He blamed the server when we knew it was the kitchen. Very unprofessional.  Do yourself a favor and stay away."
Stephanie M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",45,36,24,1.0,1/24/2015,"Service occasionally has been better but then I remember why I don't come here much anymore. I come here a lot less often, only when I get off work late and nothing else is open. We will have good service (good for BJs) a couple times and then we will have a visit that reminds us why BJs is a no go. Came on Wednesday night. Arrived at 10:58. Sat down immediately at a booth in the bar. Approximately 8 minutes later, a server walked by and said he'd be right with us. We should have already had drinks by the 3 minute mark, or less. I work at a nice restaurant in the area and I know good service time standards. A couple minutes later, menus arrive and he takes our drink order (about 11:11). We didn't actually have water in front of us until 11:20. Over 20 minutes after arriving. That's ridiculous. Then he took our food order. It arrived at 11:45. 25 minutes for an order of happy hour sliders and a mini pizza. By that time we just wanted to leave and go to sleep. So the fires on the sliders were completely cold, I asked for new ones. New fries came out 8 minutes later that were also cold. I didn't eat any of them. The lettuce was completely brown and wilted on the slider plate. It's sad that they let themselves fall to these standards, they could be a good place. It wasn't the servers fault, his section was way too big for how busy it was in the bar. Managers need to get a hint here."
Jill D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",49,18,,5.0,10/26/2014,Pablo is a great server! He attended to us regularly and was extremely friendly. We had a sausage/meatball confusion and he handled it super well and offered my boyfriend and I a free pizooki! All the food was delicious. :)
Jeremy F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,2.0,8/16/2013,"BJ's has always been a good spot to stop by and catch a game. Any they are open late which is always a plus in this area. Not happy though after yesterday's experience. We were seated in booth adjacent to the bar for an early dinner. I saw the big sign with the 'Happy Hour' specials plastered all over it. Mmm, beer and some avocado egg rolls sound good, let's start with those. Got the bill and was charged full price, asked the waitress and she said the happy hour is for the bar area only.Got one of those apathetic apologies from here. Great, another one of THOSE places. After we were done, I took a closer look at the sign, and in SUPER fine print on the bottom buried in some other misc text, was the 'valid in bar area only' line. LAME. If I can read the entire happy hour menu from across the restaurant, but can't read the restriction in question, they need to fix their sign. Or better yet, grace the whole restaurant with your happy hour discounts."
alexa h.,"Agoura Hills, CA",2,13,4,1.0,3/15/2013,"First off, I remember going to BJ's back in high school 10 years ago and liking it. But, maybe my tastebuds have changed.  This review is based solely on pizza and salad that my family ordered for take out. We were so disappointed with the ""deep dish"" pizza (it was not even close to being deep dish and the ingredients weren't anything special) that we ended up throwing out some of it and got a frozen deep dish pizza from Costco, which was WAY WAY better than the deep dish take out from BJ's.  As for the Caesar salad, it was mediocre at best. Very disappointing. For the price of the pizza and the salad, we were expecting bigger portions and tasty food. We got neither, and we won't be ordering food there again."
Matthew T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,5,,5.0,9/16/2014,Daniel S. made me the best peanut butter pizookie I have ever had! The secret is a regular pizookie with a mini spread on top and have them under cook it.
Abtin M.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,6,,3.0,4/6/2015,"Great food but terrible service. Always way too busy and always under staffed. If you have a few hours to burn them great , but if your trying to get a quick bite. This is not the place"
Jin L.,"Malibu, CA",4,3,8,5.0,3/29/2015,"Me and my roommates almost died in happiness in BJs Last night. We ordered Nachos, Large Prime Vegetarian Pizza, and Pizzacookie. The Nachos was great but the real thing is the Prime Vegetarian Pizza, it is a killer! I am always a fan of Vegetarian Pizza and this is the one of the best pizza and it deserves the title Prime. After having pizza, we were in critical condition. But, the resistance to try another menu was uncontrollable. Then, the waiter came and offered us the pizzacookie (The name is unique). Pizzacookie was also very good, especially those nuts inside it. My roommate said, ""The nut makes you go nuts."" haha..."
Emily T.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/9/2014,"My last 2 times here I ended up with the worst food poisoning of my life. Woke up in the middle of the night,passed out, and hit my head on the hard floor because of how much pain I was in. A lot of my friends ended up with the same awful experience after eating there the same night..."
Jason T.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",7,48,2,1.0,12/24/2012,"I think I'm pretty much done with this BJ's.  Came here with the wife after going to a Clippers game and shopping a couple of Sundays' ago and got seated right away.  Unfortunately, that's where the ""service"" ended.  Neither of us wanted something as big and heavy as a thick crust pizza, so we ordered a few appetizers so we could eat tapas style, which I had told the waitress (Elizabeth) we were doing when we ordered.  Our food comes out and I see another waiter attempt to deliver our appetizers to a different table, but before I can flag him down, he goes back to the kitchen with them.  A few minutes later, they arrive at our table and while we have silverware, no one offered any appetizer plates.  We were pretty hungry so we just went ahead and dug in to the flatbread, chicken wings and salad. While we were eating our food, I had finished my beer, but had to wait a good ten minutes before the waitress came by to ask if I'd like another.  We were still a little hungry after the first round of apps, so we were trying to get our waitress' attention to get another menu.  When she finally came by, we requested a menu, but she never brought one.  We had to flag down another waitress to ask for a menu.  We ordered another app which was delivered by yet another waitress whom actually did bring us appetizer plates this time. Our original waitress then told us she was going on break and introduced us to her substitute.  I requested our check from the substitute.  When the check came, I put my card in immediately, but then she walked off without taking the check.  I decided to leave it on the table and head to the restroom.  As mentioned in a previous recent review, the restroom could have used a little tidying up as there were paper towels everywhere and the trash was overflowing.  Came back to the table and the check was still there with the substitute waitress nowhere in sight.  Took the check and walked up to the hostess to pay the bill.  A guy who appeared to be the manager took the check so I could pay, but never once asked how anything was.  I kind of thought that was standard operating procedures in most restaurants, but I guess not at this one."
Cali M.,"Dallas, TX",0,7,,1.0,2/7/2015,"Great food, but service needs big time improvement! I mean for 3 people it takes an hr to make the food. Then the waiter doesn't even come and ask how our food is. This list can go on and on....?"
Steven N.,"Moorpark, CA",16,13,10,1.0,9/7/2014,"Good products, but lousy customer service.  This seems to be a problem with the chain.  But this location is no exception and makes no effort to improve customer service."
Morgan K.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,7,1,1.0,9/14/2014,"Went in for dinner tonight and will probably not be returning anytime soon, at least not with the waiter I had. I am also a server, so I understand that when you're super swamped you may forget a couple things or mix up an order but that was not the case tonight.  We came in for a late dinner just after the dinner rush had died down. After being seated it took 10+ minutes for our server to finally make his way to our table to take our drink order, at which point we were already ready to order our dinner; avocado egg rolls to start, a dinner Caesar salad, the fried artichoke small plate, and a side house salad. He then took quite some time to bring us our drinks, and when they finally arrived there were no straws in them so we had to flag him down and ask him to bring some. There were two of us, and he came back with ONE unwrapped straw in his bare hands! Disgusting. We then had to ask for another one which he brought out in the same way.  The avocado egg roll ""appetizer"" (the only thing worth ordering again) came out just 30 seconds before the rest of the food. What was supposed to be a dinner-sized Caesar salad was the same size as the small house side salad. We decided to overlook the mistake and just eat our dinner because it would have been too much of a hassle to flag him down because he rarely ever came to check on us.  Once we were finished we asked to look at a dessert menu and he said he would be right back to check on us and get our order. 15+ minutes later he came back to get us a half salted caramel/half white chocolate macadamia pizookie. I asked for a refill on my root beer when he took our dessert order, and after waiting for the pizookie to bake, receiving the pizookie, and eating the pizookie my refill still never arrived. When he finally came back to see if we were finished I had to ask for my refill to-go and he said, ""oh, 'they' never brought it to you? Oh that's right, 'they' were changing the keg.""  Right...I'm sure that HE wasn't the one that completely forgot about me. And it wasn't just our table. I heard the tables surrounding us in his section also repeatedly ask for things that he had forgotten to bring.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was far below average. I would not choose to dine here again and if I did I would be sure to request a different server."
Liz M.,"Columbus, OH",554,605,208,1.0,12/28/2010,Horrid service and and completely mediocre food. Don't waste your time here. I think the only reason this place gets business is becasue it's open later than most restaurants in the area.  Tip: Drive the 30 minutes to Ventura and get some food and service that's worth your Saturday night!
Tony J.,"Jersey City, NJ",119,382,43,3.0,8/7/2013,Came here with a couple of teammates from school. I had a burger and also tried a bit of a friend's pizookie. Pretty solid fare overall.
Brandon F.,"Westlake Village, CA",260,15,,5.0,3/5/2015,Top notch love this place great food favorite beer is J Red they got on draft. Happy hour when i go usually. People are friendly and there on it. Id recommended this place fersher
Katelin F.,"Agoura Hills, CA",8,4,1,3.0,1/23/2015,"Tonight me and a companion visited this establishment. Upon arriving we were shown to our seats in a very timely manner. The wicked witch of the west quickly came to take out order for we knew what we wanted, that was the last we saw of her. We had to hunt down different waitresses in order to get our drinks refilled and order our pizookies. Finally after an hour and half of no service we contacted the manager. The table directly next to us heard us complain and turned to us to inform us they had the same problem with the same waitress as well. The manager was very kind and apologized deeply. People like her give me faith in the world. We will be returning because this is a great restaurant just an unfortunate hire."
Love L.,"Calabasas, CA",0,4,,5.0,1/11/2016,"Had a great experience here! I had a large party of 13 people who were rather loud (thankfully we were alone on the enclosed patio) but Kori our waitress was excellent. She was patient, helpful, and adorable! Another server who was assisting named Joey was just as amazing! All in all, I will be coming back because of Cory and Joey's great service!"
