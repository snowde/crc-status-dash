Dennis S.,"Dallas, TX",510,854,21,3.0,6/21/2011,"I have been to BJ's several times. It is very reliable for consistently good service and excellent food. I know it is a Brew pup but I have only had one beer there for dinner. It was long enough ago that I don't recall which beer I tried but it was very good. The salads are excellent and my iced tea was never empty. I guess my only complaint is that I sometimes feel a bit rushed to order and turn over the table. There is usually several people waiting for tables so I understand the rush. If I am looking for a place to hang out with a friend over lunch for an hour or more I usually try another restaurant. For a quick, quality meal with good service I think you will be happy."
Diane A.,"Woburn, MA",0,11,6,5.0,3/27/2015,"We eat at BJ's fairly regularly and always enjoy their food. The wait staff are generally friendly but tonight we had the best waiter ever. We were seated in Blake's area and we are so glad we were. He was phenomenal - friendly, entertaining, polite and efficient. The thing that struck me most was that unlike other servers, Blake took the time to talk to our almost 9-year old son. He made sure he was happy with his meal, made sure he got his food first and treated him like a real person. Anyone with kids knows most servers ignore the kids.  Thanks, Blake for a great Friday night dinner experience! One other thing that impressed me about the restaurant itself is that they were super busy. We got there around 6:15 and the wait was about 20 minutes.  (Not bad for a Friday night). A young lady came around apologizing for the wait and offering people slices of cheese pizza. What a great way to keep people happy while waiting to be served!"
Banthena B.,"Oak Park, CA",0,3,,4.0,1/29/2015,"Have always loved the food at BJ's.  Chicken a la fresco used to be my regular choice but I don't see it in their menu any more. Recently, tried Moroccan spiced salmon and chocolate Pizookie and they were delicious. Can't go wrong at BJ's..."
Angelica M.,"Riverside, CA",256,27,47,2.0,6/18/2014,"This BJ's among others is thoroughly disappointing.  Service from start to finish was lamentable.  Our food order was acceptable, however, upon ordering dessert, the same dessert came in 20 minutes later as opposed to the first dessert.  The manager was then notified and promptly DID NOT resolve the situation by paying adequate attention to the situation.  The second dessert then came out with an unknown object in which we suspect was an object of retaliation of complaint.  The manager was then notified AGAIN and promptly did not resolve the second situation either.  Needless to say, despite receiving coupons for the next visit, which will never happen, BJ's will be the last restaurant on my list to consider for a meal.  The name of the manager that poorly handled the situation was Peter."
Joseph S.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,123,3,5.0,7/15/2013,"Good food at good price. Excellent beer selection and solid TV setup.  As far as a cheap and good meal goes while watching the game, this is hard to beat."
Hannah E.,"Westlake Village, CA",7,10,15,5.0,11/30/2014,"Amazing food! Great customer service! The waiters are funny, nice and really go above and beyond to make sure you're happy. Ive never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated, usually I just walk in with no reservations and Im seated right away. The menu has a wide variety of yummy food, I would recommend the Avocado egg rolls for an appetizer and one of the flatbreads for a main meal.The pizookie desert is the best!!!  Its a fun place to watch sports at and hang out with friends/family. The custom beers are flavorful and refreshing. I literally couldn't live without this place! Its overall an amazing restaurant."
Jang P.,"Westlake Village, CA",160,25,1,4.0,7/13/2014,So my girlfriend and I  go to Bj's about twice a month. Tonight we went and our server John was great. The only reason my girlfriend and I don't go there more is because sometimes the customer service is not the best but today it was on point  once again thanks to john. Only giving 4 stars because my usual experience but tonight was 5-star.  Ps: new s'mores pazookie is AMAZING!!
Norman M.,"Newbury Park, CA",200,136,72,5.0,6/6/2013,Take Out from BJ's tonight. I love that pot roast dinner. You can even get curbside pickup. The pot roast is my favorite at BJ's.
Diana B.,"Agoura, CA",47,18,8,3.0,10/22/2014,"My kids love this place and finally they started a new Manu  that I like too, their beat salad is good and their tuna salad is fantastic !!! Pizzas are good too ! Their pizookies are the best !"
Wesley E.,"Simi Valley, CA",9,53,2,4.0,7/9/2013,"Come here often for lunch deals, we're right across the street at work.  BJ's often sends me coupons, but even if they didn't, their lunch specials menu is great. Sandwich or Pizza with soup or salad, good iced tea, and reasonably priced. Their new BBQ lunch plate is an even crazier deal, and very tasty. I don't have much to say other than this is our go-to place for a quick and easy lunch. It also doesn't hurt that Gamestop is right next door."
Ty L.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,17,,3.0,7/21/2016,"Love thirr late night happy hour because wine is 1/2 off. They are usually pretty good about getting to us since we come by after work and they are usually on the tail end of their shifts. There is a bigger gentleman with dark hair who helped us out the last few times and he was wonderful! Prompt, checks in to make sure everything is good, and keeps small talk when we make a joke or a remark. Last time though the waitress seemed a bit off. She might have been new. She got our drinks fairly fast but then never came backround. we had 2 more people join us and we wanted desert plus another round but she didnt come back until 1150ish ( we had been there since probably 1115-1130)  by then we didnt want wait for the food or the drinks. She could have had a much larger check if she just checked in. She seemed quite flustered even after we asked for the bill it took another 10 mins to get it. Maybe she way just having an off night but it may make me think twice before coming by for my weekly drink"
Steph E.,"WOODLAND HLS, CA",115,148,179,3.0,4/29/2013,"First lunch at this location. Service as kinda slow. Food was ok, but nothing more. I may give them another shot at it."
J C.,"Bullhead City, AZ",2,75,16,2.0,9/15/2014,"Bummed!  Bad meal here tonight, had the half rack of ribs...  With asparagus :-(.  Dried out from sitting under the heat lamps or oven Warmers asparagus was pitiful and shrunken due to drying out.   Should have sent it back,  ribs were dry as well.   Probably would have been great if it would have been served when the plate was ready.     Just not good tonight."
Alexandra M.,"Moorpark, CA",0,4,,2.0,1/6/2016,Love the food here but I would consider coming more if I could get decent service at least once. Every time I go I want to order right when I'm greeted because I know the food will take forever. It's unfortunate because the food and dessert is great but the service is terrible
Elle F.,"Buena Park, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/26/2015,"Excellent food, excellent service! Even after receiving a wrong order, they made it right--and then some! Thank you Steven (manager) and the BJ's staff."
P B.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,41,,2.0,5/17/2014,"Have been going there for years - and the service just keeps getting worse and worse.  I see management around - but not helpful to the customers at all.  Service is soooo slow - I was there 2 hours the other night for a simple meal on a night that was not even that crowded.  The staff that mans the seating at the front are usually lazy and more interested in talking to each other then seating.  Tables will be empty for 1/2 hour before they seat - I know sometimes that is done for staffing issues but it happens often there - it is actually offensive to be told my wait will be 1/2 hour when there are at least 6 tables all over the restaurant that are avail for seating. It is a local, easy place to go to - but my time is too valuable to spend it waiting for my meal here."
Debra K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,18,1,1.0,9/1/2014,"My boyfriend: ummmm, is there supposed to be a french fry in the chili? Waiter: no, it must have fallen in Us: check please"
M L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",23,61,33,3.0,8/30/2015,"Had not visited BJ's for a while and decided to take the family after a Sunday movie matinee. It was busy as expected but we got seated fairly quickly.  We got water and ice tea shortly after but we had to ask again for our beers.  The Nutty Brunettes were tasty and cold once they came.  Two of us got side salads and soup in reasonable time but 2 in our party didn't get food for quite a while after that.  Kind of made it tough to have lunch together with it coming out piecemeal.  And the most complex item to cook was a personal pizza so unsure why it came that way. That said, the food was very good (avocado egg rolls, watermelon and feta,  Cesar and twisted BLT salads,  broccoli cheese soup)  with the exception of the clam chowder which was bland with too much potato for our taste.  Wait staff was friendly. Not a bad meal, just not something I would go out of my way to eat again. Admittedly, we might have been better off with more substantial fare like a burger. They looked great."
Derrick D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",13,12,,4.0,10/28/2014,Went to bj's for the late night happy hour with my friend. Avacado rolls were great as always and the mini appetizers were a great deal. Kevin the bartender was on top of everything and our drinks were always full. Can't waiter go back.
Janet H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,102,107,3.0,7/2/2014,"Stopped in for the first time yesterday night for dinner.  Found a parking spot quickly and got seated quickly so all that is a plus.  Our waiter was prompt, efficient and not hovering in an obnoxious way so another plus.  The environs are a bit dark for my taste (I'd like to see what is on the table in front of me) but had a friendly vibe.  We ordered a California Club Flatbread and the new Kale and Brussels Sprouts Salad.  Both dishes were tasty and fit our ""light eating"" mantra for the night.  Closing out our tab and getting a box was easy too... our server was attentive and circled back to see if we needed anything else.  Overall it was a good first experience.  I felt that the food taste and execution could have been a bit better to have gotten bumped up another star, but I still can't complain for the ""average/everyday"" dining experience.  I would return and try them again."
