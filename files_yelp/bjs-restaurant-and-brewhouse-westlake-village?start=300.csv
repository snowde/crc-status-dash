Denver L.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,98,13,1.0,4/12/2012,"So i was in town for work and wanted to meet some friends for an late night drink. We decided on BJ's as it was close to the hotel and work as well. I've been to a few around the country so I know what to expect when i arrive. At this particular location i wasn't impressed. The waiter was slow on getting our orders even though we were the only table in the entire wing of that place. Also our drinks were very weak, my margarita tasted just like sweet and sour. So i went for my traditional nutty brunette, and that tasted like a bad keg, Just all kinds of wrong."
MeMe I.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,10,2,5.0,5/29/2014,"All I can say this place is SOOOO AWESOME.  EXCELLENT SERVICE, great ATMOSPHERE, DELICIOUS FOOD yum yum yum.... what a Beauty & Elegant and Spacious inside... I  obviously recommend this restaurant to everybody! More Power Guys!!!   MeMe S."
Greg B.,"Santa Clarita, CA",1,46,,1.0,5/11/2013,I call on Friday @ 5:30 to give them my name for a table and to see if there is a wait. The person takes my name and party for four and says there is no wait. I get there in 5 minutes and there are at least 20 people waiting around and the person didn't write my name down. So they say the wait is 5 to 10 minutes. 20 minutes later we are still waiting and waiting and waiting  as two parties of 2 get seated in booths for 4.   Bye Bye BJ's..  What a circus...................
Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121,1.0,1/27/2012,"UPDATE- Please when I have a bad experience at a place WHY WOULD I EVER GO BACK?- SHAME ON ME. So yesterday 3-25-12 was my friends Birthday, she requested we go to BJ's. I went with an open mind even though my first time there was awful. Well the fact is the place is consistant. Awful service. Disinterested or just imcompetent server. The food took forever to come. The appetizers came with the main meal-except for one of our party of five. Two people ordered dessert-one was complimentry due to the birthday, guess which one they ""forgot"" to bring. We had to wait TWENTY MINUTES for the second one to arrive, we had asked our server to just credit the one that was ordered for the B-day one.  He said he could not do that. His additude was reflected in the tip we left. If you want awful service and mediocre food then this is the place for your. --------------------------------- I had heard great things about this place so I was excited to try it today. It took OVER AN HOUR for us to get a Pizza and an order of Fish and Chips. The Pizza was ordinary and the Fish and Chips were greasey and overcooked. Then we tried their signature dessert the pazookie.....one word -ordinary. I had the oatmeal/raisin, and it was so hard I could have put a two penny nail threw it. Overpriced and slow. We did have a very pleasant server Overall review- Never again"
Nestor G.,"Redwood City, CA",48,254,1,5.0,6/8/2014,"Came here again with my family. I ordered a burger this time and my sister pizza and my parents pasta dishes. The burger was really good and my sister's pizza was really good. Again, this place delivered again with great service and food."
David M.,"Camarillo, CA",3,16,12,5.0,8/21/2014,Had a business lunch today at BJ's.  Food was outstanding and our server Michelle was awesome.  I'll be back!!
Look A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,8,,1.0,9/25/2015,"What happened to this place? My burger was over cooked but cold. When you pay $15 for a burger, you expect it to be made to order."
Shane H.,"Plano, TX",98,274,74,2.0,12/13/2012,BJ's has great food (especially the pizza) and an awesome lunch menu. The customer service however is quite possibly as bad as any restaurant in Ventura County.
Joleen Q.,"Winnetka, CA",519,1017,284,4.0,2/6/2012,Haven't been here in years but the nachos and deep dish pizza (with wheat crust!) were great. There is a great selection of beers and service was pretty fast considering it was late for a weeknight. Plus points for the new gluten free pizza and pizookie!
Gregory O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",39,20,,2.0,2/17/2014,"The ticket times are notoriously slow, and this BJs is no different.  Their service staff is often burdened by too many tables at once as well.  I waited 13 minutes for my beer, 45 for my pizza.  The beer was warm when it arrived, meaning it had probably sat out quite a bit before reaching my strong, manly hands.  I expect corporations to be faster and more machinated, but clearly BJs is the exception to the rule.  How unfortunate."
Dr K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,13,,4.0,12/11/2015,Love their groupon and coupons. very friendly
Randy G.,"Paso Robles, CA",0,4,1,1.0,1/21/2015,First while parking we thought the place was closed. There were no lights on outside and it had been dark outside for awhile.  Bjs used to be a happening atmosphere.  You could here a pin drop in that place. When we ordered our drinks and the first time our server only brought 3 out of the 5 we ordered. 5 minutes later she brought the second round from the bar. I still had to wait 17 minutes to get a diet Pepsi. When the food finally arrived it was tasty.  We did over hear our table next to asking if anyone worked here and struggling to get someone's attention. Apparently their service was as prompt as ours. We dropped $80 tonight and the service was horrible. The manager just stood watching the train wreck and was doing nothing about it. As we were leaving the two hosts completely ignored us and didn't thank us or even look at us. This place is a joke. Save your money and go to cheesecake or lazy dog.
Maria P.,"Simi Valley, CA",8,41,3,1.0,7/1/2015,"My review is solely on the service I received today. The biggest issue was the server that we had "" Shane B"". We sat at a booth at the bar. The whole place was almost empty with at most 10 tables occupied. Most of the servers were just hanging out since it was that dead inside. By hanging out I mean socializing with one another by the bar and on the phone . We ordered only a small pizza which took 30 min to receive. The server we had took 10 min to have us place our order. Normally this isn't an issue but the fact that the place was empty was really frustrating. There was a table behind us that ordered a lot of things and the server went to that table well over five times to ask if everything was OK. Not only that but a few times he would update them on there food coming out. We feel that we did not get the same level of service due to the fact that we didn't order that many items. When we finally received our food and were all finished we asked for the check and Shane walked to the register to retrieve it. Instead of bringing it over to us he began socializing with the guy at the bar. It wasn't until I looked at him with an upset look that he wrapped up his conversations and brought us the tab. I was very disappointed with the service received today."
Connor M.,"Fountain Valley, CA",4,22,1,1.0,1/13/2015,"Food is good but can get it anywhere so the one star is strictly for the service. Pablo was extremely rude, it was 2:45 and we asked if it was still okay to order off the lunch special to be polite (it ends at 3) and he shrugged his shoulders and said ""I guess, why not"". He took our order, it took 25 minutes to get our food (which a runner brought out, not Pablo), and we didn't see him again until he forced the check on us when we were still eating and wanted to order dessert. Won't go back here in the afternoon and will probably just stick to Cheesecake Factory."
Chris C.,"San Francisco, CA",344,369,48,3.0,8/9/2010,Typical BJs fare.  Late night service was pretty good and the food is about what you'd expect from a BJs location.  I got the Mediterranean pizza at this location and it was delicious.  The Avocado Eggrolls are also pretty consistent with what I've had at previous BJs locations.  I see some reviews about this place having bad staff but I came in pretty close to their kitchen closing time and the staff was pretty friendly. I probably don't see myself coming back here anytime soon because of location but at least this experience was a pretty positive one.
Cody B.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,3,1,1.0,8/18/2014,Honestly if I could I would give them negative stars I waited an hour for mozzarella sticks and I'm just done with this whole chain now DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!
Iris H.,"San Francisco, CA",56,108,34,2.0,7/15/2012,"Do NOT go here if you want quality-tasting food. I've been to BJ's several times and its food has never been above average for me. I'd finally had it when I ordered the Garden Burger last night and it didn't taste like ANYTHING. It was just a big hunk of BLAH filled with calories, and I had to wash it down with the fries on the side (which were not great either and went cold after 5 minutes).  I also had their famous strawberry teaser, which tasted great at first, but it was definitely way too rich after I was halfway through. Honestly food should NEVER be forced down because you don't want to waste it. Which was exactly how I feel at every meal here."
Clayton J.,"Solvang, CA",0,8,,4.0,10/4/2014,Good food. Fun atmosphere. But the calorie counts on the menu kind of brings you down. Good portion. A lot of options. My wife loves their stuffed mushroom.
Mona T.,"Chino Hills, CA",54,106,44,2.0,2/20/2012,"Terrible service!!  We had to wait sooo long to get seated ( which is expected during weekend dinnertime) However, after we were seated we never saw the waiter again after sooo long! Once we did order and receive our food, the waiter completely forgot about us! we were constantly flagging down any waiter/waitress we saw to try and get something ( like water, ranch, silverware!) Gosh it was kind of stressful! And a few waiters brought us food items that werent even for our table! we had to tell them that wasnt ours and then they looked puzzled and went to find out who that food went to!  omg such chaos! Buffalo pizza was great and so was the white pizza with chicken. BUT next time i will order take out so i can ditch the customer service!!"
uriel e.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",9,20,,3.0,3/16/2014,"Same old Bj's. Good food, terrible service. Food is always good, I mean how could you screw up a set recipe. I gave them two stars off for the service. Late food, forgotten drinks and wrong bill!  I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because they would of received 2 1/2 stars just on there service."
