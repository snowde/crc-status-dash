Jarrod M.,"San Diego, CA",18,43,3,4.0,2/25/2012,"The convenience of this location makes it an easy choice when at a loss of places to go for dinner. Parking can be a bit of a pain in the small parking lot, but not too bad. The cavernous interior easily fills with the noise of the crowds that seem to be ever present in a place this popular. These crowds seem to also slow the service a bit, which can be a bit trying at times. The food is almost always good and serving sizes are more than adequate. Try the flatbread appetizer pizzas for a great starter for a group, or a meal that is plenty for one person. Fanburgers are always a good go-to and the grilled chicken pasta is tops. The food is good; my only gripe is the menu is not super dynamic. All the beers on tap are great. My personal favorites are the porter, the hefeweizen and seasonals, as available.  As I said at the top, this is a great go-to place and I'll surely be back."
Natalie M.,"Torrance, CA",49,53,4,2.0,10/18/2013,Awful. Slow service. I mean  slooow. Took 45 min to get a table on Friday night when  they told us it would take 20. After we ordered our food took another half hour at least. Food was so so for the price. Would not go back.
Ginger P.,"Santa Clarita, CA",12,153,14,5.0,4/18/2014,We love BJs - especially the enLighted menu....today it's the margjerita flatbread & salad. Staff friendly as always!!
Ginger E.,"Austin, TX",0,19,1,1.0,12/21/2014,"Appalled at the service we received today. My family has been coming to this BJs regularly since it opened,  and we almost always receive good service but today things were terrible.  Our own server paid little attention us and was impossible to find,  leaving us waiting for a long time to order,  get our food and other things we needed, and our check. When she was taking our order I ordered for my 3 year old daughter and instead of waiting for me to tell her what I wanted she moved on to the next person and ignored me. She never brought my daughter water,  even though I asked for it both when we sat down and when she asked me what my daughter wanted to drink when I ordered her meal. We had to shout to get the attention of another server who tried really hard to ignore us, so we could get water after waiting ten minutes and never seeing our own server. The other server made no attempt to hide her irritation that we dared to ask her to help even though she was not assigned to our table. She was rude when we asked and rude when she delivered the water,  I even apologized for asking her to help and explained we hadn't seen our server. When our food came I asked,  nicely, for the food runner to bring me the oil and vinegar I had requested with my salad and he said,with major attitude, ""Did you ask for oil and vinegar?"" As if it was my fault that I hadn't received it. I did ask for it,  and since when does it matter? I'm very polite to servers and I wasn't rude today despite bring treated so badly by them so I was surprised with the attitude. I understand when things take a long time or orders are messed up and I would never hold that against a hard working server. These people were just plain rude,  ans it wasn't one person,  it was everyone we encountered. I've never worked in a restaurant but I have worked in hospitality and retail so I know how hard it is to be in front of customers all day,  but we weren't  asking for anything exceptional or giving  them a hard time. A simple smile or apology for the long wait would have made up for everything. There's no need for attitude.   If the employees of continue to treat us like we are bothering them by coming in we might stop."
Carlos C.,"Westlake Village, CA",4,5,,1.0,3/3/2014,"Just the other night I order take out and it was probably the worst experience I've had, I ordered a pizza and I took it home to find out it was wrong, took it back and they still gave me the wrong pizza for the second time, in the midst of this the pizookie I ordered was had now become cold and unenjoyable. This really ruined a good night."
Gina O.,"Agoura Hills, CA",1,20,2,1.0,8/1/2015,"Horrible management.  No, I do not want to join your membership as soon as I walk in the door.  We were seated, took at least 15 minutes to see our waiter (who's shirt was filthy).  After another 20 minutes someone came by to let us know they were out of egg whites (we were there for breakfast on a Saturday morning) and it would only take about 4 more minutes.  After another 25 minutes with no one coming to the table to check on us, no food, no compensation we got up and left.  We wasted an hour there.  Won't be going back."
John K.,"Lawndale, CA",107,106,13,3.0,5/21/2012,"I love the food, beverages, location, and atmosphere. What I love most is that they have televised all of the recent LA Kings' playoff games and there seems to be a decent group of Kings' fans showing up to watch the games. The only downside is they play music instead of the telecast. While I don't need to hear the comentators it is an added bonus that most establishments I hang out at throw in gladly. So great.....but room for improvement if you're a sports enthusiast."
Tom A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",67,16,5,4.0,6/9/2014,"Want to watch a game , enjoy craft beer, dig into pizza or burgers?  This is your place.  Plus they have  Pizookie-you can't go wrong with eating the Pizookie trio all by yourself.  Life has to be perfect-enjoy beer with your Pizookie!!"
Theodore S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",41,255,88,3.0,11/22/2013,"I have been coming here for years and it has always been the same quality of service and food. The spinach & artichoke pizza is my favorite paired with the Jeremiah Red. I like how big the TVs are and that you can see them from anywhere in the restaurant. This place is usually always busy for dinner, so make a reservation."
Suesue E.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,21,,2.0,8/27/2014,"I had my 20th birthday here recently with a party of 20. I honestly did not have a pleasant experience at all. First of all, my server started speaking with ""this is how it's going to go."" No introduction, I never found out her name, nothing. She started explaining how we need to divide ourselves into groups of five because it makes it ""easier"" to split the check that way. I am a waitress myself, and I understand it is difficult to split checks with a large party, but I didn't appreciate how that is the first thing she decided to say. How about a ""Hi, how are you?"" ""Are we celebrating something?"" ""My name is _____ I will be your server.""  We divided ourselves into groups, but she split the checks wrong. I had a mixture of guests at this dinner (some from work, some from school) and she mixed guests who have never met before so it made it very awkward that she messed that up  because people who have never spoke before were discussing their money. Also, she got upset that we changed seats. I UNDERSTAND there is a seat order that the orders are taken, but I was the third seat from the edge of the table. Myself & the 2 people to my left moved over ONE seat to make room for a guest who was on her way. We also did this BEFORE we even ordered our meal. She came back and told us ""Don't move."" and looked at us like we completely jumbled the whole entire party. 3 people literally moved down one seat. That is all. When my guest came (the guest that seat I made room for) she brought another guest, so I had to move over one more seat. She came back and said ""Hold on. Was there another switch?"" I said ""Yes there was. I just moved down one more seat."" and she said again not to move. and I responded ""I moved before you even took orders, so you're fine."" (obviously irritated) & she stated ""Yeah but I took your DRINK orders in an order."" It was really frustrating. People move seats at a restaurant all the time. I experience this at my restaurant. I never tell my guests they aren't allowed to move seats! Obviously I am moving somewhere where I am more comfortable. My job isn't to make your job easier. My job is to be your guest & the server's job is to accomodate the party. Again, I AM A SERVER MYSELF I understand the confusion. The seat switches were minor! It is an easy fix it wasn't a big deal! Our server wasn't friendly and barely cracked a smile which made it feel like every request was such a burden. Not very welcoming at all. My food and pizookie came out and tasted very delicious, but on the other half of the table their burgers were dead cold. and they ordered a pizookie and the entire bottom of the pizookie was black burnt, so they were only able to eat the top layer. Another guest got her food after everyone finished eating, but they did comp her meal so that was okay. The paying process was horrible because of what I said earlier of the checks not being separated correctly (even though we split ourselves into fives for her convenience), and I was really upset that gratuity is included when I felt like it was undeserved. The only thing she did that I appreciated was that she kept up on her refilling of drinks. I am someone who drinks 3-4 cups of water and I never had to ask for a refill. I don't know what this woman's issue was, maybe she was upset she has a younger table and was concerned about her tip...whatever it was it was unacceptable.  Overall, really negative experience. Only reason this isn't getting 1 star is because I feel bad giving a low review."
Taty T.,"Big River, CA",0,21,2,4.0,6/30/2014,"Fantastic food. I love the Parmesan crusted chicken and it comes with a Chardonnay butter sauce that is to die for! It is a little pricey so I can't come here as much as I want to but I would definitely recommend coming here, it can make a great date night dinner. Oh, and getting Pizookie is a must!! Service has been good when I go although it can get quite busy which creates longer wait times for everything."
Andrew S.,"Provo, UT",13,24,5,5.0,6/20/2014,By far my favorite place to go for a little nicer place to eat on the weekend. AMAZING pizza. But by far my favorite dessert anywhere is here... The pazzokie. I crave them when I'm not able to come for a while.
Cory J.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,19,,2.0,1/26/2015,"I really like the food here, but the service is so appalling I hate to go there.  At lunch a couple of weeks ago, the five meals for the five of us all came at five different times, it took three requests for one of the diners with a side salad to get any dressing, drinks were not refilled. I ordered teh seared ahi salad with wasabi, no wasabi was on the salad, plate or anywhere else to be found and i didn't want to wait another half hour of it to arrive.   Someone should hit me on the head next time I think about going there."
Carina E.,"Newbury Park, CA",29,52,54,3.0,3/8/2014,"The food is usually really good. The servers are typically friendly.  The bathrooms could use some attention. I love the Berry Burst cider. Plus they offer half off wine Tuesdays. Here are my two reasons why BJ'S gets a mid rating.  1). No WiFi offered. Really?  In this day and age? 2). As a patron I should not have to try to manage the order of the food coming out of the kitchen. Ever. But you need to every time you are here. Otherwise the soup/salad comes out prior to the appetizer which may or may not come out with the entree. And if you advise your server, without fail, you will receive  a learned by rote reason why it happens and it's the timing of how the orders are placed. It is never, ever the servers fault, the kitchens fault or the managers responsibility. Every area passes the buck. So, we order our appetizer. Once received we give the next part of our order. After received we give our entree order. BJ'S, if you bother to read  this you really should make some changes. BTW, I have heard  this from so many of your patrons. Some that are now past patrons due to your inability to adapt to your guests needs."
Dennis E.,"Irvine, CA",84,39,19,1.0,10/4/2011,"Horrible service and prices went up. Service sucked, it took nearly 45 minutes for us to get our food and we had 3 server changes within that time. When we spoke with the manager about the poor service he seemed disinterested and didn't offer to correct any of the mistakes the original server made; in fact, we had to pay for drinks we never received. Left a negative tip to show some love... I will NOT be returning."
Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1069,1230,6273,4.0,5/3/2013,"We had my husband's surprise birthday party here, and I have to say, BJ's did a fine job with handling our needs, keeping our glasses filled, a constant stream of food (that I pre-ordered and chose myself.........from several appetizers to 3 different salads to 4 different pizza types, and on to the pizookies).  Everything was delicious, and not only did everyone have a great time (esp. my husband sharing the big 5-0 with his beloved friends and family), but everyone loved the food, I loved the very reasonable price, and last but not least, the fact that this was ONE of only TWO restaurants that would cater to crowd of more than 20 in that they'd (a) give us a reservation AND (b) they let us sit inside in an air-cooled building, well, that's all I needed.  Everything about it was great, the price, the service, the food.  They even let me decorate our area, balloons, confetti, whatever I wanted.  We all had a really great time, and we were well taken care of !!  Thanks, BJ's !!"
Benjamin W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",5,15,2,3.0,3/3/2014,"Food is good, the specialty brews from Belgium are good. The waitstaff is consistently horrid. I really wish the management would either hire more waitstaff or better qualified personnel. Good food, bad service."
coral p.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,6,,2.0,7/7/2013,"I came here with a large group of about 15 people. We called ahead and had a reservation for 8:45pm. We got there at around 8:15 and hung around for a bit. Come 8:45, and we're told to sit inside and that our table will be ready shortly. Totally fine. 5 minutes pass.. 15 minutes pass.. 20 minutes pass.. at this point we're getting irritated and hungry because it's getting late. Apparently the table that they've ""reserved"" for us has a group of inconsiderate people still sitting around after all their food's been long gone. At this point I feel kind of sorry for the waiters because they're obviously being put in an uncomfortable position; they can't exactly kick out the other occupants.  Finally, 35 minutes AFTER our reservation time, they seat us out in the patio. The service is subpar; nobody's hurrying to come take the orders that we've already decided upon while we were waiting for our table. At one point nearly everybody's water cup is empty and not a single waiter comes to fill them back up for 15 minutes. That's kind of ridiculous. The food was solid and the only reason there are multiple stars on this review. At the end of this, nothing was done to try to make up for the ridiculous wait time. I understand if there was nothing you could really do to hurry that part up, but I would most definitely comp something to make up for it, if at least just the drinks. Will not be coming here again."
John H.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,30,,5.0,5/27/2015,"We arranged for BJ's to host our wedding rehearsal dinner and when we got there 20 minutes early for our scheduled time we found the room was ready for us despite the restaurant being packed (which it always is). While waiting for the rest of the party to join us I sat at the bar and was immediately met with a very friendly bar tender, again they are busy, who took my drink order right away and served it up. During the evening they brought out as much pizza, salad, and pasta as we could eat. The service and food were fantastic and made a very special evening go off without a hitch. Best of all the price for over 30 people was lower than anticipated!"
Owen D.,"Reno, NV",0,7,,1.0,5/26/2014,"We sat in the bar for 15 minutes, not even a inquiry to see if we would like a glass of water, let alone a beer!!!!! We were there to eat, drink and be merry! What a disappointment!!! The restaurant was not even busy! Blows my mind!!!!! I worked in Northern California for most of last year and BJ's was a great place to go and get great service, food and drink. Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere."
