Ashlee M.,"Calabasas, CA",94,83,18,4.0,1/18/2014,"I'm not typically a fan of chain restaurants, but BJ's is one of my few exceptions.  I just love the pizza there.  This location is always slammed, even late at night.  But their food is always spot-on."
Michelle R.,"New York, NY",199,724,99,4.0,12/19/2011,I love coming here for lunch and a good beer. Their veggie pasta is pretty good - I never tried anything else on the menu.
Sara R.,"Simi Valley, CA",284,141,32,1.0,1/16/2014,I HATE this place!!! The food is always mediocre! Ugh I always regret coming here thinking that it would get better but it never does. I also go to the bjs in Westwood and that one is way better. The service at this one is horrible and I can never get a good waiter. So disappointed.
Amelia R.,"Kearny Mesa, San Diego, CA",0,11,6,1.0,3/29/2014,The problem with this place is that 3 out of the 4 employees act like we are inconveniencing them when we call in to order.  Then when the order is wrong they give us attitude.  Service really sucks and I eat here infrequently so I tend to forget how bad it is.  I'm shocked they have any customers at all.
Bob J.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,2.0,9/27/2013,The food and beer are great but I am not sure I have been at a place with slower service.  I am sure they train their servers to provide the slow service.
Payton B.,"Calabasas, CA",28,33,,5.0,7/21/2014,"By far my favorite restaurant for a night out with the girls! The food is amazing and such a fun atmosphere! Also, the Pizookie was great!"
Lindsay S.,"Encinitas, CA",89,38,36,3.0,4/14/2011,"I've had a lot of mixed experiences at BJs. Food-wise everything has been great. My favorites are the shrimp tacos and Mediterranean pizza.. Their seasonal pumpkin ale is literally the best I have ever tried - it tastes like pumpkin pie!  Service is so-so. I've gone in with a party of 10 and had exceptional service, but then with a part of 3, our server barely gave us any attention.  It definitely depends on the experience of your server.  Also, it tends to get extremely packed at peak hours so call ahead to put your name on the waiting list."
JB M.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,57,9,3.0,12/20/2013,"Food was fine but it took the 45 minutes to seat our party. Then the waiter was pushy throughout the night. Not rude just pushy, as if to say 'what do you want? Here it is, now eat it & go. '  I won't be coming back."
Greg W.,"Agoura Hills, CA",103,661,80,3.0,12/16/2013,I have been coming here for many years.  The bar portion is pretty cool for a food and drink place so if you like that this is a good place.  On the restaurant side its a little eh.  The food is generally decent but they get orders wrong or you end up waiting a while.  Overall its at best a typical BJ's.  I would not however have a group event here.  I have been to two of them here and they have been a total clusterF***.  Orders take super long and they messup who gets what.  You never get a drink refill either.
Jaanhvi V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",20,19,1,3.0,1/12/2014,"BJs has pretty decent food (love me some pizookie!) and service can be good, but really nothing outstanding. However, it is open later than most places in TO so I end up coming here often. They have good happy hour (M-F 3-7 PM and Su-Th 10 PM to close) prices and pretty good drinks and on Tuesdays they have half off all wine.  The worst thing about this restaurant is their to-go service. I've tried it about 3 times and will never again do it. The first time, my order was completely wrong, and of course I didn't notice until I came home. I had to go back, and they apologized, made my order (not rushed at all), and did not offer ANYTHING for my troubles. The second time, my order was somehow misplaced and they had no recollection of it, so I had to wait while they made the order. Again, no offer of anything. The most recent time, I ordered online, and the order was in their system, but somehow the kitchen did not have the order so nothing was prepared. No one told me this though. The woman working the carryout station just said ""give me a second"" and disappeared for 5 minutes before coming back and telling me that they weren't sure what happened but they would make the order now. This time they offered me a soda or ice tea while I was waiting (but that too only about 15 minutes into my wait), but I only drink water so I said no thanks. But that's it, nothing else. No free mini pizookie or anything like that, and I waited there for a half hour. I got home and noticed that the bun of my burger, which I had asked to substitute whole wheat for, was not actually whole wheat. Overall, I definitely would not recommend getting carryout from here. If you are going to eat there, I would try to go during down times (not a Friday or Saturday night), or during happy hour."
Mon S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,5/18/2014,"Ambiance and service was very good, However the food wasn't very impressive at all The calamari was bland and chewy, very greasy My husband ordered the Cobb salad and to his disappointment it has cubed processed turkey ;( big turn off We were very hungry after being atnd shopping at the Camarillo outlet and being at  a soccer tournament where  my daughter received a coupon for a pazzoki ( the reason why we went to BJs) My chicken lemone wasn't worth their price, chicken tasted like Costcos pre cooked chicken breast, not freshly cooked or grilled The sauce was pour over the angel hair pasta and the precooked breasts I felt nauseous after having 3-4 bites, we had already complained about the calamari so i just didn't eat my food Such a waste of our money. The only plus I can say, it's the pizza; My boys liked it, they are 9 and 17 Not sure how good food critics they are. Save your money and go somewhere else!"
Haylie P.,"Camarillo, CA",0,12,7,4.0,3/27/2014,"I usually am not really into chain restaurants but I like this place. They have a huge menu and for something quick and easy, it fits the bill."
Candy A.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,4,,5.0,6/9/2015,"Love this place, we eat there at least once a month.  Great food and service."
Conejo R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,2.0,6/5/2014,"The food at BJ's is the same as with any BJ's. Pretty decent fare. The 2 star rating is for the service. I've been in this location many times for lunch, dinner and (what is laughingly considered in Westlake) late night. Of those times I can recall only 1 good experience. The other times the servers have been inaccurate and inattentive. I am not a horrible patron. I don't ask for tricky substitutions or picky nonsense. But, if I ask for water 3 times and it still doesn't arrive, I do start to get tempted to just hit up the station myself. Meals arrive spaced oddly, either with apps or a long long time after. I've had to practically send up a flare to get a dessert order in. And the consistent irritation is getting hold of my check. That has ended twice with us getting up and asking the hostess to have our server bring it to the front. The one good thing I can say is that my party has never been rushed out so the table could be turned over. Which can happen a lot particularly during peak hours."
P.J. N.,"Norman, OK",0,1,,5.0,5/3/2015,"We just had our sons rehearsal dinner at the BJ's in Westlake Village, CA. Our experience was excellent! The area for our group was set up when we arrived. The manager, Steven, was ready to set us up with waiters and waitresses.  These guys were quick to get drinks served and the Buffet going with our food. They were good to keep the Buffet filled. The Cesar Salad was demolished, pizzas were very tasty. The Chicken Alfredo was pretty good but not a favorite of our group. When guest ordered Pazookies that took awhile because of everyone's customize order. But while waiting all enjoyed visiting with one another. Everyone's order was perfect!  We had 45 quest and everyone had a wonderful time. Guest told us, as well as the management, how great the food was and what a wonderful job the waiter James had done. Management was quick to get our bill and work out the problem with my BJ's Reward card. Being from out of town to set up the rehearsal dinner I was nervous as to what to expect. This BJ's was excellent!! Thank you!!!!"
Courtney Y.,"San Jose, CA",442,308,59,2.0,1/5/2011,"It's BJ's and its in Thousand Oaks.. and it was eh.....  We came for a couple of drinks and was hoping to catch the Warriors game. Yeah, I'm from Nor Cal. Well the biggest bummer was the game couldn't be played. I guess BJ's doesn't have league pass... whatever... Secondly the bartenders weren't that friendly. We had to ask them to wipe the counter and he gave us this, ""I hate my job"" look and proceeded to wipe it down. We had enough drinks that night for me to forget if we ordered food. I think we got chicken wings.  Anyways its a BJ's its what you would probably expect, minus league pass."
Luke Y.,"Longmont, CO",309,22,1,4.0,1/2/2014,Such good brews and the pizzookie is to die for. I am a huge fan if the combo pizza but whatever you are looking for you will definitely be able to find it here
Richard R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",94,47,3,1.0,2/23/2011,"I've been going to BJs for over 10 years at many different locations. Their deep dish pizza is good, not great, but sometimes it fills a void. I don't drink but my friends love their beer selection, and everyone loves the pizookie for dessert.  My issue was that last night, we went in with a group of 5 people and one person got bad food poisoning. I called Rob the manager today to let him know, and without apologizing, asking if he was ok, or anything of the sort, he immediately starts defending the restaurant saying they inspect their products and nobody else has complained. I always love the ""nobody else has complained"" BS line. That's because not everyone reacts the same way to issues, some people don't like confrontation and some people are just too lazy to be bothered to complain. Does that make it ok that he had an issue last night? no. When I explained how annoyed I was with his response, he stared to back pedal. Still never got an apology and my friend has been miserable all day. Shocking."
Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",832,655,374,2.0,6/17/2011,"I was HONGRAY and needed food after a long graduation ceremony. We decided to go to every teenagers desire -BJ's. No pun intended.  I love BJ's and was excited for greasy food and beer.. However, the beer I desired was not available so I ordered a mojito instead - it was too sweet and not minty enough. Our waiter was kind enough to exchange it for a beer. The calzone I ordered was disappointing - It seemed to not have enough cheese and was more so stuffed with garlic and tomato sauce.  It was a whatever experience - I wouldn't come back. I've had better service and food at the BJ's in Woodland Hills."
Rob P.,"Los Angeles, CA",32,36,2,1.0,12/9/2013,"Went there for my bday because we had gift cards. Waitress never introduced herself, took 30 min to receive the food. The plate I ordered of chicken looked like a child's portion. I had to ask for forks and napkins. If you have to go here stick to pizza and hamburgers. These waitresses need more training."
