Erin K.,"Jacksonville, FL",88,24,13,4.0,10/29/2013,BJ's is always nice love the beer sampler and the food is good too.
John B.,"Moorpark, CA",12,10,3,2.0,2/19/2014,"Would have easily given it 5 starts if it weren't for the horrible service. It sucks. Every other bjs I have been to has been really great! Except this one. I am typically a good tipper, but my most recent visit I was forced to tip less than 10%!! The waiter passed by us countless times and didn't bother acknowledging us one bit. We had to go up to the actual bar to get a refill on our drinks. I even asked him when he finally did make to our table if they were shirt staffed.  He said no and asked why I was asking. I love the food and beer here, but the service ALWAYS lacks at this location."
Adam E.,"Oak Park, CA",536,179,7,2.0,10/8/2011,"Well seeing that my reviews for huge chain restaurants hardly pass 3 stars, you may still like this place.  Food was very average and uninspiring. Most of the staff seem to have that ""Corporate soul sucked Syndrome"" look on their face.  I noticed the food compared to early mid 2000's has been cut back on size and flavor. I think that may have to do to the restaurant putting calories on the page and of course money. I prefer most of the food, beer, energy and staff at Lazy dog so I think I will just head back that way. If you need a quick fix to watch a game, feed the family or grab a beer then BJ's IS adequate."
Ansel R.,"Westlake Village, CA",43,12,,4.0,2/15/2014,"BJ's is a staple for any anyone looking to have nice draft beer and watch some games. The impressive multitude of televisions is the main differentiator, but the beer selection is actually pretty good and the food, while nothing amazing, does more than enough to compliment the other positives. Lots of seating means there isn't usually a wait except at peak times, and there are self-seating  tables right behind the bar in the perfect spot to watch the centerpiece television array. Staff is always friendly and pretty efficient, overall a quality place to go for families or with friends."
Christinna M.,"Westlake Village, CA",3,2,,1.0,12/28/2013,"I've been here several times and it's always the same story: extremely slow service but delicious food. My drink was too strong sent it back it took 8 mins to get a new one. We did call ahead got seated quickly but the server took his sweet time greeting us, taking our order and bringing out extras we asked for. The service is consistently slow and the servers are inattentive and nowhere to be seen when u need something. My advice: go to the  BJ's in woodland hills."
Caleb H.,"San Francisco, CA",1,4,1,2.0,9/27/2010,"Let me first start by clarifying that this review is not a reflection of the restaurant in general, but rather this specific location. The girlfriend and I eat at this location approx. once a month and while the food is always killer, service problems plague this location. Here's the experience from last night which, unfortunately, isn't that far off from normal: We arrived around 7:40pm, no reservation, and were seated in about 10 minutes (the only good thing about the evening). The restaurant was active, but definitely not full. Our server (I believe his name was Michael) took our drink/appetizer order. Shortly thereafter he returned with the drinks and left without a word. 15 minutes later, the server returned to the table to clarify our order before he entered it, which he had completely wrong. I understand the need to clarify orders from time to time, but to wait 15 minutes before even putting in the order to the kitchen? No way.  Fast forward 35 minutes: our food is delivered to the table, about 5 minutes after the appetizer. No apology for the wait, no explaination for delay, not even a ""can I get you another beer""?  I ended up speaking to the manager, who comp'd one of our entrees, which must have pissed off the server since, when boxing up our pizza, he flipped it upside down in the box (while making eye contact), messing the whole thing up.  I've resisted writing reviews before and have always chalked up the poor service to the server having a bad night and tried to be understanding (having worked in food service). But I honestly can't give this BJ's location more than 2 stars since good service is an integral part of the dining experience.  In summary: Love the food, but the skip this location unless you feel like being treated like a 2nd class customer."
Sunil R.,"San Francisco, CA",708,2322,12,3.0,12/12/2010,"Looks like this is the place to be on a Tuesday night in this area, it was packed and bustling with activity. The drinks were inexpensive and the food portions are huge. I forget what it is called but the gooey cookie dessert is so good and probably unhealthy it is a sin."
Kellen F.,"Berkeley, CA",49,88,6,3.0,7/16/2011,"You know, it's alright. It's BJs... I've been here multiple times and tried many of their beers. It's a great place to get a table and some pitchers with friends, but at the same time the 30-40-something singles-bar vibe is hard to shake from this place. The food is alright. Nothing special and all stuff you could pretty much do at home, but that involves doing dishes and buying ingredients. Three stars doesn't mean it's bad, it just isn't going to blow anyone away. Edit: be careful in large groups - I got overcharged when I split the bill and split the 18% tip, which was included in the total, but then was charged the tip again. The server made out like a bandit after lying to me about how it was supposed to work (not to mention that I only signed to pay 64, but was charged 75). The manager was very nice and quite responsive, but was ultimately only able to give me a gift card as I didn't have my receipt."
Marconi De M.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,454,5,4.0,6/30/2013,"Servers are clueless, but friendly... food is reliable and consistent and the variety allows you to return without being stucked in 3/4 options only... that's a major plus."
Jeff P.,"Los Angeles, CA",135,168,42,4.0,9/8/2010,"Review is for their Happy Hour: 3-7pm $1 off draft & well half of mini-pizzas $2 off appetizers I AM TELLING YOU NOW, you must stay in the bar area to get the happy hour deals! If there aren't any tables, keep waiting or else your server will not warn you and rip you off.   I got here a bit early and hit off the afternoon at the bar.  Rob (bartender) was very good at his job.  He got me a few samplers of the house beer to try (as I am not a regular at BJs).  Very nice gesture.  He served me up a few Chamays and well drinks (perfectly made might I add!!).  He was quick to the order and was very attentive throughout the happy hour.  That is how you bartend! Give this dude a star when his performance review comes up! Upon moving to the tables area, our server was not very friendly at all.  The dude just seemed like he was there just to do the bare minimum...take our order...serve us...and be done with it.  No service with a smile nowadays eh?  Moving on...GYOZA, Avocado rolls, chips & salsa, and a few other dishes were ordered.   The avocado rolls (and sauce) were deelicious.  The chips & salsa were portioned nicely so that hit the spot in helping me wash down the brews.  Gyoza was whatever...I make these at home, so I wasn't impressed.   I would really only come back here because of the great service received at the bar.  If I lived closer, I would swing by here more often.  Yardhouse will continue to be my local spot since there are no BJs in Pasadena."
Josh D.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,25,1,1.0,11/15/2013,I've never had a good meal here. The beer is ok. Everything is super over priced. Management sucks. I've sent or tried to send nearly every dish back because of bad or sh*tty the food looked. The pazookies are bomb
M R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,,5.0,12/28/2010,"The Salads are SUPERB!! The restaurant is SPACIOUS!! The Pazookie is GOOOD!! Please go to BJs and have yourself a decadent meal!!! This place is special, so happy its a chain restaurant!!"
Alex S.,"Encino, CA",0,8,,1.0,11/27/2013,"Terrible service in the restaurant and for carryout. They have repeatedly forgotten us on hold after we ask to make carryout orders. Tonight we drove in while waiting on hold for 20 minutes. We expected some sort of apology or awknowledgement of their poor service. When we walked in, three servers standing at the front ignored us. Then when we showed them the phone still on hold there was no apology. They just started blaming each other. One server named Cameron even though it was funny and picked up the phone and made some stupid joke about my I take your order. We won't be coming back to this restaurant ever."
Paul D.,"Folsom, CA",7,34,6,1.0,10/12/2014,"This place is horrible... Food is mediocre... service is worst I've ever seen! My Cali Flat Bread Pizza was extremely short on toppings and over cooked.  This visit took place during Sunday night football, and the place was hardly packed.  The waiter was on drugs obviously... we had the ask for every item we were served... and his production time was avg 15 minutes between trips to our table.  We had to ask the store mgr for a waiter in the first place.  Now the Store Mgr... middle aged Asian guy... Have us sass and talked back when we asked for a waiter... and then we had to track him down so we could pay... cause our absent minded waiter was off in la la land.  When we handed him our divided bill he talked back cause it wasn't divided how he wanted.  Look, all a restaurant has is service... If you can't provide that... It may be time to kick some tires and light some fires! Will never return to Thousand Oaks BJs..."
Sea K.,"Simi Valley, CA",52,135,38,4.0,5/12/2011,"I've been coming to this B.J's for years and never had a bad experience (lucky me ) I love their Cajun chicken pasta and their Jambalaya is deliciously tempting, it's hard for me not to order this again and again. Their Ahi Poke appetiser is the BEST I've ever had! their Berry Burst Cider is the best I've ever had too! HOWEVER be ware that their ""happy hour"" specials won't make you ""happy"" at all, best to go to Fridays if you want to enjoy a good ""Hapy Hour"" and not break the bank."
Matt M.,"Agoura Hills, CA",21,11,,1.0,10/14/2013,"i brought my family for dinner here last night. We've been here previously a few times and have been pleased. However, the whole experience last night was bad. We got a table after about 15 minutes waiting. We sat down and our server came by a few minutes later. He was very nice and talkative. Since I had my wife and two kids with me I decided to place our entire order with our drink order. We waited for over 15 minutes to get our drinks (iced teas/water.) About 20 minutes after that the food slowly started to arrive. We finished the 1st course of our meal and continued to wait. Our server never came by to check on us or re-fill out beverages. Our pizza was finally brought out my someone else. After eating our pizza, we still couldnt find our server to  put our pizzoki order in for us which came with our dinner. He should have been aware of this since it takes like 20 minutes to bake it.  My wife finally complained to the hostess to get a manager. That took another 10 minutes to get her attention to our table. The manager comes over offers an apology and says I will get your bill, a box for your leftovers, and your dessert. The server whom I had'nt seen in ages comes by and apologizes saying they are really busy. They were busy but it he I also noticed him socializing with several other tables in the restaurant. If he were that busy he should'nt have time to do that! My wife eventually had to take our kids to the car after an hour and half being there and it would have been longer if we had'nt said anything. The manager didnt even offer to comp our drinks which was never re-filled once. Disappointed to say the least. I am normally not the type to complain but this experience was terrible. I am on the fence if I even want to come back here. The food was good but the service overall was really really poor. :("
George A.,"Alamogordo, NM",1,32,1,1.0,7/25/2011,"Not sure about the food - the inefficient staff chased me off. I was in Thousand Oaks for a class and was looking for a good place for dinner.  One of my friends recommended BJ's and described the extensive menu.  I was sure that I could find something that appealed to me.  I can't tell you much about the menu, but I can tell you a story about an hour of my life that I'll never get back. My co-worker and I put our name on the list and were told that ""it'll be about 15 minutes,"" so we sat and looked around.  Several large groups came in and were seated.  I went to the host station, and was told ""There's only a couple of names ahead of yours, it should only be fifteen minutes,"" so I went back and waited. Maybe they have a thing against Hawaiian shirts.  Maybe I didn't look like typical customer.  Maybe they just didn't dig my vibe.  I don't know.  After about an hour, I'd had enough. Ridiculous wait."
Stefani S.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,8,,2.0,7/5/2014,"BJ's has been my boyfriend and I's favorite restaurant for the past two years, but as time has gone by, we have realized that it is solely for the food quality.  Their food is phenomenal, but tonight confirmed that we need to start going somewhere else. Out of the countless times we have been to this location, there have been maybe three good experiences with regards to service.  Both my boyfriend and I have been serving tables for about three years now, so we are not clueless people who do not understand server struggles like being very busy or making a little mistake.  The service at this BJ's is absolutely TERRIBLE nine times out of ten.  Our first experience that really threw us off was with a girl server.  We did not get greeted for over 20 minutes, but as servers we tried to be patient and understanding and just let it go.  We told her our drink order but she did not let us get to our food order, then had us waiting for our drinks for over 10 minutes.  When she finally brought them, she turned around immediately and it took her 15 minutes to come back and get our food order that we already knew since the moment we sat down.  After we got our food, she did not check on us even once.  The next time we saw her was about 20 minutes after we finished eating when she dropped the check and turned around.  Again, just terrible. Tonight, we had another terrible experience.  We went in for pizookies only, and were there for an hour and a half.  We waited for 10 minutes to be greeted, and our drinks took 15.  Luckily, we got our pizookie order in with the drinks, and asked our server to please make them undercooked.  However, the pizookies took 25 minutes.  When we got them, my boyfriend's was crunchy like a cracker.  We immediately got his attention and he apologized and went to get a new one.  After about 10 minutes (I was already done with mine), my boyfriend got another that was slightly overcooked, but he was not wanting to make another problem so he just tried to eat it.  It was white chocolate macadamia nut, not peanut butter like he ordered.  At this point it was almost funny.  We got it replaced again, and the pizookie came out slightly overcooked again.  He ate it even though it was not even close to what he wanted.  The one pizookie was taken off the bill, but never did the manager come to talk to us, let alone take care of the rest of the bill which I think would be absolutely necessary in this terrible of a situation. Anyway, we are tired of the service at this BJ's location and do not plan on returning.  The two stars are only given because the food is great... so good job to the BJ's cooks...?"
Rahul A.,"Westlake Village, CA",17,15,4,1.0,2/6/2014,"Service is brutally slow tonight.  Ordered a glass of wine 25 minutes ago, still no wine, no water, no silverware.  The waiter was talking to his friend holding our appetizers.  Won't be coming here for a while.  Even though the food is above average, the service was just too slow."
Janice B.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,2,,5.0,2/6/2015,"I have been here a bunch.  All i have to say is if you want great service at the bar or dining find shane.  He is upbeat, social and,  very attentive.  My husband and I found ourselves there after saying ""never again"", we were wrong.  This young man made our experience here fun and enjoyable.  The food was great for us and the drinks were strong and on point!  We wanted for not.  Whatever we needed was taken care of. . The TV is a selling point!  Multiple games of any sport are on and if the crowd deems a game more important you get the bigger screen.  The only negative i have was that our server seemed to be apologizing for our food taking a bit long.  However, it was a Friday night and his attitude and care made it enjoyable.  I will be back."
