Stuart M.,"Westlake Village, CA",1,40,1,2.0,10/20/2012,Not sure what happened here.  They were great when they opened but each time we've been we get more and more disappointed.  The last time we went the food took an hour to come out and the service was extremely poor.  Normally I wouldn't post a negative review unless the circumstances occurred over a period of time.  The level of service has deteriorated over the last year and a half.  We'll take a break and see how they are doing in a year.
Matt B.,"Castaic, CA",0,12,,1.0,12/7/2012,"I'm usually a fan of BJs and their chains but this one is horrible.  I gave it a second chance and I'm sorry I did.  After the hostess sat us at a crumby (literally) table... My dad and I had to clean it ourselves... the hostess wasn't bright enough to just move us to another one of the open tables and have the bus boy clean that one again.  Then after waiting for over 10 minutes, without any waiters attention, someone was seated right next to us and had service within a minute.   Our first trip there was several months ago.  The service then was slow and similarly inattentive.  The food was ready on time I'm sure but it was cool when it was finally delivered after a barely excusable delay. Two trips in a row with the same bad experience and no manager to be seen... maybe their staff just doesn't care when the manager isn't around.  Or maybe the manager doesn't care.  If I ran a restaurant and had waiters and waitresses texting on their phones as paying customers waited without any service I'd be looking at getting new waiters and waitresses."
Staci F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",35,141,,1.0,7/30/2012,"Gross food, High calories, bad service! they give you half the amount of food when you order to go. Stay away unless you want a good beer. Thats all thats good there."
D T.,"Simi Valley, CA",6,34,,2.0,8/26/2012,"Went to BJ's Restaurant last night and the food was awesome but the service was complete CRAP! Took 20 minutes to just get our drinks. Our server had to go on break so he switched out with another server...he was even worse! The place wasn't even full. The table next to us also was having trouble with their waitress, ended up requesting the manager to come over. Don't think it's worth the money. Wouldn't mind paying if the service would step it up a notch. Our ""cocktails"" tasted like ""virgin"" drinks and they were 10 bucks a piece :("
Laurie N.,"Simi Valley, CA",291,224,95,4.0,1/27/2013,The food here is always good!  I had the mahi mahi for dinner and it was amazing.  They now also serve mini pizookies!  Great if you want to split with another and just want a few bites.  Perfect!
Karen Z.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",8,19,,5.0,10/28/2014,"Came here for a late bite after seeing a movie with a friend and had the most pleasant bartender, Kevin! He never let my diet coke get less than half empty and was very friendly and professional, even though it was almost closing time. He gave us exceptional service and after I complimented him and thanked him for such great service, I learned it was his first night behind the bar! This is what led me to write this review! I have been here several times, mainly because its the only place open this late in town, but tonight it was noteworthy! I had a mini pizza for $6 on the happy hour menu and got to pick any items I wanted all for the same price! Also had the buffalo wings, and avocado egg rolls. All very good! It was definitely Kevin who made my friend and my experience such a great one! Also, I told the manager, Kyle, on our way out about the great bartender he had and he agreed and said very nice things about him as well. It's so nice to see a manager appreciate and acknowledge when they have good employees and give them there due respect! I've been in the industry for a thousand years and it's very rare to experience management that truly cares and takes the time to listen to a an employee compliment and be in agreement. Thank you Kevin and Kyle for a great ending to our evening! Went home very satisfied and with leftovers too! We'll be back soon!!"
Ben S.,"Parker, CO",9,102,19,4.0,6/3/2012,Great white pizza = yummy! I almost always go with their California burger. Just love it! The toasted sourdough bun is just the way I like it. My wife goes cookoo for their Jambalaya! Can't forget the Pazookie! Delicious!
Dana H.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,8,2,1.0,12/10/2014,We went to lunch here last week and it was a disaster. Every order was wrong. They kept us waiting half an hour before we even got drinks and the waiter as well as manager seemed confused and were not apologetic. We also noticed other tables having the same problems. When food finally came it was half cold/half burned and disgusting. We will not be returning.
David A.,"Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA",0,29,3,4.0,8/1/2013,"3.5 stars Went for a quick bite after some car shopping for my younger son. It was after the lunch rush and mostly empty. The service was fine, average, not bad but not stellar. The food was good as usual but it took about 15 mins for my beer to be delivered after ordering. In fact the appetizer came out first which was surprising given the lack of patrons at the time. Son's food came out wrong,  (server rang it in wrong) and we mentioned to Michelle the supervisor who was extremely good at her position. She offered him a pizookie which went a long way with him! As a server myself, I try to be impartial and understanding, knowing that every place has a bad moment now and then. So I was a little disappointed but not enough to not return. So overall, I'd go with 3.5 stars, but lean higher because of the excellent supervisor."
Robert Z.,"Washingtonville, NY",0,26,4,4.0,10/17/2014,"I had a very enjoyable lunch here.  I was by myself so I sat at the bar but the service and attention there was very good.  Quick cold beer, yum.  HOT mozzarella sticks, yum. Glazed pork chop, yum.  The food items are common to most franchise ""friendly"" restaurants but these guys did a very good job.  Very satisfied."
Audrey R.,"Westlake Village, CA",22,14,,3.0,7/11/2013,"Sometimes this place makes me mad. Other times its alight. It seems like we have better luck when we dine-in. Most of the time we get decent service, then sometimes you just don't. I don't recommend take out because they have never really gotten our whole order right. They take forever. I was once told it would be 15 minutes and it turned out to be 45. It's always something like that.  I wouldn't bother to post this if it wasn't every time. Anyway, just dine-in and 75% of the time they'll get it right."
Ric P.,"Oak Park, CA",95,268,116,2.0,1/31/2010,"We have tried over & over again here, and it just ain't workin for us. Every single time, there is always a problem.  Also we have notice that the staff dose not even have a smile on them.  Can you say, internal Management issues !!!"
Leeza P.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1,13,,2.0,3/27/2014,"So I was just at this location and I'm extremely disappointed with my experience. Having worked in a customer service position, I know how to treat customers and the way this manager treated me was not right. Not only was he rude, but he was extremely condescending and was very unwilling to accommodate us. There are upwards of ten TVs playing a UCLA game, while we wanted to watch another game. I realize we live in Los Angeles, but I would think that a franchise who wants to appeal to a large audience would be a tiny bit more accommodating. Let's put their mediocre food and not so great service aside - I love coming to BJ's to watch a game. But now, knowing that this manager is working there, I am so unwilling to return. We weren't the only ones complaining: another party wanted to watch the same game and he said, and I quote, ""just relax, it's basketball"". If that's the case, then change the channel on ONE TV. Regardless of this game or this whole situation, the customer service at this location is abysmal. If you are looking for a really accommodating staff, go to Stone Fire or even better, Taco Bell down the road."
Todd O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",134,510,49,3.0,1/31/2012,I wanted to do 2 stars but they comped and replaced our cold calamari so the mgt was on it even if no one else was.  I really really wish I remember our server's name so everyone could request not to sit in her section.  Our whole experience was overshadowed by her fake friendly and semi rude service.  We did get luck when she went on break but then had to close out with her.  Its crazy for me to type I wish we went to Oxnard but that is how I feel.  We've been to the Oxnard BJs countless time and it is truly a better experience.  Not feeling the brand consistency with BJs!
Linda B.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,2,,4.0,11/6/2013,Had a great experience! My waitress was great! She was very young and quite polite I was surprised on the customer service for the staff all had smiles walking around the restaurant! Great to see! The food was tasty I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and it was YUMMMMY! I definitely suggest coming here for late night dinner or for a nice night out with some friends or family! Love it!
Steve R.,"Westlake Village, CA",23,399,217,3.0,8/29/2010,"3 stars for A-OK. Sort of like fast food in a nicer setting than a fast food restaurant. Like Chilis, BJs serves constant mediocre food. OK for a medium priced meal. Hard to review a place like this. It is what it is."
Ashley G.,"Woodland Hills, CA",2,20,2,3.0,1/8/2015,"unfortunately, this is one of those places that 98% of the time, I do not get good customer service. Either the food takes forever, I don't get my stater salad out first, the server doesn't come back to check up on us at all, or we don't get greeted for 10 minutes. Something is most likely to happen every time I come. Don't get me wrong, I'm a server as well. I understand when food takes awhile because it is crowded, or the chefs are just taking their time. I completely get that. But make your tables aware of it at the time instead of just telling them what's going on. And I do believe that even though there are expos at this location, that the servers should also check up on their food and bring it at, especially when the salad comes out after the meal when they know it's a starter. I have had some really great servers here, but rarely. I do believe that the customer service could be worked on a bit. But I always still come back because of the desserts!"
Rachel F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,175,4,2.0,2/20/2012,Service is terrible. I will say it again the service is the worst i have ever seen. 2 hours for salads for my group of 9. It was embarrassing and the waitress was not even apologetic. We will not be coming back with a group anytime soon that is for sure.
Darnelle B.,"Palm Desert, CA",321,201,27,3.0,7/19/2012,"The food was awesome... Though they were out of the stuffed mushrooms and the server was unaware.  In fact she was unaware of how the rewards program worked either.. Or giving people silverware after taking yours.. Oh and unaware of asking if you wanted another drink/refill.  Unaware that you should check back with your tables to see if everything is okay. Unaware that you should present the right check... She was very aware of the next table though.. 2 men or 2 women... Hmmm . Both of us have been in the business and know what basic service is.. We barely got that! She was an order taker with no knowledge of the menu! I've been eating at bjs since I was in high school and have never had service like this... Oh ..the bathrooms.. The first stall had no toilet paper.  The second stall  had no seat covers and the third was JUST right!!  Trash can overflowing to the point where you couldn't push it down any further..  What happened here? They used to really take pride in every aspect of the restaurant, now it seems like it is Im taken for granted."
Lori P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,7,,2.0,4/26/2012,"Great pizza, but very poor salads. They skimp on everything in the salad. Even the quality of lettuce isn't good."
