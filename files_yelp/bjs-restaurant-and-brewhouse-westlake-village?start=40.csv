Michael A.,"Westlake Village, CA",1244,768,2667,4.0,4/1/2016,"BJ's gets 4 stars overall, though their service is probably more deserving of 3 stars. Came here today for lunch and ordered the soup-salad lunch combo, which includes bottomless soup and salad.  Awesome, except that it took 35 minutes to get my first bowl of soup and salad. After that, service picked up, however, and the waiter seemed sincere about apologizing for the delay. The food itself was decent. The clam chowder was good, but not the best in the area by any means. The salad seemed fresh, and tasted pretty standard. What's really awesome about this place is their home brewed beers, drinks, and desserts. Their famous pizookie lives up to the hype, and is a must-try item when coming here. Their beers are delicious and they offer some pretty cool cocktail choices, as well. Their chocolate ale ice cream float looked good, and I think I'll give that a try next time I go. Unfortunately, I would not really recommend their pizzas. Though deep dish, I'm never really happy with the taste. Below average in my book; their pizza gets 3 stars from me. Their food menu does have a lot to offer, their bar area is sizable, and they have a bunch of TVs constantly playing sports, making this a great place for happy hour, and for watching games. If you have kids, they do have a pretty solid kids menu, and they brew their own root beer and cream sodas. The root beer here tastes amazing. Give this place a try. The menu is big, and you're bound to find something that catches your eye. They have sashimi-grade ahi tuna that I've been dying to try. Prices are reasonable."
Anthony G.,"Moorpark, CA",0,13,,1.0,9/16/2017,"If you want to be ""served"" by millennials who don't want to work and don't attend to their customers, BJs has you covered."
Andrea K.,"Oak Park, CA",0,12,,1.0,9/26/2017,"Yikes!  We used to come to BJ's all the time. Now I know why we don't anymore!  Last Saturday night, four of us took a table in the bar.  The ""waiter"" (some sweaty dude named Shane) breezed by our table and said ""I am the only one working the bar, so I have no idea when I will get to you"".  No hello, no greeting.  We had no choice but to laugh after be stormed away. Eventually we got a nice waitress (name was Tiana??).  Sadly, two of us made the mistake of ordering the BBQ chicken salad.  OMG.  Huge, slimy, fatty chunks of dark meat chicken.  We were so grossed out, we wasted at least half of the salads, after removing the inedible chicken. The downhill slide continues for BJ's in Westlake.  And that is a shame...."
AC 8.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",7,24,1,2.0,1/1/2017,I continue to be disappointed and let down by this place.  Every time I leave I say I'm not going back and then give it another try and am disappointed again.  More times than not the food comes out wrong it has to be sent back because it's cold. Today the brisket burger featured a burger well done+ and brisket and bbq sauce that was cold and cheese unmelted.   My wife's meal was also horrible.  I sent back the burger and after 25 minutes of waiting for its return we walked out. The place was not empty so no excuses that it was busy.  The kitchen and management is so poor I have no idea how they stay in business. Ok for real This time....I'm not going back.
Alex K.,"Flagstaff, AZ",4,2,,1.0,6/22/2017,"I love this place, so it kills me to leave this review. I came here last night with my mother. I ordered a deep dish pizza, which was delicious. I ended up eating half of it, and taking the rest home in a box because I was so full. When I ate it the next day for lunch, I bit something very hard and unpleasant that was in my pizza. I spit it out, and it appeared to be a shard of porcelain, or perhaps some other similar material. It was very sharp too, I could have been seriously injured. You guys need to do some serious quality control. This is just unacceptable."
Mary R.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,35,,3.0,8/19/2017,Food is ok. Service ok. Takes awhile for food to get to the table even when it is slow. Not a good thing when you are in a hurry like we were. I needed to get my food boxed to take home. Our server was pleasant and I felt bad for him because there wasn't much he could do about it.
Bradley P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",4,77,,4.0,8/30/2017,"Came here a few times, last time had the brisket bacon burger and avocado rolls and water... never charged for water like one of the review here. Our wait time wasn't that long either, was very happy overall. My kids had a pizza and they loved it, so we will keep coming back to enjoy the guilty pleasures of what they offer"
Tracy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,2,1.0,8/29/2017,Terrible service and bad food. There are seemingly dozens of waiters dressed in all black and half of them are talking in groups and doing nothing. Bad experience today at happy hour. Waited forever for our food. No one refilled our waters. Send my dressing drenched salad back to be remade. It didn't come back at all until I finally asked for it. Happy hour burger was tiny. I've been to much better BJ's with far superior service and food. Something here is amiss. Poorly run and overstaffed. Screams inefficiency. Corporate should have their eyes on this one.
Kelly F.,"Camarillo, CA",284,235,762,2.0,5/30/2016,Very disappointed that they changed their happy hour :( I can't really review it at this time because we decided to leave and go to another restaurant.
Amy D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",7,30,8,2.0,6/28/2017,The service here is atrocious. The servers are too busy on their cell phones and gossiping with each other about drugs. No class whatsoever in this place. The drinks are watered down and poorly made. The 2 stars is for the dishwashers and cooks because my food was good and dishes clean.
Julie A.,"Oak Park, CA",4,25,,2.0,12/6/2016,"We have had several bad meals at this restaurant but have returned in hopes that the service had improved.  Well we were wrong.  The service was awful.  Clearly the restaurant was out of sync. Took Close to 20 minutes to be served water. Our server, while nice enough, seemed distracted and for the most part inattentive.  We had to ask for everything. Our food was not served for over an hour and then it didn't even come at the same time.  The total time at the restaurant was 2 hours and less than 40 of that was us eating.   Will we go back again in hopes that we finally have a good experience?  Probably but only because we have points to use.   As an FYI we have also ordered take out from the restaurant three times and not once has the experience been close to good.  We did give up on take out last year.  I wish the management would put in the effort to get this place working more efficiently.  Maybe they only care about the bar as it probably pulls in the bulk of their income but I know that if we don't get better service the next time we visit it will definitely be our last."
Julie K.,"Marina del Rey, CA",988,590,41,2.0,12/19/2016,"I went with my dad on Sat around 3pm for lunch- i ordered the xmas special which was steak (medium well) with a veggie and baked potato and  dad had the ribeye - Pittsburgh rare steak (is one that has been heated to a very high temperature very quickly, so it is charred on the outside but still rare or raw on ...) my father did not like his steak and they did not cook his steak how he wanted it .. i thought the quality of the steak was meh.. i think there are better places for steak.. perhaps i should get a burger next time .. waiter was fine - the hosts where ok.. wonder what this place is known for?"
The Denius J.,"Anaheim, CA",7,120,6,1.0,10/21/2017,"I'm not from around here but I thought that a BJ's was solid place to go to for good food and decent service. We sat down at about midnight and there were very few customers. There were more employees walking around than actual patrons. Our server was Bobby. My fiend's has a different opinion of him but I thought that he appeared overwhelmed with the three tables he was helping. One of my friends ordered a queso dip with chips as an appetizer. Almost 30 minutes later, Bobby comes out and says that they're out of queso. I fell out of my chair laughing. It took the team of kitchen staff and servers 30 minutes to realize that they were out of queso dip. I was laughing because I was getting that feeling that service was going to be hard to come by tonight. Long story short, our food came out an hour after we sat down. During that hour, we had nothing but our drinks given to us. We spoke with manager MONICA, whose attitude was such that this was not her fault. She was asked if this was her store and she said yes. She agreed that it should not have taken an hour for the food to come out especially when there are only three tables occupied and there was a bounty of employees just standing around. Her response was that she would ""talk to the kitchen staff."" The unapologetic nature of Monica leads me to believe that training from top down at this location is completely inadequate. Our concern walking in at midnight was that it was close to closing and that would lead to poor service or receiving low quality food. We unfortunately got both. The one decent thing Monica did was comp our meal. I don't know if you've ever eaten a meal while angry but whatever you eat tastes bad. If I had to pay for that meal I would never go back to a BJ's ever again and strongly dissuade everyone I know from going there. I typically like the food here. Sadly, people like Bobby and Monica made me hate it for at least the time that I was there. I don't know if Monica is cut out for a managerial position. She definitely hurts the company and it's reputation."
Mw L.,"Simi Valley, CA",1,14,,1.0,12/6/2016,"1. We were seated at 1201, at 1205 another couple was seated At 1210 they were served, at 1215 we still were not even acknowledged We walked out to the front desk, told them we were leaving and why, the guy didnt say a word, nor seemed to care We come here quite a bit considering we have to drive 20-25 minutes! 2. Your mobile app and web site should have a comments ability, i searched and just found an email address and a basic comments section in a deep search of the web site, emailed now 3 times, submitted comments twice, 5 days later, still no response. Sincerely and extremely disappointed that BJ's doesnt care"
Gary M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,23,,3.0,1/27/2017,"Lunch today. Service was okay but not very fast. Food was good but I don't understand why they have so much trouble refilling the coffee. You have to ASK for a refill and then they bring a whole new cup. Takes forever. I asked why it took so long and was told ""we don't have a coffee pot "" They make each cup individually instead of just coming around with a pot. It took 15min to get a refill. Must have been some MBA at corporate who thought that system up."
Skylar R.,"Simi Valley, CA",66,7,1,1.0,6/18/2017,"Worst restaurant service ever...we were there at 9:00 pm on a Sunday night and about a quarter of the restaurant was filled but we still waited two hours to completely finish our meal. BJ's used to be efficient but they have gone downhill in the last few years. Our waiter came to our table a total of three times: once for drink orders, once for food orders, and once for the check. We had empty glasses on our table for the whole last hour and they were never filled. I am sad a good place like this has become this disappointing."
Simone M.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,94,364,2.0,5/27/2016,"CURIOUS as to why there have been no reviews posted since 2013?  Is my phone app reading me wrong? 64 unpublished reviews are mostly 2-star  yet this establishment is always busy.  It must be that they are on a major corner of two high schools, well-known name in neighborhood, and off a convenient freeway exit  -- that they keep getting the crowds.  But why no recent reviews? Since I am one of the original reviews posted here I will update and see if it posts.  We like the free seating in the large bar area. The service is consistently good here.  You can see the TV's; but you can't hear them.  There is a loud din in the restaurant.  No music playing so voices (and children's cries) seem to carry.  But since it is such a large restaurant, the server has to go clear back to the bar or kitchen for refills, etc... The menu is vast and constantly changing  aside from pizza.  Vegetarian options are becoming more available. I have tried the deep fried artichoke hearts (kind of desperate that night... Lol) and they were too salty.  The spinach stuffed mushrooms were good.  No true vegan if you ask me...  Side note:  I'm so concerned about all the steps up and down out of the different levels with no hand rails. Makes me concerned for the older folks who come here.  Also there is a very tricky curb right in front of handicap parking which someone could trip on while getting into their car easily.  So let's see if my review gets posted..."
Javier G.,"Agoura Hills, CA",184,16,,5.0,8/8/2017,This is my place for Wednesday nights. BJs has the 4 dollar house craft beers and you can't beat it. Jeremiah Red is my personal favorite. Our server Beck was awesome and attentive and took care of us. Always have a great time and experience when I come here!
Lisa C.,"La Grange, KY",93,6,,4.0,8/7/2017,Love the food. Tuna poke' and stuffed mushrooms are 2 of my faves. Also love the ahi tuna salad. Portions are huge for the price.
Jo M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,177,,3.0,12/28/2016,"This is a solid three stars. Service is good or bad depending on who you get; I've had great and not so great. The thing I don't love about this location is how they try to seat parties of two by all the big hectic group tables where it's noisy and busy. Usually two tops are in a quieter spot, not right next to large parties. However they're usually pretty accommodating about other seating.  Dishes are hit and miss. Guacamole, meh. Salsa with chips is terrible--and this is same salsa on other Mexican dishes. Canned flavor. Brussels sprouts appetizer, meh. Pizza is ok if you like deep dish. I wish they had more healthy and light options. Even their healthy and lighter options feel heavy. You can't go wrong with pizookies, tho. They save the end of every meal and I'd imagine end most meals on a high note."
