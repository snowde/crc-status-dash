David C.,"Lake Forest, CA",138,57,33,4.0,8/13/2012,"I think this BJs is pretty good overall.  I know some people don't like chain restaurants, but I am fine with them.  I almost always enjoy the food.  The place is usually fairly clean.  Probably the only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that the wait can be quite long and the service could be better.  Usually the servers are nice enough, just that I think the restaurant overwhelms them so the table is not checked on.  It is also a pet peeve of mine to have the appetizers and main entrees all come at the same time.  Happens a lot here though.  With that said, pretty good overall."
Micki H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",143,45,22,5.0,2/2/2010,My husband and I have been trying to eat healthy lately and we found that BJs has the nutritional info for each meal in the back of the menu AND they offer 1/2 portions of many of their dinner entrees.  We are able to stay on our diets and eat a delicious dinner in a fun & trendy restaurant which makes us both so happy!!  That being said - the pazooki here is the BEST and the manager always comes by and says hi and asks how things are which is nice to see since it doesn't seem like you ever see a manager at most restaurants unless there is a problem.  BJs is our new favorite restaurant!! Oh!  ANNNNND...they do call ahead seating so we do that and our wait is only about 5-15 minutes usually.  Nice!
Victoria M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",932,468,310,2.0,8/19/2011,"Typical chain-restaurant style food.  When you're in the mood for a pizza and beer, this is the place to go... or so I thought.  Although I had been here many times before and never really overly impressed, we thought we'd go for pizza with some friends.  They were out of ""large"" size pizzas, whatever that means, and so we had to order 2 smalls.  We also ordered the cobb salad which, according to the menu is supposed to be a mix of romaine and iceberg lettuce.  The salad came with 100% iceberg lettuce, which I hate, and didn't look appetizing at all.  As head of the complaint department for the evening, I asked them to replace it with a new salad that somewhat resembled the menu's description.  The waitress was super friendly and apologetic for all of our troubles.  They were even nice enough to comp us for one of the pizzas, but then ""accidentally"" charged us for 2 salads!  I have to ask myself, ""Why do I keep coming here??"""
Ajay G.,"Spartanburg, SC",102,310,133,4.0,9/12/2009,"My dad's very fussy about where he eats out, including some pretty contradictory things like bundling a lot of add-on items into the entree and including unnecessary amounts of service at virtually no price with virtually no calories. Somehow we always build a list of about 20 places for going out, and eliminate all of them except BJ's as causing too much fuss from him. So I've gotten a lot of BJ's over the years, and have learned a few things from experience along the way. I say that we always go to BJ's, but oh, no... it's always this BJ's. The one in Woodland Hills didn't cook something the way he remembered, so now it's just this. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven't really noticed anything different about the BJ's locations, except that this one's always busy in the evenings and nights, more so than the others. The service is consistently great, and the interior's very tasteful, but that's held for all the other BJ's I've gotten in other places. The first big thing I've learned is just to skip the pizza. They make such a big deal about it, but they've got a very broad menu, and the pizza's the weak spot in it, regardless of the size. I got to like them a lot more after I started spreading to the rest of the menu. The second is that the microbrews are good, but not outstanding. I've had most, and none are bad, but they vary. I think I had the best experience with the porter. They have surprisingly good wings, too, so you might want to combine them with that. The third is that they'll surprise you with a few of the menu items which turn out a lot better than you expected. They seem like such a sandwich place, but probably the best I've had as far as it concerns BJ's involved some solid noodles -- the grilled chicken pasta, or equivalently good, the blackened chicken pasta. Most recently, I had two surprisingly good -- and large -- fish tacos. My sister, who's a pretty reliable judge of taste, was similarly impressed by the shrimp tacos. The stuffed baked potatoes are also enormous, but I've never tasted those giant spuds. Lastly, the highly-touted Pizookie is overrated, but does the job. I've tried all the Pizookies by now, and like the macadamia best but they all sort of taste the same. I didn't really get the appeal, but I think I wasn't really keeping it in the context of what it is. It's not love. It's not acceptance. It's not the meaning of life. It's not even chimi-cheesecake. It's a big, warm cookie, a la mode, served in a mini pizza pan. Keeping in mind that you're just tasting someone's nice warm cookies with cold cream on top, it's actually pretty good. The edges are the best part, though, so if everybody else is done, you might want to just grab the handles and dig your face right in."
Ashlee F.,"Moorpark, CA",131,3,1,1.0,1/20/2015,"Tonight was the third time i have visited b.j.'s in Westlake in hopes that the service would not be as terrible as the last two times. Unfortunately i experienced the worst restaurant experience i have ever had. Our server was clearly overwhelmed, and the fact that they were slow on this random Monday night did not help ease her pain. Our party of ten told her from the beginning that we were all going to want separate checks. We also informed her that we all work as servers and would help her out the best we could by not switching seats or over staying our welcome. Each drink we ordered took 20-30 minutes to get to our table. The food we ordered took 37 minutes (we timed it after the fiasco with the drinks) and when our food arrived cold, we asked to speak with the manager. Our server sent over Ron McBride, possibly the worst restaurant manager of all time. He asked us if our food was cold, or just not hot. We asked if it mattered and insisted he take it back and bring us a new dish. After much hesitation, he agreed. At the end of the meal, she brought us one check and asked us to put numbers next to what we ordered. We did, and handed out back to her. We waited over thirty minutes for her to bring our separated checks. When she did not, i approached the manager Ron McBride, explained the situation and asked for our checks. His immediate response was ""if you leave without paying you will be arrested"" i had not threatened to leave, only explained how long we had waited and how frustrated we had all become. I insisted he help our server so we could leave and he walked away from me. After another 20 minutes,i approached him again and asked about our checks, his response was an agitated ""i have not been rude to you, you will have to wait"" i insisted on the checks and told him we would be contacting the corporate office. Again, he walked away from me. The checks arrived shortly after that. There were drinks on our bills we had never received, and it took another ten minutes to have them removed. A couple sitting near us approached our table to tell us that they had arrived when we had first given our server the bill with the numbers separating our checks, and were now finished and leaving. They told us after the fiasco they had witnessed between us and the manager, Ron McBride, they would never return to the chain again. I would encourage everyone to think twice before entering this chain. Any company that would employ a restaurant manager this under qualified and ill equipped at dealing with customers is clearly not worthy of any person's time or money. I am very disappointed with this experience and would urge the company to take a closer look at their management team."
Wes S.,"Ventura, CA",1351,866,624,4.0,3/4/2008,"I have a lot of fond memories of this place. One of my jobs at the time used to throw a once a month social here with management and grunts a like. Food and alcohol was entirely paid on the company dime and wow, you would've thought they would stop doing that considering the amount of food and drinks people would just inhale. My favorite things to get here are their Chicago style pizza's and of course for dessert, a nice warm pizookie oozing with ice cream melting on top. My favorite beer is the hef, as I don't like darker amber beers. There's numerous tvs around, even in the patio, so, if you're in the mood to catch the game, this isn't such a bad spot. The best seat is at the bar with the numerous monitors there.  The wait does get crazy, so I would suggest to either call in a reservation or take your food to go. The lot also sucks as the numerous business' around have plenty of clientle as well."
Nicole T.,"NEWBURY PARK, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/19/2014,"So normally I would have given BJ's 5 stars- but the past couple times we have been there have been horrible! One time my friend's calzone was delivered uncooked and last time I got take out my calzone was cold and doughy (undercooked).  When we were there with a large party the waitress yelled at my friend!  Too bad they have messed so much up lately, otherwise it would have been a top choice."
Christopher B.,"Agoura Hills, CA",709,22,,5.0,10/1/2012,"The ambiance and energy in BJs in Westlake is great. Most importantly, their deep dish pizza is absolutely the BEST in the world. Light, & airy on the inside and crusty on the outside. Make it your way with tons of toppings. Excellent. Their burgers are also exceptional."
AnneMarie F.,"Simi Valley, CA",67,155,32,3.0,9/9/2011,"Jason W was our server, very personable and dorky cute. Loved him. We were seated quickly and our hostess was very friendly. The food is so so yummy. We got an appetizer platter with a bunch of different items, cheese sticks were amazing. We also got the fried artichoke which was the best thing I've ever eaten. Our drinks were pretty good too ( a something like that drink.... or whatever it was called, and one that was basically a pina colada with strawberry and I made it a double). The actual server like I said was very cute and made us feel welcomed and not annoyed at the fact that our drinks and food took FOREVER. We get it, sometimes you get busy, the bar gets backed up, it happens. It was annoying but because Jason W had personality and the food was so good overall we had a very enjoyable night!"
Donald H.,"Santa Rosa, CA",50,93,,1.0,8/6/2012,I order the pork ribs they were poor quality and not very cheap.  Salad and coffee were ok.
Arun C.,"Chatsworth, CA",6,9,1,4.0,10/5/2012,"Lunch for two on a Friday- good experience, will go back again. Service (5 stars)- We were seated quickly & received prompt service. Our waitress was attentive & frequently came by to ask if everything was okay & refill drinks. Food was served without a long wait Food (4 stars)- Lunch size portions can vary. The Southern Fried Chicken was filling but the three chicken tacos were pretty small. From a taste & quality perspective, the food was good."
Katrina G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",56,16,4,4.0,9/20/2012,"Had lunch with my handsome husband today and thoroughly enjoyed the food and service.  What a great place to eat!  Variety of food, drink, and fun.  I highly recommend you stop by and say hi to Doug, our waiter for the day."
Nicholas F.,"Agoura Hills, CA",140,18,,2.0,4/2/2014,Once we were seated the service was great. But while we were waiting to be seated it was a disaster.  We called ahead like 20 minutes and they said they put us on the list then when we get here we go up to the front and the gentlemen puts us down as if we didn't even call in and was cursing jokingly to another employee in front of us. Very uncomfortable so then while waiting we were watching people who arrived after us be seated before us with no reservations. They need to clean up their front waiting room customer service.
Clara C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",44,180,167,4.0,12/16/2009,"bj's is bj's.  the food is consistantly good, the portions are large and they can accomodate big parties.  don't expect them to split up bill though...they'll put it all on one tab, charge you an 18% gratuity and be done with it. of course we were a large party of obnoxious drunks the night we asked them to split the bill up. i've tried about 1/4 of the menu and have not been dissatisfied with anything yet.   burgers (the sliders are fantastic!), 1/2 baked potato with chix & broccoli, salmon, santa fe salad, italian chopped salad, hot meatloaf sandwich, hot pot roast sandwich, their huge nachos, the chocolate chip pizookie, served piping hot with ice cream...all very tasty.   the pizza is good but a little too doughy and thick for me, the chili is tasty but doesn't agree with my tummy so i stay away from it now. in the conejo valley it's hard to get away from chain restaurants and this one's a safe bet."
Eric T.,"Westlake Village, CA",37,52,,2.0,1/20/2012,"Good beer but amateur-hour service. The people who work here are more interested in chatting with each other about their boyfriends than in serving. But I guess they work here for just a few weeks and then move on, so what do they care? What particularly irked me was how, one time, a waitress at the bar where I was eating asked to be paid before I finished, because she was leaving her shift. Having once been a waiter, I know that's simply a scam, a way to get her tips without having to ask someone for them the next day. I decided to pay her as I figured, what's the difference? But then she continued to hang around talking to her friends for at least another half hour. But she's not the only bad example. The crowds here are generally treated as an annoyance; get 'em in, and get 'em out..."
Karen H.,"Moorpark, CA",1,18,9,2.0,8/17/2011,"This is just a friendly warning.  Food is ok, service ok, but watch your credit card.  We have twice had ours skimmed at this location and it's a huge hassle.  If you must use a credit card, follow the server and watch them swipe it.  Yes, you'll look and feel silly, but it's worth it."
Sam S.,"Agoura, CA",1,25,,4.0,4/28/2012,Just love the Hawaiian Mahi-mahi meal I had the other night.  Also had the clam chowder bowl and it was good.  Service was excellent and we had a nice time.  The waitress came by to check on us at least two times during our meal. Two weeks ago I had the BJ's Classic Combo Pizza.  Another great meal.
Alicia N.,"Sacramento, CA",92,28,1,3.0,2/22/2010,I agree that it's overpriced.  I don't agree with the common yelp opinion that large servings = bad restaurant.  That said. The turkey cobb sandwhich with the Jeremiah Red really does it for me. Not to mention that all of the desserts are great.
Cindy C.,"San Tan Valley, AZ",0,11,,1.0,3/23/2013,"Came here mostly for dessert but decided to get an appetizer and pizza before hand. Appetizers came out quick and were good. Pizza came out covered in tomatoes which we had ordered it without. Waitress gave us attitude and took the pizza away only to rerun minutes later with the same pizza and the tomatoes goes. I asked if she had just picked the tomatoes off which she replied she had. EW. No thank you. So then she gives us more attitude and says well it'll be another 25 minutes if we want a new one, so we ended up not getting any pizza. No apology, nothing. She acted like it was our fault. We definitely won't be back. Worst service ever."
Mary M.,"Simi Valley, CA",3,8,2,2.0,6/29/2013,"Went there to have a nice early dinner at 430PM.  The section we sat in had all of 3 tables occupied.  Our server said, I'm Sara, & I'll be taking care of you.  Other than bringing out 2 of our 4 meals, she NEVER once stopped at our table to see if things were ok.  She had only 3 tables, ours & one on either side of us, so obviously she had to walk past ours!!  NOT A WORD!!  My daughter had no soda to drink with her dinner!!  After telling the manager what happened, Sara got no tip.  Please have servers google ""TIPS""!!  She earned nothing & got the same.  I would go back, but would not want her to serve me."
