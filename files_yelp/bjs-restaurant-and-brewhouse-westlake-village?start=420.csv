Smush P.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,5.0,4/9/2013,"Dear Yelp Officianados, If you have the opportunity to visit this extraordinary pizza planet, definitely ask for Kobe. She may not have 5 NBA rings, but she is still a champion in my book. She was nothing but friendly, efficient, and beautiful. Just like Mr. Bryant is an efficient basket maker, so Kobe makes every trip to the table count. Kobe (not the beef but just as tender) suggested their seasonal mojito which was the ""bomb diggity"". Our food came out in a timely manner, and as an added bonus, it came on plates this time. Even though the kitchen forgot to put bacon on my pizza the first time around, she grabbed the offensive rebound and brought my bacon to the table, for the win. Kobe told us that bacon is the best and we agreed. Someone below said that Costco has better pizza. While that remains to be seen, the question begs to be asked: does Costco have Kobe? The answer is no my friends. So the next time you are choosing between Costco and Bjs (like the lovely people below) ask yourself this question: Ko-be or not Ko-be? Even though Kobe is not a 6 ft 6 basketball player, she has a tall standing with us! A quick shout out to all the people that made this Yelp review possible."
Bob B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,13,,4.0,9/13/2012,This is a good place. Good food and good service. Nothing to write home about but a great weekday option.
Katie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",892,411,31,4.0,7/6/2011,"Although very casual, i enjoyed this place. They have a healthy menu which is good for me and those out there trying to keep their girlish figure. The spring rolls with avacado make for a good appetizer as well as the hot wings. The jambalaya was seasoned well and the grilled chicken with veggies was good."
Christi C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",31,20,29,4.0,5/4/2011,"I've been here quite a few times for Lunch. The lunch prices are reasonable and the food is really filling, so even if you order the smaller lunch sized portion you'll probably still take some home. The menu is ginormous, it takes forever to skim through all the delicious choices, just when you think you've got it narrowed down, turn the page and boom there's something else you have your eye on! So the selection of food items is quite extensive compared to other restaurants. I've ordered the burger, the BBQ Chicken sandwich, and the Chicken Parm and they have all been delicious.   Our servers are always very attentive and friendly. My favorite drink is iced tea and they make a point to fill up my glass every time they walk by the table, because there's nothing I hate more than not getting adequate refills. One time I ordered a bottle of Cream Soda and they informed me they were out of the Cream Soda, so they brought my second choice, Black Cherry on the house.  The noise level is not so bad if you come in the afternoon...I assume it's much worse when there's a bigger crowd in the evening or a sports game on, but for us it's always been a pleasant Lunching spot. Most times we come here, we get a table right away, or within a few minutes. One night we came here for dinner and it was right around Westlake's Homecoming so there were big pre-dance dinner parties being held. We thought it would take forever to get in, but just as we walked up to ask about a table, a large group of teens came walking out the door and we were seated right away.  From burgers to sandwiches, salads to pastas, BJ's has something for everyone! And don't forget to save room for their famous Pizookie, which is a warm cookie baked in a pizza pan and served hot at your table with vanilla ice cream, sooooo good!"
Bob W.,"Westlake Village, CA",267,26,,1.0,6/9/2013,"My wife and I went to BJ's on Saturday night (5:00 pm) before a movie. My wife ordered some salmon dinner and I ordered a steak, with a dinner salad. My wife decided to add a salad also. The waitress brought the salad and we had to ask her to refill our water glasses. Soon, my steak was served and nothing for my wife. I finally got the server's attention and asked where my wife's dinner was? She replied,""I thought she was only having the salad."" We were running out of time for our movie, so we told her to cancel the order. The  steak was tough, the vegetables soggy, service stunk. Our server was not too bright. Never again!"
Sarah D.,"Los Angeles, CA",183,141,11,4.0,11/8/2008,"I've stop by this joint now and again, mostly because it's the *only* restaurant open past 9:45 p.m. in Thousand Oaks.  Seriously.  It has kind of a sports bar environment, which isn't really my thing...but, hey, it's open until 2. In any event, although it used to be a necessary evil, my visit last night was completely different.  They had really attentive waitstaff (all the way around--I watched other tables), great food, nice cold beer, and fast bussers.  Plus, everyone seemed pretty happy--which is a major plus for a place that busy.  In any event, whatever they changed over there is working.  Now, the naughty, naughty pizookie calling my name will be even harder to stay away from."
Nate S.,"San Francisco Peninsula, CA",27,50,,2.0,3/26/2011,"My wife and I have been to this location several times and have met friends and family there a few times as well. The food has been pretty  ok but the atmosphere has always been pretty good, relative to the area (suburban and quiet). The bar area has been pretty good for watching sports as well until I walked in the other day to watch some of the Sweet 16 teams in the NCAA tourney. In my opinion, these are pretty big sports events yet the management and staff refused to turn on the volume, opting for ""mood enhancing Kenny G"" musac that typical bar and grills play. I was literally told by the manager ""the game audio only comes on for important games"". This was a huge slap in the face considering I was dressed in fan gear of the team playing at that moment.  We walked out and went to Fox Sports Grill a couple miles away off Lindero Canyon Road. Fox Sports Grill has had a tepid atmosphere in the past but that day it was FAR better than BJs and will now be my sports dining and beverage consumption in the future.  I will probably patron BJs restaurants in the future but not THAT location."
Shleprock_of_food L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,151,37,4.0,10/10/2011,"I've been going here more and more and they've really improved.  I just don't order the pizza anymore.  There are plenty of other really good items on the menu now.  Why can't they make pizza here like any other BJ's?  Here it sucks, every other BJ's the pizza is really good.  The waitresses have really improved.  They're all very professional and attentive."
Michael R.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,43,1,1.0,1/12/2012,"First off, I used to eat here at least once a month & always loved the place regardless of the slow service. But a few months ago my girlfriend lost a very expensive diamond ring there & they refused to look for it. She vowed never to go there again but I decided to give them one more try. I have been sick for the past few days & didn't want to eat inside so I ordered the take-out. The clam chowder was like mucus, the mac n cheese had no cheese, the sliders were mushy, & the santa fe spring rolls were soggy. They also forgot to give me the dipping sauces & the side of ranch that I had asked for. So not 1 thing was right out of my order."
Steve P.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,1,,4.0,4/6/2014,"We just tried a couple of new items on the menu and were really pleased. They were even able to make my wife's favorite BBQ beef sandwich which had recently been taken off the menu.  Audrey our server, was great, really friendly and helped with the BBQ beef sandwich, making it a special meal."
Christian D.,"Westlake Village, CA",1,4,,2.0,6/10/2012,"Lots of potential, missing in execution.  i believe most places deserve a second chance. I just won't be going here again in awhile.  i ate here with some family and friends for the Kings game 3 the other night, and the overall experience didn't garner an overall applause when we left. The Kings did great and the gigantic 10' x 10' screen was fantastic for sporting events and the crowd, as well, were all good natured people.  But the service definitely needs assistance and more experience, the bar while wide spread in its draught beers, was severely lacking authenticity and taste with its 'unionized' cocktails.  the layout is spacious and inviting, i liked the floor design. so all in all its a two star restaurant, with certainly four star potential. I'll go back at some point to give it another go, but might not be for awhile."
KaSushi M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,1.0,6/3/2012,"If I could give a no-star rating, this BJ's would be the honorary recipient. This restaurant consistently gives the worst service available in Ventura County (and before I get cast as a BJ's antagonist, I have been to the Oxnard location several times and had a great experience every time). I have been here more times than I'd care to admit, and on a select few occasions I've gotten to deal with humans who have personalities (Michelle, a former bartender, is awesome and deserves to be back at the bar, btw). That said, this place is astonishingly consistent at making sure you feel like you're intruding on employees' chat time.  Several friends and I went there last night after summarily running out of ideas in a night-life-deficient place like Thousand Oaks, and upon WALKING IN, we were already being ignored. 3 separate employees walked by us at different times and asked if we had been helped, and when we said, ""not yet"", all three walked away like there was some pressing issue in a half-empty BJ's at 10:40 on a Saturday they had to take care of before someone could give us one of the 20 or so empty booths. First guy comes back to seat us after an awkward few minutes up front, and we're finally seated.  We order drinks first (and in fairness, our waiter wasn't rude, condescending, or flagrantly uninterested as has often been the case in the past) and we get them pretty quickly. Unfortunately, this was the only thing they got right.  We walked in at 10:40, got our drinks at 10:50, and ordered food around 10:55. Not all of us were hungry, so our whole table only wanted an order of potato skins and an order of guacamole eggroll-type things. You would think this would be no problem, but we didn't receive the food till about 11:30. A half an hour after we ordered 2 appetizers, we get the eggrolls, which my friend said were okay. The potato skins, on the other hand, were DISGUSTING. It looked like they deep-fried the potato before they put any toppings on it, which gives it the look of an old piece of a work boot that's been deep-fried into carbon crunch, then topped with cold bacon and a *pinch* of cheese. There seemed to be real potato inside, but they fell apart the moment you bit into them because of being deep-fried. We all joked about how nice it would be to be in a TGIFridays at that moment, as well as how we never thought we'd say something like that. But seriously, those potato skins called into question several other food items I've had there.  We couldn't get our check and leave quickly enough."
Dax G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,21,3,1.0,10/3/2011,"I would really give it two stars but seeing as the average rating is about a 3 I feel it needs to go lower. First of all, the reason I would come to bj's is 1) the extensive menu of food and bear 2) the atmosphere of (in my case sunday night football) I went with my brother and my little sister to go finish up the game. We walked inside and we asked if we could be seated in the front booths (which some where open) because we wanted a view of the very large tv above the bar.  We were told that that was not possible because we seating was done by which server needs people. I asked for the manager they said he was on break. Reluctantly and hungry I sat down at the designated seat.  This seat was both by the bathroom, by the back door and by the register. It smelled like a toilet, it was freezing as hell, and the shear amount of servers brushing my backside as well as customers trying to get to the bathroom was uncountable. To try and drown my pain (after waiting 20 minutes just to get asked what drinks we wanted) I decided to order a brewed-in-house beer. I asked for the one that had a asterix next to it as the most popular.  When the beer came with mine and my brother and sisters food, it was warm and had that taste of it being set out for a good 15 minutes, no fresh tap taste to it at all.  the service was poor, the food was alright (portions very small). I will not go back. Its a place filled with servers mid 25-35's who never really did anything with their lifes and feel and have no care about what you want. DO NOT GO HERE. there are a ton of great restaurants in teh area, and if you don't mind traveling take ur family to Hollywood or something."
jason s.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,65,5,1.0,1/13/2011,Sorry but the service has gone down to a new low.  1 hour 20 min for soup and salad?  I think we waited 30 min to get a soup.  One of our grilled chese/ham sandwiches took 40+min and was cold.  Go elsewhere.  The manager seems to treat his employees like crap and was on a major power trip.
Nikki P.,"Berkeley, CA",71,95,4,2.0,8/7/2010,"You see that second star right there? Yeah, that's me being HELLA generous because I'm in a decent mood right now. I could go into painstaking detail about precisely why I won't be visiting here again, but I'm not in the mood to write an essay.   I went in with one other person a little shy of 4 p.m. Apparently, this was our first mistake. The server that started us off (J.P. I believe) was very sweet and made me hip to the fact that they actually have a killer cream soda. That was about the only highlight of our visit.  The second server, Crystal, was neglectful and just about devoid of any emotion other than the former. The ticket time on our appetizer was close to 15 minutes. I went without a refill for about half of the stay, keep in mind lunch for two people here apparently takes an hour and a half to execute.   There were numerous occasions where she would glance in our direction, and as soon as I was about to ask for my fucking refill, she'd waddle her chubby ass clear in the other direction. We left a 15% tip because odds are she has a few other people to tip out, but believe me, I'm still a little bitter about it.    The food wasn't bad, but people, the general public goes out to eat for the service. Keep that in mind next time you're oh so shocked that you get shafted on the tip. Biiiiiiiiiiiitch."
Jeff P.,"Newbury Park, CA",23,51,15,4.0,6/7/2011,"This has become our newest family spot because of the variety of food on the menu.  Everyone can find what they want.....servers are always helpful.  Food is good and service is fast.  Jambalaya is good, turkey burger is excellent, great salads, pizza is good....haven't had anything I wouldn't get again."
Anne R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,86,4,2.0,9/29/2011,"BJ's ..... it is, what it is.   We've been coming here for years, since they opened.  It's almost always crowded, so we try to go when it's between times.  Even so, the service is often terrible.  It's like the waitstaff have never done this before! Pros:  -- lots of good beer choices, if you are into beer.  Their sampler is a favorite of my husband.   -Happy Hour is decent, and they have wine discounted too. - food CAN be very good, and they recently added some healthier entrees, including my new favorite, Chicken a la Fresca (grilled chicken breast on brown rice with yummy veggie ratatouille, under 575 calories!) for around $10.  Yum!  Good stuff. .... if it is served in a reasonable amount of time, that is. Cons:  -you never know if you'll get good service, and I rarely see the same waiter or waitress twice.   -Never come here on Friday or Saturday nights, unless you want to spend an hour sitting and waiting.  It's a given that there will be a huge, annoying wait time.  -twice in the last few months, the kitchen has either lost or sent our entrees out to another customer, leaving us waiting-waiting-waiting while they make it up fresh.   Overall -- just know what it is before you go.  We have the best luck for a late lunch/early dinner or late dinner.  It's nice that they stay open late, not much in this area does that."
Matt W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,3,,1.0,2/12/2014,"Service was horrible tonight. Went with another person and we were given one menu to share. Ordered drinks and appetizer. Eventually we got our drinks but finally had to ask about our appetizer. Amazingly, the waitress walked right out with it. Our food was served later. We weren't asked if we needed anything else. Had to once again flag down our waitress to get some ketchup for our fries. We did notice someone that appeared to be the GM wandering around but she seemed more interested in being cool with her wait staff then actually finding out how the patrons were doing. Overall, not a pleasant service experience and won't be back for a long time."
Erik A.,"Somis, CA",433,119,286,2.0,10/27/2008,"You can definitely skip the food, but the place is good to meet friends for a couple of drinks. I will give it two stars just because they serve beer."
Taymoor J.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",11,9,,2.0,12/2/2011,Food is all right. I usually go after work during happy hour. I'm pretty sure they have one server work the entire bar area. I waited 45 minutes for a water. No exaggeration.
