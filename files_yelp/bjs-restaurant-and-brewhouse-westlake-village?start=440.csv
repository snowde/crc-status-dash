D M.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,6,,1.0,11/17/2013,"We went for a Chicago style deep dish pizza, instead got served a double crust, doughy,  extra dry, bland three topping breaded dish.  The wait was a long 45 min after calling in beforehand, hostesses were unfriendly, and table seating was less than desireable.  Overall a very dissapointing experience.  It'll be another 7 years before we return in hopes for improvement."
Candice Z.,"Portland, OR",444,356,91,4.0,3/1/2009,"This place was packed for a Friday evening, like early evening. We had to wait like 15 minutes, but ended up getting this huge booth [there were only 2 of us] which was nice cause I could stretch out. We ordered drinks, and while out server got those for us we picked out what to order for dinner. We shared the potato skins which were super yummy. Nice and crisp, not greasy, and packed with cheese and bacon. For dinner I got one of their giant baked potatoes while my boy got the sourdough bread bowl with chili. All the food was very yummy. Our server was nice and attentive, always refilling drinks right away. And since we didn't fill up too much on dinner we shared a pizookie for dessert. How can you not get one??? SO GOOD! Overall this BJ's was a lot nicer than the ones I've been to in Orange County."
Nikki S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,39,1,1.0,11/4/2013,"Went to this BJ's for dinner recently and they lost my credit card!! I had to order a new one, and as this was the credit card that all of my online accounts are linked to, I've had to re-do all of my billing. Given the magnitude of this breach of trust, I was astounded by the management's reaction, which was to halfheartedly say, ""uh...sorry we lost your card. Do you have another one to pay with?"". It wasn't close to a sincere apology, but rather was delivered with a tone that indicated they just don't give a damn and saw this all as no big deal. They didn't even offer to comp me my meal, which is the least they could have done given their inexcusable blunder. Unbelievable."
Mon A.,"Westlake Village, CA",36,60,5,4.0,4/27/2010,"This place is great, most of their food is tasty, and service is generally quick and the waiters attentive.  Lunch specials are priced great and in great portions.   It gets a bit busy at lunch rush hour though, so I suggest calling ahead for a table or staggering your lunch break.   The only meal i wouldn't recommend is the chicken parmigiana (or whatever they call it there)."
Alexis C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",15,55,,1.0,6/15/2011,"I've been coming to BJ's here since it first opened in I believe 2002. I've had many dishes from pzookies, pizza, pasta, and a salad and find their food decent. Not great, but decent for a chain. My dad is a picky eater and for him to like the food is huge! I now stay far away from this place! September-November I have had the worst service! From coming for a snack with my friend at 11pm to a family dinner the food has gone down in quality to decent to fair..and the service has been awful! I even talked to the manager and got a giftcard which I used, but have no interest in going back...good try BJ's...but your not worth the $20 or the large glasses of iced tea for $2.50."
Terence T.,"Oak Park, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/20/2014,"I don't normally write reviews but after dining at BJ's this evening (01/20/14) I couldn't help but scribe my displeasure with this establishment.  Upon arriving there was a wait so my girlfriend and I decided to dine in the bar since there were lots of open seats.  After a ten minute wait with no acknowledgement from anyone we returned to the front desk to wait for an open table in the dining room.  Our server/waitress was simi-pleasant but it was clear that she wasn't overly concerned with making a good impression, I would state her name but she never introduced herself.  I got the impression that this establishment train their staff to be mediocre to match the level of the food served.  If you like mediocre fare then you'll be okay here but expect nothing more.  The only thing I will remember about this place is to NEVER go there again.  I give them a 10 on the Yuck meter. They do mediocre well."
Steph H.,"Irvine, CA",249,165,76,4.0,2/7/2011,"Late night happy hour (sun to thurs i think) from 10-close (around midnight)! Half off pizzas, dollar off draft & wells. $2 off appetizers and some other deals. yummmmm! Make sure to sit in the bar area!"
Daran J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",1,3,,2.0,10/2/2011,"Waited more than 40 min. for our food.  Had two servers and felt like we had been abandoned.  Beer was good, but I'd pass on this restaurant based on the awful service and mediocre food."
Briana M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",17,8,,2.0,9/29/2011,"I love BJ's!  Their foods and drinks are amazing and I love the atmostphere.  If you go you have to try a pazokie!  Trust me, just try it.  I usually order either some kind of pasta, deep dish pizza, or stuffed potato and always enjoy them.  As good as BJ's food is however there is always aweful service on fridays and any time that theyare busy.  I have waited hour before!  I have never been so frustrated with service any other place!"
Scott S.,"Honolulu, HI",59,28,8,4.0,9/23/2010,1/2 off Mini pizza's after 10. Food was pretty good beer was pretty good service was pretty good music was terrible
Carmen L.,"Camarillo, CA",0,1,,2.0,1/2/2015,"Our waiter was pretty nice and attentive, but the bar tender was a disaster. This is in reference to the shorter, heavier, caucasian, male behind the bar, it's never appropriate to refer to a female patron as sweetie especially when it is used in sarcasm as an attempt to insult. It's  sexual harassment and illegal. It is also rude to comment on the fact that you can not hear me because there is a loud speaker over my head and it is your assumption  that I am whispering. Your inferences were beyond rude and ventured into abusive. You should never assume that a customer would take abuse from a staff, you assumed wrong by thinking that I would accept your comments. Heads up for the next time if you can't hear a customer, try not standing directly under the loud speaker, maybe eye contact or looking a the menu in which I was pointing. I can't argue with stupid, but I can throw my drink on it. I am done!"
F Y.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,47,,3.0,12/14/2011,"The food here is good, though slightly overpriced. The service is always a hit or a miss--either really good or really crappy. I keep going back for the pizookies and the avocado rolls--yum! They also have several large TVs for sports viewing, and they are one of the few places that actually stays open ""late"" in the area."
Alison M.,"Moorpark, CA",0,24,,1.0,9/4/2013,Sad but this place just keeps going downhill. Every aspect of our dinner was a failure. My beer came 3/4 full. The Cobb salad was served without the bacon and the other ingredients were sparse. Plus they use processed turkey chunks...gross! The pizza was literally NOT cooked. We sent everything back and while they did fix it we were given nothing in compensation. I had a coupon for a free pizookie and while you think it'd be tough to mess up a dessert it was burnt to the dish and sticking to the pan. No way will I be coming back here.
Brian S.,"Camarillo, CA",168,234,74,4.0,3/26/2008,"Pizza, beer and big screen TVs. What more needs to be said?  OK, If you're not happy with that and need something else to get your motor running for this chain brew-house, then you can appreciate that their menu offers many other options, however you really can't avoid the TVs unless you order to go. To me, their menu seemed almost as thick as Cheesecake Factory's menu.  Recently, I enjoyed their sampler appetizer with chips and artichoke dip, avocado egg-rolls, Santa Fe spring-rolls, and more. The sauces that came with it were perfect. I also had a mini BJ's favorite pizza and a pint of Red Ale. The pizza had just about everything on it. I couldn't believe how much stuff they piled onto a little bitty pizza like that. The beer was just as described in the menu: A stronger ale with less hoppiness to bring out the malt and fruit flavors. The service was good and pretty quick. This was lunch, however, and I know that during dinner they get pretty busy.  I've been here several times for both lunch and dinner, mostly with large groups and each time I have been mostly satisfied with little or no complaints. All the pizzas and beers I've tried were good. And I'll just type pizookie cause it's funny. pizookie pizookie pizookie"
Lilani E.,"Seattle, WA",754,657,78,2.0,2/28/2008,"I've only eaten appetizers and had drinks here at the bar.  Why?  Because it's always so horribly busy. No, I do not want a pager.   No, I do not want to wait 45 minutes for table.   I am starving.  Just give me a pale ale, artichoke dip and a pizookie., stat. Thanks in advance."
steve m.,"Studio City, CA",0,32,,1.0,11/6/2013,"I really can't figure out why people like this place. Its nice inside, and they have great TV's but the Food And Service is awful. Too Much Salt in everything. Its too bad because it could be a great place. But really!! ?? 75 Minutes for a Burger on a Tuesday Night?? Also we have been here when its very empty and they have the same slow service."
Dakota B.,"Los Angeles, CA",445,27,1,1.0,3/15/2013,"I like the pizookies. Really bad service. I would not go with a large group. They take forever to bring a check, take forever to bring basic stuff like water and at times were very disrespectful. Dispute tipping after complaining after getting the worst service the server was rude because they said the tip was not enough(even though in my opinion they did not deserve a tip). After that I will never go to BJs again."
R B.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",56,59,1,3.0,9/24/2010,"Decent deep dish.  Have had the santa fe rolls and avacado rolls as appetizers several times - pretty good.  Also tried the shrimp lettuce wraps for the 1st time - not as interesting texturally speaking as PF Chang's lettuce wraps (I think they have water chestnuts as well as peanuts or walnuts), but tasty nonetheless.  I'd generally say spice is lacking, which is typical for a ""must please everyone"" chain restaurant - however I could have asked for hot sauce and probably wouldn't complain had I done so.  Beer selection of course is nice, I've done the sampler (start from light to dark) in the past, but have stuck to the ""nutty brewnette"" the past few times - I guess I'm over the hill."
MThree P.,"Agoura Hills, CA",2,41,31,4.0,1/27/2009,"After moving to the area, I've eaten here twice (lunch and dinner), and have been impressed by the beers.  I figured a big chain could hardly be expected to have decent craft beer, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I had the beer tasting flight last time, and I thought everything was pretty good, and I'm picky about my beer.   The Piranha is decently hoppy, the Porter, Oktoberfest, and the Brewnette are good examples of their style.  I liked the Red and Blonde as well, but who doesn't?  Wait, was I talking about beer?   The food is pretty good for chain fare as well.  The mediterranean pizza was tasty (even if you'd never find such a thing in the mediterranean), lettuce wraps were good too.  It's not going to get the killer Zagat rating, but it's still pretty tasty.  The waitstaff is hit and miss, good one time, just OK the other.  It's kid-friendly too, which is a bonus for me."
Harriet K.,"Granada Hills, CA",119,73,,5.0,3/6/2013,"I had the most wonderful night of service, beer and food. Wow it was the company's beer pairing event this past Monday. I can't say enough good things about it. The food was delicious and the portions very large, generous. The beer was served in vast, plentiful quantities. My bosses and another co-worker of mine was very happy and impressed. The manager that came over to talk to us and explain to everyone about the beers was most gracious. We left very happy and wanting to partake in another beer pairing event!"
