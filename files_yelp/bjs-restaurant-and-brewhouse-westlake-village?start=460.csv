Katherine O.,"Anaheim, CA",161,572,28,2.0,1/6/2010,"After the server took our drink order, I asked if we could put in our food order... and he actually said, ""I have to keep it quick- I have this whole room."" WHAT?!?! Did I hear that right?? Does BJ's use osmosis to take food orders? And by ""whole room"" did you mean the 4 other tables? And thanks for the appetizers without plates. I'm glad you never came back to our table, except to give us the bill."
Valentine D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,8,,1.0,1/31/2010,"We were all eating and a frantic lady came up to us saying she saw a rat and she thought it had run up my husbands arm. It had not, thank goodness, BUT - we did see a rather large rat run up the blinds inside and all around the window area. People who were sitting on that side of the restaurant all got out of their chairs and were standing around in shock. The manager and a bus boy chased after the rat, but at NO POINT did anyone apologise to anyone.  The service was terrible also, we all received our entrees at different times, and the waitress just seemed like she did not want to be there.  I WILL NEVER eat at that rat infested dirty place again. Good luck if you want to brave the wilds of BJ's!!! There is just not enough beer for that  kind of adventure!"
Caroline C.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,1,,1.0,10/16/2014,"Will never be returning to bjs again, especially this one. First of all, me, my boyfriend, and my friend walked in and werent even greeted. They didnt seat us, they told us to find a seat wherever. We took our seat and waited about ten minutes before the waitress came over to ask if we wanted menus..obviously..? She came back again, 10 minutes later with menus and then took our drink order. We told her we were ready to order and we never got the drinks UNTIL our food was ready,. My fries were cooked hours before and they just reheated them, my steak was completely uncooked and cold. My friends salad tasted dry and gross. The waitress never even came back to check on us so i had to ask a bus boy to exchange my food. The waitress came back asking what was wrong and after telling her, she looked annoyed that she had to make me more food. I didnt get my different food for 20 minutes and she didnt even apologize or offer a desert for our nasty meal. We got the check several minutes later and it was over 75 dollars. I can eat at a much nicer place with better food, for cheaper. It was definitely not worth it and I am really angry that they didnt even care. We got up to leave and we didnt even get a ""goodbye"" or ""have a great night"". I wish i got her name because i am not sure why she was even hired. Worst waitress ever. Rudest place ever, and I wish i talked to a manager because that is not okay. I have heard a few good things about this place and this was the worst experience ever. It isnt even worth one star."
Neely M.,"Whittier, CA",70,296,18,2.0,1/18/2008,"I kinda hate this place. My ex wanted to go here for his bday dinner and I was incredibly unimpressed. The service sucked (hello? waiter? I am pretty sure we had a waiter...), the food was kinda bland (but they did give you a ton of it cuz, apparently, when your food tastes crappy, you really want a lot of it), and the place was just crappy. If you like waiting 10 minutes for a soda and never getting any refills, even though you paid $2.95 for it, BJ's is the place for you! Enjoy it!"
Steven C.,"Venice, CA",40,52,9,5.0,8/3/2010,"I wish I didn't have to review so many chain restaurants, but unfortunately that is pretty much most of everything in the area.  The food here is decent enough to satisfy a broad range.  It is a chain brewery, but their food is definitely better than bar food.  They have a decent happy hour for the area.  Mainly we come here over lunch and have their $6.99 all you can eat soup and salad lunch special.  When you're not feeling all that hungry, it really hits the spot.  Their chili is really good and I'm not sure about any of the others because I usually just go for the chili.  I think I've had all the others, but the chili came out tops.  Their beers are pretty decent and they have a ton of TVs to go around.  They probably only should get a four star rating, but I'm in a generous mood today so five it is."
Sheldon E.,"Issaquah, WA",9,16,,4.0,11/5/2008,"What can I say? It's a corporate restaurant with a little more class and better food than Chili's. The service isn't great and they seem to go through a lot of wait staff. Jeff, the bartender, is the only consistent face I see. He earned the place an extra star because he's a cool guy that actually remembers you and is good for a chat here and there. The happy hour is good but get there early because it gets packed. Mini pizzas are half off and I think the other bar food is too. Like I said the food is decent and the prices are fair. I had the fish and chips last night and it was pretty good. Wifey had a burger and it was an 8 as burgers go. I've had the meatloaf and some of the salads, etc. They also have good lunch specials. Half sandwich and choice of soups or salads and wedge fries. It's a lot of food. BTW- They also have that curbside pickup deal if you don't feel like cooking. I tried it recently and it was pretty smooth. Just call from your car and order. Then call again when you hit the parking lot and they bring it to you. Slick."
Bryce W.,"Simi Valley, CA",80,220,2,3.0,5/19/2010,"I wish they sold their beers in stores. They are good. All of them. So good. The food is above average, but the pizzas definitely lead the pack. Their buffalo chicken pizza is to die for. They also have their infamous pizzookie; you have to at least try it. I'm sure you must wonder how something with such great food and drinks could only get 3 stars?! It's their service my dear sir. It's that bad. I would give their waiters a 1 and their food/drinks a 5. Or maybe a 0 and 4 respectively depending on the night. They need to hire people from outside of the snobby Westlake-Agoura area. It can get spendy quickly too."
Grace K.,"Livingston, NJ",20,66,2,1.0,11/16/2007,"If you like service that can best be described by a picture of a large ASS, then this is the place for you. The food was good but they still get one star because, come on, how hard is it to bring the food before it's cold, bring beers before they turn flat, clear the dishes before dessert, and act like a nice person to the people from whom you might like a tip.  I repeat: ASS."
Nancy W.,"Atascadero, CA",27,190,144,1.0,6/25/2012,"My daughter wanted the all you can eat soup & salad, but they don't serve it on weekends for lunch.  We ordered one Cobb salad to split.  It was awful.  The lettuce was like from a bag of shredded for tacos & had no flavor,.  The Salad had only a few bits of bacon, a few squares of chicken, a couple pieces of blue cheese & that was it (minor tomatoes too).  It was horrible.   Our waitress forgot us & never came back so I told the male host who then went & had the waitress enter our order in the computer.  we got a free pozuki cookie for my daughter's birthday after waiting a long time.  It probably took an hour to get in & out of there for only 2 cups soup, one salad, & the cookie desert.  Horrible service.  BTW, the bathrooms had not been serviced after the Sat. night service, as we got there not long after they opened for lunch & the bathroom trash was full & also all over the floor.  One of the stalls had no toilet paper.  It was a mess!  There was an Asian guy standing around that my daughter thought must be the manager on duty, but I didn't even see him as he was so passive that he may as well have not been there."
Doug S.,"Mountain View, CA",1,85,,4.0,5/19/2010,"Great food and Great beer.  This is my go to place for consistent food and service.  I may not like all the beers the serve but the have stepped it up a notch by having plenty of guest taps.  Last week they had Stone Brewing on guest tap and  I can't ever find Stone beer on tap.  So if your looking for good beer and food this is the place, be sure and call ahead since there is line most of the time."
Dave S.,"Moorpark, CA",17,13,5,4.0,2/7/2010,"I have not been here in a while, it is great to see BJs now offers both West Coast IPA (Green Flash) and Union Jack (Firestone). The bartender noted that this chain cannot easily change the menu so these brews should be available for a long time....sweet!"
Austin K.,"Alpine Meadows, CA",130,15,,3.0,7/16/2013,"Good Eat. I ordered the Deep Dish Cheeseburger Pizza and very much enjoyed it. Believe it or not it actually did taste a lot like a cheeseburger, amazing. Service was good and they were all very polite. We were seated relatively quick and were given a very comfortable booth. I'd say give this place a try."
Jeff K.,"Sacramento, CA",4,149,,4.0,6/7/2012,"This particular B.J.'s turned out to be one of the better restaurants in their huge chain. The place was packed on a Saturday night with diners and literally 100's of hockey fans in the bar watching their beloved (since they are now winning bandwagoners) L.A. Kings beat the Devils in OT. For being so crowded, the service turned out to be quite excellent and efficient! I opted for one of their new steak entrees and truly enjoyed a perfect ribeye steak, cooked medium-rare with horseradish mashers and vegetables. The quality of the 12oz. cut was outstanding. My dining partner had the Chicken Alfredo and it was judged as delicious. B.J.'s, along with Elephant Bar has always been at the top of my list as far as good food and consistent service. Some are better than others...like this location. I wish the Folsom, California restaurant had the same vibe and excellent service, but the food has always been a notch above."
N W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",3,10,,4.0,3/29/2011,"I like both the Cajun Pasta and the Grilled Chicken Pasta. A pizookie for dessert is a must. The restaurant gets rather packed and loud, so conversations can be difficult (especially if some in your party are distracted by televisions)."
Jerkey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",21,154,7,4.0,9/24/2007,"MMM, mmm, mm -- I loooove getting BJ's.  I love taking kids to get BJ's and paying for it.  I like to ask ""Hey don't you just love getting BJ's?""  Aren't they just so scrumptious?  I love me some BJ's.    Boy I'll take a BJ any day.   Go get you some BJ's today!"
Christian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,387,9,3.0,1/15/2008,Came here a few times for a moderate priced meal with a relaxed setting. It does fulfill that  and yet as others did mention is true about the service.  Few times I came here  we were passed over for another larger table that was either drinking more or something. Anyhow mainly went with straight friends who wanted to watch the game than sit at home watching HGTV Design on a Dime with me! HAHA Don't live in this area anymore so I doubt I'll go back.
Jane c.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,10,,2.0,1/2/2011,Was there on 1/2 with my family.  There were nine people including 2 children  The servicee was aweful. Our food took about 25 minutes to come and my daughter had to send hers back and my husband had to ask for gravy which should have been on the chicken.  I was never asked if I wanted the fried or grilled taco and by the time the food came it was so long I just decided to eat it and move on.
Allison K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",4,71,,1.0,2/14/2009,"If you want to eat food prepared the way you like it, forget it.   If you want service, forget it. If you want to wait forever for a table, this is the place for you. If you want to be ignored once you have a table, this is the place for you. If you want your waiter to come and ask you if you need anything else AFTER you have eaten the food which was not cooked the way you like and took you forever to get, this is the place for you. If you want to feel like you paid money to be treated like crap, this is the place for you. If you don't give a rat's ass about beer, this place might NOT be for you. If you don't care how late it's open, this place might NOT be for you. If you think you might scream if you see a TV in a restaurant, this place might NOT be for you. I've been here with groups, just two people or a table of four and I've always come away disappointed. And for a Pizzuki (or whatever they call it), slap some ice cream on some bakery cookies at home and call yourself happy! Sheesh!"
Mina R.,"Calabasas, CA",61,91,3,3.0,6/29/2009,"It's a good restaurant when you're with the kids. It's loud and distracting with a kids menu, etc. I wouldn't come here if it were adults only."
Clint D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,37,,3.0,8/28/2007,"BJ's is a sports bar atmosphere type of place, BIG TVs etc. They have their own  beers on tap along with a few others - a step up from fizzy yellow beer for the most part. They have a large selection of food; soup and salads, pizza, pasta, burgers and fish tacos, baby back ribs, and many more."
