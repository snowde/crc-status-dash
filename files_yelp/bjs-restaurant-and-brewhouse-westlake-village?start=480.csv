Stephanie D.,"San Diego, CA",4,38,,3.0,11/20/2011,"my friend got the bacon cheeseburger pizza which i had a piece of (great) and i got a sort of italian/greek hybrid salad, i don't remember the name of it, it was great as well. the issue was the service! we were there at 2pm on a thursday, so it was not busy at all, and there were servers standing around, bored. but, somehow our server ignored us time after time. he took forever to get refills and even longer to bring us our check."
Jeff H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",59,46,,2.0,2/2/2010,"I think Yelpers have it wrong on this one. BJ's is over-rated. What they do well is brew beer. The beer is always fresh and is reasonably priced. I am a firm believer that you can't be good at everything... If BJ's just brewed beer and served Pizza, they would probably be good.  The problem is that they also have Sandwiches, Salads and other entre's which I find to be not so good. The Pizza is just okay (I go for the Buffalo Chicken) and service is spotty. They are always nice, but forget things frequently. Location is good."
Abigail S.,"Moorpark, CA",1,7,2,4.0,6/20/2012,I've only been there for the pizookie lately and both times it's been alright. I understand it takes a bit of time for the cookie to bake in the oven. Our server was very funny and entertaining though so I will let the wait slip.
Mark R.,"Woodland Hills, CA",0,12,,1.0,6/14/2012,"Went with a party of 20 for a celebration.  Have been to this BJs many times before with generally good experiences.  This one was the worst dining  experience I've had in a looooong time.  Dinner took three hours, it took 45 minutes to get dessert, and 45 to get the bill.  Food was good but 5 families had a terrible time and BJs has just lost 20 customers forever.  Definitely recommend avoiding for larger groups."
Brett S.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,7,,4.0,5/19/2012,Crowded and not as much parking as needed but great food and beer!
Andrew M.,"San Diego, CA",1683,346,600,5.0,9/18/2010,"BJ's is always awesome, very rarely if ever have I recieved bad service or low quality food from this establishment. I've been coming to BJ's for many years, probably dining with them well over 200 times. It's a great place for hosting small business meetings, or just having a nice lunch or dinner with your family. You couldn't ask for a better menu, especially when it comes to prices which are pretty reasonable for the portions. The staff is always friendly and attentive, even when they are super busy and fully committed. The pizzas are bomb (although fattening as they might be), the pizookies are definatly a winner, and the salads are my personal favorite section (try the BBQ choppd chicken salad, amazing!!!). I also love the fact that over the last few years they have really started to improve the restaurant building itself, small changes make a world of difference, new floors and decor has really taken BJ's to the next level..."
Robert L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,1,,4.0,2/11/2010,"I had not been in this Bj's in awhile, and it has really improved in the past year. The staff seems more professional and friendly, and the fact that they have over 40 beers on tap plus a huge selection of Belgian Beers is awesome!  I had the Ribs and a Negra Modelo (on tap!) and they practically fell off the bone. The bartender, Alex, gave great service and was really entertaining. Whatever is being done differently here, keep doing it."
Assaji A.,"Westlake Village, CA",6,32,123,3.0,3/26/2011,"Ok, it's a chain and the menu is wide ranging but unexciting.  The place has about as much personality as your average CA strip mall.  BUT,  the pizza is good - the crust is outstanding - and they have more beers available than you can count.  If you have kids, they have a great kids selection.  Did I mention the beer selection - the house brews are pretty good but they have a large selections of bottles including some great imports.  2 stars for the restaurant, 3 for the beer selection."
Jay F.,"Woodland Hills, CA",118,186,2,3.0,10/15/2007,"Credit where credit is due. We used to go here last year for lunch but stopped going because it took forever for the food to arrive.  I like the food, its OK for a chain, you know the usual fare. It had gotten very slow because of this problem which was consistently bad every time we went and I am sure that's why others stopped going. BUT.....recently, we went back, we didn't want to but the boss wanted to go. To my surprise, things improved tremendously.. So we went again, and again, and again!!   Problem fixed by the management.  Great place to watch the game."
Tracy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/29/2011,"Had the need for an open late restaurant in the T.O area on a weekday (hard to find let me tell you). At 11:15, the BJ's staff was friendly and our server Angela was attentive, non-obtrusive and very nice. The staff let us stay until well after the restaurant closed and never made us feel rushed or unwelcome.  The food was pretty good, my fish and chips were over cooked, but the salmon was delish!"
Marcus J.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,2,,3.0,9/15/2011,"The food is good, but at 3000 calories per meal (I'm guessing), this should be a rare treat. I don't particularly like that their buffalo wings come with the sauce on the side, but the buffalo chicken pizza is phenomenal. Oh, and thank goodness they finally brought in craft beers from other breweries, because their own stuff is barely drinkable. That said, great go-to place when you feel like you deserve it."
Two O.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",44,7,,5.0,11/12/2007,"This is my favorite bar around my neighbor hood. My friend, her name xxxxx is the bartender there and she will hook you up big time on drinks (Contact me if you want to know her name). Nothing is better than the PM Porter from BJ Brewery if you truly like dark beer. If you like light beer, you can go with the BJ Blond. I would go here instead of TGI Fridays any day."
Mark M.,"Rocklin, CA",90,113,9,3.0,5/13/2011,pretty good as far as BJs goes.  this one is always packed with high schoolers each friday and saturday.  its funny to hear about all the parties they;re going off to and they start at BJs.  service is good but it could just be a wait.
S T.,"San Jose, CA",3,32,,4.0,9/19/2008,"This has been a def. visit everytime i am in the thousand oaks area for a business visit. They hv their own beers (Piranha -IPA is good for those who like hoppy beers) Then thrs the Blonde Ale (no comments) and the Tatanka Stout (which was alrite) Jus tried this three and I guess I am gonna stick with Piranha the next time I am thr. The place is huge but thrs generally a wait if u go during dinner time. Big Screen tv behind the bar, so u can always hang in thr and order your food watching MNF or Baseball. Food-wise...if I remember, i hv tried  nachos and Chicken Pot Stickers  (appetizers) and both were good. My fav is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Pizza, Beer and Sports on a big screen - u cant go wrong with it!!!"
Amy T.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",8,10,,3.0,3/18/2011,"One of the best choices if you have finicky children, but the food is not much better than standard pub fare although there are plenty of choices.  I am still perplexed as to why this place is so crowded, but I think it comes down to the family atmosphere."
Christina C.,"Chatsworth, CA",11,24,,1.0,1/15/2008,"Service here is horrible. Waits are long and aren't worth it. One time I went with friends who had kids, one needed a high chair. They tried to sit us in one of the raised booths with 3 highchairs stacked on top of one another so it would be elevated high enough to reach the table! It was ridiculous and when we refused to sit there, they made us wait another 1/2 hour for a lower booth to open up. At least there we weren't putting the baby in danger... Otherwise, food is decent and i actually like the rootbeer."
John M.,"Camarillo, CA",221,281,221,5.0,2/25/2008,"Well I have to give it 5 stars since I met my wife there.  BUT, it also has some great happy hour specials, great pizzas, fabulous beer and a young and social atmosphere.  Great for catching the game, hanging out after work or just about anything else."
Kristina R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,2.0,5/26/2013,"I've been to BJ's multiple times as I work down the street and go in at lunch time during the weekday. This is the first time I've gone in on a Sunday afternoon and will not be back during this time. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because I really like the food. My husband and I walked in and were greeted by the host. We sat at the bar top. The bartender Craig, although he seemed nice, he only had the bar top and there were a total of 3 people including us. My husband had to ask 3 times for water before he finally brought him water. The third time when my husband asked for water Craig had asked 1 or 2 waters my husband said ""2 waters please"" and even put up 2 fingers indicating he would like 2 waters. The bartender only brought 1. We had to ask yet again for another water. He was more concerned with his coworkers than with us. Which is weird because you would think he would pay more attention to us since we were 2 of the 3 people at the bar top. We ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and great as usual. I ordered the California club pizza which is always good and my husband ordered the mini pepperoni pizza. Now here's what really ticked me off...I was watching the Nebraska/Oklahoma softball game the entire time I was there. A guy came up to the bar and asked the channel to be changed. No big deal because there's 4 screens at the bar. Craig said the manager had to change it. He didn't ask me or my husband if we were watching anything on the tv. That's the channel that was changed and it was towards the end of the game. At that point I was pissed at the lack of service throughout the entire meal that I loudly said ""really? I was watching that game"" and Craig was standing 2 feet away from us and I know he heard. He didn't bother saying oh I'm so sorry let me get the manager to change it back...nothing!! All he said was ""oh can I get you change"" I turned to my husband and said let's get out of here and we left. I will not be back during this time again. I love their food and overall service is okay to good to great even but today wasn't the case. It was more of a service thing to me when I went there today. Please train your bartenders to be more interactive with their guests instead of focusing on chatting with their coworkers. Like I said I'll be back because I like the food but this time I was really disappointed!"
Nat K.,"San Francisco, CA",103,381,3,3.0,9/20/2007,"Solid for BJ's -- that spinach artichoke pizza works well.  And apparently, this is the happening place to be in the lower 805 -- quite the local hangout for high school kids and other young adults."
Simon H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,13,,2.0,7/16/2009,"Not a good place - bad beer, surly staff and not so good food. It only gets an extra star for the camaraderie of people I was with which made the evening entertaining."
