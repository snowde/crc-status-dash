Stacy S.,"Glendale, CA",7,6,,1.0,10/17/2011,"OMGosh, if you want poor service, mistaken orders, and ""I couldn't possibly care less"" attitudes, be sure and go here!  The Mother of the child with celiac disease, asked the waitress if she could get half of the stuffed potato at the the child's menu rate.  She called the manager over who agreed that he could do that, we ordered it. We waited nearly an hour for our orders to arrive and THREE OF THE SIX were wrong.  Instead of a baked potato with chicken and broccoli, our  child with Celiac disease was brought Feticini Alfredo.  OOOphs, sent it back. The wait staff had pushed the wrong button on the screen.  The Gluten free pizza to be shared by two ""wheat sensitive"" guests came  as an entire 'margarita Pizza"" - tho we had ordered 1/2 plain cheese and 1/2 margarita.  Another gluten free pizza was ordered with garlic and chicken.  It came with garlic, chicken and sun dried tomatoes... We had waited for an hour with two bouncy 5 year olds, so we said, ""OK, it's not what we ordered, but OK leave  it.. ""  The child with celiac ate half of her Mom's gluten free pizza, so we told the waitress, 'cancel the potato, we can;t wait for it.""  The waitress said, Well, It's already in the oven.'  we said, ""Well now we don't want it.  Most of us are already done eating lunch!""  , a server came by with the potato...!  We said, ""We don't want it!""  But, of course, the five year old who wanted it in the first place, now wanted some of it.  so we said, ""OK, leave it, and bring us the bill.""  We got the bill, which charged us for the fetticini, WE NEVER ORDERED!, the sun dried tomatoes, that were mistakenly added to our order - and which we accepted...!  And for the entire baked potato, which we tried to cancel - and which the manager had said would be half price, because there were no gluten free items on the children's menu.   Their mistake.  We compained and got  $2 off of the potato, which arrived as 5 of the 6 eaters were finished with their meals - and rhey took off the fetticini, which we never ordered. accepted or consumed.  What a NIGHTMARE!  I cannot more strongly reccomend that you eat elsewhere!!!"
Jennifer D.,"Oak Park, CA",6,337,,3.0,5/1/2008,It's a very busy sports-bar type place.  I dig their happy hour pizzas and love the pizookies.
Sharon C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,35,,2.0,8/24/2010,"Is it too much to ask for to have a server smile and actually be welcoming?  Gasp! What a concept.  Bad service, mediocre food.  I went here for a late night dinner on Friday (lack of food options at that time in Thousand Oaks).  The server (Amanda G.) was impatient and was clearly in a hurry to get out of there.  The restaurant was pretty full so we were not the last customers.  She showed no interest in getting our orders and acted as though it was a burden for us to be there.  We ordered the classic baked potato and a burger.  The potato was good, but you cannot really mess that up since anything smothered in butter and sour cream is pretty tasty.   The burger was dry, tastless and looked like it came from McDonalds.  We barely had a few bites before Amanda came by with our check and dropped it off without a word to us.  What happened to ""did you save any room for our Pizookie?""  I have been to BJs before, but the service at this location is definitely on the decline."
Paula r.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,10,,4.0,5/30/2010,"a family favorite. yummy deep-dish pizza, to die for avocado rolls and great minestrone soup. big menu, and something for anyone. a little on the expensive side, though. however, they don't take reservations and the wait can be around a hour on weekends."
Craig M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,6,1,3.0,3/18/2008,"Good beer.  Lot's of TV's.  Too slow (give yourself at least an hour and a half for lunch).  The foods just not that exciting.  Salads, pizzas, burgers, fish tacos ... I've tried just about everything and there's not one thing that I've ever said to myself ""wow, this is good"" (except the beer)."
