Michael L.,"Anaheim, CA",0,4,1,1.0,10/22/2017,"This was my first time at this BJ's restaurant in Westlake and it was bad experience. BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants and I frequent this eatery at least once a week near my home in Orange County. We arrived around midnight to find the place nearly empty. The few customers I observed had either already finished their meal or were ordering dessert. We ordered chips and Queso dip to start. 30 minutes later I asked about the chips and dip and our waiter stated he would go check on the order and apologized because he was too busy scooping ice cream. He came back and said they were out of queso dip. It took them 30 minutes to figure this out. I let that go. We then ordered our food and it took closer to an hour which was now near closing time. I again had to remind the waiter on 3 different occasions about our food. My friends and I observed at least 15 other employees standing around or counting money to close out for the night. We asked to speak to a manager and a lady by the name of Monica came to our table. She made us feel like our complaints were minimal and knew the buzzwords but it was obvious she truly didn't care. I work in administration and this Bj's is obviously ran from the top down and the employees resemble her leadership. I would have had multiple employees helping out the remaining customers instead stating how busy it was earlier that night with all of Westlake high school students that overwhelmed their staff. I observed 3 waitresses counting their money towards the back of the restaurant and walking past our table with cash in hand. Could have been tips. We saw a few at the bar mingling and joking around. We saw a few at the entrance standing their joking. It was frustrating to witness this as we were wondering where our food was. Our waiter also stated that sometimes the kitchen staff packs it up early for night and how it was frustrating for him. Again, a leadership issue. After we complained, our waiter stepped it up. He annoyingly asked if we wanted water refills even though water was in our cup but why does it take a complaint to get a descent service. I normally don't write reviews unless the service is really great or really bad. Time for a new manager or better training."
Mary S.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,4,1,1.0,5/14/2017,"We don't come to BJ's often but the last 2 times we have gone we experienced very poor customer service. When customers resort to having to look for waiters/waitresses outside of their own is completely unacceptable. It took us nearly 20 min to finally get someone who worked there to walk by and get us to-go boxes. When we finally got checked in on, our waitresses attitude was rude and she seemed uninterested. We came to celebrate Mothers Day and everyone was in a happy mood but after the horrible experience we had at the Thousand Oaks location we left very disappointed and unsatisfied. If you decide to give this location a try I hope you get someone other than Christy as your waitress."
John A.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,6,,5.0,7/25/2017,"BJ's is one of my favorite places to watch a game with beer, especially if it is the Warriors.  They have great pizza and a tremendous menu.  With a large family gathering, they are very accommodating.  Highly recommend them, great service, great people, and they really support the community.  Great local place!"
Dayana M.,"San Diego, CA",67,6,2,2.0,7/22/2017,"Horrible service, had a girl named Camryn help us with our order, switched up our drinks  and when we told her the issue she asked to just switch the beers after we had already sip from them ... instead of just giving us new drinks. Once the bill came waitress was having an attitude and just slapped the bill on the table, she got offended because we asked for new drink and gave her a 5 dollar tip, my uncle asked to talk to the manager Joe and explained to him what had happened, my family and I always come here but never experience this type of service before. Manager tried his best to do the right thing."
I Just W.,"Arcadia, CA",0,1,,5.0,10/20/2017,Had an inconvenience where my party ended up waiting for a quite long time because the server didn't put our name in the system. Service was great however and Monica was a very nice and customer-friendly manager who helped us with our paycheck for the inconvenience. She definitely deserves to be a manager and made the whole night better for me and my party. Alexis was a great server as well and this all outweighed the negatives.
Alex P.,"Camarillo, CA",0,13,2,5.0,6/25/2017,"Went back to BJ's today with my family, I have to say our experience was completely different. Our server Morgan was great. He was attentive and although the food was taking a little long, he kept us in the loop and it was no problem at all. Food came out as requested and it was great.  The manager Hilda came over to talk to us and we expressed how great everything had been and thanked her for the follow up. We also told her how good Morgan was along with another server Miguel who we were talking to. I appreciate BJ's response and initiative to make things right."
Rick M.,"Simi Valley, CA",3,34,48,2.0,6/13/2017,"Ordered the BBQ brisket burger thinking it was going to be huge. My mistake, it was lacking the brisket. Barely had any brisket or BBQ sauce making it less than a regular burger."
Ashley B.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,3,,5.0,7/18/2017,Just had an amazing dinner at BJ's. Our server Jenean was outstanding. Was quick and great service. Loved our food. Will definitely be going back soon!
Rebecca G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,5,3,1.0,9/23/2017,"Waited 10 mins for menus. Then waited 10 more mins for our server to come and take our drink orders. Server was condescending and rude. The table behind my boyfriend must have been employees that worked there.  They came after us and were served before us. The drink that I ordered tasted awful. I never send back anything but I had to. Waited 30 mins for our food to be served. I asked for my burger to be medium and received it well done as well as cold fries. I was so hungry that I didn't say anything because that would have probably took another 30 mins. We asked our server for our check right away, once he brought us our food because he was so horrible. Never received it. He sat down at the table of employees and was just chilling. My boyfriend was so upset that he stood up and left. I went over to the group of employees and asked for my check. I feel embarrassed for the franchise owner's because if this is how your staff treats your customer, I'm not sure how they will stay in business."
Jason L.,,374,445,1235,4.0,3/7/2015,"BJ's is a popular (and busy) brew house in Westlake.   This location is pretty large and can seat a good amount of people, but if you don't get there early for dinner (especially on weekends) you can plan on a wait.   Parking:  Plenty of spots, but in a busy shopping plaza so it can get pretty full Facility:  This location is modern, clean and well maintained.  Great place to enjoy a meal. Service:  We've had solid experiences here.  Nice greeters, friendly and prompt waiters. Food:  The food is great for this type of restaurant.  Nothing INSANE, but definitely tasty and fairly priced.  For an appetizer, I suggest the cheese sticks.  My kids absolutely love them. Overall, this is a 3-4 star restaurant.  Enjoyable and fairly priced.  Pleasant dining experience!"
Sara R.,"Riverside, CA",66,35,8,5.0,9/14/2017,"We love BJs. Came in from out of town and was greeted by the manager right as we walked up!! Great service, our favorite food was on point, and drinks were cold and fresh. Yaaaaaaaas I love BJs"
Lucy N.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,2.0,7/11/2017,"The customer service at this restaurant is not the best. The food was amazing, but the service not so much. I should not take 30 minutes to  be greeted. Better luck next time, I hope."
Jeffrey K.,"Granada Hills, CA",0,2,,1.0,6/15/2017,We came to BJs to celebrate a friend's graduation... and BJs completely ruined such a wonderful moment in her life... Our party waited for 50 minutes without getting our order taken. We did not get our food for over 75 minutes... This is ridiculous... The server did not even apologize for ignoring our table and only attending to everyone else around us... He deserves to be fired... WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  They are not worthy of any stars. I have never had such a bad food experience ever in my life... DON'T COME HERE!
Sam S.,"Agoura, CA",86,3,5,1.0,10/1/2017,"Ordered a prime rib dinner. 10 minutes after everyone else food was delivered to the table, I decided to ask where my dinner was. At the point, I was told that ran out. So not only did I not get my dinner, they decided to wait so long to tell me, that I couldn't even order something else and still enjoy dinner with my family. Service was also horrendous. Forgotten drinks, slow refills, and server no where to be found when I was looking for my food. Won't be eating here again anytime soon."
Mike T.,"Simi Valley, CA",4725,371,1020,5.0,1/7/2016,"This was the first time I have ever been to a BJ's restaurant and I have to say that it was really good. My wife had ordered the 6oz sirloin with white cheddar mashed potatoes and I ordered a small deep dish pizza with the works and they were both very delicious. My pizza had half pesto sauce and half ranch sauce which made for a great taste. The garlic knots with butter were super tasty and don't let me forget about the calamari "" freaking phenomenal"". I would definitely come back to this restaurant, no doubt about it. Plus, take a look at my pics and they will tell the story of my experience!"
Mike M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1821,1380,381,4.0,1/3/2016,"Not bad for a chain.  Not bad at all.  We were in town visiting an elderly relative.  We gave him the option of picking a dinner spot and did not want to subject him to a Yelp-trained-foodie making suggestions of strange spots.   Please, oh please, pick a decent spot, Uncle Fred.   When he said ""BJ's"" we were thrilled.  Big enough place, not hard to get a table, huge menu, close to home, not fast food, not expensive, waiter service, takes credit cards, serves beer and hard alcohol, football on Big screens, and lots of vegetarian options for my daughter. Fred loves the thick pizza, mother in law loved the flatbread pizza.  Cool, they were happy.  I liked the avocado egg rolls, and the chips and salsa were okay but pricey.  The tomato bisque was quite good on this cold day and I really enjoyed the seared ahi salad.  My daughter like the huge portobello mushroom burger and fries and my wife enjoyed the kale salad.  Everybody had beers and cocktails/mocktails and we all left happy. Not bad for a chain at all....."
Rack City C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",20,40,30,2.0,3/11/2017,2 stars for the pizza alone. That'll always be good. But service? Nope. Nope. Nope. I wish I read reviews before coming too. Food takes FOREVER to get to you. The honey crunchy chicken salad was gross McDonald's quality. I asked for no onions on something - it was still covered in onions. Etc. etc. manager needs to give the staff a big pep talk on good service like even the basics like ask your guests immediately if their food is good. Manager are you listening??? I hope so!
Kirra M.,"Los Angeles, CA",400,4,,1.0,6/10/2017,So tonight me and my friends were supposed to have a reservation because it was her last night in town and the general manager was supposed to put it in the system. We sent someone (who is deaf) in at 730 to tell them we were ready and they said it would be a 40 minute wait.... we were really confused and thought they may have misunderstood him so we went inside  and they said our reservation wasn't in the system.... basically never reserve at bjs because they won't honor it and then you can't spend your friends last night with her.
Lori R.,"San Francisco, CA",201,91,263,4.0,12/30/2015,"I find it tough rating big corporation restaurants. The reason for this is because I have usually gone to them way too many times to even count. With this said, I'm going to rate it anyway and I'm going to make this the best unbiased review yet. My order today was a mini deep dish cheese pizza with a pumpkin pizooki to go with it. I'd say this meal is the epitome of what bjs brewery embodies (aside from the beer, which we all know is always spot on). Considering I decided to order take out there was nothing I could do to change that though. The deep dish cheese pizza was a delight. It was warm and had soft dough with the right amount of crust along the edges. The pizza is incredible here and the tomatoes are cooked to perfection.  The pizooki I ordered was a pumpkin pizooki topped with vanilla bean icecream. Amazing. Just beyond incredible. Every bite brought me to euphoria. I couldn't stop until it was all gone. Luckily it's the end of December so worrying about those extra calories doesn't begin until next year!"
