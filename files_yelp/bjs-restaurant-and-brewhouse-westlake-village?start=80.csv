Carlos P.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",1,5,,5.0,10/2/2017,I absolutely love this location. Brandy the GM is phenomenal and the reason I return every single time. This company is lucky to have someone with such passion working for them. I will recommend this location to everyone I see whether they are an individual or a family. LOVE BJS
Mr. B.,"Agoura Hills, CA",4,25,3,5.0,4/23/2017,Great restaurant! Amazing food And love the pazooki! This is the best BJs location. Excellent service too
Kiana R.,"Westlake Village, CA",0,11,,5.0,6/6/2017,"I love this place. Has some great deals, and prices are amazing. I really like the interior, it looks very nice. Staff are also very nice and will let you know about their specials"
Dorine L.,"Newbury Park, Newbury Park, CA",0,4,,5.0,10/2/2017,Where do I begin? So food is soooooo yummy you need to try the lettuce wraps!!!! And the General Manager Brandy is such a sweetheart I love her. She goes above and beyond and helps so many people it's unbelievable. BRANDY V THX SO MUCH!!
Dixie V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",64,12,4,2.0,4/9/2017,"For years we've enjoyed good food, drinks and beverages.  Sadly the service has gone downhill fast. We were there in late Feb for a birthday celebration and then a few nights ago for a Happy Hour.  Both times we had issues with wrong orders, no follow through to ask if we'd like another drink (which we would have said YES), etc.  Then the bill is wrong. And wrong again. 3rd time was correct. Mind you I ordered chips / salsa, salad and 1 drink.  I'm done giving them chances or my money."
Deena C.,"Phoenix, AZ",6,22,6,5.0,3/19/2017,Our bartender Cody made this a 5 star experience. He was such an amazing bartender and chatter. This man deserves a crazy raise. Food wasnt to bad at all and my boyfriend enjoyed their craft beers. Try the deep dish pepperoni pizza... Oh my gosh... Also dont forget...... Sit at the bar and chat with Cody. You wont be disappointed.
Marjorie H.,"Newbury Park, CA",0,2,,1.0,8/31/2017,"Very upset that BrandyV still has not contacted me about the poor service we received.  After my poor review she wrote an immediate reply on yelp for me to contact her.  I sent her an email on 8/7 and I resent on 8/25.  It is now 8/31 and I still have not heard from her.  Interesting how BrandyV sounds concerned on yelp and seems to want to correct the situation.  When in reality she doesn't do anything about it.   I also noticed that she did reply to the 2 positive reviews on 8/11, so I know she has been to work.  What a shame.  Good food, poor service and poor management."
Lois R.,"Agoura Hills, CA",0,4,,5.0,9/11/2017,"Excellent evening celebrating my daughter's professional accolades at a corner table at BJ's. Tiana, our amazing server, pointed out the Prime Rib weekend meal (that includes the Pizookie).  She even promptly ordered the last end cut for my husband. She made a wonderful celebration even more special"
Julian A.,"Newbury Park, CA",32,24,9,1.0,9/12/2016,Horrible food I asked them many times not to make my food spicy and they bring it out spicy anyway the food was very  spicy and meatballs were undercut any with disgusting the manager took forever to come they always take forever to take care of you and serve you and I am very disappointed with them I've been here many times and they've always messed it up never coming again do not be here!!!!!!!
Shawn M.,"Camarillo, CA",6,20,,5.0,9/3/2017,Thousand Oaks westlake village becoming the new Beverly Hills. Excellent service is mandatory.  Great beer.

Haley R.,"Tampa, FL",0,7,4,1.0,7/5/2017,"This was my boyfriend and I's first time eating at BJ's. My 22 year old boyfriend ordered a beer and the waitress stood there looking at his ID for a while (which is normal), but then she walked off with the ID and didn't give any explanation. She took it over to two other ladies standing by a register. They then all walked over to the bar and stood there with the two bar tenders looking over the ID, looking at us, and laughing. My boyfriend was so confused. Why did it require 5 people to calculate a birth date and approve an ID? He walked over to ask what the problem was. Apparently that wasn't an acceptable question to ask because from where I was siting it looked like an argument. I walked over and asked what the problem was and the response I received was an extremely rude, ""I'm not talking to you."" We said we didn't understand why the ID had been taken away. The female bar tender then threatened ""not to serve us anything at all."" We said we just don't understand what the problem is. The male bar tender said we have to take the ID because it's a chain restaurant. I explained that we eat at chain restaurants all the time and never have this problem. After this whole unnecessary scene they caused, the male bar tender FINALLY tells us their store policy for out of state IDs is to have it scanned in the back. Due to this unnecessary damper on our 4th of July, we decided to leave and we don't plan on returning. Waitresses, if you have a policy that is a bit unusual, make sure you kindly explain it to your customer. A conflict would then be avoided and the waitress would receive a generous tip."
Dana H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,48,,3.0,9/9/2017,Was a little disappointed with dinner last night. Got seated right away which was a plus. Food took forever to get. Busy but not crazy busy. My order came wrong but just ate anyways. The Pizookie we ordered came wrong but took 20 minutes to get so just took. We had to go to counter to get our check because took way too long and we needed to be somewhere.  The fish tacos which I normally love weren't that great at all. Different sauce and hardly anything on them.
Amit C.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,38,1,1.0,6/11/2016,"Worst bjs I've been to by far.  I'm a regular visitor to bj's and on my travels I've been a few different ones. This was the worst experience I've had.  Waited over an hour for our table where they seemed to bump people who came in after us ( without reservations) ahead of us. Got a dirty table with wet seats. Had to fight to get another table. Waited 20 minutes for the server to come to the table and another 15 for the drinks.  Good was average at best.  My advice, go to public school 805 down the street."
Mark M.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",66,14,,2.0,3/18/2017,Super slow service. Waiter was so slow never asked if we needed refills or anything. I would understand if it was packed but there was like 6 groups here. He was standing by the bar watching tv while we were waiting for our check. Took 15 mins to get our check and another 10 for him to get my card
Cliff H.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",514,20,28,5.0,8/5/2016,I was in a hurry and didn't have time to stop for lunch. I really love BJ's Salmon lunch and I was dying for it. I took a chance and went in they took care of me in a hurry I got in and out in 15 minutes! Plus the food was amazing we good
Erin K.,"Ojai, CA",320,1396,10421,4.0,8/14/2015,"I ate here for lunch today with a coworker and really enjoyed the whole experience.  We didn't have to wait for a table, though they said they didn't have any booths available, which was odd not just because there were plenty of open booths, but because half-way through our lunch they did start seating people at those (one row of empty 2-person booths was literally right next to our table).  Besides that, the trip was great.  Service was prompt and our server was energetic and friendly.  They were able to accommodate my special requests on my salad and my mac n cheese and I loved all my food.  The Smores' dessert was fantastic but I couldn't finish it - it was so big and super rich.  I highly recommend it if you have someone to share it with!  Atmosphere was dimly-lit and cozy.  TVs on and full bar available.  I hope to come here again soon!"
Samme L.,"Oxnard, CA",0,1,,1.0,3/20/2017,"If I could give 0 stars I would! First of all, we were seated by one of the hosts, we had 10 minutes of going through the menu and 5 minutes waiting for the 2 waiters (that had passed us 2x) to ask us if we wanted drinks. Waiters, bus boys, and front desk people passed our empty table. Worst of all the person that seated us, sarcastically to have a nice day. Worst BJs ever! Ps the shift supervisor was walking the floor and looked right in our direction in the non busy BJs."
Emily D.,"Woodland Hills, CA",51,5,,5.0,9/13/2016,Ray is the best server there! Very friendly and helpful. I love the chicken Alfredo and of course the pizza! The restaurant was clean and Teeny seems like a great manager!
Kym M.,"Westlake Village, CA",49,15,14,2.0,2/8/2017,Horribly long wait to get food...  the place is empty and there is no one to take our order....  now it's been another 45 minutes since we ordered and still no food...  wait staff is all clustered in the corner chatting... really frustrating!  An hour for a sandwich isn't worth it
Esther L.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,23,2,1.0,10/20/2017,"I usually only put comments if they are positive but I am so mad and disappointed!!!  We just moved to the neighborhood and we were very excited to have a BJ's close by. I will start by saying the menu and food are soooo good. BUT the service is soooo bad. Last week ( our first time) we were charged for a pizooki that was to come with the special of the night (which I ordered) free. We paid it thinking we made a mistake. Then last night we went again. My husband ordered the Thursday special and my dinner came out 15 minutes before his. Then we had a lengthy discussion with our waiter about the included mini pizookie. He didn't know how to put it in his little pad but learned how from the manager. Asked what kind my husband wanted THEN we waited 15 minutes but nothing came to our table except the bill. We couldn't get our waiters attention and it was so late due to such slow, bad service that my husband said ""let's go"" he left money for the bill and a 10% tip WHICH HE NEVER DID IN THE 40 YEARS.  He is always generous.  Love the food. Hate the service. If they don't train their servers better they will lose a lot of business. We are going to give it one more chance will refuse to sit in the area where our server was last night. He really was awful."
