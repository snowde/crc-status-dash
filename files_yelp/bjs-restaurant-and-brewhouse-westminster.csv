Kari C.,"Columbia, MO",62,17,1,4.0,7/30/2017,"Stopped in for a late night dinner on a Saturday night and the place wasnt too busy. We were seated right away and placed our drink order within a couple minutes. The waitress was very nice, as was the waiter who brought us our food.  My only complaint is that the chicken in my chicken pita tacos was a bit dry, but the food was really good. The place didn't blow away my expe tations, but the experience was nice."
Douglas F.,"Tiburon, CA",683,451,294,2.0,1/8/2018,"I've been to BJ's in several states. This location was not good.  The Service was average, 3 stars, wha5 you expect, but no more. The food was a flop. First time I've  not enjoyed the buffalo wings, they were poorly cooked and cold. The other dishes were also not hot and lacked flavor.  We won't visit this location in the future.  We like BJ's, just not this location."
Summer W.,"Westminster, CO",28,53,14,1.0,12/29/2017,"My husband and I ate here the other night and I got food poisoning from the flatbread nachos. We ate here in the past and didn't have good service and the food was nothing special and hadn't been back however, we went to go to Bonefish next door and it was closed so we decided to eat here very poor choice. I was so sick for 2 days. We will never step foot back in this place."
John K.,"Irvine, CA",61,100,732,4.0,6/29/2017,"I've been to several different BJs in California, but the deep dish pizzas here are a little different.  I've been to this location several times already whenever I'm in town, and the crust always comes out soft and more doughy, rather than crispy and crunchy that's almost like it's fried in oil.  I know it's all a preference of taste, but if you like the soft breadlike type crust, then you would enjoy it.  The avocado egg rolls here are just how they are at other locations and delicious!  Clam chowder is always good here... thick and hearty.  I usually use the BJs phone app to pre-order so that when I arrive, they start the cooking, but the last 2 times I've been there they seem to not find my order so I've had to put it through with the waitress again.  Anyways, can't go wrong with the food here for the most part!"
Erica F.,"Denver, CO",100,701,8,2.0,10/11/2017,"Really a pretty boring and bad chain restaurant. It's good for sports fans, there are tons of TVs (too many for my tastes.) Full of kids. When we were being seated, the host walked us by easily six empty two-top tables in a not-busy section, and attempted to to seat us next to a huge group of like 10 people with a bunch of kids. Oh hell no. For food, I got a bbq chopped salad and it was a huge mount of iceberg lettuce topped a thin layer of chicken and cheese.  Not worth the $15 price tag. The server was nice."
Todd A.,"Westminster, CO",45,165,38,5.0,9/20/2017,BJ's menu is gigantic you almost have too many options to choose from but once you get to know what's good it's not too bad at all. I love that they brew their own versions of sodas that the kids can have with unlimited refills this is a very nice option for families I do really like the root beer. Good fish tacos good salads and the cookies are awesome. We always love trying something new here and will be back again and again
Alice Q.,"Denver, CO",2578,1627,6800,4.0,10/24/2017,"I've been here a couple of times and I think it gets full super quick-- I can see why. They serve some of the best vanilla ice cream. I ultimately love the deep dish pizzas and also received super dee duper service at the takeout desk. The last time i was there, the guy offered me something to drink on him. It was wonderful."
Kevin L.,"Thornton, CO",33,81,9,3.0,2/12/2017,"This place has a good atmosphere, and some pretty good food too. The wait times are long on the weekend but they impliment a texting feature that lets you know when your table is ready. That's a nice touch that all places need. The staff is friendly and they have a good selection of beers and wines.  The food is pretty good, but the price is a little steep. We got two entrees, Steak and some sort of Shrimp Pasta, both got a pint of beer and a single appetizer and the bill was over $70 bucks. I wasn't disappointed in the quality of the food but I would expect a bigger piece of meat and some gravy on the mashed potatoes. The side salad is larger than expected which is nice, the Shrimp Pasta was alright, the sauce didn't taste like anything special but the shrimp was cooked how it should be. It wasn't gummy or under cooked. Just right. I'll go back for special occasions but not on the regular."
Johannah B.,"Westminster, CO",0,3,,5.0,10/13/2017,"This is our favorite place to grab food and drinks while enjoying whatever sport we want to watch on TV. The service is amazing; specifically Kai (sp...possibly Ky) is an amazing and attentive bartender along with Josh and Melissa F.   We always get great service including refilling water repeatedly!!  The menu is huge and will satisfy any craving I have on any night, which isn't an easy feat!  I highly recommend this BJ's as the customer service is always great with a large menu and drink selection!"
Chris L.,"Broomfield, CO",7,35,67,1.0,9/8/2017,"Worst service I've ever had. More than 20 tables empty but hostess refused to seat us anywhere but right on top of 5-top tables. Then ""couldn't find"" the manager when I wanted to complain."
Rob G.,"Henderson, CO",118,19,,1.0,1/16/2017,"Just ate lunch here and it was average at best. The worst part was that we waited an hour for our food. It was ridiculous. And even while we were waiting, we didn't get drinks and refills very often. Our waitress said that they got slammed all at once, but the restaurant was less than half full. I've had bad experiences like this a couple of other times, but this was the worst. To the manager's credit, she did discount our bill and gave us a free dessert. If the food was really good, it might have been ok, but it wasn't. I'm never going back."
Stu R.,"Lihue, HI",0,2,,3.0,9/2/2017,"Nice atmosphere, but some of the food was run of the mill. Had the Prime Rib Dip and won't order again as it is over priced for what you get. The fries are like anything you get elsewhere. On the plus side, the Flatbread Nachos were very good and a great light appetizer."
Mark H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",52,24,4,2.0,11/11/2016,"Great food but the service has much to be desired! Made reservations for a large party so you would expect they would be prepared. WOW, what a debacle! they didn't know what table any of the food was for, people who ordered first got theirs last, just bad service. Make sure you order your drink when your about half done cause it will be quite a while before it's delivered. Our waiter said the bartenders were upset at how busy they are. They have people waiting at the door to be seated and we've been waiting 20 minutes just for our checks.  You may want to try somewhere else if you're in a hurry."
Rachel N.,"Alta Vista Area, Arvada, CO",240,5,1,5.0,11/8/2017,Love this place every time I go I try something new they have a huge selection on the menu. The staff is very friendly as well.
Peter P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,35,37,5.0,4/3/2017,Really some of the best variety of food and surprisingly straight hit no miss taste. We've been here twice and each time have been quite impressed and we ordered nearly everything. Please read the reviews in detail  because reading a review concerned about wait time or lacking service is just downright ridiculous I'm here for good food and good drink I don't care about wait or how polite my waitress or waiter might be... This place seriously deserves a strong four to five star for food alone.
A Marie J.,"Broomfield, CO",633,228,158,1.0,8/30/2016,It's puzzling how these big corporate restaurants can slide downhill so much. This location is consistently bad.
Bohao Z.,"Westminster, CO",0,2,3,5.0,12/29/2016,"My colleague and me travelled here for a month and we almost come here to have lunch five times a week. It's a so good place to enjoy traditional American food like burgers or steaks, I love them so much!"
Eli M.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,22,13,5.0,9/14/2017,"Every restaurant has its ups and downs but this locations manager Tim went beyond to take care of us today! We ordered for the new delivery and after several mistakes on my end, the app not working the way I think it should, and the DoorDash coming up a bit short; Tim and his team were professional and worked hard to get our meal to us. If you have any issues, be patient and they will take good care of you!"
Nate D.,"Broomfield, CO",0,3,,3.0,1/14/2017,"A very large, loud, and busy facility with conflicting genre decor makes for leary first impressions. After arriving at 7:00pm for dinner, and waiting 17 minutes for a table for two to become avalible, we were greeted by a friendly attentive server. The service was excellent and eaised our reluctant attitude towards choosing this destination. Unfortunately,  the almost completely cooled off ribs I recived were very minamalistic in quantity and flavor. I was tempted to send them back, but the uncomfortable volume and atmosphere discouraged any prolonged stay. I do not plan to return."
Lynda B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,161,4,5.0,9/21/2017,"Hubby and I dropped in for a quick bite and adult beverages. Sat at the bar top and was waited on by Melissa. Took great care of us, enjoyed talking with her.  We enjoyed the dry rub wings and mini pizza.    Will be back, when in the area."
Amy S.,"Lancaster, PA",0,6,8,5.0,6/18/2017,"Amazing!!  You want fabulous service see Brandi and/or Crystal Ann. We've been going to this location for 4yrs, the whole time were lived in CO!  They cook to your liking.  I have food allergies (gf & lactose) for health reasons and they do a great job.  Love the quinoa bowls with fresh grilled salmon & mozzarella cheese & tomato salad.  You can't tell these waitress ever are having a bad day!! They're happy no matter how busy the resturaunt is!! Thank you for a great experience and wonderful food!!"
Shannon H.,"Westminster, CO",0,11,4,3.0,5/3/2017,Ok for food... lettuce was over its prime for freshness. Stuffed mushrooms were mediocre for warmth. Service was prompt and efficient... needed a bit more personality.  Large table next to us consumed much of our server's time. Very demanding... unfortunately for her. No toasted almonds on the beet and arugula salad... substituted what appeared to be pumpkin seeds.. no warning.
Amy D.,"Denver, CO",359,340,97,4.0,10/13/2015,"Not perfect, but way better than some of the other locations I visited. The guy and I did a late happy hour at BJs last week and it was really good. Our waitress appeared a bit nervous, but maybe she was just new. She was great about bringing our items and checking on us, so no complaints. The app sampler was just okay, but I highly recommend the roasted veggie/goat cheese flatbread. Huge portion and super tasty. Good drinks too. Solid spot."
Taylor G.,"Jupiter, FL",0,4,1,3.0,7/11/2017,The menu was just about ridiculous to read & our server seemed almost annoyed to be taking care of us but over all the food was pretty good!
Kathy H.,"Arvada, CO",0,7,,4.0,4/18/2017,"Love this place! The menu is extensive; if you can't find something you like, there is something wrong! The food is absolutely delicious, the atmosphere has an upbeat vibe, the service is good and it is always a great dining choice."
Brittnie H.,"Broomfield, CO",123,22,1,2.0,4/10/2017,"First of all, let me start by saying this review is not about the front of the house staff, they were great. However, the kitchen staff is a different story. When we received our mozzarella sticks they were ice cold, they hadn't even cooked them! I was sick to my stomach, our server was very apologetic and brought us out another plate for no charge. My boyfriend and I both ordered pasta that was cold and tasted like it had only just been reheated. Of course the beers on tap are always a good choice, but I think I'll have to take on dinner at BJ's next time, unless it's $3 Pizooki Tuesday."
A G.,"Arvada, CO",0,5,,2.0,4/2/2017,"My girlfriend and I usually go here specifically for the food.  Our most recent experience was awful.   Dishes were outright missing or severely skimping on main ingredients.  My reliable, go-to dish was overcooked and swimming in oil.  $70 later, we were still looking for somewhere to go for a satisfying meal. Two stars instead of one because our server was fast and friendly, but I won't ever go back if this is the new norm."
Amir H.,"Broomfield, CO",0,20,3,1.0,7/27/2017,"Got to the restaurant at 7:15 pm on Thursday night.  Got seated right away. Waited for 15 minutes, no server, no water, nothing."
Lance N.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,23,2,2.0,11/28/2016,"I can't provide a full blown review but, just another chain restaurant with poorly prepared food. Stopped in for a small bite. All I can say is that I don't recommend the Sriracha Brussel Sprouts(which was just a bowl full of burnt, salty tasting leaves, drenched in sauce. Everything on the menu looks like crappy food, covered in a overly salted sauce. Amy was great however."
Chris G.,"Kansas City, MO",244,531,54,4.0,9/7/2015,"What a pleasant surprise!! We ate in the bar to avoid the wait, but we loved the look of this bar (I'm a pushover for the darker wood theme). The food was absolutely delicious, especially the pizza. I was quite pleased that the server proactively ASKED if I wanted roasted tomatoes on my pizza or removed. :) THANK YOU! We'll be giving this location and/or chain another visit in the future!"
Christopher S.,"Minneapolis, MN",55,282,772,3.0,11/11/2015,"Went into BJs with a party of four.   Overall, they have good bar food.  Nothing our party had really knocked your socks off...it was good American food at a decent price.  The beers that they brew are really good, and I believe the main reason folks go to BJs...they have 4-5 of their own beers. We enjoyed some of their micro-brews at the bar and really liked the Red as well as the Brown Ales.   We sat down at a table and had good service, however, I always felt like I was being a bit rushed (ready to order?  We just sat down and the menu is at least 10 pages of drinks and food!).  We ordered the cheese dip and it was very good! Our party ordered burgers, a steak, and a tuna salad.  All were hot and fresh. The menu is quite large, full of American dishes.  Everything here was just fine, and reasonably priced. I'll definitely come back for happy hour and some apps!"
Kaylee W.,"Littleton, CO",0,1,,2.0,10/2/2016,"I went to BJ's to watch a Broncos game. I walked in and sat down at the bar. As soon as we sat down, a server walked up and began talking to the bartender and another server about how he was about to ""explode with hate"" and was apparently upset that people go to a bar to watch football. He complained about the tips he had received and he complained about people who stayed too long.  Overall, it was very off-putting. As a customer, it seems really inappropriate to know what other customers have tipped. I knew I was there to watch the game and had planned on, ordering a few beers and staying a while. I felt uncomfortable and moved to the other end of the bar. It's too bad that this guy kind of ruined the experience. The food was great and the beer selection was pretty good."
Marianne L.,"Boulder, CO",212,142,34,4.0,3/8/2016,"I'm guilty of eating here a few times a week. The Southern fried chicken is wonderful and dependable for deliciousness. It really does feel comforting. (Food coma style.) The menu is huge - you can find something for just about anybody. The service is hit or miss at times, but overall it's been good. The lunch menu is priced very well!!!  Dinner can get pricy but you get more food, like everywhere else.  The pizookies are awesome. The monkey bread is seasonal but give me just about anything covered in cinnamon and sugar and then leave me in a corner by myself. And don't look at me. It isn't pretty, but I'll be happy for the next year or two.  Overall they've mastered cooking chicken. I'm no chef but every time I cook chicken it's been hit or miss with tenderness and juiciness. Not here. My SO and friends have ordered other chicken dishes, and 9 out of 10 it's cooked perfectly. I need the secret!!  Perfectly!! Almost every time I tell myself to try something new, but the thought of buttermilk fried chicken on a bed of mashed potatoes and surrounded by a ring of corn kernels (ok I admit butter makes everything better) when I actually sit down is more than I can resist.  I don't often clean my plate (unless portions are small and I'm still hungry), but I have managed to clean it every time here. You will too."
Matt B.,"Rochester, NY",8,52,6,1.0,9/3/2015,"Very disappointed in the service. Tried making a group reservation to get together with family and wasted about 10 minutes with them beating around the bush before being transferred to Tim who said that they don't do group reservations on the weekends. We can do call ahead seating and... (I love this part)  Tim the manager: ""We don't really do groups on the weekends, but you can do call ahead seating. It doesn't guarantee a table as soon as you walk in the door, but...."" (I've heard this song before... I know better) Me: ""Well, Tim, how long would you expect the wait to be with call ahead seating?"" Tim: ""Well... you never know.... it could be 45 minutes to an hour"". Constructive feedback: Determine whether or not you accept group reservations, under what circumstances and follow a procedure. Total time wasted on this call: 15 minutes. Lame."
H A.,"Denver, CO",0,4,,1.0,1/21/2017,Ordered a skinny margarita and it was horrible! It was so sour I couldn't even drink it and sent it back. My food was over salted and the beans and rice had so much chili powder I couldn't eat half of it. There was about a half teaspoon of chili powder sitting on the edge of the plate. I would have said something to our waitress had she bothered to come back and check on us. She didn't come back until she brought the check - and charged us for the skinny margarita that was too disgusting to drink. She did take it off the bill after I pointed it out. This was our first time here. The food is definitely not worth the price. There are plenty of other restaurants in this area. I would recommend staying away from this one! We won't be back!
Melody S.,"Denver, CO",1,4,,1.0,1/17/2017,Should have known when the person seating us was having a fight with the server as were to seat us in an empty resturant that service was going to be bad. Very over priced for the lack of attention we received from the server. Felt like we were an imposition.
Tim S.,"Monument, CO",64,584,22,2.0,6/17/2015,"Service was decent, food was mediocre.  Reasonably certain that the hot wings weren't fried fresh but microwaved from a cooked state and tossed (quickly, not thoroughly) in sauce. Similar complaints regarding other entrees from our table."
Daniel H.,"Westminster, CO",44,46,32,4.0,3/5/2016,"I don't know why their average rating is 3 stars as this is definitely a four star experience, especially if you go to the bar!  The food is great, they have several vegetarian options, plenty of beer selections, everyone is friendly and helpful. I have  been here many times & I'd say it's recommended."
Carmen A.,"Colorado Springs, CO",20,11,3,5.0,11/20/2016,Thanks Tim for taking such good care of our Artistry in Motion Dance group. It's tough to accommodate 41 hungry  dancers and you and your staff nailed it. Thank You and your team for a  fabulous dinner.
Cait L.,"Littleton, CO",16,113,36,4.0,1/28/2016,"It's official, I'm obsessed with BJ's. This has got to be my favorite restaurant. This location has great wait staff, and the manager always seems to be walking around, checking on all the tables to see how their experience is going. However, the host/hostesses, in my opinion, are awkward! Really, every time I come in I feel like it takes them a good minute to realize there is someone standing there (I'm short... but I'm not THAT short), or they talk in groups amongst themselves while getting your menus together and then just walk away, assuming you'll follow I guess? That is my one and only gripe about this place.         We've tried their honey sriracha brussels sprouts, and BJ's original chicken wings as starters, and they are both super good. I could eat their brussels sprouts every day. We've enjoyed a variety of entrees, fish and chips (malt vinegar included, thank you BJ's), their enLIGHTened turkey burger, spaghetti and meatballs, and their chili is really good too! The menu is huge, and it's all delicious, so it's a great option to bring your picky relatives to, if they can't find something at BJ's...well, they're ridiculous people. Of course you can't forget about the amazing Pizookies for dessert, so yummy.        But the shining star that brings me back time and time again...is the Berry Burst Cider, folks, this is the real deal. It is perfectly tangy, just the right balance of sweetness, oh my gosh...it is just the bee's knees...and if you visit BJ's and don't give it a try, you're a foolish human! Just kidding, but really, it's a sin to not drink a Berry Burst or 3 while you're here ;) Looking forward to my next visit, awkward hosts and all. If I have a better experience walking through the doors next time, I will definitely update my review to 5 stars!"
