Michelle P.,"Broomfield, CO",61,178,25,3.0,4/19/2013,This is a good place for chain restaurant food and a good beer. The happy hour specials are pretty good. Most of the appetizers are half price. Drink specials are ok.  I come here frequently for HH since it is close to home.
Ericka S.,"Denver, CO",0,5,,1.0,4/18/2015,"If I could give this restaurant  0 stars I would.  Today family suggested we go there to celebrate our grandmas birthday and I was reluctant because the last time we came the service, food and beer was terrible! But we decided to give it another shot. However,  when they were trying to find silverware after we had our side salads sitting in front of us I knew we were in trouble.  The manager came out and said sorry but we are really busy. I know when you go to BBQ sometimes it's byob but I have never seen an invite with byos- bring your own silverware oh and don't forget your own napkins. The food is ehhh, service is terrible and the beer is nothing compared to some awesome breweries we have in the metro area! I suggest you save your $$$ for a place that takes care of the customer."
Bryan M.,"Arvada, CO",7,9,6,1.0,2/28/2015,It's been since I've been to Bj's. I was very disappointed with the service. We order wine with our meal and it showed up afterwards. The waiter seemed to ignore us. We order the avocado egg rolls and they looked like the avocados were already turning brown. This is our last time here.
Amy M.,"Denver, CO",0,12,3,2.0,8/18/2013,"The location is fine, the interior is well done, the waitstaff are friendly, the only issues is the food - and it's just typical american-chain boring food. Nothing that fantastic. My SO had the bacon cheeseburger. He asked for medium burger and they gave him a rare burger. A rare ground beef burger? Can you say intestinal parasites? That's like, cooking 101... NEVER eat rare ground beef.  I had the the Classic Baked Potato. Just a reminder that $7.95 for only a plain potato (NO sides) is not worth it... I would go against the calamari, it's literally straight out of a frozen bag from Walmart or something. The batter is so horrible and oily.  The burgers are huge, probably too much to eat all in one sitting, fair portions though. The most positive about this place would be the handcrafted sodas. The cream soda is ever better with whipped cream on top!"
Shanna K.,"Ypsilanti, MI",159,435,21,3.0,12/25/2012,"So I'm not going to even talk about the pizza here, because my personal beliefs prohibits me from believe deep dish to be pizza. That being said, they have a pretty ridiculously diverse menu here, including items good for gluten free folks and lots of vegetarian options. I love the avocado eggrolls and their watermelon feta salad...but found their spinach artichoke stuffed mushrooms to be a little bit meh. Home made root beer is good drink option for the non-drinkers, and I like their frou frou unlimited refill mocktails as well. Leo enjoys their beer selection bust says it isn't anything to write home about - given that there a lots of awesome microbrews in Colorado. All in all, a fun place to hang out, and it's definitely got better hours than  lot of other places - a good place to bring friends and they have some good happy hour deals as well."
Ed P.,"Cincinnati, OH",141,459,194,3.0,6/15/2011,"Last night I met up with one of my college roommates, Nick, at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse.  Though we haven't really stayed in touch, I still see him from time to time, though it had probably been a couple of years.  He has been doing some work related training in Boulder all week, so we decided to meet up for some drinks in Broomfield, which is between Denver and Boulder.  I remembered eating at the BJ's in Boulder a few years back, and suggested we meet there. Kim and I arrived to find Nick in the waiting area with a beer already in hand.  We grabbed a table for the three of us and started catching up.  Nick and Jessica have a son that is almost six months old, so we had lots to talk about, especially with our upcoming adventure into parenting.  I started with a Pumpkin Ale, my first of the season.  It was a little sweet for my liking at first, but the spicy pumpkin pie like finish brought me back for more.  It obviously wasn't my favorite beer ever, but it was an alright start to the night. For dinner, we decided to split two medium pizzas.  We ordered the vegetarian and the southwestern, with chipotle tomato sauce, spicy blackened chicken, green chilies, cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes topped with fresh cilantro.  The vegetarian tasted very much as I expected, but the southwestern was delicious!  The thick deep dish pizzas reminded me a little of Pizza Hut pizza, but much better quality.  I think it was the bubbly crust with a hint of grease that reminded me of the Hut.  However, the tomatoes were giant slices, and all of the fresh toppings were piled high. To round out the night I sampled both the Piranha Pale Ale and the Tatonka Stout.  I had the Piranha before and remembered it being a very solid pale ale with a great hop character.  The stout was the real surprise of the night, actually an imperial stout, with a nice spiciness at first, followed by a mellow balance of malt and hop that you'd expect from a stout.  It had much more flavor than I was expecting, and I would definitely order it again.  I enjoyed these beers over continuing conversation with my old friend.  We both agreed that we needed to get together more often.  To make it easier to stay in touch, I tried to convince him to join Facebook, but he has no interest.  Oh well, I'd rather meet for beers anyway."
Josh H.,"Golden, CO",85,16,,3.0,12/19/2014,"Went here just for drinks but found they have an impressive menu; it has everything! Pizza, steaks, hamburgers, salmon are just a few items from their variety. I found that much of their items were a bit pricey for a brewery/restaurant.  The beer was pretty  good as well."
kari b.,"Fort Collins, CO",9,107,42,1.0,3/8/2013,"Is zero stars an option? I have to say I was disappointed to see this place go in, but gave it a try, twice. It was marginal at best. Soggy lettuce, overdressed salads and generally un-fresh, over processed and very unsatisfying. Then, my potential two star review went way down after my husband brought three clients here (per their choice) and all of them got FOOD POISONING from the tuna appetizer that they shared. This is shameful."
Jessica C.,"Forest Park, IL",0,12,6,5.0,4/30/2016,"I'm from Chicago and on a trip I stopped here to eat with my family. We were seated right away on a busy Friday night, and had ordered our food and drinks a few minutes later. The menu has many options and I believe there's something for everyone there. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with the mashed potatoes and broccoli. Absolutely delicious. The chicken was crispy yet so juicy inside. And the lemony cream sauce on top is just fantastic. My husband had the rib eye also with potatoes/broccoli. He said the steak was well seasoned and easy to chew (not tough like other places) and cooked just how he asked. Needless to say he finished the entire plate. My toddler had a kids meal which he picked at and ate a little here and there, which is the usual because he's a picky toddler all of a sudden. But he did tell me the fries were very yummy. The chocolate chunk pizookie was spectacular! Fresh baked cookie with ice cream on top, simplicity makes this one so good. The only thing I would skip are the fruity cocktails. I ordered the watermelon basil margarita and I expected some fresh watermelon in there. It does say puree, but I'm pretty sure it was some type of syrup. It didn't taste like real watermelon and it gave the drink a syrup like consistency. The signature margarita is much better. The reason for the 5 starts instead of 4 was our server Tyler. He was the best! Informative, nice, always checked on us. That is the kind of server all restaurants need. Thanks for a good dinner BJ's."
Steven Z.,"Denver, CO",18,237,36,4.0,6/19/2013,I love the pizza here and the consistency I get when I come here. Its nice to see a kitchen being able to put out the same quality every time I come.  Service has always been great too.   My favorite:  a Blonde or a brunette. I mean BREWNETTE.... w/ a pepperoni pizza w/o tomato's on top.
Demitria M.,"Denver, CO",74,124,147,2.0,4/16/2013,"A friend and I recently went to BJ's for a late dinner. We sat in the bar, our server seemed a bit rushed so we didn't mind things taking longer then normal, however it took 25 mins before our beers came out, then another 20 for her to take our order. She wasn't the friendliest person in the world, but I can understand everyone has an off day. The ending to the experience was a cold dinner that came out. Sorry but I don't think I'll be making anymore trips here."
Phil G.,"Denver, CO",7,196,1,4.0,10/8/2014,"We are new to up North and exploring new places. We stopped at Bj's on the way to the movies. We liked it a lot so we have already been back. Great food, great beer and great prices during happy hour. Service was a little slow to take our order and get our drinks both times but after that it seemed ok. We had a manager come to our table the second time and she was funny and nice. One thing I really enjoyed was that the server brought us samples of the seasonal beers and that was great for us to taste before we ordered a full glass. But the pumpkin was a little to nutmeggy for my taste but was good to try.  But over all we will continue to go back."
Mark S.,"Terminal D/Remote Parking, TX",0,1,,3.0,10/24/2014,The new tavern pizza?? It is a giant flat bread and flimsy in the middle. What happened to the hand tossed?
Carissa J.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4,21,1,1.0,9/30/2014,I've enjoyed this place on occasion but the consistency is less than impressive. The pizza with extra cheese barely had enough cheese to cover one piece. Extremely disappointing. Trying to get a pizza the way I'd like it here is nearly impossible.
Dan G.,"Chicago, IL",30,164,2,2.0,8/26/2014,"So, I have seen Michael Ferguson's show Beer Geeks a few times.  And they always advertise BJ's Restaurant, which he is Director of Brewing and Beer Training.  And I thought, yea, this dude knows what he is doing right?  Wrong, this place is like Friday's or Applebee's but with their 'own' beers.  The beer is okay, not horrible but nothing I would ever buy in a store.  The food tastes like it was frozen and thawed, nothing inspired, just generic food.  The service was slow, I could tell the waiter was new, but he seemed pretty incompetent about the menu and that is the management's fault.  So Michael, you may have cool show that entices the viewer with awesome beer and food but you really need to look at your restaurant, my man, it is the pits."
Kevin D.,"Broomfield, CO",67,12,2,4.0,9/3/2013,"Whenever we go out with friends I always suggest going to B.J's. Their menu is very diverse and they also have a small gluten free menu of items. But, if you are like me and like your steak, I would suggest heading over there and trying them out.   Their portions vary depending on what you get, but all around a great family restaurant."
Amie B.,"Westminster, CO",70,44,1,1.0,10/7/2014,"Food is good. Service...not so much. Walked in & weren't greeted. Hostess was off talking in the corner & it took her 3 or 4 minutes to even come over to seat us. Not a good start. Our waiter was MIA for 10 minutes. He was MIA off and on the whole time. We weren't the only ones with a waiter who was MIA. They weren't busy so, I wonder what was keeping them from giving good service. Only answer I have is...their social lives. Not impressed at all. Will we be back? Maybe but, won't be our first choice."
Nicolo D.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3,150,1,4.0,3/29/2013,"Great pizza, OK prices.  Love the Pizzookie.   My one complaint is that the whole place smells very much like beer.  This might be great for some, and it's expected given that they're also a brewery, but I've never enjoyed the dorm-room hallway Chic."
Adam H.,"Denver, CO",15,22,,2.0,5/20/2012,"Definitely a BJ to forget... Atmosphere: Good for after work drinks,etc. And by etcetera I mean that's about it.  Food: Ugh...the menu is impressive, but the food was not. The mushroom appetizers tasted like they were warmed up the day before. The side salad was cheaply made. And finally the pizza that the server raved about was offensive. In fact it pissed us off and our dogs barely choked it down. The most flavorful thing we had there was the toothpick on the way out. Drinks: Pretty good berry burst cider and root beer.  Service: friendly. Final Verdict: Spit but don't swallow here."
Jared H.,"Broomfield, CO",0,50,,1.0,3/10/2013,"Horrible!!! Canned broccoli soup. Ordered burger medium and it was burned beyond recognition. Kis mac & cheese looked and tasted three days old. Jeremiah red beer was good.  Service was terrible,  slow,  dropped bill without offering desert. Wont go back."
