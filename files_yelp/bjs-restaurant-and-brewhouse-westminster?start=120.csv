Cielo G.,"Denver, CO",0,407,83,3.0,2/17/2013,Ahi tuna salad was quality. Typical brewhouse atmosphere and noise level: loud.
Krista H.,"Broomfield, CO",32,196,64,4.0,10/20/2012,"We go here often because it is close. We like microbrews so it is fun to try the seasonals here. Their happy hour lasts a little longer than most and is decent ($1 off beers, 1/2 price apps and pizzas) so we meet here for work outings a lot. Must say the lunch soup and flatbread is one of the best deals - highly recommended the tortilla soup. Good anytime place or football night place."
Todd B.,"Arvada, CO",0,13,,4.0,4/16/2015,I was a regular for happy hour twice per week up until last week when they ended their awesome happy hour food specials. Boooo.   They still have decent lunch specials at good prices.  Good service all around.
Victor B.,"Lodo, Denver, CO",22,208,9,3.0,3/3/2014,This was my first visit to BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse and it was good for the simple Sunday lunch for which we selected it.  I had a simple BJ's burger with bacon and cheese and it was cooked deliciously.  The pickle slices were crisp and the lettuce and tomato nice and fresh.  My girlfriend had a french dip type sandwich and it looked tasty as well (I did not try her entree).  The wedge fries are tasty and plentiful and the staff is very cordial.
David R.,"Westminster, CO",0,29,1,2.0,12/11/2013,"The food here is... No, it's pretty poor. I was going to say something redeeming because I really like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt. But honestly, I can handle poor food if I have great service.  I wish that was the case. The bartender that was waiting on my side of the bar had some serious snark about her. I don't care who you are, nobody deserves snark except a fellow uppity snarker. And I try very hard to be pleasant, accommodating, and understanding in every aspect of my life. I can't be that way with a snob.  They screwed up my order twice. And then the manager comes out and she gives me major attitude. She made me feel like it was my fault that the kitchen messed up my order. I was understanding and easy-going about it, because it's just food. My problem was with the tone she took with me. Like my dining request was completely unreasonable. Anyway. Never going back. I have no space in my life for cancerous attitudes."
Greg H.,"Aurora, CO",72,334,81,1.0,12/27/2011,"I've had a couple of mediocre experiences here before, but obviously being there on Christmas Eve isn't a good time to hope for mediocrity. Our waiter didn't give half a rats @s$ if we were there or not.  Five of us ate there for Christmas Eve dinner after a long day of traveling because nobody wanted to cook at home pending the HUGE Christmas dinner to come the following day. BJ's was the only restaurant within 20 miles open beyond 6pm, so that's where we went. Our server didn't clear one single cup, dish, or empty platter from our table for the entire meal of multiple appetizers, dinners, and desserts. Every plate came out cold on the outside and dried like it sat under a heat lamp for 15+ mins before being served, and everything, beer included, was flat. When asked about the lack of carbonation, our server was kind enough to tell us, ""Well if it's pouring like that now, it's going to be pouring like that all night, and there's nothing that I can do about it."" When asked if the dates available for certain soups was a ""hard schedule"" or not, his response was,""Even if I wanted to get you that, we don't even have it in the building right now."" This might've been true, but probably not. It was just as simply put to say no or I'm sorry. Maybe a little personal skills training would go a LONG way for the staff here."
Joe J.,"Denver, CO",68,474,93,3.0,6/4/2012,"We ate here this weekend for lunch.  It was neither good nor bad.  It was average.  Everything was average, well except for the price. I really don't mind paying alot for a really good meal and good service.  Our waiter was a bit older of a guy, and he just seemed uninterested.  Just about every time he came by to check on us, he would be saying something as he walked away.  We literally would have a laugh about it when he was out of ear-shot.   We shared an appetizer of Avacado Egg Rolls.  They were, well, average.  I wasn't blown away by them or the accompanying sauce.  For $10, they were not worth it.  We also shared a pizza.  I actually really liked the pizza, and the way they sliced the mushrooms that went on it.  I don't always care for the huge slices you get at the chain-type pizza joints.  These mushroom were thinly sliced and were not dominant to the slice.  Thumbs up.   Basically, I'd rate this higher if the whole meal cost us about 20% less and if our main server was as good as the two other people who gave us occasional service.  I might consider going back when I'm in the area again, but with other solid options in the area, this place has to do more.   The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice, but our booth had leather seats, and the leather on my seat was slightly cracking and about 100 butts from tearing and needing replace.  A couple tweaks here and there, and the rating would go up, but I can't rate this place more than a 3."
Diane G.,"Westminster, CO",0,4,,2.0,7/28/2014,"Great food. LOUSY SERVICE I have come here many times.  I even belong to their club. Love the french dip, cajun pasta, fish tacos yum!!  Each visit I kept making excuses that it was an off day.  It isnt.  There obviously is management trouble to allow the servers this kind of behavior.  The host stand acted like we were bothering them when we came in. They werent even busy ... I now know why... 25 minutes after we ordered  we got our iced tea.  45 min later I got my soup and salad.  I had to ask for crackers.  15 minutes later when I was at the last bite I finally got my 1 little package of crackers for my soup... supposed to be unlimited.  I asked for more soup and  I finally got it... with the check and everyone else was done.  And no crackers..  We asked for refill on our tea... still waiting...who is watching this place??"
Bobbi G.,"Westminster, CO",0,25,3,1.0,5/26/2015,"This USED to be our all time favorite restaurant. About 6 weeks ago we had a mystery Avocado Egg Roll appetizer. Don't know what was in it!!! the waitress made it good with a comp dessert. :) Tonight however we were seated and two waitresses in the area and neither greeted us. After about 10 minutes we flagged one down and she said she was not helping us, the other gal would.  Okay... then we decided to time them and after another 10 minutes we would leave. 7 minutes later the gal stopped by to ask if we had been helped.  The thing was she passed us by and helped tables on either sides of us and ignored us. We ordered drinks and dinner while we had her attention. the drinks came and our dinner arrived 25 minutes later.  All was good with the food but drink refills were NEVER offered! I finally was able to get her attention and asked for iced tea which came when we were done with our dinner.  THEN we asked for our check and she passed us by several times so when she did bring the check we made her take our card because we needed to leave. It took us an hour and a half for 2 of us to stop in to have a salad and iced tea."
Ken K.,"Denver, CO",35,335,11,3.0,5/31/2011,"In the company of Bonefish Grill and Colorado Hacienda, BJ's is par for the stripmall course: a chain pizza restaurant that has ""Santa Fe spring rolls"" on the menu -- which aren't bad if you've never been to Santa Fe or had a real spring roll. On the same night as the Santa Fe whatever-the-fuck rolls, I also tried a BBQ pulled sandwich, which consisted of a huge helping of slow-cooked pork, deep fried onion matter, and high fructose corn syrup that had been erroneously labeled on the menu as ""BBQ sauce."" (Maybe it's supposed to be Kansas City style. And maybe BJ's Corporate things Kansas City puts absolutely nothing but sugar in its BBQ sauce. Maybe that.) But it's not all bad. From past experience both at this location and in Boulder, I can say with confidence that if you stick to what BJ's knows and does well, you'll go home happy. Try a calzone with artichoke hearts and feta, or a pizza -- deep dish if you like pizza that's easily confused with casserole. And do try the P.M. Porter. It is, dare I say, quite good."
Al Z.,"Boulder, CO",0,3,,2.0,6/24/2014,"I'll simply repeat what was already said. Terrible, terrible terrible service. I've been here twice in the past year after a movie. Not worth it. Two different waiters had the same problem. Eyes rolling, attitude problem, not wanting to DO THEIR JOB. I'm supposed to tip this? What a bunch of bull crap. Go to one of the other restaurants nearby. This one doesn't want your service."
Denver D.,"Denver, CO",4,72,,1.0,3/15/2013,Horrible. My waitress added an additional tip on my credit card which i left a cash tip for. The manager randee davies said she would send me a gift card for the mix up which she never kept her word on.   Here it is two months later and i was still over charged. Still never got a gift card.  And still being lied to about ever getting one.  Randee davies lied to me and never made things right i will NEVER return to a place that does bad business.  I told her i just wanted my 4.00 back at this point and she never responded.  I never got it back. Never go here!!!!!!!!!!
Rachel C.,"Denver, CO",39,46,9,3.0,1/30/2014,"I am completely indifferent about this place. I drive by every day after work, so I decided I meet a friend for drinks and dinner. Their happy hour is only applicable in the bar area, and I still ended up paying six bucks for my beer. There is a good beer list to choose from, but not the greatest prices. As for dinner, we had a server who was somewhat pushy about getting us to order, and was completely nonexistent to our table once the food came out. BJ's has an overwhelming menu which I didn't feel like thumbing through so I just ordered a specialty burger. They offer your choice of string and wedge fries (I recommend the wedge) and my burger was delicious! I won't be returning simply because if the fact that there are other chain restaurants who mimic the style of BJ's I would rather give my money to."
Brandi F.,"Fremont, CA",35,159,63,3.0,7/13/2011,"Not the biggest fan of their pizza. The first time we went here, the pizza wasn't done inside and the toppings were minimal. They remade the pizza without hesitation, but the second pizza still didn't taste good. The manager gave us a voucher to come back and have a meal on the house. Luckily we took her up on her offer, because their burgers are pretty good. They're not crave-worthy, but they're definitely worth a try.  They also have some pretty good micro-brews and root beer that is made in-house. I love tasty beverages! It gets a little loud in this restaurant and the staff are sometimes unprofessional (joking and flirting with each other in front of customers, complaining about their shifts and tables,...), otherwise I would've given 4 stars."
Tom W.,"Broomfield, CO",1,22,4,5.0,3/16/2014,BJ's is excellent. Good food and good beer. Desserts are very good too. I would definitely recommend. Much better than the other similar chain restaurants.
Liz M.,"Arvada, CO",0,1,,3.0,5/10/2014,"My husband and I frequent this spot close to once a week, maybe once every other week.  We make it a point to only sit at the bar top because that is the only place you will get good service.  We made the mistake of sitting in the dining area with family one time and were appalled at the slow service and the non-existent happy hour.  That's right, you only get the perks of happy hour if you are sitting in the bar. We really like the food, but they have recently gotten rid of some of our favorite options. Some of these items are still available if you ask, which is nice, but some are gone forever. Why would you get rid of the red velvet pizookie??? Although I like this place, I'm being honest with what you can expect.  Great service at the bar top, poor/slow service everywhere else.  Huge menu, expect to have your favorite removed soon.  Prices are ok...happy hour is the time to go.  1/2 off of apps and mini pizzas.  But remember, that is only if you are in the bar. Finally, the beer on happy hour is more expensive than the beer during lunch hour.  Just seems strange to me.   I realize that this review might be harsh, but it's only fair for you to realize what you are getting into."
Chris S.,"Aurora, CO",14,37,,5.0,3/14/2013,My GF and I ate there on the 9th of March after a major snow storm in the Denver area.  We were served prompt even though the server was very overwhelmed do to at least 3 restaurants were closed in the area.
Shannon D.,"Denver, CO",29,85,7,2.0,7/22/2013,Not great service.  My gent did not get what he ordered appropriately. Nor was the food anything special.  Not a fan!
Jeremiah Y.,"Westminster, CO",5,10,3,2.0,10/19/2013,Mediocre food at very slow speeds. Menu is large and so so quality. Beer is not good. Takes about an hour to get soup and salad and a pizza.
Sarah P.,"Temecula, CA",101,293,23,5.0,12/3/2012,"I really liked this BJs. First,  they have some of the best gluten free pizza. Also, they have gluten free pazookie! So many restaurants forget to include a gluten free dessert option, and this one is soooooo good. Our server's name was Ali and she was really nice and helpful, but not annoying or pushy. Her service was definitely appreciated. We'll definitely go back."
