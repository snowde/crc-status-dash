Lisa R.,"Denver, CO",2,20,,3.0,8/24/2011,"I'm generally not a fan of places with laminated, spiral-bound menus (well, that's a lie I love cheesecake factory), but the parmesan crusted chicken with white cheddar mashed potatoes here is pretty fantastic. Just go and order that and the porter and you'll do just fine. (order anything else and all bets are off)"
Tyler B.,"Denver, CO",0,3,1,5.0,11/25/2013,"The bartenders there are awesome. Every single one of them work as a team and take care of you. Whether you're just grabbing a drink or having food at the bar, expect to enjoy the service."
Catherine C.,"Lafayette, CO",7,8,,2.0,11/13/2013,My family came in at 5/7 a busy dinner rush however we had more than one server which was confusing I give 2 stars because they handed our food rather than putting it in the table. Wtf? I pay for 6 people the bill is going to be high you don't hand me my food. If I wanted someone to hand me my food I would have cooked at home. Also the waiter didn't come around fast enough( menus folded to show we are ready). Lastly the food. When you order a salad with bacon we expect tons of bacon!! Poor service and quality for the atmosphere. However beer was good. I expected more. With a party of 6 I expected better.
Peter M.,"Denver, CO",492,746,83,3.0,5/30/2008,"I was disappointed too.  When my colleague asked if I wanted to get some BJ's at lunch, I thought, ""hey, hit up Colfax on our lunch hour?  Why not?"". Turns out it's just a restaurant. Still, the service was quick, and they do brew their own beers - which are pretty darn tasty at noon on a Thursday.  It's just fine for a reasonably priced lunch spot. I'm not sure that I'd be inclined to dine there in the evening, as it's just not dinner caliber consumables.  Unless of course dinner came with..."
Kimberly M.,"El Paso, TX",2,65,,1.0,9/29/2014,"Horrible. I love BJs but this place is horrible. We went for lunch ordered our kids there meal at 1115. At 1220 it still wasn't ready. We ordered ours at 1145 because we couldn't find our waitressand we got ours at 1230. My plate was caked with food and it was served to me with food on it. My husbands chicken was dry and cold . The manager said we are busying that is why the lack of quality and wait times , not at 1115 when there was 10 people here.  So it is not a place to come for lunch or any other time."
Willie B.,"Westminster, CO",118,345,395,2.0,1/2/2011,"I come here at least once or twice a month and get the clam chowder bread bowl. Today was no different except for the clam chowder in the bowl. Today my bread bowl wasn't even filled half way with soup and was super over baked. So crunchy I couldnt even finish.    This is the exact reason the person who takes your order should bring your order.  That being said, it still the order takers job to make sure everything comes out correct.   Very disappointed today but I guess you can't get good service everytime. Just 1-5 is your best bet. And to top it all off my seven year old puked in the lobby on the way to the bathroom. The food was good just not enough of it  for my money this time."
AJ Q.,"Denver, CO",8,72,8,4.0,6/14/2012,One of the best gluten free pizzas I've had. The crust was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. They have a gluten free ice cream cookie that is pretty good too. Their root beer is also very delicious.
Erica R.,"Ava, MO",0,58,1,4.0,8/30/2013,I went to this one first because I was meeting a friend coming down from Boulder so this seemed like a good spot to go to. We had a blast trying as many things as we could. Raspberry Chocolate beer was awesome.
Samantha S.,"Denver, CO",105,343,36,4.0,2/3/2011,"We come here ... a lot.  Whenever co-workers come in from our Ohio office ( there are no BJ's there)... this is their place to go. Tonight there were eight of us.  Three of us started in the bar area until the rest of our group showed up.. They were VERY accommodating when we decided that the bar area was to small and we would need a table in the dining area. Most people like the beer, I prefer the Strawberry Splash (Grey Goose Vodka, Disaronno Amaretto and Piña Colada mix blended and served with a splash of strawberry.).... Yum... tastes just tooo good and I often drink more than i should!  But  YUM. We started off with appetizers...calamari and some spinach dip... it was gone within minutes.... so that is a good sign. I got the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes... one of my favorites.  My neighbor got a steak.... we shared... DELICIOUS :) Everyone was satisfied, and we had a great time,.... great atmosphere.... friendly service..... then came dessert.... the #1 reason my peers stated they wanted to come here.... We ordered 3 different types of Pizookie.... Triple Chocolate, Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Chip Cookie... and there was enough for us to pass around the table and share!  Everyone sat back, happy, satisfied, and definitely ready to come back again ....."
Chizzie L.,"Denver, CO",18,90,5,5.0,11/11/2012,"Too bad, i can only give 5 stars. This place is worth 10 stars. They've always been good to me and my family. The food is awesome. The Arnold Palmer, is the best I've ever had. The wait staff is second to none. The only problem i have with this place is I can live there..LOL. I would recommend this place to everyone."
Florin Z.,"Santee, CA",0,9,,5.0,3/13/2014,"I don't usually eat at this place but I am traveling and wanted a pizza and a beer. The place was crowded and I was ready to leave... fortunately I had nice waitress, Mackenzie, who was knowledgeable, fast and positive. She made me have a great experience... The pizza and dessert were very good also. I might even go back."
Mo C.,"Denver, CO",528,804,72,4.0,10/21/2010,"I love this chain! BJ's is like a Cheesecake Factory and Brewery, rolled into one. Yes, they are a brewery that actually has good food! And, they are a brewery that carries beers other than those they brew. So, craft brew junkies and coors light diehards now have a place where they can co-exist! Be aware, this is the kind of place that only does Happy Hour specials/pricing in the actual bar area. We were able to work out a deal with our server and the manager so that we got our first round & appetizers for the happy hour price, but I think that is much more the exception than the rule. HH is $1 off BJ's beers, $2 off appetizers and half price mini-pizzas. I snagged the Ahi Tuna Poke, the Pumpkin Beer & the Nutty Brewnette. All three were fabulous! The Poke was served with avocados and pita chips, which was weird, but good. The Pumpkin Beer is the best I've had this season, nice flavor and not flat like so many pumpkin beers can be. And, the Nutty Brewnette is one of my personal favorites (not just because I am one). The kitchen was slow, so it felt like it took quite a while to get our food. But, the restaurant was pretty packed. And, it was pretty fantastic that our server was willing to do separate checks for everyone at our table of 12, but that of course takes time as well, so we felt like we were sitting around for some time after we had all finished. So, this is not the kinda place to go if you are in a hurry, it's the kinda place to kick back and have a few, really good, beers."
Adam H.,"Stapleton, Denver, CO",0,4,,2.0,8/7/2014,"Won't be back after my first and only experience. It started with the host. I called ahead since there was gonna be 8 of us. The host I talked to (young woman, forgot her name) sounded as if I was inconveniencing her and didn't even say goodbye or anything, just hung up after I spoke to her. After we arrived and got seated (the host was still unpleasant and didn't smile at all), our server was nice and attentive for the most part. The food is a big reason why we won't be back. My order came out wrong and my Brussels sprouts were dry and inedible, one person had an avocado stem in her tortilla soup and someone else ordered the chicken fried steak that was chewy and bland (I tried a bite)  I must admit though that the manager on duty was very nice and understanding. I just feel there is way too many better restaurants in the area to have to settle for BJ's restaurant again. Maybe the pizza would change my mind but won't be anytime soon if at all."
Shanonn H.,"Broomfield, CO",12,17,,3.0,3/31/2012,"The avocado eggrolls were awesome. Downside, for a friday night that wasn't very busy our waitress sure was flaky. And our brownie wasn't cooked all the way, covering it in a mountain of whipped cream didn't help either."
Chris B.,"Richland, WA",65,33,11,5.0,9/10/2009,"Crazy Name, but you'd be crazy not to eat there. Nobody has much to say that is bad, so why the low star ratings?  We were recently on vacation in the Denver area, and brought to BJs by family ... wow was this place good (and affordable).  BJs brews their own beer and it is very good.  I had the seven beer sampler (seven 5oz beers - one of each of their custom brews) - $10, and the beef dip sandwich $10.  My wife had the Asian tai grilled shrimp, also $10.  Both were EXCELLENT.  The ambiance is kind of like a fancy, wood paneled sports bar and the service was good.  What else can I say?  Nothing to complain about -... everything was perfect.  I highly recommend it."
Jennifer P.,"Arvada, CO",4,22,,2.0,1/11/2014,"The first time I visited, we went on a Friday during the lunch hour. The hostess seemingly forgot to mention our presence to our waiter because we sat for 15 minutes without recognition. It wasn't until we went up to the hostess stand and asked for service, until we got any. They were apologetic at first, but the service didn't improve. My meal was wrong and my mom's soup was cold when it arrived. They had a diverse menu, so I wanted to bring my husband back. I chalked up the first visit to ""a bad first impression."" I took my husband back a few weeks later and we had a decent experience. They were very busy, but we were adequately attended to. Food, again, below my standards. We were shopping in the area a few weeks later and decided to give it one more chance. That was a mistake! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger - one of their new menu items since they reduced the menu to half of what it was. When it finally arrived, I was shocked. It was crumbled ground beef on lettuce and looked inedible. Plus, they forgot the cheese and bacon! When I brought this oversight to our waitress, she was apologetic and said she'd be right back with bacon and cheese. I didn't think, for one second, that she would actually come back with cheese and bacon on a plate. I figured she had misspoken and would be back with a fresh, correct, bacon cheeseburger. Nope. She actually expected me to put cold cheese and bacon on some crumbled ground beef. When I told her I wanted a new burger, she took mine away and brought a new one out 10 minutes later. They comped the burger, but still charged me for the plate of cheese and bacon that I didn't even eat. We won't be back. They've proven that they don't take their business seriously and hire incompetent hostesses and wait staff."
Tracy A.,"Denver, CO",113,236,11,2.0,7/28/2009,"Don't order a salad. If you must eat here, get a sandwich or something cooked that's more safe and traditional at a place like this. The lettuce was rotting -- but what are you going to do in the middle of a business lunch, send back your salad? Mario L's haiku is the perfect review for this place. Better to have a beer and wings with a friend than meet business associates at BJ's."
Danny L.,"Westminster, CO",3,46,5,4.0,5/11/2010,"I'm not sure why the rating is currently only three stars.  I assume it's because the clientele can be of the ""walmart ilk"" and somebody didn't get their free meal when they bitched about something ridiculous. Yeah, at first look it first appears to be your typical sports pub/restaurant, but it's definitely a step or two above. First of all, they've got George Nelson bubble lamps! [he-he] The Tatanka Stout is freakishly delicious and locally brewed.  So for starters, BJ's is actually a brewery (as the name suggests), not just a sports bar. Since Nine75 North closed, this has been our most frequent local haunt.  They stay open late (as late as anything around here stays open), they're consistent, they've got a full bar, good wine selection, GREAT beer selection (including their own brews), and the food is waaaaaay above your Chili's/TGI Fridays/Ruby Tuesday type places. I LOVE the Santa Fe salad and the chili cheese fries are DELICIOUS.  My wife swears by the shrimp tacos.  We're pretty snobby about food, and feel confident in saying: if you don't go in thinking your going to be eating like you're at Bistro 1010 or The Med, you won't be disappointed!"
Jisha J.,"St. Charles, IL",19,119,,4.0,3/15/2012,"I've been to this place several times and I've always had a good experience here. It is not necessarily a cheap meal, but overall it's good food. I have tried several of their salads, and they have all been really good. Their pizza is pretty tasty, but I don't think it's all that special. What I love the most is their pizookie desserts. My boyfriend and I will stop by here sometimes for their cookies n' cream pizookie. It's absolutely delicious with a warm, gooey chocolate cookie with this ""cookies n' cream"" cream on top along with whipped cream."
Ed E.,"Saint Louis, MO",24,38,6,1.0,11/8/2011,"Service was good. Food sucked. Fish tacos made with fried frozen fish and the guacamole was soooo sad. Worst part is that I asked if it was good before I ordered it.  You win some, you lose some. I lost."
