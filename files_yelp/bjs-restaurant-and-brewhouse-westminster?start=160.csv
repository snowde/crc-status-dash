Richard B.,"Arvada, CO",0,5,,2.0,5/17/2014,Food is fine but the restaurant is filthy. The floor is littered with trash and your shoes stick to it. Nasty!!!  Very disappointing.
Mario L.,"Aurora, CO",39,76,4,2.0,12/8/2008,"BJ's - a Haiku Cookie Cutter Food All beneath a garage door Deep fry that salad BJ's is a typical fat American restaurant. You can get any of the 500 items on the menu all on a giant plate and covered in ranch or BBQ sauce. You know, just like chili's or potts or champs or whatever.  Don't get me wrong, its not bad. Its just the same as the rest of them. Sometimes its a good time to go out and grab a beer and some wings. This is one of those places.  If you go in not expecting much you wont be disappointed."
Stacey B.,"Chicago, IL",92,211,11,1.0,4/20/2011,"it was close to the homegoods store so we unfortunately decided to eat here.  first, their lightly breaded is nothing close to light. more like a thick shell of fried greasy crust.  second, i ordered the fish tacos which were described as having a light panko breading. it had the same sick breading as the artichoke appetizer, which i peeled off. basically, it wasn't a typical fish taco you would expect. it was like they took a frozen fish stick, battered it even more and threw it on a taco. it was sick and not that much fish either. i really hate sending back food. it embarrasses me, the person i'm with and it's probably not pleasant for the server either. so after one bite, i sent it back. third, i ordered a flatbread margarita pizza. it came out swimming in grease. from the cheese maybe? i don't know, but one napkin was literally dripping after soaking some of it up.  fourth, my partner ordered a burger medium well and it came out pretty raw.  fifth, i almost couldn't make it home due to the fact that my colon was rejecting the little bit of the food i actually ate there. my sympathies go out to the other yelper who had the same problem."
Josh P.,"Westminster, CO",33,178,6,2.0,11/29/2008,"I fret over these stars like my finger is on the red button or something. I think that Hector's review sums it up for me really. I didn't dislike this place, it was just another all things to all people restaurant/bar. I gave it three stars and deducted a star mainly because different people visited our table delivering various items meaning that they had to do what I call ""auctioning off our food"", that is they called out each thing they were delivering hoping one of us would claim it. That really annoys me."
Casey C.,"Denver, CO",72,385,18,4.0,11/15/2011,"I love a good brewery and this does not disappoint. Quality price, good portions, good beer. What more do you need? Don't forget to try the clam chowder."
Keith H.,"Broomfield, CO",18,14,,3.0,12/19/2011,"I love the Parmesan crusted chicken. Pretty much my pick out of the menu.  There are also several beers they make I enjoy. Typically, I don't like places with big menus. Food doesn't tend to be as fresh and everything is mediocre. I enjoy it for an occasional meal & beer under $20."
Doug H.,"Knoxville, TN",0,22,,3.0,5/15/2013,"Regular pizza dough had consistency of croissants (very light fine texture), calzone had similarly light dough. Food was hot temp wise and not as bland as some other chain restaurants but not distinctive other than the purity/clarity lack of aftertastes. They did at least have crushed red pepper at the table"
Yvonne C.,"Denver, CO",227,267,2,4.0,10/8/2008,"I warn you, I'm a little biased.  I love their pizza here and it's mainly for aesthetic reasons.  I think that BJ's is somewhat of a staple in So. Cal. lifestyle because it is on every Main St. or main road in every beach town from Long Beach down to Laguna Beach.  I'm not talking about these big 'brewhouses,' even though those are OK, but these small intimate locations in old buildings.  When I eat the pizza, it reminds me of where I would go in high school and college.  I try to eat there at least once a year...the only reason why I have to limit myself is because I gained 14 lbs when I worked for their corporate office...there's something about sitting on your ass and eating free restaurant food every day that just gets to you, ya know?  And I'm sure you can only imagine how happy I was when I found out that they have an Oreo Cookie Pizookie...yum!  This is by far the best part about BJ's...well, that and their own root-beer.  Just remember, however, the root-beer is not a free refill.  Oh!  And you must try one of their root-beer floats, it's to die for."
Lou O.,"Westminster, CO",4,36,3,4.0,2/22/2013,"If you like pretzels, try the bratwurst sliders on a soft, buttery pretzel bun. Pair the sliders with an Imperial Red Ale, and you have the perfect pub meal."
John L.,"Denver, CO",20,19,1,4.0,11/6/2011,The nacho's are to die for. They have a huge collection of beers on hand.. prices are very reasonable and the staff always friendly and helpful.
Kate O.,"Portland, OR",15,214,559,2.0,10/28/2012,"We were really looking foward to some good pizza, beer and watch the GIants play the pirates in the world series...we left wishing we never went. Hate that feeling and to spend money on a bad experience too. It started off bad when my family of 4 was seated in a booth and they knew I have an 8 month old but they told us to put her with the car seat actually resting on the table. It felt sooooo crammed. Then my 8 month old needed to eat and my 3 year old hit his head on the table...crying kids and the waitress approaches and asks for our drink order...haven't even looked at the menu with making the bottle and settling down my 3 year old after the head bonk....okay now let's look at the menu...My husband ordered the brewhouse blond beer which he did enjoy. We decided on the sweet pig (hawaiian) hand tossed pizza. I also ordered a house salad out first. The salad was just meh. The croutons tasted stale but I did like the sliced cucumber and tomato. The pizza came and I could not believe the size. We ordered the 14' sharable and it was so tiny and thin. I did not know hand tossed meant thin crust. We were soooo disappointed and it was just luke warm like it had been sitting on the counter waiting for someone to take it to our table...and considering it was empty in the restaurant I am not sure why it didn't come right out. It didn't help that both our kiddos missed their naps today as we spent the day in Boulder, so they were fussy during dinner and the whole experience just was not enjoyable....I will not order the hand tossed again. Pizza hut makes better pizza....huge bummer. waste of money. Reason for 2 stars, hubby had a good beer and our server was good too."
Chris R.,"Henderson, NV",0,15,,3.0,12/20/2011,"food -good service - ok atmosphere - meh it seems to be very popular, but i think maybe for that reason i think its overrated. i just dont see myself waiting an hour and a half for a fair to good meal, theres other places with better food, service, and beer quite frankly, plus i wont have to wait as long on any given night. lunch menu is pretty good, so is happy hour. don't get me wrong, good place to eat for standard american fatty food"
Elizabeth D.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,23,1,1.0,9/25/2010,"I've eaten at 3 different BJ's, 5 times total. my first 2 experiences were great.. then it started going downhill after that. last night was my last time going there EVER. i had a white pizza and a house salad with honey mustard dressing which tasted fine and all, but now i'm suffering from severe stomach pains and other embarrassing ailments. to quote someone else, ""The prices are ridiculous for food that I would compare to Applebee's."" don't eat here unless you are an irresponsible eater. i bet none of it is organic and it's all GMO. who knows how old the salad was.. and who knows how clean the kitchen actually is. ugh. and our waiter was super, 'IN YOUR FACE' and spilled a drink all over the table. barf. BARF."
Chris S.,"Brighton, CO",84,31,,2.0,9/2/2013,"The food is good the service not so much. Went last Saturday night, the waitress seemed to be in a hurry not wanting to ""wait"" on us she was not prompt with refills  and when handed us an empty ketchup acted like it was an act of congress to get a new one. It's not just her other waiters and waitresses seemed unhappy as well.  It's ok to hate your job but don't portray that you the customers!  Won't be going back!"
S S.,"Golden, CO",1,95,1,3.0,6/7/2011,Besides the insanely long wait (1 1/2 hrs) the food and drinks were ok we stuck to appetizers. My black and tan was far more tan than it should have been...
Shawn S.,"Evergreen, CO",109,166,25,2.0,3/11/2011,Happy hour specials not that great regarding food choices and prices.  Took us 45 min at 7pm on a Thursday night to get our food and we only ordered the santa fe salad.  To top it off..once our bill came it had the other tables order on our bill.
Mark G.,"Broomfield, CO",70,23,,5.0,10/26/2011,I think this place is great.  I drop in for lunch or dinner a couple times a month.  I'm a little disappointed to see all of the 3 star reviews.  This place is always busy (a good sign) and has a big selection to choose from.  I especially like the French Dip Sandwich plate.
E H.,"Broomfield, CO",0,5,,4.0,7/8/2011,"The large menu has something to please everyone.  This is not fine dining, but better than standard pub fare.  The ""little bites"" menu has some great little plates for $3-$4, including the mini-bruschetta which comes with a great pesto vinaigrette.  The craft beer selection alone is worth the visit and includes 6-7 BJ brews, but also plenty of taps from other awesome breweries."
Heather G.,"Arvada, CO",0,1,,1.0,11/7/2014,"Service was terrible, the waitress was rude, and had an attitude with us. In this business the customer is always right and you do not treat customers the way she treated us. At first it was nice, but then she brought the entree out before the salad, and one of the entrees tasted like it had or was cooked with nuts, so I politely asked if there were nuts in it, she went back to check, and when she returned she stated I should have said something to her about it, oh and next time I need to inform her because the chef can change his gloves.... Uhm, I hope he changes his gloves after every new plate he cooks due to sanitary reasons. Then I had finished my drink and no one had come around to ask me if I wanted a refill. Until the check was already brought. She then tried to be polite after that begging for a tip, which she won't get, all in all, I'm never eating here again, service was horrible and the food wasn't that great."
Jaci R.,"New York, NY",20,17,,2.0,1/11/2008,"Very cool looking interior and not a bad place to have a few drinks if you are alone. They have a huge flat screen and several smaller ones so you can catch up on all the ESPN you missed during the week.  The food is your typical bar-food. I had the salmon which really had no taste to it, but the endless selection of beers made up for it. There were only about 15 people inside at 9:15 pm and the service was sloppy. Not very impressed, but if I were from Westminster, I wouldn't mind grabbing a few drinks after work here."
