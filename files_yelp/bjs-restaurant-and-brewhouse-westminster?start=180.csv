Stephen S.,"Denver, CO",57,78,1,5.0,5/5/2010,BJ's is fantastic. Moved to Westminster about 1 year ago and can't get enough of this place. The pizaa is fantastic as well as the spring rolls for an app. Their beer is some of the best micro brew when you compare it to CB Potts and some of the others around the area. The place is great if you have a big group and they also do a beer tasting every month that you can get in on.
Jules G.,"Seattle, WA",137,81,,2.0,10/28/2009,"Another GNO, once again out-voted on where I wanted to go (when will my girls realize it's all about ME?- time for new friends), and we could've been anywhere in the U.S of A and wouldn't know the difference. I remember going to Bj's way back when in Laguna Beach. I remember it more of a funky pizza joint that served up fantastic zaa. Not anymore. Now, you can get a whole slew of ""international"" eats, gargantuan salads, wings, burgers, and, oh yeah, pizza. With a menu so overwhelmingly scattered, ain't no way you're gonna get over the top, mind-blowing food. Eat here if- you just want to fill your belly and don't care about what the food tastes like, you never get out and are clueless as to what our fine state truly has to offer from the culinary world, and if this is the only way you're going to see your friends."
Naser T.,"Golden, CO",0,30,,4.0,2/3/2011,"Its pizza is really good. My friends and I love Artichoke Spinach Pizza. Recently, I have tasted its Clam Chowder with Sourdough Loaf, It is realy good and fresh."
Monica I.,"Westminster, CO",41,174,34,2.0,6/18/2010,"It's like Old Chicago but the food isn't as good, the atmosphere isn't as interesting, and the bar closes early.  So if you really, really love Old Chicago you might like BJ's Restaurant.  But if you don't like Old Chicago I wouldn't bother with BJ's."
Stephen K.,"Denver, CO",105,590,836,4.0,6/2/2009,"I'm honestly not certain why this particular BJ's is averaging 2 1/2 stars, when the ones in Aurora and Boulder are getting 3 1/2 stars.  I'm reading the reviews for this place and they don't seem to be slapping BJ's across the face for lousy service, it more than anything else seems to be ""gee you aren't blowing our socks off with amazing, unusual food -- and you aren't focusing on 1 cuisine, you're trying to be many things to many people -- therefore we're going to spit down on you.""  * WTF*, is what I say.  I just don't understand that mentality.  So they have pizzas and salads and sandwiches and pasta and burgers.  Does that mean a place warrants lousy ratings?  If so, should every restaurant chain with multiple cuisines suffer the same fates?  Not in this reviewer's opinion...*shrug* I took my friend here the night of my big move, which ended up being quiet and rainy - not terribly crowded especially at 8 at night, which was nice -- but still showing some signs of life.  I ordered the Jambalaya (blackened chicken, shrimp and Chicken- Andouille sausage, sautéed with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce).  I requested they replace my rice with bowtie pasta and they had no problems at all with me requesting that, nor did they charge me extra for it.   My friend had the Grilled Chicken pasta (rotelle noodles with cream sauce, steamed broccoli and grilled chicken breast).   Perhaps it's true what folks say about ""hunger being the best chef"", but both meals were delectable -- and BIG. O_O  They brought me a bowl the size of a small swimming pool which I managed to finish maybe 60% of and then ate the rest 2 days later.   The Jambalaya was spiced nicely, not too timidly or too boldly -- or perhaps that was the sauce that was mixed in - it also apparently goes really well with bowtie pasta versus the traditional rice.   We both enjoyed tasty garlic bread with our meal and didn't have to wait an inordinately long time for our order.   We also enjoyed a brew each off their tasty beer menu -- I had the Nutty Brewnette which was somewhat nutty and tasty, and my friend had the Jreemiah Red -- a little malty and definitely an interesting flavor, in a good way.   I was more or less ready to get carted out in a wheelbarrow, but my friend ordered dessert and convinced me to wedge a few bites into my body (anyone remember the ""wafer-thin mint"" sequence from Monty Python with Mr Creosote?  Yeah...that's what I felt was going to happen... :) of his Cookies and Cream Pizookie (a large flattened Oreo-type chocolate cookie with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and a dollop of creamy mousse)...it was yummily decadent but I seriously waddled out of that place and just barely under my own power -- having also had finished packing and moved 10 hrs that day, my legs were already beat; then the huge meal on top of that. Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive, and was just the right amount of small-talky with each of us when we were ordering and then later on.  The check was presented within about 2 minutes of requesting it.  Really, nothing at all to complain about, it was quite enjoyable and I'd definitely go again -- the brewery part makes it all the sweeter to check out.  Whoever thinks this place equals Chilis needs to get out more often - the food items are definitely more upscale tastewise and choicewise than that.  I would ponder putting it within 1/2 a star of CB&Potts though or whatever the other place I am thinking of is, and maybe 1/2 star below the Wynkoop's menu - where the rest of their beers lie remains to be determined at a future date...:)"
Michael T.,"Irvine, CA",10,30,4,4.0,8/14/2009,"I don't know why people are being so critical of BJ's.  Give someone a voice on the net...   Anyway, I've been to BJ's twice, and I plan on going back again.  Both of my visits have been great experiences.   The food has always impressed me, but the menu reads like a novel.  Personally, I occasionally like having lots of options... although I can imagine that other people might get annoyed with sifting through all of the choices. The service has never disappointed me, although my first experience was better than my second.  The first server knew the menu and the beer options like the back of his hand.  The second server seemed to still be a little green and wasn't as familiar.  Still she was friendly, prompt, and courteous. Bottom line, BJ's probably won't blow your socks off... but it's still a great place to eat and have a good time."
Denney R.,"Thornton, CO",0,24,,2.0,10/8/2012,"Used a coupon for a gluten free pizza meal for two. The pizza had good flavor but like other places we have tried was a ten incher and sparse on toppings, not even close to what is pictured and way over priced, glad I had the coupon. The meal came with two salids, a pizza and a Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Pizookie which was good. Our wait person was attentive and competent so no problem there. Still the best gluten free pizza place in Colorado is Beau Jo's"
Brent W.,"Erie, CO",27,19,1,4.0,11/14/2010,"Nice place.   Great selection and decent food. I only had app and soup, but both were quite good"
Aaron C.,"Westminster, CO",2,3,,2.0,4/22/2010,"The atmosphere at BJ's is good.  Both their in house brews and other beers on tap are superb.  However, the menu looks fabulous, but tastes mediocre.  My wife and I really expected a whole lot more."
Col. Hector B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",273,46,5,3.0,8/17/2008,"Another default haunt in the Westbroomvada 'hood, BJ's has an immense, high-ceilinged dining room and bar area, lit just so that a sort of warm yellow/amber glow barely suffuses the legions of minivan drivers feeding in the semi-darkness. Okay, let's get a handle on things here, before my arch-urbanite-in-the-'burbs act carries us away: BJ's is a chain restaurant and it's in Westminster, so we pretty much know what to expect there. The place is big. The families are big. The food is big, and it has neither the craftsmanship and flavor of true cuisine nor the sense of place that manifests in the flavors of a family-run kitchen. The menu is big -- pastas, steaks, sandwiches, pizza and a full run of house-brewed beer that I don't care about, because on the rare occasion I eschew hard liquor and pick up a beer, it's going to be the Guinness -- and, by and large, pretty well executed. They do major volume here at dinner, and never once have I been served something that wasn't well presented and prepared. The deep dish pizzas are like a tastier version of Pizza Hut, the sandwiches and fries have been tasty, and my servers have always been fast and friendly. They run a tight ship here, executing their corporate cookbook with precision, and taking pretty good care of me in the process. So, three stars."
Kevin C.,"Denver, CO",0,31,,4.0,5/1/2012,"I ate here tonight.  The service was good and we all joined the ""Clean Plate Club.""  My group (three people) shared an appetizer, each had an entree and shared a dessert. We each had two beers.  We got out for less than $100.  I felt the prices were reasonable for the meals we got.  My only critiques would be that the bathroom is kind of hidden and the menu has some annoying formatting issues."
S G.,"Seattle, WA",0,57,4,1.0,4/23/2012,"Went here for lunch and things got started off on the wrong foot. Several staff walked right by us with out asking if we had been helped when we were obviously waiting for a table, we were not the only ones waiting and the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess couldn't be bothered to even look up at us from her register to help us and eventually a waiter from a different section got us a table. We ordered some beers and when I went to take a sip out of mine the bottom of the glass separated from the glass and beer dumped all over our table and all over my lap. We started to corral the beer to keep it from running off the table. I asked a passing waiter for some towels and noted the spill, a little bit later our waiter came to the table and exclaimed that this glass breakage is a common occurrence, he failed to help us in any way and by the time the other waiter returned to the table with the towels, we had already cleaned up all the liquid and just used the towels to try and keep everything from getting sticky. I could be wrong but I don't recall anyone apologizing for the broken glass, my beer soaked pants or anything else. They failed to bring us new napkins, did not comp the beer or make any effort to make amends for the situation. They failed to clear the beer soaked napkins and towels until we insisted that they take them off of our table, this was after our waiter and another waiter had been at our table no less then 3-4 separate times to bring us new drinks, food, etc. In addition to that mess, they did not bring us straws which we asked for 3 times and our water glasses sat empty a few times for quite a while.  The food was OK, not fantastic, just OK. The beer was not very good and definitely not worth all the headache. The service here is beyond horrible, their service manager should lose their job for the obvious lack of training that they have done. I do not expect much from places like this, but there is a level of basic service that any restaurant should provide and these guys failed to do so in just about every way."
Leslie Q.,"Westminster, CO",10,4,,1.0,5/6/2012,"Listen, I'm no critic.  It's very easy to please me.  However, tonight we go to BJ's.  Beers came out 10 minutes later, we get our dinner salad well before our appetizer, little annoying but no biggie... But here's the real issue: Someone (food runner maybe) delivers our pizza to our neighboring table, they put a spatula in it, and sit with it until the server shows up  and they point out that it's not theirs.  Our server takes it back into the kitchen, brings it back out with their actual pizza, throws ours on our table, says ""it's a long story, I'll be back..."", goes to their table apologizes profusely and sends out a manager to them.  Then she comes back to our table, but never explains that another table had our pizza at it for about 5 minutes.  When we ask her about it she says ""in my defense...(enter excuse here)"" but she never apologized.  Anyway, I am positive that is a health code violation but that's besides the point.  We never heard anything but excuses from her and when she sent a manager to talk to us, she hovered over the table and then went 20 feet away and vented to her coworkers about the event... And as we left a little bit later, we were followed by the eyes of everyone from our server to the hostess.  Holy crap.  Take responsibility.  It was a mistake, a gross mistake, but we're all human.  Instead of putting the blame on everyone else, take responsibility, apologize, and chances are we wont even need a manager.  We won't be going back."
