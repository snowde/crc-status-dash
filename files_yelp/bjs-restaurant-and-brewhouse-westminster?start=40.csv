Bill G.,"Denver, CO",8,5,,2.0,9/4/2016,"Sunday lunch, nobody here and they still managed to screw up our order.  At least an ""I'm sorry"" would have helped, but she just said ""we'll remake it"" as if it was an ordinary occurrence....."
Ryan S.,"Thornton, CO",0,5,,5.0,7/1/2016,This is my favorite brewpub. Their Tatonka Stout is my all time favorite beer. It is very smooth and creamy but has a high alcohol content. Be careful! The food is also great. Be prepared to spend a lot of time going over their large menu. It's worth the search time. I really enjoy the Parmesan Chicken.
Melissa B.,"Westminster, CO",57,11,9,5.0,9/15/2016,"Our experience here this evening was exemplary! Our server, Melissa F., was friendly, went out of her way to accommodate special requests and she was very attentive. We came to celebrate our son's 8th birthday and we were two adults and four kids (12 and under). She was fine with the kids switching out their drink choices on refills, she patiently waited while they selected pizookie choices, and she created every request with a cheerful attitude. When we got our bill we were shocked to find that our 8 and 6 year olds had ordered the adult fish and chips, since the kids menu didn't have this option for them. The manager listened to our situation, and despite the fact that it was our error, helped us out by giving us a 50% discount on both of the boy's meals. We have eaten here many times as a family and look forward to many more equally enjoyable opportunities in the future!"
Sarah D.,"Arvada, CO",0,73,2,5.0,6/9/2017,"We've been coming here for years and love the extensive menu and drink selections (shoutout for including lots of cider options for those of us who don't drink beer!).  The wait for food after ordering can sometimes be a bit long, but that's about the only issue we've had.  Everything we have tried has been good to excellent, and the pizookies are to die for!"
Amy O.,"Indiana, PA",0,5,,1.0,11/12/2016,"Although it's across the road from an ice rink, do NOT be tempted to come here with a team or large group.  Their service absolutely cannot support large parties.  The staff were inefficient and became increasingly more rude the more confused and frustrated they became.  Larger parties should find another venue."
Hailey D.,"Monument, CO",22,176,11,4.0,1/7/2016,"This is an updated review from Sept 26, 2015.  I went there with the same friend that I always go to the BJ's with. She's a fan and so am I. Though last time when we were there, we had such a horrible experience, I decided to give this another try. And it was delightful. We sat at the bar. I was there before she got there, so I ordered beer. Our bartender, Nate was very knowledgeable, and courteous. When she arrived, we ordered our food and waited for a short time before our appetizer arrived. She always orders the same thing, while I want to experiment and try new food.  One thing we both didn't like was how much dressing was on our salad. It was swimming in it, and made the entire dish of salad very salty (we had Caesar salad-with NO KALE! Ew). Other than that, it was awesome."
Tamera V.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,,5.0,4/20/2017,Great service from Robert at the bar today. TERRIBLE SERVICE yesterday. Must be BAD MANAGEMENT at this address!
Aileen J.,"Mountain Village, CO",52,9,,2.0,11/14/2015,"Our family used to eat here often. There is something for everyone and this was surprisingly great for being a chain restaurant! Unfortunately, the last three times our family went to BJ's it left a pretty awful taste in our mouth. I have actually had to send food back for being undercooked and cold, once - our pizza came to the table cold greasy crust with the cheese hardly melted. The chicken crusted Parmesan is usually wonderful but the last couple of times it tasted awful, almost like it was being cooked in a pan with a bunch of other meat flavors and grease cooking in it.  BJ's your food quality has really gone down hill, get it together."
David S.,"Denver, CO",5,10,,2.0,5/14/2016,"A nice comfortable restaurant and our waiter was very nice and provided good service.  I ordered a stout beer and itv was pretty uneventful, my wife ordered a margarita and it was mostly cheap sweet and sour mix.  I ordered the ravioli and it had taken on a metallic taste from the pan it's baked in, (it comes in a metal baking dish). It was a sad excuse of an entree to be served.  My son had a kids meal with spaghetti that sat under a heart lamp to long and had dried out the noodles not covered in sauce.  My wife ordered a burger that was very good,  huge patty nice bun and had really good fries.  My recommendation is to order a hamburger and stay away from their Italian menu."
Joanne P.,"Denver, CO",37,24,3,5.0,1/25/2017,"We live BJ's. Been to Boulder, Westminster and Aurora. Everything is good and the priced for what you get are reasonable. We love the wings appetizers and the Calmari. Haven't had anything we didn't like. Menu is extensive. Had Cheddar Broccoli Soup in a Sourdough Bread Bowl. Yummmmmm!!!"
Michael S.,"Vancouver, WA",4468,2212,19024,3.0,8/28/2012,"Westminster BJ's is similar to most BJ's except its slower, duller, and more forgettable. Three of us came for a late night dinner, but too early for the 10:00-11:00 late night BJ's happy hour. There were about 5 other tables of glassy-eyed customers quietly eating & drinking. This may have been the quietest BJ's experience of my life. I got my usual Jeremiah Red while the others tried wine. For dinner, I opted for the Tuscan Chicken Limone with Angel Hair Pasta covered with Steamed Baby Spinach and a Lemon-Butter Sauce with sauteed Garlic, Artichoke Hearts, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes. The pasta was slightly overcooked and the sauce a little thick, but it was filling and a-ok.  Pat S. got a Portobello Mushroom & Fontina Cheese Deep-dish Pizza while Olivia Z. tackled a Grilled Steak Salad with Skirt Steak, oven-roasted Potatoes, Baby Greens, Bleu Cheese, Yellow Squash, Red Onion, Zucchini, Red Peppers, and Hard-boiled Egg. Luckily, they got full quickly and shared their dishes. Both were fine, but not really special. Service was genuine. It was a slow night for the restaurant and a slow night to be working at BJ's, so, I can fully understand the lack of enthusiasm. Parking is free and easy in the shared lot. When you want BJ's and are near Westminster then this is the place to go. The meal may not be the happy ending you're looking for, but at least you'll leave contented for a little while."
Trevor P.,"Arvada, CO",40,16,4,5.0,7/31/2015,"I've been here a lot. More than I can count and I've had a bad experience just once. The food choices are excellent and for a chain brewery, the beer is excellent."
Marcia F.,"Albin, WY",9,16,1,5.0,6/25/2016,"This place did not disappoint.  Alex, our waiter was fantastc. He was very knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizers were good sized  (fed 6).. The whole meal was good and atmosphere was nice. You could actually have a conversation without having to scream over loud music. I would recommend this eatery . Will be back"
Michael K.,"Westminster, CO",4,22,,5.0,10/21/2015,"I have always enjoyed BJ's for their pizza, beer, and root beer.  Since I visit often, I also am in their club and have their app. The reason for the review this time is that I want to compliment Hillary and the service in general.  My date and I had a slight problem with the order in which the burger was delivered before the appetizer salad (not a big deal as things happen, definitely not typical from my previous BJ's experiences), and our server Hillary immediately noticed and sincerely apologized.  Prior to and after the mix-up, Hillary continued to be a great server that impressed both my date and I.   I expect service to be good when things are going smoothly, so when things go ""bad"" and the server and manager step up it stands out and I wanted to pass on the compliment."
Gary K.,"Broomfield, CO",0,17,21,5.0,1/1/2017,"Amazing meal and a free pizzookie!   It doesn't get any better than this!!  Great service.   Fantastic jambalaya, fish tacos and bacon cheeseburger!  Everyone's happy!!!"
Tammy N.,"Aurora, CO",49,148,366,3.0,7/9/2014,"Stopped by here with a couple of friends around my birthday. We decided to stick exclusively to the late-night happy hour menu. The regular menu seemed too overwhelming to even look through, so it ended up just sitting at the far end of the table.  I enjoyed the Santa Fe Spring Rolls and the Ahi Poke but not so much the Pomegranate Margarita. Maybe it's just me and I'd rather prefer pomegranate juice by itself.  The lighting, especially at night, can be really dark and makes it a bit hard to navigate through the restaurant.  Overall, a pretty good evening with friends though."
Shannon D.,"Broomfield, CO",27,3,,2.0,6/27/2016,"Their online ordering system is awful.   The first time I tried it, they forgot half the order.  Since I didn't know until I got the order back to the office, I called to complain.  The manager was understanding and sent a gift card for $15. I tried again today for an order to be ready at 11:30.  I arrived at 11:40, had to wait nearly 10 minuted for the one person manning the takeout desk to pack up an order for some people waiting.  She looked up my order and took my payment and only then did they start to make my order. What's the point in placing an online order to avoid the wait if they don't actually start it until after you get there.    Food is good, but two strikes you're out as far as I'm concerned."
David B.,"Commerce City, CO",9,142,95,4.0,2/26/2016,This is happy hour place I try to hit at least twice a month but unfortunately they changed the menu and it's not a great as it used to be.. the restaurants service is still good and food is above average... The beer selection is top notch and is always changing... just wish old happy hour menu would come back
Rick H.,"Arvada, CO",195,339,102,5.0,5/31/2014,"They finally reduced the size of the menu here, can I hear a hallelujah? Now, I can hold it all on my own and sift through it in one setting... Which means, I no longer get vertigo trying to figure out what to order, straining to find that darn healthy (uh, excuse me, the EnLIGHTened entrees) chapter I just read a half hour ago and the good stuff, like Happy Hour Appetizers and $3 wines, scream at you like the lead singer of a Heavy Metal Band! On this night, it was pretty busy, but we found a two-top in the bar area. Allie, our delightful server, approached us with her charming smile, alluring wit and a hysterical case of the ""clumsy thumbs."" The condensed menu made it quick to order. We split the tasty chicken lettuce wraps, which came with a nice side of sesame soy sauce and the sting of hot Chinese mustard, not the water-down version. These wraps were perfect to share. For our entrée, we split the Moroccan Spiced Salmon and the Mozzarella and Tomato salad...oh the sweet taste of peppery basil still lingers. The Salmon was drenched in spices galore, I think I read nine (two shy of The Colonel, but you have to sacrifice to abbreviate the menu). Sifting our way through the freshly oven baked salmon, seemed like a treasure hunt full of flavors, we found pickled cucumbers, carrots, broccoli and pieces of toasted almonds scattered on top of a veggie couscous. I had the Jeremiah Red and the Oasis Amber, my wife enjoyed the Berry Burst Cider and then Allie outdid herself (again), as she hand-stuffed bleu cheese olives for my lovely wife's martini."
Kasey T.,"Arvada, CO",77,26,19,4.0,8/1/2015,"First time at BJs. Saturday night dinner with the family. Great service. We went about 5:15 and didn't have to wait for a table.  I had the roast beef dip. It was good. The wedge cut fries were great. I also love the horseradish sauce.  My daughter had the brisket burger. She said the brisket was great and so was the burger. New menu item. She got the shoestring fries. She loves those.  Hubby got the chicken wings. They were good but he makes the best grilled wings so the bar is high.  The margarita was good but it was $9. That was just the house margarita! Sad.  We will be back.  The menu is long and there were several things we all wanted to try..,so next time.  The couple next to us got the flatbread pizza and they said that was good."
