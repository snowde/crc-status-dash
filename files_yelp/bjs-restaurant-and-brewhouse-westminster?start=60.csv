Rebeca M.,"Chicago, IL",256,146,87,4.0,6/14/2015,Always a great experience ..  Good beer selection. HUGE menu. Server David was very attentive and on point..
Jack K.,"Denver, CO",141,152,13,2.0,2/28/2014,"I was pretty disappointed after visiting this joint. This was actually the first time I've been to any BJ's and the service was absolutely terrible. I kept it at two because the food I had was damn good.  So, myself and three friends came in to grab some beers and food before a movie. We decided to sit in the bar area at a high top. It didn't take long for someone to come over, but when she did, it was clear this wasn't going to be a good experience. Every question we asked she basically rolled her eyes and sighed before attempting to answer it, most of which she couldn't. She seemed a bit socially awkward, and not talkative (excellent qualities for her profession) and on top of it all she disappeared toward the end after we specifically told her we were in a rush for a movie.  The person who delivered our food seemed to have a similar attitude problem, but at the end with our waitress nowhere to be found,  we flagged down a manager to get us our bill and he was pleasant at least. It never ceases to amaze me how someone can screw up simply smiling and being polite while serving food."
Rusty S.,"Crystal City, MO",24,151,79,4.0,3/8/2016,"Solid fare and beer here--CO seems to have a ton of small breweries and this one doesn't disappoint. Never seen a Screwdriver served in a pint glass (!) but it worked for us just fine. I had the French Dip, which was very tasty, fries were good as well. A great place to go with friends or coworkers for some drinks and chow."
Alejandro G.,"Thornton, CO",0,17,2,3.0,11/13/2016,Fast service we got are food in under 15 min but no tall blue moons ? Mm and my wife didn't like her food much but I did
Jeff D.,"Arlington, TX",14,36,14,2.0,3/18/2016,"Long wait! I know it was Friday but I still think 1 hour is to long. Had a difficult time finding artificial sweetener, I'm from Texas we drink sweet tea but I'm becoming a diabetic and can't have sugar. I order their cherry glazed salmon, I eat a lot of salmon, it is the first time I've ever had to salt salmon. The asparagus was very good, service was good, waiter did a good job, nothing outstanding but no complaints. I do not see me eating there again."
Jimm H.,"Temecula, CA",0,7,,5.0,9/15/2014,"On 8/10/14, we held a MEMORIAL for my brother at BJ's in Westminster CO. My brother was a REGULAR at this BJ's which is close to his business.  The staff at BJ's knew him well because he ate lunch there most days. Tim, the manager, set up a special area in the restaurant for the 30 of us that attended the Memorial service.  The SERVICE was outstanding as was the food.  Because this was a memorial service it was more challenging to serve us as I talked about my brother, as did others and so the food had to wait until that portion of the service was completed.  Despite this the food was served at a perfect time, hot and delicious and exceeded everyone's expectations. Most important of all was the HEARTFELT SERVICE that we received.  The staff was exceedingly considerate and did everything possible to help us through the Memorial with professionalism, dedication and respect. My wife and I, along with my brother's family, especially want to THANK EVERYONE AT BJ's and especially AARON, LEXI AND TIM for the very dedicated and loving service to our family and everyone there. With HEARFELT GRATITUDE, Jimm & Susan Hughey"
Tiffani H.,"Denver, CO",136,264,481,2.0,9/20/2015,"I'm not sure why I always forget this place is really not that good but we come here about once every six months or so and always walk out saying the same thing........The food here is very average bar food.  I've tried the ribs and they aren't worth ordering again.  Everything else is just ok.  The restaurant and atmosphere are great however and if your looking for a place to go have a drink with friends in the area, this could be a good pick.  Maybe appetizers and beer would be a better choice."
Daniel B.,"Denver, CO",1089,116,410,3.0,7/22/2015,"So, I work near here and have been a number of times.  While the menu is massive (known for this, I think ... think Cheesecake Factory) ... who doesn't have a Cobb salad? ... in fact from that ginormous menu there are only 4 salads. Now their burgers a average ...  not bad not great, but good.  They seem to be good enough on the entrees, but nothing special.  Wish I could say something stood out ..."
Seth B.,"Aurora, CO",0,11,,1.0,5/17/2016,"Pretty bad tonight. Wasn't crazy busy, we were seated instantly after arriving. Our waitress started our experience by complaining about how busy and horrible it was today. Took our drink order, 10 minutes later we got our beers. Beer is always good here. We then ordered calamari, about 30 minutes later she came and apologized and said our food would be out soon. We asked about our appetizer. Our meal came (pizza and pasta were almost cold) the kiddos Mac and cheese was the only good dish on the table. Then shortly after  the rubbery burnt appetizer showed up. She then said we would get it taken off the bill which actually ended up being the normal happy hour discounts you would receive in the bar area anyway. Pretty much a horrible experience that I had to pay 60 bucks for. I might give it another try as other BJs have been good in the past but this visit was just crappy from beginning to end."
Khampha K.,"Broomfield, CO",80,196,674,4.0,10/8/2014,Service is slower than a mofo but my parmesean crusted chicken and garlic mashed potatoes were worth the wait. This place is always so busy but the food is excellent.
Adriana H.,"Broomfield, CO",16,2,,5.0,2/14/2016,"This weekend our friends and I went out for dinner for drinks and great food. We ordered the best Brussel sprouts appetiser. Sauted with siracha and some other spices, totally recommend it.  Our main dish was fabulous we ordered pizza and salmon delicious! Service was the best. Great atmosphere!! Gotta try it!"
Ryoko N.,"Henderson, CO",4,10,,4.0,4/27/2016,"We've been to this BJ's many many, many times.  Their menu is huge, you almost always find what you want. (unless you want some ethnic food)  Their burgers and flat breads are great, and my favorite is the Parmesan crusted chicken.  Almost all of their beers are great, and consistent in flavor.  Service quality varies from Excellent to Good, but I've never had a terrible service.  I do not really recommend their sweet cocktails, as they are super syrupy...  I wish they still have the thin crust pizza..."
Luke T.,"Tucker, GA",429,613,645,4.0,9/26/2014,Really good happy hour deals.
Ana O.,"Charlotte, NC",116,328,28,2.0,5/27/2013,"Overall, mediorcre describe this place.  They have some decent stuff on the menu and the beer isn't bad.  However, BJ's didn't steal my heart. The avocado egg rolls are definitely worth trying here.  This was by far the best thing we had here.  The avocado makes them creamy and delicious.  I tried their deep dish Mediterranean pizza.  I wasn't wow-ed by the crust and the toppings were a little scarce.  There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't my favorite pizza.  My partner ordered a burger, which was pretty decent.  The Nutty Brewnette was good but also not my favorite brown ale. The prices were a little high, but the service here was pretty decent.  The place was clean, close to the hotel we stayed at, and convenient.  Overall, it's definitely a two and a half-star place."
Lani P.,"Denver, CO",375,286,4166,4.0,10/22/2012,"I eat here on a weekly basis, whether it's inside or take out It's quick easy affordable food especially during happy hour.  It's like 5 minutes away and has everything from pub food to pasta dishes.   I love that they have the little bites section with cheap prices that are tapa portions of the regular size appetizers.  I love their burgers which are always delicious. Their roast beef au jus is the only thing I have to complain about.  For the past several years it's been the same...as in Salty, dried meat and Nasty!!  This is the one thing I don't like that I've tried.   I do love their pasta plates and salads.  Soups are always delicious as well.  If you have room for dessert, you'll be heaven with their pizookies.  Yummy I've tried every flavor and depending on my flavor taste buds of the day, it's all my favorite.   I do miss their meatloaf they use to have, but it's not been on the menu in almost 3 years. :(  They have an extensive food menu as well as beer, but I don't like beer and since I don't drink anymore, food is the only reason why I go here. When I did drink, I would get their bloody mary's which was delicious and their virgin daiquiris are very filling."
Donna C.,"Lafayette, CO",29,239,25,2.0,3/15/2013,"Maybe a bad day? I don't know what happened but out experience was terrible. We stop here ~once a year and I'm not sure we'll go back. Food. 6 yr old said the mac & cheese tasted ""funny"" -- never a good sign. Hubby ordered teriyaki/rice/chicken dish. Horrible. Just plain tasted bad. He also got the featured beer - also horrible. He's a big beer drinker so it must have been pretty bad. Daughter #1 and I split a pizza -- accidentally ordered thick crust. Crust reminded me of Rocky Racoco's (from Wisconsin) -- a bit of dough but mostly butter. Pepperoni, sausage and corn -- yes, we tried to branch out and get a veggie we'd both eat. Terrible idea. Corn on pizza - not sure what I was thinking but will never order that again. Why put it as an option on the menu if it is that horrible? Service. Busy early evening - Sunday.  Our waitress was scarce. Friendly enough but couldn't even get more water when we were clearly out. It got 2 stars for ok wine and benefit of the doubt.  Will check reviews before stopping in this location again."
Edgar G.,"Hillsboro, OR",12,23,64,4.0,11/9/2015,Always great services. Food tasty. Chef decoration ok. Environment is good. Place decoration and cleaness is fine. Restroom are good.
Sarah Y.,"Denver, CO",2,56,,3.0,12/3/2015,So BJ's is expensive. Really expensive. The entire drink menu except the beers do not have prices. My waiter was not pleased when I asked for the prices of three drinks before I chose. He keep joking that it would be a surprise at the end. We brought my elderly mother for dinner there and she had a half-dozen presents in front of her. Never once did he ask if anyone was celebrating or say Happy Birthday. Average meal price was 12 dollars without a drink. I will not return. Also I find it interesting that the manager of this establishment only comments on positive reviews. So lame.
Sonja S.,"Broomfield, CO",0,39,8,5.0,7/15/2014,I love this place! Mozzarella sticks are delicious! I normally get the Honey Crisp Chicken salad. It's the ONLY salad I've ever had that was made with exactly what I want. I normally add or omit stuff.  My boyfriend loves the French Dip. Their wedge fries are delish as well! You must save room for a pazookie! The sample 3 is perfect when you can't decide what you want.
Jamie L.,"Broomfield, CO",307,908,1148,2.0,7/9/2010,"Serious Disappointment. I remember BJs years ago, for their huge, delicious baked potatoes, funky pizzas, and cool brews.  At a reasonable price. All that is gone. The prices are ridiculous for food that I would compare to Applebee's.  (And I won't eat at Applebee's)  The potatoes are awful.  (We tried more than once, remembering how awesome they once were.)  Their pizzas are boring and uninteresting.  They still have beers, but once again, price kills any enjoyment. The menu as a whole is like that of any other pseudo-sportsbar, kinda-american, sorta-international dishes, and hey, let's throw a salad or two and some desserts on the menu place. The service is indifferent and the clientele... leave much to be desired. Skip it."
