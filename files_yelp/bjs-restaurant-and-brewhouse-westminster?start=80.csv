S G.,"Westminster, CO",0,14,,4.0,11/21/2015,"Great food! Really like the new baked ziti. The drinks alcohol and non are good, friendly service and decent prices for what you get."
Ryan S.,"Denver, CO",6,20,,2.0,11/11/2014,"I was a little disappointed to hear that they don't brew their own beer.  The beers are only so-so at that.  The jambalaya was pretty tasty but that's beside the point.  Not the best service either, it's reminiscent of  Buffalo wild wings in atmosphere in my opinion. I  won't be going back."
Josh T.,"Denver, CO",0,20,10,3.0,9/23/2014,The food was great well cooked and exactly how I wanted it. But the service could be improved it wasn't even busy and they were still slow.
Lynn C.,"Paris, France",125,1056,611,3.0,10/17/2011,"You can count on BJs to be the same everywhere. Still too salty, still too sweet, yet still delicious. The 243453 page of menu looks exactly the same as all the other BJs, as well as the decor. The clam chowder is still saltily delicious while the drinks are too sweet to be finished. It's a good place to eat if you don't know what you want, because you'll eventually find something - be it salad, pizza, burgers, or pasta, sandwich, or jambalaya. Also not too expensive. Why not?"
Brittany C.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",0,16,,3.0,8/18/2015,"My husband and sister-in-law, as well as I, come here A LOT! Well our past 4 experiences had been the same and we always end up getting the same waiter. Every time we get him the same thing happens. We wait a good 6 minutes after just getting seated to finally order our drinks and appetizer, we get our appetizer and have it gone by the time we end up being able to order our food!! We had to flag him down for drinks, and we come usually at 830/9 every time we visit, so its not busy.The one thing that irked us the most is that this small group of girls get seated after our appetizer comes out and the waiter orders their drinks right away. And every 5 minutes tended to their table while ours was ignored! And we tried to flag him down several times. They got refills before they even asked, while we end up giving up from trying to flag him down for ours. Next time we are hoping we don't get this waiter. We made up many excuses and tipped him well before, well this time was worse and the last straw. Besides our bad waiter experience we love the food and my husband enjoys the beer! The place has a great atmosphere."
Janel S.,"Denver, CO",2,45,2,1.0,3/7/2016,"We ordered an avocado egg appetizer, and both found it severely lacking.  We also decided to split a sandwich, and neither of us finished our half.  This was my first time here but my friends a veteran of the joint, and he seemed really disappointed that things seemed like they were continuing to go downhill."
Kenzie W.,"Arvada, CO",158,6,,5.0,8/3/2015,If you haven't tried this restaurant is defiantly a must! The atmosphere was very poised but cool at the same time. It's very open and beautiful! We were seated immediately on a busy night and our waiter was hilarious. He was on top of things and the food was to die for. We had calamari for appetizers and i would say it was better than most places I've tried. Awesome place to go eat with friends or family
Paul W.,"Castle Rock, CO",5,89,2,2.0,11/4/2014,"Was told BJ's has the best Chicken Tortilla soup in the business and was not disappointed, it was fantastic!  Unfortunately that is where it ended. I ordered the soup and salad for lunch. A good portion of the salad's leaves had started to turn brown - everyone should know that is a sign it should have been thrown away the day before. Second strike was the service. We had four in our group and minus one, all ordered the same thing - soup and salad.  It took our server a total of 7 minutes to deliver everyone's meal, to be specific, one soup was delivered, a couple minutes later two salads, two minutes later another soup...you get the idea. Soup and salad for three took 7 minutes to complete!  Not good."
Roger R.,"Broomfield, CO",43,11,,5.0,7/4/2015,Food was good. I'm most impressed with the customer service. Our server did a great job. The manager stopped by our table and played with the baby and then brought him Apple sauce. I thought that was absolutely great of her.
Gregory K.,"Denver, CO",808,55,17,5.0,3/27/2015,"Not sure about all the negative reviews on here for BJ's but we were pleasantly surprised overall. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was prompt and very helpful. The menu is tremendous!  So many good things to try for just about anyone. We got a deep dish classic combo. I asked for a Cream Soda but they had run out. However, our server offered the Root Beer (which was very good) ""on the house"" to make up for it. We also got the 3 desert sampler and it was amazing. Couldn't think of any reason not to give 5-Stars. Will be back!"
Aimee H.,"Denver, CO",0,3,,1.0,2/26/2016,If I could 0 stars I would. Worst food I've had in years. Felt bad for our waitress serving that terrible food. I guess I just don't have words for how bad our food was. Tasted like came from a can. I could of went to McDonald's and been more satisfied. I think that sums my experience up.
Jason L.,"Littleton, CO",4,78,30,3.0,6/10/2013,Disappointed. We have eaten at BJ's chains before. Their food is good. Nothing unique or crazy but definitely tasty (mid-day Sunday). The service today was terrible. Weren't greeted for 10 minutes after sitting. Drinks took another 5-10 minutes. We asked for the 2 yr old's food quickly as she was grumpy. It wasn't until a good while later that she started crying rather loud that the server brought the food out which seemed to have been ready. One drink refill the entire time and we asked for ranch on the side. It came on the pizza. We didn't have time to wait for another pizza to be made. The food is good and predictable. Too bad the service wasn't.
John M.,"Denver, CO",31,70,17,5.0,3/17/2015,What a great place to eat and drink some brews. Great service and good people. The only thing is that my fiance and I were wondering why our server only picked up the plates and not our glasses and beer bottles? Walked by like 5 times and nothing.......overall great place.
Amy H.,"Firestone, CO",0,37,,1.0,5/3/2014,"This place is disgusting! It's dirty and the food is awful! We visited the restaurant right as it opened, we were literately the first people there for the day and the place was still dirty. My seat was dirty, the floor had crap all over it, my father's utensils had a bunch of food stuck on them and the bathroom was gross!  The food was another story, didn't taste fresh and our fries were cold. The service left a lot to be desired as well. We had to wait for refills, once they took my sons drink and never came back with it. When our waiter gave me a refill on my tea, he totally touched the rim of the pitcher on my straw, how many other people had he done this with and how many germs were spread around?  I will never step foot in this place again. It could be great, the location is good, the menu is huge but I have no idea how they stay in business, I guess the food inspectors either get paid off or don't visit much!"
Christian B.,"Broomfield, CO",292,695,1702,3.0,1/8/2014,Bring your appetite because this place will serve you large pleniful dishes full of tasty and visually pleasing food. Reasonable prices for a mid range restaurant.
Tee V.,"Brighton, CO",0,74,5,3.0,6/9/2015,"Been here twice, the first time was for a  friend's bday. On that visit it was mostly beer that i had so this rating is not based that visit b/c we got cut off for ordering one to many shots from the bar. Even though we had a table and ordered food too. Note: we werent even loud, the same if not less from the loudness of the place itself. Although i must say the red velvet beer is pretty good.  Now to the rating of the recent visit. The only reason why I wanted to come back was to try the stuff mushrooms. When we got there, we were seated up in a booth in  the bar area which i thought was strange seeing how there were so many open tables on the floor.  Any ways the server was nice but the menu was overwhelming.  I ordered their ribeye medium (came out  more medium rare which i didnt mind). The crusted season on it was a bit salty but good. The asparagus and green beens that accompanied it was ok, The green beans had a little salt and butter to them but the asparagus were plain. My wife ordered the mahi tacos which were good to her taste. I had a bite of it and it was ok. Forgot the name of her drink but it was good b/c it tasted like orange sherbert."
Raquel F.,"Bellevue, NE",0,7,1,1.0,4/19/2015,"I give 1 star due to my waiter was friendly & attentive. The food...was cold. I ordered the lunch BBQ platter the chicken was rubbery & the pork slider sand which was just fat no pork. The BBQ sauce wasn't too bad. The broccoli was chilled I assumed my plate was sitting in the ""window"" for awhile. Ordered a pizza to bring home....wasn't fully cooked.. AT ALL! It would've been it would've been super tasty! Will give 1 more chance...if it isn't better 2nd time I'll never go back."
Rachel K.,"Boston, MA",51,292,13,4.0,10/31/2013,"Caprese, you had me at $2.95.... whhaaaatttt?? You can't find high quality restaurant food in Massachusetts (my home state) for these kind of prices. BJ's has great quality food at such a low price I am astonished, amazed, and downright baffled. Maybe it was the perfect lunch because I was catching up with a friend who is a mere 1700 miles from me about 360 days of the year, but I do think this was a standout lunch for other reasons. Never have I felt better about $$$ spent for what I got! Great drink choices, great selection of food (+ quality), and good atmosphere.  BJ's come to Boston!!!"
Nina M.,"Denver, CO",52,111,20,3.0,7/28/2013,"I don't know what the other posters are talking about when they say the food is lousy, but we all thought it was great!  I had the mahi mahi tacos (to go with my Kona Fire Rock Pale Ale which they have on tap...NICE) My husband had a personal sized pizza, the kids shared the kids pizza, and my sis-in-law had a salad. All our meals were great. What was lacking, however was the service.  We were there for on a weekday and you always expect things to be especially quick during lunch.  Our server was slow, forgot my husband's salad, and was barely present.  Just seemed to be phoning it in that day.  Quite the selection of entrées, AMAZING beer list, and clean, modern decor, but they really need to step it up on service."
Colin C.,"Broomfield, CO",1,10,,2.0,3/11/2016,"We used to come here all the time for their Happy hour and loved the food, drinks and service.  It was always packed. They then changed their happy hour but I thought I would see what it was like now.... Well there were 4 other couples in the bar area..... Come on guys look at your happy hour again"
