Melissa M.,"Los Angeles, CA",147,47,637,4.0,11/28/2017,"Taken for what it really is, a chain restaurant, BJ's is a great place for a family dinner, especially on Monday nights during football season!  Appetizer specials during football (though there are daily specials) and tv's playing silently in the background, let you keep up on the game while still able to have a conversation without having to yell like in a typical sports bar.   The menu prices are a fair value in Westwood and the service has always been anywhere from good to great!  There is free parking for the lunch hour just down the block, and plenty of inexpensive pay lots for the dinner hour very close by."
Kenisha D.,"Austin, TX",15,34,80,2.0,12/11/2017,"This location is really small and only serves beer and wine. I wish I knew that prior to walking in because I desperately wanted a margarita. Just a heads up, there's only metered parking and a $6 parking lot. There are lots of food places nearby, so I'm wishing that I didn't go for the chain and just tried something new and different in Westwood. The service was stellar. I'd give service 5 stars because every staff person that I interacted with was fantastic. They were helpful, gave great suggestions on new beers to try, and were really responsive to requests for extra napkins, utensils, etc. The food was just meh. I ordered the grilled chicken alfredo and it had a whole lotta chicken but barely any broccoli. I wish that I ordered something different. All in all, I probably won't come back to this particular location for the food, but the people were friendly so I may come back for some conversation."
Bob D.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",12,34,1,5.0,11/6/2017,I really struggled with this rating because we had a great meal but it was not perfect. On the down side the roasted asparagus was woody and the soup was just okay. The steak however gets 5+ stars. It was without a doubt the best steak I have had in years. When I ordered I did not realize that they had their own line of beers. I ordered a Corona which they did not have but the waiter offered to match that to one of their beers. The match was excellent and certainly did not miss my normal brand name.
Moises G.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",19,11,,4.0,1/5/2018,"The food is what you expect from BJ's.  Decent pizza (although the Mediterranean chicken pizza is great), and good beer (the Jeremiah red is pretty damn good). I was here last Saturday evening before the restaurant got busy.  Service was friendly.  The hostess was a bit rude, though.  Luckily, I only had to deal with her for less than a minute. I'd come back for the food, beer and friendly service."
Tactical Girl L.,"South Pasadena, CA",22,19,8,5.0,10/10/2017,"When you've just finished a long 22-hour workday, lost a bunch of blood, asked to slam your knees on the ground repeatedly, and duck walk in your underwear (not even sexy ones, but... you know, the granny fanny kind), you just fall in LOVE with anyone who gives you beer samples.  That savior for me was David, who introduced a couple new beer samples to me to help out -- because my brain was fried and I couldn't make up my mind.  David also advised I order my steak medium rare - my kinda server!!  He was right. The steak was excellent, prepared just as described. Fresh. Hot. Touch of Spicy. Spanks the tongue.  David was fun, friendly, attentive, genuine and welcoming. Juicy steak. Cold beer.  The manager Kimberly was so sweet and hardworking too. She went out of her way to offer me a bag for my box of leftovers, and even bagged it for me and cleared my table.  Military discounts offered here too, all y'all uniform people.  #therealmen #savage #gentlemen"
Dylan Keville B.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,22,53,5.0,12/20/2017,The best service ever I love this place the roasted beet salad is the best salad I've ever had and I love there pizzas. I also like the ahi salad
Daniel O.,"Los Angeles, CA",290,4,3,2.0,10/28/2017,"The waiters always seem to be in a daze when I eat in or pick up food here. I arrived at the restaurant to wait twenty minutes after being seated to have any introduction or service from the staff. During this time the waiters were chatting to each other and eventually I had to flag down the manager. The manager was great and personally took care of my table. I attempted to give him a personal tip, but he would not take it. Stand up guy. +1 star for you. Today, I ordered for pick up. A prime rib with mashed potatoes and asparagus, chicken Alfredo pasta, and a chocolate chip pazookie. I brought the food back to my place only to find that my prime rib did was missing the mashed potatoes, and more importantly, the au jus. Come on guys. I didn't expect I would need to check for a common sense item... What finally led me to write this review were the utensils that came with my order. Two spoons. Thanks guys. I am left to think that the the servers I have encountered here are clearly in some form of daze."
Rana S.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",43,135,720,2.0,7/30/2017,"Gosh. Honestly we should have just had the pizzoki (sp?) and left. I haven't been to BJs in for we and today reminded me why. With the exception of the cool architecture,  lighting, and sports (although nothing interesting was on) this place is less than average.  We went around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch. The place was pretty empty. I think there must have been a total of 6 or 7 tables occupied but the place was full of employees all running around seemingly to know where. You know where everyone plays busy, that was the case here.  We were seated at a booth in the main bar area which was great for tv watching- although, like I said, nothing interesting to follow.  We were first approached by a waitress who took our drink order and asked if we were ready to order- we literally had just been seated. Odd. Anyways she left. A second person brought out our drinks. Then a third employee came and introduced himself as our waiter. So confusing.  Anyways we ordered a spinach artichoke dip to start; a Mediterranean deep dish; some chicken wings; and a salad. The food is SO EXCESSIVELY SALTY. All of it. I am not exaggerating. All the food: from the dip to the pizza and chicken wings. All of it was so salty. If you have blood pressure issues, be careful here.  The dip was the highlight. It was the least salty. The chicken, which is called a siracha something chicken wing, and it tasted like vinegar. The pizza was really just a deep pan of bread, with a little bit of pesto, some salty chicken cubes and kalamata olives. All salty and just not fresh. They assemble food. Don't cook good. The salad was also good. It was quite healthy but the blueberries in it were not fresh. The food was just meh at best. Honestly we didn't enjoy any of it.  Then, I took the girls to the restroom and had my partner ask for ranch. We came back and the ranch hadn't been right out. Of course at this pint we are the waiter just walking back and forth, with determination.i didn't see him doing anything that would take time away from a cup of ranch, but nonetheless it took him a good 15 minutes to bring the ranch.  Anyways it wasn't our best meal. I am convinced the salt amount could cause a heart attack. It was out of control. We probably won't be returning.  *Yelp 100 Challenge-2017*"
Cmoney H.,"Hawthorne, CA",35,20,1,1.0,11/21/2017,"I'll keep it simple I'm staying in the hospital right now and I figured it would be better than hospital food, but the burger I ordered from BJ's taste worse. Granted I just got pretty much beef and a bun but I'm serious the beef tasted better from the hospital. Really gone downhill. Guess they should stick to pizza. Usually would not waste my time to write a review but it was that awful. Not to mention I tried to call my take-out order in and by the time my father walked from my hospital room down to BJ's I was still on hold. Making me lose hope in the food industry."
Kendra M.,"Boston, MA",11,172,10,2.0,6/4/2017,"Cons: -a ""brew house"" without a legitimate bar?? -bar aside, the atmosphere is lacking. It reminds me of a TGI Fridays or Red Robin, just with much less decor  -I had the house brewed oasis amber beer. It lacked character and wasn't very good. It was just beer flavored beer.  Pros: -good location -our server was attentive and polite"
Jerald D.,"Los Angeles, CA",241,7,,5.0,10/3/2017,"I usually come here for birthdays and get-togethers with classmates but I decided to go yesterday by myself in honour of getting a free Pizookie, and as usual with every time I've gone here, I have never been disappointed with the service or quality of the food here. When I walked in yesterday around lunch time, the place was surprisingly empty, it was only me and two other patrons during the time I was there eating, but I took the assumption that everyone was in class and would be coming in later, I typically come here at night, but I guess the afternoon holds a different crowd for BJs. I sat down and was approached by the waiter (who actually didn't tell me his name... shame... he was really good.) and he handled my selection of food well and responded back quickly with anything I needed. I assumed this was because of the lack of patrons in the restaurant, but I wasn't complaining with the quick service. I only ordered the classic BJs burger and added bacon onto to it so I can push myself over the $10 threshold to get a free Pizookie, and the burger was extremely satisfying and the fries were at a satisfying level. The Pizookie was just the icing on the cake of my visit, not because it was free, but because it's a staple of the BJs restaurants all around. I had a quick in-and-out experience with this place which was fine because that's what I needed because I had class a few hours afterwards and I wanted my Pizookie fix. I really wish I got my waiter's name because although with an empty restaurant, he was very attentive and looked like he cared about the people he serves.  Also the TVs were on the sports channel, so eating alone wasn't so bad when I had my daily fix of sports news. If my waiter reads this, thank you for your kind help!"
Alicia O.,"Lynwood, CA",213,216,188,4.0,10/25/2017,"So I was driving around and I not only got lost but I'm lost in a UNI...not sure how it happened but its happened. I decided I was hungry, yelped and saw that there was a BJ's near so I headed over. Now I wasn't sure what to expect tbh. But the place was nice and clean. The staff was friendly and service was fast. The food was quick to come out and it tasted very nice and of course the beer was wonderful!"
Pegah Y.,"Washington, DC",1447,2359,6598,5.0,6/12/2016,"I LOVE BJ's!  And I missed it so much.  My now husband (then fiance) visited BJ's in Westwood in March of this year and he loves it as much as I do.  We had just landed at LAX and were so exhausted and realized we'd rather go to a sit-down restaurant as opposed to waiting around at In N Out's drive-through line, so we made our way over to BJ's in Westwood!  We were able to find street parking not too far away (the Broxton Lot is usually reliable, but was not open that evening).   We both went with burgers!  I went with the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe (housemade guacamole, smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapens, while my husband (then fiance) ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger (with applewood smokd bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, mayonnaise, and BJ's signature burger sauce).  My husband (then fiance) also ordered a beer, while I ordered wine.  BJ's is famous for their beer (and their tastings), so he definitely was not disappointed. We both LOVED BJ's!  I have so many good memories there, including my 21st birthday dinner, numerous other friends' birthday dinners, and other events!  Their burgers, pizzas, and pizookies are spectacular!   I will continue going there for years to come :)"
Leila G.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,6,,3.0,11/12/2017,"Without doubt the Mediterranean pizza was delicious and tasted good. Its bread were puffy and well baked, enough cheese, and the olive on it taste good and it could be less salty ( only olives) but I give 3 stars because I think it could be Cheaper. $31 for a big size, (not super big- normal big :) also you need to pay for park meter -parking-if you could find any spot! So the quality is good and I really suggest it."
Matt H.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,272,15,1.0,12/3/2016,"I am not sure how to think about my experience at this restaurant. See if you can figure it out.  I ordered a salad. I wanted bread first, because i was hungry and bread shows up fast. ""We can't do that."" This is a restaurant that bakes pizza and serves burgers and sandwiches. After a Lot of effort, and calculations for how to get the cash register to accept it, it was agreed that I could have two slices of toasted bread for two dollars. They arrived to the table after the check."
Suhani A.,"Los Angeles, CA",210,103,115,5.0,1/21/2017,This is my place to go for Deep Dish Pizza! Avocado rolls are a must here whether you're a vegetarian or a non vegetarian! Oh and the best thing on the menu are the different pizookies they offer for dessert!!
Cody L.,"Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,1,1.0,8/23/2017,This is my first review on yelp but seemed like I had to share this terrible picture of someone that hand scooped my mashed potatoes before giving me my takeout.  Aside from the very small $20 steak the hand scooped potatoes is ridiculous.  This specific BJ's is garbage.  This will be the second and last time I get jammed up service at this place.
Tremaine E.,"Los Angeles, CA",559,263,316,3.0,10/25/2016,"BJ's is the restaurant equivalent of PC: political correctness. It's the go-to place in Westwood when you want to make a totally vanilla choice that will not offend anybody's taste buds, yet it doesn't really say anything at all of worth.  Its menu of everything from salads to burgers to jambalaya (which I like the most yet is the most expensive at around $18) is so expertly crafted such that any goer simply cannot say, ""oh, I can't eat anything here."" And yet, when the food comes out, it's so un-noteworthy.  You know how when you go to a restaurant and then the dish someone ordered finally hits the table and then everyone goes up in a chorus of ""Oooohhh that looks goooodddd""? Yeah, I have never heard that at BJ's. It's usually just a nod for acknowledgment of receipt. That said, I mean, the beers on tap here are kind of cool--but again, not very noteworthy.  So if you want a place where everyone can eat, where there will always be a seat, then BJ's is the place to beat. Oh, yeah, and pizookies--now PIZOOKIES are ""Oooohhh that looks goooodddd""."
Sa K.,"Fullerton, CA",2,3,2,1.0,9/3/2017,"I am a fan of BJ's restaurant but this particular location is by far the worst one! It was my second time there, the first time I was with a group of people and I ordered the Mediterranean pizza and was really bad but the service was okay! Nothing special but not bad. Second time we went there for birthday celebration and it was a surprise for BD boy. Upon our arrival we secretly told them to bring a cake after our food and surprise the guy but here is what happened: We ordered our food as always and asked for drinks, the drinks came out really late almost with the food, we needed to ask our server to fill out our waters but it seemed he didn't care. We even told him we're gonna drink a lot of water in a funny way to have his attention but didn't work! We were still working on our food and they brought us the check without even asking if we wanna have dessert or not and the server totally forgot about the birthday boy!!  We told the guy who bring us the check to talk to our server but he said he's already gone!! Without even notifying us. At the end they ruined the surprise birthday and we had an awful dinner! I will definitely not gonna be back in this BJ's and recommend everyone to try other locations. Anything would be better than this trashy restaurant.  Btw even the food doesn't have the same quality as you can see in other reviews!"
Ishita G.,"Los Angeles, CA",170,15,1,3.0,7/27/2017,"BJ's is extremely average food-wise. The burgers are always have disproportionate condiments, the fries are flailing, and the deep-dish pizza is also quite average. The nacho pizza is above average (pretty good), and they have a good selection of beers, though. The brunch pancakes are also fat and mealy. All in all, the food is just about okay. But the pizookie is just amazing, they have a lot of variety in pizookies, the big one is good to share between two people, and the mini-pizookie is easily finished by one. My personal favorite is the macadamia nut and white chocolate. People should honestly ditch Diddy Riese and stick to BJ's pizookies. The place always has tons of seating, the servers are always sweet and chirpy, overall pretty good vibe for a late night snack, but there's very few things you could truly like on the menu."
Haley A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1263,3,1,1.0,12/12/2017,"I love BJ's food in general, but I am giving this location a 1 star because of the manager named Kimberly who was EXTREMELY rude to me. I work for Doordash and I was simply coming to pick up an order and she was the hostess at the front. When I came in she already had a seemingly mean look on her face, and then I said ""Hi, I'm here to pick up an order for Doordash"" and she replied with an attitude that she hasn't received the order yet and that she's been having issues all day with them. She seemed to be getting mad at me for just being there... Anyways, I contact doordash about the issue and they call her to configure it... I go back in to ask if she finally has gotten the order and she says (in a rude away again) and seems very annoyed with me, that she just got it, so I ask how long does she think it might take since I'm delIvering food and I don't want my customer to be upset... And she replies in a very mean way ""I don't know that because I literally just put in the order and if you could just wait over there please"" so at this point I ask her to not give me attitude and that I'm just doing my job... She continued to be even more rude and asked for my name, so I asked her for her name and if I could speak to a manager. She let me know that SHE was the manager and I was very surprised to hear this because I felt very disrespected and for a manager this was TERRIBLE customer service, even if I'm not eating here and just picking up an order. So, now as I am waiting for the food to be ready (which is also taking forever), I am writing this. Please have a word with this manager Kimberly. She made my visit here very unpleasant. UPDATE: after ALL that waiting for about 25 mins... She calls doordash to let them know that I have to leave and I ended up not even being able to finish the order and receive my original pay for it. I am very frustrated because I did not do a single thing wrong and yet I was the one that was told to leave and punished for her having an attitude and having terrible customer service! This lady should NOT be a manager."
Vanessa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",513,71,35,5.0,4/28/2017,"This review is deserved for 2 main reasons: 1. The Prime Rib special is pretty good! I chose medium rare and it was excellent. To my surprise, the asparagus was delicious and the pizookie excellent as always.  2. The Quality Control Server (?) not sure of his exact title or name, but he was awesome! He continuously checked on me throughout my meal and when there was an issue, he handled it immediately and without any question or fuss. He was wearing a button down blue shirt with khaki pants. This is the customer service that always makes my dining experience the best possible. Thank you for making my BJ's experience wonderful."
Meghan O.,"Santa Monica, CA",8,14,1,1.0,8/1/2017,We ordered a catering order for work.  They sent BURNT chocolate chip cookies.  Super gross.
K D.,"Culver City, Los Angeles, CA",0,24,4,5.0,8/27/2017,I went here when they first open and the service was terrible. I decided to give a try again couple years later and big difference. The server was quick to take out order and food came out fast. The prime rib is very tasty and my favorite but only served on the weekends. I've been back 4 times in the last month and will continue going back. Also the ribs are very tasty and falling off the bone.
Karen L.,"Los Angeles, CA",186,127,157,3.0,9/3/2016,"BJ's is your typical American family restaurant/sports bar: TVs playing the latest game hanging on the walls, laminated menus, a busy atmosphere, etc. I've been here a couple times, and out of all the entrees I've tried, I think the balsamic chicken stood out to me as the best. But, their food isn't the kind that makes you want to come back a second time. The flavours are unmemorable and the variety of food that they serve can be found at a multitude of other similar style restaurants.  They do have one saving grace though...the PIZOOKIE. It's a cookie cooked in a little pizza pan that is served with ice cream on top. I got the monkey bread pizookie, which tasted like a cinnamon roll and was fluffy with caramelized edges that blended perfectly with the vanilla ice cream on top. I would definitely recommend monkey bread over other more traditional flavours like salted caramel, cookies and cream, etc. though those are great too. If you're in the area and don't like any of the other restaurants or want to try a pizookie, then BJ's might be the place for you. But, I wouldn't make a trip out especially to come here."
Adrienne B.,"Tujunga, CA",148,171,196,3.0,8/14/2016,"I was in the Westwood Downtown area after visiting the hospital. To be honest, this is the smallest BJ's I have ever encountered! It does not have its own bar (which limits its drink menu to only BJ's brewery, and mostly non-alcoholic drinks). It has both an upstairs and downstairs area, which literally could have been just one floor plan... the organization of this place is really weird and small. Only two servers are running the whole place. Our server was Kayla. Super sweet girl! I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya, which is my go-to choice at BJ's and my cousin ordered a Chicken BBQ Pizza. My food came in earlier and our server apologized because she put in the wrong order and they made the wrong pizza therefore we had to wait a little more. Which was completely fine! She was very upset and constantly apologized, gave us free garlic bread, and said that dessert was on her, which was a very sweet offer. I understand, because I'm a waitress myself and do make similar mistakes, therefore we were very patient with our orders and the service we were receiving. I was looking forward to ordering a brew, but there weren't many choices, so I went with a Strawberry Lemonade instead and it was delicious! Refills were constantly being brought.  BJ's is always a good place to try. I just wish they had a bar or more drinks to provide, since they are located in a very prime location."
Tony S.,"Los Angeles, CA",443,4,1,4.0,8/5/2017,"Great place! Very diverse menu, probably one if the better cooked burgers I've had in recent years. The polite faces and prompt service is what made this experience special. I will be back!"
Esther C.,"Los Angeles, CA",1654,332,158,4.0,7/6/2016,"who doesn't love pazookies and pizza???  if you say you, then get outta here! BJ's has SOLID good food, great drinks, alcohol and sports on 10 TVs for the hubs.  Plus it's in the heart of Westwood where we can walk to a number of different places for date night. =) Love this place!  Service is great, food is solid and the portions are huuuuge.   Recommendations: Supreme or White Pizza Watermelon Salad Cheesy Wedge Fries Avocado Rolls Flatbread Pizzas Chocolate Chip or Peanut Butter Cookies Pazookie"
Reeve B.,"La Habra, CA",729,7,2,5.0,6/1/2017,"Loving coming to Bjs on Thursdays for the ribs, salads, soup, and don't forget the best of it all PIZOOKIE!!  This was my first time coming to the Westwood location, but I did to meet a friend. Parking was tough, but I lucked out finding a spot. The location is cool with the two stories, but a bummer there is no bar. Our experience was wonderful as always with the yummy food and excellent service Trey provided. Really appreciate great hospitality when I see it. I would definitely come back to this location again. Maybe on a Monday though for the pizza deal (:"
Nancy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,5.0,11/25/2017,Ordered the chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I tend to go for pastas wherever I go and I took a chance on the sandwich. The fries were great too. Best decision ever!
Catherine P.,"Los Angeles, CA",249,73,114,4.0,7/10/2016,"This place lies in Westwood in the area around UCLA so it's a great place to go for group gatherings. Their lunch menu is great and decently priced, but dinner is good as well. Overall food was average, pizzas and burgers aren't out of the extraordinary but they are still good. My favorite thing to get here are definitely the pazookies, they are amazing! If you don't know what that is, it is a soft warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top! The ghiradelli chocolate one is my absolute favorite and perfect if you're a chocolate lover like me. Their beers/ciders are also very good. My favorite is the berry burst cider, yum! Service overall has been OK. Service tends to be on the slower side, since they always seem to be short of staff, but the waiters and waitresses are all very nice. So in general, it's not a bad place to go eat at, would definitely recommend eating here if you're with a big group!"
Richard P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",103,89,52,2.0,1/17/2017,"This place is whack as hell. We came in around 11pm and the place wasn't too poppin besides a single large party of about 14. For some reason when they were done with the dishes meant for this large party, they just left it under the heat lamps for literally 15+ minutes. I'm over here like... Wtf? That better not be our food. It turned out to be there food, but sure enough they gave our food the same treatment.  So when i got my jalapeño burger it was lukewarm and unsatisfying since it had just been sitting under the heat lamp for so long. Keep in mind there is not many customers here. The only possible explanation for keeping it under the heat lamps for so long is if they wanted to serve it to everyone at once. But Damn you gonna just leave it there for 15 minutes?  They either forgot my girlfriend's meal or they just were slow as hell because by the time she got her pasta dish, the other 4 of us in the party had essentially finished our meal. As an apology, her meal was free and we got a free pizookie, which keeps this from being a 1 star review."
Cindy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,168,291,4.0,7/2/2017,"it would be great if they take reservation even for smaller groups but im happy with the waiting system (they text you when your table is ready) so i don't understand why they only have 3stars in general, and because of that, i was not expecting anything and turns out to be REAL GOOD to start with, we had the garlic knots which, when it came, did not look amazing at all, i actually thought about saving it for the pizza instead but i was glad i didnt do that and totally ATE THE WHOLE PIECE (and wanted more!) - it's not like any regular bread, it's chewy! then the brussels spout salad went so well with the nuts and cheese! then it was the deep dish pizza (i was kinda glad it was not the chicago type): we ordered the classic i beleive? it came wtih olives, spinach, mushroom, pepperoni and cheese- YUM! the thickness of the pie was JUST RIGHT- 2 pieces got me SO FULL but we had to try the pizookie- forgot the whole name, but it has ""monkey"" in the name- it was crazy good! just order it, trust me. down to come back for more pizzaaaaa :P"
Stephanie H.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",0,1,,1.0,5/15/2017,We came here to celebrate Mother's Day and will definitely not be coming back. Our server hardly came to our table. We waited about an hour for our food and when it finally arrived our burgers were burnt. We had to wait about 20 mins to have our burgers redone. Once we were handed the total it took us such a long time to pay since our waitress was no where to be found.
Christine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",376,312,844,4.0,4/26/2016,I come to BJs specifically for their pizookies (seriously best thing they have). My boyfriend and I couldn't choose between salted caramel and cookies and cream until our waitress said we could have both! :). Their food is average. Quite pricey for what you get but definitely a good restaurant for a large party and to watch games!
Robert P.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,1,1.0,11/3/2017,Firt time eating here and the service was horrible we ordered our drinks which was two cokes mixed drink and a beer and mozzarella sticks and avocado egg rolls we never received our appetizer nor the beer definitely not coming back here food wasn't great wish I could rate 0 stars
Stevi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",145,96,124,5.0,4/22/2016,Not a huge fan of chain restaurants but ever since moving to La been curious about the food.  I was very presently surprised how good the food was. I order on app of mozzarella sticks which I assumed would only come with maybe 4 sticks came with about 10!! So it was easy to share with the table! I got the spaghetti with meatballs. I know what you're thinking... so basic to order but it had a nice kick a spice that was so perfectly seasoned. It was great. The potions were also huge and I had enough to enjoy later at home!  The pizza was great as well but if you are really hungry they are kind of small so don't get the smallest pie!  Overall my experience was great and would totally go again !
Keoniis C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/8/2017,"This is by far the worst BJ's ever. Who even ALLOWED this place to be opened in the first place? Me and my girlfriend ate here. She couldn't even order a cocktail because guess what? This location has no bar!!! I've never been to a BJ's that didn't have a bar. The food wasn't even hot, tasted and looked as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp, kinda like at buffets. The floor is atrocious, looks like it hadn't been cleaned properly in years. Why they would choose carpet at this location is beyond me. Left extremely dissatisfied, felt like a waste of time and money. If I could give this place negative stars I would. Please save yourself the time and money and don't eat here, maybe then they'll lose business and finally be forced to shut down."
