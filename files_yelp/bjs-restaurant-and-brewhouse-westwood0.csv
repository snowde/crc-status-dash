Husam S.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,4,,4.0,9/1/2012,"It's really a pretty good place! Their food's amazing and the best part... their pizzookies are on another level... if you get that macadamia, it really is on its own level... if you go, this is a must try!"
Karen L.,"Seattle, WA",296,904,341,4.0,11/10/2010,"I really like BJ's, mostly because of their pizookies!! In case you're wondering, a pizookie is a huge cookie with ice cream on top! So good!! Their food is good too, though a bit expensive. I've tried the parmesan crusted chicken, and it's pretty good. Their pizzas are yummy too--I think any of them would be a good choice. The ambiance of the place is great, too, because it has a really upbeat vibe to it. It's overall a great place to hang out with friends."
Chris C.,"Irvine, CA",187,832,2826,3.0,1/29/2010,"Solid chain deep dish pizza and brewery.  BJ's isn't going to win any awards for food, atmosphere, or service, but you can count on a good meal that is not going to break the bank (although it's a bit pricey if you are on a UCLA student budget). The beer selection here is good.  More importantly, it is brewed on sight.  You can get a sampler if you want to try everything, but my personal favorite is the Nutty Brewnette. The deep dish pizza here is good.  It's not going to make you forget about your recent trip to Zachary's up north or your favorite Chicago pizza place, but you'll be happy with it.  The appetizers are pretty standard fare - all good, but value for dollar you are better off sharing a pizza and salad.  If you want a salad for a meal, again they are pretty standard, but made well and flavorful. One thing to note about this particular location - I have never had a Pizookie at this BJs (although I have had them at other BJs, and they are very good).  Why?  Because Diddy friggin' Riese is right across the street.  For just $1.50 you can get a killer, home-made ice cream sandwich.  Trust me on this, save a few bucks and walk across the street. Another cultural note, the UCLA basketball team has come here as a group to eat after a game before.  Not sure if this is a regular thing, but if you see 12 really tall college guys and some older coach type guys, it might be them."
Rachel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",711,688,527,3.0,10/15/2010,"The pizookie is the main reason to return to BJ's, and it deserves 5 stars. Beer is good. Food is good. Pizookie is the just amazing cookie goodness. There are different cookies, but I think classic chocolate chip is still the best. The cookie is so warm that ice cream just melts. Even though you want to take your time and savor it, you have to speed up the bites so it's not one melted mess. My favorite part is the last bottom chocolate bits still stuck on the pan just like getting those last bits from a paella pan. It has a crunch as concentrated sweetness that will give you a good sugar rush. I tried eating a whole one myselft. It was difficult but possible. However, I'm better off just sharing and making sure I get the most.   This BJ's has good energy especially during play off season. The staff is friendly, and it's a good place to get good food for a reasonable price in Westwood."
Chris B.,"Bakersfield, CA",27,50,29,4.0,8/12/2014,"This place is always good. Been staying by the hospital for a few weeks and have been to this BJ's a few times, never unsatisfied. The buffalo chicken pizza is my all time favorite and the hand crafted root beer is wonderful."
C.C. S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",244,118,12,3.0,4/30/2012,"Just had lunch here with some coworkers.  I must admit, I am dieting as of yesterday so I couldn't try the pizza or burgers which is what they're known for. There was a pretty extensive menu that included a lot of healthy options under 600 calories.  I had the chicken tacos with black beans.  They were fine, nothing extraordinary but a nice, guilt free lunch. The birthday boy ordered and Oreo ""Pizookie"".  It's a cookie, thin-cut, like a pizza.  It's topped with ice cream and whipped cream.  It was warm and melty and delicious.  I refrained and only had two bites but I wanted to punch myself in the face for being on a diet.  The dessert was 4.5-star but alas, I can't rate a place based purely on sugar-treats or they'd all be 4 and 5-star."
Travis L.,"Philadelphia, PA",177,164,,2.0,6/15/2012,"You know, having come here numerous times for dinners and events, I hoped to have better things to say, but of course, the last visit really ruined anything positive I had in mind. It's simple. I make a reservation at 7:30 PM. I should be seated at 7:30 PM. Instead, it's 20 minutes after, and the ladies up front had the nerve to just hand me a buzzer, so myself and the rest of my party (14 others) are to wait for the table we reserved. ""Um, well, there aren't any tables right now."" Uh, yeah, that's why we made reservations. A throwaway apology and not even a single attempt to make up for it. I was so reluctant to give the 8 or more gratuity. This is absolutely unacceptable. Either keep to your reservations or don't have a reservation system at all. Food-wise, it's mediocre with some interesting dishes. Appetizer combo is really great to share, as well as most of the burgers. The pastas tend to be incredibly oily and salty. The light menu is interesting, which I will say is quite good in terms of variety. The pizookies are, of course, what you come for, but as heavy and as sweet as they are, the appeal is only so much."
CB K.,"Acton, CA",0,8,,5.0,11/4/2014,Love the food there!!! Yum and big portions. Eaten at the one in Palmdale too and love that one too.
Swati V.,"San Jose, CA",289,72,49,4.0,2/8/2014,"Most of these reviews are about the pizza at BJs but I think the best part about this place is the beer and the burgers. First of all, I'm vegetarian and I must say that the BJs veggie patty is my favorite substitute veggie patty out of all the places I've tried. Island's is a close second, but this still takes the cake for me. The crispy jalapeño burger is by far my favorite, mostly because of the crispy jalapeños inside (i love anything fried) and also because the veggie patty doesn't taste like a lump of potatoes. I also found one of my favorite beers here, the PM porter. It's so creamy and chocolatey perfectly bitter. For Guinness lovers, it's almost like a creamy guinness double stout, or a sweeter oatmeal stout. If you're feeling something a little fruitier, the Black Velvet at BJs is also amazing. It's a berry cider mixed with the PM porter and it tastes like a dark chocolate cake with a tart raspberry dressing. Writing about it makes me want to go get one right now! The lighter beers are pretty good too (i'm not a huge fan of the amber and red ales), but I'd recommend the Blonde as well if you aren't a dark beer person.  Crispy jalapeño burger with fries and ranch on the side + a black velvet = the perfect meal. If you're in the mood for something more than just the pizookie (which is justified in its amazingness) or pizza, try the burgers!"
Tiffany N.,"West Covina, CA",340,547,167,4.0,9/15/2012,"Even though this location is a small one, it was a nice exchange since we're so use to going to a big and loud one. The staff are all really nice and made sure we got our food served & all. definitely will be coming back next time i'm in the area."
Josie D.,"London, United Kingdom",361,333,193,2.0,9/5/2010,"This review is for BJ's catering service. My office orders BJ's pizza monthly. I really really don't like it. The pizza is less than ordinary. The salad is really so - so. Nothing impressive. Sorry. I heard it is pretty good when you are actually at the restaurant, but for delivery? I'd rather get Papa J"
Andre N.,"Alhambra, CA",456,445,257,2.0,6/25/2012,"I used to think this place was OK, but maybe Ive become more enlightened in the past couple years and developed a better understanding of quality and quantity of food and service as well. Finally came hear maybe after a year of not going for personal reasons. Anyways came with my coworker and they immediately sat us down. First thing I noticed was we were given paper napkins, looked around and did see some tables had the traditional cloth ones and others had paper. Has BJ's experienced some economic problems? Also no utensils? What, had to asked after the meal came, strangely enough they gave me spaghetti, with a spoon? I'm not Italian, even though in Italy I may look like one, but I never heard of eating spaghetti with a spoon. Spagettii was ok, meat sauce good, though not too special. I also had the chili which I used to love, but something changed or maybe my taste buds changed, but it was just not very good and just seemed to come out of a can. Bad batch who knows.  I been to other BJ's and their usually ok, but this time and this location, just wasn't up to par."
Katherine Y.,"San Francisco, CA",87,57,33,3.0,12/24/2012,"Came on a Sunday during football games, so there were a bunch of college guys watching and hollering to the game. I really don't mind that, except I was here with my family, so it was kind of awkward... We ordered the BJ's Favorite, which is basically a traditional supreme with the standard meat and vegetables. It's labeled a 'deep dish' pizza, but I didn't think there was any stuffing to warrant that label. With that said, it was a pretty good thick pizza! If it were up to me I'd try to Mediterranean! That sounded really good..."
Paul C.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",10,48,10,1.0,11/29/2013,"Food here is decent, but service gets worse every time we come. They seem understaffed and poorly trained. Weve been here for more than half an hour so far and have yet to even receive our appetizer. Had to ask the manager to take our food order because our waiter disappeared. This place is a joke."
Lauren S.,"Falls Church, VA",73,324,24,2.0,9/26/2011,"Underwhelming. I went for the new lunch specials, and although they advertise a ""starting"" price at $5.95, the options at this price are few and far between. Most lunch options were between $7.95 and $8.95, and when you include tax and tip, your up to $10-$11. So be prepared, I found the portions good, but our service was below average. Our first courses and mains came out within 30 seconds of eachother, and when you're eating with another person at a two person table, all of the sudden you're drowning in plates/spoons/glasses/etc. The waiter seemed a little insensitive to the fact we needed to get out in a hurry (we had an hour for lunch and needed to get back to work). I think they could streamline their lunch service a bit to make things more lunch-time friendly."
Jason K.,"Lomita, CA",103,524,101,4.0,6/7/2010,"I've been to a number of different BJ's locations and they are all very consistent.  The Chicago style pizza is thick, filling, very good, loaded with toppings (of which there are a large variety to choose from), and pretty authentic in nature.  The prices are a bit high, but they provide good quality ingredients and taste for that price. I have gotten the classic calzone (which is very filling), the shrimp tacos (a less caloric options with some good flavor), the breaded chicken sandwich (simple and well executed), the shrimp in a white wine alfredo sauce (decent), and the pizookies (hehe) in the past as well.  They now provide all of the nutritional information for each menu item at the back of the menu for you to peruse what will be your undoing before making a choice. One of my favorite things about BJ's besides the pizza, though, is the selection of beers they offer.  They have a wide variety of bottle beers (some of which are pretty rare Belgians and such) at great prices.  Additionally, they have around 8-10 BJ's brewed beers on tap, of which many are excellent.  My wife and I really like the blonde.  She likes the Nutty Brewnette and the Jeremiah red as well.  I like the Porter and especially the Tatonka Imperial Stout.  All of these are like $5-$6 for a glass.  Good stuff!  If you like ciders, they have a great berry cider as well. The Westwood location is a bit small, which is kind of a bummer during dinner time on a Friday or Saturday night, so try to call in a res if you can, or at least come put your name in, then wander the village for a while till the table is ready. Summary: Great Chicago deep-dish.  Great beer selection.  Other menu items are good and range depending on what you like.  Overall, prices are fair.  Finish with Pizookie or Diddy Riese for dessert."
Priscilla Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,832,1893,3.0,5/5/2010,"I've been here three times!!! The first time was a group lunch. We ordered a lot of food. I enjoyed the pizza, cuz it was the first time I saw them served in that way. They are so big, and so much stuff on top. The appetizer was also good. I enjoy trying new food! 2nd time, there was less fun, since I found there only good pizza is BBQ Chicken, so we just order one. Not much fun. the 3rd time I tried the sandwich, nothing special. But the waitress was extremely energetic, which makes the meal better."
Anne G.,"Long Beach, CA",112,220,67,4.0,1/19/2012,"Pros: Good pizza, delicious hot wings, and tasty pizookies Cons: Long waits to be seated, food takes awhile to be served, bland ahi poke chips and not enough avocado to ahi ratio for the ahi appetizer - so my friend says I've always had a good experience at this BJ's and I had an exceptional experience several months ago. Our food took unusually long to come out so the manager came over without us even complaining and offered to give us our appetizer for free as an apology. I went again tonight and waited a long time for the food but that same special treatment didn't happen. Oh well, it's alright because the food was delicious as always. Get the 2 for $20 deal when it's going on!"
Jeannie K.,"Houston, TX",213,509,403,3.0,5/21/2010,"It's a pizza place in Westwood, what do you expect? The service was good, the beer pitcher's large, the avocado eggrolls were greasy but yummy with their sauce, the calzones were kind of cold inside but STUFFED, the Santa Fe salad is just a salad but has chunks of avocado, and the pizookie's too sweet but an indulgence.  If I'm in the area and I feel like carb overdose, sure, why not?"
Levon V.,"PORTER RANCH, CA",0,43,29,1.0,7/6/2015,I didn't like anything that we ordered.  Place looks dated.  Food was sub par.  I won't be going back that's for sure.
