Rob R.,"Fort Bliss, TX",0,2,1,3.0,5/19/2015,"My wife and I met at BJ's for our first date. Needless to say we are in love with what BJ's means to us. Sadly BJ's feels like over priced bowling alley food. After learning that BJ's started as a pizza joint we ordered the BJ's favorite deep dish ($20 for the medium) and it was such a disappointment. On the other hand my wife ordered the seared ahi salad and loved it! As for service it was just okay, our server was very attentive at first, but it took 25 mins to bring us a to go box and our check. This place may be better as a brew house, but definitely not our first pick for eats!"
Erika M.,"Corona, CA",0,2,1,1.0,2/23/2016,"I'm the LA area and they took down BJ's near the mall so this was our closet option. It isn't like any other BJ's that I've been too. It was kind of weird, you can see the cooks which made everything unflattering. And their dishes weren't clean they still had smudges on them which is disgusting. It was just sketchy and a gross environment."
Joseph K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",297,92,1928,5.0,12/5/2015,"Alex is a Very Beautiful, Funny, Thoughtful & Kind Person (Pretty Blonde - Long Hair) that makes your visit here Very Special. I know that many of the employees and servers and what not here are VERY busy but, Alex takes the time to see to your needs and maintains her composure throughout without flinching or trying to pass you off to another person. I know i'm not taking too much of ""her time"" with questions or ordering. Her Customer Service is Outstanding!!!"
Billie A.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,9,,1.0,11/20/2016,"Walked i to the restaurant and there was one person picking up a to go order. There were three girls at the register. We stood there patiently for about 5 minutes and they said nothing. Finally, I asked if anyone was working and they looked shocked and then asked if they could help us. Once we were seated 10 minutes went by and we had to stop a waiter to ask who was our waiter. She didn't know so she took our order. I have been to a lot of BJ'S, but never treated like this. Not one time were they apologetic. I guess they don't value their job so maybe they don't need to work here."
Christopher C.,"Sacramento, CA",1351,722,1078,4.0,8/21/2013,"Here for lunch today with a business colleague.  For a party of two we were seated immediately while other larger groups were crowded around the door waiting.  I guess the magic number here is two.   Service was decent.  Refills were brought without asking, our waitress was helpful, attentive, and polite.  The table and restrooms were clean.  I could not see the kitchen but the bathrooms are often a good indicator of how the kitchen will  look.   I ordered a sesame crispy chicken salad.  My food was very tasty and filling.  I was not happy with a waiter from another table who kept bumping into us and even slammed a plate into the back of my head on one occasion.  Hey it's not my fault we were seated here.  This guy seemed annoyed with us and I did everything I could to move out of his way.  Thought about complaining but no serious harm done.  All good.  Just 4-star review for the negative experience.   No big deal so even with this knuckle head waiter working here, I am still going 4-stars."
Ali T.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/1/2015,They forgot us! We came here to eat their favourite pizza. The place was full and they told us 20 min waiting line to be sit. We told our name and started waiting. After 20 min we were still waiting and there were other people that already sit even they came after us. We went inside and asked them again abd the girl just stares us like she didnt recognized us before. She told us the same thing. 20 min. Thank you for wasted time!
Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1857,947,3614,4.0,8/22/2013,"Despite the mixed reviews for BJ's, we ventured there for a lunch meeting. After waiting for about 15 minutes right in the middle of the lunch rush, we were seated and pleasantly greeted by our waiter who was at the end of his shift. For $6.75, I ordered a pepperoni mini pizza which was accompanied by a Caesar salad. I was more than surprised by the size of the salad, which filled a standard plate. The pizza was wonderful and unexpected for a brewhouse. The crust was thick but soft and not too oily. The sauce was chunky with visible pieces of tomatoes and the cheese created a crispy crust that was not overwhelming. Other diners at the table enjoyed other lunch specials including the shrimp teriyaki, chicken tenders and the flatbread pizza with a side salad. I was pleasantly surprised by this meal."
Ashley Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",457,95,140,2.0,4/6/2014,"The greek/buffalo chicken pizzas were both smothered in salt, it was barely edible. The salad we got was good, but way too expensive for the amount they give and overall quality of food is lacking for the price, especially being near a college campus. The pazookie is the only reason I give 2 stars. Delicious dessert that we've been eating here for years. Guess that's the only thing ill be coming back here for..."
Jason L.,"Los Angeles, CA",802,332,660,3.0,1/5/2014,"If LA were Chicago then BJ's would probably deserve 2 stars. But we're not. We're LA and it's hard to find deep dish pizza in this city so you take what you can get. BJ's is really not good deep dish, it's passable. There isn't enough grease, the dough isn't crispy enough. It has no character. Some of the combo's are good. White Pie is my personal favorite. But others lack in flavor and once again, personality. The pizza's here are like thick Pizza Hut pan pizzas... which i'm sure we all know, is okay to eat, but nothing you're ever going to crave.  Wide selection of beers on tap and of course don't forget to get a pazookie... of course you could always walk across the street and get Diddy Resse...."
Elissa S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,,1.0,7/13/2016,"The worst experience ever! The service is really good though but the food is terrible. Don't order steaks here since they don't know how to cook it well. We ordered median rear and they gave us over cooked ones. After we complained, they changed a new one, but that was too raw that I just could not eat. I tried one bite and felt really uncomfortable. I guess I will never come back or never order steaks. Before this experience, I tried salmon before and it was good. I ordered pasta before but they just messes up with the kind of pasta I ordered, the taste was ok."
Jennifer H.,"Monterey Park, CA",232,148,190,2.0,6/21/2013,"The best thing about BJ's: the pizookies. (+ 1 star for white macadamia nut pizookie, the best one ever) Everything else: Meh.  Unfortunately, this BJ's is the smallest one I've ever seen, and does not have any bar seating (-1 star for size/lack of bar). There are also no discounts on alcohol during happy hour, but to be fair it's a state policy because of it's location being so close to a university...but c'mon really? No alcohol during happy hour...is just like any other hour.  I've been to this BJ's both during peak and low hours and really, I haven't noticed much of a change in the service (-1 star for service). The waiters are less than attentive and do not know how to manage crowds or provide any assurance. Beware if you're coming during any sports game, especially the play offs/finals because this place will be packed...I mean PACKED. So much so, that the kitchen and chefs come to a stand still and just stop and watch the game along with everyone else. What's worse is that once the game finished, the food still took a long time to come out.  The meal prices are pretty high for what you get. The food is standard, and I wouldn't consider the options creative in any way, just your usual American food, with way too many calories for the average 2,000 calories/day ""diet."" (-1 star for price). What also bugs me is that the fries are really a hit or miss on any given day - sometimes they come out cold, sometimes they are less than crispy...you just never know.  My entrees of choice include: balsamic chicken, BJ's favorite pizza, and the turkey club.  Overall, BJ's is meh. I'd come here if others I am with want to, or if I'm craving a pizookie, but other than that...I see no reason in coming to BJ's."
Diane C.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",592,1015,529,3.0,6/5/2013,"How do write a review when it's completely lopsided? Well... Service is extremely slow.  Took 10 minutes for a waiter to come by to take the order even when there were only about 6 patrons total.  Took another 40 minutes for the food to come.  Waiter never refilled our water/iced tea. Aside from bad service... Thai Lettuce Wraps were incredible!  The Flat bread pizzas were excellent as well. My assessment...kitchen is doing great!  Service sucks!  If you don't mind bad service and want good food, than this can be a good place for you."
Jo S.,"North Hollywood, CA",219,688,3223,3.0,10/1/2013,"We've been going to BJ's on and off for more than 10 years, particularly at this location. It's a good option for dining in Westwood, especially since a lot of other places in the area went out of business recently (so sad to see). You can count on BJ's for a fun meal. We like their Jeremiah Red draft beer (amber), their burgers (I used to love their classic burgers on a French garlic baguette - they don't have them in their menu anymore and the California one (with avocado) and my husband likes their BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. Their fish and chips dish was OK, I had better and my husband wasn't thrilled with their battered shrimp - don't know if they still serve them. Sure, plenty of calories here, but from time to time it's OK to splurge. Service is usually good. It's a smaller location, I don't mind it, although I could do with less screens on the walls. And another minus, they don't have Happy Hour here! Recently we saw the ads w. their 2 for $20 deal. I called this location and they said they'll serve it till Nov. 11th. When we got in, the hostess didn't know if they still serve it, but they do. No adds around to let people know about it. You can get a small salad or a soup each, share a medium pizza and share a pizookie as desert for $19, 95. Not a bad deal.  I got their house salad, nothing great, just iceberg lettuce, 2 slices of cucumbers, 2 slices of tomatoes, shredded carrots and croutons. My husband got their tortilla soup, that was much better with chunks of avocados in it. He would have liked it hotter, but it was really good. We picked the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza (w. grilled garlic chicken, bacon, chopped tomatoes and onions, jack and cheddar cheese), it's plenty of it, took some leftovers at home. Very good, I enjoyed the crust, the fresh chopped tomatoes and red onions.  We picked the Triple Chocolate Ghirardelli Pizookie dessert and enjoyed it. Even if we ate at BJ's, many times before we never tried their desserts, their portions are so big that we never had room left for desert. So, if you're in the area, check it out, they have an extensive menu (besides pizza-s and burgers) and brew their beers, so they have a great selection. It's an OK place, nothing fancy. Could be fun."
Mike S.,"Los Angeles, CA",99,364,69,3.0,10/2/2015,"the food was tasty, the service was pretty good...the reason for the 3 stars instead of four is due to the look given when we asked for a condiment (from two different people over 10 min) and the look was from the second person noticing the ranch already arrived.  almost as if we were the ones that delayed the arrival to begin with.   kind of made the rest of the meal a bit odd...as though we did not feel welcome there any more."
Sarah K.,"Burbank, CA",120,964,139,2.0,9/6/2013,"I used to like BJ's but in the past few years, not a big fan. This one in particular, being in Westwood, means that parking sucks. I park in the lot across the street but that lot is almost always near full (or full).  The food at BJ's is OK. If you want greasy pizza, eh. The bazookies are OK but too much for me. Maybe I'm just getting old and can't eat grease and sugar anymore. Got a bacon cheeseburger. It was OK. I wanted In n' Out but my friend wanted chicken.  Go to In N Out if you want a burger. This place is OK if you have a group of people that all want different things."
Hye-Min O.,"Pleasanton, CA",629,124,392,4.0,8/27/2013,"A little on the pricier end, but if you're looking to celebrate and splurge a little more, this is definitely the place to be. It can get a bit crowded, but you should be fine if you come early/make reservations ahead of time. It's usually pretty crowded in the evenings, but the wait shouldn't be too long. BJ's is a common place for groups, so it can get pretty loud and feel a bit cramped, but the service is still decent. I would recommend the upper loft area, which is more secluded and quieter for a more intimate group gathering. Their deep dish pizzas are the way to go. The Barbecue Chicken and Great White are a couple of my favorites. The pastas are alright, but they are more known for their pizza. Their Pizookies are also very delicous, so I would recommend them if you have a little extra to spend on dessert!"
Benjamin S.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",133,6,3,1.0,6/27/2016,We came in thinking we will be in and out in a reasonable time walking over from UCLA medical center. We were seated immediately but we weren't acknowledged by any of the wait staff. It had taken our waiter 15 minutes to come over and introduced himself and take our drink orders. It was about another 10 minutes until we gotten our drinks. I'm extremely disappointed.
Henry H.,"Sherman Oaks, CA",25,14,3,2.0,2/24/2016,"Good food, good beer. But the service at lunchtime is s-l-o-w....MY GOD THEY ARE SLOW! Been here 45 minutes so far and still waiting for our food! WTF!?!?!"
Samantha T.,"Essex, MA",4,29,24,3.0,5/21/2015,"Definitely not the best BJs I've ever been to. They have a smaller menu than the other ones too. The food is just very average. I've been here a couple times, but I was here last night and it was my worst experience here to date. Poor service- they didn't seem to have enough staff and didn't even realize they hadn't given us place settings until we had to ask. I got an appetizer of calamari (had gotten it before and it was good) and it was not very good or crispy. We all got appetizers, and it took a very long time to come out. However, as always, the pazookie was delicious. Based on last nights experience I would give it 2 stars; however, in the past it hadn't been nearly as bad."
Meeso C.,"La Habra, CA",302,39,42,1.0,11/30/2015,I ordered a pizza Togo and they must have forgotten to put peppers on my pizza because it was just sprinkled on top raw uncooked. Instead of remaking it right they just gave it to me to take home. Annnnndd The server was very condescending the way she would answer my questions was rude! Never again.
