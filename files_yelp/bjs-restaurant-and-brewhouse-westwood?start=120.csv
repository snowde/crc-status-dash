J G.,"Folsom, CA",2,84,41,4.0,1/31/2016,Had the burger and fries. Good burger but the spot was dead. Oh well Westwood on an early Saturday. Good stuff Maynard!
Jocelyne R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/7/2016,"This BJ's has terrible customer service. I would give them no stars if I could. When trying to host a fundraiser for my organization, the staff here failed to mention many fundraiser guidelines. During the fundraiser, staff would not let our guests sit down even though there were tables available. Many of our guests ordered take out instead of eating in because they felt attacked. In addition, BJ's secured various other reservations of 30+ people at the same time of our fundraiser, causing many people to stay standing and waiting over 30 minutes to be seated. Particular staff members also kept rudely staring at my organization and or guests. We felt very uncomfortable and discriminated against. All we wanted to do was eat at our organizations favorite, but I can assure you we will never eat here nor host fundraisers here again."
Joleen L.,"San Diego, CA",4,69,14,1.0,8/29/2016,might have been more appetizing if they wiped their menus down. nothing worse than looking though a sticky menu while trying to decide what to eat.
Ryo F.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,25,,4.0,8/11/2014,"Bj's has been the go to American restaurant  in Westwood with a big group as a UCLA student. You order the pizzas, pastas and end the night with a huge pizookie. However, after dining here in a non-big group, I got to taste more of the good stuff. Good stuff as in appetizers. Avocado egg rolls were delicious and the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps was pretty good. The entrees were good and the dessert... well I should've ordered those pizookies. Should've, could've, would've. I didn't. My loss. On that note, the waiter should've been a little more attentive, but should've, could've, would've. It was still a good meal. Good food. Good date."
Tiana H.,"Austin, TX",1021,568,255,1.0,5/30/2014,"Horrible slow service even when they are empty. The waiter didn't know the menu and kept having to check on everything. Then food say under the lights for 15 mins while he chatted with the manager and staff. Food was cold and then order was wrong.  Pizza's are ALL premade and frozen, when you order they just add toppings and heat. Not fresh! On top of everything we did not get our order remade and still had to pay! I live 2 blocks away so it sucks that Icant be a regular because of the service."
Kevin W.,"Los Angeles, CA",550,20,,1.0,9/9/2015,"I'm not very picky with food, hands down the worst pizza I've ever had and the service was bad too, took 30 min for chips and dip and they weren't busy. I've had better pizza at 7- eleven DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
Ginger T.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,109,79,3.0,2/28/2014,"Haven't been to BJ's a lot, but I think it's a great place to eat during lunch time at Westwood.  The service is excellent. I count calories, and they have some low calorie dishes that are under 800.  I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken plate and it was very delicious.  I did not feel that I was missing out on not having a pizza or burger and fries. I've never gone there after hours or on weekends, but I would imagine that it is a very popular place to eat during those times."
Lois K.,"Cerritos, CA",575,411,762,4.0,11/2/2012,"The only reason I used to go to BJ's was their birthday pizookie. I went a handful of times in high school and college for various friends' bday celebrations. Food was okay but not that cheap and I am not a big pizza eater, so there was really nothing for me to crave there. Up until a few weeks ago, I would have given BJ's 3 stars.  But now they have introduced their lunch specials menu and now I'm actually trying to find excuses to eat lunch there and convince people to go with me! The variety keeps things interesting, and the healthy options and decent price (for Westwood) makes it a guilt-free experience too hehe. Last time I had the half flatbread pizza and salad and it was delicious (I love goat cheese!) and filling. My friend had the Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich and liked it. They have an unlimited soup and salad choice as well that is perfect for the (finally) fall-like weather. I'm going to get that next week when I drag one of my coworkers there for lunch!"
Lindsay K.,"San Clemente, CA",0,3,3,5.0,3/7/2015,"The cookies and cream pizookie is AMAZING! Very good service and atmosphere. My favorite place to go for a quick, good dessert."
Larry D.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,11,5,2.0,2/6/2016,"Pizza was good but that's is it.  Service horrible.  Forgot my soda twice after asking for it, forgot appetizer   Manager offered free dessert bit already had coupon from ucla for that.  At left gave us 1 pizza for free.   Disappointed"
JoAnna S.,"Simi Valley, CA",42,91,105,5.0,12/5/2014,This is the Best Restaurant. The atmosphere is casual with a young Vibe to it even though there are older folks there as well. The Restaurant is clean and the waiters and hostess are professional. The food is to die for. It's fresh as though they picked it out of the garden. The prices are comparable to any other 4 or 5 star restaurant. The staff is friendly and their service is quick. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!
Samantha R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,21,8,3.0,2/2/2016,"For some reason, every single time I eat here, they take forever and by the time I need to leave, my food is barely being served. I hate the service here and will only go if I have a lunch meeting for work."
Stephanie M.,"Culver City, CA",28,11,8,1.0,7/31/2015,Terrible how long they make you wait ...  All my coworkers arrived at 11:30 it's now 12:30 and they haven't even gotten there salads ????? I mean really... Seems a bit unorganized and I think they need more staff ... We were all ready walk out after twenty minutes of asking for our check... We all get up and head to door and they finally approached us ... It shouldn't get to that point ... Never again at this location
Pauline M.,"Livermore, CA",0,205,799,3.0,10/20/2014,"Was greeted and seated by a very friendly manager.  Ordered fish and chips, Chinese chicken salad (light) and chicken pesto sandwich with a wedge salad.  Food was served promptly.  Fish was a bit overcooked.  Chinese chicken salad was excellent.  It had Napa cabbage, mandarin oranges, cubes of chicken and a refreshing dressing.  Chicken pesto sandwich was good but the wedge was mediocre due to the watery dressing and some type of sweetness that normally not on a wedge salad.  No more wedge in BJs!!"
Silvia W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,27,,4.0,12/16/2015,"Great place for family and friends. The meatball spaghetti, fried calamari, and ahi salad is really good. The price is reasonable and the service is good. Would like to go back when school starts"
Sendita L.,"Koreatown, Los Angeles, CA",366,117,206,3.0,6/10/2014,"I usually like BJs for lunch because it's easy, inexpensive and tasty. I had the lunch special (half sandwich/half soup) combo. It had the Chicken Club and the Calm Chowder. My friend had the caesar salad and chilli (which looked DELISH!).  There was a mix up with our soups so they were brought out a little late. No big deal.  One thing about this place on 06/09....what that it smelled SO BAD! Like bad feet...and wet carpet with mold. Not sure what was going on..."
Nachiket S.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,1,,3.0,7/16/2016,"Ordered the Mediterranean deep dish. Wasn't authentic at all, no layers and a miserable puffed up piece of bread. 4/10"
Freddy M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,52,49,5.0,11/26/2015,Family and I went to BJ the pizza was excellent we also had a salmon dish the salmon was excellent but the portion was very little maybe they should improve on that also the service was fair but overall it's a great place to go to
Esther P.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",358,96,2,4.0,3/26/2015,"Came here on a late weeknight, the place surprisingly had a good sized crowd even though it was spring break and closer to the closing time. My boyfriend and I just ordered  a pizookie which was amazing as always. Our server was super nice even though we only ordered that one item."
Amber C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/1/2016,"Usually I have good experiences with BJ's. But this last time it was terrible. Our waiter was very sweet and kind but the service was horrible. He asked us if we were ready to order and we told him we needed a few more minutes. Just about 15-20 minutes later WE had fo flag him down to tell him we were ready. My friend's burger came before the fries were done and he told her he'd grab them in in a second. She was nearly done with her burger (another 15-20 minutes) and again we had to get his attention. To speed the process up we asked for a box, dessert and check at the same time other we'd be there for an extra 40 minutes, waiting. The restaurant wasn't that busy so idk why it took him so long."
