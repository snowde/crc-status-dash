Lidiya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",300,346,735,4.0,12/7/2012,"This is a great place to unwind with a friend after work or school. Their menu has a decent selection of entrees, appetizers, soups, salads, kids' meals, gluten-free items, calorie-conscious meals, and of course, beer. The staff is very friendly and treats you like human beings instead of dollar signs, which is also nice. Never had a bad experience here.  The one thing that initially turned me off from BJs was the ""microbrewery"" aspect of the place; their beer is just OKAY. What made me change my mind was their cider--it's the perfect light compliment to just about anything you order, and it's delicious. Mmmmm! Wish they would expand their regular beer menu just a tad (I remember trying some of their seasonal selections and they were excellent; there need to be more of these!!!). My friend always gets the mac 'n cheese ($5 and it's loaded with cheese and bacon!); I love that you can make most things vegetarian on their menu and the servers don't get huffy over substitutions. I've tried a few of their sandwiches, pizzas (FLATBREADS!), and a pasta or two and haven't been disappointed; they've been consistent with flavor, presentation, and quality. The fries are average, which makes me a little bit sad.  The real winner is the dessert; if you haven't had a pizookie yet, you simply MUST try it. Just remember to wear the pants with the stretchy waistband. =P"
Ralph W.,"Duarte, CA",7,6,1,5.0,11/16/2014,"Excellent service great food. Calamari, salmon and fish & chips. The Jeremiah red is always good found out the Grand Gru is fantastic."
Zachary P.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,,2.0,6/24/2016,"I've been going to BJ's at multiple locations for years with always excellent quality food, beers and service. However, last night my girlfriend and I went to the BJ's at UCLA and had a cockroach crawling next to her head during our main course. We and our neighboring table had to get up and switch tables too. Obviously, we lost our appetites and our waiter was very apologetic. The manager initially came out and insisted we pay for our meals with the exception of our appetizer as an apologetic gesture on behalf of BJ's restaurant. Management states ""the unexpected guest came from outside and we cannot control that."" After a moment of surprised silence, we communicated that to management that we believed it was wrong of her to ask us to pay.  Management frowned at us and then said ""well, I can't take off alcohol because of state law. I am going to have to explain this."" Obviously, the situation and manager's firm stance left the both of us with a bad taste in our mouths. We still gave a generous tip to our waiter who was very kind and apologetic. I gave two stars for this review due to the memory of numerous past experiences of excellence.  (By the way, when we left, the cockroach was still at large.)"
Kira P.,"Los Angeles, CA",185,79,186,2.0,11/22/2012,"Every time someone asks me what is good at BJ's I always exclaim, 'I love their stuffed potatoes!'. Unfortunately, when our party of 5 arrived at BJ's in Westwood on Thanksgiving Eve, we were told they were out of ALL potatoes. We decided to start off with 2 orders of the Fried Artichokes (because one is never enough).  They told us that they were out but were making more.  With only a 7 minute wait for more we said we could wait. They came out fresh and delicious.   My bf ordered the soup and salad.  The soup looked and smelled amazing but we had to ask what kind of soup is this?  The guy who brought it told us it was tortilla soup.  So we sent it back since he had ordered chicken noodle and that's what he was in the mood for.  Turns out he wasn't too impressed with the chicken noodle and regrets sending the tortilla back since that one seemed like it would have tasted better.  His salad was served frozen, so we sent it back too.  The one they brought right back to him was much better.  This also allowed the server a little extra time to bring out the second dressing he had requested when we had initially place our order.   My dad ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was white and fluffy and the breading was crispy.   My step mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich which also had onion strings on it.  It was huge and Delicious! My sister ordered a burger.  It was huge and she said it was juicy.  She is a growing 17 year old 5'9"" softball player and she was only able to finish her fries and 1/2 the burger.   I ended up ordering the mahi mahi tacos grilled.  The seasoning was a bit bland and the fish was sort of dry.  Probably should have gone with one of their signature dishes and left the tacos for a Mexican Restaurant but that's my fault. We also ordered two pizookies for desert.  The triple chocolate and the original.  I was against ordering the triple because I thought it would be too much chocolate.  Surprisingly it was really good.  Yes it was chocolaty but not too much.  And the original was just as yummy as its always been!  Everyone at the table agreed that choosing to order the pizookie at the table was a MUCH better idea than standing in the cold out side, in the block and a 1/2 line that was forming outside of Diddy Reese. As we left the manager gave us a genuine 'have an amazing night' and 'Happy Thanksgiving'.   All in all I would give this restaurant another try.  I still need to fill my stuffed potato craving anyway ;)"
Adela M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,3.0,10/15/2015,"I had a really good dining experience, its just the food came out a little late. It was a very authentic design and while being a upclass resteraunt still managed to keep that good brewery feel. And the deep dish pizza was really good and the chicken wings with the root beer glaze was brilliant they do not have a good proceeding speed, also they are constantly making excuses to why the food is late, I would of gave it 5 stars but there organization is kind of sloppy and that's why it gets 3 stars oppose to 5"
Ben H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",6,54,2,4.0,5/7/2014,"Decent quality restaurant, good service, good food.   I'm a big fan of their deep dish pizza and pizookies.   If you're feeling adventurous, try the following: Buffalo Chicken Pizookie (you'll have to order the parts separately and assemble on your own :) - Mini Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizza (no cheese) - Peanut Butter Pizookie (Ice Cream on the side)   Pizookie goes on the bottom, then the pizza, then the ice cream. Much better than you would expect it to be. Let me know what you think if you end up trying this!"
Alex E.,"Encino, CA",216,62,122,5.0,7/5/2014,"I went here on the fourth of July and I love this place. Being that it was a holiday, it was not crowded at all so we got seated right away, which from what I understand is usually not the case. At the same time, they seemed to be short staffed because the service was slow, but I understand since it's Independence Day. I ordered a deep dish pizza and they accidentally brought out a thin crust. They replaced it with the thick crust without a charge, which was very nice. The great part was that I was able to try both. I certainly recommend the deep dish. The thin crust tastes like any old pizza but the deep dish is to die for. We got a large size so I had some left over that I ate the next day. We also had the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and it was delicious too. It came with some garlic bread which was really good too. But the best part was the dessert. If you go here, save room for a pizzookie, which is a pizza/cookie dessert. It has a nice warm cookie crust with ice cream on top. I think it is rated one of the best desserts in LA. This and Didi Reese across the street are amazing. We had the triple chocolate pizzokie, and if you like chocolate, you will love this one. It has a rich chocolate cookie that is unbelievable without being too rich. And to top it off it comes with double chocolate ice cream, which is chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips. I would go back in a heartbeat just for the dessert. The ambiance is great with lots of big screen TVs showing sports so it's a great place to watch a game if you like sports. Parking is difficult since it is in Westwood. There is no valet parking and the meters are usually full. We parked in the lot across the street, which was $ 6.50. I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a place to hang out with friends and have some great pizza."
Troy T.,"Venice, CA",521,24,,1.0,1/8/2014,"I guess I'll fork over a single star even though I've never had to the opportunity to try the food at this BJ's location.  WHY?!  Because every time I've called for delivery they've turned me away saying ""ummm... yeah we're just a little too busy right now"" or ""are you sure you want delivery, because it's going to be at least an hour.""   OHHHH I'm sorry! I was under the impression you wanted my money! MY BAD!"
Alice M.,"Mar Vista, CA",584,404,1028,4.0,9/6/2011,"Maybe I'm biased by fond memories of high school yearbook staff banquets and sharing 4 full party-sized pizookies among the 25 of us, but BJ's is a chain restaurant I don't mind going to. I recently discovered that their beer menu includes not only sampler flights, but also individual 5 oz glasses - perfect for a lightweight DD. The berry cider is pretty watery but I thought it was okay. MM and I share the small bbq chicken pizza in their iconic deepdish style with the crunchy crusty bottom and fluffy middle, topped with barbecue sauce, chicken cubes, fresh tomato, red onion, and cheese. Yum! I wouldn't stray off the pizza menu... the pastas are very meh and some of the other items are just bad. And eat it there - those pizzas just aren't the same when you bring it home as take-out. Sharing a small pizza between the two of us leaves plenty of room for a mini pizookie for dessert! I like it simple - chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream. It's really sweet, but there's just something about rich creamy ice cream melting over a warm baked cookie-in-a-pan that just gives me warm fuzzies."
Jess C.,"Los Angeles, CA",109,530,17,5.0,6/13/2012,"I've always had good service and food at BJs, but today I had an exceptional experience.   The kitchen messed up my order and the server and management took full responsibility for it.  In my experience, most restaurants blame the kitchen staff and give me a half apology before rushing off.  In this case the server apologized several times, the manager came out and personally handled it, and they held themselves accountable for it.  (BTW it was not even that big of a deal - they put my order in at the top of the queue and it came out in 5 minutes.  This is the way it should be handled!) Otherwise service was exceptional - waters always filled, food came fast.  This was during the busy lunch rush.  The pizza/salad lunch deal for $6.50 cannot be beat. I've always enjoyed BJ's but never really kept it at the front of my mind.  In the future I will be sure to push for it when eating in Westwood.  Thanks guys!"
Angel H.,"New York, NY",426,102,167,1.0,5/28/2013,"When I began working as an event coordinator at a neighboring university, colleagues suggested that BJ's Westwood always offered good catering service and food. Admittedly, my experience was pleasant for the first few times of communicating with the staff at BJ's.  Unfortunately, during our most recent luncheon, BJ's demonstrated the most unprofessional and disrespectful service. Here is a narration of the utterly infuriating experience.  On May 3, 2012, I placed an order on the phone with a BJ's staff, requesting a Friend's & Family meal for the following Monday. Usually, communicating with the staff at BJ's is fairly straightforward. Perhaps the person on the phone was having a rough day--he took a while to fully comprehend the order I'd like to place.  On the day of the luncheon (May 6, 2012), I received a call from BJ's around 40 min before the delivery time, asking me to place an order for another salad, for that the one I had originally ordered wasn't available. I hastily chose a salad and went to the conference room to prepare for the meeting. After much anticipation, the order was delivered around 12:10pm, which was a 25 min delay. Also, I noticed that the order was significantly smaller than what we have had before. Upon checking the receipt, all of the items were listed as ""Balsamic Chicken"", which hindered me from validating if we had gotten the correct order. As the delivery person left, we realized that plates and utensils were missing. Naturally, frustration grew in the conference room, as we have all been looking forward to eat lunch.  After 15 minutes of requesting plates to be delivered, we received them and everyone gobbled down the food. When the meeting was over, my boss informed me that BJ's had forgotten 2 large orders of salads, which were delivered 50 minutes later to the wrong location that happened to be the Chairman's office.  I called to ask to speak with a manager multiple times regarding the multiple mistakes that had occurred. During each phone call, I was either put on hold for a prolonged period of time, which led me to eventually ending the call, or that I was sent to speak with a manager who claimed to have no power to issue any monetary resolution for my case. Livid and insulted, I was discouraged to contact BJ's again.  Until last week, as I was walking by the eatery, I decided to step in and ask for the manager. When speaking with the manager, I was told that late deliveries were normal occurrences, suggesting that I should not have been dissatisfied because of the late order. I was baffled--What is the point of specifying a delivery time if it is meant to be delayed? Such poor work ethics is unheard of in my career.  Noticing the manager's nonchalance about my complaint, I proceeded to list the mistakes that BJ's had committed within one catering order. He then told me that the delivery person was faced with ""a door slammed in his face"" when he attempted to deliver the missing salads 50 minutes later. I was in the conference room during the luncheon, and I honestly did not witness such rudeness being performed. Bewildered by the manager's attitude, I recounted the importance of customer relations and asked for the manager's resolution. Ultimately, he offered two BJ's gift cards, which I gave to my boss when I returned to the office.  I do not dine at BJ's because of the greasy foods and large portions. After this series of flippant customer service, my personal preference has been reinforced. In addition, I do not recommend BJ's catering service."
Lillian Q.,"Chino Hills, CA",21,99,30,1.0,3/3/2014,BJ's is a chain restaurant so the food is pretty much the same elsewhere. However the service was crap. My friend was the birthday girl and made a reservation for 8. I was coming half an hour late so I told them to order before me. I arrive and sit down at our table. At first I waited patiently for the waitress to come to our table so that I could order something small to eat and a drink for the birthday girl. Not once did she come to our table or give me the slightest notice. Then I tried to flag her down but she did not seem to have noticed me waving my hands like crazy.  So let me retract my star. She gets NO STAR for NO SERVICE.  She finally came to our table half an hour later to give us the bill. I had not ordered a single thing. I don't understand how this restaurant functions. I have never felt so defeated at a restaurant before. At least BJ's still has their freaking 1200 calorie pizookie to save them.
James B.,"Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA",1109,1101,1387,4.0,3/29/2012,"BJ's is one of the few restaurant chains I actually return to for the following reasons: 1) AMAZING deep dish pizzas! 2) Various flavors of Pizookies! My favorites are the white chocolate macadamia and Oreo. You can even request half of each. I've tried other entrees and I've been disappointed quite a few times. I've NEVER been disappointed with their pizzas. My mouth waters every time I see a large pizza being carried to a table. As a matter of fact, my mouth is watering as I write this review! I need to get my fix! Service: Service is good here. If you're not satisfied, they'll take care of whatever you need. Parking: Can be quite annoying and pricey. It is westwood after all. None of the parking here is free."
Matt E.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,25,,1.0,7/9/2014,"Eesh, just bad service. Yes, we came in during the lunch rush, but a restaurant Westwood shouldn't be unprepared at this hour. And they were plenty staffed. It was just a head-scratching experience and I would never recommend this BJ's location to anyone. Sat down and waited 10 mins till a server acknowledged us. Ordered a root beer but it never arrived because the server said no one would change out the tap...ok. Halfway into my meal I ordered a coke...it came at the end of my meal. And our waters were never refilled.  I also noticed the manager working the room but he never came to our table. So, now I turn to Yelp."
Adam S.,"Los Angeles, CA",73,26,8,2.0,10/25/2014,"This review is not for BJs as a franchise. This is for this specific restaurant. Every time I come here the manager has to apologize for something. The waitress is usually slacking (talking to boyfriend outside, bad service, ignoring tables, etc), the food comes out watery and no flavor, or one of many other problems. I normally don't complain about restaurants or leave a lower end tip... But this place needs to shape up. After many times dining here.... I can say there are many other places nearby that are better. The food is decent.. But nobody remembers the food.... You remember how you are treated."
Mizraim A.,"Inglewood, CA",1,22,5,3.0,10/5/2013,"Good food , great customer service and they manage to get you a table in little time ! Try the calamari appetizer , loved it here and pizzas are the best will Definitely  comeback ."
Rachel K.,"Los Angeles, CA",50,53,3,1.0,9/2/2014,"Odd service experience...and not in a good way. I don't think I've ever had such an odd service experience as I did last night, I'm still thinking about it.  My friend and I popped into BJs in Westwood after seeing a movie nearby.  Our waitress Marissa seemed weird to begin with but whatever.  But then, we experienced firsthand that her service was also weird.  Important to note is that the waiter station where the waiters put their orders into the computer was literally three feet from our booth.   Marissa delivered our food and stepped aside the couple of feet over to the waiter station to do something on the computer.  In the same moment that she delivered our food, we realized that she had never brought us any place settings/utensils, so we could not eat our food.  As mentioned, we noticed this pretty much right when she brought us our food but she had slid behind the waiter station before asking if we needed anything else/before we had the chance to tell her we needed something else.  We immediately said ""excuse me"" noting that we needed something right away before we could start eating, however, Marissa continued looking at her computer and told us to ""hold on.""  So we sat there for several seconds unable to eat our food until another server asked what we needed and got us utensils. The next major weird incident was when we went to pay.  Marissa brought us our bill and my friend put her credit card in with our check and handed it to Marissa -- forgetting to get my credit card so we could split it.  Marissa turned to her computer to run the credit card but, just then, before she even started, I handed her my card and asked her to please split the bill.  Marissa (again with keeping her eyes on the computer and refusing to give me eye contact) said, ""Sorry, I just use the first card that is given to me and REFUSED to take my card - I was really confused by this.  My friend ended up paying for our whole meal since Marissa wouldn't LET ME split it with her.  We mentioned these odd occurrences to the manager and he was pretty apathetic about it.  Weird and safe to say I won't be back."
Winnie L.,"Rowland Heights, CA",1014,858,39789,4.0,4/11/2009,"I'll let the voted-Funniest Anh make the dirty jokes about BJ's.  If you like deep-dish Chicago pizza, you might prefer to go to another franchise to avoid the college kids, whether they be Bruins looking for an alternative to dorm food or Trojans who infiltrate Bruintown and wearing their cardinal and gold.   On this particular Good Friday, there were many collegiate sports teams wearing their team jackets and digging into great pizza.  There is always a wait for BJ's, but not all was lost when a waitress pulled a C&O's and offered us generous slices of cheese and tomato pizza while we were curbside    (for those of you unfamiliar with C&O's, they offer garlic rolls gratis to patrons waiting for a table in the cold) We were served by a Korean guy named Richard on paper but called himself Jin.  He's the new Ed at this BJ's.   We had a medium Vegetarian pizza, spotted with tomatoes, black olives, mushroom, bell peppers and onions. The mozzarella cheese sticks, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, are served with marinara sauce but you can ask for Ranch if you like BJ's Favorite is the vegetarian + meatballs, pepperoni, Italian sausage pizza.  The Buffalo Chicken pizza is like buffalo chicken on pizza.  Such a simple yet ingenious idea.  Tasty too.    Strawberry lemonades were super cool here back in the early 2000's before other restaurant chains started offering them so skip them and order the BJ's Sampler:     Be prepared to get tipsy. If this is your first time, save some room for the Cookies 'n Cream Pizookie (like a cookie in a pan with ice cream on top).  Old-timers can save their money by going across the street for some Diddy Reese ice cream sandwiches for dessert. See what I was talking about all right here: "
Sarah W.,"San Mateo, CA",197,521,42,4.0,5/19/2011,"I came here because I was forced to but enjoyed my meal for the most part. If you're headed here get the avocado spring roll app, OMG. Even though it's $11 it's totally worth it. They are delicious. But how couldn't they since they're slices of avocado, cream cheese, chipotle mayo and other randomz wrapped in fried wonton skins.  They also have a decent beer selection to my surprise! You know, I may just go there tomorrow for the app alone... On the flipside: do not do not do not do not do not do not get the mac'n'cheese heart attack on a plate for untasty food. And do not get the tuna tartare. The pulled pork sandwich is aiiite. The french fries are aiiiite but not worth the price. Cheers!"
Karishma G.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",24,28,16,4.0,8/29/2013,"I had often heard of this place, but had not got to try it. Yesterday went here for lunch. This place has very good food.. I like liked their hand tossed pizza.  The 4 star rating is for the extremely friendly service.  Its little on the pricier side, but appreciable food!! Would visit again.."
